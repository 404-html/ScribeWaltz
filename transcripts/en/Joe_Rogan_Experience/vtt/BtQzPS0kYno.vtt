00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Some cool Bosco,</v>

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Gino and aj from La speed weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You a la live.</v>

3
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Are you tweeting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe just recorded a jingle for us.</v>

4
00:00:14.261 --> 00:00:18.490
<v Speaker 1>So that's your jingle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Ringtone.</v>

5
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

6
00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Gina has been my friend for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's basically a,</v>

7
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy that turned me onto this</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole la marijuana delivery scene that</v>

8
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.570
<v Speaker 1>is going on in La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was amazing for Comedians and for</v>

9
00:00:36.821 --> 00:00:41.440
<v Speaker 1>anybody who has a medical card where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could just call this cool dude and he</v>

10
00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:44.380
<v Speaker 1>would tell you what the great stuff is</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you hang out with them and talk with</v>

11
00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:47.110
<v Speaker 1>them and you could buy it and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all totally legal and above board.</v>

12
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.030
<v Speaker 1>It was all good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But somewhere along the line some</v>

13
00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:54.550
<v Speaker 1>fuckery ran afoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

14
00:00:54.551 --> 00:00:56.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came up with some new political</v>

15
00:00:56.981 --> 00:01:01.190
<v Speaker 1>rules that keep marijuana delivery</v>
<v Speaker 1>services from operating busy.</v>

16
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Keep explaining it because essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they've set it up,</v>

17
00:01:04.151 --> 00:01:07.570
<v Speaker 1>it's like you would have to have had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>license to operate in each one of the</v>

18
00:01:07.571 --> 00:01:09.700
<v Speaker 1>houses that you're delivering to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that how it works?</v>

19
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it used to be called the wild west.</v>

20
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out here in California for medical</v>

21
00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:17.920
<v Speaker 2>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

22
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.380
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it very much was until they wanted to</v>

23
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:26.381
<v Speaker 2>regulate it and most of the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted it regulated because they wanted</v>

24
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.370
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

25
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.690
<v Speaker 2>let's take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's have marijuana.</v>

26
00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:30.740
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's regulate it.</v>

27
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 2>However it will hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People think that marijuana is legal in</v>

28
00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:35.240
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is,</v>

29
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.890
<v Speaker 2>it is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely not.</v>

30
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.020
<v Speaker 2>What we have is protection from</v>
<v Speaker 2>prosecution.</v>

31
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.810
<v Speaker 2>That's what we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that law enforcement can</v>

32
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:44.000
<v Speaker 2>knock your door down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take your stuff,</v>

33
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.500
<v Speaker 2>take your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd take your cash,</v>

34
00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:48.380
<v Speaker 2>take whatever you got there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can show them all the papers in</v>

35
00:01:48.381 --> 00:01:49.610
<v Speaker 2>the world and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

36
00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:50.960
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're glad you're legal.</v>

37
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Bring it to the judge and you'll be good</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go and you'll get your stuff back in</v>

38
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:57.110
<v Speaker 2>a year and you guys will be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's happened to us.</v>

39
00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.890
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

40
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.470
<v Speaker 1>But do you get your stuff back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I've heard there's a lot of</v>

41
00:02:00.471 --> 00:02:02.210
<v Speaker 1>people that have never gotten their</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep,</v>

42
00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:03.530
<v Speaker 1>but we always have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We.</v>

43
00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:05.240
<v Speaker 1>So how long have they kept your stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>for?</v>

44
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.530
<v Speaker 2>A little over a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Year.</v>

45
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.130
<v Speaker 2>So if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have weed over a year,</v>

46
00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:11.960
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not taking care of it.</v>

47
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.330
<v Speaker 2>It's done a weeds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Useless.</v>

48
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.300
<v Speaker 2>It's useless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you lose how much money that cost</v>

49
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.131
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

50
00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:22.880
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to set it a substantial</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of money of course.</v>

51
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.850
<v Speaker 1>And so they give you the cash back,</v>

52
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.370
<v Speaker 2>they'll give it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can actually cut you a check.</v>

53
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.460
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Check for the cash from the district</v>

54
00:02:32.461 --> 00:02:33.530
<v Speaker 2>attorney's office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

55
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.800
<v Speaker 2>I have one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

56
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.890
<v Speaker 2>hanging on his wall in his office of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them returning thousands,</v>

57
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.750
<v Speaker 2>a few thousand dollars to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

58
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.660
<v Speaker 2>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when there was any sort of trouble,</v>

59
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.210
<v Speaker 2>it was all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go see a judge,</v>

60
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 2>you go see the judge and the judge looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the paperwork.</v>

61
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 2>And in our first case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the judge said,</v>

62
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.420
<v Speaker 2>we've never seen a more compliant</v>
<v Speaker 2>company in California and dismissed</v>

63
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 2>without</v>

64
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 3>prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And our lawyer asked,</v>

65
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 3>instead of dismissing without prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we actually would like that entered in</v>

66
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 3>to the record that you're calling la</v>
<v Speaker 3>speed.</v>

67
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:11.900
<v Speaker 3>We the most compliant marijuana company</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've ever,</v>

68
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.880
<v Speaker 3>ever dealt with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we had an entered into,</v>

69
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 3>into um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the record.</v>

70
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 3>Didn't translate though it didn't you</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy have a lawsuit on my desk that I'm</v>

71
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 3>holding my hands 18 inches apart by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

72
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.460
<v Speaker 3>that is that high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just lawsuit from the city.</v>

73
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.440
<v Speaker 1>It's just super unfortunate because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously not the will of the people,</v>

74
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever something is not the will of</v>

75
00:03:30.511 --> 00:03:33.450
<v Speaker 1>the people I could see it's clear by all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gentlemen in this room,</v>

76
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.420
<v Speaker 1>we're all grown adults and we all enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>

77
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.050
<v Speaker 1>We all have responsible lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all do stuff,</v>

78
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 1>we all get things done and we all enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and we're taxpayer.</v>

79
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.860
<v Speaker 1>So we're normal people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not freaks.</v>

80
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.340
<v Speaker 1>We're not like Ne'er do wells or someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's clinging off the system and,</v>

81
00:03:52.771 --> 00:03:54.720
<v Speaker 1>and fucking up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.760
<v Speaker 1>a social systems that we've set up for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are trying to get by in this</v>

83
00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:01.344
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

84
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.230
<v Speaker 3>we're just guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And let's talk about what you said just</v>

85
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:10.231
<v Speaker 3>before the will of the people when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>voted on this,</v>

86
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.150
<v Speaker 3>this proposition d,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a zoning law.</v>

87
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.970
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have any of you guys even ever heard of</v>

88
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:19.450
<v Speaker 3>Zoning Ordinance Measure d?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Has anyone heard of that?</v>

89
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

90
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 3>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course not.</v>

91
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 3>Has anyone heard of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but hold on.</v>

92
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:26.130
<v Speaker 3>We haven't heard of any zoning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody does.</v>

93
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing is nobody pays</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to zoning laws,</v>

94
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.440
<v Speaker 3>so now speed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weed and services like ours that are</v>

95
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:35.320
<v Speaker 3>doing things the right way are closed</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in the city,</v>

96
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 3>because of the zoning ordinance that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>passed because all these pot shops are</v>

97
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 3>opening up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they said they're opening near</v>

98
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 3>schools and churches got to protect the</v>
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>

99
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.290
<v Speaker 3>Got Every hilarious that opening them</v>
<v Speaker 3>near churches is an issue.</v>

100
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be politics in church and</v>
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

101
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 3>It's politics.</v>

102
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.500
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that during the old days of the</v>

103
00:04:54.501 --> 00:04:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Catholic church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they would walk down the aisle with</v>

104
00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:59.600
<v Speaker 1>that incense thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will be burning marijuana.</v>

105
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 1>That's what they would be burning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be wafting it through the room</v>

106
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:05.870
<v Speaker 1>as they walk by your mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know those things,</v>

107
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.630
<v Speaker 1>they get around those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had weed in them.</v>

108
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.250
<v Speaker 1>There's a pamphlet online about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to end up.</v>

109
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Might not be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like it's not sure.</v>

110
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Let's just run with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Jamie,</v>

111
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.850
<v Speaker 1>genesis 1:47.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably one of them.</v>

112
00:05:19.851 --> 00:05:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Todd mccord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in quotes,</v>

113
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.970
<v Speaker 1>but probably told me that and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

114
00:05:22.971 --> 00:05:23.990
<v Speaker 1>that's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

115
00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:25.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even going to bother looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>that up.</v>

116
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.690
<v Speaker 1>It sounds so good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly cannabis has been part of</v>

117
00:05:29.691 --> 00:05:34.691
<v Speaker 1>the human record since the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bizarre time we live in and it's</v>

118
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.190
<v Speaker 1>a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated explanation.</v>

119
00:05:40.191 --> 00:05:42.290
<v Speaker 1>If someone who's never heard it before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

120
00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:43.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did it get illegal?</v>

121
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Most of it got illegal because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>William Randolph hearst,</v>

122
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.050
<v Speaker 1>which is bananas that here we are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>2016 and this fucking crazy man from the</v>

123
00:05:54.621 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>19 thirties who's running all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>running</v>

124
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.660
<v Speaker 4>everything and the the man that citizen</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kanes based on the Western welles movie,</v>

125
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.930
<v Speaker 4>he was just a maniac and he decided to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get marijuana eat to make it illegal so</v>

126
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 4>that hemp would be illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct?</v>

127
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The tax papers,</v>

128
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 4>timber industry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it is insane that the propaganda</v>

129
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 4>that this guy created,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the 19 thirties,</v>

130
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 4>even though we recognize that everyone</v>
<v Speaker 4>knows it,</v>

131
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 4>it's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can watch it.</v>

132
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.160
<v Speaker 4>You can watch reefer madness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can see what's written down,</v>

133
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 4>what they were they were attempting to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do to make it illegal.</v>

134
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.900
<v Speaker 4>The fact that it still sticks in 2016</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you couldn't smoke that stuff that</v>

135
00:06:34.901 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they had any.</v>

136
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:37.383
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

137
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 4>It's not psychoactive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

138
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:42.020
<v Speaker 4>that is the craziest part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we added on it.</v>

139
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.930
<v Speaker 4>We sell him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we have to buy it from Canada.</v>

140
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.630
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Buy It from Canada and bring it down to</v>

141
00:06:47.631 --> 00:06:50.270
<v Speaker 4>the United States because even though</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's legal and it's not psychoactive,</v>

142
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.600
<v Speaker 4>these farmers can't grow it major.</v>

143
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.530
<v Speaker 4>They're starting to try to change those</v>
<v Speaker 4>laws,</v>

144
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 4>but as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't know of any large scale</v>

145
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.480
<v Speaker 4>hemp growing operations here in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>United States.</v>

146
00:06:59.481 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 4>Not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not yet dangerous.</v>

147
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.980
<v Speaker 4>Like China's just dedicated millions of</v>
<v Speaker 4>acres.</v>

148
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.620
<v Speaker 4>You're on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You will have to worry about your own</v>

149
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:10.190
<v Speaker 4>government when you're growing a plant</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you make clothes out of.</v>

150
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.110
<v Speaker 4>You make paper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all they're doing with it.</v>

151
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's be really clear on that,</v>

152
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:14.900
<v Speaker 4>that the Hamptons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're growing.</v>

153
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.770
<v Speaker 4>He can't get high off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's totally non psychoactive.</v>

154
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.800
<v Speaker 4>Yet it's federally illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a fucking plant that makes the</v>

155
00:07:23.931 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 4>best clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes way stronger fabric,</v>

156
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.000
<v Speaker 4>way stronger paper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can eat it.</v>

157
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.990
<v Speaker 4>It has all the essential amino acids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a full complete amino acid</v>

158
00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 4>profile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the very few plans that's</v>

159
00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:37.040
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can make bio fuel out of it.</v>

160
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.670
<v Speaker 4>You can make fucking livestock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you look at old ironsides,</v>

161
00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:42.530
<v Speaker 4>the USS Constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the flag,</v>

162
00:07:42.531 --> 00:07:43.030
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>

163
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.200
<v Speaker 4>and the sales are made of hemp and there</v>
<v Speaker 4>are still.</v>

164
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.900
<v Speaker 4>Those are the original things for</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of years ago.</v>

165
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.170
<v Speaker 4>One of the best things that nature has</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever created.</v>

166
00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:54.410
<v Speaker 4>This fucking fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has this incredibly powerful fiber.</v>

167
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:59.240
<v Speaker 4>Like who the fuck was at?</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of my friends has an actual hemp</v>

168
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:01.130
<v Speaker 4>stalk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

169
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.050
<v Speaker 4>I was over his house and I picked it up</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

170
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:05.750
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like a fucking alien plant</v>

171
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.440
<v Speaker 4>because it's hard as a hardwood tensile</v>
<v Speaker 4>strength.</v>

172
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 4>The stronger than steel when it's wound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

173
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.680
<v Speaker 4>So it feels hard like oak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's light like Balsa Wood.</v>

174
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:17.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really weird.</v>

175
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.770
<v Speaker 4>You can make spaceships out of this</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

176
00:08:18.771 --> 00:08:22.700
<v Speaker 4>It feels like it's light and strong and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not using it because it's illegal.</v>

177
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:24.470
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>

178
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.870
<v Speaker 4>Parachutes used to be made out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

179
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.580
<v Speaker 4>I know George Bush senior jumped out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a plane in a with a hemp parachute,</v>

180
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>

181
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.590
<v Speaker 4>So all canvases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all canvases.</v>

182
00:08:36.591 --> 00:08:40.040
<v Speaker 4>The Mona Lisa was painted on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cannabis was unhappy.</v>

183
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.960
<v Speaker 4>Our founding fathers had hempfields in</v>
<v Speaker 4>their farms because the head cleans the</v>

184
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.590
<v Speaker 4>fallow fields after wheat fucks up your</v>
<v Speaker 4>fields and corn fucks up your fields.</v>

185
00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:49.940
<v Speaker 4>Hip goes in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cleans it all out.</v>

186
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.170
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

187
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:56.400
<v Speaker 4>it's such an identifier of how goofy</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are here in 2016,</v>

188
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.400
<v Speaker 3>that that's an issue that we're dealing</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this weird hemp thing because it's</v>

189
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 3>related to marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does anyone hear this though?</v>

190
00:09:05.701 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did people really with,</v>

191
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.620
<v Speaker 3>with trump and hillary and Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do people really care that they do?</v>

192
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.560
<v Speaker 3>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

193
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.930
<v Speaker 3>Most people have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people think there's some health</v>

194
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.380
<v Speaker 3>related risks and that's the reason why</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was made illegal.</v>

195
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.990
<v Speaker 3>That's why we're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so for such a frustrating time for</v>

196
00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:25.260
<v Speaker 3>us because we start talking about Zoning</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ordinance d and people are like,</v>

197
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm so bored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't we just get baked?</v>

198
00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:28.920
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean you're out of business?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

199
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:30.690
<v Speaker 3>don't you feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long have you guys been in the</v>

200
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:32.970
<v Speaker 3>business?</v>
<v Speaker 3>About six years.</v>

201
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.910
<v Speaker 3>Six years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much has changed in six years?</v>

202
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:40.440
<v Speaker 3>So much since I've had a card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got my card in.</v>

203
00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.130
<v Speaker 3>It was the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nineties,</v>

204
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.180
<v Speaker 3>so there is one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just one state here.</v>

205
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.960
<v Speaker 3>When we got in the business there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>about five states that are legal now</v>

206
00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:56.250
<v Speaker 3>there's 24 in Florida is going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's going to be 25 plus DC.</v>

207
00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.980
<v Speaker 3>It's half the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

208
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.040
<v Speaker 3>And CBD is at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you conclude cbd,</v>

209
00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:04.350
<v Speaker 3>there's only like seven or eight states</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are not participating,</v>

210
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.750
<v Speaker 3>like seven or eight states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess now I'm thinking about it.</v>

211
00:10:07.751 --> 00:10:11.010
<v Speaker 3>I guess it was more like 2001.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still way early,</v>

212
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.440
<v Speaker 3>but my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my point was going to be that it's way</v>

213
00:10:13.441 --> 00:10:15.930
<v Speaker 3>more relaxed now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's way more prevalent.</v>

214
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.650
<v Speaker 3>I used to have to go to Inglewood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to Inglewood wellness center is</v>

215
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.840

216
00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:27.810
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's how it was when we started,</v>

217
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.930
<v Speaker 3>right when we started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it wasn't much of a smoker when I</v>

218

<v Speaker 3>next side.</v>

232
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.720
<v Speaker 3>Wheeler Walker Jr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How funny is that dude?</v>

233
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's hilarious.</v>

234
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.410
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so Ha was um,</v>

235
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were working in a stressful</v>

236
00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:24.780
<v Speaker 3>environment working for congress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

237
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time.</v>

238
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.900
<v Speaker 3>And he was actually drinking to medicate</v>
<v Speaker 3>himself as we were,</v>

239
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>working,</v>

240
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.710
<v Speaker 3>doing technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coding and things like that.</v>

241
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.030
<v Speaker 3>And he started playing with a new world</v>
<v Speaker 3>tropics to say,</v>

242
00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:40.410
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to drink anymore.</v>

243
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.330
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of new world tropics,</v>

244
00:11:42.331 --> 00:11:44.980
<v Speaker 3>why don't you try cannabis?</v>
<v Speaker 3>YOu know what?</v>

245
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.760
<v Speaker 3>I was that guy who had the shelves of</v>
<v Speaker 3>modafinil and annual paps and all and</v>

246
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:53.470
<v Speaker 3>you're healthy and all these different</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy thinGs that you can get on off the</v>

247
00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 3>market.</v>

248
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.570
<v Speaker 5>And gina was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just smoke this.</v>

249
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.770
<v Speaker 5>Just put all that shit away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Put the booze away and just smoke this.</v>

250
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:59.261
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

251
00:11:59.261 --> 00:12:00.760
<v Speaker 5>it's going to make me freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

252
00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:05.761
<v Speaker 5>one thing that nootropics do help,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it helps me to maintain memory while</v>

253
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.420
<v Speaker 5>under the influence because it's one of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the most slippery things while being</v>

254
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.600
<v Speaker 5>under the influence of pot as the memory</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

255
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.050
<v Speaker 5>the memory gets real slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

256
00:12:15.051 --> 00:12:17.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I gave him mouth the brain also.</v>

257
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:19.180
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we first first started.</v>

258
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That'll help.</v>

259
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.160
<v Speaker 5>Some people say that nicotine actually</v>
<v Speaker 5>helps in some strange way.</v>

260
00:12:24.161 --> 00:12:26.770
<v Speaker 5>I use nicotine everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your nicorette.</v>

261
00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:29.050
<v Speaker 5>I've never smoked it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He started,</v>

262
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.600
<v Speaker 5>he started chewing the nicotine gum,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

263
00:12:31.601 --> 00:12:32.550
<v Speaker 5>a few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>

264
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.000
<v Speaker 5>so you're on the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>

265
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:35.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well this is what it is.</v>

266
00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:40.660
<v Speaker 5>Like nicotine itself apparently has a</v>
<v Speaker 5>similar effects to a lot of nootropics</v>

267
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:45.190
<v Speaker 5>and that it does something to stimulate</v>
<v Speaker 5>your brain function,</v>

268
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.490
<v Speaker 5>but smoking is fucking horrible for you.</v>

269
00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.240
<v Speaker 5>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not really the getting of the</v>

270
00:12:52.241 --> 00:12:55.220
<v Speaker 5>nicotine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is so confusing because you</v>

271
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.330
<v Speaker 5>automatically assume nicotine equals</v>
<v Speaker 5>lung cancer.</v>

272
00:12:58.331 --> 00:12:59.980
<v Speaker 5>Everybody dies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so sad.</v>

273
00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:01.510
<v Speaker 5>why do they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you,</v>

274
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.830
<v Speaker 5>why are you doing nicotine?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they go,</v>

275
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.440
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the smoking of these chemicals</v>

276
00:13:05.441 --> 00:13:07.570
<v Speaker 5>that's fucking up your lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's giving you cancer,</v>

277
00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:10.510
<v Speaker 5>it's irritating your lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know when people cough,</v>

278
00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:11.990
<v Speaker 5>it's harsh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucks your lungs up,</v>

279
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.850
<v Speaker 5>you get cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you die.</v>

280
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.100
<v Speaker 5>That's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not the nicotine's fault.</v>

281
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:15.963
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>

282
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:20.900
<v Speaker 5>So nicotine itself is some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>very strange compound that sort of like</v>

283
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.560
<v Speaker 5>stimulates your mind a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

284
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.330
<v Speaker 5>I think it's the drug that just knows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you're wired,</v>

285
00:13:25.331 --> 00:13:27.970
<v Speaker 5>it relaxes you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're a little bit cloudy headed,</v>

286
00:13:27.971 --> 00:13:30.820
<v Speaker 5>it gives you a boost of energy to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like it's in your veins,</v>

287
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.160
<v Speaker 5>your.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's your friend.</v>

288
00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.940
<v Speaker 5>The drug.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who knows?</v>

289
00:13:33.941 --> 00:13:34.774
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who</v>

290
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.300
<v Speaker 5>knows?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A boy has no name the gum.</v>

291
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.490
<v Speaker 5>It's so gross.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love it,</v>

292
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.130
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at you.</v>

293
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.750
<v Speaker 5>The drug that knows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's hilarious.</v>

294
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.210
<v Speaker 5>The four milligram coated for flavor</v>
<v Speaker 5>from target.</v>

295
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.280
<v Speaker 5>Oh brother.</v>

296
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:49.720
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted,</v>

297
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:54.940
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do what I could to try and</v>
<v Speaker 2>help help this situation.</v>

298
00:13:55.161 --> 00:13:57.260
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't really need to be helped that</v>

299
00:13:57.261 --> 00:13:58.190
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I said,</v>

300
00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.390
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should just try,</v>

301
00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:01.100
<v Speaker 2>try marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

302
00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.310
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's what regulates my mood and has</v>

303
00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.360
<v Speaker 2>since I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been smoking almost daily since 15</v>

304
00:14:08.361 --> 00:14:09.740
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

309
00:14:16.011 --> 00:14:16.500
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>

310
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.490
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

311
00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.220
<v Speaker 5>because this is back in the early days</v>
<v Speaker 5>when everything was sketchy.</v>

312
00:14:20.221 --> 00:14:24.700
<v Speaker 5>So we go to this office building that is</v>
<v Speaker 5>up in san fernando and there's barbed</v>

313
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.630
<v Speaker 5>wire around the building.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We go into sketchy office building and</v>

314
00:14:27.631 --> 00:14:28.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm freaking out the whole time,</v>

321
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.160
<v Speaker 5>And we go into this office,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this doctor's office,</v>

322
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.270
<v Speaker 5>clearly not a doctor's office.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they say,</v>

323
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:44.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the doctor will see you both now and now</v>

324
00:14:44.611 --> 00:14:48.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm freaking out thinking like what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to get undressed in front of my</v>

325
00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:50.730
<v Speaker 5>brother and sit on the paper with this</v>
<v Speaker 5>doctor.</v>

326
00:14:50.731 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't whAt I'm doing.</v>

327
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.270
<v Speaker 3>And we just go into a room and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>table and he sits across from us and he</v>

328
00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:57.950
<v Speaker 3>asked me first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately,</v>

329
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.400
<v Speaker 3>what you need weed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>

330
00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:01.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm staring at him,</v>

331
00:15:01.821 --> 00:15:03.380
<v Speaker 3>my brothers look at me and I could feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>him going,</v>

332
00:15:03.381 --> 00:15:05.090
<v Speaker 3>don't fuck this up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like don't fuck this up.</v>

333
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:06.201
<v Speaker 3>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

334
00:15:06.201 --> 00:15:07.190
<v Speaker 3>you have stress?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

335
00:15:07.191 --> 00:15:08.870
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have terrible sleep.</v>

336
00:15:08.871 --> 00:15:09.704
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

337
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:10.700
<v Speaker 3>It says okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have weed.</v>

338
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:11.630
<v Speaker 3>And he called it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd,</v>

339
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.030
<v Speaker 3>he called it wheat and then he goes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>my brother,</v>

340
00:15:14.031 --> 00:15:15.530
<v Speaker 3>why do you need we eat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my brother goes,</v>

341
00:15:15.531 --> 00:15:17.720
<v Speaker 3>I have stress and trouble sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He the okay you have weed.</v>

342
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.080
<v Speaker 3>And we got these papers and it felt so</v>
<v Speaker 3>sketchy,</v>

343
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:25.430
<v Speaker 3>but we went to a dispensary that</v>
<v Speaker 3>afternoon and it's like those early</v>

344
00:15:25.431 --> 00:15:29.360
<v Speaker 3>people that started to open dispensary's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the inglewood wellness center.</v>

345
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.730
<v Speaker 3>Those people who like the pioneers in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wild,</v>

346
00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:34.030
<v Speaker 3>wild west.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a gangster moved.</v>

347
00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:37.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it took some of the criminal element to</v>

348
00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:41.510
<v Speaker 3>be in business at that point and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>why going back to these laws that say</v>

349
00:15:41.511 --> 00:15:46.511
<v Speaker 3>you had to be in business before 2007 in</v>
<v Speaker 3>order to even be considered in these few</v>

350
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.020
<v Speaker 3>that are allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well let's explain.</v>

351
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.840
<v Speaker 3>Let's explain the whole zoning thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the issue is delivery,</v>

352
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where the issue is.</v>

353
00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.290
<v Speaker 3>So prop the is what governs all of las</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana laws.</v>

354
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.840
<v Speaker 3>That's a zoning law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

355
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:06.350
<v Speaker 3>so there's 135 shops that are allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the ones that have been</v>

356
00:16:06.351 --> 00:16:10.910
<v Speaker 3>operating since 2007.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're called pre ico is any other shop</v>

357
00:16:10.911 --> 00:16:14.660
<v Speaker 3>you go to is illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any delivery service you use in the city</v>

358
00:16:14.661 --> 00:16:17.480
<v Speaker 3>of la is illegal according to</v>
<v Speaker 3>proposition d,</v>

359
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.280
<v Speaker 3>which we are fighting in court by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

360
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:22.750
<v Speaker 3>We are fighting that and that law just</v>
<v Speaker 3>came out in,</v>

361
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.250
<v Speaker 3>in uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2012,</v>

362
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:29.600
<v Speaker 3>2013,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2014.</v>

363
00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.910
<v Speaker 3>So we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we hadn't been in business for years.</v>

364
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:36.200
<v Speaker 3>We had already been working with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>state government for years on,</v>

365
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:40.280
<v Speaker 3>on the process of legalization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>we advise the state assembly were the</v>

366
00:16:40.281 --> 00:16:43.220
<v Speaker 3>only retail company on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the board of equalization stakeholder</v>

367
00:16:43.221 --> 00:16:43.810
<v Speaker 3>panel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

368
00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:48.020
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm in the weeds right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like we are the company that instead</v>

369
00:16:48.021 --> 00:16:49.310
<v Speaker 3>of suing us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should have just said,</v>

370
00:16:49.311 --> 00:16:51.050
<v Speaker 3>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's a good way to do this?</v>

371
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.880
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's important to talk about</v>

372
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:53.970
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

373
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.080
<v Speaker 3>the board of equalization is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the irs for the state.</v>

374
00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.110
<v Speaker 3>If you're a commercial business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you pay your taxes to the board of</v>

375
00:17:00.111 --> 00:17:01.430
<v Speaker 3>equalization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

376
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:06.580
<v Speaker 3>the board of equalization chose our</v>
<v Speaker 3>company as the one retail company that</v>

377
00:17:06.681 --> 00:17:09.590
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to present to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>legislature,</v>

378
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.720
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the people with,</v>

379
00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.040
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with we presented with the New York</v>

380
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.160
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

381
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:16.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

382
00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:19.040
<v Speaker 3>the California state troopers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

383
00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.830
<v Speaker 3>the highway patrol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the teamsters insurance company,</v>

384
00:17:21.831 --> 00:17:25.610
<v Speaker 3>and an app company and us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I just say the board of equalization</v>

385
00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.320
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that name,</v>

386
00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.010
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like some sort of an overseer</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a woody allen movie,</v>

387
00:17:31.011 --> 00:17:35.450
<v Speaker 3>but the future they kind of are the</v>
<v Speaker 3>board of equalization that some like</v>

388
00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.960
<v Speaker 3>fucking utopian nightmare mirror the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right theory.</v>

389
00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:43.410
<v Speaker 3>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to be a good neighbor</v>

390
00:17:43.411 --> 00:17:47.060
<v Speaker 3>and not good enough white man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See any business owner.</v>

391
00:17:47.061 --> 00:17:49.720
<v Speaker 3>Here's board of equalization and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>freaking like,</v>

392
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:51.540
<v Speaker 1>they're laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're laughing,</v>

393
00:17:51.541 --> 00:17:54.120
<v Speaker 1>but they're also afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is equalization mean?</v>

394
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.120
<v Speaker 1>It would be a word that seems like they</v>
<v Speaker 1>made that word up.</v>

395
00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Now that I think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of fucked up that it's</v>

396
00:17:59.971 --> 00:18:02.510
<v Speaker 1>called equalization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're going to take the businesses</v>

397
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.820
<v Speaker 1>money and give it to y'all here so we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can all get equalized.</v>

398
00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.490
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't work.</v>

399
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:09.721
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

400
00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:11.100
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are lazy.</v>

401
00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.770
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has got to be a way though.</v>

402
00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:19.030
<v Speaker 1>They think that a universal basic income</v>
<v Speaker 1>that giving people $13,000 though,</v>

403
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.040
<v Speaker 1>like giving everybody through some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael shermer actually just tweeted</v>

404
00:18:23.041 --> 00:18:25.710
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the really intelligent skeptic</v>

405
00:18:25.711 --> 00:18:26.720
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

406
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.850
<v Speaker 1>and they think giving people $13,000 a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

407
00:18:29.851 --> 00:18:32.460
<v Speaker 1>like giving it to everybody would reduce</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime,</v>

408
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.720
<v Speaker 1>would reduce poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would give people chAnces to pursue</v>

409
00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:39.960
<v Speaker 1>other things if they had the universal</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic income.</v>

410
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a really strange concept because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things that everybody</v>

411
00:18:43.531 --> 00:18:44.640
<v Speaker 1>has an ego reaction to.</v>

412
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.320
<v Speaker 1>I definitely did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard it and I was like,</v>

413
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:48.540
<v Speaker 1>get outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just give people money.</v>

414
00:18:48.541 --> 00:18:52.470
<v Speaker 1>People are too lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the more I read about it and the</v>

415
00:18:52.471 --> 00:18:57.471
<v Speaker 1>more I see people who are quite a bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>more educated than me on this subject,</v>

416
00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:01.380
<v Speaker 1>they think that it's possible that doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that would actually cost</v>

417
00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:06.381
<v Speaker 1>less money in the long run because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would start a cascade of positive events</v>

418
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.650
<v Speaker 1>that giving people enough money to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>by on right.</v>

419
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.430
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would start like a series of events</v>

420
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.560
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of these people's lives were</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>

421
00:19:16.561 --> 00:19:19.320
<v Speaker 1>would be taken care of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are insurmountable.</v>

422
00:19:19.321 --> 00:19:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it'll start some momentum in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive way and that you're going to</v>

423
00:19:23.761 --> 00:19:26.640
<v Speaker 1>deal with less crime and you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with less of violence.</v>

424
00:19:26.641 --> 00:19:30.750
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to deal with less need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deal with the problems and the</v>

425
00:19:30.751 --> 00:19:33.270
<v Speaker 1>financial repercussions of crime and</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

426
00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.090
<v Speaker 1>It'll overall cost less money to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

427
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm skeptical though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My knee,</v>

428
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.630
<v Speaker 1>my knee jerked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

429
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:43.140
<v Speaker 1>When I did mine did too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was first talking about it with my</v>

430
00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:45.840
<v Speaker 1>friend eddie wong from a vice from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>vice show.</v>

431
00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.630
<v Speaker 1>What's his fucking chose in world or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

432
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

433
00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.740
<v Speaker 1>but he brought It up and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why get the fuck out of here?</v>

434
00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:00.660
<v Speaker 1>And then when I realized that there were</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people bringing this up,</v>

435
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.291
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

436
00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:03.330
<v Speaker 1>well let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me put my knee down</v>

437
00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.270
<v Speaker 1>with dj,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's put,</v>

438
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.850
<v Speaker 1>let me just open mindedly look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

439
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.690
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

440
00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:10.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the port,</v>

441
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:15.120
<v Speaker 1>like if you give people money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just going to be lazy and then</v>

442
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.640
<v Speaker 1>everything going to get anything done</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to deal with a bunch of</v>

443
00:20:17.641 --> 00:20:18.474
<v Speaker 1>lazy people.</v>

444
00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Plateau effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

445
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:23.310
<v Speaker 1>So like the worst fears that people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're worried about welfare,</v>

446
00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:26.730
<v Speaker 1>that you create a welfare environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people get accustomed to that and</v>

447
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.920
<v Speaker 1>they have no ambition and nothing ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets done.</v>

448
00:20:28.921 --> 00:20:32.220
<v Speaker 1>It's Almost a way to poison people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ambition is to give them money.</v>

449
00:20:32.221 --> 00:20:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Like Switzerland just had thIs thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they were going to give everybody,</v>

450
00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.580
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like $2,500 a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like free income.</v>

451
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:46.410
<v Speaker 1>And then hope that that would pay for</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone to be like a,</v>

452
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.990
<v Speaker 1>just a little bump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they would keep their jobs and stuff</v>

453
00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:52.150
<v Speaker 1>like that and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're shitty jobs would feel a little</v>

454
00:20:52.151 --> 00:20:53.880
<v Speaker 1>bit better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but theN they,</v>

455
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they denied it and yeah,</v>

456
00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.180
<v Speaker 1>it didn't pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that would be interesting.</v>

457
00:20:58.181 --> 00:21:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Everybody getting free income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>

458
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.810
<v Speaker 1>that's the idea behind this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland is a very inclusive country</v>

459
00:21:04.811 --> 00:21:07.990
<v Speaker 1>where everyone serves in the military</v>
<v Speaker 1>and has To participate.</v>

460
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.590
<v Speaker 1>That would be a good place to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this because America is</v>

461
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.470
<v Speaker 1>obviously a little bit more loosey</v>
<v Speaker 1>goosey with that kind of shit.</v>

462
00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.650
<v Speaker 1>We gotta spread that we had dollar</v>
<v Speaker 1>bills.</v>

463
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Y'all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much,</v>

464
00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.000
<v Speaker 1>how big is Switzerland?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how many people live there?</v>

465
00:21:22.001 --> 00:21:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be like given universal basic</v>

466
00:21:24.191 --> 00:21:26.410
<v Speaker 1>income to la,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

467
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:29.180
<v Speaker 1>really that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean those are the arguments for like</v>

468
00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.080
<v Speaker 1>universal healthcare and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it works in Finland.</v>

469
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:36.660
<v Speaker 1>Well Finland is like the size of long</v>
<v Speaker 1>island and westchester county one.</v>

470
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean just think about like the stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>that flies in Canada,</v>

471
00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

472
00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Canada has a totally different country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're connected to us but they're</v>

473
00:21:45.281 --> 00:21:48.310
<v Speaker 1>fucking completely different and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>

474
00:21:48.311 --> 00:21:50.980
<v Speaker 1>So if anybody says it works for Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's only $30,</v>

475
00:21:50.981 --> 00:21:54.940
<v Speaker 1>million of that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a huge fucking country and there's</v>

476
00:21:54.941 --> 00:21:57.730
<v Speaker 1>only 30 million people and they're just</v>
<v Speaker 1>nicer.</v>

477
00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.070
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just nice if there's a canadian that</v>

478
00:22:00.071 --> 00:22:00.681
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you told it,</v>

479
00:22:00.681 --> 00:22:02.170
<v Speaker 1>you know it immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're nice.</v>

480
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:05.050
<v Speaker 1>They're like some of the nicest fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings on the planet.</v>

481
00:22:05.051 --> 00:22:07.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a one country that I wouldn't think</v>
<v Speaker 1>twice.</v>

482
00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.130
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't think twice about moving to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada.</v>

483
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're ahead of the curve on cannabis</v>

484
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.820
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

485
00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

486
00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Delivery is the only option in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

487
00:22:14.831 --> 00:22:16.690
<v Speaker 1>And it's government sanctioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

488
00:22:16.691 --> 00:22:20.230
<v Speaker 1>The government is essentially this new</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy that has gotten in.</v>

489
00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.790
<v Speaker 1>What's the new guy's name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the young guy.</v>

490
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.230
<v Speaker 1>The handsome fella.</v>

491
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:28.680
<v Speaker 1>I gotta think of the guy from dunes</v>
<v Speaker 1>burdens.</v>

492
00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.450
<v Speaker 1>The government is also behind their</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol sales also in,</v>

493
00:22:33.451 --> 00:22:35.680
<v Speaker 1>in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't buy liquor unless it's</v>

494
00:22:35.681 --> 00:22:40.681
<v Speaker 1>through the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not as a drug dealer in Canada,</v>

495
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda,</v>

496
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.130
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very,</v>

497
00:22:45.131 --> 00:22:49.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm very libertarian so I don't like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government involved wherever possible.</v>

498
00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's some interesting rulings about</v>

499
00:22:52.031 --> 00:22:53.420
<v Speaker 1>comedy up there too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

500
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:58.870
<v Speaker 1>there was one guy that got heckled by</v>
<v Speaker 1>some women in a nightclub in vancouver</v>

501
00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.100
<v Speaker 1>and apparently they were really drunk</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

502
00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.290
<v Speaker 1>things happen in comedy clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get crazy,</v>

503
00:23:05.291 --> 00:23:07.060
<v Speaker 1>they yell things out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're serving people drinks,</v>

504
00:23:07.061 --> 00:23:08.830
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna yell things out.</v>

505
00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.670
<v Speaker 1>So he was yelling things at them and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>said a bunch of rude stuff about them</v>

506
00:23:12.671 --> 00:23:16.270
<v Speaker 1>being lesbians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're homophobic stuff and they</v>

507
00:23:16.271 --> 00:23:21.271
<v Speaker 1>suit them and they won $15,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$15,000 going down his men would it once</v>

508
00:23:26.111 --> 00:23:28.420
<v Speaker 1>people start hurling insults at each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

509
00:23:28.421 --> 00:23:31.300
<v Speaker 1>like the women hurled insults at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian,</v>

510
00:23:31.301 --> 00:23:33.430
<v Speaker 1>the comedian hurled insults at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

511
00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:36.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who started it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be imperative to find</v>

512
00:23:36.851 --> 00:23:38.890
<v Speaker 1>out who started it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

513
00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that the guy was on stage doing</v>

514
00:23:41.771 --> 00:23:45.320
<v Speaker 1>stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're not supposed to be yelling.</v>

515
00:23:45.321 --> 00:23:48.260
<v Speaker 1>This isn't a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're talking to him,</v>

516
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:52.520
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless he's a crowd worker,</v>

517
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy that works crowds,</v>

518
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.320
<v Speaker 1>but I guarantee you most likely he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting interrupted.</v>

519
00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.050
<v Speaker 1>So he's trying to do is act for all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the room who's was getting</v>

520
00:24:00.051 --> 00:24:02.700
<v Speaker 1>interrupted and then it got ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

521
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:06.080
<v Speaker 1>And what's the answer to have people</v>
<v Speaker 1>sIgned waivers before they walk in the</v>

522
00:24:06.081 --> 00:24:07.570
<v Speaker 1>comedy clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's silly.</v>

523
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.530
<v Speaker 1>It's just you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't</v>

524
00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:16.820
<v Speaker 1>have a monetary reward for someone that</v>
<v Speaker 1>heckled.</v>

525
00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:21.500
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be able to extract money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A comedy club like that because you go</v>

526
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:22.880
<v Speaker 1>in trying to make it happen.</v>

527
00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Because I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

528
00:24:23.751 --> 00:24:26.030
<v Speaker 1>you go to a baseball game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get hit with a foul ball,</v>

529
00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:28.770
<v Speaker 1>you die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't sue anybody because it's kind</v>

530
00:24:28.771 --> 00:24:31.510
<v Speaker 1>of a given.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That dangerous shit is flying around.</v>

531
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Balls are fast and hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck baseball.</v>

532
00:24:33.831 --> 00:24:38.831
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that could happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you go to a comedy club comedy</v>

533
00:24:39.171 --> 00:24:40.850
<v Speaker 1>club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first rule is you're in the audience.</v>

534
00:24:40.851 --> 00:24:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second rule is let the comics say what</v>

535
00:24:44.061 --> 00:24:45.500
<v Speaker 1>he wants to say and you might get</v>
<v Speaker 1>offended.</v>

536
00:24:45.501 --> 00:24:47.210
<v Speaker 1>That's the chance you take going in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

537
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't want to stand up for the</v>

538
00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:52.430
<v Speaker 1>headquarters in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the only way that it could be</v>

539
00:24:52.431 --> 00:24:56.300
<v Speaker 1>different is if it's like rick ingram</v>
<v Speaker 1>works at crowd constantly,</v>

540
00:24:56.301 --> 00:24:58.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talks to people and if you have thin</v>

541
00:24:58.431 --> 00:25:00.200
<v Speaker 1>skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's hilarious.</v>

542
00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.750
<v Speaker 1>But if you have a thin skin he'll fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you,</v>

543
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:05.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Maybe you didn't want that.</v>

544
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.940
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you insult back and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

545
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:08.300
<v Speaker 1>rick knows how to handle stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

546
00:25:08.301 --> 00:25:10.580
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying if he's one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of comedians that,</v>

547
00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.320
<v Speaker 1>that works a crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cool,</v>

548
00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it could have been that he insulted</v>

549
00:25:14.541 --> 00:25:17.300
<v Speaker 1>them first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only time that I could see</v>

550
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.360
<v Speaker 1>where they would get pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From what I understand,</v>

551
00:25:20.361 --> 00:25:23.000
<v Speaker 1>they had been heckling all night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was according to his version of the</v>

552
00:25:23.001 --> 00:25:25.490
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it's not like people wait to</v>

553
00:25:25.491 --> 00:25:27.500
<v Speaker 1>hackle you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's a heckler.</v>

554
00:25:27.501 --> 00:25:30.140
<v Speaker 1>If there's four comedians and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>night and the fourth guy goes up,</v>

555
00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.940
<v Speaker 1>that person's probably been tackling all</v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

556
00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Right now they're just drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or does it scare you though?</v>

557
00:25:36.381 --> 00:25:38.060
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like doing material in Canada in the</v>

558
00:25:38.061 --> 00:25:40.130
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it gets heated with like you and a</v>

559
00:25:40.131 --> 00:25:41.300
<v Speaker 1>heckler or you gonna be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

560
00:25:41.301 --> 00:25:43.620
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I better step back a little before I</v>

561
00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:47.560
<v Speaker 1>call her this and that humanness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of,</v>

562
00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.300
<v Speaker 1>that kind of opens the door for this to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to like,</v>

563
00:25:50.301 --> 00:25:51.740
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're allowed to sue if this,</v>

564
00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.200
<v Speaker 1>if the comedian is mean to me.</v>

565
00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:54.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>

566
00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.610
<v Speaker 1>it's a dangerous precedent to set and</v>
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>

567
00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:00.440
<v Speaker 1>does not make me comfortable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully I'll never have to deal with</v>

568
00:26:00.441 --> 00:26:02.770
<v Speaker 1>it when I'm up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what about though?</v>

569
00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:07.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean there is like makes new orleans</v>
<v Speaker 1>look like blame like provo when she was</v>

570
00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.650
<v Speaker 1>a beautiful town too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love performing there.</v>

571
00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I find crowds and Canada to be really</v>
<v Speaker 1>polite.</v>

572
00:26:14.751 --> 00:26:16.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've had some headquarters in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

573
00:26:16.191 --> 00:26:19.610
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have hecklers when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get people drunk.</v>

574
00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:23.300
<v Speaker 1>They're going gonna fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the only thing you could do is</v>

575
00:26:23.301 --> 00:26:26.600
<v Speaker 1>probably like they're doing in South</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carolina.</v>

576
00:26:26.601 --> 00:26:30.080
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to boycott it to make some kind</v>

577

<v Speaker 1>of change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>how they're boycotting South Carolina.</v>

579
00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:38.320
<v Speaker 1>One's he caught going to vancouver</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of this one room that.</v>

580
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:38.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

581
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:41.120
<v Speaker 1>The loophole was at the end of heckling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could just say,</v>

582
00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:41.983
<v Speaker 1>just kidding.</v>

583
00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:48.840
<v Speaker 6>You're like a fucking do the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I know what I'll do with a plane</v>

584
00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:50.940
<v Speaker 6>crashes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll just jump out at the last second.</v>

585
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.640
<v Speaker 6>Right before it hits the ground at the</v>
<v Speaker 6>end goal.</v>

586
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.380
<v Speaker 6>Allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

587
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:59.910
<v Speaker 6>You don't understand physics?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not that I do,</v>

588
00:26:59.911 --> 00:27:01.140
<v Speaker 6>but yeah.</v>

589
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:03.151
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

590
00:27:03.151 --> 00:27:05.630
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely not a good rule.</v>

591
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Then the fact that he lost his very</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous for.</v>

592
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another one going on right now.</v>

593
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:11.551
<v Speaker 1>We're in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

594
00:27:11.551 --> 00:27:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Another guy got in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is his name?</v>

595
00:27:15.091 --> 00:27:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Chris?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something or other is a comic from</v>

596
00:27:17.281 --> 00:27:19.500
<v Speaker 1>montreal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he speaks both languages.</v>

597
00:27:19.501 --> 00:27:22.830
<v Speaker 1>I think he speaks french and english.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris wade.</v>

598
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Is that his name you see there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the pesky first</v>

599
00:27:25.831 --> 00:27:27.160
<v Speaker 1>amendment to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

600
00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is what happened with this</v>

601
00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:30.810
<v Speaker 1>gentleman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find out this dude's name is a dude</v>

602
00:27:30.811 --> 00:27:35.070
<v Speaker 1>who's getting sued because there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sick kid and he made a joke about it.</v>

603
00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.850
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the joke was,</v>

604
00:27:38.851 --> 00:27:40.330
<v Speaker 1>it was something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to paraphrase it.</v>

605
00:27:40.331 --> 00:27:43.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna do a shitty job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people donated money</v>

606
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:48.330
<v Speaker 1>because this kid was dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then he lived for like several years</v>

607
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.550
<v Speaker 1>and then the joke was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

608
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't even sick or something like</v>

609
00:27:52.561 --> 00:27:54.090
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike ward.</v>

610
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.800
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

611
00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.480
<v Speaker 1>what is the joke?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull up.</v>

612
00:27:57.481 --> 00:28:02.481
<v Speaker 1>Pull up the joke so we could analyze it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he say?</v>

613
00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid.</v>

614
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.090
<v Speaker 1>What was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it say what the joke?</v>

615
00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:11.010
<v Speaker 1>The joke is,</v>

616
00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.633
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

617
00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:17.540
<v Speaker 1>a kid's got a serious illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a snapchat filter.</v>

618
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:20.083
<v Speaker 7>Hmm.</v>

619
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking for whatever the joke was.</v>

620
00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.930
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it show the actual joke or.</v>

621
00:28:26.931 --> 00:28:27.930
<v Speaker 1>No?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

622
00:28:27.931 --> 00:28:28.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

623
00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it might've been too offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing is in this room where</v>

624
00:28:33.441 --> 00:28:34.760
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no rules.</v>

625
00:28:34.761 --> 00:28:36.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid to even make a comment on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

626
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.870
<v Speaker 1>That's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could play the joke.</v>

627
00:28:38.871 --> 00:28:42.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to smirk this.</v>

628
00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:46.790
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of comedians you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really enjoy saying ridiculous shit</v>

629
00:28:46.791 --> 00:28:50.960
<v Speaker 1>that they don't really mean because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny because it's so shocking.</v>

630
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous that it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real danger in pretending that</v>

631
00:28:54.561 --> 00:28:59.561
<v Speaker 1>those guys are just speaking their</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute mind and like giving affidavits</v>

632
00:28:59.601 --> 00:29:04.601
<v Speaker 1>and court relaying incidents with a cold</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard disengagement from the facts.</v>

633
00:29:05.481 --> 00:29:08.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are comedians trying to say fucked</v>

634
00:29:08.181 --> 00:29:11.910
<v Speaker 1>up shit that they don't really mean and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why it's funny,</v>

635
00:29:11.911 --> 00:29:14.000
<v Speaker 1>it's because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't really mean it and they're</v>

636
00:29:14.001 --> 00:29:15.500
<v Speaker 1>saying it and it's ridiculous.</v>

637
00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Like briAn holtzman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

638
00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.390
<v Speaker 1>He's a great example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect example.</v>

639
00:29:20.391 --> 00:29:24.200
<v Speaker 1>He's one of my favorite comedians ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's so ridiculous.</v>

640
00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.800
<v Speaker 1>He says thinGs that I don't want to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>away any of his material,</v>

641
00:29:27.801 --> 00:29:30.140
<v Speaker 1>but he says things that he absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>does not mean.</v>

642
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he says it in this character and</v>

643
00:29:32.631 --> 00:29:37.190
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a landmine for anybody looking</v>

644
00:29:37.191 --> 00:29:42.191
<v Speaker 1>to point to a guy's performance on stage</v>
<v Speaker 1>and try to that somehow or another,</v>

645
00:29:42.641 --> 00:29:45.040
<v Speaker 1>what he's doing is what he really means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

646
00:29:45.041 --> 00:29:50.041
<v Speaker 1>And if you see audience members getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>angry at it or or something that it's</v>

647
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.680
<v Speaker 1>hard to imagine how they can't see that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a character.</v>

648
00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

649
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:57.770
<v Speaker 1>that's not hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a set material.</v>

650
00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:01.690
<v Speaker 1>Maybe think that we're too close to it</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly because I think if someone</v>

651
00:30:01.691 --> 00:30:03.970
<v Speaker 1>didn't know it might take them a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

652
00:30:03.971 --> 00:30:06.670
<v Speaker 1>like say if you're not a savvy comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>

653
00:30:06.671 --> 00:30:10.570
<v Speaker 1>regular type person or someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoys common and a regular basis,</v>

654
00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:14.170
<v Speaker 1>you could go and watch holtzman and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on here?</v>

655
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.940
<v Speaker 1>And that might be what the fuck is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on here?</v>

656
00:30:15.941 --> 00:30:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Might last 10 minutes before you catch</v>
<v Speaker 1>on like that.</v>

657
00:30:19.481 --> 00:30:21.310
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he'll let you in on it and he'll</v>

658
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:25.720
<v Speaker 1>smirk and Joke in between his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his ramblings.</v>

659
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:30.370
<v Speaker 1>But I could see people not getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the thing.</v>

660
00:30:30.371 --> 00:30:33.380
<v Speaker 1>He'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll jerk and I'll make the smirk and</v>

661
00:30:33.381 --> 00:30:35.650
<v Speaker 1>be in between things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the people who are already mad,</v>

662
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.440
<v Speaker 1>they skip over that part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

663
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.220
<v Speaker 1>They just think he's a crazy person.</v>

664
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.990
<v Speaker 3>He never justifies though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I mean,</v>

665
00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.700
<v Speaker 3>I think I've seen in your special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say a lot of this is just comedy</v>

666
00:30:45.701 --> 00:30:46.534
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

667
00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:48.090
<v Speaker 3>but does he ever say no?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

668
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.943
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't.</v>

669
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.120
<v Speaker 3>He did a 15 minute version of his gay</v>
<v Speaker 3>son the other day.</v>

670
00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.610
<v Speaker 3>I have never seen a full 15 minute</v>
<v Speaker 3>version of that.</v>

671
00:30:56.750 --> 00:31:00.580
<v Speaker 3>It was beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That could be a comedy special.</v>

672
00:31:00.581 --> 00:31:01.414
<v Speaker 3>Just that.</v>

673
00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the best examPle of his bits</v>

674
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:08.060
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as like the most fucked up thing</v>

675
00:31:08.061 --> 00:31:12.830
<v Speaker 1>you could imagine like in joke form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's obviously not true.</v>

676
00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:17.450
<v Speaker 1>It's so preposterous to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

677
00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.530
<v Speaker 1>It's funny and it could offend people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

678
00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:23.580
<v Speaker 1>and if it does to live in a punitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>society that,</v>

679
00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.370
<v Speaker 1>that he can't perform being an artist</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perform his art because he has to</v>

680
00:31:28.371 --> 00:31:32.830
<v Speaker 1>worry about being sued is already not</v>
<v Speaker 1>making enough money to be sued for no.</v>

681
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>

682
00:31:34.341 --> 00:31:39.341
<v Speaker 1>You have the right to be offended you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people don't have to agree with your</v>

683
00:31:40.581 --> 00:31:43.640
<v Speaker 1>opinions on things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to see art,</v>

684
00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.720
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you think stand up,</v>

685
00:31:45.721 --> 00:31:47.720
<v Speaker 1>comedy is art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're creating it,</v>

686
00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:48.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're creating that.</v>

687
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:52.790
<v Speaker 1>This guy is performing art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You either like it or you don't like it,</v>

688
00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:55.820
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the right to interrupt</v>

689
00:31:55.821 --> 00:31:56.000
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

690
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.700
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just leave that sort of polite person</v>

691
00:31:58.701 --> 00:32:00.980
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some stuff that I didn't like</v>

692
00:32:00.981 --> 00:32:03.680
<v Speaker 1>and I left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten to see a movie and I didn't</v>

693
00:32:03.681 --> 00:32:04.760
<v Speaker 1>like it and I left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

694
00:32:04.761 --> 00:32:08.120
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to interrupt it for everybody else</v>

695
00:32:08.121 --> 00:32:09.590
<v Speaker 1>that's watching the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

696
00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:12.100
<v Speaker 1>that's a piece of shit move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>

697
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.290
<v Speaker 1>you rewarding someone who did a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit move.</v>

698
00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:17.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

699
00:32:17.651 --> 00:32:21.350
<v Speaker 1>a good person doesn't heckle me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that people who were hecklers</v>

700
00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:26.090
<v Speaker 1>are bad people but they're drunk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up and that makes them a pain.</v>

701
00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:26.960
<v Speaker 1>The ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

702
00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:29.420
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of drunk fucked up people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually good people.</v>

703
00:32:29.421 --> 00:32:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you reward that kind of</v>

704
00:32:32.211 --> 00:32:35.930
<v Speaker 1>behavior like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you could say that you think that</v>

705
00:32:35.931 --> 00:32:39.020
<v Speaker 1>the comedians not funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say don't ever go see him.</v>

706
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Could cast judge</v>

707
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.940
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do whatever the fuck you want.</v>

708
00:32:40.941 --> 00:32:45.380
<v Speaker 3>But to say he owes her $15,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's like,</v>

709
00:32:45.381 --> 00:32:47.460
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is the retard in charge?</v>

710
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:50.900
<v Speaker 3>Who the who the fuck said yes to this</v>
<v Speaker 3>judge?</v>

711
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.630
<v Speaker 3>Is this a group of people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I sit down with you,</v>

712
00:32:53.631 --> 00:32:56.870
<v Speaker 3>fucks and talk to you and try to figure</v>
<v Speaker 3>out what the fuck is going on in your</v>

713
00:32:56.871 --> 00:32:58.080
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

714
00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.950
<v Speaker 3>You can charge him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ha.</v>

715
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:05.990
<v Speaker 3>What's the punitive rule for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the labeling that you know you have</v>

716
00:33:06.621 --> 00:33:09.830
<v Speaker 3>to put the cancer and that's proposition</v>
<v Speaker 3>65.</v>

717
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:12.650
<v Speaker 3>You have to label all marijuana products</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this,</v>

718
00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:17.780
<v Speaker 3>with this warning label that says this</v>
<v Speaker 3>product is known to contain chemicals</v>

719
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:20.930
<v Speaker 3>that may cause cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So every,</v>

720
00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:26.020
<v Speaker 3>even though cannabis is knowing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>treat cancer is known to not proven to,</v>

721
00:33:26.901 --> 00:33:29.600
<v Speaker 3>but known to cause we can't do the right</v>
<v Speaker 3>research search.</v>

722
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:32.030
<v Speaker 3>Every piece of cannabis has to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

723
00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:37.080
<v Speaker 3>this label on it or else you can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>fined for not having the label.</v>

724
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:38.540
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>punitive society.</v>

725
00:33:38.541 --> 00:33:41.060
<v Speaker 3>And we got sued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got sued for not having the labeling</v>

726
00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:45.980
<v Speaker 3>on our packaging even though we did so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they decided to put a lawsuit against</v>

727
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.910
<v Speaker 3>400,</v>
<v Speaker 3>800,</v>

728
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:49.030
<v Speaker 3>800,</v>
<v Speaker 3>800.</v>

729
00:33:49.031 --> 00:33:51.160
<v Speaker 3>It just went through weedmaps and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>see what everybody.</v>

730
00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.093
<v Speaker 3>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

731
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.810
<v Speaker 3>they just did it just to try to scrap</v>
<v Speaker 3>some money out of you.</v>

732
00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:57.590
<v Speaker 3>They said we'll make this go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pace the settlement will make it go</v>

733
00:33:57.591 --> 00:33:58.610
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

734
00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:03.320
<v Speaker 3>And this is what this person has done to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds and hundreds of businesses.</v>

735
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:07.810
<v Speaker 3>That's how they make their living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she sued us in 2014 control.</v>

736
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.710
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

737
00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.460
<v Speaker 3>And products have it on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>

738
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.320
<v Speaker 3>we were sued without even one burden of</v>
<v Speaker 3>proof because when we were like,</v>

739
00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.810
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything has it on.</v>

740
00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:22.990
<v Speaker 3>So did they just say the lawsuits</v>
<v Speaker 3>invalid or know enough to go through</v>

741
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.230
<v Speaker 3>with it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we still got to go through it</v>

742
00:34:24.231 --> 00:34:27.350
<v Speaker 3>because you can go through with it</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever you were filing right now and</v>

743
00:34:27.351 --> 00:34:31.550
<v Speaker 3>after it's filed then I got to file a</v>
<v Speaker 3>complaint with the bar and do all this</v>

744
00:34:31.551 --> 00:34:34.370
<v Speaker 3>bullshit because anybody can sue anybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

745
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:37.030
<v Speaker 3>And it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really hurts businesses that hurts good</v>

746
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.140
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how much did they want to settle?</v>

747
00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.790
<v Speaker 3>About $20,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>

748
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.640
<v Speaker 3>So fucking criminals stealing money from</v>
<v Speaker 3>people from dispensary because they</v>

749
00:34:46.641 --> 00:34:50.330
<v Speaker 3>think they have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But where they made their money is a on.</v>

750
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:53.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean every place has to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you walk into target,</v>

751
00:34:53.421 --> 00:34:57.110
<v Speaker 3>you walk into walmart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all have to have have this thing</v>

752
00:34:57.111 --> 00:34:59.750
<v Speaker 3>because anything that has plastics in it</v>
<v Speaker 3>or anything.</v>

753
00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see that sign everywhere now.</v>

754
00:35:01.401 --> 00:35:03.860
<v Speaker 3>Once you get sued,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're everywhere.</v>

755
00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.880
<v Speaker 3>You see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that that's the law you got to have</v>

756
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.900
<v Speaker 3>posted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like you'd never hear the word</v>

757
00:35:08.901 --> 00:35:10.530
<v Speaker 3>lesbian in vancouver again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's that.</v>

758
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.990
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the glory days are done.</v>

759
00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:18.800
<v Speaker 3>Is that what he yelled a lesbian?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he said.</v>

760
00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:22.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've heard worse so.</v>

761
00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:27.850
<v Speaker 3>So it's too litigious of our society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So companies,</v>

762
00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.540
<v Speaker 3>bigger companies don't just settle</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's easier to just settle.</v>

763
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:37.470
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a smaller companies I guess they think</v>

764
00:35:37.471 --> 00:35:38.160
<v Speaker 3>because marijuana,</v>

765
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.690
<v Speaker 5>you just have so much money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

766
00:35:39.691 --> 00:35:44.340
<v Speaker 5>our tax burden is almost 70 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no real money In it when you're</v>

767
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:49.380
<v Speaker 5>doing things by the book and they just</v>
<v Speaker 5>passed another 15 percent sales tax on</v>

768
00:35:49.381 --> 00:35:52.560
<v Speaker 5>top of marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You all in California just got passed</v>

769
00:35:52.561 --> 00:35:54.540
<v Speaker 5>this week through the senate and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>assembly.</v>

770
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:57.990
<v Speaker 5>The governor signs that another 15</v>
<v Speaker 5>percent tax is coming our way and that</v>

771
00:35:57.991 --> 00:35:59.730
<v Speaker 5>gets passed to the consumer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

772
00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:03.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm on top of the sales tax on top of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the city tax on top of the excise tax</v>

773
00:36:03.781 --> 00:36:07.080
<v Speaker 5>and some of the cities and counties in</v>
<v Speaker 5>California having another,</v>

774
00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:10.290
<v Speaker 5>another 10 or 15 percent on top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're also texting the growers in our</v>

775
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:14.310
<v Speaker 5>office so they're taxing anything that</v>
<v Speaker 5>has anything to do with what you get as</v>

776
00:36:14.311 --> 00:36:16.620
<v Speaker 5>a final product.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If that's the case,</v>

777
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.600
<v Speaker 5>why would they be trying to stifle</v>
<v Speaker 5>business?</v>

778
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.030
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't they want to promote business</v>
<v Speaker 5>because business is going to give them</v>

779
00:36:21.031 --> 00:36:24.120
<v Speaker 5>more tax revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the California.</v>

780
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:25.760
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's because,</v>

781
00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:30.090
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of it is because of law</v>
<v Speaker 5>enforcement unions and and not just</v>

782
00:36:30.091 --> 00:36:32.340
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but prison guard unions and all these.</v>

783
00:36:32.341 --> 00:36:37.080
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of unions that put</v>
<v Speaker 5>pressure on different politicians to try</v>

784
00:36:37.081 --> 00:36:41.730
<v Speaker 5>to keep the laws in place or to make</v>
<v Speaker 5>them even stricter because they want</v>

785
00:36:41.731 --> 00:36:44.310
<v Speaker 5>more people to get arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 5>privatized prisons,</v>

786
00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:48.120
<v Speaker 5>subsidized presence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that is such a dark concept that this</v>

787
00:36:48.121 --> 00:36:49.880
<v Speaker 5>is something that we're really dealing</v>
<v Speaker 5>with it.</v>

788
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.950
<v Speaker 5>We really are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the problem is the penalties for the</v>

789
00:36:52.951 --> 00:36:55.680
<v Speaker 5>users,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like having a joint is so very small,</v>

790
00:36:55.681 --> 00:36:58.470
<v Speaker 5>but the penalties for the business for</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing it the wrong way are huge.</v>

791
00:36:58.471 --> 00:37:02.060
<v Speaker 5>Like our business is being crushed right</v>
<v Speaker 5>now over a stupid zoning suit.</v>

792
00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.010
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there's this big gap betWeen the</v>

793
00:37:05.011 --> 00:37:09.240
<v Speaker 5>business penalty and the consumer</v>
<v Speaker 5>penalty so that the business has no</v>

794
00:37:09.241 --> 00:37:11.310
<v Speaker 5>incentive really to do it the right way.</v>

795
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:14.880
<v Speaker 5>So because the consumer what you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to go into a shop and ask them,</v>

796
00:37:14.881 --> 00:37:16.620
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you pay your people on the books?</v>

797
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.540
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can I see your compliancy packet?</v>

798
00:37:18.541 --> 00:37:20.360
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just go $40 a month.</v>

799
00:37:20.361 --> 00:37:21.900
<v Speaker 5>I love that oj.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm buying it,</v>

800
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.710
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So with all these taxes that $40 eight,</v>

801
00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.900
<v Speaker 5>it's got to go to $100.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are we going to pay that or we just</v>

802
00:37:27.901 --> 00:37:31.650
<v Speaker 5>going to go and call our dealer or</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoever that we've been using for 20</v>

803
00:37:31.651 --> 00:37:32.870
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's gonna.</v>

804
00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.600
<v Speaker 5>It's just gonna make the black market</v>
<v Speaker 5>even a broader.</v>

805
00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.150
<v Speaker 5>Well that's an issue that they've had in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Colorado for sure,</v>

806
00:37:39.151 --> 00:37:42.450
<v Speaker 5>but people are happy to pay the taxes</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they liked the fact that it's</v>

807
00:37:42.451 --> 00:37:44.490
<v Speaker 5>free.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the thing is free.</v>

808
00:37:44.491 --> 00:37:47.400
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can go and you can buy pot.</v>

809
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:49.260
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to have any kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>license,</v>

810
00:37:49.261 --> 00:37:51.900
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to any and you can just</v>
<v Speaker 5>go do it and it's working.</v>

811
00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:55.800
<v Speaker 5>So 39 percent is what they have to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like recreational and medical is much</v>

812
00:37:55.801 --> 00:37:57.690
<v Speaker 5>less,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people just pay it,</v>

813
00:37:57.930 --> 00:37:59.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not happy about it,</v>

814
00:37:59.281 --> 00:38:01.930
<v Speaker 5>but regulation is what we want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We just want to follow.</v>

815
00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:05.670
<v Speaker 5>We just want the path to the way to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>this the correct way.</v>

816
00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.400
<v Speaker 5>Just make it fair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's see what's going on in denver</v>

817
00:38:08.401 --> 00:38:12.990
<v Speaker 5>should be the shining light for the rest</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the states because what they've done</v>

818
00:38:12.991 --> 00:38:13.970
<v Speaker 5>is they've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've,</v>

819
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:18.180
<v Speaker 5>they've made money like they have so</v>
<v Speaker 5>much fucking money from tax revenue.</v>

820
00:38:18.181 --> 00:38:22.200
<v Speaker 5>They made more money from tax revenue</v>
<v Speaker 5>than they did from alcohol taxes.</v>

821
00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:26.550
<v Speaker 5>So last year Colorado takes in</v>
<v Speaker 5>$40,000,000 in tax revenue for cannabis.</v>

822
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:30.270
<v Speaker 5>California takes in $40 million dollars</v>
<v Speaker 5>in tax revenue from cannabis.</v>

823
00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:35.010
<v Speaker 5>We have 30 million people in this state</v>
<v Speaker 5>compared to colorado's,</v>

824
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:35.741
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Five,</v>

825
00:38:35.741 --> 00:38:38.260
<v Speaker 5>6 million.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not collecting the taxes here,</v>

826
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:42.190
<v Speaker 5>so if the companies are not following</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rules as they stand,</v>

827
00:38:42.191 --> 00:38:46.330
<v Speaker 5>why we've thrown all these new rules at</v>
<v Speaker 5>them and setting up these monopolies</v>

828
00:38:46.331 --> 00:38:49.750
<v Speaker 5>like here in la with the monopoly</v>
<v Speaker 5>stifling good businesses,</v>

829
00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.030
<v Speaker 5>this doesn't help us and it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>help.</v>

830
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:54.190
<v Speaker 5>The consumer either doesn't make any</v>
<v Speaker 5>sense.</v>

831
00:38:54.191 --> 00:38:55.220
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's knowledge.</v>

832
00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:58.150
<v Speaker 5>It would be dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like if you get more pot out</v>

833
00:38:58.151 --> 00:39:00.340
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's going to flood the streets and the</v>

834
00:39:00.341 --> 00:39:01.870
<v Speaker 5>people are going to jump from the</v>
<v Speaker 5>building.</v>

835
00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:04.310
<v Speaker 2>It's actually less dangerous or that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've.</v>

836
00:39:04.311 --> 00:39:07.910
<v Speaker 2>We've proven that and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why we're invited over and over</v>

837
00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:13.060
<v Speaker 2>to places like the board of equalization</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to other places like oakland.</v>

838
00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.670
<v Speaker 2>The city of oakland wants to follow our</v>
<v Speaker 2>delivery model.</v>

839
00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:20.270
<v Speaker 2>It's because the way we do things</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually creates less,</v>

840
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:23.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less crime,</v>

841
00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.320
<v Speaker 2>less opportunity for crime because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

842
00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.790
<v Speaker 2>we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in your living room,</v>

843
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know who you are,</v>

844
00:39:30.381 --> 00:39:31.820
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sent in your documents.</v>

845
00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:34.470
<v Speaker 2>We know you live at that address.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know you are.</v>

846
00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.340
<v Speaker 2>I went to a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know everything matches,</v>

847
00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:42.520
<v Speaker 2>so no one sees me walk in or out of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>place with a commodity that that's more</v>

848
00:39:43.011 --> 00:39:45.680
<v Speaker 2>expensive than diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when,</v>

849
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:47.810
<v Speaker 2>when you're looking at a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a dispensary,</v>

850
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:49.640
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people are walking in and out of</v>

851
00:39:49.641 --> 00:39:51.410
<v Speaker 2>there with duffle bags,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think's in those duffle</v>

852
00:39:51.411 --> 00:39:53.360
<v Speaker 2>bags?</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy to,</v>

853
00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:54.620
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

854
00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.450
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for crime that happened because it's</v>

855
00:39:56.451 --> 00:39:57.230
<v Speaker 2>visible.</v>

856
00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:59.900
<v Speaker 5>Done over 200,000 deliveries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>zero salts,</v>

857
00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:02.000
<v Speaker 5>zero robberies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>zero complaints.</v>

858
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.920
<v Speaker 5>Knock on wood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bitch.</v>

859
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:03.763
<v Speaker 5>That's great.</v>

860
00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.340
<v Speaker 2>I will just let that go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know that</v>

861
00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:14.870
<v Speaker 2>that's an importance to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is because we are very thoughtful</v>

862
00:40:14.871 --> 00:40:17.630
<v Speaker 2>about how we go about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

863
00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.930
<v Speaker 2>when you take a look at business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making sure the person is who they are.</v>

864
00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.850
<v Speaker 2>We do a google search on every single</v>
<v Speaker 2>patient.</v>

865
00:40:22.851 --> 00:40:27.851
<v Speaker 2>We turn down as many patients as we</v>
<v Speaker 2>would take maybe even more just to make</v>

866
00:40:28.881 --> 00:40:31.340
<v Speaker 2>sure they are who they say and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

867
00:40:31.341 --> 00:40:32.410
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

868
00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:37.420
<v Speaker 2>background of easy background check</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't pull up anything that says we</v>

869
00:40:37.911 --> 00:40:40.070
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't work with someone like that.</v>

870
00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:42.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pedophiles apparently love weed too,</v>

871
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:47.370
<v Speaker 5>but we don't love pedophile so we don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>let them also like milk know what the</v>

872
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:52.540
<v Speaker 5>fuck are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So connecting marijuana with crime.</v>

873
00:40:52.541 --> 00:40:54.430
<v Speaker 5>So stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

874
00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:59.440
<v Speaker 5>there's no facts to back it up anymore</v>
<v Speaker 5>just because just because some people</v>

875
00:40:59.441 --> 00:41:02.800
<v Speaker 5>who use it are criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't mean it's causing</v>

876
00:41:02.801 --> 00:41:05.410
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's no rationale for any of this.</v>

877
00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.290
<v Speaker 5>And you're fighting against the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 5>tax revenue.</v>

878
00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:11.020
<v Speaker 5>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're holding back revenue because</v>

879
00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:12.810
<v Speaker 5>there a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it was,</v>

880
00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:15.010
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of people that are on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fence.</v>

881
00:41:15.011 --> 00:41:16.930
<v Speaker 5>Like man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think about opening up a pot store,</v>

882
00:41:16.931 --> 00:41:18.170
<v Speaker 5>but fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

883
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:20.510
<v Speaker 5>would have jeb bush winds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

884
00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:22.000
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of people that think like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

885
00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:26.530
<v Speaker 5>Those people are not going to go in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if it becomes completely free and</v>

886
00:41:26.531 --> 00:41:28.570
<v Speaker 5>legal the way up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

887
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.460
<v Speaker 5>blue jeans store would be blue jeans.</v>

888
00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.293
<v Speaker 5>One of my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my grandma</v>

889
00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:37.960
<v Speaker 5>that I was trying for a reference</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything which is that if that happens,</v>

890
00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.790
<v Speaker 5>store's going to open up everywhere and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the money's going to be crazy.</v>

891
00:41:40.791 --> 00:41:42.410
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be a new economy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

892
00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:44.600
<v Speaker 5>it's still very possible with all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>people here.</v>

893
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:46.130
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll still have to follow</v>

894
00:41:46.131 --> 00:41:47.660
<v Speaker 5>regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

895
00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.970
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's already billions on the books.</v>

896
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.470
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they should follow regulations because I</v>

897
00:41:51.471 --> 00:41:53.150
<v Speaker 5>don't think that should be available to</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>

898
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:56.960
<v Speaker 5>I think when you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially like this kind of fucking pop</v>

899
00:41:56.961 --> 00:41:59.840
<v Speaker 5>they have here in la,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you imagine if you were a six year old</v>

900
00:41:59.841 --> 00:42:01.520
<v Speaker 5>kid in detroit and you got a hold of</v>
<v Speaker 5>this shit.</v>

901
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:03.590
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

902
00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.460
<v Speaker 5>it'S not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Six year olds are not ready for this.</v>

903
00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:07.640
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was definitely.</v>

904
00:42:07.641 --> 00:42:09.260
<v Speaker 5>You should definitely come of age.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

905
00:42:09.261 --> 00:42:12.080
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what that age is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we would have to decide as a</v>

906
00:42:12.081 --> 00:42:15.800
<v Speaker 5>society how old someone should be before</v>
<v Speaker 5>they start drinking,</v>

907
00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:19.760
<v Speaker 5>how it mean there's a lot of countries</v>
<v Speaker 5>that let kids drink like responsibly</v>

908
00:42:19.761 --> 00:42:24.020
<v Speaker 5>with their parents when they're much</v>
<v Speaker 5>younger than 21 and they have less</v>

909
00:42:24.021 --> 00:42:27.980
<v Speaker 5>incidents per capita of alcoholism than</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the countries that are more</v>

910
00:42:27.981 --> 00:42:28.820
<v Speaker 5>restrictive about it.</v>

911
00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.440
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know who's right or who's</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong.</v>

912
00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:31.970
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know americans,</v>

913
00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.880
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's things that work other places,</v>

914
00:42:34.881 --> 00:42:36.320
<v Speaker 5>like we said before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't work here.</v>

915
00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.870
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember going to Italy as a 16 year</v>

916
00:42:38.871 --> 00:42:42.410
<v Speaker 5>old school and the first thing we did</v>
<v Speaker 5>was run to like a bodega and buy beer</v>

917
00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:45.050
<v Speaker 5>because you could.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because we were amerIcan kids and were</v>

918
00:42:45.051 --> 00:42:48.860
<v Speaker 5>dicks and you can have beer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we didn't grow up responsibly so we</v>

919
00:42:48.861 --> 00:42:51.860
<v Speaker 5>weren't acting responsibly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'd have to shift the whole way.</v>

920
00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:54.110
<v Speaker 5>Our culture is to make those things</v>
<v Speaker 5>work.</v>

921
00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.120
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I don't know how to do that,</v>

922
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:59.510
<v Speaker 5>but I know that weed is the easy problem</v>
<v Speaker 5>to solve.</v>

923
00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:02.390
<v Speaker 5>Alcohol is a demon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That needs to be rooted out of our</v>

924
00:43:02.391 --> 00:43:03.420
<v Speaker 5>society.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

925
00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:05.780
<v Speaker 5>I disagree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I disagree with you.</v>

926
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:07.210
<v Speaker 5>I enjoy alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

927
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:07.730
<v Speaker 5>I do too.</v>

928
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:11.100
<v Speaker 5>but I mean like can put the block then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean just to see,</v>

929
00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:13.190
<v Speaker 5>like when we started having the</v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation,</v>

930
00:43:13.191 --> 00:43:14.870
<v Speaker 5>when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's compare it to alcohol,</v>

931
00:43:14.871 --> 00:43:17.700
<v Speaker 5>I start licking my chops because when</v>
<v Speaker 5>you compare it to alcohol,</v>

932
00:43:17.701 --> 00:43:19.820
<v Speaker 5>alcohol is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alcohol is poisonoUs.</v>

933
00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.830
<v Speaker 5>Idig drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I drank a lot,</v>

934
00:43:21.831 --> 00:43:23.800
<v Speaker 5>a lot all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

935
00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.540
<v Speaker 5>so I'm not saying you did say that</v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

936
00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:28.570
<v Speaker 5>You just misspoke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Misspelt don't.</v>

937
00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:29.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't mean pull it away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

938
00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:31.040
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand.</v>

939
00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:34.880
<v Speaker 5>But let's not demonize marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 5>compared to alcohol.</v>

940
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:37.490
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alcohol definitely ruins more people.</v>

941
00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:41.660
<v Speaker 5>It's definitely way worse for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely much more dangerous as</v>

942
00:43:41.661 --> 00:43:45.100
<v Speaker 5>far as like operating cars and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and behavior of the week.</v>

943
00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:46.760
<v Speaker 5>The foolish things that people do in</v>
<v Speaker 5>their drinking.</v>

944
00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:47.793
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All that stuff.</v>

945
00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:50.390
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of stuff that's directly</v>
<v Speaker 5>attributable to alcohol,</v>

946
00:43:50.391 --> 00:43:51.920
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what,</v>

947
00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.390
<v Speaker 5>so what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

948
00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.900
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've survived for so long with alcohol,</v>

949
00:43:57.110 --> 00:44:02.110
<v Speaker 5>it's the regulations have worked to at</v>
<v Speaker 5>least to a manageable.</v>

950
00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:06.500
<v Speaker 5>The fact that here's what You can't do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't stop people from doing what</v>

951
00:44:06.501 --> 00:44:09.230
<v Speaker 5>they want to do and not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>ExacTly.</v>

952
00:44:09.231 --> 00:44:11.630
<v Speaker 5>And why is it that you could stop</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone from doing that,</v>

953
00:44:11.631 --> 00:44:15.800
<v Speaker 5>but you can't stop them from practicing</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing flips and bmx bikes.</v>

954
00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:16.970
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would you.</v>

955
00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:19.650
<v Speaker 5>Can you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it because they're there?</v>

956
00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:24.620
<v Speaker 5>They're driving and injuring other</v>
<v Speaker 5>people will then take away their right</v>

957
00:44:24.621 --> 00:44:26.960
<v Speaker 5>to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's how we have it set up</v>

958
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:28.310
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're injuring people getting in</v>

959
00:44:28.311 --> 00:44:30.260
<v Speaker 5>fightS.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you lock them in jail yet?</v>

960
00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:31.710
<v Speaker 5>But the rest of the people</v>

961
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:33.460
<v Speaker 1>leave us alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

962
00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:35.290
<v Speaker 1>we should have the right to choose too</v>
<v Speaker 1>many fucking rights.</v>

963
00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.920
<v Speaker 1>We can control our own consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can control what we put in our</v>

964
00:44:37.921 --> 00:44:40.290
<v Speaker 1>bodies and here's most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>concept.</v>

965
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:43.830
<v Speaker 1>We're all just people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all just people to like.</v>

966
00:44:43.831 --> 00:44:45.900
<v Speaker 1>you can call them the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can call them the police.</v>

967
00:44:45.901 --> 00:44:48.480
<v Speaker 1>You can come the dea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a bunch of fucking people.</v>

968
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:51.630
<v Speaker 1>That's all they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go behind some big crazy name,</v>

969
00:44:51.631 --> 00:44:54.030
<v Speaker 1>like it's say fbi open up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People go,</v>

970
00:44:54.031 --> 00:44:55.230

<v Speaker 1>It's the fbi.</v>

971
00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:58.350
<v Speaker 1>If you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mike and steve and bob and we want</v>

972
00:44:58.351 --> 00:45:00.990
<v Speaker 1>to see what kind of plants are growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

973
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Open up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who the fuck are you guys?</v>

974
00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:07.080
<v Speaker 1>You guys are just some fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you write something down on</v>

975
00:45:07.081 --> 00:45:09.780
<v Speaker 1>paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how archaic our our world is.</v>

976
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:14.340
<v Speaker 1>you write something down on paper that</v>
<v Speaker 1>decreased power to these regular people,</v>

977
00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:18.080
<v Speaker 1>so these regular people the sudden have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right to fucking shit.</v>

978
00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Storm your house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kIck open your door,</v>

<v Speaker 1>pot hidden in your fucking bureau</v>

<v Speaker 1>drawer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the world we create is this is</v>

981
00:45:27.651 --> 00:45:30.990
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a real world and more people get</v>

982
00:45:30.991 --> 00:45:33.360
<v Speaker 1>killed during those rates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then pat would ever kill.</v>

983
00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:34.980
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't kill anybody.</v>

984
00:45:34.981 --> 00:45:36.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the most ridiculous thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did.</v>

985
00:45:36.571 --> 00:45:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Notice.</v>

987
00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:44.550
<v Speaker 1>every now and then like the mirror in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uk or one of those fake newspapers</v>

988
00:45:44.551 --> 00:45:47.220
<v Speaker 1>will put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A young man dies on marijuana.</v>

989
00:45:47.221 --> 00:45:50.220
<v Speaker 1>First known case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not true.</v>

990
00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:51.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't.</v>

991
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:53.940
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not toxic.</v>

992
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:57.910
<v Speaker 1>It might fuck your head up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck your head up,</v>

993
00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:59.790
<v Speaker 1>but you should be allowed to make that</v>
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>

994
00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fuck my head up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

995
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:06.920
<v Speaker 1>and if you're abusing it than the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>around you will help you or whatever.</v>

996
00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:09.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever needs to be done to just like</v>

997
00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:13.350
<v Speaker 1>monster energy drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know people who drink those things all</v>

998
00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:16.170
<v Speaker 1>day long and look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the way those fucking things</v>

999
00:46:16.171 --> 00:46:17.820
<v Speaker 1>taste and if you want to stay awake and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1000
00:46:17.821 --> 00:46:18.750
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going in.</v>

1001
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.440
<v Speaker 1>THat is the way to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not supposed to drink like 10</v>

1002
00:46:22.441 --> 00:46:25.680
<v Speaker 1>of them in a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That dude needs an intervention.</v>

1003
00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Some people are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll drink 10 of those giant red</v>

1004
00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:30.420
<v Speaker 1>bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big red bull,</v>

1005
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:34.220
<v Speaker 1>you know when they started making red</v>
<v Speaker 1>bull like a beer can now will a bud tall</v>

1006
00:46:34.221 --> 00:46:36.210
<v Speaker 1>boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that drink those all day.</v>

1007
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:39.340
<v Speaker 1>It's mostly people that have alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems that I would want to go to.</v>

1008
00:46:39.341 --> 00:46:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could switch to caffeine.</v>

1009
00:46:40.981 --> 00:46:43.980
<v Speaker 1>So I was like 20 coffees a day for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these guys.</v>

1010
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:46.930
<v Speaker 1>I went to the hospital because of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy drinks from heartbeat,</v>

1011
00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:48.960
<v Speaker 1>palpitations and stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah man,</v>

1012
00:46:48.961 --> 00:46:49.471
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1013
00:46:49.471 --> 00:46:51.810
<v Speaker 1>they're great if you want one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1014
00:46:51.811 --> 00:46:55.340
<v Speaker 1>and monsters probably actually like less</v>
<v Speaker 1>caffeine and some of them bad monster.</v>

1015
00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:56.670
<v Speaker 1>And the monster is one of the better</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>

1016
00:46:56.730 --> 00:47:01.200
<v Speaker 1>The better tasting one's the worst one</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I ever tried as far as like the</v>

1017
00:47:01.201 --> 00:47:03.510
<v Speaker 1>jolt that it gives you is that red line</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit you remember.</v>

1018
00:47:03.511 --> 00:47:04.870
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1019
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.840
<v Speaker 1>when I went to the hospital was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain.</v>

1020
00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:10.640
<v Speaker 1>They don't even make that any became</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>

1021
00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:14.700
<v Speaker 1>Red line is what's red hair?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was scary.</v>

1022
00:47:14.701 --> 00:47:19.701
<v Speaker 1>It was like can and in that kim was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 doses and you went down the whole</v>

1023
00:47:20.221 --> 00:47:21.850
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was um,</v>

1024
00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:25.200
<v Speaker 1>see if he could find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How safer those five hour energy drinks.</v>

1025
00:47:25.201 --> 00:47:27.780
<v Speaker 1>I chose a pretty safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty safe.</v>

1026
00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Those are mostly vitamin 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1027
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.830
<v Speaker 5>They only have a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to say like 70 milligrams of</v>

1028
00:47:32.831 --> 00:47:33.940
<v Speaker 5>caffeine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a cup of coffee,</v>

1029
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:36.250
<v Speaker 5>a cup of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they're safe.</v>

1030
00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.650
<v Speaker 5>I don't feel the same drink in that as I</v>
<v Speaker 5>do at red bull.</v>

1031
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.880
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like it.</v>

1032
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:42.430
<v Speaker 5>It's better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like those be 12 drinks.</v>

1033
00:47:42.431 --> 00:47:44.410
<v Speaker 5>I think b,</v>
<v Speaker 5>12 drinks are way better caffeine.</v>

1034
00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.320
<v Speaker 5>Two hundred 50 milligrams of caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't seem like that much.</v>

1035
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:49.380
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just what?</v>

1036
00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:52.310
<v Speaker 5>That's not an eight ounce bottle either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>ThAt is,</v>

1037
00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:56.080
<v Speaker 5>it says it says per a fluid ounce</v>
<v Speaker 5>bottle.</v>

1038
00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:00.930
<v Speaker 5>Coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if coffee is 50 milligrams and the</v>

1039
00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:04.810
<v Speaker 5>thInking of the wrong shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I swear I thought it was red line.</v>

1040
00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:06.910
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I'm just wrong about the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>

1041
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:10.240
<v Speaker 5>the sheer volume of caffeine and that</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

1042
00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.950
<v Speaker 5>but I thought it was just like</v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous.</v>

1043
00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:12.591
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1044
00:48:12.591 --> 00:48:13.990
<v Speaker 5>I drank it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whatever it was,</v>

1045
00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:15.480
<v Speaker 5>it was this one or the other one that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1046
00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:19.360
<v Speaker 5>it that I mistake the name for it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it says starbucks and I remember</v>

1047
00:48:19.361 --> 00:48:20.080
<v Speaker 5>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

1048
00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:22.210
<v Speaker 5>I am just way too jacked up right now.</v>

1049
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.130
<v Speaker 5>Starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>heavy caffeine.</v>

1050
00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:26.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I especially their cold brew,</v>

1051
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.410
<v Speaker 5>I get the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes they get the trenta hold the</v>

1052
00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:32.230
<v Speaker 5>fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A 20 ounce,</v>

1053
00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:35.570
<v Speaker 5>that's a trenta none.</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a venti.</v>

1054
00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:37.900
<v Speaker 5>I get the one above that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't even have the numbers for</v>

1055
00:48:37.901 --> 00:48:39.310
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But just saying a 20,</v>

1056
00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:44.370
<v Speaker 5>a 20 ounce has 415 milligrams of</v>
<v Speaker 5>caffeine in tacky cardia.</v>

1057
00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:47.290
<v Speaker 5>Holy shIt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that real iced coffees more?</v>

1058
00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:48.100
<v Speaker 5>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yo.</v>

1059
00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:50.680
<v Speaker 5>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Decaf has 30 milligrams.</v>

1060
00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:54.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fuck is that decaf alWays has a</v>

1061
00:48:54.761 --> 00:48:55.570
<v Speaker 5>level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1062
00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:58.030
<v Speaker 5>but 30 milligram.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was like five or something.</v>

1063
00:48:58.031 --> 00:49:00.190
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was like trace amounts to</v>
<v Speaker 5>see what the ice coffee is.</v>

1064
00:49:00.191 --> 00:49:04.290
<v Speaker 5>I believe it's a lot more really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get the trent usually.</v>

1065
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:07.180
<v Speaker 5>How is that possibLe?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A cold brew</v>

1066
00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:11.680
<v Speaker 5>cold brew.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Three 30 where I guess it's not more,</v>

1067
00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:14.200
<v Speaker 5>but I get the trend diversion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that's probably more.</v>

1068
00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can't keep serving you like that.</v>

1069
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:19.000
<v Speaker 5>They're going to have to have to pull</v>
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>

1070
00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:20.660
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing is,</v>

1071
00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.740
<v Speaker 5>is I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then my libertarian side doesn't</v>

1072
00:49:23.741 --> 00:49:26.050
<v Speaker 5>agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do you think you should drink that</v>

1073
00:49:26.051 --> 00:49:27.880
<v Speaker 5>shit all day if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course,</v>

1074
00:49:27.881 --> 00:49:31.090
<v Speaker 5>my friend dave foley used to drink pots</v>
<v Speaker 5>of coffee pot.</v>

1075
00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:35.020
<v Speaker 5>like all day he'd drink pots of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had to stop putting cream in because</v>

1076
00:49:35.021 --> 00:49:37.720
<v Speaker 5>he realized he was drinking a quart of</v>
<v Speaker 5>ice cream a day.</v>

1077
00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:40.090
<v Speaker 5>I think of that every time I put cream</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my coffee,</v>

1078
00:49:40.091 --> 00:49:44.710
<v Speaker 5>I think of your stories telling me about</v>
<v Speaker 5>that court cream just from coffee.</v>

1079
00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:46.330
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like that.</v>

1080
00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:47.950
<v Speaker 5>Fresh heady cream.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I constantly.</v>

1081
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.000
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm talking about a year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a dark roast hawaiian coffee with</v>

1082
00:49:53.171 --> 00:49:57.850
<v Speaker 5>some heavy cream</v>
<v Speaker 5>motherfucker.</v>

1083
00:49:57.851 --> 00:50:00.910
<v Speaker 5>You gonna make me feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what cool that starbucks is now</v>

1084
00:50:00.911 --> 00:50:02.620
<v Speaker 5>doing that they're doing with their cold</v>
<v Speaker 5>brew coffee.</v>

1085
00:50:02.621 --> 00:50:05.650
<v Speaker 5>they have like a heavy cream that's like</v>
<v Speaker 5>karma or something.</v>

1086
00:50:05.651 --> 00:50:07.490
<v Speaker 5>They mixed through it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nice.</v>

1087
00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:10.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the cigarettes and coffee thing or</v>

1088
00:50:10.511 --> 00:50:12.710
<v Speaker 5>the staples of the alcoholics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1089
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:16.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people enjoy those cigarettes</v>

1090
00:50:16.841 --> 00:50:18.190
<v Speaker 5>and they enjoy those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1091
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:20.170
<v Speaker 5>those coffees.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

1092
00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:21.220
<v Speaker 5>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1093
00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:23.200
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in their eyes they feel like they've</v>

1094
00:50:23.201 --> 00:50:27.590
<v Speaker 5>got the alcohol part under wraps now</v>
<v Speaker 5>because this stuff just kind of keeps</v>

1095
00:50:27.591 --> 00:50:29.840
<v Speaker 5>them going and this stuff is not ruining</v>
<v Speaker 5>their life.</v>

1096
00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:30.700
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>

1097
00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:33.430
<v Speaker 2>A lot of alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She used cannabis the same way.</v>

1098
00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:34.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1099
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:38.500
<v Speaker 2>that's not really accepted by aa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I know a lot,</v>

1100
00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:39.830
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people who have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1101
00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:44.200
<v Speaker 2>kicked their alcoholism by moving more</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards cannabis,</v>

1102
00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:45.400
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1103
00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:48.160
<v Speaker 2>within the gay community that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

1104
00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:50.320
<v Speaker 2>that's still considered a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1105
00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:51.400
<v Speaker 2>but you can get a degree</v>

1106
00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.720
<v Speaker 5>good to anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1107
00:50:52.721 --> 00:50:57.721
<v Speaker 5>whether it's porn or big macs or where</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can get it a psychologically addicted</v>

1108
00:50:58.871 --> 00:51:00.700
<v Speaker 5>to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But jamie didn't.</v>

1109
00:51:00.701 --> 00:51:04.660
<v Speaker 5>The guy who created alcoholics</v>
<v Speaker 5>anonymous,</v>

1110
00:51:04.661 --> 00:51:06.790
<v Speaker 5>didn't you have positive experiences</v>
<v Speaker 5>with lsd?</v>

1111
00:51:09.310 --> 00:51:10.570
<v Speaker 5>That'd be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be like,</v>

1112
00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:13.320
<v Speaker 5>I feel like you did assets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only thing you're allowed to take</v>

1113
00:51:13.321 --> 00:51:15.580
<v Speaker 5>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well I feel like I feel like that was</v>

1114
00:51:15.581 --> 00:51:19.090
<v Speaker 5>something that happened like maybe even</v>
<v Speaker 5>a after.</v>

1115
00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:22.120
<v Speaker 5>Well I don't want to speak out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>school.</v>

1116
00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:23.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my right.</v>

1117
00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.313
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hold on.</v>

1118
00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:27.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what the fuck?</v>

1119
00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:30.420
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why the government needs</v>
<v Speaker 2>testing on,</v>

1120
00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:32.150
<v Speaker 2>on a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we know.</v>

1121
00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:35.710
<v Speaker 5>Scroll that up please.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alcoholics anonymous for a founder</v>

1122
00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:39.280
<v Speaker 5>believed lsd could cure alcoholism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1123
00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:43.930
<v Speaker 5>Well you've seen so much research now in</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychedelics that clinics are opening</v>

1124
00:51:43.931 --> 00:51:45.220
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a clinic in,</v>

1125
00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:47.350
<v Speaker 5>in la for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for cattlemen,</v>

1126
00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're seeing mda clinics opening up</v>

1127
00:51:50.341 --> 00:51:52.760
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what most of them do not realize that</v>

1128
00:51:52.761 --> 00:51:55.300
<v Speaker 5>the program's co founder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bill wilson,</v>

1129
00:51:55.301 --> 00:52:00.301
<v Speaker 5>credited the psychedelic drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lsd for alleviating his alcoholism and</v>

1130
00:52:00.371 --> 00:52:03.700
<v Speaker 5>believe the drug could be used to treat</v>
<v Speaker 5>others as well.</v>

1131
00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.250
<v Speaker 5>Holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So those friends of bill,</v>

1132
00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:10.330
<v Speaker 5>they didn't get all the information.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just kind of like friends of bill,</v>

1133
00:52:10.331 --> 00:52:12.610
<v Speaker 5>if you're in the alcoholics anonymous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1134
00:52:12.611 --> 00:52:14.080
<v Speaker 5>That's what they call themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like friends of bill.</v>

1135
00:52:14.081 --> 00:52:16.780
<v Speaker 5>It's like the cold war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they didn't get that experience.</v>

1136
00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:19.790
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of like the mushrooms that</v>
<v Speaker 5>quitting cigarettes do,</v>

1137
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:23.530
<v Speaker 5>but do you think they tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never heard this before today.</v>

1138
00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:27.010
<v Speaker 5>How could you not tell these people?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wilson first became big,</v>

1139
00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:30.610
<v Speaker 5>began experimenting with lsd in los</v>
<v Speaker 5>angeles at the veterans administration</v>

1140
00:52:30.611 --> 00:52:34.930
<v Speaker 5>back in 1956.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But after taking his first hit of acid,</v>

1141
00:52:34.931 --> 00:52:39.820
<v Speaker 5>he realized that it was not the aspect</v>
<v Speaker 5>of terror that could help remedy</v>

1142
00:52:39.821 --> 00:52:42.790
<v Speaker 5>alcoholism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but rather the insight one could obtain</v>

1143
00:52:42.791 --> 00:52:46.660
<v Speaker 5>from stepping into a world of simulated</v>
<v Speaker 5>insanity.</v>

1144
00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:50.890
<v Speaker 5>Willow wilSon believed that using the</v>
<v Speaker 5>lsd could help.</v>

1145
00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:56.020
<v Speaker 5>The alcoholic discover a power greater</v>
<v Speaker 5>than ourselves that in turn could</v>

1146
00:52:56.021 --> 00:52:58.540
<v Speaker 5>restore us to sanity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

1147
00:52:58.541 --> 00:53:02.350
<v Speaker 5>he was adamant that using acid to combat</v>
<v Speaker 5>the demons of alcoholism was not</v>

1148
00:53:02.351 --> 00:53:05.410
<v Speaker 5>something that he could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that one could expect from a single</v>

1149
00:53:05.411 --> 00:53:09.360
<v Speaker 5>dose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like more research is required and</v>

1150
00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:10.710
<v Speaker 5>snacks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1151
00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:12.910
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting man.</v>

1152
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:13.833
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1153
00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:18.010
<v Speaker 5>Psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think as we experiment with them</v>

1154
00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:24.600
<v Speaker 5>medically are gonna reveal some secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Skies skys a heavy duty tripper.</v>

1155
00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 5>They're going further down.</v>

1156
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:30.290
<v Speaker 4>He was tripping with aldous huxley.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this guy.</v>

1157
00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:33.270
<v Speaker 4>This isn't like one experience you had</v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

1158
00:53:33.271 --> 00:53:36.600
<v Speaker 4>There's documentation that indicates</v>
<v Speaker 4>wilson was involved with many supervise</v>

1159
00:53:36.601 --> 00:53:40.260
<v Speaker 4>lsd trials,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including someone's psychology</v>

1160
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:44.190
<v Speaker 4>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>betty eisner and brave new world author,</v>

1161
00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.650
<v Speaker 4>aldous huxley,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which led him to believe that the</v>

1162
00:53:46.651 --> 00:53:51.450
<v Speaker 4>visions and insights given by lsd could</v>
<v Speaker 4>create a large incentive,</v>

1163
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:53.580
<v Speaker 4>at least in a considerable number of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1164
00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:59.660
<v Speaker 4>was with like a leader and in fact they</v>
<v Speaker 4>live left this out of the a pamphlet.</v>

1165
00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.310
<v Speaker 4>How do they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How could they leave this out?</v>

1166
00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:07.330
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy because it seems like this</v>
<v Speaker 4>had to play a major part in this guy's</v>

1167
00:54:07.531 --> 00:54:09.030
<v Speaker 4>ability to kick alcohol.</v>

1168
00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:11.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like at every major religion</v>

1169
00:54:11.711 --> 00:54:15.430
<v Speaker 2>also left out the psychedelics that</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably created them as well.</v>

1170
00:54:15.431 --> 00:54:16.600
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1171
00:54:16.601 --> 00:54:17.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1172
00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:20.230
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of times you got to leave</v>

1173
00:54:20.231 --> 00:54:22.900
<v Speaker 2>out the stuff that you think people</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't going to follow you for.</v>

1174
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.800
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've seen alcoholics anonymous,</v>

1175
00:54:24.801 --> 00:54:27.290
<v Speaker 4>has a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what you just said,</v>

1176
00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:30.390
<v Speaker 4>call you son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't even believe you,</v>

1177
00:54:30.391 --> 00:54:32.330
<v Speaker 4>gina.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought we were friends.</v>

1178
00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.670
<v Speaker 4>That is um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is really wild,</v>

1179
00:54:34.671 --> 00:54:36.410
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's really interesting stuff.</v>

1180
00:54:36.411 --> 00:54:38.780
<v Speaker 4>But it totally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it totally makes sense that it could</v>

1181
00:54:38.781 --> 00:54:42.890
<v Speaker 4>help you a kick in addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That totally makes sense because the</v>

1182
00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:47.920
<v Speaker 4>stark contrast between being intoxicated</v>
<v Speaker 4>on it and what it feels like to be</v>

1183
00:54:48.111 --> 00:54:51.440
<v Speaker 4>normal and this rethinking like a reset</v>
<v Speaker 4>button.</v>

1184
00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:53.660
<v Speaker 4>That's what all the psychedelics</v>
<v Speaker 4>provide.</v>

1185
00:54:53.661 --> 00:54:55.970
<v Speaker 4>That's really beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Besides being fun.</v>

1186
00:54:56.570 --> 00:55:01.460
<v Speaker 4>They all provide that reset that takes</v>
<v Speaker 4>you so far out of who you are right now</v>

1187
00:55:01.461 --> 00:55:02.420
<v Speaker 4>that when you come back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>

1188
00:55:02.421 --> 00:55:03.740
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>am I doing this the right way?</v>

1189
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.620
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1190
00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:08.510
<v Speaker 4>now that I'm back to sober reality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do I need to refocus this connection</v>

1191
00:55:08.511 --> 00:55:10.460
<v Speaker 4>from your own ego?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1192
00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:11.803
<v Speaker 4>probably good idea.</v>

1193
00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:12.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

1194
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:17.870
<v Speaker 2>you have the organization maps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the guy from maps on the podcast</v>

1195
00:55:18.631 --> 00:55:22.110
<v Speaker 2>who's that does the psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>

1196
00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:23.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1197
00:55:23.850 --> 00:55:25.570
<v Speaker 2>I forgot what doblin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1198
00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:27.060
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1199
00:55:27.061 --> 00:55:29.820
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so just recently he,</v>

1200
00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:31.210
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got um,</v>

1201
00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:33.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>authorized from the federal government</v>

1202
00:55:33.901 --> 00:55:38.901
<v Speaker 2>to start doing research on cannabis for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time that federal federal ban</v>

1203
00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.460
<v Speaker 2>was lifted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was because because of maps,</v>

1204
00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:42.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>

1205
00:55:42.531 --> 00:55:45.570
<v Speaker 2>they were able to get that they were the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first ones granted that,</v>

1206
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:48.900
<v Speaker 2>that federal research on cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1207
00:55:48.901 --> 00:55:50.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it,</v>

1208
00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:52.410
<v Speaker 2>it's in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in very similar ways.</v>

1209
00:55:52.411 --> 00:55:56.130
<v Speaker 2>We need to do research on lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to do research on psilocybin</v>

1210
00:55:56.340 --> 00:56:00.150
<v Speaker 2>because there could be medical effects</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just like cannabis were just</v>

1211
00:56:00.151 --> 00:56:03.300
<v Speaker 2>denying because of years of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1212
00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:05.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the way it was.</v>

1213
00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.210
<v Speaker 2>They're bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're bad.</v>

1214
00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:09.570
<v Speaker 4>Jamie put that back up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That quote about,</v>

1215
00:56:09.571 --> 00:56:11.130
<v Speaker 4>bill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is crazy.</v>

1216
00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.650
<v Speaker 4>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says a.</v>

1217
00:56:12.651 --> 00:56:14.940
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lsd made its way into the rooms of</v>

1218
00:56:14.941 --> 00:56:17.630
<v Speaker 4>alcoholics anonymous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Simply because others in a hierarchy</v>

1219
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:21.390
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy hierarchy did not support it</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a viable treatment.</v>

1220
00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a document published in 1984 by</v>

1221
00:56:24.161 --> 00:56:27.430
<v Speaker 4>alcoholics anonymous world services in</v>
<v Speaker 4>New York explained that the reason the</v>

1222
00:56:27.431 --> 00:56:32.431
<v Speaker 4>program does not endorse the use of lsd</v>
<v Speaker 4>as word of bill's activity,</v>

1223
00:56:32.651 --> 00:56:35.620
<v Speaker 4>this is all in quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As word of bill's activitiEs reached the</v>

1224
00:56:35.621 --> 00:56:38.590
<v Speaker 4>fellowship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were inevitable repercussions.</v>

1225
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:43.330
<v Speaker 4>Most aes were violently opposed to his</v>
<v Speaker 4>experimenting with a mind altering</v>

1226
00:56:43.331 --> 00:56:46.420
<v Speaker 4>substance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lsd was then totally unfamiliar,</v>

1227
00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:49.870
<v Speaker 4>poorly researched,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and entirely experimental dot,</v>

1228
00:56:49.871 --> 00:56:50.410
<v Speaker 4>dot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dot,</v>

1229
00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:54.130
<v Speaker 4>and bill was taking it and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder,</v>

1230
00:56:54.131 --> 00:56:58.000
<v Speaker 4>pills there was scared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were all scared that this guy was</v>

1231
00:56:58.001 --> 00:57:00.220
<v Speaker 4>tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

1232
00:57:00.221 --> 00:57:05.050
<v Speaker 4>So they didn't want to include it even</v>
<v Speaker 4>though the founder of the program found</v>

1233
00:57:05.051 --> 00:57:09.970
<v Speaker 4>it massively beneficial and it's almost</v>
<v Speaker 4>ironic that that trying to put it in</v>

1234
00:57:09.971 --> 00:57:12.100
<v Speaker 4>there and they kicked him out basically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

1235
00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:15.970
<v Speaker 4>Whereas this apparent resistance to step</v>
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>

1236
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:17.800
<v Speaker 4>I was chastised for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

1237
00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:19.840
<v Speaker 4>that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that crazy?</v>

1238
00:57:19.841 --> 00:57:21.490
<v Speaker 4>Because timothy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1239
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:24.670
<v Speaker 4>terrence mckenna attributed this quote</v>
<v Speaker 4>that timothy leary,</v>

1240
00:57:24.671 --> 00:57:27.400
<v Speaker 4>but timothy leary said he never said it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so nobody knows exactly who said it,</v>

1241
00:57:27.401 --> 00:57:32.020
<v Speaker 4>but that lsd causes violent reactions to</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who have never tried it.</v>

1242
00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:35.220
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

1243
00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.840
<v Speaker 8>YeAh.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Very interesting.</v>

1244
00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:41.850
<v Speaker 8>The people that haven't tried it are the</v>
<v Speaker 8>ones that are not the people who were on</v>

1245
00:57:41.851 --> 00:57:42.684
<v Speaker 8>it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

1246
00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:46.140
<v Speaker 8>Do you think lsd though for real,</v>
<v Speaker 8>can solve anything?</v>

1247
00:57:46.141 --> 00:57:48.750
<v Speaker 8>I.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've done it maybe over 200 times and</v>

1248
00:57:48.751 --> 00:57:53.751
<v Speaker 8>you might not be the best example</v>
<v Speaker 8>when you were taking it 200 times.</v>

1249
00:57:54.090 --> 00:57:56.880
<v Speaker 8>A lot of that was recreational,</v>
<v Speaker 8>not,</v>

1250
00:57:56.910 --> 00:58:00.000
<v Speaker 8>but I'm sure there was small little</v>
<v Speaker 8>things that I was probably going through</v>

1251
00:58:00.001 --> 00:58:05.001
<v Speaker 8>that I could have used lsd to help me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like I like as an example,</v>

1252
00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:09.690
<v Speaker 8>I took lsd once after a big breakup.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Did it help me get through that breakup?</v>

1253
00:58:09.691 --> 00:58:11.730
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>
<v Speaker 8>it did nothing for my breakup,</v>

1254
00:58:11.731 --> 00:58:15.360
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Or were you trading on it to try to use</v>

1255
00:58:15.361 --> 00:58:18.360
<v Speaker 8>it that way?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Or that's the thing.</v>

1256
00:58:18.361 --> 00:58:21.820
<v Speaker 8>It's also going to go with your own</v>
<v Speaker 8>intention probably,</v>

1257
00:58:21.850 --> 00:58:23.670
<v Speaker 8>and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't work for you.</v>

1258
00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:25.620
<v Speaker 8>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>hey,</v>

1259
00:58:25.621 --> 00:58:28.550
<v Speaker 8>clean up my life.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to take some acid just right.</v>

1260
00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:30.350
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you got to do the work yourself.</v>

1261
00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:31.193
<v Speaker 8>I just don't see it</v>

1262
00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:33.940
<v Speaker 4>presents what it will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these psychedelics,</v>

1263
00:58:33.941 --> 00:58:36.670
<v Speaker 4>like the good experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bad experiences represent what's the</v>

1264
00:58:36.671 --> 00:58:39.430
<v Speaker 4>state of mind when you go into them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why the people that take it</v>

1265
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:43.660
<v Speaker 4>really seriously and they go through</v>
<v Speaker 4>this all meditative ritual and they'll</v>

1266
00:58:43.661 --> 00:58:47.680
<v Speaker 4>do yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do breathing exercises and they'll set</v>

1267
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:52.450
<v Speaker 4>like a tone to whatever they would like</v>
<v Speaker 4>to go into this experience with and say</v>

1268
00:58:52.451 --> 00:58:55.630
<v Speaker 4>say that they're going into the</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience open and humble and say all</v>

1269
00:58:55.631 --> 00:58:58.510
<v Speaker 4>these things out loud and then they</v>
<v Speaker 4>enter into the psychedelic trip.</v>

1270
00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:02.650
<v Speaker 4>Like they do it that way because they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to set an intention.</v>

1271
00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:05.100
<v Speaker 4>If you just broke up with a girl and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>take asset,</v>

1272
00:59:05.101 --> 00:59:06.030
<v Speaker 4>if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really think about it.</v>

1273
00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:08.510
<v Speaker 8>The exciting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because you didn't help me when I broke</v>

1274
00:59:08.511 --> 00:59:11.430
<v Speaker 8>up my girl.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like that's really what you're saying.</v>

1275
00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:12.530
<v Speaker 8>But you could also be like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>hey,</v>

1276
00:59:12.531 --> 00:59:14.150
<v Speaker 8>I want to quit smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Take acid.</v>

1277
00:59:14.151 --> 00:59:15.050
<v Speaker 8>Being like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what happened?</v>

1278
00:59:15.051 --> 00:59:16.120
<v Speaker 8>Did you quit smoking?</v>
<v Speaker 8>And like,</v>

1279
00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:19.940
<v Speaker 8>and I know I focused on cigarettes and</v>
<v Speaker 8>then the whole place melted and in my</v>

1280
00:59:19.941 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 8>hand turned into a bunch snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So no,</v>

1281
00:59:21.981 --> 00:59:23.430
<v Speaker 8>I still went to.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Again,</v>

1282
00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:27.040
<v Speaker 1>you don't really want to quit if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to quit,</v>

1283
00:59:27.041 --> 00:59:28.160
<v Speaker 1>you just quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1284
00:59:28.510 --> 00:59:30.220
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think they asked the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has anything to do with it?</v>

1285
00:59:30.221 --> 00:59:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't help you.</v>

1286
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:35.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to just decide for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it depends on what's the intention</v>

1287
00:59:35.201 --> 00:59:38.620
<v Speaker 1>that you go into taking any psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's mushrooms or whatever.</v>

1288
00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:41.200
<v Speaker 1>What's the intention that you go into</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1289
00:59:41.290 --> 00:59:45.610
<v Speaker 1>this trip with and you can't think like</v>
<v Speaker 1>acid doesn't work because it didn't help</v>

1290
00:59:45.611 --> 00:59:48.370
<v Speaker 1>me quit smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you didn't help you quit smoking.</v>

1291
00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Like these are decisions that you make?</v>

1292
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:50.571
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

1293
00:59:50.571 --> 00:59:55.400
<v Speaker 8>I just don't see how acid it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Unless it's really bad acid that will.</v>

1294
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:59.240
<v Speaker 8>You'll remember anything except melty</v>
<v Speaker 8>stuff in the walls.</v>

1295
00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:03.290
<v Speaker 8>Melting and lizards.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just don't see any kind of help on our</v>

1296
01:00:03.291 --> 01:00:04.580
<v Speaker 8>lesser,</v>
<v Speaker 8>lesser level.</v>

1297
01:00:04.581 --> 01:00:09.581
<v Speaker 8>Do you feel like cannabis has changed</v>
<v Speaker 8>your personality because you know that</v>

1298
01:00:10.101 --> 01:00:12.420
<v Speaker 8>is something you might not go into st.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Alright,</v>

1299
01:00:12.450 --> 01:00:14.360
<v Speaker 8>I broke up with tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to smoke weed for it.</v>

1300
01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:18.260
<v Speaker 8>But throughout your lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 8>has cannabis had an effect on you that</v>

1301
01:00:18.261 --> 01:00:20.450
<v Speaker 8>you feel like it's changed your</v>
<v Speaker 8>personality?</v>

1302
01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.520
<v Speaker 8>I've been smoking since I was like 14,</v>
<v Speaker 8>15,</v>

1303
01:00:22.521 --> 01:00:24.680
<v Speaker 8>so I don't even know what my personality</v>
<v Speaker 8>was before,</v>

1304
01:00:24.681 --> 01:00:26.750
<v Speaker 8>if anything.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think marijuana made me more paranoid</v>

1305
01:00:26.751 --> 01:00:28.280
<v Speaker 8>and scared,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1306
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:33.430
<v Speaker 8>I was more freaked out and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But as a medicine for headaches and I</v>

1307
01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:36.710
<v Speaker 8>don't take almost any pills now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't have tylenol in my house</v>

1308
01:00:36.711 --> 01:00:36.950
<v Speaker 8>anymore.</v>

1309
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:38.510
<v Speaker 8>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if I have a headache I use weed.</v>

1310
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.270
<v Speaker 8>So for that it has helped me</v>
<v Speaker 8>tremendously.</v>

1311
01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:45.350
<v Speaker 8>But personality wise probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It probably made me more paranoid and</v>

1312
01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:48.290
<v Speaker 8>awful as a person when smoking it</v>
<v Speaker 8>because I'm,</v>

1313
01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:49.850
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I get panicky,</v>

1314
01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:50.600
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if I,</v>

1315
01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:54.050
<v Speaker 8>if I'm super stoned in a room of people,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's not helping me at all.</v>

1316
01:00:54.051 --> 01:00:55.490
<v Speaker 8>It's making it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If anything.</v>

1317
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.980
<v Speaker 8>What about you joe?</v>
<v Speaker 8>And he started later,</v>

1318
01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:01.310
<v Speaker 8>later that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you didn't start as a teenager.</v>

1319
01:01:01.311 --> 01:01:04.400
<v Speaker 8>So do you feel like it's made a</v>
<v Speaker 8>difference on who you are?</v>

1320
01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changes your perspective.</v>

1321
01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:08.080
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1322
01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:12.190
<v Speaker 1>it offers you some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different frequency of insight I would</v>

1323
01:01:12.191 --> 01:01:13.420
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

1324
01:01:13.421 --> 01:01:16.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's done that's</v>

1325
01:01:16.811 --> 01:01:18.040
<v Speaker 1>good is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1326
01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>it makes me consider things that I might</v>
<v Speaker 1>not be thinking about and uh,</v>

1327
01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.660
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you almost a deliminates areas</v>

1328
01:01:25.661 --> 01:01:28.870
<v Speaker 1>of your consciousness that maybe you</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't paying attention to.</v>

1329
01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:33.160
<v Speaker 1>It's mAde me a nicer guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm kind of a type a high strung</v>

1330
01:01:33.161 --> 01:01:36.100
<v Speaker 1>guy and like if there's an employee that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to strangle,</v>

1331
01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.130
<v Speaker 1>I can take a hit of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the no ga and suddenly be like,</v>

1332
01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:39.781
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's,</v>

1333
01:01:39.781 --> 01:01:40.970
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's all right.</v>

1334
01:01:41.370 --> 01:01:43.300
<v Speaker 1>He's had a hard day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1335
01:01:43.301 --> 01:01:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Instead of accelerating that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and shitty behavior,</v>

1336
01:01:46.811 --> 01:01:51.400
<v Speaker 1>it definitely makes you more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more inclined towards fellowship and</v>

1337
01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:53.230
<v Speaker 1>kindness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a,</v>

1338
01:01:53.231 --> 01:01:56.110
<v Speaker 1>it's a really good chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1339
01:01:56.111 --> 01:01:59.980
<v Speaker 1>it's a really good reaction that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind has to this natural plant for</v>

1340
01:01:59.981 --> 01:02:03.310
<v Speaker 1>creative reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent definitely opens up</v>

1341
01:02:03.311 --> 01:02:05.740
<v Speaker 1>a different pathway in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it for everything.</v>

1342
01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:08.080
<v Speaker 1>I like it for a lot of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it but it.</v>

1343
01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:10.540
<v Speaker 1>But for creative reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the best things.</v>

1344
01:02:10.541 --> 01:02:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>creativity and things like that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

1376
01:03:29.031 --> 01:03:29.780
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get,</v>

1377
01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:33.350
<v Speaker 5>I get jumpy with steve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get a little bit Freaked out,</v>

1378
01:03:33.351 --> 01:03:35.300
<v Speaker 5>a little paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pussies move in together.</v>

1379
01:03:35.570 --> 01:03:39.390
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we're neighbors actually are.</v>

1380
01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

1381
01:03:41.031 --> 01:03:42.890
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've all been to high.</v>

1382
01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:44.630
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's been too high,</v>

1383
01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:45.733
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1384
01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:49.250
<v Speaker 5>one of the most famous scientists wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>carl sagan.</v>

1385
01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:51.580
<v Speaker 5>It was some other famous scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1386
01:03:51.590 --> 01:03:54.030
<v Speaker 5>it was a theoretical mathematician,</v>
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>

1387
01:03:54.050 --> 01:03:55.520
<v Speaker 5>the rights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all that crazy scribble shit.</v>

1388
01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.890
<v Speaker 5>He would just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he would just talk about how he likes</v>

1389
01:03:57.891 --> 01:03:59.420
<v Speaker 5>one hit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what he likes to take.</v>

1390
01:03:59.450 --> 01:04:02.300
<v Speaker 5>Just one hit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just go for a walk on these ideas would</v>

1391
01:04:02.301 --> 01:04:04.100
<v Speaker 5>come to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you don't have to get fucking</v>

1392
01:04:04.101 --> 01:04:05.660
<v Speaker 5>blasted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just one hit.</v>

1393
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:10.700
<v Speaker 5>That's why I was so against it at first</v>
<v Speaker 5>is because I thought one hit made you</v>

1394
01:04:10.701 --> 01:04:13.250
<v Speaker 5>really fucked up because that's how I</v>
<v Speaker 5>saw gino.</v>

1395
01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.950
<v Speaker 5>But it turned out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gina would say you were such a dick to</v>

1396
01:04:15.951 --> 01:04:18.250
<v Speaker 5>me when I smoked weed in your house that</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to go outside,</v>

1397
01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:21.050
<v Speaker 5>smoke a whole joint in two minutes and</v>
<v Speaker 5>come in and be a mess.</v>

1398
01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:23.330
<v Speaker 5>So that was what I was exposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

1399
01:04:23.331 --> 01:04:25.610
<v Speaker 5>I don't want any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't realize you could just take one</v>

1400
01:04:25.611 --> 01:04:29.900
<v Speaker 5>hit and just chill out and still work</v>
<v Speaker 5>and still function.</v>

1401
01:04:30.350 --> 01:04:32.570
<v Speaker 5>Nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it makes people nicer.</v>

1402
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:34.670
<v Speaker 5>The definitely does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It did it for me,</v>

1403
01:04:36.450 --> 01:04:37.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1404
01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.340
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1405
01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:40.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say that,</v>

1406
01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:42.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the medical facts?</v>

1407
01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:45.870
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you treating yourself for it?</v>

1408
01:04:45.871 --> 01:04:50.871
<v Speaker 2>It's almost silly to say because</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone else who's not really treating</v>

1409
01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:54.270
<v Speaker 2>themselves for a cancer or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

1410
01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.520
<v Speaker 2>they are getting mood regulation out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1411
01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.190
<v Speaker 2>So even if you wanT to call it</v>
<v Speaker 2>recreational smoking,</v>

1412
01:04:59.191 --> 01:05:01.050
<v Speaker 2>you're still getting mood regulation out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

1413
01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:05.640
<v Speaker 2>And those people who smoke it almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>daily or whatever on whatever schedule</v>

1414
01:05:05.641 --> 01:05:07.230
<v Speaker 2>they smoke it on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might have,</v>

1415
01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.240
<v Speaker 2>if they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might be on percocet,</v>

1416
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:10.980
<v Speaker 2>they might be on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1417
01:05:10.981 --> 01:05:14.310
<v Speaker 2>welbutrin and they might be on a million</v>
<v Speaker 2>other other drugs.</v>

1418
01:05:14.311 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 2>So to say that recreational use is</v>
<v Speaker 2>people just getting high.</v>

1419
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:23.250
<v Speaker 5>That's also also not accepting that</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are looking for mood regulation</v>

1420
01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:29.920
<v Speaker 5>as a medical effect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we already have it with coffee.</v>

1421
01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:31.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Coffee,</v>

1422
01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:33.580
<v Speaker 5>nicotine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>booze.</v>

1423
01:05:33.581 --> 01:05:36.880
<v Speaker 5>That's all business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so many different things.</v>

1424
01:05:36.881 --> 01:05:40.480
<v Speaker 5>We already accept sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well sugar is the scariest one.</v>

1425
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:41.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that shit's everywhere.</v>

1426
01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.890
<v Speaker 5>Once you start paying attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the Idea is that you should be able</v>

1427
01:05:44.891 --> 01:05:46.840
<v Speaker 5>to do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want to eat candy bars all day,</v>

1428
01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:51.250
<v Speaker 5>that should be completely up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's not where we are,</v>

1429
01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:53.740
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the fact that that's not where we</v>

1430
01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.780
<v Speaker 5>were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where we are with one of the most</v>

1431
01:05:55.781 --> 01:05:59.230
<v Speaker 5>beneficial plants the world's ever known</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's really what it is.</v>

1432
01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:03.820
<v Speaker 5>Especially since it's connection to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the most beneficial plant the</v>

1433
01:06:03.821 --> 01:06:05.590
<v Speaker 5>world's ever known.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's illegal.</v>

1434
01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:07.600
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't show you how stupid people</v>

1435
01:06:07.601 --> 01:06:08.320
<v Speaker 5>are.</v>

1436
01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're so god damn goofy.</v>

1437
01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:13.510
<v Speaker 5>We are and it's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's goNna get worse before it gets</v>

1438
01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:14.410
<v Speaker 5>better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unfortunately.</v>

1439
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:17.500
<v Speaker 5>Think because the laws are such a mess</v>
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>

1440
01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.420
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hillary clinton's gonna fix everything.</v>

1441
01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:21.280
<v Speaker 5>She gets an offer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's going to be great.</v>

1442
01:06:21.281 --> 01:06:25.070
<v Speaker 5>She's always been a top shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1443
01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.160
<v Speaker 5>who Donald Trump?</v>
<v Speaker 5>is he going to fix it?</v>

1444
01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:27.791
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He.</v>

1445
01:06:27.791 --> 01:06:29.330
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he cares.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He cares.</v>

1446
01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:31.870
<v Speaker 5>I know he doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that.</v>

1447
01:06:31.871 --> 01:06:32.621
<v Speaker 5>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

1448
01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:35.580
<v Speaker 5>With the legalized marijuana nationwide,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get a lot of stoller.</v>

1449
01:06:35.581 --> 01:06:37.480
<v Speaker 5>Switch gears.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Know what scares me.</v>

1450
01:06:37.481 --> 01:06:40.450
<v Speaker 5>Is that what if he makes chris christie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the attorney general?</v>

1451
01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:43.000
<v Speaker 5>That would be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would be hilarious.</v>

1452
01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:44.910
<v Speaker 5>It'd be so bad for my business,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

1453
01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:46.480
<v Speaker 5>Have you been?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'd be hilarious.</v>

1454
01:06:46.481 --> 01:06:49.110
<v Speaker 5>That guy is not going to be the attorney</v>
<v Speaker 5>general it.</v>

1455
01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.580
<v Speaker 5>If he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The attorney general will take anybody</v>

1456
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:53.430
<v Speaker 5>with however you got so full.</v>

1457
01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:57.010
<v Speaker 5>He's so foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Has his opinions on marijuana while</v>

1458
01:06:57.011 --> 01:06:59.830
<v Speaker 5>consuming copious amounts of sugar and</v>
<v Speaker 5>public.</v>

1459
01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.840
<v Speaker 5>they're so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ridiculous.</v>

1460
01:07:01.841 --> 01:07:04.960
<v Speaker 5>He put a bag of m and m's inside is m</v>
<v Speaker 5>and m's after,</v>

1461
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:08.200
<v Speaker 5>after he had stomach surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's a crazy person,</v>

1462
01:07:08.310 --> 01:07:10.810
<v Speaker 5>so this guy is addicted to sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One hundred percent,</v>

1463
01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:14.020
<v Speaker 5>but that's clear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So no way you stay that big unless</v>

1464
01:07:14.021 --> 01:07:15.730
<v Speaker 5>you're eating terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just it.</v>

1465
01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:20.140
<v Speaker 5>But he'll go with one thing is legal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One thing is not saying end of story.</v>

1466
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:21.820
<v Speaker 5>Who's an insane person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's what.</v>

1467
01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.440
<v Speaker 5>That's what we're fighting with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>city.</v>

1468
01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:25.540
<v Speaker 5>Just this is the law.</v>
<v Speaker 5>End of story.</v>

1469
01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:31.360
<v Speaker 5>You get the chance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He can't even win the democratic side</v>

1470
01:07:31.361 --> 01:07:32.860
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>still voting for gary,</v>

1471
01:07:32.861 --> 01:07:33.910
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gary Johnson.</v>

1472
01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:36.730
<v Speaker 5>You got Gary Johnson is a better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost.</v>

1473
01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:39.910
<v Speaker 5>Well it's a more likely vote than bernie</v>
<v Speaker 5>at this point.</v>

1474
01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:42.430
<v Speaker 5>I just don't think like physically he</v>
<v Speaker 5>can win,</v>

1475
01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:46.360
<v Speaker 5>but could happen though is he and</v>
<v Speaker 5>hillary could team up and would be a</v>

1476
01:07:46.361 --> 01:07:47.950
<v Speaker 5>formidable twosomes so great.</v>

1477
01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.830
<v Speaker 5>I think it'd be hillary and then he</v>
<v Speaker 5>would be the vice president.</v>

1478
01:07:50.890 --> 01:07:53.560
<v Speaker 5>I can be crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so left.</v>

1479
01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.540
<v Speaker 5>If they said any nancy shit to each</v>
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

1480
01:07:55.790 --> 01:07:56.700
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where it gets.</v>

1481
01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:57.783
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got it.</v>

1482
01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:00.640
<v Speaker 5>You got to curb your words when you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>running,</v>

1483
01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:01.870
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to make sure that you don't</v>

1484
01:08:01.871 --> 01:08:03.970
<v Speaker 5>get to negatives so that you could join</v>
<v Speaker 5>forces.</v>

1485
01:08:04.270 --> 01:08:07.600
<v Speaker 5>Would they put a socialist on the ticket</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the United States of America?</v>

1486
01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:12.130
<v Speaker 5>While it's democratic socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not entirely like a socialist to</v>

1487
01:08:12.131 --> 01:08:13.680
<v Speaker 5>beat trump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they might be tricky.</v>

1488
01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:14.950
<v Speaker 5>It's tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's tricky,</v>

1489
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:16.940
<v Speaker 5>but he does have the support of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>youth.</v>

1490
01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:17.990
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

1491
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:20.590
<v Speaker 5>he's got people fired up socially.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1492
01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:24.110
<v Speaker 5>he sits down with people like killer</v>
<v Speaker 5>mike and as long term interviews.</v>

1493
01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:25.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's interesting.</v>

1494
01:08:25.670 --> 01:08:27.020
<v Speaker 5>He's an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's different.</v>

1495
01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.640
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't accept money from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I look,</v>

1496
01:08:28.641 --> 01:08:30.080
<v Speaker 5>I like a lot of what he stands for.</v>

1497
01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:33.380
<v Speaker 5>I think half of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked him way better than I like her.</v>

1498
01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:38.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a big fan of the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like long term politicians.</v>

1499
01:08:40.310 --> 01:08:41.900
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a big fan of those kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1500
01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:45.410
<v Speaker 5>There just seems like You just have too</v>
<v Speaker 5>many compromises along the way.</v>

1501
01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:50.240
<v Speaker 5>There's too much lIke weaving in and out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the system in the morning and toys in</v>

1502
01:08:50.241 --> 01:08:52.220
<v Speaker 5>the system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The more suspicious we should all be.</v>

1503
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:54.180
<v Speaker 5>She's way more intertwined in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>system,</v>

1504
01:08:54.181 --> 01:08:55.820
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but here's an example.</v>

1505
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:58.700
<v Speaker 5>I'm speed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'd shut down by proposition day,</v>

1506
01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:02.190
<v Speaker 5>which was written by a lawyer who</v>
<v Speaker 5>represents a bunch of dispensaries that</v>

1507
01:09:02.191 --> 01:09:06.860
<v Speaker 5>are predicted by proposition day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are some dots you can connect</v>

1508
01:09:06.861 --> 01:09:09.170
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So an attorney writes a law that</v>

1509
01:09:09.171 --> 01:09:11.600
<v Speaker 5>protects his clients and it gets passed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How does that happen?</v>

1510
01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:14.930
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I know the career politicians don't</v>

1511
01:09:14.931 --> 01:09:17.990
<v Speaker 5>make things better for us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1512
01:09:17.991 --> 01:09:20.510
<v Speaker 5>They only do if it's the will of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>people in the ceiling where they could</v>

1513
01:09:20.511 --> 01:09:22.490
<v Speaker 5>stay in office,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but usually it's not really just the</v>

1514
01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:24.170
<v Speaker 5>will of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's people aren't really paying</v>

1515
01:09:24.171 --> 01:09:26.390
<v Speaker 5>attention because the goal of these</v>
<v Speaker 5>corporations,</v>

1516
01:09:26.391 --> 01:09:29.300
<v Speaker 5>they get involved or donate your money</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the people don't even know what the</v>

1517
01:09:29.301 --> 01:09:31.400
<v Speaker 5>fuck is happening while it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

1518
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we have.</v>

1519
01:09:32.371 --> 01:09:33.480
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1520
01:09:33.481 --> 01:09:34.590
<v Speaker 2>Going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1521
01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:36.060
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of those laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1522
01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:37.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1523
01:09:37.410 --> 01:09:39.770
<v Speaker 2>we were dealing with a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1524
01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:41.720
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say that um,</v>

1525
01:09:42.570 --> 01:09:44.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>business had to be in operation before</v>

1526
01:09:44.881 --> 01:09:49.710
<v Speaker 2>2007 in order to be considered a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1527
01:09:49.711 --> 01:09:51.660
<v Speaker 2>now to be a viable business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1528
01:09:51.661 --> 01:09:56.640
<v Speaker 2>if you were in operation in 2007,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn in that wild west category.</v>

1529
01:09:56.641 --> 01:09:59.160
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you were already skating that line.</v>

1530
01:09:59.190 --> 01:10:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Do you want the players that were bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>players involved or do you want good</v>

1531
01:10:03.181 --> 01:10:07.090
<v Speaker 2>companies that want to put in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing,</v>

1532
01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:11.070
<v Speaker 2>a standard operating procedures that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for best practices?</v>

1533
01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:13.080
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't you want companies like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1534
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:15.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just laid off 40 people</v>

1535
01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:19.660
<v Speaker 5>well that are now in unemployment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>40 good people that really can't get</v>

1536
01:10:19.661 --> 01:10:23.830
<v Speaker 5>decent jobs anywhere that we're paid</v>
<v Speaker 5>well above minimum wage are now just</v>

1537
01:10:23.831 --> 01:10:28.540
<v Speaker 5>laid off and going on the government</v>
<v Speaker 5>dollar because it's because of this law</v>

1538
01:10:28.541 --> 01:10:30.610
<v Speaker 5>that nobody knows about and nobody read.</v>

1539
01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:31.410
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1540
01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:34.300
<v Speaker 2>and for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it came at a time where we,</v>

1541
01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:39.360
<v Speaker 2>we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>so excited about the future of working</v>

1542
01:10:39.531 --> 01:10:41.270
<v Speaker 2>with the board of equalization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were in,</v>

1543
01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:44.460
<v Speaker 2>in our largest expansion at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1544
01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:49.370
<v Speaker 2>we were going from the largest market</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was la to expanding throughout all</v>

1545
01:10:49.371 --> 01:10:51.380
<v Speaker 2>of California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we're still doing that,</v>

1546
01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:56.300
<v Speaker 2>but we just now have to not include la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was our main base.</v>

1547
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:59.390
<v Speaker 5>So in the law,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the law pertains to is you</v>

1548
01:10:59.391 --> 01:11:04.391
<v Speaker 5>delivering things to people that live in</v>
<v Speaker 5>homes because that home has not been</v>

1549
01:11:05.631 --> 01:11:08.180
<v Speaker 5>cleared because as a place to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>business,</v>

1550
01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:10.310
<v Speaker 5>because it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because of the zoning law,</v>

1551
01:11:10.311 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 5>only these 135 pre ico is allowed to</v>

1552
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.130
<v Speaker 3>operate at all within the city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody else can join the club.</v>

1553
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:22.430
<v Speaker 3>It's only that 1:35.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And any marijuana wanna vehicle is an</v>

1554
01:11:22.591 --> 01:11:27.240
<v Speaker 3>extension of the marijuana business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So every car is zoned like a building.</v>

1555
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:30.870
<v Speaker 4>So essentially they've limited the</v>
<v Speaker 4>number of stores that can operate the</v>

1556
01:11:30.871 --> 01:11:33.960
<v Speaker 4>number of dispensaries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you guys got pushed out because you</v>

1557
01:11:33.961 --> 01:11:37.110
<v Speaker 4>didn't have a grandfathered in.</v>

1558
01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:38.070
<v Speaker 2>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1559
01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:41.580
<v Speaker 2>that's number one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But number two is our base.</v>

1560
01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:45.330
<v Speaker 2>Where our business is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not in the city limits of la.</v>

1561
01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:50.480
<v Speaker 2>So by normal law for any other business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you follow the laws of the municipality</v>

1562
01:11:51.970 --> 01:11:54.690
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just convey through the streets of la</v>

1563
01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:59.850
<v Speaker 2>and there's a law on the California</v>
<v Speaker 2>books that says you can't stop someone</v>

1564
01:12:00.230 --> 01:12:03.990
<v Speaker 2>if your business is not in one</v>
<v Speaker 2>municipality and you drive to another</v>

1565
01:12:03.991 --> 01:12:06.810
<v Speaker 2>municipality to deliver something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't stop that.</v>

1566
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:11.310
<v Speaker 2>So we're not even in la and we have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to deal with this.</v>

1567
01:12:11.311 --> 01:12:16.240
<v Speaker 2>We're outside the city of la because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>city of la encompasses hollywood and and</v>

1568
01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:19.350
<v Speaker 2>a lot of la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're in places that people think</v>

1569
01:12:19.351 --> 01:12:21.960
<v Speaker 2>are la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like beverly hills or west hollywood.</v>

1570
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:23.370
<v Speaker 2>Those are in la.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lawsuit</v>

1571
01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:28.020
<v Speaker 3>says we're operating a sophisticated</v>
<v Speaker 3>delivery company running seven,</v>

1572
01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:32.070
<v Speaker 3>about seven hubs out of the la,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the la area.</v>

1573
01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:32.731
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1574
01:12:32.731 --> 01:12:36.540
<v Speaker 3>where are the addresses on the lawsuit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are none because we don't have any</v>

1575
01:12:36.541 --> 01:12:39.480
<v Speaker 3>locations inside the city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't roll orders out of there,</v>

1576
01:12:39.930 --> 01:12:43.290
<v Speaker 3>but it's not in the paperwork.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just so</v>

1577
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:45.310
<v Speaker 4>goofy though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what's the problem?</v>

1578
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:47.660
<v Speaker 4>This is the scary problem with big</v>
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>

1579
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:51.890
<v Speaker 4>This is the problem with government that</v>
<v Speaker 4>just has too many regulations,</v>

1580
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:54.710
<v Speaker 4>too much red tape and too much bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff like this</v>

1581
01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:57.260
<v Speaker 2>and there should be a balance of harm to</v>
<v Speaker 2>our company,</v>

1582
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:58.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1583
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:59.143
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1584
01:12:59.330 --> 01:13:04.330
<v Speaker 2>is trying to work within every</v>
<v Speaker 2>regulation of California working with</v>

1585
01:13:05.031 --> 01:13:06.900
<v Speaker 2>the state to create them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1586
01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:08.430
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me ask you this,</v>

1587
01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:12.750
<v Speaker 4>when is it going to be legal?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it an on the books to be in november</v>

1588
01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:13.800
<v Speaker 4>to november,</v>
<v Speaker 4>november?</v>

1589
01:13:13.801 --> 01:13:14.311
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1590
01:13:14.311 --> 01:13:18.420
<v Speaker 4>we have to organize like this is an</v>
<v Speaker 4>important thing for the future of</v>

1591
01:13:18.421 --> 01:13:20.720
<v Speaker 4>mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>

1592
01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:24.390
<v Speaker 4>must be done there and unfortunately</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's even infighting within the</v>

1593
01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.310
<v Speaker 4>cannabis industry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1594
01:13:26.311 --> 01:13:27.930
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what the problem that I ran</v>

1595
01:13:27.931 --> 01:13:29.810
<v Speaker 4>into when we were talking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1596
01:13:29.811 --> 01:13:34.050
<v Speaker 4>the legalization vote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the growers didn't want it to be legal</v>

1597
01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:37.290
<v Speaker 4>because they would make less money or of</v>
<v Speaker 4>course you guys are growing illegally.</v>

1598
01:13:37.291 --> 01:13:38.430
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

1599
01:13:38.431 --> 01:13:39.211
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

1600
01:13:39.211 --> 01:13:42.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm just telling you the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but where we're at</v>

1601
01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:45.670
<v Speaker 2>point now that if we don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get pushed out anyway</v>

1602
01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:50.110
<v Speaker 2>by bigger corporations that will come in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and be able to pay millions of dollars</v>

1603
01:13:50.111 --> 01:13:52.060
<v Speaker 2>for licensing and buildings and things</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1604
01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:54.890
<v Speaker 4>People are greedy and they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>shortsighted.</v>

1605
01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:56.740
<v Speaker 4>You can't be greedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't be shortsighted.</v>

1606
01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:57.920
<v Speaker 4>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a,</v>

1607
01:13:57.921 --> 01:14:02.600
<v Speaker 4>this is a global issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in these environments where these</v>

1608
01:14:02.601 --> 01:14:03.500
<v Speaker 4>people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to,</v>

1609
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:06.170
<v Speaker 4>we're going to make less money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bullshit expand.</v>

1610
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:08.170
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be legal now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dummy.</v>

01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:08.931
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1612
01:14:08.931 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have competition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so fucking they were making money.</v>

1613
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:14.830
<v Speaker 3>Why do you care if other people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>making money while you're concentrating</v>

1614
01:14:14.831 --> 01:14:16.960
<v Speaker 3>on that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just just enjoy life.</v>

1615
01:14:16.961 --> 01:14:18.700
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna have a bunch of potheads</v>
<v Speaker 3>mIllionaires around.</v>

1616
01:14:18.701 --> 01:14:18.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1617
01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.350
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1618
01:14:21.210 --> 01:14:26.210
<v Speaker 2>along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we were cultivating for our own</v>

1619
01:14:26.971 --> 01:14:29.170
<v Speaker 2>patient base,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were filed.</v>

1620
01:14:29.190 --> 01:14:33.560
<v Speaker 2>We follow the California a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The law is for California.</v>

1621
01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:38.570
<v Speaker 2>The cultivate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once a local licensing started becoming</v>

1622
01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:42.900
<v Speaker 2>possible for cultivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't before,</v>

1623
01:14:42.930 --> 01:14:45.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the governor sign this bill last year.</v>

1624
01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Now it's becoming possible we went out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we are now participating with desert</v>

1625
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:55.630
<v Speaker 2>hot springs for illegal cultivation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's going to be a place where the</v>

1626
01:14:56.221 --> 01:14:58.620
<v Speaker 2>police could come in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government could come in and inspect</v>

1627
01:14:58.621 --> 01:14:59.270
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1628
01:14:59.270 --> 01:15:04.270
<v Speaker 2>so we're moving forward with full</v>
<v Speaker 2>legalization on cultivation is as well</v>

1629
01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:06.930
<v Speaker 2>paying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paying everything you got to pay for</v>

1630
01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:09.380
<v Speaker 2>making sure that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>when you build your building,</v>

1632
01:15:10.711 --> 01:15:14.430
<v Speaker 2>it's built to the right specs again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the governments involved in every part</v>

1633
01:15:14.431 --> 01:15:16.350
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

1634
01:15:16.351 --> 01:15:19.890
<v Speaker 2>we're moving forward with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>regulations,</v>

1635
01:15:19.891 --> 01:15:21.840
<v Speaker 2>even though it's gonna cost us a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money aren't,</v>

1636

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the investment team that's behind it has</v>

1639
01:15:29.341 --> 01:15:31.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna cost a lot of money and we're</v>

1640
01:15:31.711 --> 01:15:33.840
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to make the money,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars that you're hoping</v>

<v Speaker 2>that can be regulated and you can open</v>
<v Speaker 2>up your doors and not hide.</v>

1644
01:15:44.430 --> 01:15:46.950
<v Speaker 2>Because we don't want to hide everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've ever done.</v>

1645
01:15:46.951 --> 01:15:49.770
<v Speaker 2>We haven't hidden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've said everything in the media.</v>

1651
01:15:58.610 --> 01:16:00.950
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why we got sued is because if you</v>

<v Speaker 3>find operating right now today that are</v>

1656
01:16:11.001 --> 01:16:15.290
<v Speaker 3>paper in an election year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe It's a conspiracy theory,</v>

1657
01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:18.860
<v Speaker 3>but all of the facts in our case are</v>
<v Speaker 3>dated 2014.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Is this a special year to politicians?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's a special year.</v>

1660
01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:30.380
<v Speaker 3>Hold on for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there are certain delivery companies</v>

<v Speaker 3>but they do 400.</v>

1663

<v Speaker 3>The do 400 illegal ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>golden snitches.</v>

1665

<v Speaker 3>limits of la,</v>

<v Speaker 3>But burbank does not like the industry.</v>

1677
01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:24.790
<v Speaker 3>Just like glendale and pasadena do not</v>

01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:38.870
<v Speaker 3>you're bringing crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they frightened the city council and</v>

1684
01:17:38.871 --> 01:17:40.610

<v Speaker 3>That of course they do.</v>

1694
01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:03.860
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows roles that people play</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably have to be as you fucking do</v>

1695
01:18:03.861 --> 01:18:06.310
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Wonder if Daniel Day lewis smokes</v>

1696
01:18:06.311 --> 01:18:07.060
<v Speaker 3>weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah.</v>

1697
01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:08.770
<v Speaker 3>Does we can talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1698
01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:11.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>privacy of certain patients</v>

1699
01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:15.370
<v Speaker 3>we try and say they're trying to say</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1700
01:18:15.371 --> 01:18:19.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying a lot of the actors you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would think are smoking weed while</v>

1701
01:18:19.031 --> 01:18:19.810
<v Speaker 3>they were acting.</v>

1702
01:18:19.810 --> 01:18:23.980
<v Speaker 3>They are interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course they are.</v>

1703
01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:26.200
<v Speaker 3>Whereas here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know several who don't have to name</v>

1704
01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:28.210
<v Speaker 3>names,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know a lot of people get super</v>

1705
01:18:28.211 --> 01:18:29.800
<v Speaker 3>high as fuck right before the do a</v>
<v Speaker 3>scene.</v>

1706
01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:31.720
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of makes sense.</v>

1707
01:18:32.850 --> 01:18:33.730
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1708
01:18:33.731 --> 01:18:35.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you've introduced me to some,</v>

1709
01:18:35.651 --> 01:18:37.240
<v Speaker 3>so certainly certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1710
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:38.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1711
01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:43.920
<v Speaker 3>they're just as many that you would</v>
<v Speaker 3>never suspect that that guy is a</v>

1712
01:18:43.930 --> 01:18:46.720
<v Speaker 3>everyday smoker and they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1713
01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:51.010
<v Speaker 3>and that's because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still stigma and when you're</v>

1714
01:18:51.011 --> 01:18:53.680
<v Speaker 3>living in a public life you need</v>
<v Speaker 3>privacy.</v>

1715
01:18:53.681 --> 01:18:56.470
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the reasons you need</v>

<v Speaker 3>Real estate prices are up 19 percent.</v>

<v Speaker 3>medical as they do for recreation.</v>

1747
01:20:16.831 --> 01:20:20.550
<v Speaker 1>It seems like denver would have the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate ever getting it needs to fucking</v>

1748
01:20:20.551 --> 01:20:25.410

<v Speaker 1>I think there's an answer to that</v>

1756
01:20:45.481 --> 01:20:49.260
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the best weed in Colorado is</v>

1757
01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:51.210
<v Speaker 1>still black market.</v>

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:54.090
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

1759
01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:58.290
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so fuckIng strong.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1761
01:21:00.241 --> 01:21:03.270

<v Speaker 1>deep and the deep end of the pool.</v>

1762
01:21:03.390 --> 01:21:06.900
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're talking all the pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Colorado or California,</v>

1763
01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:10.290

<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>

1765
01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:13.520
<v Speaker 1>And the difference between two hits of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado pot,</v>

1766
01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:16.560
<v Speaker 1>two hits of California pot is if you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>measure that,</v>

1767
01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.940
<v Speaker 1>write a book at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the joy you had.</v>

1768
01:21:19.941 --> 01:21:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Like what if you had like three joints?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those were just the three shittiest</v>

1769
01:21:22.951 --> 01:21:24.750
<v Speaker 1>joints in color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy it.</v>

1770
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Colorado.</v>

1771
01:21:27.031 --> 01:21:28.880
<v Speaker 1>I had some other weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be there thursday.</v>

1772
01:21:28.890 --> 01:21:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's super weed.</v>

1773
01:21:33.391 --> 01:21:36.030
<v Speaker 1>It's all the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these strains have gotten</v>

1774
01:21:36.031 --> 01:21:37.430
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1775
01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:39.570
<v Speaker 1>they're all over the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have this shit in New York now.</v>

1776
01:21:39.850 --> 01:21:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Does the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do get hired because of the elevation</v>

1777
01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:43.561
<v Speaker 1>for weed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1778
01:21:43.561 --> 01:21:45.380
<v Speaker 1>You have no air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's probably just shitty weed.</v>

1779
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:46.021
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1780
01:21:46.021 --> 01:21:47.950
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The alcohol gets too drunk or too.</v>

1781
01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:50.310
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1782
01:21:50.311 --> 01:21:51.300
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1783
01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:53.760
<v Speaker 1>it's just good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're great.</v>

1784
01:21:53.761 --> 01:21:54.594
<v Speaker 1>It's everywhere.</v>

1785
01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:01.460
<v Speaker 1>It's because of social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's becoming to a point where you just</v>

1786
01:22:02.161 --> 01:22:04.320
<v Speaker 1>can't deny it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought we were aLready there.</v>

1787
01:22:04.530 --> 01:22:09.330
<v Speaker 1>We're very close to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I'm politicians get older and</v>

1788
01:22:09.331 --> 01:22:11.370
<v Speaker 1>pushed out and younger politicians get</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1789
01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:14.610
<v Speaker 1>the toothpaste is out of the tube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going backwards.</v>

1790
01:22:14.850 --> 01:22:15.500
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1791
01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:18.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for la to be behind the times of the</v>

1792
01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:22.800
<v Speaker 1>rest of the state and for California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most progressive state in the</v>

1793
01:22:22.801 --> 01:22:27.801
<v Speaker 1>country to be behind the times of states</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Colorado and Alaska who were</v>

1794
01:22:29.581 --> 01:22:31.230
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making tax money.</v>

1795
01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:34.260
<v Speaker 1>It's the money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the money and the politics is too.</v>

1796
01:22:34.290 --> 01:22:36.210
<v Speaker 1>It's too intertwined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too,</v>

1797
01:22:36.330 --> 01:22:39.120
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the fabric of our society</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's broken,</v>

1798
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:40.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

1799
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:43.500
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully iT's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually pushed out.</v>

1800
01:22:44.370 --> 01:22:45.203
<v Speaker 1>But right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1801
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:47.550
<v Speaker 1>you have to deal with one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous examples of it,</v>

1802
01:22:47.610 --> 01:22:50.010
<v Speaker 1>which is marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most ridiculous examples</v>

1803
01:22:50.011 --> 01:22:53.850
<v Speaker 1>of all sorts of problems that I'm sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of businesses run into all</v>

1804
01:22:53.851 --> 01:22:57.630
<v Speaker 1>across the country that we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider because it doesn't play a part</v>

1805
01:22:57.631 --> 01:22:59.520
<v Speaker 1>in our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this one does.</v>

1806
01:22:59.521 --> 01:23:02.280
<v Speaker 1>And this one is really a nationwide</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom issue.</v>

1807
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:04.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what a lot of is about.</v>

1808
01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:06.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a freedom of consciousness issue.</v>

1809
01:23:06.670 --> 01:23:08.590
<v Speaker 4>And people don't look at it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They will get it.</v>

1810
01:23:08.591 --> 01:23:10.600
<v Speaker 4>Like it's law enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this,</v>

1811
01:23:10.601 --> 01:23:12.040
<v Speaker 4>it's crime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this,</v>

1812
01:23:12.041 --> 01:23:13.240
<v Speaker 4>it's children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this,</v>

1813
01:23:13.810 --> 01:23:15.110
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not what it is.</v>

1814
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:20.430
<v Speaker 4>It's a freedom of social consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a freedom of being able to express</v>

1815
01:23:22.391 --> 01:23:27.391
<v Speaker 4>yourself and the freedom of being able</v>
<v Speaker 4>to intoxicate yourself with a natural</v>

1816
01:23:27.521 --> 01:23:31.930
<v Speaker 4>plant and then what comes out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what everybody was worried</v>

1817
01:23:31.931 --> 01:23:34.630
<v Speaker 4>about more than anything in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies,</v>

1818
01:23:34.930 --> 01:23:37.300
<v Speaker 4>what they were worried about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then a sixties and the seventies is</v>

1819
01:23:37.301 --> 01:23:39.820
<v Speaker 4>what was coming out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They weren't worried about the</v>

1820
01:23:39.821 --> 01:23:42.910
<v Speaker 4>consequences of taking this drug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were worried about what's coming</v>

1821
01:23:42.911 --> 01:23:44.620
<v Speaker 4>out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're geTting all these people that</v>

1822
01:23:44.621 --> 01:23:48.580
<v Speaker 4>just won't tolerate all the usual</v>
<v Speaker 4>standard shit because they're constantly</v>

1823
01:23:48.581 --> 01:23:51.730
<v Speaker 4>resetting themselves and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>reconsidering their environment and</v>

1824
01:23:51.731 --> 01:23:56.080
<v Speaker 4>they're coming out with this whole new</v>
<v Speaker 4>movement of people like all the haight</v>

1825
01:23:56.081 --> 01:23:58.720
<v Speaker 4>ashbury shit and the sixties and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1826
01:23:58.721 --> 01:24:00.460
<v Speaker 4>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the music of the time.</v>

1827
01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:04.300
<v Speaker 4>So much of That had to do with pot and</v>
<v Speaker 4>so much of that has to do with lsd.</v>

1828
01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:06.190
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were just terrified of that</v>

1829
01:24:06.191 --> 01:24:08.140
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They will work when we talk about the</v>

1830
01:24:08.141 --> 01:24:12.160
<v Speaker 4>war on drugs and people blame nancy</v>
<v Speaker 4>reagan that started with nixon,</v>

1831
01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:13.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the late sixties,</v>

1832
01:24:13.781 --> 01:24:16.470
<v Speaker 4>early seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now the new stuff has come out.</v>

1833
01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:19.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you've seen it where they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying the nixon administration</v>

1834
01:24:19.301 --> 01:24:22.990
<v Speaker 4>purposely targeted marijuana because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were really going after the civil</v>

1835
01:24:22.991 --> 01:24:25.270
<v Speaker 4>rights leaders and the people that were</v>
<v Speaker 4>anti war movement.</v>

1836
01:24:25.271 --> 01:24:27.550
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they would go arrest them through pot</v>

1837
01:24:27.551 --> 01:24:30.880
<v Speaker 4>and that would be the get the back door</v>
<v Speaker 4>to just break up these organizations and</v>

1838
01:24:30.881 --> 01:24:32.300
<v Speaker 4>that this was a strategy they had</v>

1839
01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.540
<v Speaker 2>to the point that they asked a</v>
<v Speaker 2>universities to pull cannabis</v>

1840
01:24:36.541 --> 01:24:38.980
<v Speaker 2>information that was positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1841
01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:39.810
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1842
01:24:39.810 --> 01:24:40.643
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

1843
01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:41.663
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do.</v>

1844
01:24:41.770 --> 01:24:44.320
<v Speaker 4>They funded studies trying to find</v>
<v Speaker 4>things wrong with pot and they all,</v>

1845
01:24:44.321 --> 01:24:47.880
<v Speaker 4>all they found was good shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The donald tash can study is one that I</v>

1846
01:24:47.881 --> 01:24:51.360
<v Speaker 4>love where he was that study was to find</v>
<v Speaker 4>the connection between lung cancer and</v>

1847
01:24:51.361 --> 01:24:53.670
<v Speaker 4>smoking cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it turned out he could find no</v>

1848
01:24:53.671 --> 01:24:55.920
<v Speaker 4>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It actually showed that there could be</v>

1849
01:24:56.010 --> 01:24:56.843
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1850
01:24:56.930 --> 01:24:59.820
<v Speaker 4>a protective effect of cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how I'm still alive.</v>

1851
01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:04.260
<v Speaker 4>Maybe a lot of people like you that</v>
<v Speaker 4>smoke cigarettes and smoke pot.</v>

1852
01:25:04.261 --> 01:25:06.840
<v Speaker 4>It might actually even started the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1853
01:25:07.170 --> 01:25:08.130
<v Speaker 2>NO,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't.</v>

1854

<v Speaker 2>fiber myalgia and myalgia.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he showed I take these 45 pills a day</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's crazy just trying to swallow them.</v>

1863
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:39.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

1864
01:25:39.210 --> 01:25:42.420
<v Speaker 2>But he said these cost me thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars,</v>

1865
01:25:42.510 --> 01:25:46.020
<v Speaker 2>however I don't pay for them because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's paid by insurance.</v>

1866
01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:51.200
<v Speaker 2>These I pay almost 45,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$50 a day in edibles and,</v>

1867
01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:53.430
<v Speaker 2>and I could just eat those instead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

1868
01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:57.420
<v Speaker 2>none of this is paid for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't have the money to pay $50 a</v>

1869
01:25:57.421 --> 01:26:01.890
<v Speaker 2>day for my medication.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1871
01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:08.020
<v Speaker 2>because he can't afford It</v>

1872
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:12.780
<v Speaker 5>to live pharmaceutical side of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of this conversation is just,</v>

<v Speaker 5>nice of you to give that to him by the</v>

1874
01:26:16.471 --> 01:26:19.410
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But hearing that he's eaten $45 or the</v>

1875
01:26:19.411 --> 01:26:22.190
<v Speaker 5>edibles day makes me want to shit my</v>
<v Speaker 5>pants and scary.</v>

<v Speaker 5>What kind of a tornado of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy flying around in all day,</v>

1877
01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:30.150
<v Speaker 5>how many milligrams we talking for 45</v>
<v Speaker 5>bucks worth of weed.</v>

<v Speaker 5>How many milligrams is this motherfucker</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking in?</v>

1879
01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:35.400
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have no lungs.</v>

1880
01:26:35.670 --> 01:26:38.250
<v Speaker 5>You take whatever you need to do to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>through that day.</v>

1881
01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:39.300
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we know for sure.</v>

1882
01:26:39.301 --> 01:26:42.870
<v Speaker 5>But I'm thinking $45 where the chiba</v>
<v Speaker 5>chews would put you in another</v>

1883
01:26:42.871 --> 01:26:44.850
<v Speaker 5>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come on time.</v>

1884
01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:46.980
<v Speaker 5>There's a shit hacky sack.</v>

1885
01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:51.860
<v Speaker 2>We're talking somewhere around 500</v>
<v Speaker 2>milligrams a day.</v>

1886
01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1887
01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:54.290
<v Speaker 2>so it's not tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1888
01:26:54.291 --> 01:26:56.870
<v Speaker 2>I've seen joey diaz he a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars</v>

1889
01:26:56.930 --> 01:26:59.090
<v Speaker 5>right time saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if he's getting cheaper,</v>

1890
01:26:59.091 --> 01:27:03.260

<v Speaker 5>which are like a really potent,</v>

1891
01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:07.010
<v Speaker 5>an easy way to get them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>40th five bucks is not 500 milligrams.</v>

1892
01:27:07.011 --> 01:27:09.970
<v Speaker 5>You can give one 500 milligram one for a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot less than that,</v>

1893
01:27:09.971 --> 01:27:11.930
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>For 15 bucks.</v>

1894
01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:15.710
<v Speaker 5>So spend 45 bucks and he's buying the</v>
<v Speaker 5>good shit.</v>

1895
01:27:16.010 --> 01:27:18.800

<v Speaker 5>sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This fucking guys living in an alternate</v>

01:27:50.391 --> 01:27:51.920
<v Speaker 5>than just smoking it,</v>

<v Speaker 5>read them and what do I don't know what</v>

1943
01:29:19.761 --> 01:29:22.390
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about because It needs</v>
<v Speaker 5>more responsible motherfucker.</v>

1944
01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:24.140
<v Speaker 5>You can't just leave this dude with your</v>
<v Speaker 5>plans.</v>

1945
01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:24.990
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

1946
01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:26.890
<v Speaker 5>go get more nitrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1947
01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:28.150
<v Speaker 5>hi baby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For me,</v>

1948
01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:30.710
<v Speaker 5>take my baby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just feed it when it cries.</v>

1949
01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:31.700
<v Speaker 5>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got,</v>

1950
01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:32.300
<v Speaker 5>I got</v>

1951
01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:34.970
<v Speaker 2>back from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a trip late leading into my,</v>

1952
01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:35.771
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1953
01:29:35.771 --> 01:29:40.130
<v Speaker 2>a growth cycle and I opened it up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see webs,</v>

1954
01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:43.550
<v Speaker 2>well those aren't spiders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are spider mites and that's the</v>

1955
01:29:43.551 --> 01:29:45.590
<v Speaker 2>worst thing you could ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever get.</v>

1956
01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:48.890
<v Speaker 2>I grew in Ohio last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my whole entire crop spit like months</v>

1957
01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:51.620
<v Speaker 2>growing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this scared of helicopters with a heat</v>

1958
01:29:51.621 --> 01:29:55.940
<v Speaker 2>seeking thing and all our money was sunk</v>
<v Speaker 2>into this,</v>

1959
01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:57.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1960
01:29:57.531 --> 01:30:01.280
<v Speaker 2>all of a four months time to make it</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1961
01:30:01.281 --> 01:30:02.540
<v Speaker 2>And I was just defeated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1962
01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:04.430
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we gonna do?</v>

1963
01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:07.070
<v Speaker 2>And so we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had the fight it to fight those</v>

1964
01:30:07.071 --> 01:30:09.320
<v Speaker 2>spider mites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did everything we could,</v>

1965
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:13.970
<v Speaker 2>including buying 10,000 ladybugs which</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat these things and releasing them in</v>

1966
01:30:13.971 --> 01:30:16.160
<v Speaker 2>this tent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A foot from where I'm sleeping on his</v>

1967
01:30:16.161 --> 01:30:16.620
<v Speaker 2>couch.</v>

1968
01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:19.440
<v Speaker 5>I bought them on amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bought like a zillion lady bugs on</v>

1969
01:30:19.441 --> 01:30:21.870
<v Speaker 5>amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We just released them into my living</v>

1970
01:30:21.871 --> 01:30:22.320
<v Speaker 5>room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1971
01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:23.420
<v Speaker 5>we buy them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1972
01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:27.880
<v Speaker 5>They didn't even do a bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 5>plants that are girls.</v>

1973
01:30:27.881 --> 01:30:28.780
<v Speaker 5>So we bought ladybugs.</v>

1974
01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:30.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they worked.</v>

1975
01:30:30.171 --> 01:30:33.290
<v Speaker 2>But they didn't exactly work fast enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were dying because we're.</v>

1976
01:30:34.230 --> 01:30:36.230
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we had to get predator mites,</v>

1977
01:30:36.231 --> 01:30:40.250
<v Speaker 2>which were other little creepy crawly</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that we had to release right</v>

1978
01:30:40.251 --> 01:30:42.670
<v Speaker 2>where I was sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we released it.</v>

1979
01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:43.803
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1980
01:30:43.810 --> 01:30:44.960
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly what it was.</v>

1981
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.950
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you could look at it under a</v>

1982
01:30:46.951 --> 01:30:48.120
<v Speaker 5>microscope,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would be alert,</v>

1983
01:30:48.121 --> 01:30:51.300
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a fucking storm troopers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>starship troopers,</v>

1984
01:30:52.890 --> 01:30:54.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lord of the rings.</v>

1985
01:30:54.421 --> 01:30:56.770
<v Speaker 2>Things were flying down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating each other things with crime and</v>

1986
01:30:56.771 --> 01:30:57.770
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>

1987
01:30:57.820 --> 01:30:59.340
<v Speaker 2>so what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the long story?</v>

1988
01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:00.141
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1989
01:31:00.141 --> 01:31:02.790
<v Speaker 2>so we got rid of them and had had bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>weed.</v>

1990
01:31:02.850 --> 01:31:05.560
<v Speaker 2>We extracted it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had re read some papers online.</v>

1991
01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:07.110
<v Speaker 2>We extract and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we going to do with this?</v>

1992
01:31:07.230 --> 01:31:08.460
<v Speaker 2>And we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1993
01:31:08.461 --> 01:31:10.620
<v Speaker 2>let's make some edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his wife,</v>

1994
01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:12.910
<v Speaker 5>so hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's bad.</v>

1995
01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:13.721
<v Speaker 5>Weed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bad.</v>

1996
01:31:13.721 --> 01:31:16.130
<v Speaker 5>We'd consider it because you can't smoke</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1997
01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:17.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you can still turn into edibles.</v>

1998
01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:19.470
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looked like shit out of,</v>

1999
01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:22.640
<v Speaker 5>out of the litter box.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was garbage bin geno's like fuck it,</v>

2000
01:31:22.641 --> 01:31:24.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm smoking it mode.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm confused.</v>

2001
01:31:24.351 --> 01:31:27.050
<v Speaker 5>Explain like why did it look bad?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because the mites chewed it up.</v>

2002
01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:27.893
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>

2003
01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:31.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lady bug with a lady bug wings.</v>

2004
01:31:31.730 --> 01:31:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

2005
01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:36.290
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's also things called neem oil,</v>

2006
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:40.040
<v Speaker 2>which is a natural pesticide that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>also helps in killing,</v>

2007
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:41.360
<v Speaker 2>killing these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

2008
01:31:41.570 --> 01:31:45.170
<v Speaker 2>in a growth cycle you shouldn't use it</v>
<v Speaker 2>near the end because then it's going to</v>

2009
01:31:45.171 --> 01:31:46.850
<v Speaker 2>be on the flowers that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke.</v>

2010
01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:49.490
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you extract the thc out of it,</v>

2011
01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:52.580
<v Speaker 2>it's no longer on that plant material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're getting rid of the plant</v>

2012
01:31:52.581 --> 01:31:55.550
<v Speaker 2>material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The neem oil that's on it won't</v>

2013
01:31:55.551 --> 01:31:56.660
<v Speaker 2>translate into an excel.</v>

2014
01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:57.701
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

2015
01:31:57.701 --> 01:32:00.310
<v Speaker 5>So you use the pesticide unfortunately,</v>

2016
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:02.870
<v Speaker 3>late in the cycle and it made the pot</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad to smoke,</v>

2017
01:32:02.930 --> 01:32:04.920
<v Speaker 3>but you can still extract the thc from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2018
01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:06.070
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a natural oil.</v>

2019
01:32:06.071 --> 01:32:06.590
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2020
01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:07.081
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2021
01:32:07.081 --> 01:32:09.820
<v Speaker 3>it works as a pesticide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was so baffled.</v>

2022
01:32:09.850 --> 01:32:11.230
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is it bad weed?</v>

2023
01:32:11.231 --> 01:32:12.430
<v Speaker 3>And then it's good weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2024
01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:14.710
<v Speaker 3>so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd good gummy bears.</v>

2025
01:32:14.770 --> 01:32:15.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2026
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:16.720
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I started going,</v>

2027
01:32:16.750 --> 01:32:20.350
<v Speaker 3>what is the process of extracting thc</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the flowers?</v>

2028
01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:23.290
<v Speaker 3>It's like breaking bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that it?</v>

2029
01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:25.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My kitchen looked like a meth lab for</v>

2030
01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:27.380
<v Speaker 3>like three months is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a sox.</v>

2031
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:29.540
<v Speaker 3>Lydia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had to have you done this before</v>

2032
01:32:29.570 --> 01:32:31.900
<v Speaker 3>where you were experimenting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you watch a youtube video?</v>

2033
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:36.990
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea it even existed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found a paper from like 1976 or ucla</v>

2034
01:32:37.601 --> 01:32:40.030
<v Speaker 3>scientists that multi solvent extraction</v>
<v Speaker 3>academy.</v>

2035
01:32:40.031 --> 01:32:41.690
<v Speaker 3>Middle age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can find it online now.</v>

2036
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.190
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a how to manual and how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do extraction.</v>

2037
01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:45.761
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

2038
01:32:45.761 --> 01:32:48.700
<v Speaker 3>Neither one of you guys are scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're technology guys.</v>

2039
01:32:48.710 --> 01:32:50.440
<v Speaker 3>I got scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2040
01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:53.090
<v Speaker 3>I know I got married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2041
01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:57.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm techie at homework.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had you ever done any chemical work like</v>

2042
01:32:57.551 --> 01:33:01.000
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Using solvents and extracting l elements</v>

2043
01:33:01.001 --> 01:33:04.000
<v Speaker 3>from plants?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not professionally.</v>

2044
01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:05.470
<v Speaker 2>He age is humble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2045
01:33:05.471 --> 01:33:07.150
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a member of mensa.</v>

2046
01:33:07.410 --> 01:33:11.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got very blessed to have a brother</v>

2047
01:33:11.051 --> 01:33:13.930
<v Speaker 2>who's very intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2048
01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:16.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was just defeated,</v>

2049
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:18.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a bad crop.</v>

2050
01:33:18.311 --> 01:33:20.110
<v Speaker 2>I wasted all oUr money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasted our time.</v>

2051
01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:25.620
<v Speaker 2>He turned lemons into lemonade because</v>
<v Speaker 2>luckily he's smart enough to say what</v>

2052
01:33:26.171 --> 01:33:29.560
<v Speaker 2>else can we do with this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he went out and found a way for us</v>

2053
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:30.663
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

2054
01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:33.190
<v Speaker 3>Did you practice or do you just dive</v>
<v Speaker 3>right in?</v>

2055
01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:34.600
<v Speaker 3>Would you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't.</v>

2056
01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:36.760
<v Speaker 3>It was like a six week r and d process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2057
01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:39.460
<v Speaker 3>So we did the extraction through with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2058
01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:41.160
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of different chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2059
01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:45.430
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately ethanol worked really well</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then every night at 11 I would give</v>

2060
01:33:45.490 --> 01:33:49.300
<v Speaker 3>gino a dose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like on a cookie or something at 11 and</v>

2061
01:33:49.301 --> 01:33:54.301
<v Speaker 3>then I would wait 45 minutes in a mocked</v>
<v Speaker 3>up in your basement to pretty much keep</v>

2062
01:33:57.140 --> 01:34:02.140
<v Speaker 3>it rubs the lotion on skin every night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then finally one day I give gina the</v>

2063
01:34:02.501 --> 01:34:03.580
<v Speaker 3>dose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1145,</v>

2064
01:34:03.581 --> 01:34:04.630
<v Speaker 3>is that how you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2065
01:34:04.631 --> 01:34:06.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2066
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.851
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

2067
01:34:06.851 --> 01:34:08.770
<v Speaker 3>That's the recipe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's in my journal.</v>

2068
01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:12.910
<v Speaker 3>And that was kind of how we got into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>industry was with that extraction</v>

2069
01:34:12.911 --> 01:34:13.930
<v Speaker 3>process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that recipe,</v>

2070
01:34:13.931 --> 01:34:16.360
<v Speaker 3>that day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I've always wondered like this,</v>

2071
01:34:16.361 --> 01:34:21.070
<v Speaker 3>when you use all those chemicals and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>extract something from a plant or those</v>

2072
01:34:21.071 --> 01:34:24.610
<v Speaker 3>chemicals in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there a residue on the extraction?</v>

2073
01:34:24.610 --> 01:34:27.220
<v Speaker 3>Depends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were using ethanol which is alcohol,</v>

2074
01:34:27.250 --> 01:34:30.130
<v Speaker 3>but then we were making candy which</v>
<v Speaker 3>burns off the alcohol,</v>

2075
01:34:30.370 --> 01:34:35.370
<v Speaker 3>so there's no alcohol in the candy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now you have the thc which is inside</v>

2076
01:34:36.011 --> 01:34:38.830
<v Speaker 3>the candy and now you can and now we</v>
<v Speaker 3>would.</v>

2077
01:34:38.850 --> 01:34:43.030
<v Speaker 3>We would do car box relating the flower</v>
<v Speaker 3>before anybody was doing that and what</v>

2078
01:34:43.031 --> 01:34:47.170
<v Speaker 3>that means is you activate the flower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can't just take bud and eat it</v>

2079
01:34:47.171 --> 01:34:48.400
<v Speaker 3>and get stoned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It won't work.</v>

2080
01:34:49.130 --> 01:34:51.820
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you need something fat soluble.</v>

2081
01:34:52.210 --> 01:34:55.360
<v Speaker 3>You need to convert it to thc acid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you do that with heat,</v>

2082
01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 3>so you smoke it or you do that with fat</v>

2083
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.170
<v Speaker 4>like lipids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You boil it and butter.</v>

2084
01:35:00.171 --> 01:35:02.120
<v Speaker 4>Make brownies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so fuck.</v>

2085
01:35:02.121 --> 01:35:04.670
<v Speaker 4>Did people figure that out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's brilliant.</v>

2086
01:35:04.671 --> 01:35:06.800
<v Speaker 4>It's genius.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or you could do it with alcohol and</v>

2087
01:35:06.801 --> 01:35:09.230
<v Speaker 4>that's ultimately what we'll use is</v>
<v Speaker 4>alcohol extracts.</v>

2088
01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:11.600
<v Speaker 4>Butane works as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I mean is how the fuck did</v>

2089
01:35:11.601 --> 01:35:15.500
<v Speaker 4>people figure out that you had to burn</v>
<v Speaker 4>it in order to use it because they're</v>

2090
01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:18.140
<v Speaker 4>probably eating it long before they knew</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could get your high.</v>

2091
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:21.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it civilizations amazing.</v>

2092
01:35:21.021 --> 01:35:23.000
<v Speaker 4>Like how did they figure out if we eat</v>
<v Speaker 4>this route?</v>

2093
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:26.190
<v Speaker 4>Iowasca works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but otherwise or nut trees doesn't,</v>

2094
01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:28.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the trees told us</v>

2095
01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.790
<v Speaker 4>that was probably true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They use tobacco in those iowasca</v>

2096
01:35:34.791 --> 01:35:36.200
<v Speaker 4>rituals apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2097
01:35:36.201 --> 01:35:40.520
<v Speaker 4>We're right before you go onto their</v>
<v Speaker 4>blow tobacco smoke on your face and was</v>

2098
01:35:40.670 --> 01:35:42.200
<v Speaker 4>just to get you ready to vomit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2099
01:35:42.201 --> 01:35:43.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know if it's that.</v>

2100
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:47.390
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a stimulating effect of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>nicotine has some sort of a kickstart</v>

2101
01:35:47.630 --> 01:35:49.610
<v Speaker 4>like terence mckenna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he would take mushrooms,</v>

2102
01:35:49.611 --> 01:35:51.770
<v Speaker 4>what he would do is he would take them</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you would wait.</v>

2103
01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:55.940
<v Speaker 4>They kick in like an hour or so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So while he was waiting for them to kick</v>

2104
01:35:55.941 --> 01:35:58.730
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was just rolled joints as motherfuck</v>

2105
01:35:58.731 --> 01:36:03.731
<v Speaker 4>would roll joints for an hour and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then go and start going and when the</v>

2106
01:36:06.321 --> 01:36:08.780
<v Speaker 4>pot really kicked in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when he would get really,</v>

2107
01:36:08.781 --> 01:36:10.940
<v Speaker 4>really high,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be right when the mushrooms</v>

2108
01:36:10.941 --> 01:36:14.900
<v Speaker 4>had come in like a giant tidal wave and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said he could see it coming,</v>

2109
01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:18.860
<v Speaker 4>he could see it coming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could feel it in the ground and it</v>

2110
01:36:18.861 --> 01:36:21.710
<v Speaker 4>seemed like there's no way no one else</v>
<v Speaker 4>is experiencing this.</v>

2111
01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:26.480
<v Speaker 4>It's just like this gigantic wave is</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming and there's nothing you can do to</v>

2112
01:36:26.481 --> 01:36:27.314
<v Speaker 4>stop it.</v>

2113
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:29.930
<v Speaker 4>And that's how he would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he would use marijuana smoke,</v>

2114
01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:31.850
<v Speaker 4>just sort of instigate the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2115
01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:34.460
<v Speaker 4>the mushroom experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which totally makes sense.</v>

2116
01:36:34.780 --> 01:36:39.110
<v Speaker 4>But that's a warrior that it will do</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of experimentation dive dude,</v>

2117
01:36:39.111 --> 01:36:41.690
<v Speaker 4>when deep healing deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he went deep,</v>

2118
01:36:41.691 --> 01:36:43.670
<v Speaker 4>maybe two months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She died of a brain cancer,</v>

2119
01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:46.880
<v Speaker 4>a brain tumor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2120
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:49.400
<v Speaker 4>who knows if that was hereditary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows what that was,</v>

2121
01:36:50.150 --> 01:36:53.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it related in a way to expanding</v>

2122
01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:55.130
<v Speaker 4>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're attempting to expand in</v>

2123
01:36:55.131 --> 01:36:56.570
<v Speaker 4>consciousness through drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most likely,</v>

2124
01:36:56.571 --> 01:36:58.910
<v Speaker 4>not especially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was really critical of the idea</v>

2125
01:36:58.911 --> 01:37:02.480
<v Speaker 4>that marijuana was cure a cure for</v>
<v Speaker 4>cancer because he was like,</v>

2126
01:37:02.481 --> 01:37:04.490
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am telling you I have cancer and I</v>

2127
01:37:04.491 --> 01:37:07.160
<v Speaker 4>smoked pot all day constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2128
01:37:07.161 --> 01:37:11.480
<v Speaker 4>I am yoUr poster boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if it was something that cured</v>

2129
01:37:11.481 --> 01:37:13.220
<v Speaker 4>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would not have cancer because you</v>

2130
01:37:13.221 --> 01:37:16.700
<v Speaker 4>cannot smoke more pot than me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like mckenna was just high all day.</v>

2131
01:37:17.450 --> 01:37:20.480
<v Speaker 4>But there's so many different cancers</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so many different types of weed.</v>

2132
01:37:20.481 --> 01:37:22.280
<v Speaker 4>Who knows what's what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to research.</v>

2133
01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:24.200
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what's really supposed to be the</v>

2134
01:37:24.201 --> 01:37:27.230
<v Speaker 4>most effectIve and chino you help my</v>
<v Speaker 4>friend when he,</v>

2135
01:37:27.231 --> 01:37:29.750
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his mom had an Issue with this and this</v>

2136
01:37:29.751 --> 01:37:32.900
<v Speaker 4>is something about genome who'd never</v>
<v Speaker 4>advertised himself,</v>

2137
01:37:32.901 --> 01:37:37.700
<v Speaker 4>but he hooked my friend up with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>this cannabis oil.</v>

2138
01:37:37.850 --> 01:37:41.540
<v Speaker 4>What's really expensive stuff and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>did it just to help his mom,</v>

2139
01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:43.970
<v Speaker 4>but just to help his dad rather.</v>

2140
01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a good dude.</v>

2141
01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:47.150
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2142
01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:50.930
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about stage four cancer</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that point.</v>

2143
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:56.350
<v Speaker 2>So there wasn't much a ever hope that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to turn around and cure it.</v>

2144
01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:01.590
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to ease the last few months of life,</v>

2145
01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:03.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

2146
01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:08.780
<v Speaker 2>was working and happening there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot more quality of life,</v>

2147
01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:13.170
<v Speaker 2>which for the patient that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was great,</v>

2148
01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.900
<v Speaker 2>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute most important,</v>

2149
01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:19.170
<v Speaker 2>but also for our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our friend that we're talking about,</v>

2150
01:38:19.410 --> 01:38:24.410
<v Speaker 2>it was great for him because he got the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last few months of life together with</v>

2151
01:38:25.411 --> 01:38:29.790
<v Speaker 2>his loved one in a better way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in a comatose a setting,</v>

2152
01:38:29.791 --> 01:38:34.050
<v Speaker 2>which he was dealing with for a while</v>
<v Speaker 2>before we got got,</v>

2153
01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:34.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2154
01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:35.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

2155
01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:37.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rick simpson oil regimen.</v>

2156
01:38:37.210 --> 01:38:39.010
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it definitely needs to be investigAted</v>

2157
01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:42.940
<v Speaker 4>because there's so many people that have</v>
<v Speaker 4>had beneficial effects from it.</v>

2158
01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.230
<v Speaker 4>It just seems insane to not have some</v>
<v Speaker 4>large scale scientific research being</v>

2159
01:38:47.231 --> 01:38:49.870
<v Speaker 4>done right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like just humanity as a whole.</v>

2160
01:38:49.871 --> 01:38:52.900
<v Speaker 4>Like we kind of owe it to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you,</v>

2161
01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:55.030
<v Speaker 4>you're not thinking about it right now</v>
<v Speaker 4>because your loved ones don't have</v>

2162
01:38:55.031 --> 01:38:56.740
<v Speaker 4>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if this turns out to be really</v>

2163
01:38:56.741 --> 01:38:59.740
<v Speaker 4>legit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this could be another reason why we need</v>

2164
01:38:59.741 --> 01:39:04.741
<v Speaker 4>to reconsider this whole ban on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>illegal sale federally of marijuana.</v>

2165
01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:09.270
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous if it can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you really taking this oil and you're</v>

2166
01:39:09.271 --> 01:39:12.640
<v Speaker 4>reduce reducing tumors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which has been reported in just a</v>

2167
01:39:12.641 --> 01:39:15.130
<v Speaker 4>shitload of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including friends of mine.</v>

2168
01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:18.790
<v Speaker 4>I know people that have had cancer and</v>
<v Speaker 4>had their cancer reduced by taking</v>

2169
01:39:18.791 --> 01:39:23.200
<v Speaker 4>cannabis oil and I know people whose</v>
<v Speaker 4>parents had it and got their.</v>

2170
01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:27.190
<v Speaker 4>Their tumors reduced because of it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>autistic kids like the caesars and stuff</v>

2171
01:39:27.191 --> 01:39:29.860
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>our friend and his kid was going from</v>

2172
01:39:29.861 --> 01:39:31.660
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was having seizures all day.</v>

2173
01:39:31.670 --> 01:39:33.570
<v Speaker 4>takes this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He hasn't had a seizure in six months.</v>

2174
01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:36.850
<v Speaker 4>You look at jaden and and charlotte and</v>
<v Speaker 4>ali's,</v>

2175
01:39:36.910 --> 01:39:38.110
<v Speaker 4>these kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How caN you.</v>

2176
01:39:38.170 --> 01:39:40.000
<v Speaker 4>How can you tell the parents?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2177
01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:41.650
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter what state you're in,</v>

2178
01:39:41.651 --> 01:39:43.030
<v Speaker 4>how can you tell a parent know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's.</v>

2179
01:39:43.031 --> 01:39:45.220
<v Speaker 4>I think that's when your politics</v>
<v Speaker 4>changed and when it affects you</v>

2180
01:39:45.221 --> 01:39:47.020
<v Speaker 4>personally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It definitely happens.</v>

2181
01:39:47.050 --> 01:39:49.600
<v Speaker 4>It definitely happens and I've seen</v>
<v Speaker 4>quite a few stories of that,</v>

2182
01:39:49.601 --> 01:39:51.520
<v Speaker 4>of people that have children that have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2183
01:39:51.610 --> 01:39:55.390
<v Speaker 4>serious seizure issues and as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got them on the medical marijuana</v>

2184
01:39:55.391 --> 01:39:59.950
<v Speaker 4>and just stopped and we have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>really bad prejudices about marijuana</v>

2185
01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:04.600
<v Speaker 4>and we need to expose them like as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>society because they're holding a lot of</v>

2186
01:40:04.601 --> 01:40:05.434
<v Speaker 4>people back.</v>

2187
01:40:05.530 --> 01:40:09.160
<v Speaker 4>I know they held me back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They made me until I was 30 years old.</v>

2188
01:40:09.161 --> 01:40:11.250
<v Speaker 4>I thought that was for idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it really did.</v>

2189
01:40:11.290 --> 01:40:15.250
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people do and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's important to let them know.</v>

2190
01:40:15.251 --> 01:40:17.600
<v Speaker 4>Not only is it not for idiots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2191
01:40:17.650 --> 01:40:19.840
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a tool that you can use it,</v>

2192
01:40:20.230 --> 01:40:21.790
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can benefit you.</v>

2193
01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:25.090
<v Speaker 4>Like this is not a benign substance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's slippery,</v>

2194
01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:28.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all other psychoactive substances,</v>

2195
01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:32.650
<v Speaker 4>if you are on the wrong path mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you could go off the deep end with</v>

2196
01:40:32.651 --> 01:40:33.820
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like everything else,</v>

2197
01:40:33.821 --> 01:40:35.350
<v Speaker 4>like alcohol or anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

2198
01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:38.910
<v Speaker 2>someone who I respect a lot like graham</v>
<v Speaker 2>hancock,</v>

2199
01:40:38.911 --> 01:40:43.911
<v Speaker 2>who have you had on the show a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a high heavy user and he got to a</v>

2200
01:40:44.461 --> 01:40:45.294
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2201
01:40:45.570 --> 01:40:47.130
<v Speaker 2>where he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

2202
01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:50.280
<v Speaker 2>my relationship is not good with</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana anymore.</v>

2203
01:40:50.281 --> 01:40:53.830
<v Speaker 2>And he took a long break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think two to three years.</v>

2204
01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:57.550
<v Speaker 2>He took a long break and then said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

2205
01:40:57.610 --> 01:41:01.390
<v Speaker 2>things have changed in my life now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I could go back and have that</v>

2206
01:41:01.391 --> 01:41:04.960
<v Speaker 2>relationShip start again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And from what I,</v>

2207
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:08.110
<v Speaker 2>what I understand mostly from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>

2208
01:41:08.130 --> 01:41:08.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

2209
01:41:08.770 --> 01:41:11.590
<v Speaker 2>from him being on the podcast last time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2210
01:41:11.770 --> 01:41:15.970
<v Speaker 2>he is now in a better relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana</v>

2211
01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:18.870
<v Speaker 4>that he was in an abusive relationship</v>
<v Speaker 4>with himself.</v>

2212
01:41:19.260 --> 01:41:21.300
<v Speaker 4>And marijuana was just playing a factor</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that.</v>

2213
01:41:21.380 --> 01:41:22.800
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the one who got them high.</v>

2214
01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:23.631
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>

2215
01:41:23.631 --> 01:41:26.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm behind on the show when he was a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who was it took two or three years</v>

2216
01:41:26.971 --> 01:41:27.481
<v Speaker 4>sober.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2217
01:41:27.481 --> 01:41:28.730
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fine.</v>

2218
01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:32.210
<v Speaker 4>Just come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're the smartest dude ever.</v>

2219
01:41:32.310 --> 01:41:35.370
<v Speaker 4>He loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he and he opened up when I,</v>

2220
01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:36.540
<v Speaker 4>when I gave it to him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my god.</v>

2221
01:41:36.541 --> 01:41:39.870
<v Speaker 4>They opened up like a flower who took</v>
<v Speaker 4>one hit and then he relaxed and he was</v>

2222
01:41:39.871 --> 01:41:43.440
<v Speaker 4>smiling and laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're having a good time and he went on</v>

2223
01:41:43.441 --> 01:41:45.420
<v Speaker 4>this rant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god.</v>

2224
01:41:45.450 --> 01:41:47.970
<v Speaker 4>It was epic rant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>epic rant,</v>

2225
01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:50.610
<v Speaker 4>and I remember thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2226
01:41:50.611 --> 01:41:55.380
<v Speaker 4>that had to be cannabis inspired because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was so like emotionally connected to</v>

2227
01:41:55.381 --> 01:41:58.020
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was essentially like sort of</v>

2228
01:41:58.021 --> 01:42:02.850
<v Speaker 4>validating his life work because he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>really heavily criticized many,</v>

2229
01:42:02.851 --> 01:42:07.851
<v Speaker 4>many times where people just completely</v>
<v Speaker 4>ignored any of the potentially positive</v>

2230
01:42:08.911 --> 01:42:12.600
<v Speaker 4>aspects of what he was saying and just</v>
<v Speaker 4>was trying to shit on all they're trying</v>

2231
01:42:12.601 --> 01:42:16.020
<v Speaker 4>to shit on all of these theories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as time has gone on,</v>

2232
01:42:16.350 --> 01:42:19.200
<v Speaker 4>it's been more and more apparent that he</v>
<v Speaker 4>was right the whole time.</v>

2233
01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:21.180
<v Speaker 4>That's all different thingS that just</v>
<v Speaker 4>studies.</v>

2234
01:42:21.330 --> 01:42:23.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the big one being that</v>

2235
01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:28.170
<v Speaker 4>civilizations have experienced many</v>
<v Speaker 4>diFferent areas and that will.</v>

2236
01:42:28.171 --> 01:42:31.680
<v Speaker 4>We're looking at when we looked back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands and thousands of years is the</v>

2237
01:42:31.681 --> 01:42:35.910
<v Speaker 4>most latest of arrows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was potentially very advanced</v>

2238
01:42:35.911 --> 01:42:38.880
<v Speaker 4>civilizations that had a different kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of advancement.</v>

2239
01:42:39.390 --> 01:42:41.340
<v Speaker 4>Ten thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>15,000 years,</v>

2240
01:42:41.341 --> 01:42:45.150
<v Speaker 4>maybe as many as 30,000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that there's evidence of this stuff.</v>

2241
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:48.360
<v Speaker 4>There's evidence in the construction of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the old kingdom in Egypt.</v>

2242
01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:52.380
<v Speaker 4>There's evidence when they start looking</v>
<v Speaker 4>at certain erosion patterns on the</v>

2243
01:42:52.381 --> 01:42:54.990
<v Speaker 4>sphinx and the sphinx compound like</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about,</v>

2244
01:42:54.991 --> 01:42:58.650
<v Speaker 4>like something that was built 14,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago plus.</v>

2245
01:42:58.651 --> 01:43:02.160
<v Speaker 4>So all these different new discoveries</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they're having when they're having</v>

2246
01:43:02.161 --> 01:43:04.140
<v Speaker 4>these new there find these new things</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are like four.</v>

2247
01:43:04.170 --> 01:43:09.170
<v Speaker 4>They found evidence of north americans</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a native americans in north America</v>

2248
01:43:09.661 --> 01:43:12.960
<v Speaker 4>at 14,000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which pushes it way back before they</v>

2249
01:43:12.961 --> 01:43:13.790
<v Speaker 4>thought it was.</v>

2250
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:16.650
<v Speaker 4>They found like woolly mammoth bones</v>
<v Speaker 4>with cuts on them and shit super</v>

2251
01:43:16.651 --> 01:43:19.200
<v Speaker 4>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this stuff keeps happening over and</v>

2252
01:43:19.201 --> 01:43:22.710
<v Speaker 4>over again and they keep discovering</v>
<v Speaker 4>these structures and you know,</v>

2253
01:43:22.711 --> 01:43:26.620
<v Speaker 4>they find things underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They find sunken cities and shit go back</v>

2254
01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:28.580
<v Speaker 4>later and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2255
01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:33.000
<v Speaker 4>Can carbon date stone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's why I go back to the so unique</v>

2256
01:43:33.001 --> 01:43:37.500
<v Speaker 4>because they know that it was covered up</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere around 12,000 years ago.</v>

2257
01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:41.160
<v Speaker 4>Purposely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone constructed this thing sometime</v>

2258
01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:42.860
<v Speaker 4>before that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2259
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:46.220
<v Speaker 4>they get a vague idea within a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 4>years of when this thing was built and</v>

2260
01:43:46.221 --> 01:43:48.450
<v Speaker 4>it was built when they thought people</v>
<v Speaker 4>were hunter gatherers,</v>

2261
01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:50.670
<v Speaker 4>so this is all stuff that hancock had</v>
<v Speaker 4>already been saying,</v>

2262
01:43:50.850 --> 01:43:54.620
<v Speaker 4>so to see him get high and just expand</v>
<v Speaker 4>upon that and see like this is a guy</v>

2263
01:43:54.621 --> 01:43:58.610
<v Speaker 4>that like he's been ridiculed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's been dragged through the mud people</v>

2264
01:43:58.611 --> 01:44:02.240
<v Speaker 4>have taken what you've said out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>context and tried to use it against him.</v>

2265
01:44:02.450 --> 01:44:06.800
<v Speaker 4>They've had these really biased opinions</v>
<v Speaker 4>about his Work and they've made little</v>

2266
01:44:06.801 --> 01:44:11.210
<v Speaker 4>specials about it to shitting on him and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it turns out he was right about a lot of</v>

2267
01:44:11.211 --> 01:44:14.690
<v Speaker 4>things and it's just gathering evidence</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then making,</v>

2268
01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:17.440
<v Speaker 4>making his his thoughts and processes</v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

2269
01:44:17.470 --> 01:44:21.620
<v Speaker 4>on evidence and he's a really good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he doesn't deserve any of that.</v>

2270
01:44:21.710 --> 01:44:23.540
<v Speaker 4>He's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not a bad guy.</v>

2271
01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:27.590
<v Speaker 4>Like he's a really good guy that's taken</v>
<v Speaker 4>a chance that's exploring this really</v>

2272
01:44:27.591 --> 01:44:31.430
<v Speaker 4>important subject.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This idea that we've been here many</v>

2273
01:44:31.431 --> 01:44:33.950
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can remember reading magicians,</v>

2274
01:44:34.730 --> 01:44:36.890
<v Speaker 4>magicians of the gods or fingerprints</v>
<v Speaker 4>that his first,</v>

2275
01:44:37.190 --> 01:44:39.320
<v Speaker 4>first one thinking things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>footprints of the gods,</v>

2276
01:44:39.321 --> 01:44:40.280
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't fingerprints,</v>

2277
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:42.320
<v Speaker 4>no fingerprints or your parents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking,</v>

2278
01:44:42.321 --> 01:44:45.350
<v Speaker 4>thank god there's a dude out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know who he was at the time.</v>

2279
01:44:45.351 --> 01:44:49.100
<v Speaker 4>Thank god there's someone doing this</v>
<v Speaker 4>work because I had never heard of any of</v>

2280
01:44:49.101 --> 01:44:49.934
<v Speaker 4>this before.</v>

2281
01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:51.110
<v Speaker 4>I read that book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2282
01:44:51.111 --> 01:44:55.310
<v Speaker 4>there's been a bunch of similar like</v>
<v Speaker 4>theorists in the past,</v>

2283
01:44:55.311 --> 01:44:57.290
<v Speaker 4>but they always connected it to like</v>
<v Speaker 4>aliens,</v>

2284
01:44:57.291 --> 01:45:01.160
<v Speaker 4>like specifically like zachariah</v>
<v Speaker 4>hitchins such and such and stuff.</v>

2285
01:45:01.190 --> 01:45:01.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well he.</v>

2286
01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:04.730
<v Speaker 4>He was gonna bring up that guy from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>chariots of the gods.</v>

2287
01:45:04.731 --> 01:45:08.720
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck Is that guy's name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a dude,</v>

2288
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:13.870
<v Speaker 4>von danIken von daniken who wrote</v>
<v Speaker 4>chariots of the gods and a chair to the</v>

2289
01:45:14.431 --> 01:45:17.180
<v Speaker 4>gods was like a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They made a documentary movie about it</v>

2290
01:45:17.181 --> 01:45:19.490
<v Speaker 4>that played in the movie theaters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember when I was a kid,</v>

2291
01:45:19.491 --> 01:45:22.610
<v Speaker 4>it was playing in the movie theaters and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was freaking out and people would</v>

2292
01:45:22.611 --> 01:45:24.260
<v Speaker 4>leave there though to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my god,</v>

2293
01:45:24.530 --> 01:45:27.320
<v Speaker 4>there's aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They visited us like that movie.</v>

2294
01:45:27.321 --> 01:45:29.600
<v Speaker 4>If you watch that movie and you smoke</v>
<v Speaker 4>pot and you're young,</v>

2295
01:45:29.810 --> 01:45:33.440
<v Speaker 4>it will have a fucking convinced you</v>
<v Speaker 4>will be fucking convinced.</v>

2296
01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:37.520
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I was convinced and it's a</v>

2297
01:45:37.521 --> 01:45:41.180
<v Speaker 4>lot of graham hancock who unconvinced me</v>
<v Speaker 4>by,</v>

2298
01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:43.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because a lot of people think he's part</v>

2299
01:45:43.401 --> 01:45:45.950
<v Speaker 4>of the ancient alien theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's not really.</v>

2300
01:45:45.951 --> 01:45:49.190
<v Speaker 4>He just feels that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we have lost technology.</v>

2301
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:51.140
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he leaves the door open.</v>

2302
01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:55.070
<v Speaker 4>We've had conversations about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He leaves the door open for visitation.</v>

2303
01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:59.750
<v Speaker 4>He leaves the door open for that being a</v>
<v Speaker 4>possibility as do why I think everybody</v>

2304
01:45:59.751 --> 01:46:04.751
<v Speaker 4>should have a unique moment where an</v>
<v Speaker 4>alien spacecraft came down and ran into</v>

2305
01:46:04.911 --> 01:46:09.140
<v Speaker 4>14th century europeans and fucked with</v>
<v Speaker 4>them and you know,</v>

2306
01:46:09.150 --> 01:46:12.650
<v Speaker 4>and kidnapped a few and did some science</v>
<v Speaker 4>certificate experiments on some and</v>

2307
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:16.070
<v Speaker 4>erase their memories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see that of course that could</v>

2308
01:46:16.071 --> 01:46:17.090
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2309
01:46:17.091 --> 01:46:20.690
<v Speaker 4>if we can go tomorrow so we could send a</v>
<v Speaker 4>robot to zoom around on mars and we</v>

2310
01:46:20.691 --> 01:46:22.970
<v Speaker 4>watch it on her iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can do that right now.</v>

2311
01:46:22.970 --> 01:46:24.590
<v Speaker 4>We're idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're idiots.</v>

2312
01:46:24.591 --> 01:46:26.990
<v Speaker 4>We can't even make pot legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got a robot moving around on</v>

2313
01:46:26.991 --> 01:46:29.120
<v Speaker 4>mars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that there's something out</v>

2314
01:46:29.121 --> 01:46:31.400
<v Speaker 4>there that's there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one is smarter than us.</v>

2315
01:46:31.410 --> 01:46:33.980
<v Speaker 4>Dude can't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like of course there's could be.</v>

2316
01:46:33.981 --> 01:46:37.370
<v Speaker 4>If we stay alive for a thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our technology is going to be</v>

2317
01:46:37.371 --> 01:46:40.340
<v Speaker 4>unrecognizable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be so beyond anything we</v>

2318
01:46:40.341 --> 01:46:43.790
<v Speaker 4>could possibly imagine today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just looking how far it's come since we</v>

2319
01:46:43.791 --> 01:46:47.330
<v Speaker 4>were kids growing up an eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These things that we see these,</v>

2320
01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:51.810
<v Speaker 4>these things that everybody sees iconic</v>
<v Speaker 4>gray creatures with the big black eyes.</v>

2321
01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:56.850
<v Speaker 4>Those could be drones percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean those could be artificially</v>

2322
01:46:56.851 --> 01:47:01.200
<v Speaker 4>intelligent creatures that some super</v>
<v Speaker 4>advanced civilization has created to</v>

2323
01:47:01.201 --> 01:47:05.820
<v Speaker 4>gather up information on people that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally possible and that would,</v>

2324
01:47:05.850 --> 01:47:10.090
<v Speaker 4>that would make it so much easier for</v>
<v Speaker 4>them to defy the laws of physics to</v>

2325
01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:10.400
<v Speaker 4>five.</v>

2326
01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:12.240
<v Speaker 4>The laws,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the laws of physics,</v>

2327
01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:14.860
<v Speaker 4>the laws of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of space travel,</v>

2328
01:47:14.861 --> 01:47:19.861
<v Speaker 4>like with human beings being unable to</v>
<v Speaker 4>withstand the kind of pressure that it</v>

2329
01:47:20.101 --> 01:47:22.920
<v Speaker 4>would require to go light speed and shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

2330
01:47:23.190 --> 01:47:27.430
<v Speaker 4>These things are some fucking weird</v>
<v Speaker 4>robot creation that doesn't even exist.</v>

2331
01:47:27.431 --> 01:47:29.760
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lives off of a lithium ion battery.</v>

2332
01:47:29.761 --> 01:47:31.310
<v Speaker 4>It's gotten it's dick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that,</v>

2333
01:47:31.311 --> 01:47:33.600
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that thing might be able to go forever,</v>

2334
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:35.820
<v Speaker 4>like it might.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Radiation might not bother it.</v>

2335
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.610
<v Speaker 4>You might be able to shoot it into a</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking black hole and it comes out the</v>

2336
01:47:38.611 --> 01:47:39.540
<v Speaker 4>other side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2337
01:47:39.541 --> 01:47:42.840
<v Speaker 4>who knows what the fuck they can do a</v>
<v Speaker 4>million years from now.</v>

2338
01:47:43.250 --> 01:47:45.560
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because in the avatar is just a robot.</v>

2339
01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.750
<v Speaker 2>When you all know robots at this point</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be controlled from a remote control.</v>

2340
01:47:50.751 --> 01:47:51.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

2341
01:47:51.591 --> 01:47:53.810
<v Speaker 2>it just depends how far away is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>remote control,</v>

2342
01:47:54.110 --> 01:47:55.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where is that written in your control?</v>

2343
01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:59.400
<v Speaker 4>So the chariots of the gods guy and even</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that the ancient aliens guys</v>

2344
01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:03.540
<v Speaker 4>that who the fuck knows there might have</v>
<v Speaker 4>been a bunch of visitors.</v>

2345
01:48:03.630 --> 01:48:07.170
<v Speaker 4>It's very possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's super possible if we can do it,</v>

2346
01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:11.040
<v Speaker 4>of course something out there that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>smarter than us can do it better than we</v>

2347
01:48:11.041 --> 01:48:15.050
<v Speaker 4>could for sure of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But with graham hancock is proposing is</v>

2348
01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:18.350
<v Speaker 4>much more likely because it's backed by</v>
<v Speaker 4>actual science and now that he's,</v>

2349
01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:21.900
<v Speaker 4>he's joined efforts with that randall</v>
<v Speaker 4>carlson guy and randall carson,</v>

2350
01:48:21.901 --> 01:48:24.570
<v Speaker 4>who's an expert on asteroidal impacts</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

2351
01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:28.140
<v Speaker 4>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the history of them in north America in</v>

2352
01:48:28.141 --> 01:48:30.210
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's a wizard when it comes to</v>

2353
01:48:30.211 --> 01:48:33.480
<v Speaker 4>that stuff and he can just quoted off</v>
<v Speaker 4>the top of his head all these different</v>

2354
01:48:33.481 --> 01:48:35.820
<v Speaker 4>impact sites that they found and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>realize like,</v>

2355
01:48:35.850 --> 01:48:38.550
<v Speaker 4>oh geez,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can hit all the time and not only do</v>

2356
01:48:38.551 --> 01:48:41.520
<v Speaker 4>we get hit all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's evidence of a massive meteor</v>

2357
01:48:41.521 --> 01:48:46.521
<v Speaker 4>shower impacting asia and europe</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere around 10,000 plus years ago,</v>

2358
01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:49.920
<v Speaker 4>which coincides with the civilization</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they.</v>

2359
01:48:50.050 --> 01:48:54.060
<v Speaker 4>Exactly they're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So somewhere around that era,</v>

2360
01:48:54.150 --> 01:48:57.690
<v Speaker 4>the human race got fucking basically</v>
<v Speaker 4>half wiped out.</v>

2361
01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:00.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had a rebuild and we don't remember.</v>

2362
01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:03.480
<v Speaker 4>We didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no electronics back then.</v>

2363
01:49:03.481 --> 01:49:05.900
<v Speaker 4>So there's no like computers that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>could look at.</v>

2364
01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:07.740
<v Speaker 4>There's no photos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have photographs,</v>

2365
01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:11.550
<v Speaker 4>they were just basing on people's</v>
<v Speaker 4>memories and things that they could</v>

2366
01:49:11.551 --> 01:49:11.941
<v Speaker 4>draw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2367
01:49:11.941 --> 01:49:13.680
<v Speaker 4>as far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have any cameras.</v>

2368
01:49:13.710 --> 01:49:14.543
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows.</v>

2369
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:16.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>

2370
01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:18.990
<v Speaker 4>if you had a camera and you left it on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ground for a thousand years,</v>

2371
01:49:19.110 --> 01:49:22.670
<v Speaker 4>there'd be nothing left and 100 they</v>
<v Speaker 4>would all go away.</v>

2372
01:49:22.710 --> 01:49:25.230
<v Speaker 4>It had batteries back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had something like a bat.</v>

2373
01:49:25.250 --> 01:49:26.083
<v Speaker 4>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2374
01:49:26.090 --> 01:49:27.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they found that in one of the</v>

2375
01:49:27.991 --> 01:49:30.380
<v Speaker 4>egyptian tombs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they found it in Iraq to yet the</v>

2376
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:33.840
<v Speaker 4>little copper and the clay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had some kind of computer or</v>

2377
01:49:33.841 --> 01:49:35.960
<v Speaker 4>electronics that just doesn't exist</v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

2378
01:49:35.970 --> 01:49:38.130
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people who made that battery,</v>

2379
01:49:38.131 --> 01:49:43.131
<v Speaker 4>they're pretty sure that was 2,500 bc.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was way later than this impact.</v>

2380
01:49:43.861 --> 01:49:46.260
<v Speaker 4>They're talking about this 11,000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was,</v>

2381
01:49:46.261 --> 01:49:49.840
<v Speaker 4>year impact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think that there's been a series of</v>

2382
01:49:49.841 --> 01:49:53.350
<v Speaker 4>these all throughout history and this is</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's supported by even</v>

2383
01:49:53.351 --> 01:49:56.410
<v Speaker 4>mainstream science when they're talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about super volcanoes.</v>

2384
01:49:56.560 --> 01:49:59.920
<v Speaker 4>There's this one super volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've looked this up three fucking</v>

2385
01:49:59.921 --> 01:50:02.110
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can ever remember this goddamned gino</v>

2386
01:50:02.260 --> 01:50:03.970
<v Speaker 4>la speed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd bullshit.</v>

2387
01:50:04.590 --> 01:50:07.120
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a super volcano that erupted</v>

2388
01:50:07.121 --> 01:50:12.121
<v Speaker 4>70,000 years ago and killed almost</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone on the planet except for a</v>

2389
01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:16.810
<v Speaker 4>couple thousand people and we all</v>
<v Speaker 4>descend from those few thousand people</v>

2390
01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:20.260
<v Speaker 4>that survived some massive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super volcano impact.</v>

2391
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:25.470
<v Speaker 4>This is a really openly accepted theory</v>
<v Speaker 4>and mainstream archeology and</v>

2392
01:50:26.651 --> 01:50:29.320
<v Speaker 4>anthropology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They really believed that this is one of</v>

2393
01:50:29.321 --> 01:50:34.270
<v Speaker 4>the possibly one of the big disaster</v>
<v Speaker 4>extinction events that happened to human</v>

2394
01:50:34.271 --> 01:50:34.670
<v Speaker 4>beings.</v>

2395
01:50:34.670 --> 01:50:36.270
<v Speaker 4>There's been several of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2396
01:50:36.370 --> 01:50:38.590
<v Speaker 4>I know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's something that caused like three</v>

2397
01:50:38.591 --> 01:50:41.320
<v Speaker 4>or four years of an equivalent of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>nuclear winter.</v>

2398
01:50:41.770 --> 01:50:42.101
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

2399
01:50:42.101 --> 01:50:44.260
<v Speaker 4>look at it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You remember mount st helen's when we</v>

2400
01:50:44.261 --> 01:50:45.370
<v Speaker 4>were kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember that?</v>

2401
01:50:45.850 --> 01:50:48.640
<v Speaker 4>Nobody talks about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody even thinks about that anymore.</v>

2402
01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:51.580
<v Speaker 4>When we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fucking volcano in Washington state</v>

2403
01:50:51.581 --> 01:50:54.760
<v Speaker 4>erupted and people died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got lava.</v>

2404
01:50:55.930 --> 01:51:00.930
<v Speaker 4>They got smoked by a volcano,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ash for a month in mash for months,</v>

2405
01:51:01.871 --> 01:51:05.530
<v Speaker 4>and it just conveniently goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a little baby volcano.</v>

2406
01:51:05.610 --> 01:51:07.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously no disrespect to anybody who</v>

2407
01:51:07.601 --> 01:51:08.540
<v Speaker 4>died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2408
01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:12.970
<v Speaker 4>In comparison to what yellowstone has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yellowstone as a super volcano that's</v>

2409
01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:17.560
<v Speaker 4>600 miles wide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something fucking crazy like that.</v>

2410
01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:20.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2411
01:51:20.531 --> 01:51:25.060
<v Speaker 4>they don't Call it acted that volcano,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's still bubbling.</v>

2412
01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:27.580
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have thousands of earthquakes every</v>

2413
01:51:27.580 --> 01:51:27.670
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>

2414
01:51:27.670 --> 01:51:29.090
<v Speaker 4>Thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like so you know,</v>

2415
01:51:29.110 --> 01:51:32.110
<v Speaker 4>shit's going on down there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guys yours are shooting up boiling</v>

2416
01:51:32.111 --> 01:51:35.490
<v Speaker 4>water and the sulfur content in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>water.</v>

2417
01:51:35.491 --> 01:51:38.140
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's 600 kilometers,</v>

2418
01:51:38.690 --> 01:51:40.150
<v Speaker 4>600 kilometers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>300 miles,</v>

2419
01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:41.980
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so big that it's,</v>

2420
01:51:41.981 --> 01:51:45.340
<v Speaker 4>it's a continent killer right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when that thing blows everything</v>

2421
01:51:45.341 --> 01:51:49.600
<v Speaker 4>near it is dead as fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What it is is what they call a caldera,</v>

2422
01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:52.360
<v Speaker 4>which means that it's a volcano that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>so big.</v>

2423
01:51:52.361 --> 01:51:56.650
<v Speaker 4>The top blew off of it and then you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>left with this big crater and they</v>

2424
01:51:56.651 --> 01:51:59.680
<v Speaker 4>didn't realize that until they started</v>
<v Speaker 4>using sas satellite images.</v>

2425
01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:02.380
<v Speaker 4>Once they started using [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've known about old faithful,</v>

2426
01:52:02.381 --> 01:52:04.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it's a cool place to visit and go</v>

2427
01:52:04.090 --> 01:52:09.090
<v Speaker 4>check out the geysers and stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 4>sets the ground is boiling like 100 feet</v>

2428
01:52:09.431 --> 01:52:14.431
<v Speaker 4>below you is hot lava and every six,</v>
<v Speaker 4>800,000 years that shit blow sky high</v>

2429
01:52:16.630 --> 01:52:18.940
<v Speaker 4>and when it blow sky high,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's dead.</v>

2430
01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:22.210
<v Speaker 4>We're all dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're all dead and California is dead.</v>

2431
01:52:22.211 --> 01:52:24.700
<v Speaker 4>Montana's dead as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything around.</v>

2432
01:52:24.701 --> 01:52:27.370
<v Speaker 4>It's just dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's depressing because it really is</v>

2433
01:52:27.371 --> 01:52:29.680
<v Speaker 4>just a matter of time before there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

2434
01:52:29.770 --> 01:52:34.350
<v Speaker 4>some impact or earthquake or a volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a matter of time and which</v>

2435
01:52:34.351 --> 01:52:35.184
<v Speaker 4>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's it going to be?</v>

2436
01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:36.430
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what graham hancock,</v>

2437
01:52:36.431 --> 01:52:40.000
<v Speaker 4>because exposing is that when you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about enormous periods of time,</v>

2438
01:52:40.270 --> 01:52:42.580
<v Speaker 4>like 10,000 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>12,000 years,</v>

2439
01:52:42.581 --> 01:52:46.310
<v Speaker 4>30,000 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people cannot recall those natural</v>

2440
01:52:46.311 --> 01:52:48.560
<v Speaker 4>disasters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They lose the ability to communicate.</v>

2441
01:52:48.561 --> 01:52:50.870
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes they're not even using the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same languages anymore.</v>

2442
01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:53.990
<v Speaker 4>You're dealing with thousands and</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands and thousands of years.</v>

2443
01:52:54.350 --> 01:52:56.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just think about just a few thousand</v>

2444
01:52:56.540 --> 01:52:58.460
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>latin was like a real language,</v>

2445
01:52:58.740 --> 01:52:59.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>joe,</v>

2446
01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:01.370
<v Speaker 4>go try finding someone that going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk latin for,</v>

2447
01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:03.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that shit doesn't it?</v>

2448
01:53:03.170 --> 01:53:05.180
<v Speaker 4>It's a dead language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2449
01:53:05.490 --> 01:53:08.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's only a couple thousand years when</v>

2450
01:53:08.091 --> 01:53:12.140
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about 30,000 years and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the possibility of all these different</v>

2451
01:53:12.141 --> 01:53:15.140
<v Speaker 4>impacts and different things happening</v>
<v Speaker 4>within those 30,000 years.</v>

2452
01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:18.890
<v Speaker 4>Like who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what he's showing is where would he</v>

2453
01:53:18.891 --> 01:53:22.940
<v Speaker 4>was showing back then was that this</v>
<v Speaker 4>alternative theory is not preposterous</v>

2454
01:53:22.941 --> 01:53:24.400
<v Speaker 4>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's,</v>

2455
01:53:24.460 --> 01:53:28.970
<v Speaker 4>there's real good evidence that this is</v>
<v Speaker 4>not gonna stay like this,</v>

2456
01:53:28.990 --> 01:53:29.300
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2457
01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:34.300
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just not preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probable and likely that it's just</v>

2458
01:53:34.610 --> 01:53:37.310
<v Speaker 2>what's next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will old faithful was called old</v>

2459
01:53:37.311 --> 01:53:42.311
<v Speaker 2>faithful because it used to be faithful</v>
<v Speaker 2>and blow at the exact time.</v>

2460
01:53:42.441 --> 01:53:47.120
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no longer on the old faithful type</v>

2461
01:53:47.121 --> 01:53:50.660
<v Speaker 2>of a schedule that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it used to be changing.</v>

2462
01:53:50.661 --> 01:53:52.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that on that air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like.</v>

2463
01:53:52.270 --> 01:53:53.720
<v Speaker 2>It makes me nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that,</v>

2464
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:54.890
<v Speaker 2>you kNow?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's just in our life.</v>

2465
01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:58.640
<v Speaker 2>When did that stop?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only recently heard it heard that,</v>

2466
01:53:58.730 --> 01:53:59.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2467
01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:02.390
<v Speaker 2>that that's new story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That old faithful is not as faithful as</v>

2468
01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:03.760
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a pinch.</v>

2469
01:54:04.230 --> 01:54:05.063
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2470
01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:06.011
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

2471
01:54:06.011 --> 01:54:08.410
<v Speaker 4>The geysers are hot water water's</v>
<v Speaker 4>boiling.</v>

2472
01:54:08.411 --> 01:54:10.330
<v Speaker 4>It shoots up into the sky and we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2473
01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:12.850
<v Speaker 4>ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

2474
01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.670
<v Speaker 4>well let's get outta here before giant</v>
<v Speaker 4>furry monster eats us.</v>

2475
01:54:17.670 --> 01:54:20.290
<v Speaker 4>Yellowstone's crAzy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy goddamn place.</v>

2476
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:24.610
<v Speaker 4>Those people have grizzly bears,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grizzly bears are there all the time.</v>

2477
01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:27.190
<v Speaker 2>There's a police in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's Ohio,</v>

2478
01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:29.540
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they have these big mud pits that</v>

2479
01:54:29.541 --> 01:54:32.640
<v Speaker 2>people go in that are real hot and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2480
01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:35.600
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think is heating those on,</v>

2481
01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:36.690
<v Speaker 2>under there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2482
01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:39.920
<v Speaker 2>that could also just quickly explode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2483
01:54:40.460 --> 01:54:41.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2484
01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:43.050
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those hot pits are totally natural and</v>

2485
01:54:43.051 --> 01:54:43.980
<v Speaker 4>Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>

2486
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:46.190
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I know they are.</v>

2487
01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:51.140
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a healthy fear of them.</v>

2488
01:54:51.141 --> 01:54:53.940
<v Speaker 2>I guess for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of just,</v>

2489
01:54:54.030 --> 01:54:54.863
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2490
01:54:55.190 --> 01:54:57.080
<v Speaker 2>think things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2491
01:54:57.200 --> 01:54:58.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in nature that could.</v>

2492
01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Mother nature just wants to kill us</v>

2493
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:05.570
<v Speaker 4>so many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just sorta right now we're fine.</v>

2494
01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:08.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no need to totally freak out about it,</v>

2495
01:55:08.061 --> 01:55:11.570
<v Speaker 4>but just the awareness that this whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing is probably pretty fucking</v>

2496
01:55:11.571 --> 01:55:14.780
<v Speaker 4>temporary and we're in the worst state</v>
<v Speaker 4>to live in.</v>

2497
01:55:14.810 --> 01:55:17.180
<v Speaker 4>That's so crazy to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why you say that.</v>

2498
01:55:17.210 --> 01:55:21.080
<v Speaker 4>Earthquake volcano were definitely</v>
<v Speaker 4>better off where we were in toronto or</v>

2499
01:55:21.081 --> 01:55:22.760
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably you freeze to death in the</v>

2500
01:55:22.761 --> 01:55:26.750
<v Speaker 4>winter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hits black eyes.</v>

2501
01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:31.220
<v Speaker 4>I think this is a really good state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of nice people.</v>

2502
01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:36.360
<v Speaker 2>More people die in a weather and natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>things in every other state besides</v>

2503
01:55:36.850 --> 01:55:37.541
<v Speaker 4>California.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2504
01:55:37.541 --> 01:55:40.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean if there's an earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be a few issues for</v>

2505
01:55:40.151 --> 01:55:40.984
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2506
01:55:41.020 --> 01:55:42.460
<v Speaker 4>Earthquakes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck a lot of things up.</v>

2507
01:55:42.461 --> 01:55:46.290
<v Speaker 4>But overall man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you deal with an earthquake once</v>

2508
01:55:46.291 --> 01:55:50.040
<v Speaker 4>every couple of decades.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You deal with winter every fucking year.</v>

2509
01:55:50.041 --> 01:55:52.440
<v Speaker 4>If you go back to Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to keep him here</v>

2510
01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.330
<v Speaker 4>isn't the biggest fault line like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Missouri or that shit doesn't work</v>

2511
01:56:00.331 --> 01:56:01.350
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's broken.</v>

2512
01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:04.070
<v Speaker 4>So like an old train station that be</v>
<v Speaker 4>broken.</v>

2513
01:56:04.430 --> 01:56:05.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2514
01:56:05.731 --> 01:56:07.950
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're worried about stuff that we know</v>

2515
01:56:07.951 --> 01:56:11.550
<v Speaker 4>about these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these spots where the earth could</v>

2516
01:56:11.551 --> 01:56:14.580
<v Speaker 4>explode,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when I fucking rocks in the sky,</v>

2517
01:56:14.581 --> 01:56:16.060
<v Speaker 4>that could kill everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

2518
01:56:16.070 --> 01:56:17.670
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they hit all the time.</v>

2519
01:56:17.671 --> 01:56:22.470
<v Speaker 4>They hit every few thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So these spaces of civilization like</v>

2520
01:56:22.530 --> 01:56:24.210
<v Speaker 4>10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>12,000 years,</v>

2521
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:27.240
<v Speaker 4>these where they find these structures</v>
<v Speaker 4>like go beckley,</v>

2522
01:56:27.241 --> 01:56:28.051
<v Speaker 4>tappi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they like,</v>

2523
01:56:28.051 --> 01:56:29.700
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where did this,</v>

2524
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:33.720
<v Speaker 4>where's this kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so likely that that's just a series</v>

2525
01:56:33.721 --> 01:56:35.490
<v Speaker 4>of events.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like people build up.</v>

2526
01:56:35.491 --> 01:56:37.530
<v Speaker 4>They figured out society to get things</v>
<v Speaker 4>going really well.</v>

2527
01:56:37.531 --> 01:56:40.450
<v Speaker 4>They stArted improving upon things and</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

2528
01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:45.450
<v Speaker 4>everybody's dead rotting bodies in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>street.</v>

2529
01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:47.640
<v Speaker 4>Diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wolves,</v>

2530
01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:52.530
<v Speaker 4>flee to the mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rebuild civilization first.</v>

2531
01:56:52.531 --> 01:56:55.800
<v Speaker 4>Fucking tribes don't make it down to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>few people.</v>

2532
01:56:55.801 --> 01:56:57.750
<v Speaker 4>They slowly bond together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They rebuild.</v>

2533
01:56:58.020 --> 01:57:00.720
<v Speaker 4>I bet that shit happens every 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years or so.</v>

2534
01:57:00.990 --> 01:57:04.800
<v Speaker 2>One of the theories I heard on gold</v>
<v Speaker 2>beckley tapi is that since that's what</v>

2535
01:57:04.801 --> 01:57:07.470
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was some devastation at that</v>

2536
01:57:07.471 --> 01:57:12.471
<v Speaker 2>point that the theory is that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>blamed it on whatever gods and that's</v>

2537
01:57:12.751 --> 01:57:15.540
<v Speaker 2>why I go back to tempe was just covered</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that point.</v>

2538
01:57:16.300 --> 01:57:17.600
<v Speaker 2>We just hired this high debt</v>

2539
01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:18.590
<v Speaker 4>right away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2540
01:57:18.591 --> 01:57:20.630
<v Speaker 4>Well that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you were like a politician you're</v>

2541
01:57:20.631 --> 01:57:24.530
<v Speaker 4>trying to take over after the disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People like these motherfuckers in their</v>

2542
01:57:24.531 --> 01:57:28.220
<v Speaker 4>statues ruined everything and we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to fill it in with dirt.</v>

2543
01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:30.970
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be like symbolic because you can't</v>

2544
01:57:30.971 --> 01:57:35.030
<v Speaker 4>like run a dope ass city with some</v>
<v Speaker 4>statues that the dude before you made.</v>

2545
01:57:35.060 --> 01:57:35.893
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

2546
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:38.900
<v Speaker 4>You got to knock those bitches over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>we still do the same thing today.</v>

2547
01:57:38.930 --> 01:57:40.370
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isis is doing it right now.</v>

2554
01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:54.230
<v Speaker 4>I forgot about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we all do it.</v>

2555
01:57:54.231 --> 01:57:57.380
<v Speaker 4>We all want to like hide what was before</v>
<v Speaker 4>us because what?</v>

2556
01:57:57.420 --> 01:58:00.000
<v Speaker 4>What we are as good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we do is right,</v>

2557
01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:02.970
<v Speaker 4>especially when it comes to someone like</v>
<v Speaker 4>saddam hussein.</v>

2558
01:58:03.970 --> 01:58:04.801

2559
01:58:04.801 --> 01:58:07.610
<v Speaker 4>we like celebrated it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When that statue went down.</v>

2560
01:58:07.611 --> 01:58:09.770
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

<v Speaker 4>history,</v>

2562
01:58:13.010 --> 01:58:16.040
<v Speaker 4>like we really shouldn't have been</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking with it because like if you</v>

2563
01:58:16.041 --> 01:58:19.700
<v Speaker 4>could see what julius caesar did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you could go back and see what</v>

2564
01:58:19.701 --> 01:58:21.920
<v Speaker 4>nero did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all the atrocities that he did,</v>

2565
01:58:22.130 --> 01:58:25.070
<v Speaker 4>he wouldn't want to see a statue of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But imagine if someone came along and</v>

2566
01:58:25.071 --> 01:58:27.830
<v Speaker 4>smashed a statue of him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't be able to look at it</v>

2567
01:58:27.831 --> 01:58:29.990
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's something about when you go</v>

2568
01:58:29.991 --> 01:58:33.770
<v Speaker 4>to a museum and you look at something</v>
<v Speaker 4>from ancient rome and they go,</v>

<v Speaker 4>these people were nuts.</v>

2572
01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:42.040
<v Speaker 4>They were out of their fucking</v>

2573
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.780
<v Speaker 5>minds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were living at a crazy,</v>

2574
01:58:43.781 --> 01:58:48.400
<v Speaker 5>crazy time of taking over the world with</v>
<v Speaker 5>swords and bows and arrows and shit.</v>

2575
01:58:48.910 --> 01:58:53.140
<v Speaker 5>But is saddam hussein worse than them?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2576
01:58:53.190 --> 01:58:53.801
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2577
01:58:53.801 --> 01:58:54.660
<v Speaker 5>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2578
01:58:54.740 --> 01:58:57.260
<v Speaker 5>They takIng that shit and put it in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>museum somewhere.</v>

2579
01:58:57.330 --> 01:59:00.790
<v Speaker 5>My college had christopher columbus</v>
<v Speaker 5>pointing at the cafeteria.</v>

2580
01:59:01.090 --> 01:59:02.760
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kids.</v>

2581
01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:07.330
<v Speaker 5>He was a cool guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just became something over the last</v>

2582
01:59:07.330 --> 01:59:07.601
<v Speaker 5>decade or so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2583
01:59:07.601 --> 01:59:10.000
<v Speaker 5>The christopher columbus was a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

2584
01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:10.873
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2585
01:59:11.090 --> 01:59:12.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another thing,</v>

2586
01:59:13.130 --> 01:59:15.990
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's from graham hancock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

2587
01:59:16.670 --> 01:59:21.670
<v Speaker 2>the iraqi museum had a lot of material</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just got wiped out during these</v>

2588
01:59:22.131 --> 01:59:24.260
<v Speaker 2>wars that will never be able to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>

2589
01:59:24.261 --> 01:59:29.261
<v Speaker 2>that had to do with ancient art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient societies and Egypt and things</v>

2590
01:59:29.961 --> 01:59:30.794
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2591
01:59:30.860 --> 01:59:32.750
<v Speaker 2>so during these wars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2592
01:59:32.780 --> 01:59:34.640
<v Speaker 2>the whole place will just lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2593
01:59:34.641 --> 01:59:38.180
<v Speaker 2>the museum was alluded so they lost all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those,</v>

2594
01:59:38.330 --> 01:59:39.163
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2595
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:40.430
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's a tragedy.</v>

2596
01:59:40.431 --> 01:59:44.270
<v Speaker 5>That's like the birth of modern</v>
<v Speaker 5>civilization is like the tigris and</v>

2597
01:59:44.271 --> 01:59:46.910
<v Speaker 5>euphrates,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that little valley there.</v>

2598

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2599
01:59:48.441 --> 01:59:50.720

<v Speaker 5>but you got to keep the history.</v>

2600
01:59:50.721 --> 01:59:53.450
<v Speaker 5>Leave it alone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there's rules of war that says you</v>

2601
01:59:53.451 --> 01:59:55.940

<v Speaker 5>can't even go into today because there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>still like ordinances buried under the</v>

2623
02:00:41.961 --> 02:00:43.640
<v Speaker 5>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We keep finding stuff there.</v>

2624
02:00:43.641 --> 02:00:46.010
<v Speaker 5>They stack it up and these warehouses</v>
<v Speaker 5>and shit.</v>

2625
02:00:46.250 --> 02:00:50.630
<v Speaker 5>It's just like a depository for bombs</v>
<v Speaker 5>and bomb chemicals.</v>

2626
02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:53.450
<v Speaker 5>They all fucking either launched amount</v>
<v Speaker 5>of.</v>

2627
02:00:53.451 --> 02:00:55.820
<v Speaker 5>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They landed there and it didn't go off</v>

2628
02:00:55.821 --> 02:00:59.700
<v Speaker 5>or they left behind mines and bombs was</v>
<v Speaker 5>just huge area that you.</v>

2629
02:00:59.701 --> 02:01:03.440
<v Speaker 5>You can't even go In.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all toxic and it's the size of</v>

2630
02:01:03.441 --> 02:01:05.030
<v Speaker 5>parents apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2631
02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:07.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was wondering like wonder,</v>

2632
02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:10.490
<v Speaker 5>was there a conscious decision to not</v>
<v Speaker 5>bomb,</v>

2633
02:01:10.750 --> 02:01:12.110
<v Speaker 5>like maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe they did and I don't.</v>

2634
02:01:12.190 --> 02:01:13.610
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they did.</v>

2635
02:01:13.611 --> 02:01:18.611
<v Speaker 5>I think they just kind of rolled through</v>
<v Speaker 5>there because I mean london got the shit</v>

2636
02:01:18.741 --> 02:01:20.870
<v Speaker 5>kicked out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See if you cAn find that picture.</v>

2637
02:01:20.871 --> 02:01:22.850
<v Speaker 5>Ges,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's photos of the munitions where</v>

2638
02:01:22.851 --> 02:01:24.260
<v Speaker 5>they stack them up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

2639
02:01:24.290 --> 02:01:27.020
<v Speaker 5>Picture of paris getting bombed from the</v>
<v Speaker 5>familiar.</v>

2640
02:01:27.110 --> 02:01:27.943
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well there you go.</v>

2641
02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.920
<v Speaker 5>Did they lead the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I look at that.</v>

2642
02:01:32.420 --> 02:01:34.610
<v Speaker 5>Holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2643
02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:37.940
<v Speaker 5>There goes our,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the library of alexandria got</v>

2644
02:01:38.210 --> 02:01:39.950
<v Speaker 5>destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was in Egypt though.</v>

2645
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:41.270
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just saying that was during the</v>

2646
02:01:41.271 --> 02:01:41.980
<v Speaker 3>muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2647
02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:43.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's a different time period,</v>

2648
02:01:43.191 --> 02:01:44.990
<v Speaker 3>but I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to ask like that.</v>

2649
02:01:44.991 --> 02:01:49.370
<v Speaker 3>Is there something today that contains a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of history that could be destroyed</v>

2650
02:01:49.371 --> 02:01:50.690
<v Speaker 3>and ruined and setting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2651
02:01:50.691 --> 02:01:51.010
<v Speaker 3>like</v>

2652
02:01:51.010 --> 02:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem would be if the power went</v>

2653
02:01:53.461 --> 02:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>out for more than a couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's never coming back.</v>

2654
02:01:56.570 --> 02:01:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the grid got destroyed,</v>

2655
02:01:58.380 --> 02:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>if something happened that was so big</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it destroyed the power grid and we</v>

2656
02:02:01.591 --> 02:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>needed to reestablish a grid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck,</v>

2657
02:02:05.140 --> 02:02:08.130
<v Speaker 1>and then we lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We lose 50 percent of the population in</v>

2658
02:02:08.131 --> 02:02:10.290
<v Speaker 1>the impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know what,</v>

2659
02:02:10.291 --> 02:02:14.520
<v Speaker 1>we were left with chaos and lawlessness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fucking people starving to death and</v>

2660
02:02:14.521 --> 02:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>no one knows what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2661
02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>good luck in the power back on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All would take is one of those things.</v>

2662
02:02:19.501 --> 02:02:21.510
<v Speaker 1>It might take 100 years for the power to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come back on</v>

2663
02:02:21.630 --> 02:02:24.810
<v Speaker 3>and that might not even be negative</v>
<v Speaker 3>intent of humans.</v>

2664
02:02:24.811 --> 02:02:27.330
<v Speaker 3>That can happen just from the sun in</v>
<v Speaker 3>emp.</v>

2665
02:02:27.510 --> 02:02:30.000
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We haven't had electric long enough.</v>

2666
02:02:30.001 --> 02:02:32.160
<v Speaker 3>We might have had an emp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2667
02:02:32.220 --> 02:02:36.990
<v Speaker 3>what's an emp explaining a electrode,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a magnetic pulse,</v>

2668
02:02:37.170 --> 02:02:39.050
<v Speaker 3>which would take out all of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>electronic.</v>

2669
02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:43.110
<v Speaker 3>You just say emp or emp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We sit around and talk about this all</v>

2670
02:02:43.111 --> 02:02:44.350
<v Speaker 3>the time was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was dog.</v>

2671
02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:48.390
<v Speaker 3>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2672
02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:49.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's um,</v>

2673
02:02:50.370 --> 02:02:52.750
<v Speaker 3>they've tried to make an amp weapons</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that'll take you,</v>

2674
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:54.770
<v Speaker 3>take out a full grid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if,</v>

2675
02:02:54.890 --> 02:02:58.650
<v Speaker 3>but the son could produce that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if the son did that and it could have</v>

2676
02:02:58.651 --> 02:03:01.590
<v Speaker 3>been done in history where we just</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have electric,</v>

2677
02:03:01.620 --> 02:03:05.410
<v Speaker 3>there's evidence of an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of an emp or a solar flare that hit some</v>

2678
02:03:05.411 --> 02:03:07.170
<v Speaker 3>time in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the 19th century,</v>

2679
02:03:07.180 --> 02:03:10.410
<v Speaker 3>we only know about it because a</v>
<v Speaker 3>telegraph like went down all the</v>

2680
02:03:10.411 --> 02:03:13.830
<v Speaker 3>telegraphs in America went down for like</v>
<v Speaker 3>two days and everyone was like,</v>

2681
02:03:13.831 --> 02:03:16.320
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then a couple of days later</v>

2682
02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:17.970
<v Speaker 3>everything worked again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2683
02:03:18.090 --> 02:03:21.960
<v Speaker 3>and scientists think that it was a solar</v>
<v Speaker 3>flare or their ejection that caused an</v>

2684
02:03:21.961 --> 02:03:26.340
<v Speaker 3>enp and just shut down all the power for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few days here it would be a,</v>

2685
02:03:26.490 --> 02:03:30.420
<v Speaker 3>it'd be walking dead if it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now is so crazy that we rely on that</v>

2686
02:03:30.421 --> 02:03:31.650
<v Speaker 3>thing to stay stable.</v>

2687
02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>This giant ball of nuclear power that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>floating in the sky.</v>

2688
02:03:36.941 --> 02:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a million times bigger than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

2689
02:03:39.011 --> 02:03:41.350
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we count on it to stay stable.</v>

2690
02:03:41.770 --> 02:03:45.760
<v Speaker 3>We do what the solar flare is still</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening a lot though.</v>

2691
02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:50.200
<v Speaker 3>Recently there was something that knock</v>
<v Speaker 3>something out from a solar flare,</v>

2692
02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:52.840
<v Speaker 3>but the sun has been weird lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been really,</v>

2693
02:03:52.841 --> 02:03:55.740
<v Speaker 3>really dark and strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot of activities.</v>

2694
02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:59.720
<v Speaker 3>One smokes too much pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sun's been dark and strange.</v>

2695
02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:01.660
<v Speaker 3>Not a lot of activity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2696
02:04:01.661 --> 02:04:02.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2697
02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:05.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm really talking about being serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2698
02:04:05.321 --> 02:04:07.870
<v Speaker 3>what's going on with the son?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The son normally has a lot of solar</v>

2699
02:04:07.871 --> 02:04:09.220
<v Speaker 3>activity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>storms,</v>

2700
02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:10.900
<v Speaker 3>ejections,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that kind of stuff.</v>

2701
02:04:11.020 --> 02:04:12.400
<v Speaker 3>The last 12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 years,</v>

2702
02:04:12.401 --> 02:04:16.990
<v Speaker 3>it's been really qUiet and it's dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a cycle,</v>

2703
02:04:17.290 --> 02:04:18.640
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody freaks out.</v>

2704
02:04:18.641 --> 02:04:20.910
<v Speaker 3>It's global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little cooling.</v>

2705
02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:21.760
<v Speaker 3>It's climate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

2706
02:04:21.761 --> 02:04:23.920
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a solar cycle and it's just.</v>

2707
02:04:24.190 --> 02:04:28.180
<v Speaker 3>The sun is just chilled right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking a breather in 10 years and they</v>

2708
02:04:28.181 --> 02:04:28.720
<v Speaker 3>say</v>

2709
02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:31.910
<v Speaker 1>our cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're measuring what they've been</v>

2710
02:04:31.911 --> 02:04:36.140
<v Speaker 1>measuring over the period of whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of decades they've been able to</v>

2711
02:04:36.141 --> 02:04:40.710
<v Speaker 1>measure solar cycles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this thing has been around</v>

2712
02:04:41.550 --> 02:04:42.301
<v Speaker 1>measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2713
02:04:42.301 --> 02:04:43.200
<v Speaker 1>The sun's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2714
02:04:43.201 --> 02:04:46.470
<v Speaker 1>you expect me to behave like I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaving for the last 50 years?</v>

2715
02:04:46.471 --> 02:04:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck with that dude,</v>

2716
02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:49.920
<v Speaker 1>because I got a fucking temper</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

2717
02:04:49.921 --> 02:04:54.840
<v Speaker 1>I like to blow up a whole solar system</v>
<v Speaker 1>turning into a crisp.</v>

2718
02:04:55.080 --> 02:05:00.080
<v Speaker 1>I watched this crazy documentary on</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper nobles and that they initially</v>

2719
02:05:00.751 --> 02:05:03.630
<v Speaker 1>thought that they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were witnessing when they saw these</v>

2720
02:05:03.631 --> 02:05:06.870
<v Speaker 1>gamma burst in the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought they were witnessing war</v>

2721
02:05:06.930 --> 02:05:10.350
<v Speaker 1>between alien races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that was the initial reaction to</v>

2722
02:05:10.351 --> 02:05:15.150
<v Speaker 1>measuring these gamma burst in the sky</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they realized somewhere along</v>

2723
02:05:15.151 --> 02:05:18.540
<v Speaker 1>the line that you looking at like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper nova,</v>

2724
02:05:18.570 --> 02:05:21.870
<v Speaker 1>like an enormous burst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an explosion.</v>

2725
02:05:21.871 --> 02:05:26.520
<v Speaker 1>That's so great that if it was in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>nearby cluster it would kIll us.</v>

2726
02:05:26.760 --> 02:05:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2727
02:05:28.230 --> 02:05:31.380
<v Speaker 1>That gamma radiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think just the whole lowe's that we</v>

2728
02:05:31.381 --> 02:05:33.990
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That we can even measure.</v>

2729
02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the.</v>

2730
02:05:34.980 --> 02:05:37.740
<v Speaker 1>The thing was that it was happening all</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

2731
02:05:38.130 --> 02:05:41.190
<v Speaker 1>all throughout the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they would be like measuring this</v>

2732
02:05:41.220 --> 02:05:42.450
<v Speaker 1>for the first time and they've seen</v>

2733
02:05:44.190 --> 02:05:45.023
<v Speaker 9>cool,</v>

2734
02:05:47.620 --> 02:05:49.660
<v Speaker 1>like all these different spots in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

2735
02:05:49.661 --> 02:05:53.050
<v Speaker 1>we're experiencing these gamma burst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you not think it's star wars?</v>

2736
02:05:53.110 --> 02:05:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally think that's exactly what they</v>

2737
02:05:54.911 --> 02:05:55.361
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2738
02:05:55.361 --> 02:05:57.520
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what If they come?</v>

2739
02:05:57.960 --> 02:05:59.710
<v Speaker 1>What if they come and they have this</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of power?</v>

2740
02:05:59.711 --> 02:06:00.870
<v Speaker 1>They have gamma power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2741
02:06:00.910 --> 02:06:02.410
<v Speaker 1>So we have to band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd,</v>

2742
02:06:02.580 --> 02:06:03.520
<v Speaker 1>we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2743
02:06:03.550 --> 02:06:06.720
<v Speaker 1>get society on the right track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like at least we could like</v>

2744
02:06:06.730 --> 02:06:10.510
<v Speaker 1>give them are gold are women and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>might leave us be,</v>

2745
02:06:10.690 --> 02:06:13.630
<v Speaker 1>it might be possible to negotiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't go.</v>

2746
02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:16.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding about that obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't negotiate with a</v>

2747
02:06:16.331 --> 02:06:17.800
<v Speaker 1>supernova.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2748
02:06:17.801 --> 02:06:22.801
<v Speaker 1>when a sun explodes and takes out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire surrounding area for billions and</v>

2749
02:06:24.550 --> 02:06:25.510
<v Speaker 1>billions of miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

2750
02:06:25.570 --> 02:06:27.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's less,</v>

2751
02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:31.390
<v Speaker 1>it's less feared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but way scarier.</v>

2752
02:06:31.420 --> 02:06:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't build an ark to escape a nova,</v>

2753
02:06:34.090 --> 02:06:35.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's just not.</v>

2754
02:06:36.010 --> 02:06:40.060
<v Speaker 1>That's just a little water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It apparently it happens all the time.</v>

2755
02:06:40.180 --> 02:06:41.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you probably won't happening right</v>

2756
02:06:41.441 --> 02:06:44.530
<v Speaker 1>now somewhere and you can never convince</v>
<v Speaker 1>society of it that,</v>

2757
02:06:44.531 --> 02:06:45.970
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got bigger problems to worry</v>

<v Speaker 1>They actually don't know what medicine</v>

2770
02:07:26.381 --> 02:07:28.240
<v Speaker 1>they have because they do all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>medication.</v>

02:07:28.241 --> 02:07:30.520
<v Speaker 1>They don't just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't just do pot,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but they're still high as fuck.</v>

2773
02:07:34.060 --> 02:07:35.940
<v Speaker 1>So I'm uh,</v>

2774
02:07:36.730 --> 02:07:37.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2775
02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:40.550
<v Speaker 2>there are regulations that are coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>down for,</v>

2776
02:07:40.580 --> 02:07:42.680
<v Speaker 2>for transported as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2777
02:07:42.681 --> 02:07:45.520
<v Speaker 2>the teamsters want to get their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their hands and transport,</v>

2778
02:07:45.521 --> 02:07:50.521
<v Speaker 2>which they are one of the people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>rallying against legalization of</v>

2779
02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:54.390
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm there with the,</v>

2780
02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:55.473
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2781
02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:59.740
<v Speaker 2>the unions for prisons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're kind of fighting on both</v>

2782
02:07:59.741 --> 02:08:01.600
<v Speaker 2>sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to be involved in</v>

2783
02:08:01.660 --> 02:08:06.310
<v Speaker 2>transportation of marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however they're lobbying for to keep it</v>

2784
02:08:06.311 --> 02:08:06.980
<v Speaker 2>illegal.</v>

2785
02:08:06.980 --> 02:08:09.200
<v Speaker 5>Did the teamsters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to be on whatever side</v>

2786
02:08:09.201 --> 02:08:11.710
<v Speaker 5>winds are over here now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2787
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:12.580
<v Speaker 5>You're over here now.</v>

2788
02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:13.413
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2789
02:08:13.900 --> 02:08:14.733
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2790
02:08:14.930 --> 02:08:15.830
<v Speaker 2>so again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2791
02:08:15.831 --> 02:08:17.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2792
02:08:17.960 --> 02:08:22.960
<v Speaker 2>what we were considered was similar to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dominoes of marijuana here in la.</v>

2793
02:08:24.260 --> 02:08:25.041
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2794
02:08:25.041 --> 02:08:26.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are evolving.</v>

2795
02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:28.940
<v Speaker 2>That's what we were doing before this</v>
<v Speaker 2>lawsuit happened.</v>

2796
02:08:29.150 --> 02:08:32.540
<v Speaker 2>We really want to be considered more</v>
<v Speaker 2>like amazon prime.</v>

2797
02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:33.710
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2798
02:08:33.711 --> 02:08:38.711
<v Speaker 2>where you're making a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were dumb now that I be like</v>

2799
02:08:41.541 --> 02:08:43.230
<v Speaker 2>circuit city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2800
02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:48.340
<v Speaker 2>governor brown's new laws have changed</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that marijuana companies can be for</v>

2801
02:08:48.951 --> 02:08:51.530
<v Speaker 2>profit now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to be not for profit,</v>

2802
02:08:52.140 --> 02:08:54.530
<v Speaker 2>which is how it's been for the last 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>years here.</v>

2803
02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:55.880
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2804
02:08:56.570 --> 02:09:00.560
<v Speaker 2>and so that has to go into effect by</v>
<v Speaker 2>2018.</v>

2805
02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:04.610
<v Speaker 2>So that's something to consider also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once that happens,</v>

2806
02:09:04.611 --> 02:09:07.070
<v Speaker 2>that changes things for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannabis businesses,</v>

2807
02:09:07.310 --> 02:09:09.900
<v Speaker 2>but that all said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every cannabis business that's in,</v>

2808
02:09:09.950 --> 02:09:12.390
<v Speaker 2>in la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a dispensary in,</v>

2809
02:09:12.391 --> 02:09:16.060
<v Speaker 2>in that whether they're making edibles</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they making vaporizers or,</v>

2810
02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:16.610
<v Speaker 2>or anything.</v>

2811
02:09:16.610 --> 02:09:19.310
<v Speaker 2>And it's a thriving industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all illegal.</v>

2812
02:09:19.670 --> 02:09:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Every bit of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So regulation does need that,</v>

2813
02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:23.620
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened,</v>

2814
02:09:23.670 --> 02:09:24.503
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2815
02:09:24.530 --> 02:09:26.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here in la and what we're asking for</v>

2816
02:09:26.661 --> 02:09:30.350
<v Speaker 2>isn't he just overturned this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not saying that we're saying we</v>

2817
02:09:30.351 --> 02:09:35.351
<v Speaker 2>know the city attorney does believe that</v>
<v Speaker 2>safe access is important,</v>

2818
02:09:35.630 --> 02:09:39.530
<v Speaker 2>but he feels he has to uphold this law</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was put into effect before he was</v>

2819
02:09:39.531 --> 02:09:43.250
<v Speaker 2>the city attorney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So since he knows this is a bad law that</v>

2820
02:09:43.251 --> 02:09:48.170
<v Speaker 2>he has to enforce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could also affect change by helping</v>

2821
02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:51.710
<v Speaker 2>go down the path of legalization for</v>
<v Speaker 2>good businesses.</v>

2822
02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:53.270
<v Speaker 2>He'S,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not an idiot.</v>

2823
02:09:53.271 --> 02:09:57.730
<v Speaker 2>he realizes what a bad law is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just knows his job is to enforce it.</v>

2824
02:09:57.860 --> 02:09:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hopefully,</v>

2825
02:09:59.540 --> 02:10:03.560
<v Speaker 2>hopefully he'll join the fight to find a</v>
<v Speaker 2>path towards legal.</v>

2826
02:10:03.561 --> 02:10:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2827
02:10:03.890 --> 02:10:05.360
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What can people do with the people that</v>

2828
02:10:05.361 --> 02:10:08.090
<v Speaker 5>are listening the to wrap this all up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

2829

<v Speaker 5>the people that are listening,</v>

2830
02:10:09.321 --> 02:10:11.780
<v Speaker 5>what's a good way to follow this or a</v>
<v Speaker 5>good way to help?</v>

2831

<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>

2901
02:12:54.591 --> 02:12:58.220
<v Speaker 5>Like an arbitrary line in the sand</v>
<v Speaker 5>politically across this line.</v>

02:13:13.071 --> 02:13:16.280
<v Speaker 5>We got pulled over for weed in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not like getting pulled over for</v>

2909
02:13:16.330 --> 02:13:19.340
<v Speaker 5>weeding California and next thing you</v>
<v Speaker 5>know willie nelson's in jail.</v>

2911
02:13:21.081 --> 02:13:22.460
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hilarious.</v>

2912
02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:25.280
<v Speaker 5>Someone such a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They arrested Willie Nelson.</v>

2913
02:13:25.281 --> 02:13:27.440
<v Speaker 5>I'd quit my job so my kids are going</v>
<v Speaker 5>hungry.</v>

2914
02:13:27.470 --> 02:13:28.970
<v Speaker 5>Fucked us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's actually great.</v>

2915
02:13:29.060 --> 02:13:32.400
<v Speaker 5>It's actually pretty scary getting</v>
<v Speaker 5>pulled over with weed in California</v>

2916
02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:35.820
<v Speaker 8>nowadays because of dui rate has gone</v>
<v Speaker 8>crazy.</v>

2917
02:13:35.821 --> 02:13:38.880
<v Speaker 8>My friend's a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 8>dui lawyer and half of his cases now are</v>

2918
02:13:38.881 --> 02:13:42.630
<v Speaker 8>just from marijuana and they have a new</v>
<v Speaker 8>test where they do the same kind of</v>

2919
02:13:42.631 --> 02:13:44.140
<v Speaker 8>thing with your eye,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it,</v>

2920
02:13:44.141 --> 02:13:47.940
<v Speaker 8>it like goes left and right real fast if</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're high or something like that.</v>

2921
02:13:47.941 --> 02:13:50.870
<v Speaker 8>And if they feel like they,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they can smell weed and if,</v>

2922
02:13:50.950 --> 02:13:53.520
<v Speaker 8>if you fail this test,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're getting a dui just like an</v>

2923
02:13:53.550 --> 02:13:55.460
<v Speaker 8>alcoholic left to right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We'll quit.</v>

2924
02:13:55.770 --> 02:13:56.830
<v Speaker 8>So you know when,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when,</v>

2925
02:13:56.850 --> 02:13:58.770
<v Speaker 8>when you get pulled over,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they do the test with your.</v>

2926
02:13:58.771 --> 02:14:00.330
<v Speaker 8>I like fall,</v>
<v Speaker 8>my aunt.</v>

2927
02:14:00.450 --> 02:14:04.470
<v Speaker 8>I think with alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it shoots over like your eyes</v>

2928
02:14:04.471 --> 02:14:07.680
<v Speaker 8>shoots over to the left or the right</v>
<v Speaker 8>really fast or it's jerky,</v>

2929
02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:08.790
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when you're,</v>

2930
02:14:08.790 --> 02:14:11.400
<v Speaker 8>when you're high,</v>
<v Speaker 8>your eye reacts different every day.</v>

2931
02:14:11.490 --> 02:14:14.270
<v Speaker 8>It's kind of like a jiggly left and</v>
<v Speaker 8>right effect when it,</v>

2932
02:14:14.330 --> 02:14:16.480
<v Speaker 8>there can't be any science.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So that's,</v>

2933
02:14:16.700 --> 02:14:21.120
<v Speaker 8>that's it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And right now in court they are fighting</v>

2934
02:14:21.121 --> 02:14:22.920
<v Speaker 8>just that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If it's,</v>

2935
02:14:22.950 --> 02:14:27.390
<v Speaker 8>if it's a legit test and they don't have</v>
<v Speaker 8>a like a point,</v>

2936
02:14:27.391 --> 02:14:28.500
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>eight for weed yet.</v>

2937
02:14:28.501 --> 02:14:30.230
<v Speaker 8>So they didn't really have any laws.</v>

2938
02:14:30.230 --> 02:14:32.210
<v Speaker 5>There's the main problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think you'll agree with me,</v>

2939
02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:35.330
<v Speaker 5>there's never been a study that shows</v>
<v Speaker 5>that any loss of motor skills.</v>

2940
02:14:35.460 --> 02:14:36.081
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>none.</v>

2941
02:14:36.081 --> 02:14:38.690
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There wAs one study about driving a</v>

2942
02:14:38.750 --> 02:14:42.150
<v Speaker 5>while smoking weed and that they found</v>
<v Speaker 5>that people actually performed better</v>

2943
02:14:42.570 --> 02:14:43.311
<v Speaker 5>route.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2944
02:14:43.311 --> 02:14:45.440
<v Speaker 5>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not a motor skill thing.</v>

2945
02:14:45.441 --> 02:14:48.500
<v Speaker 5>It's not like alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody knows that if you drink too</v>

2946
02:14:48.501 --> 02:14:49.820
<v Speaker 5>much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't drIve good.</v>

2947
02:14:49.910 --> 02:14:52.130
<v Speaker 5>Everybody knows that it's bad for your</v>
<v Speaker 5>motor skills.</v>

2948
02:14:52.700 --> 02:14:54.050
<v Speaker 5>Pot's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's simple.</v>

2949
02:14:54.051 --> 02:14:56.470
<v Speaker 5>So what are they pulling you over for</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly?</v>

2950
02:14:56.490 --> 02:14:59.300
<v Speaker 5>state of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So because if it doesn't affect your</v>

2951
02:14:59.301 --> 02:15:01.850
<v Speaker 5>motor skills,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like is it affecting your judgment?</v>

2952
02:15:01.851 --> 02:15:06.320
<v Speaker 5>Can you prove that people were</v>
<v Speaker 5>intoxicated on marijuana perform less</v>

2953
02:15:06.590 --> 02:15:10.010
<v Speaker 5>intelligently than people that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>intoxicated on caffeine or cigarettes</v>

2954
02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:12.740
<v Speaker 5>because you know they're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A cop could pull a guy over,</v>

2955
02:15:12.741 --> 02:15:15.590
<v Speaker 5>he could have a cigarette in the corner</v>
<v Speaker 5>of his mouth drinking a cup of coffee</v>

2956
02:15:15.770 --> 02:15:16.760
<v Speaker 5>and no one says a word.</v>

2957
02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:18.620
<v Speaker 5>Those are two drugs interact with each</v>
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

2958
02:15:18.621 --> 02:15:20.780
<v Speaker 5>No one has a pro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's a state of mind issue.</v>

2959
02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:23.420
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he could have those drugs and still</v>

2960
02:15:23.421 --> 02:15:27.080
<v Speaker 5>have a couple of pops at the bar to</v>
<v Speaker 5>really amp up all that aggression and</v>

2961
02:15:27.081 --> 02:15:29.600
<v Speaker 5>still legally drive behind what is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2962
02:15:29.630 --> 02:15:31.190
<v Speaker 5>what his intoxication.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2963
02:15:31.191 --> 02:15:33.500
<v Speaker 5>isn't intoxication is supposed to be a</v>
<v Speaker 5>loss of motor skills?</v>

2964
02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:34.730
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2965
02:15:34.731 --> 02:15:38.340
<v Speaker 5>But it's sort of arbitrary because wHat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is intoxicated?</v>

2966
02:15:38.410 --> 02:15:42.170
<v Speaker 5>the swab test just did not pass in</v>
<v Speaker 5>California where they were trying to,</v>

2967
02:15:42.260 --> 02:15:45.050
<v Speaker 5>to swab for thc molecules and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2968
02:15:45.051 --> 02:15:47.130
<v Speaker 5>that's totally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't do that because.</v>

2969
02:15:47.140 --> 02:15:50.660
<v Speaker 5>Because I'm going to just walk through a</v>
<v Speaker 5>party and then they get swapped and</v>

2970
02:15:50.661 --> 02:15:53.270
<v Speaker 5>they're in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't have any of it in their</v>

2971
02:15:53.271 --> 02:15:54.100
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't,</v>

2972
02:15:54.100 --> 02:15:56.950
<v Speaker 5>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like gino would,</v>

2973
02:15:56.970 --> 02:15:57.803
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He smokes.</v>

2974
02:15:57.860 --> 02:15:58.340
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2975
02:15:58.340 --> 02:16:00.300
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know when he's high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know when he's done.</v>

2976
02:16:00.310 --> 02:16:02.710
<v Speaker 5>Trust me is high right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trust me.</v>

2977
02:16:03.500 --> 02:16:06.380
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So mAny people are high right now and</v>

2978
02:16:06.381 --> 02:16:07.340
<v Speaker 5>you wouldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2979
02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:09.920
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So how can you test for it?</v>

2980
02:16:09.950 --> 02:16:10.201
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're.</v>

2981
02:16:10.201 --> 02:16:14.930
<v Speaker 5>The real problem is what can you show is</v>
<v Speaker 5>bad about being high?</v>

2982
02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:20.120
<v Speaker 5>I need to see something on your tests</v>
<v Speaker 5>where you show me why you should be able</v>

2983
02:16:20.121 --> 02:16:24.440
<v Speaker 5>to pull people over with why you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>wearing a gun and shine a light in their</v>

2984
02:16:24.441 --> 02:16:27.710
<v Speaker 5>face and get them out of their vehicle</v>
<v Speaker 5>and make them do things like what is the</v>

2985
02:16:27.711 --> 02:16:29.530
<v Speaker 5>worst case you're looking for?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2986
02:16:29.950 --> 02:16:30.310
<v Speaker 5>What's</v>

2987
02:16:30.310 --> 02:16:33.820
<v Speaker 4>the worst case scenario that's going on</v>
<v Speaker 4>with this person that's on the</v>

2988
02:16:33.821 --> 02:16:37.030
<v Speaker 4>marijuana?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are they performing in any way,</v>

2989
02:16:37.031 --> 02:16:39.490
<v Speaker 4>shape or form?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether they're a danger the people</v>

2990
02:16:39.491 --> 02:16:40.960
<v Speaker 4>around them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if that's.</v>

2991
02:16:40.961 --> 02:16:43.480
<v Speaker 4>If that is true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you have to prove that before</v>

2992
02:16:43.481 --> 02:16:45.010
<v Speaker 4>you put people in a fucking cage.</v>

2993
02:16:45.510 --> 02:16:47.550
<v Speaker 8>It also varies from person to person.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I believe.</v>

2994
02:16:47.551 --> 02:16:49.770
<v Speaker 8>I know a girl that smokes a joint,</v>
<v Speaker 8>she can't drive.</v>

2995
02:16:49.771 --> 02:16:52.360
<v Speaker 8>She can barely function as a human,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but jay,</v>

2996
02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:54.570
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>could do a whole ounce and you'll be</v>

2997
02:16:54.571 --> 02:16:57.180
<v Speaker 8>fine to drive as exact same driver as</v>
<v Speaker 8>before,</v>

2998
02:16:57.181 --> 02:16:58.680
<v Speaker 8>if not better.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But this girl,</v>

2999
02:16:58.740 --> 02:17:00.390
<v Speaker 8>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I wouldn't even let her in the car.</v>

3000
02:17:00.391 --> 02:17:02.640
<v Speaker 8>She smoked her that she probably</v>
<v Speaker 8>shouldn't be able to drive anyway.</v>

3001
02:17:03.060 --> 02:17:06.650
<v Speaker 8>How about that shit?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

3002
02:17:07.340 --> 02:17:09.150
<v Speaker 8>There should be like a test,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we've talked about this before,</v>

3003
02:17:09.151 --> 02:17:11.250
<v Speaker 8>like a marijuana test,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like you are a 10,</v>

3004
02:17:11.251 --> 02:17:13.920
<v Speaker 8>meaning you could do with marijuana and</v>
<v Speaker 8>anything and you're fine,</v>

3005
02:17:13.921 --> 02:17:15.720
<v Speaker 8>but this person's like rated a six.</v>

3006
02:17:15.810 --> 02:17:17.460
<v Speaker 4>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's a mind issue.</v>

3007
02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:19.770
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a motor skill issue.</v>

3008
02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:21.780
<v Speaker 4>This is where the problem lies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3009
02:17:21.781 --> 02:17:23.280
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess some people would freak out when</v>

3010
02:17:23.281 --> 02:17:25.620
<v Speaker 4>they're on pot and they will do lose</v>
<v Speaker 4>their mind and maybe they shouldn't be</v>

3011
02:17:25.621 --> 02:17:27.660
<v Speaker 4>intoxicated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but those people probably lose their</v>

3012
02:17:27.661 --> 02:17:29.670
<v Speaker 4>mind if someone yelled at them right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

3013
02:17:29.860 --> 02:17:31.620
<v Speaker 4>Some people would just weak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just,</v>

3014
02:17:31.650 --> 02:17:34.590
<v Speaker 4>whatever the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the glue that keeps their reality</v>

3015
02:17:34.591 --> 02:17:38.040
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just really fragile and then throw</v>

3016
02:17:38.041 --> 02:17:39.960
<v Speaker 4>some pot in there or a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3017
02:17:39.961 --> 02:17:44.550
<v Speaker 4>how many people do we know that have one</v>
<v Speaker 4>drink and they get fucking crazy.</v>

3018
02:17:44.551 --> 02:17:46.980
<v Speaker 4>That's a person who's reality's really</v>
<v Speaker 4>shaky.</v>

3019
02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:48.540
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that doesn't have anything to do</v>

3020
02:17:48.541 --> 02:17:49.860
<v Speaker 4>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3021
02:17:49.870 --> 02:17:54.870
<v Speaker 4>and the idea that cops look towards that</v>
<v Speaker 4>as being the standard is ridiculous.</v>

3022
02:17:56.390 --> 02:17:57.320
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you like,</v>

3023
02:17:57.330 --> 02:17:59.520
<v Speaker 4>if it wasn't going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have like a festival,</v>

3024
02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:02.070
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a cop's test,</v>

3025
02:18:02.100 --> 02:18:05.070
<v Speaker 4>potheads festival,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we would do it.</v>

3026
02:18:05.290 --> 02:18:09.070
<v Speaker 4>We would fucking do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look for sure you have go-karts.</v>

3027
02:18:09.270 --> 02:18:10.320
<v Speaker 4>Set it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you want to do?</v>

3028
02:18:10.321 --> 02:18:13.530
<v Speaker 4>You want to have a fucking one of those</v>
<v Speaker 4>mud bogger races.</v>

3029
02:18:13.820 --> 02:18:15.090
<v Speaker 4>We'll do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let us smoke pot.</v>

3030
02:18:15.091 --> 02:18:16.740
<v Speaker 4>We'll do all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll have jujitsu tournaments where</v>

3031
02:18:16.741 --> 02:18:20.760
<v Speaker 4>people smoke pot before they do jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It orange cones and clipboards and some</v>

3032
02:18:20.761 --> 02:18:23.460
<v Speaker 4>wheat and people will join.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>

3033
02:18:23.461 --> 02:18:24.690
<v Speaker 4>And we'll learn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll know.</v>

3034
02:18:24.780 --> 02:18:27.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you need to show some sort of</v>

3035
02:18:27.421 --> 02:18:31.260
<v Speaker 4>significant issue because there's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>significant issue with some people,</v>

3036
02:18:31.261 --> 02:18:33.990
<v Speaker 4>but you're not even stopping those</v>
<v Speaker 4>people from taking.</v>

3037
02:18:33.991 --> 02:18:38.070
<v Speaker 4>Who knows what the fuck they're taking</v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as antidepressants are</v>

3038
02:18:38.071 --> 02:18:40.980
<v Speaker 4>psychoactive substances prescribed by</v>
<v Speaker 4>their doctors.</v>

3039
02:18:40.981 --> 02:18:43.560
<v Speaker 4>And how many people are on fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>adderall?</v>

3040
02:18:43.561 --> 02:18:44.560
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's meth.</v>

3041
02:18:44.580 --> 02:18:46.560
<v Speaker 4>They're taking meth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're driving around.</v>

3042
02:18:47.130 --> 02:18:49.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a bunch of adults that take that</v>

3043
02:18:49.921 --> 02:18:53.080
<v Speaker 4>shit on a daily basis yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So w,</v>

3044
02:18:53.130 --> 02:18:56.550
<v Speaker 4>what you're dealing with is a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>different chemicals that could</v>

3045
02:18:56.551 --> 02:18:59.010
<v Speaker 4>potentially fuck with a mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why are you concentrated on pot</v>

3046
02:18:59.910 --> 02:19:02.100
<v Speaker 4>given shown any reason to concentrate on</v>
<v Speaker 4>pot.</v>

3047
02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:04.940
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the chIef of police in New York city</v>

3048
02:19:04.941 --> 02:19:09.941
<v Speaker 8>recently said that every crime could be</v>
<v Speaker 8>tied back to marijuana that's holding</v>

3049
02:19:11.571 --> 02:19:12.404
<v Speaker 8>him,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3050
02:19:12.460 --> 02:19:15.020
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is a criminal outrageous because</v>

3051
02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:19.760
<v Speaker 8>it's just trying to give more reach for</v>
<v Speaker 8>police officers to pull you over.</v>

3052
02:19:21.290 --> 02:19:23.900
<v Speaker 8>Irresponsible thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's like saying every crime can be</v>

3053
02:19:23.901 --> 02:19:25.700
<v Speaker 8>tied back to water.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Parents,</v>

3054
02:19:26.030 --> 02:19:27.900
<v Speaker 8>we all have 96 of water.</v>
<v Speaker 8>All.</v>

3055
02:19:29.090 --> 02:19:31.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all stupid man.</v>

3056
02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:35.090
<v Speaker 4>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just something that should be a</v>

3057
02:19:35.091 --> 02:19:37.940
<v Speaker 4>joke that We look back on from the 19</v>
<v Speaker 4>thirties.</v>

3058
02:19:37.970 --> 02:19:39.140
<v Speaker 4>We look back and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh wow,</v>

3059
02:19:39.141 --> 02:19:41.750
<v Speaker 4>look at the craziness that these people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are dealing with baCk then.</v>

3060
02:19:42.020 --> 02:19:45.350
<v Speaker 4>But instead we have to deal with it</v>
<v Speaker 4>today and the age of google and</v>

3061
02:19:45.351 --> 02:19:49.160
<v Speaker 4>information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scientific studies ad nauseum that all</v>

3062
02:19:49.161 --> 02:19:51.800
<v Speaker 4>show the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And none of Them show any negative</v>

3063
02:19:51.801 --> 02:19:52.850
<v Speaker 4>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>None of them.</v>

3064
02:19:53.180 --> 02:19:54.830
<v Speaker 4>There's like some questions about</v>
<v Speaker 4>memory.</v>

3065
02:19:54.860 --> 02:19:56.780
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it seems to only affect you while</v>

3066
02:19:56.781 --> 02:19:58.010
<v Speaker 4>you're on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you get off of it.</v>

3067
02:19:58.011 --> 02:19:59.900
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem to have any effect on</v>
<v Speaker 4>your memory at all.</v>

3068
02:20:00.630 --> 02:20:03.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the head of the dea currently said</v>

3069
02:20:03.750 --> 02:20:05.430
<v Speaker 2>medical marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just a joke.</v>

3070
02:20:05.431 --> 02:20:06.900
<v Speaker 2>Let let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get past that.</v>

3071
02:20:07.260 --> 02:20:12.260
<v Speaker 2>And I'm the head of the dea before that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when asked by congress it,</v>

3072
02:20:14.130 --> 02:20:17.880
<v Speaker 2>is marijuana a more detrimental than</v>
<v Speaker 2>meth?</v>

3073
02:20:18.330 --> 02:20:20.550
<v Speaker 2>She said she can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we played that many times</v>

3074
02:20:20.550 --> 02:20:21.950
<v Speaker 4>was on the show because it's so</v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous.</v>

3075
02:20:22.010 --> 02:20:23.170
<v Speaker 4>That was laying heart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3076
02:20:23.171 --> 02:20:24.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was in.</v>

3077
02:20:24.040 --> 02:20:26.850
<v Speaker 4>This was a senator or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>kept grilling her.</v>

3078
02:20:27.720 --> 02:20:30.120
<v Speaker 4>If you haven't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking infuriating.</v>

3079
02:20:30.170 --> 02:20:33.350
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's so infuriating also is that we</v>

3080
02:20:33.351 --> 02:20:37.040
<v Speaker 2>all know so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come these people who are in power</v>

3081
02:20:38.030 --> 02:20:39.500
<v Speaker 2>aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't in the know why</v>

3082
02:20:41.230 --> 02:20:43.890
<v Speaker 4>not a no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's that they are the official</v>

3083
02:20:43.920 --> 02:20:45.090
<v Speaker 4>response.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3084
02:20:45.150 --> 02:20:47.490
<v Speaker 4>So they looked at ladies just doing her</v>
<v Speaker 4>job.</v>

3085
02:20:47.640 --> 02:20:50.040
<v Speaker 4>She couldn't just speak out of turn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She couldn't.</v>

3086
02:20:50.041 --> 02:20:52.200
<v Speaker 4>She would get fired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She couldn't just say whatever she</v>

3087
02:20:52.201 --> 02:20:53.130
<v Speaker 4>wants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if she doesn't.</v>

3088
02:20:53.310 --> 02:20:55.470
<v Speaker 4>Even if she doesn't believe that it</v>
<v Speaker 4>should be illegal,</v>

3089
02:20:55.860 --> 02:20:57.900
<v Speaker 4>she's not going to say that because</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not her job.</v>

3090
02:20:57.901 --> 02:21:01.950
<v Speaker 4>Her job is to do whatever the fuck her</v>
<v Speaker 4>superiors tell her to do and to stay</v>

3091
02:21:01.951 --> 02:21:05.220
<v Speaker 4>employed and make sure her budget</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't get exactly.</v>

3092
02:21:05.221 --> 02:21:06.960
<v Speaker 4>That's her job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not even her fault.</v>

3093
02:21:06.980 --> 02:21:10.260
<v Speaker 4>It's the fault of the system that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>accept that the whole thing is</v>

3094
02:21:10.261 --> 02:21:11.370
<v Speaker 4>preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>IT doesn't,</v>

3095
02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:13.110
<v Speaker 4>doesn't hold up anymore.</v>

3096
02:21:13.160 --> 02:21:14.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why we have to play this game of</v>

3097
02:21:14.931 --> 02:21:16.340
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3098
02:21:16.430 --> 02:21:18.380
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just want to want to run a business</v>

3099
02:21:18.580 --> 02:21:20.730
<v Speaker 2>and a good business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have to play this game of</v>

3100
02:21:20.731 --> 02:21:24.680
<v Speaker 2>politics because if we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the bottom effect change through</v>

3101
02:21:24.681 --> 02:21:29.060
<v Speaker 2>those people who are at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we didn't and let them continue to</v>

3102
02:21:29.061 --> 02:21:32.330
<v Speaker 2>create these laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could just go another 20 years with</v>

3103
02:21:32.600 --> 02:21:35.870
<v Speaker 2>these bad laws when there's no reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it,</v>

3104
02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:36.903
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3105
02:21:37.480 --> 02:21:40.840
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just hoping that what's gonna go on</v>

3106
02:21:40.841 --> 02:21:43.750
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you know from the time that I first</v>

3107
02:21:43.751 --> 02:21:47.020
<v Speaker 4>got my license up today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much more open?</v>

3108
02:21:47.080 --> 02:21:49.600
<v Speaker 4>It's been much more relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are much more accepting,</v>

3109
02:21:49.601 --> 02:21:52.390
<v Speaker 4>people are of it and much more accepting</v>
<v Speaker 4>amongst grown adults.</v>

3110
02:21:52.391 --> 02:21:55.290
<v Speaker 4>You just see the attitudes of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're changing and people</v>

3111
02:21:55.310 --> 02:21:58.360
<v Speaker 4>understanding how beneficial or how</v>
<v Speaker 4>beneficial it is,</v>

3112
02:21:58.361 --> 02:22:00.190
<v Speaker 4>especially for people who need it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Medically.</v>

3113
02:22:00.520 --> 02:22:02.200
<v Speaker 4>Cancer patients,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

3114
02:22:02.230 --> 02:22:05.710
<v Speaker 4>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kids with epilepsy add things along</v>

3115
02:22:05.711 --> 02:22:07.690
<v Speaker 4>those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just so many people that benefit</v>

3116
02:22:07.691 --> 02:22:08.160
<v Speaker 4>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3117
02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:12.790
<v Speaker 4>it's hopefully it's on its way out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the laws are on their way out.</v>

3118
02:22:12.820 --> 02:22:13.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3119
02:22:13.230 --> 02:22:15.840
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can't just disregard the</v>

3120
02:22:15.841 --> 02:22:18.630
<v Speaker 2>experience of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the masses.</v>

3121
02:22:18.750 --> 02:22:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3122
02:22:20.910 --> 02:22:25.590
<v Speaker 2>It's not fair and it's because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're lucky to be in sort of the media</v>

3123
02:22:25.591 --> 02:22:25.980
<v Speaker 2>age,</v>

3124
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:29.650
<v Speaker 5>which can be annoying at times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it also allows information at move</v>

3125
02:22:29.651 --> 02:22:30.560
<v Speaker 5>very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3126
02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:33.780
<v Speaker 5>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if your kid is helped by having fewer</v>

3127
02:22:33.781 --> 02:22:36.000
<v Speaker 5>seizures,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's gonna know about that in 24</v>

3128
02:22:36.001 --> 02:22:36.830
<v Speaker 5>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so.</v>

3129
02:22:36.830 --> 02:22:40.140
<v Speaker 5>So you can't really suppress the truth</v>
<v Speaker 5>any longer.</v>

3130
02:22:40.380 --> 02:22:43.550
<v Speaker 5>And even Texas is polling positively.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3135

<v Speaker 5>there's no other way around it.</v>
