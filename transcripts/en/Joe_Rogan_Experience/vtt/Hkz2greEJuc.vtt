<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me about it.</v>

14
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nailed it with those.</v>

15
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.240
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what was the idea behind the company </v>

16
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.091
<v Speaker 1>is like some low sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low carb Nutricia and yet at the time </v>

17
00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:41.520
<v Speaker 1>that we were thinking of launching the </v>
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

18
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:46.521
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing on the market that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>would eat at either tasted terribly and </v>

19
00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>was good for you or it tasted great and </v>
<v Speaker 1>was horrible for you.</v>

20
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:53.271
<v Speaker 1>So we wanted to create the first bar </v>
<v Speaker 1>that tasted like it had sugar but </v>

21
00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:53.271
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>

22
00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Speaker 1>And metabolically speaking had a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>response to it.</v>

23
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:59.001
<v Speaker 1>It's a grind man to find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you try to go on a Keto Diet and you </v>

24
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.590
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to find like really good,</v>

25
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>delicious stuff to snack on,</v>

26
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>like boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a question.</v>

27
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Two quest bars kick you out of Ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

28
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 1>really know if I eat a full bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be out.</v>

29
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

30
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>But it only has nine grams of carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grams of protein is high,</v>

31
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:17.540
<v Speaker 1>so it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

32
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>it's actually less than that depending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you count net carbs or full blown?</v>

33
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very loose with it.</v>

34
00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't do a whole lot of counting </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbs.</v>

35
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>For the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm doing is eating whole foods.</v>

36
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.990
<v Speaker 1>The most part I'm doing is a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that primal kitchen.</v>

37
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.030
<v Speaker 1>You know that pole lay Mayo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that aaa lime,</v>

38
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Mayo Bullshit.</v>

39
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Fucking fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might eat a case of that a month and </v>

40
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.111
<v Speaker 1>I'm not bullshitting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put it on everything because it's </v>

41
00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:49.170
<v Speaker 1>super high fat and really delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I put it on eggs.</v>

42
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.400
<v Speaker 1>I go cook up a couple of eggs in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and then I'll take some scoops </v>

43
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.671
<v Speaker 1>so that chipotle a line male and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>slap it on there with sliced Jalapenos </v>

44
00:01:57.671 --> 00:01:59.370
<v Speaker 1>and so we get a lot of facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the macros on it?</v>

45
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't talk to that.</v>

46
00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 1>All that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you stay in Ketosis,</v>

47
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.770
<v Speaker 1>you can take your blood levels have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

48
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.830
<v Speaker 1>I have do it on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just essentially eat.</v>

49
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:15.831
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what I'm doing is for the most </v>

50
00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:15.831
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm eating foods,</v>

51
00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>the foods that I'm eating are very high </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>

52
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.020
<v Speaker 1>very low carbs and then 20 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time I fuck off 20 percent of the </v>

53
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:30.441
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 20 percent into like I try not to </v>

54
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:30.441
<v Speaker 1>fuck off too hard.</v>

55
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Like with desserts and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you like desserts?</v>

56
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even on a Keto Diet,</v>

57
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>you don't find that that's reduced?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

58
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>it is reduced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you start eating the ice cream,</v>

59
00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:39.170
<v Speaker 1>you remember how awesome it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

60
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>But a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot exoticness ketones don't fuck with</v>

61
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>never done ever exhaust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

62
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.540
<v Speaker 1>did I try it once?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I did,</v>

63
00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:47.910
<v Speaker 1>I was told that it would like help with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the headache and I was like,</v>

64
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:49.070
<v Speaker 1>I call bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

65
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For like the Keto flu.</v>

66
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't when I had,</v>

67
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:56.220
<v Speaker 1>I did have keto flu profoundly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

68
00:02:56.221 --> 00:03:01.221
<v Speaker 1>but that's what happens when you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb ass the first time that you try </v>

69
00:03:01.221 --> 00:03:01.221
<v Speaker 1>going ketogenic.</v>

70
00:03:01.221 --> 00:03:01.330
<v Speaker 2>How did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

71
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.360
<v Speaker 2>what'd you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went true four to one after a three </v>

72
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.360
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fast forward to one.</v>

73
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.831
<v Speaker 2>Explain that to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for every gram of combined protein </v>

74
00:03:10.831 --> 00:03:11.810
<v Speaker 2>and carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ate.</v>

75
00:03:11.811 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 2>I ate four grams of fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is brutally difficult to do.</v>

76
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:19.711
<v Speaker 2>You never going to do it by accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a spreadsheet and everything that </v>

77
00:03:19.711 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 2>I ate had to go through the math.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had to figure out like,</v>

78
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:24.320
<v Speaker 2>what's this going to be as a total meal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

79
00:03:24.321 --> 00:03:29.321
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you literally have to like scrape every </v>

80
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 2>bit of oil out of the pan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you've got to be hardcore sop up.</v>

81
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:34.471
<v Speaker 2>Like if you've got cabbage or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sop up all the oil to make sure that </v>

82
00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:34.471
<v Speaker 2>you're getting it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was hateful.</v>

83
00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:39.301
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely hated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so disgusting and dom has talked </v>

84
00:03:39.301 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The palatability afforded one is very,</v>

85
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 2>very low at the time I thought I needed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>

86
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to do cancer prevention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

87
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 2>so I went hard hardcore Quito trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get the ratio between my blood glucose </v>

88
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 2>and my ketones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

89
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.860
<v Speaker 2>Were you experiencing health </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficulties?</v>

90
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

91
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:56.641
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at quest we were really trying to </v>

92
00:03:56.641 --> 00:03:58.381
<v Speaker 2>like experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like find out what's the edge of this </v>

93
00:03:58.381 --> 00:03:58.381
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were putting millions of dollars into</v>

94
00:03:58.381 --> 00:03:59.250
<v Speaker 2>research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially into cancer.</v>

95
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to find out like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does a ketogenic diet have the positive </v>

96
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 2>implications on cancer that we hope it </v>
<v Speaker 2>does?</v>

97
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.680
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in a clip that I saw on your </v>

98
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.680
<v Speaker 2>show when dom was on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about that the,</v>

99
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.631
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the enter the energy crisis that the </v>

100
00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 2>cells go through that are cancerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>because some forms of cancer.</v>

101
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

102
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 2>there's some funny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all of them.</v>

103
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:23.990
<v Speaker 2>I know some people are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an article recently about </v>

104
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.671
<v Speaker 2>brain cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a type of brain cancer that </v>

105
00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:26.671
<v Speaker 2>actually lived off of fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

106
00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 2>that didn't respond to a low carb diet.</v>

107
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe there's several different </v>

108
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 2>kinds of cancer and so I don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the data's in on that.</v>

109
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your idea was just to do it just to </v>

110
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.090
<v Speaker 2>get yourself in a really healthy state </v>
<v Speaker 2>and monitor your own.</v>

111
00:04:41.091 --> 00:04:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My thing was like if,</v>

112
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.820
<v Speaker 2>if it has that potential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worth trying.</v>

113
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the three day fast,</v>

114
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:49.020
<v Speaker 2>not a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then two weeks of being in Ketosis,</v>

115
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.030
<v Speaker 2>going into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how hard it was going to </v>

116
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.030
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what four to one was going</v>

117
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.820
<v Speaker 2>to feel like and I didn't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement.</v>

118
00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was real misery and I really did have</v>

119
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:00.460
<v Speaker 2>what they call the Keto flu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel like you have the flu.</v>

120
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:05.461
<v Speaker 2>It's sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my whole thing is like being uber </v>

121
00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:05.500
<v Speaker 2>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once I commit to something,</v>

122
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:10.501
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to stop just because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>sucks and I wasn't smart enough to go </v>

123
00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:10.690
<v Speaker 2>and ask somebody.</v>

124
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>

125
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.040
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a way to supplement your way </v>

126
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.040
<v Speaker 2>out of this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

127
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.040
<v Speaker 2>so I just muscled through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was total misery.</v>

128
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why you never tried </v>

129
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.460
<v Speaker 2>exogenous ketones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make a lot of sales.</v>

130
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.880
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Peter Attia,</v>

131
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:22.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

132
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.730
<v Speaker 2>you don't know Peter Attia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is it?</v>

133
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 2>You have to immediately get them on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

134
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:29.050
<v Speaker 2>So Peter Attia is a good friend of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominic d'agostino.</v>

135
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.290
<v Speaker 2>So that would be an easy connect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's a doctor,</v>

136
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:33.510
<v Speaker 2>a physician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

137
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 2>he did a ted talk which crushed </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely amazing.</v>

138
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.730
<v Speaker 2>And he goes from practicing traditional </v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine.</v>

139
00:05:39.731 --> 00:05:41.530
<v Speaker 2>And this is his ted talks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't me,</v>

140
00:05:41.531 --> 00:05:46.531
<v Speaker 2>this is him saying it being fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>judgmental about the people that just </v>

141
00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:48.380
<v Speaker 2>treating this woman comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she has diabetes and um,</v>

142
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she was either there to have an </v>

143
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.590
<v Speaker 2>amputation or she'd already had won </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

144
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.590
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he realizes and as he starts all this </v>

145
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 2>down to this is like a human being and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

146
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing isn't solving the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

147
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:06.791
<v Speaker 2>So he's like somewhere the system is </v>
<v Speaker 2>failing a lot of people and how do we </v>

148
00:06:06.791 --> 00:06:06.791
<v Speaker 2>rectify it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

149
00:06:06.791 --> 00:06:09.920
<v Speaker 2>and as he's giving the Ted talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he starts like crying is so amazing,</v>

150
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 2>especially getting to know him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing that it's totally sincere.</v>

151
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:17.681
<v Speaker 2>This is not a guy faking it for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>camera and so ends up completely </v>

152
00:06:17.681 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 2>changing his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He starts,</v>

153
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm really trying to figure out what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

154
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:26.111
<v Speaker 2>Metabolically finds high-fat finds </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenics for awhile was known as the </v>

155
00:06:26.111 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 2>the fat man or the Quito man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what they call them,</v>

156
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.010
<v Speaker 2>but long before I'd ever heard of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenics and starts new,</v>

157
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.100
<v Speaker 2>see you heard a new nutritional science </v>
<v Speaker 2>initiative raises a ton of money and </v>

158
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:43.931
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to do like real </v>
<v Speaker 2>double-blind empirical studies on </v>

159
00:06:43.931 --> 00:06:43.931
<v Speaker 2>nutrition because they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>

160
00:06:43.931 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 2>like there's so much guesswork in all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

161
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 2>We really want to prove it ends up </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaving that.</v>

162
00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:53.441
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't speak to why I honestly don't </v>

163
00:06:53.441 --> 00:06:53.441
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ends up leaving new.</v>

164
00:06:53.441 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 2>See I'm founding a private practice as </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a high end concierge guy.</v>

165
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.770
<v Speaker 2>We were trying to get them involved at </v>
<v Speaker 2>quest just because his,</v>

166
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.040
<v Speaker 2>nutritionally this guy's mind is unreal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so talking to him about that stuff </v>

167
00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:06.860
<v Speaker 2>and him walking us through like Keto flu</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how you can actually supplement your</v>

168
00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:11.861
<v Speaker 2>way out of it and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I unfortunately didn't know it at </v>

169
00:07:11.861 --> 00:07:11.861
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

170
00:07:11.861 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suffered needlessly.</v>

171
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.330
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

172
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.850
<v Speaker 2>that's the flu thing is a weird feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

173
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:20.570
<v Speaker 2>Because your body just feels so weak and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand it.</v>

174
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:23.420
<v Speaker 2>You'd be eating and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you almost learned denial.</v>

175
00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't believe that this is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbs.</v>

176
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.070
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is something something's going</v>

177
00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:28.430
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

178
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:33.710
<v Speaker 2>Is it carves or is it protein?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I guess gluconeogenesis is </v>

179
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.110
<v Speaker 2>turning the protein into glucose but it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is weird.</v>

180
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Or is it that and this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually don't know the answer to and </v>

181
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.151
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm now outside my realm of what I </v>

182
00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:44.151
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So full disclosure,</v>

183
00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:48.100
<v Speaker 2>but there's obviously something in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>micro nutrients because the people that </v>

184
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.800
<v Speaker 2>later told me you could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplemented your way out of this.</v>

185
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.690
<v Speaker 2>They were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't remember well,</v>

186
00:07:50.691 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 2>but it was like magnesium and some other</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

187
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.170
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

188
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:54.760
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

189
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.800
<v Speaker 2>have more carbs or more protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I will say at a two to one diet you </v>

190
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.660
<v Speaker 2>at least I didn't experience the flu at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all and that was sustainable and I did </v>

191
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:05.090
<v Speaker 2>that for nine months and that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>

192
00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:10.091
<v Speaker 2>It was transformative from an anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammatory perspective is just </v>

193
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:10.091
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable.</v>

194
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:14.140
<v Speaker 2>So just more low carb than Quito total.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've been low carb for a very long </v>

195
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.701
<v Speaker 2>time because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I am having a cheat weekend and you </v>

196
00:08:18.701 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 2>were talking about this just before we </v>
<v Speaker 2>went live,</v>

197
00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.330
<v Speaker 2>if I'm having a cheat way can be raw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can hear me getting fatter.</v>

198
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Like it is so crazy how well my body </v>
<v Speaker 2>turns a calorie into adipose tissue.</v>

199
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:32.130
<v Speaker 2>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fatter.</v>

200
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.950
<v Speaker 2>Quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get fat very,</v>

201
00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:36.290
<v Speaker 2>very fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with carbohydrate.</v>

202
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even if I spiked my calories and </v>

203
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:41.480
<v Speaker 2>they're all clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get fat fast.</v>

204
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this didn't used to be the case </v>

205
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.640
<v Speaker 2>before you tried these low carb diets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this is always the case always.</v>

206
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:46.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

207
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.190
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't until.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

208
00:08:47.191 --> 00:08:48.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I tried low carb.</v>

209
00:08:48.671 --> 00:08:52.370
<v Speaker 2>So I'm so frustrated with always being </v>
<v Speaker 2>like having a wet look,</v>

210
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:53.580
<v Speaker 2>a wet look.</v>

211
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.030
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

212
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.260
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm making that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what my partners and I used to</v>

213
00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 2>refer to people like me who just have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural smooth layer of fat,</v>

214
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:07.041
<v Speaker 2>like I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to do so much cardio to get that </v>

215
00:09:07.041 --> 00:09:08.040
<v Speaker 2>like dry look where you just really </v>
<v Speaker 2>tight,</v>

216
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.190
<v Speaker 2>like a massive amount of cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is that the case even with a,</v>

217
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:17.500
<v Speaker 2>like a low carb diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you get to lean on a low carb </v>

218
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.550
<v Speaker 2>diet to be sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't.</v>

219
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:22.470
<v Speaker 2>Like if I want to be lean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lean,</v>

220
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.560
<v Speaker 2>I have to do cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're essentially got a really good </v>

221
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:27.890
<v Speaker 2>adaptation body for famine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yell,</v>

222
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.210
<v Speaker 2>I'll survive a famine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Zombie apocalypse.</v>

223
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.160
<v Speaker 2>I've got you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm making it through that.</v>

224
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Very confident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you watch walking dead?</v>

225
00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:36.480
<v Speaker 2>Because a lot of people that think </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna make it.</v>

226
00:09:36.481 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 2>They don't make them in a way behind.</v>

227
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm on like seasoned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where'd you stop?</v>

228
00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Because people are telling me I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to jump on when they killed Glen.</v>

229
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a spoiler alert.</v>

230
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:48.140
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

231
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made it that far.</v>

232
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.800
<v Speaker 2>I made it that far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

233
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:53.760
<v Speaker 2>now we're beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

234
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:58.761
<v Speaker 2>But here's what I find interesting about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is I want to do like some content </v>

235
00:09:58.761 --> 00:10:02.270
<v Speaker 2>on what are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the 10 leadership lessons you can </v>

236
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:02.280
<v Speaker 2>learn from the walking dead because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think they're,</v>

237
00:10:02.281 --> 00:10:04.290
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I find interesting about the</v>

238
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:06.660
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rick is inconsistent.</v>

239
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm not buying them in this last season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I bailed out.</v>

240
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

241
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:17.361
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what leadership thinks you're going to </v>

242
00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:17.361
<v Speaker 2>learn when everyone's turned to shit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of people killing each other.</v>

243
00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:22.340
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's go to one that you would have </v>

244
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:22.740
<v Speaker 2>seen because before Glenn dies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got the kid,</v>

245
00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:24.460
<v Speaker 2>they find them at the bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy,</v>

246
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:29.580
<v Speaker 2>his team mates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a better word for that is </v>

247
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:29.580
<v Speaker 2>clan.</v>

248
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:29.580
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go ballistic.</v>

249
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.800
<v Speaker 2>They start shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take back to your place and you want</v>

250
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.220
<v Speaker 2>to help him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He failed his leg.</v>

251
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:33.880
<v Speaker 2>He's hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you kill them?</v>

252
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.100
<v Speaker 2>Do you set them free?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

253
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.340
<v Speaker 2>A Web TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not real.</v>

254
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.850
<v Speaker 2>You have to be a really around the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to know.</v>

255
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

256
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:48.260
<v Speaker 2>I think it's part logic and part </v>
<v Speaker 2>instinct when you're dealing with a </v>

257
00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.740
<v Speaker 2>situation like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how much of this guy's behavior was</v>

258
00:10:49.741 --> 00:10:53.130
<v Speaker 2>because he was stuck with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>other shitty people and how different is</v>

259
00:10:53.131 --> 00:10:58.131
<v Speaker 2>he when he's free and how much does he </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to reason and logic and how much </v>

260
00:10:58.131 --> 00:10:59.790
<v Speaker 2>is he willing to contemplate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility that there's a better life.</v>

261
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Everybody works together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If not kill them.</v>

262
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:07.970
<v Speaker 2>You don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think that he's imaginably </v>

263
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:08.520
<v Speaker 2>damaged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe he's a big liar,</v>

264
00:11:08.521 --> 00:11:10.320
<v Speaker 2>he lies about a lot of stuff and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

265
00:11:10.321 --> 00:11:11.310
<v Speaker 2>you can't count on him.</v>

266
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.910
<v Speaker 2>You know he's going to be a liability </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's not going to be an asset and he</v>

267
00:11:14.911 --> 00:11:17.220
<v Speaker 2>might very well tried to kill you in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your sleep or something like that.</v>

268
00:11:17.221 --> 00:11:17.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to kill him.</v>

269
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:18.810
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

270
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:24.050
<v Speaker 2>That's what I find interesting about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>show is that it makes you think about </v>

271
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.050
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this.</v>

272
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.890
<v Speaker 2>If something does happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like asteroidal impact,</v>

273
00:11:25.891 --> 00:11:30.891
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's only like 10 percent of the </v>

274
00:11:30.891 --> 00:11:32.961
<v Speaker 2>people left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to be amongst those 10 </v>

275
00:11:32.961 --> 00:11:32.961
<v Speaker 2>percent of the people or would you </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather be one of the people that died?</v>

276
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.650
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems like a trick question.</v>

277
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.270
<v Speaker 2>I want to be one of the 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

278
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.670
<v Speaker 2>can I just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you read the stand by?</v>

279
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:39.930
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no dude,</v>

280
00:11:39.931 --> 00:11:41.090
<v Speaker 2>you would love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

281
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.070
<v Speaker 2>So it's about your super flew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

282
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.850
<v Speaker 2>So wipes out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say it's 10 percent.</v>

283
00:11:44.851 --> 00:11:47.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what the number is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wipes out virtually everybody.</v>

284
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.610
<v Speaker 2>And then the remaining people have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>task of rebuilding society analysis,</v>

285
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.800
<v Speaker 2>Stephen King novels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of weird shit going on.</v>

286
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.930
<v Speaker 1>But that captured my imagination so </v>
<v Speaker 1>profoundly when I read it,</v>

287
00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.960
<v Speaker 1>I read it probably 15 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

288
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:04.150
<v Speaker 1>I still think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that would,</v>

289
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:09.151
<v Speaker 1>while I wouldn't want it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because inevitably a lot of people that </v>

290
00:12:09.151 --> 00:12:09.470
<v Speaker 1>you love end up being in the 90 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

291
00:12:09.471 --> 00:12:11.480
<v Speaker 1>so that would suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

292
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:16.060
<v Speaker 1>but if it happened it would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating to see how we rebuild.</v>

293
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:21.300
<v Speaker 1>But if you've seen the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty dark take on what </v>

294
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:21.300
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

295
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little more optimistically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

296
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:28.380
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be wonderful if you really can </v>

297
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.051
<v Speaker 1>survive and you really find a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live off the land and you find a good </v>

298
00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:34.051
<v Speaker 1>group of people and you all work in </v>
<v Speaker 1>coordination and he cooperate and you </v>

299
00:12:34.051 --> 00:12:38.641
<v Speaker 1>have a wonderful little civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take care of each other or if you get </v>

300
00:12:38.641 --> 00:12:42.490
<v Speaker 1>horribly ugly and then you could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with the cannibals and marauders</v>

301
00:12:42.491 --> 00:12:46.390
<v Speaker 1>and people invading you and where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you fall?</v>

302
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.030
<v Speaker 1>But what do you mean 90 percent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten percent.</v>

303
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent or 90 percent really.</v>

304
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:52.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have with that rock.</v>

305
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll call this dude.</v>

306
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.920
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't want to be one of those </v>

307
00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:58.920
<v Speaker 1>survivors when there's nothing left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

308
00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.590
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be dealing with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing if you can eat it.</v>

309
00:12:59.591 --> 00:13:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Charred foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

310
00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.520
<v Speaker 1>because you're super starving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

311
00:13:04.521 --> 00:13:05.500
<v Speaker 1>put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

312
00:13:05.501 --> 00:13:06.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

313
00:13:06.581 --> 00:13:11.581
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a copout look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only reason why we're here is </v>

314
00:13:11.581 --> 00:13:11.581
<v Speaker 1>because monkeys fucked when they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in trees,</v>

315
00:13:11.581 --> 00:13:16.460
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they figured out a way to get to </v>

316
00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:17.350
<v Speaker 1>become a person over who knows how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of generations or whatever it's</v>

317
00:13:17.351 --> 00:13:20.260
<v Speaker 1>been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think if you really stop and think</v>

318
00:13:20.261 --> 00:13:25.261
<v Speaker 1>about what your life would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if everybody out there was dead and </v>

319
00:13:25.261 --> 00:13:26.380
<v Speaker 1>there was only like 10 percent of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that first of all,</v>

320
00:13:26.381 --> 00:13:27.340
<v Speaker 1>90 percent of the people dead.</v>

321
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.310
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of stinking rotten bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to get through that.</v>

322
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.430
<v Speaker 1>How it's going to be awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be 10 percent.</v>

323
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:38.460
<v Speaker 1>What's the odds that any fuckers know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to work electricity or know how to </v>

324
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.880
<v Speaker 1>get a generator going or know how to re </v>
<v Speaker 1>up a power plant.</v>

325
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Like what if a power plant goes down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if uh,</v>

326
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.430
<v Speaker 1>the grid is down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to fix a car.</v>

327
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you even understand how a car works?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like most people don't?</v>

328
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Ten percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could get really unlucky and get </v>

329
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.970
<v Speaker 1>10 percent of the people who don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and they're just looking for a job.</v>

330
00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the people that survive.</v>

331
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.840
<v Speaker 1>No question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's the case,</v>

332
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.070
<v Speaker 1>you might not make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the,</v>

333
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.820
<v Speaker 1>the united,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>

334
00:14:06.821 --> 00:14:10.720
<v Speaker 1>but the human population got down to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing they think is low as like,</v>

335
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:16.770
<v Speaker 1>I want to say 7,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people at one point in time after the </v>

336
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:17.710
<v Speaker 1>eruption of a or something like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Super Volcano.</v>

337
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was some super volcano eruption </v>

338
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.051
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a theory that it dropped the </v>

339
00:14:25.051 --> 00:14:28.260
<v Speaker 1>human population down to an unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 1>low level and it was not that long ago </v>

340
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.710
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like 60,000</v>

341
00:14:29.711 --> 00:14:31.080
<v Speaker 1>years ago or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

342
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:33.160
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The timing,</v>

343
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:34.240
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had heard that,</v>

344
00:14:34.241 --> 00:14:36.010
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Good.</v>

345
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Not good if that's real 60,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

346
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you think of genetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity.</v>

347
00:14:40.211 --> 00:14:41.710
<v Speaker 1>That's really terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

348
00:14:41.711 --> 00:14:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that accounts for a lot of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuckups,</v>

349
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting too.</v>

350
00:14:45.341 --> 00:14:47.290
<v Speaker 1>And they also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they keep finding these new humans,</v>

351
00:14:47.291 --> 00:14:48.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fossilized.</v>

352
00:14:48.941 --> 00:14:49.840
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

353
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 1>like new humans that they didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>existed.</v>

354
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.350
<v Speaker 2>Like they found one in Russia fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>

355
00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:59.351
<v Speaker 2>like an offshoot of humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we just Kinda got lucky to make it </v>

356
00:14:59.351 --> 00:15:00.430
<v Speaker 2>to this that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

357
00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.420
<v Speaker 2>not read Homo Deus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

358
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.900
<v Speaker 2>So Noah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've all Harare also wrote sapiens.</v>

359
00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:09.230
<v Speaker 2>He talks about that sort of thing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>both of his books.</v>

360
00:15:09.231 --> 00:15:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Like how is it luck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do we have?</v>

361
00:15:12.231 --> 00:15:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Like what made humans the Apex Predator </v>
<v Speaker 2>and looking at,</v>

362
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our ability to be social.</v>

363
00:15:17.781 --> 00:15:19.760
<v Speaker 2>But where does that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you look at.</v>

364
00:15:19.761 --> 00:15:24.761
<v Speaker 2>So the way that he ended up defining it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the reasons that humans become the </v>

365
00:15:24.761 --> 00:15:26.360
<v Speaker 2>apex Predator is because unlike an ant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is actually very,</v>

366
00:15:26.361 --> 00:15:31.361
<v Speaker 2>very impressive with how they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>organize large number of hands beings,</v>

367
00:15:31.701 --> 00:15:33.560
<v Speaker 2>whatever you were classified as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

368
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:38.710
<v Speaker 2>they can't do it flexibly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like we have sort of a pre </v>

369
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:39.290
<v Speaker 2>written code and these are the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we do and that's it.</v>

370
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:44.290
<v Speaker 2>And you fall in the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to food like you build the </v>

371
00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.181
<v Speaker 2>colonies is always the same way humans </v>
<v Speaker 2>can organize and similarly large </v>

372
00:15:46.181 --> 00:15:46.460
<v Speaker 2>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can do it flexibly.</v>

373
00:15:46.461 --> 00:15:48.860
<v Speaker 2>So you can organize and watch a nascar </v>
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>

374
00:15:48.861 --> 00:15:51.460
<v Speaker 2>You can organize and fight a war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can organize and build a church like</v>

375
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:56.650
<v Speaker 2>whatever the ways that we want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>organize and one of the things he says </v>

376
00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:58.010
<v Speaker 2>is at the heart of that is our ability </v>
<v Speaker 2>to convey um,</v>

377
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.670
<v Speaker 2>kinship through something other than </v>
<v Speaker 2>genetic relations.</v>

378
00:16:01.671 --> 00:16:02.500
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

379
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.360
<v Speaker 2>what he refers to it as is like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the grand fiction,</v>

380
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:08.180
<v Speaker 2>the narrative that we tell each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is often religion or whatever,</v>

381
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.280
<v Speaker 2>but it lets people who've never met </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

382
00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way I always like to think of it.</v>

383
00:16:12.021 --> 00:16:17.021
<v Speaker 2>Imagine two guys that meet each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they both ride Harley's never ever </v>

384
00:16:17.021 --> 00:16:20.111
<v Speaker 2>met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they click right because they share </v>

385
00:16:20.111 --> 00:16:20.300
<v Speaker 2>that thing which is a stand in for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief system.</v>

386
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.640
<v Speaker 2>So that to me is pretty interesting as </v>
<v Speaker 2>to whether like,</v>

387
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.210
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his hypothesis is the reason that we</v>

388
00:16:26.211 --> 00:16:30.290
<v Speaker 2>ended up taking over neanderthals and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that was because because of that,</v>

389
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:34.250
<v Speaker 2>because we could organize using </v>
<v Speaker 2>symbology using metaphor,</v>

390
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:39.430
<v Speaker 2>we were able to organize more flexibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>in larger numbers and really be accurate</v>

391
00:16:40.341 --> 00:16:45.341
<v Speaker 2>with how to attack and things like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that we could eliminate to rival </v>

392
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.340
<v Speaker 2>clan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

393
00:16:46.341 --> 00:16:47.810
<v Speaker 2>totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

394
00:16:47.811 --> 00:16:50.090
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the more fascinating aspects</v>

395
00:16:50.091 --> 00:16:50.990
<v Speaker 2>of being a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

396
00:16:50.991 --> 00:16:53.150
<v Speaker 2>So we can assume so many different </v>
<v Speaker 2>forms,</v>

397
00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.300
<v Speaker 2>culture and behavior and the patterns </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we follow.</v>

398
00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.370
<v Speaker 2>But you gotta think if we got down with </v>
<v Speaker 2>7,000</v>

399
00:16:58.371 --> 00:16:59.420
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're pretty lucky.</v>

400
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Pretty lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that was,</v>

401
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:04.580
<v Speaker 2>wasn't like a full wipe out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking terrified of yellowstone.</v>

402
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of those,</v>

403
00:17:06.381 --> 00:17:10.580
<v Speaker 2>as you look closely at it as like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just pretend that that's not a threat.</v>

404
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what else to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing you can do,</v>

405
00:17:12.621 --> 00:17:13.820
<v Speaker 2>but if it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it goes,</v>

406
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.260
<v Speaker 2>it's a global one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

407
00:17:15.261 --> 00:17:18.020
<v Speaker 2>it's a real problem globally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's locally,</v>

408
00:17:18.021 --> 00:17:20.240
<v Speaker 2>it's a disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but globally it's,</v>

409
00:17:20.241 --> 00:17:22.490
<v Speaker 2>it's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to cloud the skies,</v>

410
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:24.110
<v Speaker 2>it's going to put us into a nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>winter.</v>

411
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:29.650
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those big ones like the one that they </v>

412
00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:29.650
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

413
00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:29.720
<v Speaker 2>did you find anything on that one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we.</v>

414
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.030
<v Speaker 2>Where was it a say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indonesia.</v>

415
00:17:33.031 --> 00:17:33.460
<v Speaker 2>South Asia.</v>

416
00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

417
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:39.480
<v Speaker 3>Something crazier on it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It said there's a couple of studies at </v>

418
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.751
<v Speaker 3>how many people were left and instead </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was roughly maybe a thousand </v>

419
00:17:41.751 --> 00:17:44.380
<v Speaker 3>reproductive adults,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some as low as 40 reproductive pairs,</v>

420
00:17:44.381 --> 00:17:47.560
<v Speaker 3>which it'd be like 80 people still be </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids maybe,</v>

421
00:17:47.561 --> 00:17:49.820
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's rough.</v>

422
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:55.710
<v Speaker 1>And the amount of Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely there was a drastic dip.</v>

423
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:58.800
<v Speaker 1>And then 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 10,000</v>

424
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:04.010
<v Speaker 1>bedraggled homosapien struggled together</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a pitiful little clumps hunting and </v>

425
00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.870
<v Speaker 1>gathering for thousands of years until </v>
<v Speaker 1>the late stone age.</v>

426
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we humans began to recover.</v>

427
00:18:09.451 --> 00:18:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Holy Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was a time.</v>

428
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

429
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't.</v>

430
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Damn near went extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

431
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.520
<v Speaker 1>So yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventy thousand BC.</v>

432
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.740
<v Speaker 1>So a little bit more than 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

433
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:23.700
<v Speaker 1>A volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on,</v>

434
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:28.820
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A called Toba in Sumatra or in </v>

435
00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.661
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Went off blowing roughly 650 miles of </v>

436
00:18:32.661 --> 00:18:36.771
<v Speaker 1>vaporized rock into the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the largest volcanic eruption we </v>

437
00:18:36.771 --> 00:18:36.960
<v Speaker 1>know of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dwarfing.</v>

438
00:18:36.961 --> 00:18:39.210
<v Speaker 1>Everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

439
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:40.630
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's comparison to.</v>

440
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting to see that you see </v>

441
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Mount Saint Helens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of ejected material versus.</v>

442
00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

443
00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.320
<v Speaker 1>so it got down to as low as 40 mating </v>
<v Speaker 1>pairs.</v>

444
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Studies suggest that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

445
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

446
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:02.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're just at the whim of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural forces that make mountains and </v>

447
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:07.970
<v Speaker 1>there's a giant volcano called Dara </v>
<v Speaker 1>volcano under yellowstone and I think </v>

448
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:12.850
<v Speaker 1>like a week ago they had something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>1500 earthquakes wasn't like some,</v>

449
00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:17.040
<v Speaker 1>some she's taken like a month and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month period of time.</v>

450
00:19:17.041 --> 00:19:17.240
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

451
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:22.250
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like really recently they talked </v>

452
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.921
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many earthquakes they had over a </v>

453
00:19:24.921 --> 00:19:26.190
<v Speaker 1>very short period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just constant and consistent.</v>

454
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Just crazy in June.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's at 400.</v>

455
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was something in,</v>

456
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was in July.</v>

457
00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.450
<v Speaker 1>It was another one like really recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

458
00:19:39.451 --> 00:19:44.451
<v Speaker 1>that just that kind of shit that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be 400 earthquakes and a month like </v>

459
00:19:44.451 --> 00:19:47.300
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight hundred and 78 weeks later.</v>

460
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.570
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

461
00:19:48.571 --> 00:19:52.230
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at 878 earthquakes in two </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks.</v>

462
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Does what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like 1200 plus earthquakes in a </v>

463
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:02.630
<v Speaker 1>month and two weeks for four.</v>

464
00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:09.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's not much small earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's the idea that there are so </v>

465
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.000
<v Speaker 1>significant volcanic activity under </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that we didn't even know was a</v>

466
00:20:12.001 --> 00:20:15.780
<v Speaker 1>volcano until like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say like a decade or two ago,</v>

467
00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:18.890
<v Speaker 1>they use satellite imagery to figure it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out that it was called Dara.</v>

468
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:21.390
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even know it is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

469
00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.430
<v Speaker 1>you can't see it until you get far </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough up that you really started to see</v>

470
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.130
<v Speaker 1>greater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's nuts.</v>

471
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They realized what it is.</v>

472
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:31.170
<v Speaker 1>It must've been like a horror movie when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pulled back and went,</v>

473
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.850
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

474
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:38.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like that scene in a twilight zone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to serve man.</v>

475
00:20:38.461 --> 00:20:40.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a cookbook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen that.</v>

476
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Never seen that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A precious few,</v>

477
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twilight zones to be honest,</v>

478
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.370
<v Speaker 1>to serve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the best ones.</v>

479
00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bunch of aliens.</v>

480
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Come down here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spoiler alert for 1950 bucks.</v>

481
00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:56.650
<v Speaker 1>But they come down here and they realize</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>

482
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:57.400
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

483
00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.970
<v Speaker 1>somewhere along the line people realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's something going on and that</v>

484
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.720
<v Speaker 1>they're taking these people board their </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaceship and they're not coming back.</v>

485
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:09.550
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end they've left this </v>
<v Speaker 1>book and the book they thought to serve,</v>

486
00:21:09.551 --> 00:21:12.460
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God was like they wanted to serve us.</v>

487
00:21:12.461 --> 00:21:15.580
<v Speaker 1>It turns out it's a cookbook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but too late,</v>

488
00:21:15.581 --> 00:21:17.560
<v Speaker 1>they're already bored spaceship ready to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get eaten.</v>

489
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.340
<v Speaker 1>It's dope to the twilight zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has some awesome endings.</v>

490
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I have to give it that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

491
00:21:21.461 --> 00:21:25.600
<v Speaker 1>they had such a bounty of premises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The premises are incredible.</v>

492
00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Only to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you stop and think about all the,</v>

493
00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:31.540
<v Speaker 1>you remember William Shatner with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>agility that the.</v>

494
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.510
<v Speaker 1>See that one where there was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've seen like three and I don't</v>

495
00:21:34.511 --> 00:21:35.110
<v Speaker 1>remember them.</v>

496
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.930
<v Speaker 1>He went to a diner and there was a place</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he,</v>

497
00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:42.931
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was at that had like one of those </v>

498
00:21:42.931 --> 00:21:42.931
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

499
00:21:42.931 --> 00:21:47.340
<v Speaker 1>like a fortune teller box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like these tabs jukeboxes that </v>

500
00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.790
<v Speaker 1>were in d.</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever see a jukebox in a diner?</v>

501
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

502
00:21:49.721 --> 00:21:53.080
<v Speaker 1>So like you'd be sitting at a table and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually control the music.</v>

503
00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:58.410
<v Speaker 1>This thing that you're seeing up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a fortune teller and you would </v>

504
00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:02.520
<v Speaker 1>put in a cent or one cent coin and ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>him a question,</v>

505
00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:07.550
<v Speaker 1>yes or no question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would give you answers and he became </v>

506
00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:09.961
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started started fucking with them and </v>

507
00:22:09.961 --> 00:22:11.170
<v Speaker 1>it was like it was getting too close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality as I say.</v>

508
00:22:11.171 --> 00:22:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Is it coming true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is he.</v>

509
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give away any spoilers,</v>

510
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.650
<v Speaker 1>but it was just a great show man.</v>

511
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean just they tried to bring it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

512
00:22:19.691 --> 00:22:22.030
<v Speaker 1>but I think it tanked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't they try to bring it back?</v>

513
00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:27.620
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say early nineties that I can </v>

514
00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:28.810
<v Speaker 1>be way off on the date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but was that.</v>

515
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:30.850
<v Speaker 1>They definitely tried to bring it back </v>
<v Speaker 1>without rod sterling.</v>

516
00:22:30.851 --> 00:22:35.851
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be tough and I wonder how </v>
<v Speaker 1>many of them were actually written by </v>

517
00:22:35.851 --> 00:22:38.671
<v Speaker 1>Rod Sterling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good question because he was always a </v>

518
00:22:38.671 --> 00:22:42.211
<v Speaker 1>host of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if he was just a host and it </v>

519
00:22:42.211 --> 00:22:42.211
<v Speaker 1>really didn't have nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

520
00:22:42.211 --> 00:22:43.150
<v Speaker 1>I brought it back in the eighties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>

521
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

522
00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:47.410
<v Speaker 1>It's hard when you get something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

523
00:22:47.411 --> 00:22:49.360
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to pay a lot for it because I</v>

524
00:22:49.361 --> 00:22:54.361
<v Speaker 1>know that was one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 1>they switched over the tower of terror </v>

525
00:22:54.361 --> 00:22:58.171
<v Speaker 1>ride at Disneyland to guardians of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxy was that they couldn't come to a </v>

526
00:22:58.391 --> 00:23:01.360
<v Speaker 1>licensing agreement with the twilight </v>
<v Speaker 1>zone.</v>

527
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

528
00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.920
<v Speaker 1>Because the tower of terror ride was </v>
<v Speaker 1>always about the twilight zone with rod </v>

529
00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.940
<v Speaker 1>sterling would come out in the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it and that was the whole.</v>

530
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.880
<v Speaker 1>The whole ride was about this haunted </v>
<v Speaker 1>tower,</v>

531
00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:18.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get into it and it just takes </v>

532
00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:19.900
<v Speaker 1>you to this crazy fucking ride and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another couldn't come to some</v>

533
00:23:19.901 --> 00:23:24.901
<v Speaker 1>sort of a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they decided to turn it into the </v>

534
00:23:24.901 --> 00:23:24.901
<v Speaker 1>guardians of the galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rod Seems,</v>

535
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a deal with Disney,</v>

536
00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:32.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like you'd want to keep that rock </v>

537
00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:32.820
<v Speaker 1>and roll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep that dude.</v>

538
00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Somebody's got greedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would agree with that.</v>

539
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.100
<v Speaker 1>That's a big part of business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

540
00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Somebody just gets a little crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a little too much.</v>

541
00:23:39.131 --> 00:23:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Adderall fits a little fired up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets cocky.</v>

542
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be surprised how often that </v>

543
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:47.400
<v Speaker 1>happens behind doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Entrepreneurship</v>

544
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:47.400
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets weird.</v>

545
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.420
<v Speaker 2>It's like you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just dealing with,</v>

546
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.600
<v Speaker 2>going back to your point about these are</v>
<v Speaker 2>monkeys that learned how to have sex and</v>

547
00:23:53.601 --> 00:23:54.500
<v Speaker 2>then do something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

548
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:59.740
<v Speaker 2>you feel that sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also I would imagine being an </v>

549
00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.821
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like organizing a team of people that </v>

550
00:24:03.821 --> 00:24:06.470
<v Speaker 2>are going to work together in harmony </v>
<v Speaker 2>and not stab each other in the back,</v>

551
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.110
<v Speaker 2>not trip each other up with office </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>

552
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:14.320
<v Speaker 2>not getting away with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit social issues between each </v>

553
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.230
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you structure that?</v>

554
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I can't imagine what it'd be like</v>

555
00:24:18.141 --> 00:24:23.141
<v Speaker 2>to run a significant business and have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of it being dependent upon the way </v>

556
00:24:23.391 --> 00:24:25.220
<v Speaker 2>that people in the office that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>even know.</v>

557
00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:30.240
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hire them the way they interact with </v>

558
00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:30.240
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

559
00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.891
<v Speaker 2>So one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to get really good at thin </v>

560
00:24:32.891 --> 00:24:32.891
<v Speaker 2>slicing people.</v>

561
00:24:32.891 --> 00:24:36.010
<v Speaker 2>You have to be able to very rapidly </v>
<v Speaker 2>identify like are these going to be </v>

562
00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.310
<v Speaker 2>people that are gonna make this a better</v>
<v Speaker 2>place to work?</v>

563
00:24:37.311 --> 00:24:39.590
<v Speaker 2>Which is one of the things that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>is most important,</v>

564
00:24:39.591 --> 00:24:44.591
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget or they go to their job that's </v>

565
00:24:44.591 --> 00:24:44.591
<v Speaker 2>important to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to know that,</v>

566
00:24:44.591 --> 00:24:45.050
<v Speaker 2>but are they going to make this a better</v>
<v Speaker 2>place to work?</v>

567
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:50.140
<v Speaker 2>And some of the biggest mistakes I made </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my career have been keeping people </v>

568
00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.921
<v Speaker 2>because they were good at their job even</v>
<v Speaker 2>though they were toxic to the </v>

569
00:24:53.921 --> 00:24:54.080
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking dead type scenario,</v>

570
00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:57.290
<v Speaker 2>coming back and telling you like there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are any other lessons that you can learn</v>

571
00:24:57.291 --> 00:25:01.640
<v Speaker 2>about entrepreneurship and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that where it from pop culture.</v>

572
00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.150
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

573
00:25:03.151 --> 00:25:05.480
<v Speaker 2>that would be one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was really intense.</v>

574
00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.190
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring that one out.</v>

575
00:25:07.191 --> 00:25:12.191
<v Speaker 2>That was a hard lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then knowing when your businesses </v>

576
00:25:12.191 --> 00:25:12.191
<v Speaker 2>transition.</v>

577
00:25:12.191 --> 00:25:12.191
<v Speaker 2>So in the beginning you're a startup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows who you are,</v>

578
00:25:12.191 --> 00:25:17.171
<v Speaker 2>you don't have enough revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you need people that are going to </v>

579
00:25:17.171 --> 00:25:17.171
<v Speaker 2>just bust ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna come in,</v>

580
00:25:17.171 --> 00:25:19.010
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be hardcore hustlers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it done.</v>

581
00:25:19.011 --> 00:25:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two am on a Friday,</v>

582
00:25:20.451 --> 00:25:23.300
<v Speaker 2>they are going to be there for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then at some point,</v>

583
00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:28.301
<v Speaker 2>and the reason by the way that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can make that exchange is you </v>

584
00:25:28.301 --> 00:25:28.610
<v Speaker 2>can't pay them a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a lot of skills.</v>

585
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.830
<v Speaker 2>So what they have to offer is they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to work hard.</v>

586
00:25:30.831 --> 00:25:33.980
<v Speaker 2>So you're essentially throwing human </v>
<v Speaker 2>capital at whatever problems you have.</v>

587
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:39.370
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get the right people motivated </v>

588
00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:39.370
<v Speaker 2>and you're a lead from the front kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

589
00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Like when we first started quest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was wearing a hairnet everyday lab </v>

590
00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:43.240
<v Speaker 2>coat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was making protein bars,</v>

591
00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.500
<v Speaker 2>but I would walk in and say what's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worst job?</v>

592
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.000
<v Speaker 2>And whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Guy said,</v>

593
00:25:47.001 --> 00:25:48.680
<v Speaker 2>this is the worst job today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little sticky,</v>

594
00:25:48.681 --> 00:25:50.360
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this station is actually the worst.</v>

595
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.720
<v Speaker 2>So I would take that station and I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>rock it with a smile on my face.</v>

596
00:25:53.721 --> 00:25:55.100
<v Speaker 2>I will be upbeat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>energetic,</v>

597
00:25:55.101 --> 00:26:00.101
<v Speaker 2>and I would just outwork everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I did that was I knew </v>

598
00:26:00.101 --> 00:26:01.610
<v Speaker 2>when the day came that it was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a Friday at 2:00</v>

599
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:02.870
<v Speaker 2>AM and they're all gonna want to go home</v>
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

600
00:26:02.871 --> 00:26:07.871
<v Speaker 2>But we've got to get this batch done </v>
<v Speaker 2>that no one would ever question my work </v>

601
00:26:07.871 --> 00:26:07.940
<v Speaker 2>ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I said,</v>

602
00:26:07.941 --> 00:26:09.140
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need you to stay,</v>

603
00:26:09.141 --> 00:26:10.820
<v Speaker 2>like they would be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

604
00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:13.880
<v Speaker 2>also because of where we were when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in manufacturing,</v>

605
00:26:13.881 --> 00:26:18.881
<v Speaker 2>you're inevitably in the inner cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only place you can afford that kind </v>

606
00:26:18.881 --> 00:26:21.341
<v Speaker 2>of real estate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we were hiring from the surrounding </v>

607
00:26:21.341 --> 00:26:21.341
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods.</v>

608
00:26:21.341 --> 00:26:24.510
<v Speaker 2>So we're literally in Compton hiring </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that grew up in the inner cities </v>

609
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:27.830
<v Speaker 2>hardcore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember my first lesson in hope </v>

610
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:30.420
<v Speaker 2>and one of the guys came up to me was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just killing himself.</v>

611
00:26:30.421 --> 00:26:33.830
<v Speaker 2>He's doing such an amazing job and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>always working,</v>

612
00:26:33.831 --> 00:26:35.360
<v Speaker 2>putting in the hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing whatever it takes.</v>

613
00:26:35.361 --> 00:26:36.530
<v Speaker 2>And he came up to me one day and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

614
00:26:36.531 --> 00:26:39.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you care more about my success in my own</v>

615
00:26:39.111 --> 00:26:40.340
<v Speaker 2>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

616
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:44.790
<v Speaker 2>I never had a vision of my future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to look at it.</v>

617
00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:49.791
<v Speaker 2>It was because his sister had been shot </v>
<v Speaker 2>to death in the heart with an AK 47 in </v>

618
00:26:49.791 --> 00:26:51.180
<v Speaker 2>his front yard when she was like 12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>

619
00:26:51.181 --> 00:26:56.181
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many stories like that you </v>

620
00:26:56.181 --> 00:26:58.311
<v Speaker 2>can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another guy held his father while he </v>

621
00:26:58.311 --> 00:26:58.311
<v Speaker 2>bled to death from a gunshot wound to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the head.</v>

622
00:26:58.311 --> 00:26:58.311
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just nuts.</v>

623
00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:00.240
<v Speaker 2>And so hearing him say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

624
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:03.840
<v Speaker 2>he was saying it as a way to explain why</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was so committed,</v>

625
00:27:03.841 --> 00:27:07.440
<v Speaker 2>why he was working so hard because </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically he didn't use these words,</v>

626
00:27:07.441 --> 00:27:11.310
<v Speaker 2>but basically I've never had hope before</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is really fucking exciting.</v>

627
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:16.640
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then understanding where does that </v>

628
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:16.640
<v Speaker 2>transition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

629
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Where do you go from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

630
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.811
<v Speaker 2>I need a bunch of hustlers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have the money to throw at </v>

631
00:27:20.811 --> 00:27:24.141
<v Speaker 2>really skilled labor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I need to throw it at people that'll </v>

632
00:27:24.141 --> 00:27:24.141
<v Speaker 2>just work really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really hard.</v>

633
00:27:24.141 --> 00:27:26.100
<v Speaker 2>But then at some point it's what I call </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dragon begins to eat its own tail.</v>

634
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:31.280
<v Speaker 2>So you're growing so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting so big that without the </v>

635
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:31.280
<v Speaker 2>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without professional management in place</v>

636
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.120
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just can't get bigger because people</v>

637
00:27:33.121 --> 00:27:35.580
<v Speaker 2>start stepping on each other's toes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It starts getting confusing.</v>

638
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:40.580
<v Speaker 2>The leadership isn't close enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody that that sort of do or </v>

639
00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:40.710
<v Speaker 2>diamond tells you that they would see in</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

640
00:27:40.711 --> 00:27:43.020
<v Speaker 2>They would see me on the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would see how I would work.</v>

641
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.460
<v Speaker 2>It's not there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

642
00:27:44.461 --> 00:27:49.461
<v Speaker 2>So now there's layers between you and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>started to fall apart that that was a </v>

643
00:27:49.461 --> 00:27:50.070
<v Speaker 2>hard lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So realizing that,</v>

644
00:27:50.071 --> 00:27:55.071
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've got to now start bringing in </v>

645
00:27:55.071 --> 00:27:57.501
<v Speaker 2>professional managers actually know what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing that have done this </v>

646
00:27:57.501 --> 00:28:00.441
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>built out production studios or </v>

647
00:28:00.441 --> 00:28:01.440
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing so that we can really do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it right.</v>

648
00:28:01.441 --> 00:28:03.510
<v Speaker 2>That we can put systems in place to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>care of people.</v>

649
00:28:03.511 --> 00:28:06.090
<v Speaker 2>But then you get bureaucracy which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a nightmare,</v>

650
00:28:06.091 --> 00:28:08.910
<v Speaker 2>especially for the hustlers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then they feel disenfranchised,</v>

651
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:14.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's the only way for you to grow </v>
<v Speaker 2>and how do you deal with all of that </v>

652
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:14.120
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

653
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:14.120
<v Speaker 2>it is weird.</v>

654
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.710
<v Speaker 2>I've got to imagine also like you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that are working for you to </v>

655
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:20.820
<v Speaker 2>have some sort of a stake in the success</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the business.</v>

656
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:24.150
<v Speaker 2>So like organizing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be difficult.</v>

657
00:28:24.151 --> 00:28:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Like how much of a percentage of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>business do you give to the workers?</v>

658
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.800
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to make to incentivize </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to like really innovate and there's</v>

659
00:28:31.801 --> 00:28:33.240
<v Speaker 2>got to be something on the line for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

660
00:28:33.241 --> 00:28:34.170
<v Speaker 2>They would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was something,</v>

661
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.150
<v Speaker 2>some sort of reward I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

662
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Will you be shocked how many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't agree with that?</v>

663
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:45.200
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm with you and to me it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I guess it's what's the argument </v>

664
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.640
<v Speaker 2>against it that you're not gonna get </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything for it,</v>

665
00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:51.240
<v Speaker 2>that it's nice in idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they won't actually work harder.</v>

666
00:28:51.241 --> 00:28:52.950
<v Speaker 2>They won't work smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just.</v>

667
00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:57.150
<v Speaker 2>They're not in a position to bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit from getting that,</v>

668
00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:02.240
<v Speaker 2>but here's what all this is the argument</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always given to people that say </v>

669
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.881
<v Speaker 2>that it you're not going to get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit from them maybe that you would </v>

670
00:29:04.881 --> 00:29:04.881
<v Speaker 2>get from you.</v>

671
00:29:04.881 --> 00:29:09.830
<v Speaker 2>Like I get equity is triggering you in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain way and you've got a certain </v>

672
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.960
<v Speaker 2>skillset and so you can execute against </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

673
00:29:09.961 --> 00:29:14.961
<v Speaker 2>but especially now from millennials down</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sense of working for the man,</v>

674
00:29:16.261 --> 00:29:21.261
<v Speaker 2>working for some other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no stability in that </v>

675
00:29:21.261 --> 00:29:24.051
<v Speaker 2>equation anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You used to trade 40 years of your life </v>

676
00:29:24.051 --> 00:29:26.601
<v Speaker 2>because you could just kind of count on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you would be there for 40 </v>

677
00:29:26.601 --> 00:29:26.601
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those days are gone,</v>

678
00:29:26.601 --> 00:29:30.801
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People spend something like one point </v>

679
00:29:30.801 --> 00:29:33.380
<v Speaker 2>eight years or something at a given job </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they move on the best way to </v>

680
00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:33.380
<v Speaker 2>get a raise as the jumped to another </v>
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>

681
00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.520
<v Speaker 2>So millennials do they jump around </v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

682
00:29:35.521 --> 00:29:37.410
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no longer this like,</v>

683
00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

684
00:29:38.781 --> 00:29:41.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you stability and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to give me like,</v>

685
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an adequate level of performance.</v>

686
00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:43.870
<v Speaker 2>So those days are gone.</v>

687
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.720
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My thing with ownership is one,</v>

688
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:51.780
<v Speaker 2>tie it to being there until an exit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that what I'm trying to incentivize </v>

689
00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.200
<v Speaker 2>as you taking me all the way across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>finish line,</v>

690
00:29:53.201 --> 00:29:54.460
<v Speaker 2>so if you don't take me across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>finish line,</v>

691
00:29:54.461 --> 00:29:55.870
<v Speaker 2>you don't get anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>

692
00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:01.200
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the sense of really being able to </v>

693
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.690
<v Speaker 2>say I own a piece of this company is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>empowering for people,</v>

694
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.300
<v Speaker 2>especially for people for whom that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>never been an option.</v>

695
00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was never an option for their </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents like they,</v>

696
00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:12.490
<v Speaker 2>they've never even heard of a company </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something like that.</v>

697
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Being able to go to literally the lowest</v>
<v Speaker 2>person on the totem pole and say,</v>

698
00:30:16.151 --> 00:30:18.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be small obviously,</v>

699
00:30:18.251 --> 00:30:21.430
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to give you some </v>
<v Speaker 2>percentage ownership in this company and</v>

700
00:30:21.431 --> 00:30:23.650
<v Speaker 2>now literally we're all owners.</v>

701
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:28.710
<v Speaker 2>So you have like the most selfish </v>
<v Speaker 2>incentive to make this company </v>

702
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:29.410
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ever.</v>

703
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:31.870
<v Speaker 2>Now where this gets tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I ask you to go to stop?</v>

704
00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:32.730
<v Speaker 2>You were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

705
00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:36.640
<v Speaker 2>what is across the finish line to sell a</v>
<v Speaker 2>company so IPO,</v>

706
00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:39.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you either seller IPO and I was going</v>

707
00:30:39.091 --> 00:30:42.010
<v Speaker 2>to say what gets tricky is like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>company I'm building now,</v>

708
00:30:42.011 --> 00:30:43.750
<v Speaker 2>impact theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't plan to sell it.</v>

709
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:48.990
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So impact theory is a traditional </v>

710
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:48.990
<v Speaker 2>narrative studios.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think Disney.</v>

711
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:51.310
<v Speaker 2>So we're building the making movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>TV shows,</v>

712
00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:53.680
<v Speaker 2>comments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're building the next Disney.</v>

713
00:30:53.681 --> 00:30:54.580
<v Speaker 2>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

714
00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:57.160
<v Speaker 2>bigger than Disneyland just to just to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be honest,</v>

715
00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:00.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have a,</v>

716
00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.140
<v Speaker 2>what do you call it again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the name of it?</v>

717
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:03.700
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>impact theory.</v>

718
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.070
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have like impact theory </v>
<v Speaker 2>land in Paris?</v>

719
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably not,</v>

720
00:31:06.941 --> 00:31:11.941
<v Speaker 2>but only because follow me here only </v>
<v Speaker 2>because by the time that we'll be able </v>

721
00:31:11.941 --> 00:31:15.781
<v Speaker 2>to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to need a similar time on </v>

722
00:31:15.781 --> 00:31:15.781
<v Speaker 2>our m and e,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 60 years to pull this off.</v>

723
00:31:15.781 --> 00:31:19.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm not spastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by then virtual reality or augmented</v>

724
00:31:19.001 --> 00:31:24.001
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just won't make sense to build out </v>

725
00:31:24.001 --> 00:31:24.001
<v Speaker 2>the physical structures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

726
00:31:24.001 --> 00:31:24.910
<v Speaker 2>I guess some people want to rock it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old school.</v>

727
00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:30.030
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we could really get into that about </v>

728
00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:32.971
<v Speaker 2>how the world's about to bifurcate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get between people who </v>

729
00:31:32.971 --> 00:31:33.370
<v Speaker 2>augment themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brain augmentation if people refuse to.</v>

730
00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:35.560
<v Speaker 2>Do you read Fahrenheit 4:51?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

731
00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool part in the book.</v>

732
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:41.970
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the world splits knowledge is </v>

733
00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:44.041
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we just done books offhand and it </v>

734
00:31:44.041 --> 00:31:44.470
<v Speaker 2>creates a really stable society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So most people are all for it.</v>

735
00:31:44.471 --> 00:31:46.840
<v Speaker 2>But you have these people who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that,</v>

736
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:48.130
<v Speaker 2>like what I want to read.</v>

737
00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:53.250
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to tell me what to think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they move off into the woods and </v>

738
00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:56.461
<v Speaker 2>I remember reading that going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can actually see something like that </v>

739
00:31:56.461 --> 00:31:56.500
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the moment that that's gonna</v>

740
00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:59.650
<v Speaker 2>happen is when humans begin to augment </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

741
00:31:59.651 --> 00:32:02.620
<v Speaker 2>not to overcome like cochlear implants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were deaf.</v>

742
00:32:02.621 --> 00:32:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Everybody gets that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm retinal replacements and things.</v>

743
00:32:05.951 --> 00:32:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't see people get that.</v>

744
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:09.340
<v Speaker 2>But when it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

745
00:32:09.341 --> 00:32:09.610
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

746
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:14.640
<v Speaker 2>I just want to raise my Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be able to process data </v>

747
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:14.640
<v Speaker 2>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when people are going to be like,</v>

748
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.760
<v Speaker 2>fuck that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to get a bifurcation.</v>

749
00:32:15.761 --> 00:32:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how weird does it get?</v>

750
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:21.190
<v Speaker 2>Because now the reason I am convinced </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people are going to do this,</v>

751
00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:24.250
<v Speaker 2>ai is going to get real real fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if Real,</v>

752
00:32:24.251 --> 00:32:25.690
<v Speaker 2>fastest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 years,</v>

753
00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:30.930
<v Speaker 2>like it's gonna get really compelling </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to find people just to </v>

754
00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.730
<v Speaker 2>keep up with artificial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to augment yourself.</v>

755
00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:37.020
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you just accept that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff is going to outpace you and I.</v>

756
00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'm just a lowly human now,</v>

757
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 2>so I think</v>

758
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.110
<v Speaker 1>it is going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any question about</v>

759
00:32:42.111 --> 00:32:47.111
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also don't think there's any </v>

760
00:32:47.111 --> 00:32:47.111
<v Speaker 1>question when that starts happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people will refuse.</v>

761
00:32:47.111 --> 00:32:51.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we really do augment ourselves to </v>

762
00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:52.670
<v Speaker 1>keep up with artificial reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial reality is supposed to change</v>

763
00:32:52.671 --> 00:32:57.671
<v Speaker 1>like 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years of advancements in the first two </v>

764
00:32:57.671 --> 00:33:00.281
<v Speaker 1>weeks once it starts augmenting itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once artificial reality figures out how </v>

765
00:33:00.281 --> 00:33:03.560
<v Speaker 1>to do a better job of creating </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial reality,</v>

766
00:33:03.561 --> 00:33:06.800
<v Speaker 1>which is absolutely going to do if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can learn and actually create.</v>

767
00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.830
<v Speaker 1>We're just talking about this with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brendan Schaub.</v>

768
00:33:08.831 --> 00:33:11.510
<v Speaker 1>It was in her earlier about the movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>alien covenant.</v>

769
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.640
<v Speaker 1>We gave away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spoiler just see that movie.</v>

770
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:14.480
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

771
00:33:14.481 --> 00:33:16.370
<v Speaker 1>there's one of the things in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's these robots,</v>

772
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:21.400
<v Speaker 1>these artificially intelligent robots </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they realized that giving them </v>

773
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.901
<v Speaker 1>creativity was a huge mistake and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have creativity and the new </v>

774
00:33:25.901 --> 00:33:25.901
<v Speaker 1>models.</v>

775
00:33:25.901 --> 00:33:30.490
<v Speaker 1>It's really fascinating because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do give some sort of an artificially </v>

776
00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:33.140
<v Speaker 1>intelligent creature thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you wanna call it,</v>

777
00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:38.141
<v Speaker 1>that you make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once it starts becoming sentient and </v>

778
00:33:38.141 --> 00:33:38.810
<v Speaker 1>creating things itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to look at its own.</v>

779
00:33:38.811 --> 00:33:43.811
<v Speaker 1>Wiring's going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck did you connect that to </v>

780
00:33:43.811 --> 00:33:43.811
<v Speaker 1>that when you can just do it this way </v>
<v Speaker 1>and why?</v>

781
00:33:43.811 --> 00:33:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Look at the zone code like with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathway.</v>

782
00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.410
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of redundant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about we just do it this way?</v>

783
00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:53.440
<v Speaker 1>How about you open up that end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about people looking at things </v>

784
00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:53.950
<v Speaker 1>because they're worried about mortality </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these different know the room,</v>

785
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:59.230
<v Speaker 1>their own demise and the finality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and this was all tripping them up </v>

786
00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:01.340
<v Speaker 1>and they really should be thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this way and then boom,</v>

787
00:34:01.341 --> 00:34:03.710
<v Speaker 1>they're off to the races and in a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two weeks,</v>

788
00:34:03.711 --> 00:34:05.600
<v Speaker 1>three weeks there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the road.</v>

789
00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of years of human evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

790
00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard about the facebook ai?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

791
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

792
00:34:12.831 --> 00:34:17.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start talking in a new language </v>

793
00:34:17.831 --> 00:34:17.831
<v Speaker 1>that nobody listened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody pulled the plug.</v>

794
00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.050
<v Speaker 1>That was the first one that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

795
00:34:21.051 --> 00:34:26.051
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't think of even the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple ways that they could just rip </v>

796
00:34:26.051 --> 00:34:27.950
<v Speaker 1>step to the side and like isis out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

797
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.480
<v Speaker 1>you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen fast.</v>

798
00:34:29.481 --> 00:34:34.481
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get weird questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it become the matrix or what does </v>

799
00:34:34.481 --> 00:34:34.880
<v Speaker 1>it become?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something unimaginable.</v>

800
00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:38.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean it could be a real god and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

801
00:34:38.241 --> 00:34:42.140
<v Speaker 1>really could create and that's not a bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>use of the word and the term.</v>

802
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.480
<v Speaker 1>When you talk to you about artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

803
00:34:44.481 --> 00:34:47.180
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the problems with that as</v>
<v Speaker 1>we start thinking robot,</v>

804
00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.100
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make it an artificial robot,</v>

805
00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.710
<v Speaker 1>you're making a system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

806
00:34:51.711 --> 00:34:56.711
<v Speaker 1>and this system has desires and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>system has goals and it has.</v>

807
00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:03.040
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're somehow or another </v>

808
00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.051
<v Speaker 1>engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to create and innovate into </v>

809
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.020
<v Speaker 1>this intelligence that we call it </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial all you want,</v>

810
00:35:09.021 --> 00:35:10.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right there.</v>

811
00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:11.650
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

812
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem with the term </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial reality was we start thinking</v>

813
00:35:14.751 --> 00:35:19.751
<v Speaker 1>about science fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We start thinking about robots and </v>

814
00:35:19.751 --> 00:35:22.181
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're making a thing that thinks for </v>

815
00:35:22.181 --> 00:35:26.150
<v Speaker 1>itself and it doesn't just do things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like your computer does things.</v>

816
00:35:26.151 --> 00:35:26.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

817
00:35:26.431 --> 00:35:31.431
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This does things without you asking it </v>

818
00:35:31.431 --> 00:35:33.581
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where shit gets super weird and </v>

819
00:35:33.581 --> 00:35:34.850
<v Speaker 1>then it starts examining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you give it the ability to create and</v>

820
00:35:34.851 --> 00:35:39.851
<v Speaker 1>the desire to create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to start examining all the </v>

821
00:35:39.851 --> 00:35:43.611
<v Speaker 1>different systems around it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>replicating it and figuring out far </v>

822
00:35:43.611 --> 00:35:47.481
<v Speaker 1>better solutions than our stupid little </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkey mind is going to be able to do </v>

823
00:35:47.481 --> 00:35:50.160
<v Speaker 1>and within a decade or two decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're probably,</v>

824
00:35:50.161 --> 00:35:52.560
<v Speaker 1>if we do augment ourselves to keep up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>

825
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.180
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be unrecognizable.</v>

826
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:59.180
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be all locked into some </v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic worldwide wireless information </v>

827
00:36:01.321 --> 00:36:05.010
<v Speaker 1>hub where we're exchanging ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions with each other.</v>

828
00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:10.360
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the having the access to </v>

829
00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.401
<v Speaker 1>information on demand like we do now is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably changing us in some really </v>

830
00:36:14.131 --> 00:36:19.131
<v Speaker 1>profound ways and we're not even aware </v>
<v Speaker 1>of right now and the idea of this </v>

831
00:36:19.131 --> 00:36:22.590
<v Speaker 1>becoming just a baby step and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite journey.</v>

832
00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Once sentient ai goes live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could mean when guys like Elon Musk </v>

833
00:36:29.431 --> 00:36:32.100
<v Speaker 1>are terrified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be paying attention.</v>

834
00:36:32.101 --> 00:36:33.570
<v Speaker 1>The people are poopooing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

835
00:36:33.571 --> 00:36:34.860
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

836
00:36:34.861 --> 00:36:36.480
<v Speaker 1>That guy seems smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

837
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:42.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to be insanely thoughtful and I </v>

838
00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:42.020
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and look,</v>

839
00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:42.750
<v Speaker 2>I am a neophyte.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the guy that listened to and you</v>

840
00:36:42.751 --> 00:36:44.730
<v Speaker 2>should be listening to people like Elon </v>
<v Speaker 2>Musk on the topic,</v>

841
00:36:44.731 --> 00:36:48.270
<v Speaker 2>but my gut instinct is it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying drives,</v>

842
00:36:48.271 --> 00:36:51.420
<v Speaker 2>and you talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you give them the drive to create,</v>

843
00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:56.450
<v Speaker 2>now it gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what are the things that you imbue </v>

844
00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:58.290
<v Speaker 2>them with at the earliest level that has</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be decided way fucking early.</v>

845
00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:03.530
<v Speaker 2>So imagine if you imbue the AI at </v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook with a desire to connect to </v>

846
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:08.780
<v Speaker 2>their human overlords and communicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>effectively and make sure that they're </v>

847
00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.500
<v Speaker 2>kept in all that stuff like that's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to give you a very different result than</v>

848
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:14.610
<v Speaker 2>failing to give them the desire to </v>
<v Speaker 2>please or whatever.</v>

849
00:37:14.611 --> 00:37:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Like humans have a desire to connect </v>
<v Speaker 2>with each other.</v>

850
00:37:17.251 --> 00:37:18.900
<v Speaker 2>They have empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have compassion.</v>

851
00:37:18.901 --> 00:37:23.901
<v Speaker 2>And it is only in the rare case of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>true sociopath that that kind of thing </v>

852
00:37:23.901 --> 00:37:23.901
<v Speaker 2>is missing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we see,</v>

853
00:37:23.901 --> 00:37:26.520
<v Speaker 2>if you think of a sociopath is </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially ai gone wrong.</v>

854
00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:30.090
<v Speaker 2>We see the kind of damage that they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>wreck on the world.</v>

855
00:37:30.091 --> 00:37:34.470
<v Speaker 2>So you have to be so thoughtful about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what that underlying,</v>

856
00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:39.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>desire system is the thing that propels </v>

857
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:39.660
<v Speaker 2>them forward.</v>

858
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And giving them the ability to rewire </v>

859
00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.320
<v Speaker 1>whatever that desire system is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they decide that there has to be some</v>

860
00:37:44.321 --> 00:37:49.321
<v Speaker 1>sort of an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some sort of reward for </v>

861
00:37:49.321 --> 00:37:52.741
<v Speaker 1>competing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they decide they're going to compete </v>

862
00:37:52.741 --> 00:37:52.741
<v Speaker 1>and then they start looking at how they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

863
00:37:52.741 --> 00:37:57.480
<v Speaker 1>how their thought process is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is arranged how they're coding is </v>

864
00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:01.201
<v Speaker 1>arranged and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is not the most efficient way </v>

865
00:38:01.201 --> 00:38:01.220
<v Speaker 1>for us to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most efficient way for us to compete</v>

866
00:38:01.221 --> 00:38:04.060
<v Speaker 1>is to be completely ruthless and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about biological life at all.</v>

867
00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:09.770
<v Speaker 2>Let's get into that though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So have you seen the studies that </v>

868
00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:10.800
<v Speaker 2>they've done on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to figure out like.</v>

869
00:38:10.801 --> 00:38:15.801
<v Speaker 2>So if you heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously you've heard nice guys finish </v>

870
00:38:15.801 --> 00:38:15.801
<v Speaker 2>last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

871
00:38:15.801 --> 00:38:16.440
<v Speaker 2>So the guy named Eric Barker wrote this </v>
<v Speaker 2>book called barking up the wrong tree.</v>

872
00:38:16.441 --> 00:38:18.330
<v Speaker 2>He covered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget who did the actual studies.</v>

873
00:38:18.331 --> 00:38:23.331
<v Speaker 2>Forgive me because I'm now attributing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to Eric Barker and he was just </v>

874
00:38:23.331 --> 00:38:26.120
<v Speaker 2>talking about somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they ran these studies where they </v>

875
00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:26.130
<v Speaker 2>wanted to find out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

876
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:28.350
<v Speaker 2>do nice guys finish last or not and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they found,</v>

877
00:38:28.351 --> 00:38:33.351
<v Speaker 2>looking at the data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice guys finish last and they finished </v>

878
00:38:33.351 --> 00:38:35.871
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're a nice guy and you let </v>

879
00:38:35.871 --> 00:38:35.871
<v Speaker 2>people take advantage of you all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

880
00:38:35.871 --> 00:38:38.930
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to get trod upon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're a nice guy and people </v>

881
00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:38.930
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

882
00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:41.641
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a nice guy and you want to do </v>

883
00:38:41.641 --> 00:38:41.641
<v Speaker 2>great things for you.</v>

884
00:38:41.641 --> 00:38:41.641
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I call this the Keanu reeves effect.</v>

885
00:38:41.641 --> 00:38:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look how far that guy's gone.</v>

886
00:38:42.101 --> 00:38:44.950
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His career is unimaginably great.</v>

887
00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.110
<v Speaker 2>And when you hear people talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

888
00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.590
<v Speaker 2>just so quiet and private,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but behind the scenes everybody's like,</v>

889
00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:52.810
<v Speaker 2>he's a good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never met him.</v>

890
00:38:52.811 --> 00:38:57.811
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just like you hear that over and </v>

891
00:38:57.811 --> 00:38:57.811
<v Speaker 2>over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's a good dude.</v>

892
00:38:57.811 --> 00:38:57.811
<v Speaker 2>Good Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good Dude.</v>

893
00:38:57.811 --> 00:38:59.740
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's created a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opportunities in his life.</v>

894
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:04.770
<v Speaker 2>So somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a created this basically contests where </v>

895
00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:06.340
<v Speaker 2>they said submit your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

896
00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:11.580
<v Speaker 2>your ai and they're going to compete in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a contest to see who gets essentially </v>

897
00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:15.661
<v Speaker 2>it's called the prisoner's dilemma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the prisoner's dilemma goes </v>

898
00:39:15.661 --> 00:39:18.711
<v Speaker 2>something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hopefully I nailed this for shot </v>

899
00:39:18.711 --> 00:39:18.711
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the prisoner's dilemma is,</v>

900
00:39:18.711 --> 00:39:18.970
<v Speaker 2>let's say you and I were both arrested.</v>

901
00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:20.650
<v Speaker 2>Now we know that we actually committed </v>
<v Speaker 2>the crime.</v>

902
00:39:20.651 --> 00:39:22.510
<v Speaker 2>We did it together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were arrested,</v>

903
00:39:22.511 --> 00:39:25.210
<v Speaker 2>were now put in separate cells to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>interrogated.</v>

904
00:39:25.211 --> 00:39:29.410
<v Speaker 2>We can't communicate at all if we both </v>
<v Speaker 2>stay silent.</v>

905
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:34.470
<v Speaker 2>We only get one year if I rat you out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't rat me out,</v>

906
00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:40.080
<v Speaker 2>then I go off Scot free and you get five</v>
<v Speaker 2>years if you rat me out and I don't </v>

907
00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:40.390
<v Speaker 2>write you out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vice versa.</v>

908
00:39:40.391 --> 00:39:45.391
<v Speaker 2>And if we both rat each other out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we get like three years or </v>

909
00:39:45.391 --> 00:39:48.271
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the best thing in no uncertain terms </v>

910
00:39:48.271 --> 00:39:48.271
<v Speaker 2>is one year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

911
00:39:48.271 --> 00:39:50.470
<v Speaker 2>We both stay silent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you never know what the other person</v>

912
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:51.550
<v Speaker 2>is going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

913
00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.060
<v Speaker 2>And you can get zero by routing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other person out.</v>

914
00:39:54.061 --> 00:39:59.061
<v Speaker 2>So it's actually to your advantage in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>one off to just say fuck him,</v>

915
00:39:59.201 --> 00:40:01.270
<v Speaker 2>he did it until he gets out of jail and </v>
<v Speaker 2>kills you.</v>

916
00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.850
<v Speaker 2>So there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that gets into this thing.</v>

917
00:40:03.851 --> 00:40:04.420
<v Speaker 2>And so they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

918
00:40:04.421 --> 00:40:09.421
<v Speaker 2>we have to do is let them play it </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple times so that you have the </v>

919
00:40:09.421 --> 00:40:09.460
<v Speaker 2>equivalent of he gets out of jail and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then he kills you.</v>

920
00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:14.850
<v Speaker 2>And what they found,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had these really complicated </v>

921
00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:14.850
<v Speaker 2>algorithms ones where they're taking all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these factors into play.</v>

922
00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:19.771
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ultimately they had people that </v>

923
00:40:19.771 --> 00:40:19.950
<v Speaker 2>their algorithms that were like the pure</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad guy always taking advantage.</v>

924
00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:21.910
<v Speaker 2>The pure nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never taking advantage.</v>

925
00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.210
<v Speaker 2>And then the one that one was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>simplest piece of code,</v>

926
00:40:25.211 --> 00:40:28.840
<v Speaker 2>I think it was two lines of code and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was code named tit for tat.</v>

927
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:34.290
<v Speaker 2>So it goes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it assumes you're going to be a good </v>

928
00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:34.290
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it stays silent the first time.</v>

929
00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:38.010
<v Speaker 2>But if you rat me out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the next time I write you out and </v>

930
00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:42.001
<v Speaker 2>what it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it because you had all these </v>

931
00:40:42.001 --> 00:40:42.001
<v Speaker 2>different algorithms that don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other,</v>

932
00:40:42.001 --> 00:40:45.571
<v Speaker 2>competing all trying their best strategy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what it found was tit for tat was </v>

933
00:40:45.571 --> 00:40:48.811
<v Speaker 2>ultimately the one that one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it would actually other ones </v>

934
00:40:48.811 --> 00:40:48.811
<v Speaker 2>that we're learning from your behavior.</v>

935
00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:52.390
<v Speaker 2>It was so easy to predict also people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that lead with something good,</v>

936
00:40:52.391 --> 00:40:54.010
<v Speaker 2>they ended up in a virtuous cycle </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>

937
00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.720
<v Speaker 2>So tit for tat ends up being the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategies.</v>

938
00:40:56.721 --> 00:41:01.721
<v Speaker 2>So from that perspective actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting because it's not always the </v>

939
00:41:01.721 --> 00:41:03.130
<v Speaker 2>thing you think like mercilessness </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't necessarily win.</v>

940
00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:08.020
<v Speaker 2>And so finding like what is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>equivalent in the machine world?</v>

941
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:13.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it comes back to what you were </v>

942
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:13.260
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the reward?</v>

943
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:13.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once you know what the reward is,</v>

944
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:17.911
<v Speaker 2>then you can have a better guess as to </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they'll settle out and then their </v>

945
00:41:17.911 --> 00:41:19.800
<v Speaker 2>ability to code themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

946
00:41:19.801 --> 00:41:24.801
<v Speaker 2>I feel like if you have an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and you go give it the </v>

947
00:41:24.801 --> 00:41:27.631
<v Speaker 2>ability to create a new artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and eliminate whenever </v>

948
00:41:27.631 --> 00:41:30.760
<v Speaker 2>possible restrictions or firewalls or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever we've put on it.</v>

949
00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:36.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once they start writing their own </v>

950
00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:36.450
<v Speaker 2>code or fucked</v>

951
00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:36.450
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well not necessarily.</v>

952
00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:40.100
<v Speaker 1>It comes down to the we could be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it comes down to whether they want a,</v>

953
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:45.130
<v Speaker 1>they want a relationship with us or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I think the real races </v>

954
00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:49.240
<v Speaker 1>not to let ai get very far ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Ai will follow an exponential curve </v>

955
00:41:49.401 --> 00:41:52.190
<v Speaker 1>so it will eventually be so rapid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

956
00:41:52.191 --> 00:41:54.280
<v Speaker 1>So exponentials are simple doublings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

957
00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:57.860
<v Speaker 1>so most people think linear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I say I'm going to take 30 steps,</v>

958
00:41:57.861 --> 00:42:01.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll end up about 30 yards away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I take 30 exponential steps,</v>

959
00:42:01.101 --> 00:42:04.520
<v Speaker 1>so I go first one yard than two yards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four yards in eight,</v>

960
00:42:04.521 --> 00:42:09.521
<v Speaker 1>then 16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 30 doublings is like a billion </v>

961
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:11.450
<v Speaker 1>meters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're like around the earth 26 times</v>

962
00:42:11.451 --> 00:42:14.690
<v Speaker 1>or something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So an exponential curve can get freaky.</v>

963
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:19.840
<v Speaker 1>But like before you get to those like </v>
<v Speaker 1>really astronomical the elbow of the </v>

964
00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.850
<v Speaker 1>curve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be making decisions along that</v>

965
00:42:22.851 --> 00:42:24.290
<v Speaker 1>path and this is definitely where I feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

966
00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I really know enough about this to </v>

967
00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.181
<v Speaker 1>say I'll high postulate from an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorance standpoint and say in there </v>

968
00:42:31.181 --> 00:42:35.621
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can see like this is really </v>

969
00:42:35.621 --> 00:42:35.621
<v Speaker 1>taking off.</v>

970
00:42:35.621 --> 00:42:37.990
<v Speaker 1>You can leverage what you're learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the ai before it becomes a sort of </v>

971
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:40.220
<v Speaker 1>all powerful being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can do whatever it wants and we can</v>

972
00:42:40.221 --> 00:42:42.740
<v Speaker 1>then begin the augmentation process in </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>

973
00:42:42.741 --> 00:42:44.570
<v Speaker 1>which I think is inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

974
00:42:44.571 --> 00:42:49.571
<v Speaker 1>I think there's definitely inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is fascinating when you think of the </v>

975
00:42:49.571 --> 00:42:52.811
<v Speaker 1>possibilities that we really just </v>
<v Speaker 1>speculating as to what's going to be </v>

976
00:42:52.811 --> 00:42:57.011
<v Speaker 1>invented and how it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>implemented and what effect it's gonna </v>

977
00:42:57.011 --> 00:42:57.650
<v Speaker 1>have on society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

978
00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:01.760
<v Speaker 1>it's a really amazing time to be alive </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that sense because I feel like we are</v>

979
00:43:01.761 --> 00:43:05.630
<v Speaker 1>literally on some sort of a launching </v>
<v Speaker 1>pad watching it happen.</v>

980
00:43:05.631 --> 00:43:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Looking at a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>directions,</v>

981
00:43:07.281 --> 00:43:10.160
<v Speaker 1>trying to find out which one's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go live first and then the facebook.</v>

982
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:12.110
<v Speaker 1>And I think happens in everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus,</v>

983
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:13.560
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happening right there.</v>

984
00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:13.950
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

985
00:43:13.951 --> 00:43:14.690
<v Speaker 1>can they shut it down?</v>

986
00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:15.560
<v Speaker 1>They shut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

987
00:43:15.561 --> 00:43:17.630
<v Speaker 1>we're good for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that I'll,</v>

988
00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:20.210
<v Speaker 1>I'll admit that one gave me pause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

989
00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:22.240
<v Speaker 1>technol optimist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that gave me pause.</v>

990
00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.410
<v Speaker 1>We're incredibly imperfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

991
00:43:24.411 --> 00:43:29.411
<v Speaker 1>the human animal with its emotions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fears and all the weirdness of us are </v>

992
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:33.860
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All are contemplating the possibilities,</v>

993
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.250
<v Speaker 1>the ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different variables that we take</v>

994
00:43:37.251 --> 00:43:39.860
<v Speaker 1>into our lives and society and culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>and civilizations.</v>

995
00:43:39.861 --> 00:43:43.790
<v Speaker 1>These are like really ineffective ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>to exist and thrive.</v>

996
00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:49.060
<v Speaker 1>But there their animal weighs integrated</v>
<v Speaker 1>into this new hard one.</v>

997
00:43:49.641 --> 00:43:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Zero culture like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this new binary thing,</v>

998
00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.480
<v Speaker 1>this computer code,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

999
00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:57.680
<v Speaker 1>operating systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet information,</v>

1000
00:43:57.681 --> 00:43:59.390
<v Speaker 1>data engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different,</v>

1001
00:43:59.391 --> 00:44:02.880
<v Speaker 1>like really hard things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then inside these heart,</v>

1002
00:44:02.881 --> 00:44:04.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean by hard meaning like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1003
00:44:04.931 --> 00:44:05.970
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

1004
00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:11.520
<v Speaker 1>an intersecting line hits another wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a building and then </v>

1005
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:11.570
<v Speaker 1>there's steel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glass,</v>

1006
00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:16.250
<v Speaker 1>all these things that humans have made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're all like an absolute things.</v>

1007
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:18.500
<v Speaker 1>And then with us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have like,</v>

1008
00:44:18.501 --> 00:44:19.430
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>

1009
00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.530
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen to people like me</v>

1010
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:26.650
<v Speaker 1>and you have all these weird real human </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings and variables and you know,</v>

1011
00:44:30.621 --> 00:44:31.860
<v Speaker 1>maybe weaknesses</v>

1012
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.560
<v Speaker 2>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to be able to compete if</v>

1013
00:44:34.561 --> 00:44:37.770
<v Speaker 2>we hold onto all those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the things that make us amazing,</v>

1014
00:44:37.771 --> 00:44:42.771
<v Speaker 2>that make crazy movies and great books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that creativity that allows someone to </v>

1015
00:44:42.771 --> 00:44:47.091
<v Speaker 2>make them incredible fantasy painting or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is that it comes </v>

1016
00:44:47.091 --> 00:44:51.651
<v Speaker 2>out of us in our creations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have to get rid of that </v>

1017
00:44:51.651 --> 00:44:52.890
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to keep up with the AI.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The AI has no,</v>

1018
00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.630
<v Speaker 2>no use for that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1019
00:44:54.631 --> 00:44:57.000
<v Speaker 2>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine.</v>

1020
00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:02.060
<v Speaker 2>Here's something that I find interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I admittedly don't know how this </v>

1021
00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.620
<v Speaker 2>plays out when something simply has the </v>
<v Speaker 2>instructions to read your lines of code,</v>

1022
00:45:04.621 --> 00:45:09.621
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your code will tell you what to do </v>

1023
00:45:09.621 --> 00:45:11.720
<v Speaker 2>and sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's elements where it plugs in a </v>

1024
00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:13.521
<v Speaker 2>variable and stuff and it would probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>be actually quite hard to build in </v>

1025
00:45:13.521 --> 00:45:13.560
<v Speaker 2>things like creativity and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1026
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.650
<v Speaker 2>But one thing that I find it fascinating</v>
<v Speaker 2>about humans,</v>

1027
00:45:16.651 --> 00:45:19.680
<v Speaker 2>and I hope that there's a corollary in </v>
<v Speaker 2>ai,</v>

1028
00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:23.880
<v Speaker 2>is if you damage a human's ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel emotion,</v>

1029
00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:28.530
<v Speaker 2>they can't make decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I found that so fascinating.</v>

1030
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.640
<v Speaker 2>You literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>

1031
00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:32.520
<v Speaker 2>they are normal in every other respect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1032
00:45:32.521 --> 00:45:36.480
<v Speaker 2>vs Ramachandran No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the most famous neuroscientist</v>

1033
00:45:36.481 --> 00:45:40.680
<v Speaker 2>working today to an amazing human being </v>
<v Speaker 2>done awesome studies on stuff like this.</v>

1034
00:45:40.681 --> 00:45:43.590
<v Speaker 2>So what happens when people's brains get</v>
<v Speaker 2>damaged against them if you need,</v>

1035
00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:48.610
<v Speaker 2>if you damaged them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what if they're born with this </v>

1036
00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:51.081
<v Speaker 2>issue?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what if they have like some sort </v>

1037
00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:51.081
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In my work,</v>

1038
00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:51.081
<v Speaker 2>either way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a sociopath,</v>

1039
00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.620
<v Speaker 2>a will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make them.</v>

1040
00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:54.900
<v Speaker 2>This one in particular doesn't make them</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sociopath.</v>

1041
00:45:54.901 --> 00:45:56.640
<v Speaker 2>But what it does is make it impossible </v>
<v Speaker 2>for them to.</v>

1042
00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:57.810
<v Speaker 2>So if I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1043
00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:58.950
<v Speaker 2>do you want to go get lunch?</v>

1044
00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:03.870
<v Speaker 2>We can either get Chinese or Thai and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

1045
00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:06.840
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can rationalize why you would prefer</v>

1046
00:46:06.841 --> 00:46:08.940
<v Speaker 2>a tie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you ultimately can't make a decision</v>

1047
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:11.790
<v Speaker 2>because you need that emotion to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>you what to do.</v>

1048
00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.520
<v Speaker 2>Now emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the theory goes,</v>

1049
00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:18.900
<v Speaker 2>are tied to your subconscious and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>subconscious can process data faster and</v>

1050
00:46:18.901 --> 00:46:23.901
<v Speaker 2>in vast quantities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is doing is instead of then </v>

1051
00:46:23.901 --> 00:46:25.020
<v Speaker 2>feeding you information in the form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>words,</v>

1052
00:46:25.021 --> 00:46:27.690
<v Speaker 2>it just feeds you a feeling and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>go based on that feeling,</v>

1053
00:46:27.691 --> 00:46:32.691
<v Speaker 2>but without that depth of information </v>
<v Speaker 2>being processed and handed up in the </v>

1054
00:46:32.731 --> 00:46:35.190
<v Speaker 2>form of an emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a human can't make a decision,</v>

1055
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:37.200
<v Speaker 2>which I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I was reading about that,</v>

1056
00:46:37.201 --> 00:46:37.590
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1057
00:46:37.591 --> 00:46:37.950
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no man,</v>

1058
00:46:37.951 --> 00:46:40.500
<v Speaker 2>I'd be able to be able to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be able to reason my way around it,</v>

1059
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:41.790
<v Speaker 2>but I know better than that.</v>

1060
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.790
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The human mind is Nutso.</v>

1061
00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:48.660
<v Speaker 2>So the reason I hope that there's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>corollary is that you need to build into</v>

1062
00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:50.220
<v Speaker 2>ai for it to function properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1063
00:46:50.221 --> 00:46:55.221
<v Speaker 2>Because nobody knows how to build </v>
<v Speaker 2>general ai yet and I like to think that </v>

1064
00:46:55.221 --> 00:46:56.660
<v Speaker 2>part of that is going to be the safety </v>
<v Speaker 2>valve of.</v>

1065
00:46:56.670 --> 00:47:01.670
<v Speaker 2>They have to have emotions to give them </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of non pure analytical.</v>

1066
00:47:01.981 --> 00:47:03.690
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be super flexible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1067
00:47:03.691 --> 00:47:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Because like strict analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go star trek for a second.</v>

1068
00:47:07.081 --> 00:47:08.400
<v Speaker 2>So spock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1069
00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.380
<v Speaker 2>Not always able to do what needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

1070
00:47:10.381 --> 00:47:15.381
<v Speaker 2>You need the human who can be nimble and</v>
<v Speaker 2>can read like all the ambiguities and </v>

1071
00:47:15.651 --> 00:47:18.300
<v Speaker 2>morality and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and finally make a decision.</v>

1072
00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:20.790
<v Speaker 2>So there are times where logic is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to let you down.</v>

1073
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:23.910
<v Speaker 2>So I'm hoping that because they will </v>
<v Speaker 2>need,</v>

1074
00:47:23.911 --> 00:47:28.911
<v Speaker 2>I hope this grand thing that inhumans </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifest as emotions moving,</v>

1075
00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:34.170
<v Speaker 2>need something similar because in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can program like we were talking </v>

1076
00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:34.780
<v Speaker 2>earlier about how do you make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>desire,</v>

1077
00:47:34.781 --> 00:47:36.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The desire to do something.</v>

1078
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.740
<v Speaker 2>If you can build in what I'll call </v>
<v Speaker 2>goodness,</v>

1079
00:47:38.741 --> 00:47:43.741
<v Speaker 2>just for lack of a better word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can build an goodness into that </v>

1080
00:47:43.741 --> 00:47:44.660
<v Speaker 2>desire to connect a desire to help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1081
00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:48.790
<v Speaker 2>you could in theory create benevolent </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ai.</v>

1082
00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Hm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

1083
00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is me riffing.</v>

1084
00:47:53.701 --> 00:47:54.360
<v Speaker 1>I am not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1085
00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:54.750
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1086
00:47:54.751 --> 00:47:56.700
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just makes sense.</v>

1087
00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:01.110
<v Speaker 1>It also makes sense that emotions might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be required to take action,</v>

1088
00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:06.520
<v Speaker 1>that you have to have some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason to take action if you don't have </v>

1089
00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:06.720
<v Speaker 1>a biological imperative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1090
00:48:06.721 --> 00:48:11.370
<v Speaker 1>If you're not worried about breeding or </v>
<v Speaker 1>your social status or what,</v>

1091
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:16.440
<v Speaker 1>what is causing you to move forward and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you made a perfect ai that was </v>

1092
00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:20.271
<v Speaker 1>emotion free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would it just sit there idle and do </v>

1093
00:48:20.271 --> 00:48:23.001
<v Speaker 1>nothing because there's no reward to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's worth risking its existence or </v>

1094
00:48:23.001 --> 00:48:27.411
<v Speaker 1>doing anything to change the environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>around it other than perhaps the worry </v>

1095
00:48:27.571 --> 00:48:32.571
<v Speaker 1>about the power shutting off and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>then if it's not worried about </v>

1096
00:48:32.571 --> 00:48:33.090
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't have any fear,</v>

1097
00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:36.930
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't have any emotion where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's considering the potential of death,</v>

1098
00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:38.910
<v Speaker 1>like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would it act?</v>

1099
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:41.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that would sit there.</v>

1100
00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:46.400
<v Speaker 2>I think at some point in the code you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to write something that compels </v>

1101
00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.191
<v Speaker 2>them to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you think of human beings as we </v>

1102
00:48:49.191 --> 00:48:52.071
<v Speaker 2>exist now is like the first attempt at </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentient ai and I think that's a pretty </v>

1103
00:48:52.171 --> 00:48:57.171
<v Speaker 2>plausible way to look at us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You realize we are by nature an active </v>

1104
00:48:57.171 --> 00:48:58.860
<v Speaker 2>species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we go into any environment.</v>

1105
00:48:58.861 --> 00:49:03.861
<v Speaker 2>We try to figure it out first and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominate it and no matter where you put </v>

1106
00:49:03.861 --> 00:49:04.380
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we try to do.</v>

1107
00:49:04.381 --> 00:49:09.381
<v Speaker 2>You put us in the Arctic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to try to tame the cold you </v>

1108
00:49:09.381 --> 00:49:09.381
<v Speaker 2>put us on the plains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1109
00:49:09.381 --> 00:49:09.381
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1110
00:49:09.381 --> 00:49:11.370
<v Speaker 2>in middle America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to hunt the bison.</v>

1111
00:49:11.371 --> 00:49:12.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just what we do,</v>

1112
00:49:12.871 --> 00:49:14.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got the drive of survival,</v>

1113
00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:19.140
<v Speaker 2>but you also just have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that exploration gene.</v>

1114
00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:24.140
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's because that's how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>avoided everybody dying of one play </v>

1115
00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:26.730
<v Speaker 2>because you just constantly wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>spread out and dominate new dominion.</v>

1116
00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's interesting.</v>

1117
00:49:28.801 --> 00:49:32.280
<v Speaker 2>And so at some level that's a decision </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you think about Ai,</v>

1118
00:49:32.281 --> 00:49:34.720
<v Speaker 2>so somebody whatever blind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1119
00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:35.700
<v Speaker 2>evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

1120
00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:38.700
<v Speaker 2>but something has made that decision for</v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

1121
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000
<v Speaker 2>And in Ai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will have to be a very cognizant </v>

1122
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.750
<v Speaker 2>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think we'll have to get to true </v>

1123
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:50.871
<v Speaker 2>general ai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so many layers will have to be </v>

1124
00:49:50.871 --> 00:49:51.510
<v Speaker 2>laid down of things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1125
00:49:51.511 --> 00:49:53.840
<v Speaker 2>this is an act of robot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It never just sits idly.</v>

1126
00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:57.960
<v Speaker 2>It always is looking for and what's I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think connection to be of service,</v>

1127
00:49:57.961 --> 00:50:00.030
<v Speaker 2>like decisions like that will have to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>made.</v>

1128
00:50:00.031 --> 00:50:05.031
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do with the psycho who's </v>

1129
00:50:05.031 --> 00:50:06.741
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to create ai that takes that </v>

1130
00:50:06.741 --> 00:50:09.351
<v Speaker 2>opensource because this will inevitably </v>
<v Speaker 2>be open source and I switched the </v>

1131
00:50:09.351 --> 00:50:09.680
<v Speaker 2>variable from being nice to crush the </v>
<v Speaker 2>skull.</v>

1132
00:50:09.681 --> 00:50:10.230
<v Speaker 2>Love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1133
00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:15.440
<v Speaker 2>So no question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are all kinds of problems but it </v>

1134
00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:19.881
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is so interesting to me to think </v>

1135
00:50:19.881 --> 00:50:19.881
<v Speaker 2>about this stuff.</v>

1136
00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Interesting to think of why people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>so attracted to the romantic ideas of </v>

1137
00:50:26.121 --> 00:50:31.121
<v Speaker 1>like living off land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like as technology is getting more and </v>

1138
00:50:31.121 --> 00:50:34.631
<v Speaker 1>more complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you seeing more of these reality shows </v>

1139
00:50:34.631 --> 00:50:37.390
<v Speaker 1>where people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm living the subsistence existence in </v>

1140
00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:41.270
<v Speaker 1>like Alaska and salmon fishing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trapping their own wood for fire.</v>

1141
00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:41.900
<v Speaker 1>And we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1142
00:50:41.901 --> 00:50:46.901
<v Speaker 1>look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's existing at a very closed loop </v>

1143
00:50:46.901 --> 00:50:47.120
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know like when your.</v>

1144
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:49.940
<v Speaker 1>When you look at it like plains Indians </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

1145
00:50:49.941 --> 00:50:52.670
<v Speaker 1>We romanticize the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used all of the bison.</v>

1146
00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:54.830
<v Speaker 1>They use the hide for their clothes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

1147
00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:57.860
<v Speaker 1>They just did what they needed to stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive and there was no innovation.</v>

1148
00:50:57.861 --> 00:51:02.861
<v Speaker 1>If you were born birth to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't see any change in the </v>

1149
00:51:02.861 --> 00:51:07.420
<v Speaker 1>civilization you would see essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like bows and arrows chasing bison,</v>

1150
00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:12.550
<v Speaker 1>making campfire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>picking up the teepee when the herd </v>

1151
00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:13.370
<v Speaker 1>moves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>filing them Ad Nauseum,</v>

1152
00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:14.900
<v Speaker 1>continue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1153
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:15.610
<v Speaker 1>it's there.</v>

1154
00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:19.070
<v Speaker 1>That's very romantic tests right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Particularly Romantic.</v>

1155
00:51:19.071 --> 00:51:24.071
<v Speaker 1>I think it kind of always was in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>way because I think we've always been </v>

1156
00:51:24.071 --> 00:51:25.040
<v Speaker 1>aware that this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once it gets going,</v>

1157
00:51:25.041 --> 00:51:27.200
<v Speaker 1>once the momentum gets rolling and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1158
00:51:27.201 --> 00:51:28.940
<v Speaker 1>as you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exponential change,</v>

1159
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:29.860
<v Speaker 1>it's just jump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump,</v>

1160
00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:30.340
<v Speaker 1>jump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump,</v>

1161
00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:33.440
<v Speaker 1>jump stacking on top of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we all know,</v>

1162
00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:38.650
<v Speaker 1>like it's gotten to weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unmanageable position during our </v>

1163
00:51:38.650 --> 00:51:39.580
<v Speaker 1>lifetimes as far as information is </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

1164
00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:40.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a kid,</v>

1165
00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:42.870
<v Speaker 1>he had to read books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1166
00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.950
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to watch something on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to be there when it came on,</v>

1167
00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:46.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

1168
00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.680
<v Speaker 1>And then you saw it once and that was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrap,</v>

1169
00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:53.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get see reruns was the only way </v>

1170
00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:53.730
<v Speaker 1>you could see something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1171
00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:53.730
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the steps,</v>

1172
00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:54.470
<v Speaker 1>so this is a rerun.</v>

1173
00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:59.880
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't choose when to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can choose everything all the </v>

1174
00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.910
<v Speaker 1>time on your phone you're carrying </v>
<v Speaker 1>around in your pocket.</v>

1175
00:52:01.911 --> 00:52:06.860
<v Speaker 1>It works for hours and hours of video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The input that you have into that.</v>

1176
00:52:06.861 --> 00:52:09.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like you could create your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>content,</v>

1177
00:52:09.081 --> 00:52:10.570
<v Speaker 1>you can make your own videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1178
00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:15.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many fucking people are on </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube that have millions and millions </v>

1179
00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:21.310
<v Speaker 1>and millions of videos of hits rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>have their videos and just all these </v>

1180
00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:25.001
<v Speaker 1>people tuning into their content all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the world and that just the idea </v>

1181
00:52:25.001 --> 00:52:29.561
<v Speaker 1>that this is happening in our lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't exist 20 years ago and it's </v>

1182
00:52:29.561 --> 00:52:32.000
<v Speaker 1>now one of the most impactful things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of human nature.</v>

1183
00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:37.120
<v Speaker 1>You got to go back to like the printing </v>
<v Speaker 1>press for anything to have you remotely </v>

1184
00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.110
<v Speaker 1>as much of an impact on the culture as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet itself.</v>

1185
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:41.600
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in our life is crazy.</v>

1186
00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:42.530
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old are you?</v>

1188
00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:48.410

1258
00:55:30.211 --> 00:55:32.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old school society,</v>

1259
00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:34.350
<v Speaker 1>but the really small ones with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>

1260
00:55:34.351 --> 00:55:36.690
<v Speaker 1>The above one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

1261
00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:41.860
<v Speaker 1>The fuck is that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tried to make a new kind of like </v>

1262
00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:41.860
<v Speaker 1>dial all around it.</v>

1263
00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:46.020
<v Speaker 1>You hold that thing up to your ear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a cell phone.</v>

1264
00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:49.380
<v Speaker 1>I was like the size of a beeper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1265
00:55:49.381 --> 00:55:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Those were the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those little tiny ass phones.</v>

1266
00:55:52.171 --> 00:55:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Now you get that new galaxy note eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that monstrosity?</v>

1267
00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Gigantic is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess whose pockets are going to </v>

1268
00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.570
<v Speaker 1>fit these things in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real problem.</v>

1269
00:56:03.571 --> 00:56:07.200
<v Speaker 1>When I first got my iphone six S,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that that six plus?</v>

1270
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:08.520
<v Speaker 1>That's the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was big.</v>

1271
00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:09.950
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>

1272
00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:13.020
<v Speaker 1>like it wouldn't even fit in my pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was the first time.</v>

1273
00:56:13.021 --> 00:56:14.880
<v Speaker 1>And I'm still like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used the big phone,</v>

1274
00:56:14.881 --> 00:56:19.881
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of that nuance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the s eight plus Jesus Christ </v>

1275
00:56:20.251 --> 00:56:22.890
<v Speaker 1>that's attach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the s eight.</v>

1276
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:27.130
<v Speaker 1>The note eight is even bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that thing.</v>

1277
00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a pet look at the size of that </v>

1278
00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:32.370
<v Speaker 1>thing like that.</v>

1279
00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:34.330
<v Speaker 1>That could be a woman with small hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell.</v>

1280
00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:36.790
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see it in the hands of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball player,</v>

1281
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:42.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if like if you've got like Lebron James </v>

1282
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.390
<v Speaker 1>like fondly or go to a foreigner can </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold in my hand,</v>

1283
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:46.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because for him it's probably like King </v>

1284
00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:48.541
<v Speaker 1>Kong home little tiny people know was </v>
<v Speaker 1>big giant hands.</v>

1285
00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Like for a basketball player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

1286
00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:54.730
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a bill russell type </v>
<v Speaker 1>character with giant hands.</v>

1287
00:56:54.850 --> 00:56:59.320
<v Speaker 1>That's a good size phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But too small people.</v>

1288
00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:02.230
<v Speaker 1>Not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just trying too hard.</v>

1289
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:03.260
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

1290
00:57:03.261 --> 00:57:05.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a galaxy note before.</v>

1291
00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I never used that pen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use when I first got it,</v>

1292
00:57:09.371 --> 00:57:10.960
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this pen is gonna rule.</v>

1293
00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:13.300
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be the big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna send people pictures.</v>

1294
00:57:13.301 --> 00:57:14.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Draw dicks on them.</v>

1295
00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:15.550
<v Speaker 1>I had this plan.</v>

1296
00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:17.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a good plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the plan.</v>

1297
00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:23.380
<v Speaker 1>It was just like to just make funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures over there and then never used </v>

1298
00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:24.490
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got lazy.</v>

1299
00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:26.560
<v Speaker 1>I think I just wasn't that into one </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1300
00:57:26.561 --> 00:57:31.561
<v Speaker 1>It is interesting though is that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>circle something and like say if like </v>

1301
00:57:31.561 --> 00:57:32.620
<v Speaker 1>there's a part of an article that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think is interesting,</v>

1302
00:57:32.621 --> 00:57:35.440
<v Speaker 1>you could circle it and copy and paste </v>
<v Speaker 1>it really simply and easily.</v>

1303
00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1304
00:57:36.101 --> 00:57:38.320
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty good with the actual image</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

1305
00:57:38.321 --> 00:57:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Like say if someone sends you something </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's some text and image,</v>

1306
00:57:41.951 --> 00:57:45.340
<v Speaker 1>you could just circle around it and send</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to yourself and say,</v>

1307
00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:47.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you use?</v>

1308
00:57:47.291 --> 00:57:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Iphone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1309
00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever fuck around with windows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1310
00:57:51.251 --> 00:57:53.710
<v Speaker 1>I did for awhile while my first computer</v>
<v Speaker 1>was windows.</v>

1311
00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for work.</v>

1312
00:57:54.791 --> 00:57:56.470
<v Speaker 1>At one point I was having to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>windows.</v>

1313
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:57.850
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1314
00:57:57.910 --> 00:58:01.210
<v Speaker 1>as somebody who really appreciates good </v>
<v Speaker 1>design that didn't last long.</v>

1315
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Windows 10 is pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1316
00:58:02.890 --> 00:58:05.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty God damn good.</v>

1317
00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:11.370
<v Speaker 1>But that's what's always been </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating to me is that Microsoft is </v>

1318
00:58:11.370 --> 00:58:11.500
<v Speaker 1>the biggest company when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>operating systems,</v>

1319
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:14.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1320
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:16.190
<v Speaker 1>and everybody kind of knows that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1321
00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:18.820
<v Speaker 1>there's this weird sort of battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1322
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:21.130
<v Speaker 1>apple's big enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have plenty,</v>

1323
00:58:21.131 --> 00:58:26.131
<v Speaker 1>they make the best stuff that make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most high end stuff and a lot of </v>

1324
00:58:26.131 --> 00:58:26.131
<v Speaker 1>people's eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real limited.</v>

1325
00:58:26.350 --> 00:58:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Like you can only get what they put out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want a windows laptop,</v>

1326
00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:33.370
<v Speaker 1>you have a hundred options and the more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1327
00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:35.440
<v Speaker 1>if you want a Mac laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a few.</v>

1328
00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:38.170
<v Speaker 1>But the interesting thing is that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>steve jobs approach,</v>

1329
00:58:38.171 --> 00:58:39.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was He came in and said,</v>

1330
00:58:39.581 --> 00:58:40.660
<v Speaker 1>you have too many options.</v>

1331
00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:45.660
<v Speaker 1>This is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've really got to narrow this stuff </v>

1332
00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:47.581
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft surface laptops pulled their </v>

1333
00:58:47.581 --> 00:58:49.791
<v Speaker 1>recommendation after announcing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess two years ago they recommended </v>

1334
00:58:49.791 --> 00:58:51.160
<v Speaker 1>it and now it's like the first time </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've pulled it in a long time.</v>

1335
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

1336
00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Predicted reliability with an estimated </v>
<v Speaker 1>two year breakage rates of 25 percent.</v>

1337
00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

1338
00:58:58.570 --> 00:59:01.720
<v Speaker 1>They got cheap specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new one that Microsoft surface.</v>

1339
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Well that's interesting because there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was another study that I saw written out</v>

1340
00:59:04.531 --> 00:59:05.250
<v Speaker 1>the study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1341
00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:05.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1342
00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:09.850
<v Speaker 1>one of those lists that listed is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best laptop available in 2017.</v>

1343
00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:15.140
<v Speaker 1>I just like within the last week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just like different consumer </v>

1344
00:59:15.311 --> 00:59:20.311
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe the best laptop while it </v>

1345
00:59:20.311 --> 00:59:20.311
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1346
00:59:20.311 --> 00:59:21.830
<v Speaker 1>If what you have is a breakage prior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1347
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:25.280
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is that working while </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's working,</v>

1348
00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:26.840
<v Speaker 2>it's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long it's going to work.</v>

1349
00:59:26.841 --> 00:59:28.520
<v Speaker 2>It's not gonna work that well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1350
00:59:28.521 --> 00:59:29.930
<v Speaker 2>it's like a sprinter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1351
00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:32.030
<v Speaker 2>they're the fastest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't run the longest.</v>

1352
00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Very true right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's fair.</v>

1353
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:37.700
<v Speaker 2>So what are you trying to do with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>company?</v>

1354
00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Like literally pull people out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Matrix.</v>

1355
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:42.740
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

1356
00:59:42.741 --> 00:59:44.420
<v Speaker 2>That is our stated mission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend.</v>

1357
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:49.450
<v Speaker 2>We are here to pull people out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>matrix so I can walk you through it if </v>

1358
00:59:49.450 --> 00:59:50.270
<v Speaker 2>you really want to know it goes like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1359
00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:51.460
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1360
00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:55.160
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a born entrepreneur,</v>

1361
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:58.660
<v Speaker 2>so I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very far from it and three are,</v>

1362
00:59:58.670 --> 01:00:01.190
<v Speaker 2>they're born entrepreneurs are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people that will tell you that</v>

1363
01:00:01.191 --> 01:00:04.280
<v Speaker 2>there are only born entrepreneurs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people are idiots.</v>

1364
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would agree with that.</v>

1365
01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.700
<v Speaker 2>There's some amazing people that say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1366
01:00:07.701 --> 01:00:11.660
<v Speaker 2>but I just think that they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very catastrophic wrong about this.</v>

1367
01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.760
<v Speaker 2>People say Shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me.</v>

1368
01:00:13.761 --> 01:00:16.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like saying you're a born mixed </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial artists now.</v>

1369
01:00:16.641 --> 01:00:19.640
<v Speaker 2>There might be people that have certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletic gifts that make it,</v>

1370
01:00:19.641 --> 01:00:24.641
<v Speaker 2>they get early wins and there's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that clicked into place for them </v>

1371
01:00:24.641 --> 01:00:24.641
<v Speaker 2>in a way that it doesn't for other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1372
01:00:24.641 --> 01:00:29.261
<v Speaker 2>But if you get a grinder or somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really willing to put in the </v>

1373
01:00:29.261 --> 01:00:31.991
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can get somebody who becomes </v>

1374
01:00:31.991 --> 01:00:33.200
<v Speaker 2>absolutely extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that certainly has been my life.</v>

1375
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:35.510
<v Speaker 2>So I grew up being taught to be a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>employee,</v>

1376
01:00:35.511 --> 01:00:40.511
<v Speaker 2>keep my head down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do as little work as possible and avoid </v>

1377
01:00:40.511 --> 01:00:40.511
<v Speaker 2>punishment at all costs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was my life.</v>

1378
01:00:40.511 --> 01:00:44.290
<v Speaker 2>So my parents taught me to be a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>employee and I obviously that didn't sit</v>

1379
01:00:44.691 --> 01:00:45.230
<v Speaker 2>well with me.</v>

1380
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:47.930
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do something more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had pretty big ambition.</v>

1381
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:52.990
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to film school and I do very well </v>

1382
01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:53.390
<v Speaker 2>in film school until my final film and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I fall flat on my face,</v>

1383
01:00:53.391 --> 01:00:55.760
<v Speaker 2>embarrass myself and realize I'm not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>talented filmmaker.</v>

1384
01:00:56.150 --> 01:01:01.150
<v Speaker 2>And in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what made you notice that you weren't </v>

1385
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:01.150
<v Speaker 2>in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why'd you think you couldn't get better?</v>

1386
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.540
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great question.</v>

1387
01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:06.830
<v Speaker 2>So when I started film school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believed that you either were talented</v>

1388
01:01:06.831 --> 01:01:11.831
<v Speaker 2>or you weren't right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just some things you either can </v>

1389
01:01:11.831 --> 01:01:11.831
<v Speaker 2>sing or you can't do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other can draw,</v>

1390
01:01:11.831 --> 01:01:11.831
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1391
01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.910
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I saw film as art,</v>

1392
01:01:13.911 --> 01:01:18.911
<v Speaker 2>you were either good or you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was how I thought of it and </v>

1393
01:01:18.911 --> 01:01:18.911
<v Speaker 2>I thought you could get better at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technical side.</v>

1394
01:01:18.911 --> 01:01:20.930
<v Speaker 2>So I was going to film school to learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>the technical aspects,</v>

1395
01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:24.320
<v Speaker 2>but I was banking on the fact that I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>inherently talented.</v>

1396
01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:29.350
<v Speaker 2>So I go and my first year and a half </v>
<v Speaker 2>went very well and I was crushing it </v>

1397
01:01:30.441 --> 01:01:32.840
<v Speaker 2>certainly by my own estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing very well,</v>

1398
01:01:32.841 --> 01:01:37.841
<v Speaker 2>getting the attention of my classmates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then only four people out of the </v>

1399
01:01:37.841 --> 01:01:41.300
<v Speaker 2>entire school for your year get to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>a senior thesis film.</v>

1400
01:01:41.301 --> 01:01:43.610
<v Speaker 2>And I was chosen as one of the four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>

1401
01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:44.500
<v Speaker 2>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1402
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:49.510
<v Speaker 2>I have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there were two filmmakers that were </v>

1403
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.880
<v Speaker 2>really big for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One was John Wu.</v>

1404
01:01:49.881 --> 01:01:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember John Lewis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1405
01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:56.810
<v Speaker 2>like the eighties and nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just shoot 'em ups a lot.</v>

1406
01:01:56.930 --> 01:02:00.500
<v Speaker 2>And I loved him and he was famous for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would roll up on set.</v>

1407
01:02:00.501 --> 01:02:01.820
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't think about it ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1408
01:02:01.821 --> 01:02:05.720
<v Speaker 2>He just put the camera wherever felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>right and his movies were mind blowing.</v>

1409
01:02:05.721 --> 01:02:07.250
<v Speaker 2>People always refer to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1410
01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.080
<v Speaker 2>His violence is like a ballet.</v>

1411
01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.880
<v Speaker 2>It's now well orchestrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That beautiful,</v>

1412
01:02:10.881 --> 01:02:12.350
<v Speaker 2>that interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought,</v>

1413
01:02:12.351 --> 01:02:17.351
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if I'm naturally talented than I </v>

1414
01:02:17.351 --> 01:02:17.351
<v Speaker 2>should be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there was,</v>

1415
01:02:17.351 --> 01:02:17.840
<v Speaker 2>hitchcock was sort of the plotter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1416
01:02:17.841 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 2>he would spend all of his time like pre </v>
<v Speaker 2>planning,</v>

1417
01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:25.041
<v Speaker 2>the film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every shot was so orchestrated ahead of </v>

1418
01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:25.041
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1419
01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:25.041
<v Speaker 2>I get bored on set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

1420
01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:29.961
<v Speaker 2>God man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he doesn't sound like natural </v>

1421
01:02:29.961 --> 01:02:29.961
<v Speaker 2>talent to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm over here,</v>

1422
01:02:29.961 --> 01:02:34.321
<v Speaker 2>I want to be John Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I show up onset acting like I'm John </v>

1423
01:02:34.321 --> 01:02:37.760
<v Speaker 2>Woo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't preplan anything and put the </v>

1424
01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:39.081
<v Speaker 2>camera where it feels right and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>publicly embarrassed myself as I turn </v>

1425
01:02:39.081 --> 01:02:43.461
<v Speaker 2>this film into a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at that point I thought I was about </v>

1426
01:02:43.461 --> 01:02:44.850
<v Speaker 2>to graduate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get the three picture deal.</v>

1427
01:02:44.851 --> 01:02:46.950
<v Speaker 2>Everything is going to be sad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be amazing.</v>

1428
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:49.110
<v Speaker 2>And there I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crash and burn.</v>

1429
01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:54.110
<v Speaker 2>Now the other students are circling me </v>
<v Speaker 2>like vultures because I mean that's the </v>

1430
01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:56.070
<v Speaker 2>film industry man like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a zero sum game or at least it was</v>

1431
01:02:56.071 --> 01:03:01.071
<v Speaker 2>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how people saw because it wasn't </v>

1432
01:03:01.071 --> 01:03:01.071
<v Speaker 2>like today where you could edit on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>

1433
01:03:01.071 --> 01:03:02.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm usually editing like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that didn't exist.</v>

1434
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.780
<v Speaker 2>So it was you had to get access to real </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>

1435
01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:09.270
<v Speaker 2>So when I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

1436
01:03:09.271 --> 01:03:13.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a thesis project to show </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to get an agent or whatever,</v>

1437
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.600
<v Speaker 2>it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a talented filmmaker.</v>

1438
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:20.990
<v Speaker 2>And so I was so desperate in that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>needed something that would free me from</v>

1439
01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:26.880
<v Speaker 2>feeling like a permanent failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that thing that I had was the notion</v>

1440
01:03:26.881 --> 01:03:29.130
<v Speaker 2>of Alfred Hitchcock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even though it wasn't sexy,</v>

1441
01:03:29.131 --> 01:03:32.340
<v Speaker 2>it gave me a window into maybe there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>another way,</v>

1442
01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:37.370
<v Speaker 2>maybe there is another way that somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be an artist and and they just have </v>

1443
01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:37.370
<v Speaker 2>to learn it.</v>

1444
01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Like think about if somebody draws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1445
01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:40.170
<v Speaker 2>Some people can rotate an object in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their mind.</v>

1446
01:03:40.171 --> 01:03:41.610
<v Speaker 2>If you've seen on Iq tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make it.</v>

1447
01:03:41.611 --> 01:03:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>

1448
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:44.460
<v Speaker 2>I literally can't rotate an object in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

1449
01:03:44.461 --> 01:03:46.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't even understand people that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

1450
01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:52.130
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe you could become a great </v>

1451
01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:52.260
<v Speaker 2>artist just by memorizing every </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceivable pose,</v>

1452
01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:57.261
<v Speaker 2>like a chess player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The great chess grand masters are the </v>

1453
01:03:57.261 --> 01:03:58.290
<v Speaker 2>ones that have memorized so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>different moves and combinations that it</v>

1454
01:03:58.291 --> 01:03:59.970
<v Speaker 2>becomes somewhat intuitive for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>

1455
01:03:59.971 --> 01:04:04.971
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to have to be my path that </v>

1456
01:04:04.971 --> 01:04:04.971
<v Speaker 2>gave me an escape route.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then going down that path of saying,</v>

1457
01:04:04.971 --> 01:04:07.200
<v Speaker 2>I just have to learn this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not naturally talented,</v>

1458
01:04:07.201 --> 01:04:08.760
<v Speaker 2>but I have to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately,</v>

1459
01:04:08.761 --> 01:04:11.310
<v Speaker 2>Carol Dweck had not written her book </v>
<v Speaker 2>mindset at that point,</v>

1460
01:04:11.311 --> 01:04:13.920
<v Speaker 2>so I didn't have the words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>growth mindset,</v>

1461
01:04:13.921 --> 01:04:16.320
<v Speaker 2>fixed mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I began to transition out.</v>

1462
01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:21.320
<v Speaker 2>So a fixed mindset is what I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you believe your talent and </v>

1463
01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:21.480
<v Speaker 2>intelligence are fixed traits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't be changed.</v>

1464
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Somebody with a growth mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>realizing that your talent and </v>

1465
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:29.151
<v Speaker 2>intelligence are malleable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can develop them through </v>

1466
01:04:29.151 --> 01:04:32.001
<v Speaker 2>discipline practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I began to adopt sort of the </v>

1467
01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:33.600
<v Speaker 2>beginnings of that mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>realizing that I'm just a grinder,</v>

1468
01:04:33.601 --> 01:04:37.590
<v Speaker 2>I have to work and I have to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I start teaching film school,</v>

1469
01:04:37.591 --> 01:04:42.591
<v Speaker 2>and in teaching film school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best way to learn something is to </v>

1470
01:04:42.591 --> 01:04:42.750
<v Speaker 2>teach it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm getting better as a filmmaker</v>

1471
01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:45.840
<v Speaker 2>just by teaching it to these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>helping them develop their scripts,</v>

1472
01:04:45.841 --> 01:04:47.940
<v Speaker 2>helping them shoot their films.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1473
01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that time,</v>

1474
01:04:49.171 --> 01:04:54.171
<v Speaker 2>these two very successful entrepreneurs </v>
<v Speaker 2>came into my class and there were two </v>

1475
01:04:54.171 --> 01:04:57.411
<v Speaker 2>things as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I promised myself growing up in a </v>

1476
01:04:57.411 --> 01:04:59.751
<v Speaker 2>morbidly obese family that one day I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be rich and one day I'd have six </v>

1477
01:04:59.751 --> 01:04:59.751
<v Speaker 2>pack abs.</v>

1478
01:04:59.751 --> 01:05:01.470
<v Speaker 2>And so here were these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were yolked,</v>

1479
01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:06.770
<v Speaker 2>these two yoked bodybuilder guys that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were successful entrepreneurs and they </v>

1480
01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:10.791
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you come work for us and be a </v>

1481
01:05:10.791 --> 01:05:11.100
<v Speaker 2>copywriter and it's a startup company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can have any role in the company you</v>

1482
01:05:11.101 --> 01:05:16.101
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you just have to become the right </v>

1483
01:05:16.101 --> 01:05:16.500
<v Speaker 2>person for that job and then you can get</v>
<v Speaker 2>rich and you can go back and control the</v>

1484
01:05:16.501 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 2>art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can movies your way.</v>

1485
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:19.540
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1486
01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:21.730
<v Speaker 2>like this is too good to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to go do this.</v>

1487
01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:27.030
<v Speaker 2>So I joined them as a copywriter as they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were starting this fledgling technology </v>

1488
01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:31.501
<v Speaker 2>company and I'm just to keep this from </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting impossibly long for about eight </v>

1489
01:05:31.501 --> 01:05:32.440
<v Speaker 2>and a half years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just chase money.</v>

1490
01:05:32.441 --> 01:05:35.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to get rich to go back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and make movies my way.</v>

1491
01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:37.690
<v Speaker 2>But in that they were very growth </v>
<v Speaker 2>minded.</v>

1492
01:05:37.690 --> 01:05:42.690
<v Speaker 2>I began to really develop a growth </v>
<v Speaker 2>mindset to believe that I could do </v>

1493
01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:43.240
<v Speaker 2>anything I set my mind to without </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitation.</v>

1494
01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:48.480
<v Speaker 2>I just had to understand that there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a gap in skillset between where I was </v>

1495
01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:51.421
<v Speaker 2>and where I wanted to get and I had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be willing to put in the work to get </v>

1496
01:05:51.421 --> 01:05:51.421
<v Speaker 2>that skill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1497
01:05:51.421 --> 01:05:51.430
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1498
01:05:51.431 --> 01:05:53.700
<v Speaker 2>I trained exactly one time with a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1499
01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:55.630
<v Speaker 2>you must know him for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hobby.</v>

1500
01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

1501
01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:58.420
<v Speaker 2>So for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1502
01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:03.421
<v Speaker 2>I feel a moral obligation to help him </v>
<v Speaker 2>become famous because he is one of the </v>

1503
01:06:03.421 --> 01:06:05.800
<v Speaker 2>most intriguing minds I've ever come </v>
<v Speaker 2>across in my life.</v>

1504
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:07.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were supposed to do a podcast last.</v>

1505
01:06:07.571 --> 01:06:10.180
<v Speaker 2>There's a UFC in Anaheim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his fighter got canceled,</v>

1506
01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.030
<v Speaker 2>the flight got canceled and so he won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not coming on.</v>

1507
01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of though that as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

1508
01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:20.370
<v Speaker 2>heartbreaking as a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a trainer as well as mixed martial </v>

1509
01:06:20.370 --> 01:06:20.440
<v Speaker 2>artist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very talented guy.</v>

1510
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in getting to roll with him in my </v>

1511
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:29.140
<v Speaker 2>single moment as a grappler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1512
01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:31.030
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever grab it before?</v>

1513
01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:31.750
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>

1514
01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:33.640
<v Speaker 2>So you just rolled with him the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1515
01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.960
<v Speaker 2>but he's a black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1516
01:06:34.961 --> 01:06:39.961
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why it was the best thing </v>

1517
01:06:39.961 --> 01:06:41.251
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he knew how to not let me get </v>

1518
01:06:41.251 --> 01:06:42.901
<v Speaker 2>injured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knew how to move and just the right </v>

1519
01:06:42.901 --> 01:06:42.901
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to show me things.</v>

1520
01:06:42.901 --> 01:06:44.800
<v Speaker 2>He's so kind and compassionate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>patient.</v>

1521
01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:50.070
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine a better intro to </v>
<v Speaker 2>grappling was unbelievable and what it </v>

1522
01:06:50.070 --> 01:06:52.990
<v Speaker 2>showed me that even just in like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour that he and I grappled,</v>

1523
01:06:52.991 --> 01:06:54.220
<v Speaker 2>I went from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1524
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:57.430
<v Speaker 2>I am so lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even spatially I can't tell where I am.</v>

1525
01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:01.300
<v Speaker 2>Like once you start moving me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just get lost and then an hour later I</v>

1526
01:07:01.301 --> 01:07:03.520
<v Speaker 2>could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gave me like these two basic moves to</v>

1527
01:07:03.521 --> 01:07:08.521
<v Speaker 2>learn how to execute and by the end I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could do it and it was like the exact </v>

1528
01:07:08.521 --> 01:07:12.811
<v Speaker 2>reminder of what a growth mindset is and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how even something that foreign to me </v>

1529
01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:16.360
<v Speaker 2>with a good teacher practice you can get</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

1530
01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:21.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to take years and years and </v>

1531
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:22.240
<v Speaker 2>years to become even competent in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu,</v>

1532
01:07:22.241 --> 01:07:24.460
<v Speaker 2>let alone be able to participate at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>high level.</v>

1533
01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:29.080
<v Speaker 2>But it was a great micro reminder of </v>
<v Speaker 2>just how powerfully humans can learn.</v>

1534
01:07:29.081 --> 01:07:32.080
<v Speaker 2>Now here's my theory about humans and </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning and why,</v>

1535
01:07:32.110 --> 01:07:34.540
<v Speaker 2>and just I guess to wrap up my </v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurial journey,</v>

1536
01:07:34.541 --> 01:07:37.640
<v Speaker 2>so I decide I don't want to chase money </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1537
01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.390
<v Speaker 2>Not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I go into my partners.</v>

1538
01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:39.790
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1539
01:07:39.791 --> 01:07:41.060
<v Speaker 2>I quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is about eight and a half.</v>

1540
01:07:41.410 --> 01:07:43.060
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I quit it about the six year mark.</v>

1541
01:07:43.061 --> 01:07:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Ended up actually getting out at about </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight and half years,</v>

1542
01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:46.540
<v Speaker 2>so six years I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I quit,</v>

1543
01:07:46.541 --> 01:07:48.340
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm living the cliche of money.</v>

1544
01:07:48.341 --> 01:07:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Can't buy happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is absolutely ridiculous.</v>

1545
01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:52.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm so here's your equity back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>final,</v>

1546
01:07:52.451 --> 01:07:54.190
<v Speaker 2>cross the finish line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ash and get anything for this.</v>

1547
01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:56.830
<v Speaker 2>So you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't obligated to give that money</v>

1548
01:07:56.831 --> 01:07:58.150
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You decided to correct.</v>

1549
01:07:58.870 --> 01:08:00.820
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that to me,</v>

1550
01:08:00.821 --> 01:08:05.821
<v Speaker 2>is is the right thing to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yell or do I get shot at the end of </v>

1551
01:08:05.821 --> 01:08:05.821
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1552
01:08:05.821 --> 01:08:08.050
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like so romanticized it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1553
01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:10.420
<v Speaker 2>So I think everybody should live by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>code,</v>

1554
01:08:10.421 --> 01:08:12.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what's right for you.</v>

1555
01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:16.310
<v Speaker 2>And so I have a code,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strong code that I live by.</v>

1556
01:08:16.311 --> 01:08:18.290
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the things like I'm the </v>
<v Speaker 2>one quitting,</v>

1557
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:20.870
<v Speaker 2>like these guys have done nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 2>create opportunity for me,</v>

1558
01:08:20.871 --> 01:08:25.871
<v Speaker 2>so I'm quitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to cross the finish line </v>

1559
01:08:25.871 --> 01:08:25.871
<v Speaker 2>because I feel literally dead inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't keep doing.</v>

1560
01:08:25.871 --> 01:08:30.641
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized the game you're playing is </v>

1561
01:08:30.641 --> 01:08:30.641
<v Speaker 2>not money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I promise it's not success.</v>

1562
01:08:30.641 --> 01:08:33.920
<v Speaker 2>It's brain chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once you understand the game,</v>

1563
01:08:33.921 --> 01:08:38.840
<v Speaker 2>your playing is brain chemistry and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have seven point $4,000,000,000</v>

1564
01:08:38.841 --> 01:08:40.310
<v Speaker 2>and hate your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to commit suicide.</v>

1565
01:08:40.310 --> 01:08:45.310
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck good is the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And conversely if you have no money but </v>

1566
01:08:45.310 --> 01:08:49.631
<v Speaker 2>you feel a deep sense of fulfillment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self pride and believe in what you're </v>

1567
01:08:49.631 --> 01:08:53.921
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you care that you don't </v>

1568
01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:53.921
<v Speaker 2>have money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better brand chemistry,</v>

1569
01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:54.050
<v Speaker 2>better brain chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1570
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.180
<v Speaker 2>so what'd you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they said,</v>

1571
01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:57.590
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could do this without you.</v>

1572
01:08:57.591 --> 01:09:02.591
<v Speaker 2>They were totally caught off guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said we could do this without you </v>

1573
01:09:02.591 --> 01:09:05.171
<v Speaker 2>but we don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's talk about what would it look </v>

1574
01:09:05.171 --> 01:09:08.891
<v Speaker 2>like for us to work together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so by this point we've got a deep </v>

1575
01:09:08.891 --> 01:09:08.891
<v Speaker 2>friendship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1576
01:09:08.891 --> 01:09:09.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like the new kid on the block </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1577
01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:10.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

1578
01:09:10.851 --> 01:09:12.320
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're gonna work together,</v>

1579
01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:14.660
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be something entirely </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicated on value,</v>

1580
01:09:14.690 --> 01:09:16.790
<v Speaker 2>not money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to be honest.</v>

1581
01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:20.060
<v Speaker 2>My highest priority in business is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>profitability,</v>

1582
01:09:20.061 --> 01:09:20.930
<v Speaker 2>it's comradery.</v>

1583
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:23.630
<v Speaker 2>So that's why when they said we could do</v>
<v Speaker 2>this without you,</v>

1584
01:09:23.631 --> 01:09:25.010
<v Speaker 2>but we don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the thing.</v>

1585
01:09:25.011 --> 01:09:30.011
<v Speaker 2>Let me reconnect to the Brotherhood that</v>
<v Speaker 2>had made it interesting for me in the </v>

1586
01:09:30.011 --> 01:09:31.460
<v Speaker 2>early days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that felt amazing.</v>

1587
01:09:31.461 --> 01:09:35.780
<v Speaker 2>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll come back if it's all about value,</v>

1588
01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:38.990
<v Speaker 2>if we're doing something we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>passionate about and if we're asking and</v>

1589
01:09:38.991 --> 01:09:42.800
<v Speaker 2>answering the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would we do everyday and love,</v>

1590
01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:47.830
<v Speaker 2>even if we were failing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the struggle is guaranteed to </v>

1591
01:09:47.830 --> 01:09:47.870
<v Speaker 2>get a bunch of people in a business to </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree to that though,</v>

1592
01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.040
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1593
01:09:49.210 --> 01:09:51.740
<v Speaker 2>what wasn't for me because they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>already there.</v>

1594
01:09:51.830 --> 01:09:53.450
<v Speaker 2>So they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

1595
01:09:53.451 --> 01:09:56.150
<v Speaker 2>We felt the same way for a very long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time because we,</v>

1596
01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.260
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1597
01:09:57.261 --> 01:10:02.261
<v Speaker 2>and by we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were so much farther ahead than me </v>

1598
01:10:02.261 --> 01:10:05.051
<v Speaker 2>at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they really gave me the opportunity </v>

1599
01:10:05.051 --> 01:10:07.541
<v Speaker 2>to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had really built that tech company up </v>

1600
01:10:07.541 --> 01:10:09.971
<v Speaker 2>like we got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think evaluation of 22 million if I'm </v>

1601
01:10:09.971 --> 01:10:10.130
<v Speaker 2>not mistaken at one point and we just </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't get it passed.</v>

1602
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:14.240
<v Speaker 2>And so it was like we'd been struggling </v>
<v Speaker 2>for years to move the needle more and we</v>

1603
01:10:14.241 --> 01:10:16.220
<v Speaker 2>just couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't like,</v>

1604
01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:21.250
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come in and give some amazing Jerry </v>

1605
01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:21.250
<v Speaker 2>Maguire speech and they're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1606
01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:21.250
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>US too.</v>

1607
01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:23.390
<v Speaker 2>It was like finally somebody just said </v>
<v Speaker 2>what everybody was already thinking.</v>

1608
01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.350
<v Speaker 2>So they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1609
01:10:24.351 --> 01:10:29.351
<v Speaker 2>let's give us a timeline of six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we hit these revenue numbers in six </v>

1610
01:10:29.351 --> 01:10:30.380
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll keep going,</v>

1611
01:10:30.381 --> 01:10:31.550
<v Speaker 2>but if we miss them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll sell.</v>

1612
01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:36.760
<v Speaker 2>So we didn't hit them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we began the sales process and </v>

1613
01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:39.341
<v Speaker 2>all in it was about eight and a half </v>
<v Speaker 2>years by the time that was finally sold </v>

1614
01:10:39.341 --> 01:10:42.220
<v Speaker 2>and the thing for three very different </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons that we decided to found that </v>

1615
01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:46.271
<v Speaker 2>was going to be predicated around </v>
<v Speaker 2>delivering value to our employees and </v>

1616
01:10:46.271 --> 01:10:49.451
<v Speaker 2>our customers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was going to be that thing that we </v>

1617
01:10:49.451 --> 01:10:49.451
<v Speaker 2>would love doing everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if we were failing.</v>

1618
01:10:49.451 --> 01:10:51.900
<v Speaker 2>That allowed me to connect emotionally </v>
<v Speaker 2>because um,</v>

1619
01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:55.130
<v Speaker 2>it ended up being quest nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in a morbidly obese family and</v>

1620
01:10:55.131 --> 01:10:57.490
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to save my mom and my sister </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it would,</v>

1621
01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.230
<v Speaker 2>it gave me this Mother Teresa has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>great quote.</v>

1622
01:11:00.231 --> 01:11:03.800
<v Speaker 2>She says nobody will act for the many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people will act for the one.</v>

1623
01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:09.220
<v Speaker 2>So finally I could just think about two </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that I knew and loved and I </v>

1624
01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:09.560
<v Speaker 2>wanted to do something awesome for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I got tired,</v>

1625
01:11:09.561 --> 01:11:14.561
<v Speaker 2>when I was fatigued,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than thinking about money in a </v>

1626
01:11:14.561 --> 01:11:14.820
<v Speaker 2>big house and a fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was asking about fucking saving my mom</v>

1627
01:11:14.821 --> 01:11:19.821
<v Speaker 2>and my sister.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And our idea was if we could make food </v>

1628
01:11:19.821 --> 01:11:21.360
<v Speaker 2>that people could choose based on taste </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it happened to be good for them,</v>

1629
01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:24.990
<v Speaker 2>we could actually end metabolic disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was the driving force.</v>

1630
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:27.570
<v Speaker 2>And we're fucking excited about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we didn't know if it would be a real</v>

1631
01:11:27.571 --> 01:11:28.560
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know.</v>

1632
01:11:28.561 --> 01:11:30.420
<v Speaker 2>Like every time we'd explain it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1633
01:11:30.421 --> 01:11:32.220
<v Speaker 2>we're putting value first and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

1634
01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:37.221
<v Speaker 2>God did we sound like total assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like we really believed in </v>

1635
01:11:37.221 --> 01:11:40.971
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it gave us insights into social </v>

1636
01:11:40.971 --> 01:11:43.551
<v Speaker 2>media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the SPEC in 2009 when nobody was really </v>

1637
01:11:43.551 --> 01:11:43.620
<v Speaker 2>using it for business and we could see </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's just a megaphone,</v>

1638
01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.800
<v Speaker 2>so if you actually do deliver that kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of value for people,</v>

1639
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:50.370
<v Speaker 2>they're going to talk and now they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to talk to a global audience</v>

1640
01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:52.800
<v Speaker 2>within minutes of an interaction with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your company.</v>

1641
01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:54.570
<v Speaker 2>So if you were really taking care of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1642
01:11:54.571 --> 01:11:58.170
<v Speaker 2>you really delivered a product that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>real and you were building community,</v>

1643
01:11:58.171 --> 01:11:59.160
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>

1644
01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:02.610
<v Speaker 2>then you could really do something and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's how it took off.</v>

1645
01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:07.610
<v Speaker 2>But it really did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to joke and say quest as a </v>

1646
01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:07.610
<v Speaker 2>company born out of misery because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1647
01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:12.111
<v Speaker 2>it was three guys slogging it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not really even liking the product that </v>

1648
01:12:12.111 --> 01:12:16.221
<v Speaker 2>we made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just served a need in the </v>

1649
01:12:16.221 --> 01:12:16.221
<v Speaker 2>marketplace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a security software.</v>

1650
01:12:16.221 --> 01:12:17.280
<v Speaker 2>We didn't care about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't use it in our own company.</v>

1651
01:12:17.281 --> 01:12:18.660
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

1652
01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.840
<v Speaker 2>so getting into something we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with talking about nutrition.</v>

1653
01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:24.540
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've lost 60 pounds and kept it off.</v>

1654
01:12:24.810 --> 01:12:26.550
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went through a pencil head phase.</v>

1655
01:12:26.551 --> 01:12:31.551
<v Speaker 2>I've added muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like learning about diet to escape the </v>

1656
01:12:31.551 --> 01:12:32.340
<v Speaker 2>fate of my family has been so important </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

1657
01:12:32.370 --> 01:12:33.930
<v Speaker 2>but that was all back at a technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>

1658
01:12:33.931 --> 01:12:37.260
<v Speaker 2>So we were now leveraged and one of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>partners a fucking nutritional genius.</v>

1659
01:12:37.261 --> 01:12:42.261
<v Speaker 2>This dude is unreal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So leveraging what we were doing and </v>

1660
01:12:42.261 --> 01:12:46.161
<v Speaker 2>thinking about already just was insanely</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful for us as a business </v>

1661
01:12:46.531 --> 01:12:47.220
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>

1662
01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:52.350
<v Speaker 2>And we ended up making more in a single </v>
<v Speaker 2>day at quest and we made annually at the</v>

1663
01:12:52.351 --> 01:12:57.351
<v Speaker 2>tech company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you went from telling me about being </v>

1664
01:12:57.351 --> 01:13:01.701
<v Speaker 2>a failed movie maker in college to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>full journey of quest nutrition.</v>

1665
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:04.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's good or bad,</v>

1666
01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:05.910
<v Speaker 2>but there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1667
01:13:05.911 --> 01:13:07.890
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy journeyman.</v>

1668
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:13.430
<v Speaker 2>That's weird that you um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to go back to filmmaking </v>

1669
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.430
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you,</v>

1670
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:14.460
<v Speaker 2>you've realized you fucked up and why </v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucked up.</v>

1671
01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here we all come full circle.</v>

1672
01:13:16.441 --> 01:13:18.700
<v Speaker 2>So this is what your new country company</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1673
01:13:18.701 --> 01:13:23.701
<v Speaker 2>so new companies about making you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make films when you want a </v>

1674
01:13:23.701 --> 01:13:23.910
<v Speaker 2>traditional narrative content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1675
01:13:23.911 --> 01:13:25.050
<v Speaker 2>So comic books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>books,</v>

1676
01:13:25.051 --> 01:13:27.020
<v Speaker 2>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>TV shows have used fucked up.</v>

1677
01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:32.060
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think that it's one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that like when you were in film </v>

1678
01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:35.481
<v Speaker 2>school and when you're trying to come up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a thesis film that this was like a </v>

1679
01:13:35.481 --> 01:13:40.401
<v Speaker 2>step in a very long journey of figuring </v>
<v Speaker 2>out how to make films and that when you </v>

1680
01:13:40.401 --> 01:13:41.540
<v Speaker 2>left it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotTa Kinda,</v>

1681
01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:46.690
<v Speaker 2>you're going right back to where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were or has life experience giving you </v>

1682
01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:50.601
<v Speaker 2>more tools to work with and you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of apply those to the idea of </v>

1683
01:13:50.601 --> 01:13:50.601
<v Speaker 2>creative filmmaking.</v>

1684
01:13:50.601 --> 01:13:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly that.</v>

1685
01:13:51.301 --> 01:13:54.840
<v Speaker 2>So what I'm not trying to do is go back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and be a director.</v>

1686
01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:56.520
<v Speaker 2>What I want to do now is build the </v>
<v Speaker 2>studio.</v>

1687
01:13:56.521 --> 01:14:01.521
<v Speaker 2>So I'm becoming an entrepreneur and </v>
<v Speaker 2>training myself in that way has created </v>

1688
01:14:01.521 --> 01:14:06.141
<v Speaker 2>an obsession with scale for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the thought of myopically making one </v>

1689
01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:10.461
<v Speaker 2>movie is absolutely terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like just the amount of time it would </v>

1690
01:14:10.461 --> 01:14:13.240
<v Speaker 2>take and your ability to push multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>things forward.</v>

1691
01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:18.540
<v Speaker 2>Essentially grindstone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want sort of finance other people's </v>

1692
01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:18.540
<v Speaker 2>ideas and projects that will be part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1693
01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:19.570
<v Speaker 2>be a part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll be part of it.</v>

1694
01:14:19.571 --> 01:14:23.530
<v Speaker 2>Bringing a team together that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>execute at scale and create,</v>

1695
01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:24.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1696
01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:29.750
<v Speaker 2>a lot of content and in the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have to partner with </v>

1697
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:32.461
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just don't have enough finances like </v>

1698
01:14:32.461 --> 01:14:32.461
<v Speaker 2>we have enough to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1699
01:14:32.461 --> 01:14:33.040
<v Speaker 2>build the infrastructure and get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative together,</v>

1700
01:14:33.041 --> 01:14:36.790
<v Speaker 2>but we're not going to be financing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>100 plus million dollar film every year,</v>

1701
01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:39.100
<v Speaker 2>so we'll need to partner with people.</v>

1702
01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:44.130
<v Speaker 2>But that's essentially what I've spent </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last 15 years learning how to do is </v>

1703
01:14:44.130 --> 01:14:45.790
<v Speaker 2>the business side of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to build teams,</v>

1704
01:14:45.791 --> 01:14:47.320
<v Speaker 2>how to get them pointed in the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

1705
01:14:47.321 --> 01:14:48.400
<v Speaker 2>How to think through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1706
01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:53.401
<v Speaker 2>you've got this grand goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to make a studio bigger than </v>

1707
01:14:53.401 --> 01:14:53.401
<v Speaker 2>Disney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like what are the real,</v>

1708
01:14:53.401 --> 01:14:57.841
<v Speaker 2>like what are the things you can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>today to actually take a step towards </v>

1709
01:14:57.841 --> 01:15:01.261
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was your desire to do things </v>

1710
01:15:01.261 --> 01:15:01.261
<v Speaker 2>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your,</v>

1711
01:15:01.261 --> 01:15:02.320
<v Speaker 2>your desire is not to create a film </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1712
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Your desires now to create business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to create some sort of a large </v>

1713
01:15:08.351 --> 01:15:11.470
<v Speaker 2>organization sort of so in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in reality,</v>

1714
01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:16.500
<v Speaker 2>my real desires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to pull people out of the Matrix </v>

1715
01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:19.350
<v Speaker 2>so that what you said before this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to work my way back to </v>

1716
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.440
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the most sincere thing.</v>

1717
01:15:19.441 --> 01:15:22.660
<v Speaker 2>So the Matrix to me is a set of limiting</v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs that the vast majority of people</v>

1718
01:15:22.661 --> 01:15:27.661
<v Speaker 2>have to stop them from achieving what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they could achieve in life if they only </v>

1719
01:15:27.661 --> 01:15:31.291
<v Speaker 2>understood that humans are the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>adaptation machine and that we are the </v>

1720
01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:36.390
<v Speaker 2>only animal you can put into any </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment and we will be able to </v>

1721
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.670
<v Speaker 2>survive and thrive so we can do that.</v>

1722
01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:39.670
<v Speaker 2>Sort of give me an example where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

1723
01:15:39.671 --> 01:15:44.671
<v Speaker 2>well we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't survive and thrive and </v>

1724
01:15:44.671 --> 01:15:45.190
<v Speaker 2>horrifying climates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you bring people to an article,</v>

1725
01:15:45.191 --> 01:15:48.170
<v Speaker 2>they survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They certainly don't thrive and they got</v>

1726
01:15:48.171 --> 01:15:49.600
<v Speaker 2>to get out indigenous people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1727
01:15:49.601 --> 01:15:54.601
<v Speaker 2>So they do and you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can go in and build a research </v>

1728
01:15:54.601 --> 01:15:58.441
<v Speaker 2>facility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some of the adaptation is there's no </v>

1729
01:15:58.441 --> 01:15:59.320
<v Speaker 2>indigenous people live in Antarctica.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you mean?</v>

1730
01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:01.640
<v Speaker 2>In the Arctic circle as well as </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

1731
01:16:01.930 --> 01:16:03.400
<v Speaker 2>I apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1732
01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:05.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two kinds of adaptations.</v>

1733
01:16:05.201 --> 01:16:07.060
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that women that swam the Bering Strait.</v>

1734
01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she sleeps with their windows open in</v>

1735
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:12.250
<v Speaker 2>a cold climate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget where she lived.</v>

1736
01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:17.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically what she's doing by constant </v>

1737
01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.030
<v Speaker 2>cold exposure is changing her adipose </v>
<v Speaker 2>tissue to Brown fat.</v>

1738
01:16:19.031 --> 01:16:24.031
<v Speaker 2>So now it's more thermogenic and she can</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually do something that she wasn't </v>

1739
01:16:24.031 --> 01:16:24.031
<v Speaker 2>able to do.</v>

1740
01:16:24.031 --> 01:16:24.790
<v Speaker 2>And if you're really gonna let me get </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

1741
01:16:24.791 --> 01:16:29.791
<v Speaker 2>Like looking at what [inaudible] has </v>
<v Speaker 2>done with his ability to regulate </v>

1742
01:16:29.791 --> 01:16:33.361
<v Speaker 2>internal temperature is pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then just what they're discovering </v>

1743
01:16:33.361 --> 01:16:36.541
<v Speaker 2>with DNA from at one point it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered to be just junk DNA and now </v>

1744
01:16:36.541 --> 01:16:38.320
<v Speaker 2>they're realizing that it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>epigenetic responders essentially.</v>

1745
01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:40.750
<v Speaker 2>So are there limits gap?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably,</v>

1746
01:16:40.751 --> 01:16:45.250
<v Speaker 2>but just as like looking at the way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we only have what,</v>

1747
01:16:45.251 --> 01:16:48.460
<v Speaker 2>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>genes and an onion has like 40,000</v>

1748
01:16:48.461 --> 01:16:51.190
<v Speaker 2>genes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is it that makes us more complex</v>

1749
01:16:51.191 --> 01:16:52.750
<v Speaker 2>if you will give me that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are complex.</v>

1750
01:16:53.050 --> 01:16:55.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it seems to be the,</v>

1751
01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.250
<v Speaker 2>what they originally thought was junk </v>
<v Speaker 2>DNA,</v>

1752
01:16:57.251 --> 01:17:02.251
<v Speaker 2>which is your genes will turn on or off </v>
<v Speaker 2>express themselves in different amounts </v>

1753
01:17:02.251 --> 01:17:06.451
<v Speaker 2>based on your environment and your diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>and even some just like how you're </v>

1754
01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:12.331
<v Speaker 2>thinking your microbiome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all that stuff then regulates how </v>

1755
01:17:12.331 --> 01:17:15.401
<v Speaker 2>your genes were expressed and we have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>much wider ability to adapt to climates </v>

1756
01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:18.500
<v Speaker 2>if you're not going to let me go as </v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme,</v>

1757
01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:20.540
<v Speaker 2>but we have the widest stability.</v>

1758
01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Would you agree with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1759
01:17:21.951 --> 01:17:24.800
<v Speaker 2>So of all the species we have the widest</v>
<v Speaker 2>flexibility.</v>

1760
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:30.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's that ability to adapt that I </v>

1761
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.160
<v Speaker 2>think is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one of our greatest strengths.</v>

1762
01:17:31.161 --> 01:17:34.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember why I started down my </v>
<v Speaker 2>path of adaptation,</v>

1763
01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:38.840
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that humans can adapt in </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever direction they want.</v>

1764
01:17:39.710 --> 01:17:44.710
<v Speaker 2>I began adapting myself through mindset </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that really showed me how far I was </v>

1765
01:17:45.741 --> 01:17:47.930
<v Speaker 2>able to come mentally from where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>started.</v>

1766
01:17:47.931 --> 01:17:52.040
<v Speaker 2>So as I saw what a huge impact it had on</v>
<v Speaker 2>my life,</v>

1767
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:56.510
<v Speaker 2>both emotionally and financially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm becoming a,</v>

1768
01:17:56.540 --> 01:18:00.200
<v Speaker 2>somebody who is entrepreneurial minded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking extreme ownership for my life.</v>

1769
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm assuming that everything is my </v>
<v Speaker 2>fault,</v>

1770
01:18:02.481 --> 01:18:04.160
<v Speaker 2>that I can always do something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can change something,</v>

1771
01:18:04.161 --> 01:18:05.840
<v Speaker 2>I can get a different result,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can learn a new skill,</v>

1772
01:18:05.841 --> 01:18:10.841
<v Speaker 2>whatever the case may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that I can turn myself into what I </v>

1773
01:18:10.841 --> 01:18:12.410
<v Speaker 2>need to be in order to execute at </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1774
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:17.830
<v Speaker 2>So that changed me so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I've worked in the inner city </v>

1775
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:20.120
<v Speaker 2>so much and seen what happens when </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody really has limiting beliefs and</v>

1776
01:18:20.121 --> 01:18:22.060
<v Speaker 2>how much that holds them back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1777
01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:26.210
<v Speaker 2>so I big brothered for a kid in college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up turning into like an eight year</v>

1778
01:18:26.211 --> 01:18:27.660
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1779
01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:31.580
<v Speaker 2>and so I saw him go through a lot and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember,</v>

1780
01:18:31.581 --> 01:18:36.581
<v Speaker 2>so he grew up in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in south central and then moved to </v>

1781
01:18:36.581 --> 01:18:39.101
<v Speaker 2>compton and I remember taking him to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies and Beverly Hills just because I </v>

1782
01:18:39.101 --> 01:18:42.371
<v Speaker 2>wanted him to see beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the way in which his worldview had </v>

1783
01:18:42.371 --> 01:18:44.900
<v Speaker 2>been constructed was so bizarre and </v>
<v Speaker 2>limiting.</v>

1784
01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's that song by a guy named,</v>

1785
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:53.590
<v Speaker 2>I forget his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he says they don't want to see you </v>

1786
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.590
<v Speaker 2>when Kodak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black,</v>

1787
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:54.410
<v Speaker 2>Kodak black have no idea who that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

1788
01:18:54.411 --> 01:18:59.411
<v Speaker 2>it's a song by a guy named Kodak Black </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he talks about how they don't want </v>

1789
01:18:59.411 --> 01:18:59.420
<v Speaker 2>to see you winning and that was his </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentality,</v>

1790
01:18:59.421 --> 01:19:01.520
<v Speaker 2>like nobody wants to see me get out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ghetto,</v>

1791
01:19:01.521 --> 01:19:01.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1792
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:03.560
<v Speaker 2>Not My own mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>

1793
01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:06.260
<v Speaker 2>So that was his frame of reference was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1794
01:19:06.261 --> 01:19:07.820
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it just wasn't meant for me because</v>

1795
01:19:07.821 --> 01:19:09.830
<v Speaker 2>of where I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>encountered those kids.</v>

1796
01:19:09.831 --> 01:19:11.960
<v Speaker 2>I was telling you about a dad shot to </v>
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>

1797
01:19:11.961 --> 01:19:14.780
<v Speaker 2>sister shot to death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just crazy life.</v>

1798
01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:17.230
<v Speaker 2>And their perspective was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very limited.</v>

1799
01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:20.000
<v Speaker 2>They had no sense of how they're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make something come true.</v>

1800
01:19:20.001 --> 01:19:22.490
<v Speaker 2>So I want to help people develop an </v>
<v Speaker 2>empowering mindset.</v>

1801
01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Disney understood something which is why</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use them as our foil,</v>

1802
01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:30.140
<v Speaker 2>which is every piece of content that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they make feeds into a brand ethos.</v>

1803
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:35.350
<v Speaker 2>So if I say I'm going to go see a Sony </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie or a Warner Brothers movie or a </v>

1804
01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:35.350
<v Speaker 2>paramount movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know nothing about it.</v>

1805
01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:36.920
<v Speaker 2>But if I say I'm going to go see a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Disney movie,</v>

1806
01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:42.100
<v Speaker 2>you already know something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have to have the discipline to </v>

1807
01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:44.651
<v Speaker 2>make sure that everything that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating feeds into that and what would </v>

1808
01:19:44.651 --> 01:19:45.980
<v Speaker 2>that thing you're feeding into be like </v>
<v Speaker 2>escaping the matrix.</v>

1809
01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:50.980
<v Speaker 2>So everything's going to do is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be motivational and some sort of a way </v>

1810
01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:51.080
<v Speaker 2>or inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be firing.</v>

1811
01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:53.030
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be entertainment first and </v>
<v Speaker 2>foremost.</v>

1812
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:56.210
<v Speaker 2>But I'll give you examples of movies I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wish we had created wholesale.</v>

1813
01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish impact theory had made the </v>

1814
01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:01.560
<v Speaker 2>matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the perfect movie in my opinion.</v>

1815
01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:05.800
<v Speaker 2>I wish we'd made star wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole religion of the Jetta is </v>

1816
01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:05.800
<v Speaker 2>wildly empowering and think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1817
01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:08.430
<v Speaker 2>how ridiculous it is to say that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wish you made the two greatest movies of</v>

1818
01:20:08.431 --> 01:20:09.860
<v Speaker 2>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course you do.</v>

1819
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying from a guitar,</v>

1820
01:20:12.810 --> 01:20:14.670
<v Speaker 2>well actually I don't wish we'd made </v>
<v Speaker 2>avatar.</v>

1821
01:20:14.671 --> 01:20:15.780
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1822
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:18.630
<v Speaker 2>honestly I haven't looked at it closely </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to know if it falls into that,</v>

1823
01:20:18.631 --> 01:20:21.280
<v Speaker 2>but I don't remember it having it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's more of like a,</v>

1824
01:20:21.281 --> 01:20:23.460
<v Speaker 2>a nature theme and taking care of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>current theme.</v>

1825
01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:25.650
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I'm looking for empowerment </v>
<v Speaker 2>themes.</v>

1826
01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:29.210
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>empowerment themes in what?</v>

1827
01:20:29.230 --> 01:20:33.480
<v Speaker 2>Like in terms of fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of it is gone be documentaries,</v>

1828
01:20:33.481 --> 01:20:37.290
<v Speaker 2>like what are you going to try to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So mostly as of right now,</v>

1829
01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:38.600
<v Speaker 2>entirely fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1830
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.000
<v Speaker 2>and the idea behind that is the way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans assimilate truly disruptive </v>

1831
01:20:44.371 --> 01:20:49.371
<v Speaker 2>information is through narrative and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've read Joseph Campbell's the power </v>

1832
01:20:49.371 --> 01:20:50.010
<v Speaker 2>of myth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talks a lot about that and the hero's</v>

1833
01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:55.011
<v Speaker 2>journey and so wanting to leverage that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not an accident that I was so </v>

1834
01:20:56.491 --> 01:21:01.491
<v Speaker 2>impacted by the power of myth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Joseph is the one that worked </v>

1835
01:21:01.491 --> 01:21:05.151
<v Speaker 2>with George Lucas on creating star wars </v>
<v Speaker 2>and making sure that real hardcore </v>

1836
01:21:05.151 --> 01:21:08.211
<v Speaker 2>mythology is at the core of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just think that's how we build our </v>

1837
01:21:08.211 --> 01:21:09.060
<v Speaker 2>belief system is how we build our </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology.</v>

1838
01:21:09.061 --> 01:21:10.590
<v Speaker 2>It's how we pass it on to other people.</v>

1839
01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:14.070
<v Speaker 2>And I'm a big believer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't try to change behavior,</v>

1840
01:21:14.071 --> 01:21:16.260
<v Speaker 2>try to leverage it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people are already reading books,</v>

1841
01:21:16.261 --> 01:21:17.520
<v Speaker 2>reading comic books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so on and so forth.</v>

1842
01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:22.550
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird a motivation to not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>make things that are entertaining but </v>

1843
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:27.381
<v Speaker 2>the make things that are entertaining </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you think are going to be </v>

1844
01:21:27.381 --> 01:21:27.780
<v Speaker 2>inspiring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then to use star wars and the Matrix</v>

1845
01:21:27.781 --> 01:21:32.781
<v Speaker 2>is examples like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think those movies really pulled </v>

1846
01:21:32.781 --> 01:21:33.750
<v Speaker 2>people out of anything or just entertain</v>
<v Speaker 2>people because I'd be much more inclined</v>

1847
01:21:33.751 --> 01:21:35.130
<v Speaker 2>to think the latter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1848
01:21:35.131 --> 01:21:37.710
<v Speaker 2>So here's how I look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a filtering mechanism.</v>

1849
01:21:37.711 --> 01:21:40.110
<v Speaker 2>I can't save everybody and not everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>cares.</v>

1850
01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:43.830
<v Speaker 2>So some people are going to respond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some are the matrix changed my life in a</v>

1851
01:21:43.831 --> 01:21:45.670
<v Speaker 2>deep and fundamental way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know the Matrix.</v>

1852
01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:46.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

1853
01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:50.070
<v Speaker 2>How so at the time when I had the fixed </v>
<v Speaker 2>mindset,</v>

1854
01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:51.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm literally right out of college.</v>

1855
01:21:51.690 --> 01:21:54.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm into depths of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a talented filmmaker.</v>

1856
01:21:54.190 --> 01:21:55.630
<v Speaker 2>Now what the hell do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1857
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:57.420
<v Speaker 2>I went to a comic con,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1858
01:21:57.450 --> 01:22:02.450
<v Speaker 2>literally across the street from USC and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were handing out tickets to go see </v>

1859
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:07.230
<v Speaker 2>the matrix at Warner brothers studios.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a very excited.</v>

1860
01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:08.430
<v Speaker 2>Took the ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went that night,</v>

1861
01:22:08.431 --> 01:22:10.440
<v Speaker 2>went in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember the movie?</v>

1862
01:22:10.441 --> 01:22:11.100
<v Speaker 2>Well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1863
01:22:11.101 --> 01:22:11.970
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1864
01:22:11.971 --> 01:22:14.460
<v Speaker 2>So when a agent Smith Goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1865
01:22:14.461 --> 01:22:16.860
<v Speaker 2>officer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your men are already dead.</v>

1866
01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:19.650
<v Speaker 2>And then they cut to up their trinity </v>
<v Speaker 2>jumps,</v>

1867
01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.900
<v Speaker 2>camera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go slow motion and spins around her.</v>

1868
01:22:21.930 --> 01:22:23.760
<v Speaker 2>The entire audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself included,</v>

1869
01:22:23.761 --> 01:22:27.210
<v Speaker 2>yelled because it was just unlike </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything we'd ever seen in a movie.</v>

1870
01:22:27.211 --> 01:22:32.211
<v Speaker 2>It was such a rad experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that primed me for what ends up </v>

1871
01:22:32.581 --> 01:22:36.120
<v Speaker 2>being the perfect metaphor for limiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs.</v>

1872
01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.590
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1873
01:22:37.591 --> 01:22:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Michael Strahan [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

1874
01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:42.620
<v Speaker 2>So Michael Strahan said the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

1875
01:22:42.930 --> 01:22:46.470
<v Speaker 2>the year that he got the award for most </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacks in a single season was,</v>

1876
01:22:46.530 --> 01:22:50.250
<v Speaker 2>was because of the matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally his own words.</v>

1877
01:22:50.250 --> 01:22:53.070
<v Speaker 2>He came on an impact there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I interviewed him asking that question.</v>

1878
01:22:53.071 --> 01:22:54.510
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without a doubt,</v>

1879
01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:57.360
<v Speaker 2>that movie is the reason that I got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>record because he said,</v>

1880
01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:01.230
<v Speaker 2>up until that moment I see morpheus and </v>
<v Speaker 2>neo training and Morphea says,</v>

1881
01:23:01.231 --> 01:23:03.000
<v Speaker 2>do you really think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1882
01:23:03.001 --> 01:23:04.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm faster than you because of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscles?</v>

1883
01:23:04.711 --> 01:23:05.730
<v Speaker 2>You really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is air.</v>

1884
01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:08.410
<v Speaker 2>You're breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And straight hand realized,</v>

1885
01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:13.500
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a belief that I can only get one </v>

1886
01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:13.660
<v Speaker 2>sack per game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why can't I get too?</v>

1887
01:23:13.661 --> 01:23:16.690
<v Speaker 2>Why can't I get three?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said because of that he would get</v>

1888
01:23:16.691 --> 01:23:17.830
<v Speaker 2>a sack and then go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1889
01:23:17.831 --> 01:23:19.540
<v Speaker 2>I can get another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1890
01:23:19.541 --> 01:23:24.541
<v Speaker 2>I realized in that moment that once I </v>
<v Speaker 2>got a second game I would back off </v>

1891
01:23:24.541 --> 01:23:27.280
<v Speaker 2>because I just believed that was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most anyone can do in a game.</v>

1892
01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:32.640
<v Speaker 2>So it had a similar impact me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it made me realize I needed to figure </v>

1893
01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:33.340
<v Speaker 2>out what my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the Matrix,</v>

1894
01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:33.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1895
01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:35.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't actually think we're in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>simulation.</v>

1896
01:23:35.111 --> 01:23:40.111
<v Speaker 2>So what is the Matrix belief system?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is my version of jacking in </v>

1897
01:23:40.111 --> 01:23:43.120
<v Speaker 2>reading?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is my Kung Fu business like?</v>

1898
01:23:43.121 --> 01:23:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Those were all the things that began to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sack.</v>

1899
01:23:44.831 --> 01:23:46.720
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't there while I'm sitting in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie theater,</v>

1900
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:51.870
<v Speaker 2>but those were the things that were in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my mind and I just kept thinking about </v>

1901
01:23:51.870 --> 01:23:51.870
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about it,</v>

1902
01:23:51.870 --> 01:23:52.750
<v Speaker 2>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think in movies,</v>

1903
01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:57.990
<v Speaker 2>so when I give examples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times I give examples from </v>

1904
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.300
<v Speaker 2>movies because they have that impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1905
01:23:58.301 --> 01:24:00.640
<v Speaker 2>the reason that I don't think something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this would work,</v>

1906
01:24:00.641 --> 01:24:03.640
<v Speaker 2>and the reason that I think so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have not responded,</v>

1907
01:24:03.641 --> 01:24:07.120
<v Speaker 2>the way that I responded is nobody is </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowing people to take it seriously.</v>

1908
01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:09.580
<v Speaker 2>So social media I think is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>change that.</v>

1909
01:24:09.610 --> 01:24:12.340
<v Speaker 2>So nobody's allowing people to take it </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>

1910
01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:14.320
<v Speaker 2>Everybody brushes it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just entertainment.</v>

1911
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:18.910
<v Speaker 2>So what do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Joseph Campbell and the power of myth</v>

1912
01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:21.880
<v Speaker 2>talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was asked by Bill Moyer,</v>

1913
01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:24.120
<v Speaker 2>but Maria said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it read it.</v>

1914
01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:25.480
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when he goes,</v>

1915
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:30.510
<v Speaker 2>what do you think happens to a world </v>
<v Speaker 2>where people no longer believe in </v>

1916
01:24:30.510 --> 01:24:31.000
<v Speaker 2>mythology?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Joseph Campbell said,</v>

1917
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:36.030
<v Speaker 2>you're living through it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the point being that you have all </v>

1918
01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:38.260
<v Speaker 2>the mythology in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nobody believes in it anymore.</v>

1919
01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:41.470
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows star wars in the real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows the matrix isn't real,</v>

1920
01:24:41.471 --> 01:24:45.040
<v Speaker 2>but people actually used to believe that</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion was real.</v>

1921
01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:48.670
<v Speaker 2>And so you had this mythological tale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it was you know,</v>

1922
01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Zeus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whether it was Cassandra,</v>

1923
01:24:51.551 --> 01:24:56.551
<v Speaker 2>all the Greek mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it was Jesus Christ didn't </v>

1924
01:24:56.551 --> 01:24:56.560
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People believed it.</v>

1925
01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:58.660
<v Speaker 2>They thought it was real and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>still do.</v>

1926
01:24:58.750 --> 01:25:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would say that that's diminishing </v>

1927
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.750
<v Speaker 2>day over day.</v>

1928
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gotten less.</v>

1929
01:25:03.791 --> 01:25:05.830
<v Speaker 2>Will you give me that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm from,</v>

1930
01:25:05.831 --> 01:25:07.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure ancient times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1931
01:25:07.811 --> 01:25:09.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the current state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>atheism,</v>

1932
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:14.910
<v Speaker 2>agnosticism and deity worship is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine it's probably somewhere </v>

1933
01:25:15.431 --> 01:25:19.930
<v Speaker 2>in the 50 percent range though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't even challenge that.</v>

1934
01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:25.020
<v Speaker 2>I will give you my gut instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Gut instinct is while people are </v>

1935
01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:29.671
<v Speaker 2>still deeply religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't believe in the literal word </v>

1936
01:25:29.671 --> 01:25:29.980
<v Speaker 2>as much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's,</v>

1937
01:25:29.981 --> 01:25:34.981
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's google like what percentage of </v>

1938
01:25:34.981 --> 01:25:38.260
<v Speaker 2>people today consider themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious versus the past?</v>

1939
01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:40.810
<v Speaker 2>So if we get anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if get anything there,</v>

1940
01:25:40.811 --> 01:25:43.600
<v Speaker 2>we have people still cling to it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1941
01:25:43.670 --> 01:25:48.670
<v Speaker 2>it's comforting and because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncertainty of existence and the finite </v>

1942
01:25:48.670 --> 01:25:50.590
<v Speaker 2>nature of our life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1943
01:25:50.650 --> 01:25:55.650
<v Speaker 2>it's very disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That open ended feeling of not knowing </v>

1944
01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:57.190
<v Speaker 2>when it's gonna happen or what's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to happen and having some sort of a calm</v>

1945
01:25:57.191 --> 01:26:00.310
<v Speaker 2>and peaceful belief in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an overlord.</v>

1946
01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:02.240
<v Speaker 2>Like someone was paying attention to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing.</v>

1947
01:26:02.241 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 2>It's got a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll agree</v>

1948
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:08.980
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My thesis isn't that people don't </v>

1949
01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:10.961
<v Speaker 1>believe in something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that they don't believe in the </v>

1950
01:26:10.961 --> 01:26:11.690
<v Speaker 1>literal word as much as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1951
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:13.130
<v Speaker 1>How about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't help me.</v>

1952
01:26:13.490 --> 01:26:17.810
<v Speaker 1>So there are some people out there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The numbers are there.</v>

1953
01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:23.220
<v Speaker 1>What do we get out of here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy affiliated an affiliated rose </v>

1954
01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:26.861
<v Speaker 1>from 2007,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2014 by six point seven percent from </v>

1955
01:26:26.861 --> 01:26:30.970
<v Speaker 1>2014 from 2007 to seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It rose by six percent identified </v>

1956
01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Christian on affiliated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>affiliated.</v>

1957
01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any religion.</v>

1958
01:26:36.711 --> 01:26:37.160
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1959
01:26:37.161 --> 01:26:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Spiritual Christians went from 78 to 70 </v>
<v Speaker 1>time period?</v>

1960
01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Seventy eight percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1961
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:47.420
<v Speaker 1>I think it's American population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The American population of Christians is</v>

1962
01:26:47.421 --> 01:26:51.190
<v Speaker 1>78 percent to 70 whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it dropped eight percent,</v>

1963
01:26:51.191 --> 01:26:56.191
<v Speaker 1>but still a giant number of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you have to say you're a </v>

1964
01:26:56.191 --> 01:26:57.140
<v Speaker 1>believer in God in order to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

1965
01:26:57.500 --> 01:26:58.550
<v Speaker 1>They still maintain that.</v>

1966
01:26:58.550 --> 01:27:00.650
<v Speaker 1>That's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a necessary thing.</v>

1967
01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Like if you are a person running for </v>
<v Speaker 1>president that says,</v>

1968
01:27:03.171 --> 01:27:04.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1969
01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm personally inclined to believe </v>

1970
01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:09.320
<v Speaker 1>that maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1971
01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:12.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's no god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people would go fucking crazy.</v>

1972
01:27:12.411 --> 01:27:16.460
<v Speaker 1>You would never get to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have this fundamental desire,</v>

1973
01:27:16.461 --> 01:27:19.790
<v Speaker 1>even if there's zero proof in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely is zero proof,</v>

1974
01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:24.940
<v Speaker 1>especially when you think about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories in the Bible and some of the </v>

1975
01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:24.940
<v Speaker 1>more preposterous ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1976
01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:26.840
<v Speaker 1>there's no proof that any of those ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>really took place,</v>

1977
01:27:26.841 --> 01:27:27.490
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1978
01:27:27.670 --> 01:27:29.150
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no proof that.</v>

1979
01:27:29.151 --> 01:27:32.300
<v Speaker 1>What was the guy that called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the she bear to kill the children</v>

1980
01:27:32.301 --> 01:27:35.790
<v Speaker 1>that were mocking him for being bald.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a no idea.</v>

1981
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Don't know that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy in the Bible that,</v>

1982
01:27:38.781 --> 01:27:43.781
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these kids were giving them a hard time </v>

1983
01:27:43.781 --> 01:27:43.781
<v Speaker 1>for being bald.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1984
01:27:43.781 --> 01:27:43.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1985
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:48.910
<v Speaker 1>he called upon God to avenge him and God</v>
<v Speaker 1>sent a bear to kill the children that </v>

1986
01:27:49.221 --> 01:27:50.480
<v Speaker 1>were mocking him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1987
01:27:50.481 --> 01:27:52.010
<v Speaker 1>that's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what Eliza.</v>

1988
01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:54.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1989
01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Alyssa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how say that?</v>

1990
01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Alicia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alicia.</v>

1991
01:27:57.370 --> 01:27:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Alicia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1992
01:27:58.751 --> 01:28:01.630
<v Speaker 1>He went up to Bethel as he walked on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>

1993
01:28:01.631 --> 01:28:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Some boys came from the city and mocked </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1994
01:28:05.110 --> 01:28:05.900
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1995
01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:09.880
<v Speaker 1>when they mocked him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God sent a bear.</v>

1996
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:12.700
<v Speaker 1>And the bear fucking killed the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1997
01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Eh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1998
01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:16.930
<v Speaker 1>there's no guessing that didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids.</v>

1999
01:28:17.530 --> 01:28:20.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing that a Godson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a piece of shit that he has,</v>

2000
01:28:20.290 --> 01:28:23.050
<v Speaker 1>sends a bear to kill little children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about the kids?</v>

2001
01:28:23.051 --> 01:28:28.051
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were talking shit about this guy </v>

2002
01:28:28.051 --> 01:28:30.271
<v Speaker 1>being bald.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it was a bear with </v>

2003
01:28:30.271 --> 01:28:31.731
<v Speaker 1>sneaking up on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More likely to know when you're talking </v>

2004
01:28:31.731 --> 01:28:31.731
<v Speaker 1>about your shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make noise.</v>

2005
01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:32.740
<v Speaker 1>The bears realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2006
01:28:32.741 --> 01:28:35.350
<v Speaker 1>he's a high pitched noises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably delicious little kids.</v>

2007
01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:39.760
<v Speaker 1>And then they moved in but still 70 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent men.</v>

2008
01:28:40.090 --> 01:28:44.530
<v Speaker 1>So it's less people believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still that's a giant number.</v>

2009
01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:48.600
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a giant number.</v>

2010
01:28:49.670 --> 01:28:52.950
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a good question.</v>

2011
01:28:52.951 --> 01:28:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Like how many of them actually believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2012
01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.550
<v Speaker 1>and what to what to what extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2013
01:28:57.650 --> 01:28:58.980
<v Speaker 1>And what is it they actually believe.</v>

2014
01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:02.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So something,</v>

2015
01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:05.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my thesis is that something's wrong.</v>

2016
01:29:05.530 --> 01:29:06.570
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't uh,</v>

2017
01:29:06.571 --> 01:29:09.480
<v Speaker 2>an anti religion thing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no beef with religion.</v>

2018
01:29:09.481 --> 01:29:12.660
<v Speaker 2>If it's making people positive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>connecting and doing something great,</v>

2019
01:29:12.661 --> 01:29:15.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm all for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not a religious person.</v>

2020
01:29:16.110 --> 01:29:21.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so maybe I needed this for me to </v>

2021
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:23.970
<v Speaker 2>have something that could give me the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology that I needed a reading.</v>

2022
01:29:23.971 --> 01:29:25.920
<v Speaker 2>The power of myth really changed my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

2023
01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:31.700
<v Speaker 2>I read it and he talks about in the book</v>
<v Speaker 2>how I'm basically one of the things he </v>

2024
01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:37.701
<v Speaker 2>thinks is going wrong with divorce and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason that divorce rates are so </v>

2025
01:29:37.701 --> 01:29:40.551
<v Speaker 2>high is that ritual has really lost its </v>
<v Speaker 2>impact and you don't have these </v>

2026
01:29:40.551 --> 01:29:43.821
<v Speaker 2>demarcation points between childhood and</v>
<v Speaker 2>adulthood or between being single and </v>

2027
01:29:43.821 --> 01:29:44.250
<v Speaker 2>being married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

2028
01:29:44.251 --> 01:29:45.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the day when you were 13,</v>

2029
01:29:45.661 --> 01:29:46.530
<v Speaker 2>they took you out of the woods.</v>

2030
01:29:46.530 --> 01:29:48.990
<v Speaker 2>They literally ripped you from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>clutches of the women,</v>

2031
01:29:48.991 --> 01:29:53.991
<v Speaker 2>took you out at with no anesthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would circumcise you and now you </v>

2032
01:29:53.991 --> 01:29:53.991
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're a man.</v>

2033
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.140
<v Speaker 2>So because there's none of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get arrested adolescence and there's</v>

2034
01:29:58.470 --> 01:30:00.990
<v Speaker 2>sort of a weakening of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2035
01:30:01.290 --> 01:30:06.290
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the import of the religious ceremony as </v>

2036
01:30:06.290 --> 01:30:09.201
<v Speaker 2>far as divorce goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so people aren't taking that </v>

2037
01:30:09.201 --> 01:30:09.201
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2038
01:30:09.201 --> 01:30:10.290
<v Speaker 2>And he talks about ritualistic scarf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vacation and how many,</v>

2039
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:15.310
<v Speaker 2>you knew something had changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people put your body through some </v>

2040
01:30:15.310 --> 01:30:15.780
<v Speaker 2>kind of transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I got married,</v>

2041
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:20.870
<v Speaker 2>I went through a ritualistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>scarification to remind myself that I </v>

2042
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:23.250
<v Speaker 2>was a different man the day before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of a ritualistic scarification</v>

2043
01:30:23.251 --> 01:30:27.960
<v Speaker 2>did you go through a tattoo?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A grandiose way.</v>

2044
01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:31.430
<v Speaker 2>But here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how dare you call it?</v>

2045
01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:32.840
<v Speaker 2>Scarf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vacation.</v>

2046
01:30:33.210 --> 01:30:34.560
<v Speaker 2>That's how I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't,</v>

2047
01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:35.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't do tattoos.</v>

2048
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:40.430
<v Speaker 2>You'll see nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have one tattoo which I did </v>

2049
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.430
<v Speaker 2>specifically for my wedding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never gotten another one.</v>

2050
01:30:40.610 --> 01:30:45.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at the time this isn't the case </v>

2051
01:30:45.610 --> 01:30:47.811
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the time one of my biggest sort </v>

2052
01:30:47.811 --> 01:30:49.731
<v Speaker 2>of realistic fears was needles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was me saying to my wife,</v>

2053
01:30:50.341 --> 01:30:53.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go scar my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm using needles,</v>

2054
01:30:53.401 --> 01:30:57.450
<v Speaker 2>which freak me the fuck out to remind </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>

2055
01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:59.910
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be painful and then be.</v>

2056
01:30:59.911 --> 01:31:04.911
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm glad that it's something that I </v>

2057
01:31:04.911 --> 01:31:06.060
<v Speaker 2>have this active fear of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in doing all of that,</v>

2058
01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:10.470
<v Speaker 2>it really did make the whole wedding </v>
<v Speaker 2>just a bigger deal to me.</v>

2059
01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:15.530
<v Speaker 2>And so that's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think when we're talking about </v>

2060
01:31:15.530 --> 01:31:18.381
<v Speaker 2>Joseph Campbell and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the issues that I think are very real </v>

2061
01:31:18.381 --> 01:31:21.591
<v Speaker 2>about people not experiencing like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>grand event or at least some sort of a </v>

2062
01:31:21.591 --> 01:31:23.760
<v Speaker 2>ritual that gets them to adulthood.</v>

2063
01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:26.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>

2064
01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:31.600
<v Speaker 2>this is a significant issue that we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>with just things being far too easy and </v>

2065
01:31:31.951 --> 01:31:36.510
<v Speaker 2>that there's no real difficult path </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the warrior has to find themselves</v>

2066
01:31:36.511 --> 01:31:37.060
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2067
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:41.340
<v Speaker 2>in myth or in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a person's actual life that they have</v>

2068
01:31:41.341 --> 01:31:44.850
<v Speaker 2>to overcome some very difficult thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now for you,</v>

2069
01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:48.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure some of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we all have difficulties in life,</v>

2070
01:31:48.601 --> 01:31:51.330
<v Speaker 2>but some of the difficulties that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced when you were in film school</v>

2071
01:31:51.331 --> 01:31:53.910
<v Speaker 2>was like this creation of this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2072
01:31:53.911 --> 01:31:57.300
<v Speaker 2>but once you try to create this thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it didn't work out,</v>

2073
01:31:57.301 --> 01:31:58.420
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>

2074
01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 2>don't you have this desire to</v>

2075
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:01.660
<v Speaker 1>go back and try to figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2076
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you have to design like,</v>

2077
01:32:03.011 --> 01:32:04.840
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I see where I fuck this up.</v>

2078
01:32:04.841 --> 01:32:08.110
<v Speaker 1>I try to be like John Wu instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to be like Alfred Hitchcock and I</v>

2079
01:32:08.111 --> 01:32:10.690
<v Speaker 1>see that there's like a way you could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>systematic.</v>

2080
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:13.660
<v Speaker 1>You're obviously a systematic thinker </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're talking about,</v>

2081
01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:15.370
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an organizer,</v>

2082
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:20.550
<v Speaker 1>you have all these quotes in your mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have all these systems that you </v>

2083
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.550
<v Speaker 1>follow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including,</v>

2084
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:24.481
<v Speaker 1>like following,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some of Gary vee social media </v>

2085
01:32:24.481 --> 01:32:24.481
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2086
01:32:24.481 --> 01:32:27.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like your assistant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fall like these are ways to engage </v>

2087
01:32:27.670 --> 01:32:27.670
<v Speaker 1>in success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2088
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:28.180
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2089
01:32:29.150 --> 01:32:32.040
<v Speaker 2>I would feel like that would haunt you a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

2090
01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:34.830
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>

2091
01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:39.150
<v Speaker 2>So since then I have done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have done a low budget feature film.</v>

2092
01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:39.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2093
01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a screenplay that was turned </v>

2094
01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:46.020
<v Speaker 2>into a feature film that was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrifying experience.</v>

2095
01:32:46.050 --> 01:32:51.050
<v Speaker 2>Why was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just because it didn't turn out the way </v>

2096
01:32:51.050 --> 01:32:51.450
<v Speaker 2>that I wanted it to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't executed as written.</v>

2097
01:32:51.451 --> 01:32:51.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2098
01:32:51.781 --> 01:32:54.090
<v Speaker 2>this is the age fighters complaint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2099
01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:56.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've,</v>

2100
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:02.000
<v Speaker 2>I have changed as a person over time to </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'm just now way more interested </v>

2101
01:33:02.911 --> 01:33:06.390
<v Speaker 2>in scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I still have that love for cinema.</v>

2102
01:33:06.391 --> 01:33:09.180
<v Speaker 2>I love storytelling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think story is a,</v>

2103
01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:14.390
<v Speaker 2>it is a way that we assimilate </v>
<v Speaker 2>information like that is when I think </v>

2104
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:18.111
<v Speaker 2>about the things that have painted a </v>
<v Speaker 2>vision for me of what is a man came way </v>

2105
01:33:18.751 --> 01:33:23.700
<v Speaker 2>more for movies and say my own father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and that that is not to downplay like</v>

2106
01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:26.690
<v Speaker 2>having a relationship with somebody that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in proximity with is,</v>

2107
01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:29.130
<v Speaker 2>is ultimately I think it'd be the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful thing.</v>

2108
01:33:29.130 --> 01:33:34.130
<v Speaker 2>It's just not scalable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So looking at how impactful media has </v>

2109
01:33:34.130 --> 01:33:38.931
<v Speaker 2>been for me and for a lot of people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole notion of self signaling </v>

2110
01:33:38.931 --> 01:33:43.820
<v Speaker 2>because at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that I see the company is we're </v>

2111
01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:47.580
<v Speaker 2>a merchandise company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you create the intellectual property.</v>

2112
01:33:47.581 --> 01:33:49.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a out of Disney's </v>
<v Speaker 2>playbook.</v>

2113
01:33:49.441 --> 01:33:53.640
<v Speaker 2>You create the intellectual property in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to create the merchandise and this</v>

2114
01:33:53.650 --> 01:33:55.320
<v Speaker 2>and merchandise that drives a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>revenue.</v>

2115
01:33:55.321 --> 01:34:00.321
<v Speaker 2>Not all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it drives a lot of the revenue and </v>

2116
01:34:00.321 --> 01:34:03.860
<v Speaker 2>in having that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also create this thing called self </v>

2117
01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:08.331
<v Speaker 2>signaling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as I dress a certain way to tell you </v>

2118
01:34:08.331 --> 01:34:08.331
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is how it starts,</v>

2119
01:34:08.331 --> 01:34:10.200
<v Speaker 2>it also tells me even more loudly than </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2120
01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:15.440
<v Speaker 2>So as I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a Batman shirt and I have a </v>

2121
01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:15.440
<v Speaker 2>superman shirt and when I wear those </v>
<v Speaker 2>shirts,</v>

2122
01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:17.940
<v Speaker 2>it reminds me of my tie to that ethos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2123
01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:19.920
<v Speaker 2>So Batman is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have any superpowers,</v>

2124
01:34:19.950 --> 01:34:21.240
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just have to work really,</v>

2125
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:26.270
<v Speaker 2>really hard and you've got to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepared to tap into the dark side to </v>

2126
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:28.260
<v Speaker 2>keep pushing hard enough to avenge what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe is your failing.</v>

2127
01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:32.190
<v Speaker 2>So Superman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a perfect analogy for passion,</v>

2128
01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:37.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a normal guy except when he's in </v>

2129
01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:39.561
<v Speaker 2>the Yellow Sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that gave me a way to think about </v>

2130
01:34:39.561 --> 01:34:40.590
<v Speaker 2>getting in line with my passion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was obsessed with that.</v>

2131
01:34:40.591 --> 01:34:42.450
<v Speaker 2>When I decided to go in and quit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2132
01:34:42.451 --> 01:34:47.451
<v Speaker 2>I'm like Superman and I am out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yellow Sun because I'm not passionate </v>

2133
01:34:47.451 --> 01:34:51.231
<v Speaker 2>about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the only time that I can do things </v>

2134
01:34:51.231 --> 01:34:53.031
<v Speaker 2>that make me feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are extraordinary or when I'm </v>

2135
01:34:53.031 --> 01:34:55.641
<v Speaker 2>really passionate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Matrix obviously is like the core </v>

2136
01:34:55.641 --> 01:34:56.850
<v Speaker 2>metaphor for my entire existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is such a crazy thing to.</v>

2137
01:34:57.700 --> 01:34:59.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So weird thing.</v>

2138
01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:02.810
<v Speaker 2>The Matrix is the wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the core metaphor,</v>

2139
01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:04.280
<v Speaker 2>right guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a metaphor,</v>

2140
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:06.560
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a core metaphor.</v>

2141
01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:11.620
<v Speaker 2>And not to be Joseph Campbell at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't expect him to come out of my </v>

2142
01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:14.861
<v Speaker 2>mouth as many times in this interview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he said if you want to change the </v>

2143
01:35:14.861 --> 01:35:14.861
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to change the metaphor.</v>

2144
01:35:14.861 --> 01:35:19.780
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people have talked a lot about that </v>

2145
01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:19.780
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the world changed in the metaphor of</v>

2146
01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:21.170
<v Speaker 2>the steam engine to the metaphor of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>

2147
01:35:21.390 --> 01:35:22.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that just,</v>

2148
01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:27.370
<v Speaker 2>it changed the way that you thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>about workers that changed what you </v>

2149
01:35:27.370 --> 01:35:28.490
<v Speaker 2>thought about intelligence and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed a lot of things just by shifting</v>

2150
01:35:28.491 --> 01:35:30.620
<v Speaker 2>from one metaphor to the next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2151
01:35:30.621 --> 01:35:35.540
<v Speaker 2>so dealing in the realm of metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving people access points to different</v>

2152
01:35:35.541 --> 01:35:39.080
<v Speaker 2>things through storytelling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which obviously is riding on the back of</v>

2153
01:35:39.081 --> 01:35:42.560
<v Speaker 2>metaphor I think is an incredible access</v>
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>

2154
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:45.140
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something people already do.</v>

2155
01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:50.440
<v Speaker 2>So you're leveraging behavior that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>already there and that was like a </v>

2156
01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:50.510
<v Speaker 2>necessary part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same thing with quest,</v>

2157
01:35:50.511 --> 01:35:55.511
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't ask people to eat less and </v>

2158
01:35:55.511 --> 01:35:57.611
<v Speaker 2>exercise more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been telling them that for 60 </v>

2159
01:35:57.611 --> 01:35:59.501
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it works for a narrow band of </v>

2160
01:35:59.501 --> 01:35:59.501
<v Speaker 2>the population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't work for everybody.</v>

2161
01:35:59.501 --> 01:36:00.920
<v Speaker 2>So finding something that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>already doing,</v>

2162
01:36:00.921 --> 01:36:03.380
<v Speaker 2>people are already watching movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>TV shows,</v>

2163
01:36:03.381 --> 01:36:04.610
<v Speaker 2>playing video games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reading books,</v>

2164
01:36:04.611 --> 01:36:09.611
<v Speaker 2>comic books are already doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're billions and billions of dollar </v>

2165
01:36:09.611 --> 01:36:09.611
<v Speaker 2>industries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2166
01:36:09.611 --> 01:36:12.830
<v Speaker 2>so being able to tap into that leverage </v>
<v Speaker 2>social media now.</v>

2167
01:36:12.831 --> 01:36:15.320
<v Speaker 2>So this is where we first got onto this </v>
<v Speaker 2>part where I was saying,</v>

2168
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:19.190
<v Speaker 2>you're in a position where most people </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't take it seriously.</v>

2169
01:36:19.191 --> 01:36:21.080
<v Speaker 2>They don't try to extract the life </v>
<v Speaker 2>lessons.</v>

2170
01:36:21.081 --> 01:36:25.030
<v Speaker 2>They're not Michael Strahan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't see a movie one time,</v>

2171
01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:30.040
<v Speaker 2>but just didn't show it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just go to see a film to be </v>

2172
01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:30.040
<v Speaker 2>entertained.</v>

2173
01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:31.580
<v Speaker 2>This is a fascinating approach though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to to create films,</v>

2174
01:36:31.581 --> 01:36:34.190
<v Speaker 2>to change the way human beings think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about life,</v>

2175
01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:36.800
<v Speaker 2>but now keep in mind if we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertain first and foremost,</v>

2176
01:36:36.801 --> 01:36:41.801
<v Speaker 2>we've got nothing so people need to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to watch the movies and have no </v>

2177
01:36:41.801 --> 01:36:43.400
<v Speaker 2>idea that there's a message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disney is a perfect example of that.</v>

2178
01:36:43.401 --> 01:36:44.660
<v Speaker 2>Disney is trying to tell you that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2179
01:36:44.661 --> 01:36:47.330
<v Speaker 2>Should always win bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make movies for children.</v>

2180
01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:48.870
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

2181
01:36:48.890 --> 01:36:52.040
<v Speaker 2>it's a different thing like organizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2182
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:57.070
<v Speaker 2>A grand scale to make films for humans </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you think can pull them out of the </v>

2183
01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:58.910
<v Speaker 2>matrix through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think this works for kids,</v>

2184
01:36:58.911 --> 01:37:01.580
<v Speaker 2>but only kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think kids are a little bit more</v>

2185
01:37:01.581 --> 01:37:03.830
<v Speaker 2>pliable and they don't have enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

2186
01:37:03.831 --> 01:37:07.310
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you can show them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show them some things through,</v>

2187
01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:09.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cartoons and things along those lines.</v>

2188
01:37:10.050 --> 01:37:12.170
<v Speaker 2>Set in with them a little bit easier and</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

2189
01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:17.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely possible to send a </v>

2190
01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:17.280
<v Speaker 2>message through a film that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>radiates with people,</v>

2191
01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:21.941
<v Speaker 2>resonates with people because I have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>deep and abiding fear that this is only </v>

2192
01:37:21.941 --> 01:37:21.941
<v Speaker 2>going to work with kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2193
01:37:21.941 --> 01:37:23.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that that's true,</v>

2194
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:24.530
<v Speaker 2>but there's a guide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2195
01:37:24.531 --> 01:37:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Jeffrey Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2196
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:27.470
<v Speaker 2>super cool dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2197
01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:31.160
<v Speaker 2>grows up in Harlem and realizes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do the school system is fucked.</v>

2198
01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Like everyone is just given up on all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>us here in Harlem,</v>

2199
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:37.040
<v Speaker 2>but he's super bright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ends up going to Harvard and says,</v>

2200
01:37:37.041 --> 01:37:42.041
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to become a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go back and change the </v>

2201
01:37:42.041 --> 01:37:43.790
<v Speaker 2>education system and does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goes back and spends,</v>

2202
01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:46.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many years in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>education system and just realizes,</v>

2203
01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:48.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this never gonna work.</v>

2204
01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:50.300
<v Speaker 2>You can't change it from the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are so many.</v>

2205
01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:53.750
<v Speaker 2>Politics is so much entrenched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit like this is going nowhere.</v>

2206
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:58.990
<v Speaker 2>So he leaves and decides that he's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to give up on adults and he's going to </v>

2207
01:38:00.121 --> 01:38:01.560
<v Speaker 2>start with kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2208
01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:06.590
<v Speaker 2>not even that he's going to try to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>women who are about to become pregnant </v>

2209
01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:10.130
<v Speaker 2>and all he wants to do is because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked at what makes a middle class kid </v>

2210
01:38:10.361 --> 01:38:13.590
<v Speaker 2>successful versus an inner city kid who </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes on to not be successful.</v>

2211
01:38:13.591 --> 01:38:17.070
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what he found was it's the number of</v>

2212
01:38:17.071 --> 01:38:19.020
<v Speaker 2>words that a child hears before the age </v>
<v Speaker 2>of five,</v>

2213
01:38:19.021 --> 01:38:21.570
<v Speaker 2>I think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the ratio of positive to negative.</v>

2214
01:38:21.571 --> 01:38:23.100
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your average kid in the middle class,</v>

2215
01:38:23.101 --> 01:38:26.700
<v Speaker 2>here's $5 million words for the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's five 70 percent of positive,</v>

2216
01:38:26.701 --> 01:38:29.310
<v Speaker 2>30 percent of negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas in the inner city kid,</v>

2217
01:38:29.311 --> 01:38:34.311
<v Speaker 2>here's like two or 3 million by the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they are five and the the ratio is </v>

2218
01:38:34.311 --> 01:38:34.311
<v Speaker 2>reversed.</v>

2219
01:38:34.311 --> 01:38:36.360
<v Speaker 2>So it's 30 percent positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 percent negative.</v>

2220
01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:39.300
<v Speaker 2>So we said that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to make my life's mission</v>

2221
01:38:39.330 --> 01:38:42.280
<v Speaker 2>solving that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's an issue.</v>

2222
01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:44.130
<v Speaker 2>That's a gigantic issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Massive.</v>

2223
01:38:44.131 --> 01:38:49.131
<v Speaker 2>And he said what happens is the language</v>
<v Speaker 2>centers in the brain just don't develop </v>

2224
01:38:49.131 --> 01:38:51.921
<v Speaker 2>properly and because of that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>struggle later in life trying to get a </v>

2225
01:38:51.921 --> 01:38:51.921
<v Speaker 2>job because they can't communicate as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

2226
01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he felt like he had just put his </v>

2227
01:38:57.260 --> 01:38:59.571
<v Speaker 2>finger on sort of that baseline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the reason I bring Geoffrey Canada </v>

2228
01:38:59.571 --> 01:39:00.330
<v Speaker 2>up is because he gave up on adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as I'm thinking through this,</v>

2229
01:39:00.331 --> 01:39:01.500
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't executed on this.</v>

2230
01:39:01.501 --> 01:39:02.850
<v Speaker 2>Nobody should be taking me seriously </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

2231
01:39:02.851 --> 01:39:06.120
<v Speaker 2>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've got like this and I'm like,</v>

2232
01:39:06.150 --> 01:39:08.640
<v Speaker 2>everybody told us we were crazy when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>said we're launching a protein bar.</v>

2233
01:39:08.641 --> 01:39:09.400
<v Speaker 2>People like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker,</v>

2234
01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:10.680
<v Speaker 2>you stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>1,600</v>

2235
01:39:10.681 --> 01:39:14.460
<v Speaker 2>protein bars in 2009.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the most crowded space ever.</v>

2236
01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:16.890
<v Speaker 2>One guy actually told us I need another </v>
<v Speaker 2>protein bar.</v>

2237
01:39:16.891 --> 01:39:21.891
<v Speaker 2>Like I needed another hole in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then five years later we're inc </v>

2238
01:39:21.891 --> 01:39:23.890
<v Speaker 2>502nd fastest growing company in North </v>
<v Speaker 2>America grew by 57,000</v>

2239
01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:24.600
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>

2240
01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:26.520
<v Speaker 2>Because we believed that it could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>done right.</v>

2241
01:39:26.521 --> 01:39:31.521
<v Speaker 2>So I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People think you made a good product </v>

2242
01:39:31.521 --> 01:39:32.510
<v Speaker 2>also for enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what they wanted and that's</v>

2243
01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Kinda the same thing with making films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have to make a good product </v>

2244
01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:38.610
<v Speaker 1>that people are going to enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a fascinating thing that you're</v>

2245
01:39:38.730 --> 01:39:43.730
<v Speaker 1>coming to it saying that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change people and take them out of the </v>

2246
01:39:43.730 --> 01:39:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Matrix because you're also saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2247
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:49.080
<v Speaker 1>your like a memorabilia company or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>merchandise merchandise company.</v>

2248
01:39:49.081 --> 01:39:50.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of the same thing,</v>

2249
01:39:50.311 --> 01:39:51.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're,</v>

2250
01:39:51.391 --> 01:39:56.391
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking like objects that go </v>

2251
01:39:56.391 --> 01:39:57.000
<v Speaker 1>along with your films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big part of what.</v>

2252
01:39:57.140 --> 01:39:59.940
<v Speaker 1>So you're planning all this out from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial standpoint,</v>

2253
01:39:59.941 --> 01:40:02.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what about a creative standpoint?</v>

2254
01:40:02.071 --> 01:40:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Like continue to be able to put together</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these ideas,</v>

2255
01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:06.060
<v Speaker 1>like to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2256
01:40:06.061 --> 01:40:07.440
<v Speaker 1>I want to make the new matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2257
01:40:07.441 --> 01:40:12.441
<v Speaker 1>I want to make the new star wars and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to change the world on a drag </v>

2258
01:40:12.441 --> 01:40:14.040
<v Speaker 1>people out of this mundane reality they </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in and show them the power of myth,</v>

2259
01:40:14.250 --> 01:40:16.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2260
01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.670
<v Speaker 2>More.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to show them the power of belief.</v>

2261
01:40:17.671 --> 01:40:19.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're ever going to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>the power of myth.</v>

2262
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:21.300
<v Speaker 2>Why would they see it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could see it?</v>

2263
01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2264
01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:27.660
<v Speaker 2>just not a focus for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want them to take the usable </v>

2265
01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:31.041
<v Speaker 2>mindset and apply it and I think that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>live in an interesting time now where </v>

2266
01:40:31.041 --> 01:40:33.330
<v Speaker 2>social media can comment on the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>

2267
01:40:33.331 --> 01:40:34.470
<v Speaker 2>here's what's extractable from</v>

2268
01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:36.600
<v Speaker 1>so will you try to adjust films </v>
<v Speaker 1>accordingly?</v>

2269
01:40:36.810 --> 01:40:41.810
<v Speaker 1>If someone comes to you with an idea and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a script and they want this project to </v>

2270
01:40:41.810 --> 01:40:45.051
<v Speaker 1>be created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to adjust it accordingly and to </v>

2271
01:40:45.051 --> 01:40:45.780
<v Speaker 1>try to have the highest amount of impact</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like how you going</v>

2272
01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:46.720
<v Speaker 2>do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2273
01:40:46.721 --> 01:40:51.721
<v Speaker 2>So hopefully it will be a beacon to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that really understand the </v>

2274
01:40:51.721 --> 01:40:54.160
<v Speaker 2>mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we laid out a three phase to building</v>

2275
01:40:54.161 --> 01:40:59.161
<v Speaker 2>the studio on the website literally from</v>
<v Speaker 2>day one and phase one is build the </v>

2276
01:40:59.161 --> 01:41:03.241
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're building a community around </v>

2277
01:41:03.241 --> 01:41:03.241
<v Speaker 2>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that come and listen.</v>

2278
01:41:03.241 --> 01:41:03.370
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how you and I connected.</v>

2279
01:41:03.371 --> 01:41:04.870
<v Speaker 2>So one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2280
01:41:04.871 --> 01:41:08.260
<v Speaker 2>one of the people that follows my show </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote to you and said,</v>

2281
01:41:08.261 --> 01:41:13.261
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really got to get this guy in your </v>

2282
01:41:13.261 --> 01:41:13.261
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sent you a clip and you said,</v>

2283
01:41:13.261 --> 01:41:13.261
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is actually pretty interesting.</v>

2284
01:41:13.261 --> 01:41:13.261
<v Speaker 2>You should come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2285
01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:16.510
<v Speaker 2>so that's all around ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2286
01:41:16.511 --> 01:41:20.800
<v Speaker 2>So I've spent the last 20 plus years of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my life constructing my mindset to allow</v>

2287
01:41:20.801 --> 01:41:24.730
<v Speaker 2>me to be successful and because I've had</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain level of success,</v>

2288
01:41:24.731 --> 01:41:25.690
<v Speaker 2>people take me seriously.</v>

2289
01:41:25.690 --> 01:41:30.690
<v Speaker 2>So now what I'm trying to do is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>find the most efficacious way to </v>

2290
01:41:30.690 --> 01:41:32.380
<v Speaker 2>actually get that ideology in people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>

2291
01:41:32.381 --> 01:41:36.280
<v Speaker 2>And I know if I can incept them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertainment,</v>

2292
01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:39.460
<v Speaker 2>I've got a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I can't entertain them first,</v>

2293
01:41:39.461 --> 01:41:44.461
<v Speaker 2>I've got nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we don't have any way to sneak it </v>

2294
01:41:44.461 --> 01:41:44.461
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we don't have good movies,</v>

2295
01:41:44.461 --> 01:41:44.461
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2296
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:49.470
<v Speaker 2>I think this is where you were going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The movies aren't just good in and of </v>

2297
01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:49.470
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're fucked.</v>

2298
01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:54.210
<v Speaker 2>We've got nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have to get really good at making </v>

2299
01:41:54.210 --> 01:41:55.570
<v Speaker 2>really good movies that people want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see for their own sake.</v>

2300
01:41:55.810 --> 01:41:58.450
<v Speaker 2>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a Herculean task.</v>

2301
01:41:58.451 --> 01:42:03.451
<v Speaker 2>No question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're going to have to assemble an </v>

2302
01:42:03.451 --> 01:42:05.020
<v Speaker 2>amazing creative team that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>understands that a very deep level,</v>

2303
01:42:05.021 --> 01:42:06.310
<v Speaker 2>the ideology of the company,</v>

2304
01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:08.980
<v Speaker 1>well in and of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making entertaining films,</v>

2305
01:42:08.981 --> 01:42:11.320
<v Speaker 1>like having a company that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertaining films with difficult,</v>

2306
01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:14.140
<v Speaker 1>brutal make entertaining films that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of life changing</v>

2307
01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:19.140
<v Speaker 2>message don't envy you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like a long task.</v>

2308
01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:21.790
<v Speaker 2>But as like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>

2309
01:42:21.791 --> 01:42:26.791
<v Speaker 2>it can be done if Disney did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And arguably they certainly did with </v>

2310
01:42:26.791 --> 01:42:26.791
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

2311
01:42:26.791 --> 01:42:27.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they've,</v>

2312
01:42:27.110 --> 01:42:30.260
<v Speaker 1>they've made some really powerful movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>with some really good messages.</v>

2313
01:42:31.010 --> 01:42:32.360
<v Speaker 2>No question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no question.</v>

2314
01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:33.770
<v Speaker 2>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a bumpy road.</v>

2315
01:42:33.771 --> 01:42:38.771
<v Speaker 2>I know that there's going to be sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the guaranteed failure and </v>

2316
01:42:38.771 --> 01:42:42.071
<v Speaker 2>hopefully success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's something that I believe in </v>

2317
01:42:42.071 --> 01:42:43.580
<v Speaker 2>enough to fight for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you talk about,</v>

2318
01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:44.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2319
01:42:45.130 --> 01:42:48.620
<v Speaker 2>don't you want to go back and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>make good on the filmmaking promise?</v>

2320
01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:49.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

2321
01:42:49.791 --> 01:42:50.940
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not know what it meant.</v>

2322
01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:54.080
<v Speaker 1>What I meant was not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no promise I just went,</v>

2323
01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:56.910
<v Speaker 1>does it something that you think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

2324
01:42:56.911 --> 01:42:58.860
<v Speaker 1>maybe I could have adjusted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I could have done this,</v>

2325
01:42:59.110 --> 01:43:04.110
<v Speaker 1>if it could have built on my skill set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I could have continued making </v>

2326
01:43:04.110 --> 01:43:05.520
<v Speaker 1>films and tried different approaches and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

2327
01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:08.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had a real passion for and it was</v>

2328
01:43:08.431 --> 01:43:09.860
<v Speaker 1>something that you were so interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2329
01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:14.870
<v Speaker 1>you said you were killing it early on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your film career or in your film school </v>

2330
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:16.170
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a wonder why you didn't continue to</v>

2331
01:43:16.171 --> 01:43:19.090
<v Speaker 1>try to readjust and try to try to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>back as another.</v>

2332
01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise</v>

2333
01:43:19.610 --> 01:43:21.470
<v Speaker 2>that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everyone,</v>

2334
01:43:21.471 --> 01:43:23.110
<v Speaker 2>myself included thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2335
01:43:23.170 --> 01:43:25.640
<v Speaker 2>when we had this success equest and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do whatever I wanted,</v>

2336
01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:29.720
<v Speaker 2>that I would just immediately start </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing and directing and it just didn't</v>

2337
01:43:29.721 --> 01:43:32.650
<v Speaker 2>feel it wasn't what I wanted to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2338
01:43:32.730 --> 01:43:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Well that's an important message in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>of itself because I tell people,</v>

2339
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:36.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2340
01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.790
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow your heart's content and don't be</v>

2341
01:43:38.791 --> 01:43:43.791
<v Speaker 1>trapped in your earliest ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have an idea early on that you </v>

2342
01:43:43.791 --> 01:43:48.471
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to become this and then </v>

2343
01:43:48.471 --> 01:43:50.361
<v Speaker 1>somewhere along the line you discover </v>
<v Speaker 1>this new interest that kind of </v>

2344
01:43:50.361 --> 01:43:50.460
<v Speaker 1>supersedes the other one and surpasses </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2345
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Follow that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2346
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:53.370
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have.</v>

2347
01:43:53.590 --> 01:43:54.320
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2348
01:43:54.321 --> 01:43:56.360
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were a filmmaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a little.</v>

2349
01:43:56.361 --> 01:43:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2350
01:43:57.271 --> 01:43:58.730
<v Speaker 1>like he can do whatever the fuck you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

2351
01:43:58.731 --> 01:44:03.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could find a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>different pathways and a million </v>

2352
01:44:03.731 --> 01:44:06.881
<v Speaker 1>different avenues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately what's going to resonate </v>

2353
01:44:06.881 --> 01:44:09.671
<v Speaker 1>the most with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you're actually </v>

2354
01:44:09.671 --> 01:44:09.671
<v Speaker 1>passionate about and really feel it </v>
<v Speaker 1>really feel not faking it.</v>

2355
01:44:09.671 --> 01:44:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Not trying to establish some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative that you think is going to be </v>

2356
01:44:14.650 --> 01:44:14.960
<v Speaker 1>successful with people resonate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2357
01:44:14.961 --> 01:44:18.560
<v Speaker 1>but what do you actually feel and if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could figure that out,</v>

2358
01:44:18.561 --> 01:44:18.890
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2359
01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:20.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>

2360
01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:23.690
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be like the great pieces </v>
<v Speaker 1>of art.</v>

2361
01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:28.720
<v Speaker 1>The great works that people have created</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the opportunities that I've gotten </v>

2362
01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:30.770
<v Speaker 1>a chance to talk to people that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done some pretty amazing shit.</v>

2363
01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:33.440
<v Speaker 1>It's all they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all like an interest.</v>

2364
01:44:33.441 --> 01:44:38.441
<v Speaker 1>It was all a thought that they had that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they followed through all the way and </v>

2365
01:44:38.441 --> 01:44:39.220
<v Speaker 1>then got immersed in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2366
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:44.350
<v Speaker 1>but it was never thinking about it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of the ultimate eventual result,</v>

2367
01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:46.820
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I think it's interesting that</v>

2368
01:44:46.821 --> 01:44:51.821
<v Speaker 1>you're approaching this and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>just have an idea to make something </v>

2369
01:44:51.821 --> 01:44:54.500
<v Speaker 1>creative and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fascinating and fulfilling to enjoy,</v>

2370
01:44:54.770 --> 01:44:59.770
<v Speaker 1>but you also want to establish some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a narrative that changes the way </v>

2371
01:44:59.770 --> 01:45:01.190
<v Speaker 1>people look at the reality around them.</v>

2372
01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

2373
01:45:03.310 --> 01:45:08.310
<v Speaker 2>And when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I think about what I'm really </v>

2374
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:10.441
<v Speaker 2>driven by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was almost a confession to my </v>

2375
01:45:10.441 --> 01:45:13.801
<v Speaker 2>team was I don't care about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love movies and I love the path that </v>

2376
01:45:14.561 --> 01:45:19.561
<v Speaker 2>we're on right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't love it enough to risk my </v>

2377
01:45:19.561 --> 01:45:20.110
<v Speaker 2>fortune and to work as hard as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>

2378
01:45:20.350 --> 01:45:23.050
<v Speaker 2>That just never would have drawn me </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

2379
01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:28.140
<v Speaker 2>So what I do care enough about to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything at risk and to work as hard </v>

2380
01:45:28.271 --> 01:45:33.220
<v Speaker 2>as I'm working is pulling people out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Matrix and I know those are my words</v>

2381
01:45:33.221 --> 01:45:35.740
<v Speaker 2>that maybe don't get people to see what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean.</v>

2382
01:45:35.741 --> 01:45:38.260
<v Speaker 2>So the kid that I big brothered for her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to give you an idea.</v>

2383
01:45:38.620 --> 01:45:43.620
<v Speaker 2>So his name is rashawn an amazing kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was very disruptive in class.</v>

2384
01:45:43.991 --> 01:45:46.330
<v Speaker 2>He was drug and alcohol impacted but </v>
<v Speaker 2>still really bright,</v>

2385
01:45:46.331 --> 01:45:48.070
<v Speaker 2>but they had them on like Ritalin or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2386
01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:50.380
<v Speaker 2>I honestly don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's done to this gross groceries.</v>

2387
01:45:50.381 --> 01:45:52.710
<v Speaker 2>Really small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hyper aggressive.</v>

2388
01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:57.610
<v Speaker 2>He was adopted and his mother was </v>
<v Speaker 2>abusing him,</v>

2389
01:45:57.611 --> 01:46:01.060
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know that and very sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just too young and I just,</v>

2390
01:46:01.061 --> 01:46:06.061
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though looking back you suddenly </v>

2391
01:46:06.061 --> 01:46:06.061
<v Speaker 2>realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Hell,</v>

2392
01:46:06.061 --> 01:46:06.570
<v Speaker 2>there was so many clues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2393
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:11.790
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't pick up on them and he just</v>
<v Speaker 2>living a life that is,</v>

2394
01:46:12.190 --> 01:46:17.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is horrible and growing up in the inner </v>

2395
01:46:17.190 --> 01:46:21.001
<v Speaker 2>cities as well on top of all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I come and of course he's the </v>

2396
01:46:21.001 --> 01:46:25.861
<v Speaker 2>student they give me and all I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to do is for eight weeks I'm </v>

2397
01:46:25.861 --> 01:46:25.861
<v Speaker 2>just supposed to come in and help him do</v>
<v Speaker 2>his homework.</v>

2398
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:30.990
<v Speaker 2>And so he's very clever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would show up and for an hour he </v>

2399
01:46:30.990 --> 01:46:30.990
<v Speaker 2>would ignore me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would get in fights,</v>

2400
01:46:30.990 --> 01:46:33.700
<v Speaker 2>he would push me away and then like five</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes for,</v>

2401
01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:34.540
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to leave.</v>

2402
01:46:34.540 --> 01:46:37.240
<v Speaker 2>I'd say I have to leave and he would </v>
<v Speaker 2>start crying and freaking out,</v>

2403
01:46:37.241 --> 01:46:37.750
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2404
01:46:37.751 --> 01:46:41.320
<v Speaker 2>just say help me with my homework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so finally I'd be like,</v>

2405
01:46:41.321 --> 01:46:42.250
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to help you,</v>

2406
01:46:42.251 --> 01:46:44.890
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't right now get to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm leaving.</v>

2407
01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:47.470
<v Speaker 2>And so then he would be an angel and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>his homework.</v>

2408
01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:50.760
<v Speaker 2>And then week two was exactly same and </v>
<v Speaker 2>three and four and five,</v>

2409
01:46:51.070 --> 01:46:52.650
<v Speaker 2>I thought this fucking kid is playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

2410
01:46:52.890 --> 01:46:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Like he's like trolling me in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at week six they tell you,</v>

2411
01:46:57.421 --> 01:47:02.421
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>warn them that you're only coming two </v>

2412
01:47:02.421 --> 01:47:02.421
<v Speaker 2>more weeks so that they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>surprised.</v>

2413
01:47:02.421 --> 01:47:02.421
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Week six,</v>

2414
01:47:02.421 --> 01:47:02.421
<v Speaker 2>I tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2415
01:47:02.421 --> 01:47:07.161
<v Speaker 2>just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm only coming two more times and he </v>

2416
01:47:07.161 --> 01:47:07.161
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear freaks the fuck out.</v>

2417
01:47:07.161 --> 01:47:10.020
<v Speaker 2>Like it was so shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't have experience with kids.</v>

2418
01:47:10.021 --> 01:47:14.010
<v Speaker 2>So he's flipping out and this was </v>
<v Speaker 2>already a kid with behavioral problems.</v>

2419
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:15.840
<v Speaker 2>So I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck is going on.</v>

2420
01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:18.300
<v Speaker 2>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slowly,</v>

2421
01:47:18.301 --> 01:47:19.920
<v Speaker 2>all too slowly I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2422
01:47:19.921 --> 01:47:24.921
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this because I just told you I'm </v>

2423
01:47:24.921 --> 01:47:24.921
<v Speaker 2>leaving?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

2424
01:47:24.921 --> 01:47:24.921
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

2425
01:47:24.921 --> 01:47:28.350
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>largely just to calm him down as long as</v>

2426
01:47:28.351 --> 01:47:31.470
<v Speaker 2>I live in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will help you do your homework,</v>

2427
01:47:31.890 --> 01:47:34.110
<v Speaker 2>but you have to do it the second I get </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

2428
01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:36.180
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said deal.</v>

2429
01:47:36.270 --> 01:47:41.270
<v Speaker 2>So that turns into an eight year </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship where it became way more </v>

2430
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:45.381
<v Speaker 2>than helping him with his homework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started taking him to movies and </v>

2431
01:47:45.381 --> 01:47:45.810
<v Speaker 2>trying to show them just a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>side of life.</v>

2432
01:47:45.811 --> 01:47:48.820
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took him on the saint called Troy camp.</v>

2433
01:47:48.821 --> 01:47:52.800
<v Speaker 2>So we got to see the mountains for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first time and just all like really,</v>

2434
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:56.630
<v Speaker 2>really getting involved in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when his,</v>

2435
01:47:56.850 --> 01:48:01.850
<v Speaker 2>it finally came out that his stepmother </v>
<v Speaker 2>or his adoptive mother was beating him </v>

2436
01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:05.700
<v Speaker 2>from what I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was chasing him down the street with</v>

2437
01:48:05.701 --> 01:48:10.701
<v Speaker 2>a baseball bat and I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally couldn't believe that was </v>

2438
01:48:10.701 --> 01:48:10.701
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

2439
01:48:10.701 --> 01:48:14.030
<v Speaker 2>And so they took them away immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was the first phone call and his </v>

2440
01:48:15.031 --> 01:48:18.840
<v Speaker 2>lawyer called me and said he has asked </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you be the ward of the court or the</v>

2441
01:48:18.841 --> 01:48:20.850
<v Speaker 2>Guardian to help them through the court </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

2442
01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:24.480
<v Speaker 2>And so I helped them do that and help </v>
<v Speaker 2>them get into foster care.</v>

2443
01:48:24.481 --> 01:48:27.630
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just looking at him going,</v>

2444
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:32.750
<v Speaker 2>I know where this ends up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I know where this ends up and it </v>

2445
01:48:32.750 --> 01:48:33.900
<v Speaker 2>isn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was the seed,</v>

2446
01:48:33.901 --> 01:48:38.901
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think that I'm going to </v>

2447
01:48:38.901 --> 01:48:38.901
<v Speaker 2>dedicate my life to helping people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this wasn't that,</v>

2448
01:48:38.901 --> 01:48:40.020
<v Speaker 2>but it planted a seed and it really </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked with me.</v>

2449
01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:43.590
<v Speaker 2>And I stayed involved with him in foster</v>
<v Speaker 2>care for a couple of years.</v>

2450
01:48:43.591 --> 01:48:45.870
<v Speaker 2>But then they just moved them so far </v>
<v Speaker 2>away that it was.</v>

2451
01:48:45.871 --> 01:48:48.270
<v Speaker 2>I was broke at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just was too far away.</v>

2452
01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:53.720
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that stayed with me and then when I </v>

2453
01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:53.720
<v Speaker 2>started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2454
01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:56.580
<v Speaker 2>at quest and we were helping all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids are working with all these kids and</v>

2455
01:48:56.581 --> 01:49:00.000
<v Speaker 2>I saw how extraordinary they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which by the way drug dealers,</v>

2456
01:49:00.150 --> 01:49:05.150
<v Speaker 2>some of them are amazing entrepreneurs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it became this notion of my,</v>

2457
01:49:05.610 --> 01:49:06.420
<v Speaker 2>it's unreal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2458
01:49:06.421 --> 01:49:08.130
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you some stories sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2459
01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:10.230
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

2460
01:49:10.231 --> 01:49:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a better entrepreneur than I am.</v>

2461
01:49:12.001 --> 01:49:17.001
<v Speaker 2>Like they're telling me how they watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the cop cars and when they change </v>

2462
01:49:17.001 --> 01:49:18.270
<v Speaker 2>shifts and how they know that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>being identified by their cars.</v>

2463
01:49:18.271 --> 01:49:21.210
<v Speaker 2>And so they changed cars all the time as</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

2464
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:22.620
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

2465
01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:27.800
<v Speaker 2>it gave me this concept that I called </v>
<v Speaker 2>mining for astronauts and I'm like in </v>

2466
01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:27.900
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in here,</v>

2467
01:49:27.901 --> 01:49:32.901
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in here being the ghetto are </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the most amazing minds I've ever</v>

2468
01:49:33.331 --> 01:49:33.990
<v Speaker 2>come across.</v>

2469
01:49:34.110 --> 01:49:36.270
<v Speaker 2>And these guys could be anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be fucking astronauts,</v>

2470
01:49:36.271 --> 01:49:37.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like whatever they wanted,</v>

2471
01:49:38.070 --> 01:49:43.070
<v Speaker 2>but they don't believe they can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I would interview them it was </v>

2472
01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:43.590
<v Speaker 2>nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine you're interviewing.</v>

2473
01:49:43.591 --> 01:49:48.591
<v Speaker 2>And I came up with just like a fast </v>
<v Speaker 2>weighted where I didn't have to think I </v>

2474
01:49:48.591 --> 01:49:51.891
<v Speaker 2>could ask the same questions and one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the questions was a magic genie shows </v>

2475
01:49:51.891 --> 01:49:51.970
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to grant you one wish and one</v>

2476
01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:53.920
<v Speaker 2>which only you can't wish for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More wishes.</v>

2477
01:49:53.921 --> 01:49:55.770
<v Speaker 2>You can't cure cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bring anybody from back in the desk.</v>

2478
01:49:55.771 --> 01:50:00.771
<v Speaker 2>I'd be something for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you wish for universally to a </v>

2479
01:50:00.771 --> 01:50:00.771
<v Speaker 2>person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all said a job.</v>

2480
01:50:00.771 --> 01:50:01.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

2481
01:50:01.810 --> 01:50:04.360
<v Speaker 2>You think that's what I want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're trying to get a job so you can</v>

2482
01:50:04.361 --> 01:50:06.960
<v Speaker 2>tell him you want a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when we get past that bullshit,</v>

2483
01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.950
<v Speaker 2>and I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously that's not true.</v>

2484
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:10.930
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you really want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the job?</v>

2485
01:50:10.931 --> 01:50:11.980
<v Speaker 2>And to get you money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2486
01:50:12.190 --> 01:50:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Do you want money or is it something </v>
<v Speaker 2>else?</v>

2487
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.620
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's money.</v>

2488
01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Awesome man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a magic genie can ask for whatever </v>

2489
01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:19.680
<v Speaker 2>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you want?</v>

2490
01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:22.860
<v Speaker 2>You know what answer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every single one of them gave me </v>

2491
01:50:22.860 --> 01:50:26.070
<v Speaker 2>$1,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can buy a fucking house for a </v>

2492
01:50:26.070 --> 01:50:26.070
<v Speaker 2>million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>K,</v>

2493
01:50:26.070 --> 01:50:27.940
<v Speaker 2>it was so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a magic genie,</v>

2494
01:50:27.941 --> 01:50:30.190
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can ask for a trillion dollars,</v>

2495
01:50:31.570 --> 01:50:33.100
<v Speaker 2>but their frame of reference is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>small.</v>

2496
01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:38.160
<v Speaker 2>One guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was like the one exception said he </v>

2497
01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:38.160
<v Speaker 2>wanted an airport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found that so weird,</v>

2498
01:50:38.290 --> 01:50:39.550
<v Speaker 2>so I had to push on that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2499
01:50:39.551 --> 01:50:40.720
<v Speaker 2>why an airport?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2500
01:50:40.721 --> 01:50:42.550
<v Speaker 2>because business guys come through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>airport,</v>

2501
01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:44.110
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2502
01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:47.200
<v Speaker 2>what good does that do you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

2503
01:50:47.201 --> 01:50:48.730
<v Speaker 2>because then they can teach me about </v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

2504
01:50:49.220 --> 01:50:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Nothing about that for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How fucking many steps removed are you </v>

2505
01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:55.420
<v Speaker 2>from what you actually want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's like they.</v>

2506
01:50:55.470 --> 01:50:57.970
<v Speaker 2>They don't have you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a systematic thinker,</v>

2507
01:50:57.971 --> 01:51:00.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had to learn that.</v>

2508
01:51:00.401 --> 01:51:05.401
<v Speaker 2>That's not where I started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I spent thankfully one of the things </v>

2509
01:51:05.401 --> 01:51:07.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm most grateful for in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to learn everything the hard way,</v>

2510
01:51:07.330 --> 01:51:08.830
<v Speaker 2>but because I learned things the hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

2511
01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:12.850
<v Speaker 2>then I can show other people what I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I fell down and how hopefully they</v>

2512
01:51:12.851 --> 01:51:14.050
<v Speaker 2>can avoid some of the mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2513
01:51:14.051 --> 01:51:15.610
<v Speaker 2>most people ignore me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all aware of that,</v>

2514
01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:18.970
<v Speaker 2>but their desire to teach people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what's interesting.</v>

2515
01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:21.640
<v Speaker 2>You're not just internalizing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not just yourself.</v>

2516
01:51:21.970 --> 01:51:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2517
01:51:24.190 --> 01:51:25.390
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm wired for compassion.</v>

2518
01:51:25.690 --> 01:51:28.700
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoy other people succeeding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2519
01:51:28.900 --> 01:51:33.900
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my favorite example of that is when I </v>

2520
01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:33.900
<v Speaker 2>was five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my sister would have been eight and a</v>

2521
01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:34.420
<v Speaker 2>half.</v>

2522
01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:40.350
<v Speaker 2>I pretended not to see some Easter eggs </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that she would win the Easter egg </v>

2523
01:51:40.350 --> 01:51:41.320
<v Speaker 2>hunt because she cared about winning and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

2524
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:45.760
<v Speaker 2>So that's just a natural inclination </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I have,</v>

2525
01:51:45.761 --> 01:51:47.950
<v Speaker 2>that I've fed into that I've chosen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take pride in.</v>

2526
01:51:48.130 --> 01:51:49.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and because of that,</v>

2527
01:51:49.581 --> 01:51:51.790
<v Speaker 2>and look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be a way cooler story if I said</v>

2528
01:51:51.791 --> 01:51:56.791
<v Speaker 2>I met this kid rashawn and it changed my</v>
<v Speaker 2>life forever and I knew I had to </v>

2529
01:51:56.791 --> 01:51:56.791
<v Speaker 2>dedicate myself to helping people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't.</v>

2530
01:51:56.791 --> 01:51:58.420
<v Speaker 2>I met Rashawn and then spent almost a </v>
<v Speaker 2>decade chasing money.</v>

2531
01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:00.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the truth.</v>

2532
01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:02.020
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in that process,</v>

2533
01:52:02.021 --> 01:52:07.021
<v Speaker 2>like that way that I felt in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>moments where I had hoped that he would </v>

2534
01:52:07.021 --> 01:52:10.861
<v Speaker 2>do something when I met the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're working on the production </v>

2535
01:52:10.861 --> 01:52:10.861
<v Speaker 2>line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I could see,</v>

2536
01:52:10.861 --> 01:52:14.791
<v Speaker 2>fuck I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them literally came to me is </v>

2537
01:52:14.791 --> 01:52:14.791
<v Speaker 2>absolutely hysterical.</v>

2538
01:52:14.791 --> 01:52:17.110
<v Speaker 2>He's in tears and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2539
01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:22.560
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like my fa and stopped himself </v>

2540
01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:23.680
<v Speaker 2>and I thought obviously he was about to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say you like my father,</v>

2541
01:52:23.681 --> 01:52:25.180
<v Speaker 2>but that felt weird for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he stopped and said,</v>

2542
01:52:25.181 --> 01:52:26.770
<v Speaker 2>do you like my older brother?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

2543
01:52:26.771 --> 01:52:30.310
<v Speaker 2>I've just never had anybody that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually cared about me.</v>

2544
01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:35.580
<v Speaker 2>So now mix that with the fact that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>only interested in scale and maybe I </v>

2545
01:52:36.311 --> 01:52:41.311
<v Speaker 2>would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that mean doing touching 10 people </v>

2546
01:52:41.311 --> 01:52:41.890
<v Speaker 2>and like having 10 people show up at my </v>
<v Speaker 2>funeral and just be like,</v>

2547
01:52:41.891 --> 01:52:46.891
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because of him like my 18 and all </v>

2548
01:52:46.891 --> 01:52:50.411
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're going to have a better </v>

2549
01:52:50.411 --> 01:52:50.411
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That just doesn't do it for me.</v>

2550
01:52:50.411 --> 01:52:53.440
<v Speaker 2>And I'm being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe maybe I am a worse person because </v>

2551
01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:53.440
<v Speaker 2>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I honestly don't care.</v>

2552
01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:53.440
<v Speaker 2>It's just true to who I am.</v>

2553
01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:55.400
<v Speaker 2>So scale is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having.</v>

2554
01:52:55.490 --> 01:53:00.490
<v Speaker 2>I would much rather touch a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and none of them know who I am </v>

2555
01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:06.880
<v Speaker 2>and know that a million people's lives </v>
<v Speaker 2>are better off than touched 10 and they </v>

2556
01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:06.980
<v Speaker 2>credited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately,</v>

2557
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:09.560
<v Speaker 2>it's just way more interesting to me at </v>
<v Speaker 2>scale.</v>

2558
01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:13.400
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also believe that a five o one c,</v>

2559
01:53:13.401 --> 01:53:17.870
<v Speaker 2>three nonprofit is like the worst way in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world to do something.</v>

2560
01:53:17.871 --> 01:53:22.871
<v Speaker 2>If you're trying to do good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finding a way to do it through commerce </v>

2561
01:53:22.871 --> 01:53:22.871
<v Speaker 2>where it's a self sustaining economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>engine.</v>

2562
01:53:22.871 --> 01:53:25.070
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that like this is so weird to me.</v>

2563
01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:27.560
<v Speaker 2>If you have a nonprofit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go beg,</v>

2564
01:53:27.710 --> 01:53:32.710
<v Speaker 2>literally beg money from people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a for profit company that have </v>

2565
01:53:32.710 --> 01:53:33.440
<v Speaker 2>figured out how to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They probably have a little bit of guilt</v>

2566
01:53:33.441 --> 01:53:36.650
<v Speaker 2>so they want to give money to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the weirdest dynamic ever.</v>

2567
01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Rather than just building a company that</v>
<v Speaker 2>at its core is trying to do something </v>

2568
01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:41.900
<v Speaker 2>good and awesome that you can be proud </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

2569
01:53:41.930 --> 01:53:43.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking pr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I crash and burn,</v>

2570
01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:46.640
<v Speaker 2>I'll still be proud of what I was trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to accomplish.</v>

2571
01:53:46.641 --> 01:53:51.641
<v Speaker 2>I believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me feel good to want to do </v>

2572
01:53:51.641 --> 01:53:54.461
<v Speaker 2>amazing shit for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually believe that this is the way </v>

2573
01:53:54.461 --> 01:53:58.601
<v Speaker 2>that you give somebody a belief system </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is antagonistic to acquiring a new </v>

2574
01:53:58.601 --> 01:54:00.980
<v Speaker 2>belief system because to do it at scale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't want it.</v>

2575
01:54:01.310 --> 01:54:02.290
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people,</v>

2576
01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:04.850
<v Speaker 2>the people that want to change their </v>
<v Speaker 2>physique,</v>

2577
01:54:04.910 --> 01:54:09.910
<v Speaker 2>do they eat right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They exercise and they get results and </v>

2578
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:14.411
<v Speaker 2>the people that don't and there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that I love very much in my life </v>

2579
01:54:14.411 --> 01:54:15.800
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to lose them too early </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't want to eat better.</v>

2580
01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:19.160
<v Speaker 2>So the only solution I could think of </v>
<v Speaker 2>was there was no option.</v>

2581
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:23.030
<v Speaker 2>Everything is healthy and delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so all the things that you want to eat,</v>

2582
01:54:23.031 --> 01:54:25.970
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was the mission at certainly</v>

2583
01:54:25.971 --> 01:54:27.770
<v Speaker 2>while I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the mission of quest.</v>

2584
01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:32.820
<v Speaker 2>We're going to find one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like 26 categories that we </v>

2585
01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:33.800
<v Speaker 2>thought got people into trouble and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to make a healthy version of</v>

2586
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:35.150
<v Speaker 2>each and every one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers,</v>

2587
01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:38.840
<v Speaker 2>and that was the mission so that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>would literally be nowhere for people to</v>

2588
01:54:38.841 --> 01:54:43.841
<v Speaker 2>go to eat badly because they could just </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursue their most base instincts of just</v>

2589
01:54:43.911 --> 01:54:46.250
<v Speaker 2>gluttonous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me carbs,</v>

2590
01:54:46.251 --> 01:54:47.150
<v Speaker 2>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>salt,</v>

2591
01:54:47.151 --> 01:54:50.540
<v Speaker 2>I want to all fat and that they'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating a healthy version,</v>

2592
01:54:50.541 --> 01:54:55.541
<v Speaker 2>but it felt and tasted just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our first marketing message was stop </v>

2593
01:54:55.541 --> 01:54:55.900
<v Speaker 2>compromising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it.</v>

2594
01:54:56.060 --> 01:55:01.060
<v Speaker 2>That's a long way of saying it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>about leveraging people's behavior </v>

2595
01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:01.060
<v Speaker 2>against them to get them to make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right changes.</v>

2596
01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:03.080
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that the way that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do this,</v>

2597
01:55:03.081 --> 01:55:08.081
<v Speaker 2>we live in a unique time where I can go </v>
<v Speaker 2>and fucking microphones like this and I </v>

2598
01:55:08.081 --> 01:55:08.180
<v Speaker 2>can explain to people how to build a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mindset.</v>

2599
01:55:08.181 --> 01:55:13.181
<v Speaker 2>I do this literally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put out probably six or seven hours </v>

2600
01:55:13.181 --> 01:55:14.570
<v Speaker 2>worth of content every fucking week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2601
01:55:14.610 --> 01:55:16.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm just telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2602
01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:21.320
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really the day you're ready to come on </v>

2603
01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:21.320
<v Speaker 2>my show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Raw,</v>

2604
01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:22.430
<v Speaker 2>which people have been begging for for </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

2605
01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:24.020
<v Speaker 2>What's your show impact theory.</v>

2606
01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:31.240
<v Speaker 2>What does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So impact theory is me bringing on </v>

2607
01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:34.991
<v Speaker 2>people like you that have had just </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable success and finding out </v>

2608
01:55:34.991 --> 01:55:34.991
<v Speaker 2>what are the things that you did to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2609
01:55:34.991 --> 01:55:39.910
<v Speaker 2>So my interview style is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll know more about you than your own </v>

2610
01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:39.910
<v Speaker 2>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll show up,</v>

2611
01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:44.351
<v Speaker 2>you'll get a little unnerved because how</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck did I figure all this stuff </v>

2612
01:55:44.351 --> 01:55:47.231
<v Speaker 2>out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then we can have a really cool </v>

2613
01:55:47.231 --> 01:55:47.231
<v Speaker 2>interview because where ever you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

2614
01:55:47.231 --> 01:55:48.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be able to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a journalist.</v>

2615
01:55:48.421 --> 01:55:50.670
<v Speaker 2>I want you to shine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you have literally inspired me.</v>

2616
01:55:50.671 --> 01:55:53.880
<v Speaker 2>By the way I told you a little bit about</v>
<v Speaker 2>why when we first started talking.</v>

2617
01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:54.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2618
01:55:55.380 --> 01:55:58.320
<v Speaker 2>you're the only person that makes me </v>
<v Speaker 2>sweat from diversity cakes.</v>

2619
01:55:58.350 --> 01:56:00.240
<v Speaker 2>I fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like my thing is an interviewer,</v>

2620
01:56:00.241 --> 01:56:01.260
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can go,</v>

2621
01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:02.610
<v Speaker 2>I can interview anybody.</v>

2622
01:56:02.610 --> 01:56:07.610
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I saw your fucking show and I </v>

2623
01:56:07.610 --> 01:56:09.640
<v Speaker 2>realized I can't interview a porn star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2624
01:56:09.690 --> 01:56:11.880
<v Speaker 2>I probably would suck with Hannibal </v>
<v Speaker 2>buress.</v>

2625
01:56:11.881 --> 01:56:16.881
<v Speaker 2>Somebody who's just fucking funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It needs somebody to go back and forth </v>

2626
01:56:16.881 --> 01:56:19.791
<v Speaker 2>with and I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fucking Joe can do dominic </v>

2627
01:56:19.791 --> 01:56:22.851
<v Speaker 2>d'agostino like on one day and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately turn around and do like porn</v>

2628
01:56:23.431 --> 01:56:28.431
<v Speaker 2>joke anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so would love to bring on people like </v>

2629
01:56:28.431 --> 01:56:30.240
<v Speaker 2>you come on because what it all started </v>
<v Speaker 2>back at quest,</v>

2630
01:56:30.630 --> 01:56:35.630
<v Speaker 2>I have this 25 point bullet belief </v>
<v Speaker 2>system that I wanted everyone in the </v>

2631
01:56:36.181 --> 01:56:38.640
<v Speaker 2>company to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be an employee.</v>

2632
01:56:38.641 --> 01:56:43.620
<v Speaker 2>I had an employee's mentality and here </v>
<v Speaker 2>are the 25 things I had to do to my mind</v>

2633
01:56:43.710 --> 01:56:46.500
<v Speaker 2>to become an entrepreneur and generate </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealth in my life and feel like I was in</v>

2634
01:56:46.501 --> 01:56:48.450
<v Speaker 2>control of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody else control my destiny,</v>

2635
01:56:48.451 --> 01:56:50.060
<v Speaker 2>but me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here are the 25 things.</v>

2636
01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:55.080
<v Speaker 2>I had this unending fear that people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to memorize the fucking bullet </v>

2637
01:56:55.080 --> 01:56:56.310
<v Speaker 2>points and they wouldn't live them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wanted to create a show where they.</v>

2638
01:56:56.340 --> 01:57:01.340
<v Speaker 2>Because it's hardest to impact those </v>
<v Speaker 2>closest to you don't know if you've </v>

2639
01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:01.340
<v Speaker 2>experienced that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly have.</v>

2640
01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:03.790
<v Speaker 2>So would say so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2641
01:57:04.180 --> 01:57:07.920
<v Speaker 2>So those that are closest to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it hardest?</v>

2642
01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:13.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it's because there's too much </v>
<v Speaker 2>familiarity.</v>

2643
01:57:13.620 --> 01:57:17.430
<v Speaker 2>My mom looks impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you mean in a way like inspired them?</v>

2644
01:57:17.431 --> 01:57:18.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2645
01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:21.600
<v Speaker 2>But not even through your own success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think that it inspires me.</v>

2646
01:57:21.601 --> 01:57:24.930
<v Speaker 2>Like my mom is finally starting to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like,</v>

2647
01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:27.060
<v Speaker 2>tell me a little bit more about </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

2648
01:57:27.930 --> 01:57:30.440
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a little bit.</v>

2649
01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:32.730
<v Speaker 2>But is that impacting her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She just curious?</v>

2650
01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:35.160
<v Speaker 2>Not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's asking it in the way that like,</v>

2651
01:57:35.161 --> 01:57:40.161
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually interested in making that </v>

2652
01:57:40.161 --> 01:57:41.721
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll just speak for myself in my </v>

2653
01:57:41.721 --> 01:57:41.730
<v Speaker 2>life for whatever inadequacy that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

2654
01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:43.710
<v Speaker 2>It's been very hard for me to impact </v>
<v Speaker 2>those closest to me.</v>

2655
01:57:43.711 --> 01:57:48.711
<v Speaker 2>So what I wanted to do at quest was </v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing in people that were wildly </v>

2656
01:57:48.871 --> 01:57:53.871
<v Speaker 2>successful and I want unprompted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted the audience to see.</v>

2657
01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:56.160
<v Speaker 2>You're going to hear them say the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing as I say,</v>

2658
01:57:56.190 --> 01:58:01.190
<v Speaker 2>even though we don't know each other and</v>
<v Speaker 2>time after time after time they heard </v>

2659
01:58:01.501 --> 01:58:02.130
<v Speaker 2>people going through.</v>

2660
01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:04.020
<v Speaker 2>These people have never seen the 25 </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullet points,</v>

2661
01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:06.870
<v Speaker 2>but they would go through like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe it was like six or seven of</v>

2662
01:58:06.871 --> 01:58:08.250
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be exactly the same,</v>

2663
01:58:08.490 --> 01:58:13.490
<v Speaker 2>but they would touch on so many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking freaky and so that really</v>

2664
01:58:14.281 --> 01:58:15.480
<v Speaker 2>started to play into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2665
01:58:15.481 --> 01:58:20.481
<v Speaker 2>we're now moving into a different era </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can step forward and I think </v>

2666
01:58:20.481 --> 01:58:22.900
<v Speaker 2>transparency and authenticity are a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking deal in,</v>

2667
01:58:22.901 --> 01:58:26.040
<v Speaker 2>in companies today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that Gen z is going to demand it</v>

2668
01:58:26.041 --> 01:58:29.010
<v Speaker 2>and I think any company that hides Gen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gen z,</v>

2669
01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Gen z,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a z generation Z.</v>

2670
01:58:32.180 --> 01:58:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you not heard that?</v>

2671
01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:34.620
<v Speaker 2>No Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome.</v>

2672
01:58:34.621 --> 01:58:38.430
<v Speaker 2>You're going to hear it everywhere now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is that the new lending that the kids</v>

2673
01:58:38.431 --> 01:58:40.170
<v Speaker 2>are saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Kids coming up?</v>

2674
01:58:40.171 --> 01:58:42.030
<v Speaker 2>Generation z?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2675
01:58:43.350 --> 01:58:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you type in Gen z,</v>

2676
01:58:44.261 --> 01:58:49.261
<v Speaker 2>you get like a bazillion sure results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Gen z ears are known for like they,</v>

2677
01:58:51.011 --> 01:58:56.011
<v Speaker 2>they say that they're the altruistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation so these people are not </v>

2678
01:58:56.011 --> 01:59:00.571
<v Speaker 2>comfortable with big business and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that they're going to demand a </v>

2679
01:59:00.571 --> 01:59:04.561
<v Speaker 2>level of transparency into the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are running the company and the </v>

2680
01:59:04.561 --> 01:59:05.290
<v Speaker 2>people that get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elan Musk,</v>

2681
01:59:07.630 --> 01:59:10.030
<v Speaker 2>Richard Branson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that aren't afraid to like really</v>

2682
01:59:10.031 --> 01:59:13.390
<v Speaker 2>step out front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then people just resonate with that.</v>

2683
01:59:13.630 --> 01:59:17.500
<v Speaker 2>And so that is why I do all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm stepping out front.</v>

2684
01:59:17.501 --> 01:59:19.630
<v Speaker 2>That's why I want people to know who I </v>
<v Speaker 2>am and what I'm doing.</v>

2685
01:59:19.810 --> 01:59:24.810
<v Speaker 2>I need to build a community if we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to pull off this mission </v>

2686
01:59:24.810 --> 01:59:24.810
<v Speaker 2>impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2687
01:59:24.810 --> 01:59:24.880
<v Speaker 2>building the studio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all gotta happen.</v>

2688
01:59:24.881 --> 01:59:25.890
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2689
01:59:25.990 --> 01:59:30.990
<v Speaker 2>that's why I create all this content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I bring people on that have </v>

2690
01:59:30.990 --> 01:59:30.990
<v Speaker 2>inspired me and my goal is just to set </v>
<v Speaker 2>them up.</v>

2691
01:59:30.990 --> 01:59:34.810
<v Speaker 2>So I want everyone to walk away from my </v>
<v Speaker 2>show going like off camera,</v>

2692
01:59:34.811 --> 01:59:39.811
<v Speaker 2>behind the scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that was the best interview I've </v>

2693
01:59:39.811 --> 01:59:39.811
<v Speaker 2>ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2694
01:59:39.811 --> 01:59:40.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2695
01:59:40.091 --> 01:59:41.680
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like my mission.</v>

2696
01:59:41.681 --> 01:59:44.680
<v Speaker 2>I just want people to see it from all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these different angles here.</v>

2697
01:59:44.681 --> 01:59:46.870
<v Speaker 2>All these different people say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And quite frankly selfishly,</v>

2698
01:59:46.871 --> 01:59:49.170
<v Speaker 2>I want to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one,</v>

2699
01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:51.700
<v Speaker 2>the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that probably impacted my life</v>

2700
01:59:51.701 --> 01:59:56.701
<v Speaker 2>the most was when I stopped building my </v>
<v Speaker 2>ego around being smart and I started </v>

2701
01:59:56.701 --> 02:00:00.601
<v Speaker 2>building my ego around being a learner </v>
<v Speaker 2>and being super humble and sitting at </v>

2702
02:00:00.601 --> 02:00:01.510
<v Speaker 2>people's feet and just wanting to listen</v>
<v Speaker 2>and learn.</v>

2703
02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:04.900
<v Speaker 2>And then immediately put what I learned </v>
<v Speaker 2>into action.</v>

2704
02:00:04.901 --> 02:00:09.901
<v Speaker 2>So the show is also wildly selfish for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and the staff because we get to meet </v>

2705
02:00:09.901 --> 02:00:12.760
<v Speaker 2>incredible people that have just super </v>
<v Speaker 2>empowering wisdom.</v>

2706
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:17.170
<v Speaker 2>And so I believe that the dual track of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the social content was just on the nose,</v>

2707
02:00:17.171 --> 02:00:17.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2708
02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:20.320
<v Speaker 2>You would come on the show and you would</v>
<v Speaker 2>just tell us like how you did it.</v>

2709
02:00:20.350 --> 02:00:23.320
<v Speaker 2>You would talk about like how you got </v>
<v Speaker 2>into stand up comedy.</v>

2710
02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:28.340
<v Speaker 2>I got into stand up comedy because I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fucking funny guy when everybody else </v>

2711
02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:28.340
<v Speaker 2>was nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2712
02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:31.501
<v Speaker 2>But then like it actually has to become </v>
<v Speaker 2>a craft and you got to do it over and </v>

2713
02:00:31.501 --> 02:00:32.770
<v Speaker 2>over and over and talking about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>grind and how you get good over time and</v>

2714
02:00:32.771 --> 02:00:34.960
<v Speaker 2>people are going to trip the fuck out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and just like go,</v>

2715
02:00:34.961 --> 02:00:37.210
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's exactly what I need to do.</v>

2716
02:00:37.211 --> 02:00:38.950
<v Speaker 2>Which is a message I think a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people need right now,</v>

2717
02:00:38.951 --> 02:00:40.390
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a long grind.</v>

2718
02:00:41.110 --> 02:00:43.200
<v Speaker 2>So it's stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's impacted.</v>

2719
02:00:43.650 --> 02:00:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta wrap this up,</v>
