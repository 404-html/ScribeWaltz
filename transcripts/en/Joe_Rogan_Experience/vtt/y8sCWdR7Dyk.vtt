00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.840
You guys did a podcast last night.
It's Spanish,
Spanish,
Spanglish and English.

9
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.550
We started English and then went into Spanglish and I just wanted to know,

10
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.830
I want the people know who that how Yo Romero was.

11
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:38.280
We've talked about Cuba and his humble beginnings.

12
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:42.600
How he went to school from Monday to Friday is of the pyramid and you're just

13
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:45.510
wrestled and that's how they do it in Cuba.

14
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.750
Then you go up the pyramid and now he only went home on the weekends.

15
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.640
Pyramid meaning it's a pyramid school and bleak.

16
00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:53.980
I made like toilet Bekah said do it.

17
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.600
<v 0>Um,
they'd be,</v>

18
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.550
it's a system as soon as he thought might be down here,

19
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.330
GAM nps and then we didn't put on the hell do we can start started about seven

20
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:10.750

25
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.443

26
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.513
<v 0>Um,</v>

30
00:01:44.621 --> 00:01:48.890
schedule.
Militaristic.
Sneaky.

So everything,

35
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.570
how did they decide what sport you compete in?
Like,
how did you choose wrestling?

36
00:02:13.571 --> 00:02:16.990
Was that just something that you loved or was it,
did you like other sports?

37
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.690
Like how did you choose to focus on wrestling book had to go hit the car.

38
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:23.670

But I love Brazil boxing.
In the beginning my dad said,

43
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.561
I know like it,

44
00:02:44.561 --> 00:02:49.010
you make a sport boxing because boxing is too much punched in the face.

45
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:52.100
There's no good,

And Man,
everybody know my family,
you know,
uh,

56
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.320
one coach for wrestling [inaudible] he sent me and then I go to [inaudible].

57
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.350
She,
I said it's not my Nigga.
We just sent the notice.

58
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.820
There's a lot of traders in the pyramid bunk.
I scored less,

59
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.410
they go to the schools,
I would call it.
I didn't go to look for talent,

60
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.650
you know,
he,
I said what else?
And they do try outs.

61
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.710
He had been there that I put her in bed,
but I got it bought it to place,

62
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.340
depending on what you're,
how you're doing the testing when you go to that.

63
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.130
So it's just like,
uh,
they go,

64
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:18.250
they evaluate you and then they decide what's best for you.

65
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.920
For the example you coached for boxing uncle for judo,

66
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:27.040
it goes down.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.590
Then the talent for blockchain.

75
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.930
Maybe you see okay for books in good,

when they get these are very young,

80
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.560
you know,
and go to that for that.

81
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.000
Especially at a school for spar,
you know,

82
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.690
[inaudible] the lowest level.

83
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.900
Say Yama [inaudible] and 80 [inaudible] there.

84
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.740
See and come and say Jambalaya Mosbacher the lowest level plan 80 and nothing to

85
00:05:46.351 --> 00:05:51.160
leave my side until [inaudible] 80 either.

86
00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:52.210
That's the second level.

87
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.030
The second level is m s s extra

88
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.980
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible].

89
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.780
So Yama is bought last year and [inaudible] that's the highest level.

90
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.470
That's the junior,
junior,

91
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.430
They were the [inaudible].
He stopped.
He said that she on us,
you know.

92
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.720
<v 3>Then you get the selection to be national Olympic Center,</v>

93
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.430
Olympic Center.
So they take it to a different center.

94
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.350
So you keep going up like until you get to like the UFC training facility.

95
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.210
Matt Brown told me that he did his camp for,
I think it was the Mike Pyle fight,

96
00:06:33.211 --> 00:06:36.990
this camp in Cuba.
He said there's just tremendous talent.

97
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.050
He said he just couldn't believe how good the boxers were,

98
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.250
how good the wrestlers were was just unbelievable.

99
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.273
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

103
00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.370

105
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.780
[inaudible] I think [inaudible] I see swipe okay.

106
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.740
He thinks he can't even go back there to that center now

107
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.970
they would smack him.
I said,
wow,

108
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.233
these are

109
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.183
crazy.

110
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.980
<v 3>When you were there,
um,
Matt,</v>

111
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.620
one of the things that Matt was saying to Matt Brown had tremendous respect for

112
00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:37.840
the Cuban athletes and who said it was an amazing,

113
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.930
amazing system that they produced great,
great talent.

114
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.050
But he's saying that as you get higher and higher levels,

115
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.650
your accommodations are better.
Where you sleep is better.
Your food,

116

Whole sci tech.

118
00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.290
So a lot of incentive to them.

119
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.450
<v 2>It's true.
Yeah.
See it.</v>

120
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:09.460
Is it good or not seen the reality?

121
00:08:10.421 --> 00:08:14.180
It's hard to say,
but it's a reality but isn't tight.

127
00:08:39.971 --> 00:08:41.890

128
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:47.230
[inaudible] come on through up.

134

135
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:13.850
You want to get more food cart catalog Molla Molla or

if you look at house small Cuba is,

141
00:09:38.321 --> 00:09:41.680
but how many great talents have come from Cuba?

142
00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.690
Obviously it's effective.
It has its merits,
right?
Like that system.

143
00:09:46.691 --> 00:09:47.770

he's in Kentucky and you're in Denver training.

Ah,

<v 4>Okay.</v>

213
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:03.090
<v 2>Do you think it will become a Makino
inferior.</v>

214
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:04.283
A stereo.

215

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.690
<v 1>No,
you have to become a machine inside and out.</v>

218
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.670
And it makes hard as those 10 guys know when you're sick.
Right.

219
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.690
They know when you get hurt.
So now I'm training with you,

So that's why he's the machine that he is.

224
00:14:27.191 --> 00:14:31.780
He says it only trains you to be a machine on the outside but also trains you to

225
00:14:31.781 --> 00:14:32.980
be a machine on the inside.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.630
What did you think you were going to do though?

286
00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:56.200
Did you think you want to fight MMA back then?
Because it wasn't,

287
00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.300
I want to try it.

288
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.510
I say I want to do this one of these days,

289
00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:06.730

You never know what they,

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:11.650

Right.
But that's,
I now what I want.

291
00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:16.600
I say the phrase,
I make a wrestling because he gave money happen.

292
00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.060
Buddhists,
Liga,
wrestling,
Buddhist liquor.

293
00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.100
You know what does that [inaudible]

294
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.750
<v 1>Jeremy is a bond.
There's a league for wrestling.
Okay.</v>

295
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.200
<v 0>Yeah.
[inaudible] me,</v>

296
00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:30.230
me,
me.

297
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:35.230
[inaudible] she knows Germany and [inaudible] go ahead.

298
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:39.390
<v 1>All the clubs will want to take them as soon as he gets a Germany,
right.</v>

299
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.390
You want them to offer sanctuary,
right?
The office.
Yeah.

300
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.320
<v 0>So when</v>

301
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:50.990
you ain't got to see in 10 then got,
our motto was open,

302
00:19:50.991 --> 00:19:55.500
he was broke and it don't tell you that he went about wrestling,
pedal,

303
00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.590
knee pains and I said,
mmm,

304
00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:02.440
<v 1>is he,
even though he wrestled,
he wanted to MMA.</v>

305
00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.770
He was telling me last night that he would watch those videos.

306
00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:10.771
People would smuggle UFC fights and to Cuba and it wasn't knowledge.

307
00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.450
It wasn't going to happen for him and Cuba.
It was never going to happen for it.

308
00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.940
Right.
So he wanted again to MMA.
So when he went to Germany,

309
00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.410
he stayed and there was a,
uh,

310
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.140
an MMA fight and they wouldn't let them fight amateur

311
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.370
because he was in the Olympics.
So they throw them right into the wolves.

312
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.330
Like his first fight.
We didn't even train.

313
00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.970
<v 0>He's being brown in regards to,</v>

314
00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:40.620
you can see my dear friends fight with a habit as men.

315
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.730
Do you see what I do is I,
when I find the guy,

316
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.530
that's it.
When it happened,
she's not a line.
Can we find the video?
Yeah,

317
00:20:50.531 --> 00:20:54.810
you can't.
You can't.
If you can find the video and it's in Germany,
in Germany.

318
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:59.990
And how long did you live in Germany for?
Six years.
Six years.
Wow.
Yeah.

319
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:06.560
I make an Oprah cool like this,
but hey,

320
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.740
I started from the bottom.
He didn't know what he was doing.
Here it is.

321
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:17.490
Is this it?
No.
Dot.
Is that like a tournament?
There's no,

322
00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:22.130
that seems like Jujitsu.
That's in one tournament.
But yeah,
that,

323
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:26.370
that's his tournaments.
Is that MMA or Jujitsu?
MMA.
MMA.

324
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:31.330
Nice big basketball court.
Yeah,
that's what I think all MMA should be on.

325
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:36.370
All right.
Find out.
Um,
so when you had the first fight,

326
00:21:36.371 --> 00:21:39.490
you had no training,
just,
just your wrestling wisely,

327
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.150
but you knew how to box a little from being.

328
00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:46.250
Do you know anytime you can keep out because,
and give as,

329
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:49.630
as you'll have a grub as the people's okay.
Boxing.
Right,
right,
right.

330
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.850
I did it being in the street,
you know,
just fucking around.
Yeah.
Wow.

331
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:58.480
So when you were in Cuba,
were you thinking about the future?

332
00:21:58.481 --> 00:21:59.820
That there was only so,

333
00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:03.820
so many more years you can compete in wrestling and then what else to do?

334
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.510
One Who turned,
go to top and sign on your photo.

335
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.440

Oh Man,

343
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:46.130
but still throwing shots to the body.
Oh,

344
00:22:46.131 --> 00:22:49.550

What are they doing here?
Is that what that is?

345
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:53.360

349
00:23:07.941 --> 00:23:12.050

Push him in the head a few times.

354
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:38.930

I met this Cuban guy that goes,

364
00:24:25.491 --> 00:24:29.330
I'm never coming back to the states.
There's a lot better than this shit.

366
00:24:33.141 --> 00:24:33.974
but he was a waiter.

367
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.070
They kind of understood the language goes a lot better than living here.
I go,

368
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:41.980
really?
Really?
And he went back.
He couldn't get a job yet.

Tangy.
Fine.
And that,

372
00:24:54.591 --> 00:24:57.170
that takes care of everything.
That was the root of all evil.

373
00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:02.090
And it's always such a Sadie,
but they didn't care about the conviction.

374
00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.320
They just want the money.
They didn't care about the anger management class.

375
00:25:05.321 --> 00:25:09.830
It's just be the 10 g's and we'll rip up the warrant.
Fucking America.

376
00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:11.960
Fucking America.
So you,

<v 1>He would hit the sticks on the street and shit like that.</v>

383
00:25:35.461 --> 00:25:39.570
There was no MMA coaches at that time.
Not when he was dead.
No young coaches.

384
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.433

515
00:34:15.351 --> 00:34:18.520

524
00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:00.340
And I met.
Got to Tim.
Maybe you are right to American subjects.

525
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:04.870
That's the way to go.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:09.830
he moved to Miami and easy fit.
A lot of Cubans.

Right?

528
00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:17.170

529
00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:22.890
I love it because they can mucho [inaudible] they they meaning,

530
00:35:23.741 --> 00:35:28.240

He sees a lot of kids from his childhood.
Ah,

Many people,

531
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:31.660
man,
which I can't tell.
They go watch.
I even cool a lot of mapping

532
00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:38.000
from all over.
They fit and

533
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
<v 5>[inaudible] even my home and killed and being in Miami</v>

534
00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.720
<v 1>now in this country,</v>

535
00:35:44.721 --> 00:35:48.290
it's very difficult if someone's coming from Mexico or from a lot of other

536
00:35:48.291 --> 00:35:51.770
countries to immigrate to America.
How hard is it if you're Cuban,

537
00:35:51.771 --> 00:35:54.020
they just let you in,
right?
Isn't it a different thing?

538
00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:58.660
Like they accept people that are leaving Cuba like,
Ooh,

539
00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:03.170
I accept that.
I can say Elita Si.
Si.
It's easier.
Right?

540
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:07.810
It's very easy.
Yeah.
Where it's like Mexico.
It's very hard.
Yeah.

541
00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:10.310
If someone wants to be a citizen of Mexico,
they say,

542
00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.140
[inaudible] know,

543
00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.520
I knew that it's tougher for the Mexicans.

544
00:36:16.521 --> 00:36:19.880
It's almost like they're encouraging Cubans to leave.
Wow.
Yeah.

545
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:22.340
And then remember getting Obama before he left,

546
00:36:22.341 --> 00:36:26.960
he put the no top rule member as a punishment for fucking Clinton.

547
00:36:26.961 --> 00:36:29.900
Not Willing,
he fucking Obama.

548
00:36:29.901 --> 00:36:34.440
That's why he was got pissed off at Obama because he signed the rule again that

549
00:36:34.441 --> 00:36:37.370
you don't have to touch the beach.
Remember that shit they had,

550
00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.280
what was the road was the road,
I don't know what the fucking thing was.

551
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:44.680
If he touched the beach then you were in were Haitians don't have that right

552
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:48.860
Haitians,
they fucking Yank them.
But all the Cuban has to do is touch the beach.

553
00:36:48.861 --> 00:36:52.900
It's like fucking playing tag at home base.
But back one,

554
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:57.880
the new gold on
the bottom,
like Ooh,
may go cutting.

555
00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:03.380
And Raffi,
he said,
well,
the head on a lot of people escape from killed a man.

556
00:37:03.381 --> 00:37:08.120
They died.
That's a hard fucking journeyman,
90 miles on both 90 miles on a boat.

557
00:37:08.121 --> 00:37:11.450
And they do it.
They got it to a science.
If you speak to those people,

558
00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:16.490
they leave at a certain time.
They bring up saltine crackers.

00:47:11.861 --> 00:47:13.660
I said not how he couldn't do what they say.

701
00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:18.340
So that was part of the journey to get to the United States.
Oh,

702
00:47:18.341 --> 00:47:23.270
she had to do that in order to get over.
Yeah.
Damn.

703
00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.410
This is excellent.

704
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.230
Esrs the SAS

705
00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:38.980
mini minimi potter and that's one like the minimal stories pocket.

706
00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:44.080
Not
In core.

708
00:47:47.541 --> 00:47:50.570

711
00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:03.910
but I'm nothing.
But where you have no communication after you leave.

712
00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.700
They didn't get to shut down.
I said

713
00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:13.560
[inaudible]
daughter

714
00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:18.340
and her mom knows

715
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:23.180
on lung consolidate from better and lessen Ba.

716
00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:25.163
So did it.

717
00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.630
But they didn't see us yelling.

718
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:35.640
Got Our [inaudible] on day that the brothers have found on the journey through

719
00:48:36.531 --> 00:48:37.620
the jungles of Colombia.

720
00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:43.150
They found that brothers called consists like eating like you know,

721
00:48:43.151 --> 00:48:48.151
by a lion or whatever the courts corpuses he TNN can't say that.

722
00:48:48.481 --> 00:48:52.470
Told me that Georgia.
He said eight.
I,
I know you'd have to look,

723
00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:56.160
you gotta get going to get to the United States.

724
00:48:58.430 --> 00:49:01.640
Christ is dude on HR.
But I saw your,

725
00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:04.550
those deer take God,
thank you.

726
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:09.730
But you're giving me the opportunity very easy.
It's not easy,

727
00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:13.570
but it's very easy when you look out of the rug.

728
00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.170
Do you know he had little hammer?

729
00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:18.350
I don't think anybody who was born here will ever appreciate it.

730
00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.240
Like someone who comes here from somewhere else.

731
00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:22.190
<v 1>Well,
we all,</v>

732
00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:26.620
everybody in this fucking room started coming over on somebody.

733
00:49:26.621 --> 00:49:30.400
Did somebody to some of your background or somebody did what they did?

734
00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:31.780
How many generations have you here,
man?

735
00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:35.140
My great grandfather from one side came from Ireland.

736
00:49:35.141 --> 00:49:37.770
I've seen like the paperwork and I think the other from Scotland and somehow,

737
00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:38.831
I mean,

738
00:49:38.831 --> 00:49:43.831
this is what drives me the most crazy about all the anti immigration shit in

739
00:49:44.831 --> 00:49:49.790
America today.
This is whole country is made out of immigrant immigrants,

740
00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:52.720
the whole country by yet dental,
Amy,
Allen,

741
00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:57.500
Americans total.
So much.
Any guarantees,

742
00:49:58.090 --> 00:50:01.840
even native Americans seem to you,
they walked over thousands of years ago.

743
00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:06.940
I can't eat silencing me signing oil,
everyone and everyone.

744
00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:11.470
Everyone.
Yeah.
You have you done the 23 and me or anything?
I need to do that.

745
00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:15.550
You know,
it's so stupid how a lot of people knock it,

746
00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.200
but when I read mine,

747
00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:21.990
I looked into it for a few days and you learn about history.
Yeah.
You know,

748
00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:25.230
I have a little Chinese.
Really?
Yeah.

749
00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:30.700
Because you can't me Dan Keana.
No,
spitting the bottle.

750
00:50:30.701 --> 00:50:33.020
On Monday I went and did you have any idea?

751
00:50:33.021 --> 00:50:37.370
You had Chinese and you know Chinese because the Chinese made the first real

752
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:38.090
thing.

753
00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:43.090
They found chickens in San Francisco that had that DNA from that shiny.

754
00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:46.580
It's very the worst thing you could do if you smoked pot,

755
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.810
it's spitting a bowel and get the report back.
That is a fucking nightmare.

756
00:50:50.811 --> 00:50:54.760
Once you realize who you are on the do Mondo Papalia

757
00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:00.290
who you can see,
it really messes with you.

758
00:51:00.291 --> 00:51:03.230
For a couple of days I was rushing and you,
I was western African,

759
00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.410
western Africa and Africa,
which I always knew.

760
00:51:06.411 --> 00:51:11.411
I'm Cuban and you can't bring it up when you see a bar Cuban,

761
00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:16.910
it's a black dude that speak Spanish.
Black Dude just speak Spanish.

762
00:51:16.911 --> 00:51:19.430
They Africans.
Yeah,
so I knew that there's,

763
00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:23.330
there's African blood and the top,
it's not Spanish,

764
00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:27.890
they call it something else.
It's Spain and something else up there.

765
00:51:27.891 --> 00:51:28.740
That's where,

766
00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:32.840
so they went all the way around and the last little bit is Russian Jew,

767
00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:38.240
like 2% of them.
God knows where he got that from.
But here's the problem.

768
00:51:38.241 --> 00:51:42.070
If you're native American,
it can't give you an ivory blend.

769
00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:46.310
So that's where we're really from.
Wow.
Nah,
probably with Jeremy.

770
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.320
But if you're American and deal with that thing,

771
00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:51.770
they can't like my wife's American Indian,
I see her grandmother.

772
00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:55.190
I was the only grandfather,
bro.
Fucking Indian.
Okay.

773
00:51:55.191 --> 00:52:00.080
The mother got the off the Terry,
the Indian fucking lip from doesn't read it.

774
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:01.731
It doesn't read.

775
00:52:01.731 --> 00:52:04.730
If you're Indian and unless you're a couple of generations back then my mom

776
00:52:04.731 --> 00:52:07.880
knows eating.
You can see through it ain't,
I met a guy.
I know.

777
00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:09.800
It doesn't have to read the native American.
No,

778
00:52:09.801 --> 00:52:12.530
it doesn't read it unless you're three or four gender or something.

779
00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:13.720
Can you got to ask my wife?

780
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:18.170
That's why she don't buy into it because it didn't tell us she was an American

781
00:52:18.171 --> 00:52:19.490
Indian,
but the sister did.

782
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:23.450
So it's kind of fucking weird how the sister had a little bit more,

783
00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:27.530
my wife's stole,
had it,
but not as much more of her Irish.
That's interesting.

784
00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:30.260
You know,
it doesn't take a gene.

785
00:52:30.261 --> 00:52:33.710
Last night we were playing to get this fucking savage,
fire it up.

786
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:37.310
You got to play the old school Cuban music.
I told him,

787
00:52:37.311 --> 00:52:40.200
this is what it needs to play before he fights.
You should've seen them.

788
00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:44.000
You should have fucking Sam.
And uh,
he,

789
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:49.190
he was explaining to Lee and his manager that if you know anything about Cuba

790
00:52:49.311 --> 00:52:53.660
will fucking,
it was a slave mom.
It was a fucking slave market,
you know,

791
00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:54.710
that's why they bought them.

792
00:52:54.711 --> 00:52:58.670
That's where the white people went and saw a sex show while they were there and

793
00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:01.570
took a couple of slaves back to them to all alibi.
Moreover,

794
00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:05.410
the fuck they were from the reality of it.
So a

795
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:12.530
crazy
beautiful to be here now though,
Huh?
Dot.

796
00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:17.480
Contento.
Si.
She got him.
I said,
why?
He say,

797
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:22.610
can I see how the output I met up with Danielle.
I eat,

798
00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:23.820
that's what I meant.
The tagging,

799
00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:28.740
locate your career and not just,
uh,

800
00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:34.260
that to be here,
but to also be doing what he wants to do,

801
00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:37.290
you know,
for people don't know.
And another job,

802
00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:40.080
it's a documentary called something brothers.

803
00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:43.950
It's about the two Cuban to live on.
Leave on Fernandez.

804
00:53:43.951 --> 00:53:47.190
Brothers live on and do dookay come on guy.

805
00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:51.780
One guy comes first and wins the world series and the other brother got

806
00:53:51.781 --> 00:53:54.150
blackballed and cube and they threw eggs at his house.

807
00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.610
Wouldn't Fidel wouldn't let him play baseball and on more,

808
00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:01.800
what's the name of the documentary?
Brothers and arms,
his son,
Jesus Christ,

809
00:54:01.801 --> 00:54:05.100
Joe Rogan.
And then they could regs at them.
They wouldn't even let her,

810
00:54:05.101 --> 00:54:08.550
he had to play on the field like he had to play like,
like how he boxed.

811
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:12.570
He hadn't had Duke at her von Hernandez.

812
00:54:12.571 --> 00:54:15.430
And then that mother fucker came left his wife and daughter

813
00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:18.393
Joe Rogan.

814
00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:23.520
And then this mother fucker goes up to New York and tears them up in New York,

815
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:26.370
like fucking one world series.

816
00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:30.360
And then at the end he fucking wins in San Diego,

817
00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:33.210
but he can't get his daughters and his wife up here.

818
00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:38.780
So they got some reporter in Washington to call up fucking cardinal and why fly

819
00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:40.260
to Cuba that night?

820
00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:45.150
And they flew to Cuba that night and Fidel was watching the fucking Yankee game.

821
00:54:45.151 --> 00:54:50.100
Jack.
And the cardinal game,
the known,
there was a note from Hell dookay saying,

822
00:54:50.101 --> 00:54:53.910
please let my wife and daughter go put them on a fucking plane.

823
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:59.160
Fucking ticker tape parade.
The sister wife at the end goes,
listen,

824
00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:01.560
I'm in New York and a fucking float.
They just want them.

825
00:55:01.561 --> 00:55:03.750
I see all these people throwing toilet paper.

826
00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:07.830
I started grabbing it because in Cuba you have to fight for a fucking roll of

827
00:55:07.831 --> 00:55:09.750
toilet paper.
She goes,

828
00:55:09.751 --> 00:55:14.310
here they are throwing toilet paper at the parade and her natural instinct was

829
00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:18.730
to grab the toilet paper because I had done Larry Young for nothing Nigga.
No,

830
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:22.090
I don't know.
Young Kid.
He's like a thousand and boy,
I only got time for you.

831
00:55:22.091 --> 00:55:23.210
I'm dope.
I bet they thought,

832
00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:27.890
oh hey [inaudible] and go up.

833
00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:29.460
No,
we have a bed there.
Toilet.

834
00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:34.440
That's fucking crazy,
Joe.
That is crazy.

835
00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:39.830
But I feel like no one appreciates America more than someone who was born

836
00:55:40.231 --> 00:55:42.510
somewhere else where they're suppressed,

837
00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:46.050
where it's hard and then they'd come over here and then they appreciate like,

838
00:55:46.051 --> 00:55:49.410
I think too many of us take this for granted every fucking day.

839
00:55:49.411 --> 00:55:52.260
I see it and it drives me fucking crazy,
man.

840
00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:58.350
I see it in the drives me crazy and we complain more and keep getting more

841
00:55:58.351 --> 00:56:01.620
immigrants and these immigrants,
well,
they're taking our jobs.
No,

842
00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:04.320
there fucking hustling.
Yeah,
they're hot.
They have no choice.

843
00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:06.810
They try the whole thing.
The country's founded on.

844
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:09.720
They drive an Uber 16 hours a day.
You don't find them.

845
00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:13.920
I know kids didn't go to college and can't imagine they've got to work five days

846
00:56:13.921 --> 00:56:18.630
a week.
Yeah,
we work seven days a week.
It's in our fucking DNA.
That's,

847
00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:22.640
you know,
happy to be here and happy to how can be here.
Yeah.

848
00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:25.150
Now when you were in Cuba,

849
00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:29.340
the work ethic though with the wrestling and being on the APP,

850
00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:32.590
that means that the intense amount of work,

851
00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:36.610
that must translate very well into MMA training.

852
00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:40.420
Do you think that MMA training is as hard as wrestling training?

853
00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:47.200
Like when you were back in Cuba.

Yes.
Our [inaudible].

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:34.710
You know,
you use the same science kind of man.

930
01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:39.730
Men May totally mentality it meant I know mentally that Metal Barlow here,

938
01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:15.580
That's how I,

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:17.950
<v 1>depending on the goal,

946
01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:44.110
and when they have you lifted weights,
what kind of weightlifting?

947
01:03:44.111 --> 01:03:48.810
Like Olympic style,

They test you.
They test your strength.

958
01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:35.430
I said,
when I put it right there to Bezel,
my weight can do nobody else.

959
01:04:35.650 --> 01:04:39.550
Do you know what I'm gonna tell him?
[inaudible]

960
01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:42.160
You understand talking about that.
I mean,

961
01:04:42.161 --> 01:04:45.880
I think that I made him mad that barely fit in the festival.
We're from the same,

962
01:04:45.881 --> 01:04:48.130
we're the same age,
but different weights.
Okay.

963
01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:54.470
I think that I think will not pray wrong.
They give me a try out like I'm okay.

964
01:04:54.970 --> 01:04:59.260
For example,
Todd bench press.
I made them in Manasseh.

965
01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:04.860
He [inaudible] how can do their best work to live and die based on the wait till

Nino de de,

969
01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:20.960
I'm an only hamper sampling Nino,

970
01:05:20.970 --> 01:05:25.190
the 18 years heavyweight it then no heavyweight,

971
01:05:25.330 --> 01:05:27.840
18 year old heavyweight [inaudible]

972
01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:35.050
cm pounds and are on first toggle a hundred pounds and a bench press.

973
01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:40.290
I will let the [inaudible] wrong [inaudible] and bought these trainers that they

974
01:05:40.661 --> 01:05:42.220
have a fucking top notch.

975
01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:47.730
You know that you're stealing money there must [inaudible] Los heavyweight

976
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:53.840
[inaudible] tilling only there.

977
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:59.470
They want to keep on doing [inaudible] [inaudible]

978
01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:03.420
<v 1>so they know when you're up in weight,
when you're down in weight,</v>

979
01:06:03.421 --> 01:06:06.530
they know everything about you because they've been doing it for so long,
right?

980
01:06:06.570 --> 01:06:09.670
So they base you off that weight,
you do that thing a hundred pounds.

981
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:12.340
Now they base you off that way.
If you're a heavy weight,

982
01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.870
do you still follow that system?
Now when you train for MMA,

983
01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:19.590
like how do you decide you do?
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.

984
01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:21.510
Because you still obviously have a lot of muscle.

985
01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:24.020
You're obviously still doing some strength and conditioning work.

986
01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:27.380
You can get glasses them.
What do you mean?

989
01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:47.250
<v 1>The trainer he has now was the guy that made the selections for the Cuban</v>

990
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:51.040
Olympic Taekwondo.
Ah,

991
01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:53.580
the countdown fight before the Rockhold fight.
Yeah.

992
01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:57.640
You were training at a taekwondo school?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So he was doing that in Cuba?

993
01:06:57.730 --> 01:07:01.120
Yeah.
Ah,
interesting.
So he knows the system

994
01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:03.790
<v 5>[inaudible] he came,</v>

995
01:07:03.791 --> 01:07:08.710
he comes from that timeline.
The Rondo Yoga,

996
01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:13.150
uh,
epicenter now [inaudible] what?

997
01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.010
He started training whenever we changed everything,

998
01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:20.250
we got [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] data format.

999
01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.180
Let's work this way.

1000
01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.840
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1001
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:29.910
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1002
01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:36.530
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] the [inaudible] onsite.

1003
01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:39.850
I know,
I know.

1004
01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:44.170
<v 1>The guy had already been known for working with older elite athletes.</v>

1005
01:07:44.171 --> 01:07:47.920
Like we've always joked around about Teofilo Stevenson.
Yeah,

1006
01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.990
I talked a lot.
Then you have the old fellows.

1007
01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:55.280
Could have been one of the best people set up a whole can.
Okay.

1008
01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:00.330
[inaudible] it's the people,
I think.

1009
01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:05.730
No,
it was fine.
50 I lost the whole,

1010
01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.620
they don't have fucking Birgitta buckets.
Right,
right.

1011
01:08:08.621 --> 01:08:13.510
So nobody fucking knows that so crazy that the geniuses have taken a 40 year
old.

1012
01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:16.130
That's why he switched with this guy.
Well

1013
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:19.370
<v 3>Louis Ortiz,
they go forward.
Deontay wilder this past weekend.</v>

1014
01:08:19.371 --> 01:08:23.390
They're sending like no one knows how old he is a least.
Yeah,
at least.

1015
01:08:23.490 --> 01:08:27.500
So they have this older,
oh,
you know him.

1016
01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:33.170
So 41 for sure.
Oh,
oh,
Tj in Cuba.
Yeah.
Okay.

1017
01:08:33.171 --> 01:08:35.810
That makes sense.
Yeah.

1018
01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.970
Cause everybody was wondering like,
you know,
maybe he's older than he says.

1019
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:46.750
<v 5>Yeah.
She had never done that.
A quad ain't doubty Mimo Teddy night,</v>

1021
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:51.830
<v 3>No Way.

She had thought,
Oh,</v>

1022
01:08:53.690 --> 01:08:55.730
I'm telling you.
No say they don't say nothing.

1023
01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:57.470
But see the thing like tico Steven said,

1024
01:08:57.471 --> 01:09:00.110
for a lot of us that are boxing fans who was,

1025
01:09:00.111 --> 01:09:04.110
we're always disappointed that he never got to leave Cuba.
No,
no.

1026
01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:07.160
We want him to see him fight Ali.
We wanted to see him fight Frazier.

1027
01:09:07.161 --> 01:09:10.160
We wanted to see him fight the best of the best in the professionally.

1028
01:09:14.270 --> 01:09:16.360
<v 5>I these are not 11</v>

1032
01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:34.870

She paid off.

1033
01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:36.560
<v 4>Okay.</v>

01:10:41.761 --> 01:10:45.840
It must be combination of eating right,

1059
01:11:18.461 --> 01:11:22.860

Masala prayers,
when he does his tests,

01:11:47.911 --> 01:11:51.450
coach tests some uncertain levels.
He said,

1068
01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.600
He stays freaked out or a can't believe he's still okay.

1069
01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.350
Although we had calmed down at the tower.
So you look on

1070
01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:05.970
[inaudible] [inaudible] he had come down.

1071
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:07.800
I said that on the countdown.

1072
01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.040
I saw the taekwondo guy drone little fucking sticks at them.

1073
01:12:11.041 --> 01:12:13.110
You know the thing was foam sticks,

1074
01:12:13.111 --> 01:12:15.600
a false text and I saw him pick him up the tires,

1075
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:18.870
but I never really saw him sparring or wrestling,

1076
01:12:19.450 --> 01:12:21.030
but because,

1077
01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:25.540
and I brought that out on the Mooc Guardian because he can't be talking too much

1078
01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:29.100
just because I make it that their blessing and Cuba.

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:08.440
He's in school.
But I want to do,

1102
01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.870

Yeah.

1104
01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:20.170
That'll be nice.
So that's that.
That must benefit you tremendously.

1105
01:14:20.171 --> 01:14:21.780
To go and train with the Cuban team.

1106
01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:27.220
I had 20 we did the CBA metal and then the last Olympic Games and we did,

1107
01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:33.390

That'd be good.
What photos?
What was the last Olympic Games?

1109
01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:42.640
So would have been two years ago.
Was it real,

1110
01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:47.150

Yeah.
Yeah.
And Real.

1111
01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:51.660
This guy,
he's as he had been met,
ain't going to drill.
He said 97 killers.

1112
01:14:52.170 --> 01:14:53.610

1115
01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:10.040
I know Louis.
I

1116
01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:16.500
No freestyle and Greco Roman guys,

1119
01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:26.760

uh,

1120
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:29.950
this physical strength and endurance at this age?

1121
01:15:29.951 --> 01:15:34.600
At 41 I think it's just genetics.
Just luck.
Just God.

1122
01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:40.710

For sure.
Sure,

To join up.

1124
01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:48.790

My daddy say,
Nah,
Nah,

1249
01:24:27.850 --> 01:24:31.120
So when your coach was telling you you're taking the wrong path,

1250
01:24:31.530 --> 01:24:35.240
you saw the results that you are winning.
I go to imam,

1256
01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:05.760

1262
01:25:27.201 --> 01:25:30.130
My coach is saying every time when I go to the fight,

1263
01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:33.830
when I training Jack on the yard,

1264
01:25:33.970 --> 01:25:36.490
Once he became the best thing,

1265
01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:38.650
He looked me in the eyes and ideas here.

1266
01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:42.220
You remember when you come in here and now you know,

1317
01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:25.780

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:27.270
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1319
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:29.420

1321
01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:40.080
And when you cross deny how's this,

1322
01:29:40.110 --> 01:29:44.200
is this better now?
Right.
And then it becomes personal.

Right.

1326
01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:59.800
It's a sport.
Right,
right.
It's a spot.
But when you group the lines,

1327
01:29:59.870 --> 01:30:02.120
you stay with me here,

1328
01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:06.640

No good about me.
Right.
Why

1332
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:25.110
do you think that in America,

1333
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:28.530
particularly today in the UFC,

1334
01:30:29.010 --> 01:30:34.010
this is common because it gets guys attention and they see like Conor McGregor

1335
01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:38.640
who makes a lot of money because not just the visibility cause he could fight

1336
01:30:38.641 --> 01:30:42.300
really well,
but also because he talks shit really well to Timmy.

1337
01:30:43.230 --> 01:30:46.040
I understand a little bit,
but I wanted him Moses.

1338
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:50.350

1342
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:07.310

1355
01:31:56.260 --> 01:32:00.060
able to second.
Hmm.
Do

1356
01:32:01.930 --> 01:32:02.860
you do a King?

1357
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:07.810
[inaudible] he was there 15 years and he learned every fucking second that

1358
01:32:07.811 --> 01:32:11.090
you're there.
You'll learn it.

1359
01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:13.550

I ain't got nothing.

1361
01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:19.670
[inaudible]

1362
01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:24.790
meadows for you to be there,
you have to be in the top four.

1363
01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:26.960
So that's the pressure

1364
01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:30.830
to get them to the part of the metal,

1365
01:32:31.090 --> 01:32:34.790
the top four and every division and every sport.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1366
01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:40.270
because I'm not a,
I'm not a tonic.
You're losing this position.

1367
01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:44.140
For example,
in soccer,
you come on time.

1368
01:32:44.141 --> 01:32:48.340
I broke down the block.
Okay too.
Then number four,

1369
01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:51.690
you are number four go.
But out of sight,
they don't bust my ass.
Whooped.

1370
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:53.860
Got Your went harder.
Two more came out

1371
01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:00.340

that protein.
20 people,

1372
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.980
20 people,
the Templo,
a soccer playing soccer.

1373
01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:09.520
Tim,
I think it's steady or 24 people.

1374
01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:14.020
I think so teddy people.
So you're number three,

1375
01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:16.450
you're number three.
He said,
not a guy.

1376
01:33:16.451 --> 01:33:20.260
He said the bed and another company in another city.
They said,
okay,

1377
01:33:20.290 --> 01:33:24.430
you know number three and now I know that guy.
He push you,
you need him off.

1378
01:33:25.190 --> 01:33:29.770
You didn't move.
He coming and you go,
you go home,

1379
01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:32.620
you're gone.
You don't understand.
That's it.
Not just give up.

1380
01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:37.090
So the pressure is intense.
So 15 years.
I am.

1381
01:33:37.190 --> 01:33:41.470
See many people come and go,
ah,
well chunk time that people,

1382
01:33:41.530 --> 01:33:45.280
this jail is good and that idea and this to here and three here,

1383
01:33:45.281 --> 01:33:50.260
this guy's coming in again because he's beat it.
It's better said,
hey,
hey man,

1384
01:33:50.261 --> 01:33:54.720
you come by here
for it.
They're not as Paul.
No,

1385
01:33:54.721 --> 01:33:59.190

Right.
I understand.
I can your boiler,

1386
01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:03.570
we read come.
He could live with this or what's going on.

1387
01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:06.970
I thought you said he had gone live with the competition.

1388
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:11.610
You're going to look at,
look at,

1389
01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:13.570
stopped by something other than you've ever seen.

1390
01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:15.990
He couldn't live with it and it's no big fucking deal.

1391
01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:19.540
Many people know who I am to make it the same.

1392
01:34:19.541 --> 01:34:22.430
What are they going to do it right,

1393
01:34:23.210 --> 01:34:27.790
but cooler.
This corner.
They're not [inaudible].
They're faking it.
Yeah.

1394
01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:33.090
I say
this,
I make it clear for corner.

1395
01:34:34.050 --> 01:34:37.870
That's just the thing.
I said him and now she made me,

1396
01:34:37.871 --> 01:34:41.500

01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:47.460
They see fake.
You're not because [inaudible] is no like this.
Well,

1398
01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:52.150
it's interesting like Anderson Silva made it to the top without ever talking.

1399
01:34:52.151 --> 01:34:54.520
Shit never talked shit.

1400
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.950
Anderson Silva was always respectful people.

1401
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:01.250
<v 0>People went to see him and bought his paper review just because he was a bad</v>

1402
01:35:01.251 --> 01:35:03.050
mother fucker and they wanted to see him fight.

1403
01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:08.150
It was a hundred percent based on this ability to happen,
the fight

1404
01:35:09.690 --> 01:35:14.500
and it's on beat two bedroom [inaudible] yeah,

1405
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:19.260
That's just not fight.
You understand.

He's quiet back this day.
He says,

1406
01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:19.950

1407
01:35:19.950 --> 01:35:24.870

He know he know needed imitation corner.

1409
01:35:28.350 --> 01:35:32.820
Cause Vito was saying that Anderson was fake and he wears a mask and that's not

1410
01:35:32.821 --> 01:35:36.060
who he really is.
You understand?
So Anderson took it very personally.
Yeah.

1411
01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:40.560
Personally.
Yeah.
I never see and it's own like this.
No,

1412
01:35:40.590 --> 01:35:45.410
that was very professional.
You understand?
That's a way you say.
Yeah.

1413
01:35:45.810 --> 01:35:48.720
And now the people want the money.
No Man,

1414
01:35:48.730 --> 01:35:51.690
comment [inaudible] you a fire.
Right.

1415
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:55.440
You fight it and kill the people.
Take it,

1416
01:35:55.450 --> 01:36:00.450
the hand there and Amano and now the paper pay you.

1417
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:04.320
Right.
Well now that when you go fight again,

1418
01:36:04.590 --> 01:36:07.470
the people pay pepper bill because the people want to see you.
Right?

1419
01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:10.980
The people don't want to,
you and I,
okay,

1420
01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:15.260
so you want to say something?
Say by not,

1421
01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:20.400
[inaudible] no,
don't imitate.
You know,
there's too many people.

1422
01:36:20.401 --> 01:36:23.010
There's definitely a lot of people that were doing that,
doing a bad job of it.

1423
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:25.260
It's okay if we look at the way he thought,
Luke Rockhold

1424
01:36:27.170 --> 01:36:32.170
man [inaudible] again,

1425
01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:38.720
I say,
hey look,
and now you're seeing and now you'll remember.

1426
01:36:40.510 --> 01:36:44.930
Why are you taking me?
And you say you are,
go to our hunger.
We'll go out,

1427
01:36:45.230 --> 01:36:49.220
we'll do the party.
And when you stay with me,
you say me.
Hey,
you want to fire me?

1428
01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:53.390
He said No.
Why?
You asked me why you ask say no,

1429
01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:56.240
you want to fight with me?
She doesn't know the question.

1430
01:36:56.270 --> 01:37:00.290
The question is you want to find me.
So this is before the fight.

1431
01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:03.710
You guys had a conversation long time,
long time ago,

1432
01:37:03.711 --> 01:37:07.100
and he said he didn't want to fight you.
He say he know want to fire me.
He said,

1433
01:37:07.101 --> 01:37:10.550
okay Bro,
she,
you know,
won't find me.
I know if I you,
you understand what,

1434
01:37:10.551 --> 01:37:12.470
what was that about?
Why would you guys say that?

1435
01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:17.510
Why would you have this conversation or you're in the same division?
Yeah.

1436
01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:20.600
Why would he say that he doesn't want to fight you.
I don't know.
You need it.

1437
01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:25.150
Ask Him.
No,
me.
Because I know [inaudible] Sala competitors here,

1438
01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:29.930
he's going to start the conversation.
Right.
Okay.
You need to ask him.
Right.

1439
01:37:31.730 --> 01:37:32.070
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1440
01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:36.860
<v 0>Because I know you stay in me in the same car and the same division.
Right.
She,</v>

1441
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:40.600
you know what if I me lose it.
Oh,
she didn't want to stay.

1442
01:37:40.650 --> 01:37:45.520
If you don't want to fight,
right.
Either go up.
Yeah,
go,
oh,

1443
01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:49.980
I'll lose it.
Right.
So you wing.
I am when the financier boom,
right.

1444
01:37:50.050 --> 01:37:54.180
If and I,
when we're going to have to fight.
So when you finally did fight him.

1445
01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:56.220
Dot was when

1446
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:59.880
<v 3>you felt he was disrespectful.
He was talking to a lot of shit.</v>

1447
01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:02.690
<v 5>That's it.
What I think</v>

1448
01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:08.120
on things they get [inaudible]

1449
01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:12.190
<v 3>uh,
before what happened with do Sada</v>

1450
01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:15.870
<v 5>[inaudible] that's what happened every time when he said me,</v>

1451
01:38:18.730 --> 01:38:21.820
<v 3>explain to people what happened.
You got Ahold of a tainted supplement.</v>

1452
01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:24.380
There was something in the supplement that was

1453
01:38:26.630 --> 01:38:29.510
on that.
It was in the supplement.
So you got cleared.

1454
01:38:29.511 --> 01:38:30.880
It's like you had a small suspension.

1455
01:38:31.290 --> 01:38:35.470
<v 5>Mr No food is,
if it's a supplement,</v>

1456
01:38:35.471 --> 01:38:39.320
you're going to talk to Mondo.
He was
bullied,

1457
01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:42.420
might not understand what happened.
And they said,

1458
01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:47.060
because this superman I take,
right,

1459
01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:48.393
I take it.

1460
01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:54.460
Why does superman have something forbidding in it?
Yeah.
Why?

1461
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:56.290
Why not before,

1462
01:38:56.590 --> 01:38:57.820
<v 3>right.
Well,</v>

1463
01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.760
it's very common and a lot of times what happens is the suppliers,
when you,
uh,

1464
01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:06.550
save your supplement company and you have someone make some stuff for you and

1465
01:39:06.551 --> 01:39:09.940
then you package it and sell it,
the people that are putting it together for you,

1466
01:39:10.210 --> 01:39:12.070
they're selling a bunch of other things too.

1467
01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:15.730
And oftentimes things get into your supplement that aren't supposed to be there.

1468
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.010
Especially same.
No.
Timmy

1469
01:39:20.770 --> 01:39:22.420
[inaudible]. [inaudible]

1470
01:39:25.410 --> 01:39:29.370
[inaudible] [inaudible] to [inaudible] pub with them being,

1471
01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:31.850
they said that when people see me,
yeah,
he,

1472
01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:36.050
Tommy know this has happened to a lot of guys.

1473
01:39:36.650 --> 01:39:39.030
Question the question,

1474
01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:44.080
is it true I could go into GNC and buy shit that could get jack?
Yes.
GNC,

1475
01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:48.710
yes.
I've heard you talking on the podcast,
not when I'm on,
but other people.
Yeah,

1476
01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:52.210
so I could go into GNC and takes the guy guys.
A lot of stuff that you go,

1477
01:39:52.211 --> 01:39:53.320
if you go into GNC,

1478
01:39:53.321 --> 01:39:55.990
you'll buy stuff that's on the shelves for a little while and then they pull it

1479
01:39:56.350 --> 01:39:58.330
and a,
when companies sell stuff to them,

1480
01:39:58.331 --> 01:40:00.220
sometimes they'll say there's one thing in it,

1481
01:40:00.221 --> 01:40:02.890
but there's other things in it as well.
That's a real common thing,

1482
01:40:02.891 --> 01:40:04.720
especially if something works really well.

1483
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:07.450
Like a lot of times the stuff that works really well,
people find out.
Yeah,

1484
01:40:07.451 --> 01:40:10.810
it works really well because it's fucking steroids in it.
Yeah,
you could,

1485
01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:15.790
I mean it might not just be GNC,
just any vitamin store.
No,
not necessarily GNC,

1486
01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:18.040
but there's a bunch of illegal steroids at Gnc,

1487
01:40:18.041 --> 01:40:22.930
vitamin Shoppe and Walmart and more.
Yeah.
See,
this is very,
very common when you,

1488
01:40:22.931 --> 01:40:25.840
when you go to these places and buy these things,

1489
01:40:25.841 --> 01:40:29.800
there's a lot of stuff at a regular vitamin store that'll make you test positive

1490
01:40:29.801 --> 01:40:33.610
by Usada.
You'll test for banned substances from stuff you just buying a store.

1491
01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.640
<v 5>Yo,
you know,</v>

1492
01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:41.200
many times I think after this happened,

1493
01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:46.260
I think in many time imputation people from Cuba take it.

1494
01:40:47.771 --> 01:40:50.980
People say,
okay,
you are,
you are you,

1495
01:40:50.981 --> 01:40:55.900
you and you come to Cuba for maybe 20 days.

1496
01:40:57.610 --> 01:41:00.190
I wanted the people see because

1497
01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:05.830
the genetic for Cuba off the charts.

1498
01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:11.230
No.
For the no,
for the athletic people.
None of them.

1499
01:41:11.290 --> 01:41:15.880
Normally everybody normal.
Yeah.
Normal people imitation.

1500
01:41:17.290 --> 01:41:22.050
You need to see,
see an open mind.
Right.

1501
01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:25.840
He know.
That's what I say.
Well,

1502
01:41:25.870 --> 01:41:30.870
here's how much pain you need to pay for the soup for the [inaudible].

1503
01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:37.690
Come on,
man.
They don't have the money.
Come on man.

1504
01:41:38.090 --> 01:41:40.930
Did people don't have,
don't have anything.

1505
01:41:43.290 --> 01:41:44.123
<v 3>I know what you're saying.</v>

1506
01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:46.350
The other thing is you could take all the steroids in the world.

1507
01:41:46.351 --> 01:41:49.920
You're not going to look like you the way a person like you looks.

1508
01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:51.870
It has to be genetics,

1509
01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:55.480
[inaudible]

1510
01:41:58.530 --> 01:42:02.370
genetics.
It took a regular guy and gave him steroids.

1511
01:42:02.371 --> 01:42:06.810
You would never look like you if they do go home people not what I meant to the

1512
01:42:06.811 --> 01:42:10.740
methods.
Thyroid,

1513
01:42:10.750 --> 01:42:13.560
there's a lot of it is genetics and a lot of it is also,

1514
01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:16.050
you got to think from the time you were little,

1515
01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:21.030
you were involved in this intense athletic program.
Your body develop that way.

1516
01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:22.073
Can easy.

1517
01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:27.510
They could do the whole fico to neck to get dual equipped portfolio [inaudible]

1518
01:42:29.730 --> 01:42:34.500
cause it's Yotpo.

1519
01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:39.160
<v 5>no,
I wanted it.
No,

1520
01:42:39.161 --> 01:42:43.520
that invitation people from Kip.
I wonder,

1522
01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:49.540
I wanted to say and I want to see after after.

1523
01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:54.480

because this is my second full day for me.
You know I wanted to,

1524
01:42:54.490 --> 01:42:57.970
after they,
when I train it,
they,
when I beat him the barrel

1525
01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:00.161
because you know,

1526
01:43:00.161 --> 01:43:03.310
can put it everything what you're doing and to beat it with the people.

1527
01:43:03.311 --> 01:43:07.390
She I do a ds,
he did this and now he can be to him.
You understand what I say?

1528
01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:08.273
Yes.
Okay.

1529
01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:15.320
I wanted the imputation camera for me for three months.

1530
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:17.650
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1531
01:43:17.650 --> 01:43:19.810
<v 5>For three months.
I never take it.
Nothing.</v>

1532
01:43:20.290 --> 01:43:23.170
And now you see what I do understand.

1533
01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:27.220
Stop Talking Shit.
You understand?

1534
01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:32.420
<v 3>So people accused you of taking steroids after the tainted supplement thing,</v>

1535
01:43:34.230 --> 01:43:37.650
but you've never tested positive before or after.

1536
01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:39.720
<v 5>Aye.
I do for,</v>

1537
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:43.880
for the Olympic Commission test,

1538
01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:48.750
the [inaudible] from 95 he's been testing for the Olympics.

1539
01:43:49.190 --> 01:43:52.670
Did they mean by the woman picks?
I'm sorry.
Right.

1540
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:56.950
I know [inaudible] never,
he never came up positive,
you know?

1541
01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:00.380
But the thing is when someone looks at you,
cause you have so much muscle,

1542
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:02.090
they assume you're doing something.

1543
01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:05.370
They'll get the meat at least saying I in the winter.

1544
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:10.580
And if Jordan can you get out that said,
okay,
you have to me told me don't go

1545
01:44:12.130 --> 01:44:15.180
knock
on the door.

1546
01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:18.440
<v 1>Yeah,
the people phase where there's smoke,</v>

1547
01:44:18.441 --> 01:44:22.220
there's fire where the people think that if you're doing that,

1548
01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:24.470
can I just interject here for a second?

1549
01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:29.300
Cause Look Aoa seed by saying that I said I'll probably bio III.

I don't really know.
Sorry.
Did I say I'm not a racist.

1551
01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:37.820
I grew up with a lot of Cuban guys,
this dark skinned guys and uh,

1552
01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:38.773
it's amazing.

1553
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:43.820
But then you see somebody like to me when I look at a physical specimen,

1554
01:44:43.821 --> 01:44:47.450
I always compare it to Dave winfield.
You Remember Day Jordan feel,

1556
01:44:51.351 --> 01:44:55.070

dash and all that.

1559
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:07.400
But to me this is just me and I hope I don't get in trouble for saying this.

1560
01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:12.110
Look at day Winfield's baseball body.
He was sick.

Depending on how bad your eyes or hurt it might be over KDC that bring them

1700
01:54:37.890 --> 01:54:42.530
[inaudible].
We don't want to quite lamentable.

1701

Take a few minutes.

1703
01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:53.743
Okay.

1704
01:54:55.490 --> 01:55:00.190
I that and I said the one thing [inaudible] guy grabbing gloves.

1705

Cabasa if he punches you,
wear your gloves.

1707
01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:13.180
I want me holding on to your gloves if I'm punching you and I'm bawling on to

1708
01:55:13.181 --> 01:55:17.500
you.
Glove.
Is that illegally illegal?
Illegal.
Okay.
Okay.
[inaudible] Mario,

1709
01:55:17.950 --> 01:55:19.780
how much time should have taken off?

1710
01:55:20.530 --> 01:55:25.530
So what you're saying is you sat down for extra time in between the rounds

1711
01:55:27.821 --> 01:55:32.670
because he committed a foul right before that.
No,
no,
no,
no,

1712
01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:35.290
no,
no,
no gentleman gas on top.
What

1713
01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:41.770
he's asking you a question.
She,
we said say they would have stopped it,

1714
01:55:41.771 --> 01:55:44.070
but CLR Boudreau [inaudible]

1715
01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:47.390
<v 5>cutout.
If she had I been doing SMEs to,</v>

1716
01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:51.480
if the judge would have seen that came Mary [inaudible] ligament,

1717
01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:54.600
that he would've seen him ripping off his glove.
He gave me me and said,

1718
01:55:54.601 --> 01:55:57.780
I was so hoping he would've seen him punching him like,
no,

1719
01:55:57.810 --> 01:55:59.790
my mentor went to the input and the organization's not you.

1720
01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:01.890
How much time would he have taken?

1721
01:56:02.450 --> 01:56:05.090
<v 3>Well,
he should take points away.
This is what I think.</v>

1722
01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:08.570
I think anytime someone does a foul,
you just take points away,

1723
01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:13.310
click on the old deck,
kicking the balls,
point away,

1724
01:56:13.311 --> 01:56:16.910
poke in the eye,
point away.
Because even if you don't mean to do it,

1725
01:56:17.780 --> 01:56:20.180
even if you don't mean to do it,
the loss of sync,
get it.

1726
01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:24.010
It's still does damage and it's a foul foul.

1727
01:56:24.050 --> 01:56:25.730
So I think you should get a point taken away.

1728
01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:32.810
<v 5>My Jamaica,
he didn't say it.
She,
she knows me.
See?
No,
he has a bad ally.</v>

1729
01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:35.260
Bet She listen now,

1730
01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:39.350
but the fight ended poke a second.
I want gimbal because of the time,

1731
01:56:39.351 --> 01:56:42.920
and she know Julia,
but if not,
he would have lost the fight.

1732
01:56:44.090 --> 01:56:45.980
Right,
because you were hurt.

1733
01:56:49.810 --> 01:56:54.060
He punches him,
my boom.
See,

1734
01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:56.940
not by their name.
It's like,
oh,
did you already said lucid?

1735
01:56:56.950 --> 01:57:01.060
They fight at the time when the end that he would've lost the fun.
So

1736
01:57:01.810 --> 01:57:05.800
<v 3>round was over.
You sat down between rounds.</v>

1737
01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:06.753

1750
01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:54.100
but the cup man couldn't do it.

1751
01:57:54.101 --> 01:57:57.970
So then the other guy had to come [inaudible] the cup man had left already.

So did they cover you with water to give you extra time to do it?

1756
01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:17.890

[inaudible] Tim [inaudible] you can look at the top and inside panic domain.

1825
02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:49.880
Get out my wife Daggum anything to relax.

1826
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:52.190
I'm going to get up as soon as they fucking wipe me down.

1827
02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:55.250
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1828
02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:01.380
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1829
02:03:01.670 --> 02:03:05.210
he and and reality and think that Tim,

1830
02:03:07.010 --> 02:03:10.310
can you make it?
He had guys in the states.
Okay,
your three pence.

1831
02:03:10.311 --> 02:03:12.620
I'm the way that he was thinking,
Hey guys,

1832
02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:17.980
[inaudible] academy now he wants to come out to finish knocking me out,
right.

1833
02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:21.340
You know all the things that got them

1834
02:03:23.290 --> 02:03:25.930
through everything.
He's saying,
okay,
how come I didn't bring out all that?

1835
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.870
Let me let,
let me dry me off and then we'll fucking fight.
Right.

1836
02:03:30.020 --> 02:03:33.140
But there was only,
you only get one minute rest.

1837
02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:36.800
You were hurt at the end of the round.
There's only one minute rest.

1838
02:03:36.801 --> 02:03:40.040
But you took a minute and 30 seconds.
That extra 30 seconds had to help.

1839
02:03:40.340 --> 02:03:45.340
Cause he said [inaudible] [inaudible] but [inaudible] why not?

1840
02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:51.410
I said,
God,
I can see.
Yeah,
fuck yeah,
but enough for me.

1841
02:03:51.411 --> 02:03:55.830
Good problem is not his fault.
It's not your fault.
Let me go see,
see,

1842
02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:57.290
see you as a third lien bill.

1843
02:03:57.530 --> 02:04:02.490
If he would have been cleaned up and my colleague Tyler left,

1844
02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:04.250
then they can set it up and get them started with the set.

1845
02:04:04.251 --> 02:04:08.210
Go out and fight going to me the appointment.
Bill McCarthy.
Good video on my God,

1846
02:04:08.260 --> 02:04:12.950
my car.
Did he say go put it up on golf,
man,
they get 33 when he go,
he sees

1847
02:04:15.410 --> 02:04:17.750
and he stopped the 15 day you told him to slow down.

1848
02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:22.980
So you're saying that that was not a ploy in order to get you more arrest
Eczema?

1849
02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:27.200
I don't know a whole lot of that.
No,
no,
no.
Come on.
No,
no,
no.
For sure.

1850
02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:32.810
So the only other fight,
well that,
that was a,
that was a controversial moment.

1851
02:04:32.990 --> 02:04:36.440
You said that in the Robert Whitaker fight,
that was a very,

1852
02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:38.100
there was a experience for you.

1853
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:39.960
<v 1>You will,
cause you went five rounds,</v>

1854
02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:45.300
came very close to winning the interim title,
but came short.
Like what did you,

1855
02:04:45.301 --> 02:04:46.860
what did you get out of that fight?

1856
02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:50.960
Do you said there was a big learning experience for you?
They say,

1857
02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:53.250
because if we're a good lip at data with a guy through the hate,

1858
02:04:53.251 --> 02:04:57.390
the [inaudible] will not black at two,
two.

1859
02:04:58.530 --> 02:05:00.870
That was a big learning experience because going fine,

1860
02:05:01.740 --> 02:05:04.940
she'll be fine with Joel and I will not buy last set.
Got it up.

1861
02:05:05.020 --> 02:05:08.080
But I like that we have for housing called rounds.
Uh,

1862
02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:11.520
last night his managers said that after the fight,
when he saw him,

1863
02:05:12.090 --> 02:05:15.090
that he had a big smile on his face,
that one of his

1864
02:05:18.330 --> 02:05:20.760
content to see,
he was very happy.

1865
02:05:20.761 --> 02:05:24.970
He didn't take that last as serious as he should have booked.

1866
02:05:24.971 --> 02:05:26.070
Get to dock on dental.

1867
02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:30.360
<v 5>Is that same where they lose it one day you learn that</v>

1868
02:05:32.210 --> 02:05:36.960
and now you see what happened
with Luke Rockhold.
Yeah.

1869
02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:43.070
What did you learn in the Robert Whitaker fight about the timing,
timing,

1870
02:05:43.220 --> 02:05:45.220
timing,
timing.

1871
02:05:46.890 --> 02:05:49.640
You need it in a more calm down,
Lisa.

1872
02:05:49.850 --> 02:05:53.600
The people talk about my gas,
right?
But

1873
02:05:56.890 --> 02:06:01.060
the most,
what does that look at?
I'm being pulled that same team

1874
02:06:03.860 --> 02:06:05.660
Calu Rocco,
cal,

1875
02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:10.260
bill and up and they're getting this down.
Farcical,
my pencil.

1876
02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:11.990
Well,
the other thing was that

1877
02:06:12.710 --> 02:06:17.480
<v 1>Luke Rockhold didn't,
it wasn't as easy as it was to fight this fucking guy.</v>

1878
02:06:17.810 --> 02:06:19.970
You know,
he saw that it wasn't that easy.

1879
02:06:20.510 --> 02:06:22.900
<v 5>Hmm.
Can I go get my salary?</v>

1880
02:06:22.990 --> 02:06:27.990
Joe Jr on lean more than [inaudible] metal.

1881
02:06:28.330 --> 02:06:30.980
[inaudible] now he fed NCI,

1882
02:06:31.860 --> 02:06:34.500
mi manager middle.
He had a meal.

1883
02:06:37.870 --> 02:06:42.870
Quando [inaudible] Johnny called you over training was in Albuquerque with Jon

1884
02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:49.470
Jones Jovi.
He saw something.
I let come through lava.

1885
02:06:50.260 --> 02:06:52.830
No,
haddock is they control this attacks.

1886
02:06:54.060 --> 02:06:58.530
Quando when David [inaudible],
when he,
when he should attack,

1887
02:06:58.620 --> 02:07:03.010
he's learned that from John [inaudible] meal and that hadn't happened.
With that,

1888
02:07:03.370 --> 02:07:08.140
go,
go,
go,
go,
go,
go.
[inaudible] go,
go,

1889
02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:12.630
go nursing on monkey.
Now not going to tell you what,
if you tell somebody,
go,
go,

1890
02:07:12.631 --> 02:07:16.940
go.
Then I'll fucking machine looking like a fucking tie.
That's what happened.

1891
02:07:17.070 --> 02:07:22.070
You had to learn to pace yourself and don't say [inaudible] sync around.

1892
02:07:23.130 --> 02:07:23.881
Believe me.
Never.

1893
02:07:23.881 --> 02:07:28.881
Never worried about five bucks because I training everyday to ticket.

1894
02:07:29.711 --> 02:07:33.500
Then they program.
I see two solid community in his gas.
You didn't,

1895
02:07:34.090 --> 02:07:35.120
you didn't get that political power

1896
02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:37.073
<v 3>staff.
What?</v>

1897
02:07:38.170 --> 02:07:41.030
You have to be worried if he didn't know that you don't have gas in that.

1898
02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:45.630
I know have it programmed for five.
Come on.

1899
02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:50.830
The argument has always been the guy who has more muscle has a harder time

1900
02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:52.720
keeping a fast paced.

1901
02:07:53.050 --> 02:07:57.460
So what you've learned how to do is to pace yourself for your body type.

1902
02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.350
Does that make sense?
Decent Gullah.

1903
02:08:01.860 --> 02:08:03.990
[inaudible] [inaudible] bye bye for hot.

1904
02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:08.320
Say Lulu both cause look at too tired to tell these gender.

1905
02:08:08.321 --> 02:08:12.690
All I can do up to deal [inaudible] I can't think of that.

1906
02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:18.130
You know the,
the like a soccer group shot.
Remember when he fought?
No,

1907
02:08:18.250 --> 02:08:21.310
no.
The black dude with the crazy.
So could you,
so could you,

1908
02:08:21.311 --> 02:08:23.410
I mean when I show the show,
could you,
I turned the TV off.

1909
02:08:23.411 --> 02:08:26.920
I was so fucking scared.
You know what I'm saying?
Like I just turned the TV off.

1910
02:08:26.980 --> 02:08:31.110
Yeah,
he was a beast.
But after around and a half,
it contains a lot of oxygen.

1911
02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:34.370
I've learned that from you talking about the UFC that you need a lot of the

1912
02:08:34.380 --> 02:08:38.330
oxygen.
[inaudible]
no,

1913
02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:44.600
I'm going to class.
How many mouths to taking Minnie mouse,
Minnie mouse.

1914
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:45.760
The mouse

1915
02:08:48.290 --> 02:08:51.050
[inaudible] go,
go,
go.

1916
02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:55.750
Even have to tell him please.
You know,
but,

1917
02:08:56.200 --> 02:09:00.400
but to have all that muscle has,
it takes more endurance.
Right?

1918
02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:04.300
[inaudible] go ahead,
Mike.

1919
02:09:06.550 --> 02:09:11.540
To pay off is you have much more power and a lot by law.

1920
02:09:11.550 --> 02:09:16.090
I honestly,
I load my poet,
she come on,
come on.

1921
02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:18.930
The old team was looking at my boy can nail.
Okay,

1922
02:09:19.310 --> 02:09:24.310
going to clean because when people look at the thing and they'll pop Micah,

1923
02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:29.230
Micah,
mouse,
but I load the more direct that that thick.

1924
02:09:30.500 --> 02:09:31.750
She,
she,
she for sure.

1925
02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:37.080
So you've learned how to pace yourself for your body type and your style and now

1926
02:09:39.251 --> 02:09:41.320
like that five rounds with Whitaker.

1927
02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:45.130
That was a big learning experience for you in that way.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1928
02:09:45.310 --> 02:09:49.750
So now you're going to fight Whitaker again.
Yes.
Yes.
You look very excited.

1929
02:09:51.190 --> 02:09:55.800
I think if you win,
you will be the oldest guy to ever,

1930
02:09:55.870 --> 02:09:58.780
well,
maybe Randy couture when he won the heavyweight title,

1931
02:09:58.810 --> 02:10:01.870
but for sure middleweight you'll definitely be the oldest middleweight.

1932
02:10:01.930 --> 02:10:05.300
I think Randy was older when he won the heavyweight title when he,

1933
02:10:06.150 --> 02:10:09.800
my whole middle that,
oh yeah.

1934
02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:12.233
See,

1935
02:10:14.410 --> 02:10:19.410
I think Randy was (404) 064-0640 six Jesus Christ.

1936
02:10:21.460 --> 02:10:22.293
And he was a beast.

1937
02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:28.480
He's the band.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1938
02:10:28.510 --> 02:10:31.930
Fight was the first light heavyweight since losing to check his first fight.

1939
02:10:31.931 --> 02:10:35.590
It led to everyone around the beam,
the oldest fighter win a UFC belt.
No,
no,
no.

1940
02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:38.560
That's the EOC bout.
No,
no,
that's not what I meant.
Look at one.
He,

1941
02:10:38.561 --> 02:10:42.750
how old was he when he beat Tim Silvia?
I had championed typed in us before.

1942
02:10:42.900 --> 02:10:45.590
Find out he was when he be [inaudible].
You want it to be,

1943
02:10:47.570 --> 02:10:48.480
I think he was,

1944
02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:53.740
I want to say it was 44 I want to say it was 44 I think he might've been,

1945
02:10:55.550 --> 02:10:58.220
yeah,
45 and four months.

1946
02:10:58.370 --> 02:11:00.710
45 45 damn.

1947
02:11:00.711 --> 02:11:05.711
So He'd beat Tim Silvia for the heavyweight title when he's 45 now all due

1948
02:11:05.901 --> 02:11:08.960
respect,
you have to remember that there was the testing back then.

1949
02:11:08.961 --> 02:11:12.500
They just look at and yeah,
he look clean.
Just don't fucking testing.

1950
02:11:12.770 --> 02:11:16.190
They test you at the weigh ins.
That was it.
There was no random testing.

1951
02:11:16.191 --> 02:11:20.000
It was no usada it's a different ball game now.
As far as guys getting tested.

1952
02:11:20.620 --> 02:11:20.940
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1953
02:11:20.940 --> 02:11:25.940
<v 3>He gets tested the most and the UFC really [inaudible] cause look at you</v>

1954
02:11:30.420 --> 02:11:35.280
man.
Like I wish I'm mad dog two times a month.
Two Times a month.
Wow.

1955
02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:38.550
Male.
He Sung it.
JC piss and blood.

1956
02:11:38.700 --> 02:11:43.230
They just show up and say by that,
sorry.
Right now

1957
02:11:47.250 --> 02:11:50.910
all of us are going to get pissed.
Don't mix this test.

1958
02:11:50.911 --> 02:11:55.540
So we're going to have a real private,
you know,
it's a funny and

1959
02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:05.150
New York.
It's in New York,

1960
02:12:06.530 --> 02:12:09.740

1961
02:12:10.050 --> 02:12:14.420
On the it like right.

1974
02:13:05.721 --> 02:13:09.400
nowhere.
Like you love guys to sleep in the den and then,

1985
02:13:52.610 --> 02:13:55.850
And you haven't made the difference is though the wrestling is shorter time

1986
02:13:55.851 --> 02:14:00.430
periods.
But I told him no striking.
I wanted to do that.

1987
02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:04.993

I looked him around if you watched the last round where that made outlet quite

2001
02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:07.380
don't the fourth round he had Kinda,

2002

how does it come out in the fifth round?

2003
02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:16.830
And it's a joy put up a random if at all,
no matter what.
