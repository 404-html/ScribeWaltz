169
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.460

170
00:08:31.401 --> 00:08:32.540
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start your podcast.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

174
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.680

<v Speaker 2>so it's been six months essentially in </v>

177
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.520

<v Speaker 2>That's awesome though.</v>

178
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:50.660
<v Speaker 2>That's so cool that you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

179
00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:53.660
<v Speaker 2>you need something like this because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

180
00:08:53.661 --> 00:08:56.490
<v Speaker 2>whenever you deal with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>producers</v>

181
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>network folk think they mean well,</v>

182
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:06.050
<v Speaker 3>but they all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone has their own idea of what </v>

183
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.040
<v Speaker 3>should happen and even if they're nice </v>
<v Speaker 3>people it gets in the way.</v>

184
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.630
<v Speaker 3>It's so true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like I,</v>

00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:14.631
<v Speaker 3>you know right now I contribute to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to different television shows and I'm </v>

186
00:09:14.631 --> 00:09:17.370
<v Speaker 3>very lucky I'm a freelancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a contributor so I work on a show on</v>

188
00:09:22.371 --> 00:09:25.631
<v Speaker 3>magazine style show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I work on a local show here in </v>

<v Speaker 3>la called soquel connected,</v>

190
00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:27.830
<v Speaker 3>which used to be our pbs affiliate and </v>
<v Speaker 3>now it's just a,</v>

191
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a public television kind of standalone.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have great producers.</v>

193
00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 3>I get to self produce some stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's wonderful.</v>

194
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.300
<v Speaker 3>Prior to only doing those and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>

195
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:41.320
<v Speaker 3>I was full time on a show called take </v>
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>

196
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:42.750
<v Speaker 3>live on pivot TV.</v>

197
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.130
<v Speaker 3>That was daily eight to 12 hours a day </v>
<v Speaker 3>every day,</v>

198
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hair and makeup for two hours straight.</v>

199
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.870
<v Speaker 3>Basically two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

200
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:57.010
<v Speaker 3>Was trying to turn you into a werewolf </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying absolutely didn't look like he </v>

201
00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.920
<v Speaker 3>wasn't allowed to wear my hair straight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't allowed to wear black,</v>

202
00:09:58.921 --> 00:09:59.970
<v Speaker 3>wasn't a law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy.</v>

203
00:09:59.971 --> 00:10:02.190
<v Speaker 3>Like I couldn't have rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very strict.</v>

204
00:10:02.191 --> 00:10:07.191
<v Speaker 3>I could not be myself on that show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I look back and that is really when </v>

205
00:10:07.191 --> 00:10:09.420
<v Speaker 3>the podcast started because I was so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

206
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:14.750
<v Speaker 3>kind of boxed into speaking only in </v>
<v Speaker 3>sound bites and presenting a version of </v>

207
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:19.491
<v Speaker 3>myself that honestly I was not </v>
<v Speaker 3>comfortable really presenting the </v>

208
00:10:19.491 --> 00:10:22.650
<v Speaker 3>podcast was a really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really necessary outlet.</v>

209
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.680
<v Speaker 3>Like it was so psychologically freeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>for me and now I think it really helps </v>

210
00:10:27.781 --> 00:10:32.781
<v Speaker 3>keep me centered and anchored when I do </v>
<v Speaker 3>new jobs and new work to really </v>

211
00:10:32.781 --> 00:10:34.770
<v Speaker 3>understand how not to let things get out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of him like that.</v>

212
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.480
<v Speaker 3>The best representative of yourself is </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

213
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.820
<v Speaker 3>You got a bunch of people like deciding </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you should do.</v>

214
00:10:41.821 --> 00:10:45.690
<v Speaker 3>I think it'd be great if you wore pink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh look what you should be in paint that</v>

215
00:10:45.691 --> 00:10:47.930
<v Speaker 3>legitimate like I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They made me wear pain.</v>

216
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.270
<v Speaker 3>Like it was crazy and I had to wear my </v>
<v Speaker 3>hair out curly.</v>

217
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:54.570
<v Speaker 3>I read it and they hated that and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know,</v>

218
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:58.320
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's because I was the only girl</v>

219
00:10:58.321 --> 00:11:03.321
<v Speaker 3>on the show at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like very male heavy and I was </v>

220
00:11:03.321 --> 00:11:04.110
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be like the representative </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the female species,</v>

221
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:05.670
<v Speaker 3>which was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

222
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of a tomboy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it wasn't really working for me.</v>

223
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.640
<v Speaker 3>It was a lot of short skirts too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is weird for me.</v>

224
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:15.850
<v Speaker 3>Like I like to wear black leather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>

225
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:22.180
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we've talked about it many times in </v>

226
00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.210
<v Speaker 3>the podcast about how you watch Fox News</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all those women who like,</v>

227
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:28.220
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like they have it in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>contract that they have to uncross and </v>

228
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.771
<v Speaker 3>crossed her legs like a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of times per minute because it's like </v>

229
00:11:30.771 --> 00:11:33.980
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck is that uncomfortable that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're shifting and switching your legs </v>

230
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.520
<v Speaker 3>back and forth and if a man dressed like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

231
00:11:35.521 --> 00:11:37.380
<v Speaker 3>it would be so insane.</v>

232
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:42.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you imagine saying because there </v>

233
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:42.410
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

234
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.830
<v Speaker 3>if you watch runway shows ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you keep up with fashion at all.</v>

235
00:11:43.831 --> 00:11:48.090
<v Speaker 3>There are kind of male versions of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of ensemble,</v>

236
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.430
<v Speaker 3>but nobody actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's that in real life.</v>

237
00:11:50.431 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 3>Like the short kind of tight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe not up to</v>

238
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.380
<v Speaker 2>your nut sack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like halfway down your thigh,</v>

239
00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:58.560
<v Speaker 2>these little like plaid shorts and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>he will,</v>

240
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very runway,</v>

241
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.300
<v Speaker 2>but even those are shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something crazy about a skirt.</v>

242
00:12:04.301 --> 00:12:05.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

243
00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:09.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just like easy access.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the most ridiculous invention.</v>

244
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like your vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is your coveted sexual organ.</v>

245
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:14.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>

246
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:20.190
<v Speaker 2>this is where the babies come out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where you let the loved ones in </v>

247
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:24.750
<v Speaker 2>this so much to the vagina and yet it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>there protected by the thinnest piece of</v>

248
00:12:24.821 --> 00:12:25.510
<v Speaker 2>fabric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

249
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:30.650
<v Speaker 2>if we've seen all these little teeny </v>
<v Speaker 2>bopper celebrities and their little </v>

250
00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:34.780
<v Speaker 2>woopsies getting in and out of cars </v>
<v Speaker 2>oopsies where there just happened to be </v>

251
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:35.740
<v Speaker 2>cameras right down near the vagina is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

252
00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:38.280
<v Speaker 2>that's not a website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such shit was engineered.</v>

253
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.960
<v Speaker 2>What's the reasoning behind that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should have a cooter.</v>

254
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.120
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people want to look at it.</v>

255
00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that to be Clark Clark with</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

256
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:53.340
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget what he said about </v>
<v Speaker 2>vaginas because he's of a different </v>

257
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:53.490
<v Speaker 2>persuasion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes firsthand saw vagina.</v>

258
00:12:53.491 --> 00:12:55.290
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when's it going to heal?</v>

259
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:04.520
<v Speaker 2>But it is a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that you're presented as a </v>

260
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.360
<v Speaker 2>serious journalist on Fox News or as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroscientist,</v>

261
00:13:07.361 --> 00:13:12.361
<v Speaker 2>which is what you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet they want you to have your </v>

262
00:13:12.361 --> 00:13:15.130
<v Speaker 2>vagina basically just barely protected </v>
<v Speaker 2>by a little,</v>

263
00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.420
<v Speaker 2>a little napkin that they throw over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

264
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.260
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And always the cameras are,</v>

265
00:13:20.261 --> 00:13:21.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right at the midlines,</v>

266
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:26.050
<v Speaker 2>the midline of the table and so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like an unflattering or,</v>

267
00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:31.120
<v Speaker 2>or ultra flattering depending on how you</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at an angle that just makes you </v>

268
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.660
<v Speaker 2>feel really exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

269
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:37.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you supposed to take somebody </v>

270
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:37.020
<v Speaker 2>seriously?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it's.</v>

271
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:37.210
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make you any hotter.</v>

272
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.920
<v Speaker 2>That's where people are confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

273
00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:45.040
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a little better sometimes </v>

274
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:45.130
<v Speaker 2>to leave things up to the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

275
00:13:45.131 --> 00:13:46.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

276
00:13:46.151 --> 00:13:50.890
<v Speaker 2>no it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying like maybe not on tv,</v>

277
00:13:50.891 --> 00:13:53.470
<v Speaker 2>on the news news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your.</v>

278
00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:54.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your objective?</v>

279
00:13:54.611 --> 00:13:56.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it better in real life?</v>

280
00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

281
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.370
<v Speaker 2>Well I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depends on what you're trying to do,</v>

282
00:14:00.371 --> 00:14:03.580
<v Speaker 2>but if you're on a show where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just trying to like talk about issues,</v>

283
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:08.730
<v Speaker 2>it's distracting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's distracting to have like this </v>

284
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.791
<v Speaker 2>really sexy outfit on and I think that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>half the reason why these fucking Fox </v>

285
00:14:11.791 --> 00:14:16.470
<v Speaker 2>News type shows do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barbara Walters never dressed like that </v>

286
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.470
<v Speaker 2>can be corrected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she,</v>

287
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not too too scandalous.</v>

288
00:14:18.581 --> 00:14:20.830
<v Speaker 2>But she did wear short skirts and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually just watching,</v>

289
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.150
<v Speaker 2>so I'm gonna get a little more </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable.</v>

290
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm very short and I feel tiny in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>chair.</v>

291
00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:28.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm just crossing my legs.</v>

292
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:33.340
<v Speaker 2>So I was watching this documentary </v>
<v Speaker 2>called misrepresentation.</v>

293
00:14:33.341 --> 00:14:38.341
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm about to get like super feminist on </v>

294
00:14:38.341 --> 00:14:39.550
<v Speaker 2>the show really early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so I can piss off like everybody on</v>

295
00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:40.590
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

296
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.140
<v Speaker 2>so actually really good documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called misrepresentation.</v>

297
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:48.270
<v Speaker 2>You can find it on Netflix and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>produced and I'm kind of narrated by </v>

298
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Jennifer Siebel newsome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who Gavin newsome's wife and</v>

299
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.240
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing is kind of about media </v>
<v Speaker 3>representations of women,</v>

300
00:14:56.241 --> 00:14:59.210
<v Speaker 3>how women are portrayed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how women,</v>

301
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make up x amount of the population,</v>

302
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:07.571
<v Speaker 3>x amount of the jobs in this field and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this field and this field and then how </v>

303
00:15:07.571 --> 00:15:10.451
<v Speaker 3>they're represented both in fictional </v>
<v Speaker 3>television but also in nonfiction </v>

304
00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:11.960
<v Speaker 3>programming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they talk a little bit about that,</v>

305
00:15:11.961 --> 00:15:15.800
<v Speaker 3>kind of why our female news readers </v>
<v Speaker 3>meant to look.</v>

306
00:15:15.801 --> 00:15:20.801
<v Speaker 3>So I'm sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always kind of like the crusty old </v>

307
00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:23.510
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then like his hot and nice,</v>

308
00:15:23.511 --> 00:15:25.110
<v Speaker 3>like that's what it looks like when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>look it up,</v>

309
00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:27.470
<v Speaker 3>a news reading team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

310
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.500
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have these great interviews </v>

311
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.751
<v Speaker 3>with people like Lisa Ling and Katie </v>
<v Speaker 3>couric and kind of talking about Katie </v>

312
00:15:34.751 --> 00:15:39.580
<v Speaker 3>actually is very open and says I kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel guilty like almost I played into </v>

313
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.300
<v Speaker 3>this like maybe I set this trend in </v>
<v Speaker 3>motion and um,</v>

314
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:43.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was fit.</v>

315
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.320
<v Speaker 3>I wore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

316
00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.840
<v Speaker 3>not ridiculously short skirts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you could see my legs on TV.</v>

317
00:15:47.841 --> 00:15:52.841
<v Speaker 3>And then it seems like that's now the </v>
<v Speaker 3>formula that every news reader has to </v>

318
00:15:52.841 --> 00:15:53.570
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you almost just assumed that they're</v>

319
00:15:53.571 --> 00:15:55.110
<v Speaker 3>dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it,</v>

320
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.570
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it portrays.</v>

321
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:59.240
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it portrays strength.</v>

322
00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.380
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you have these girls that are women</v>

323
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:06.050
<v Speaker 3>that look like they're trying so hard to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be sexy,</v>

324
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.870
<v Speaker 3>then all of a sudden it puts it in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>head like,</v>

325
00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:13.871
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's just reading a script that </v>

326
00:16:13.871 --> 00:16:13.871
<v Speaker 3>somebody else wrote for her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When sometimes these are really,</v>

327
00:16:13.871 --> 00:16:15.770
<v Speaker 3>really bright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really successful women.</v>

328
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:21.500
<v Speaker 3>Like why do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or just they just want people to watch </v>

329
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.420
<v Speaker 3>it and they just feel like the best way </v>
<v Speaker 3>to hook people is sex.</v>

330
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

331
00:16:24.281 --> 00:16:26.600
<v Speaker 3>and the truth is they also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the documentary,</v>

332
00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:29.240
<v Speaker 3>they showed all of the major news </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporation,</v>

333
00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:30.710
<v Speaker 3>which there aren't that many anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

334
00:16:30.711 --> 00:16:33.710
<v Speaker 3>they've been kind of conglomerating and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

335
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:39.100
<v Speaker 3>more and more of the property is owned </v>
<v Speaker 3>by less and less people and they showed </v>

336
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.821
<v Speaker 3>the number of women on the board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the board of all of these different </v>

337
00:16:42.821 --> 00:16:42.821
<v Speaker 3>news organizations.</v>

338
00:16:42.821 --> 00:16:47.380
<v Speaker 3>And so you look at like Time Warner or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at Viacom and it's like one </v>

339
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:47.660
<v Speaker 3>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two women,</v>

340
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:52.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to women and as opposed to like 30 men </v>

341
00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:56.750
<v Speaker 3>are 15 men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that are making the shows and</v>

342
00:16:56.751 --> 00:17:01.751
<v Speaker 3>the people who have ultimate control </v>
<v Speaker 3>over those kinds of decisions </v>

343
00:17:01.751 --> 00:17:03.200
<v Speaker 3>historically and to this day are like 99</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent male.</v>

344
00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.780
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that's why I like women like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Megan Kelly,</v>

345
00:17:05.781 --> 00:17:09.500
<v Speaker 3>that Fox lady who's not at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's very sharp.</v>

346
00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:14.860
<v Speaker 3>She's kind of mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of got an edge to her wonder if </v>

347
00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:15.860
<v Speaker 3>it's like to like let you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey fuck face.</v>

348
00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:19.680
<v Speaker 3>Just because I've got my tits hanging </v>
<v Speaker 3>out in my legs are crisscrossed,</v>

349
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
<v Speaker 3>barely covered my cooter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll still put you in your place where </v>

350
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.720
<v Speaker 3>she's on her heels all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd always backed up.</v>

351
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:31.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's an uncommon feeling </v>

352
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:32.440
<v Speaker 3>for women who are just in a position </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they're surrounded by men who just</v>

353
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:37.450
<v Speaker 3>are going to assume when they walk in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the door that she's just dumb bimbos </v>

354
00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:37.580
<v Speaker 3>she's a weather girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a news reader,</v>

355
00:17:37.581 --> 00:17:42.581
<v Speaker 3>but really she's writing her own copy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and doing her own research and it a </v>

356
00:17:42.581 --> 00:17:42.581
<v Speaker 3>really strong smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

357
00:17:42.581 --> 00:17:44.990
<v Speaker 3>I disagree with like fucking everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>she says,</v>

358
00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen her be a total brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 3>on air before.</v>

359
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.210
<v Speaker 2>She's slightly more rational than most </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the people in that network.</v>

360
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.370
<v Speaker 2>That's not saying much because she can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be pretty rational,</v>

361
00:17:56.371 --> 00:17:56.950
<v Speaker 2>but she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

362
00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.540
<v Speaker 2>she's right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just,</v>

363
00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:03.390
<v Speaker 2>that's her thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like a real Santa Claus is white.</v>

364
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.400
<v Speaker 2>Is that her kapow she's hot as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very distracting,</v>

365
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:09.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

366
00:18:09.751 --> 00:18:12.070
<v Speaker 2>But it's also usually looks like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

367
00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:15.080
<v Speaker 2>That's what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just fucking work it all the way deep.</v>

368
00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She should do the news from a bed all </v>

369
00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.210
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the news should be done from silk </v>

370
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:23.210
<v Speaker 2>sheets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got her tits highlighted.</v>

371
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:23.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she does.</v>

372
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:24.120
<v Speaker 2>They're different colored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

373
00:18:24.121 --> 00:18:25.020
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

374
00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:26.200
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wardrobe,</v>

375
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:31.210
<v Speaker 2>dry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She basically has a two tone thing with </v>

376
00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.400
<v Speaker 2>the tits or impossible to not look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't blend in at all.</v>

377
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.350
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they really push you.</v>

378
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:39.330
<v Speaker 2>I remember on um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take part live one day wearing one of my</v>

379
00:18:39.331 --> 00:18:41.580
<v Speaker 2>favorite looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was like black pants,</v>

380
00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:46.581
<v Speaker 2>high heels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a white button down shirt that was </v>

381
00:18:46.581 --> 00:18:46.581
<v Speaker 2>fitted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that the outfit was,</v>

382
00:18:46.581 --> 00:18:49.230
<v Speaker 2>I consider it like a hot outfit and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>black tie and,</v>

383
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:54.250
<v Speaker 2>but I had my hair braided and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulled back and I was wearing glasses </v>

384
00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.740
<v Speaker 2>and my producer told me that I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>dress like that anymore because it was </v>

385
00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.330
<v Speaker 2>too masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look like a girl.</v>

386
00:19:00.331 --> 00:19:02.220
<v Speaker 2>Like it's obvious that I'm not trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a dude.</v>

387
00:19:02.221 --> 00:19:04.000
<v Speaker 2>I like to wear ties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Producer guy.</v>

388
00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:04.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

389
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.900
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to say no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't.</v>

390
00:19:06.901 --> 00:19:07.610
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

391
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he really was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

392
00:19:09.061 --> 00:19:12.660
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't for sure he wasn't where he </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought you look masculine like that.</v>

393
00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:13.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

394
00:19:13.791 --> 00:19:18.791
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like put on a short skirt and and </v>

395
00:19:18.791 --> 00:19:18.791
<v Speaker 2>you get that thing to where even if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't overtly tell you,</v>

396
00:19:18.791 --> 00:19:23.751
<v Speaker 2>it's like you get off air every night </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you're dressed in an outfit </v>

397
00:19:23.751 --> 00:19:24.900
<v Speaker 2>that you love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like pants a shirt,</v>

398
00:19:24.901 --> 00:19:29.901
<v Speaker 2>like you feel comfortable but you feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>good about yourself and you look in the </v>

399
00:19:29.901 --> 00:19:29.901
<v Speaker 2>mirror and you think your body looks </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

400
00:19:29.901 --> 00:19:30.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

401
00:19:30.511 --> 00:19:35.511
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show whatever you were like the dumbest </v>

402
00:19:35.511 --> 00:19:37.971
<v Speaker 2>little short pink skirt or dress that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're totally uncomfortable in and </v>

403
00:19:37.971 --> 00:19:41.631
<v Speaker 2>you're not acting like yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look great to know like in your ifb,</v>

404
00:19:41.701 --> 00:19:44.790
<v Speaker 2>like in your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your ears,</v>

405
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.760
<v Speaker 2>because they're constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like in your ear,</v>

406
00:19:47.761 --> 00:19:52.350
<v Speaker 2>like that's gross to the ifps are gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's horrible having someone talk</v>

407
00:19:52.351 --> 00:19:57.351
<v Speaker 2>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're in the middle of a </v>

408
00:19:57.351 --> 00:19:59.510
<v Speaker 2>conversation and they're difficult that </v>
<v Speaker 2>or don't say this or bringing this back </v>

409
00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.140
<v Speaker 2>and bring up that are asked this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tough.</v>

410
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:06.350
<v Speaker 2>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when there's tension between </v>

411
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.870
<v Speaker 2>you and your producer when not hiding </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

412
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.500
<v Speaker 2>When I do post fight interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I first started doing it,</v>

413
00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:13.200
<v Speaker 2>they used to talk to me in my ear like </v>
<v Speaker 2>way back in the day,</v>

414
00:20:13.201 --> 00:20:18.201
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes it'd be in midsentence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there'd be some fucking clueless </v>

415
00:20:18.201 --> 00:20:18.201
<v Speaker 2>shithead on the other end.</v>

416
00:20:18.201 --> 00:20:22.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't happened in decades because </v>

417
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:22.860
<v Speaker 2>then the new guys are awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guys that have been doing it for,</v>

418
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.660
<v Speaker 2>but in the nineties when I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be a guy talking.</v>

419
00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.450
<v Speaker 2>I literally had to take the thing out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>my ear because I couldn't concentrate on</v>

420
00:20:27.451 --> 00:20:32.451
<v Speaker 2>what I was saying and they have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>meltdown in the booth when they see you </v>

421
00:20:32.451 --> 00:20:32.451
<v Speaker 2>take it out of your year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it's like.</v>

422
00:20:32.451 --> 00:20:34.260
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You literally can't form a sentence.</v>

423
00:20:34.261 --> 00:20:36.180
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're doing post fight interviews,</v>

424
00:20:36.181 --> 00:20:38.820
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it in real time off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cuff,</v>

425
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:43.850
<v Speaker 2>completely ad libbed and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're asking questions and adjusting </v>

426
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:48.081
<v Speaker 2>based on how the fighter talks to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand like even a good </v>

427
00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 2>producer will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

428
00:20:48.311 --> 00:20:49.810
<v Speaker 2>I never talked to you while you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking.</v>

429
00:20:49.811 --> 00:20:51.280
<v Speaker 2>I wait until you stop talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

430
00:20:51.281 --> 00:20:56.281
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have to fucking hear with the </v>

431
00:20:56.281 --> 00:20:56.281
<v Speaker 2>person I'm interviewing says to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you literally can't hear you.</v>

432
00:20:56.281 --> 00:20:58.010
<v Speaker 2>Someone to talk to you here and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking.</v>

433
00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:58.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

434
00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:03.841
<v Speaker 2>you can't hear it all and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing that show I was on </v>

435
00:21:03.841 --> 00:21:05.560
<v Speaker 2>was a live show every night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I get it counting down to commercial.</v>

436
00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.870
<v Speaker 2>The things where you have to keep time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey guys,</v>

437
00:21:07.871 --> 00:21:09.940
<v Speaker 2>we gotta wrap it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've only got a minute left.</v>

438
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:15.030
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like just the talking and the </v>

439
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:15.370
<v Speaker 2>talking or you should say this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like fuck you.</v>

440
00:21:15.371 --> 00:21:17.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to say that to say what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to say.</v>

441
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:19.180
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the beautiful thing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet.</v>

442
00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:24.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beautiful thing about the internet </v>

443
00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:24.700
<v Speaker 2>and producing your own show and creating</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own show is I kind of look at those</v>

444
00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:29.701
<v Speaker 2>old shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shows that have been around for a </v>

445
00:21:29.701 --> 00:21:31.471
<v Speaker 2>long time like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially those news type shows we </v>

446
00:21:31.471 --> 00:21:32.650
<v Speaker 2>talked about like the the uncle and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>niece and the like,</v>

447
00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:36.430
<v Speaker 2>that kind of weird format where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk fake and it's everything.</v>

448
00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Seven minutes cut to commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that's a dinosaur.</v>

449
00:21:39.581 --> 00:21:44.581
<v Speaker 2>I really don't think that's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't think it's going to last </v>

450
00:21:44.581 --> 00:21:45.910
<v Speaker 2>for people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of our generation.</v>

451
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:50.940
<v Speaker 2>I use that loosely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think most of middle America is </v>

452
00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.761
<v Speaker 2>still watching that kind of traditional </v>
<v Speaker 2>television in America gets the Internet </v>

453
00:21:53.761 --> 00:21:53.761
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>

454
00:21:53.761 --> 00:21:54.220
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

455
00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:57.670
<v Speaker 2>America is not middle America anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most of middle America,</v>

456
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're watching what's on because it's </v>

457
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:03.820
<v Speaker 2>always been there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people are way more hip.</v>

458
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:04.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

459
00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.760
<v Speaker 2>But tell him when you go on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you feel it,</v>

460
00:22:06.761 --> 00:22:11.761
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go to Ohio and all these </v>

461
00:22:11.761 --> 00:22:12.430
<v Speaker 2>different places like that used to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a little behind.</v>

462
00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:17.431
<v Speaker 2>They're not really behind anymore and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of fucking slick people </v>

463
00:22:17.431 --> 00:22:17.431
<v Speaker 2>that are living in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nowhere.</v>

464
00:22:17.431 --> 00:22:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

465
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:19.150
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what's great about </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

466
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:24.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got rid of cable from my first </v>

467
00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.101
<v Speaker 2>time in for once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like choosing what I want to watch </v>

468
00:22:26.101 --> 00:22:26.101
<v Speaker 2>instead of just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

469
00:22:26.101 --> 00:22:27.760
<v Speaker 2>what's on TV right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're kind of directing,</v>

470
00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.400
<v Speaker 2>but what are these Middle America people</v>
<v Speaker 2>picking out?</v>

471
00:22:30.401 --> 00:22:32.860
<v Speaker 2>Stupid Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I wanna watch this.</v>

472
00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Slowly but surely though they're getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>more hip.</v>

473
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:36.670
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so too.</v>

474
00:22:36.671 --> 00:22:38.170
<v Speaker 2>I think part of the problem though is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

475
00:22:38.171 --> 00:22:43.171
<v Speaker 2>I mean you look at the statistics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Fox News is still the most watched news </v>

476
00:22:43.331 --> 00:22:48.331
<v Speaker 2>network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what does that say about our </v>

477
00:22:48.331 --> 00:22:48.331
<v Speaker 2>country?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What says?</v>

478
00:22:48.331 --> 00:22:51.751
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't really know what the fuck </v>

479
00:22:51.751 --> 00:22:51.751
<v Speaker 2>people are watching because the Nielsen </v>
<v Speaker 2>ratings are ridiculous.</v>

480
00:22:51.751 --> 00:22:53.260
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the most antiquated way of figuring</v>

481
00:22:53.261 --> 00:22:58.261
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the only thing that's worse is the </v>

482
00:22:58.261 --> 00:23:00.380
<v Speaker 2>arbitron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they try to figure out who's </v>

483
00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:00.380
<v Speaker 2>listening to radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Shit's ridiculous.</v>

484
00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.690
<v Speaker 2>I could give you a book and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to carry it around and write </v>

485
00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:04.710
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you listened to this channel,</v>

486
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.670
<v Speaker 2>when you listen to that channel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't fucking know.</v>

487
00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:12.220
<v Speaker 2>What ends up happening is that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>represent themselves to be different </v>

488
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:12.220
<v Speaker 2>than they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

489
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.991
<v Speaker 2>I love NPR when they like never listened</v>
<v Speaker 2>to npr because they think it looks good </v>

490
00:23:15.991 --> 00:23:20.031
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's that thing that they do on </v>

491
00:23:20.031 --> 00:23:21.730
<v Speaker 2>networks as well where they'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll like,</v>

492
00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:24.070
<v Speaker 2>if you're on a talk show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the.</v>

493
00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:29.130
<v Speaker 2>They have the ratings based on how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are watching up into a certain </v>

494
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:33.691
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's why the tonight show has a </v>

495
00:23:33.691 --> 00:23:35.521
<v Speaker 2>20 minute break because 15 minutes in is</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they do their first rating so they </v>

496
00:23:35.521 --> 00:23:40.231
<v Speaker 2>don't want to cut to commercial because </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you'll change the channel fuck up </v>

497
00:23:40.231 --> 00:23:43.171
<v Speaker 2>the ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have this 20 minute things so </v>

498
00:23:43.171 --> 00:23:43.171
<v Speaker 2>everything is geared towards like keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching us,</v>

499
00:23:43.171 --> 00:23:43.450
<v Speaker 2>look at us.</v>

500
00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.450
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do something crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they just.</v>

501
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:51.350
<v Speaker 2>It's like sweeps every night duties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do anything to try to get you to hang in</v>

502
00:23:51.351 --> 00:23:56.351
<v Speaker 2>there for 20 minutes and then they'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring someone on and that's what the </v>

503
00:23:56.351 --> 00:23:59.711
<v Speaker 2>skirts are all about and that's why you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have all these people that their </v>

504
00:23:59.711 --> 00:24:02.660
<v Speaker 2>sensibility is not based on what's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best way to get caris thoughts out.</v>

505
00:24:02.661 --> 00:24:05.090
<v Speaker 2>What's the best way to get megan's </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts out?</v>

506
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:10.270
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I get someone to watch this </v>

507
00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:10.270
<v Speaker 2>chick?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

508
00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.760
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also there is a problem I think </v>

509
00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:12.760
<v Speaker 2>where people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

510
00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.811
<v Speaker 2>well people in the industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you talk to them about </v>

511
00:24:16.811 --> 00:24:16.811
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

512
00:24:16.811 --> 00:24:16.811
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

513
00:24:16.811 --> 00:24:18.740
<v Speaker 2>We just give people what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you look at like bad reality tv where</v>

514
00:24:18.741 --> 00:24:22.130
<v Speaker 2>there's cat fights and humiliation </v>
<v Speaker 2>television and all the shit that,</v>

515
00:24:22.131 --> 00:24:23.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Kardashians,</v>

516
00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:28.061
<v Speaker 2>all the shit that we're like a breaks my</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart that this is so popular in </v>

517
00:24:28.061 --> 00:24:28.061
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

518
00:24:28.061 --> 00:24:31.960
<v Speaker 2>And then people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's what the people want and </v>

519
00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:31.960
<v Speaker 2>we're just answering to what their needs</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

520
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not actually effecting any sort of</v>

521
00:24:34.431 --> 00:24:36.990
<v Speaker 2>social change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just playing into the hands of,</v>

522
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.540
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what they're interested in.</v>

523
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:43.750
<v Speaker 2>But I say that that's fucking bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we have an illusion of choice in</v>

524
00:24:43.971 --> 00:24:47.960
<v Speaker 2>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we don't have viable options.</v>

525
00:24:47.961 --> 00:24:51.140
<v Speaker 2>If I want to watch the news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've either got Fox News,</v>

526
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:56.470
<v Speaker 2>MSNBC or CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the things that are easy for </v>

527
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.540
<v Speaker 2>me to find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably,</v>

528
00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.600
<v Speaker 2>unless I haven't expanded cable package,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have al Jazeera or BBC World News </v>

529
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.490
<v Speaker 2>or another option or rt or another </v>
<v Speaker 2>option available to me.</v>

530
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.870
<v Speaker 2>So I'm watching this programming that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>no longer even news.</v>

531
00:25:08.871 --> 00:25:13.871
<v Speaker 2>It's just fucking advertiser blow jobs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like ratings run offs.</v>

532
00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our team,</v>

533
00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:21.210
<v Speaker 2>an interesting example is kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up channel that rt is very like </v>

534
00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:25.480
<v Speaker 2>in the one hand there's amazing </v>
<v Speaker 2>reporting happening there and in the </v>

535
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.110
<v Speaker 2>other hand it's like answers to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kremlin.</v>

536
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.900
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abby Martin is a friend of mine.</v>

537
00:25:29.901 --> 00:25:34.901
<v Speaker 2>She's been on the show several times and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's great and she's one of the rare </v>

538
00:25:34.901 --> 00:25:35.540
<v Speaker 2>people that can kind of dress however </v>
<v Speaker 2>she wants.</v>

539
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:38.010
<v Speaker 2>She dresses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she wore slacks should wear.</v>

540
00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's very pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she'll wear,</v>

541
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:41.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll wear something that makes it look</v>

542
00:25:41.871 --> 00:25:44.990
<v Speaker 2>hot and then if that's what she wants to</v>
<v Speaker 2>wear or she'll wear something different.</v>

543
00:25:44.991 --> 00:25:49.040
<v Speaker 2>But she has a weird situation there too </v>
<v Speaker 2>where she's criticized Russia,</v>

544
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:52.380
<v Speaker 2>like especially what's going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine and you know,</v>

545
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:54.200
<v Speaker 2>and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to send you to the Ukraine.</v>

546
00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:55.010
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

547
00:25:55.011 --> 00:25:55.490
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

549
00:25:57.231 --> 00:26:02.231

<v Speaker 2>They like made a publicly or press </v>

550
00:26:02.231 --> 00:26:06.190
<v Speaker 2>statement because she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was criticizing Putin's </v>

551
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:08.040
<v Speaker 2>administration and what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was going on and you know,</v>

553
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:12.980
<v Speaker 2>She did this thing and so they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to send her to,</v>

554
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:16.010
<v Speaker 2>to Crimea so she can see what it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the ground.</v>

00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:57.801
<v Speaker 2>they've told me some pretty interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories too about our t and a lot of </v>

572
00:26:57.801 --> 00:26:57.801
<v Speaker 2>stuff has been leaked lately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you see it,</v>

573
00:26:57.801 --> 00:27:02.690
<v Speaker 2>like the reporters there have been more </v>
<v Speaker 2>and more open about the fact that </v>

574
00:27:02.941 --> 00:27:07.050
<v Speaker 2>there's an obvious agenda at that news </v>
<v Speaker 2>network and I feel like when it comes to</v>

575
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:10.410
<v Speaker 2>Russia reporting you have to take it </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a huge grain of salt,</v>

576
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.120
<v Speaker 2>but they do a good job of investigative </v>
<v Speaker 2>reporting in other parts of the world.</v>

577
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:20.390
<v Speaker 2>And also what's interesting is everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>that knows about our t primarily knows </v>

578
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:22.200
<v Speaker 2>about it from clips that were released </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Internet.</v>

579
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

580
00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.290
<v Speaker 2>they're really good about their social </v>
<v Speaker 2>media and videos.</v>

581
00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:31.380
<v Speaker 2>It's a big reality when it comes to all </v>
<v Speaker 2>those new shows too and all those </v>

582
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:35.600
<v Speaker 2>tonight show and talk shows their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their whole thing is get a clip that </v>

583
00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:39.411
<v Speaker 2>pops it completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that you could put on </v>

584
00:27:39.411 --> 00:27:42.351
<v Speaker 2>television and the or put on television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then people will make a clip of it </v>

585
00:27:42.351 --> 00:27:43.980
<v Speaker 2>and put it on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean look at Snl,</v>

586
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:47.490
<v Speaker 2>obviously people still watch it if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to believe Nielsen ratings,</v>

587
00:27:47.491 --> 00:27:52.491
<v Speaker 2>but like that show is not good anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't been good in a really long </v>

588
00:27:52.491 --> 00:27:55.521
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they really reinvented themselves </v>

589
00:27:55.521 --> 00:27:56.670
<v Speaker 2>with the digital shorts a few years ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>and as those were getting released,</v>

590
00:27:56.671 --> 00:28:00.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was this new kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>resurgence of young people being like,</v>

591
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:02.370
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snl is actually funny.</v>

592
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.980
<v Speaker 2>It's not so kind of worn out and old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

593
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:10.990
<v Speaker 2>it's the whole problem with this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of problems but trying </v>

594
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:14.181
<v Speaker 2>to do a new show every week and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>just doing it live in front of an </v>

595
00:28:14.181 --> 00:28:14.220
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a terrible idea and they don't have</v>

596
00:28:14.221 --> 00:28:16.140
<v Speaker 2>any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like make it a half hour show.</v>

597
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:21.200
<v Speaker 2>Like don't make it an out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what ends up happening is they </v>

598
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:21.480
<v Speaker 2>have good ideas for clips and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

599
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.400
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single sketch,</v>

600
00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:28.401
<v Speaker 2>they just run it into the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like they get the joke and </v>

601
00:28:28.401 --> 00:28:32.151
<v Speaker 2>then they repeat it 10 times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also like a super competitive </v>

602
00:28:32.151 --> 00:28:34.830
<v Speaker 2>environment and you know Phil Hartman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a good friend of mine,</v>

603
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:40.030
<v Speaker 2>we were on Newsradio together and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Saturday night live and he had a </v>

604
00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:43.760
<v Speaker 2>nightmare stories like after talking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>him about what it was like the </v>

605
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.380
<v Speaker 2>backstabbing and all the weird behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>the scenes shit that goes on.</v>

606
00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:51.380
<v Speaker 2>People trying to force their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their sketches in and other people cock </v>

607
00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:51.380
<v Speaker 2>blocking them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>

608
00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.550
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds horrible.</v>

609
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:57.590
<v Speaker 2>Worst thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst way to come up with something </v>

610
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.871
<v Speaker 2>creative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they have this like weird </v>

611
00:28:59.871 --> 00:28:59.871
<v Speaker 2>competitive environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like no one's supporting it.</v>

612
00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:00.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it is there now,</v>

613
00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:02.910
<v Speaker 2>but he told me some nightmare stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

614
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.700
<v Speaker 2>there were times when it was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing,</v>

615
00:29:05.701 --> 00:29:08.580
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was.</v>

616
00:29:08.581 --> 00:29:10.530
<v Speaker 2>There were some times Eddie Murphy days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

617
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

618
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:16.550
<v Speaker 2>you're always going to have talented </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are capable of being funny </v>

619
00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:19.011
<v Speaker 2>under extreme circumstances can put them</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the worst scenario and they could </v>

620
00:29:19.011 --> 00:29:19.980
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to make something funny </v>
<v Speaker 2>occasionally,</v>

621
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:25.010
<v Speaker 2>but you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it would be better if it were much </v>

622
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:25.010
<v Speaker 2>looser,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's TV.</v>

623
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:29.490
<v Speaker 2>Be Better if they had time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you need to work on a sketch like a</v>

624
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:34.610
<v Speaker 2>once a month sign and drive specials </v>
<v Speaker 2>would probably be a fucking nuclear </v>

625
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:34.610
<v Speaker 2>bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was really bad.</v>

626
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:38.750
<v Speaker 2>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people have these expectations and </v>

627
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:40.851
<v Speaker 2>they want to live up to those </v>
<v Speaker 2>expectations and they want to keep up </v>

628
00:29:40.851 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 2>with the ratings and make enough money </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the old school</v>

629
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:47.070
<v Speaker 3>tv model is I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much life it has left </v>

630
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.070
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that's where the money is</v>

631
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.370
<v Speaker 3>still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a legacy model.</v>

632
00:29:48.371 --> 00:29:52.090
<v Speaker 3>It's all of the investors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the advertisers.</v>

633
00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:57.120
<v Speaker 3>It's how they know how to do their jobs </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they've been doing it for so </v>

634
00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.770
<v Speaker 3>long that they still pumped so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>money into that machine.</v>

635
00:29:59.771 --> 00:30:04.771
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see it as a freelancer when I get </v>

636
00:30:04.771 --> 00:30:07.291
<v Speaker 3>offered a TV job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It always pays better than a web job </v>

637
00:30:07.291 --> 00:30:09.370
<v Speaker 3>across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where the money is still in,</v>

638
00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:14.390
<v Speaker 3>in and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where my agent is trying to </v>

639
00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:16.471
<v Speaker 3>push me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do a lot of web work because I like </v>

640
00:30:16.471 --> 00:30:16.570
<v Speaker 3>new media and I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can be free on it,</v>

641
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:21.070
<v Speaker 3>but the truth is we're still in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of legacy world with,</v>

642
00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:26.150
<v Speaker 3>with old school media and until those </v>
<v Speaker 3>large corporations start to understand </v>

643
00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:31.890
<v Speaker 3>new media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that you're going to see this </v>

644
00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:31.890
<v Speaker 3>weird inflated bubble where all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>money's still stays there,</v>

645
00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:33.310
<v Speaker 3>but nobody's even fucking watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

646
00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:35.890
<v Speaker 1>It's adjusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's adjusting slowly.</v>

647
00:30:35.891 --> 00:30:36.520
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

648
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.110
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

649
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:41.890
<v Speaker 1>in this transitionary period where more </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are kind of realizing,</v>

650
00:30:41.891 --> 00:30:43.270
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't everybody on line?</v>

651
00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

652
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:49.800
<v Speaker 1>So isn't it aren't the same people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are online also watching television </v>

653
00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.690
<v Speaker 1>shows like we can reach them in both </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways and then it will slowly shift.</v>

654
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:57.750
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to shift to the Internet </v>

655
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.750
<v Speaker 1>almost entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't see.</v>

656
00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:02.940
<v Speaker 1>The only benefit that I could see a </v>
<v Speaker 1>networks is things like game of thrones </v>

657
00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.661
<v Speaker 1>where you need massive budgets to put on</v>
<v Speaker 1>these spectacular special effects and </v>

658
00:31:06.661 --> 00:31:07.000
<v Speaker 1>everything in Ireland.</v>

659
00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:12.640
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think you will be able to see and </v>

660
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.870
<v Speaker 3>what happens when those production </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies or when Hbo Rolls Out and it </v>

661
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.580
<v Speaker 3>becomes a standalone app where you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>need the cable provider anymore,</v>

662
00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:19.350
<v Speaker 3>then fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's online too.</v>

663
00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:24.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only things that I appointment view </v>

664
00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:26.601
<v Speaker 3>anymore at all on television are masters</v>
<v Speaker 3>of sex.</v>

665
00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.090
<v Speaker 3>What does that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

666
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:29.120
<v Speaker 3>it's on showtime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

667
00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:30.760
<v Speaker 3>is that the Kinsey thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

668
00:31:30.761 --> 00:31:33.420
<v Speaker 3>it's masters and Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so different researchers.</v>

669
00:31:33.421 --> 00:31:35.310
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex researchers from the fifties.</v>

670
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:38.560
<v Speaker 1>So this is like that movie was Liam </v>
<v Speaker 1>Neeson.</v>

671
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck</v>

672
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.140
<v Speaker 3>is that the Kinsey movie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

673
00:31:40.141 --> 00:31:43.260
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the Kinsey and then I don't remember,</v>

674
00:31:43.261 --> 00:31:47.130
<v Speaker 3>but Kinsey and masters and Johnson are </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably the most cited sex research,</v>

675
00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:52.160
<v Speaker 3>historical sex researchers in psychology</v>
<v Speaker 3>courses where you learned about sexual </v>

676
00:31:52.171 --> 00:31:57.171
<v Speaker 3>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but masters and Johnson a really </v>

677
00:31:57.171 --> 00:31:57.270
<v Speaker 3>interesting thing because masters was an</v>
<v Speaker 3>ob Gyn.</v>

678
00:31:57.271 --> 00:32:02.271
<v Speaker 3>Johnson was his research assistant and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they fucked a lot and that's show.</v>

679
00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:07.840
<v Speaker 3>And so they got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were the source of a lot of their </v>

680
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:07.840
<v Speaker 3>research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

681
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.050
<v Speaker 3>And it's Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>

682
00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.910
<v Speaker 3>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great show.</v>

683
00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:13.020
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is it,</v>

684
00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.330
<v Speaker 3>is it a pervy show?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it Kinda like a.</v>

685
00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:20.460
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of scientific about their </v>

686
00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:20.460
<v Speaker 3>socks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

687
00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:20.850
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they totally are.</v>

688
00:32:20.851 --> 00:32:25.851
<v Speaker 3>But it's a new field at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody has thought to investigate like </v>

689
00:32:25.851 --> 00:32:29.990
<v Speaker 3>sexual response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they are the first people to detail </v>

690
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.660
<v Speaker 3>what happens when you have an orgasm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the first people to try and take</v>

691
00:32:30.661 --> 00:32:32.820
<v Speaker 3>measurements of female orgasm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all these.</v>

692
00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:36.420
<v Speaker 3>Really nobody thought that that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimate research at the time.</v>

693
00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:39.390
<v Speaker 3>So he gets thrown out of multiple </v>
<v Speaker 3>institutions.</v>

694
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 3>He's always getting</v>

695
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:40.430
<v Speaker 2>in trouble.</v>

696
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.310
<v Speaker 1>It is pretty fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think about it.</v>

697
00:32:42.311 --> 00:32:45.320
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until the 20th century that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people started researching stuff.</v>

698
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:46.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sexuality.</v>

699
00:32:46.971 --> 00:32:51.971
<v Speaker 2>And even then it was all men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nobody gave a shit about a female </v>

700
00:32:51.971 --> 00:32:51.971
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was totally secondary.</v>

701
00:32:51.971 --> 00:32:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Like because this is what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is another little feminist.</v>

702
00:32:56.221 --> 00:32:59.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm a soapbox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that feminist though?</v>

703
00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.910
<v Speaker 2>I have an issue with the term feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's kind of like,</v>

704
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
<v Speaker 2>it's the term feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All it really means is that I support </v>

705
00:33:08.041 --> 00:33:10.200
<v Speaker 2>equal rights for women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

706
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:12.410
<v Speaker 2>So in that sense of the term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

707
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm very much a feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so were you.</v>

708
00:33:14.131 --> 00:33:19.131
<v Speaker 2>So it was probably everybody in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>room and of the people listening for </v>

709
00:33:19.131 --> 00:33:22.551
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is the thing when you don't </v>

710
00:33:22.551 --> 00:33:25.401
<v Speaker 2>have female physicians and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have female researchers because the </v>

711
00:33:25.401 --> 00:33:29.211
<v Speaker 2>institutions don't allow them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you don't have a female research </v>

712
00:33:29.211 --> 00:33:32.781
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all of the sudden all of your </v>

713
00:33:32.781 --> 00:33:34.971
<v Speaker 2>research subjects are men because nobody</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks that it matters to research what </v>

714
00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:35.490
<v Speaker 2>happens to a woman's body.</v>

715
00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:40.940
<v Speaker 2>And it took decades for research on </v>
<v Speaker 2>female sexual response to catch up to </v>

716
00:33:41.281 --> 00:33:46.281
<v Speaker 2>research on male sexual response,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is crazy because females are the </v>

717
00:33:46.281 --> 00:33:46.640
<v Speaker 2>child bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

718
00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:47.790
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

719
00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:51.330
<v Speaker 2>We're pretty bizarre when you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about all the different things that used</v>

720
00:33:51.331 --> 00:33:56.331
<v Speaker 2>to be used on women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the women used to go to a doctor to</v>

721
00:33:56.581 --> 00:34:01.581
<v Speaker 2>get manually manipulated to orgasm </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were like suffering from </v>

722
00:34:01.581 --> 00:34:03.720
<v Speaker 2>hysteria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hysteria,</v>

723
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.660
<v Speaker 2>hysterectomy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hysteria.</v>

724
00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:07.470
<v Speaker 2>They all connected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that was the idea.</v>

725
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:12.500
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in women who would go to hospitals for </v>

726
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:13.350
<v Speaker 2>exhaustion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was like a common thing to Austin.</v>

727
00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:18.750
<v Speaker 2>She's hospitalized for exhaustion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is celebrities still do that.</v>

728
00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:19.630
<v Speaker 2>Precious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

729
00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:20.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say that,</v>

730
00:34:20.491 --> 00:34:23.940
<v Speaker 2>but it's like it's either depression or </v>
<v Speaker 2>substance abuse.</v>

731
00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.730
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they used to call them,</v>

732
00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:30.780
<v Speaker 2>exhaustion and it was only women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't men that were going to do it </v>

733
00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:31.260
<v Speaker 2>sometimes too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was very common for housewives to</v>

734
00:34:31.261 --> 00:34:33.350
<v Speaker 2>go in for exhaustion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

735
00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:35.160
<v Speaker 2>What they do to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just check them off,</v>

736
00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:40.180
<v Speaker 2>just they might've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might have and they probably gave </v>

737
00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:43.361
<v Speaker 2>him like early versions of psychiatric </v>
<v Speaker 2>medications and they basically let them </v>

738
00:34:43.361 --> 00:34:44.650
<v Speaker 2>leave whatever stressful environment </v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't.</v>

739
00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.740
<v Speaker 2>Get away from the babies that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>making you depressed.</v>

740
00:34:46.741 --> 00:34:49.800
<v Speaker 2>Get away from the husband,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go be on your own for a bit.</v>

741
00:34:49.801 --> 00:34:52.380
<v Speaker 2>Read a fucking book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's fair to think that</v>

742
00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:57.440
<v Speaker 1>as life becomes easier and as a society </v>
<v Speaker 1>and civilization is more like goods are </v>

743
00:35:00.301 --> 00:35:02.220
<v Speaker 1>more accessible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to get food.</v>

744
00:35:02.221 --> 00:35:07.221
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to get water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to get services and then </v>

745
00:35:07.221 --> 00:35:11.330
<v Speaker 1>slowly but surely things sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>equalized in terms of the more </v>

746
00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:14.730
<v Speaker 1>aggressive sex males paying more </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to the needs of the female.</v>

747
00:35:14.731 --> 00:35:17.820
<v Speaker 1>But in the old days when things were </v>
<v Speaker 1>much harsher,</v>

748
00:35:17.821 --> 00:35:21.120
<v Speaker 1>people lived less that they have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shorter lifespan.</v>

749
00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:25.230
<v Speaker 1>The world was a darker place than it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>more sexist.</v>

750
00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it was more like men were </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

751
00:35:27.451 --> 00:35:27.830
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

752
00:35:27.831 --> 00:35:29.670
<v Speaker 1>these are tough times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck off bitch,</v>

753
00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get mine.</v>

754
00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.450
<v Speaker 2>I think it's probably both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's definitely,</v>

755
00:35:33.451 --> 00:35:38.130
<v Speaker 2>you look at kind of maslow's hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 2>of needs you've ever studied</v>

756
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:43.700
<v Speaker 3>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hospitalized for exhaustion make you </v>

757
00:35:46.801 --> 00:35:49.290
<v Speaker 3>look at maslow's hierarchy of needs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like this pyramid.</v>

758
00:35:49.291 --> 00:35:54.291
<v Speaker 3>It's like the food pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the needs pyramid and at the </v>

759
00:35:54.291 --> 00:35:54.780
<v Speaker 3>bottom are things like food and water </v>
<v Speaker 3>and shelter.</v>

760
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.000
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're concerned about food </v>
<v Speaker 3>and water and shelter,</v>

761
00:35:57.001 --> 00:36:01.770
<v Speaker 3>you're not concerned about things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>love and um,</v>

762
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.780
<v Speaker 3>friendship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then as you get to the top,</v>

763
00:36:03.781 --> 00:36:06.420
<v Speaker 3>it's things like self actualization and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Blah Blah Blah.</v>

764
00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.810
<v Speaker 3>So I think that there is a component of </v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

765
00:36:09.811 --> 00:36:14.811
<v Speaker 3>if you're just struggling to survive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>contemplating or waxing philosophical </v>

766
00:36:15.481 --> 00:36:17.750
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

767
00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:20.700
<v Speaker 3>civil liberties and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not in your.</v>

768
00:36:20.701 --> 00:36:24.330
<v Speaker 3>So you may be very instinctual and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>may be aggressive because of that or for</v>

769
00:36:24.331 --> 00:36:29.331
<v Speaker 3>whatever reason you may see kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>patriarchal lines that are drawn in the </v>

770
00:36:29.331 --> 00:36:31.380
<v Speaker 3>sand and some sexism and some violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think on top of that,</v>

771
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:33.900
<v Speaker 3>maybe that would always be the case.</v>

772
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.930
<v Speaker 3>So long as women didn't have a voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

773
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure if just moving to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future and I'm not sure if it has a </v>

774
00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.210
<v Speaker 3>function,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's a function of people having more</v>

775
00:36:42.211 --> 00:36:46.560
<v Speaker 3>access to food and goods and services or</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's really a function of women.</v>

776
00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:51.650
<v Speaker 3>Because what happened was women were </v>
<v Speaker 3>mothers and men said,</v>

777
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.630
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mothers bring life.</v>

778
00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.300
<v Speaker 3>This is something that we should respect</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we should honor.</v>

779
00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:01.710
<v Speaker 3>And this was a historical norm for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very long time.</v>

780
00:37:01.711 --> 00:37:06.711
<v Speaker 3>And then as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these kind of hunter gatherer societies </v>

781
00:37:06.711 --> 00:37:09.060
<v Speaker 3>moved into more agrarian societies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>started to form cultural structures.</v>

782
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:14.270
<v Speaker 3>Men realized I can overpower that bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I have physical strength and I can </v>

783
00:37:14.851 --> 00:37:19.851
<v Speaker 3>physically put this woman in her place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as they realized that there was a </v>

784
00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.790
<v Speaker 3>power differential between them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that men were physically stronger.</v>

785
00:37:23.791 --> 00:37:28.791
<v Speaker 3>I think that's where a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>patriarchal wisdom comes from is that </v>

786
00:37:28.791 --> 00:37:29.730
<v Speaker 3>men are physically stronger than women.</v>

787
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:34.790
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that wasn't there was there</v>
<v Speaker 3>was realized not until there was </v>

788
00:37:35.041 --> 00:37:40.041
<v Speaker 3>agriculture and until there was cities </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that that was a big part of </v>

789
00:37:40.041 --> 00:37:42.180
<v Speaker 3>it is when you think that that would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>a big part of it everywhere.</v>

790
00:37:42.181 --> 00:37:47.181
<v Speaker 3>I mean all primitive cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well if you are a hunter gatherer type </v>

791
00:37:47.191 --> 00:37:52.191
<v Speaker 3>and so you're living in a very small </v>
<v Speaker 3>tribe and you're concerned about kinship</v>

792
00:37:52.291 --> 00:37:57.291
<v Speaker 3>or the welfare of your children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I think that there's a certain </v>

793
00:37:57.291 --> 00:37:59.610
<v Speaker 3>amount of respect and honor that you are</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to pay to your wife,</v>

794
00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.590
<v Speaker 3>but why does that go away with </v>
<v Speaker 3>agriculture?</v>

795
00:38:01.591 --> 00:38:04.680
<v Speaker 3>Why does it go away with the city?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not so much agriculture as it is.</v>

796
00:38:04.681 --> 00:38:07.080
<v Speaker 3>All of the things that come along with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that agriculture,</v>

797
00:38:07.081 --> 00:38:12.081
<v Speaker 3>which is maybe political power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is starting to stratify and have </v>

798
00:38:12.081 --> 00:38:14.280
<v Speaker 3>jobs and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it no longer are you making your own</v>

799
00:38:14.281 --> 00:38:16.050
<v Speaker 3>clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making your own shoes,</v>

800
00:38:16.051 --> 00:38:19.200
<v Speaker 3>doing your own hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing your own cooking.</v>

801
00:38:19.201 --> 00:38:23.250
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden now you're a cobbler and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a butcher and you're whatever.</v>

802
00:38:23.251 --> 00:38:28.251
<v Speaker 3>And so people have to depend on one </v>
<v Speaker 3>another for goods and services and they </v>

803
00:38:28.251 --> 00:38:28.740
<v Speaker 3>have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

804
00:38:28.741 --> 00:38:33.741
<v Speaker 3>I'll trade you this for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then money comes into play and </v>

805
00:38:33.741 --> 00:38:36.351
<v Speaker 3>bartering and all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas it was a lot more egalitarian </v>

806
00:38:36.351 --> 00:38:36.351
<v Speaker 3>before where</v>

807
00:38:36.351 --> 00:38:41.100
<v Speaker 2>everybody kind of had a strong role </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were taking care of </v>

808
00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:41.170
<v Speaker 2>themselves or they're very small groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their family groups.</v>

809
00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:43.960
<v Speaker 2>Now all of a sudden they have a place in</v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

810
00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:49.110
<v Speaker 2>And that's I think where you really </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to see a subjection of women is </v>

811
00:38:50.591 --> 00:38:54.400
<v Speaker 2>because men start to develop power </v>
<v Speaker 2>within societies.</v>

812
00:38:54.401 --> 00:38:59.401
<v Speaker 2>And if you look back historically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are no known societies that were </v>

813
00:38:59.401 --> 00:39:03.190
<v Speaker 2>matriarchal societies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you do see in smaller kind of tribal</v>

814
00:39:03.191 --> 00:39:05.950
<v Speaker 2>communities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more matriarchal,</v>

815
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:11.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology more kind of honoring and </v>

816
00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:12.310
<v Speaker 2>worshiping of mother figures and mother </v>
<v Speaker 2>gods.</v>

817
00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:16.120
<v Speaker 2>But every time there's a society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes patriarchal historically,</v>

818
00:39:16.121 --> 00:39:18.580
<v Speaker 2>throughout every time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no such thing as those.</v>

819
00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:19.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of it.</v>

820
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.300
<v Speaker 2>There is no such thing as those </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazonian women tribe that,</v>

821
00:39:22.301 --> 00:39:27.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people talk about like the Amazonian </v>

822
00:39:27.301 --> 00:39:27.301
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your girlfriend.</v>

823
00:39:27.301 --> 00:39:27.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not a real thing,</v>

824
00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:29.350
<v Speaker 2>like women are going to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

825
00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.460
<v Speaker 2>It's a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a myth.</v>

826
00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:32.020
<v Speaker 2>So their vaginas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

827
00:39:32.021 --> 00:39:34.690
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't say that that's a cause of it,</v>

828
00:39:34.691 --> 00:39:39.691
<v Speaker 2>but those things are highly correlated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you think that that evens out </v>

829
00:39:39.691 --> 00:39:42.400
<v Speaker 2>once civilization society becomes more </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex and has.</v>

830
00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:47.570
<v Speaker 2>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my point was that scarcity makes people </v>

831
00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:49.510
<v Speaker 2>desperate and when people get desperate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they victimized not just women,</v>

832
00:39:49.511 --> 00:39:52.560
<v Speaker 2>but they've victimized week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly one week.</v>

833
00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.690
<v Speaker 2>It's like you know who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were the people that we historically</v>

834
00:39:55.691 --> 00:40:00.691
<v Speaker 2>look to for like heroic figures in times</v>
<v Speaker 2>of great stress when people that pulled </v>

835
00:40:01.561 --> 00:40:06.561
<v Speaker 2>themselves up by their bootstraps and go</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there and kick some fucking ass </v>

836
00:40:06.561 --> 00:40:06.561
<v Speaker 2>people with big muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean that's the thing.</v>

837
00:40:06.561 --> 00:40:11.161
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a brutish and such an </v>

838
00:40:11.161 --> 00:40:11.161
<v Speaker 2>underdeveloped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a way to value strength,</v>

839
00:40:11.161 --> 00:40:13.720
<v Speaker 2>to only value strength in like I punch </v>
<v Speaker 2>harder,</v>

840
00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:16.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's other forms of strength,</v>

841
00:40:16.151 --> 00:40:19.360
<v Speaker 2>but you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people are desperate,</v>

842
00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.820
<v Speaker 2>people know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

843
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about if you're having an argument</v>

844
00:40:23.351 --> 00:40:27.190
<v Speaker 2>with another guy or if something comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a head even at work,</v>

845
00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:32.220
<v Speaker 2>wherever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're having an argument and you </v>

846
00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:32.410
<v Speaker 2>can't agree with each other and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to get more and more frustrated.</v>

847
00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:37.300
<v Speaker 2>What's the way in every film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in every I'm a book.</v>

848
00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:39.160
<v Speaker 2>What's the way that it finally get </v>
<v Speaker 2>settled?</v>

849
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
<v Speaker 2>You roll up your sleeves and you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a physical altercation with each </v>

850
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.081
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just not a form of strength or </v>

851
00:40:49.081 --> 00:40:49.081
<v Speaker 2>not a form of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

852
00:40:49.081 --> 00:40:53.170
<v Speaker 2>of settling a score that's common in </v>
<v Speaker 2>like feet.</v>

853
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:56.830
<v Speaker 2>In females it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't ever watch basketball wives.</v>

854
00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:58.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happens.</v>

855
00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:01.250
<v Speaker 2>They throw it out like the worst of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worst to.</v>

856
00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:03.520
<v Speaker 2>Not Normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's counterintuitive,</v>

857
00:41:03.521 --> 00:41:06.310
<v Speaker 2>but the best way to avoid that with men </v>
<v Speaker 2>is martial arts.</v>

858
00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Get men in a situation where they train </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they compete against each other on a</v>

859
00:41:11.261 --> 00:41:16.261
<v Speaker 2>regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have this need to dominate </v>

860
00:41:16.261 --> 00:41:19.381
<v Speaker 2>each other the way it's true because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>do think that it's a bit stupid to to to</v>

861
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:25.230
<v Speaker 2>just completely ignore the role that </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like testosterone play in gender </v>

862
00:41:25.691 --> 00:41:30.691
<v Speaker 2>dimorphism like in female male </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences in humans and and other </v>

863
00:41:30.691 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 2>higher order mammals like testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 2>is</v>

864
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:39.190
<v Speaker 3>a is a chemical that actually is highly </v>
<v Speaker 3>linked to things like aggression and </v>

865
00:41:40.341 --> 00:41:45.341
<v Speaker 3>feeling tension and having this need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>release that in some way and we have </v>

866
00:41:45.621 --> 00:41:50.621
<v Speaker 3>less of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have significantly less of it and </v>

867
00:41:50.621 --> 00:41:53.501
<v Speaker 3>some women are more aggressive in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some women are completely passive and </v>

868
00:41:53.501 --> 00:41:56.411
<v Speaker 3>are never aggressive that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is a significant difference </v>

869
00:41:56.411 --> 00:41:57.950
<v Speaker 3>between males and females and </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone is a big reason for that.</v>

870
00:41:57.951 --> 00:41:59.540
<v Speaker 3>So being able to get that aggression </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

871
00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:04.780
<v Speaker 3>whether it's on a heavy bag or whether </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's through martial arts or whatever </v>

872
00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.790
<v Speaker 3>exercises you use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's irresponsible to think that</v>

873
00:42:07.791 --> 00:42:09.290
<v Speaker 3>that's not part of the equation.</v>

874
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it definitely is for a man coming from a</v>

875
00:42:11.631 --> 00:42:14.390
<v Speaker 1>male point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it makes a significant difference</v>

876
00:42:14.391 --> 00:42:16.070
<v Speaker 1>with me whether or not I can release it </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not,</v>

877
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:21.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the just doing martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts and being involved in something </v>

878
00:42:21.831 --> 00:42:26.831
<v Speaker 1>that gives you an understanding of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical confrontation is really all </v>

879
00:42:26.831 --> 00:42:26.831
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

880
00:42:26.831 --> 00:42:31.630
<v Speaker 1>It's not this scary thing that every man</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to like puff his chest up to avoid </v>

881
00:42:31.701 --> 00:42:36.701
<v Speaker 1>happening or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you go into it completely ignorantly </v>

882
00:42:36.701 --> 00:42:40.840
<v Speaker 1>thinking it's like a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're going to sock some guy and </v>

883
00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:43.511
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be the end of it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>meanwhile you throw a punch at him and </v>

884
00:42:43.511 --> 00:42:43.511
<v Speaker 1>he moves his head and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

885
00:42:43.511 --> 00:42:48.341
<v Speaker 1>This guy actually knows how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm fucked because now I tried to </v>

886
00:42:48.341 --> 00:42:48.341
<v Speaker 1>hit somebody that is not going to let me</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit them.</v>

887
00:42:48.341 --> 00:42:52.860
<v Speaker 1>They're going gonna beat me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that I think comes from fear </v>

888
00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:53.060
<v Speaker 1>and it comes from ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes from other ridiculous,</v>

889
00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.640
<v Speaker 1>these media depictions of what happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>when people hit each other.</v>

890
00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.370
<v Speaker 1>One the things that drives me fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy and I really wanted to talk to you</v>

891
00:42:58.371 --> 00:43:02.450
<v Speaker 1>about this because I wanted to get into </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression is a head trauma.</v>

892
00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Like there's so many God damn movies </v>
<v Speaker 1>where someone hit someone in the head </v>

893
00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:11.741
<v Speaker 1>and they fall down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get up and they rub their head and </v>

894
00:43:11.741 --> 00:43:13.781
<v Speaker 1>they were out cold and then they go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they fucking have a crazy fistfight </v>

895
00:43:13.781 --> 00:43:15.000
<v Speaker 1>with 100 people or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

896
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.940
<v Speaker 1>they make it like they're back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal.</v>

897
00:43:16.941 --> 00:43:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Like they get shut off and they come </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to normal and that's fine.</v>

898
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.640
<v Speaker 3>Guy Is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

899
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:26.230
<v Speaker 3>this great martial artist is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is in a fight with like 10 other dudes.</v>

900
00:43:26.231 --> 00:43:31.231
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he's like punching and kicking </v>

901
00:43:31.231 --> 00:43:33.000
<v Speaker 3>and then he does that thing where he </v>
<v Speaker 3>headbutts like tons of like cracked his </v>

902
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.530
<v Speaker 3>skull against the skull of like multiple</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in a row.</v>

903
00:43:35.531 --> 00:43:37.300
<v Speaker 3>And it's like in no way affected by it.</v>

904
00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>headbutts,</v>

905
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:41.840
<v Speaker 1>it's really weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way to do it correctly,</v>

906
00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:46.730
<v Speaker 1>it actually is effective because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>using this part of your head,</v>

907
00:43:46.731 --> 00:43:51.731
<v Speaker 1>your forehead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a really hard part and you </v>

908
00:43:51.731 --> 00:43:53.820
<v Speaker 1>smash them in the nose and your nose </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of gives in so crazy,</v>

909
00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:56.540
<v Speaker 1>but it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works like crazy.</v>

910
00:43:56.630 --> 00:44:01.630
<v Speaker 1>I wish we had a shot of redband just </v>
<v Speaker 1>then when there's a great video of a </v>

911
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:03.750
<v Speaker 1>woman knocking a guy out in a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

912
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.950
<v Speaker 1>There was some sort of a bar fight in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

913
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:10.990
<v Speaker 1>This guy was involved in a fight with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this woman's boyfriend and the guy grabs</v>

914
00:44:11.631 --> 00:44:16.631
<v Speaker 1>the woman and the woman grabs the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>shirts and slams him in the head right </v>

915
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:19.940
<v Speaker 1>on his nose and the guy goes out cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>and goes limp and it's hilarious because</v>

916
00:44:19.941 --> 00:44:24.941
<v Speaker 1>it's like this little woman and this big</v>
<v Speaker 1>man and she knocks him out with her </v>

917
00:44:24.941 --> 00:44:24.941
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

918
00:44:24.941 --> 00:44:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's that.</v>

919
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:27.560
<v Speaker 1>They never showed that in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never hit him in the nose.</v>

920
00:44:27.561 --> 00:44:29.600
<v Speaker 1>They hit him like in the same part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their head.</v>

921
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

922
00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Well you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to scramble your brain or </v>

923
00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Samoan if you're like one of those dudes</v>
<v Speaker 1>with extra big head,</v>

924
00:44:36.421 --> 00:44:38.790
<v Speaker 1>you can get away with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for most people you smash him in the</v>

925
00:44:38.791 --> 00:44:39.380
<v Speaker 1>nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

926
00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:40.680
<v Speaker 1>you probably don't want to do that too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

927
00:44:40.681 --> 00:44:43.410
<v Speaker 1>We're even seeing that there are just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

928
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.170
<v Speaker 1>This watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This girl had bought this dude.</v>

929
00:44:46.171 --> 00:44:51.171
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking hilarious because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this shit going on and this girl </v>

930
00:44:51.171 --> 00:44:54.951
<v Speaker 1>just grabs this dude and Kaos see if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can cut to it because it's kind of a </v>

931
00:44:55.141 --> 00:44:56.790
<v Speaker 1>long video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I remember correctly.</v>

932
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.720
<v Speaker 1>There's like a lot of shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Bar fight.</v>

933
00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just isolate it because this is.</v>

934
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Is he punching her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

935
00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:05.190
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

936
00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

937
00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:08.450
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

938
00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know when in this video.</v>

939
00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:14.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this is the same video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a different one.</v>

940
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the same video.</v>

941
00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.160
<v Speaker 1>The other video was indoors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one,</v>

942
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:23.450
<v Speaker 1>that one's outdoors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

943
00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

944
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Like even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

945
00:45:24.981 --> 00:45:28.730
<v Speaker 1>they're finding that soccer players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the multiple,</v>

946
00:45:28.731 --> 00:45:33.731
<v Speaker 1>the movement of like hitting a ball with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your head over and over and over and </v>

947
00:45:33.731 --> 00:45:34.880
<v Speaker 1>over and over causes mild concussive </v>
<v Speaker 1>injuries.</v>

948
00:45:34.881 --> 00:45:39.881
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cracking people in the skulls a lot is </v>

949
00:45:39.881 --> 00:45:39.881
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

950
00:45:39.881 --> 00:45:41.330
<v Speaker 1>it's not really avoided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

951
00:45:41.331 --> 00:45:42.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and me,</v>

952
00:45:42.321 --> 00:45:47.321
<v Speaker 1>I've obviously I come from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>background of not just constantly doing </v>

953
00:45:47.321 --> 00:45:51.251
<v Speaker 1>that my whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but being around it my whole life I've </v>

954
00:45:51.251 --> 00:45:54.040
<v Speaker 1>been around so many guys getting hit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the head and I've seen them from the </v>

955
00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:58.720
<v Speaker 1>beginning of their career and then I see</v>
<v Speaker 1>them at the end of the career and I see </v>

956
00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:01.121
<v Speaker 1>a significant decline in how they </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate and how I'm sure how they </v>

957
00:46:01.121 --> 00:46:05.711
<v Speaker 1>feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They seem like old men when they're in </v>

958
00:46:05.711 --> 00:46:07.691
<v Speaker 1>their forties and depression is a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue and it's one of the reasons why I </v>

959
00:46:07.691 --> 00:46:09.650
<v Speaker 1>wanted to bring this up is because my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend Mark Gordon,</v>

960
00:46:09.651 --> 00:46:14.651
<v Speaker 1>Dr Mark Gordon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's an expert in traumatic brain </v>

961
00:46:14.651 --> 00:46:17.531
<v Speaker 1>injury and he works a lot with soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and athletes that have had significant </v>

962
00:46:18.621 --> 00:46:23.621
<v Speaker 1>brain trauma and they have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues with their hormones afterwards.</v>

963
00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:29.920
<v Speaker 1>The pituitary gland is extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive and he wrote a piece </v>

964
00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.090
<v Speaker 1>connecting Robin Williams with </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>

965
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:37.150
<v Speaker 1>not just based on a lot of factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean robin had a lot of things going </v>

966
00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:39.230
<v Speaker 1>on and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he obviously had substance abuse issues.</v>

967
00:46:39.231 --> 00:46:44.231
<v Speaker 1>He obviously he had the Parkinson's </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue which was also taking medication </v>

968
00:46:44.601 --> 00:46:46.520
<v Speaker 1>for Parkinson's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has been connected to depression,</v>

969
00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:51.760
<v Speaker 1>but he also had heart surgery and his Dr</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gordon's connection was that Robin </v>

970
00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Williams having had this major heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>valve replacement,</v>

971
00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:04.360
<v Speaker 1>which entails many hours of anesthesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lowered blood pressure and the </v>

972
00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.990
<v Speaker 1>literature speaks of post cardiac </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery,</v>

973
00:47:05.991 --> 00:47:10.991
<v Speaker 1>depression and over 100 publications and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the prolonged surgery with low </v>

974
00:47:11.091 --> 00:47:16.091
<v Speaker 1>blood pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they believe precipitates a perform a </v>

975
00:47:16.091 --> 00:47:19.361
<v Speaker 1>form of she hands syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the loss of important brain </v>

976
00:47:19.361 --> 00:47:19.361
<v Speaker 1>hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

977
00:47:19.361 --> 00:47:19.760
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Additionally,</v>

978
00:47:19.761 --> 00:47:23.630
<v Speaker 1>there is an increase in reverse t three </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a decrease in t three,</v>

979
00:47:23.631 --> 00:47:28.631
<v Speaker 1>which can cause a relative </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothyroidism that's also associated </v>

980
00:47:28.631 --> 00:47:32.831
<v Speaker 1>with depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Mark Gordon wrote this whole piece </v>

981
00:47:32.831 --> 00:47:35.221
<v Speaker 1>about it and he's saying that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have to consider more is like </v>

982
00:47:35.221 --> 00:47:39.040
<v Speaker 1>when you take someone into a situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're fixing their heart,</v>

983
00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:40.010
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

984
00:47:40.011 --> 00:47:45.011
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also have to realize that there's </v>

985
00:47:45.011 --> 00:47:45.011
<v Speaker 1>gonna be some adverse effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole body's gonna react to this.</v>

986
00:47:45.011 --> 00:47:46.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not just gonna be about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

987
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:47.290
<v Speaker 1>your heart's fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

988
00:47:47.291 --> 00:47:48.650
<v Speaker 1>why are you so sad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

989
00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:51.280
<v Speaker 1>hormones are fucking completely out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>whack now.</v>

990
00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:54.670
<v Speaker 1>And that could have played a factor in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this that was ignored.</v>

991
00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:59.720
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's something that I think that </v>

992
00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:00.630
<v Speaker 3>we've historically had this really weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>approach to medicine,</v>

993
00:48:00.631 --> 00:48:05.631
<v Speaker 3>which I think is kind of a secondary </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect of thinking scientifically.</v>

994
00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:09.990
<v Speaker 3>And obviously I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my background is in neuroscience.</v>

995
00:48:09.991 --> 00:48:14.991
<v Speaker 3>I worked as a scientist for many years </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I am very much a scientific thinker </v>

996
00:48:15.691 --> 00:48:20.691
<v Speaker 3>and I'm all about the scientific method.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think that we sometimes are at </v>

997
00:48:20.701 --> 00:48:23.250
<v Speaker 3>fault when we're a little bit too </v>
<v Speaker 3>reductionistic and our views.</v>

998
00:48:23.251 --> 00:48:25.170
<v Speaker 3>And so if you look at the history of </v>
<v Speaker 3>modern medicine,</v>

999
00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:30.180
<v Speaker 3>of evidence based medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what ends up happening is that we look </v>

1000
00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:33.831
<v Speaker 3>at a problem and we try to fix the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem and we look at it as if you can </v>

1001
00:48:33.831 --> 00:48:38.241
<v Speaker 3>somehow cut that piece of the person's </v>
<v Speaker 3>physiology completely out of them,</v>

1002
00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:41.730
<v Speaker 3>solve it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then put it right back in.</v>

1003
00:48:41.731 --> 00:48:44.520
<v Speaker 3>And it doesn't have any effect on </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything else in their bodies.</v>

1004
00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at medication,</v>

1005
00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:47.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1006
00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:50.190
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any form of pharmaceutical,</v>

1007
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:54.030
<v Speaker 3>they all have side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you think about what a side effect is</v>

1008
00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:56.790
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes down to how medication works of</v>

1009
00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000
<v Speaker 3>medicine is a molecule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's some sort of molecule that fits in </v>

1010
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.620
<v Speaker 3>a receptor somewhere in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea is that you want it to have</v>

1011
00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:09.000
<v Speaker 3>really high efficacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's say that I'm somebody who has a</v>

1012
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:14.030
<v Speaker 3>problem with blood pressure for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or actually let's just jump into </v>

1013
00:49:15.121 --> 00:49:20.121
<v Speaker 3>depression because I've been talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this a lot lately around Robin </v>

1014
00:49:20.121 --> 00:49:21.030
<v Speaker 3>Williams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had Paul Gil Martin on my podcast just</v>

1015
00:49:21.031 --> 00:49:22.470
<v Speaker 3>last week to talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1016
00:49:22.471 --> 00:49:27.471
<v Speaker 3>he hosts the mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Happy hour podcast and has really great </v>

1017
00:49:27.471 --> 00:49:31.251
<v Speaker 3>insights into mental illness and I of </v>
<v Speaker 3>course publicly have dealt with </v>

1018
00:49:31.321 --> 00:49:34.080
<v Speaker 3>depression most of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take medication every day.</v>

1019
00:49:34.081 --> 00:49:36.270
<v Speaker 3>I go to therapy every week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very open about it.</v>

1020
00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that for a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would look at you,</v>

1021
00:49:39.121 --> 00:49:40.950
<v Speaker 1>especially people that don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues with depression.</v>

1022
00:49:40.951 --> 00:49:42.780
<v Speaker 1>They look at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously very intelligent,</v>

1023
00:49:42.781 --> 00:49:44.970
<v Speaker 1>beautiful young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you be depressed?</v>

1024
00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Guys probably tripping over themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to date you.</v>

1025
00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:49.020
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1026
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:53.520
<v Speaker 1>You're obviously very successful in </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing intellectual pursuits.</v>

1027
00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Why would you be depressed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a lot of people are like,</v>

1028
00:49:56.041 --> 00:50:01.041
<v Speaker 1>why would a lot of people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the difference between </v>

1029
00:50:01.041 --> 00:50:03.321
<v Speaker 1>depression and sadness and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that depression is a </v>

1030
00:50:03.321 --> 00:50:06.740
<v Speaker 1>biological illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know they don't think of it and they </v>

1031
00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:08.480
<v Speaker 1>also don't think of it in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>people look at it in terms of like,</v>

1032
00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:09.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got all these sums.</v>

1033
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Looks like you've got all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these numbers.</v>

1034
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all</v>

1035
00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:15.450
<v Speaker 3>that almost can can make it worse for </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain people.</v>

1036
00:50:15.451 --> 00:50:20.451
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at somebody like Robin </v>

1037
00:50:20.451 --> 00:50:20.451
<v Speaker 3>Williams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had so much going for him right?</v>

1038
00:50:20.451 --> 00:50:20.451
<v Speaker 3>He was famous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was loved,</v>

1039
00:50:20.451 --> 00:50:21.540
<v Speaker 3>he had all this money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could he be depressed?</v>

1040
00:50:21.541 --> 00:50:24.840
<v Speaker 3>He didn't have the problems that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were I have and you know what?</v>

1041
00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:29.930
<v Speaker 3>Then you have this extra layer of guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have this extra layer of shame,</v>

1042
00:50:30.291 --> 00:50:33.530
<v Speaker 3>this extra layer of why the fuck am I </v>
<v Speaker 3>still depressed?</v>

1043
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:36.560
<v Speaker 3>No matter how much success I get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter how much money I make,</v>

1044
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:41.830
<v Speaker 3>no matter how much people write me </v>
<v Speaker 3>letters and say that they love me and </v>

1045
00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:44.840
<v Speaker 3>and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't seem to beat this feeling inside</v>

1046
00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:49.841
<v Speaker 3>of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This constellation of symptoms because </v>

1047
00:50:49.841 --> 00:50:51.770
<v Speaker 3>it's not coming from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's coming from your brain,</v>

1048
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:52.360
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

1049
00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:58.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't suffer from depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have had many friends who do and I</v>

1050
00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:03.200
<v Speaker 1>have always wondered what it's because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be that when you go to a </v>

1051
00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:06.921
<v Speaker 1>doctor and they start treating it with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>treat it with medication or they try to </v>

1052
00:51:06.921 --> 00:51:08.460
<v Speaker 1>adjust your diet and prescribe exercise </v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

1053
00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:13.760
<v Speaker 1>that there's no like one simple fix and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's completely different.</v>

1054
00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:17.890
<v Speaker 3>We'll get people get upset about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think it goes back to,</v>

1055
00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:20.390
<v Speaker 3>to kind of what I was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

1056
00:51:20.391 --> 00:51:22.440
<v Speaker 3>which is a meandering way to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

1057
00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:24.710
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so again,</v>

1058
00:51:24.711 --> 00:51:27.290
<v Speaker 3>to go back to this idea of a drug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take a drug,</v>

1059
00:51:27.291 --> 00:51:32.291
<v Speaker 3>let's say I take an antidepressant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My antidepressants specifically is a </v>

1060
00:51:32.291 --> 00:51:34.910
<v Speaker 3>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an Ssri that's called citalopram.</v>

1061
00:51:34.911 --> 00:51:37.070
<v Speaker 3>That's the off brand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's Selectsa,</v>

1062
00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:42.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the brand name I take that it binds </v>

1063
00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:46.031
<v Speaker 3>to my serotonin receptors in my brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it allows me to dump more Serotonin </v>

1064
00:51:47.481 --> 00:51:52.481
<v Speaker 3>into the synopsis that the gap between </v>
<v Speaker 3>two brain cells so that I always have </v>

1065
00:51:52.481 --> 00:51:56.651
<v Speaker 3>more available.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It basically tells my brain that I need </v>

1066
00:51:56.651 --> 00:51:57.710
<v Speaker 3>more serotonin so I make more serotonin </v>
<v Speaker 3>available to myself.</v>

1067
00:51:57.711 --> 00:51:59.180
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a real uptake inhibitor.</v>

1068
00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:02.890
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it keeps more serotonin in,</v>

1069
00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:04.090
<v Speaker 3>in the gap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1070
00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.910
<v Speaker 3>instead of sucking it back into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cell.</v>

1071
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:08.420
<v Speaker 3>So I always have more available to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1072
00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:14.260
<v Speaker 3>It's a molecule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got a shape just like anything out </v>

1073
00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:14.260
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has geometry,</v>

1074
00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:18.640
<v Speaker 3>so it binds to this specific receptor in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain because it had got a similar </v>

1075
00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:19.880
<v Speaker 3>shape to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are other things in your body that</v>

1076
00:52:19.881 --> 00:52:24.620
<v Speaker 3>are similarly shaped and so what ends up</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening is when you take a drug,</v>

1077
00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:30.100
<v Speaker 3>the specificity of the drug is only </v>
<v Speaker 3>based on whether or not the key fits in </v>

1078
00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:34.631
<v Speaker 3>a locked somewhere in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's say that you had hundreds of </v>

1079
00:52:34.631 --> 00:52:38.650
<v Speaker 3>thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of locks available to you and </v>

1080
00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:40.661
<v Speaker 3>one key and you started going through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be able to stick that in a bunch </v>

1081
00:52:40.661 --> 00:52:41.030
<v Speaker 3>of locks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them it might even turn,</v>

1082
00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:46.130
<v Speaker 3>but it would fit in the lock of multiple</v>
<v Speaker 3>locks hanging on that wall.</v>

1083
00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:48.530
<v Speaker 3>So what ends up happening is I take this</v>
<v Speaker 3>drug,</v>

1084
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:53.770
<v Speaker 3>it binds in my brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does what it's supposed to do in my </v>

1085
00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:56.591
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it also may be does other shit like </v>

1086
00:52:56.591 --> 00:52:59.321
<v Speaker 3>makes me really fucking tired or it </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes it so I don't want to have sex as </v>

1087
00:52:59.321 --> 00:52:59.321
<v Speaker 3>often.</v>

1088
00:52:59.321 --> 00:53:03.880
<v Speaker 3>It's a side effect and the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a side effect is because </v>

1089
00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.960
<v Speaker 3>there's other parts of your body that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the drug binds to.</v>

1090
00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:09.050
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing with medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you were saying,</v>

1091
00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:14.300
<v Speaker 3>you operate on somebody heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The heart is connected to other things.</v>

1092
00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:17.420
<v Speaker 3>It's it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the source of blood flow throughout</v>

1093
00:53:17.421 --> 00:53:20.570
<v Speaker 3>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is connected to hormone levels.</v>

1094
00:53:20.571 --> 00:53:24.050
<v Speaker 3>There's all sorts of things that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen when you put somebody under under</v>

1095
00:53:24.051 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 3>anesthesia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you them open,</v>

1096
00:53:26.221 --> 00:53:27.560
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1097
00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:28.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1098
00:53:28.291 --> 00:53:32.820
<v Speaker 3>you cause an immune response and </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory response there your body is</v>

1099
00:53:32.821 --> 00:53:37.821
<v Speaker 3>a holistic thing and so when you start </v>
<v Speaker 3>jacking with certain things,</v>

1100
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:43.010
<v Speaker 3>other things are going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean you should throw the </v>

1101
00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:46.401
<v Speaker 3>baby out with the bathwater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but medicine is a risk benefit analysis </v>

1102
00:53:46.401 --> 00:53:47.640
<v Speaker 3>always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how do they find the.</v>

1103
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:53.150
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me that they find the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>medication by experimentation that they </v>

1104
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.150
<v Speaker 3>try it.</v>

1105
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:55.440
<v Speaker 3>And is that just the only way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because we don't have any test.</v>

1106
00:53:55.441 --> 00:53:58.770
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't go up as a doctor.</v>

1107
00:53:58.771 --> 00:54:01.350
<v Speaker 3>You can't come to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stick a needle in my spinal cord,</v>

1108
00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:05.640
<v Speaker 3>take out my cerebral spinal fluid and </v>
<v Speaker 3>measure how much serotonin I have in it.</v>

1109
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.670
<v Speaker 3>I wish you could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could take some sort of a blood</v>

1110
00:54:08.671 --> 00:54:10.340
<v Speaker 3>test or I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1111
00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:15.120
<v Speaker 3>pee in a cup and then you could analyze </v>
<v Speaker 3>that p and say you're low on Serotonin.</v>

1112
00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:17.910
<v Speaker 3>You need an Ssri.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be what works for you because</v>

1113
00:54:17.911 --> 00:54:21.200
<v Speaker 3>other people's depression comes from </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems with dopamine,</v>

1114
00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:25.020
<v Speaker 3>comes from problems with norepinephrine </v>
<v Speaker 3>or some combination thereof.</v>

1115
00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:27.060
<v Speaker 3>But there's no test for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It fucking sucks.</v>

1116
00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:32.090
<v Speaker 3>There's no test for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what ends up happening is you </v>

1117
00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:32.730
<v Speaker 3>have to play a musical chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You try a drug.</v>

1118
00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.480
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was the first drug I tried for </v>
<v Speaker 3>aunt,</v>

1119
00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:39.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I decided to finally go on </v>

1120
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.510
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked me up so bad.</v>

1121
00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:40.830
<v Speaker 3>I took an n,</v>
<v Speaker 3>d,</v>

1122
00:54:40.831 --> 00:54:45.030
<v Speaker 3>R I a selective serotonin norepinephrine</v>
<v Speaker 3>and dopamine reuptake inhibitor.</v>

1123
00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:47.220
<v Speaker 3>I was so fucking depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't function.</v>

1124
00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:49.260
<v Speaker 3>And we decided,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's throw the book at it.</v>

1125
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:53.550
<v Speaker 3>Let's take the drug of all drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the monster drug that does everything.</v>

1126
00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:57.480
<v Speaker 3>And I couldn't sleep for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I was on straight up crank.</v>

1127
00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:00.690
<v Speaker 3>Like on crystal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I quit smoking,</v>

1128
00:55:02.110 --> 00:55:03.510
<v Speaker 3>I quit smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was awesome.</v>

1129
00:55:03.511 --> 00:55:05.420
<v Speaker 3>That's when I quit smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an important point.</v>

1130
00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.280
<v Speaker 3>Terrible for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Horrible.</v>

1131
00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:13.340
<v Speaker 3>Did you do anything to try to naturally </v>
<v Speaker 3>stimulate your body to produce more </v>

1132
00:55:15.451 --> 00:55:17.790
<v Speaker 3>serotonin?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you try a lot of exercise?</v>

1133
00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.880
<v Speaker 3>Did you adjust your diet but you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>quit smoking?</v>

1134
00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:27.050
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean ultimately you've got on the </v>

1135
00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:28.971
<v Speaker 3>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't trust only on the drug for a </v>

1136
00:55:28.971 --> 00:55:28.980
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as soon as I got off the drug again,</v>

1137
00:55:28.981 --> 00:55:30.780
<v Speaker 3>I immediately wanted to smoke again.</v>

1138
00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:32.790
<v Speaker 3>But at that point I'd push through it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>

1139
00:55:32.791 --> 00:55:33.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1140
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:38.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm at my lowest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at my lowest point I've ever been </v>

1141
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:38.990
<v Speaker 3>at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

1142
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:38.990
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can't get any worse.</v>

1143
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.710
<v Speaker 3>And I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I quit smoking and it's been a couple of</v>

1144
00:55:39.711 --> 00:55:40.470
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I did,</v>

1145
00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:42.120
<v Speaker 3>I tried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the truth is,</v>

1146
00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:44.790
<v Speaker 3>this is why addiction research is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

1147
00:55:44.791 --> 00:55:49.791
<v Speaker 3>This is why researchers go into the lab </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a bunch of mice or whatever and </v>

1148
00:55:49.791 --> 00:55:50.520
<v Speaker 3>they feed them a bunch of cocaine and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1149
00:55:50.521 --> 00:55:55.521
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do these different kinds of experiments </v>

1150
00:55:55.521 --> 00:55:58.161
<v Speaker 3>where you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've heard of the famous experiment </v>

1151
00:55:58.161 --> 00:55:59.961
<v Speaker 3>where you have the mouse in the cage and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got a bar pressing paradigms that </v>

1152
00:55:59.961 --> 00:56:03.951
<v Speaker 3>can push the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets coke and then like it just </v>

1153
00:56:03.951 --> 00:56:03.951
<v Speaker 3>fucking does that until it dies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it.</v>

1154
00:56:03.951 --> 00:56:04.710
<v Speaker 3>Like there's food right next to it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1155
00:56:04.711 --> 00:56:05.640
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want more coke,</v>

1156
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:09.180
<v Speaker 3>and then it just dies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the.</v>

1157
00:56:09.181 --> 00:56:14.181
<v Speaker 3>Obviously there's something happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a natural phenomenon because </v>

1158
00:56:14.181 --> 00:56:16.941
<v Speaker 3>mice don't have value judgments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not thinking about this from a </v>

1159
00:56:16.941 --> 00:56:16.941
<v Speaker 3>religious perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not saying,</v>

1160
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:22.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I should stop doing this coke and </v>

1161
00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:22.400
<v Speaker 3>maybe exercise a little more and that'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me the same kind of high.</v>

1162
00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 3>It overwhelms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

1163
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.550
<v Speaker 2>such a strong addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nicotine have the same sort of addictive</v>

1164
00:56:27.551 --> 00:56:31.180
<v Speaker 2>properties are more addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nicotine is nicotine.</v>

1165
00:56:31.181 --> 00:56:35.200
<v Speaker 2>Natural in the natural form is not like </v>
<v Speaker 2>nicotine as far as like pipe smoke,</v>

1166
00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:38.350
<v Speaker 2>nicotine is still addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're talking about like vaping</v>

1167
00:56:38.351 --> 00:56:40.810
<v Speaker 2>it or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm talking about like the,</v>

1168
00:56:40.890 --> 00:56:44.320
<v Speaker 2>like traditional methods of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the way they would smoke tobacco in</v>

1169
00:56:44.321 --> 00:56:47.170
<v Speaker 2>a pipe or a cigar or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not as addictive.</v>

1170
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:49.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's as addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still addictive.</v>

1171
00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:54.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the nicotine is the molecule that </v>

1172
00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:54.490
<v Speaker 2>studied in laboratories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the tar,</v>

1173
00:56:54.491 --> 00:56:56.350
<v Speaker 2>it's not the shit that comes in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>papers now.</v>

1174
00:56:56.351 --> 00:57:00.430
<v Speaker 2>That's what has much more carcinogenic </v>
<v Speaker 2>properties,</v>

1175
00:57:00.431 --> 00:57:05.431
<v Speaker 2>but nicotine itself is highly addictive </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the molecule that studied in </v>

1176
00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:07.360
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pure nicotine.</v>

1177
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:12.750
<v Speaker 2>Nicotine itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't actually have some medicinal </v>

1178
00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:12.750
<v Speaker 2>benefits.</v>

1179
00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:15.620
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually neuroprotective so it can </v>

1180
00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:15.620
<v Speaker 2>protect against Parkinson's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1181
00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:17.130
<v Speaker 2>So if you smoke you won't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>Parkinson's.</v>

1182
00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that,</v>

1183
00:57:18.101 --> 00:57:23.101
<v Speaker 2>but there is some evidence in the lab </v>
<v Speaker 2>that animals that were given nicotine,</v>

1184
00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:28.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a lower incidence rate of </v>

1185
00:57:28.650 --> 00:57:28.650
<v Speaker 2>Parkinson's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>

1186
00:57:28.650 --> 00:57:32.310
<v Speaker 2>is it dangerous in the form that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>take it as far as like gum or things </v>

1187
00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:34.450
<v Speaker 2>along those lines as much less </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous,</v>

1188
00:57:34.451 --> 00:57:39.451
<v Speaker 2>but the goal still would be to get off </v>
<v Speaker 2>of nicotine because the reason they're </v>

1189
00:57:39.451 --> 00:57:39.910
<v Speaker 2>chewing the gum is because they're still</v>
<v Speaker 2>addicted to it,</v>

1190
00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:44.970
<v Speaker 2>but is there a way to take a small </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of it that gives you those </v>

1191
00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:44.970
<v Speaker 2>neuroprotective properties but it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous?</v>

1192
00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on,</v>

1193
00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:49.900
<v Speaker 2>but I think it would be important for us</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see more research to see how.</v>

1194
00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:52.630
<v Speaker 2>How you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1195
00:57:52.631 --> 00:57:56.140
<v Speaker 2>it's a risk benefit analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like is it really that beneficial?</v>

1196
00:57:56.200 --> 00:58:01.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to say what's the dose </v>

1197
00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.091
<v Speaker 2>response curve?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much would you have to take for it </v>

1198
00:58:03.091 --> 00:58:05.221
<v Speaker 2>to be beneficial?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing about depression that is </v>

1199
00:58:05.221 --> 00:58:08.310
<v Speaker 2>fascinating to me is that there are some</v>
<v Speaker 2>correlations between how well your life </v>

1200
00:58:08.310 --> 00:58:10.450
<v Speaker 2>is going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have relationships?</v>

1201
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:12.820
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you happy with what you choose to do</v>

1202
00:58:12.821 --> 00:58:16.150
<v Speaker 2>with your day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend who was a.</v>

1203
00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:20.800
<v Speaker 2>He was on like some serious a SSRI and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they changed his life.</v>

1204
00:58:20.801 --> 00:58:21.590
<v Speaker 2>They got him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1205
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:23.680
<v Speaker 2>he quit his business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He quit his job,</v>

1206
00:58:23.681 --> 00:58:26.050
<v Speaker 2>brother started his own business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got involved in relationship,</v>

1207
00:58:26.051 --> 00:58:28.210
<v Speaker 2>and then once he got to a really good </v>
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>

1208
00:58:28.211 --> 00:58:31.300
<v Speaker 2>he slowly weaned himself off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants and now he's great.</v>

1209
00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:36.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that happens to a lot of people and </v>

1210
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:37.981
<v Speaker 2>so I think that there's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we have to understand too is of </v>

1211
00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:39.520
<v Speaker 2>course all psychiatric disorders or </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum disorders,</v>

1212
00:58:39.521 --> 00:58:39.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1213
00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:44.760
<v Speaker 2>There's really extreme examples and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's barely any examples and if </v>

1214
00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:45.730
<v Speaker 2>anybody who's ever taken a psych course </v>
<v Speaker 2>or who studied,</v>

1215
00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:47.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were a psych major in college,</v>

1216
00:58:47.861 --> 00:58:49.690
<v Speaker 2>you know that as you've studied the dsm </v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

1217
00:58:49.691 --> 00:58:54.691
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called the diagnostic and </v>

1218
00:58:54.691 --> 00:58:54.820
<v Speaker 2>statistical manual that they use in </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychiatry and psychology.</v>

1219
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.820
<v Speaker 2>It's basically the big Bible of all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things you can be diagnosed with.</v>

1220
00:58:58.060 --> 00:58:59.290
<v Speaker 2>The more you study it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you're like,</v>

1221
00:58:59.291 --> 00:59:00.070
<v Speaker 2>I have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1222
00:59:00.071 --> 00:59:00.610
<v Speaker 2>I have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1223
00:59:00.611 --> 00:59:04.480
<v Speaker 2>it totally fucking have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you realize everybody has.</v>

1224
00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:07.240
<v Speaker 2>Everybody can convince themselves that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have these.</v>

1225
00:59:07.241 --> 00:59:09.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like web md.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1226
00:59:09.461 --> 00:59:13.210
<v Speaker 2>So it's only once it is sufficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lee,</v>

1227
00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:16.540
<v Speaker 2>detrimental to your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it affects your relationships.</v>

1228
00:59:16.541 --> 00:59:18.700
<v Speaker 2>It affects Your ability to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it affects your health,</v>

1229
00:59:18.701 --> 00:59:23.701
<v Speaker 2>whatever the case may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and usually within the dsm there maybe </v>

1230
00:59:23.701 --> 00:59:23.701
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

1231
00:59:23.701 --> 00:59:27.130
<v Speaker 3>eight things and it's like you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have five out of these eight things and </v>

1232
00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:27.130
<v Speaker 3>so anybody can read it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1233
00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:32.080
<v Speaker 3>I've felt depression before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what they don't realize is there is </v>

1234
00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:33.830
<v Speaker 3>a difference between depression and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sadness.</v>

1235
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:36.710
<v Speaker 3>There's also a difference between parody</v>
<v Speaker 3>depressIon,</v>

1236
00:59:36.711 --> 00:59:41.000
<v Speaker 3>so depression that lasts years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decades,</v>

1237
00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:46.120
<v Speaker 3>and the type of depression that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>get that's directly linked to life </v>

1238
00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:49.130
<v Speaker 3>events and that's your dog dies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will a big one.</v>

1239
00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:54.160
<v Speaker 3>You lose your freaking job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we've seen so many documentaries </v>

1240
00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:54.160
<v Speaker 3>lately about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As the economy took a downturn,</v>

1241
00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:56.870
<v Speaker 3>people lose their job and then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>ended up committing suicide because they</v>

1242
00:59:56.871 --> 00:59:59.750
<v Speaker 3>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this cascade of awfulness.</v>

1243
00:59:59.751 --> 01:00:01.680
<v Speaker 3>That's a really common one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1244
01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:03.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>family member dies,</v>

1245
01:00:03.411 --> 01:00:07.670
<v Speaker 3>you have a stillborn or you have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>abortion or you how you have a baby,</v>

1246
01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:12.671
<v Speaker 3>a healthy baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Postpartum depression is incredibly </v>

1247
01:00:12.671 --> 01:00:12.671
<v Speaker 3>common.</v>

1248
01:00:12.671 --> 01:00:16.300
<v Speaker 3>And in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's much more common that people can </v>

1249
01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:16.300
<v Speaker 3>take meds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can do all these things,</v>

1250
01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.130
<v Speaker 3>and once they get back to where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were before that horrible life event,</v>

1251
01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:24.610
<v Speaker 3>they're okay to get off off the meds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people are able to get their </v>

1252
01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:29.570
<v Speaker 3>depression managed without medication </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly well,</v>

1253
01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:35.210
<v Speaker 3>but some people aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the different reactions that </v>

1254
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:36.230
<v Speaker 3>different people have two different </v>
<v Speaker 3>medication?</v>

1255
01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:41.290
<v Speaker 3>IS it because their depression has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different source or is it just a </v>

1256
01:00:41.290 --> 01:00:45.950
<v Speaker 3>biodiversity?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more of a biodiversity </v>

1257
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:46.100
<v Speaker 3>thing than a source thing as sources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hard to say.</v>

1258
01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:49.010
<v Speaker 3>So depression is both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you think about it.</v>

1259
01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:54.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain and mind are the same thing in </v>

1260
01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:54.050
<v Speaker 3>most modern neuroscientists say that </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain and mind are two sides of the same</v>

1261
01:00:54.051 --> 01:00:59.051
<v Speaker 3>coin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That mind is just an emergent property </v>

1262
01:00:59.051 --> 01:00:59.051
<v Speaker 3>of brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's a dualist anymore.</v>

1263
01:00:59.051 --> 01:01:03.730
<v Speaker 3>They don't think that you can like heal </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mind and it has no effect on the </v>

1264
01:01:03.730 --> 01:01:04.160
<v Speaker 3>brain because it's the same fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1265
01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:09.160
<v Speaker 3>So there are some people's depression </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes from the fact that their dopamine </v>

1266
01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:13.511
<v Speaker 3>levels are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are not healthy or their norepinephrine </v>

1267
01:01:13.511 --> 01:01:14.000
<v Speaker 3>levels are not healthy or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

1268
01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:19.330
<v Speaker 3>But I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the common view of depression now is </v>

1269
01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:22.931
<v Speaker 3>that there's some sort of biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference in your brain and oftentimes </v>

1270
01:01:22.931 --> 01:01:27.611
<v Speaker 3>that's either caused or it develops out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of childhood or early life experiences </v>

1271
01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:36.070
<v Speaker 3>where you know you have some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>trauma or you have some sort of </v>

1272
01:01:36.070 --> 01:01:37.460
<v Speaker 3>development.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have some sort of,</v>

1273
01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interaction with famiLy,</v>

1274
01:01:38.991 --> 01:01:40.880
<v Speaker 3>whatever the case may be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it doesn't have to be,</v>

1275
01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:42.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were molested as a child.</v>

1276
01:01:42.590 --> 01:01:47.590
<v Speaker 3>It can literally just be like you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel loved or whatever the case may be.</v>

1277
01:01:48.801 --> 01:01:53.801
<v Speaker 3>And you've got this brain difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>combined with this emotional experience </v>

1278
01:01:56.961 --> 01:01:58.790
<v Speaker 3>and what ends up happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when you're very young,</v>

1279
01:01:58.791 --> 01:02:00.140
<v Speaker 3>you're brain is very plastic.</v>

1280
01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:05.170
<v Speaker 3>So when you're very young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're learning skills that are gonna </v>

1281
01:02:05.170 --> 01:02:07.870
<v Speaker 3>last you the rest of your life and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're actually building your brain </v>

1282
01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:10.391
<v Speaker 3>architecture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certain neurons are connecting and </v>

1283
01:02:10.391 --> 01:02:10.820
<v Speaker 3>disconnecting and reconnecting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pruning out the tree.</v>

1284
01:02:10.821 --> 01:02:15.821
<v Speaker 3>The beautiful tree that is all of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cells in your brain is getting pruned </v>

1285
01:02:15.821 --> 01:02:19.300
<v Speaker 3>when you're young and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>depressed when you're young and you're </v>

1286
01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:19.300
<v Speaker 3>experiencing those kinds of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're,</v>

1287
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:24.500
<v Speaker 3>you're going to prune a tree that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>prone to depression as you age because </v>

1288
01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.820
<v Speaker 3>you're going to keep reinforcing those </v>
<v Speaker 3>neuronal connections.</v>

1289
01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:32.180
<v Speaker 3>That's why therapy is so important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meds in and of themselves are never </v>

1290
01:02:32.761 --> 01:02:35.700
<v Speaker 3>going to get you in a place where your </v>
<v Speaker 3>depression is really well managed.</v>

1291
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:40.910
<v Speaker 3>It's going to get you in a place where </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy is going to be working better </v>

1292
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:44.901
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meds are going to be an immediate and </v>

1293
01:02:44.901 --> 01:02:47.900
<v Speaker 3>necessary interventional strategy so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're not crying or you're not </v>

1294
01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:49.260
<v Speaker 3>trying to kill yourself or you're not.</v>

1295
01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:54.260
<v Speaker 3>Whatever your symptoms so you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually fucking get out of bed to work </v>

1296
01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:56.220
<v Speaker 3>on yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what meds are there for me.</v>

1297
01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:58.770
<v Speaker 3>Meds keep me from staying in bed all </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

1298
01:02:58.970 --> 01:03:03.970
<v Speaker 3>That's not variable though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finding the right counselor has got to </v>

1299
01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:03.970
<v Speaker 3>be incredibly difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tough.</v>

1300
01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:06.540
<v Speaker 3>It's like I always liken it to the women</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are listening to the podcast.</v>

1301
01:03:06.541 --> 01:03:09.840
<v Speaker 3>I liken it unto you when you were first </v>
<v Speaker 3>deciding to go on birth control.</v>

1302
01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:15.380
<v Speaker 3>a lot of women will go to their </v>
<v Speaker 3>gynecologist when they're 15,</v>

1303
01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:16.590
<v Speaker 3>16,</v>
<v Speaker 3>17 and say,</v>

1304
01:03:16.591 --> 01:03:21.591
<v Speaker 3>I want to go on birth control and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll give them ortho try cycling or </v>

1305
01:03:21.591 --> 01:03:21.591
<v Speaker 3>whatever the pill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the regular old pill,</v>

1306
01:03:21.591 --> 01:03:25.911
<v Speaker 3>and they'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of women will take the pill the </v>

1307
01:03:25.911 --> 01:03:25.911
<v Speaker 3>first time and it will make them really </v>
<v Speaker 3>sick.</v>

1308
01:03:25.911 --> 01:03:30.530
<v Speaker 3>Like every time they take the pill it </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes them want to throw up or it gives </v>

1309
01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:30.700
<v Speaker 3>them cramps or something's weird about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1310
01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:32.010
<v Speaker 3>It affects others and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1311
01:03:32.011 --> 01:03:33.570
<v Speaker 3>this drug doesn't work for me and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck,</v>

1312
01:03:33.571 --> 01:03:38.571
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's try one with lower levels of </v>

1313
01:03:38.571 --> 01:03:40.191
<v Speaker 3>estrogen or progesterone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or let's try the ring or the depo </v>

1314
01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:40.230
<v Speaker 3>provera shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe you need an iud.</v>

1315
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:46.190
<v Speaker 3>I was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took me multiple times to find the </v>

1316
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:46.190
<v Speaker 3>right drug and I think it's the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing with therapy.</v>

1317
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:47.190
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the same thing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychiatric medicines.</v>

1318
01:03:47.191 --> 01:03:49.200
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not monolithic,</v>

1319
01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:54.201
<v Speaker 3>so the same combination isn't going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>work for everybody and the truth is if </v>

1320
01:03:54.201 --> 01:03:56.730
<v Speaker 3>that makes you afraid of modern medicine</v>
<v Speaker 3>or if it makes you think that psychiatry</v>

1321
01:03:56.731 --> 01:04:01.731
<v Speaker 3>is woo or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the same thing as cancer in many </v>

1322
01:04:03.061 --> 01:04:04.680
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many parallels.</v>

1323
01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:07.830
<v Speaker 3>Cancer is not one disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a spectrum of diseases.</v>

1324
01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:12.300
<v Speaker 3>If I got diagnosed with breast cancer </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you got diagnosed with breast cancer</v>

1325
01:04:12.301 --> 01:04:15.270
<v Speaker 3>and we both went in with our diagnosis </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same day,</v>

1326
01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:20.300
<v Speaker 3>our oncologists would give us different </v>
<v Speaker 3>treatments because we would have </v>

1327
01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:20.300
<v Speaker 3>different genetic markers.</v>

1328
01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:22.380
<v Speaker 3>We would respond differently to </v>
<v Speaker 3>different types of chemotherapy.</v>

1329
01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:27.590
<v Speaker 3>Chemotherapy means chemical therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really big umbrella term for all </v>

1330
01:04:27.751 --> 01:04:30.000
<v Speaker 3>the different kinds of cancer treatments</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are available.</v>

1331
01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:33.930
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you would get more radiation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I would need surgery,</v>

1332
01:04:33.931 --> 01:04:37.680
<v Speaker 3>but your metastasis would make it so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that surgery wasn't a viable option.</v>

1333
01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:42.710
<v Speaker 3>It's it's a spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Disease and psychiatric illness or the </v>

1334
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:43.150
<v Speaker 3>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The variable though,</v>

1335
01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.870
<v Speaker 3>the counselor has to be kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is weird.</v>

1336
01:04:45.871 --> 01:04:50.871
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find someone that you can confide in </v>

1337
01:04:50.871 --> 01:04:53.570
<v Speaker 3>wholeheartedly and it takes time a </v>
<v Speaker 3>really long time finding the correct </v>

1338
01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:53.570
<v Speaker 3>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1339
01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:56.280
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not some men will do better </v>
<v Speaker 3>with women counselors.</v>

1340
01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:59.670
<v Speaker 3>I have a male counselor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1341
01:04:59.671 --> 01:05:00.660
<v Speaker 3>I would never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>

1342
01:05:00.661 --> 01:05:04.230
<v Speaker 3>I have a male therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have a female gynecologists like I</v>

1343
01:05:04.231 --> 01:05:08.030
<v Speaker 3>would never in a million years let a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dude like put speculums and may and like</v>

1344
01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:13.040
<v Speaker 3>dig around in my cervix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm totally comfortable with a male </v>

1345
01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:17.510
<v Speaker 3>therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who went through a male </v>

1346
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.510
<v Speaker 3>gynecologist and the gynecologist texted</v>
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

1347
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:18.380
<v Speaker 3>asked her out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh</v>

1348
01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:24.350
<v Speaker 3>my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's kind of a flirt.</v>

1349
01:05:24.351 --> 01:05:26.480
<v Speaker 3>She might've put it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1350
01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:27.500
<v Speaker 3>There.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reminds me of what's the,</v>

1351
01:05:27.501 --> 01:05:28.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jet appetite.</v>

<v Speaker 3>getting in there?</v>

1353
01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:36.620
<v Speaker 3>Whenever you have obviously never had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>path you would never know.</v>

1354
01:05:36.621 --> 01:05:39.410
<v Speaker 3>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some girls are dirty bitches.</v>

1355

1360
01:05:50.370 --> 01:05:52.570
<v Speaker 3>Like putting puts her in this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like so good.</v>

1361
01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:57.620
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do dig around your cooter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could never.</v>

1362
01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.460
<v Speaker 3>I just could never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad that I live.</v>

1363
01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:03.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad it's 2014 and there are plenty </v>
<v Speaker 3>of female.</v>

1364
01:06:03.021 --> 01:06:06.170
<v Speaker 3>Ob gyn is available because back in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>day you had a male guide.</v>

1365
01:06:06.171 --> 01:06:06.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1366
01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:09.910
<v Speaker 1>because they were only do doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1367
01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1368
01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:15.750
<v Speaker 1>That would be really weird for a guy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a woman doctor that's checking out </v>

1369
01:06:15.881 --> 01:06:17.560
<v Speaker 1>your genitals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So would be odd as well.</v>

1370
01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Would you have a female doctor before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1371
01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.130
<v Speaker 1>Like grab your balls while you cough </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1372
01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the issue.</v>

1373
01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Like the man would be the predator like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the doctor,</v>

1374
01:06:29.021 --> 01:06:30.640
<v Speaker 1>the female doctor would have to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1375
01:06:30.641 --> 01:06:35.641
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's an attractive female </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor would have to deal with the dude </v>

1376
01:06:35.641 --> 01:06:37.060
<v Speaker 1>being kind of excited about a woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>checking out his balls.</v>

1377
01:06:37.061 --> 01:06:38.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep doing it.</v>

1378
01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.100
<v Speaker 1>She found it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1379
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:43.600
<v Speaker 1>That she'd probably have to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a bit for fucking sure.</v>

1380
01:06:43.810 --> 01:06:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's um,</v>

1381
01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:46.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to a friend of mount this,</v>

1382
01:06:46.691 --> 01:06:48.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day and he,</v>

1383
01:06:48.251 --> 01:06:49.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is pretty philosophical,</v>

1384
01:06:49.751 --> 01:06:54.751
<v Speaker 1>older guy and he was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been through two divorces and he </v>

1385
01:06:54.751 --> 01:06:57.670
<v Speaker 1>was talking about how sex starved so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people are like,</v>

1386
01:06:57.671 --> 01:06:59.950
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with all these scenarios </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're like,</v>

1387
01:06:59.951 --> 01:07:01.650
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy was a creep and this,</v>

1388
01:07:01.651 --> 01:07:06.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this woman is ridiculous and there are </v>

1389
01:07:06.651 --> 01:07:09.301
<v Speaker 1>people out there that no one's touching </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they are so hungry just to be held.</v>

1390
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:15.700
<v Speaker 1>and I mean this is a minor story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I was a,</v>

1391
01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:18.070
<v Speaker 1>when I first came to California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any friends,</v>

1392
01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.020
<v Speaker 1>came here from New York and I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>

1393
01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:22.840
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't happy because I didn't enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 1>acting.</v>

1394
01:07:22.841 --> 01:07:26.740
<v Speaker 1>I didn't enjoy being around actors and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have any friends and it wasn't,</v>

1395
01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:28.720
<v Speaker 1>didn't have a girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have any dates.</v>

1396
01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:33.780
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a hug from this girl in a set and </v>

1397
01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:37.540
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget that feeling of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hug because it wasn't like a sexual hug.</v>

1398
01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:42.510
<v Speaker 1>It was a friend gave me a hug and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>she gave me the hug it was like my,</v>

1399
01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:47.230
<v Speaker 1>my level One but not sexual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like love.</v>

1400
01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Like I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got touched you.</v>

1401
01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Gotta love boner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got touched for the first time in like</v>

1402
01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:54.190
<v Speaker 1>a couple weeks and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1403
01:07:54.191 --> 01:07:56.800
<v Speaker 1>you need thIs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is important for people.</v>

1404
01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:01.940
<v Speaker 3>It's totally important for people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all sorts of hormones like a </v>

1405
01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:05.361
<v Speaker 3>cascade of hormones that you set off </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you are affiliative when you're,</v>

1406
01:08:05.970 --> 01:08:10.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>close to somebody else and it's </v>

1407
01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:14.420
<v Speaker 3>absolutely necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And kind of going back to what we were </v>

1408
01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:15.440
<v Speaker 3>talking about about aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a male female difference.</v>

1409
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:21.160
<v Speaker 3>I also feel strongly that many men have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a deep need that slightly different than</v>

1410
01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:29.260
<v Speaker 3>than women that our sexual needs are </v>
<v Speaker 3>much more affiliative and emotional and </v>

1411
01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:34.340
<v Speaker 3>there is some physiological basis for </v>
<v Speaker 3>female sexual need.</v>

1412
01:08:34.341 --> 01:08:39.341
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like any girl can tell you that she's </v>

1413
01:08:39.341 --> 01:08:40.180
<v Speaker 3>had this craving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1414
01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:41.870
<v Speaker 3>this passionate feeling where she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1415
01:08:41.871 --> 01:08:46.160
<v Speaker 3>I just need to come or adjust,</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to have sex with somebody.</v>

1416
01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:50.360
<v Speaker 3>But with men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's literally a backup of fluid that</v>

1417
01:08:50.361 --> 01:08:55.361
<v Speaker 3>you have to release.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very different physiological </v>

1418
01:08:55.361 --> 01:08:58.481
<v Speaker 3>thing than women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again that goes back to </v>

1419
01:08:58.481 --> 01:08:58.481
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the same thing as you were saying,</v>

1420
01:08:58.481 --> 01:09:02.840
<v Speaker 3>mma can be really helpful for clearing </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mind and for lowering your.</v>

1421
01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:06.920
<v Speaker 3>Your base levels of aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think coming does the same thing.</v>

1422
01:09:06.921 --> 01:09:11.921
<v Speaker 3>I think it's healthy for guys to jerk </v>
<v Speaker 3>off if they're not having a lot of sex </v>

1423
01:09:11.921 --> 01:09:15.370
<v Speaker 3>because guys can get pent up and be </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive because they're not coming up</v>

1424
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.980
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're also.</v>

1425
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:17.920
<v Speaker 1>You're desperate to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1426
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:22.990
<v Speaker 1>I had a joke about it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a whole descriptive called jerk </v>

1427
01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:23.430
<v Speaker 1>off first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then think about it like anything you're</v>

1428
01:09:23.431 --> 01:09:25.830
<v Speaker 1>thinking about doing in live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any weird decision you're gonna make.</v>

1429
01:09:25.831 --> 01:09:27.450
<v Speaker 1>You're getting married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

1430
01:09:27.690 --> 01:09:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Jerk off first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then think about,</v>

1431
01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:31.380
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to decide to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1432
01:09:31.381 --> 01:09:33.510
<v Speaker 1>you're going to buy that car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to do this?</v>

1433
01:09:33.511 --> 01:09:35.760
<v Speaker 1>You're going to buy those clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerk off first.</v>

1434
01:09:35.761 --> 01:09:37.620
<v Speaker 1>And tell me if you really want to wear </v>
<v Speaker 1>alligator shoes,</v>

1435
01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.690
<v Speaker 1>what are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you wearing those?</v>

1436
01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.680
<v Speaker 1>So you're trying to attract a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>person like</v>

1437
01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:45.600
<v Speaker 3>about the little head and people guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking with that head or whatever.</v>

1438
01:09:45.601 --> 01:09:48.900
<v Speaker 3>There is a really big neurono link </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1439
01:09:48.901 --> 01:09:53.901
<v Speaker 3>There are hormones that affect your dick</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same way they affect your brain.</v>

1440
01:09:54.810 --> 01:09:59.810
<v Speaker 3>And so you can't pretend again that your</v>
<v Speaker 3>cock is somehow completely disconnected </v>

1441
01:10:00.511 --> 01:10:02.760
<v Speaker 3>from your emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from your feelings.</v>

1442
01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:03.580
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you at it,</v>

1443
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:05.950
<v Speaker 1>and also if you looked at it </v>
<v Speaker 1>objectively,</v>

1444
01:10:05.951 --> 01:10:10.450
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at the human beings on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this planet as like a giant mathematical</v>

1445
01:10:10.451 --> 01:10:11.470
<v Speaker 1>equation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would say,</v>

1446
01:10:11.471 --> 01:10:13.330
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are there so fucking many of them?</v>

1447
01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's this intense need to </v>

1448
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:20.551
<v Speaker 1>breed and this intense need to breed was</v>
<v Speaker 1>back when it was really difficult to </v>

1449
01:10:20.551 --> 01:10:20.551
<v Speaker 1>stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1450
01:10:20.551 --> 01:10:25.430
<v Speaker 1>we are essentially the same organism </v>
<v Speaker 1>that used to get cut down by each other </v>

1451
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:26.920
<v Speaker 1>by animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>predators,</v>

1452
01:10:26.921 --> 01:10:29.350
<v Speaker 1>natural illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease injuries.</v>

1453
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:31.730
<v Speaker 3>We've only been around for 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years in our,</v>

1454
01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:34.520
<v Speaker 3>in our current form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>homo sapiens as a species.</v>

1455
01:10:34.521 --> 01:10:36.200
<v Speaker 3>So before 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

1456
01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:38.600
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about something that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>different enough from us,</v>

1457
01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:41.780
<v Speaker 3>evolutionarily speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a different species.</v>

1458
01:10:42.010 --> 01:10:43.580
<v Speaker 3>Homo sapiens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200,000</v>

1459
01:10:43.581 --> 01:10:48.581
<v Speaker 3>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's long enough for a little bit of </v>

1460
01:10:48.581 --> 01:10:48.581
<v Speaker 3>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1461
01:10:48.581 --> 01:10:49.430
<v Speaker 3>we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have changed in some ways,</v>

1462
01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:54.560
<v Speaker 3>but that's not long enough for that much</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolution in many ways.</v>

1463
01:10:54.561 --> 01:10:56.780
<v Speaker 3>Biologically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologically,</v>

1464
01:10:56.781 --> 01:10:58.850
<v Speaker 3>evolutionarily speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

1465
01:10:58.851 --> 01:11:02.600
<v Speaker 3>We are the same organism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was like crawling out of the trees.</v>

1466
01:11:02.710 --> 01:11:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely primitive.</v>

1467
01:11:03.821 --> 01:11:08.821
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you also talk about the </v>

1468
01:11:08.821 --> 01:11:10.690
<v Speaker 1>biodiversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some folks that are just more </v>

1469
01:11:10.690 --> 01:11:13.171
<v Speaker 1>fucking primitive today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more animalistic or more kinetic and </v>

1470
01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:14.160
<v Speaker 1>just</v>

1471
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:19.160
<v Speaker 3>the range is so massive when we talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about what is quote normal and what is </v>

1472
01:11:20.191 --> 01:11:25.191
<v Speaker 3>hyper and hypo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So many people are so different and </v>

1473
01:11:25.191 --> 01:11:29.841
<v Speaker 3>that's why it's cool to see when people </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually manage to partner up or </v>

1474
01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:35.910
<v Speaker 3>whatever sexual or emotional </v>
<v Speaker 3>partnerships make sense for them,</v>

1475
01:11:35.911 --> 01:11:38.580
<v Speaker 3>whether they're monogamous or </v>
<v Speaker 3>polygamous,</v>

1476
01:11:38.581 --> 01:11:40.920
<v Speaker 3>whether they're um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1477
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:42.060
<v Speaker 3>gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>straight,</v>

1478
01:11:42.061 --> 01:11:47.061
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in between.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so cool when you see people that </v>

1479
01:11:47.061 --> 01:11:50.181
<v Speaker 3>make it work because they're on the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>page when there are so many differences </v>

1480
01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:52.200
<v Speaker 3>that exist out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When two people go,</v>

1481
01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:54.240
<v Speaker 3>you're awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or three or four,</v>

1482
01:11:54.241 --> 01:11:55.020
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they go,</v>

1483
01:11:55.021 --> 01:11:56.350
<v Speaker 3>you're awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm into.</v>

1484
01:11:56.370 --> 01:12:00.060
<v Speaker 3>You were into the same stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We abide by the same rules.</v>

1485
01:12:00.061 --> 01:12:05.061
<v Speaker 3>We have the same sexual proclivities and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it works like how fucking cool is that </v>

1486
01:12:05.061 --> 01:12:08.000
<v Speaker 3>because there's so many combinations out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1487
01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:13.100
<v Speaker 3>When those magnet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those two ends of the magnet kind of </v>

1488
01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:13.100
<v Speaker 3>find each other in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1489
01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:15.600
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty dope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not that common.</v>

1490
01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even like when you were talking earlier </v>

1491
01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:22.551
<v Speaker 3>about molecules and receptors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like you have to have the </v>

1492
01:12:22.551 --> 01:12:22.551
<v Speaker 3>right fit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1493
01:12:22.551 --> 01:12:25.410
<v Speaker 3>you totally do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You also have to be a good molecule.</v>

1494
01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:31.060
<v Speaker 3>It's like how many people truly have </v>
<v Speaker 3>their shit together to the point where </v>

1495
01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:34.281
<v Speaker 3>anybody would want to be with them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so many people are so god damn </v>

1496
01:12:34.281 --> 01:12:36.831
<v Speaker 3>codependent and so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they laid can attract anyone </v>

1497
01:12:36.831 --> 01:12:38.430
<v Speaker 3>because their own biology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their psychology though,</v>

1498
01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:43.500
<v Speaker 3>the mix that makes them a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just so chaotic that you can't </v>

1499
01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.240
<v Speaker 3>expect to be happy in a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're not happy alone.</v>

1500
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:50.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There has to be equity in a </v>

1501
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.270
<v Speaker 3>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can't suck the light.</v>

1502
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.490
<v Speaker 3>You can't be like a vampire and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>

1503
01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:54.330
<v Speaker 3>You have to offer somebody just as much </v>
<v Speaker 3>as you get from them and you have to be,</v>

1504
01:12:54.331 --> 01:12:56.020
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very standalone.</v>

1505
01:12:56.070 --> 01:13:01.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a common theme for me in </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy is this conversation about if I </v>

1506
01:13:02.041 --> 01:13:07.041
<v Speaker 3>am in a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling very confident and comfortable </v>

1507
01:13:07.041 --> 01:13:08.220
<v Speaker 3>because I have like an insane fear of </v>
<v Speaker 3>commitment.</v>

1508
01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:13.580
<v Speaker 3>I because I'm so used to thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>our relationship as if it's a I'm a </v>

1509
01:13:13.891 --> 01:13:18.891
<v Speaker 3>prison sentence and I've been really </v>
<v Speaker 3>relearning what it means to be in a </v>

1510
01:13:18.891 --> 01:13:23.631
<v Speaker 3>relationship with my therapist and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of living for now is a </v>

1511
01:13:26.161 --> 01:13:31.161
<v Speaker 3>healthier way to look at life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't have to think about </v>

1512
01:13:31.161 --> 01:13:35.360
<v Speaker 3>hardcore future kinds of conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if I'm comfortable with myself </v>

1513
01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:40.221
<v Speaker 3>right now and I can be comfortable with </v>
<v Speaker 3>a partner right now and not have all </v>

1514
01:13:40.891 --> 01:13:45.891
<v Speaker 3>this like sense of intense obligation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where that codependent stuff </v>

1515
01:13:45.891 --> 01:13:50.070
<v Speaker 3>comes from and that's what I think is so</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly unhealthy in a relationship.</v>

1516
01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:55.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm going to bring my best </v>
<v Speaker 3>self to the table and hopefully I'll </v>

1517
01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.980
<v Speaker 3>find a partner that does the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of needing a partner,</v>

1518
01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:02.670
<v Speaker 3>which is a common motivation for people </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get in relationships.</v>

1519
01:14:02.671 --> 01:14:04.860
<v Speaker 3>I need somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't handle it on my own.</v>

1520
01:14:04.890 --> 01:14:07.290
<v Speaker 3>Well then you're not going to end up </v>
<v Speaker 3>working it out.</v>

1521
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:10.650
<v Speaker 3>There's all those variables to like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual variable,</v>

1522
01:14:10.651 --> 01:14:12.130
<v Speaker 3>the emotional variable.</v>

1523
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:15.520
<v Speaker 2>There's so many different things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going on and then it's almost like,</v>

1524
01:14:15.521 --> 01:14:17.050
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found this waterhole.</v>

1525
01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:19.690
<v Speaker 2>I can't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I finally found water.</v>

1526
01:14:19.691 --> 01:14:24.691
<v Speaker 2>I was alone like my experience of going </v>
<v Speaker 2>several weeks without being hugged and </v>

1527
01:14:24.731 --> 01:14:26.330
<v Speaker 2>then being hugged and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1528
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:28.840
<v Speaker 2>and that was just a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was someone on the set.</v>

1529
01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:34.020
<v Speaker 2>The difference between that and someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's gone years without a relationship </v>

1530
01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:38.461
<v Speaker 2>that really worked and you finally have </v>
<v Speaker 2>one that works and you fuck it up </v>

1531
01:14:38.461 --> 01:14:38.500
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] you too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn clingy and too crazy.</v>

1532
01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:39.880
<v Speaker 2>Where are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are you?</v>

1533
01:14:39.881 --> 01:14:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Why aren't you home?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm texting you,</v>

1534
01:14:41.141 --> 01:14:42.520
<v Speaker 2>why aren't you texting me back </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately?</v>

1535
01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:45.460
<v Speaker 2>That kind of shit is what makes me run </v>
<v Speaker 2>out the door.</v>

1536
01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:50.710
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm talking about when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about my quote unquote fear of </v>

1537
01:14:50.710 --> 01:14:53.371
<v Speaker 2>commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it really is is it's an intense </v>

1538
01:14:53.371 --> 01:14:56.260
<v Speaker 2>feeling of stress when I feel obligated </v>
<v Speaker 2>to somebody else,</v>

1539
01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:01.440
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in the healthiest relationships I've </v>

1540
01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:04.711
<v Speaker 2>been in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationships where there's not a </v>

1541
01:15:04.711 --> 01:15:05.650
<v Speaker 2>lot of jealousy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a lot of possession,</v>

1542
01:15:05.651 --> 01:15:08.650
<v Speaker 2>not a lot of that checking in and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just trust.</v>

1543
01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:11.290
<v Speaker 2>You trust each other and when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>really into somebody,</v>

1544
01:15:11.291 --> 01:15:13.810
<v Speaker 2>you want to be around them and you spend</v>
<v Speaker 2>time with them,</v>

1545
01:15:13.811 --> 01:15:15.250
<v Speaker 2>but when you want to be around your </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>

1546
01:15:15.251 --> 01:15:16.330
<v Speaker 2>they're not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are you?</v>

1547
01:15:16.331 --> 01:15:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Why aren't you checking in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When are you coming home?</v>

1548
01:15:17.891 --> 01:15:19.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck off dude.</v>

1549
01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:21.430
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't want to be with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's going to be like this,</v>

1550
01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:24.310
<v Speaker 2>there are friends like that and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>brutal and you got to cut them off.</v>

1551
01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:25.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do because that's.</v>

1552
01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:30.540
<v Speaker 2>That's that codependency and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens when you end up with two people </v>

1553
01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:33.301
<v Speaker 2>were like that with each other and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>less and less learn how to exist on </v>

1554
01:15:33.301 --> 01:15:38.221
<v Speaker 2>their own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then when they finally do break it </v>

1555
01:15:38.221 --> 01:15:38.620
<v Speaker 2>off because it's obviously unhealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they're fucked.</v>

1556
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:43.750
<v Speaker 2>Then it takes all this healing to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to a place where they're </v>

1557
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:43.750
<v Speaker 2>independent again.</v>

1558
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so true.</v>

1559
01:15:44.231 --> 01:15:49.231
<v Speaker 2>And iT's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing when you find those </v>

1560
01:15:49.231 --> 01:15:49.320
<v Speaker 2>two people that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't be a part.</v>

1561
01:15:49.321 --> 01:15:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Like they literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't go everywhere together.</v>

1562
01:15:51.810 --> 01:15:55.240
<v Speaker 2>They roast like nobody wants to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>around them.</v>

1563
01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:58.240
<v Speaker 2>They're the worst friends like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you?</v>

1564
01:15:59.390 --> 01:16:00.850
<v Speaker 2>I cut off all my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1565
01:16:00.851 --> 01:16:03.610
<v Speaker 2>you have no friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm your friend.</v>

1566
01:16:03.611 --> 01:16:05.100
<v Speaker 2>fuck face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>

1567
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:06.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean all my shit friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1568
01:16:06.891 --> 01:16:07.840
<v Speaker 2>you're shit for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

1569
01:16:08.410 --> 01:16:10.720
<v Speaker 2>cutting off shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Friends is just.</v>

1570
01:16:10.721 --> 01:16:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Me and my girl were out there riding </v>
<v Speaker 2>motorcycles.</v>

1571
01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the older you get,</v>

1572
01:16:16.601 --> 01:16:18.790
<v Speaker 2>you just realized why my friends with </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people.</v>

1573
01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:20.410
<v Speaker 2>That happens to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1574
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:25.470
<v Speaker 2>When you're younger you need a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>support and I think the older you get </v>

1575
01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:29.221
<v Speaker 2>the more you value your alone time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you realize that good </v>

1576
01:16:29.221 --> 01:16:33.421
<v Speaker 2>relationships and good friendship </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't feel like work and once they </v>

1577
01:16:33.421 --> 01:16:33.910
<v Speaker 2>start to feel like work you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1578
01:16:33.911 --> 01:16:35.700
<v Speaker 2>I have too many obligations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibilities.</v>

1579
01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have to work to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends with you.</v>

1580
01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Also I have a lot of friends that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>like super empowering.</v>

1581
01:16:41.021 --> 01:16:43.390
<v Speaker 2>Like when I'm around them I want to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

1582
01:16:43.391 --> 01:16:46.000
<v Speaker 2>I want to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get stimulated,</v>

1583
01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:51.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think better my mind functioning like </v>

1584
01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:52.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm inspired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very lucky to have that.</v>

1585
01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:53.500
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1586
01:16:53.501 --> 01:16:58.501
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about your experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you first came to los angeles and </v>

1587
01:16:58.501 --> 01:17:01.680
<v Speaker 2>not having a lot of friends and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being depressed and so when I first </v>

1588
01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:04.720
<v Speaker 2>moved to la I was in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm usually not that comfortable talking</v>

1589
01:17:04.721 --> 01:17:09.721
<v Speaker 2>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for some reason I'm going through </v>

1590
01:17:09.721 --> 01:17:11.011
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was living in New York and I was </v>

1591
01:17:11.011 --> 01:17:11.011
<v Speaker 2>working on my phd and then I started </v>
<v Speaker 2>dating</v>

1592
01:17:11.011 --> 01:17:13.550
<v Speaker 3>bill maher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's why I came to los angeles is</v>

1593
01:17:13.551 --> 01:17:17.240
<v Speaker 3>because we started dating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was living in New York.</v>

1594
01:17:17.241 --> 01:17:21.080
<v Speaker 3>I would kind of come and go and see him </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we weren't committed to each other.</v>

1595
01:17:21.081 --> 01:17:23.180
<v Speaker 3>I had a life on the west or on the east </v>
<v Speaker 3>coast.</v>

1596
01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:28.420
<v Speaker 3>He had his life here on the west coast </v>
<v Speaker 3>and eventually we got close enough that </v>

1597
01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:28.420
<v Speaker 3>we decided,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1598
01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:29.360
<v Speaker 3>let's give this thing a go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I was like,</v>

1599
01:17:29.361 --> 01:17:34.361
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was actually really not happy in my </v>

1600
01:17:34.361 --> 01:17:34.970
<v Speaker 3>degree program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in some ways it was a double whammy.</v>

1601
01:17:34.971 --> 01:17:39.971
<v Speaker 3>I was very happy to be exploring a </v>
<v Speaker 3>deeper relationship with this guy that </v>

1602
01:17:39.971 --> 01:17:43.631
<v Speaker 3>I'd grown to love and also I was more </v>
<v Speaker 3>and more not happy with my situation in </v>

1603
01:17:44.391 --> 01:17:46.670
<v Speaker 3>New York and so it was a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity.</v>

1604
01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:51.970
<v Speaker 3>I moved out to la and we ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 3>ended up dating very seriously for about</v>

1605
01:17:52.011 --> 01:17:57.011
<v Speaker 3>three years and that was my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my first la experience was bizarre as </v>

1606
01:17:58.221 --> 01:17:58.550
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

1607
01:17:58.550 --> 01:18:03.550
<v Speaker 3>I was dating somebody who was incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>famous in the public eye who had a lot </v>

1608
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:06.911
<v Speaker 3>of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a big equity problem in the </v>

1609
01:18:06.911 --> 01:18:10.091
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what I was going to do </v>

1610
01:18:10.091 --> 01:18:10.091
<v Speaker 3>with my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had just left my degree program.</v>

1611
01:18:10.091 --> 01:18:11.720
<v Speaker 3>I was searching for answers and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>young.</v>

1612
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:14.030
<v Speaker 3>I was 24,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1613
01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:17.780
<v Speaker 3>but I had no friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none.</v>

1614
01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:20.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was friends with people in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their fifties,</v>

1615
01:18:21.170 --> 01:18:23.900
<v Speaker 3>like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was my social circle and yeah,</v>

1616
01:18:23.901 --> 01:18:26.130
<v Speaker 3>I would meet people like I would hang </v>
<v Speaker 3>out with sarah silverman,</v>

1617
01:18:26.150 --> 01:18:28.010
<v Speaker 3>a little bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they weren't really my friends.</v>

1618
01:18:28.011 --> 01:18:33.011
<v Speaker 3>I was the come along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was the girlfriend and there were all </v>

1619
01:18:33.011 --> 01:18:33.020
<v Speaker 3>very nice to me and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a weird life,</v>

1620
01:18:33.021 --> 01:18:38.021
<v Speaker 3>but it was almost like I was living </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody else's life and I was pretty </v>

1621
01:18:38.021 --> 01:18:40.640
<v Speaker 3>depressed and I was very lucky to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>my best friend at the time,</v>

1622
01:18:40.641 --> 01:18:45.641
<v Speaker 3>kelly was still living in dallas where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>grew up and I'm kind of worked with her </v>

1623
01:18:46.701 --> 01:18:47.750
<v Speaker 3>and hooked her up with a job.</v>

1624
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:52.750
<v Speaker 3>Working with bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She ended up becoming his wardrobe </v>

1625
01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:52.750
<v Speaker 3>stylist and she still does that to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

1626
01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:55.160
<v Speaker 3>which is really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a huge opportunity for her.</v>

1627
01:18:55.161 --> 01:18:56.900
<v Speaker 3>She always wanted to come to la.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1628
01:18:56.930 --> 01:19:00.770
<v Speaker 3>And now she's this incredible celebrity </v>
<v Speaker 3>stylist and has this great job.</v>

1629
01:19:00.771 --> 01:19:01.970
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

1630
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:07.030
<v Speaker 3>so I was very lucky when she first came </v>
<v Speaker 3>out maybe six months later because we </v>

1631
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.070
<v Speaker 3>got an apartment together and I finally </v>
<v Speaker 3>had somebody,</v>

1632
01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:12.020
<v Speaker 3>but I just had her and it took probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>until just a couple of years ago.</v>

1633
01:19:12.021 --> 01:19:17.021
<v Speaker 3>So now that's maybe been five years out </v>
<v Speaker 3>before I met this group of friends that </v>

1634
01:19:17.021 --> 01:19:19.220
<v Speaker 3>we affectionately call each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The nerd brigade.</v>

1635
01:19:19.650 --> 01:19:24.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We hashtag nerd brigade on twitter all </v>

1636
01:19:24.650 --> 01:19:26.420
<v Speaker 3>the time and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my best friends just finished her</v>

1637
01:19:26.421 --> 01:19:28.670
<v Speaker 3>phd in molecular neuroscience from </v>
<v Speaker 3>caltech.</v>

1638
01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:33.020
<v Speaker 3>One of my other best friends got his phd</v>
<v Speaker 3>from usc in animal cognition.</v>

1639
01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:37.240
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another neuroscience student at caltech.</v>

1640
01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:38.690
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1641
01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:42.740
<v Speaker 3>has a marine biology degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all like science communicators,</v>

1642
01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:45.140
<v Speaker 3>writers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>academics,</v>

1643
01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:47.150
<v Speaker 3>but cool young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>edgy,</v>

1644
01:19:47.151 --> 01:19:50.180
<v Speaker 3>fun people who like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get each other,</v>

1645
01:19:50.690 --> 01:19:53.840
<v Speaker 3>we're friends because we have a lot in </v>
<v Speaker 3>common.</v>

1646
01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:59.080
<v Speaker 3>It took a long time to get close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people and to meet them and to </v>

1647
01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.520
<v Speaker 3>finally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because la is a fucking hard city.</v>

1648
01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:05.910
<v Speaker 3>If you're used to living in a university</v>
<v Speaker 3>town like there,</v>

1649
01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:09.390
<v Speaker 3>it's so hard to you in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well first I was in denton,</v>

1650
01:20:09.391 --> 01:20:14.391
<v Speaker 3>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where I did my undergrad and my </v>

1651
01:20:14.391 --> 01:20:14.391
<v Speaker 3>master's at the university of north </v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas.</v>

1652
01:20:14.391 --> 01:20:17.840
<v Speaker 3>And then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in New York city but I was living </v>

1653
01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:18.660
<v Speaker 3>in queens specifically in forest hills </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I would take the bus to flushing</v>

1654
01:20:18.661 --> 01:20:21.810
<v Speaker 3>every day to um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to queens college.</v>

1655
01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:24.930
<v Speaker 3>That's where I was working on mY phd at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the city,</v>

1656
01:20:24.931 --> 01:20:26.400
<v Speaker 3>university of New York graduate center.</v>

1657
01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.090
<v Speaker 3>But queens college was my campus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1658
01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:31.500
<v Speaker 3>a lot of my friends live in pasedena </v>
<v Speaker 3>still,</v>

1659
01:20:31.501 --> 01:20:33.920
<v Speaker 3>which is very much a college town </v>
<v Speaker 3>because their cow,</v>

1660
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:36.540
<v Speaker 3>they were caltech students and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're working there or,</v>

1661
01:20:36.541 --> 01:20:37.860
<v Speaker 3>or some of them are still taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>courses.</v>

1662
01:20:37.861 --> 01:20:42.861
<v Speaker 3>But I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean brian just shook his head like </v>

1663
01:20:42.861 --> 01:20:45.950
<v Speaker 3>la,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to meet smart people in this </v>

1664
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:46.290
<v Speaker 3>city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so full of fucking vapid people and</v>

1665
01:20:46.291 --> 01:20:48.900
<v Speaker 3>people who will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned this quickly.</v>

1666
01:20:49.290 --> 01:20:54.290
<v Speaker 3>I moved to la dating somebody who was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like an a list celebrity and all of a </v>

1667
01:20:55.231 --> 01:20:56.760
<v Speaker 3>sudden I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

1668
01:20:56.761 --> 01:20:58.890
<v Speaker 3>why do you want to be friends with me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

1669
01:20:58.891 --> 01:21:02.400
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also date I dated another very,</v>

1670
01:21:02.401 --> 01:21:04.670
<v Speaker 3>very famous person in my life where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

1671
01:21:04.690 --> 01:21:07.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't publicly talk about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship at all just to respect each</v>

1672
01:21:07.771 --> 01:21:10.740
<v Speaker 3>other's privacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I wouLd learn things about people.</v>

1673
01:21:10.770 --> 01:21:14.550
<v Speaker 3>Like I had this one group of friends who</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought were my friends,</v>

1674
01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:19.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I remember dating this person and </v>

1675
01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:19.840
<v Speaker 3>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1676
01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:20.520
<v Speaker 3>do you want to come to a barbecue?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1677
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:21.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1678
01:21:21.391 --> 01:21:23.100
<v Speaker 3>so and so thought that you might want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>play tennis.</v>

1679
01:21:23.101 --> 01:21:24.900
<v Speaker 3>We're going to do it at so and so's </v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

1680
01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:25.860
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so and so we'll be there.</v>

1681
01:21:25.890 --> 01:21:26.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm totally down.</v>

1682
01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:29.440
<v Speaker 3>And you would get that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This like,</v>

1683
01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:32.040
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that why you're friends with me?</v>

1684
01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:38.120
<v Speaker 3>Thing is very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a weird experience that I </v>

1685
01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:39.000
<v Speaker 3>think a lot of people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never even imagined.</v>

1686
01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:41.010
<v Speaker 3>But it also has opened a million doors </v>
<v Speaker 3>for me.</v>

1687
01:21:41.011 --> 01:21:43.890
<v Speaker 3>Like how the fuck you think when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>23 years old,</v>

1688
01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:48.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cutting up mice or birds and digging </v>

1689
01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:49.020
<v Speaker 3>around in their brains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1690
01:21:49.290 --> 01:21:54.290
<v Speaker 3>I always thought I was going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bench scientist and that's what I was </v>

1691
01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:54.990
<v Speaker 3>going to do and I kind of hated it.</v>

1692
01:21:55.050 --> 01:21:57.840
<v Speaker 3>I loved teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of hated doing the lab work,</v>

1693
01:21:57.841 --> 01:21:58.470
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1694
01:21:58.471 --> 01:22:01.590
<v Speaker 3>this is the path I'm on and this is who </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck.</v>

1695
01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:02.700
<v Speaker 3>If somebody had told me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1696
01:22:02.701 --> 01:22:07.701
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be in media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be on the joe rogan </v>

1697
01:22:07.701 --> 01:22:07.701
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to start your own podcast.</v>

1698
01:22:07.701 --> 01:22:09.030
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be on television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

1699
01:22:09.031 --> 01:22:10.950
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking out of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm scared of camp.</v>

1700
01:22:11.610 --> 01:22:16.610
<v Speaker 3>When I was in Texas at 16,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried out for season two of american </v>

1701
01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:17.770
<v Speaker 3>idol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You sing?</v>

1702
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a jazz singer and qa.</v>

1703
01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:25.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I made it through for callbacks </v>

1704
01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:26.280
<v Speaker 3>and season two american idol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made it through the producers,</v>

1705
01:22:26.281 --> 01:22:27.590
<v Speaker 3>the executive producers more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>ExActly.</v>

1706
01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:30.180
<v Speaker 3>I finally got to the three judges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who were they?</v>

1707
01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:35.410
<v Speaker 3>The main ones?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like randy and paula and simon </v>

1708
01:22:35.410 --> 01:22:35.410
<v Speaker 3>cow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1709
01:22:35.410 --> 01:22:38.170
<v Speaker 3>so that was the last audition you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>before you have the book.</v>

1710
01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:39.510
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know why I didn't get it.</v>

1711
01:22:39.511 --> 01:22:41.400
<v Speaker 3>All three of them said like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>

1712
01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:42.630
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd like your voice.</v>

1713
01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:44.940
<v Speaker 3>We like your look because I was a total </v>
<v Speaker 3>punk rock kid.</v>

1714
01:22:44.941 --> 01:22:49.290
<v Speaker 3>I had short spiky hair and my lip ring </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the arm is very avril levine,</v>

1715
01:22:49.291 --> 01:22:51.240
<v Speaker 3>kind of a look back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>

1716
01:22:51.241 --> 01:22:52.400
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we love it all your,</v>

1717
01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:54.060
<v Speaker 3>you're the total package.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1718
01:22:54.061 --> 01:22:59.061
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I auditioned and they were </v>

1719
01:22:59.061 --> 01:22:59.061
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going through.</v>

1720
01:22:59.061 --> 01:22:59.070
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why?</v>

1721
01:22:59.071 --> 01:23:00.810
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are not tv ready.</v>

1722
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:05.870
<v Speaker 3>I was so afraid of the cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like didn't have that dynamic </v>

1723
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:07.240
<v Speaker 3>personality that all of the reality tv </v>
<v Speaker 3>stars have where they're like,</v>

1724
01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:10.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to win this competition </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm the best.</v>

1725
01:23:10.450 --> 01:23:15.450
<v Speaker 3>I just walked up and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you ready for me to say I'm so </v>

1726
01:23:15.450 --> 01:23:15.450
<v Speaker 3>scared?</v>

1727
01:23:15.450 --> 01:23:16.390
<v Speaker 3>Like it was I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was weak.</v>

1728
01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:21.391
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of self assertive thing going </v>

1729
01:23:21.461 --> 01:23:23.350
<v Speaker 3>on to develop that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I did.</v>

1730
01:23:23.351 --> 01:23:25.120
<v Speaker 3>I think it happened from getting thrown </v>
<v Speaker 3>into it.</v>

1731
01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:27.700
<v Speaker 3>I think what happens is when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1732
01:23:27.701 --> 01:23:28.630
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just working.</v>

1733
01:23:28.631 --> 01:23:33.631
<v Speaker 3>I met him in the lab also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I taught between then and now I've </v>

1734
01:23:33.631 --> 01:23:37.411
<v Speaker 3>taught like a million courses so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>helps you stand up in front of a </v>

1735
01:23:37.411 --> 01:23:37.780
<v Speaker 3>classroom and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't understand glycolysis,</v>

1736
01:23:37.781 --> 01:23:42.781
<v Speaker 3>we're going to figure this out together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up on the whiteboard and you're helping </v>

1737
01:23:42.781 --> 01:23:45.241
<v Speaker 3>the students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that helps with your confidence for </v>

1738
01:23:45.241 --> 01:23:45.241
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also I think getting thrown into it.</v>

1739
01:23:45.241 --> 01:23:46.390
<v Speaker 3>I come to la and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1740
01:23:46.391 --> 01:23:49.090
<v Speaker 3>let's go to the emmys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's walk this red carpet,</v>

1741
01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:50.620
<v Speaker 3>let's do all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>

1742
01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:55.800
<v Speaker 3>you're all the sudden in the room with </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these really important people and </v>

1743
01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:55.810
<v Speaker 3>you don't even know who they are.</v>

1744
01:23:56.050 --> 01:24:01.050
<v Speaker 3>Like I would go to parties where every </v>
<v Speaker 3>single person there was a celebrity and </v>

1745
01:24:01.050 --> 01:24:04.921
<v Speaker 3>the people you didn't recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't recognize because they owned </v>

1746
01:24:04.921 --> 01:24:07.291
<v Speaker 3>movie studios.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's the weirdest feeling and then </v>

1747
01:24:07.291 --> 01:24:10.120
<v Speaker 3>once you realize I'm not that different </v>
<v Speaker 3>from these people,</v>

1748
01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:15.180
<v Speaker 3>I can have a conversation with them like</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone else and I would talk about </v>

1749
01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:15.180
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

1750
01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:16.180
<v Speaker 3>science is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you this story.</v>

1751
01:24:16.181 --> 01:24:16.630
<v Speaker 3>And they'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1752
01:24:16.631 --> 01:24:19.150
<v Speaker 3>that's kInd of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then eventually bill was like,</v>

1753
01:24:19.151 --> 01:24:24.151
<v Speaker 3>you need to be doing this on television,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to be trying this at least </v>

1754
01:24:24.151 --> 01:24:27.580
<v Speaker 3>because I think you'd be good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He completely and utterly pushed me into</v>

1755
01:24:27.581 --> 01:24:32.581
<v Speaker 3>this and I thank him everyday for it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I never would have done it </v>

1756
01:24:32.581 --> 01:24:33.280
<v Speaker 3>without his help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the depression started when I was a</v>

1757
01:24:33.281 --> 01:24:38.281
<v Speaker 3>child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you were dealing with it your whole </v>

1758
01:24:38.281 --> 01:24:38.281
<v Speaker 3>lot?</v>

1759
01:24:38.281 --> 01:24:38.281
<v Speaker 3>My whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh completely.</v>

1760
01:24:38.281 --> 01:24:42.630
<v Speaker 3>Some of those years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when I was dating bill or when I </v>

1761
01:24:42.630 --> 01:24:45.151
<v Speaker 3>would be moving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those were some of the worst years </v>

1762
01:24:45.151 --> 01:24:47.430
<v Speaker 3>because it was so stressful because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have friends because I was </v>

1763
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.430
<v Speaker 3>unmedicated unmedicated then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1764
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:49.510
<v Speaker 3>I didn't start taking medication until </v>
<v Speaker 3>about three years ago.</v>

1765
01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:53.620
<v Speaker 3>About 27.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you try other methods to try?</v>

1766
01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:58.330
<v Speaker 3>I tried some things and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been in therapy my whole life.</v>

1767
01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:03.360
<v Speaker 3>My parents first put me in therapy when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they first started to decide that they </v>

1768
01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:04.480
<v Speaker 3>were thinking about getting a divorce </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was a young man.</v>

1769
01:25:04.481 --> 01:25:09.481
<v Speaker 3>I was maybe six or seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so from the time I remember I've </v>

1770
01:25:09.481 --> 01:25:11.650
<v Speaker 3>understood the therapeutic process and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they always really promoted that in me.</v>

1771
01:25:11.651 --> 01:25:14.710
<v Speaker 3>so then even after the divorce and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>re marriages and all of that,</v>

1772
01:25:14.711 --> 01:25:16.150
<v Speaker 3>I started doing the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1773
01:25:16.230 --> 01:25:18.070
<v Speaker 3>the therapy thing on my own.</v>

1774
01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:20.320
<v Speaker 3>Then when I went to college and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>very much on my own,</v>

1775
01:25:20.321 --> 01:25:21.730
<v Speaker 3>I went to college when I was 16,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

1776
01:25:21.731 --> 01:25:24.020
<v Speaker 3>I've lived on my own at 60.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was fucking weird kid.</v>

1777
01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was a little.</v>

1778
01:25:25.271 --> 01:25:26.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wasn't.</v>

1779
01:25:26.770 --> 01:25:27.850
<v Speaker 3>I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to therapy.</v>

1780
01:25:27.851 --> 01:25:30.700
<v Speaker 3>I did all those things by myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I always had this mental block.</v>

1781
01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:32.620
<v Speaker 3>I always had this like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1782
01:25:32.621 --> 01:25:35.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't need meds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>meds means you're really crazy.</v>

1783
01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:41.100
<v Speaker 3>Meds means you really don't have control</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not until I kind of hit a very bad </v>

1784
01:25:41.981 --> 01:25:45.760
<v Speaker 3>rock bottom a few,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe three years ago did I finally say,</v>

1785
01:25:45.761 --> 01:25:46.570
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>

1786
01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:49.540
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I actUally have to do this.</v>

1787
01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:52.990
<v Speaker 3>I think it would be good for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it was the same experience that</v>

1788
01:25:52.991 --> 01:25:56.770
<v Speaker 3>I've heard over and over and over from </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were finally they get on the meds</v>

1789
01:25:56.771 --> 01:26:01.771
<v Speaker 3>that are right for them and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>calibrate to their dosage and maybe </v>

1790
01:26:01.771 --> 01:26:05.100
<v Speaker 3>they've been on it for about two months </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they just have this epiphany of </v>

1791
01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:05.270
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why the fuck did I wait so long?</v>

1792
01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:07.460
<v Speaker 3>I could have felt like this my whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1793
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:12.950
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck was I thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you're so societaly,</v>

1794
01:26:13.130 --> 01:26:17.930
<v Speaker 3>we're so resistant to looking at mental </v>
<v Speaker 3>illness the same way we look at physical</v>

1795
01:26:17.931 --> 01:26:20.630
<v Speaker 3>illness where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's so easy.</v>

1796
01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>paul gil martin just made this point </v>

1797
01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:27.581
<v Speaker 3>when he was on my podcast last week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you went up to somebody with diabetes</v>

1798
01:26:28.190 --> 01:26:30.590
<v Speaker 3>type one diabetes and you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck dude,</v>

1799
01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:35.480
<v Speaker 3>why don't you just think more positively</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that your pancreas makes insulin?</v>

1800
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:36.830
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with you?</v>

1801
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:40.310
<v Speaker 3>Why can't you just make more insulin?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they'd be like,</v>

1802
01:26:40.311 --> 01:26:43.460
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing with depression.</v>

1803
01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:48.700
<v Speaker 3>People put the onus on you like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look at it like it's a disease of </v>

1804
01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:49.550
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>

1805
01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:54.640
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a biological illness and that's </v>

1806
01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:57.260
<v Speaker 3>just very hard for people to understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so what you end up doing is carrying</v>

1807
01:26:57.261 --> 01:26:59.630
<v Speaker 3>around a lot of guilt and shame and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of feelings like,</v>

1808
01:26:59.631 --> 01:27:04.631
<v Speaker 3>I'm not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't will myself out of this if I </v>

1809
01:27:04.631 --> 01:27:04.640
<v Speaker 3>just think more positively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about that,</v>

1810
01:27:04.670 --> 01:27:07.220
<v Speaker 3>and I did that for years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1811
01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:11.030
<v Speaker 3>You just deal with it and I destroyed so</v>
<v Speaker 3>many relationships.</v>

1812
01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1813
01:27:13.081 --> 01:27:16.350
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine being trapped in that</v>

1814
01:27:16.351 --> 01:27:18.930
<v Speaker 1>scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm.</v>

1815
01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:23.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm also very sensitive to the variables</v>
<v Speaker 1>that different people go through with </v>

1816
01:27:24.331 --> 01:27:26.160
<v Speaker 1>their bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have hypothyroidism.</v>

1817
01:27:26.161 --> 01:27:28.620
<v Speaker 1>I have to take thyroid medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It runs in my family,</v>

1818
01:27:28.621 --> 01:27:33.210
<v Speaker 1>my mother has it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know I used to get headaches,</v>

1819
01:27:33.570 --> 01:27:35.760
<v Speaker 1>these weird headaches at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day where I was like,</v>

1820
01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:38.220
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I could fall asleep.</v>

1821
01:27:38.221 --> 01:27:40.560
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like I was like,</v>

1822
01:27:40.561 --> 01:27:42.960
<v Speaker 1>now I get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to sleep,</v>

1823
01:27:42.961 --> 01:27:47.680
<v Speaker 1>but it was like I could fall asleep just</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching tv and be out for like an hour.</v>

1824
01:27:47.681 --> 01:27:49.890
<v Speaker 1>So it didn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a weird tired,</v>

1825
01:27:49.891 --> 01:27:52.020
<v Speaker 1>like I was in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1826
01:27:52.021 --> 01:27:53.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I get these weird headaches.</v>

1827
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:56.310
<v Speaker 1>And then once I finally got on </v>
<v Speaker 1>medication I was like,</v>

1828
01:27:56.311 --> 01:27:56.790
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

1829
01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:58.070
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1830
01:27:58.220 --> 01:27:58.710
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1831
01:27:58.711 --> 01:28:02.100
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what other people feel like,</v>

1832
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:05.340
<v Speaker 3>like I thought I was normal because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another thing.</v>

1833
01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:10.520
<v Speaker 3>There's such a stigma in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just about mental illness but about </v>

1834
01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:13.470
<v Speaker 3>any sort of illness where people can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>openly freely talk about it.</v>

1835
01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:17.070
<v Speaker 3>So you end up living in this weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>bubble where you don't really like,</v>

1836
01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:20.910
<v Speaker 3>I know people that have mental illness </v>
<v Speaker 3>that didn't even realize they had mental</v>

1837
01:28:20.911 --> 01:28:25.911
<v Speaker 3>illness until they finally had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with a doctor about it and </v>

1838
01:28:25.911 --> 01:28:25.911
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1839
01:28:25.911 --> 01:28:30.141
<v Speaker 3>this isn't normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everybody doesn't hear voices or </v>

1840
01:28:30.141 --> 01:28:30.141
<v Speaker 3>everybody doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1841
01:28:30.141 --> 01:28:34.821
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're so afraid to talk to </v>

1842
01:28:34.821 --> 01:28:34.980
<v Speaker 3>somebody about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

1843
01:28:34.981 --> 01:28:39.981
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a really important part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this I think is just getting past the </v>

1844
01:28:41.311 --> 01:28:43.140
<v Speaker 3>stigma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why when something like this with</v>

1845
01:28:43.141 --> 01:28:46.350
<v Speaker 3>robin williams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is so fucking depressing happens a</v>

1846
01:28:46.351 --> 01:28:49.260
<v Speaker 3>lot of people rally around it and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1847
01:28:49.290 --> 01:28:54.290
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we can use this as a teaching </v>

1848
01:28:54.290 --> 01:28:55.470
<v Speaker 3>moment because this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter how good his life was,</v>

1849
01:28:55.920 --> 01:29:00.920
<v Speaker 3>he had this thing that he ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't kick and it wasn't his fault.</v>

1850
01:29:01.650 --> 01:29:02.130
<v Speaker 3>It just</v>

1851
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.830
<v Speaker 2>is that way sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And hey,</v>

1852
01:29:04.831 --> 01:29:09.090
<v Speaker 2>maybe you have it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in some ways it's good when high</v>

1853
01:29:09.091 --> 01:29:14.091
<v Speaker 2>functioning People come out and talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about their illnesses because then </v>

1854
01:29:14.091 --> 01:29:16.440
<v Speaker 2>people who are actually experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like loss of employment,</v>

1855
01:29:16.441 --> 01:29:17.850
<v Speaker 2>loss of a loved one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1856
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.530
<v Speaker 2>or who have had a bad go of it for other</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons or like even you,</v>

1857
01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:23.550
<v Speaker 2>like you had said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even you,</v>

1858
01:29:23.850 --> 01:29:26.180
<v Speaker 2>but you're pretty or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're successful,</v>

1859
01:29:26.210 --> 01:29:27.560
<v Speaker 2>you're whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1860
01:29:27.570 --> 01:29:32.570
<v Speaker 2>if you could have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then of course it's not weird that I </v>

1861
01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:32.570
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1862
01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:36.390
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's a good thing for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to see that they're not alone</v>

1863
01:29:36.391 --> 01:29:41.391
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also there's a bunch of people that </v>

1864
01:29:41.391 --> 01:29:45.441
<v Speaker 2>attribute other people's depression </v>
<v Speaker 2>really irresponsibly to a bunch of </v>

1865
01:29:45.481 --> 01:29:46.690
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1866
01:29:47.730 --> 01:29:52.730
<v Speaker 2>I had gotten the podcast last week that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was saying that robin williams killed </v>

1867
01:29:52.730 --> 01:29:55.401
<v Speaker 2>himself because his wife's ex wives took</v>
<v Speaker 2>all his money as if he knows it all.</v>

1868
01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:57.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1869
01:29:57.591 --> 01:30:02.591
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glAd you're such an expert and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that it was a women's </v>

1870
01:30:02.591 --> 01:30:05.751
<v Speaker 2>addiction to free stuff that was loose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so horrible and it makes you want</v>

1871
01:30:05.791 --> 01:30:08.850
<v Speaker 2>to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck are you to presume that you</v>

1872
01:30:08.851 --> 01:30:11.100
<v Speaker 2>know what's happening in somebody else's</v>
<v Speaker 2>head ever?</v>

1873
01:30:11.130 --> 01:30:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's insanely you're responsible to go </v>

1874
01:30:16.130 --> 01:30:16.130
<v Speaker 2>against the grain of science and </v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine,</v>

1875
01:30:16.130 --> 01:30:18.270
<v Speaker 2>which is clearly established that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>an illness.</v>

1876
01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:19.510
<v Speaker 2>It's an illness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1877
01:30:19.650 --> 01:30:24.650
<v Speaker 2>and I think that that's something too </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of people don't understand </v>

1878
01:30:24.650 --> 01:30:28.101
<v Speaker 2>the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're so comfortable with concepts of </v>

1879
01:30:28.101 --> 01:30:31.730
<v Speaker 2>diagnosis and cure because we're so used</v>
<v Speaker 2>to things like flu cold,</v>

1880
01:30:32.190 --> 01:30:33.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1881
01:30:34.170 --> 01:30:35.760
<v Speaker 2>tonsil infection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1882
01:30:35.761 --> 01:30:40.761
<v Speaker 2>where you take an antibiotic or you take</v>
<v Speaker 2>an antiviral or you just wait in your </v>

1883
01:30:40.761 --> 01:30:43.831
<v Speaker 2>immune system clears the disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're used to catching things and then </v>

1884
01:30:43.950 --> 01:30:44.910
<v Speaker 2>eliminating them.</v>

1885
01:30:45.090 --> 01:30:49.200
<v Speaker 2>But when you have disease states that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are processed,</v>

1886
01:30:49.201 --> 01:30:52.380
<v Speaker 2>states like cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like diabetes,</v>

1887
01:30:52.381 --> 01:30:57.000
<v Speaker 2>like mental illness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no cure per se.</v>

1888
01:30:57.030 --> 01:31:02.030
<v Speaker 2>like I even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a tweet just earlier today from </v>

1889
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.030
<v Speaker 2>somebody who is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1890
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.030
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

1891
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.030
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever thought about blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1892
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:03.410
<v Speaker 2>blah to cure your depression?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1893
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:06.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not cured of depression because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>take attallah pram,</v>

1894
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:11.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm in treatment puts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be in treatment the rest of my </v>

1895
01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:15.021
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe as a person who's a </v>

1896
01:31:15.021 --> 01:31:18.291
<v Speaker 2>neuroscientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it possible that they could </v>

1897
01:31:18.291 --> 01:31:20.811
<v Speaker 2>eventually come up with something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>balances your brain out instead of just </v>

1898
01:31:20.811 --> 01:31:24.980
<v Speaker 2>adding something to your neurochemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which sort of enhances your serotonin </v>

1899
01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:25.920
<v Speaker 2>levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but rather something that where they can</v>

1900
01:31:25.921 --> 01:31:28.050
<v Speaker 2>get it at a genetic level?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>

1901
01:31:28.110 --> 01:31:28.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really hope so.</v>

1902
01:31:28.951 --> 01:31:33.951
<v Speaker 2>We're starting to see major improvements</v>
<v Speaker 2>in cancer biology with personal genomic </v>

1903
01:31:35.221 --> 01:31:40.221
<v Speaker 2>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My fear with genomic medicine is only </v>

1904
01:31:40.221 --> 01:31:44.390
<v Speaker 2>not to put a dark cloud on it because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that it has like amazing </v>

1905
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:48.860
<v Speaker 2>prospects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My fear is that it's going to further </v>

1906
01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:51.800
<v Speaker 2>increase the kind of class divide where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got people who are sick because </v>

1907
01:31:51.901 --> 01:31:56.901
<v Speaker 2>sickness strikes rich and poor the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for some reason we are a very class </v>

1908
01:31:59.170 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 2>based system</v>

1909
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:05.070
<v Speaker 3>and I think that you're going to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>that rich people get those kinds of </v>

1910
01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:06.970
<v Speaker 3>treatments and poor people don't and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that kind of stuff</v>

1911
01:32:06.970 --> 01:32:08.150
<v Speaker 1>scares me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That worries me.</v>

1912
01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:11.320
<v Speaker 1>It always is with anything emerging </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies.</v>

1913
01:32:11.321 --> 01:32:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Remember in the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wall street phone,</v>

1914
01:32:13.330 --> 01:32:18.330
<v Speaker 1>remember that wall street movie where </v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Douglas epic fucking stupid </v>

1915
01:32:18.330 --> 01:32:18.330
<v Speaker 1>phone and that was like a huge status </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbol.</v>

1916
01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Rappers used to happen videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people couldn't afford a phone.</v>

1917
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Now I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to Brazil all the time for the ufc </v>

1918
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:26.350
<v Speaker 1>and I've gone to these poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods.</v>

1919
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:26.770
<v Speaker 1>You see people on cell phones.</v>

1920
01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:27.500
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see it in,</v>

1921
01:32:27.501 --> 01:32:31.280
<v Speaker 3>in african nations were there aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there isn't enough malaria medication,</v>

1922
01:32:31.281 --> 01:32:33.230
<v Speaker 3>but I mean there's this huge malaria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1923
01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:38.190
<v Speaker 3>push right now to increase awareness and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1924
01:32:38.191 --> 01:32:43.191
<v Speaker 3>you can get mosquito nets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do malaria tests on your family </v>

1925
01:32:43.191 --> 01:32:46.331
<v Speaker 3>and you do it all through your cell </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone because it's very common for </v>

1926
01:32:46.331 --> 01:32:46.880
<v Speaker 3>people to have cell cell service or </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe not service,</v>

1927
01:32:46.881 --> 01:32:51.881
<v Speaker 3>but to have access to a cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the technology is getting </v>

1928
01:32:51.881 --> 01:32:51.881
<v Speaker 3>cheaper and cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yes,</v>

1929
01:32:51.881 --> 01:32:56.561
<v Speaker 3>I do think that time always tells and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that hopefully eventually that kind of </v>

1930
01:32:56.871 --> 01:33:01.871
<v Speaker 3>stuff trickles down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wish it didn't have to trickle </v>

1931
01:33:01.871 --> 01:33:01.871
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish medication.</v>

1932
01:33:01.871 --> 01:33:06.010
<v Speaker 3>I wish health and wellness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're a more egalitarian enterprise that</v>

1933
01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:10.730
<v Speaker 3>one of the biggest problems I think with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the structure of american government and</v>

1934
01:33:10.731 --> 01:33:14.360
<v Speaker 3>being such a capitalist society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'm all about capitalism,</v>

1935
01:33:14.361 --> 01:33:19.361
<v Speaker 3>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we need to be a socialist </v>

1936
01:33:19.361 --> 01:33:19.361
<v Speaker 3>capitalist blend just like we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1937
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:21.860
<v Speaker 3>we have a lot of socialist systems in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our country.</v>

1938
01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:23.630
<v Speaker 3>The male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the socialist educate,</v>

1939
01:33:23.631 --> 01:33:28.631
<v Speaker 3>public education is socialist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a lot of capitalist systems in </v>

1940
01:33:28.631 --> 01:33:31.481
<v Speaker 3>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate that healthcare is a for profit </v>

1941
01:33:31.481 --> 01:33:32.120
<v Speaker 3>system in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes no sense to me.</v>

1942
01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:38.280
<v Speaker 1>The argument is obviously the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>work harder or more ambitious become </v>

1943
01:33:38.441 --> 01:33:40.540
<v Speaker 1>better at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be rewarded for that.</v>

1944
01:33:40.541 --> 01:33:45.541
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's going to motivate them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work harder and be the best heart </v>

1945
01:33:45.541 --> 01:33:45.730
<v Speaker 1>surgeon to be the best brain doctor to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the best.</v>

1946
01:33:46.090 --> 01:33:47.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who fixes.</v>

1947
01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:52.600
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like by the time you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain surgeon and you're licensed brain </v>

1948
01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:53.480
<v Speaker 3>surgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a fucking good brain surgeon like</v>

1949
01:33:53.481 --> 01:33:58.481
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get through a 10 year </v>

1950
01:33:58.481 --> 01:34:00.551
<v Speaker 3>residency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get your surgical degree and then </v>

1951
01:34:00.551 --> 01:34:01.670
<v Speaker 3>you have a 10 year residency before you </v>
<v Speaker 3>become a neurosurgeon.</v>

1952
01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:04.970
<v Speaker 3>You don't get through that and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a sub par neurosurgeon.</v>

1953
01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:10.500
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a fucking incredible </v>

1954
01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:10.500
<v Speaker 3>neurosurgeons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the best of the best,</v>

1955
01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:14.650
<v Speaker 3>the best of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if those people want to do private </v>

1956
01:34:14.650 --> 01:34:14.650
<v Speaker 3>practice on top of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine,</v>

1957
01:34:14.810 --> 01:34:17.390
<v Speaker 3>but we have a practice on top of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>socialized medicine.</v>

1958
01:34:17.890 --> 01:34:19.430
<v Speaker 3>There has to be a national health </v>
<v Speaker 3>service.</v>

1959
01:34:19.670 --> 01:34:21.020
<v Speaker 3>Has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>

1960
01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:22.730
<v Speaker 3>Here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the problem.</v>

1961
01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:24.680
<v Speaker 3>Fundamentally and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very.</v>

1962
01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:29.830
<v Speaker 3>If you can provide me an argument that </v>
<v Speaker 3>solves this problem for a capitalist </v>

1963
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:30.520
<v Speaker 3>healthcare system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'm all about too,</v>

1964
01:34:30.530 --> 01:34:32.330
<v Speaker 3>and I don't mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean anybody listening,</v>

1965
01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:33.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm all about hearing it.</v>

1966
01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:39.280
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that when you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalist system that's a competition </v>

1967
01:34:39.801 --> 01:34:44.801
<v Speaker 3>based system for profit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what ends up happening is that people </v>

1968
01:34:44.801 --> 01:34:46.010
<v Speaker 3>compete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it works,</v>

1969
01:34:46.011 --> 01:34:46.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You compete in,</v>

1970
01:34:46.821 --> 01:34:49.460
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times they say that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>drives prices down,</v>

1971
01:34:49.490 --> 01:34:52.410
<v Speaker 3>is that you compete and prices get </v>
<v Speaker 3>better and then you've,</v>

1972
01:34:52.430 --> 01:34:53.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best part,</v>

1973
01:34:53.210 --> 01:34:54.200
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1974
01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:59.290
<v Speaker 3>but what ends up happening when you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>for profit healthcare is that illness is</v>

1975
01:35:02.091 --> 01:35:04.880
<v Speaker 3>incentivized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wellness is not.</v>

1976
01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:08.690
<v Speaker 3>People make more money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sicker you get,</v>

1977
01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:11.930
<v Speaker 3>people make more money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more procedures you have to get.</v>

1978
01:35:12.170 --> 01:35:17.170
<v Speaker 3>People make more money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the longer you stay in the hospital and </v>

1979
01:35:17.170 --> 01:35:20.741
<v Speaker 3>the minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying there's some grand </v>

1980
01:35:20.741 --> 01:35:22.421
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy to keep people sick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you've got an industry like the </v>

1981
01:35:22.421 --> 01:35:27.341
<v Speaker 3>insurance and pharmaceutical and for </v>
<v Speaker 3>profit hospital industry where the </v>

1982
01:35:28.161 --> 01:35:33.161
<v Speaker 3>profit comes from sickness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where is the incentive to get people?</v>

1983
01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:38.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that doctors aren't very </v>

1984
01:35:38.770 --> 01:35:39.200
<v Speaker 3>noble people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are and they work every day.</v>

1985
01:35:39.201 --> 01:35:40.130
<v Speaker 3>DoctorS,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nurses,</v>

1986
01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:43.370
<v Speaker 3>other healthcare officials to get people</v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

1987
01:35:43.490 --> 01:35:48.490
<v Speaker 3>But the system in itself does not </v>
<v Speaker 3>incentivize wellness.</v>

1988
01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:53.150
<v Speaker 3>It incentivizes sickness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at that very basic level,</v>

1989
01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:58.540
<v Speaker 3>it's a bit broken because somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>along that chain people are gonna take </v>

1990
01:35:58.540 --> 01:35:59.270
<v Speaker 3>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to say,</v>

1991
01:35:59.450 --> 01:36:04.450
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I make more money if this guy has to </v>

1992
01:36:04.450 --> 01:36:08.081
<v Speaker 3>stay in the hospital an extra day or I </v>
<v Speaker 3>make more money if this guy has to get </v>

1993
01:36:08.081 --> 01:36:10.610
<v Speaker 3>this quote unquote unnecessary procedure</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the way across the board.</v>

1994
01:36:10.850 --> 01:36:15.850
<v Speaker 3>The sicker you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more money goes into the system and </v>

1995
01:36:15.850 --> 01:36:16.580
<v Speaker 3>that's really gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gross.</v>

1996
01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:21.290
<v Speaker 3>There are certain things that capitalism</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't work on and I think that wellness,</v>

1997
01:36:21.291 --> 01:36:24.260
<v Speaker 3>which is a basic human right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is one of those things.</v>

1998
01:36:24.290 --> 01:36:29.290
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fundamentally incompatible with </v>

1999
01:36:29.290 --> 01:36:31.841
<v Speaker 3>that type of monetary system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but isn't that just taking into account </v>

2000
01:36:31.841 --> 01:36:36.311
<v Speaker 3>only people that do the wrong thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people who do the right thing,</v>

2001
01:36:36.710 --> 01:36:41.710
<v Speaker 3>who motivate themselves to become the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best orthopedic surgeon and treat the </v>

2002
01:36:41.710 --> 01:36:45.140
<v Speaker 3>lakers and fix all their knee issues and</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people rise to the occasion,</v>

2003
01:36:45.141 --> 01:36:47.150
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't they be rewarded totally.</v>

2004
01:36:47.150 --> 01:36:49.130
<v Speaker 3>And the turd in the pool is not the </v>
<v Speaker 3>surgeon.</v>

2005
01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.810
<v Speaker 3>Trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the insurance company.</v>

2006
01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:53.270
<v Speaker 3>It's the pharmaceutical company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this.</v>

2007
01:36:53.271 --> 01:36:58.271
<v Speaker 3>Occasionally the surgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who was my friend rob </v>

2008
01:36:58.271 --> 01:37:00.160
<v Speaker 3>when he was young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>worked at a resort and he.</v>

2009
01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:05.260
<v Speaker 3>He clearly remembers these doctors </v>
<v Speaker 3>bragging about how they talked to some </v>

2010
01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:08.570
<v Speaker 3>guy into getting a surgery and because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of these buying a porsche.</v>

2011
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:09.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2012
01:37:09.291 --> 01:37:09.920
<v Speaker 3>there is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2013
01:37:09.921 --> 01:37:10.630
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2014
01:37:10.631 --> 01:37:15.631
<v Speaker 3>so the fact that it even trickles down </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the people who took a hippocratic </v>

2015
01:37:15.631 --> 01:37:19.511
<v Speaker 3>oath to the people who we think of as </v>
<v Speaker 3>being the most noble of the most noble </v>

2016
01:37:19.511 --> 01:37:22.310
<v Speaker 3>of citizens in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it even trickles down to them,</v>

2017
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:27.910
<v Speaker 3>how is it going to affect somebody who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing paper at the insurance company </v>

2018
01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:28.370
<v Speaker 3>where you're just a number on a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 3>paper,</v>

2019
01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:33.400
<v Speaker 3>you're just a statistic and you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom line is the answer to cut out </v>

2020
01:37:34.610 --> 01:37:37.050
<v Speaker 3>that aspect of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the insurance company is the,</v>

2021
01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:42.051
<v Speaker 3>the the issue and that really socialized</v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine would be compensating the </v>

2022
01:37:42.051 --> 01:37:45.590
<v Speaker 3>doctors and the doctors would still be </v>
<v Speaker 3>potentially able to rise.</v>

2023
01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:51.620
<v Speaker 3>That would be my answer is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think as any other industrialized </v>

2024
01:37:52.251 --> 01:37:57.251
<v Speaker 3>western nation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're the only industrialized western </v>

2025
01:37:57.251 --> 01:37:57.251
<v Speaker 3>nation that doesn't have national </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthcare,</v>

2026
01:37:57.251 --> 01:37:59.190
<v Speaker 3>so what ends up happening is you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>public option.</v>

2027
01:37:59.430 --> 01:38:04.430
<v Speaker 3>You have the option to have a healthcare</v>
<v Speaker 3>system that is free and available to you</v>

2028
01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:12.080
<v Speaker 3>and it has basic levels of treatment and</v>
<v Speaker 3>care for anything that could go wrong </v>

2029
01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:13.380
<v Speaker 3>with you and their doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see in their hospitals.</v>

2030
01:38:13.381 --> 01:38:18.180
<v Speaker 3>You can go to if you want to go private.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same way that we have education</v>

2031
01:38:18.181 --> 01:38:21.390
<v Speaker 3>in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had an amazing public education.</v>

2032
01:38:21.810 --> 01:38:23.730
<v Speaker 3>I have friends who went to private </v>
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>

2033
01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:25.800
<v Speaker 3>Their parents wanted them to go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>private school.</v>

2034
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:30.830
<v Speaker 3>Good for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They may have had a better education </v>

2035
01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:33.651
<v Speaker 3>than me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They may not have because there were </v>

2036
01:38:33.651 --> 01:38:35.841
<v Speaker 3>still amazing teachers available and an </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible infrastructure in place for </v>

2037
01:38:35.841 --> 01:38:39.651
<v Speaker 3>me to get an incredible education as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>student in the right spot or you can be </v>

2038
01:38:39.651 --> 01:38:44.061
<v Speaker 3>in the la unified school system and have</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking horrible education that that is </v>

2039
01:38:44.061 --> 01:38:47.730
<v Speaker 3>a problem with gentrification and with </v>
<v Speaker 3>segregation and with again,</v>

2040
01:38:47.731 --> 01:38:51.270
<v Speaker 3>I think some of the problems of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalist society.</v>

2041
01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:55.900
<v Speaker 3>While it's certainly a problem in how we</v>
<v Speaker 3>view and what you know,</v>

2042
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:58.860
<v Speaker 3>what we think about in terms of where </v>
<v Speaker 3>our money should go.</v>

2043
01:38:58.861 --> 01:39:03.861
<v Speaker 3>LIke if we had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had privatized police force and </v>

2044
01:39:03.861 --> 01:39:05.040
<v Speaker 3>privatized fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like every time your house was on fire,</v>

2045
01:39:05.041 --> 01:39:10.041
<v Speaker 3>you had to pay someone to come in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fix the issue and put the fire out.</v>

2046
01:39:10.510 --> 01:39:11.700
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my god,</v>

2047
01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:13.760
<v Speaker 3>it's happened before it's happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2048
01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:18.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can find stories online of people </v>

2049
01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:21.801
<v Speaker 3>living in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in regions where they have like a </v>

2050
01:39:21.801 --> 01:39:21.801
<v Speaker 3>privatized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2051
01:39:21.801 --> 01:39:21.920
<v Speaker 3>fire service,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's a,</v>

2052
01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:25.590
<v Speaker 3>a four pay fire service and like </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's houses have burned down because</v>

2053
01:39:25.591 --> 01:39:28.080
<v Speaker 3>they can't afford to put it out a weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>

2054
01:39:28.081 --> 01:39:29.820
<v Speaker 3>Like some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some rural area.</v>

2055
01:39:29.821 --> 01:39:31.830
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And imagine what that was an urban issue</v>

2056
01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.380
<v Speaker 3>with healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean healthcare.</v>

2057
01:39:34.381 --> 01:39:39.381
<v Speaker 3>You can be in the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most populated city in the world and </v>

2058
01:39:39.381 --> 01:39:39.381
<v Speaker 3>there's poor people that don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthcare.</v>

2059
01:39:39.381 --> 01:39:43.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that if society is going to </v>

2060
01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:45.981
<v Speaker 3>offer basic services,</v>
<v Speaker 3>police force and fire for fire </v>

2061
01:39:46.051 --> 01:39:48.690
<v Speaker 3>departments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine has got to be wanting to be one</v>

2062
01:39:48.691 --> 01:39:53.691
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is when you put the money </v>

2063
01:39:53.691 --> 01:39:56.541
<v Speaker 3>into preventive care that's necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you end up saving so much money on the </v>

2064
01:39:56.971 --> 01:40:01.971
<v Speaker 3>back end when people who can't afford to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to the doctor until they have a </v>

2065
01:40:01.971 --> 01:40:06.861
<v Speaker 3>festering wound or until they've allowed</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cancer to spread or whatever are </v>

2066
01:40:06.861 --> 01:40:11.691
<v Speaker 3>going to the doctor early on and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting a checkup because they can </v>

2067
01:40:11.691 --> 01:40:14.220
<v Speaker 3>afford it because it's free to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you've got somebody who's living on</v>

2068
01:40:14.221 --> 01:40:18.570
<v Speaker 3>the street who obviously going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>subject to much more infection,</v>

2069
01:40:18.571 --> 01:40:21.600
<v Speaker 3>much more disease because they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're living in squalor.</v>

2070
01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:25.320
<v Speaker 3>If they can go to the doctor on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>regular basis and get a checkup,</v>

2071
01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:30.560
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to be then going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the doctor later to get some multi </v>

2072
01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:30.780
<v Speaker 3>thousand dollar procedure.</v>

2073
01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:33.720
<v Speaker 3>That hippocratic oath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to do this.</v>

2074
01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:37.080
<v Speaker 3>If somebody goes into and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking arm is hanging off,</v>

2075
01:40:37.150 --> 01:40:39.060
<v Speaker 3>no doctor is going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't reattach your arm.</v>

2076
01:40:39.061 --> 01:40:40.770
<v Speaker 3>You're just going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to do it.</v>

2077
01:40:40.771 --> 01:40:45.771
<v Speaker 3>They're going to build these people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're never gonna fucking pay their </v>

2078
01:40:45.771 --> 01:40:47.751
<v Speaker 3>bills because they can't afford to and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you and I are going to absorb that </v>

2079
01:40:47.751 --> 01:40:51.801
<v Speaker 3>cost in our.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the money that we're paying for our </v>

2080
01:40:51.801 --> 01:40:51.801
<v Speaker 3>insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go back when you're talking about people</v>

2081
01:40:51.801 --> 01:40:56.481
<v Speaker 3>living in squalor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That goes back to the mental illness </v>

2082
01:40:56.481 --> 01:40:56.481
<v Speaker 3>issue as well because</v>

2083
01:40:56.481 --> 01:40:59.200
<v Speaker 2>he definitely massive percent of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are wandering around </v>

2084
01:40:59.200 --> 01:40:59.500
<v Speaker 2>homeless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're such an important point to make,</v>

2085
01:40:59.530 --> 01:41:00.340
<v Speaker 2>but that was the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

2086
01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:02.740
<v Speaker 2>Ronald reagan administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they changed the standards.</v>

2087
01:41:02.741 --> 01:41:04.450
<v Speaker 2>They let loose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember it,</v>

2088
01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:08.860
<v Speaker 2>I was a kid and I remember being in New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York and seeing all these fucking people</v>

2089
01:41:08.861 --> 01:41:13.861
<v Speaker 2>wandering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came to New York for a martial arts </v>

2090
01:41:13.861 --> 01:41:17.011
<v Speaker 2>tournament during the reagan </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration and I remember like </v>

2091
01:41:17.011 --> 01:41:20.610
<v Speaker 2>people were talking and I was young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a teenager and these adults were </v>

2092
01:41:20.610 --> 01:41:23.890
<v Speaker 2>talking about these that all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 2>they changed the mental health standards</v>

2093
01:41:23.891 --> 01:41:26.560
<v Speaker 2>and they were releasing all these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

2094
01:41:26.561 --> 01:41:28.600
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>LIke they're just releasing them.</v>

2095
01:41:28.601 --> 01:41:30.930
<v Speaker 2>They were taking these people that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>in mental institutions.</v>

2096
01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:35.960
<v Speaker 2>They changed the standards of what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>needed to to keep these people in these </v>

2097
01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:38.310
<v Speaker 2>facilities and they were just released </v>
<v Speaker 2>them on the streets and influx.</v>

2098
01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:43.350
<v Speaker 2>There were two massive releases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was one in the fifties when held </v>

2099
01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:44.470
<v Speaker 2>all first came on the market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an anti psychotic,</v>

2100
01:41:44.471 --> 01:41:47.740
<v Speaker 2>which was a major improvement and </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric care.</v>

2101
01:41:47.741 --> 01:41:50.350
<v Speaker 2>So all of a sudden you had people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>were schizophrenic,</v>

2102
01:41:50.351 --> 01:41:53.470
<v Speaker 2>who had delusional kind of disorders and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can treat them.</v>

2103
01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:57.070
<v Speaker 2>And so these people who were like </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically just being fed and watered and</v>

2104
01:41:57.071 --> 01:42:01.000
<v Speaker 2>asylums were given how doll and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>could lead functional lives again.</v>

2105
01:42:01.001 --> 01:42:06.001
<v Speaker 2>So there you saw a big change in the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that mental health services happened.</v>

2106
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:11.550
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you no longer had the asylum population </v>

2107
01:42:11.550 --> 01:42:12.100
<v Speaker 2>and then you started having more of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of like a mental health facility.</v>

2108
01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:14.940
<v Speaker 2>And then again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the reagan administration used,</v>

2109
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.740
<v Speaker 2>you saw a big release.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem there was,</v>

2110
01:42:17.950 --> 01:42:19.780
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really a name only.</v>

2111
01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:21.460
<v Speaker 2>They weren't getting any better </v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment.</v>

2112
01:42:21.490 --> 01:42:23.860
<v Speaker 2>They were just put out on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>change the standard.</v>

2113
01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:28.860
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you've got these people that are </v>

2114
01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:28.860
<v Speaker 2>put out on the street and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's again,</v>

2115
01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:30.760
<v Speaker 2>that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get me wrong,</v>

2116
01:42:31.450 --> 01:42:32.530
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2117
01:42:32.531 --> 01:42:33.880
<v Speaker 2>look at me like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

2118
01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:38.881
<v Speaker 2>I moved out when I was fucking 16.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I busted my ass my whole life to like </v>

2119
01:42:38.881 --> 01:42:39.080
<v Speaker 2>work really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a good education.</v>

2120
01:42:39.081 --> 01:42:40.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2121
01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:43.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even coming to la with bill,</v>

2122
01:42:43.151 --> 01:42:46.090
<v Speaker 2>he opened a bunch of doors for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking walk through those doors.</v>

2123
01:42:46.091 --> 01:42:49.960
<v Speaker 2>I made sure that I was as responsible as</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

2124
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:53.110
<v Speaker 2>I am all about fiscal and personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

2125
01:42:53.111 --> 01:42:55.930
<v Speaker 2>I have amazing credit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no debt.</v>

2126
01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also know that as a nation we're </v>

2127
01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:04.801
<v Speaker 2>only as strong as the weakest amongst us</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are certain people to whom </v>

2128
01:43:04.801 --> 01:43:07.510
<v Speaker 2>those types of standards just can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>apply because they're,</v>

2129
01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:10.660
<v Speaker 2>they're ill will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a spectrum issue,</v>

2130
01:43:10.661 --> 01:43:11.020
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

2131
01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:12.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many variables that when,</v>

2132
01:43:12.921 --> 01:43:17.921
<v Speaker 2>when people like to look at these issues</v>
<v Speaker 2>and look at them in a black and white </v>

2133
01:43:17.921 --> 01:43:17.921
<v Speaker 2>term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a liberal.</v>

2134
01:43:17.921 --> 01:43:18.100
<v Speaker 2>So I think this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a conservative.</v>

2135
01:43:18.101 --> 01:43:20.380
<v Speaker 2>So I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really,</v>

2136
01:43:20.590 --> 01:43:25.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of ideas that are very </v>

2137
01:43:25.590 --> 01:43:25.590
<v Speaker 2>liberal and a lot of ideas that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>fairly conservative too.</v>

2138
01:43:25.590 --> 01:43:30.310
<v Speaker 2>There's a real issues with picking aside</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

2139
01:43:30.311 --> 01:43:34.780
<v Speaker 2>especially when it comes to ideologies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just such a lazy way to think.</v>

2140
01:43:35.230 --> 01:43:40.230
<v Speaker 2>You're not thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're letting somebody else think for </v>

2141
01:43:40.230 --> 01:43:41.941
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get a lot of hate when I come on your </v>

2142
01:43:41.941 --> 01:43:41.941
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also when I go on the young turks,</v>

2143
01:43:41.941 --> 01:43:45.811
<v Speaker 2>anytime I talk about gm foods or </v>
<v Speaker 2>genetically modified crops in any way </v>

2144
01:43:45.811 --> 01:43:48.370
<v Speaker 2>and because what ends up happening is </v>
<v Speaker 2>people look at me and they go,</v>

2145
01:43:48.371 --> 01:43:50.020
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a liberal shill.</v>

2146
01:43:50.050 --> 01:43:50.950
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a shell.</v>

2147
01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:52.190
<v Speaker 2>They look at me and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2148
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:53.720
<v Speaker 3>you're a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a progressive,</v>

2149
01:43:53.721 --> 01:43:58.721
<v Speaker 3>you're left wing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you have this super conservative </v>

2150
01:43:58.721 --> 01:44:02.651
<v Speaker 3>ideology when it comes to gm foods?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you say that you thInk that's </v>

2151
01:44:02.651 --> 01:44:05.080
<v Speaker 3>a good thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You must be pro big agribusiness.</v>

2152
01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:10.090
<v Speaker 3>You must be pro monsanto and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't inform my politics based</v>

2153
01:44:10.581 --> 01:44:15.581
<v Speaker 3>on what a party tells me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my politics are informed based on the </v>

2154
01:44:15.581 --> 01:44:19.001
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I studied the science behind genetic </v>

2155
01:44:19.001 --> 01:44:21.671
<v Speaker 3>modification and I come to a personal </v>
<v Speaker 3>conclusion that genetic modification in </v>

2156
01:44:21.671 --> 01:44:25.760
<v Speaker 3>and of itself is not only not dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but can also be a huge boon.</v>

2157
01:44:25.761 --> 01:44:30.620
<v Speaker 3>It can be really helpful for health and </v>
<v Speaker 3>human safety across,</v>

2158
01:44:30.621 --> 01:44:35.621
<v Speaker 3>especially in lower income and </v>
<v Speaker 3>globalized areas where they're not very </v>

2159
01:44:35.621 --> 01:44:40.121
<v Speaker 3>industrialized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second problem is that people have a </v>

2160
01:44:40.121 --> 01:44:41.900
<v Speaker 3>really hard time with the concept of sin</v>
<v Speaker 3>touchy.</v>

2161
01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:42.980
<v Speaker 3>This idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2162
01:44:42.981 --> 01:44:47.981
<v Speaker 3>that's a literary term for looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the part for the whole or the whole for </v>

2163
01:44:47.981 --> 01:44:47.981
<v Speaker 3>the part.</v>

2164
01:44:47.981 --> 01:44:50.060
<v Speaker 3>So people say gm food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>monsanto,</v>

2165
01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:52.100
<v Speaker 3>monsanto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing.</v>

2166
01:44:52.101 --> 01:44:57.101
<v Speaker 3>It's not the fucking same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a company that utilizes gm </v>

2167
01:44:57.101 --> 01:45:00.461
<v Speaker 3>technology and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>recently I got offered a branded </v>

2168
01:45:00.461 --> 01:45:03.881
<v Speaker 3>entertainment job with monsanto and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>had to turn it down and the reason I </v>

2169
01:45:03.881 --> 01:45:07.331
<v Speaker 3>turned it down was not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I really disagree with the </v>

2170
01:45:07.331 --> 01:45:08.690
<v Speaker 3>practices even though I do fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree with their practices.</v>

2171
01:45:08.691 --> 01:45:13.691
<v Speaker 3>Like let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of monsanto things that </v>

2172
01:45:13.691 --> 01:45:15.371
<v Speaker 3>make me mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Social practices are but in the </v>

2173
01:45:15.371 --> 01:45:15.371
<v Speaker 3>capitalist kind of prep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

2174
01:45:15.371 --> 01:45:20.080
<v Speaker 3>But the reason I had to turn down this </v>
<v Speaker 3>brand to deal is because I knew that if </v>

2175
01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:21.650
<v Speaker 3>I ever took a dime from a company like </v>
<v Speaker 3>monsanto,</v>

2176
01:45:21.651 --> 01:45:26.651
<v Speaker 3>my ability as a journalist to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 3>gm crops from a very neutral perspective</v>

2177
01:45:28.190 --> 01:45:33.190
<v Speaker 3>would be out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody would ever take me seriously </v>

2178
01:45:33.190 --> 01:45:33.190
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

2179
01:45:33.190 --> 01:45:36.730
<v Speaker 3>So it's the same thing with big pharma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People go like a big pharma's evil,</v>

2180
01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:42.640
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what should you never take drugs </v>

2181
01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:42.640
<v Speaker 3>again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you out of your fucking mind?</v>

2182
01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:46.840
<v Speaker 3>It's like you've got to be able to look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at these things in a nuanced way and </v>

2183
01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:48.770
<v Speaker 3>understand that there are problems and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are evils,</v>

2184
01:45:48.890 --> 01:45:51.410
<v Speaker 3>but you can't throw the baby out with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bathwater and you can't say,</v>

2185
01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:56.440
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all modern medicine is terrible because </v>

2186
01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:57.530
<v Speaker 3>pfizer is making money on the backs of </v>
<v Speaker 3>poor people.</v>

2187
01:45:57.531 --> 01:45:58.010
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeaH,</v>

2188
01:45:58.011 --> 01:46:01.430
<v Speaker 3>that's fucked up about pfizer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean modern medicine is</v>

2189
01:46:01.431 --> 01:46:06.431
<v Speaker 3>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are two totally different </v>

2190
01:46:06.431 --> 01:46:06.431
<v Speaker 3>conversations.</v>

2191
01:46:06.431 --> 01:46:09.540
<v Speaker 1>AlSo people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they start talking about </v>

2192
01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:09.540
<v Speaker 1>genetically modified foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that they have to take</v>

2193
01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:13.981
<v Speaker 1>into consideration is that almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you eat is genetically </v>

2194
01:46:13.981 --> 01:46:13.981
<v Speaker 1>modified and you go to the grocery </v>
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

2195
01:46:13.981 --> 01:46:16.090
<v Speaker 1>If you're getting corn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're getting apples,</v>

2196
01:46:16.091 --> 01:46:21.091
<v Speaker 1>if you're getting tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop thinking that this just because </v>

2197
01:46:21.091 --> 01:46:21.940
<v Speaker 1>it's organic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's not genetically modified.</v>

2198
01:46:21.941 --> 01:46:25.930
<v Speaker 1>The corn that you eat today has no </v>
<v Speaker 1>resemblance to the original corn.</v>

2199
01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:27.390
<v Speaker 3>None Whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they'll say,</v>

2200
01:46:27.391 --> 01:46:29.070
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it might not be transgenic.</v>

2201
01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:34.100
<v Speaker 3>It likely is transgenic too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's another thing like genetic </v>

2202
01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:34.980
<v Speaker 3>modification is a really big umbrella </v>
<v Speaker 3>term.</v>

2203
01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:40.280
<v Speaker 3>It could be selective breeding is </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetic modification with a lot of </v>

2204
01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:43.320
<v Speaker 3>people have a hard time with the concept</v>
<v Speaker 3>of transgenic foods and I say to them,</v>

2205
01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:45.630
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't want to eat transgenic,</v>

2206
01:46:45.631 --> 01:46:47.480
<v Speaker 3>food's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Define transgender.</v>

2207
01:46:47.490 --> 01:46:52.320
<v Speaker 3>So transgenic foods would be a scientist</v>
<v Speaker 3>going into the genome of an organism.</v>

2208
01:46:52.321 --> 01:46:55.590
<v Speaker 3>Let's say it's a type of corn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go into the genome and they go,</v>

2209
01:46:55.591 --> 01:46:58.740
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this corn tends to die readily.</v>

2210
01:46:58.741 --> 01:47:02.520
<v Speaker 3>When the temperature gets above 101,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the climate is changing.</v>

2211
01:47:02.521 --> 01:47:04.170
<v Speaker 3>It's getting hotter and hotter Where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they farm it,</v>

2212
01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:09.380
<v Speaker 3>so we're going to tinker with the genome</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're going to delete a gene or </v>

2213
01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:12.861
<v Speaker 3>insert a gene or move the genes around </v>
<v Speaker 3>in some way so that this corn is now </v>

2214
01:47:13.201 --> 01:47:14.310
<v Speaker 3>drought resistant.</v>

2215
01:47:14.610 --> 01:47:17.100
<v Speaker 3>Change the genome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>produce a new corn crop,</v>

2216
01:47:17.130 --> 01:47:22.130
<v Speaker 3>and then continue to breed that corn </v>
<v Speaker 3>crop and that is really the goal and </v>

2217
01:47:22.130 --> 01:47:24.360
<v Speaker 3>generally the motivation behind gm </v>
<v Speaker 3>crops.</v>

2218
01:47:24.361 --> 01:47:27.570
<v Speaker 3>It's to make them withstand things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>droughts or pests or whatever,</v>

2219
01:47:27.571 --> 01:47:31.170
<v Speaker 3>so that they can live heartier and feed </v>
<v Speaker 3>more people in that way.</v>

2220
01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:36.380
<v Speaker 3>Now sometimes you have a company like </v>
<v Speaker 3>monsanto doing their own research where </v>

2221
01:47:36.380 --> 01:47:40.551
<v Speaker 3>they want to make a crop that can only </v>
<v Speaker 3>live for one generation and then die so </v>

2222
01:47:40.551 --> 01:47:41.340
<v Speaker 3>that farmers have to keep buying their </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeds,</v>

2223
01:47:41.341 --> 01:47:43.260
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they make a roundup ready crops.</v>

2224
01:47:43.261 --> 01:47:45.360
<v Speaker 3>I want to crop so that I can spray the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole thing down.</v>

2225
01:47:45.361 --> 01:47:46.950
<v Speaker 3>With roundup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the crop survives,</v>

2226
01:47:46.951 --> 01:47:49.890
<v Speaker 3>but all of the weeds around it die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an easier way to farm,</v>

2227
01:47:49.891 --> 01:47:52.710
<v Speaker 3>but it could have some really </v>
<v Speaker 3>detrimental ecological effects,</v>

2228
01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:58.220
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why a lot of scientists get </v>

2229
01:47:58.220 --> 01:48:00.750
<v Speaker 3>pissed off about all the gm hysteria </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're like,</v>

2230
01:48:00.751 --> 01:48:05.751
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I were to take this random corn crop </v>

2231
01:48:05.751 --> 01:48:05.850
<v Speaker 3>and that random corn crop and breed </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

2232
01:48:05.851 --> 01:48:08.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm shuffling like 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>genes.</v>

2233
01:48:08.670 --> 01:48:13.670
<v Speaker 3>If I were to go in targeted and changed </v>
<v Speaker 3>three genes that only affect the ability</v>

2234
01:48:15.301 --> 01:48:17.700
<v Speaker 3>for it to withstand a higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>temperature.</v>

2235
01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:21.630
<v Speaker 3>It's a much more specific and targeted </v>
<v Speaker 3>way to change this plant.</v>

2236
01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:24.540
<v Speaker 3>I trust it more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know exactly what I'm eating,</v>

2237
01:48:24.810 --> 01:48:25.590
<v Speaker 3>but people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2238
01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:27.480
<v Speaker 3>it's horrifying because they're going in</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

2239
01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:30.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pipetters and tools.</v>

2240
01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:35.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because of things like roundup </v>

2241
01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:37.641
<v Speaker 3>because of companies that do mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a reason why people are </v>

2242
01:48:37.641 --> 01:48:37.770
<v Speaker 3>suspicious is reason why people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>cautious,</v>

2243
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.400
<v Speaker 3>they are worried about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's been also some.</v>

2244
01:48:41.630 --> 01:48:43.650
<v Speaker 3>There's been some fuckery involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>these studies too.</v>

2245
01:48:43.651 --> 01:48:47.240
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a study about rats where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they showed the grow,</v>

2246
01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:52.280
<v Speaker 3>grew all these tumors in rats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They use more susceptible to tumors in </v>

2247
01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:53.520
<v Speaker 3>the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

2248
01:48:53.521 --> 01:48:54.060
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2249
01:48:54.570 --> 01:48:54.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2250
01:48:54.991 --> 01:48:59.991
<v Speaker 3>as somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a person who has never studied lab </v>

2251
01:48:59.991 --> 01:49:04.011
<v Speaker 3>science to try and make sense of all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit in the media and,</v>

2252
01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:09.920
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to be reading articles that were </v>

2253
01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:09.920
<v Speaker 3>written by journalists who have never </v>
<v Speaker 3>studied lab on,</v>

2254
01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:12.660
<v Speaker 3>how are you expected to keep things </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight?</v>

2255
01:49:12.930 --> 01:49:16.830
<v Speaker 3>That's why I do what I do for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a science communicator and my job is</v>

2256
01:49:16.831 --> 01:49:21.450
<v Speaker 3>to look at research that exists and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>try and translate that to the public.</v>

2257
01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:24.510
<v Speaker 3>But I also want to try and understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>where the public is coming from.</v>

2258
01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:27.780
<v Speaker 3>Why are you afraid of this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does this thing worry you?</v>

2259
01:49:27.781 --> 01:49:30.450
<v Speaker 3>Let's understand the psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons behind it.</v>

2260
01:49:30.451 --> 01:49:35.451
<v Speaker 3>LeT's understand what you've been fed </v>
<v Speaker 3>your hold lives by the media and see </v>

2261
01:49:35.451 --> 01:49:38.400
<v Speaker 3>what's reasonable and what's not and </v>
<v Speaker 3>come to a rational conclusion about it.</v>

2262
01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:43.430
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we as a species respond better in some </v>

2263
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 3>ways to fear and hysteria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We we see on the news that's like,</v>

2264
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:49.240
<v Speaker 3>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing could kill you,</v>

2265
01:49:49.241 --> 01:49:49.930
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>

2266
01:49:49.931 --> 01:49:51.400
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to know about this.</v>

2267
01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:54.430
<v Speaker 3>Because if the media was always </v>
<v Speaker 3>presenting things rationally like,</v>

2268
01:49:54.431 --> 01:49:56.800
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's take a balanced approach to this.</v>

2269
01:49:56.801 --> 01:50:00.040
<v Speaker 3>Let's look at the pros and the cons and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people would tune out.</v>

2270
01:50:00.041 --> 01:50:05.041
<v Speaker 3>It's not that interesting anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The things that we find salient are the </v>

2271
01:50:05.041 --> 01:50:08.821
<v Speaker 3>things that raise the hairs on the backs</v>
<v Speaker 3>of our necks and what that ends up </v>

2272
01:50:08.821 --> 01:50:10.300
<v Speaker 3>breeding is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2273
01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:15.360
<v Speaker 3>is just a media landscape of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fearmongering and screaming matches and </v>

2274
01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:21.120
<v Speaker 3>worst case scenario conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I don't think is very helpful for </v>

2275
01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:21.120
<v Speaker 3>anybody.</v>

2276
01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:25.800
<v Speaker 1>It's also the reality of the absorption </v>
<v Speaker 1>of information that people's ability to </v>

2277
01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:25.800
<v Speaker 1>take in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

2278
01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:27.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much time do you have in a day?</v>

2279
01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:30.610
<v Speaker 1>People work eight plus hours a day plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>commuting plus family,</v>

2280
01:50:30.611 --> 01:50:34.120
<v Speaker 1>plus you have to be an expert about </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they do for a living.</v>

2281
01:50:34.121 --> 01:50:36.040
<v Speaker 1>I doN't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contradicting information.</v>

2282
01:50:36.041 --> 01:50:41.041
<v Speaker 1>You could always go online and find a </v>
<v Speaker 1>host of websites that will tell you </v>

2283
01:50:41.041 --> 01:50:45.631
<v Speaker 1>about the evils of genetically modified </v>
<v Speaker 1>foods and if and if you absorb that </v>

2284
01:50:45.631 --> 01:50:46.930
<v Speaker 1>information and you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what you preach,</v>

2285
01:50:46.931 --> 01:50:47.950
<v Speaker 1>that's your mantra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

2286
01:50:48.130 --> 01:50:53.130
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to be open minded </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then sort of accept other ideas and </v>

2287
01:50:53.130 --> 01:50:56.900
<v Speaker 1>try that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contradict those original ideas that </v>

2288
01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:56.900
<v Speaker 1>you've been telling everybody about</v>

2289
01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:56.900
<v Speaker 3>and in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The truth is it's,</v>

2290
01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:58.400
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to figure out who to trust,</v>

2291
01:50:58.401 --> 01:51:02.600
<v Speaker 3>especially in a landscape like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I never promote.</v>

2292
01:51:02.601 --> 01:51:07.601
<v Speaker 3>I have no intention as a science </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicator that the work that I do is </v>

2293
01:51:08.331 --> 01:51:13.331
<v Speaker 3>going to necessarily promote a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to go off and become scientists </v>

2294
01:51:13.761 --> 01:51:15.110
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean hopefully young,</v>

2295
01:51:15.170 --> 01:51:17.270
<v Speaker 3>young children or some Teens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are in that,</v>

2296
01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:19.940
<v Speaker 3>in that age group and who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested.</v>

2297
01:51:19.941 --> 01:51:22.910
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there'll be influenced a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit about some of the work that I do,</v>

2298
01:51:22.911 --> 01:51:27.911
<v Speaker 3>but more more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see a higher level of </v>

2299
01:51:27.911 --> 01:51:32.171
<v Speaker 3>scientific literacy in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that means is that we think more </v>

2300
01:51:33.681 --> 01:51:37.700
<v Speaker 3>with our brains and less with our </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotions and less with our,</v>

2301
01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:39.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that stephen colbert truthiness,</v>

2302
01:51:39.621 --> 01:51:44.621
<v Speaker 3>like we got to get away from truthiness </v>
<v Speaker 3>just because something feels right </v>

2303
01:51:44.621 --> 01:51:45.320
<v Speaker 3>doesn't necessarily mean that it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2304
01:51:45.620 --> 01:51:48.530
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop for a minute,</v>

2305
01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:51.560
<v Speaker 3>listen to the argument that's being </v>
<v Speaker 3>made.</v>

2306
01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:56.860
<v Speaker 3>Who is making the argument?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they have any financial reason to be </v>

2307
01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:59.951
<v Speaker 3>making the argument?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did they have any political reason to </v>

2308
01:51:59.951 --> 01:52:02.591
<v Speaker 3>meet making the argument is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this article about gmos being evil on</v>

2309
01:52:02.631 --> 01:52:03.710
<v Speaker 3>a website called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>

2310
01:52:03.711 --> 01:52:06.650
<v Speaker 3>gmos are evil.com</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>

2311
01:52:08.510 --> 01:52:11.120
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the thing.</v>

2312
01:52:11.121 --> 01:52:11.650
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2313
01:52:11.660 --> 01:52:16.660
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think this also goes back to this </v>

2314
01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:16.670
<v Speaker 3>conversation I had about throwing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>baby out with the bathwater.</v>

2315
01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:22.420
<v Speaker 3>The mainstream media has its problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but journalism is an enterprise has a </v>

2316
01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:27.101
<v Speaker 3>lot of nobility to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pharmaceutical company has major </v>

2317
01:52:27.101 --> 01:52:29.210
<v Speaker 3>problems and it's very broken the </v>
<v Speaker 3>insurance company too,</v>

2318
01:52:29.420 --> 01:52:33.530
<v Speaker 3>but medicine has so much worth to it </v>
<v Speaker 3>especially,</v>

2319
01:52:33.590 --> 01:52:37.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence based by biomedical advances.</v>

2320
01:52:37.790 --> 01:52:41.810
<v Speaker 3>Psychiatric medicine has a lot of know </v>
<v Speaker 3>pluses.</v>

2321
01:52:42.140 --> 01:52:45.710
<v Speaker 3>The process of genetic modification is </v>
<v Speaker 3>so important,</v>

2322
01:52:45.711 --> 01:52:47.540
<v Speaker 3>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>monsanto has a lot of problems.</v>

2323
01:52:47.780 --> 01:52:52.780
<v Speaker 3>We've got to be able to think more </v>
<v Speaker 3>nuanced about these things and instead </v>

2324
01:52:52.780 --> 01:52:52.780
<v Speaker 3>of going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2325
01:52:52.780 --> 01:52:55.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust fox news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore I don't trust any media.</v>

2326
01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:58.730
<v Speaker 3>Therefore I only am going to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>site.</v>

2327
01:52:58.731 --> 01:53:00.050
<v Speaker 3>Did that keeps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you said,</v>

2328
01:53:00.051 --> 01:53:03.230
<v Speaker 3>reinforcing what I already believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Omg,</v>

2329
01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:08.260
<v Speaker 3>gmos are horrible.com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only place where I get my </v>

2330
01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:09.380
<v Speaker 3>news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well now you're in an echo chamber.</v>

2331
01:53:10.190 --> 01:53:15.190
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge issue and the other thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you brought up there about </v>

2332
01:53:15.190 --> 01:53:15.980
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about financial,</v>

2333
01:53:15.981 --> 01:53:20.981
<v Speaker 1>all the different motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different things in the </v>

2334
01:53:20.981 --> 01:53:22.811
<v Speaker 1>variables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also stuff that you have to try </v>

2335
01:53:22.811 --> 01:53:24.380
<v Speaker 1>to pay attention to and squeeze into </v>
<v Speaker 1>your head and that's the thing that it's</v>

2336
01:53:24.381 --> 01:53:29.381
<v Speaker 1>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need someone like you to sort of </v>

2337
01:53:29.381 --> 01:53:32.350
<v Speaker 1>break it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone who has a background in this </v>

2338
01:53:32.350 --> 01:53:33.320
<v Speaker 1>particular area to break it down in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that we can understand what go.</v>

2339
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm comfortable.</v>

2340
01:53:34.341 --> 01:53:39.341
<v Speaker 1>The santa maria is being honest with me </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this particular aspect of </v>

2341
01:53:39.341 --> 01:53:40.340
<v Speaker 1>depression and neurochemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He theSe are.</v>

2342
01:53:40.341 --> 01:53:45.341
<v Speaker 1>This is her experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is also what she knows about the </v>

2343
01:53:45.341 --> 01:53:45.341
<v Speaker 1>science behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2344
01:53:45.341 --> 01:53:48.640
<v Speaker 3>I have no motivation otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's paying me to say this and I </v>

2345
01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:48.640
<v Speaker 3>think that this is why we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>

2346
01:53:48.650 --> 01:53:50.630
<v Speaker 3>the listeners of the joe rogan </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>

2347
01:53:50.631 --> 01:53:52.730
<v Speaker 3>the listeners of talk nerdy with carrie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>santa maria,</v>

2348
01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:57.840
<v Speaker 3>the people who are really involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the next movement of alternative and new</v>

2349
01:53:59.901 --> 01:54:04.901
<v Speaker 3>media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is our responsibility to continue to </v>

2350
01:54:04.901 --> 01:54:08.921
<v Speaker 3>support these kinds of programs and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>continue to speak up and become engaged </v>

2351
01:54:09.441 --> 01:54:14.441
<v Speaker 3>and involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if we're not happy with the way </v>

2352
01:54:14.441 --> 01:54:16.421
<v Speaker 3>that traditional media is handling </v>
<v Speaker 3>things because they're playing to the </v>

2353
01:54:16.421 --> 01:54:16.940
<v Speaker 3>ratings and they're playing to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lowest common denominator,</v>

2354
01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:22.240
<v Speaker 3>we can't be passive about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to support the news outlets and </v>

2355
01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:25.460
<v Speaker 3>the organizations and the podcasts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the web shows that that we support.</v>

2356
01:54:25.490 --> 01:54:30.490
<v Speaker 3>We have to do our part to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things don't fail because the </v>

2357
01:54:30.490 --> 01:54:33.740
<v Speaker 3>unfortunate thing is we don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>backers that they have.</v>

2358
01:54:33.770 --> 01:54:37.160
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a squarespace on my side.</v>

2359
01:54:37.161 --> 01:54:39.200
<v Speaker 3>I have computer learning zone on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>

2360
01:54:39.410 --> 01:54:41.420
<v Speaker 3>You have these wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2361
01:54:41.710 --> 01:54:46.710
<v Speaker 3>sponsors on your side that help you keep</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing this so that you can offer it for </v>

2362
01:54:46.710 --> 01:54:49.700
<v Speaker 3>free to your listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're not being backed by pfizer,</v>

2363
01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:54.820
<v Speaker 3>but we don't have four months and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have to meet with these other </v>

2364
01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:57.371
<v Speaker 3>companies would find value in it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they know that we're going to say some </v>

2365
01:54:57.371 --> 01:55:00.551
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the only reason they're going to </v>

2366
01:55:00.551 --> 01:55:02.441
<v Speaker 3>keep supporting us if is if people keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening and if you raise them where </v>

2367
01:55:02.441 --> 01:55:02.540
<v Speaker 3>people are going to keep listening </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's interesting.</v>

2368
01:55:02.570 --> 01:55:04.820
<v Speaker 3>And the only reason why it's interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because we're being honest.</v>

2369
01:55:04.821 --> 01:55:06.060
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that,</v>

2370
01:55:06.061 --> 01:55:08.210
<v Speaker 3>that whole chain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we're all in it together.</v>

2371
01:55:08.270 --> 01:55:10.010
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the important thing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that like,</v>

2372
01:55:10.530 --> 01:55:12.440
<v Speaker 3>we're here for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're here for us.</v>

2373
01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:16.340
<v Speaker 3>And we're all on that same team to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>that counterculture and to,</v>

2374
01:55:16.910 --> 01:55:20.030
<v Speaker 3>to offer opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also offer facts that are,</v>

2375
01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:23.270
<v Speaker 3>that are based in evidence that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>based in reason,</v>

2376
01:55:23.271 --> 01:55:28.271
<v Speaker 3>that aren't based in some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporate interest or because some </v>

2377
01:55:28.271 --> 01:55:31.151
<v Speaker 3>producer is in that fucking thing in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>ear telling me that I have to do or say </v>
