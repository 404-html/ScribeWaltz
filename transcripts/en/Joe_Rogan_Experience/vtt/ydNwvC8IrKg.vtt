<v Speaker 1>how long can you hold on?</v>

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I personally know I could go a week </v>
<v Speaker 1>without water from my cuts and one 55 so</v>

4
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:12.050
<v Speaker 1>I know I could do a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.990
<v Speaker 1>And that'd be after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on my,</v>

6
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm on my death bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah Dude,</v>

7
00:00:16.101 --> 00:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that anymore.</v>

8
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.103
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that anymore after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you keep talking about like </v>

9
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>fighting Eddie Alvarez cause you already</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat him and now he's the champ.</v>

10
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 1>But God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking good at one 70 yeah.</v>

11
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.223
<v Speaker 1>So you say I didn't look good if 55 I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensation with 55 nine for 10 70 on my </v>

12
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:34.900
<v Speaker 1>last run world beater man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

13
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that you look good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the way you look.</v>

14
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

15
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:40.944
<v Speaker 1>you hit a whole new level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always wonder like is it because </v>

16
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>obviously you keep training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you keep getting better.</v>

17
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things,</v>

18
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 1>learning from experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things are a factor.</v>

19
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.253
<v Speaker 1>But on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also the factor of you not </v>

20
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:56.304
<v Speaker 1>having a cut that fucking wait man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this last fight against rick story </v>

21
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:03.084
<v Speaker 1>against Rick Story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked like you were in the fucking </v>

22
00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:06.000
<v Speaker 1>matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was some Anderson Silva's shit.</v>

23
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.720
<v Speaker 1>I ate five guys three nights that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were in Vegas.</v>

24
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Five guys Burgers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hamburger,</v>

25
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:12.783
<v Speaker 1>double doubles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a food bacon and of those </v>

<v Speaker 1>Of course my trainers are happier.</v>

29
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think I had six pounds to cut.</v>

30
00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:27.920
<v Speaker 1>It was an easy no brainer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 1>But when I saw you before the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before that,</v>

32
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.030
<v Speaker 1>you were a one 76 when you were at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy store.</v>

33
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing.</v>

34
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:35.310

<v Speaker 1>That's for damn sure.</v>

37
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>But it's not a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

38
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:43.560
<v Speaker 1>look how fast you are.</v>

<v Speaker 1>nothing left man.</v>

48

<v Speaker 1>All crack.</v>

79
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>That's the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was wash it from the beginning.</v>

80
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I love about it man.</v>

81
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>What I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love technique.</v>

82
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I love.</v>

83
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Pop to the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the head.</v>

84
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I love about it?</v>

85
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Not a single one of those techniques is </v>
<v Speaker 1>wound up.</v>

86
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Not a single one of those techniques is </v>
<v Speaker 1>full power.</v>

87
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.380
<v Speaker 1>But look how you doing this pop bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crack blind.</v>

88
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>So for everyone that's listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that is the jab,</v>

89
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.680
<v Speaker 1>cross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hook,</v>

90
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>kick.</v>

91
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

92
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 1>because here's the thing about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you throwing all these things is</v>

93
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:49.480
<v Speaker 1>the way everybody should throw every </v>
<v Speaker 1>punch your,</v>

94
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 1>there's no windup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is perfect technique.</v>

95
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 1>The execution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the timing,</v>

96
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the accuracy.</v>

97
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Look how beautiful this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

98
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.280
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is used.</v>

99
00:03:58.281 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 1>So I bet it's hard for you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate.</v>

100
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 1>But for me as a person who calls MMA as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a person who watches fights do,</v>

101
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>when I was calling that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like this.</v>

102
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:07.370
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

103
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.010
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look at this.</v>

104
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is perfect.</v>

105
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how upset I missed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>triangle I am with myself?</v>

106
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a tough guy.</v>

107
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:20.280
<v Speaker 1>He's got good submission defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So last time we talked,</v>

108
00:04:20.281 --> 00:04:23.260
<v Speaker 1>we talk about Calvin watching himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm playing a video game.</v>

109
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>I was in the mode for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

110
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.863
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

111
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 1>That's a matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

112
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.383
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this to me is more impressive than when </v>

113
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.353
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva knocked out forrest </v>
<v Speaker 1>griffin because when Anderson Silva </v>

114
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:34.594
<v Speaker 1>knocked out forrest Griffin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I know about forest was that force </v>

115
00:04:37.051 --> 00:04:37.884
<v Speaker 1>was compromised going into that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had been knocked out twice and </v>

116
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:42.260
<v Speaker 1>training camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a real hard time taking shots and</v>

117
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.990
<v Speaker 1>probably shouldn't have been in there in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first place.</v>

118
