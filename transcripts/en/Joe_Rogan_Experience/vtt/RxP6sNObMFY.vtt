1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously it seemed way worse</v>

2
00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:10.420
<v Speaker 1>over on your side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was more worried when they made us</v>

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.130
<v Speaker 1>leave because the further up you got in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bleachers and once you got out into</v>

4
00:00:15.131 --> 00:00:17.290
<v Speaker 1>the concession area and in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bathrooms,</v>

5
00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:20.500
<v Speaker 1>that's where stuff was going down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just people from the crowd.</v>

6
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know guys with Irish flags all</v>

7
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.670
<v Speaker 1>obviously we're getting trashed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to them and there was a big brawl</v>

8
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.970
<v Speaker 1>right next to me on the other side from</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they were sitting.</v>

9
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was one just to our right.</v>

10
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.470
<v Speaker 1>I was looking left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it was the guy that jumped in</v>

11
00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:37.750
<v Speaker 1>and the registered on Khabib's team when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to leave,</v>

12
00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:40.090
<v Speaker 1>when they're getting them out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the crowd were like,</v>

13
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.880
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start throwing shit at them first.</v>

14
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.740
<v Speaker 1>That's how the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the first shit was getting</v>

15
00:00:44.741 --> 00:00:47.650
<v Speaker 1>thrown down and letting people know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was them.</v>

16
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.350
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all saw it was like,</v>

17
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.970
<v Speaker 1>that's the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the guy right there right now.</v>

18
00:00:51.971 --> 00:00:53.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

19
00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:54.610
<v Speaker 1>And he went and tried to do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was</v>

20
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.620
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

21
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.870
<v Speaker 1>there's a price to be paid for all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

22
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Like all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the drama and the trash talking.</v>

23
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.360
<v Speaker 1>That makes it so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also,</v>

24
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has the potential for blowing up in</v>

25
00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:10.790
<v Speaker 1>your face ultimately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like a couple people got punched,</v>

26
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.210
<v Speaker 1>but it was in an event where a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people got punched.</v>

27
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.280
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like way more than that.</v>

28
00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:17.450
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:19.300
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we,</v>

30
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.580
<v Speaker 1>we've made it seem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seemed like it was way worse than it</v>

31
00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:27.581
<v Speaker 1>really was because in any other</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation it would be way worse than it</v>

32
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:28.340
<v Speaker 1>really was.</v>

33
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Like if it was a rock concert and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes just from,</v>

34
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>

35
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one band was the opening band and then</v>

36
00:01:35.391 --> 00:01:38.810
<v Speaker 1>there was another band that was in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>brawl with them and they were,</v>

37
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.580
<v Speaker 1>they were the main event and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fans of one band through down with the</v>

38
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:45.110
<v Speaker 1>fans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other band of beat the shit out of</v>

39
00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:46.220
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would,</v>

40
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.810
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be way worse than when it's at a fight.</v>

41
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Cause if it's at a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just fighters.</v>

42
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw this in St Cloud.</v>

43
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.870
<v Speaker 1>This was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this insane clown posse guy tried to</v>

44
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:01.820
<v Speaker 1>drop kick Fred Durst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

45
00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Fred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's wasn't even looking at them</v>

46
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.680
<v Speaker 1>running headstart and misses and look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

47
00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:09.800
<v Speaker 1>It turns around like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he just kept going.</v>

48
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.950
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen they drag that dude off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is maybe the worst public</v>

49
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.800
<v Speaker 1>dropkick in the history of the world.</v>

50
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.930
<v Speaker 1>I think they meant he dropped when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to kick even after that.</v>

51
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.020
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were working very hard for this fight</v>

53
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:27.890
<v Speaker 1>in the limit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.990
<v Speaker 1>somewhat limited period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

55
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.170
<v Speaker 1>so we did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't taper off quite the way we</v>

56
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.200
<v Speaker 1>normally do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but roughly two weeks if you wanted to</v>

57
00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:37.870
<v Speaker 1>do a rematch and if the UFC did grant</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement,</v>

58
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.010
<v Speaker 1>this is obviously dependent upon how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevada state athletic commission handles</v>

59
00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:46.550
<v Speaker 1>the legal ramifications of him jumping</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the cage,</v>

60
00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:49.640
<v Speaker 1>attacking Dylan Dannis a subsequent</v>
<v Speaker 1>brawl.</v>

61
00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:52.310
<v Speaker 1>The chaos that ensued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Visas.</v>

62
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.460
<v Speaker 1>You mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with a lot of legal shit</v>

63
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.800
<v Speaker 1>in his fight that that could hold things</v>
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>

64
00:02:57.801 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they held both is correct.</v>

65
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he held a Habib's kind of got his,</v>

66
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:03.041
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

67
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:08.041
<v Speaker 1>Kind of got his purse paid so he gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>his first and Qbb.</v>

68
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows what's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen with him,</v>

69
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.103
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

70
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.011
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

71
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I hope they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're lenient on them and I'm not just</v>

72
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 1>so we can get a rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

73
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 1>I love watching him fight for his diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can,</v>

74
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 1>I can stretch myself to understand his</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction.</v>

75
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>I can stretch myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't stretch myself to understand the</v>

76
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>other guys' reactions on what they did</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave.</v>

77
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.860
<v Speaker 1>He jumped over the cage and he jumps on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

78
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.990
<v Speaker 1>it's not the end of the hall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy that jumped in there was wearing</v>

79
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>red who punched on her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

80
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a boxing and coach,</v>

81
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing he's a fighter.</v>

82
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 1>He fights with the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>into red was done not an old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't older.</v>

84
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.110
<v Speaker 1>He actually worked with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

85
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You work?</v>

86
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:49.600
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is he?</v>

87
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamorada son.</v>

88
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was either his Llama.</v>

89
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was either one of those</v>

90
00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 1>guys like I know is laughing guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

91
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hit done and a guy in a suit that</v>

92
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>heritage is Russian manager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hit dylan either way.</v>

93
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually indicates when your mind</v>

94
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.640
<v Speaker 1>went in and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hit him from behind then.</v>

95
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

96
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't understand that.</v>

97
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.151
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

98
00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:16.040
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Habib,</v>

99
00:04:16.041 --> 00:04:17.530
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

101
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.370
<v Speaker 1>it's such a foolish thing to do because</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing to do,</v>

102
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Speaker 1>I know that Dylan was talking shit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was angry,</v>

103
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:29.550
<v Speaker 1>but like she didn't say anything because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard a few people saying that.</v>

104
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.820
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was standing beside dylan.</v>

105
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.950
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I could hear.</v>

106
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.900
<v Speaker 1>So he didn't say anything now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I watched the back.</v>

107
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he kind of beckoned them on.</v>

108
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

109
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.650
<v Speaker 1>just stupid end the fight stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>

110
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.740
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think it justified that level</v>
<v Speaker 1>of response.</v>

111
00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:44.350
<v Speaker 1>And maybe there was something else in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lead up,</v>

112
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:46.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing as a bit of a troll online.</v>

113
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.033
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

114
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.380
<v Speaker 1>there was probably a bit of a buildup of</v>
<v Speaker 1>voter stuff,</v>

115
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.510
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

116
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:53.111
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

117
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:55.410
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that big a deal to me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She was super friendly,</v>

159
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.260

<v Speaker 1>Scientology was sort of a stigmatized,</v>

162
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.420
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of people that were</v>

163
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:01.280
<v Speaker 1>joining it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is going on there?</v>

164
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.540
<v Speaker 1>What we see is a black cap on that hair</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so crazy fake looking.</v>

165
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.080
<v Speaker 1>That's like that magnetic man that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could like move.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The magnets are on the Korean hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like who's fucking hair looks like that?</v>

170
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 1>That's madness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when someone says Stephen Hawking's</v>

171
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.610
<v Speaker 1>identified as a British,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he identifies a dead or dying when he</v>

<v Speaker 1>was alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>British physicist slash heterosexual</v>

174
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 1>atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a heterosexual identify who by the way</v>

175
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:35.683
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

176
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.551
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rebuttal.</v>

177
00:07:36.551 --> 00:07:39.260
<v Speaker 1>The freak riddled with infidelity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never met a guy,</v>

178
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.980
<v Speaker 1>so not capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cheating and found a way to cheat on</v>

179
00:07:42.981 --> 00:07:43.431
<v Speaker 1>his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

180
00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:44.630
<v Speaker 1>apparently you can still get it up.</v>

181
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well apparently even though his body</v>

182
00:07:47.841 --> 00:07:50.390
<v Speaker 1>didn't move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could feel things.</v>

183
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.480
<v Speaker 1>That was his son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is the scientist he used to go to was</v>

184
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Eric Weinstein told me about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

185
00:07:56.181 --> 00:07:56.691
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

186
00:07:56.691 --> 00:07:57.524
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a freak.</v>

187
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

188
00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.510
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

189
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:01.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he used to go to strip clubs and there's</v>

190
00:08:01.521 --> 00:08:04.400
<v Speaker 1>like videos of him like rolling into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>strip club in the wheelchair.</v>

191
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Like he would go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was his thing.</v>

192
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Where'd you get littered with</v>
<v Speaker 1>infidelity?</v>

193
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 1>What'd you hear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That he cheated on his wife all the</v>

194
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:13.780
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We w we in that fucking movie.</v>

195
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.740
<v Speaker 1>The whole reason that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

196
00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:18.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean the whole reason that he left his</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife was because he fell in love with</v>

197
00:08:18.321 --> 00:08:20.160
<v Speaker 1>somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But wasn't it like a nurse there was</v>

198
00:08:20.161 --> 00:08:23.470
<v Speaker 1>taking down what the truth was that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was my boss and the nurses,</v>

199
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.160
<v Speaker 1>if you google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you Google Stephen Hawking,</v>

200
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.680
<v Speaker 1>he was affiliate of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was always fucking around.</v>

<v Speaker 1>pubs.</v>

205
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

251
00:10:42.221 --> 00:10:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you're a target it's just too</v>

252
00:10:46.181 --> 00:10:47.650
<v Speaker 1>painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.740
<v Speaker 1>Well definitely shouldn't be reading</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit.</v>

254
00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:51.820

255
00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

256
00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:54.211
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

257
00:10:54.211 --> 00:10:56.140
<v Speaker 1>when you become a target,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know if you don't read it?</v>

258
00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what I'd lived through when first</v>

259
00:11:00.021 --> 00:11:03.290
<v Speaker 3>happened and that's been like four or so</v>
<v Speaker 3>months ago,</v>

260
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.970
<v Speaker 3>so I just know how I've reacted in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>locker or real life since that happened</v>

261
00:11:07.971 --> 00:11:08.540
<v Speaker 3>to me.</v>

262
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.560
<v Speaker 1>How long did it take for things die off</v>
<v Speaker 1>to die off?</v>

263
00:11:12.561 --> 00:11:14.900
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean slow down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where they weren't just coming after you</v>

264
00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:17.870
<v Speaker 1>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I told you that news crews,</v>

265
00:11:17.871 --> 00:11:20.780
<v Speaker 1>when they found out that you were going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come on the podcast the first time</v>

266
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.600
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to show up at my house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to show up at the</v>

267
00:11:23.601 --> 00:11:25.250
<v Speaker 1>studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to find me at the</v>

268
00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:26.520
<v Speaker 1>comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

269
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean they were just trying to hunt</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

270
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything about you?</v>

271
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:35.060
<v Speaker 3>I know I was sneaking segues from my</v>
<v Speaker 3>boyfriend because we were at my mom's</v>

272
00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:36.500
<v Speaker 3>house when I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

273
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:42.030
<v Speaker 3>w we were at home in Salt Lake City.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I tweeted at 2:11 AM I just woke up</v>

274
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.710
<v Speaker 3>and I had this thought in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

275
00:11:45.711 --> 00:11:50.711
<v Speaker 3>this can make so much sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I tweeted it and I went right</v>

276
00:11:50.811 --> 00:11:53.240
<v Speaker 3>back to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I woke up at seven,</v>

277
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.820
<v Speaker 3>the shit had hit the fan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

278
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was like,</v>

279
00:11:56.351 --> 00:11:59.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to expound on this later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of those kinds of things.</v>

280
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.170
<v Speaker 3>You just want to get it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

281
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always slept with my computer and tweet</v>

282
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:05.950
<v Speaker 3>when I wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

283
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:07.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're old you have to go to the</v>

284
00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:09.250
<v Speaker 3>bathroom a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I always tweet and fall back to</v>

285
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:10.900
<v Speaker 3>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>C and I,</v>

286
00:12:10.901 --> 00:12:13.120

287
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:15.300

<v Speaker 3>when I took my Ambien,</v>

288
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.440
<v Speaker 3>I called my daughter and she or she</v>
