<v Speaker 1>but there's two things.</v>

30
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Someone should've given me a heads up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

31
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:07.563
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of the pallbearers were in </v>

32
00:01:09.251 --> 00:01:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Cammo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

33
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had a serious hunter.</v>

34
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunter biker.</v>

35
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Where do you live?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

36
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.700
<v Speaker 1>central New York and Syracuse and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rome and around.</v>

37
00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:19.990
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love my brother,</v>

38
00:01:19.991 --> 00:01:21.290
<v Speaker 1>but he was wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

39
00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:22.124
<v Speaker 1>and then the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably should have given me a </v>

40
00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:28.681
<v Speaker 1>heads up that it's friend a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ricky was one of the pallbearers.</v>

41
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

42
00:01:33.341 --> 00:01:34.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.133
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

44
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to use the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say,</v>

45
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.970
<v Speaker 1>he's like a Munchkin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>

46
00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:42.100
<v Speaker 1>safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to use the other word.</v>

47
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't a tiny person.</v>

48
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a little person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't a dwarf,</v>

49
00:01:46.091 --> 00:01:49.420
<v Speaker 1>but because he was regular size almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

50
00:01:49.421 --> 00:01:51.880
<v Speaker 1>He was tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't look,</v>

51
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I get it,</v>

52
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.610
<v Speaker 1>but nobody said ricky was going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pallbearer or give me a heads up.</v>

53
00:01:57.611 --> 00:01:58.444
<v Speaker 1>So I looked down the end of the church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in the middle on one side of the </v>

54
00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 1>casket and then middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>And I said to my daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

56
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.660
<v Speaker 1>looks like Ricky's riding a subway.</v>

57
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.170
<v Speaker 1>My Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

58
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.153
<v Speaker 1>I think he just got air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the brace is going on about how </v>

59
00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:21.190
<v Speaker 1>my brother Tommy loved the outdoors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He loved animals.</v>

60
00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:23.380
<v Speaker 1>And then I went on after the breeze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

61
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.460
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be impolite,</v>

62
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.240
<v Speaker 1>but my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brother was like to kill animals.</v>

63
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.650
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of deer right now in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>woods going,</v>

<v Speaker 1>So very dear rich place.</v>

66
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:40.550
<v Speaker 1>People don't have a lot of tolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those animals,</v>

67
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.010
<v Speaker 1>a lot of car accidents.</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was more now than when I was a</v>

69
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:48.620

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

158
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.260
