1
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.421
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're live.</v>

2
00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kyle.</v>

3
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan.</v>

4
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Do you look very good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in a suit.</v>

5
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6
00:00:08.411 --> 00:00:11.020
<v Speaker 1>I like to pretend that I'm a serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being by wearing this,</v>

7
00:00:11.021 --> 00:00:12.040
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:15.340
<v Speaker 1>you're a youngest fellow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe a suit would give you more of</v>

9
00:00:15.341 --> 00:00:20.080
<v Speaker 1>an air of calm composure authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps.</v>

10
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look like you're really serious</v>

11
00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:26.530
<v Speaker 1>than people assume you're serious and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know that I'm making Dick</v>

12
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Jokes and exactly like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good movie.</v>

13
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.960
<v Speaker 1>It's very smart move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had some suits made.</v>

14
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.190
<v Speaker 1>I had to do this function for one of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids' schools and I had to go to this</v>

15
00:00:36.191 --> 00:00:38.860
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had to wear nice clothes.</v>

16
00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:41.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like a dress up thing and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>really have nice clothes,</v>

17
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.010
<v Speaker 1>nothing that like fits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I had to have something made so</v>

18
00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:48.130
<v Speaker 1>now I've been wearing it when I go on</v>
<v Speaker 1>special dates with Mrs Rogan.</v>

19
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.050
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a suit like this.</v>

20
00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:52.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a nice suit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jacket and tailored.</v>

21
00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:54.820
<v Speaker 1>The whole deal fits me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how do you feel when you put it on?</v>

22
00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like a serious person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a serious person,</v>

23
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.890
<v Speaker 1>like if I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I dress like this,</v>

24
00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:03.730
<v Speaker 1>but like a hoodie and a tee shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a Schlub.</v>

25
00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a Dork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Graham,</v>

26
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.910
<v Speaker 1>there's this thing that I do wear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when I'm doing my show.</v>

27
00:01:09.911 --> 00:01:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes you do that half assed move</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I look like this,</v>

28
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.870
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the shorts on or I might have</v>

29
00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:18.400
<v Speaker 1>sweat pants sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

30
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.270
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

31
00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:21.690
<v Speaker 1>It all depends on what mood I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean sometimes I'll,</v>

32
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.450
<v Speaker 1>I'll do the whole thing and look nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but usually I'm just being lazy and one</v>

33
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Guy Ritchie who was on the podcast and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he made a very good statement in defense</v>

34
00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:32.344
<v Speaker 1>of the suit.</v>

35
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.220
<v Speaker 1>It was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a really interesting sort of</v>

36
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.550
<v Speaker 1>testimony in defense of the suit and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pocket square.</v>

37
00:01:39.551 --> 00:01:41.140
<v Speaker 1>He's a big believer of the pocket</v>
<v Speaker 1>square,</v>

38
00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:42.910
<v Speaker 1>which I think is preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a little too far.</v>

39
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.740
<v Speaker 1>It's too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you,</v>

40
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.130
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't go out of style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing is like if you look at</v>

41
00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:49.600
<v Speaker 1>a picture of somebody from like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen,</v>

42
00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you look at a picture of somebody</v>

43
00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 1>from 2018 and they're wearing a suit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

44
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.881
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

45
00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:58.990
<v Speaker 1>But then other aspects of style and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion change so fast.</v>

46
00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:00.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean you look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the,</v>

47
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I think they were called Chanko is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the really baggy jeans that people wore.</v>

48
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a cabaret cheese.</v>

49
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

50
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.220
<v Speaker 1>that really was something that we used</v>
<v Speaker 1>to where I'm dating myself.</v>

51
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.440
<v Speaker 1>This is like in the early nineties,</v>

52
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 1>late eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early nineties.</v>

53
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.410
<v Speaker 1>It was like they were tight to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

54
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Speaker 1>your pelvic region and then they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>flare up when they got past MC hammer</v>

55
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:30.450
<v Speaker 1>pants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So terrible.</v>

56
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.550
<v Speaker 1>But those didn't really make it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there were,</v>

57
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>but they did make it in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go to the gym,</v>

58
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:40.860
<v Speaker 1>there's still guys who were these kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sweat pants that are like these kind</v>

59
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 1>of Puffy sweatpants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're usually juiced out of their</v>

60
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:44.244
<v Speaker 1>minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

61
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.180
<v Speaker 1>These are the workout clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wears it.</v>

62
00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Probably wear those pants because there</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

63
00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:50.680
<v Speaker 1>There's cavalry cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

64
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.590
<v Speaker 1>I used to wear those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to get laid.</v>

65
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.950
<v Speaker 1>That's the opposite of trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>laid.</v>

66
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Not In those days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back in those days like people didn't</v>

67
00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

68
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's</v>

69
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 2>like eggs is that things change except</v>
<v Speaker 2>powdered wigs.</v>

70
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.050
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people.</v>

71
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.790
<v Speaker 2>People came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

72
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 2>We found out on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came from syphilis.</v>

73
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole wig thing came out of royalty.</v>

74
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 2>These royals had syphilis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the whole story?</v>

75
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:21.331
<v Speaker 2>It was about the term big wig and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were the people was a Dutch Dutch</v>

76
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 2>kings who is the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who were the kings,</v>

77
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 2>so you could find that story because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fascinating story.</v>

78
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 2>What it was was there was these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they were brothers and they had</v>

79
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 2>syphilis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were just banging everybody.</v>

80
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do people wear powdered wigs and it</v>

81
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:38.500
<v Speaker 2>all came from a hair loss that these</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys would have.</v>

82
00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 2>There it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The proof story begins.</v>

83
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:45.350
<v Speaker 2>Like many others with syphilis by 15 a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the std had become the worst epidemic to</v>

84
00:03:45.351 --> 00:03:48.920
<v Speaker 2>strike Europe since the black death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to William Close.</v>

85
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.870
<v Speaker 2>Klaus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>close C,</v>

86
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 2>l o w e s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would you say that either one.</v>

87
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 2>Close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say an infinite multitude of syphilis.</v>

88
00:03:57.071 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 2>Patients clogged London's hospitals and</v>
<v Speaker 2>more filtered in each day without</v>

89
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Victims face the full brunt of the</v>

90
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open sores,</v>

91
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 2>nasty rashes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blind,</v>

92
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 2>endless demand blindness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dementia and patchy hair loss.</v>

93
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Baldness swept the land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I'm saying.</v>

94
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm healthy.</v>

95
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.021
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

96
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 2>it just became a thing because these raw</v>
<v Speaker 2>scroll down.</v>

97
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 2>So it'll tell you like who the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>were that did it.</v>

98
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

99
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it went a little too far and so syphilis</v>

100
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 2>outbreak sparked a surgeon which making</v>
<v Speaker 2>wig making victims hid their baldness,</v>

101
00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:29.240
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

102
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.531
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

103
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:30.430
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Louis,</v>

104
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:33.670
<v Speaker 2>the 14th was only 17 when his mom</v>
<v Speaker 2>started thinning,</v>

105
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 2>worried that his baldness would hurt his</v>
<v Speaker 2>reputation.</v>

106
00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Louis hired 48 week makers to save as</v>
<v Speaker 2>image.</v>

107
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.470
<v Speaker 2>Five years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the King of England,</v>

108
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Louise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cousin Charles,</v>

109
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.790
<v Speaker 2>the second did the same thing when his</v>
<v Speaker 2>hair started to gray.</v>

110
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 2>Both men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>likelihood syphilis,</v>

111
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.470
<v Speaker 2>cordy airs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you say that?</v>

112
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Courtney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Courtney Hayes and other aristocrats</v>

113
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:56.380
<v Speaker 2>immediately copied the two kings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sported wigs and the style trickled</v>

114
00:04:56.381 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 2>down to the upper middle class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe's newest fad was born and so</v>

115
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 2>that's where it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the whole powdered wigs with people</v>

116
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 2>of distinction in court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that shit came from syphilis.</v>

117
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 2>What's like most things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

118
00:05:08.831 --> 00:05:11.140
<v Speaker 2>whenever somebody tries to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

119
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 2>Kinda like deify the founding fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always think,</v>

120
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were brilliant on some things,</v>

121
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:18.480
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hand they wore powdered</v>
<v Speaker 2>wigs and shat.</v>

122
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.890
<v Speaker 2>Now's outhouses and enslaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

123
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.420
<v Speaker 2>So like there's a little bit of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>balance that we have to take into</v>

124
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.910
<v Speaker 2>consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

125
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about how much cultural change has</v>

126
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:31.930
<v Speaker 2>taken place in our society just over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last few years.</v>

127
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.280
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean words that were commonplace are</v>

128
00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:39.440
<v Speaker 2>now completely unacceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

129
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.610
<v Speaker 2>styles of behavior and methods of</v>
<v Speaker 2>expression are being criticized and</v>

130
00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:47.860
<v Speaker 2>critiqued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It this really radical way.</v>

131
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.810
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ultimately,</v>

132
00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:52.900
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say it's good,</v>

133
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 2>but the sentiment is good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

134
00:05:55.871 --> 00:05:59.180
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of the overreaction,</v>

135
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 2>like there's a spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

136
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.190
<v Speaker 2>There's always going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you see the,</v>

137
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.940
<v Speaker 2>there was something that came out</v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday from Portland State University</v>

138
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.280
<v Speaker 2>where Peter but goes in and James Damore</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Google memo guy and uh,</v>

139
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.070
<v Speaker 2>heather hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was a professor at Evergreen state</v>

140
00:06:17.071 --> 00:06:22.071
<v Speaker 2>and I remember what the Jordan Peterson</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she was actually on my podcast last</v>

141
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 2>week with her husband,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bret Weinstein.</v>

142
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Weinstein can't stay wind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not thinking of the same person.</v>

143
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.540
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking of the person who got</v>
<v Speaker 2>fired because of,</v>

144
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.450
<v Speaker 2>she'd not function and get fired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she criticized her for playing a</v>

145
00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:33.230
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson thing.</v>

146
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 2>Is that the same person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

147
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.720
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

148
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.720
<v Speaker 2>That's Lindsey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was in a different university.</v>

149
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Canada in Canada,</v>

150
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:46.340
<v Speaker 2>another university in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

151
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.660
<v Speaker 2>this is in Portland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

152
00:06:47.661 --> 00:06:49.690
<v Speaker 2>so they're in the middle of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

153
00:06:49.691 --> 00:06:54.530
<v Speaker 2>And Heather who is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a biologist and she starts going</v>

154
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:59.210
<v Speaker 2>over the biology of the differences</v>
<v Speaker 2>between males and females that are</v>

155
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.440
<v Speaker 2>undeniable and these kids get up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they started yelling that this is</v>

156
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:08.170
<v Speaker 2>bullshit and fuck you and power to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

157
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.090
<v Speaker 2>all this crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they tip over the sound system</v>

158
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.740
<v Speaker 2>and they're the most hilarious classical</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal,</v>

159
00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:18.260
<v Speaker 2>progressive lefties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>green hair.</v>

160
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.320
<v Speaker 2>The guy who was like this poofy Afro and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

161
00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:23.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't tolerate Nazis man,</v>

162
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.880
<v Speaker 2>like fucking Nazis or biologist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a shit.</v>

163
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.450
<v Speaker 2>That stuff is the kind of stuff that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think turns people off to the left and</v>

164
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.080
<v Speaker 2>almost provides a gateway to the right.</v>

165
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.470
<v Speaker 2>We're all of a sudden people can buy</v>
<v Speaker 2>into and even broader right wing</v>

166
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:43.190
<v Speaker 2>ideology because if you look at the left</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's your perception of the left</v>

167
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.610
<v Speaker 2>is it's the people with the pink hair or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blue hair and they're just going</v>

168
00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:49.070
<v Speaker 2>around and their whole point is two d</v>
<v Speaker 2>platform.</v>

169
00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:51.830
<v Speaker 2>People are sensor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are screaming about Ben Shapiro</v>

170
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:55.400
<v Speaker 2>or whatever the case is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my whole thing is put.</v>

171
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.800
<v Speaker 2>If you're on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think most lefties do this to be</v>

172
00:07:57.801 --> 00:07:59.990
<v Speaker 2>fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put the identity politics aside.</v>

173
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.980
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And let's talk about the things that we</v>

174
00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 2>actually already have a majority of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>American people with us on.</v>

175
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a classic leftwing idea.</v>

176
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Let's have a living wage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The minimum wage is not a living wage</v>

177
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:13.400
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could work full time and not make</v>

178
00:08:13.401 --> 00:08:14.690
<v Speaker 2>enough money to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

179
00:08:14.691 --> 00:08:17.480
<v Speaker 2>if you're on the left and you go out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and you talk about we need to</v>

180
00:08:17.481 --> 00:08:20.180
<v Speaker 2>fight to try to get a living wage and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make our government work for us.</v>

181
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Well then you get everybody to agree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with you.</v>

182
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Even most Republicans agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't go down the list.</v>

183
00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:27.620
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's legalizing marijuana is 60</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of the American people are now</v>

184
00:08:27.621 --> 00:08:31.270
<v Speaker 2>with us ending the wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a poll that came out in a</v>

185
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:33.680
<v Speaker 2>2013,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's old admittedly,</v>

186
00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:37.240
<v Speaker 2>but only 17 percent of the American</v>
<v Speaker 2>people still want it to be in the,</v>

187
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.500
<v Speaker 2>in the war in Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're still there today.</v>

188
00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:41.390
<v Speaker 2>I'd imagine if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that number probably dropped even</v>

189
00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:42.230
<v Speaker 2>further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everybody's like,</v>

190
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:44.170
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing in Afghanistan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

191
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.640
<v Speaker 2>But isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with polls is when you ask</v>

192
00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:48.290
<v Speaker 2>people about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not asking them if they're</v>

193
00:08:48.291 --> 00:08:50.000
<v Speaker 2>informed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just asking you.</v>

194
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.740
<v Speaker 2>You're just asking your opinion on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I was saying about the left versus</v>

195
00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:57.900
<v Speaker 2>the right is that the real problem is</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody can be on either,</v>

196
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.700
<v Speaker 2>so you're going to get these people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to disrupt this heather hiring</v>

197
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.800
<v Speaker 2>lecture on biology from an informed</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific perspective and like,</v>

198
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this man is a patriarchy.</v>

199
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.330
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're also going to get people like</v>

200
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:13.390
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're also gonna.</v>

201
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:18.410
<v Speaker 2>Get people that are aware of the issues</v>
<v Speaker 2>and educated and are debating this in a</v>

202
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:22.950
<v Speaker 2>very public way and trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the best possible solution to</v>

203
00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:25.680
<v Speaker 2>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is anytime you have a group,</v>

204
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:30.890
<v Speaker 2>whether it's pick the group gun owners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegans,</v>

205
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.290
<v Speaker 2>what are anybody can fucking join man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as soon as anybody can join,</v>

206
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.650
<v Speaker 2>you can't look at like the worst case</v>
<v Speaker 2>scenarios.</v>

207
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.030
<v Speaker 2>The green haired Dork that kicks over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the microphone because they don't like</v>

208
00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:45.870
<v Speaker 2>the idea that heather is speaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>logically about biology.</v>

209
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.870
<v Speaker 2>Like no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to look at like the the whole</v>

210
00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:49.704
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

211
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.880
<v Speaker 2>And we don't like to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd like to point at the green hair</v>

212
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.300
<v Speaker 2>dork and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey liberals,</v>

213
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:55.650
<v Speaker 2>there's your left Sharon.</v>

214
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:59.110
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know the breakdown to me is when</v>

215
00:09:59.111 --> 00:10:02.290
<v Speaker 3>you look at somebody like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're in the category of what I would</v>

216
00:10:02.291 --> 00:10:06.100
<v Speaker 3>call authoritarian left because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to control other people's actions.</v>

217
00:10:06.101 --> 00:10:07.540
<v Speaker 3>They want to shut down that speech and</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

218
00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:09.670
<v Speaker 3>your ideas are so dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even want to hear it.</v>

219
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.500
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole nother contingent of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>

220
00:10:11.501 --> 00:10:13.840
<v Speaker 3>which again I would argue is probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>the majority of the left,</v>

221
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:18.070
<v Speaker 3>which is the libertarian left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is people like me and many others</v>

222
00:10:18.071 --> 00:10:18.700
<v Speaker 3>who say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

223
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.740
<v Speaker 3>live and let live on social issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm never,</v>

224
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:24.010
<v Speaker 3>even though I don't agree with Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steven crowder bench purell on anything,</v>

225
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm never gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

226
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.610
<v Speaker 3>try to protest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To get them to not speak their mind at a</v>

227
00:10:30.611 --> 00:10:34.990
<v Speaker 3>school is foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes it look like you don't have an</v>

228
00:10:34.991 --> 00:10:37.600
<v Speaker 3>argument when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't let that guy talk,</v>

229
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.880
<v Speaker 3>and then they get to go around and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so persecuted because I'm right.</v>

230
00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:41.610
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

231
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.240
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile I say,</v>

232
00:10:43.241 --> 00:10:44.590
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to have somebody like that go</v>

233
00:10:44.591 --> 00:10:45.460
<v Speaker 3>speak to college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>

234
00:10:45.461 --> 00:10:46.330
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let them speak.</v>

235
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.520
<v Speaker 3>Let me get this speech after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

236
00:10:48.521 --> 00:10:49.354
<v Speaker 3>it's good enough.</v>

237
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think open conversations are critical</v>

238
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.870
<v Speaker 2>and I also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is going to probably be unpopular.</v>

239
00:10:55.871 --> 00:10:58.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the way to do it is in</v>
<v Speaker 2>front of a large group of people.</v>

240
00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.450
<v Speaker 2>I think you open yourself up to a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>grandstanding,</v>

241
00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.530
<v Speaker 2>a lot of saying things just for applause</v>
<v Speaker 2>breaks a lot of.</v>

242
00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:05.980
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just.</v>

243
00:11:05.981 --> 00:11:08.950
<v Speaker 2>It changes the nature of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation because it becomes theater.</v>

244
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.210
<v Speaker 2>You're doing this thing in front of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people and you can hear a lot of</v>

245
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.940
<v Speaker 2>these times people say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a comic,</v>

246
00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:18.670
<v Speaker 2>so I know when someone's saying things</v>
<v Speaker 2>for reaction,</v>

247
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:22.120
<v Speaker 2>there's a way you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you say it like this and that's</v>

248
00:11:22.121 --> 00:11:23.170
<v Speaker 2>what we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everybody goes,</v>

249
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.490
<v Speaker 2>you do not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do not talk like that when it's just</v>

250
00:11:27.491 --> 00:11:29.770
<v Speaker 2>you and a person was just you and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

251
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.480
<v Speaker 2>You are just alone with your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that is the way a guy like</v>

252
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.020
<v Speaker 2>Ben Shapiro and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

253
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.680
<v Speaker 2>put whoever you want on the left should</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a discussion.</v>

254
00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

255
00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.180
<v Speaker 3>there's something about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that soft history,</v>

256
00:11:43.181 --> 00:11:43.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

257
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.850
<v Speaker 3>so you're not creating the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>

258
00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.550
<v Speaker 3>You're just trying to sound like you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have the best argument.</v>

259
00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.290
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Maher,</v>

260
00:11:50.291 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does this where he's very at the punchy</v>

261
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.180
<v Speaker 2>one liners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

262
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 2>Like he's in a conversation with his</v>
<v Speaker 2>panel on his show and it'll be like</v>

263
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.451
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

264
00:11:58.451 --> 00:11:58.960
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

265
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.160
<v Speaker 2>And there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a comment,</v>

266
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.100
<v Speaker 2>say anything you just kept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a quick partisan hacky point</v>

267
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:08.110
<v Speaker 2>you made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But since people already agree with you</v>

268
00:12:08.111 --> 00:12:09.190
<v Speaker 2>in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they clap.</v>

269
00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:12.030
<v Speaker 2>So it's hard to flesh out the ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And really that's why.</v>

270
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.740
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always said I'm not the biggest fan</v>

271
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.120
<v Speaker 2>of debate because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've done a few debates and people</v>

272
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:21.670
<v Speaker 2>online like when I do debates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not the biggest fan of debates</v>

273
00:12:21.671 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 2>because I think it's like the wwe of</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual pursuits where you go in,</v>

274
00:12:26.531 --> 00:12:29.950
<v Speaker 2>this person's whole point is to defend</v>
<v Speaker 2>this side of it.</v>

275
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.100
<v Speaker 2>My job is to defend the other side of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

276
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.330
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clash.</v>

277
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.201
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

278
00:12:35.201 --> 00:12:40.201
<v Speaker 2>well then when we come across an issue</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the fucking 64 genders on facebook</v>

279
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:42.640
<v Speaker 2>or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I actually might agree,</v>

280
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.950
<v Speaker 2>am I now put in a position where I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be like,</v>

281
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:46.510
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to disagree because that's the</v>

282
00:12:46.511 --> 00:12:47.800
<v Speaker 2>format of the thing that we're doing.</v>

283
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.170
<v Speaker 2>It's just weird and it's not normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

284
00:12:50.171 --> 00:12:53.320
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's actually very</v>
<v Speaker 2>important for both sides to do.</v>

285
00:12:53.321 --> 00:12:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Like when there's something on your side</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the disagree with you should be</v>

286
00:12:56.411 --> 00:13:00.160
<v Speaker 2>honest about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even saying that that there's a side</v>

287
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.370
<v Speaker 2>that there are sides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's our side versus their side.</v>

288
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:06.520
<v Speaker 2>We're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're so inherently tribal that</v>

289
00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:09.370
<v Speaker 2>we should resist any temptation</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever to form teams,</v>

290
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:13.120
<v Speaker 2>especially about critical issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like really important social issues,</v>

291
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:17.170
<v Speaker 2>really important economic issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really important civil rights issues.</v>

292
00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:20.470
<v Speaker 2>These are just things that we should</v>
<v Speaker 2>just talk about without looking at them</v>

293
00:13:20.471 --> 00:13:21.520
<v Speaker 2>in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

294
00:13:21.521 --> 00:13:24.450
<v Speaker 2>the left wants this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I oppose it or the right ones this.</v>

295
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.420
<v Speaker 2>So I have to figure out ways to mock it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

296
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

297
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:31.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what to say in</v>
<v Speaker 2>response to that.</v>

298
00:13:31.901 --> 00:13:32.734
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that.</v>

299
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

300
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:39.010
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about this before the</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast that like what I try to do is</v>

301
00:13:39.011 --> 00:13:42.940
<v Speaker 2>have conversations with everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to have conversations with nutty</v>

302
00:13:42.941 --> 00:13:46.240
<v Speaker 2>people like Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to have conversations with</v>

303
00:13:46.241 --> 00:13:49.390
<v Speaker 2>rational people like Sam Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I touch on have conversations with all</v>

304
00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:51.760
<v Speaker 2>kinds of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but without fail,</v>

305
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.170
<v Speaker 2>every time I have a left wing person on</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

306
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.350
<v Speaker 2>some Kuk left wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

307
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen anytime I have a</v>

308
00:13:58.661 --> 00:14:00.080
<v Speaker 2>right wing person on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

309
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.330
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

310
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:06.450
<v Speaker 2>Nazi apologist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this weird inclination we have</v>

311
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:11.550
<v Speaker 2>to try to label and categorize people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I try to resist those labels as much</v>

312
00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:13.870
<v Speaker 2>as humanly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

313
00:14:13.871 --> 00:14:17.350
<v Speaker 2>I feel like what you're really good at</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you can have on people who disagree</v>

314
00:14:17.351 --> 00:14:22.351
<v Speaker 2>completely on stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you'll kind of find a nugget of</v>

315
00:14:22.451 --> 00:14:26.680
<v Speaker 2>agreement in the conversation with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>person and then you can expand on that</v>

316
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.320
<v Speaker 2>and you can end up having a very nice</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation and you're not.</v>

317
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:33.550
<v Speaker 2>You never really bring anybody on to try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to like brow beat them and tell them</v>

318
00:14:33.551 --> 00:14:35.230
<v Speaker 2>that they're wrong on this issue or that</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

319
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.390
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no desire to do that.</v>

320
00:14:37.391 --> 00:14:38.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

321
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:39.640
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had.</v>

322
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.760
<v Speaker 2>I've had a lot of arguments in my life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't like them.</v>

323
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

324
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.830
<v Speaker 2>I think debate is good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but every time I've ever been in an</v>

325
00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.560
<v Speaker 2>argument with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a real argument always come out of</v>

326
00:14:50.561 --> 00:14:51.530
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feeling Gross.</v>

327
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're.</v>

328
00:14:52.151 --> 00:14:54.200
<v Speaker 2>There are times in life or arguments are</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>

329
00:14:54.201 --> 00:14:58.670
<v Speaker 2>There's times in life where you're just</v>
<v Speaker 2>faced with aggression or conflict and</v>

330
00:14:58.671 --> 00:15:00.650
<v Speaker 2>you have to do something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to meet it head on.</v>

331
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.820
<v Speaker 2>There are times in likely that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whenever you can avoid that do and I</v>

332
00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:09.170
<v Speaker 2>think a lot of what arguments are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I failed at this in my life many</v>

333
00:15:09.171 --> 00:15:11.870
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of what arguments are is the</v>

334
00:15:11.871 --> 00:15:16.250
<v Speaker 2>way you've reacted to the the thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the expression that another person</v>

335
00:15:16.251 --> 00:15:20.720
<v Speaker 2>has and if you just reacted a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>way or approach it in a different manner</v>

336
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.960
<v Speaker 2>or took it into consideration a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit more before you responded.</v>

337
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.070
<v Speaker 2>I think the conversation could have gone</v>
<v Speaker 2>another way and I think I'm learning how</v>

338
00:15:28.071 --> 00:15:31.330
<v Speaker 2>to do that more and more as I get better</v>
<v Speaker 2>at podcasting,</v>

339
00:15:31.331 --> 00:15:35.510
<v Speaker 2>at better at conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning how to just settle someone down</v>

340
00:15:35.511 --> 00:15:38.570
<v Speaker 2>and learning how to genuinely be a nice</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

341
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.750
<v Speaker 2>So I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to insult anybody.</v>

342
00:15:41.751 --> 00:15:44.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be in a disagreement</v>
<v Speaker 2>with someone.</v>

343
00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:46.580
<v Speaker 2>I want to discuss ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

344
00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:50.260
<v Speaker 3>Who was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who is that skeptic guy from years back</v>

345
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:54.100
<v Speaker 3>that he put you on the list of top 10</v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy,</v>

346
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.610
<v Speaker 3>blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then running,</v>

347
00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.770
<v Speaker 3>and then I remember watching that clip</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was so frustrating when you guys</v>

348
00:15:59.771 --> 00:16:01.480
<v Speaker 3>were going back and forth because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>would say,</v>

349
00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.760
<v Speaker 3>I think you were talking about the 9:11</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and you're like,</v>

350
00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not saying it was a conspiracy.</v>

351
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:10.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying it looked like the building</v>
<v Speaker 3>came down in a controlled demolition.</v>

352
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.510
<v Speaker 3>Those are two very different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one thing to say,</v>

353
00:16:13.511 --> 00:16:16.060
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's another thing to say the way it</v>

354
00:16:16.061 --> 00:16:19.270
<v Speaker 3>came down a look like it was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>controlled demolition,</v>

355
00:16:19.271 --> 00:16:24.100
<v Speaker 3>but he kept insisting and trying to tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>you what you believe as you're sitting</v>

356
00:16:24.101 --> 00:16:24.970
<v Speaker 3>across the room and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

357
00:16:24.971 --> 00:16:26.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was trying to tell me what I was</v>

358
00:16:26.891 --> 00:16:27.810
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

359
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:28.400
<v Speaker 3>And it was</v>

360
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.520
<v Speaker 2>clear in all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

361
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:33.500
<v Speaker 2>how do I say this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

362
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:38.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Brian is a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think his brain works correctly.</v>

363
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>

364
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.810
<v Speaker 2>there's a real problem there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when he does these science,</v>

365
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.320
<v Speaker 2>these videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he sounds like a strip club Dj.</v>

366
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.130
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've never seen his original</v>

367
00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.190
<v Speaker 2>content that people talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will they take on an effective.</v>

368
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:58.580
<v Speaker 2>There's a wet heat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that thing is done by people that</v>

369
00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:02.120
<v Speaker 2>are trying to achieve a desired result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not that they're themselves</v>

370
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:07.270
<v Speaker 2>talking about a very specific thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that they are trying to put on an</v>

371
00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.740
<v Speaker 2>air of intellectual authority and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

372
00:17:09.741 --> 00:17:12.740
<v Speaker 2>he talks to himself as a science writer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is.</v>

373
00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't hate that guy.</v>

374
00:17:13.761 --> 00:17:16.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not mad at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing was kind of foolish and</v>

375
00:17:16.381 --> 00:17:17.720
<v Speaker 2>it was very damaging to him.</v>

376
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.250
<v Speaker 2>And he wound up going to jail</v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards.</v>

377
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

378
00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Not because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because of something that he did,</v>

379
00:17:22.521 --> 00:17:25.250
<v Speaker 2>he was involved some sort of scam with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

380
00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:28.850
<v Speaker 2>was it Amazon or Google?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ebay.</v>

381
00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:31.490
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was involved in some sort of a scam</v>

382
00:17:31.491 --> 00:17:34.520
<v Speaker 2>or he had an embedded cookies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd go to his site and make it.</v>

383
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.210
<v Speaker 2>Made it look like when you were buying</v>
<v Speaker 2>things online that you had gone through</v>

384
00:17:38.211 --> 00:17:40.100
<v Speaker 2>his site first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When in fact you hadn't,</v>

385
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:41.750
<v Speaker 2>there was just a cookie that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>embedded,</v>

386
00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:42.380
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

387
00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.850
<v Speaker 2>something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it was,</v>

388
00:17:43.851 --> 00:17:45.410
<v Speaker 2>it was illegal and they wind up going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>jail.</v>

389
00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.200
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even his defense of that,</v>

390
00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:49.680
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something wrong there.</v>

391
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

392
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.350
<v Speaker 1>don't know what that something is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there's a,</v>

393
00:17:52.351 --> 00:17:54.870
<v Speaker 1>there's a spark plug that's not screwed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all the way.</v>

394
00:17:54.871 --> 00:17:55.920
<v Speaker 1>There's something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

395
00:17:55.921 --> 00:18:00.921
<v Speaker 1>speaking of a fake personas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's the worst when it</v>

396
00:18:01.231 --> 00:18:05.820
<v Speaker 1>comes to politics and I do feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's very,</v>

397
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:06.331
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

398
00:18:06.331 --> 00:18:08.580
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few upsides of trump in my opinion.</v>

399
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.660
<v Speaker 1>But one of the upsides of trump is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did kind of break the mold in terms</v>

400
00:18:12.661 --> 00:18:14.850
<v Speaker 1>of what was viewed as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

401
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.190
<v Speaker 1>the right way to communicate as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>politician.</v>

402
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Because before him you had all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>very measured people who had the proper</v>

403
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.300
<v Speaker 1>posture and they spoke with their thumb</v>
<v Speaker 1>pointing down because they don't want to</v>

404
00:18:24.301 --> 00:18:28.820
<v Speaker 1>be strong with their finger pointing at</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like that fist.</v>

405
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.620
<v Speaker 1>And then he comes along and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously shooting from the hip and he</v>

406
00:18:31.621 --> 00:18:35.310
<v Speaker 1>clearly has no filter and he's tripping</v>
<v Speaker 1>over his words a tremendous,</v>

407
00:18:35.311 --> 00:18:37.980
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's unnecessarily punchy and short with</v>

408
00:18:37.981 --> 00:18:38.814
<v Speaker 1>his sentences.</v>

409
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.540
<v Speaker 1>And I remember there was a report that</v>
<v Speaker 1>came out that said he communicates,</v>

410
00:18:42.541 --> 00:18:45.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like a sixth or seventh</v>
<v Speaker 1>grade level or something like that and</v>

411
00:18:45.181 --> 00:18:48.840
<v Speaker 1>everybody in the media was mocking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did a segment where I said you</v>

412
00:18:48.841 --> 00:18:51.360
<v Speaker 1>guys are mocking and that's a terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea because guess what?</v>

413
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.090
<v Speaker 1>The way he speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it sounds stupid,</v>

414
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.060
<v Speaker 1>it's going to pierce through like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how when some people talk it's</v>

415
00:18:57.061 --> 00:18:59.310
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to focus to pay attention to</v>

416
00:18:59.311 --> 00:19:01.290
<v Speaker 1>listen to where they're going with it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's hard.</v>

417
00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.780
<v Speaker 1>And then there's other people who talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like you just,</v>

418
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.330
<v Speaker 1>you just get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's immediately right in your brain and</v>

419
00:19:06.331 --> 00:19:08.340
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agree or disagree with the substance of</v>

420
00:19:08.341 --> 00:19:09.900
<v Speaker 1>what that person is saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

421
00:19:09.901 --> 00:19:11.640
<v Speaker 1>when somebody is an effective</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicator.</v>

422
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:16.020
<v Speaker 1>And when he was at out there on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign trail and he was,</v>

423
00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:18.090
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaigning in the rust belt where</v>

424
00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton did not go right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

425
00:19:20.641 --> 00:19:21.570
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nafta enough,</v>

426
00:19:21.571 --> 00:19:23.250
<v Speaker 1>just terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shipped out all your jobs.</v>

427
00:19:23.251 --> 00:19:25.140
<v Speaker 1>It was unbelievably terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe me,</v>

428
00:19:25.141 --> 00:19:26.340
<v Speaker 1>let me just tell you what I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

429
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to keep your jobs here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be unbelievable.</v>

430
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>

431
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:30.651
<v Speaker 1>I'd say it is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

432
00:19:30.651 --> 00:19:32.490
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty good trump people tell me a</v>

433
00:19:32.491 --> 00:19:33.560
<v Speaker 1>little off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the matter is,</v>

434
00:19:33.561 --> 00:19:34.394
<v Speaker 1>these are excellent.</v>

435
00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.780
<v Speaker 1>So the fucking thing he did recently</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he said that he had gone into the</v>

436
00:19:39.781 --> 00:19:43.170
<v Speaker 1>school when the school shooting was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in their unit who didn't have a</v>

437
00:19:43.171 --> 00:19:44.020
<v Speaker 1>gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

438
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:48.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like we mentioned any other setting</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't.</v>

439
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.770
<v Speaker 1>I was with him when he was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to cops should have gone in</v>

440
00:19:50.771 --> 00:19:51.391
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

441
00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:52.740
<v Speaker 1>of course the cops had gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

442
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.470
<v Speaker 1>But then he has to gratuitously take it</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much further.</v>

443
00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:58.080
<v Speaker 1>Then he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have gone in and then he adds</v>

444
00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:01.200
<v Speaker 1>without a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like now everybody knows you're just</v>

445
00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:02.790
<v Speaker 1>full of shit and manage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he was there,</v>

446
00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.530
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine if he was there,</v>

447
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.010
<v Speaker 1>like if trump just happened to be there</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving a speech at the school in a</v>

448
00:20:08.011 --> 00:20:11.790
<v Speaker 1>school shooting started and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't do anything.</v>

449
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.480
<v Speaker 1>He just stood on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know he would have a guarantee.</v>

450
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy who said,</v>

451
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.310
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my personal Vietnam was avoiding stds at</v>

452
00:20:20.311 --> 00:20:23.580
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible] I went to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty funny.</v>

453
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was,</v>

454
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:27.900
<v Speaker 1>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a scene in,</v>

455
00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dead zone.</v>

456
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see the dead zone wells in the</v>

457
00:20:33.331 --> 00:20:34.920
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

458
00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:41.150
<v Speaker 1>the guy uses someone to shield him from</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shooter and that's what keeps that guy</v>

459
00:20:41.971 --> 00:20:44.820
<v Speaker 1>from ever becoming president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it keeps him from pressing the button</v>

460
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 1>because the guy was going to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>president and he was going to launch a</v>

461
00:20:47.981 --> 00:20:49.350
<v Speaker 1>nuclear war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

462
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:53.290
<v Speaker 1>assault and nuclear war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this guy that,</v>

463
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was Christopher walken's.</v>

464
00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Kay was Christopher Walken was right</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

465
00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:01.180
<v Speaker 1>So he realized by touching this guy's</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>

466
00:21:01.181 --> 00:21:04.570
<v Speaker 1>this guy was going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there was some scenario took</v>

467
00:21:04.571 --> 00:21:08.140
<v Speaker 1>place where someone was trying to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and he used someone else to shield</v>

468
00:21:08.141 --> 00:21:11.650
<v Speaker 1>him from the bullet and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevented him from ever becoming</v>

469
00:21:11.651 --> 00:21:12.330
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

470
00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:13.700
<v Speaker 1>And what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a movie that dead zone.</v>

471
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a movie and it's also a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was also a book by Stephen King.</v>

472
00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to read the book and I saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie.</v>

473
00:21:20.561 --> 00:21:22.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it walking?</v>

474
00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

475
00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.570
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

476
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Young walking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that handsome face bastard.</v>

477
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.730
<v Speaker 1>It was a weird looking dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does,</v>

478
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.530
<v Speaker 1>where does it gets?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what's cool about them.</v>

479
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.070
<v Speaker 1>It's great movie though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fun Mate might not be great anymore.</v>

480
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.260
<v Speaker 1>It might be one of those movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I always told people we should</v>

481
00:21:38.261 --> 00:21:39.610
<v Speaker 1>watch altered states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

482
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.160
<v Speaker 1>And then I watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain things age so bad.</v>

483
00:21:42.161 --> 00:21:43.510
<v Speaker 1>We were just talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

484
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but especially with comedy and you've</v>

485
00:21:46.061 --> 00:21:48.130
<v Speaker 1>pointed this out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go back and look at old comedy,</v>

486
00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.530
<v Speaker 1>it's just a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were living,</v>

487
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.790
<v Speaker 1>standup and exactly you.</v>

488
00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:56.080
<v Speaker 1>If you take the conversation we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>having and you like somehow get it back</v>

489
00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:59.230
<v Speaker 1>to 1950,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will look at us like just the</v>

490
00:21:59.231 --> 00:22:01.230
<v Speaker 1>fact that we casually curse and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

491
00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.310
<v Speaker 1>the concepts we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>

492
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.860
<v Speaker 1>this is unbelievably impolite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

493
00:22:05.861 --> 00:22:07.120
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

494
00:22:07.121 --> 00:22:12.070
<v Speaker 1>one of the best examples I think is</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Colbert saying that president</v>

495
00:22:12.071 --> 00:22:14.500
<v Speaker 1>trump uses his mouth is Putin's cock</v>
<v Speaker 1>holster.</v>

496
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Just set it on whatever network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tv or cable,</v>

497
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.810
<v Speaker 1>whatever the Johnny Carson do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

498
00:22:19.811 --> 00:22:22.390
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go back to the old Ed Sullivan show.</v>

499
00:22:22.391 --> 00:22:27.391
<v Speaker 1>You know where Jackie Mason got banned</v>
<v Speaker 1>for life because it looked like he gave</v>

500
00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:29.370
<v Speaker 1>the finger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did this thing right?</v>

501
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.570
<v Speaker 1>Like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I do.</v>

502
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm Jackie Mason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says he never even gave him the</v>

503
00:22:34.451 --> 00:22:37.060
<v Speaker 1>finger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was accused of giving someone the</v>

504
00:22:37.061 --> 00:22:39.250
<v Speaker 1>finger and that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was banned.</v>

505
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Didn't they do that with Elvis when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>performed?</v>

506
00:22:41.701 --> 00:22:44.350
<v Speaker 1>He like moved his hips in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought was too sexual.</v>

507
00:22:44.351 --> 00:22:45.820
<v Speaker 1>So they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't show this because there are</v>

508
00:22:45.821 --> 00:22:47.140
<v Speaker 1>kids that exist in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

509
00:22:47.141 --> 00:22:49.120
<v Speaker 1>they would only frame him from the waist</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

510
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:51.450
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't show all that thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>motion.</v>

511
00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.950
<v Speaker 1>It was too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck on what Elvis.</v>

512
00:22:53.951 --> 00:22:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so goofy.</v>

513
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't get what it is about</v>
<v Speaker 1>different times.</v>

514
00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:01.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were just a few generations</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from the powdered wigs.</v>

515
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean really that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's such a different world.</v>

516
00:23:04.601 --> 00:23:06.700
<v Speaker 1>I can't wrap my mind around it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

517
00:23:06.701 --> 00:23:08.520
<v Speaker 1>It's true that I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Was it?</v>

518
00:23:08.521 --> 00:23:11.650
<v Speaker 1>I think it was lenny bruce who had all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these different lawsuits against him</v>

519
00:23:11.651 --> 00:23:16.651
<v Speaker 1>because so in a way he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he kind of paved the way for people like</v>

520
00:23:17.051 --> 00:23:19.750
<v Speaker 1>us where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because you're in comedy too,</v>

521
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.670
<v Speaker 1>but even just for the Internet where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have this,</v>

522
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:24.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this free open platform where we talk</v>

523
00:23:24.941 --> 00:23:27.460
<v Speaker 1>about whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we wouldn't even be able to</v>

524
00:23:27.461 --> 00:23:28.820
<v Speaker 1>get away with talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

525
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:32.200
<v Speaker 1>mentioning the sexual stuff or cursing</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it wasn't for guys like that who</v>

526
00:23:32.201 --> 00:23:36.220
<v Speaker 1>paved the way because people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting arrested for doing a standup set</v>

527
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.640
<v Speaker 1>and cursing 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a bunch of framed lenny bruce</v>

528
00:23:39.641 --> 00:23:41.230
<v Speaker 1>posters in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

529
00:23:41.231 --> 00:23:42.330
<v Speaker 1>I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

530
00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 1>is one of the most important figures in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of pop culture because he,</v>

531
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.710
<v Speaker 2>he was a way ahead of his time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

532
00:23:48.711 --> 00:23:49.970
<v Speaker 2>just way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way ahead of his time.</v>

533
00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:54.971
<v Speaker 2>He had jokes back then that I saw people</v>
<v Speaker 2>stealing in the 19 eighties.</v>

534
00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.500
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if they were stealing</v>

535
00:23:57.501 --> 00:23:59.000
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rephrase that.</v>

536
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.970
<v Speaker 2>I think they might've had parallel</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

537
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:07.240
<v Speaker 2>One of the jokes was about gay people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in certain places being gay and</v>

538
00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:10.880
<v Speaker 2>like sodomy is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think sodomy is still technically</v>

539
00:24:10.881 --> 00:24:13.010
<v Speaker 2>illegal in some places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some states I think.</v>

540
00:24:13.011 --> 00:24:14.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hippy or some shit,</v>

541
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.670
<v Speaker 2>which includes going down on somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>

542
00:24:16.671 --> 00:24:19.070
<v Speaker 2>No blow jobs are technically illegal in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some states.</v>

543
00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.860
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

544
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.500
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was my point that.</v>

545
00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so his joke was that he was dig this</v>

546
00:24:28.221 --> 00:24:29.930
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're gay,</v>

547
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:30.950
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

548
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:34.760
<v Speaker 2>they put you in jail with a bunch of men</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have sex with you.</v>

549
00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:41.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a joke that can last.</v>

550
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.910
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would work today.</v>

551
00:24:43.911 --> 00:24:47.650
<v Speaker 2>If nobody figured that out today and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't exist in,</v>

552
00:24:47.651 --> 00:24:49.800
<v Speaker 2>somebody just said that on stage today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

553
00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.910
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of those though that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like they don't realize it's been</v>

554
00:24:52.911 --> 00:24:55.520
<v Speaker 2>said before because it just seems like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happens.</v>

555
00:24:55.521 --> 00:24:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even in what I do,</v>

556
00:24:56.871 --> 00:25:00.350
<v Speaker 2>political commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll make points and it'll be a point</v>

557
00:25:00.351 --> 00:25:03.560
<v Speaker 2>that eight people made before me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm some fucking genius over</v>

558
00:25:03.561 --> 00:25:05.130
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unavoidable.</v>

559
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Especially with like obvious points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I started out in Boston doing</v>

560
00:25:09.381 --> 00:25:12.050
<v Speaker 2>stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're obviously right next to New</v>

561
00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:15.800
<v Speaker 2>Hampshire and New Hampshire's state</v>
<v Speaker 2>motto on their license plate is live</v>

562
00:25:15.801 --> 00:25:17.780
<v Speaker 2>free or die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

563
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those plates are made by prisoners.</v>

564
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.380
<v Speaker 2>How fucked up is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sure it is.</v>

565
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.770
<v Speaker 2>I am absolutely positive.</v>

566
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Other people thought that up as well</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's always been a thing,</v>

567
00:25:27.561 --> 00:25:29.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people would make fun of.</v>

568
00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:33.500
<v Speaker 2>Prisoners would make license plates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was like a see in movies.</v>

569
00:25:33.501 --> 00:25:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go make license plates.</v>

570
00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:37.110
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

571
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:38.840
<v Speaker 2>they put the cuffs on him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

572
00:25:38.841 --> 00:25:40.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you'll be making license plates like</v>

573
00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:45.880
<v Speaker 2>for some reason like being in prison was</v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with making license plates</v>

574
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:49.190
<v Speaker 2>there and there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because you brought up prisons,</v>

575
00:25:49.191 --> 00:25:52.400
<v Speaker 2>there's a pivot here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's some creepy stuff going on</v>

576
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.250
<v Speaker 2>in terms of the Labor that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting from prisoners.</v>

577
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.941
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

578
00:25:55.941 --> 00:25:58.460
<v Speaker 2>We were just talking about that with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fires that they were paying.</v>

579
00:25:58.461 --> 00:26:02.600
<v Speaker 2>Those guys got a dollar a day to risk</v>
<v Speaker 2>their life in the Santa Barbara fires.</v>

580
00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:06.920
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How was that allowed hate maybe give me</v>

581
00:26:06.921 --> 00:26:08.420
<v Speaker 2>a month off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

582
00:26:08.421 --> 00:26:10.070
<v Speaker 2>or a year off or whatever.</v>

583
00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe if you did,</v>

584
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.700
<v Speaker 2>you're not a dangerous criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe did something stupid,</v>

585
00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some petty theft or something like that</v>

586
00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.620
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

587
00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.990
<v Speaker 2>I'll go out there and fuck the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you gotta you gotta give me some</v>

588
00:26:20.991 --> 00:26:22.940
<v Speaker 2>sort of a break off my sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

589
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.610
<v Speaker 2>We're going to give you a dollar a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they make them do it and then they</v>

590
00:26:25.611 --> 00:26:28.880
<v Speaker 2>still had the normal sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't even reduce it or anything.</v>

591
00:26:28.881 --> 00:26:30.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I did.</v>

592
00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure good behavior,</v>

593
00:26:32.541 --> 00:26:35.450
<v Speaker 2>reducing sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that probably does something,</v>

594
00:26:35.451 --> 00:26:38.350
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that they could pay you a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar a day to fight a fire.</v>

595
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.990
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking crazy or a dollar an hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever the fuck the actual number</v>

596
00:26:41.991 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way we do prisons in general</v>

597
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.980
<v Speaker 1>in the US is really weird because I feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's like the Norwegian way of</v>

598
00:26:49.801 --> 00:26:52.650
<v Speaker 1>doing stuff and the Scandinavian way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing stuff where they gear everything</v>

599
00:26:52.651 --> 00:26:55.980
<v Speaker 1>towards rehabilitation to get them back</v>
<v Speaker 1>into society and functioning.</v>

600
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the US I feel like we don't gear</v>

601
00:26:58.281 --> 00:27:00.780
<v Speaker 1>it towards rehabilitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We gear it towards punishment.</v>

602
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.650
<v Speaker 1>We're going to punish you and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

603
00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:06.390
<v Speaker 1>I think you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are fair critiques of the</v>

604
00:27:06.391 --> 00:27:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian system like in Scandinavia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

605
00:27:09.711 --> 00:27:10.800
<v Speaker 1>who's The guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andrews Brevig,</v>

606
00:27:10.801 --> 00:27:13.020
<v Speaker 1>he killed all these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone that was complaining because he's</v>

607
00:27:13.021 --> 00:27:15.240
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only have a ps two and you guys need</v>

608
00:27:15.241 --> 00:27:18.600
<v Speaker 1>to give me like a newer video game</v>
<v Speaker 1>system so you can look at that and go,</v>

609
00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.730
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are being too fucking liberal.</v>

610
00:27:20.731 --> 00:27:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had like two rooms that were his cell</v>

611
00:27:23.231 --> 00:27:24.990
<v Speaker 1>and he could walk into fucking court</v>
<v Speaker 1>yard and shit.</v>

612
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:27.300
<v Speaker 1>So I think there are genuine criticisms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

613
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:32.460
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time what's fascinating</v>
<v Speaker 1>is they have a significantly lower</v>

614
00:27:32.461 --> 00:27:35.400
<v Speaker 1>recidivism rate than we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>

615
00:27:35.401 --> 00:27:38.010
<v Speaker 1>if you go to prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very likely that you're going to</v>

616
00:27:38.011 --> 00:27:41.070
<v Speaker 1>end up back in prison in those places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to prison,</v>

617
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's like a lower level</v>

618
00:27:42.751 --> 00:27:44.510
<v Speaker 1>crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they rehabilitate you and you get out</v>

619
00:27:44.511 --> 00:27:47.970
<v Speaker 1>and you're a functioning member of</v>
<v Speaker 1>society so we can learn something from</v>

620
00:27:47.971 --> 00:27:48.751
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my mind,</v>

621
00:27:48.751 --> 00:27:52.380
<v Speaker 1>I think there should be some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle ground like I think prison should</v>

622
00:27:52.381 --> 00:27:53.191
<v Speaker 1>be used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

623
00:27:53.191 --> 00:27:56.430
<v Speaker 1>In some instances people need fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment in some instances of course,</v>

624
00:27:56.790 --> 00:28:00.030
<v Speaker 1>but we need to mix that in many</v>
<v Speaker 1>instances with a healthy dose of</v>

625
00:28:00.031 --> 00:28:02.370
<v Speaker 1>rehabilitation as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we are our,</v>

626
00:28:02.371 --> 00:28:04.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>functioning like an actual society as</v>

627
00:28:04.471 --> 00:28:08.100
<v Speaker 1>opposed to jailing more people in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country than any other country in the</v>

628
00:28:08.101 --> 00:28:08.760
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

629
00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment by itself helps anybody.</v>

630
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take a gun and you lock them in a</v>

631
00:28:14.401 --> 00:28:17.850
<v Speaker 1>cell and he's in that little tiny cell</v>
<v Speaker 1>until his body stops working and he</v>

632
00:28:17.851 --> 00:28:19.680
<v Speaker 1>dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that helping anybody?</v>

633
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is that helping?</v>

634
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:23.220
<v Speaker 1>So are there some city?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

635
00:28:23.221 --> 00:28:27.150
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there are some situations</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I get the idea of like life in</v>

636
00:28:27.151 --> 00:28:28.940
<v Speaker 1>prison without the possibility for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

637
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:33.360
<v Speaker 1>I get it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean why look at a Ted Bundy</v>

638
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.250
<v Speaker 1>character or some something along those</v>
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>

639
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Just indefensible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

640
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Some serial killer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a psychopath.</v>

641
00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:42.420
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking kill him.</v>

642
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Just going to ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel about the death penalty,</v>

643
00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:47.060
<v Speaker 1>but now I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kill him.</v>

644
00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Just come on Mandy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not enough time in the world to</v>

645
00:28:49.711 --> 00:28:54.711
<v Speaker 1>fix a Ed gain your or who was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking clown?</v>

646
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:59.040
<v Speaker 1>William Casey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The clown guy who killed all those kids</v>

647
00:28:59.041 --> 00:29:00.570
<v Speaker 1>and burden in his backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

648
00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.180
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that Cleveland</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in Ohio.</v>

649
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:03.810
<v Speaker 1>So your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

650
00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:06.180
<v Speaker 1>your place buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some people who are just.</v>

651
00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:08.580
<v Speaker 1>The point you're making is there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people who are too far gone.</v>

652
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.900
<v Speaker 1>When I say you're a place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking to you,</v>

653
00:29:09.901 --> 00:29:11.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to Jamie for people just</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening,</v>

654
00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:14.140
<v Speaker 1>like why is he fucking with Kyle and</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying he's involved with the cloud.</v>

655
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:17.100
<v Speaker 1>It's just to know I might not have even</v>
<v Speaker 1>been Ohio,</v>

656
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:19.740
<v Speaker 1>might've been pittsburgh somewhere dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cloudy.</v>

657
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:24.060
<v Speaker 1>So the point you're making is that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are people who are too far gone and,</v>

658
00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:25.950
<v Speaker 1>and I agree with that a hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

659
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:30.300
<v Speaker 1>But my whole thing on the death penalty</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I've always thought the idea of it in</v>

660
00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:33.120
<v Speaker 1>principle is something I get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could point out all those</v>

661
00:29:33.121 --> 00:29:35.910
<v Speaker 1>people who did those horrific things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's no hope of them</v>

662
00:29:35.911 --> 00:29:38.100
<v Speaker 1>rehabilitating their total monsters.</v>

663
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.650
<v Speaker 1>And I say philosophically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no problem getting rid of those</v>

664
00:29:41.651 --> 00:29:43.480
<v Speaker 1>people because you're just eliminating a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

665
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:46.570
<v Speaker 1>But in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why I'm not in favor of the</v>

666
00:29:46.571 --> 00:29:49.810
<v Speaker 1>death penalty is because four percent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time we get the wrong people.</v>

667
00:29:49.811 --> 00:29:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a system where you're</v>

668
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:55.760
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed to kill the wrong people some</v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of the time,</v>

669
00:29:55.761 --> 00:29:57.380
<v Speaker 1>then what we're saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

670
00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.680
<v Speaker 1>we're going to let the state murder</v>
<v Speaker 1>people for percent of the time and</v>

671
00:29:59.681 --> 00:30:01.930
<v Speaker 1>that's something that I just can't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>my tax dollars going towards.</v>

672
00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.250
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean with you 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>

673
00:30:03.251 --> 00:30:06.250
<v Speaker 1>but is it any better to have those</v>
<v Speaker 1>people locked up in a cage for the rest</v>

674
00:30:06.251 --> 00:30:07.900
<v Speaker 1>of their life until their body stops</v>
<v Speaker 1>working?</v>

675
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the idea is if you have them</v>

676
00:30:10.811 --> 00:30:14.590
<v Speaker 1>locked up and you have people at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>innocence project working on trying to</v>

677
00:30:14.591 --> 00:30:18.460
<v Speaker 1>overturn cases where there was a wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>conviction that eventually you can write</v>

678
00:30:18.461 --> 00:30:22.030
<v Speaker 1>the wrong of getting those wrong people</v>
<v Speaker 1>four percent of the time,</v>

679
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's finite.</v>

680
00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:24.420
<v Speaker 1>If you say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to,</v>

681
00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:27.280
<v Speaker 1>we're going to put you on on death row</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to die in eight years,</v>

682
00:30:27.281 --> 00:30:30.430
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then sometimes you can't finish the case</v>

683
00:30:30.431 --> 00:30:33.700
<v Speaker 1>in time to overturn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's my whole thing about the</v>

684
00:30:33.701 --> 00:30:34.534
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

685
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.150
<v Speaker 1>I agree philosophically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's something many people to my</v>

686
00:30:37.151 --> 00:30:39.190
<v Speaker 1>left have come after me for and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

687
00:30:39.191 --> 00:30:41.440
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be against the death penalty</v>

688
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.120
<v Speaker 1>in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I say,</v>

689
00:30:43.121 --> 00:30:44.770
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it theoretically and</v>

690
00:30:44.771 --> 00:30:47.440
<v Speaker 1>philosophically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just that when you actually</v>

691
00:30:47.441 --> 00:30:49.630
<v Speaker 1>implement it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are pragmatic problems like,</v>

692
00:30:49.631 --> 00:30:52.000
<v Speaker 1>you're going to kill the wrong fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and I'm not okay with that.</v>

693
00:30:52.001 --> 00:30:54.580
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's better to kill the</v>

694
00:30:54.581 --> 00:30:57.790
<v Speaker 1>wrong people or to keep the wrong people</v>
<v Speaker 1>locked in a cage suffering for the rest</v>

695
00:30:57.791 --> 00:30:58.210
<v Speaker 1>of their life.</v>

696
00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Who were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where did a William Casey live?</v>

697
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.530
<v Speaker 1>John Wayne gacy was on Wayne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>

698
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His middle name was Wayne.</v>

699
00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:06.550
<v Speaker 1>John Wayne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Wayne gacy.</v>

700
00:31:06.551 --> 00:31:10.250
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that was William Gacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking William Mason,</v>

701
00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.790
<v Speaker 1>the guy from shameless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all fucked up.</v>

702
00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

703
00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:18.310
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about something before</v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcast and I think,</v>

704
00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:20.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

705
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:22.450
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is really the future,</v>

706
00:31:22.451 --> 00:31:24.910
<v Speaker 1>whether it's in our lifetimes or our</v>
<v Speaker 1>children's lifetimes,</v>

707
00:31:24.911 --> 00:31:28.120
<v Speaker 1>but I think that they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to read minds and I think it's not,</v>

708
00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.060
<v Speaker 1>we're not far away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to really be able to know</v>

709
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:34.630
<v Speaker 1>the actual contents of your thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you really did murder a</v>

710
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:36.340
<v Speaker 1>bunch of kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>burry them in your backyard.</v>

711
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.180
<v Speaker 1>We're going to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And until then we're dealing with a</v>

712
00:31:40.181 --> 00:31:45.010
<v Speaker 1>bunch of really big fucking problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the biggest problems is people's</v>

713
00:31:45.011 --> 00:31:48.220
<v Speaker 1>memories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People's memories are so bad.</v>

714
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.490
<v Speaker 1>They're so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you have eyewitness testimony</v>

715
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:55.750
<v Speaker 1>and you can convict people wrongly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which happens every day,</v>

716
00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.540
<v Speaker 1>and they think they're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think they,</v>

717
00:31:58.541 --> 00:32:01.150
<v Speaker 1>they really do believe they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

718
00:32:01.151 --> 00:32:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking problem,</v>

719
00:32:03.221 --> 00:32:06.190
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just a giant problem is the human</v>

720
00:32:06.191 --> 00:32:11.050
<v Speaker 1>memory is incredibly flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when someone's life is on the line</v>

721
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.410
<v Speaker 1>and you know you're going to convict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who didn't do anything,</v>

722
00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:18.040
<v Speaker 1>he just looks kind of like what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember this person who murdered that</v>

723
00:32:18.041 --> 00:32:19.390
<v Speaker 1>guy looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

724
00:32:19.391 --> 00:32:22.090
<v Speaker 1>that's where a lot of the things get</v>
<v Speaker 1>overturned is because they had dna</v>

725
00:32:22.091 --> 00:32:25.510
<v Speaker 1>evidence that overrides whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 1>testimony was that the people at the</v>

726
00:32:25.511 --> 00:32:28.050
<v Speaker 1>time and speaking of technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>advancing it,</v>

727
00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:30.490
<v Speaker 1>there's many scary aspects to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

728
00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:32.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elephant in the room to me is the</v>

729
00:32:32.591 --> 00:32:34.810
<v Speaker 1>fact that look at what the NSA is</v>
<v Speaker 1>already doing.</v>

730
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:37.510
<v Speaker 1>They're already spying on absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody in the country.</v>

731
00:32:37.511 --> 00:32:39.120
<v Speaker 1>They collect all of our metadata and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stored.</v>

732
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a multibillion dollar facility in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Utah.</v>

733
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.820
<v Speaker 1>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt that all this</v>

734
00:32:43.821 --> 00:32:45.920
<v Speaker 1>technology is going to be used against</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

735
00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.360
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

736
00:32:47.361 --> 00:32:52.190
<v Speaker 1>it certainly can be if they choose to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you become a guy like a,</v>

737
00:32:52.191 --> 00:32:52.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

738
00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:57.470
<v Speaker 1>like Julian songs or who leaks something</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they go,</v>

739
00:32:57.471 --> 00:33:00.020
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go pull up Kyle's a text message</v>

740
00:33:00.021 --> 00:33:01.580
<v Speaker 1>records.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>

741
00:33:01.581 --> 00:33:05.690
<v Speaker 1>he looks crossdressing fucking people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouths.</v>

742
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:07.160
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is.</v>

743
00:33:07.161 --> 00:33:07.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

744
00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:12.890
<v Speaker 1>they can and then they could leak that</v>
<v Speaker 1>to whatever media people that they're in</v>

745
00:33:13.011 --> 00:33:15.200
<v Speaker 1>bed width.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just a lot of shit that they can</v>

746
00:33:15.201 --> 00:33:16.011
<v Speaker 1>get away with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

747
00:33:16.011 --> 00:33:19.370
<v Speaker 1>that's partially what they did with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eliot Spitzer because Elliot Spitzer,</v>

748
00:33:19.371 --> 00:33:22.530
<v Speaker 1>they called them the sheriff of Wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>Street because crack down on Wall Street</v>

749
00:33:22.531 --> 00:33:23.361
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oops,</v>

750
00:33:23.361 --> 00:33:23.990
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

751
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.960
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his credit card information from the</v>

752
00:33:26.961 --> 00:33:30.590
<v Speaker 1>brothel he went to was leaked to a press</v>
<v Speaker 1>outlet.</v>

753
00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:32.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck did you get the credit card</v>

754
00:33:32.181 --> 00:33:34.160
<v Speaker 1>information?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they knew what they were looking</v>

755
00:33:34.161 --> 00:33:37.940
<v Speaker 1>for because they were trying to bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>him down that he was actually going</v>

756
00:33:37.941 --> 00:33:40.340
<v Speaker 1>after brothel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was going to say and I</v>

757
00:33:40.341 --> 00:33:43.700
<v Speaker 1>think it was his hypocrisy that brought</v>
<v Speaker 1>him down and not the fact that he went</v>

758
00:33:43.701 --> 00:33:46.100
<v Speaker 1>to a brothel stay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're cracking down on brothels and</v>

759
00:33:46.101 --> 00:33:48.560
<v Speaker 1>going into brothels at the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just arresting people.</v>

760
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was fucked up.</v>

761
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.010
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if like.</v>

762
00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make any sense that he</v>

763
00:33:54.291 --> 00:33:55.580
<v Speaker 1>thought that he could get away with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

764
00:33:55.581 --> 00:34:00.110
<v Speaker 1>but the real problem with that guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy was an interesting politician.</v>

765
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.470
<v Speaker 1>He really did have some really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>points,</v>

766
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:07.940
<v Speaker 1>a lot like a wiener was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting in that way too.</v>

767
00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.100
<v Speaker 1>He had some really good points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great speaker,</v>

768
00:34:10.101 --> 00:34:12.620
<v Speaker 1>but he was also free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the documentary on him?</v>

769
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.300
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

770
00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.190
<v Speaker 1>will you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't finish it though.</v>

771
00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:18.410
<v Speaker 1>I've watched part of it and then I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>got bored.</v>

772
00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean you want to talk about a fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>from grace.</v>

773
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:22.790
<v Speaker 1>He was somebody who was viewed as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

774
00:34:22.791 --> 00:34:26.840
<v Speaker 1>there's fire breather on the left who</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes after people and doesn't take any</v>

775
00:34:26.841 --> 00:34:29.060
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then fast forward and it's like,</v>

776
00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.710
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got caught,</v>

777
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:33.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sending Dick Pics to like 80,000 women.</v>

778
00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Some of them under age and I feel so bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>for his wife sending Dick Pics while he</v>

779
00:34:39.201 --> 00:34:44.201
<v Speaker 1>was holding his kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his kid sending pictures of him with his</v>

780
00:34:45.261 --> 00:34:48.890
<v Speaker 1>kid and his arms and his boner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those scandals where it's</v>

781
00:34:48.891 --> 00:34:49.700
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

782
00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:50.810
<v Speaker 1>you're not coming back for that.</v>

783
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck off.</v>

784
00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:54.500
<v Speaker 1>This is what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said on the podcast,</v>

785
00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.570
<v Speaker 1>and I'm saying right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's in jail right now.</v>

786
00:34:56.571 --> 00:34:57.404
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he in jail?</v>

787
00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.900
<v Speaker 1>He's in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you go into jail,</v>

788
00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Andrew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a comic.</v>

789
00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.950
<v Speaker 1>You just don't know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't know it.</v>

790
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:07.550
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee he's a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just never did it and he just went</v>

791
00:35:07.551 --> 00:35:09.920
<v Speaker 1>into politics and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a real good speaker.</v>

792
00:35:09.921 --> 00:35:12.020
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of a funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

793
00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.530
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to talk to you about comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really did because.</v>

794
00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.440
<v Speaker 1>So I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

795
00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:23.690
<v Speaker 1>I've done a few live things in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a live show once and then,</v>

796
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:27.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also did a best man speeches in</v>

797
00:35:27.351 --> 00:35:28.370
<v Speaker 1>front of rooms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

798
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:31.460
<v Speaker 1>over 100 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one best man's speech I did,</v>

799
00:35:31.461 --> 00:35:32.990
<v Speaker 1>I cried like a pitch.</v>

800
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:35.420
<v Speaker 1>It was the saddest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm up there talking about one of my</v>

801
00:35:35.421 --> 00:35:39.380
<v Speaker 1>best friends and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to wrestle on the triple e.</v>

802
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.610
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pathetic.</v>

803
00:35:41.611 --> 00:35:43.970
<v Speaker 1>It was pathetic though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just some emotions you,</v>

804
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.090
<v Speaker 1>you care about the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

805
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:46.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing is that people came up</v>

806
00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:48.810
<v Speaker 1>to me after and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they liked it and they were like,</v>

807
00:35:48.811 --> 00:35:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was great.</v>

808
00:35:49.801 --> 00:35:50.720
<v Speaker 1>It was heartfelt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

809
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:53.670
<v Speaker 1>I barely fucking said a word that</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody can understand cause I was</v>

810
00:35:53.671 --> 00:35:54.504
<v Speaker 1>blubbering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

811
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:57.390
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think there's a real problem that</v>

812
00:35:57.391 --> 00:35:59.530
<v Speaker 1>people have with avoiding emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

813
00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I was too vulnerable in front of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that was a good banner.</v>

814
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:04.680
<v Speaker 1>You're defending me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for that.</v>

815
00:36:04.681 --> 00:36:09.030
<v Speaker 1>But the second best man speech I gave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went into it thinking like,</v>

816
00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:11.640
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna I'm gonna crush a little bit.</v>

817
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.610
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking that a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

818
00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.510
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to,</v>

819
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.240
<v Speaker 1>when I talk I like to have just bullet</v>
<v Speaker 1>points of what I want to talk about and</v>

820
00:36:18.241 --> 00:36:19.800
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a loose outline and then I'll riff</v>

821
00:36:19.801 --> 00:36:23.460
<v Speaker 1>off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happened was all the lines that</v>

822
00:36:23.461 --> 00:36:26.370
<v Speaker 1>I thought would get a laugh did not get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a laugh,</v>

823
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:30.060
<v Speaker 1>but all my throwaway lines got good</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughs.</v>

824
00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:33.930
<v Speaker 1>So I was amazed by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also I was amazed at the</v>

825
00:36:33.931 --> 00:36:38.931
<v Speaker 1>fucking rush of getting a room to hang</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your every word and to genuinely</v>

826
00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:41.980
<v Speaker 1>laugh at what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

827
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.480
<v Speaker 1>And so every time you do stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the feeling you get?</v>

828
00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:48.210
<v Speaker 1>You definitely get a rush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>

829
00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.370
<v Speaker 1>You crush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a rush.</v>

830
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a.</v>

831
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:54.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different rush and different size</v>

832
00:36:54.521 --> 00:36:58.320
<v Speaker 1>places like there's more of a surreal</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing when you get a.</v>

833
00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:01.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an area you get to like around</v>

834
00:37:01.261 --> 00:37:03.750
<v Speaker 1>5,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>6,000 people where it gets real.</v>

835
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.570
<v Speaker 1>It gets real weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

836
00:37:06.571 --> 00:37:09.240
<v Speaker 1>It gets fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gets weird.</v>

837
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Like almost like you are you just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing a show then more than</v>

838
00:37:14.671 --> 00:37:17.220
<v Speaker 1>you're connecting with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to come to the comedy store</v>

839
00:37:17.221 --> 00:37:19.530
<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a intimate place.</v>

840
00:37:19.531 --> 00:37:24.060
<v Speaker 1>That's 150 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's tight little small room and</v>

841
00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:26.820
<v Speaker 1>that's like you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're there with the people.</v>

842
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.490
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a rush too though.</v>

843
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.020
<v Speaker 1>That's a different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different rush.</v>

844
00:37:31.021 --> 00:37:32.550
<v Speaker 1>They're all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all a rush,</v>

845
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:37.730
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>your responsibility to the material and</v>

846
00:37:38.761 --> 00:37:43.761
<v Speaker 1>the delivery sort of overrides the rush</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't really get caught up</v>

847
00:37:44.431 --> 00:37:45.121
<v Speaker 1>in and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

848
00:37:45.121 --> 00:37:49.290
<v Speaker 1>this is amazing because you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the timing.</v>

849
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.110
<v Speaker 1>You have to be tuned into exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about.</v>

850
00:37:52.111 --> 00:37:53.580
<v Speaker 1>You can't be thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

851
00:37:53.581 --> 00:37:55.020
<v Speaker 1>this is getting a lot of great laughs.</v>

852
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:58.380
<v Speaker 1>You have to honestly be thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual subject.</v>

853
00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.690
<v Speaker 1>People fucking know what you're thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

854
00:38:00.691 --> 00:38:01.740
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>

855
00:38:01.741 --> 00:38:02.574
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

856
00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:05.250
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a type of hypnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

857
00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:08.970
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean hypnosis like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tricked the people into doing</v>

858
00:38:08.971 --> 00:38:12.210
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean like you mind meld with the</v>

859
00:38:12.211 --> 00:38:17.211
<v Speaker 1>audience and some sort of a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People know when you're on some sort of</v>

860
00:38:17.341 --> 00:38:21.300
<v Speaker 1>a script and they know when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking from the heart and it's really</v>

861
00:38:21.301 --> 00:38:25.300
<v Speaker 1>strange because you could have somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's well versed in going through a</v>

862
00:38:25.301 --> 00:38:27.390
<v Speaker 1>script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's still something that's</v>

863
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:31.020
<v Speaker 1>missing from what they're saying and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like that's one of the many reasons</v>

864
00:38:31.021 --> 00:38:34.290
<v Speaker 1>why this podcast is very popular because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get people on here and you just have</v>

865
00:38:34.291 --> 00:38:39.291
<v Speaker 1>a conversation and your you are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>connecting and then you're also really</v>

866
00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:41.650
<v Speaker 1>connecting with people who are watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're just having a</v>

867
00:38:41.651 --> 00:38:42.130
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

868
00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:44.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're at a bar and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's just kind of talking and</v>

869
00:38:44.951 --> 00:38:46.480
<v Speaker 1>it's not like people come here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

870
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:50.260
<v Speaker 1>let me now go to my point that I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to make on this and this.</v>

871
00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Because that's when people start to</v>
<v Speaker 1>yawn.</v>

872
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually why I think a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

873
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:58.510
<v Speaker 1>The older shows like you know the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to shit on the late night hosts,</v>

874
00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:01.120
<v Speaker 1>but that's why I feel like that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dying out.</v>

875
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:02.650
<v Speaker 1>And there's this giant rise of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

876
00:39:02.651 --> 00:39:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Because that's all very segmented and</v>
<v Speaker 1>structured and you have to go in and out</v>

877
00:39:06.371 --> 00:39:09.460
<v Speaker 1>real fast and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing human about it.</v>

878
00:39:09.461 --> 00:39:13.300
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like it's celebrities</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you were on this different level</v>

879
00:39:13.301 --> 00:39:17.530
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to watch us be on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>different level as opposed to just being</v>

880
00:39:17.531 --> 00:39:19.660
<v Speaker 1>a regular person and they like work with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg.</v>

881
00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

882
00:39:20.741 --> 00:39:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Steven is a amazing director.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

883
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:28.810
<v Speaker 1>it's just so huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also you would be like the talk show</v>

884
00:39:28.811 --> 00:39:30.580
<v Speaker 1>host,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you'd be sitting there and I'd be</v>

885
00:39:30.581 --> 00:39:31.120
<v Speaker 1>sitting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

886
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:31.953
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

887
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Which is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd be turning sideways facing him.</v>

888
00:39:35.421 --> 00:39:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's so it's so follow leader</v>
<v Speaker 1>copycat because this is just the way</v>

889
00:39:39.761 --> 00:39:43.180
<v Speaker 1>they did it with Jack Paar right back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking 18 hundreds,</v>

890
00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:44.400
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

891
00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:48.550
<v Speaker 1>And they go from there to Jimmy Kimmel</v>
<v Speaker 1>who does it the same way and then the</v>

892
00:39:48.551 --> 00:39:50.290
<v Speaker 1>first time somebody breaks the fuck and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mold.</v>

893
00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:51.820
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

894
00:39:51.821 --> 00:39:52.770
<v Speaker 1>This is brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

895
00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.730
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't we doing more of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This makes sense.</v>

896
00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could kind of do this conversation</v>

897
00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:58.740
<v Speaker 1>in front of a large group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

898
00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:02.860
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people do do live podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's a little different</v>

899
00:40:02.861 --> 00:40:03.390
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

900
00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:05.980
<v Speaker 1>We're in the field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like that too because I don't know.</v>

901
00:40:05.981 --> 00:40:10.220
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's an energy that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get from the audience where you kind of</v>

902
00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:15.240
<v Speaker 1>try more to do those punchy one liners</v>
<v Speaker 1>on postage is flowing 100 percent.</v>

903
00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

904
00:40:16.181 --> 00:40:19.450
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've done some live ones before</v>

905
00:40:19.451 --> 00:40:22.510
<v Speaker 1>with friends and it's great and we did</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the world podcast.</v>

906
00:40:22.511 --> 00:40:27.511
<v Speaker 1>We did a live podcast from the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>store at the night of the election and</v>

907
00:40:28.091 --> 00:40:29.890
<v Speaker 1>during the election we realized that</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>

908
00:40:29.891 --> 00:40:32.680
<v Speaker 1>we saying it's the end of the world no</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter who wins because you're writing,</v>

909
00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:36.820
<v Speaker 1>but when trump won,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean bill burr was just on fire in</v>

910
00:40:36.821 --> 00:40:38.630
<v Speaker 1>front of this fucking that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smart man,</v>

911
00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.840
<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just smart,</v>

912
00:40:40.841 --> 00:40:45.841
<v Speaker 1>but that he had material about this that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just perfect and it just was</v>

913
00:40:46.991 --> 00:40:51.370
<v Speaker 1>crushing and there was a panel of six</v>
<v Speaker 1>other comics were all just laughing and</v>

914
00:40:51.371 --> 00:40:51.640
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>

915
00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Shit though is a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it worked.</v>

916
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:55.900
<v Speaker 1>That work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the rare times that work,</v>

917
00:40:55.901 --> 00:41:00.760
<v Speaker 1>but the way we did it was we had a chair</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a table set up and then we all sat</v>

918
00:41:00.761 --> 00:41:03.910
<v Speaker 1>facing the audience and just talked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

919
00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:06.310
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a regular podcast but in front of a</v>

920
00:41:06.311 --> 00:41:08.350
<v Speaker 1>live crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then someone would come out with</v>

921
00:41:08.351 --> 00:41:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Brian Hennigan would come out and give</v>
<v Speaker 1>us the updates.</v>

922
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Trump is ahead by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

923
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.560
<v Speaker 1>18 points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So did,</v>

924
00:41:14.561 --> 00:41:16.630
<v Speaker 1>did you see that coming trump winning or</v>
<v Speaker 1>no?</v>

925
00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was entirely possible.</v>

926
00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see it coming.</v>

927
00:41:21.761 --> 00:41:25.630
<v Speaker 1>I felt like everybody was so convinced</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Hillary was gonna win.</v>

928
00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.900
<v Speaker 1>I just felt like that was probably what</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to happen.</v>

929
00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:31.590
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like one of the reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

930
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:34.540
<v Speaker 1>my show got popular over is stuck in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>own digging.</v>

931
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:35.490
<v Speaker 1>This sounds so gross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

932
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:41.160
<v Speaker 1>but I actually predicted a pretty early</v>
<v Speaker 1>on when Hillary,</v>

933
00:41:41.161 --> 00:41:42.830
<v Speaker 1>it was clear Hillary was going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nomination.</v>

934
00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:45.590
<v Speaker 1>I was sounding the alarms and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

935
00:41:45.591 --> 00:41:48.440
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary versus trump is a worst case</v>

936
00:41:48.441 --> 00:41:52.160
<v Speaker 1>scenario because Hillary Clinton is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>status quo.</v>

937
00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:55.100
<v Speaker 1>She is the establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She is business as usual.</v>

938
00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:57.320
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't have a message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't have a vision.</v>

939
00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:00.080
<v Speaker 1>All she's doing is spewing platitudes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cliches,</v>

940
00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:02.360
<v Speaker 1>break down the barrier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger together,</v>

941
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.530
<v Speaker 1>doing identity politics nonstop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is nothing but pandering and not</v>

942
00:42:06.531 --> 00:42:09.740
<v Speaker 1>talking about policy substance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like we touched on earlier,</v>

943
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:12.260
<v Speaker 1>you had Donald Trump who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

944
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:14.660
<v Speaker 1>I disagree with him on virtually</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

945
00:42:14.661 --> 00:42:17.150
<v Speaker 1>but the guy knows how to fucking play to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a crowd,</v>

946
00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:19.520
<v Speaker 1>knows how to tell people what they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hear.</v>

947
00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.740
<v Speaker 1>So when he's in front of a blue collar</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>

948
00:42:21.741 --> 00:42:23.970
<v Speaker 1>he's out there ripping the trade deals</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

949
00:42:23.971 --> 00:42:26.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to keep your jobs in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country and it's gonna be amazing.</v>

950
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that landed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you have hillary,</v>

951
00:42:29.331 --> 00:42:34.331
<v Speaker 1>so dumb is to not a campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what Michigan and some Ohio was</v>

952
00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:36.470
<v Speaker 1>whole house I think she went to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of the rust belt states.</v>

953
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:38.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason he ended up winning is</v>

954
00:42:38.121 --> 00:42:42.710
<v Speaker 1>because of the rust belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and my whole point was trump is a</v>

955
00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:46.310
<v Speaker 1>populist and admittedly when push came</v>
<v Speaker 1>to shove,</v>

956
00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.220
<v Speaker 1>now that he's elected a fake populous</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he has Goldman Sachs throughout</v>

957
00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.020
<v Speaker 1>his administration and you serving Wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>Street,</v>

958
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:56.500
<v Speaker 1>but a fake populist will always beat a</v>
<v Speaker 1>status quo politician.</v>

959
00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Biggest people are sick and tired of</v>
<v Speaker 1>business as usual and they feel like,</v>

960
00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:03.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting shafted now and she's coming</v>

961
00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:05.630
<v Speaker 1>along telling me I'm going to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything the same.</v>

962
00:43:05.631 --> 00:43:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Why the fuck would I be happy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>excited to vote for her?</v>

963
00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:12.980
<v Speaker 1>It was like there was so many things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were in place that were against</v>

964
00:43:12.981 --> 00:43:13.130
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

965
00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:14.980
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would.</v>

966
00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:20.000
<v Speaker 1>She has absolutely poor health and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was admitted by her husband that she had</v>

967
00:43:20.001 --> 00:43:24.620
<v Speaker 1>fallen down and cracked her head open</v>
<v Speaker 1>and had pretty severe brain injury that</v>

968
00:43:24.621 --> 00:43:26.900
<v Speaker 1>she took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took more than six months for her to</v>

969
00:43:26.901 --> 00:43:28.460
<v Speaker 1>recover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to bill,</v>

970
00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:31.250
<v Speaker 1>we saw our fainting all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

971
00:43:31.251 --> 00:43:31.771
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

972
00:43:31.771 --> 00:43:33.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was creepy at the nine slash 11</v>

973
00:43:33.231 --> 00:43:35.620
<v Speaker 1>thing when she's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just in the.</v>

974
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:36.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had the flu.</v>

975
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:39.640
<v Speaker 1>I've had the flu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't fall asleep.</v>

976
00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:41.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm standing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

977
00:43:41.001 --> 00:43:42.740
<v Speaker 1>that shit ain't good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>

978
00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:46.520
<v Speaker 1>And that was just one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is she's just a</v>

979
00:43:46.521 --> 00:43:50.480
<v Speaker 1>disingenuous person when the whole comey</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing with the FBI,</v>

980
00:43:50.481 --> 00:43:53.180
<v Speaker 1>when he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there was a video that came out</v>

981
00:43:53.181 --> 00:43:58.181
<v Speaker 1>where he explained what the charges were</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what they had found about the emails</v>

982
00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:00.530
<v Speaker 1>and then she explained the version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

983
00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.720
<v Speaker 1>She's just not honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

984
00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Then it was the whole gay marriage</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

985
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:07.190
<v Speaker 1>She didn't support gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty 13,</v>

986
00:44:07.191 --> 00:44:09.230
<v Speaker 1>13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking crazy.</v>

987
00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.810
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then here's the other thing,</v>

988
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:14.330
<v Speaker 1>she's a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of sexists.</v>

989
00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:16.730
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman to be president,</v>

990
00:44:16.731 --> 00:44:18.920
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially not a woman that could point</v>

991
00:44:18.921 --> 00:44:20.960
<v Speaker 1>to all these floors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poor health,</v>

992
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:24.650
<v Speaker 1>liar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dishonest in bed with Wall Street,</v>

993
00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets paid by banks.</v>

994
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of thousand dollars won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>release the transcripts.</v>

995
00:44:28.671 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Clinton Foundation seems Kinda Shady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so different things that were</v>

996
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.460
<v Speaker 3>against her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She put the fact that she's a woman</v>

997
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:39.360
<v Speaker 3>front and center on with her was her</v>
<v Speaker 3>campaign slogan and you know what</v>

998
00:44:39.361 --> 00:44:42.180
<v Speaker 3>happens when you try to shove identity</v>
<v Speaker 3>politics down people's throats.</v>

999
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:45.510
<v Speaker 3>They you to fuck off because they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care that you're a woman.</v>

1000
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.820
<v Speaker 3>I want to know what you're going to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the country,</v>

1001
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:51.140
<v Speaker 3>but the people were that were into that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're telling her that that was going to</v>

1002
00:44:51.141 --> 00:44:53.280
<v Speaker 3>be her key to victory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to make history.</v>

1003
00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:58.820
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows less about politics than</v>
<v Speaker 3>democratic strategist in Washington dc</v>

1004
00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:03.420
<v Speaker 3>because as of right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're trying to do is they're</v>

1005
00:45:03.421 --> 00:45:06.920
<v Speaker 3>trying to fight back against their base,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're based.</v>

1006
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:11.310
<v Speaker 3>It's people like me and what we want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very clear about what I want.</v>

1007
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:15.120
<v Speaker 3>It's not hard to please people like me</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are on the left.</v>

1008
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.220
<v Speaker 3>We want a living wage.</v>

1009
00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:22.770
<v Speaker 3>We want Medicare for all which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every other modern nation has one</v>

1010
00:45:22.771 --> 00:45:24.660
<v Speaker 3>version or another of a single payer</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthcare system.</v>

1011
00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:26.100
<v Speaker 3>We just want to be like the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>modern world.</v>

1012
00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:29.310
<v Speaker 3>We want free college again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Slovenia has fucking free college.</v>

1013
00:45:29.311 --> 00:45:31.830
<v Speaker 3>We can't afford to do free college when</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just spent seven fucking trillion</v>

1014
00:45:31.831 --> 00:45:34.530
<v Speaker 3>dollars on the Iraq war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to end the wars.</v>

1015
00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:38.070
<v Speaker 3>So I have very clear policy goals that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

1016
00:45:38.071 --> 00:45:40.170
<v Speaker 3>And guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders came along,</v>

1017
00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:44.430
<v Speaker 3>spoke about those issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went from being this obscure senator</v>

1018
00:45:44.431 --> 00:45:47.250
<v Speaker 3>from Vermont,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has a population of 12 people to</v>

1019
00:45:47.251 --> 00:45:52.251
<v Speaker 3>getting 47 percent of the vote in a race</v>
<v Speaker 3>against a political juggernaut,</v>

1020
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:55.890
<v Speaker 3>a behemoth that had the entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>Democratic Party machine behind her.</v>

1021
00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:58.890
<v Speaker 3>So they were rigging the primers 100</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>

1022
00:45:58.891 --> 00:46:00.000
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we learned.</v>

1023
00:46:00.001 --> 00:46:01.110
<v Speaker 3>And that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1024
00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:03.000
<v Speaker 3>Julian assange went from being viewed</v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

1025
00:46:03.001 --> 00:46:04.740
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy is great.</v>

1026
00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.810
<v Speaker 3>That's how the left used to view them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now many people,</v>

1027
00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:08.610
<v Speaker 3>democratic partisans are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1028
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.660
<v Speaker 3>fuck this Guy Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>

1029
00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:11.520
<v Speaker 3>that I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

1030
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.500
<v Speaker 3>And I was just talking to you about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>before the podcast.</v>

1031
00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:16.500
<v Speaker 3>I was watching CNN before he came here</v>
<v Speaker 3>for about an hour and 30 minutes</v>

1032
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.120
<v Speaker 3>nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia coverage,</v>

1033
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:19.680
<v Speaker 3>nonstop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking Russia coverage.</v>

1034
00:46:19.681 --> 00:46:22.170
<v Speaker 3>And then guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now when Donald trump goes out there and</v>

1035
00:46:22.171 --> 00:46:23.490
<v Speaker 3>he's a fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>CNN,</v>

1036
00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:24.481
<v Speaker 3>everyone's going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1037
00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:26.100
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All they do is fucking talk about Russia</v>

1038
00:46:26.101 --> 00:46:28.050
<v Speaker 3>all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe the guy has a point,</v>

1039
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:32.160
<v Speaker 3>so the institutions that we have and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>establishment as it is,</v>

1040
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:36.990
<v Speaker 3>it opens up the door for a demagogue and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a liar and a fake populist like trump to</v>

1041
00:46:36.991 --> 00:46:41.310
<v Speaker 3>come in there and exploited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you give people a choice between a</v>

1042
00:46:41.311 --> 00:46:45.120
<v Speaker 3>broken system that's fucking them over</v>
<v Speaker 3>where half of workers in America make</v>

1043
00:46:45.121 --> 00:46:46.800
<v Speaker 3>$30,000 a year or less.</v>

1044
00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:51.210
<v Speaker 3>You give people an option between keep</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything as is or take a fucking human</v>

1045
00:46:51.211 --> 00:46:53.580
<v Speaker 3>bowling ball and throw it at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>establishment.</v>

1046
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:54.631
<v Speaker 3>They're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1047
00:46:54.631 --> 00:46:56.280
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll roll the dice on this trump guy.</v>

1048
00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.070
<v Speaker 3>And then meanwhile I look at his agenda</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything that he's done since he's</v>

1049
00:46:59.071 --> 00:47:01.050
<v Speaker 3>got elected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the opposite of his populist</v>

1050
00:47:01.051 --> 00:47:05.190
<v Speaker 3>rhetoric on the campaign trail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His fucking tax bill had a 33 percent</v>

1051
00:47:05.191 --> 00:47:08.220
<v Speaker 3>favorable rating and they were bragging</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it when they passed it.</v>

1052
00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:13.110
<v Speaker 3>This is a bill that cuts corporate taxes</v>
<v Speaker 3>from 35 percent to 21 percent at a time</v>

1053
00:47:13.111 --> 00:47:16.110
<v Speaker 3>when corporations already paying a</v>
<v Speaker 3>historically low percentage of the tax</v>

1054
00:47:16.111 --> 00:47:20.460
<v Speaker 3>burden and it raises taxes on everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes $75,000 a year or less over a</v>

1055
00:47:20.461 --> 00:47:24.000
<v Speaker 3>10 year period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you couldn't get a piece of</v>

1056
00:47:24.001 --> 00:47:28.320
<v Speaker 3>legislation that spits in the face of</v>
<v Speaker 3>working people more than that,</v>

1057
00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:29.860
<v Speaker 3>but the saddest thing is</v>

1058
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:34.300
<v Speaker 1>this guy is so comically easy to beat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Democrats can't get their shit</v>

1059
00:47:34.301 --> 00:47:37.690
<v Speaker 1>together because they're fighting back</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the grassroots who care about</v>

1060
00:47:37.691 --> 00:47:40.180
<v Speaker 1>the issues because they're in bed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations.</v>

1061
00:47:40.181 --> 00:47:42.400
<v Speaker 1>The Democrats are in bed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations just like the Republicans</v>

1062
00:47:42.401 --> 00:47:44.740
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you've got this corrupt party</v>

1063
00:47:44.741 --> 00:47:48.130
<v Speaker 1>establishment and they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tamper down the wing of the party,</v>

1064
00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:49.990
<v Speaker 1>that can actually win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then guess what?</v>

1065
00:47:49.991 --> 00:47:51.610
<v Speaker 1>You're going to keep losing to these</v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters,</v>

1066
00:47:51.611 --> 00:47:55.570
<v Speaker 1>these comic book villains on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that the parties</v>

1067
00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.990
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a giant issue with the momentum</v>

1068
00:47:58.991 --> 00:48:01.330
<v Speaker 1>behind them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lobbyists and special interest</v>

1069
00:48:01.331 --> 00:48:05.650
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the embedded just sort of ecosystem that</v>

1070
00:48:05.651 --> 00:48:10.651
<v Speaker 1>they both carry with them for someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>new to step in and sort of represent the</v>

1071
00:48:11.741 --> 00:48:16.300
<v Speaker 1>actual people like yourself that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>this very clear view.</v>

1072
00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why they have so many people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're beholden to by the time</v>

1073
00:48:19.901 --> 00:48:22.240
<v Speaker 1>they get into a position where they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>even run for president,</v>

1074
00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:25.060
<v Speaker 1>they've all been vetted and checked and</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1075
00:48:25.061 --> 00:48:25.840
<v Speaker 1>that's why they're.</v>

1076
00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:29.230
<v Speaker 1>There are some keys here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the most important things is</v>

1077
00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.270
<v Speaker 1>when you look at a politician who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>running thing,</v>

1078
00:48:31.271 --> 00:48:33.850
<v Speaker 1>number one is check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they take corporate PAC money?</v>

1079
00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:36.130
<v Speaker 1>If the answer's yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1080
00:48:36.131 --> 00:48:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't take corporate PAC money,</v>

1081
00:48:39.941 --> 00:48:43.090
<v Speaker 1>that means okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least I know you're being honest and</v>

1082
00:48:43.091 --> 00:48:45.100
<v Speaker 1>you're being open and when you talk I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can believe you.</v>

1083
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:48.070
<v Speaker 1>But if the problem comes along that</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful politician,</v>

1084
00:48:48.071 --> 00:48:52.570
<v Speaker 1>someone who could actually possibly when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do take corporate pac money,</v>

1085
00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:56.010
<v Speaker 1>but there are a better alternative than</v>
<v Speaker 1>say a,</v>

1086
00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:57.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pence.</v>

1087
00:48:57.341 --> 00:48:59.710
<v Speaker 1>If pence shirts to be present after then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

1088
00:48:59.711 --> 00:49:01.150
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to choose the lesser of two</v>

1089
00:49:01.151 --> 00:49:02.980
<v Speaker 1>evils.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's essentially what we did with</v>

1090
00:49:02.981 --> 00:49:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1091
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:06.490
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I get into that weird position</v>

1092
00:49:06.491 --> 00:49:06.851
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1093
00:49:06.851 --> 00:49:07.990
<v Speaker 1>she's kind of corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>

1094
00:49:07.991 --> 00:49:09.370
<v Speaker 1>she's going to be historic.</v>

1095
00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:12.010
<v Speaker 1>She's a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's infinitely more qualified than him</v>

1096
00:49:12.011 --> 00:49:14.170
<v Speaker 1>and he had the Lesser Evil Ism thing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1097
00:49:14.171 --> 00:49:19.171
<v Speaker 1>is a big issue because that's the game</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's played on the American people.</v>

1098
00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:22.540
<v Speaker 1>And I think Americans know that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>being played on them.</v>

1099
00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:24.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you look at the um,</v>

1100
00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:28.810
<v Speaker 1>the opinion polls on Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress oscillates between a 14 percent</v>

1101
00:49:28.811 --> 00:49:31.540
<v Speaker 1>approval rating and a 21 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>approval rating and what's supposed to</v>

1102
00:49:31.541 --> 00:49:32.860
<v Speaker 1>be a democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>

1103
00:49:32.861 --> 00:49:35.500
<v Speaker 1>you vote these people in and then two</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks later you go ask people,</v>

1104
00:49:35.501 --> 00:49:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think of the Congress?</v>

1105
00:49:36.461 --> 00:49:39.010
<v Speaker 1>You just voted in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like 14 percent of them are like,</v>

1106
00:49:39.011 --> 00:49:40.510
<v Speaker 1>I think they're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else was like,</v>

1107
00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:43.270
<v Speaker 1>fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we all know that there's a problem</v>

1108
00:49:43.271 --> 00:49:44.950
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the root of the problem is the</v>

1109
00:49:44.951 --> 00:49:47.560
<v Speaker 1>corruption of the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the corporate money flooding our</v>

1110
00:49:47.561 --> 00:49:50.740
<v Speaker 1>politics and then the politicians get in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and all they do is represent the</v>

1111
00:49:50.741 --> 00:49:52.480
<v Speaker 1>corporations and they don't represent</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people.</v>

1112
00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.610
<v Speaker 1>So to your point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1113
00:49:54.611 --> 00:49:58.150
<v Speaker 1>in order to rise up through this system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why they.</v>

1114
00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:01.330
<v Speaker 1>That's why the establishment loved</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton because she played by</v>

1115
00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:04.300
<v Speaker 1>the rules in this corrupt system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that?</v>

1116
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Her and bill through their entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

1117
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:11.350
<v Speaker 1>they raised over $3,000,000,000 in</v>
<v Speaker 1>private donations.</v>

1118
00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.750
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how you get to the point</v>

1119
00:50:13.751 --> 00:50:16.360
<v Speaker 1>where it was wall to wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously she's going to win.</v>

1120
00:50:16.361 --> 00:50:18.440
<v Speaker 1>This is a no brainer and everybody loves</v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

1121
00:50:18.441 --> 00:50:21.670
<v Speaker 1>I know everybody loves her on Fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wall Street and in Washington DC.</v>

1122
00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:22.991
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

1123
00:50:22.991 --> 00:50:24.820
<v Speaker 1>this to go back to the Bernie Sanders</v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

1124
00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:27.950
<v Speaker 1>now we're seeing more politicians coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>up that are</v>

1125
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.490
<v Speaker 3>in his model where they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna.</v>

1126
00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:33.170
<v Speaker 3>Take any corporate PAC money I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even want a super PAC.</v>

1127
00:50:33.171 --> 00:50:36.650
<v Speaker 3>If I run for president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what happens is people know at</v>

1128
00:50:36.651 --> 00:50:39.770
<v Speaker 3>the end of the day I can trust that</v>
<v Speaker 3>person even if I don't agree with that</v>

1129
00:50:39.771 --> 00:50:41.450
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why Bernie Sanders is the</v>

1130
00:50:41.451 --> 00:50:43.490
<v Speaker 3>most popular politician in the country</v>
<v Speaker 3>by a mile and a half.</v>

1131
00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:47.150
<v Speaker 3>He's the most popular by a long shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason is there are even many</v>

1132
00:50:47.151 --> 00:50:48.710
<v Speaker 3>people on the right who look at him and</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

1133
00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:50.900
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with them on abortion.</v>

1134
00:50:50.901 --> 00:50:54.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with him on this or that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I trust the guy and I think he's</v>

1135
00:50:54.411 --> 00:50:55.244
<v Speaker 3>fighting for me.</v>

1136
00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:57.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely that.</v>

1137
00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:58.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1138
00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:03.730
<v Speaker 2>he's a guy that really has a clean</v>
<v Speaker 2>record in terms of like the money that</v>

1139
00:51:03.731 --> 00:51:08.410
<v Speaker 2>he's taken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That alone is very unique and that alone</v>

1140
00:51:08.411 --> 00:51:11.170
<v Speaker 2>makes him stand out from the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that were running for president.</v>

1141
00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:14.860
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the future though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like who?</v>

1142
00:51:14.861 --> 00:51:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Other than him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the problem with him is</v>

1143
00:51:16.901 --> 00:51:18.250
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's another one.</v>

1144
00:51:18.251 --> 00:51:21.580
<v Speaker 2>He's not a good health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a thousand years old.</v>

1145
00:51:21.581 --> 00:51:22.990
<v Speaker 2>We could just say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also,</v>

1146
00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:24.760
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that are his age that are</v>

1147
00:51:24.761 --> 00:51:26.950
<v Speaker 2>in very good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how old is he?</v>

1148
00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:30.160
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>75,</v>

1149
00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:31.770
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven.</v>

1150
00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:32.613
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you check that?</v>

1151
00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:38.050
<v Speaker 2>My friend Aaron Snyder had a podcast the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other day with a gentleman who's 78</v>

1152
00:51:38.051 --> 00:51:40.610
<v Speaker 2>years old who goes on backpacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>solo,</v>

1153
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:42.760
<v Speaker 2>alcance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any rides,</v>

1154
00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:46.510
<v Speaker 2>holy mountain bikes and exercises and</v>
<v Speaker 2>does all this shit.</v>

1155
00:51:46.511 --> 00:51:50.500
<v Speaker 2>Like there are people out there that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>his age that take care of their body,</v>

1156
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:52.660
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>76,</v>

1157
00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:56.770
<v Speaker 2>76 sit somewhere in the middle of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>sternum.</v>

1158
00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:01.000
<v Speaker 2>He's got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going Dr. posture like he looks</v>

1159
00:52:01.001 --> 00:52:06.001
<v Speaker 2>like a Schlubby slumpy sort of unhealthy</v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

1160
00:52:06.521 --> 00:52:08.740
<v Speaker 2>doesn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know that's not unimportant,</v>

1161
00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:12.040
<v Speaker 2>but it is kind of important to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want some?</v>

1162
00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying the optics of it matter to</v>

1163
00:52:14.321 --> 00:52:15.041
<v Speaker 3>an extent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1164
00:52:15.041 --> 00:52:17.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there are.</v>

1165
00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:19.360
<v Speaker 3>There are a few good politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

1166
00:52:19.361 --> 00:52:22.510
<v Speaker 3>Rocana is a positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's actually from California.</v>

1167
00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:24.820
<v Speaker 3>He's a congressman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want the name.</v>

1168
00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:27.330
<v Speaker 3>He has risen usual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's risen through the ranks.</v>

1169
00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:29.530
<v Speaker 3>Star Trek Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he's a bad ass.</v>

1170
00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:33.100
<v Speaker 3>He's a bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So know I could maybe hook up if you</v>

1171
00:52:33.101 --> 00:52:35.290
<v Speaker 3>wanted to have him on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll talk to them and see if he'd be</v>

1172
00:52:35.291 --> 00:52:36.130
<v Speaker 3>willing to come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he would,</v>

1173
00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:37.470
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

1174
00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:40.750
<v Speaker 3>he's a young guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how old really smart guy.</v>

1175
00:52:40.751 --> 00:52:42.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly how old he is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's,</v>

1176
00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.090
<v Speaker 3>he's young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be,</v>

1177
00:52:43.091 --> 00:52:46.030
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>39 or something to run for Congress.</v>

1178
00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:48.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm 35.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

1179
00:52:48.881 --> 00:52:53.050
<v Speaker 3>check that fact to our presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 presidents.</v>

1180
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Thirty five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

1181
00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:54.963
<v Speaker 3>That's so young.</v>

1182
00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:57.720
<v Speaker 3>I was retarded when I was retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now when I'm 30,</v>

1183
00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:00.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was 35.</v>

1184
00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.820
<v Speaker 3>How can you allow people to be 35 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>old and run for president?</v>

1185
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:05.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So crazy.</v>

1186
00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean at the same time,</v>

1187
00:53:07.451 --> 00:53:09.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there are some people who can</v>
<v Speaker 3>do the job,</v>

1188
00:53:09.801 --> 00:53:10.780
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to Rocana.</v>

1189
00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:11.860
<v Speaker 3>Rocana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1190
00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:13.170
<v Speaker 3>he's a bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1191
00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:16.330
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't take any corporate PAC money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a great record of fighting for</v>

1192
00:53:16.331 --> 00:53:19.330
<v Speaker 3>the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's one of the few people who remember</v>

1193
00:53:19.331 --> 00:53:23.420
<v Speaker 3>when we were talking about going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Syria and doubling down on doing in</v>

1194
00:53:23.421 --> 00:53:25.770
<v Speaker 3>Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will trump recently announced we're</v>

1195
00:53:25.771 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 3>staying</v>

1196
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:28.470
<v Speaker 1>there indefinitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have a permanent military</v>

1197
00:53:28.471 --> 00:53:32.040
<v Speaker 1>occupation in Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rocana is one of the very few voices in</v>

1198
00:53:32.041 --> 00:53:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1199
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.680
<v Speaker 1>all the Democrats should be out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1200
00:53:34.681 --> 00:53:36.630
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are we doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get out of what the.</v>

1201
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:39.870
<v Speaker 1>What's the point of being there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rocana was one of the few who actually</v>

1202
00:53:39.871 --> 00:53:42.150
<v Speaker 1>spoke up about it and actually said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1203
00:53:42.151 --> 00:53:43.620
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

1204
00:53:43.621 --> 00:53:45.030
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>

1205
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.180
<v Speaker 1>we haven't even had a vote on it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>congress.</v>

1206
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:52.820
<v Speaker 1>The whole idea is if you go do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>military intervention according to the</v>

1207
00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:54.690
<v Speaker 1>constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to get a declaration of war</v>

1208
00:53:54.691 --> 00:53:56.820
<v Speaker 1>from Congress and real constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>

1209
00:53:56.821 --> 00:53:59.100
<v Speaker 1>We're nowhere near abiding by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution here.</v>

1210
00:53:59.101 --> 00:54:01.560
<v Speaker 1>We have to at least have a vote on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one person.</v>

1211
00:54:01.561 --> 00:54:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Tulsi Gabbard is another politician</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's fantastic,</v>

1212
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:05.490
<v Speaker 1>who is a weird names.</v>

1213
00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Let me see this real kind of person</v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

1214
00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Let me see what they look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give him the sniff test.</v>

1215
00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:12.630
<v Speaker 1>This is how Americans do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and look at a man.</v>

1216
00:54:12.631 --> 00:54:14.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show him Tulsi.</v>

1217
00:54:14.581 --> 00:54:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Gavin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very curious what you going to say</v>

1218
00:54:16.321 --> 00:54:17.131
<v Speaker 1>about Tulsa?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You average.</v>

1219
00:54:17.131 --> 00:54:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Let me go with the person first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1220
00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My first guest on spelling didn't pull</v>

1221
00:54:21.421 --> 00:54:26.010
<v Speaker 1>up what I was o k h a n n a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one name.</v>

1222
00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:29.640
<v Speaker 1>That can't be one name as the first row</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the first name.</v>

1223
00:54:29.641 --> 00:54:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Khan is the last name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's his first name?</v>

1224
00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:33.690
<v Speaker 1>So it caught me off guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Outta here.</v>

1225
00:54:33.691 --> 00:54:35.730
<v Speaker 1>With that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me see what it looks like.</v>

1226
00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:39.990
<v Speaker 1>He's from a silicon valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you say it's silicon or silicon?</v>

1227
00:54:40.890 --> 00:54:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Silicon now you're confusing me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I say silicon.</v>

1228
00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:46.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's right though.</v>

1229
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1230
00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:51.900
<v Speaker 1>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fucking name.</v>

1231
00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:56.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then again saying Obama got elected</v>

1232
00:54:56.611 --> 00:54:57.480
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We</v>

1233
00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:01.100
<v Speaker 1>scrutinize this fellow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

1234
00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got a lot of good things here going.</v>

1235
00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.520
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the diversity factor is high.</v>

1236
00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:08.940
<v Speaker 1>It's off the charts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I love about Roe is that he</v>

1237
00:55:08.941 --> 00:55:12.180
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do the fake bullshit identity</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics of like,</v>

1238
00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore,</v>

1239
00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:15.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm great.</v>

1240
00:55:15.961 --> 00:55:16.800
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1241
00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:21.300
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the very few politicians who</v>
<v Speaker 1>regularly speaks up about people in the</v>

1242
00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:24.930
<v Speaker 1>middle of the country who got their</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking factory jobs outsourced because</v>

1243
00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.990
<v Speaker 1>corporations wanted to make more money</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's against all these trade deals</v>

1244
00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:30.240
<v Speaker 1>and said Dork with the tee shirt on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fired up.</v>

1245
00:55:30.241 --> 00:55:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Ready for row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1246
00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need you.</v>

1247
00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:37.300
<v Speaker 1>I need you to just rethink your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That looks like a yellow shirt.</v>

1248
00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:39.470
<v Speaker 1>A young fatter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mario Lopez to the right too.</v>

1249
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little bit.</v>

1250
00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Sorry Mario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No offense.</v>

1251
00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Was that him with Ted Kennedy down there</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the lower right hand corner?</v>

1252
00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that split screen Asian.</v>

1253
00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.113
<v Speaker 1>Ted Kennedy.</v>

1254
00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:57.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever that person is.</v>

1255

1272
00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked both of those things,</v>

00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:41.600
<v Speaker 1>let me see.</v>

1276
00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Closing on her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make her a little larger.</v>

1277

<v Speaker 1>boyfriend?</v>

1280
00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:57.940
<v Speaker 1>She's a brilliant woman and but she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>also beautiful.</v>

1281
00:56:57.941 --> 00:57:01.600

1412
01:02:00.861 --> 01:02:03.350
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could give them credit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was something along the lines of,</v>

1413
01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:07.610
<v Speaker 1>that's the type of black guy that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>unthreading to why people type black guy</v>

1414
01:02:07.611 --> 01:02:12.380
<v Speaker 1>that wears a cell phone holder or the</v>

1422
01:02:32.551 --> 01:02:36.810
<v Speaker 1>but in reality it shows in attempt to</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

1480
01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.180
<v Speaker 1>Just throw it around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like singing along to lyrics.</v>

1481
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:06.600
<v Speaker 1>If I sing it along to the lyrics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I roll my window up first at a respect.</v>

1482
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you do.</v>

1483
01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:10.710
<v Speaker 1>And then I just sort of mouth it like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1484
01:05:10.711 --> 01:05:13.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't really say it out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the rap songs,</v>

1485
01:05:13.141 --> 01:05:14.580
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I of course I did.</v>

1486
01:05:14.581 --> 01:05:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Did it in the rap songs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also just being an awkward,</v>

1487
01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:20.740
<v Speaker 1>a young white boy from Shell and having</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of black friends growing up and we</v>

1488
01:05:20.741 --> 01:05:22.060
<v Speaker 1>just throw it around like nobody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

1489
01:05:22.061 --> 01:05:23.850
<v Speaker 1>What year were you in newer show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1490
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.640
<v Speaker 1>so I'm born and raised there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was born in 88 and you know,</v>

1491
01:05:27.641 --> 01:05:30.940
<v Speaker 1>in probably when I was 20 is when I left</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1492
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I was living in new Rochelle,</v>

1493
01:05:32.921 --> 01:05:36.100
<v Speaker 1>you were living in new Rochelle because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was living there and like 91.</v>

1494
01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:37.300
<v Speaker 1>That's when I lived there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1495
01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.730
<v Speaker 1>But now I'm going to make you laugh</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was just talking to car and on</v>

1496
01:05:39.731 --> 01:05:44.590
<v Speaker 1>the way here about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like I have a memory of being</v>

1497
01:05:44.591 --> 01:05:48.790
<v Speaker 1>a kid watching fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on it.</v>

1498
01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:51.970
<v Speaker 1>And then I was so young that my mom</v>
<v Speaker 1>after it was like,</v>

1499
01:05:51.971 --> 01:05:53.200
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bedtime honey.</v>

1500
01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1501
01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I was a little fucking kid watching Joe</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogan and now I'm doing this podcast.</v>

1502
01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Well that totally makes sense because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that show was 16 plus years ago.</v>

1503
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand one.</v>

1504
01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:11.350
<v Speaker 1>I want to say two or one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe two.</v>

1505
01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:13.240
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you a question about when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were doing that show,</v>

1506
01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:17.710
<v Speaker 1>did you feel cause you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a really smart guy and you're</v>

1507
01:06:17.711 --> 01:06:19.840
<v Speaker 1>interested in a lot of different things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you.</v>

1508
01:06:20.130 --> 01:06:23.410
<v Speaker 1>I can tell just by talking to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're somebody who needs to pave your</v>

1509
01:06:23.411 --> 01:06:25.390
<v Speaker 1>own path and be your own boss and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>

1510
01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:29.680
<v Speaker 1>So did you feel like almost like a caged</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal when you were doing fear factor</v>

1511
01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:32.110
<v Speaker 1>because like you had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were forced to show up at a certain</v>

1512
01:06:32.111 --> 01:06:35.760
<v Speaker 1>time every day and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt lucky that I had a job where it</v>

1513
01:06:35.761 --> 01:06:38.040
<v Speaker 1>can make a shitload of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that your first?</v>

1514
01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.160
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had news radio before that I had</v>

1515
01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:45.330
<v Speaker 1>news radio which was extremely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely fortunate.</v>

1516
01:06:45.790 --> 01:06:50.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean that you couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't have stepped in shit any</v>

1517
01:06:50.471 --> 01:06:53.800
<v Speaker 1>deeper than with news radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just total luck.</v>

1518
01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:59.190
<v Speaker 1>I literally had like three acting</v>
<v Speaker 1>classes ever because I had to take them</v>

1519
01:07:00.491 --> 01:07:05.491
<v Speaker 1>because Disney gave me a development</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal because of a just stand up and they</v>

1520
01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.420
<v Speaker 1>just throw money at you and say do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1521
01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:10.630
<v Speaker 1>In the nineties they were doing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they had seen what happened with</v>

1522
01:07:10.631 --> 01:07:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Rosanne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had seen what happened with Tim</v>

1523
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Allen and Seinfeld and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you gotta do you gotta find</v>

1524
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:18.100
<v Speaker 1>someone that you think is funny and</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop show around them,</v>

1525
01:07:18.101 --> 01:07:21.100
<v Speaker 1>and it worked with some people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brett Butler out a show.</v>

1526
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:25.450
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of that going on and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to do that and so I had</v>

1527
01:07:25.451 --> 01:07:27.300
<v Speaker 1>a development deal and then I had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>show that it was on,</v>

1528
01:07:27.301 --> 01:07:31.480
<v Speaker 1>on Fox for a few episodes and it got</v>
<v Speaker 1>canceled and then I got on Newsradio.</v>

1529
01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:36.250
<v Speaker 1>So I'm on news radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six years into my standup career I was</v>

1530
01:07:36.251 --> 01:07:38.560
<v Speaker 1>literally a beginner in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>standup,</v>

1531
01:07:38.561 --> 01:07:41.350
<v Speaker 1>like have you talked to a standard six</v>
<v Speaker 1>years considered a beginner,</v>

1532
01:07:41.351 --> 01:07:42.184
<v Speaker 1>you said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1533
01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:43.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a beginner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1534
01:07:43.441 --> 01:07:44.530
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what the fuck you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

1535
01:07:44.530 --> 01:07:46.290
<v Speaker 1>I took a guy on the road with me</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>

1536
01:07:46.291 --> 01:07:50.410
<v Speaker 1>They had been doing comedy for seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and he's got 20 minutes material.</v>

1537
01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1538
01:07:51.370 --> 01:07:55.750
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking to go rind son Nez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other people like more advanced,</v>

1539
01:07:55.751 --> 01:07:59.020
<v Speaker 1>like Tony Hinchcliffe seven years in had</v>
<v Speaker 1>already done a Netflix special.</v>

1540
01:07:59.080 --> 01:07:59.891
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1541
01:07:59.891 --> 01:08:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean it really varies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It varies.</v>

1542
01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:05.530
<v Speaker 1>In comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel more is like your baby than any</v>

1543
01:08:05.531 --> 01:08:06.670
<v Speaker 1>of the acting stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1544
01:08:06.790 --> 01:08:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the acting stuff was just an</v>

1545
01:08:08.921 --> 01:08:10.870
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to make money and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>

1546
01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:13.660
<v Speaker 1>It was also an opportunity to get people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come see you do standup,</v>

1547
01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 1>but it was weird like to all of a sudden</v>

1548
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:20.390
<v Speaker 2>be acting with Phil Hartman and Andy</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick and Stephen Root.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I feel sitting across from Joe Rogan if</v>

1552
01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:27.980
<v Speaker 2>we're just talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1553
01:08:27.981 --> 01:08:31.610
<v Speaker 2>but it's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is true.</v>

1554
01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:33.230
<v Speaker 2>It all becomes normal man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1555
01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:36.470
<v Speaker 2>I still get weirded out when I meet</v>
<v Speaker 2>famous people that I really like put</v>

1556
01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:37.401
<v Speaker 2>who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1557
01:08:37.401 --> 01:08:38.950
<v Speaker 2>there obviously are people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1558
01:08:38.970 --> 01:08:41.420
<v Speaker 2>like Jack Nicholson for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is way more famous than you,</v>

1559
01:08:41.421 --> 01:08:43.910
<v Speaker 2>but like there's not many people.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1566
01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:57.620

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1567
01:08:57.621 --> 01:08:59.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm more the list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1568
01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:01.680
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people your age know wham.</v>

1569
01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:04.040
<v Speaker 2>It's a different worry buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Age knows who you are.</v>

1570
01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:05.630
<v Speaker 2>It's different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different world.</v>

1571
01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:10.960
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the fear factor thing was I had done</v>

1572
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:15.260
<v Speaker 2>a lot of stuff after news radio that</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't work.</v>

1573
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:18.680
<v Speaker 2>Not a lot of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a few pilot scripts that I had</v>

1574
01:09:18.681 --> 01:09:20.720
<v Speaker 2>gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few meetings that I had with people</v>

1575
01:09:20.721 --> 01:09:22.780
<v Speaker 2>that were kind of goofy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of like,</v>

1576
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:25.040
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved working with my,</v>

1577
01:09:25.230 --> 01:09:28.550
<v Speaker 2>my cat might cast my friends from news</v>
<v Speaker 2>radio.</v>

1578
01:09:28.551 --> 01:09:30.980
<v Speaker 2>They were great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had also worked with a bunch of</v>

1579
01:09:30.981 --> 01:09:34.760
<v Speaker 2>actors who were actors that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not an environment,</v>

1580
01:09:34.761 --> 01:09:38.090
<v Speaker 2>it's not a job that lends itself to</v>
<v Speaker 2>authenticity.</v>

1581
01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:41.000
<v Speaker 2>It's a job that lends itself to</v>
<v Speaker 2>conformity because you're always</v>

1582
01:09:41.001 --> 01:09:43.280
<v Speaker 2>auditioning for things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you want everybody to like you,</v>

1583
01:09:43.281 --> 01:09:46.640
<v Speaker 2>so you sort of pattern your likes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>dislikes,</v>

1584
01:09:46.641 --> 01:09:48.680
<v Speaker 2>your behavior patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1585
01:09:48.710 --> 01:09:51.470
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your opinions to what you lick your</v>

1586
01:09:51.471 --> 01:09:52.850
<v Speaker 2>finger and put it in the air.</v>

1587
01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:54.410
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the wind blowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going that way.</v>

1588
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:57.590
<v Speaker 2>That's the safest way to make a living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of that in Hollywood.</v>

1589
01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:59.750
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gets back to my point about how</v>

1590
01:09:59.751 --> 01:10:01.970
<v Speaker 2>insular they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how everybody in Hollywood like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1595
01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe some men struggling with wrestling</v>

1596
01:10:15.441 --> 01:10:17.940
<v Speaker 2>with menopause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe some stops all xanax out.</v>

1597
01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:23.050
<v Speaker 2>Sitting there like drinking wine with</v>
<v Speaker 2>her husband pays the shit he says he</v>

1598
01:10:24.030 --> 01:10:26.230
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1599
01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:29.270
<v Speaker 2>so when fear fact came along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two things,</v>

1600
01:10:29.271 --> 01:10:31.070
<v Speaker 2>I thought one was going to be cancelled</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>

1601
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:32.870
<v Speaker 2>I was really convinced and went on</v>
<v Speaker 2>forever,</v>

1602
01:10:32.871 --> 01:10:34.880
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 48 episodes.</v>

1603
01:10:34.881 --> 01:10:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Then we came back and did seven more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1604
01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:41.030
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting attacked by dogs and make</v>

1605
01:10:41.031 --> 01:10:42.430
<v Speaker 2>people eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating bold dicks.</v>

1606
01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.690
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is no way this is going to last.</v>

1607
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:46.490
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I felt,</v>

1608
01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:49.760
<v Speaker 2>I felt like at the very least it would</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me some material and it was,</v>

1609
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:54.140
<v Speaker 2>it was a generous amount of money and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was money that I was like,</v>

1610
01:10:54.141 --> 01:10:56.210
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I do this and I keep doing this,</v>

1611
01:10:56.211 --> 01:10:58.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to do other things like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be free.</v>

1612
01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:04.240
<v Speaker 2>And that having that ability to say no</v>
<v Speaker 2>to things and have fuck you money and to</v>

1613
01:11:05.241 --> 01:11:07.400
<v Speaker 2>just not worry about how to pay your</v>
<v Speaker 2>bills.</v>

1614
01:11:07.401 --> 01:11:11.390
<v Speaker 2>I knew when I lived in new Rochelle is</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually when I got my first development</v>

1615
01:11:11.391 --> 01:11:13.100
<v Speaker 2>deal and when I got my first</v>
<v Speaker 2>development,</v>

1616
01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:18.260
<v Speaker 2>there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this physical weight left lip lifted off</v>

1617
01:11:18.511 --> 01:11:21.540
<v Speaker 2>of me where I didn't have to worry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how am I going to pay my rent next</v>

1618
01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:23.160
<v Speaker 2>month?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How am I going to pay my gas,</v>

1619
01:11:23.161 --> 01:11:23.850
<v Speaker 2>how am I going to share?</v>

1620
01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:27.390
<v Speaker 2>Because that was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went from that to having some money</v>

1621
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:29.160
<v Speaker 2>and the feeling that I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1622
01:11:29.210 --> 01:11:29.611
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1623
01:11:29.611 --> 01:11:34.150
<v Speaker 2>this is valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is some bullshit idea like having</v>

1624
01:11:34.151 --> 01:11:36.120
<v Speaker 2>my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that being rich makes you</v>

1625
01:11:36.121 --> 01:11:36.931
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1626
01:11:36.931 --> 01:11:41.931
<v Speaker 2>but having resources is a valuable thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and having the resources to not have to</v>

1627
01:11:42.301 --> 01:11:45.300
<v Speaker 2>do something you don't want to do and</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can pursue what you want to</v>

1628
01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:46.890
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's valuable as well.</v>

1629
01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:51.270
<v Speaker 2>So it's funny you bring that up because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I covered a study that came out a few</v>

1630
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:56.270
<v Speaker 2>weeks ago on my show and I'm apparently</v>
<v Speaker 2>researchers found out that when you can,</v>

1631
01:11:56.740 --> 01:12:01.440
<v Speaker 2>you hit a certain level of happiness</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you hit $75,000 a year because I</v>

1632
01:12:01.441 --> 01:12:06.210
<v Speaker 2>think they figured out that that's where</v>
<v Speaker 2>people can generally pay the bills and</v>

1633
01:12:06.211 --> 01:12:07.890
<v Speaker 2>be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they said,</v>

1634
01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:10.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you make up to 95,000,</v>

1635
01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:14.940
<v Speaker 2>you do see a noticeable increase in</v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness when you jumped from 75,000 to</v>

1636
01:12:14.941 --> 01:12:15.830
<v Speaker 2>95,000.</v>

1637
01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:18.840
<v Speaker 2>So that's when people pretty much across</v>
<v Speaker 2>the board are like,</v>

1638
01:12:18.841 --> 01:12:19.674
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>

1639
01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:22.860
<v Speaker 2>And then everything after that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing with house money.</v>

1640
01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.240
<v Speaker 2>So they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1641
01:12:24.241 --> 01:12:28.410
<v Speaker 2>the difference between making $95,000 a</v>
<v Speaker 2>year and a million dollars a year,</v>

1642
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:32.220
<v Speaker 2>even though there's a big material</v>
<v Speaker 2>difference there in terms of how much it</v>

1643
01:12:32.221 --> 01:12:35.640
<v Speaker 2>buys your happiness it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a tapering effect when you hit</v>

1644
01:12:35.641 --> 01:12:39.150
<v Speaker 2>that $95,000 threshold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think also the amount of work that you</v>

1645
01:12:39.151 --> 01:12:43.320
<v Speaker 2>have to do to make a million dollars a</v>
<v Speaker 2>year significantly stresses you out.</v>

1646
01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.960
<v Speaker 2>You don't have time to do things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you love,</v>

1647
01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:47.120
<v Speaker 2>like say if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1648
01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:48.960
<v Speaker 2>you have some hobbies that you really</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoy.</v>

1649
01:12:48.961 --> 01:12:51.540
<v Speaker 2>You feel like I got to leave those alone</v>
<v Speaker 2>for awhile.</v>

1650
01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:55.230
<v Speaker 2>I got to pursue my career and go after</v>
<v Speaker 2>my career and really make it happen.</v>

1651
01:12:55.231 --> 01:12:58.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to balance that life.</v>

1652
01:12:58.291 --> 01:13:03.291
<v Speaker 2>Comfort in appreciation for your just</v>
<v Speaker 2>your existence here and trying to make a</v>

1653
01:13:04.291 --> 01:13:09.020
<v Speaker 2>living and sometimes people get that way</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong and they go all in on making a</v>

1654
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:14.030
<v Speaker 2>living and then you become some fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvey Weinstein Guy who's just all</v>

1655
01:13:14.641 --> 01:13:19.590
<v Speaker 2>about just vices and just filling your</v>
<v Speaker 2>life up with things that try to make you</v>

1656
01:13:19.591 --> 01:13:23.490
<v Speaker 2>happy because you've got $500,000,000 in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bank and you're constantly working</v>

1657
01:13:23.491 --> 01:13:25.170
<v Speaker 2>and you just set a good example.</v>

1658
01:13:25.170 --> 01:13:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Harvey Weinstein is a good example</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's shit fucking people in gas</v>

1659
01:13:28.471 --> 01:13:30.060
<v Speaker 2>and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Electric.</v>

1660
01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:31.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1661
01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.810
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better example would be someone who,</v>

1662
01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:34.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

1663
01:13:34.751 --> 01:13:37.350
<v Speaker 2>So they have a heart attack and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>realizes they never had any fun.</v>

1664
01:13:37.351 --> 01:13:40.280
<v Speaker 2>And now their health has deteriorated so</v>
<v Speaker 2>radically that they,</v>

1665
01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:43.950
<v Speaker 2>they can't have fun and then they can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>work and they can't even do what they</v>

1666
01:13:43.951 --> 01:13:45.240
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they have to sort of reboot</v>

1667
01:13:45.241 --> 01:13:46.210
<v Speaker 2>their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1668
01:13:46.211 --> 01:13:50.520
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's very important to</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoy your time here.</v>

1669
01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:53.160
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking fleeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Kevin Smith.</v>

1670
01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:54.810
<v Speaker 2>Just A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw that.</v>

1671
01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:55.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1672
01:13:55.741 --> 01:13:57.810
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a great guy.</v>

1673
01:13:58.170 --> 01:14:00.210
<v Speaker 2>Because you've been on the podcast a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple times.</v>

1674
01:14:00.330 --> 01:14:02.460
<v Speaker 2>I've been on his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been on this one a couple times.</v>

1675
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:04.590
<v Speaker 2>He's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just a sweet,</v>

1676
01:14:05.490 --> 01:14:08.520
<v Speaker 2>genuine sweetheart of a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of those guys where if he</v>

1677
01:14:08.521 --> 01:14:10.440
<v Speaker 2>doesn't like someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like them.</v>

1678
01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 2>So like you trust him</v>

1679
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.440
<v Speaker 1>that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His judgment.</v>

1680
01:14:13.770 --> 01:14:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Kevin Smith doesn't lie,</v>

1681
01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:18.640
<v Speaker 1>he's a really nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if he doesn't like you,</v>

1682
01:14:18.641 --> 01:14:22.030
<v Speaker 1>you must be a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't make any sense.</v>

1683
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:26.350
<v Speaker 1>And you know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my point is that this is fleeting.</v>

1684
01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:27.550
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1685
01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:30.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm 50 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became 50 years old.</v>

1686
01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:32.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just keeps happening.</v>

1687
01:14:32.351 --> 01:14:32.861
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>

1688
01:14:32.861 --> 01:14:35.770
<v Speaker 1>I just turned 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just turned 30 on January 31st.</v>

1689
01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:37.480
<v Speaker 1>It was the first birthday where I ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>went,</v>

1690
01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1691
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:41.920
<v Speaker 1>I remember 30 shit just got a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

1692
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:44.250
<v Speaker 1>I remember 30 because I was dating a</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl was kind of a Twat.</v>

1693
01:14:44.650 --> 01:14:46.390
<v Speaker 1>She was just kind of living and not her</v>
<v Speaker 1>fault.</v>

1694
01:14:46.391 --> 01:14:47.640
<v Speaker 1>She's a little negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

1695
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:49.600
<v Speaker 1>I already thought you already worth 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1696
01:14:49.601 --> 01:14:53.200
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was telling you something's weird and</v>

1697
01:14:53.201 --> 01:14:53.650
<v Speaker 1>you're not even.</v>

1698
01:14:53.650 --> 01:14:55.360
<v Speaker 1>You're not even thinking about my</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

1699
01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:58.800
<v Speaker 1>I thought you already worth 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that what you're saying?</v>

1700
01:14:58.810 --> 01:15:01.480
<v Speaker 1>I looked through what bitch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you saying?</v>

1701
01:15:02.650 --> 01:15:05.980
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing to date for like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>surface thing,</v>

1702
01:15:05.981 --> 01:15:06.341
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1703
01:15:06.341 --> 01:15:09.220
<v Speaker 1>I think the person is older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the person is worth a lot of</v>

1704
01:15:09.221 --> 01:15:11.190
<v Speaker 1>money or I think that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shoes.</v>

1705
01:15:11.210 --> 01:15:13.660
<v Speaker 1>A deeply unhappy person that was trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to diminish me.</v>

1706
01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happened.</v>

1707
01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Not a healthy relationship now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a healthy relationship period,</v>

1708
01:15:19.421 --> 01:15:22.630
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lot of that happens in relationships,</v>

1709
01:15:22.631 --> 01:15:24.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People try to diminish each other or</v>

1710
01:15:24.611 --> 01:15:27.520
<v Speaker 1>they feel like they're in a bad position</v>
<v Speaker 1>of power,</v>

1711
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:30.160
<v Speaker 1>like they feel like they don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>power in the relationship,</v>

1712
01:15:30.161 --> 01:15:34.000
<v Speaker 1>so then they see that there's possibly a</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability and instead of like</v>

1713
01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:37.300
<v Speaker 1>soothing that person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they attack that vulnerability.</v>

1714
01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:39.490
<v Speaker 1>That's how you know you're in a terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>toxic.</v>

1715
01:15:39.491 --> 01:15:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Their power struggles share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah man.</v>

1716
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:45.310
<v Speaker 1>That's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a weird Machiavellian fucking</v>

1717
01:15:45.311 --> 01:15:46.300
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1718
01:15:46.301 --> 01:15:46.991
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1719
01:15:46.991 --> 01:15:48.700
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea of a relationship is</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be.</v>

1720
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.610
<v Speaker 1>That's where you go to get away from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit of everything.</v>

1721
01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:54.160
<v Speaker 1>So when that becomes part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit,</v>

1722
01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.480
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are we doing here?</v>

1723
01:15:55.690 --> 01:15:57.640
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He will probably get addicted to that</v>

1724
01:15:57.641 --> 01:16:00.100
<v Speaker 1>cycle there for a fucking for sure did</v>
<v Speaker 1>man it.</v>

1725
01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:02.350
<v Speaker 1>But it's hard to tell people while it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

1726
01:16:02.530 --> 01:16:03.910
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1727
01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:06.370
<v Speaker 1>you're in a bad relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is not good.</v>

1728
01:16:06.490 --> 01:16:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Like especially like rich guys with hot</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls that like,</v>

1729
01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:12.190
<v Speaker 1>don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

1730
01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:13.840
<v Speaker 1>And the was like miserable and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1731
01:16:13.841 --> 01:16:16.330
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you see what's happening?</v>

1732
01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:20.290
<v Speaker 1>This is not your money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not gonna work,</v>

1733
01:16:20.291 --> 01:16:22.090
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking sucks,</v>

1734
01:16:22.091 --> 01:16:23.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For that rich guy was kind of a dork.</v>

1735
01:16:23.921 --> 01:16:24.371
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1736
01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:29.371
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck did let you know what else</v>
<v Speaker 1>sucks when the antelope has a limp that</v>

1737
01:16:29.621 --> 01:16:32.170
<v Speaker 1>sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the lions running Adam and they're</v>

1738
01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:36.160
<v Speaker 1>in a God damn thing they could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The universe does not care about</v>

1739
01:16:36.161 --> 01:16:41.161
<v Speaker 1>whatever this imbalances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you as a thinking cognitive species</v>

1740
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:45.130
<v Speaker 1>like you as a conscious aware</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>

1741
01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:49.060
<v Speaker 1>you got to pay attention to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she's going to get your money or</v>

1742
01:16:49.061 --> 01:16:51.760
<v Speaker 1>she's going to leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but either something's happening,</v>

1743
01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:53.650
<v Speaker 1>something's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1744
01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:55.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going back to the point you made about</v>

1745
01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:58.180
<v Speaker 1>the rat race of life and people who get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like obsessed with work and stuff like</v>

1746
01:16:58.181 --> 01:17:00.970
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an interesting fact that nobody</v>

1747
01:17:00.971 --> 01:17:02.620
<v Speaker 1>talks about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why people don't think it's</v>

1748
01:17:02.621 --> 01:17:04.660
<v Speaker 1>a bigger deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but did you know that the United States</v>

1749
01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:08.860
<v Speaker 1>is the only developed country that</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have paid time off by law?</v>

1750
01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:12.290
<v Speaker 1>Every other modern countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to Europe for example,</v>

1751
01:17:12.291 --> 01:17:17.291
<v Speaker 1>they asked why we win bro Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have people who were on pills and</v>

1752
01:17:17.511 --> 01:17:22.511
<v Speaker 1>shit talking to me about losers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gordon Gekko loser countries,</v>

1753
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:27.050
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aren't we like these losers,</v>

1754
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:29.680
<v Speaker 1>those assholes with healthcare and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking vacation?</v>

1755
01:17:29.690 --> 01:17:31.730
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think people should get</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid time off.</v>

1756
01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:33.170
<v Speaker 1>And I definitely think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've,</v>

1757
01:17:33.171 --> 01:17:37.190
<v Speaker 1>I've had some pretty intense arguments</v>
<v Speaker 1>with wealthy people about a living wage</v>

1758
01:17:37.210 --> 01:17:38.690
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out of your fucking mind if you</v>

1759
01:17:38.691 --> 01:17:42.560
<v Speaker 1>think someone should be working for less</v>
<v Speaker 1>than $15 for an hour of their time.</v>

1760
01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.430
<v Speaker 1>So I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy's going to go in your backyard,</v>

1761
01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:48.230
<v Speaker 1>he's going to dig a fucking hole for an</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>

1762
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:51.170
<v Speaker 1>You want to give him $5?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much do you want to give them?</v>

1763
01:17:51.171 --> 01:17:53.240
<v Speaker 1>You want to give him $7?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Joe,</v>

1764
01:17:53.241 --> 01:17:57.200
<v Speaker 1>that's a market and they need to be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make contracts free of government</v>

1765
01:17:57.201 --> 01:17:57.860
<v Speaker 1>intervention.</v>

1766
01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Then I don't care for 12 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 year old,</v>

1767
01:18:01.491 --> 01:18:04.400
<v Speaker 1>a 12 year old digs for an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give them 20 bucks.</v>

1768
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:08.230
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the number is crazy and people</v>

1769
01:18:08.231 --> 01:18:10.340
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The businesses won't be able to survive.</v>

1770
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:11.990
<v Speaker 1>And that's just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>

1771
01:18:11.991 --> 01:18:15.170
<v Speaker 1>The person who is making the most money</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the top of the business won't make as</v>

1772
01:18:15.171 --> 01:18:16.490
<v Speaker 1>much money as they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1773
01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:18.260
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever people bring that point up,</v>

1774
01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.180
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't raise the minimum wage because</v>

1775
01:18:20.181 --> 01:18:23.000
<v Speaker 1>of reasons and stuff and things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always bring up Australia.</v>

1776
01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:26.480
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to point out that I made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Jack Shit about economics.</v>

1777
01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a little bit more than Jack Shit.</v>

1778
01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:32.510
<v Speaker 1>But if you look up the minimum wage in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>

1779
01:18:32.511 --> 01:18:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like $17 in change.</v>

1780
01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:37.070
<v Speaker 1>They pay you in boomerangs over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

1781
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:41.170
<v Speaker 1>Kangaroos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give you a bucket of poisonous</v>

1782
01:18:41.171 --> 01:18:41.840
<v Speaker 1>snakes.</v>

1783
01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>

1784
01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:46.490
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's like $17 and change and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1785
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:48.650
<v Speaker 1>They didn't look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And are they,</v>

1786
01:18:48.651 --> 01:18:52.580
<v Speaker 1>are they a hellscape?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Is Australia all bullshit aside?</v>

1787
01:18:52.581 --> 01:18:56.030
<v Speaker 1>I think Australia is fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So spare me with the bullshit arguments.</v>

1788
01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:58.580
<v Speaker 1>I can't afford to pay people a living</v>
<v Speaker 1>wage.</v>

1789
01:18:58.610 --> 01:19:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Read this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fair work commission has handed down</v>

1790
01:19:01.251 --> 01:19:03.260
<v Speaker 1>its annual ruling on Australia's minimum</v>
<v Speaker 1>wage,</v>

1791
01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:08.410
<v Speaker 1>raising it by two point four percent to</v>
<v Speaker 1>$672 and seventy cents a week.</v>

1792
01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:13.310
<v Speaker 1>That's excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So means that extra 15 point a $15,</v>

1793
01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:18.050
<v Speaker 1>eighty cents per week for the one point</v>
<v Speaker 1>$8 million workers who are paid the</v>

1794
01:19:18.051 --> 01:19:22.490
<v Speaker 1>minimum wage will apply from July first</v>
<v Speaker 1>and equates to a minimum hourly rate of</v>

1795
01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:25.790
<v Speaker 1>$17 and seventy cents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's in 2016.</v>

1796
01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:29.420
<v Speaker 1>May Thirtieth of 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an excellent 7:25 here.</v>

1797
01:19:29.421 --> 01:19:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that the raising the</v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum wage here today is actually</v>

1798
01:19:33.471 --> 01:19:38.471
<v Speaker 1>worth less than the minimum wage was</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth in 1968 because if you account for</v>

1799
01:19:38.721 --> 01:19:41.360
<v Speaker 1>inflation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the minimum wage from 1968 would be</v>

1800
01:19:41.361 --> 01:19:42.950
<v Speaker 1>about $10 in change today.</v>

1801
01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:47.000
<v Speaker 1>So people who are in the minimum wage</v>
<v Speaker 1>today make less than they made in 1968.</v>

1802
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:49.130
<v Speaker 1>I believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think that is?</v>

1803
01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's people just taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of poor people?</v>

1804
01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Is it they are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they really believe this is a</v>

1805
01:19:56.751 --> 01:19:59.470
<v Speaker 1>stepping stone position?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That no one who's making minimum wage</v>

1806
01:19:59.471 --> 01:20:03.170
<v Speaker 1>should ever consider this something</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to do forever.</v>

1807
01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:07.860
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that it's bad people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's bad individuals who</v>

1808
01:20:07.861 --> 01:20:11.610
<v Speaker 1>are trying to take advantage of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem is the system and</v>

1809
01:20:11.611 --> 01:20:16.260
<v Speaker 1>the only reason why we don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>system like Australia does with their</v>

1810
01:20:16.261 --> 01:20:19.230
<v Speaker 1>minimum wage is because corporations</v>
<v Speaker 1>have bought the government.</v>

1811
01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:22.710
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at the polls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 percent of people want to raise the</v>

1812
01:20:22.711 --> 01:20:25.410
<v Speaker 1>minimum wage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't get that and we don't get</v>

1813
01:20:25.411 --> 01:20:28.050
<v Speaker 1>that because there's a tremendous amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of money being poured into our</v>

1814
01:20:28.051 --> 01:20:30.420
<v Speaker 1>government from the likes of</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations that don't want to raise</v>

1815
01:20:30.421 --> 01:20:31.200
<v Speaker 1>the minimum wage.</v>

1816
01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:35.270
<v Speaker 1>So that's the only constituent group</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has all the power and they happened</v>

1817
01:20:35.271 --> 01:20:38.820
<v Speaker 1>to be the only constituent group against</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a living wage.</v>

1818
01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:41.340
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's the general dynamic</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind it.</v>

1819
01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:44.760
<v Speaker 1>I do think that there are some small</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses where they're like,</v>

1820
01:20:44.761 --> 01:20:47.460
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I genuinely don't have the money to do</v>

1821
01:20:47.461 --> 01:20:48.480
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1822
01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:49.890
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1823
01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:51.480
<v Speaker 1>for those cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1824
01:20:51.481 --> 01:20:53.580
<v Speaker 1>we can have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a separate conversation about those</v>

1825
01:20:53.581 --> 01:20:55.350
<v Speaker 1>instances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're a fucking giant</v>

1826
01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:58.140
<v Speaker 1>corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't bullshit us and tell us you can't</v>

1827
01:20:58.141 --> 01:21:01.290
<v Speaker 1>afford to pay somebody a living wage</v>
<v Speaker 1>because in the case of like Walmart for</v>

1828
01:21:01.291 --> 01:21:04.230
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't pay their people living wage</v>

1829
01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.960
<v Speaker 1>and then they dump all of their workers</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto the,</v>

1830
01:21:07.050 --> 01:21:09.960
<v Speaker 1>onto the medicaid rolls and onto the</v>
<v Speaker 1>social safety net.</v>

1831
01:21:10.110 --> 01:21:13.530
<v Speaker 1>So tax payers end up paying billions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars to support them.</v>

1832
01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who are part of Walmart or</v>

1833
01:21:16.531 --> 01:21:18.120
<v Speaker 1>running out the back door with all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking money.</v>

1834
01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's real.</v>

1835
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:23.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's kind of undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that a CEO should be able</v>

1836
01:21:23.461 --> 01:21:26.490
<v Speaker 1>to earn that much more money than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody else.</v>

1837
01:21:26.491 --> 01:21:30.900
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of fucking crazy to like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole ceo position is very bizarre.</v>

1838
01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:35.010
<v Speaker 1>The fact that these guys get payouts</v>
<v Speaker 1>when their companies go under and Wall</v>

1839
01:21:35.011 --> 01:21:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Street bailouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

1840
01:21:36.571 --> 01:21:39.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean stop and think about that for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>second because I don't think that people</v>

1841
01:21:39.901 --> 01:21:44.901
<v Speaker 1>really got how ridiculous that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you own a fucking Deli or you own</v>

1842
01:21:45.931 --> 01:21:48.360
<v Speaker 1>a dry cleaners and you go under,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what they say?</v>

1843
01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Tough Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take Care Buddy.</v>

1844
01:21:49.981 --> 01:21:50.814
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1845
01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:55.170
<v Speaker 1>But if you're a part of a big bank or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're part of a fucking hedge fund that</v>

1846
01:21:55.171 --> 01:21:58.950
<v Speaker 1>made the decisions that ended up</v>
<v Speaker 1>crashing the fucking economy,</v>

1847
01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:03.270
<v Speaker 1>not only do you not get fired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say in order to retain the talent</v>

1848
01:22:03.271 --> 01:22:05.610
<v Speaker 1>of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to pay them bonuses</v>

1849
01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:08.880
<v Speaker 1>with the taxpayer money that just bailed</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the corporation that they</v>

1850
01:22:08.881 --> 01:22:09.714
<v Speaker 1>bankrupted.</v>

1851
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:12.540
<v Speaker 1>That was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't just that these people got</v>

1852
01:22:12.541 --> 01:22:15.030
<v Speaker 1>bailed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was also very arguable.</v>

1853
01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Are good position to argue against that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1854
01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what would've happened if</v>

1855
01:22:20.011 --> 01:22:22.650
<v Speaker 1>we let the banks fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how catastrophic that would have</v>

1856
01:22:22.651 --> 01:22:25.020
<v Speaker 1>been to our economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's arguable whether it was a</v>

1857
01:22:25.021 --> 01:22:27.930
<v Speaker 1>debatable point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a debatable point to give those</v>

1858
01:22:27.931 --> 01:22:31.840
<v Speaker 1>fucking people millions of dollars of</v>
<v Speaker 1>taxpayers money has gone to the bailout</v>

1859
01:22:31.890 --> 01:22:34.290
<v Speaker 1>so that they can get that bonus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in their contract.</v>

1860
01:22:34.291 --> 01:22:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Obama was like,</v>

1861
01:22:35.641 --> 01:22:37.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in their contracts will fuck their</v>

1862
01:22:37.561 --> 01:22:40.110
<v Speaker 1>contracts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The contracts had no good now because</v>

1863
01:22:40.111 --> 01:22:43.380
<v Speaker 1>the whole company went under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your bank's fucked up.</v>

1864
01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:46.650
<v Speaker 1>You guys were running the banks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get that 50 million bucks you</v>

1865
01:22:46.651 --> 01:22:48.540
<v Speaker 1>were promised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's what they don't do.</v>

1866
01:22:48.541 --> 01:22:50.700
<v Speaker 1>They never come out and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1867
01:22:50.701 --> 01:22:54.120
<v Speaker 1>well we're going to do is a bailout of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who are hurt by this.</v>

1868
01:22:54.150 --> 01:22:55.080
<v Speaker 1>They always go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1869
01:22:55.081 --> 01:22:57.750
<v Speaker 1>what we have to do is we have to give it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the companies that just made the</v>

1870
01:22:57.751 --> 01:23:00.360
<v Speaker 1>decisions that fucked everything up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first place and sit down and shut up</v>

1871
01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:02.820
<v Speaker 1>and those guys are already rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's even crazier.</v>

1872
01:23:02.821 --> 01:23:06.580
<v Speaker 1>You're giving rich people tons of money</v>
<v Speaker 1>after they fucked up and did a shitty</v>

1873
01:23:06.581 --> 01:23:11.440
<v Speaker 1>job and this goes back to why trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed appealing to so many people is</v>

1874
01:23:11.441 --> 01:23:13.270
<v Speaker 1>because you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1875
01:23:13.630 --> 01:23:16.700
<v Speaker 1>somebody who seems like a measured guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a smart guy and he said he was going</v>

1876
01:23:16.701 --> 01:23:19.360
<v Speaker 1>to change the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then he also fucking bailed out Wall</v>

1877
01:23:19.361 --> 01:23:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Street and people look at that and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1878
01:23:21.491 --> 01:23:22.420
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1879
01:23:22.421 --> 01:23:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Fucking anything but this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1880
01:23:24.341 --> 01:23:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Forget Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget the status quo.</v>

1881
01:23:26.291 --> 01:23:27.730
<v Speaker 1>I'll take the guy who's going to break</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1882
01:23:28.330 --> 01:23:30.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think there was something</v>

1883
01:23:30.101 --> 01:23:30.730
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1884
01:23:30.730 --> 01:23:33.400
<v Speaker 1>There was also that he didn't seem like</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them.</v>

1885
01:23:33.401 --> 01:23:37.360
<v Speaker 1>He seemed like something different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like let's try something different.</v>

1886
01:23:37.361 --> 01:23:40.390
<v Speaker 1>This is a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The old thing is not working.</v>

1887
01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:44.650
<v Speaker 1>This whole person who talks like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who gives these speeches in front of</v>

1888
01:23:44.651 --> 01:23:47.800
<v Speaker 1>large groups of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to promise you change and hope</v>

1889
01:23:48.010 --> 01:23:52.120
<v Speaker 1>and dignity and burn and vague words</v>
<v Speaker 1>that mean flowery things.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's on the radar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a Tan suit.</v>

1906
01:24:29.681 --> 01:24:30.940
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do it.</v>

1907
01:24:30.970 --> 01:24:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Don't you remember the Tan Suit Obama</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1909
01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:39.100
<v Speaker 4>To cover this event.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a very respectful gathering and</v>

1910
01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:46.820
<v Speaker 4>the purpose is very simple as I haven't</v>
<v Speaker 4>had the opportunity to campaign for over</v>

1911
01:24:52.110 --> 01:24:55.950
<v Speaker 4>a year and a half across this district.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The best part I think this</v>

1912
01:24:57.980 --> 01:24:58.813
<v Speaker 4>meeting,</v>

1913
01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:02.220
<v Speaker 1>check him out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going after his opponent when he</v>

1914
01:25:02.221 --> 01:25:03.950
<v Speaker 1>was running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really want to to your warning</v>

1915
01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.190
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about Medicare,</v>

1916
01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:07.560
<v Speaker 1>going to get this guy on adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1917
01:25:07.610 --> 01:25:11.170
<v Speaker 1>you've got to get them on those pills at</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's on them,</v>

1918
01:25:11.190 --> 01:25:13.930
<v Speaker 1>on those fucking energy pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really have like a lot,</v>

1919
01:25:13.931 --> 01:25:15.570
<v Speaker 1>a lot of vigor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of.</v>

1920
01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:19.430
<v Speaker 1>A lot of pep in your step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think trump's on pills 100 percent.</v>

1921
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:23.390
<v Speaker 1>You think he's on adderall?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's on something like that on</v>

1922
01:25:23.730 --> 01:25:26.550
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do really well.</v>

1923
01:25:26.551 --> 01:25:31.551
<v Speaker 1>Apparently there is a reporter that</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally named the pharmacy.</v>

1924
01:25:33.630 --> 01:25:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Where do the Duane Reed pharmacy where</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump had his prescription.</v>

1925
01:25:36.901 --> 01:25:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where he used to be on one form of</v>

1926
01:25:40.381 --> 01:25:42.900
<v Speaker 1>amphetamine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a diet pill supposed to be on</v>

1927
01:25:42.901 --> 01:25:44.370
<v Speaker 1>for six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on for years.</v>

1928
01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:47.580
<v Speaker 1>It completely makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talked about the amount of time that</v>

1929
01:25:47.581 --> 01:25:50.310
<v Speaker 1>guy spent on the campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 some odd year old guy out there</v>

<v Speaker 1>and let me tell you something.</v>

1932
01:25:54.210 --> 01:25:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Everybody that I know that did adderall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I had a good.</v>

1933
01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.500
<v Speaker 1>I have a good friend it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1934
01:25:58.501 --> 01:26:00.120
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have a good friend who was on it</v>

1935
01:26:00.121 --> 01:26:02.760
<v Speaker 1>for a long time and he got off at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gained 50.</v>

1936
01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:04.220
<v Speaker 1>He feels like it's hard</v>

1937
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:06.590
<v Speaker 2>for him like he but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said doctors,</v>

1938
01:26:06.591 --> 01:26:10.190
<v Speaker 2>we're just handing them this stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff and that one doctor gave him</v>

1939
01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:13.870
<v Speaker 2>three different amphetamines and told</v>
<v Speaker 2>him find the one that you liked the</v>

1940
01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:15.560
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a heart attack waiting to happen</v>

1941
01:26:15.561 --> 01:26:18.020
<v Speaker 2>if you take them all at once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jacked up on these things all the time.</v>

1942
01:26:18.021 --> 01:26:21.320
<v Speaker 2>And last time I saw him was like four</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago when he was jacked up on them</v>

1943
01:26:21.321 --> 01:26:21.951
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1944
01:26:21.951 --> 01:26:23.570
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

1945
01:26:23.571 --> 01:26:25.250
<v Speaker 2>ah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fucking on adderall.</v>

1946
01:26:25.251 --> 01:26:27.680
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kinda like out of it.</v>

1947
01:26:27.681 --> 01:26:28.241
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1948
01:26:28.241 --> 01:26:29.330
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1949
01:26:29.331 --> 01:26:31.850
<v Speaker 2>so he's now he's back to normal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's like,</v>

1950
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:36.320
<v Speaker 2>I eat anything and I gained weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the whole system's all screwed up.</v>

1951
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:41.350
<v Speaker 2>What is it about some people who can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a little bit of something and</v>

1952
01:26:41.991 --> 01:26:45.440
<v Speaker 2>experienced the upsides of it without</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting totally hooked by it because</v>

1953
01:26:45.441 --> 01:26:47.600
<v Speaker 2>that's something I feel like that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that I can do.</v>

1954
01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:51.950
<v Speaker 2>Like I could try something and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can experience the upsides of it and</v>

1955
01:26:51.951 --> 01:26:53.420
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1956
01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:55.700
<v Speaker 2>So productivity thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

1957
01:26:55.701 --> 01:26:56.730
<v Speaker 2>I brought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought you,</v>

1958
01:26:57.070 --> 01:27:01.040
<v Speaker 2>you said you already have a budget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Kratom I wanted to try a Kratom</v>

1959
01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:05.570
<v Speaker 2>Kratom something that I have and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>always feel like it,</v>

1960
01:27:06.170 --> 01:27:09.480
<v Speaker 2>it's like almost like caffeine to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it allows me to control,</v>

1961
01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:13.250
<v Speaker 2>control my consciousness better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I want to make a decision to do</v>

1962
01:27:13.251 --> 01:27:15.680
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like if I have Kratom in me,</v>

1963
01:27:15.681 --> 01:27:19.060
<v Speaker 2>I can focus on it more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be more creative and it's just</v>

1964
01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.600
<v Speaker 2>upsides of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1965
01:27:21.230 --> 01:27:22.580
<v Speaker 2>Is that how you feel when you smoke</v>
<v Speaker 2>weed?</v>

1966
01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1967
01:27:23.541 --> 01:27:27.440
<v Speaker 2>what we eat is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of different things is one of</v>

1968
01:27:27.441 --> 01:27:31.400
<v Speaker 2>the things that I like about weed that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people are terrified.</v>

1969
01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:36.440
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that people don't like</v>
<v Speaker 2>about weed is the intense introspective.</v>

1970
01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.690
<v Speaker 2>I get paranoid or yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

1971
01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:41.000
<v Speaker 2>But that I think is where you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>growth.</v>

1972
01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:42.201
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1973
01:27:42.201 --> 01:27:43.850
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that fear.</v>

1974
01:27:43.851 --> 01:27:46.370
<v Speaker 2>So do I have like demons in my past that</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

1975
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:50.060
<v Speaker 2>when I smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlike looking at that and I went away,</v>

1976
01:27:50.210 --> 01:27:54.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to psychoanalyze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like what from my own</v>

1977
01:27:54.021 --> 01:27:56.600
<v Speaker 2>personal view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I feel bad about something,</v>

1978
01:27:56.810 --> 01:27:59.960
<v Speaker 2>if I smoked pot and then all sudden I</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember something I did like two years</v>

1979
01:27:59.961 --> 01:28:00.471
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1980
01:28:00.471 --> 01:28:01.480
<v Speaker 2>why did I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1981
01:28:01.481 --> 01:28:02.630
<v Speaker 2>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck was that about?</v>

1982
01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.930
<v Speaker 2>I think that's an opportunity for</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychic growth.</v>

1983
01:28:05.931 --> 01:28:10.250
<v Speaker 2>It gives me an opportunity to examine my</v>
<v Speaker 2>own thoughts and try to figure out what.</v>

1984
01:28:10.510 --> 01:28:14.510
<v Speaker 2>What I mean like who you are at any</v>
<v Speaker 2>given time is a bunch of different</v>

1985
01:28:14.511 --> 01:28:15.200
<v Speaker 2>factors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1986
01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:19.550
<v Speaker 2>It's what's going on in your career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in your personal life,</v>

1987
01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:21.830
<v Speaker 2>where's your health at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how stressed out,</v>

1988
01:28:21.890 --> 01:28:25.610
<v Speaker 2>how many of these factors are outside of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your control with where's your what,</v>

1989
01:28:25.670 --> 01:28:29.600
<v Speaker 2>what's what's the state of your success</v>
<v Speaker 2>in life and all these various things and</v>

1990
01:28:29.601 --> 01:28:33.350
<v Speaker 2>then all those things together and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's who you are at any given time and</v>

1991
01:28:33.351 --> 01:28:34.370
<v Speaker 2>it fluctuates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It moves,</v>

1992
01:28:34.371 --> 01:28:36.890
<v Speaker 2>it goes back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you catch yourself at a good time</v>

1993
01:28:36.891 --> 01:28:39.140
<v Speaker 2>and you smoke pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel great and if you catch yourself</v>

1994
01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.780
<v Speaker 2>at a point where maybe you're examining</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>

1995
01:28:41.781 --> 01:28:44.660
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes you'll think about these</v>
<v Speaker 2>various factors and you get very</v>

1996
01:28:44.661 --> 01:28:48.740
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable and some in when you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a state just an hour ago where you</v>

1997
01:28:48.741 --> 01:28:52.130
<v Speaker 2>were super comfortable about your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now all of a sudden you're don't feel</v>

1998
01:28:52.131 --> 01:28:53.210
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is that?</v>

1999
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:55.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably there's some sort of</v>

2000
01:28:55.101 --> 01:29:00.101
<v Speaker 2>subconscious thoughts and ideas you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>ignored and I think the ignoring those</v>

2001
01:29:01.111 --> 01:29:02.400
<v Speaker 2>things is probably</v>

2002
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:07.550
<v Speaker 1>unhealthy and even though that feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>of paranoia or whatever you want want to</v>

2003
01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:10.740
<v Speaker 1>call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call it ruthless introspective</v>

2004
01:29:10.741 --> 01:29:11.574
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2005
01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:15.850
<v Speaker 1>That feeling is probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's healthy because it's,</v>

2006
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:20.990
<v Speaker 1>it's making you examine things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably pushing to the dark</v>

2007
01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:24.390
<v Speaker 1>regions of your consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't make them make you</v>

2008
01:29:24.391 --> 01:29:29.130
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable so you push them aside and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're better off explored and</v>

2009
01:29:29.131 --> 01:29:32.580
<v Speaker 1>dealt with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I feel I've always felt like</v>

2010
01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:38.060
<v Speaker 1>substances that either up my mood and</v>
<v Speaker 1>make me feel like I want to be very</v>

2011
01:29:39.301 --> 01:29:42.330
<v Speaker 1>proactive and creative and busy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>talkative,</v>

2012
01:29:42.690 --> 01:29:45.060
<v Speaker 1>fine with taking something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine with taking the opposite.</v>

2013
01:29:45.061 --> 01:29:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Something that relaxes me and makes me</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel just at ease and calm.</v>

2014
01:29:49.890 --> 01:29:53.330
<v Speaker 1>But I've always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with my limited experience with weed,</v>

2015
01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:56.520
<v Speaker 1>because I've only smoked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we honestly maybe eight to 12 times in</v>

2016
01:29:56.521 --> 01:29:57.690
<v Speaker 1>my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some right now.</v>

2017
01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:00.060
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will fucking shit myself and realize</v>

2018
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:05.070
<v Speaker 1>that there's millions of people watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>us right now and I'll realize that that</v>

2019
01:30:06.451 --> 01:30:08.640
<v Speaker 1>happens sometimes too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

2020
01:30:08.641 --> 01:30:12.690
<v Speaker 1>so I've always had an issue with</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoactive substances were so I've</v>

2021
01:30:12.691 --> 01:30:14.640
<v Speaker 1>never tried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all the ones that did drugs,</v>

2022
01:30:14.641 --> 01:30:16.860
<v Speaker 1>you talk on a regular basis like</v>
<v Speaker 1>psilocybin and stuff like that.</v>

2023
01:30:17.210 --> 01:30:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2024
01:30:18.290 --> 01:30:20.670
<v Speaker 1>I've always been scared of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2025
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:25.790
<v Speaker 1>and I always feel like the drugs that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will make me see things that aren't,</v>

2026
01:30:27.210 --> 01:30:31.490
<v Speaker 1>they're hallucinogenics I'm just scared</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them because I feel like I,</v>

2027
01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I'll take that trip and not come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2028
01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:38.280
<v Speaker 1>I know that I'm just wanting to bringing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it up to you because I know you disagree</v>

2029
01:30:38.281 --> 01:30:41.250
<v Speaker 1>with that and I'm curious what you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about why I'm scared of those because</v>

2030
01:30:41.251 --> 01:30:44.790
<v Speaker 1>with my experience with weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the times I smoked it,</v>

2031
01:30:45.630 --> 01:30:47.670
<v Speaker 1>it really was like a paranoid type.</v>

2032
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:49.110
<v Speaker 1>You probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2033
01:30:49.111 --> 01:30:52.050
<v Speaker 1>we probably smoked too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always did.</v>

2034
01:30:52.051 --> 01:30:54.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was advised people when the first time</v>

2035
01:30:54.631 --> 01:30:56.520
<v Speaker 1>they smoke pot just take one little hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2036
01:30:56.521 --> 01:30:59.250
<v Speaker 1>a little hit and just experience the</v>
<v Speaker 1>good parts,</v>

2037
01:30:59.251 --> 01:31:02.070
<v Speaker 1>which is like a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird kind of funny feeling.</v>

2038
01:31:02.430 --> 01:31:05.580
<v Speaker 1>And then there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's a turbo charger for</v>

2039
01:31:05.581 --> 01:31:08.130
<v Speaker 1>your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of my favorite things that</v>

2040
01:31:08.131 --> 01:31:08.840
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

2041
01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:11.640
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I already have a hyperactive</v>

2042
01:31:11.641 --> 01:31:14.010
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I met the path,</v>

2043
01:31:14.011 --> 01:31:17.430
<v Speaker 1>my mind will go down when I smoke weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2044
01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:19.260
<v Speaker 1>suddenly I'm thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2045
01:31:19.650 --> 01:31:23.410
<v Speaker 1>fucking naked vikings and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

2046
01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:23.941
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2047
01:31:23.941 --> 01:31:25.620
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck am I thinking about all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shit?</v>

2048
01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:28.890
<v Speaker 1>But it's like a shock to the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And did you um,</v>

2049
01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:31.470
<v Speaker 1>the first few times I smoked weed I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't get high.</v>

2050
01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Did that happen with you or no?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2051
01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:34.920
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta tie immediately.</v>

2052
01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Got Really High.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have a pretty funny story about</v>

2053
01:31:37.801 --> 01:31:38.640
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2054
01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:40.920
<v Speaker 1>the first few times I smoked it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was cool.</v>

2055
01:31:40.921 --> 01:31:42.090
<v Speaker 1>I was in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2056
01:31:42.091 --> 01:31:43.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be cool kid and smoke weed.</v>

2057
01:31:44.190 --> 01:31:47.880
<v Speaker 1>So I smoked it and didn't have any</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>

2058
01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:51.420
<v Speaker 1>And then by the third or fourth time</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody had asked me before I had</v>

2059
01:31:51.421 --> 01:31:52.480
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2060
01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:53.760
<v Speaker 1>you want to smoke weed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2061
01:31:53.761 --> 01:31:54.421
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

2062
01:31:54.421 --> 01:31:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't affect me the other a few</v>

2063
01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:57.750
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not went and smoked it.</v>

2064
01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:02.230
<v Speaker 1>I opened the to come back in school and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I start walking down the hallway.</v>

2065
01:32:02.290 --> 01:32:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Doom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doom,</v>

2066
01:32:04.110 --> 01:32:04.943
<v Speaker 1>doom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doom,</v>

2067
01:32:05.130 --> 01:32:06.410
<v Speaker 1>doom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guy was like,</v>

2068
01:32:06.490 --> 01:32:11.490
<v Speaker 1>bumbumbumbum feels weird and then I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting in class,</v>

2069
01:32:12.190 --> 01:32:16.210
<v Speaker 1>convinced my eyes are probably bloodshot</v>
<v Speaker 1>red in my mind.</v>

2070
01:32:16.210 --> 01:32:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Everybody in the room knows I'm high and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like thinking like,</v>

2071
01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:20.770
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this asshole's hi,</v>

2072
01:32:21.550 --> 01:32:24.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared to death of the teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway.</v>

2073
01:32:24.521 --> 01:32:26.980
<v Speaker 1>But there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a few times where I smoked</v>

2074
01:32:26.981 --> 01:32:29.560
<v Speaker 1>weed and I had a positive experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like all it was was just</v>

2075
01:32:29.561 --> 01:32:32.560
<v Speaker 1>giggling nonstop with my friends to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>point where we'd laugh,</v>

2076
01:32:32.561 --> 01:32:33.310
<v Speaker 1>laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laugh,</v>

2077
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:36.130
<v Speaker 1>and then I remember one of us literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking,</v>

2078
01:32:36.131 --> 01:32:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck are we laughing?</v>

2079
01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:39.280
<v Speaker 1>And somebody said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2080
01:32:39.281 --> 01:32:41.590
<v Speaker 1>And then we kept laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

2081
01:32:41.650 --> 01:32:43.420
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing to laugh.</v>

2082
01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:45.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the reasons why you don't</v>

2083
01:32:45.851 --> 01:32:48.580
<v Speaker 1>remember what you were laughing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real issue with short term</v>

2084
01:32:48.581 --> 01:32:50.490
<v Speaker 1>memory in marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2085
01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:54.640
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the reasons why I prefer</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana with nootropics.</v>

2086
01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:56.440
<v Speaker 1>I like the combination of the two.</v>

2087
01:32:56.440 --> 01:33:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I think they balanced each other out</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the nootropics accentuate your</v>

2088
01:33:00.341 --> 01:33:02.070
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>

2089
01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:04.540
<v Speaker 1>the marijuana sort of flux with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory a little bit.</v>

2090
01:33:05.050 --> 01:33:05.920
<v Speaker 1>If there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2091
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:07.120
<v Speaker 1>there's real issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2092
01:33:07.121 --> 01:33:10.510
<v Speaker 1>marijuana is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not 100 percent innocuous in terms</v>

2093
01:33:10.511 --> 01:33:12.100
<v Speaker 1>of your like psychics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stability.</v>

2094
01:33:12.130 --> 01:33:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Well you said when you took off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>month you had your dreams.</v>

2095
01:33:16.850 --> 01:33:19.060
<v Speaker 1>There were way different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were very,</v>

2096
01:33:19.061 --> 01:33:22.540
<v Speaker 1>very intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like within the first week it started</v>

2097
01:33:22.541 --> 01:33:25.480
<v Speaker 1>getting really crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like intense,</v>

2098
01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:30.800
<v Speaker 1>like weird lucid dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just very,</v>

2099
01:33:32.290 --> 01:33:37.270
<v Speaker 1>very bizarre and detailed and bright and</v>
<v Speaker 1>vivid.</v>

2100
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:42.870
<v Speaker 1>And so you think that it's one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things where that's not good.</v>

2101
01:33:43.210 --> 01:33:47.980
<v Speaker 1>So are you trying to avoid smoke weed a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little less so that you don't have the</v>

2102
01:33:47.981 --> 01:33:49.570
<v Speaker 1>effects on sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or do you like.</v>

2103
01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:52.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's bad for your sleep</v>
<v Speaker 1>and red.</v>

2104
01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2105
01:33:54.850 --> 01:33:57.400
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if uh,</v>

2106
01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:58.980
<v Speaker 1>see if he could pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

2107
01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:04.040
<v Speaker 1>What are the marijuana?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's some positive benefits to</v>

2108
01:34:05.891 --> 01:34:08.300
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just bypasses that rem sleep,</v>

2109
01:34:08.301 --> 01:34:11.590
<v Speaker 1>deep rem sleep quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you get to the deeper stages of</v>

2110
01:34:11.591 --> 01:34:14.760
<v Speaker 1>sleep because rem sleep a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>think is like the deepest levels.</v>

2111
01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:15.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2112
01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:19.630
<v Speaker 1>there's a deeper level of sleep and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea is that marijuana somehow or</v>

2113
01:34:19.631 --> 01:34:21.700
<v Speaker 1>another gets you to that deeper level</v>
<v Speaker 1>quicker.</v>

2114
01:34:21.850 --> 01:34:25.630
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that I know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke pot before they go to bed and it's</v>

2115
01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:27.250
<v Speaker 1>very helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2116
01:34:27.251 --> 01:34:29.230
<v Speaker 1>very helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the interesting things</v>

2117
01:34:29.231 --> 01:34:32.530
<v Speaker 1>about Kratom and why I think it's kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of similar to weed and how people use</v>

2118
01:34:32.531 --> 01:34:33.700
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though the feeling is different</v>

2119
01:34:33.701 --> 01:34:37.990
<v Speaker 1>when they take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that many people take it because they</v>

2120
01:34:37.991 --> 01:34:42.190
<v Speaker 1>were addicted to opioids and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it helps them get off the pills and on</v>

2121
01:34:42.191 --> 01:34:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Kratom if you have too much of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just throw it up.</v>

2122
01:34:44.261 --> 01:34:46.930
<v Speaker 1>If you have too many opioids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can die from an overdose.</v>

2123
01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:49.450
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of the reasons why the</v>
<v Speaker 1>FDA is cracking down on it because</v>

2124
01:34:49.451 --> 01:34:51.850
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking bought by big Pharma and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want anything that's going to</v>

2125
01:34:51.851 --> 01:34:53.350
<v Speaker 1>compete with their fucking profits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2126
01:34:53.351 --> 01:34:56.020
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason to ban that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no deaths.</v>

2127
01:34:56.050 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 1>There's no addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

2128
01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:59.720
<v Speaker 2>It's not something that's fucking people</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

2129
01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:02.670
<v Speaker 3>It's just not so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People take it for a cause.</v>

2130
01:35:02.671 --> 01:35:05.370
<v Speaker 3>They had an addiction to pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People take it for PTSD,</v>

2131
01:35:05.371 --> 01:35:08.970
<v Speaker 3>they take it for depression and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take for recreational reasons,</v>

2132
01:35:08.971 --> 01:35:10.860
<v Speaker 3>they take it to wake up in a smaller</v>
<v Speaker 3>dose.</v>

2133
01:35:10.861 --> 01:35:13.590
<v Speaker 3>They take it to sleep in a bigger dose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a substance like that.</v>

2134
01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:15.560
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird substance in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2135
01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:18.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't know any other substance where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you took a low dose and it's a stimulant</v>

2136
01:35:18.631 --> 01:35:22.110
<v Speaker 3>you until you always take a lower dose</v>
<v Speaker 3>of opioids.</v>

2137
01:35:22.111 --> 01:35:24.210
<v Speaker 3>It's more of an upper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take a bigger dose of opioids is</v>

2138
01:35:24.211 --> 01:35:26.280
<v Speaker 3>more of a downer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the rationalization for</v>

2139
01:35:26.281 --> 01:35:29.160
<v Speaker 3>categorizing it as an opioid?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it affects the same receptors in</v>

2140
01:35:29.161 --> 01:35:32.100
<v Speaker 3>the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't have the same response.</v>

2141
01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:33.720
<v Speaker 3>That will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why that's a very.</v>

2142
01:35:33.721 --> 01:35:37.380
<v Speaker 3>It's a very misleading thing that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>FDA did is because what they're trying</v>

2143
01:35:37.381 --> 01:35:39.170
<v Speaker 3>to do is find a backdoor way to be like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2144
01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:40.890
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys can't have it because it's an</v>

2145
01:35:40.891 --> 01:35:42.720
<v Speaker 3>opioid and it's dangerous and it's this</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this that,</v>

2146
01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:44.850
<v Speaker 3>but they're glossing over the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>important point,</v>

2147
01:35:44.851 --> 01:35:46.500
<v Speaker 3>which is the one that we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

2148
01:35:46.501 --> 01:35:48.960
<v Speaker 3>which is if you take too much Graham,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just throw up.</v>

2149
01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:51.390
<v Speaker 3>If that's not the case with opiates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just white people overdose all the</v>

2150
01:35:51.391 --> 01:35:55.620
<v Speaker 3>fucking time and actually the bigger</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem is that when people get addicted</v>

2151
01:35:55.621 --> 01:35:58.110
<v Speaker 3>to opioids and then because of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>crackdown,</v>

2152
01:35:58.111 --> 01:36:01.340
<v Speaker 3>now they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not prescribing as many opioids.</v>

2153
01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:04.350
<v Speaker 3>Then those same people go to the black</v>
<v Speaker 3>market and they get fucking heroin and</v>

2154
01:36:04.351 --> 01:36:06.180
<v Speaker 3>then when they get a heroin on the black</v>
<v Speaker 3>market,</v>

2155
01:36:06.181 --> 01:36:09.570
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes it's laced with fentanyl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a fucking elephant</v>

2156
01:36:09.571 --> 01:36:11.220
<v Speaker 3>tranquilizer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which then kills them.</v>

2157
01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:15.270
<v Speaker 3>So it's killed Tom Petty and princess</v>
<v Speaker 3>here and Philip Seymour Hoffman.</v>

2158
01:36:15.330 --> 01:36:17.550
<v Speaker 3>They were speculating that defendant was</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his heroin,</v>

2159
01:36:17.551 --> 01:36:19.950
<v Speaker 3>which is why he died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was heroin.</v>

2160
01:36:19.951 --> 01:36:20.784
<v Speaker 3>Heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2161
01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:21.990
<v Speaker 3>He didn't have pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>

2162
01:36:21.991 --> 01:36:22.351
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2163
01:36:22.351 --> 01:36:23.640
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was doing heroin,</v>

2164
01:36:23.650 --> 01:36:27.520
<v Speaker 2>but the stuff that they found,</v>
<v Speaker 2>princess system,</v>

2165
01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:29.980
<v Speaker 2>he apparently didn't even have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>prescription for fentanyl.</v>

2166
01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:32.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're saying somehow somehow or</v>

2167
01:36:32.551 --> 01:36:33.720
<v Speaker 2>another he got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2168
01:36:34.150 --> 01:36:37.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean probably want something stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He apparently had fucked his hips up.</v>

2169
01:36:37.930 --> 01:36:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Prince Prince had done all that crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>dancing on stage and all those years,</v>

2170
01:36:42.970 --> 01:36:43.803
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2171
01:36:43.930 --> 01:36:47.770
<v Speaker 2>my friend maynard from tool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had to get a hip replacement from</v>

2172
01:36:47.771 --> 01:36:51.040
<v Speaker 2>stomping on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever see like how maynard sayings</v>

2173
01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:54.430
<v Speaker 2>when he would sing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would just be fucking stomping on</v>

2174
01:36:54.431 --> 01:36:55.720
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He blew his hip out.</v>

2175
01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:58.270
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he's got an artificial hip.</v>

2176
01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:00.610
<v Speaker 2>They cut the top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How old is he?</v>

2177
01:37:01.630 --> 01:37:03.310
<v Speaker 2>Fifty 51.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

2178
01:37:03.610 --> 01:37:05.050
<v Speaker 2>Human body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fucking fragile.</v>

2179
01:37:05.110 --> 01:37:06.670
<v Speaker 2>It is super fragile</v>

2180
01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:08.730
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's going to be like,</v>

2181
01:37:08.731 --> 01:37:10.770
<v Speaker 3>shut the fuck up kyle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't stop talking about Tiger Woods</v>

2182
01:37:10.771 --> 01:37:12.060
<v Speaker 3>because I love golf and I love Tiger</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woods.</v>

2183
01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:15.780
<v Speaker 3>Tiger Woods is a great example of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy had fucking for baxter surgeries.</v>

2184
01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:17.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for back surgery.</v>

2185
01:37:17.650 --> 01:37:19.060
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people that have had</v>

2186
01:37:19.061 --> 01:37:22.190
<v Speaker 2>back surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My good friend Eddie Bravo has an</v>

2187
01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:24.430
<v Speaker 2>artificial disc in his back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

2188
01:37:24.431 --> 01:37:26.380
<v Speaker 2>And he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He still do Jujitsu.</v>

2189
01:37:26.381 --> 01:37:28.840
<v Speaker 2>And and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't right now because he blew his</v>

2190
01:37:28.841 --> 01:37:31.570
<v Speaker 2>acl out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He to have acl reconstructive surgery.</v>

2191
01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:32.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2192
01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:37.030
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is rough on the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had two knee reconstructions,</v>

2193
01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:41.220
<v Speaker 2>one from taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one from one from a Jujitsu.</v>

2194
01:37:41.230 --> 01:37:43.900
<v Speaker 2>But then I had a third operation from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu as well.</v>

2195
01:37:43.901 --> 01:37:48.901
<v Speaker 2>So two knee surgeries from Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had some significant back problems</v>

2196
01:37:49.091 --> 01:37:50.600
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody gets them just,</v>

2197
01:37:50.601 --> 01:37:51.850
<v Speaker 2>there's no way around that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>

2198
01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:55.060
<v Speaker 2>if you're training hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body can only take so much.</v>

2199
01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:57.990
<v Speaker 2>And you were talking about the stem</v>
<v Speaker 2>cells that you saw,</v>

2200
01:37:57.991 --> 01:37:59.880
<v Speaker 2>the podcast with Mel Gibson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the stem cells.</v>

2201
01:37:59.881 --> 01:38:02.400
<v Speaker 2>How is it fascinating?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't gone the Panama yet to do</v>

2202
01:38:02.401 --> 01:38:02.970
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2203
01:38:02.970 --> 01:38:04.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only done them in America,</v>

2204
01:38:04.411 --> 01:38:07.290
<v Speaker 2>which apparently you can't get the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of potency,</v>

2205
01:38:07.291 --> 01:38:10.530
<v Speaker 2>but there's some new research that shows</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's some,</v>

2206
01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:12.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some other stuff they're working</v>

2207
01:38:12.151 --> 01:38:15.240
<v Speaker 2>on now that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sounds gross,</v>

2208
01:38:15.241 --> 01:38:18.350
<v Speaker 2>but umbilical blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2209
01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:21.480
<v Speaker 2>they're using blood from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2210
01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:24.630
<v Speaker 2>from umbilicals of people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2211
01:38:24.631 --> 01:38:29.160
<v Speaker 2>like just giving birth and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>having radical healing response with</v>

2212
01:38:29.161 --> 01:38:30.150
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2213
01:38:30.151 --> 01:38:32.550
<v Speaker 2>there was a study that came out a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago that said when you took the</v>

2214
01:38:32.551 --> 01:38:34.270
<v Speaker 2>blood of young mice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

2215
01:38:34.330 --> 01:38:37.020
<v Speaker 2>and put them into all my different</v>
<v Speaker 2>context.</v>

2216
01:38:37.490 --> 01:38:38.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a.</v>

2217
01:38:38.761 --> 01:38:42.060
<v Speaker 2>that's something that erroneously was</v>
<v Speaker 2>attributed to Peter Teal.</v>

2218
01:38:42.061 --> 01:38:44.220
<v Speaker 2>The Peter Teal was doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently he said he wasn't,</v>

2219
01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:48.000
<v Speaker 2>but there's a startup in silicon valley</v>
<v Speaker 2>that does that.</v>

2220
01:38:48.210 --> 01:38:52.770
<v Speaker 2>It offers and guys are going there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like a guy would go there and some 25</v>

2221
01:38:52.771 --> 01:38:56.130
<v Speaker 2>year old kid who does crossfit everyday</v>
<v Speaker 2>would give up a couple of pints of blood</v>

2222
01:38:56.131 --> 01:38:59.250
<v Speaker 2>and they'd shoot it into your system and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you go out there and fuck the shit</v>

2223
01:38:59.251 --> 01:39:00.084
<v Speaker 2>out of your wife.</v>

2224
01:39:00.410 --> 01:39:01.770
<v Speaker 2>It can't be that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2225
01:39:01.771 --> 01:39:05.190
<v Speaker 2>Like that's almost too simple a concept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just take the blood for the young</v>

2226
01:39:05.191 --> 01:39:06.810
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it into the old people and</v>

2227
01:39:06.811 --> 01:39:08.940
<v Speaker 2>everybody's a fucking Olympic athlete</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>

2228
01:39:08.941 --> 01:39:09.691
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe.</v>

2229
01:39:09.691 --> 01:39:11.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a vampire too,</v>

2230
01:39:11.191 --> 01:39:12.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that like the whole theory?</v>

2231
01:39:12.421 --> 01:39:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elizabeth bathory thing,</v>

2232
01:39:15.301 --> 01:39:17.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember the story of Elizabeth</v>

2233
01:39:17.191 --> 01:39:18.150
<v Speaker 2>bathory?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2234
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:20.820
<v Speaker 2>she was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

2235
01:39:20.821 --> 01:39:25.821
<v Speaker 2>Somebody contacted me on twitter and</v>
<v Speaker 2>told me that this story might be a</v>

2236
01:39:27.691 --> 01:39:29.290
<v Speaker 2>distortion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it's in the,</v>

2237
01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:33.750
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of in the historical record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might've actually been trying to</v>

2238
01:39:33.751 --> 01:39:36.210
<v Speaker 2>steal her land so they might have</v>
<v Speaker 2>fabricated some of these charges.</v>

2239
01:39:36.570 --> 01:39:37.710
<v Speaker 2>But one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2240
01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:42.240
<v Speaker 2>the ancient stories of Elizabeth battery</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that she was this incredibly evil</v>

2241
01:39:42.241 --> 01:39:47.241
<v Speaker 2>woman that as she got older she would</v>
<v Speaker 2>torture and kill young peasant women and</v>

2242
01:39:48.190 --> 01:39:53.190
<v Speaker 2>like bathe in their blood because she</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to regain her youth and she was</v>

2243
01:39:53.641 --> 01:39:54.560
<v Speaker 2>jealous of these.</v>

2244
01:39:54.770 --> 01:39:55.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2245
01:39:55.141 --> 01:39:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's real though.</v>

2246
01:39:57.060 --> 01:40:00.390
<v Speaker 2>This person who said that it was a hoax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a made me go,</v>

2247
01:40:00.450 --> 01:40:01.830
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2248
01:40:01.831 --> 01:40:03.570
<v Speaker 2>I could see that happening to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2249
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:08.010
<v Speaker 2>where someone wanted to steal from her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they concocted some charges or it</v>

2250
01:40:08.011 --> 01:40:09.660
<v Speaker 2>could be either or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be both.</v>

2251
01:40:09.690 --> 01:40:10.650
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck knows?</v>

2252
01:40:10.830 --> 01:40:12.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the stem cell thing,</v>

2253
01:40:12.061 --> 01:40:17.061
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it should be here already if</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evidence is as solid as he was.</v>

2254
01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:19.740
<v Speaker 2>The doctor was saying yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2255
01:40:19.770 --> 01:40:23.370
<v Speaker 2>the evidence is very solid that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>some regenerative properties of stem</v>

2256
01:40:23.371 --> 01:40:26.490
<v Speaker 2>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is we don't have enough</v>

2257
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:31.550
<v Speaker 2>evidence of what the potential downsides</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be and whether or not there's a</v>

2258
01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:34.740
<v Speaker 2>very specific protocol that ensures</v>
<v Speaker 2>safety.</v>

2259
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:38.670
<v Speaker 2>Now Dr Neil Riordan is on top of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff and his books,</v>

2260
01:40:38.970 --> 01:40:40.380
<v Speaker 2>we used to have them sitting around</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

2261
01:40:40.381 --> 01:40:41.910
<v Speaker 2>but I think we put them in our little</v>
<v Speaker 2>library.</v>

2262
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his books,</v>

2263
01:40:43.681 --> 01:40:48.600
<v Speaker 2>detail all of the various studies that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have shown efficacy and all the</v>

2264
01:40:48.601 --> 01:40:51.900
<v Speaker 2>different benefits that they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for a lot of people like Mel</v>

2265
01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:53.920
<v Speaker 2>Gibson's dad who was two when he went in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2266
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:57.640
<v Speaker 1>now he's almost a hundred and Mel</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gibson's dad was fucked.</v>

2267
01:40:57.641 --> 01:41:00.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean he couldn't walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was all jacked up and it straightened</v>

2268
01:41:00.551 --> 01:41:03.460
<v Speaker 1>them right out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not to get all conspiratorial,</v>

2269
01:41:03.461 --> 01:41:05.740
<v Speaker 1>but it may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may be,</v>

2270
01:41:05.741 --> 01:41:08.590
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe the reason why it has not</v>

2271
01:41:08.591 --> 01:41:13.591
<v Speaker 1>already here is because there's some</v>
<v Speaker 1>preexisting treatment for stuff like</v>

2272
01:41:14.681 --> 01:41:17.760
<v Speaker 1>that that they don't want to scrap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know what I mean?</v>

2273
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:19.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always possible.</v>

2274
01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I think more likely they're skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the FDA also wanted to</v>

2275
01:41:24.161 --> 01:41:29.140
<v Speaker 1>categorize some stem cell preparations</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a drug because you have to do</v>

2276
01:41:29.141 --> 01:41:31.450
<v Speaker 1>something to the stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>

2277
01:41:31.470 --> 01:41:33.880
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the process of cultivating them,</v>

2278
01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:35.320
<v Speaker 1>there's some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2279
01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:40.450
<v Speaker 1>a method that they do that they believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>categorizes it as a drug.</v>

2280
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:44.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm obviously a moron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not the right person telling you</v>

2281
01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:44.923
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

2282
01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:50.080
<v Speaker 1>But Dr Neil Riordan is lobbying to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>it passed in Texas.</v>

2283
01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:52.030
<v Speaker 1>God Damn Great State of Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hallelujah.</v>

2284
01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:53.960
<v Speaker 1>If anybody can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas can do.</v>

2285
01:41:53.961 --> 01:41:54.960
<v Speaker 1>If they don't go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2286
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:56.740
<v Speaker 1>they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't give a fuck.</v>

2287
01:41:56.741 --> 01:42:00.340
<v Speaker 1>It's barely America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Texas is it's own thing.</v>

2288
01:42:00.341 --> 01:42:02.920
<v Speaker 1>I would love it if they did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they did it where you could go to</v>

2289
01:42:02.921 --> 01:42:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Texas and get these treatments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody that I know that it's gone</v>

2290
01:42:05.471 --> 01:42:08.710
<v Speaker 1>over there and gotten the treatments has</v>
<v Speaker 1>had some radical positive response.</v>

2291
01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know quite a few people that have</v>

2292
01:42:10.301 --> 01:42:11.260
<v Speaker 1>gone there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>

2293
01:42:11.261 --> 01:42:16.090
<v Speaker 1>I know countless stories of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know somebody who got the lasik eye</v>

2294
01:42:16.091 --> 01:42:21.091
<v Speaker 1>surgery and they flew to the UK to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>their version of it because their</v>

2295
01:42:22.571 --> 01:42:27.250
<v Speaker 1>version of it is on his is better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is superior and we have the older one</v>

2296
01:42:27.251 --> 01:42:30.280
<v Speaker 1>here and they're still waiting on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>approval for the new way of doing it.</v>

2297
01:42:30.370 --> 01:42:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Well why would they hold back approval</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that?</v>

2298
01:42:32.141 --> 01:42:33.580
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2299
01:42:33.790 --> 01:42:36.460
<v Speaker 1>And this is what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like in many instances,</v>

2300
01:42:36.461 --> 01:42:39.010
<v Speaker 1>not in every instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in many instances you have to</v>

2301
01:42:39.011 --> 01:42:42.880
<v Speaker 1>preexisting treatments that are already</v>
<v Speaker 1>in place and there and pharmaceutical</v>

2302
01:42:42.881 --> 01:42:45.970
<v Speaker 1>companies make a lot of money from</v>
<v Speaker 1>having those treatments already in</v>

2303
01:42:45.971 --> 01:42:48.340
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you try to upend the apple cart</v>

2304
01:42:48.341 --> 01:42:49.740
<v Speaker 1>overturn the apple cart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's.</v>

2305
01:42:49.810 --> 01:42:51.400
<v Speaker 1>This gets back to the whole kratom</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

2306
01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:54.520
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this is something that's basically a</v>

2307
01:42:54.521 --> 01:42:58.900
<v Speaker 1>cure for addiction to opioids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck are we not pushing it like</v>

2308
01:42:58.901 --> 01:43:01.510
<v Speaker 1>crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is they don't want to</v>

2309
01:43:01.511 --> 01:43:03.040
<v Speaker 1>start making money off the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>opioids.</v>

2310
01:43:03.370 --> 01:43:05.740
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is a much more likely</v>

2311
01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:09.790
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy because there's just an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ungodly amount of money and opioid.</v>

2312
01:43:09.810 --> 01:43:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so look at the pill mills and fucking</v>

2313
01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:13.990
<v Speaker 1>West Virginia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Millions of pills in a town that doesn't</v>

2314
01:43:13.991 --> 01:43:17.350
<v Speaker 1>have that many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see the documentary,</v>

2315
01:43:17.351 --> 01:43:19.600
<v Speaker 1>the Oxycontin Express?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not know.</v>

2316
01:43:19.630 --> 01:43:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually I may.</v>

2317
01:43:20.770 --> 01:43:22.600
<v Speaker 1>May Have the one where they go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Broward County.</v>

2318
01:43:22.930 --> 01:43:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I saw that they've changed the</v>

2319
01:43:24.551 --> 01:43:27.400
<v Speaker 1>law since then because people were going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2320
01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:31.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was one of the most ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 1>things they've ever had in this country.</v>

2321
01:43:31.061 --> 01:43:33.640
<v Speaker 1>They had a setup where they had these</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain management centers,</v>

2322
01:43:33.850 --> 01:43:35.680
<v Speaker 1>so is one box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2323
01:43:35.681 --> 01:43:38.410
<v Speaker 1>One building and in this building</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two different doors.</v>

2324
01:43:38.590 --> 01:43:40.450
<v Speaker 1>One door is the doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to the doctor,</v>

2325
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:41.430
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

2326
01:43:41.431 --> 01:43:43.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking back hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the doctor says,</v>

2327
01:43:43.331 --> 01:43:44.560
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll write you a prescription.</v>

2328
01:43:44.770 --> 01:43:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Go next door to the pharmacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pharmacy only has oxicon.</v>

2329
01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you only have a hammer,</v>

2330
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:55.460
<v Speaker 1>everything looks like a nail and hammer</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

2331
01:43:55.890 --> 01:43:57.540
<v Speaker 1>How am I going to chop this tree down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well guess what?</v>

2332
01:43:57.541 --> 01:44:02.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to use a hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's fucking crazy that this was</v>

2333
01:44:02.361 --> 01:44:06.530
<v Speaker 1>going on for so long and then they also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where it got really weird.</v>

2334
01:44:06.710 --> 01:44:08.900
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just the of these pain</v>
<v Speaker 1>management centers,</v>

2335
01:44:08.901 --> 01:44:13.901
<v Speaker 1>they also didn't have a state database,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you went to Jamie over there and</v>

2336
01:44:14.061 --> 01:44:18.860
<v Speaker 1>got a prescription for Oxycontin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you left Dr Jamie's office with fat</v>

2337
01:44:18.861 --> 01:44:21.410
<v Speaker 1>bag of pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could go to Dr Joe's office and I'll</v>

2338
01:44:21.411 --> 01:44:24.350
<v Speaker 1>give you another prescription.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These pain management centers were all</v>

2339
01:44:24.351 --> 01:44:27.170
<v Speaker 1>over the place in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Florida was literally.</v>

2340
01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Because I mean there's no other way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could imagine that this would be done</v>

2341
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:34.880
<v Speaker 1>conscientiously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is all corruption.</v>

2342
01:44:35.090 --> 01:44:38.450
<v Speaker 1>I think the only reason why they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have no database.</v>

2343
01:44:38.650 --> 01:44:40.770
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not in the 15 hundreds measure.</v>

2344
01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:44.870
<v Speaker 1>You guys could keep records of WHO's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking on this shit and who's not.</v>

2345
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.861
<v Speaker 1>There's a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2346
01:44:45.861 --> 01:44:47.870
<v Speaker 1>they had records back before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

2347
01:44:48.550 --> 01:44:50.240
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no excuse for this.</v>

2348
01:44:50.330 --> 01:44:54.080
<v Speaker 1>This is I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intentional corruption and what's crazy</v>

2349
01:44:54.081 --> 01:44:57.410
<v Speaker 1>is now the pendulum is swinging almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>too far in the other direction.</v>

2350
01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Ohio Attorney General Suing opiod use</v>
<v Speaker 1>distributors.</v>

2351
01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a good example of what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think is the pendulum swinging too far</v>

2352
01:45:05.331 --> 01:45:09.050
<v Speaker 1>in the other direction because I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain patients who contact me all the</v>

2353
01:45:09.051 --> 01:45:13.910
<v Speaker 1>time and they talk about how since</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's new federal regulations over the</v>

2354
01:45:13.911 --> 01:45:15.950
<v Speaker 1>pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening is many doctors are</v>

2355
01:45:15.951 --> 01:45:18.980
<v Speaker 1>afraid to prescribe them at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when it's a legitimate pain issue</v>

2356
01:45:19.190 --> 01:45:22.850
<v Speaker 1>and so people contact me and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to do because I need</v>

2357
01:45:22.851 --> 01:45:26.510
<v Speaker 1>my pills because I have severe pain</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem and I've had it for an extended</v>

2358
01:45:26.511 --> 01:45:29.150
<v Speaker 1>period of time and nobody wants to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>me the pills anymore and they feel like</v>

2359
01:45:29.151 --> 01:45:30.490
<v Speaker 1>they're forced to go on the black market</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2360
01:45:30.930 --> 01:45:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2361
01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:34.550
<v Speaker 1>and now that they're eliminating Kratom</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's even more fucked up.</v>

2362
01:45:34.551 --> 01:45:37.460
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is the status of Kratom</v>

2363
01:45:37.490 --> 01:45:38.600
<v Speaker 1>currently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still legal.</v>

2364
01:45:38.630 --> 01:45:39.860
<v Speaker 1>Still legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still legal,</v>

2365
01:45:39.861 --> 01:45:42.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's a monitored substance by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>FDA.</v>

2366
01:45:42.410 --> 01:45:44.720
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It basically means if they want to,</v>

2367
01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:47.620
<v Speaker 1>they see fucking shipments of it when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes into the US,</v>

2368
01:45:47.670 --> 01:45:50.420
<v Speaker 1>if they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they want to get that shipment back.</v>

2369
01:45:50.690 --> 01:45:52.160
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get it back off,</v>

2370
01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:53.820
<v Speaker 1>back off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to take your beneficial</v>

2371
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:55.040
<v Speaker 1>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still.</v>

2372
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Thankfully it's still it still leeway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last time the FDA really tried to</v>

2373
01:45:59.631 --> 01:46:01.430
<v Speaker 1>crack down on it and make it a schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One drug,</v>

2374
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:05.480
<v Speaker 1>the fucking bowels of hell opened up on</v>
<v Speaker 1>their face because they opened up a</v>

2375
01:46:05.481 --> 01:46:09.770
<v Speaker 1>comment section,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a comments period and like 99 point nine</v>

2376
01:46:09.771 --> 01:46:12.590
<v Speaker 1>percent of the comments were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you to saved my life.</v>

2377
01:46:12.590 --> 01:46:14.960
<v Speaker 1>You guys are fucking criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you do this?</v>

2378
01:46:15.110 --> 01:46:18.260
<v Speaker 1>And then they had to back off because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the comments were just so overwhelming.</v>

2379
01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:21.770
<v Speaker 1>So now they're trying to sneakily do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

2380
01:46:21.771 --> 01:46:24.110
<v Speaker 1>And what's happening is they just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>referenced,</v>

2381
01:46:24.380 --> 01:46:26.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were 44 cases of somebody who</v>

2382
01:46:26.361 --> 01:46:30.020
<v Speaker 1>overdosed from Kratom multistate</v>
<v Speaker 1>outbreak of Salmonella.</v>

2383
01:46:30.170 --> 01:46:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is related to creative.</v>

2384
01:46:32.270 --> 01:46:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there were a few cases of Salmonella</v>

2385
01:46:35.331 --> 01:46:37.970
<v Speaker 1>tainted Kratom and so the idea is</v>
<v Speaker 1>another way they try to go up,</v>

2386
01:46:37.971 --> 01:46:39.430
<v Speaker 1>like we gotta get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we gotta get rid of it because there is</v>

2387
01:46:39.431 --> 01:46:42.770
<v Speaker 1>some salmonella cases at this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The CDC recommends that people not</v>

2388
01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:46.340
<v Speaker 1>consumed Kratom in any form because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be contaminated with Salmonella.</v>

2389
01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:49.920
<v Speaker 1>We instead suggest fentanyl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which kills rhinos.</v>

2390
01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:56.870
<v Speaker 1>We could kill fucking whale with a with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a altoids size piece of fentanyl.</v>

2391
01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:01.770
<v Speaker 1>They literally kill a whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that will be fucked.</v>

2392
01:47:02.190 --> 01:47:03.890
<v Speaker 1>An altoid show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said Doris,</v>

2393
01:47:04.050 --> 01:47:06.930
<v Speaker 1>they said there were 44 deaths linked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kratom.</v>

2394
01:47:06.990 --> 01:47:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Twenty eight cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Few people got diarrhea,</v>

2395
01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:11.700
<v Speaker 1>but we'll have in hospice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2396
01:47:11.730 --> 01:47:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Eleven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 hospitalizations.</v>

2397
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.320
<v Speaker 1>The story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets crazier because there were 44</v>

2398
01:47:16.321 --> 01:47:18.750
<v Speaker 1>cases that the they cited and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look man,</v>

2399
01:47:18.751 --> 01:47:20.730
<v Speaker 1>44 cases of people dying when they took</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kratom.</v>

2400
01:47:21.020 --> 01:47:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No reporters decided,</v>

2401
01:47:23.250 --> 01:47:25.320
<v Speaker 1>let's look into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's dig deeper and see what happened.</v>

2402
01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:28.740
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the cases was a suicide that they</v>

2403
01:47:28.741 --> 01:47:30.570
<v Speaker 1>counted as a death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're attributing to Kratom.</v>

2404
01:47:30.630 --> 01:47:32.730
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another was a homicide.</v>

2405
01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:36.140
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so now we're going on 42.</v>

2406
01:47:36.450 --> 01:47:39.390
<v Speaker 1>There were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then most of them people had like</v>

2407
01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:43.410
<v Speaker 1>five or six different drugs in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>system and they're saying not dad's</v>

2408
01:47:43.450 --> 01:47:44.283
<v Speaker 1>Kratom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2409
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:47.010
<v Speaker 1>well that's one of the things that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>did with marijuana and car accidents.</v>

2410
01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:48.091
<v Speaker 1>They were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2411
01:47:48.091 --> 01:47:50.370
<v Speaker 1>all these different car accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have marijuana in the system.</v>

2412
01:47:50.371 --> 01:47:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they were also a drunk.</v>

2413
01:47:51.540 --> 01:47:52.261
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2414
01:47:52.261 --> 01:47:53.190
<v Speaker 1>People were partying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2415
01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:56.070
<v Speaker 1>that they're out of their fucking head</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they crashed into trees.</v>

2416
01:47:56.250 --> 01:47:58.860
<v Speaker 1>So it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel now that California has</v>

2417
01:47:58.861 --> 01:48:01.350
<v Speaker 1>legalized it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it because you had the medical one</v>

2418
01:48:01.351 --> 01:48:05.070
<v Speaker 1>before and now is it more of a pain in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ass to get weed?</v>

2419
01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Because it's legalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very easy to get weed and</v>

2420
01:48:07.591 --> 01:48:09.420
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very easy.</v>

2421
01:48:09.421 --> 01:48:12.540
<v Speaker 1>It's not as easy as in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado's got a down.</v>

2422
01:48:12.810 --> 01:48:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Colorado's got it nailed and they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>swimming,</v>

2423
01:48:16.051 --> 01:48:19.410
<v Speaker 1>swimming in money coming to the point</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they have to give people money.</v>

2424
01:48:19.411 --> 01:48:20.580
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2425
01:48:20.581 --> 01:48:23.160
<v Speaker 1>They gave a check to everybody in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>state and they take.</v>

2426
01:48:23.190 --> 01:48:26.880
<v Speaker 1>I love how they take a lot of the money</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they divert some of it to education,</v>

2427
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.190
<v Speaker 1>some of it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to substance treatment.</v>

2428
01:48:29.550 --> 01:48:32.160
<v Speaker 1>So they're doing the most responsible</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing for it and like you said,</v>

2429
01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:35.220
<v Speaker 1>they the tax on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like,</v>

2430
01:48:35.221 --> 01:48:36.240
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2431
01:48:36.580 --> 01:48:37.413
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2432
01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:38.453
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's.</v>

2433
01:48:38.490 --> 01:48:42.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a high tax rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they have a 39 percent tax rate</v>

2434
01:48:42.150 --> 01:48:45.720
<v Speaker 1>on a recreational and I think it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>an 11 on medicinal,</v>

2435
01:48:45.870 --> 01:48:48.510
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not exorbitantly expensive.</v>

2436
01:48:48.570 --> 01:48:51.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a plant that grows easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not hard to grow.</v>

2437
01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:56.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not like some very difficult grape</v>
<v Speaker 1>that needs a perfect climate and it's</v>

2438
01:48:57.450 --> 01:48:59.520
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana is not hard to grow,</v>

2439
01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:04.590
<v Speaker 1>so there's not a lot of arguments</v>
<v Speaker 1>against it for responsible adults.</v>

2440
01:49:04.930 --> 01:49:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the thing is are we going to</v>

2441
01:49:07.171 --> 01:49:10.740
<v Speaker 1>regulate responsible adult use of</v>
<v Speaker 1>substances?</v>

2442
01:49:10.741 --> 01:49:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Because if we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd be hypocritical if we didn't</v>

2443
01:49:13.171 --> 01:49:14.850
<v Speaker 1>eliminate alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>

2444
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:16.140
<v Speaker 1>One of the worst ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look,</v>

2445
01:49:16.170 --> 01:49:19.200
<v Speaker 1>if you look at it objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have to say,</v>

2446
01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:22.470
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this substance which is legal and has</v>

2447
01:49:22.471 --> 01:49:26.100
<v Speaker 1>been legal for a very long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually more dangerous than many of</v>

2448
01:49:26.101 --> 01:49:29.790
<v Speaker 1>these ones that are illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we learned from alcohol prohibition.</v>

2449
01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:34.050
<v Speaker 1>How terrible and idea is to just ban the</v>
<v Speaker 1>substance because what happened during</v>

2450
01:49:34.051 --> 01:49:36.960
<v Speaker 1>prohibition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mafia got incredibly powerful</v>

2451
01:49:37.110 --> 01:49:39.240
<v Speaker 1>because they're the ones selling the</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>

2452
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:42.210
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones making the money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when you have a dispute and</v>

2453
01:49:42.211 --> 01:49:45.180
<v Speaker 1>your product is on the black market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how you solve that dispute with</v>

2454
01:49:45.181 --> 01:49:47.040
<v Speaker 1>fucking guns in the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2455
01:49:47.170 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 1>you solve the dispute.</v>

2456
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:50.620
<v Speaker 3>If it's illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to court wearing suits and ties</v>

2457
01:49:50.650 --> 01:49:52.600
<v Speaker 3>and you figure it out like adults.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2458
01:49:52.601 --> 01:49:57.601
<v Speaker 3>this is another thing that trump should</v>
<v Speaker 3>have recognized when he was sessions is</v>

2459
01:49:57.900 --> 01:50:00.340
<v Speaker 3>a perfect example that God is a God damn</v>
<v Speaker 3>monster.</v>

2460
01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:03.790
<v Speaker 3>He's an easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an old school mentality of like,</v>

2461
01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:07.600
<v Speaker 3>I was raised my niche wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you put substances in your body where</v>

2462
01:50:07.601 --> 01:50:10.000
<v Speaker 3>he literally said good people don't use</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana.</v>

2463
01:50:10.150 --> 01:50:11.380
<v Speaker 3>Well that's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

2464
01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:13.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can stick a moral judgment on you</v>

2465
01:50:13.061 --> 01:50:15.190
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's something like 37</v>

2466
01:50:15.191 --> 01:50:18.130
<v Speaker 3>percent of the country is a regular</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana user.</v>

2467
01:50:18.131 --> 01:50:20.500
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying 37 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>country's bad people.</v>

2468
01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:21.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2469
01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:23.050
<v Speaker 3>And this is another example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

2470
01:50:23.051 --> 01:50:27.550
<v Speaker 3>have 60 percent of people now want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>legalize marijuana across the country.</v>

2471
01:50:28.030 --> 01:50:31.210
<v Speaker 3>So this is another issue where if the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Democrats decided,</v>

2472
01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:35.020
<v Speaker 3>let's not be fucking corrupt idiots and</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's actually fight for something,</v>

2473
01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:38.800
<v Speaker 3>do you have any idea how big of a ballou</v>
<v Speaker 3>tsunami there would be in the next</v>

2474
01:50:38.801 --> 01:50:39.460
<v Speaker 3>election?</v>

2475
01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:42.200
<v Speaker 3>If every Democrat came out there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>said one of the things were far</v>

2476
01:50:42.250 --> 01:50:44.230
<v Speaker 3>legalizing marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to fight for it and we're</v>

2477
01:50:44.231 --> 01:50:46.740
<v Speaker 3>not going to take no for an answer and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna make a lot of money that can</v>

2478
01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:48.980
<v Speaker 3>go to the schools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can go to the infrastructure as</v>

2479
01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:53.980
<v Speaker 3>code and the job creation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are arguments that also appeal to</v>

2480
01:50:53.981 --> 01:50:55.780
<v Speaker 3>the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you tell people on the right,</v>

2481
01:50:55.781 --> 01:50:57.400
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys say you love small government,</v>

2482
01:50:57.700 --> 01:51:00.700
<v Speaker 3>you know what's really big government</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they knocked down your fucking door</v>

2483
01:51:00.701 --> 01:51:03.310
<v Speaker 3>and drag you out in handcuffs because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you decided to tweak your consciousness</v>

2484
01:51:03.311 --> 01:51:03.940
<v Speaker 3>slightly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2485
01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:05.290
<v Speaker 3>that's the biggest government</v>
<v Speaker 3>imaginable.</v>

2486
01:51:05.291 --> 01:51:07.270
<v Speaker 3>They kick your door down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot your dog because you've got to</v>

2487
01:51:07.271 --> 01:51:09.580
<v Speaker 3>fucking bowl sitting on your coffee</v>
<v Speaker 3>table.</v>

2488
01:51:09.910 --> 01:51:12.940
<v Speaker 3>There's so many examples of that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

2489
01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:18.000
<v Speaker 3>if trump really wanted to stop all this</v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal Mexican cartel legalize,</v>

2490
01:51:20.170 --> 01:51:21.940
<v Speaker 3>legalize and tax it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regulate it,</v>

2491
01:51:22.450 --> 01:51:25.050
<v Speaker 3>done thousands of jobs to create.</v>

2492
01:51:25.570 --> 01:51:27.580
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason for them to be here.</v>

2493
01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:28.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that.</v>

2494
01:51:28.691 --> 01:51:29.740
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the things that's so</v>

2495
01:51:29.741 --> 01:51:33.400
<v Speaker 3>frustrating to me doing what I do and</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why I think it shows</v>

2496
01:51:33.401 --> 01:51:38.401
<v Speaker 3>like ours have blown up is because we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to say the most obvious things</v>

2497
01:51:38.561 --> 01:51:42.040
<v Speaker 3>that everybody's thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the system is dragging like fucking</v>

2498
01:51:42.041 --> 01:51:44.650
<v Speaker 3>50 years behind what we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

2499
01:51:44.651 --> 01:51:47.560
<v Speaker 3>but you could never do the show that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>do or this kind of show.</v>

2500
01:51:47.590 --> 01:51:50.070
<v Speaker 3>If you had like real serious</v>
<v Speaker 3>advertisers,</v>

2501
01:51:50.130 --> 01:51:52.930
<v Speaker 3>entrepreneurs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent serious network and producers</v>

2502
01:51:52.931 --> 01:51:55.480
<v Speaker 3>and executives have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had a bunch of executives that were</v>

2503
01:51:55.481 --> 01:51:58.930
<v Speaker 3>above you and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fill in the blank CNBC or whatever and</v>

2504
01:51:58.931 --> 01:52:02.350
<v Speaker 3>their job depended upon you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not saying something fucked up that was</v>

2505
01:52:02.351 --> 01:52:06.880
<v Speaker 3>going to get the advertisers to crack</v>
<v Speaker 3>down on their program and you wouldn't</v>

2506
01:52:06.881 --> 01:52:07.570
<v Speaker 3>be able to do it.</v>

2507
01:52:07.570 --> 01:52:09.250
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't have freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2508
01:52:09.730 --> 01:52:14.730
<v Speaker 3>a Janky Uber was on MSNBC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason he ended up leaving MSNBC,</v>

2509
01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:19.690
<v Speaker 3>he was too hard on the Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so his higher ups were like,</v>

2510
01:52:19.691 --> 01:52:22.480
<v Speaker 3>hey listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just heard from our friends in</v>

2511
01:52:22.481 --> 01:52:25.900
<v Speaker 3>Washington that you need to reel it in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit,</v>

2512
01:52:26.090 --> 01:52:27.610
<v Speaker 3>turn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>

2513
01:52:27.611 --> 01:52:28.361
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand.</v>

2514
01:52:28.361 --> 01:52:31.720
<v Speaker 3>So the whole idea of MSNBC is be</v>
<v Speaker 3>partisan,</v>

2515
01:52:31.780 --> 01:52:34.960
<v Speaker 3>be in favor of the Democrats and support</v>
<v Speaker 3>the democratic establishment.</v>

2516
01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:39.160
<v Speaker 3>The whole idea of Fox News is be</v>
<v Speaker 3>partisan support the Republican support</v>

2517
01:52:39.161 --> 01:52:41.590
<v Speaker 3>the establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If somebody comes along and they go,</v>

2518
01:52:41.710 --> 01:52:44.350
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your whole fucking game is bullshit.</v>

2519
01:52:44.510 --> 01:52:45.920
<v Speaker 3>Both the are corrupt.</v>

2520
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:48.560
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's fighting for the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're ignoring.</v>

2521
01:52:48.590 --> 01:52:52.610
<v Speaker 2>The fact that only 14 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>American people even support Congress.</v>

2522
01:52:52.670 --> 01:52:55.820
<v Speaker 2>You're ignoring the fact that 60 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people want to legalize marijuana.</v>

2523
01:52:56.060 --> 01:52:59.720
<v Speaker 2>If you go and talk about real issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when they step up and they go,</v>

2524
01:52:59.930 --> 01:53:01.700
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't have you because you know,</v>

2525
01:53:01.701 --> 01:53:03.230
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you curse too much or this isn't</v>

2526
01:53:03.231 --> 01:53:08.060
<v Speaker 2>palatable and it's always people above</v>
<v Speaker 2>you who feel like they should be able to</v>

2527
01:53:08.061 --> 01:53:10.610
<v Speaker 2>control your content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't understand the reason why</v>

2528
01:53:10.611 --> 01:53:13.340
<v Speaker 2>the content is popular in the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>place is because you're not fucking</v>

2529
01:53:13.341 --> 01:53:14.600
<v Speaker 2>being controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2530
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They they're operating in this archaic</v>

2531
01:53:18.021 --> 01:53:20.810
<v Speaker 2>format to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other problem is they interrupt</v>

2532
01:53:20.811 --> 01:53:24.530
<v Speaker 2>their show every 15 minutes for our</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows and it's just they break the flow</v>

2533
01:53:24.531 --> 01:53:28.100
<v Speaker 2>of it and then they got fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>commercials for antidepressants and</v>

2534
01:53:28.130 --> 01:53:33.130
<v Speaker 2>diarrhea pills and whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>else are selling and it's just nobody</v>

2535
01:53:33.321 --> 01:53:34.100
<v Speaker 2>wants that.</v>

2536
01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:37.340
<v Speaker 2>This is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an archaic version of entertainment</v>

2537
01:53:37.341 --> 01:53:41.390
<v Speaker 2>and it made sense back when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the only way to get your</v>

2538
01:53:41.391 --> 01:53:44.270
<v Speaker 2>entertainment when the only way to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>your entertained was the big three.</v>

2539
01:53:44.271 --> 01:53:45.380
<v Speaker 2>NBC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ABC,</v>

2540
01:53:45.381 --> 01:53:47.450
<v Speaker 2>CBS,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Fox comes along with tosses the</v>

2541
01:53:47.451 --> 01:53:49.820
<v Speaker 2>apple up and then you got cable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness.</v>

2542
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Now things are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2543
01:53:51.001 --> 01:53:54.740
<v Speaker 2>the cable news is really opened it up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now you got wild shit like Fox News</v>

2544
01:53:54.741 --> 01:53:56.930
<v Speaker 2>and all this and Meghan Kelly doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have any clothes on.</v>

2545
01:53:56.931 --> 01:54:01.931
<v Speaker 2>She's telling you about fucking history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that stuff was really an interesting</v>

2546
01:54:02.091 --> 01:54:03.830
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the Internet comes along,</v>

2547
01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:07.910
<v Speaker 2>all bets are off 100 percent and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck because a guy like you mean who?</v>

2548
01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Who's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's involved in your operation?</v>

2549
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:12.530
<v Speaker 2>How many people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three,</v>

2550
01:54:12.531 --> 01:54:13.570
<v Speaker 2>four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sylaria.</v>

2551
01:54:13.590 --> 01:54:14.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi,</v>

2552
01:54:14.181 --> 01:54:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Bill with Lilith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those a lot of stuff.</v>

2553
01:54:16.131 --> 01:54:18.640
<v Speaker 2>She's awesome and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

2554
01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:19.850
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nuts.</v>

2555
01:54:19.850 --> 01:54:23.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean how many fucking people would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in the Ryan seacrest show?</v>

2556
01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And hundreds.</v>

2557
01:54:25.010 --> 01:54:27.350
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that when you keep</v>

2558
01:54:27.351 --> 01:54:28.184
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ryan seacrest.</v>

2559
01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so irrelevant.</v>

2560
01:54:29.751 --> 01:54:31.730
<v Speaker 2>And will you keep something small and</v>
<v Speaker 2>close to the chest?</v>

2561
01:54:31.731 --> 01:54:33.740
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that's when you can mold it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and make it your own.</v>

2562
01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:37.250
<v Speaker 2>When it becomes a giant big operation at</v>
<v Speaker 2>43 hands are in it,</v>

2563
01:54:37.610 --> 01:54:42.560
<v Speaker 2>well then all of a sudden it feels like</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's stale and detached and not</v>

2564
01:54:42.561 --> 01:54:44.660
<v Speaker 2>connected to anything real that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>can relate to.</v>

2565
01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:46.550
<v Speaker 2>Now I've been involved in that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff before.</v>

2566
01:54:46.551 --> 01:54:49.250
<v Speaker 2>I know what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just there's too many cooks in the</v>

2567
01:54:49.251 --> 01:54:51.390
<v Speaker 2>kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything gets fucked up and everybody</v>

2568
01:54:51.391 --> 01:54:53.000
<v Speaker 2>is also trying to justify their</v>
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>

2569
01:54:53.001 --> 01:54:55.850
<v Speaker 2>which is almost unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so many positions when</v>

2570
01:54:55.851 --> 01:54:58.340
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you work on a television set and</v>

2571
01:54:58.341 --> 01:55:00.920
<v Speaker 2>you see how many people are just</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing around and you go,</v>

2572
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:02.120
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is,</v>

2573
01:55:02.150 --> 01:55:03.890
<v Speaker 2>why are there so many jobs?</v>

2574
01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Like why there's so many people working</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

2575
01:55:05.850 --> 01:55:08.300
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is like they've kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>created these jobs,</v>

2576
01:55:08.301 --> 01:55:10.880
<v Speaker 2>justify their position and then when</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's meetings,</v>

2577
01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:15.740
<v Speaker 2>those people all have like an idea that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want change.</v>

2578
01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:20.000
<v Speaker 2>They want to change this or tweak that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they can say that was my idea and</v>

2579
01:55:20.001 --> 01:55:21.180
<v Speaker 2>that justifies the real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2580
01:55:21.181 --> 01:55:24.140
<v Speaker 2>it was my idea to tell kyle that he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to stop doing this and start doing</v>

2581
01:55:24.141 --> 01:55:27.110
<v Speaker 2>that and we got kyle to wear a suit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he pushed back,</v>

2582
01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:28.460
<v Speaker 2>but I was right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was right.</v>

2583
01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:31.040
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's all that kind of shit that</v>

2584
01:55:31.041 --> 01:55:34.990
<v Speaker 2>happens on these Goddamn TV sets and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>ruins the,</v>

2585
01:55:35.010 --> 01:55:39.770
<v Speaker 2>the individual idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a person's individual point of</v>

2586
01:55:39.771 --> 01:55:42.730
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if there's no way you're going to</v>

2587
01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:47.700
<v Speaker 2>get a real unique individual point of</v>
<v Speaker 2>view if you have so many people tweaking</v>

2588
01:55:47.701 --> 01:55:52.020
<v Speaker 2>and adjusting and restricting and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and demanding that a person behave a</v>

2589
01:55:52.021 --> 01:55:56.280
<v Speaker 2>certain way or dress a certain way or</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay to a certain topic or you know,</v>

2590
01:55:56.370 --> 01:55:57.690
<v Speaker 2>keep on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2591
01:55:57.691 --> 01:56:01.740
<v Speaker 2>you have to keep within these very</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly defined parameters.</v>

2592
01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:06.420
<v Speaker 2>Where was it a worst for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which show was it the man show when you</v>

2593
01:56:06.421 --> 01:56:08.080
<v Speaker 2>did the man show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was asked.</v>

2594
01:56:08.130 --> 01:56:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a disaster for a bunch of</v>

2595
01:56:09.451 --> 01:56:11.280
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the reasons why that was a</v>

2596
01:56:11.281 --> 01:56:15.330
<v Speaker 2>disaster was because Janet Jackson and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Justin timberlake decided to pull</v>

2597
01:56:15.630 --> 01:56:17.900
<v Speaker 2>Janet's booby out on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2598
01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:20.170
<v Speaker 2>and so they cracked down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it'd be policing.</v>

2599
01:56:20.250 --> 01:56:22.920
<v Speaker 2>They were terrified of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's also,</v>

2600
01:56:22.921 --> 01:56:25.830
<v Speaker 2>you have a bunch of people again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that aren't comedians.</v>

2601
01:56:25.831 --> 01:56:30.720
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what's funny and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to impose their idea of what's</v>

2602
01:56:30.721 --> 01:56:33.540
<v Speaker 2>funny and what's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a lot of that on television</v>

2603
01:56:33.541 --> 01:56:35.070
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of these people that</v>

2604
01:56:35.071 --> 01:56:39.360
<v Speaker 2>aren't necessarily comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they might be like super progressive</v>

2605
01:56:39.361 --> 01:56:42.930
<v Speaker 2>social justice warrior types and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to push that kind of</v>

2606
01:56:42.931 --> 01:56:46.260
<v Speaker 2>comedy is being what everybody likes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that shit gets to,</v>

2607
01:56:46.670 --> 01:56:47.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's hometown,</v>

2608
01:56:47.881 --> 01:56:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ohio,</v>

2609
01:56:48.781 --> 01:56:50.160
<v Speaker 2>and these people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

2610
01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:51.120
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eating me.</v>

2611
01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:52.800
<v Speaker 2>And then meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we were talking about for the</v>

2612
01:56:52.801 --> 01:56:55.560
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy like joey diaz comes around and</v>

2613
01:56:55.561 --> 01:56:56.430
<v Speaker 2>everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

2614
01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.300
<v Speaker 2>That's what we want you to know this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>on in the world.</v>

2615
01:57:00.630 --> 01:57:04.800
<v Speaker 2>He's a perfect example too because for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the longest time I was trying to tell</v>

2616
01:57:04.801 --> 01:57:07.650
<v Speaker 2>people for the longest time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I had agents,</v>

2617
01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:10.080
<v Speaker 2>former agents of mine that would tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

2618
01:57:10.081 --> 01:57:13.650
<v Speaker 2>you've got to stop working with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's literally the dumbest Shit I've</v>

2619
01:57:13.651 --> 01:57:16.170
<v Speaker 2>ever heard in my life is not fun and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so easy to see.</v>

2620
01:57:16.171 --> 01:57:21.171
<v Speaker 2>He's like a diamond in the rough in how</v>
<v Speaker 2>unique he is and how just</v>

2621
01:57:22.141 --> 01:57:23.880
<v Speaker 2>straightforward he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2622
01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:26.160
<v Speaker 2>he's a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a comedy genius.</v>

2623
01:57:26.161 --> 01:57:29.190
<v Speaker 2>I think he's the funny in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>bursts of,</v>

2624
01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:31.830
<v Speaker 2>I might not be the very best joke writer</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all time,</v>

2625
01:57:31.831 --> 01:57:34.920
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of being the funniest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's the funniest person that's</v>

2626
01:57:34.921 --> 01:57:35.430
<v Speaker 2>ever lived.</v>

2627
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:38.430
<v Speaker 2>I've seen everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen almost everybody either live</v>

2628
01:57:38.431 --> 01:57:40.590
<v Speaker 2>or on video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody's ever been</v>

2629
01:57:40.591 --> 01:57:44.430
<v Speaker 2>funnier than Joey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen joey some nights at the Ice</v>

2630
01:57:44.430 --> 01:57:46.110
<v Speaker 2>House or some nights at the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>store.</v>

2631
01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Hit levels of ridiculousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've seen anybody and his</v>

2632
01:57:51.001 --> 01:57:53.250
<v Speaker 2>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a God damn human cartoon.</v>

2633
01:57:53.590 --> 01:57:56.290
<v Speaker 2>Says Voice is cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

2634
01:57:56.340 --> 01:58:01.340
<v Speaker 2>dog says way moves and forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were telling me that that guy is</v>

2635
01:58:03.391 --> 01:58:04.770
<v Speaker 2>not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not good.</v>

2636
01:58:04.771 --> 01:58:07.920
<v Speaker 2>This guy can't work and he wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting work other than like character</v>

2637
01:58:07.921 --> 01:58:10.920
<v Speaker 2>work in movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the internet came along and</v>

2638
01:58:10.921 --> 01:58:15.570
<v Speaker 2>then people got to know him on podcasts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what really made Joey and you</v>

2639
01:58:15.571 --> 01:58:17.730
<v Speaker 2>knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody who is telling you that was</v>

2640
01:58:17.731 --> 01:58:22.140
<v Speaker 2>working backwards from their conclusion</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they had this idea in their mind of</v>

2641
01:58:22.141 --> 01:58:24.270
<v Speaker 2>what somebody who's popular is supposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>

2642
01:58:24.700 --> 01:58:26.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't fit that mold because he's too</v>

2643
01:58:26.641 --> 01:58:29.340
<v Speaker 2>rough around the edges and he curses too</v>
<v Speaker 2>much and he talks about eating ass and</v>

2644
01:58:29.341 --> 01:58:30.930
<v Speaker 2>all that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you knew.</v>

2645
01:58:30.931 --> 01:58:33.900
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know innately I look at this guy and</v>

2646
01:58:33.901 --> 01:58:36.990
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he touches something in me so I know</v>

2647
01:58:36.991 --> 01:58:39.120
<v Speaker 2>this is going to connect with other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people while I'm also.</v>

2648
01:58:39.150 --> 01:58:44.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm out there in the clubs and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching joey go onstage and crush them,</v>

2649
01:58:44.351 --> 01:58:45.520
<v Speaker 2>telling me he's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2650
01:58:45.521 --> 01:58:46.450
<v Speaker 2>you're out of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2651
01:58:46.451 --> 01:58:47.710
<v Speaker 2>you're just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it.</v>

2652
01:58:47.770 --> 01:58:49.960
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fan of comedy.</v>

2653
01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:52.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just a fan of things that are</v>

2654
01:58:52.151 --> 01:58:53.530
<v Speaker 2>gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fan.</v>

2655
01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:57.280
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone's gross and it's not well</v>

2656
01:58:57.281 --> 01:58:59.080
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's appalling to me.</v>

2657
01:58:59.970 --> 01:59:00.910
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2658
01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:03.880
<v Speaker 2>I know when people are just being gross</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the sake of trying to get a</v>

2659
01:59:03.881 --> 01:59:05.500
<v Speaker 2>reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's annoying.</v>

2660
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:08.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's bad on your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you hear it more than</v>

2661
01:59:08.831 --> 01:59:09.601
<v Speaker 2>once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's.</v>

2662
01:59:09.601 --> 01:59:10.270
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2663
01:59:10.270 --> 01:59:12.700
<v Speaker 2>it's grading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Not doing that.</v>

2664
01:59:12.910 --> 01:59:15.730
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's being himself and I was watching</v>

2665
01:59:15.731 --> 01:59:19.210
<v Speaker 2>him kill over and over and over again</v>
<v Speaker 2>and having these people telling me that</v>

2666
01:59:19.211 --> 01:59:22.330
<v Speaker 2>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then podcast came along,</v>

2667
01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:22.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

2668
01:59:22.991 --> 01:59:27.430
<v Speaker 2>eight years ago and got to know him and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then now when we have them on,</v>

2669
01:59:27.431 --> 01:59:31.120
<v Speaker 2>it's like always one of our shows and</v>
<v Speaker 2>admitted always</v>

2670
01:59:31.250 --> 01:59:32.083
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2671
01:59:32.310 --> 01:59:34.010
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was telling you before the podcast</v>

2672
01:59:34.011 --> 01:59:35.930
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll tell joe if he's watching.</v>

2673
01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:37.130
<v Speaker 3>Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

2674
01:59:37.131 --> 01:59:38.270
<v Speaker 3>you don't need guests on your podcast.</v>

2675
01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:41.600
<v Speaker 2>I really like it when it's just joey and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lee and they just talk.</v>

2676
01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:43.850
<v Speaker 2>I liked that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I like Joey with guests too.</v>

2677
01:59:43.851 --> 01:59:46.980
<v Speaker 2>I just like Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to direct and produce Joey</v>

2678
01:59:46.981 --> 01:59:48.500
<v Speaker 2>standup special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's great.</v>

2679
01:59:48.501 --> 01:59:53.060
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't get anybody to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like they still don't get it.</v>

2680
01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of people that still</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get it and I'm hoping they get it</v>

2681
01:59:56.841 --> 01:59:59.000
<v Speaker 2>when we put something together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to film something that</v>

2682
01:59:59.001 --> 02:00:01.880
<v Speaker 2>the Ice House and I'm gonna put it all</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

2683
02:00:02.110 --> 02:00:04.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to direct it and produce</v>

2684
02:00:04.251 --> 02:00:07.250
<v Speaker 2>it and the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just have someone edit it and just</v>

2685
02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:10.940
<v Speaker 2>put it together and just make the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate Joey Diaz comedy specials so</v>

2686
02:00:10.941 --> 02:00:14.090
<v Speaker 2>people could know and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do a shit load of shows</v>

2687
02:00:14.091 --> 02:00:15.440
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's the other thing,</v>

2688
02:00:15.441 --> 02:00:18.680
<v Speaker 2>like when a comic has to do one show</v>
<v Speaker 2>ready here,</v>

2689
02:00:18.681 --> 02:00:21.050
<v Speaker 2>kyle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is your one moment to be funny and</v>

2690
02:00:21.051 --> 02:00:24.330
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be seeing forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you smoking pot and realizing</v>

2691
02:00:24.370 --> 02:00:27.170
<v Speaker 2>millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly that,</v>

2692
02:00:27.380 --> 02:00:29.800
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of what it's like for a</v>

2693
02:00:29.801 --> 02:00:32.780
<v Speaker 2>comic to do a special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you do one,</v>

2694
02:00:32.781 --> 02:00:35.390
<v Speaker 2>you get it into can you feel loose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you get that second one and you're</v>

2695
02:00:35.391 --> 02:00:35.631
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2696
02:00:35.631 --> 02:00:37.220
<v Speaker 2>we got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the third one you're like,</v>

2697
02:00:37.221 --> 02:00:38.960
<v Speaker 2>now we really got it needed a fourth</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

2698
02:00:39.140 --> 02:00:42.050
<v Speaker 2>The fourth one is generally like a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy show.</v>

2699
02:00:42.260 --> 02:00:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Like where there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no concern,</v>

2700
02:00:44.181 --> 02:00:45.380
<v Speaker 2>no worries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no issues.</v>

2701
02:00:45.590 --> 02:00:46.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2702
02:00:46.150 --> 02:00:50.500
<v Speaker 3>the evolution of stuff is interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's almost impossible to start</v>

2703
02:00:50.501 --> 02:00:53.980
<v Speaker 3>something and just get it like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It requires a lot of time,</v>

2704
02:00:53.981 --> 02:00:55.690
<v Speaker 3>a lot of effort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of cultivation,</v>

2705
02:00:55.691 --> 02:00:57.880
<v Speaker 3>a lot of attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2706
02:00:58.440 --> 02:00:59.860
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that book,</v>

2707
02:00:59.861 --> 02:01:01.900
<v Speaker 3>I forget who wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea of you have to do something</v>

2708
02:01:01.901 --> 02:01:04.850
<v Speaker 3>for 10,000 hours or whatever the fuck it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that gladwell no.</v>

2709
02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:06.970
<v Speaker 3>So they might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that might be a Malcolm Gladwell,</v>

2710
02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:09.570
<v Speaker 3>but that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know what I,</v>

2711
02:01:09.610 --> 02:01:13.270
<v Speaker 3>what I say is even if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say you don't get there with</v>

2712
02:01:13.271 --> 02:01:15.970
<v Speaker 3>whatever you're trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're definitely gonna be better after</v>

2713
02:01:15.971 --> 02:01:18.700
<v Speaker 3>those 10,000 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also you might learn a lot about</v>

2714
02:01:18.701 --> 02:01:22.420
<v Speaker 3>yourself and a lot about what you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>capable of and a lot about dedication</v>

2715
02:01:22.421 --> 02:01:24.340
<v Speaker 3>and discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you just stick with something.</v>

2716
02:01:24.341 --> 02:01:26.200
<v Speaker 3>And I've always said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2717
02:01:26.350 --> 02:01:30.910
<v Speaker 3>people like to shit on one dimensional</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and act like,</v>

2718
02:01:30.911 --> 02:01:31.511
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2719
02:01:31.511 --> 02:01:33.460
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to do I suppose to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be well rounded and this and that.</v>

2720
02:01:33.970 --> 02:01:35.200
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2721
02:01:35.201 --> 02:01:37.270
<v Speaker 3>to bring up tiger woods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck do you think he got good at</v>

2722
02:01:37.271 --> 02:01:37.661
<v Speaker 3>golf?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2723
02:01:37.661 --> 02:01:40.100
<v Speaker 3>how he got good at golf by only fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing golf.</v>

2724
02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:44.120
<v Speaker 2>And he was able to find something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got so fucking good at it and create</v>

2725
02:01:44.121 --> 02:01:47.990
<v Speaker 2>meaning in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also use that to develop different</v>

2726
02:01:47.991 --> 02:01:51.110
<v Speaker 2>parts of your personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

2727
02:01:51.590 --> 02:01:55.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm in favor of people doing whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think</v>

2728
02:01:57.110 --> 02:01:59.360
<v Speaker 2>suits their creative pursuits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>

2729
02:01:59.361 --> 02:02:01.160
<v Speaker 2>don't feel bad if you're somebody who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>all I.</v>

2730
02:02:01.161 --> 02:02:03.650
<v Speaker 2>all I do is this one fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2731
02:02:03.651 --> 02:02:04.730
<v Speaker 2>well you can get really fucking good at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2732
02:02:04.731 --> 02:02:06.260
<v Speaker 2>And who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's some shit like playing</v>

2733
02:02:06.261 --> 02:02:07.011
<v Speaker 2>video games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2734
02:02:07.011 --> 02:02:09.080
<v Speaker 2>go be the fucking best video game player</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

2735
02:02:09.470 --> 02:02:12.590
<v Speaker 2>Might as well if that's what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good at and you can do the time</v>

2736
02:02:12.591 --> 02:02:14.780
<v Speaker 2>and put in the work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you enjoy that.</v>

2737
02:02:14.781 --> 02:02:17.240
<v Speaker 2>And there's something about getting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>GRC.</v>

2738
02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:19.370
<v Speaker 2>Jiro dreams of Sushi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2739
02:02:19.850 --> 02:02:22.250
<v Speaker 2>really interesting documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the weirdest things about it,</v>

2740
02:02:22.251 --> 02:02:26.720
<v Speaker 2>it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a term that the Japanese use for</v>

2741
02:02:26.721 --> 02:02:30.470
<v Speaker 2>someone who does something over and over</v>
<v Speaker 2>and over again,</v>

2742
02:02:30.471 --> 02:02:33.320
<v Speaker 2>even a simple task and becomes a master</v>
<v Speaker 2>at it.</v>

2743
02:02:33.530 --> 02:02:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember what that term was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamey.</v>

2744
02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:37.393
<v Speaker 2>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2745
02:02:37.570 --> 02:02:41.450
<v Speaker 2>but this is one guy in the film I was at</v>
<v Speaker 2>first I was very skeptical.</v>

2746
02:02:41.590 --> 02:02:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not watching a fucking movie about a</v>

2747
02:02:43.341 --> 02:02:45.890
<v Speaker 2>due to make Sushi because the fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he puts it on the right,</v>

2748
02:02:45.891 --> 02:02:49.220
<v Speaker 2>but then when you see what really goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>into it to show Coonan I think,</v>

2749
02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:53.000
<v Speaker 2>how'd he say it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show coon and um,</v>

2750
02:02:53.570 --> 02:02:55.990
<v Speaker 2>and that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the definition of that was the,</v>

2751
02:02:56.060 --> 02:02:57.260
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they call it?</v>

2752
02:02:58.100 --> 02:03:00.790
<v Speaker 2>What is the actual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A tradesman?</v>

2753
02:03:02.250 --> 02:03:06.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like someone who practices</v>

2754
02:03:06.231 --> 02:03:11.231
<v Speaker 2>something methodically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meticulously forever until they get it.</v>

2755
02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:14.240
<v Speaker 2>And this guy was just making an egg</v>
<v Speaker 2>dish.</v>

2756
02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:18.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like really fluffy egg dish and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2757
02:03:18.591 --> 02:03:19.850
<v Speaker 2>how you get those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2758
02:03:19.851 --> 02:03:22.340
<v Speaker 2>you get Sushi sometimes it has that</v>
<v Speaker 2>little piece of egg on it.</v>

2759
02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:23.570
<v Speaker 2>Like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't eat Sushi,</v>

2760
02:03:23.630 --> 02:03:26.000
<v Speaker 2>tastes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't eat pussy either.</v>

2761
02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:31.060
<v Speaker 2>Well this fucking camera off as kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the you want to deal with the Sushi.</v>

2762
02:03:32.421 --> 02:03:36.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm not dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the um.</v>

2763
02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy was like almost in tears</v>

2764
02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:42.890
<v Speaker 2>because he finally reached this state</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the guy was like,</v>

2765
02:03:42.891 --> 02:03:44.980
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the way to make the egg dish the</v>

2766
02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:49.380
<v Speaker 2>mastery of one's profession show she'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>and things I'm seeing for definition.</v>

2767
02:03:49.530 --> 02:03:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show coon and mastery of one's</v>

2768
02:03:52.011 --> 02:03:54.800
<v Speaker 2>profession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in that this is this thing that this</v>

2769
02:03:54.801 --> 02:03:57.740
<v Speaker 2>guy had been studying the art of making</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sushi,</v>

2770
02:03:57.741 --> 02:04:00.920
<v Speaker 2>like the properly aging of the fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I didn't even know.</v>

2771
02:04:00.921 --> 02:04:04.620
<v Speaker 2>I thought the fish was fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was the move was aging.</v>

2772
02:04:04.650 --> 02:04:07.850
<v Speaker 2>They know they want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They own refrigerators for long periods</v>

2773
02:04:07.851 --> 02:04:10.730
<v Speaker 2>of time that I would've never guessed</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they did that with fish.</v>

2774
02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:14.240
<v Speaker 2>Obviously with meet everybody knows</v>
<v Speaker 2>about dry aged meat.</v>

2775
02:04:14.241 --> 02:04:16.220
<v Speaker 2>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're literally letting the bacteria</v>

2776
02:04:16.221 --> 02:04:18.350
<v Speaker 2>break down the meat over long periods of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

2777
02:04:18.830 --> 02:04:23.000
<v Speaker 2>but what's interesting is you would</v>
<v Speaker 2>never guess that there are so many</v>

2778
02:04:23.001 --> 02:04:27.740
<v Speaker 2>different angles to doing something as</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple as making that dish so much that</v>

2779
02:04:27.741 --> 02:04:32.090
<v Speaker 2>goes into it and if you care enough to</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at all the nuances of it and to</v>

2780
02:04:32.091 --> 02:04:36.350
<v Speaker 2>really get into the specifics of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can create something that has</v>

2781
02:04:36.351 --> 02:04:38.970
<v Speaker 2>meaning to you and really can develop</v>
<v Speaker 2>you as a person.</v>

2782
02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:39.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2783
02:04:39.991 --> 02:04:42.280
<v Speaker 2>There's something in that where you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're.</v>

2784
02:04:43.050 --> 02:04:47.580
<v Speaker 2>You're exploring your own potential for</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting good at things,</v>

2785
02:04:47.610 --> 02:04:49.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're doing.</v>

2786
02:04:49.441 --> 02:04:52.770
<v Speaker 2>You're exploring like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's keeping this guy from making this</v>

2787
02:04:52.800 --> 02:04:54.960
<v Speaker 2>perfect egg dish and how does he nail</v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

2788
02:04:54.961 --> 02:04:57.150
<v Speaker 2>Is it a timing issue?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it A.</v>

2789
02:04:57.760 --> 02:05:00.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he getting the ingredients correct?</v>

2790
02:05:00.450 --> 02:05:02.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's what ingredients are</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this egg dish,</v>

2791
02:05:02.671 --> 02:05:04.290
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know why I'm even using</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2792
02:05:04.291 --> 02:05:09.000
<v Speaker 2>but for anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some exploration of these ideas.</v>

2793
02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:11.970
<v Speaker 2>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kaizen is someone that's the word that's</v>

2794
02:05:11.971 --> 02:05:14.190
<v Speaker 2>the word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Continuous improvement,</v>

2795
02:05:14.430 --> 02:05:19.050
<v Speaker 2>a longterm approach to work that</v>
<v Speaker 2>systematically seeks to achieve small</v>

2796
02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:24.080
<v Speaker 2>incremental changes in processes in</v>
<v Speaker 2>order to improve efficiency and quality</v>

2797
02:05:25.050 --> 02:05:28.290
<v Speaker 2>Kaizen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was show Coonan the show</v>

2798
02:05:28.370 --> 02:05:31.530
<v Speaker 2>couldn't definition and said like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>definition of tradesmen isn't good</v>

2799
02:05:31.531 --> 02:05:33.990
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's more deeper meaning when you</v>

2800
02:05:33.991 --> 02:05:36.130
<v Speaker 2>get into like the Japanese cultural</v>
<v Speaker 2>expert.</v>

2801
02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:38.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So either one of those folks.</v>

2802
02:05:38.530 --> 02:05:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually think that this topic that</v>

2803
02:05:41.071 --> 02:05:44.550
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the main reasons why</v>

2804
02:05:44.580 --> 02:05:48.000
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson got very popular is</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Jordan Peterson,</v>

2805
02:05:48.150 --> 02:05:52.740
<v Speaker 2>he talks a lot about stuff that other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people take for granted about self</v>

2806
02:05:52.741 --> 02:05:55.470
<v Speaker 2>improvement and like getting your own</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit together.</v>

2807
02:05:55.560 --> 02:05:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was like a market that was</v>

2808
02:05:58.091 --> 02:06:00.870
<v Speaker 2>awaiting to be served for so long where</v>
<v Speaker 2>people wanted to have a little bit of</v>

2809
02:06:00.871 --> 02:06:05.220
<v Speaker 2>direction and structure and framework as</v>
<v Speaker 2>to how do I go about doing that.</v>

2810
02:06:05.700 --> 02:06:08.670
<v Speaker 2>And then this guy comes along and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well spoken and he can kind of</v>

2811
02:06:08.671 --> 02:06:10.470
<v Speaker 2>break that down for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2812
02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:12.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also he,</v>

2813
02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:16.500
<v Speaker 2>he exemplifies a lot of those traits we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were just discussing when he was talking</v>

2814
02:06:16.501 --> 02:06:20.850
<v Speaker 2>about his first book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm one of the things that he said</v>

2815
02:06:20.851 --> 02:06:23.460
<v Speaker 2>is that it took him 15 years to write</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book.</v>

2816
02:06:23.461 --> 02:06:24.780
<v Speaker 2>The 12 rules book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2817
02:06:24.781 --> 02:06:28.170
<v Speaker 2>the first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first book was on the Cold War and</v>

2818
02:06:28.410 --> 02:06:33.410
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about how he went over</v>
<v Speaker 2>every sentence to see if it can be</v>

2819
02:06:33.871 --> 02:06:37.940
<v Speaker 2>improved or criticized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you do that with your podcasts?</v>

2820
02:06:37.941 --> 02:06:40.250
<v Speaker 2>Do you listen back or now because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's sometimes.</v>

2821
02:06:40.260 --> 02:06:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes if especially if I fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucked up,</v>

2822
02:06:43.501 --> 02:06:45.480
<v Speaker 2>I'll listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or if I said something I know that could</v>

2823
02:06:45.481 --> 02:06:46.980
<v Speaker 2>be a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said something.</v>

2824
02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to go back and get another one</v>

2825
02:06:49.170 --> 02:06:50.160
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying it.</v>

2826
02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:51.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do that.</v>

2827
02:06:52.050 --> 02:06:54.450
<v Speaker 2>Or you know,</v>

2828
02:06:54.451 --> 02:06:57.060
<v Speaker 2>really intense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the David Goggins podcast,</v>

2829
02:06:57.061 --> 02:06:59.940
<v Speaker 2>I plan on listening to that one again</v>

<v Speaker 2>intense.</v>

2835
02:07:14.370 --> 02:07:16.710
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good enough word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we need to.</v>

2836
02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:17.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2838
02:07:20.341 --> 02:07:23.850
<v Speaker 2>He's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also you could get a lot out of</v>

2839
02:07:23.851 --> 02:07:26.370
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something about inspiration in</v>

2840
02:07:26.371 --> 02:07:28.860
<v Speaker 2>that form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the exemplified form.</v>

2841
02:07:29.070 --> 02:07:32.490
<v Speaker 2>There's a term that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Koreans used for a taekwondo</v>

2842
02:07:32.491 --> 02:07:35.860
<v Speaker 2>instructor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a Sabal Nim and it means one who</v>

2843
02:07:35.861 --> 02:07:39.940
<v Speaker 2>leads by example and that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about a guy like that,</v>

2844
02:07:39.970 --> 02:07:42.220
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really does practice what he</v>

2845
02:07:42.260 --> 02:07:43.840
<v Speaker 2>preaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>preaches,</v>

2846
02:07:43.870 --> 02:07:47.440
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and is so motivational just by his own</v>

2847
02:07:47.470 --> 02:07:49.900
<v Speaker 2>actions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you hear him talk about it and you</v>

2848
02:07:49.901 --> 02:07:51.040
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's actually done it.</v>

2849
02:07:51.340 --> 02:07:52.180
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just want to like,</v>

2850
02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:53.590
<v Speaker 2>why am I sitting down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to go.</v>

2851
02:07:53.880 --> 02:07:55.330
<v Speaker 2>You just want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you said that after the.</v>

2852
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:56.261
<v Speaker 2>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were like,</v>

2853
02:07:56.261 --> 02:07:57.094
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fuck,</v>

2854
02:07:57.110 --> 02:07:59.410
<v Speaker 2>I just want to go do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2855
02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:03.160
<v Speaker 2>there's something about guys like him</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are very,</v>

2856
02:08:03.161 --> 02:08:06.460
<v Speaker 2>very valuable to us and I think people</v>
<v Speaker 2>get real cynical about the idea of</v>

2857
02:08:06.461 --> 02:08:11.461
<v Speaker 2>inspiration because there's so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous like not to single out girls</v>

2858
02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:13.120
<v Speaker 2>because there's guys do it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2859
02:08:13.380 --> 02:08:16.540
<v Speaker 2>there's some funny shit about girls just</v>
<v Speaker 2>stick their butt out on instagram and</v>

2860
02:08:16.541 --> 02:08:20.200
<v Speaker 2>they have all these motivational quotes</v>
<v Speaker 2>accord and I were talking about it</v>

2861
02:08:20.201 --> 02:08:21.034
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

2862
02:08:21.190 --> 02:08:25.300
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how many Kim Kardashians</v>
<v Speaker 2>clones exist now.</v>

2863
02:08:25.450 --> 02:08:27.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even in her own family,</v>

2864
02:08:27.371 --> 02:08:29.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know all the names of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the younger ones,</v>

2865
02:08:29.590 --> 02:08:30.820
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like she went to the plastic</v>

2866
02:08:30.821 --> 02:08:32.770
<v Speaker 2>surgeon and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to look like Kim.</v>

2867
02:08:32.910 --> 02:08:35.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they just give her the same face.</v>

2868
02:08:35.290 --> 02:08:37.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is up with that?</v>

2869
02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:41.620
<v Speaker 2>The but thing is the most disgusting</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing where they're taking fat and stuff</v>

2870
02:08:41.621 --> 02:08:43.930
<v Speaker 2>and an into their ass and they developed</v>
<v Speaker 2>this diaper.</v>

2871
02:08:43.931 --> 02:08:46.540
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people out there with</v>

2872
02:08:46.541 --> 02:08:48.370
<v Speaker 2>diaper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I met a girl the other day that had</v>

2873
02:08:48.371 --> 02:08:50.160
<v Speaker 2>diaper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was at the comedy store and I</v>

2874
02:08:50.170 --> 02:08:51.640
<v Speaker 2>couldn't look away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2875
02:08:51.641 --> 02:08:54.880
<v Speaker 2>what is happening to her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because I knew it wasn't real.</v>

2876
02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:56.080
<v Speaker 2>I knew she had.</v>

2895
02:09:48.940 --> 02:09:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Dorky guy and he's got this image of</v>

<v Speaker 2>Female boobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

02:10:09.250 --> 02:10:10.360
<v Speaker 2>look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got soccer.</v>

2901
02:10:10.390 --> 02:10:12.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's who he was like really the one</v>

2902
02:10:12.551 --> 02:10:13.450
<v Speaker 2>above that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The one to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2904
02:10:14.351 --> 02:10:15.184
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2905
02:10:15.700 --> 02:10:20.230
<v Speaker 2>oh my goodness is what he used to draw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was always drawing this enormous,</v>

2906
02:10:20.231 --> 02:10:22.510
<v Speaker 2>powerful women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy was definitely into getting</v>

2907
02:10:22.511 --> 02:10:24.250
<v Speaker 2>dominated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2908
02:10:24.251 --> 02:10:26.750
<v Speaker 2>He would just shove his whole head in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their pussy or so I'm sure,</v>

2909
02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:27.960
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at him.</v>

2910
02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:30.970
<v Speaker 2>He hit him riding one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess he's supposed to be having sex</v>

2911
02:10:30.971 --> 02:10:33.130
<v Speaker 2>with him and this guy definitely noted</v>
<v Speaker 2>in like two seconds.</v>

2912
02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:34.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

2913
02:10:34.340 --> 02:10:35.910
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's choking them in these carts.</v>

2914
02:10:36.050 --> 02:10:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Like he's always choking them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you literally couldn't have an art</v>

2915
02:10:39.310 --> 02:10:43.120
<v Speaker 2>crumb today that looks like it looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like a woody allen to.</v>

2916
02:10:43.650 --> 02:10:44.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2917
02:10:44.540 --> 02:10:48.210
<v Speaker 2>see if you could find a video of him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our crum,</v>

2918
02:10:48.730 --> 02:10:52.010
<v Speaker 2>the documentaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating because I think he wound up</v>

2919
02:10:52.011 --> 02:10:56.180
<v Speaker 2>moving to France or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you want to leaving America.</v>

2920
02:10:57.620 --> 02:10:59.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

2921
02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:01.310
<v Speaker 2>there's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to video you'll,</v>

2922
02:11:01.330 --> 02:11:05.240
<v Speaker 2>you'll find there's video of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was the guy.</v>

2923
02:11:05.241 --> 02:11:09.620
<v Speaker 2>He's a really fascinating guy that's on</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2924
02:11:10.010 --> 02:11:13.640
<v Speaker 2>It looks just like I'm on the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>not on the right.</v>

2925
02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not definitely not the right guy</v>

2926
02:11:16.190 --> 02:11:17.450
<v Speaker 2>on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that him?</v>

2927
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:19.303
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>

2928
02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:22.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just looks odd.</v>

2929
02:11:22.730 --> 02:11:26.120
<v Speaker 2>It was just holding up that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's also because I'm looking at</v>

2930
02:11:26.121 --> 02:11:28.500
<v Speaker 2>him now as an older man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2931
02:11:28.810 --> 02:11:30.950
<v Speaker 2>the lot of the video that I'd seen was</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2932
02:11:31.310 --> 02:11:33.040
<v Speaker 2>It bothers me to look at him and think</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2933
02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:35.090
<v Speaker 2>that guy has a strong sex drive.</v>

2934
02:11:36.330 --> 02:11:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2935
02:11:36.740 --> 02:11:37.291
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2936
02:11:37.291 --> 02:11:39.680
<v Speaker 2>You might not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might just save it up for every</v>

2937
02:11:39.681 --> 02:11:43.250
<v Speaker 2>couple of weeks and they try one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those cartoons and beat off to it or</v>

2938
02:11:43.310 --> 02:11:45.920
<v Speaker 2>find a cow suitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2939
02:11:45.921 --> 02:11:47.870
<v Speaker 2>Pay Somebody to sit on his face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A strange,</v>

2940
02:11:47.871 --> 02:11:49.750
<v Speaker 2>strange character though.</v>

2955
02:12:23.330 --> 02:12:26.180
<v Speaker 2>Whereas with Kim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's got those spindly,</v>

2956

02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:29.060
<v Speaker 2>like her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is this,</v>

2958
02:12:29.670 --> 02:12:32.180
<v Speaker 2>did just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a surgical creation.</v>

2959
02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:36.770
<v Speaker 2>Like there's pictures of her that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>online that make it look good,</v>

2960
02:12:36.771 --> 02:12:40.260
<v Speaker 2>but they're all photoshop and we found</v>
<v Speaker 2>out about that because she got Paparazzi</v>

2961
02:12:40.261 --> 02:12:43.220
<v Speaker 2>Razzi when she was in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They caught her on the beach.</v>

2962
02:12:43.290 --> 02:12:46.270
<v Speaker 2>That was the one that they were showing</v>
<v Speaker 2>way gets worse than that way.</v>

2963
02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:48.770
<v Speaker 2>Grocer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They caught her wandering around the</v>

2964
02:12:48.771 --> 02:12:52.640
<v Speaker 2>beach and they took photos of her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like real Paparazzi photos.</v>

2965
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:55.670
<v Speaker 2>She would have fake Paparazzi photos</v>
<v Speaker 2>where she would hire pop routes,</v>

2966
02:12:55.700 --> 02:12:58.610
<v Speaker 2>take photos of her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then she would photoshop a mop and</v>

2967
02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:01.190
<v Speaker 2>they made it look like everything was in</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

2968
02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:03.060
<v Speaker 2>But it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2969
02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:04.700
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a disaster.</v>

2970
02:13:04.701 --> 02:13:07.490
<v Speaker 2>This is what it really looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2971
02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is that it?</v>

2972
02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:11.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if the legs matched the ass,</v>

2973
02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:13.970
<v Speaker 2>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be totally fine with that.</v>

2974
02:13:13.971 --> 02:13:18.290
<v Speaker 2>But even that acid is a distortion</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's so much going on there</v>

2975
02:13:18.291 --> 02:13:21.140
<v Speaker 2>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to have that much</v>

2976
02:13:21.141 --> 02:13:25.430
<v Speaker 2>fat in one place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It a girl has an ass like that has legs</v>

2977
02:13:25.431 --> 02:13:26.660
<v Speaker 2>to match it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2978
02:13:26.661 --> 02:13:28.820
<v Speaker 2>If the legs match the ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like it.</v>

2979
02:13:28.970 --> 02:13:30.740
<v Speaker 2>But the legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2980
02:13:30.770 --> 02:13:31.940
<v Speaker 2>The throw it off his little</v>

2981
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:36.510
<v Speaker 1>little twig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legs and then you got the message.</v>

2982
02:13:36.820 --> 02:13:39.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like those guys that shoot synthol</v>
<v Speaker 1>until</v>

2983
02:13:41.300 --> 02:13:43.200
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're not,</v>

2984
02:13:43.201 --> 02:13:46.470
<v Speaker 1>that's not a real ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just like those synthol muscles</v>

2985
02:13:46.471 --> 02:13:49.420
<v Speaker 1>are not real monster there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obviously fake.</v>

2986
02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:50.730
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the legs though,</v>

2987
02:13:50.740 --> 02:13:52.380
<v Speaker 1>but the legs were matched it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

2988
02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:54.360
<v Speaker 1>that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it wouldn't match it.</v>

2989
02:13:54.361 --> 02:13:58.050
<v Speaker 1>It's just not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some where it matches.</v>

2990
02:13:58.550 --> 02:14:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not like that.</v>

2991
02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Just it's the whole thing is a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says.</v>

2992
02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever watched the show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forgot,</v>

2997
02:14:13.710 --> 02:14:15.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys wind up getting horrible</v>

2998
02:14:15.571 --> 02:14:17.400
<v Speaker 1>infections too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they've,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they gangrene and shit.</v>

3000
02:14:19.950 --> 02:14:22.610
<v Speaker 1>They say that there's an actual thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3001
02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:24.450
<v Speaker 1>You say you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say how there's an actual thing</v>

3002
02:14:24.451 --> 02:14:27.440
<v Speaker 1>called bigorexia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's Anorexia and there's bigger</v>

3003
02:14:27.441 --> 02:14:30.920
<v Speaker 1>x body dysmorphia exists with A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

3004
02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:34.590
<v Speaker 1>there's people that have body dysmorphia</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of their facial features.</v>

3005
02:14:34.591 --> 02:14:36.240
<v Speaker 1>They just can't stop tweaking their</v>
<v Speaker 1>nose.</v>

3006
02:14:36.270 --> 02:14:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3007
02:14:38.340 --> 02:14:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I read an article about how somebody was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3008
02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:45.990
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm supposed to have a hand here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it feels so fucking foreign that.</v>

3009
02:14:46.170 --> 02:14:49.530
<v Speaker 1>And there's been multiple recorded cases</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this where they will shove their</v>

3010
02:14:49.531 --> 02:14:53.310
<v Speaker 1>fucking hand and dry ice so that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can get an amputated said afterwards,</v>

3011
02:14:53.311 --> 02:14:53.851
<v Speaker 1>they can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3012
02:14:53.851 --> 02:14:55.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I finally feel normal.</v>

3013
02:14:55.190 --> 02:14:57.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like you just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they save it to them.</v>

3014
02:14:57.871 --> 02:15:00.840
<v Speaker 1>It feels like if I had a fucking third</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand just growing out of here,</v>

3015
02:15:01.050 --> 02:15:04.680
<v Speaker 1>I'd feel like that shit doesn't belong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some people where they feel</v>

3016
02:15:04.681 --> 02:15:08.700
<v Speaker 1>like their hand doesn't fucking belong</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what that shows is like the</v>

3017
02:15:08.701 --> 02:15:13.350
<v Speaker 1>variation in human psychology is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking broad that it's scary because</v>

3018
02:15:13.351 --> 02:15:15.330
<v Speaker 1>when you really digest that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that exists,</v>

3019
02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:19.710
<v Speaker 1>you also can understand how well there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters out there to want to fucking</v>

3020
02:15:19.711 --> 02:15:22.980
<v Speaker 1>massacre people and they dream about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit and that's how they get their</v>

3021
02:15:22.981 --> 02:15:23.800
<v Speaker 1>rocks off.</v>

3022
02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human.</v>

3023
02:15:24.510 --> 02:15:28.070
<v Speaker 1>The human mind vary so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many different paths that</v>

3024
02:15:28.071 --> 02:15:33.071
<v Speaker 1>thoughts can go down and there's so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>different weird pathologies that that</v>

3025
02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:37.800
<v Speaker 1>the mind is capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that you would think that</v>

3026
02:15:37.801 --> 02:15:40.880
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to be handicapped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not handicapped,</v>

3027
02:15:40.881 --> 02:15:43.230
<v Speaker 1>and so you want to chop off a foot or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

3028
02:15:43.590 --> 02:15:46.140
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not common,</v>

3029
02:15:46.220 --> 02:15:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't say it's common,</v>

3030
02:15:47.371 --> 02:15:48.204
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3031
02:15:48.260 --> 02:15:51.120
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely documented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me ask you,</v>

3032
02:15:51.121 --> 02:15:52.410
<v Speaker 1>what's your take on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3033
02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:58.760
<v Speaker 1>if somebody is transgender and they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>the surgery and let's say they're either</v>

3034
02:16:00.271 --> 02:16:04.380
<v Speaker 1>in the military or they're in prison or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

3035
02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:08.910
<v Speaker 1>is that something that you think should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be provided for them or no?</v>

3036
02:16:10.140 --> 02:16:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Um hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

3037
02:16:13.290 --> 02:16:16.620
<v Speaker 1>I haven't really thought about too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

3038
02:16:17.070 --> 02:16:20.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that's an elective</v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery and people would say no,</v>

3039
02:16:20.941 --> 02:16:24.120
<v Speaker 1>it's not elective surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you think that other people should</v>

3040
02:16:24.121 --> 02:16:25.590
<v Speaker 1>pay for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

3041
02:16:25.591 --> 02:16:28.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

3042
02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:30.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3043
02:16:30.190 --> 02:16:34.300
<v Speaker 2>So if I was gonna say I know why people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are transgender there.</v>

3044
02:16:34.301 --> 02:16:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Transgender because of body dysmorphia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're transgender because of gender</v>

3045
02:16:38.231 --> 02:16:40.300
<v Speaker 2>dysmorphia there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're transgender because of this.</v>

3046
02:16:40.301 --> 02:16:41.740
<v Speaker 2>Because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of abuse,</v>

3047
02:16:41.741 --> 02:16:46.741
<v Speaker 2>because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>easily susceptible to suggestion.</v>

3048
02:16:47.590 --> 02:16:50.020
<v Speaker 2>I would just be talking about in my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know.</v>

3049
02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:55.240
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine though there was a broad</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum of reasons why someone becomes</v>

3050
02:16:55.241 --> 02:16:59.260
<v Speaker 2>transgender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them being that they literally</v>

3051
02:16:59.261 --> 02:17:01.150
<v Speaker 2>have the wrong programming in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

3052
02:17:01.240 --> 02:17:04.240
<v Speaker 2>Some of them being that they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they could have thought that they</v>

3053
02:17:04.241 --> 02:17:06.010
<v Speaker 2>were fucking Wood Elf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3054
02:17:06.070 --> 02:17:08.680
<v Speaker 2>or the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the furry shit is the weird shit.</v>

3055
02:17:08.710 --> 02:17:12.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But very shit too is like I've talked to</v>

3056
02:17:12.191 --> 02:17:13.024
<v Speaker 2>some furries.</v>

3057
02:17:13.460 --> 02:17:15.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking other kids,</v>

3058
02:17:15.460 --> 02:17:16.750
<v Speaker 3>that's the shit I'm thinking of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other</v>

3059
02:17:16.820 --> 02:17:19.490
<v Speaker 2>can shit is nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also people that identify</v>

3060
02:17:19.491 --> 02:17:22.880
<v Speaker 2>with being a six year old girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's been cases where people</v>

3061
02:17:22.881 --> 02:17:25.400
<v Speaker 2>identify as being much younger than they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are and they think they should be able</v>

3062
02:17:25.401 --> 02:17:26.690
<v Speaker 2>to have sex with young kids.</v>

3063
02:17:26.820 --> 02:17:29.160
<v Speaker 3>So I feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So on the transgender one,</v>

3064
02:17:29.161 --> 02:17:32.850
<v Speaker 3>I feel like for a very long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I understood it at all.</v>

3065
02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:38.360
<v Speaker 3>And then I think I finally got it when</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was explained to me like,</v>

3066
02:17:38.551 --> 02:17:41.340
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine that you as a straight,</v>

3067
02:17:41.790 --> 02:17:43.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>CIS gender male,</v>

3068
02:17:44.170 --> 02:17:45.660
<v Speaker 3>if I use that term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

3069
02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:48.660
<v Speaker 3>don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a child.</v>

3070
02:17:48.810 --> 02:17:52.260
<v Speaker 3>Let's say I walk outside and I'm forced</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time I go outside to wear a</v>

3071
02:17:52.261 --> 02:17:56.280
<v Speaker 3>fucking wig and lipstick and high heels</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a fucking dress and I'd be mortified</v>

3072
02:17:56.281 --> 02:17:58.620
<v Speaker 3>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not who the fuck I am and why am</v>

3073
02:17:58.621 --> 02:17:59.790
<v Speaker 3>I wearing this shit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3074
02:18:00.060 --> 02:18:02.970
<v Speaker 3>So if you think the first point you</v>
<v Speaker 3>made,</v>

3075
02:18:02.971 --> 02:18:03.601
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3076
02:18:03.601 --> 02:18:06.300
<v Speaker 3>maybe they were just born with the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>programming that they're born</v>

3077
02:18:06.301 --> 02:18:08.460
<v Speaker 3>biologically male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're really feel like they're a</v>

3078
02:18:08.461 --> 02:18:09.300
<v Speaker 3>woman or vice versa.</v>

3079
02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:14.280
<v Speaker 3>So if that's the case and it's basically</v>
<v Speaker 3>like torture for them to not be the</v>

3080
02:18:14.281 --> 02:18:17.220
<v Speaker 3>other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then I kind of understand that and</v>

3081
02:18:17.221 --> 02:18:20.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm in favor of them being able to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>that surgery where they lose me,</v>

3082
02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:24.000
<v Speaker 3>not transgender people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I get lost in this whole</v>

3083
02:18:24.001 --> 02:18:27.210
<v Speaker 3>conversation is like the gender fluidity</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

3084
02:18:27.630 --> 02:18:29.850
<v Speaker 3>like I was a male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I'm a woman and now I'm a man again.</v>

3085
02:18:29.851 --> 02:18:31.500
<v Speaker 3>And then a woman again and then I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 3>man again.</v>

3086
02:18:31.890 --> 02:18:33.800
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

3087
02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.060
<v Speaker 3>it's like you have a person at a certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>

3088
02:18:36.150 --> 02:18:38.430
<v Speaker 3>there are things that are real and there</v>
<v Speaker 3>are things that are not real.</v>

3089
02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:43.520
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like it delegitimizes the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ones that are real when you go to goofy</v>

3090
02:18:43.891 --> 02:18:46.520
<v Speaker 3>and too far and you try to pretend like</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender fluidity is a thing.</v>

3091
02:18:46.620 --> 02:18:47.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it what we're talking about</v>

3092
02:18:47.881 --> 02:18:49.460
<v Speaker 3>earlier when we were talking about left</v>
<v Speaker 3>wing</v>

3093
02:18:49.490 --> 02:18:54.020
<v Speaker 2>people versus right wing people that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>in in the term left wing people,</v>

3094
02:18:54.021 --> 02:18:57.350
<v Speaker 2>anybody can join and you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like the green haired people that</v>

3095
02:18:57.351 --> 02:19:01.700
<v Speaker 2>were disrupting heather hiring speech</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she was saying there's a</v>

3096
02:19:01.701 --> 02:19:04.310
<v Speaker 2>difference between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get those nutty fuckers</v>

3097
02:19:04.430 --> 02:19:07.400
<v Speaker 2>and then you're going to get people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are just reasonable people that happened</v>

3098
02:19:07.401 --> 02:19:09.860
<v Speaker 2>to be progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get that with gender</v>

3099
02:19:09.861 --> 02:19:11.780
<v Speaker 2>fluidity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get that with people</v>

3100
02:19:11.781 --> 02:19:13.730
<v Speaker 2>that are transgender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get that with people</v>

3101
02:19:13.731 --> 02:19:15.050
<v Speaker 2>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3102
02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:20.620
<v Speaker 2>it just going to get a wide variety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to nail things down,</v>

3103
02:19:20.670 --> 02:19:21.440
<v Speaker 2>decide,</v>

3104
02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:25.640
<v Speaker 3>but for like for everybody who looks at</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and then gets turned off to that</v>

3105
02:19:25.641 --> 02:19:26.361
<v Speaker 3>and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

3106
02:19:26.361 --> 02:19:29.060
<v Speaker 3>I align with the right wing because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that culture stuff.</v>

3107
02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:31.520
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get that feeling over the culture</v>

3108
02:19:31.521 --> 02:19:32.690
<v Speaker 3>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

3109
02:19:32.691 --> 02:19:37.100
<v Speaker 3>the point that I would make to them is</v>
<v Speaker 3>just don't forget that when I talk about</v>

3110
02:19:37.101 --> 02:19:39.590
<v Speaker 3>politics and when I talk about where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>fall on the political spectrum,</v>

3111
02:19:39.740 --> 02:19:41.230
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I break it down toward the,</v>

3112
02:19:41.310 --> 02:19:44.690
<v Speaker 3>on policy and where I fall on the policy</v>
<v Speaker 3>issues and what we should implement,</v>

3113
02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:47.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in order to fix the country.</v>

3114
02:19:47.390 --> 02:19:49.970
<v Speaker 3>And on those issues like we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about earlier,</v>

3115
02:19:50.370 --> 02:19:54.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty reliably left wing and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>polls show that the American people</v>

3116
02:19:54.171 --> 02:19:58.880
<v Speaker 3>actually lean in that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you focus on those issues,</v>

3117
02:19:58.881 --> 02:20:01.370
<v Speaker 3>the economic issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the substantive issues that change</v>

3118
02:20:01.371 --> 02:20:03.080
<v Speaker 3>people's lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

3119
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:04.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3120
02:20:04.460 --> 02:20:08.660
<v Speaker 3>I think that one can look at the culture</v>
<v Speaker 3>issues as almost like a diversion</v>

3121
02:20:08.661 --> 02:20:13.661
<v Speaker 3>because it really is a gateway to other</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas that I think are terrible.</v>

3122
02:20:14.660 --> 02:20:19.660
<v Speaker 3>So I think the idea of people on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>left calling out that goofiness is a</v>

3123
02:20:20.721 --> 02:20:23.330
<v Speaker 3>good thing that you can redirect them</v>
<v Speaker 3>and be like,</v>

3124
02:20:23.331 --> 02:20:25.550
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I actually stand for.</v>

3125
02:20:25.551 --> 02:20:28.940
<v Speaker 3>This is what people who are on the left</v>
<v Speaker 3>and want to improve people's lives</v>

3126
02:20:28.970 --> 02:20:31.600
<v Speaker 3>really want to fight for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3127
02:20:32.890 --> 02:20:36.330
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to Douglas Murray about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this yesterday and there's just this</v>

3128
02:20:36.331 --> 02:20:39.960
<v Speaker 2>thing where everyone was forced to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Caitlyn Jenner is beautiful.</v>

3129
02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:42.050
<v Speaker 2>Like you couldn't just accept that she</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a woman.</v>

3130
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:44.220
<v Speaker 2>You were forced to say that she was</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful and that she is</v>

3131
02:20:44.280 --> 02:20:47.690
<v Speaker 3>hero and that's where you get the</v>
<v Speaker 3>gateway to the right because people go,</v>

3132
02:20:47.691 --> 02:20:49.350
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're going to tell me</v>

3133
02:20:49.370 --> 02:20:52.160
<v Speaker 3>represents the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then go fuck yourself because you're</v>

3134
02:20:52.161 --> 02:20:53.870
<v Speaker 3>just not being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not telling the truth.</v>

3135
02:20:53.950 --> 02:20:55.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not so and it's.</v>

3136
02:20:56.200 --> 02:20:58.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate the thing where it's like we have</v>

3137
02:20:58.071 --> 02:21:02.060
<v Speaker 3>to care more about feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't what's accurate,</v>

3138
02:21:02.120 --> 02:21:06.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know why there needs to be a</v>

3139
02:21:06.350 --> 02:21:11.320
<v Speaker 3>giant wave on the left of the take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No bullshit approach to stuff.</v>

3140
02:21:11.550 --> 02:21:12.190
<v Speaker 3>Why</v>

3141
02:21:12.190 --> 02:21:15.410
<v Speaker 2>comes to the transgender thing too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're there.</v>

3142
02:21:15.940 --> 02:21:20.940
<v Speaker 2>You need to be open to all avenues of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this discussion and one thing that I</v>

3143
02:21:22.841 --> 02:21:27.040
<v Speaker 2>think we need to be open to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to think very carefully about</v>

3144
02:21:27.041 --> 02:21:30.700
<v Speaker 2>why it is that someone needs surgery to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be themselves.</v>

3145
02:21:31.090 --> 02:21:33.960
<v Speaker 2>Why it is that someone needs exogenous</v>
<v Speaker 2>hormones that,</v>

3146
02:21:33.980 --> 02:21:38.650
<v Speaker 2>that aren't native to their biology to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be themselves like someone who wants to</v>

3147
02:21:38.651 --> 02:21:42.550
<v Speaker 2>take estrogen is born a male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone if you feel that you're a woman</v>

3148
02:21:43.110 --> 02:21:45.430
<v Speaker 2>or you feel that you're in the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>

3149
02:21:47.860 --> 02:21:52.860
<v Speaker 2>does it make sense that nature wants you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get surgery?</v>

3150
02:21:53.230 --> 02:21:57.220
<v Speaker 2>Does it make sense that nature wants you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take hormones that don't exist in</v>

3151
02:21:57.221 --> 02:21:58.054
<v Speaker 2>your body?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3152
02:21:58.210 --> 02:22:02.530
<v Speaker 2>is this as.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a rational area of contention</v>

3153
02:22:02.531 --> 02:22:04.210
<v Speaker 2>and discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something that people should</v>

3154
02:22:04.211 --> 02:22:08.410
<v Speaker 2>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you say if someone is forced</v>

3155
02:22:08.411 --> 02:22:11.170
<v Speaker 2>to wear lipstick and high heels and make</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and walking down the street,</v>

3156
02:22:11.171 --> 02:22:12.130
<v Speaker 2>but that's not who you are.</v>

3157
02:22:12.190 --> 02:22:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't that frustrate you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3158
02:22:13.751 --> 02:22:17.170
<v Speaker 2>it would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't necessarily conversely</v>

3159
02:22:17.171 --> 02:22:20.830
<v Speaker 2>work where you are walking down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>street without lipstick and high heels</v>

3160
02:22:20.831 --> 02:22:22.780
<v Speaker 2>and makeup and you saying that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm supposed to have.</v>

3161
02:22:22.810 --> 02:22:23.111
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3162
02:22:23.111 --> 02:22:27.510
<v Speaker 2>because that's not real like lipstick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As something you choose to apply high</v>

3163
02:22:27.511 --> 02:22:31.950
<v Speaker 2>heels or something you choose to wear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no one's forcing you to not have</v>

3164
02:22:31.951 --> 02:22:35.370
<v Speaker 2>those things on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you saying that those things are what</v>

3165
02:22:35.371 --> 02:22:36.300
<v Speaker 2>you really are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3166
02:22:36.301 --> 02:22:37.950
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're adding those things to you.</v>

3167
02:22:38.130 --> 02:22:40.020
<v Speaker 2>What you really are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

3168
02:22:40.021 --> 02:22:42.090
<v Speaker 2>makeup naked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wake up in the morning,</v>

3169
02:22:42.091 --> 02:22:44.280
<v Speaker 2>take off your clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where the fuck you really are.</v>

3170
02:22:44.490 --> 02:22:48.030
<v Speaker 2>If you say that you should have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to wear makeup and the right to</v>

3171
02:22:48.031 --> 02:22:49.620
<v Speaker 2>wear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course she had the right,</v>

3172
02:22:49.621 --> 02:22:52.950
<v Speaker 2>so get your face tattooed like a mowery</v>
<v Speaker 2>should have the right to do whatever the</v>

3173
02:22:52.951 --> 02:22:56.340
<v Speaker 2>fuck you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that that's who you really are,</v>

3174
02:22:56.341 --> 02:22:58.530
<v Speaker 2>that that's somehow your true self.</v>

3175
02:22:58.770 --> 02:23:01.980
<v Speaker 2>There might be an underlying</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological issue there that's</v>

3176
02:23:01.981 --> 02:23:06.981
<v Speaker 2>relevant and to discuss that puts you in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this category of being transphobic or</v>

3177
02:23:07.021 --> 02:23:11.880
<v Speaker 2>insensitive or or right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's accurate or fair</v>

3178
02:23:11.940 --> 02:23:14.580
<v Speaker 2>because I think this is a real weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

3179
02:23:14.700 --> 02:23:17.940
<v Speaker 2>It's very weird and I think the only</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that truly understand it are the</v>

3180
02:23:17.941 --> 02:23:19.560
<v Speaker 2>people that are going through it</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

3181
02:23:20.250 --> 02:23:22.610
<v Speaker 2>the people that actually haven't and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

3182
02:23:22.620 --> 02:23:24.570
<v Speaker 2>we can call upon those people to explain</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to us,</v>

3183
02:23:24.571 --> 02:23:26.850
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a broad spectrum of answers from</v>

3184
02:23:26.851 --> 02:23:28.650
<v Speaker 2>those people as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if,</v>

3185
02:23:28.651 --> 02:23:33.651
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what if it is kind of like depression</v>

3186
02:23:34.321 --> 02:23:35.410
<v Speaker 2>in a way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if some,</v>

3187
02:23:35.411 --> 02:23:37.830
<v Speaker 2>if you give chemical assistance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is somebody who's going through</v>

3188
02:23:37.831 --> 02:23:40.230
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody goes bright good because you</v>

3189
02:23:40.231 --> 02:23:43.350
<v Speaker 2>want that person to feel like they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy and all necessarily even think</v>

3190
02:23:43.351 --> 02:23:44.184
<v Speaker 2>that that's good.</v>

3191
02:23:44.220 --> 02:23:48.110
<v Speaker 2>I think exhaust all other possibilities</v>
<v Speaker 2>first including exercise and diet and</v>

3192
02:23:48.190 --> 02:23:48.961
<v Speaker 2>that's sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

3193
02:23:48.961 --> 02:23:52.260
<v Speaker 2>But there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are examples of people who do</v>

3194
02:23:52.261 --> 02:23:54.390
<v Speaker 2>have that genuine chemical imbalance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do,</v>

3195
02:23:54.391 --> 02:23:57.000
<v Speaker 2>but why do they have that genuine</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemical imbalance?</v>

3196
02:23:57.810 --> 02:23:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Johann Hari on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's.</v>

3197
02:23:59.960 --> 02:24:00.601
<v Speaker 2>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3198
02:24:00.601 --> 02:24:04.290
<v Speaker 2>and he makes a lot of really good points</v>
<v Speaker 2>about like what is it that's happening</v>

3199
02:24:04.291 --> 02:24:06.300
<v Speaker 2>in your life with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it your,</v>

3200
02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:08.910
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your situation with your relationship,</v>

3201
02:24:08.911 --> 02:24:10.170
<v Speaker 2>your career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life,</v>

3202
02:24:10.171 --> 02:24:12.150
<v Speaker 2>your health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different things need to be</v>

3203
02:24:12.151 --> 02:24:15.630
<v Speaker 2>taken into consideration instead of just</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting some duck tape over it in the</v>

3204
02:24:15.631 --> 02:24:19.650
<v Speaker 2>term of these SSRI and all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>different psych medications,</v>

3205
02:24:19.651 --> 02:24:22.800
<v Speaker 2>if they're handing out just as easy as</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're handing out oxycontin's,</v>

3206
02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:24.650
<v Speaker 2>they're passing these fucking things</v>
<v Speaker 2>around here.</v>

3207
02:24:24.670 --> 02:24:27.690
<v Speaker 2>Only overlap for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Radically affect your consciousness.</v>

3208
02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:31.920
<v Speaker 2>So let's say everybody has all their</v>
<v Speaker 2>ducks in a row and they're exercising,</v>

3209
02:24:31.921 --> 02:24:34.050
<v Speaker 2>they're eating healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing everything by the book.</v>

3210
02:24:34.050 --> 02:24:36.150
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at it on paper,</v>

3211
02:24:36.151 --> 02:24:36.871
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

3212
02:24:36.871 --> 02:24:38.390
<v Speaker 2>that person should be healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's,</v>

3213
02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:39.660
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck's her name?</v>

3214
02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:40.171
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cara,</v>

3215
02:24:40.171 --> 02:24:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Santa Maria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who you've had on the podcast before.</v>

3216
02:24:42.391 --> 02:24:43.350
<v Speaker 2>And she talks about how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

3217
02:24:43.351 --> 02:24:46.530
<v Speaker 2>I was depressed and they tried a whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of different antidepressants.</v>

3218
02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:49.560
<v Speaker 2>They finally got me on one that worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she says like,</v>

3219
02:24:49.561 --> 02:24:51.090
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want people to understand.</v>

3220
02:24:51.091 --> 02:24:53.910
<v Speaker 2>You need to look at this like treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at it like,</v>

3221
02:24:53.911 --> 02:24:54.451
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3222
02:24:54.451 --> 02:24:57.480
<v Speaker 2>I've got a fucking disease and they got</v>
<v Speaker 2>to give me antibiotics in order to feel</v>

3223
02:24:57.481 --> 02:24:59.970
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with us as real scientists</v>

3224
02:24:59.971 --> 02:25:02.790
<v Speaker 2>and doctors to disagree with that and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know if she exhausted every other</v>

3225
02:25:02.791 --> 02:25:07.410
<v Speaker 2>possibility and Kara,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she worships at the throne of science</v>

3226
02:25:07.530 --> 02:25:10.200
<v Speaker 2>and she thinks that this is the way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>handle it and she might be right.</v>

3227
02:25:10.620 --> 02:25:14.430
<v Speaker 2>It also might be possible that if she</v>
<v Speaker 2>had rigorous exercise on a daily basis,</v>

3228
02:25:14.670 --> 02:25:18.240
<v Speaker 2>cleaned up her diet and did a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>other things that maybe that would be</v>

3229
02:25:18.241 --> 02:25:20.490
<v Speaker 2>just as effective if not more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3230
02:25:20.530 --> 02:25:22.260
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what she's done,</v>

3231
02:25:22.710 --> 02:25:26.200
<v Speaker 2>but I that automatically assuming that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3232
02:25:26.290 --> 02:25:28.630
<v Speaker 2>this blanket statement called</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>

3233
02:25:28.660 --> 02:25:30.520
<v Speaker 2>which could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that even mean?</v>

3234
02:25:30.521 --> 02:25:31.960
<v Speaker 2>You're not happy with your station in</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

3235
02:25:31.961 --> 02:25:33.760
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not happy with your body?</v>

3236
02:25:33.761 --> 02:25:35.500
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it means.</v>

3237
02:25:35.690 --> 02:25:37.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you tell me that you have it.</v>

3238
02:25:37.661 --> 02:25:40.450
<v Speaker 2>You know what it is when you have it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how do you know that what you have</v>

3239
02:25:40.510 --> 02:25:44.350
<v Speaker 2>is the same as what that guy has with</v>
<v Speaker 2>what she has or what other great sure we</v>

3240
02:25:44.351 --> 02:25:48.610
<v Speaker 2>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we do know is the human body reacts</v>

3241
02:25:49.090 --> 02:25:50.470
<v Speaker 2>in very different ways.</v>

3242
02:25:50.470 --> 02:25:55.300
<v Speaker 2>When it's well fed with nutrients and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you exercise on a daily basis,</v>

3243
02:25:55.450 --> 02:25:58.660
<v Speaker 2>you flood your body with a natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>endorphins that come from that exercise.</v>

3244
02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:01.390
<v Speaker 2>When you surround yourself with a loving</v>
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>

3245
02:26:01.570 --> 02:26:04.240
<v Speaker 2>when you engage in things that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>rewarding to you,</v>

3246
02:26:04.450 --> 02:26:07.720
<v Speaker 2>all these things have a very positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>effect on the way your mind works as</v>

3247
02:26:07.721 --> 02:26:11.050
<v Speaker 2>well as the way your body feels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That way your body feels has a positive</v>

3248
02:26:11.051 --> 02:26:14.320
<v Speaker 2>result on the way your mind works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To think of either one of being</v>

3249
02:26:14.321 --> 02:26:16.150
<v Speaker 2>independent of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's ignorant.</v>

3250
02:26:16.151 --> 02:26:19.540
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has the same and there's radical.</v>

3251
02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:22.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a depressed person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel way better after I exercise.</v>

3252
02:26:22.751 --> 02:26:25.660
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's science on that that says</v>

3253
02:26:25.661 --> 02:26:27.130
<v Speaker 2>when you exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eat right.</v>

3254
02:26:27.131 --> 02:26:29.410
<v Speaker 2>Of course you're going to get at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely get a boost in your mood,</v>

3255
02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:32.380
<v Speaker 2>but it's hard to do and that's why</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like to take a pill and that's</v>

3256
02:26:32.381 --> 02:26:33.100
<v Speaker 2>totally true.</v>

3257
02:26:33.100 --> 02:26:36.850
<v Speaker 2>And he also liked to justify their</v>
<v Speaker 2>actions when people take a pill and that</v>

3258
02:26:36.851 --> 02:26:38.320
<v Speaker 2>pill is effective and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3259
02:26:38.321 --> 02:26:40.900
<v Speaker 2>this is my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what did it for me.</v>

3260
02:26:41.110 --> 02:26:41.943
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3261
02:26:41.950 --> 02:26:45.130
<v Speaker 2>but at what cost?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So can you orgasm anymore?</v>

3262
02:26:45.131 --> 02:26:47.890
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of shit that happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>to people that when they take those</v>

3263
02:26:47.891 --> 02:26:49.720
<v Speaker 2>fucking things it really fuck them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3264
02:26:49.930 --> 02:26:52.840
<v Speaker 2>So if you're making the point that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're overprescribed and people rely</v>

3265
02:26:52.841 --> 02:26:55.410
<v Speaker 2>on them too much and it's part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture in a negative way,</v>

3266
02:26:55.630 --> 02:26:56.760
<v Speaker 2>totally agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3267
02:26:57.070 --> 02:26:59.260
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we look at the example of say</v>

3268
02:26:59.261 --> 02:27:03.010
<v Speaker 2>paranoid schizophrenia where it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody who literally see shit that's</v>

3269
02:27:03.011 --> 02:27:06.180
<v Speaker 2>not there and it's a genuine</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological disorder where they needed</v>

3270
02:27:06.220 --> 02:27:08.440
<v Speaker 2>very powerful drug like seroquel or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

3271
02:27:09.010 --> 02:27:13.960
<v Speaker 2>So in the case of transgenderism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if it's more analogous to a mental</v>

3272
02:27:13.961 --> 02:27:16.230
<v Speaker 2>state that's as real as that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the,</v>

3273
02:27:16.420 --> 02:27:16.930
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

3274
02:27:16.930 --> 02:27:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Like a business solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surgery,</v>

3275
02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:22.120
<v Speaker 2>sexual reassignment surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how do we even know,</v>

3276
02:27:22.210 --> 02:27:24.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then this gets back to the point you</v>

3277
02:27:24.041 --> 02:27:26.170
<v Speaker 2>made about the personal freedom angle of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it where they say,</v>

3278
02:27:26.171 --> 02:27:27.730
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do this and this is what I</v>

3279
02:27:27.731 --> 02:27:29.260
<v Speaker 2>want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely think they should have</v>

3280
02:27:29.261 --> 02:27:31.390
<v Speaker 2>personal freedom to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like they think they should have</v>

3281
02:27:31.391 --> 02:27:34.690
<v Speaker 2>personal freedom to get their fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>nose pierced and do whatever you want to</v>

3282
02:27:34.691 --> 02:27:37.150
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But should you have to pay for it?</v>

3283
02:27:37.810 --> 02:27:39.220
<v Speaker 2>Well that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that gets into the broader</v>

3284
02:27:39.221 --> 02:27:42.610
<v Speaker 2>conversation about who should pay for</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical coverage period,</v>

3285
02:27:43.300 --> 02:27:45.520
<v Speaker 2>but is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this an elective thing?</v>

3286
02:27:45.550 --> 02:27:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Like how about girls that identify with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a girl who has big tits identified as</v>

3287
02:27:50.070 --> 02:27:52.660
<v Speaker 2>big tits and I have a little tits and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying the line is fucking</v>

3288
02:27:52.750 --> 02:27:53.170
<v Speaker 2>blurry.</v>

3289
02:27:53.170 --> 02:27:55.510
<v Speaker 2>Well it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly the same thing.</v>

3290
02:27:55.870 --> 02:27:59.080
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing in terms of you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like your physical state and you</v>

3291
02:27:59.081 --> 02:28:02.410
<v Speaker 2>want someone to change it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you say you would be happy if you</v>

3292
02:28:02.411 --> 02:28:05.740
<v Speaker 2>had d cups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have a cups and you're convinced</v>

3293
02:28:05.741 --> 02:28:08.980
<v Speaker 2>this is the key to our happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is that any different than a person</v>

3294
02:28:09.100 --> 02:28:10.810
<v Speaker 2>and you could get mad at me all you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>

3295
02:28:10.811 --> 02:28:12.790
<v Speaker 2>but you were talking about the physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

3296
02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.270
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To physical state of someone like how,</v>

3297
02:28:15.290 --> 02:28:19.780
<v Speaker 2>how can you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you say that the only way to fix</v>

3298
02:28:19.781 --> 02:28:24.160
<v Speaker 2>this or how could you offer that up as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible avenue that these people that</v>

3299
02:28:24.170 --> 02:28:25.460
<v Speaker 2>can pursue it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

3300
02:28:25.461 --> 02:28:27.950
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's any surgery that can help you</v>

3301
02:28:28.850 --> 02:28:30.980
<v Speaker 2>and you want other people to pay for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that surgery,</v>

3302
02:28:31.100 --> 02:28:33.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just because it's it pertains to gender</v>

3303
02:28:34.010 --> 02:28:35.660
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean we have to automatically</v>
<v Speaker 2>act.</v>

3304
02:28:35.670 --> 02:28:37.040
<v Speaker 2>We ask.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's.</v>

3305
02:28:37.100 --> 02:28:41.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's rational and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to breasts or other other</v>

3306
02:28:41.481 --> 02:28:45.830
<v Speaker 2>various elective surgeries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I strongly feel that people should pay</v>

3307
02:28:45.831 --> 02:28:47.120
<v Speaker 2>for those themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3308
02:28:47.140 --> 02:28:48.110
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

3309
02:28:48.111 --> 02:28:52.240
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to the example you give</v>
<v Speaker 2>about breasts,</v>

3310
02:28:52.390 --> 02:28:55.430
<v Speaker 2>but I totally agree 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that different than sex change?</v>

3311
02:28:55.460 --> 02:28:57.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it is either.</v>

3312
02:28:57.650 --> 02:28:59.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3313
02:29:00.020 --> 02:29:02.510
<v Speaker 2>if that is the case where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

3314
02:29:02.511 --> 02:29:05.360
<v Speaker 2>I haven't read the science on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure there has been silence on</v>

3315
02:29:05.361 --> 02:29:09.410
<v Speaker 2>this and they've answered the question</v>
<v Speaker 2>as to whether or not doing that surgery</v>

3316
02:29:09.650 --> 02:29:11.270
<v Speaker 2>is effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's not?</v>

3317
02:29:11.271 --> 02:29:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a massive massive suicide rate.</v>

3318
02:29:14.181 --> 02:29:17.630
<v Speaker 2>It's over 40 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even even post operation.</v>

3319
02:29:17.730 --> 02:29:20.200
<v Speaker 2>And I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I wrong in my assumption that pre</v>

3320
02:29:20.201 --> 02:29:22.400
<v Speaker 2>operation death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when more the suicides are versus</v>

3321
02:29:22.430 --> 02:29:24.220
<v Speaker 2>postop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it changes.</v>

3322
02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:25.330
<v Speaker 2>Pretty show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if,</v>

3323
02:29:25.330 --> 02:29:26.900
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's be accurate about this.</v>

3324
02:29:27.530 --> 02:29:29.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide rates,</v>

3325
02:29:29.031 --> 02:29:32.480
<v Speaker 2>pre post transgender sexual reassignment</v>
<v Speaker 2>operations.</v>

3326
02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:35.990
<v Speaker 2>I am pretty sure that it's very similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it doesn't change.</v>

3327
02:29:35.991 --> 02:29:39.050
<v Speaker 2>And then there's also causation versus</v>
<v Speaker 2>correlation,</v>

3328
02:29:39.051 --> 02:29:40.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it because they were depressed</v>

3329
02:29:40.521 --> 02:29:43.250
<v Speaker 2>because they were in the wrong body that</v>
<v Speaker 2>lead them down this road and now here</v>

3330
02:29:43.251 --> 02:29:45.380
<v Speaker 2>they are and they just can't get past</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3331
02:29:45.410 --> 02:29:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Even if they have the surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's still bummed out.</v>

3332
02:29:47.211 --> 02:29:49.490
<v Speaker 2>They're not accepted by society as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>

3333
02:29:49.640 --> 02:29:52.640
<v Speaker 2>even if a become a trans woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're still not accepted by society.</v>

3334
02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:57.320
<v Speaker 2>And could that be changed by us being</v>
<v Speaker 2>more open minded and loving and nature?</v>

3335
02:29:57.321 --> 02:29:58.730
<v Speaker 2>Is it nurture?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it the environment?</v>

3336
02:29:58.731 --> 02:30:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Is it in the person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what.</v>

3337
02:30:00.650 --> 02:30:03.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it is legitimate mental health</v>

3338
02:30:03.351 --> 02:30:04.880
<v Speaker 2>disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which appears to be called,</v>

3339
02:30:04.881 --> 02:30:06.500
<v Speaker 2>it used to be called gender dysphoria.</v>

3340
02:30:06.500 --> 02:30:08.330
<v Speaker 2>And now if you used the term gender</v>
<v Speaker 2>dysphoria,</v>

3341
02:30:08.331 --> 02:30:10.610
<v Speaker 2>it's hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it turns the bus.</v>

3342
02:30:10.611 --> 02:30:13.110
<v Speaker 2>Talking about this might get this</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast demonetized.</v>

3343
02:30:13.140 --> 02:30:15.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it will be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably will be.</v>

3344
02:30:15.400 --> 02:30:20.400
<v Speaker 2>If it is gender dysphoria then wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually be a medical condition where</v>

3345
02:30:20.481 --> 02:30:23.120
<v Speaker 2>the treatment should be paid for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>

3346
02:30:23.450 --> 02:30:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Is that the correct treatment for gender</v>
<v Speaker 2>dysphoria?</v>

3347
02:30:26.030 --> 02:30:28.430
<v Speaker 2>Is that the correct treatment for</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who thinks that they should have</v>

3348
02:30:28.431 --> 02:30:30.590
<v Speaker 2>no hand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should you chop that handoff?</v>

3349
02:30:30.980 --> 02:30:32.090
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3350
02:30:32.320 --> 02:30:34.250
<v Speaker 2>She you chop a penis off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3351
02:30:34.251 --> 02:30:36.970
<v Speaker 2>That's what Caitlyn Jenner did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

3352
02:30:37.020 --> 02:30:40.070
<v Speaker 2>did you get did eventually?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the muscle area statement after she</v>

3353
02:30:40.071 --> 02:30:43.700
<v Speaker 2>did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said that she is no more of a woman</v>

3354
02:30:43.701 --> 02:30:45.530
<v Speaker 2>now that she was before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then,</v>

3355
02:30:45.531 --> 02:30:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely keep your dick.</v>

3356
02:30:48.050 --> 02:30:48.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point.</v>

3357
02:30:49.640 --> 02:30:53.050
<v Speaker 2>If you were still a woman before and</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much everybody except now,</v>

3358
02:30:53.090 --> 02:30:55.190
<v Speaker 2>which is why I did this really radical</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing like no.</v>

3359
02:30:55.191 --> 02:30:57.560
<v Speaker 2>Well you did admit that you did that for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reason,</v>

3360
02:30:57.561 --> 02:30:59.660
<v Speaker 2>that you really wanted to do it and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's different.</v>

3361
02:30:59.661 --> 02:31:00.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

3362
02:31:00.650 --> 02:31:04.310
<v Speaker 2>maybe street creds letter her to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>the operation to fully get.</v>

3363
02:31:04.340 --> 02:31:08.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's fully accepted by that</v>
<v Speaker 2>community and become a spokesperson,</v>

3364
02:31:08.040 --> 02:31:09.890
<v Speaker 2>but the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's funny because she's,</v>

3365
02:31:10.730 --> 02:31:14.720
<v Speaker 2>she's super right wing on other issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember when she went on she was like,</v>

3366
02:31:14.750 --> 02:31:17.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm a very traditional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a traditional.</v>

3367
02:31:17.601 --> 02:31:18.434
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3368
02:31:20.630 --> 02:31:22.440
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of people in the Trans</v>
<v Speaker 2>community where like,</v>

3369
02:31:22.441 --> 02:31:23.191
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck her.</v>

3370
02:31:23.191 --> 02:31:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Because she was out there arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget it was gay marriage marriage,</v>

3371
02:31:26.611 --> 02:31:28.740
<v Speaker 2>but then there was another one where</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's talking about economics and she</v>

3372
02:31:28.741 --> 02:31:29.081
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3373
02:31:29.081 --> 02:31:30.720
<v Speaker 2>like pull yourself up by your</v>
<v Speaker 2>bootstraps.</v>

3374
02:31:30.721 --> 02:31:33.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like fucking privileged prick</v>
<v Speaker 2>without.</v>

3375
02:31:33.190 --> 02:31:35.730
<v Speaker 2>How much money do you have for just</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting around all day and getting paid</v>

3376
02:31:35.731 --> 02:31:38.580
<v Speaker 2>from the Kardashians?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a mail card dash in the show is</v>

3377
02:31:38.581 --> 02:31:42.120
<v Speaker 2>was Swiss shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What she's on that fucking frivolous,</v>

3378
02:31:42.121 --> 02:31:47.121
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous show and she became a really</v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarre side note and pop culture and</v>

3379
02:31:47.641 --> 02:31:48.480
<v Speaker 2>that's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3380
02:31:48.481 --> 02:31:50.850
<v Speaker 2>when you listen to her talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like one of the worst spokespeople</v>

3381
02:31:50.851 --> 02:31:53.420
<v Speaker 2>ever for the Trans Community and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of trans people say that they're like,</v>

3382
02:31:53.430 --> 02:31:55.300
<v Speaker 2>we don't want her as.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they're,</v>

3383
02:31:55.350 --> 02:31:58.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you trans people are individually.</v>

3384
02:31:58.680 --> 02:32:01.470
<v Speaker 2>So you left a look at people like</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're individuals and when they,</v>

3385
02:32:01.530 --> 02:32:04.920
<v Speaker 2>when somebody put out as this is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>leader of this movement.</v>

3386
02:32:04.921 --> 02:32:06.980
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that makes her examples.</v>

3387
02:32:07.470 --> 02:32:09.360
<v Speaker 2>The one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the woman who created Sirius satellite</v>

3388
02:32:09.361 --> 02:32:12.000
<v Speaker 2>radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she also created a satellite navigation</v>

3389
02:32:12.001 --> 02:32:12.990
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She used to be a man,</v>

3390
02:32:13.230 --> 02:32:14.370
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

3391
02:32:14.371 --> 02:32:18.320
<v Speaker 2>very brilliant person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I interviewed her for Phi,</v>

3392
02:32:18.330 --> 02:32:19.950
<v Speaker 2>for that Joe Rogan questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything show.</v>

3393
02:32:20.370 --> 02:32:25.020
<v Speaker 2>She created a model of her wife who they</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually had babies together and then</v>

3394
02:32:25.021 --> 02:32:28.610
<v Speaker 2>she became a woman and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stayed together and she could,</v>

3395
02:32:28.740 --> 02:32:31.830
<v Speaker 2>she created a robot of her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her wife,</v>

3396
02:32:31.980 --> 02:32:36.980
<v Speaker 2>and she's like constantly programming it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and changing it and adding new language</v>

3397
02:32:37.801 --> 02:32:42.570
<v Speaker 2>and new vocabulary to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she thinks eventually as technology</v>

3398
02:32:42.571 --> 02:32:44.190
<v Speaker 2>improves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's going to be able to recreate her</v>

3399
02:32:44.191 --> 02:32:46.260
<v Speaker 2>wife and a robot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

3400
02:32:46.261 --> 02:32:49.220
<v Speaker 2>another great example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brianna Westbrook,</v>

3401
02:32:49.520 --> 02:32:50.100
<v Speaker 2>what does this say?</v>

3402
02:32:50.100 --> 02:32:51.900
<v Speaker 2>They're uncomfortable truth that many</v>
<v Speaker 2>surveys,</v>

3403
02:32:51.901 --> 02:32:56.010
<v Speaker 2>including the 2011 Swedish study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>indicate that suicide rates remain high</v>

3404
02:32:56.250 --> 02:32:59.700
<v Speaker 2>after sex reassignment surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Swedish study reports that people</v>

3405
02:32:59.701 --> 02:33:04.160
<v Speaker 2>have had sex reassignment surgery are 19</v>
<v Speaker 2>times more likely to die by suicide then</v>

3406
02:33:04.190 --> 02:33:06.060
<v Speaker 2>as the general population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To be fair,</v>

3407
02:33:06.061 --> 02:33:08.220
<v Speaker 2>to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see the sources life site news,</v>

3408
02:33:08.221 --> 02:33:09.370
<v Speaker 2>which is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very right wing.</v>

3409
02:33:09.420 --> 02:33:11.400
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the national center for transgender</v>

3410
02:33:11.401 --> 02:33:14.940
<v Speaker 2>equality reported in 2014 that 40</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of the people who identify as</v>

3411
02:33:14.941 --> 02:33:18.150
<v Speaker 2>transgender have attempted suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very well may be true.</v>

3412
02:33:18.151 --> 02:33:21.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that's the national</v>
<v Speaker 2>center for transgender equality or just</v>

3413
02:33:21.571 --> 02:33:26.040
<v Speaker 2>breaking up this article here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the study halo as one is legit.</v>

3414
02:33:26.041 --> 02:33:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3415
02:33:26.610 --> 02:33:27.600
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's legit.</v>

3416
02:33:27.720 --> 02:33:28.553
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3417
02:33:28.710 --> 02:33:31.470
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're reporting facts from studies.</v>

3418
02:33:31.500 --> 02:33:32.070
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3419
02:33:32.070 --> 02:33:35.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is pretty well established that</v>

3420
02:33:35.401 --> 02:33:38.820
<v Speaker 2>there's a high suicide rate amongst</v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender people pre and post</v>

3421
02:33:38.821 --> 02:33:41.410
<v Speaker 2>reassignment surgery for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3422
02:33:41.550 --> 02:33:42.750
<v Speaker 2>we go back to the same thing.</v>

3423
02:33:43.020 --> 02:33:45.660
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't necessarily mean that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't be happy if they weren't just</v>

3424
02:33:45.661 --> 02:33:47.500
<v Speaker 2>fully accepted by society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3425
02:33:47.580 --> 02:33:50.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Caitlyn Jenner's probably</v>

3426
02:33:50.011 --> 02:33:51.840
<v Speaker 2>happier because she gets a shitload of</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention now.</v>

3427
02:33:52.110 --> 02:33:53.870
<v Speaker 2>She was in the shadow behind while I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>over here,</v>

3428
02:33:54.450 --> 02:33:55.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm over here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

3429
02:33:55.681 --> 02:33:56.970
<v Speaker 2>now she's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3430
02:33:56.971 --> 02:33:58.950
<v Speaker 2>front and center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking vogue magazine.</v>

3431
02:33:58.951 --> 02:34:00.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of attention.</v>

3432
02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:03.340
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of a people who would be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>better example and,</v>

3433
02:34:03.370 --> 02:34:04.540
<v Speaker 2>and a better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3434
02:34:04.740 --> 02:34:06.600
<v Speaker 2>face of the transgender movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3435
02:34:06.630 --> 02:34:09.240
<v Speaker 2>Brianna Westbrook is a candidate who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>running for office and there's actually</v>

3436
02:34:09.241 --> 02:34:13.110
<v Speaker 2>a special election today and she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>running for Congress and she's really</v>

3437
02:34:13.111 --> 02:34:14.310
<v Speaker 2>inspirational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3438
02:34:14.320 --> 02:34:16.890
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know about her because I found a</v>

3439
02:34:16.900 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Justice Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a</v>

3440
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:21.220
<v Speaker 1>group that it was going to primary</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate democrats and run candidates</v>

3441
02:34:21.221 --> 02:34:24.160
<v Speaker 1>who take no corporate pac money and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's one of the candidates.</v>

3442
02:34:24.460 --> 02:34:29.460
<v Speaker 1>And what you find is it the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are really respectful are the people who</v>

3443
02:34:31.050 --> 02:34:33.310
<v Speaker 1>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she happens to be transgender,</v>

3444
02:34:33.670 --> 02:34:35.590
<v Speaker 1>but she's not putting that front and</v>
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>

3445
02:34:35.890 --> 02:34:37.060
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a person,</v>

3446
02:34:37.120 --> 02:34:38.320
<v Speaker 1>she's a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3447
02:34:38.321 --> 02:34:40.420
<v Speaker 1>And she's going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here are the things I believe in and I</v>

3448
02:34:40.421 --> 02:34:42.970
<v Speaker 1>think this will improve everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives and I'm gonna run on these issues</v>

3449
02:34:43.060 --> 02:34:44.170
<v Speaker 1>and it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3450
02:34:44.171 --> 02:34:46.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm transgender and if you don't vote</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me then you're a bigot.</v>

3451
02:34:46.540 --> 02:34:47.231
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3452
02:34:47.231 --> 02:34:47.771
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3453
02:34:47.771 --> 02:34:50.750
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think open mindedness is</v>

3454
02:34:51.060 --> 02:34:51.840
<v Speaker 1>incredibly</v>

3455
02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:55.650
<v Speaker 2>cool in our wide diverse society and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people,</v>

3456
02:34:56.100 --> 02:35:00.000
<v Speaker 2>when people push back against that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it creates all sorts of giant problems</v>

3457
02:35:00.001 --> 02:35:02.940
<v Speaker 2>and I just think it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to do whatever you</v>

3458
02:35:02.941 --> 02:35:05.670
<v Speaker 2>want to do and if it doesn't affect you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you care?</v>

3459
02:35:05.671 --> 02:35:06.460
<v Speaker 2>I think we should</v>

3460
02:35:06.460 --> 02:35:08.050
<v Speaker 1>be really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

3461
02:35:08.110 --> 02:35:10.240
<v Speaker 1>really careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what we do to children though,</v>

3462
02:35:10.510 --> 02:35:12.790
<v Speaker 1>and there's a nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw your conversation on that recently</v>

3463
02:35:12.791 --> 02:35:14.080
<v Speaker 1>and I think you made a bunch of good</v>
<v Speaker 1>points.</v>

3464
02:35:14.081 --> 02:35:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Like when is it okay to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

3465
02:35:17.531 --> 02:35:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to do the surgery now you</v>

3466
02:35:19.211 --> 02:35:20.290
<v Speaker 1>can do the surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3467
02:35:20.291 --> 02:35:21.150
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a</v>

3468
02:35:21.430 --> 02:35:24.940
<v Speaker 2>going back to heather hiring and Eric</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weinstein.</v>

3469
02:35:24.970 --> 02:35:26.410
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3470
02:35:26.500 --> 02:35:29.410
<v Speaker 2>an article that I believe Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not Eric,</v>

3471
02:35:29.411 --> 02:35:30.244
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bret,</v>

3472
02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:33.670
<v Speaker 2>Bret Weinstein put up on his twitter</v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday,</v>

3473
02:35:33.730 --> 02:35:36.820
<v Speaker 2>or maybe it was heather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they were discussing,</v>

3474
02:35:37.290 --> 02:35:38.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3475
02:35:39.370 --> 02:35:44.370
<v Speaker 2>this real problem with kids who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>really young where it becomes a trendy</v>

3476
02:35:44.471 --> 02:35:46.600
<v Speaker 2>thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to think that they're in the wrong</v>

3477
02:35:46.601 --> 02:35:50.410
<v Speaker 2>gender and then they get reinforcement</v>
<v Speaker 2>from their very progressive friends who</v>

3478
02:35:50.411 --> 02:35:55.411
<v Speaker 2>also get excited about this idea and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then to intervene surgically or</v>

3479
02:35:56.500 --> 02:35:59.130
<v Speaker 2>chemically when your body is still in</v>
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>

3480
02:35:59.150 --> 02:36:03.730
<v Speaker 2>You're 13 or whatever the fuck you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what you are yet and you</v>

3481
02:36:03.731 --> 02:36:06.430
<v Speaker 2>should be able to give yourself a chance</v>
<v Speaker 2>to grow and develop.</v>

3482
02:36:06.670 --> 02:36:08.350
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree,</v>

3483
02:36:08.351 --> 02:36:10.270
<v Speaker 2>including people that are already</v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender.</v>

3484
02:36:10.450 --> 02:36:14.500
<v Speaker 2>That in my mind they're probably more</v>
<v Speaker 2>supportive of it because they want more</v>

3485
02:36:14.501 --> 02:36:15.334
<v Speaker 2>people to do it.</v>

3486
02:36:15.550 --> 02:36:18.850
<v Speaker 2>Like Steven crowder had this weird thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he and jared,</v>

3487
02:36:18.851 --> 02:36:21.820
<v Speaker 2>that guy that he does his show with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to this meeting and they were</v>

3488
02:36:21.821 --> 02:36:25.900
<v Speaker 2>talking about they just does undercover</v>
<v Speaker 2>film thing where they're talking about</v>

3489
02:36:25.901 --> 02:36:26.770
<v Speaker 2>their six year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3490
02:36:26.800 --> 02:36:29.080
<v Speaker 2>is that too young to transition them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

3491
02:36:29.081 --> 02:36:31.510
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matter of fact studies show that it.</v>

3492
02:36:31.570 --> 02:36:34.000
<v Speaker 2>That's the good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good time to do it and that you</v>

3493
02:36:34.001 --> 02:36:36.550
<v Speaker 2>could transition back if he changes his</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

3494
02:36:36.551 --> 02:36:38.320
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

3495
02:36:38.321 --> 02:36:39.154
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

3496
02:36:39.330 --> 02:36:42.160
<v Speaker 2>He using hormone blockers in a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to radically affect the way</v>

3497
02:36:42.161 --> 02:36:43.690
<v Speaker 2>that kid develops as a grown adult.</v>

3498
02:36:43.770 --> 02:36:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what line is the proper</v>

3499
02:36:47.341 --> 02:36:48.510
<v Speaker 1>line?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adulthood.</v>

3500
02:36:48.880 --> 02:36:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Adulthood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it 16?</v>

3501
02:36:51.030 --> 02:36:52.260
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 21.</v>

3502
02:36:52.261 --> 02:36:55.290
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably 25.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a fully developed frontal</v>

3503
02:36:55.291 --> 02:36:57.240
<v Speaker 1>cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only problem I have with that is</v>

3504
02:36:57.241 --> 02:37:00.240
<v Speaker 1>like I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate the fact that we have all of</v>

3505
02:37:00.241 --> 02:37:01.740
<v Speaker 1>these different lines in society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3506
02:37:01.741 --> 02:37:03.120
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be this age to drink after</v>

3507
02:37:03.130 --> 02:37:04.650
<v Speaker 1>me this age to do Tibet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get tobacco.</v>

3508
02:37:04.651 --> 02:37:06.870
<v Speaker 1>You have to be this age for porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of those lines are</v>

3509
02:37:06.871 --> 02:37:11.871
<v Speaker 1>incorrect and I think science will show</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the frontal lobe is not fully</v>

3510
02:37:11.971 --> 02:37:13.620
<v Speaker 1>developed until you're 25 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

3511
02:37:13.621 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 1>But should you also not be able to vote</v>
<v Speaker 1>until really?</v>

3512
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:16.861
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3513
02:37:16.861 --> 02:37:18.040
<v Speaker 2>I think I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

3514
02:37:18.110 --> 02:37:20.870
<v Speaker 2>Because I screen haired fuckers that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were in his speech,</v>

3515
02:37:21.210 --> 02:37:24.110
<v Speaker 2>they were all like 19 and goofy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna look back at that video</v>

3516
02:37:24.111 --> 02:37:26.040
<v Speaker 2>someday and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck was wrong with that list?</v>

3517
02:37:26.070 --> 02:37:29.660
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're growing their own vegetables and</v>

3518
02:37:29.661 --> 02:37:31.670
<v Speaker 2>they have to work for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's the thing is that those</v>

3519
02:37:31.671 --> 02:37:33.380
<v Speaker 2>people are assholes too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also not that smart.</v>

3520
02:37:33.770 --> 02:37:35.300
<v Speaker 2>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them of course,</v>

3521
02:37:35.301 --> 02:37:37.460
<v Speaker 2>but then so we were just young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3522
02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:40.400
<v Speaker 2>in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we should just draw a clean line</v>

3523
02:37:40.401 --> 02:37:41.990
<v Speaker 2>at 16 for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

3524
02:37:42.050 --> 02:37:44.690
<v Speaker 2>You can fight for your country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you want to have?</v>

3525
02:37:44.691 --> 02:37:47.570
<v Speaker 2>Kylie Jenner is a fucking president</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't see a lot of them.</v>

3526
02:37:47.571 --> 02:37:50.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't want a baby kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to make it sort of baby them</v>

3527
02:37:50.241 --> 02:37:52.340
<v Speaker 2>either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think like really radical</v>

3528
02:37:52.370 --> 02:37:55.280
<v Speaker 2>choices should be up to them when their</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain's not fully developed,</v>

3529
02:37:55.310 --> 02:37:58.460
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time you're so you're so</v>
<v Speaker 2>young,</v>

3530
02:37:58.461 --> 02:37:59.000
<v Speaker 2>you don't think.</v>

3531
02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:00.890
<v Speaker 2>When did you first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did you first drink?</v>

3532
02:38:02.240 --> 02:38:05.390
<v Speaker 2>It was definitely before I was 21 at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>party.</v>

3533
02:38:05.391 --> 02:38:06.550
<v Speaker 2>I was in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3534
02:38:06.590 --> 02:38:08.060
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere around there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere in your teens?</v>

3535
02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then should you be locked up for</v>

3536
02:38:09.591 --> 02:38:10.401
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3537
02:38:10.401 --> 02:38:12.070
<v Speaker 2>not locked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I shouldn't be.</v>

3538
02:38:12.071 --> 02:38:14.210
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't be able to go into a liquor</v>

3539
02:38:14.211 --> 02:38:16.610
<v Speaker 2>store and buy a pint of Jack Daniels in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe.</v>

3540
02:38:16.790 --> 02:38:19.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they have any age laws in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe for alcohol and stuff.</v>

3541
02:38:19.521 --> 02:38:20.211
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3542
02:38:20.211 --> 02:38:22.640
<v Speaker 2>am I wrong about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is.</v>

3543
02:38:22.710 --> 02:38:23.440
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3544
02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:26.570
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fairly young that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>wine and things along with that.</v>

3545
02:38:26.571 --> 02:38:29.390
<v Speaker 2>I think first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having things that are forbidden</v>

3546
02:38:29.540 --> 02:38:32.150
<v Speaker 2>definitely accentuates the desire to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have them.</v>

3547
02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:33.370
<v Speaker 2>We know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3548
02:38:33.500 --> 02:38:36.050
<v Speaker 2>Telling a kid that cigarettes are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't have cigarettes.</v>

3549
02:38:36.051 --> 02:38:36.950
<v Speaker 2>They want to smoke cigarettes.</v>

3550
02:38:37.070 --> 02:38:38.720
<v Speaker 2>They want to be rebels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to drink,</v>

3551
02:38:38.780 --> 02:38:40.850
<v Speaker 2>they want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to do things that the adults</v>

3552
02:38:40.851 --> 02:38:42.440
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what age for sexual consent.</v>

3553
02:38:42.441 --> 02:38:43.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we obviously can't.</v>

3554
02:38:43.821 --> 02:38:45.250
<v Speaker 2>You're 25 for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3555
02:38:45.540 --> 02:38:47.600
<v Speaker 2>So you have to draw a reasonable line</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you say,</v>

3556
02:38:47.601 --> 02:38:50.450
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough people have developed to the</v>

3557
02:38:50.451 --> 02:38:53.990
<v Speaker 2>point where they're physically mature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a big difference between</v>

3558
02:38:53.991 --> 02:38:55.970
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I don't think is a bad thing.</v>

3559
02:38:56.030 --> 02:38:58.100
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a disastrous thing.</v>

3560
02:38:58.150 --> 02:39:00.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind the different lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 21,</v>

3561
02:39:00.621 --> 02:39:03.620
<v Speaker 2>$60 to have sex with each other when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like it.</v>

3562
02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:07.550
<v Speaker 2>Like I think kids should be able to give</v>
<v Speaker 2>you some of the massage as a 17 year old</v>

3563
02:39:07.551 --> 02:39:10.550
<v Speaker 2>boy and a 17 year old girl of course</v>
<v Speaker 2>that should be able to make out and they</v>

3564
02:39:10.551 --> 02:39:14.510
<v Speaker 2>should be able to fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's our job to responsibly</v>

3565
02:39:14.511 --> 02:39:17.950
<v Speaker 2>educate them about birth control and</v>
<v Speaker 2>about consent and about.</v>

3566
02:39:17.950 --> 02:39:19.010
<v Speaker 2>And it also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3567
02:39:19.250 --> 02:39:23.240
<v Speaker 2>there's different styles of parenting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3568
02:39:23.241 --> 02:39:27.050
<v Speaker 2>some people grow up in horrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>households where the dad's massage and</v>

3569
02:39:27.070 --> 02:39:29.390
<v Speaker 2>there's no mom and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kid's going to have a fucked up</v>

3570
02:39:29.391 --> 02:39:32.750
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What women are same could be said about</v>

3571
02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:36.680
<v Speaker 2>women or girls who grow up with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hateful mother who hates men.</v>

3572
02:39:36.860 --> 02:39:40.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have a lot of weird shit that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to get over as you become an</v>

3573
02:39:40.551 --> 02:39:42.500
<v Speaker 2>adult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you move out of the nest and you</v>

3574
02:39:42.501 --> 02:39:46.100
<v Speaker 2>become your own person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>established your own ideas based on your</v>

3575
02:39:46.101 --> 02:39:49.460
<v Speaker 2>life experiences and education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you've learned from all the other</v>

3576
02:39:49.461 --> 02:39:51.860
<v Speaker 2>people that you've interacted with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3577
02:39:51.890 --> 02:39:55.700
<v Speaker 2>it's not a hard fast rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's a big difference</v>

3578
02:39:55.701 --> 02:39:59.360
<v Speaker 2>between that and voting on what happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>with our future.</v>

3579
02:39:59.361 --> 02:40:01.850
<v Speaker 2>What happens with war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens with.</v>

3580
02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:05.210
<v Speaker 2>There's so many things that a 16 year</v>
<v Speaker 2>old kids is now ready for.</v>

3581
02:40:05.300 --> 02:40:06.930
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like again,</v>

3582
02:40:06.931 --> 02:40:08.660
<v Speaker 2>my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think my counter argument to that is,</v>

3583
02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:13.350
<v Speaker 2>but there are a lot of fucking 68 year</v>
<v Speaker 2>old idiots out there too and we don't</v>

3584
02:40:13.351 --> 02:40:14.310
<v Speaker 2>try to deal with itemize</v>

3585
02:40:14.310 --> 02:40:18.090
<v Speaker 3>their vote because I think we should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anytime you have a system where you</v>

3586
02:40:18.091 --> 02:40:18.541
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

3587
02:40:18.541 --> 02:40:21.870
<v Speaker 3>well you're an idiot so you can't vote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always inevitably just flip back to</v>

3588
02:40:21.900 --> 02:40:24.240
<v Speaker 3>be used against the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the poor in society.</v>

3589
02:40:24.280 --> 02:40:25.650
<v Speaker 3>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

3590
02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:29.100
<v Speaker 3>Well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a great quote from</v>

3591
02:40:29.101 --> 02:40:31.050
<v Speaker 3>Winston Churchill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you said democracy is the worst</v>

3592
02:40:31.051 --> 02:40:32.610
<v Speaker 3>form of government except for all</v>
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>

3593
02:40:33.250 --> 02:40:33.811
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

3594
02:40:33.811 --> 02:40:34.201
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3595
02:40:34.201 --> 02:40:35.034
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's.</v>

3596
02:40:35.100 --> 02:40:36.570
<v Speaker 3>So that's kind of what we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about here.</v>

3597
02:40:36.571 --> 02:40:38.250
<v Speaker 3>And in terms of drawing the line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3598
02:40:38.270 --> 02:40:41.460
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like there's something right</v>
<v Speaker 3>about drawing one line and saying</v>

3599
02:40:41.461 --> 02:40:44.160
<v Speaker 3>everything over this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I do hear you like it is true that</v>

3600
02:40:44.161 --> 02:40:45.870
<v Speaker 3>sex is a very different thing from</v>
<v Speaker 3>voting.</v>

3601
02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:48.450
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we should regulate sex</v>

3602
02:40:48.480 --> 02:40:50.790
<v Speaker 3>except for adults having sex with</v>
<v Speaker 3>minors.</v>

3603
02:40:50.940 --> 02:40:52.920
<v Speaker 3>I agree a hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was 17,</v>

3604
02:40:52.921 --> 02:40:56.820
<v Speaker 3>my girlfriend was 16 and I remember I</v>
<v Speaker 3>turned 18 and she turned 17.</v>

3605
02:40:56.820 --> 02:40:58.440
<v Speaker 3>And there was a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were a criminal?</v>

3606
02:40:58.670 --> 02:41:00.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone told me that if we kept having</v>

3607
02:41:00.811 --> 02:41:01.810
<v Speaker 3>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I would go to jail.</v>

3608
02:41:01.811 --> 02:41:02.700
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

3609
02:41:02.701 --> 02:41:04.860
<v Speaker 3>Are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is madness.</v>

3610
02:41:04.861 --> 02:41:07.140
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we've been banging it out for 11</v>

3611
02:41:07.141 --> 02:41:09.030
<v Speaker 3>months now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we could stop now.</v>

3612
02:41:09.570 --> 02:41:10.470
<v Speaker 3>It makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3613
02:41:10.471 --> 02:41:11.730
<v Speaker 3>I was really nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3614
02:41:11.731 --> 02:41:14.400
<v Speaker 3>what if I go to jail?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that works that way.</v>

3615
02:41:14.430 --> 02:41:15.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they put you in jail for</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3616
02:41:15.780 --> 02:41:19.380
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember how bad I felt when I was in</v>

3617
02:41:19.381 --> 02:41:22.710
<v Speaker 3>high school and I was smoking weed and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>felt like if I get caught doing this</v>

3618
02:41:22.711 --> 02:41:25.230
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you think about it and it's</v>

3619
02:41:25.231 --> 02:41:27.750
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold the fuck on Bill Clinton.</v>

3620
02:41:27.930 --> 02:41:28.631
<v Speaker 3>US.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3621
02:41:28.631 --> 02:41:31.620
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Barack Obama was part of the fucking</v>

3622
02:41:31.630 --> 02:41:33.870
<v Speaker 3>tomb gang or some shit where he would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3623
02:41:34.170 --> 02:41:37.080
<v Speaker 3>He was part of this thing called the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tomb gang where he would uh,</v>

3624
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:37.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look up Jimmy.</v>

3625
02:41:37.890 --> 02:41:38.723
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3626
02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:40.620
<v Speaker 3>he would smoke weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's picture of him smoking weed on</v>

3627
02:41:40.621 --> 02:41:42.270
<v Speaker 3>the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's when he chances cigarette.</v>

3628
02:41:42.330 --> 02:41:43.530
<v Speaker 3>You sure?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure.</v>

3629
02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:45.060
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he did smoke weed alive.</v>

3630
02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:46.260
<v Speaker 3>He admits it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

3631
02:41:46.261 --> 02:41:48.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that there were charges of Bush</v>

3632
02:41:48.181 --> 02:41:51.420
<v Speaker 3>used cocaine and then Obama said he did</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of cocaine and shit like</v>

3633
02:41:51.421 --> 02:41:53.730
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what drives me fucking crazy is that</v>

3634
02:41:53.731 --> 02:41:55.770
<v Speaker 3>you have these guys who did all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

3635
02:41:55.860 --> 02:41:58.980
<v Speaker 3>They know damn well that what they did</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time was just experimentation.</v>

3636
02:41:59.070 --> 02:42:01.890
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing morally wrong about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now we have a system where we lock</v>

3637
02:42:01.891 --> 02:42:05.100
<v Speaker 3>up fucking thousands of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of people over the same shit.</v>

3638
02:42:05.220 --> 02:42:07.320
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they became president when they did</v>

3639
02:42:07.321 --> 02:42:09.100
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're running on that eight,</v>

3640
02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:11.700
<v Speaker 3>the eight years that he was in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>office.</v>

3641
02:42:11.910 --> 02:42:13.680
<v Speaker 3>How many people were locked up for</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana?</v>

3642
02:42:13.681 --> 02:42:14.970
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3643
02:42:15.030 --> 02:42:15.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not just,</v>

3644
02:42:15.930 --> 02:42:18.540
<v Speaker 3>not just for selling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for recreational use in certain</v>

3645
02:42:18.541 --> 02:42:20.370
<v Speaker 3>states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were people who got,</v>

3646
02:42:20.670 --> 02:42:24.270
<v Speaker 3>who have life sentences as a result of</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonviolent drug offenses.</v>

3647
02:42:24.600 --> 02:42:27.330
<v Speaker 3>Now to Obama's credit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards the end of his time in office,</v>

3648
02:42:27.331 --> 02:42:30.510
<v Speaker 3>he started doing a pardons and</v>
<v Speaker 3>commutations of those sentences.</v>

3649
02:42:30.750 --> 02:42:32.280
<v Speaker 3>But the thing that drives me crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

3650
02:42:32.281 --> 02:42:33.690
<v Speaker 3>to get back to one of my main points</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

3651
02:42:33.691 --> 02:42:37.440
<v Speaker 3>is I hate the fucking incrementalism and</v>
<v Speaker 3>gradual ism moving towards the thing</v>

3652
02:42:37.441 --> 02:42:39.750
<v Speaker 3>that we all know is the right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know the right answer is to</v>

3653
02:42:39.751 --> 02:42:42.690
<v Speaker 3>legalize it and fucking let every single</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonviolent drug offenders out of prison</v>

3654
02:42:42.691 --> 02:42:44.460
<v Speaker 3>and fucking apologized to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

3655
02:42:44.461 --> 02:42:47.880
<v Speaker 3>the hypocritical nature of having all</v>
<v Speaker 3>this coincide with the pharmaceutical</v>

3656
02:42:47.881 --> 02:42:51.840
<v Speaker 3>industry selling opioids that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing people at a radical rate while</v>

3657
02:42:51.841 --> 02:42:54.210
<v Speaker 3>they take contributions from us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy.</v>

3658
02:42:54.211 --> 02:42:56.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are literally a part of a drug</v>

3659
02:42:56.101 --> 02:42:58.450
<v Speaker 3>dealing enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember my,</v>

3660
02:42:58.570 --> 02:43:02.910
<v Speaker 3>my grandma on my dad's side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember she passed away a while ago,</v>

3661
02:43:02.911 --> 02:43:06.600
<v Speaker 3>but I would go to her place and look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>her fucking medicine thing.</v>

3662
02:43:07.380 --> 02:43:11.650
<v Speaker 3>There were 70 different kinds of pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3663
02:43:11.651 --> 02:43:12.370
<v Speaker 3>holy</v>

3664
02:43:12.370 --> 02:43:15.100
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's getting zonked out of her mind on</v>

3665
02:43:15.101 --> 02:43:17.320
<v Speaker 2>a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the whole point of it.</v>

3666
02:43:17.560 --> 02:43:19.360
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not even begrudging an older</v>
<v Speaker 2>person who's like,</v>

3667
02:43:19.361 --> 02:43:20.710
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm checking out unless you give me all</v>

3668
02:43:20.711 --> 02:43:22.270
<v Speaker 2>the pills you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my point is,</v>

3669
02:43:22.271 --> 02:43:25.000
<v Speaker 2>if you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's going to be the mentality for</v>

3670
02:43:25.001 --> 02:43:25.640
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

3671
02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:29.170
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck would you lock up poor</v>
<v Speaker 2>people for smoking weed or doing cocaine</v>

3672
02:43:29.171 --> 02:43:31.390
<v Speaker 2>or whatever the case is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody could rationally</v>

3673
02:43:31.391 --> 02:43:32.470
<v Speaker 2>argue that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3674
02:43:32.471 --> 02:43:34.960
<v Speaker 2>it's just seems at this stage of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>game,</v>

3675
02:43:34.990 --> 02:43:38.110
<v Speaker 2>especially when it comes to things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are nontoxic or,</v>

3676
02:43:38.111 --> 02:43:39.730
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a nonfatal.</v>

3677
02:43:39.970 --> 02:43:42.940
<v Speaker 2>Things like marijuana or Kratom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no argument against.</v>

3678
02:43:42.941 --> 02:43:45.670
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you could go right down</v>

3679
02:43:45.671 --> 02:43:48.340
<v Speaker 2>the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could go to the CVS and buy enough</v>

3680
02:43:48.341 --> 02:43:49.690
<v Speaker 2>liquor to kill yourself instantly.</v>

3681
02:43:50.170 --> 02:43:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Easily,</v>

3682
02:43:51.580 --> 02:43:53.380
<v Speaker 2>easily right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

3683
02:43:53.740 --> 02:43:55.660
<v Speaker 2>that table right over there will kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3684
02:43:55.840 --> 02:43:57.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you drink all that for sure.</v>

3685
02:43:57.470 --> 02:43:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a table there with a big bottle</v>

3686
02:43:59.501 --> 02:44:02.020
<v Speaker 2>of gentleman's Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple of bottles of whiskey</v>

3687
02:44:02.021 --> 02:44:05.380
<v Speaker 2>to some whiskey from some place in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bakersfield and a big jug of wine dead</v>

3688
02:44:05.590 --> 02:44:06.520
<v Speaker 2>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that shit.</v>

3689
02:44:06.580 --> 02:44:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

3690
02:44:07.810 --> 02:44:08.590
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3691
02:44:08.590 --> 02:44:11.020
<v Speaker 2>sorry to change topic so abruptly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm from New York.</v>

3692
02:44:11.260 --> 02:44:13.030
<v Speaker 2>The bagels here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking terrible.</v>

3693
02:44:13.720 --> 02:44:15.370
<v Speaker 2>Is that the water?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3694
02:44:15.450 --> 02:44:16.211
<v Speaker 2>Must Be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3695
02:44:16.211 --> 02:44:18.490
<v Speaker 2>this isn't a Bagel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like a fucking piece of stale</v>

3696
02:44:18.491 --> 02:44:19.450
<v Speaker 2>bread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3697
02:44:19.540 --> 02:44:21.760
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the moisture in the air</v>

3698
02:44:21.761 --> 02:44:23.470
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if the bagels are better in</v>

3699
02:44:23.471 --> 02:44:25.390
<v Speaker 2>Seattle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it moisture up there?</v>

3700
02:44:25.420 --> 02:44:27.670
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's wet and then I'm going to try the</v>

3701
02:44:27.671 --> 02:44:29.020
<v Speaker 2>pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try the pizza.</v>

3702
02:44:29.020 --> 02:44:31.210
<v Speaker 2>I think today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here don't do it.</v>

3703
02:44:31.330 --> 02:44:34.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do it just because I got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to compare,</v>

3704
02:44:34.001 --> 02:44:36.070
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to compare my whole life.</v>

3705
02:44:36.071 --> 02:44:37.720
<v Speaker 2>I heard like a New York piece is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>

3706
02:44:37.721 --> 02:44:39.410
<v Speaker 2>Where do you live now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you live in the city and uh,</v>

3707
02:44:39.460 --> 02:44:40.660
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live just outside of the city.</v>

3708
02:44:40.661 --> 02:44:42.270
<v Speaker 2>I live in Westchester County still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not nourished.</v>

3709
02:44:42.271 --> 02:44:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Yell anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's better pizza for sure.</v>

3710
02:44:44.830 --> 02:44:47.500
<v Speaker 2>Did used to go to Nicki's pizza?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went down the street from white</v>

<v Speaker 2>plains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Been there once,</v>

3712
02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.110
<v Speaker 2>but there's one next to that called</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

3713
02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever been there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

3714
02:44:53.050 --> 02:44:54.700
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Executive billiards.</v>

3715
02:44:54.940 --> 02:44:57.880
<v Speaker 2>If you walked out of executive and take</v>
<v Speaker 2>a right in white plains.</v>

3716
02:44:57.970 --> 02:45:00.670
<v Speaker 2>Nikki's was on the right hand side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I heard Nikki's burnt down.</v>

3717
02:45:01.090 --> 02:45:02.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nicky's had.</v>

3718
02:45:02.350 --> 02:45:05.770
<v Speaker 2>I only never had white pizza before</v>
<v Speaker 2>until I went to Nikki's and I had white</v>

3719
02:45:05.771 --> 02:45:06.040
<v Speaker 2>pizza.</v>

3720
02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:06.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

3721
02:45:06.971 --> 02:45:09.160
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the greatest things</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans have ever created.</v>

3722
02:45:09.550 --> 02:45:11.530
<v Speaker 2>When you were there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were there.</v>

3723
02:45:11.680 --> 02:45:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Was there the Strip of bars developed</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet on white plain in in white plains</v>

3724

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3725
02:45:15.490 --> 02:45:17.920
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was some bars there for sure,</v>

3726
02:45:17.921 --> 02:45:21.460
<v Speaker 2>but there were old dive bars and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All we would do is go play pool.</v>

3727
02:45:21.570 --> 02:45:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Still there?</v>

3729
02:45:25.121 --> 02:45:26.790
<v Speaker 2>I think it's still a science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

3730
02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:29.650
<v Speaker 2>Stickers on the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that shit on the door?</v>

3731
02:45:29.710 --> 02:45:32.440
<v Speaker 2>The right to the right of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like there's like closed down.</v>

3732
02:45:32.510 --> 02:45:35.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tim was there like two years ago,</v>

3733
02:45:35.621 --> 02:45:38.470
<v Speaker 2>so I mean it could have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have closed since then.</v>

3734
02:45:38.590 --> 02:45:41.530
<v Speaker 2>I think Mario's pizza in white plains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

3735
02:45:41.560 --> 02:45:43.660
<v Speaker 2>You have to trial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is open so it is open now.</v>

3736
02:45:43.900 --> 02:45:47.830
<v Speaker 2>So they must have did it burn down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they rebuilt it because that was yellow</v>

3737
02:45:47.831 --> 02:45:49.690
<v Speaker 2>tape over the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like police tape.</v>

3738
02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:52.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They cleaned it up fucking damn.</v>

3739
02:45:52.991 --> 02:45:55.600
<v Speaker 2>If they have the same recipe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a run,</v>

3740
02:45:55.601 --> 02:45:57.910
<v Speaker 2>do not walk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>run to Nikki's and get some of that</v>

3741
02:45:57.911 --> 02:46:02.110
<v Speaker 2>white pizza or any of their pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So speaking of your crazy stories about</v>

3742
02:46:02.111 --> 02:46:04.810
<v Speaker 2>at executive billiards and all the crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>characters you've met there.</v>

3743
02:46:05.020 --> 02:46:06.790
<v Speaker 2>My friend Karen and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

3744
02:46:06.870 --> 02:46:09.770
<v Speaker 2>when we were in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would go play poker at these</v>

3745
02:46:10.310 --> 02:46:12.800
<v Speaker 1>basically underground spots in new</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rochelle.</v>

3746
02:46:13.220 --> 02:46:16.220
<v Speaker 1>And they were either founders like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie with Matt Damon,</v>

3747
02:46:16.310 --> 02:46:17.360
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't rushing.</v>

3748
02:46:17.361 --> 02:46:22.130
<v Speaker 1>They were either like weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird fake mafioso dudes or real mafioso</v>

3749
02:46:22.131 --> 02:46:24.290
<v Speaker 1>do is we couldn't tell the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know because they don't talk</v>

3750
02:46:24.291 --> 02:46:26.870
<v Speaker 1>like this and they're like hey Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me a fucking diet coke.</v>

3751
02:46:26.871 --> 02:46:29.540
<v Speaker 1>And all they would do is sit there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke cigarettes the whole time.</v>

3752
02:46:29.870 --> 02:46:33.980
<v Speaker 1>And so we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we played cards there and you know,</v>

3753
02:46:33.981 --> 02:46:36.680
<v Speaker 1>we had some friends who did well and me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my friend probably lost money</v>

3754
02:46:36.681 --> 02:46:40.430
<v Speaker 1>overall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was years later I was watching</v>

3755
02:46:40.560 --> 02:46:42.890
<v Speaker 1>a I turn on the TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just happened to be a local news report.</v>

3756
02:46:43.730 --> 02:46:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Learned that one of the guys who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

3757
02:46:46.580 --> 02:46:51.580
<v Speaker 1>God is fucking hand chopped off right in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of the place.</v>

3758
02:46:52.790 --> 02:46:54.200
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3759
02:46:54.201 --> 02:46:57.330
<v Speaker 1>we were in over our heads now were we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were in high school,</v>

3760
02:46:58.180 --> 02:47:00.020
<v Speaker 1>one of the chop his head off for</v>
<v Speaker 1>stealing.</v>

3761
02:47:00.050 --> 02:47:03.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they were real mafia mafia</v>

3762
02:47:03.051 --> 02:47:04.670
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was some shortcuts,</v>

3763
02:47:04.750 --> 02:47:05.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's dark,</v>

3764
02:47:05.930 --> 02:47:09.500
<v Speaker 1>chopping a person's hand off his fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave it to him here.</v>

3765
02:47:09.680 --> 02:47:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Go get this sewed back on bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's funny is,</v>

3766
02:47:12.561 --> 02:47:13.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will fucking,</v>

3767
02:47:13.760 --> 02:47:15.950
<v Speaker 1>even though their mafia guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were fucking like,</v>

3768
02:47:15.951 --> 02:47:19.940
<v Speaker 1>they were really nice to us with high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school kids and a lot of Mafia people</v>

3769
02:47:19.941 --> 02:47:22.180
<v Speaker 1>who are gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is like,</v>

3770
02:47:22.250 --> 02:47:26.300
<v Speaker 1>just can't be in the wrong situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't owe them money.</v>

3771
02:47:26.570 --> 02:47:29.620
<v Speaker 1>You can't be in a situation where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can get money out of you or they can</v>

3772
02:47:29.630 --> 02:47:31.340
<v Speaker 1>extort money from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3773
02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:35.060
<v Speaker 1>if you were running a business or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything where they offered you</v>

3774
02:47:35.061 --> 02:47:37.820
<v Speaker 1>protection or any of that kind of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're fucked man.</v>

3775
02:47:37.850 --> 02:47:41.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's why gambling should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking illegal because it's illegal.</v>

3776
02:47:41.990 --> 02:47:42.823
<v Speaker 1>Push it underground.</v>

3777
02:47:42.830 --> 02:47:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Now those guys run it and then people</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget their fucking hands chopped off,</v>

3778
02:47:45.500 --> 02:47:46.333
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3779
02:47:46.460 --> 02:47:47.241
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3780
02:47:47.241 --> 02:47:49.280
<v Speaker 1>In Vegas they just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing to kick your ass?</v>

3781
02:47:49.281 --> 02:47:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Put you in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the Vegas,</v>

3782
02:47:51.321 --> 02:47:52.850
<v Speaker 1>he used to run them off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the [inaudible] brothers.</v>

3783
02:47:53.170 --> 02:47:54.980
<v Speaker 1>I used to run funding everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3784
02:47:55.500 --> 02:47:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Even a half a fucking Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it was financed with mobster</v>

3785
02:47:59.001 --> 02:47:59.721
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3786
02:47:59.721 --> 02:48:01.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about that many times at</v>

3787
02:48:01.311 --> 02:48:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Ciro's nightclub was owned by Bugsy</v>
<v Speaker 1>Siegel.</v>

3788
02:48:03.860 --> 02:48:05.750
<v Speaker 1>That's the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

3789
02:48:05.751 --> 02:48:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to be a total mob run joint</v>

3790
02:48:08.661 --> 02:48:12.830
<v Speaker 1>and to this day I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in ghosts,</v>

3791
02:48:13.100 --> 02:48:15.440
<v Speaker 1>but I'd go to the belly room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gone to the belly room several</v>

3792
02:48:15.441 --> 02:48:18.440
<v Speaker 1>times with my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like over the 20 years that I've been</v>

3793
02:48:18.441 --> 02:48:20.510
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We go by when it's dark,</v>

3794
02:48:20.570 --> 02:48:21.870
<v Speaker 1>just stand there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think you feel?</v>

3795
02:48:21.880 --> 02:48:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking scared.</v>

3796
02:48:23.180 --> 02:48:24.013
<v Speaker 1>Heartbeat.</v>

3797
02:48:25.580 --> 02:48:29.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in ghosts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think energy is real and I don't</v>

3798
02:48:29.301 --> 02:48:31.730
<v Speaker 1>know whether we create in our own mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we look at something and we're</v>

3799
02:48:31.731 --> 02:48:34.100
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel weird looking at cars.</v>

3800
02:48:34.130 --> 02:48:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Enter rooms give you a feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You walk into a room,</v>

3801
02:48:36.531 --> 02:48:38.510
<v Speaker 1>you get a feel off the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3802
02:48:38.511 --> 02:48:42.350
<v Speaker 1>people had been murdered there for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thought process about</v>

3803
02:48:42.410 --> 02:48:47.410
<v Speaker 1>that place is that there's probably some</v>
<v Speaker 1>leftover weird vibes and I know a lot of</v>

3804
02:48:47.541 --> 02:48:50.570
<v Speaker 1>people that have seen weird shit there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if I believe them.</v>

3805
02:48:50.720 --> 02:48:52.970
<v Speaker 1>They say they've seen weird shifts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Tony Hinchcliffe.</v>

3806
02:48:52.971 --> 02:48:55.430
<v Speaker 1>I saw the podcast where he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a ghost.</v>

3807
02:48:56.150 --> 02:48:57.860
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just so you know Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you,</v>

3808
02:48:57.861 --> 02:48:59.240
<v Speaker 1>but I was at home going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck off.</v>

3809
02:48:59.420 --> 02:49:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Fuck off Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a ghost there,</v>

3810
02:49:02.661 --> 02:49:04.340
<v Speaker 1>but I felt weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

3811
02:49:04.341 --> 02:49:07.650
<v Speaker 1>I've gone into the main room when it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark at night and I'll be gone by myself</v>

3812
02:49:07.651 --> 02:49:08.010
<v Speaker 1>and I shit</v>

3813
02:49:08.010 --> 02:49:09.930
<v Speaker 2>my pants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get Outta here,</v>

3814
02:49:10.290 --> 02:49:12.510
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely believe people were</v>

3815
02:49:12.511 --> 02:49:16.200
<v Speaker 2>murdered there and they used to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tunnel that would go from the back of</v>

3816
02:49:16.201 --> 02:49:18.060
<v Speaker 2>the comedy store all the way up to crest</v>
<v Speaker 2>hill,</v>

3817
02:49:18.061 --> 02:49:21.310
<v Speaker 2>which is a street above the comedy store</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the comedy store.</v>

3818
02:49:21.311 --> 02:49:22.950
<v Speaker 2>He used to own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they bought the two of them</v>

3819
02:49:22.951 --> 02:49:26.340
<v Speaker 2>together and you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a tunnel where they take</v>

3820
02:49:26.341 --> 02:49:30.420
<v Speaker 2>booze and dead people and Shit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking screwed him up there and throw</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3822
02:49:32.700 --> 02:49:36.590
<v Speaker 2>It's a fun thing to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at like all those tv shows</v>

3823
02:49:36.640 --> 02:49:39.270
<v Speaker 2>like haunted Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The comedy store is very high on the</v>

3824
02:49:39.271 --> 02:49:40.030

3841
02:50:20.230 --> 02:50:22.240
<v Speaker 3>happened when I was doing that Saifai</v>
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the Joe Rogan questions.</v>

02:50:23.951 --> 02:50:26.970
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to make sure that I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>out to debunk a lot of the shows that</v>

3844
02:50:26.980 --> 02:50:27.340
<v Speaker 3>they would have</v>

3845
02:50:27.340 --> 02:50:30.820
<v Speaker 2>on their network and I can look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to find out what's going on.</v>

3846
02:50:30.890 --> 02:50:32.650
<v Speaker 2>I want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of it's probably real.</v>

3847
02:50:32.651 --> 02:50:34.380
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3848
02:50:35.140 --> 02:50:39.230
<v Speaker 2>That was an eyeopening experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doing that show was very eyeopening</v>

3849
02:50:39.250 --> 02:50:41.560
<v Speaker 2>because I realized what kind of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>were really into these things.</v>

3850
02:50:41.561 --> 02:50:45.070
<v Speaker 2>They're just whimsical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopeful people that don't have much</v>

3851
02:50:45.071 --> 02:50:48.790
<v Speaker 2>going on and they want it to be real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a 10 foot tall,</v>

3852
02:50:48.791 --> 02:50:51.860
<v Speaker 2>furry man living in the forest or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens come down,</v>

3853
02:50:51.880 --> 02:50:55.000
<v Speaker 2>suck people out of their beds and bring</v>
<v Speaker 2>them through walls in the middle of the</v>

3854
02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:55.730
<v Speaker 2>night and all that shit.</v>

3855
02:50:55.730 --> 02:50:58.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really took it to the chem trail</v>

3856
02:50:58.341 --> 02:50:59.360
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3857
02:50:59.361 --> 02:51:00.400
<v Speaker 3>Those poor fox.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3858
02:51:00.430 --> 02:51:02.870
<v Speaker 3>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They despise you now get mad.</v>

3859
02:51:02.930 --> 02:51:06.110
<v Speaker 3>You're fucking chill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Geoengineering is real brow.</v>

3860
02:51:06.111 --> 02:51:08.390
<v Speaker 3>What does Alex Jones say to you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I know you're friends with him.</v>

3861
02:51:08.391 --> 02:51:09.850
<v Speaker 3>What does he say to you about chem</v>
<v Speaker 3>trails?</v>

3862
02:51:09.851 --> 02:51:10.660
<v Speaker 3>So you try to convince you?</v>

3863
02:51:10.660 --> 02:51:13.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thinks that most of what you see</v>

3864
02:51:13.700 --> 02:51:15.230
<v Speaker 2>according to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to see Alex,</v>

3865
02:51:15.380 --> 02:51:17.180
<v Speaker 2>he goes with the weather a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

3866
02:51:17.870 --> 02:51:22.520
<v Speaker 2>He thinks most of what you see is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>condensation trails that happen when you</v>

3867
02:51:22.521 --> 02:51:27.521
<v Speaker 2>have a jet engine and you have the cold</v>
<v Speaker 2>air and condensation in the atmosphere</v>

3868
02:51:27.591 --> 02:51:29.270
<v Speaker 2>and the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they are.</v>

3869
02:51:29.271 --> 02:51:31.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're artificial clouds that are</v>

3870
02:51:31.761 --> 02:51:34.250
<v Speaker 2>created by a jet engine passing through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the air.</v>

3871
02:51:34.280 --> 02:51:36.800
<v Speaker 2>That's what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do it over and over again.</v>

3872
02:51:36.801 --> 02:51:39.410
<v Speaker 2>You could do it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that they're spraying something</v>

3873
02:51:39.710 --> 02:51:42.800
<v Speaker 2>and that something happens to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>aluminum and Barium in it,</v>

3874
02:51:42.801 --> 02:51:44.900
<v Speaker 2>but it also looks exactly the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3875
02:51:45.050 --> 02:51:47.540
<v Speaker 2>that's moisture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why it looks like a cloud is</v>

3876
02:51:47.541 --> 02:51:50.240
<v Speaker 2>because it's a fucking cloud and one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that I said in the chem trail</v>

3877
02:51:50.241 --> 02:51:51.920
<v Speaker 2>thing like go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to talk about real chem trails?</v>

3878
02:51:52.100 --> 02:51:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Here's the real chem trail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're burning gasoline in the sky</v>

3879
02:51:55.731 --> 02:52:00.350
<v Speaker 2>above your head every day to turn to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tune of thousands of flights.</v>

3880
02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:02.450
<v Speaker 2>You're not concentrating on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>

3881
02:52:02.451 --> 02:52:05.980
<v Speaker 2>you're concentrating on the natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction of jet engines and moisture in</v>

3882
02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:07.330
<v Speaker 3>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so stupid.</v>

3883
02:52:07.390 --> 02:52:12.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't get because there's a thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people do where it's almost like they're</v>

3884
02:52:12.131 --> 02:52:16.210
<v Speaker 3>trying to find the worst possible</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking argument and then that's the</v>

3885
02:52:16.211 --> 02:52:17.510
<v Speaker 3>part of it that they get upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that.</v>

3886
02:52:17.770 --> 02:52:21.610
<v Speaker 3>And this goes back to the thing about</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump where I told you on CNN all they</v>

3887
02:52:21.611 --> 02:52:25.000
<v Speaker 3>did for an hour and a fucking half was</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about Russia and it's like I'm</v>

3888
02:52:25.001 --> 02:52:28.180
<v Speaker 3>sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just covered a story on my show last</v>

3889
02:52:28.180 --> 02:52:31.420
<v Speaker 3>week about how the head of the consumer</v>
<v Speaker 3>financial protection bureau is a guy</v>

3890
02:52:31.421 --> 02:52:34.840
<v Speaker 3>named Mick Mulvaney.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He took over $50,000 from the predatory</v>

3891
02:52:34.841 --> 02:52:37.690
<v Speaker 3>payday loan industry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald trump at his inauguration took</v>

3892
02:52:37.691 --> 02:52:40.120
<v Speaker 3>over a million dollars from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>predatory payday loan industry.</v>

3893
02:52:40.450 --> 02:52:44.710
<v Speaker 3>They just scrapped the rules that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to clean up that industry.</v>

3894
02:52:44.890 --> 02:52:48.370
<v Speaker 3>And now they're letting them charge 950</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent interest.</v>

3895
02:52:48.790 --> 02:52:50.260
<v Speaker 3>You want the fucking conspiracy?</v>

3896
02:52:50.380 --> 02:52:53.930
<v Speaker 3>There it is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're not talking about Putin in</v>

3897
02:52:54.070 --> 02:52:56.190
<v Speaker 3>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking Manchurian candidate and</v>

3898
02:52:56.200 --> 02:52:58.990
<v Speaker 3>loud noises and he curses a lot and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking stormy daniels.</v>

3899
02:52:58.991 --> 02:53:01.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck about any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk about the shit that matters.</v>

3900
02:53:01.390 --> 02:53:03.200
<v Speaker 3>I care about storming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3901
02:53:04.590 --> 02:53:09.160
<v Speaker 3>I do wonder what's going to happen with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the indictments.</v>

3902
02:53:09.310 --> 02:53:10.570
<v Speaker 3>I do wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was.</v>

3903
02:53:10.571 --> 02:53:13.090
<v Speaker 3>People were pleading guilty now and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3904
02:53:13.170 --> 02:53:14.950
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The concern is that it's going to</v>

3905
02:53:14.951 --> 02:53:16.900
<v Speaker 3>trickle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's the thing.</v>

3906
02:53:17.380 --> 02:53:20.230
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is Donald Trump a corrupt businessman?</v>

3907
02:53:20.800 --> 02:53:23.410
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody who says he's not has no fucking</v>

3908
02:53:23.411 --> 02:53:25.270
<v Speaker 3>idea what this has been into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's evidence.</v>

3909
02:53:25.271 --> 02:53:29.680
<v Speaker 3>He did deals with the Mafia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a hotel in Panama which was</v>

3910
02:53:29.681 --> 02:53:32.410
<v Speaker 3>laundering drug money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do I think he's a criminal?</v>

3911
02:53:32.440 --> 02:53:34.300
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do I think he did money laundry?</v>

3912
02:53:34.510 --> 02:53:37.900
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would it be good if somehow got him on</v>

3913
02:53:37.901 --> 02:53:38.300
<v Speaker 3>these things?</v>

3914
02:53:38.300 --> 02:53:41.500
<v Speaker 3>So of course it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that he's a Manchurian</v>

3915
02:53:41.501 --> 02:53:45.430
<v Speaker 3>candidate or he did treason is so</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous that it makes me a guy who's</v>

3916
02:53:45.460 --> 02:53:49.720
<v Speaker 3>massively anti-trump scarf and get</v>
<v Speaker 3>really angry when people try to push</v>

3917
02:53:49.721 --> 02:53:53.020
<v Speaker 3>that narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and here's the thing there is it's an</v>

3918
02:53:53.050 --> 02:53:56.800
<v Speaker 3>open legal question as to whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can indict a sitting president.</v>

3919
02:53:57.220 --> 02:54:01.390
<v Speaker 3>Usually what has to happen is you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to impeach a sitting president will.</v>

3920
02:54:01.391 --> 02:54:03.580
<v Speaker 3>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Congress is overwhelmingly Republican.</v>

3921
02:54:03.930 --> 02:54:05.950
<v Speaker 3>You know who's not going to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>impeach Donald Trump.</v>

3922
02:54:06.010 --> 02:54:08.920
<v Speaker 3>Even if they prove the worst case</v>
<v Speaker 3>scenario that he's some sort of</v>

3923
02:54:08.921 --> 02:54:11.650
<v Speaker 3>Manchurian candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Republicans are not going to fucking</v>

3924
02:54:11.651 --> 02:54:14.020
<v Speaker 3>impeach him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at the end of the day when the</v>

3925
02:54:14.021 --> 02:54:19.021
<v Speaker 3>Democrats focus on this ad Nauseum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason they're doing that is because</v>

3926
02:54:19.930 --> 02:54:23.370
<v Speaker 3>it's something that they feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>comfortable and safe talking about</v>

3927
02:54:23.380 --> 02:54:26.750
<v Speaker 3>because they don't have to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 3>Medicare for all or free college or a</v>

3928
02:54:26.760 --> 02:54:29.740
<v Speaker 3>living wage or getting the corporate</v>
<v Speaker 3>money out of politics or ending the</v>

3929
02:54:29.741 --> 02:54:31.570
<v Speaker 3>fucking wars which they also support.</v>

3930
02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:34.330
<v Speaker 3>So they're not talking about real issues</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're focusing on this,</v>

3931
02:54:34.420 --> 02:54:38.140
<v Speaker 3>the fake scandal and sensationalism</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they think will score them cheap</v>

3932
02:54:38.141 --> 02:54:41.680
<v Speaker 3>points with the electorate and it won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they think there's an end game here</v>

3933
02:54:41.681 --> 02:54:43.900
<v Speaker 3>and there's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there is something there,</v>

3934
02:54:43.901 --> 02:54:45.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if yes,</v>

3935
02:54:45.310 --> 02:54:48.100
<v Speaker 3>he made money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if people are getting indicted,</v>

3936
02:54:48.290 --> 02:54:50.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure with this Russia thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll break that down.</v>

3937
02:54:51.010 --> 02:54:52.930
<v Speaker 3>Paul Manafort is one of the people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>got indicted,</v>

3938
02:54:53.230 --> 02:54:56.470
<v Speaker 3>super duper corrupt laundering money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Flynn,</v>

3939
02:54:56.970 --> 02:54:58.390
<v Speaker 3>saving money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How so?</v>

3940
02:54:58.540 --> 02:55:01.420
<v Speaker 3>So in the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know more of the details about flint.</v>

3941
02:55:01.480 --> 02:55:03.120
<v Speaker 3>So Flynn is a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got a,</v>

3942
02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:04.700
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's his face?</v>

3943
02:55:04.701 --> 02:55:09.380
<v Speaker 3>Molar went after Flynn and it was proven</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Flynn took $500,000 from the</v>

3944
02:55:09.381 --> 02:55:12.530
<v Speaker 3>Turkish government and in return for</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3945
02:55:12.560 --> 02:55:17.560
<v Speaker 3>he pushed the trump administration to</v>
<v Speaker 3>not arm the Kurds who are fighting isis.</v>

3946
02:55:19.520 --> 02:55:23.270
<v Speaker 3>And the reason why is because Turkey</v>
<v Speaker 3>hates the Kurds and they don't want us</v>

3947
02:55:23.271 --> 02:55:25.040
<v Speaker 3>to arm the Kurds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in other words,</v>

3948
02:55:25.041 --> 02:55:29.150
<v Speaker 3>Michael Flynn was doing the bidding of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Turkish government and pushing their</v>

3949
02:55:29.151 --> 02:55:32.150
<v Speaker 3>influence in our government and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't register as a foreign agent in</v>

3950
02:55:32.151 --> 02:55:34.370
<v Speaker 3>the process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So exactly.</v>

3951
02:55:34.371 --> 02:55:37.930
<v Speaker 3>So he's doing the bidding of the Turkish</v>
<v Speaker 3>government and not disclosing that.</v>

3952
02:55:38.010 --> 02:55:40.730
<v Speaker 3>And you have to register as a foreign</v>
<v Speaker 3>agent if you're going to take that money</v>

3953
02:55:40.731 --> 02:55:43.460
<v Speaker 3>and you're going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this doesn't run down to trump.</v>

3954
02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:45.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's the open question as to</v>

3955
02:55:45.891 --> 02:55:48.110
<v Speaker 3>whether or not at some point along the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

3956
02:55:48.111 --> 02:55:50.330
<v Speaker 3>whether it's with Russia or with other</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>

3957
02:55:50.331 --> 02:55:52.070
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody talks about the fact that trump</v>

3958
02:55:52.071 --> 02:55:54.980
<v Speaker 3>registered eight new businesses in Saudi</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arabia when he was on the campaign</v>

3959
02:55:54.981 --> 02:55:56.540
<v Speaker 3>trail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he just gave them over</v>

3960
02:55:56.541 --> 02:55:57.920
<v Speaker 3>$100,000,000,000 weapons deal.</v>

3961
02:55:58.220 --> 02:56:02.420
<v Speaker 3>He also took $270,000 from top Saudi</v>
<v Speaker 3>officials at his hotel when he was</v>

3962
02:56:02.421 --> 02:56:04.130
<v Speaker 3>president elect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then again he gave over</v>

3963
02:56:04.131 --> 02:56:06.350
<v Speaker 3>$100,000,000,000 weapons deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The case of Israel,</v>

3964
02:56:06.351 --> 02:56:08.890
<v Speaker 3>jared Kushner has a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3965
02:56:08.930 --> 02:56:12.020
<v Speaker 3>millions of dollars from Israeli banks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Lo and behold,</v>

3966
02:56:12.140 --> 02:56:16.640
<v Speaker 3>when Donald Trump was president elect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tried to push the UN to not condemn</v>

3967
02:56:16.641 --> 02:56:18.260
<v Speaker 3>Israel over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal settlements.</v>

3968
02:56:18.530 --> 02:56:22.460
<v Speaker 3>So you have his entire administration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a grab bag of corruption in</v>

3969
02:56:22.461 --> 02:56:25.610
<v Speaker 3>foreign influence say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's far influence across the board</v>

3970
02:56:25.670 --> 02:56:28.220
<v Speaker 3>and its influenced also from</v>
<v Speaker 3>corporations.</v>

3971
02:56:28.550 --> 02:56:30.260
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are not focusing on the</v>

3972
02:56:30.261 --> 02:56:32.960
<v Speaker 3>corporations and they're not focusing on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other countries that they're corrupt</v>

3973
02:56:32.961 --> 02:56:36.290
<v Speaker 3>with because there are hyperfocused on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Russia thing and at the end of the</v>

3974
02:56:36.290 --> 02:56:38.750
<v Speaker 3>day they want to impeach trump over</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia.</v>

3975
02:56:39.110 --> 02:56:41.150
<v Speaker 3>But like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be hard to prove.</v>

3976
02:56:41.151 --> 02:56:44.060
<v Speaker 3>And then it's an open question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can indict A.</v>

3977
02:56:44.060 --> 02:56:45.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can indict a sitting</v>
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>

3978
02:56:45.651 --> 02:56:47.360
<v Speaker 3>You have to impeach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to fucking impeach.</v>

3979
02:56:47.540 --> 02:56:50.720
<v Speaker 3>So really this is Democrats sniffing</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own farts and acting like they're</v>

3980
02:56:50.721 --> 02:56:52.190
<v Speaker 3>doing something important when they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>really not.</v>

3981
02:56:52.310 --> 02:56:53.990
<v Speaker 3>And the only they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

3982
02:56:54.350 --> 02:56:56.240
<v Speaker 3>is money laundering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a corrupt businessman,</v>

3983
02:56:56.450 --> 02:57:00.350
<v Speaker 3>but he's not some sort of Putin puppet</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's actually done many policies</v>

3984
02:57:00.351 --> 02:57:02.180
<v Speaker 3>that are against Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

3985
02:57:02.181 --> 02:57:05.330
<v Speaker 3>he armed Ukrainian rebels who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting Russia right now.</v>

3986
02:57:05.510 --> 02:57:08.240
<v Speaker 3>You don't arm people who are fighting</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia if you're there fucking puppet,</v>

3987
02:57:08.740 --> 02:57:09.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3988
02:57:09.380 --> 02:57:13.220
<v Speaker 3>he also is bombing Syria and we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>staying indefinitely in Syria.</v>

3989
02:57:13.221 --> 02:57:16.850
<v Speaker 3>They just announced that recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't that Syria,</v>

3990
02:57:16.880 --> 02:57:18.920
<v Speaker 3>the Syrian government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of Putin's top allies.</v>

3991
02:57:19.100 --> 02:57:21.950
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to permanently occupy</v>
<v Speaker 3>their country and try to fight that</v>

3992
02:57:21.951 --> 02:57:25.100
<v Speaker 3>government if you're in bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're doing a NATO buildup on Russia's</v>

3993
02:57:25.101 --> 02:57:26.210
<v Speaker 3>border right now.</v>

3994
02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:29.120
<v Speaker 3>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a Putin's puppet,</v>

3995
02:57:29.360 --> 02:57:31.880
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a military buildup on his</v>
<v Speaker 3>border.</v>

3996
02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.470
<v Speaker 3>There was just a story the other day</v>
<v Speaker 3>about how now the US,</v>

3997
02:57:34.490 --> 02:57:36.860
<v Speaker 3>our military sending our ships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3998
02:57:37.020 --> 02:57:39.410
<v Speaker 3>to black seat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right on Russia's fucking border.</v>

3999
02:57:39.560 --> 02:57:42.390
<v Speaker 3>So it's military escalation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's another part of this that</v>

4000
02:57:42.400 --> 02:57:44.870
<v Speaker 3>pisses me off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that if the Democrats really want us</v>

4001
02:57:44.871 --> 02:57:46.970
<v Speaker 3>to resist trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>resist that,</v>

4002
02:57:46.971 --> 02:57:48.170
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to send our fucking</v>

4003
02:57:48.171 --> 02:57:50.120
<v Speaker 3>military to get into a standoff with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia.</v>

4004
02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:53.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to bomb Syria and</v>
<v Speaker 3>permanently occupy it.</v>

4005
02:57:53.150 --> 02:57:54.890
<v Speaker 3>This is how the Democrats should be</v>
<v Speaker 3>resisting.</v>

4006
02:57:55.040 --> 02:57:57.150
<v Speaker 3>They should be resisting trump from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>left wing position,</v>

4007
02:57:57.170 --> 02:57:59.540
<v Speaker 3>from an anti interventionist position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But instead,</v>

4008
02:57:59.541 --> 02:58:02.630
<v Speaker 3>everything you hear from the Democrats</v>
<v Speaker 3>is pays under Putin spellman.</v>

4009
02:58:02.640 --> 02:58:05.400
<v Speaker 3>He needs to make sure that he's even</v>
<v Speaker 3>harder on Putin and he does more</v>

4010
02:58:05.401 --> 02:58:07.860
<v Speaker 3>sanctions against Putin and he escalates</v>
<v Speaker 3>further with Russia.</v>

4011
02:58:08.310 --> 02:58:08.910
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

4012
02:58:08.910 --> 02:58:11.940
<v Speaker 3>there are nuclear armed power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to fucking get into a</v>

4013
02:58:11.941 --> 02:58:13.560
<v Speaker 3>confrontation with a nuclear armed</v>
<v Speaker 3>power?</v>

4014
02:58:13.920 --> 02:58:16.290
<v Speaker 3>We're sitting here living our lives just</v>
<v Speaker 3>going about our business.</v>

4015
02:58:16.770 --> 02:58:18.180
<v Speaker 3>And this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4016
02:58:18.181 --> 02:58:19.890
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're rolling the dice and we're playing</v>

4017
02:58:19.891 --> 02:58:24.891
<v Speaker 3>a game of chicken with Vladimir Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that they're just caught up</v>

4018
02:58:25.291 --> 02:58:26.970
<v Speaker 3>in this sexy thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4019
02:58:27.090 --> 02:58:28.620
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is sensationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4020
02:58:28.630 --> 02:58:29.311
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

4021
02:58:29.311 --> 02:58:31.350
<v Speaker 3>what the public is really focused on</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

4022
02:58:31.351 --> 02:58:34.380
<v Speaker 3>so it's something that gathers ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're driving it.</v>

4023
02:58:34.920 --> 02:58:38.070
<v Speaker 3>I think it's driven from the top down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the establishment media down from</v>

4024
02:58:38.071 --> 02:58:39.720
<v Speaker 3>the Democrats down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because again,</v>

4025
02:58:39.900 --> 02:58:42.720
<v Speaker 3>if you talk to regular people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking hurting,</v>

4026
02:58:43.110 --> 02:58:45.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wages have been stagnant since 1980.</v>

4027
02:58:45.840 --> 02:58:50.100
<v Speaker 3>There's 30 million people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have healthcare in trump's first year in</v>

4028
02:58:50.101 --> 02:58:52.860
<v Speaker 3>office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>3 million more people last healthcare</v>

4029
02:58:53.010 --> 02:58:56.310
<v Speaker 3>because he did all these executive</v>
<v Speaker 3>orders that basically took a hatchet to</v>

4030
02:58:56.311 --> 02:58:57.144
<v Speaker 3>obamacare.</v>

4031
02:58:57.360 --> 02:58:59.880
<v Speaker 3>So you have all these people who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>really hurting their.</v>

4032
02:58:59.930 --> 02:59:01.560
<v Speaker 3>They care about their wages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they care about,</v>

4033
02:59:01.710 --> 02:59:03.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not being saddled with over a trillion</v>

4034
02:59:03.960 --> 02:59:06.660
<v Speaker 3>dollars in student loan debt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the shit regular people care</v>

4035
02:59:06.661 --> 02:59:09.570
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they turn on CNN and they see</v>

4036
02:59:09.571 --> 02:59:10.171
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>

4037
02:59:10.171 --> 02:59:12.090
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you don't like trump,</v>

4038
02:59:12.091 --> 02:59:14.430
<v Speaker 3>I despise trump with every fiber of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking being.</v>

4039
02:59:14.431 --> 02:59:16.680
<v Speaker 3>But when I see this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I roll my fucking eyes and then they</v>

4040
02:59:16.681 --> 02:59:18.060
<v Speaker 3>have the nerve to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4041
02:59:18.061 --> 02:59:21.810
<v Speaker 3>trump won't shut up about Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were talking about it all day and he</v>

4042
02:59:21.811 --> 02:59:24.390
<v Speaker 3>responded to it and because he responds</v>
<v Speaker 3>to it,</v>

4043
02:59:24.391 --> 02:59:25.111
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4044
02:59:25.111 --> 02:59:27.430
<v Speaker 3>there he goes again with Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4045
02:59:27.510 --> 02:59:29.970
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be interesting to see how</v>
<v Speaker 3>this all plays out.</v>

4046
02:59:30.570 --> 02:59:33.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm really fascinated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated to see if he can make it</v>

4047
02:59:33.331 --> 02:59:34.680
<v Speaker 3>out of four years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4048
02:59:34.710 --> 02:59:35.130
<v Speaker 3>not only.</v>

4049
02:59:35.130 --> 02:59:36.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's gonna do think he's going</v>

4050
02:59:36.981 --> 02:59:38.840
<v Speaker 3>to run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to run again and he's going</v>

4051
02:59:38.841 --> 02:59:40.110
<v Speaker 3>to win again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a chance.</v>

4052
02:59:40.200 --> 02:59:42.370
<v Speaker 3>He has a fucking chance because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Democrats,</v>

4053
02:59:42.371 --> 02:59:45.660
<v Speaker 3>if the Democrats run Kamala Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they run cory booker or any of the</v>

4054
02:59:45.661 --> 02:59:49.170
<v Speaker 3>other corporatists he can win because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to go right back into his tap</v>

4055
02:59:49.171 --> 02:59:52.200
<v Speaker 3>dance about being a populist and helping</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and guess what?</v>

4056
02:59:52.201 --> 02:59:55.350
<v Speaker 3>In the first few years of his tax bill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regular people did get a tax cut,</v>

4057
02:59:55.650 --> 02:59:56.311
<v Speaker 3>so he's going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

4058
02:59:56.311 --> 02:59:59.460
<v Speaker 3>you look at your tax bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just gave you an extra thousand</v>

4059
02:59:59.460 --> 03:00:00.450
<v Speaker 3>dollars this year who you want to vote</v>
<v Speaker 3>for?</v>

4060
03:00:01.230 --> 03:00:04.650
<v Speaker 3>And so there is an argument that he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to make to the people and if you</v>

4061
03:00:04.651 --> 03:00:09.510
<v Speaker 3>don't have somebody like Bernie Sanders</v>
<v Speaker 3>or Bernie Sanders talking about the</v>

4062
03:00:09.511 --> 03:00:13.050
<v Speaker 3>issues that matter to people will then</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course he can fucking win again.</v>

4063
03:00:13.320 --> 03:00:15.120
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was.</v>

4064
03:00:15.480 --> 03:00:19.470
<v Speaker 3>I was laughed at when I said if it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton,</v>

4065
03:00:19.620 --> 03:00:22.310
<v Speaker 3>he can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When people left at me because they</v>

4066
03:00:22.311 --> 03:00:25.170
<v Speaker 3>didn't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't want it to be true because.</v>

4067
03:00:25.171 --> 03:00:26.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because then the narrative story,</v>

4068
03:00:27.360 --> 03:00:31.320
<v Speaker 3>all you saw was that there was like a 75</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent chance that hillary was gonna</v>

4069
03:00:31.321 --> 03:00:35.220
<v Speaker 3>win the fucking Huffington Post.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One was over 99 percent.</v>

4070
03:00:35.320 --> 03:00:38.940
<v Speaker 3>No God before the election to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>election.</v>

4071
03:00:38.941 --> 03:00:40.260
<v Speaker 3>So silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know though,</v>

4072
03:00:40.261 --> 03:00:43.350
<v Speaker 3>and the way they calculate it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>such good articles to the sprinkler and</v>

4073
03:00:43.351 --> 03:00:45.330
<v Speaker 3>great articles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's easily horseshoe.</v>

4074
03:00:45.360 --> 03:00:48.150
<v Speaker 3>The trick is avoid the opinion section</v>
<v Speaker 3>and.</v>

4075
03:00:48.180 --> 03:00:49.710
<v Speaker 3>But if.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you stick to the actual</v>

4076
03:00:49.711 --> 03:00:53.220
<v Speaker 3>journalists and then they do a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be embarrassing for them</v>

4077
03:00:53.700 --> 03:00:54.540
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For the journalist.</v>

4078
03:00:54.541 --> 03:00:55.051
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
