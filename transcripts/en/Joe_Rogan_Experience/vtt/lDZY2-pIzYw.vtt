1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.081
<v Speaker 1>Try my day.</v>

2
00:00:01.081 --> 00:00:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.510
<v Speaker 1>So a UFC two oh seven that was one of the crick.</v>

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
<v Speaker 1>One of the craziest events of all time and watching that main event was,</v>

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.980
<v Speaker 1>it was like there was,</v>

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.761
<v Speaker 1>it was surreal.</v>

7
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:18.101
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

8
00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 1>it's surreal because I was,</v>

9
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>my body was all weirded out because I was,</v>

10
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.920
<v Speaker 1>it was a little out of it,</v>

11
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.803
<v Speaker 1>about the past,</v>

12
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.990
<v Speaker 1>about the shit all over my chair.</v>

13
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.011
<v Speaker 1>But it was also,</v>

14
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:31.011
<v Speaker 1>it was just like that was the least competitive like main event other than</v>

15
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:34.530
<v Speaker 1>although in Mcgregor,</v>

16
00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 1>but that was one dynamic shot to the Chin and knocked him out.</v>

17
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Like everything about that was off kick.</v>

18
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Can you knit,</v>

19
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>can you think about another main event,</v>

20
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.240
<v Speaker 1>championship level where it was that kind of big of a discrepancy?</v>

21
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:48.751
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

22
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Like it was even a fight and I,</v>

23
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>and I think leading up to it,</v>

24
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>there was some kind of red flags that you saw leading up to it.</v>

25
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.670
<v Speaker 1>If you think back now that we can shape though everybody said right physically,</v>

26
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.533
<v Speaker 1>physically,</v>

27
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.523
<v Speaker 1>physically.</v>

28
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.350
<v Speaker 1>She looked great but like what's,</v>

29
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.820
<v Speaker 1>what kind of sparring was she doing?</v>

30
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:05.971
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

31
00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:07.890
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I was thinking when she was hitting pads,</v>

32
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.750
<v Speaker 1>she's standing there hitting pads with Edmond.</v>

33
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.291
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

34
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>they're standing right in front of each other.</v>

35
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Like she's not moving like she's just hitting pads,</v>

36
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:14.461
<v Speaker 1>pop,</v>

37
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:14.611
<v Speaker 1>pop,</v>

38
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:14.731
<v Speaker 1>pop,</v>

39
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:14.881
<v Speaker 1>pop,</v>

40
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:15.091
<v Speaker 1>pop,</v>

41
00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:15.421
<v Speaker 1>pop up.</v>

42
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Ads are tough to tell though,</v>

43
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:16.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

44
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Because sometimes the do it for the camera.</v>

45
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:20.340
<v Speaker 1>If the countdown cruiser and you don't want to show your new shit,</v>

46
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>but also what did people think was going to happen?</v>

47
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Like did you think this whole time when she's shooting these movies,</v>

48
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:30.771
<v Speaker 1>doing Suzie admin her come up with a plan for her to stick on the outside jab</v>

49
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:31.290
<v Speaker 1>and move.</v>

50
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>

51
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>that's not in her DNA.</v>

52
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.623
<v Speaker 1>That's person.</v>

53
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

54
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.180
<v Speaker 1>She had to close the distance and clinch,</v>

55
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:38.130
<v Speaker 1>I should have been the only plant.</v>

57
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.950
<v Speaker 1>The idea of standing with Amanda Nunez is just ridiculous.</v>

58
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>The difference in punching power is like literally double,</v>

59
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>but we've seen her fight they punches before who batch could hit pretty hard.</v>

60
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying similar but no,</v>

61
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:52.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying what batch did she,</v>

62
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.760
<v Speaker 1>she was a,</v>

63
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 1>has decent to power and she's a very aggressive,</v>

64
00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>she throws volume strikes but she throws her arms.</v>

65
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.900
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't hit nearly as hard as Amanda,</v>

66
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Amanda torques or whole body in the shit.</v>

67
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.020
<v Speaker 1>I agree Jo.</v>

68
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

69
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.810
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

70
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.810
<v Speaker 1>it's an batches arms for this long is fine and Dan got damn telephone poles and</v>

71
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:11.640
<v Speaker 1>that's all fine.</v>

72
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.200
<v Speaker 1>But don't you think the game plan should have been get her to the ground and she</v>

73
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:17.830
<v Speaker 1>tried that a little bit.</v>

74
00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:18.180
<v Speaker 1>She didn't,</v>

75
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Speaker 1>she was already lit up.</v>

76
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.400
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't there though.</v>

77
00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Mentally.</v>

78
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.631
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

79
00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:21.841
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

80
00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:25.200
<v Speaker 1>there's things leading up to it and I think the biggest red red flag for me,</v>

81
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.150
<v Speaker 1>and you know Dana better than anyone,</v>

82
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.940
<v Speaker 1>he's a promoter through and through one of the,</v>

83
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>if not the best of all time.</v>

84
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:32.041
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of another one.</v>

85
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Don King I guess,</v>

86
00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:34.980
<v Speaker 1>but still for him to say,</v>

87
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.401
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

88
00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>you can skip all the media shit and just focus on the fight.</v>

89
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.970
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

90
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.271
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

91
00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:40.680
<v Speaker 1>that just doesn't seem right.</v>

92
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:43.020
<v Speaker 1>You know why she's managed by,</v>

93
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:48.021
<v Speaker 1>or she's handled by William Morris Endeavor WME cause WME owns UFC now I'm aware</v>

94
00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:48.601
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

95
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:49.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that's what,</v>

96
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.450
<v Speaker 1>that's the only way I was his decision.</v>

97
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.313
<v Speaker 1>It was his decision.</v>

98
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.650
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

99
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm the one who led,</v>

100
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.810
<v Speaker 1>we agreed to this.</v>

101
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.950
<v Speaker 1>It was in her contract.</v>

102
00:02:55.951 --> 00:02:57.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a one time thing I'm never doing again.</v>

103
00:02:57.331 --> 00:02:57.631
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

104
00:02:57.631 --> 00:02:58.291
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>

105
00:02:58.291 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>that is so she put it in the contract.</v>

106
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.873
<v Speaker 1>She must have said,</v>

107
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>this is what I want to do.</v>

108
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk to any media.</v>

109
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 1>I just want to go out and try the red flag to you.</v>

110
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Not Have Connor did it.</v>

111
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.381
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

112
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Connor doesn't have the choice coming.</v>

113
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.871
<v Speaker 1>Connor did it,</v>

114
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>but if Connor did it,</v>

115
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:12.544
<v Speaker 1>if Connor said,</v>

116
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>fuck all this fucking media,</v>

117
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to Dublin,</v>

118
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to train.</v>

119
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 1>He would never do that.</v>

120
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.731
<v Speaker 1>If he did,</v>

121
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:19.321
<v Speaker 1>I'd have Z.</v>

122
00:03:19.321 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a proper red flagged out to anyone involved at all.</v>

123
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Dana,</v>

124
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>this say it's all good.</v>

125
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] here's the thing,</v>

126
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:26.921
<v Speaker 1>she goes out,</v>

127
00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:27.491
<v Speaker 1>she goes out,</v>

128
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:28.181
<v Speaker 1>grabs hold of men,</v>

129
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Nunez,</v>

130
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 1>flips her on her head,</v>

131
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>semi unconscious catches her in the arm bar.</v>

132
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.330
<v Speaker 1>She's the new champion.</v>

133
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.121
<v Speaker 1>35 seconds.</v>

134
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:35.140
<v Speaker 1>You're not saying this.</v>

135
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.063
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>

136
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.911
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

137
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:38.170
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't say there's a red flag.</v>

138
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 1>If she went out and dominated and he'd got an arm bar in the first round,</v>

139
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 1>you would definitely not say skip skipping the media as a red flag.</v>

140
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 1>So then she only saying it because this is like armchair quarterbacking.</v>

141
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.291
<v Speaker 1>It's not though,</v>

142
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 1>because I said it's a red flag before this because if she,</v>

143
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>so if she did interviews afterwards,</v>

144
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.510
<v Speaker 1>let's say she went out there dominator in a minute,</v>

145
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.460
<v Speaker 1>submitter and then shoot interviews afterwards,</v>

146
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.480
<v Speaker 1>that's a little different.</v>

147
00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:59.763
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

148
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Cause she just saying I'm not doing any meat at all.</v>

149
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Even posts posts.</v>

150
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

151
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Well she doesn't want to talk after that.</v>

152
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean why would you want to tell him the other thing,</v>

153
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 1>the whole cell on this,</v>

154
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 1>was she serious?</v>

155
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Now she's saying,</v>

156
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

157
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.060
<v Speaker 1>she's focused knowing her as you serious now with the whole thing,</v>

158
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.880
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing was like this big obvious marketing perspective.</v>

159
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Like a promotional Hollywood perspective.</v>

160
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Like they had the movie which is a really good like got you pumped up like that</v>

161
00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:30.420
<v Speaker 1>whole thing about her coming back and they lift up the garage door [inaudible]</v>

162
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.240
<v Speaker 1>working out really hard and it's they,</v>

163
00:04:32.241 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 1>what they did is they created a great hype piece.</v>

164
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 1>You know if you're in the Ronda Rousey business.</v>

165
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:38.471
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

166
00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Amanda Nunez going exactly the best was the best.</v>

167
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Was there a picture promoting this UFC and there's a picture of Ronda and her</v>

168
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:49.460
<v Speaker 1>fight care and Rhonda in the street clothes cause she's back two oh seven it's</v>

169
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.800
<v Speaker 1>like fuck man.</v>

170
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:53.470
<v Speaker 1>What about Amanda and when I say this crazy,</v>

171
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.030
<v Speaker 1>make sure who did that picture that he was at an official UFC picture official</v>

172
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.010
<v Speaker 1>UFC kind of a social media post.</v>

173
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

174
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.650
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy man.</v>

175
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Cause now what do you do?</v>

176
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>It's also crazy because it's crazy for a marketing perspective.</v>

177
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:06.311
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

178
00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:09.070
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people thought that Rhonda was going to win a lot of people.</v>

179
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I was 100% who the fuck knows me too.</v>

180
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.910
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly how I felt when I was watching that fight play out.</v>

181
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:16.301
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

182
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:17.560
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck knows?</v>

183
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could see,</v>

184
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.660
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

185
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda looked like she was in amazing shape.</v>

186
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.640
<v Speaker 1>You think about the things that Ron has been able to do in the past to like</v>

187
00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Sarah McMahon.</v>

188
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.381
<v Speaker 1>You would think,</v>

189
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 1>well maybe she ties her up in a clinch blasts or with a knee to the body,</v>

190
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:31.330
<v Speaker 1>flips her on her back and arm bars are,</v>

191
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.820
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck knows if she gets you on the ground?</v>

192
00:05:33.821 --> 00:05:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Her arm bar technique is outstanding.</v>

193
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.150
<v Speaker 1>It's just what some of the best,</v>

194
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.080
<v Speaker 1>if not the best I've ever scene that could have happened,</v>

195
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.760
<v Speaker 1>but it was so who the fuck knows?</v>

196
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:44.290
<v Speaker 1>But the moment she got hit,</v>

197
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.270
<v Speaker 1>she's not moving her head at all.</v>

198
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.290
<v Speaker 1>She's standing straight up in the air and then I see her legs get close together</v>

199
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.190
<v Speaker 1>and that's when you know someone's really hurt when someone gets lit up and then</v>

200
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:54.971
<v Speaker 1>they start moving,</v>

201
00:05:54.971 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Speaker 1>but their legs are too close together.</v>

202
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 1>She's not working right.</v>

203
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they,</v>

204
00:06:00.031 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 1>they kind of know what to do,</v>

205
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 1>but it's just not,</v>

206
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 1>they're not their balances and good.</v>

207
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 1>There was no head movement.</v>

208
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.130
<v Speaker 1>She was probably hurt with like the second or third punch that Amanda hit her</v>

209
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:10.321
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

210
00:06:10.321 --> 00:06:11.450
<v Speaker 1>She was probably on Queer Street.</v>

211
00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 1>That's a woke her up.</v>

212
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.170
<v Speaker 1>She didn't know where she was until she got it.</v>

213
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

214
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 1>look at that when she got hit.</v>

215
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:17.500
<v Speaker 1>When you go,</v>

216
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.901
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

217
00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:18.410
<v Speaker 1>she's hurt.</v>

218
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.243
<v Speaker 1>She's hurt.</v>

219
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Look at her face and you even said it yourself.</v>

220
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:23.660
<v Speaker 1>She drew up a kick.</v>

221
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 1>She threw some kicks to try to keep Amanda off.</v>

222
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.770
<v Speaker 1>I think she didn't realize.</v>

223
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 1>I think when Amanda Hits Girls,</v>

224
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:29.661
<v Speaker 1>they just go,</v>

225
00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

226
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>

227
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.361
<v Speaker 1>but what else would you,</v>

228
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:33.920
<v Speaker 1>what else would you expect in that?</v>

229
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:34.371
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

230
00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:34.701
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

231
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 1>you don't realize till you get hit,</v>

232
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:37.210
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

233
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 1>you hear all the criticism now of,</v>

234
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

235
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Edmond who's obviously a terrible coach,</v>

236
00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 1>but take that out of it.</v>

237
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:42.960
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

238
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.160
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

239
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 1>if you bring a horse to water and they can't drink,</v>

240
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing else you can do.</v>

241
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 1>So if mentally she doesn't want to be in there,</v>

242
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.630
<v Speaker 1>do you think weight didn't want to be in there?</v>

243
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

244
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.480
<v Speaker 1>did they say that it didn't look like the same tenacity that were used to seeing</v>

245
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.741
<v Speaker 1>chill?</v>

246
00:06:55.741 --> 00:06:57.830
<v Speaker 1>It's super tenacious until she got cracked.</v>

247
00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Joe Is 44 seconds.</v>

248
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.633
<v Speaker 1>Snapchat,</v>

249
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.000
<v Speaker 1>that First Jab,</v>

250
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.940
<v Speaker 1>she got hurt with a right hand.</v>

251
00:07:03.941 --> 00:07:04.820
<v Speaker 1>May Be 10 50.</v>

252
00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:06.500
<v Speaker 1>We didn't watch the whole fight fight.</v>

253
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.030
<v Speaker 1>It's 40 seconds.</v>

254
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Go fight.</v>

255
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.051
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>

256
00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

257
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.453
<v Speaker 1>it's on youtube.</v>

258
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.181
<v Speaker 1>It's everywhere.</v>

259
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:11.820
<v Speaker 1>As a matter.</v>

260
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:12.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

261
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.863
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

262
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Tough fighters before.</v>

263
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you think it is?</v>

264
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why.</v>

265
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Why are you even saying this?</v>

266
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.640
<v Speaker 1>You see that she got hit and you,</v>

267
00:07:19.641 --> 00:07:19.850
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

268
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.490
<v Speaker 1>she got hurt and you've been hitting hurt before.</v>

269
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Who Know what happens?</v>

270
00:07:22.761 --> 00:07:24.260
<v Speaker 1>You just don't know what the fuck's going on.</v>

271
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

272
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.893
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

273
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that jab put her lights out.</v>

274
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.380
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just a jab dude.</v>

275
00:07:30.381 --> 00:07:33.820
<v Speaker 1>She hit her with a refresh jab that landed the first time she went into Cape</v>

276
00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:34.320
<v Speaker 1>close desk.</v>

277
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>First Jab landed,</v>

278
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:37.100
<v Speaker 1>but then she got hit with many punches.</v>

279
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:40.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why you're confused as to the result.</v>

280
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean she got hit by the biggest power punch her in the hundred 35 pound</v>

281
00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:45.110
<v Speaker 1>division by far.</v>

282
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Speaker 1>There's not a single girl in that division that punches like Amanda does.</v>

283
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:48.891
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that,</v>

284
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:49.540
<v Speaker 1>but not right.</v>

285
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.020
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a right hand right away.</v>

286
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Yes it was.</v>

287
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.910
<v Speaker 1>It was a jab right away.</v>

288
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Right hand right after that.</v>

289
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Once,</v>

290
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.960
<v Speaker 1>once run to try to close distance was 40 seconds of Amanda Punching Rhonda in</v>

291
00:07:59.961 --> 00:08:02.690
<v Speaker 1>the face until Rhonda would out like the idea that some,</v>

292
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.780
<v Speaker 1>something's confusing that she didn't look like she wanted to be there.</v>

293
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.060
<v Speaker 1>She was hurt multiple times.</v>

294
00:08:08.061 --> 00:08:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Now in those exchanges,</v>

295
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:09.950
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

296
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.110
<v Speaker 1>I think we're doing a lot of arm chair quarterbacking.</v>

297
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

298
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.760
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows what was going on?</v>

299
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:15.080
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

300
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.320
<v Speaker 1>You're speculating whether or not you wanted to be there after she got hit.</v>

301
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.110
<v Speaker 1>The problem is she might've been just rocked.</v>

302
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.090
<v Speaker 1>And there's also the reality that she was knocked out fucking cold a year ago</v>

303
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.770
<v Speaker 1>and it was a bad beating and then a vicious head kick and there is something</v>

304
00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:32.600
<v Speaker 1>about those goddamn neck kicks,</v>

305
00:08:32.601 --> 00:08:33.260
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

306
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.480
<v Speaker 1>There's something about when we,</v>

307
00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:36.440
<v Speaker 1>when someone shins you in the neck,</v>

308
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.320
<v Speaker 1>like she got shin and your whole body just goes limp.</v>

309
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.380
<v Speaker 1>You're doing so much damage in there.</v>

310
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:44.180
<v Speaker 1>But she had a 411 days off.</v>

311
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.110
<v Speaker 1>That's nice.</v>

312
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just bad strategy.</v>

313
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.630
<v Speaker 1>It's really simple.</v>

314
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.520
<v Speaker 1>The strategy was not good.</v>

315
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Amanda's just best as possible to all those things.</v>

316
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

317
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.680
<v Speaker 1>I was the one who said like way early on,</v>

318
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I think Amanda's are most dangerous challenge cause a man to hits so fucking</v>

319
00:08:58.171 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 1>hard after she starts,</v>

320
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Sara Mcmann and uh,</v>

321
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:01.321
<v Speaker 1>when she,</v>

322
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:03.880
<v Speaker 1>when she was beaten up me shows like Jesus Christ,</v>

323
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.420
<v Speaker 1>she punches harder than anybody in that division.</v>

324
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.850
<v Speaker 1>She's got like dangerous weapons with her hands.</v>

325
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.013
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>

326
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 1>I really think there's a lot of people that get CalEd like that and they are</v>

327
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:13.860
<v Speaker 1>never the same again.</v>

328
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 1>I agree that they can't absorb a shot anymore and then also in your brain</v>

329
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.290
<v Speaker 1>according to chocolate down.</v>

330
00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:20.850
<v Speaker 1>And he was telling me about it like,</v>

331
00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:21.301
<v Speaker 1>because he,</v>

332
00:09:21.301 --> 00:09:21.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

333
00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:25.980
<v Speaker 1>chuck was so tough that he would like just fucking use his chin sorta like</v>

334
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:26.641
<v Speaker 1>Lineker does.</v>

335
00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Like it's part of his defense,</v>

336
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.100
<v Speaker 1>like knowing that he can absorb shots and after a while his brain was like,</v>

337
00:09:32.101 --> 00:09:32.640
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

338
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.600
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

339
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Like his brain was just like,</v>

340
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:36.860
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to do this and just cause your shit.</v>

341
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:37.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

342
00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:38.190
<v Speaker 1>just shuts off early.</v>

343
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.053
<v Speaker 1>I also think tech,</v>

344
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain level where they're,</v>

345
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:44.250
<v Speaker 1>where they're that great and you look at like a tiger woods and Mike Tyson.</v>

346
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.250
<v Speaker 1>When that foundation gets a little shaky,</v>

347
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:48.360
<v Speaker 1>there's just never the same.</v>

348
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

349
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.100
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

350
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.621
<v Speaker 1>It's just never,</v>

351
00:09:49.621 --> 00:09:50.130
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

352
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm not God's gift to the Eoc.</v>

353
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Exactly know them and we gods don't give a shit.</v>

354
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

355
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:55.500
<v Speaker 1>And then like we said,</v>

356
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.540
<v Speaker 1>even if she was undefeated and she saw it fought,</v>

357
00:09:57.541 --> 00:10:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Nunez Nunez going to give her a problems because if you watch like the Misha</v>

358
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Tate fight Meisha Tate like even though she beat me,</v>

359
00:10:03.481 --> 00:10:04.500
<v Speaker 1>she tight twice.</v>

360
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:04.951
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>

361
00:10:04.951 --> 00:10:05.341
<v Speaker 1>she'd take,</v>

362
00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:06.300
<v Speaker 1>gave her a hard time.</v>

363
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.550
<v Speaker 1>There's some good scrambles.</v>

364
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Beach Dade hit her with some punches.</v>

365
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.610
<v Speaker 1>If Amanda Hits You with punches like that,</v>

366
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:12.241
<v Speaker 1>you're fuck,</v>

367
00:10:12.241 --> 00:10:13.740
<v Speaker 1>you can't make mistakes.</v>

368
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.370
<v Speaker 1>You're in trouble.</v>

369
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

370
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.121
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

371
00:10:15.121 --> 00:10:15.300
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

372
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.900
<v Speaker 1>like in a lot of ways she's like a female rumble in that she might not be able</v>

373
00:10:18.901 --> 00:10:21.720
<v Speaker 1>to close this show with one shot like rumble Ken.</v>

374
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.310
<v Speaker 1>But if you make mistakes,</v>

375
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.450
<v Speaker 1>you get stung so bad and you see it with Sara McMann fights.</v>

376
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:28.380
<v Speaker 1>A perfect example,</v>

377
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.320
<v Speaker 1>she cracked Sarah with a right hand.</v>

378
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.050
<v Speaker 1>You see her.</v>

379
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Her whole face is like,</v>

380
00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:34.680
<v Speaker 1>what the like nobody hits them like that.</v>

381
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Nobody and she's long a man that catches you on the end of those punches too.</v>

382
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:40.140
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

383
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.310
<v Speaker 1>she's great at distance.</v>

384
00:10:41.311 --> 00:10:46.311
<v Speaker 1>I also think that the game's evolving so fast where Amanda,</v>

385
00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:47.970
<v Speaker 1>all she cares about is being champ.</v>

386
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.960
<v Speaker 1>All she does is train.</v>

387
00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:51.180
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing she gives a fuck up.</v>

388
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.790
<v Speaker 1>I think we saw the same thing in the Dominick Cruz,</v>

389
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:54.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

390
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Cody Garbrandt fight.</v>

391
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.120
<v Speaker 1>All Cody wants to do is be champ.</v>

392
00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Dominic's doing analyst's work he is for.</v>

393
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.020
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's,</v>

394
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.740
<v Speaker 1>there's this kind of change of hands right now where you're seeing these guys</v>

395
00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:05.790
<v Speaker 1>who were there all in.</v>

396
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:08.550
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you have to do to be in this game this day and age.</v>

397
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.170
<v Speaker 1>Guys are too good there too.</v>

398
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:10.351
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

399
00:11:10.351 --> 00:11:11.280
<v Speaker 1>And I think you're dead right.</v>

400
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.690
<v Speaker 1>I think you're dead right about that.</v>

401
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:12.961
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

402
00:11:12.961 --> 00:11:13.351
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>

403
00:11:13.351 --> 00:11:14.820
<v Speaker 1>We'll watch the whole thing live now.</v>

404
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.340
<v Speaker 1>Give us a volume young Jamie.</v>

405
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:18.870
<v Speaker 1>So here it is.</v>

406
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.760
<v Speaker 1>So that jab landed with five seconds.</v>

407
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Jab right there.</v>

408
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Watch says she's down there.</v>

409
00:11:24.841 --> 00:11:25.674
<v Speaker 1>Right there.</v>

410
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:27.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

411
00:11:27.301 --> 00:11:27.571
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

412
00:11:27.571 --> 00:11:28.381
<v Speaker 1>so she stung.</v>

413
00:11:28.381 --> 00:11:29.280
<v Speaker 1>10 seconds in.</v>

414
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:32.450
<v Speaker 1>We're at four 43 were 15 seconds in and she's already got,</v>

415
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:33.780
<v Speaker 1>she's fucked right there.</v>

416
00:11:33.781 --> 00:11:34.470
<v Speaker 1>She's fuck.</v>

417
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.240
<v Speaker 1>That was a super hard right hand.</v>

418
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.860
<v Speaker 1>And this is bad.</v>

419
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.000
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to watch.</v>

420
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.700
<v Speaker 1>It's real hard to watch a boom to the body,</v>

421
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.320
<v Speaker 1>to she rip that shot to the body.</v>

422
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:47.520
<v Speaker 1>So like the idea that she didn't want to be there 10 seconds into the fight.</v>

423
00:11:47.521 --> 00:11:48.960
<v Speaker 1>She didn't know what the fuck was going.</v>

424
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.411
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

425
00:11:49.411 --> 00:11:51.840
<v Speaker 1>they're left to the right hand in that right hand behind it.</v>

426
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.710
<v Speaker 1>This is horrific,</v>

427
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:54.544
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

428
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.200
<v Speaker 1>It's tough.</v>

429
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:55.701
<v Speaker 1>A lunch,</v>

430
00:11:55.701 --> 00:11:55.911
