1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Here we go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

2
00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:04.890
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.990
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.430
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we get started,</v>

5
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I want to say I love your reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are my favorite.</v>

6
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the.</v>

7
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Well you and Lou.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Lou too,</v>

8
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.910
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

9
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:16.883
<v Speaker 1>you're so good at covering all the bases</v>
<v Speaker 1>of whether it's cell phones or any kind </v>

10
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:25.020
<v Speaker 1>of weird technology that's coming out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just,</v>

11
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>you just nail it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

12
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.380
<v Speaker 1>you're so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're my go to guy man.</v>

13
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

14
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.900
<v Speaker 1>That's quite an intro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that.</v>

15
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.510
<v Speaker 1>I really want to tell it like whenever a</v>
<v Speaker 1>new cell phones out,</v>

16
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.490
<v Speaker 1>like I saw that you walked in with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>red,</v>

17
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 1>but that's your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not your daily driver.</v>

18
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you would like this.</v>

19
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean every phone now is glass on glass</v>

20
00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:42.924
<v Speaker 1>and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

21
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

22
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.040
<v Speaker 1>this red hydrogen one has a lot of weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff about it.</v>

23
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's first of all,</v>

24
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:52.730
<v Speaker 1>it's about twice as big as it has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's from red,</v>

25
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.490
<v Speaker 1>which is a camera company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why all these buttons everywhere.</v>

26
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 1>So really good grip buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just a grip,</v>

27
00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.613
<v Speaker 1>this grip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can probably drop it from 45 feet </v>

28
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 1>and it'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throw it across the room,</v>

29
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.830
<v Speaker 1>but the weird part is it's made by red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so red is a camera company there.</v>

30
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>They used their cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love their cameras,</v>

31
00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:11.590
<v Speaker 1>but then they come out with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a function.</v>

32
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.330
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is a screen.</v>

33
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's my foot actually.</v>

34
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:18.300
<v Speaker 1>So that's next to the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The iphone eight plus,</v>

35
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:21.930
<v Speaker 1>which is already a huge phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this metal thing on the back?</v>

36
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:25.410
<v Speaker 1>That brass looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's got these pins and it's supposed</v>

37
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:28.710
<v Speaker 1>to next year support modules that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>connect to it.</v>

38
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>So potentially Vr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better camera,</v>

39
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.340
<v Speaker 1>bigger battery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Vr,</v>

40
00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:35.970
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read,</v>

41
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>decide to support or make will attach to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

42
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's also Kinda may or may not </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen for awhile.</v>

43
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Jamie ordered one.</v>

44
00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:47.490
<v Speaker 1>When did you order one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paid for it last.</v>

45
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right when I went on sale last August,</v>

46
00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>maybe vaporware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>

47
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.690
<v Speaker 1>My official ingest ship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a prototype.</v>

48
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.880
<v Speaker 1>This is the prototype you have here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

49
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've worked with red for.</v>

50
00:01:58.591 --> 00:01:59.424
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a lot of the process since </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten like eight software updates </v>

51
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>and this is not final,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like gets a pretty good idea.</v>

52
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about it so far?</v>

53
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.813
<v Speaker 1>So I surprisingly get a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like new camera companies or new </v>

54
00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:15.630
<v Speaker 1>companies come up and make a phone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not right in a lot of ways.</v>

55
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.130
<v Speaker 1>They kind of took a lot of notes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they went and minimal with the software.</v>

56
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.963
<v Speaker 1>I like that about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was expecting the camera to be </v>

57
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:23.910
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's they don't use.</v>

58
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:27.360
<v Speaker 1>They don't make this sensor so the </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera is not amazing yet,</v>

59
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.580
<v Speaker 1>but I think the modules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll make this what it is.</v>

60
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I think the phone by itself is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really $1,300</v>

61
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.183
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's support for upcoming things </v>

62
00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:41.850
<v Speaker 1>that they're planning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we'll make it good.</v>

63
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.893
<v Speaker 1>Is it a problem when a company tries to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get into the cell phone business and </v>

64
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:48.240
<v Speaker 1>you're competing with Samsung,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple,</v>

65
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard way.</v>

66
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.263
<v Speaker 1>There's just so many companies that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>so advanced for you to be read who's </v>

67
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.200
<v Speaker 1>essentially a camera manufacturer that </v>
<v Speaker 1>make video cameras.</v>

68
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really high end for people that</v>

69
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 2>know a really high end hd video cameras </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of movies are shot on them.</v>

70
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 2>Films,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of things.</v>

71
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 2>You need to videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

72
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do all your youtube videos with it.</v>

73
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it really that good for you?</v>

74
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it worth having a read?</v>

75
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 2>It's a large camera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

76
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:15.410
<v Speaker 2>It's heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

77
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.243
<v Speaker 3>It started off not that great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I got used to it and then they </v>

78
00:03:19.221 --> 00:03:22.760
<v Speaker 3>got better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was probably like five years ago</v>

79
00:03:22.761 --> 00:03:24.860
<v Speaker 3>that I first started with a red,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a red scarlet.</v>

80
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.200
<v Speaker 3>This four k five k cameron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

81
00:03:27.201 --> 00:03:30.500
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of a pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the workflow has gotten better.</v>

82
00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:35.501
<v Speaker 3>They've worked with smaller teams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like individual creators even to get the</v>

83
00:03:36.261 --> 00:03:39.620
<v Speaker 3>cameras now smaller it does more in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller body.</v>

84
00:03:39.621 --> 00:03:42.800
<v Speaker 3>So it's gotten a lot easier to use a red</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a small team.</v>

85
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.630
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

86
00:03:44.631 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 3>five years ago they were making a read </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a movie shoot with 15 people using.</v>

87
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how much do they weigh?</v>

88
00:03:51.681 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

89
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.343
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't tell you a weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say probably between six and 10 </v>

90
00:03:56.691 --> 00:03:58.410
<v Speaker 3>pounds at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

91
00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.870
<v Speaker 3>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's completely modular.</v>

92
00:03:59.871 --> 00:04:02.990
<v Speaker 3>You rig it up to be what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like you get that out the box,</v>

93
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.440
<v Speaker 3>which is just the brain we're looking at</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people who are just listening,</v>

94
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.450
<v Speaker 3>it says Red Dragon on the side.</v>

95
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.160
<v Speaker 3>Why is it called silver?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Red Dragon.</v>

96
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.860
<v Speaker 3>And you got some names.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty clutch looking.</v>

97
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.710
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks really like a computer,</v>

98
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.820
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what,</v>

99
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.713
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're looking at is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>the computer and the sensor and that </v>

100
00:04:19.941 --> 00:04:22.670
<v Speaker 3>side piece right there is the SSD </v>
<v Speaker 3>reader.</v>

101
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.340
<v Speaker 3>Everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those pins you see on the top and on</v>

102
00:04:25.341 --> 00:04:26.174
<v Speaker 3>the side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where you connect what you want </v>

103
00:04:27.561 --> 00:04:28.394
<v Speaker 3>to make it the rig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're doing this eight years ago </v>

104
00:04:31.041 --> 00:04:31.874
<v Speaker 3>you would attach a viewfinder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd attach a couple monitors for </v>

105
00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:38.480
<v Speaker 3>director as you would attach a controls </v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

106
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the follow focus on the Lens.</v>

107
00:04:41.061 --> 00:04:43.310
<v Speaker 3>Obviously the mount,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff has to attached to it.</v>

108
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:44.803
<v Speaker 3>But for just me and my use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd use it more kind of like what you </v>

109
00:04:47.061 --> 00:04:50.660
<v Speaker 3>might see in another image,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just a monitor and SSD,</v>

110
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.330
<v Speaker 3>a controller and a lens and that does </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

111
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.740
<v Speaker 3>So is the idea</v>

112
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 2>eventually that this phone is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to do everything that that does.</v>

113
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.610
<v Speaker 3>So that I think if you asked read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would say yes,</v>

114
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.450
<v Speaker 3>but they aren't there yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously.</v>

115
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.570
<v Speaker 3>How could they released something and </v>
<v Speaker 3>not have an amazing camera on?</v>

116
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems crazy that,</v>

117
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.253
<v Speaker 3>that I think is what I think a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were super hyped about because </v>

118
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.290
<v Speaker 3>obviously red's good with not just the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they make the silicon for the camera,</v>

119
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:24.190
<v Speaker 3>but they're good at color science and </v>
<v Speaker 3>autofocus and all these different things</v>

120
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:26.340
<v Speaker 3>that cameras should be good at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

121
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.900
<v Speaker 3>so when they come out with a phone that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has a camera on it,</v>

122
00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:30.400
<v Speaker 3>you just kind of expect it to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

123
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.273
<v Speaker 3>So when it's not the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I firmly believe this is the best </v>

124
00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:36.100
<v Speaker 3>camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have the Google Pixel three.</v>

125
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:38.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the best camera in a phone?</v>

126
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 3>Are you a Google Pixel fanboy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I this point,</v>

127
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:42.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fan of the camera,</v>

128
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.190
<v Speaker 3>which has turned me into a fan of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest of the phone.</v>

129
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.040
<v Speaker 3>Just the camera alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an unusual cameron that it only has</v>

130
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:49.480
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One camera.</v>

131
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.260
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

132
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.920
<v Speaker 3>There's one camera where everybody else </v>
<v Speaker 3>is going with multiple cameras.</v>

133
00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:56.380
<v Speaker 3>Three for Google's doing everything with</v>
<v Speaker 3>software.</v>

134
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I liked that about it.</v>

135
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 3>Now is that the xl cxl it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem that big.</v>

136
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of not that insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think everyone's,</v>

137
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:06.584
<v Speaker 3>everyone's into the notch obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a little different from what </v>

138
00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:10.214
<v Speaker 3>you might see in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an iphone or a Huawei phone or </v>

139
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:13.910
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

140
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:14.803
<v Speaker 3>but the software is very googly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The screen is much better than last </v>

141
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.990
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's glass of wireless charging.</v>

142
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 3>It's got all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last year's phone didn't have,</v>

143
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.110
<v Speaker 3>but the camera is absolutely what makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>that phone good.</v>

144
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 3>It's really that much better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is that much better.</v>

145
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:28.860
<v Speaker 3>What is so good about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

146
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 3>it's like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the software.</v>

147
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.693
<v Speaker 3>So what Google does with HDR and </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially their image processing is a </v>

148
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:40.170
<v Speaker 3>big part of why it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can put the same sensor in glass and</v>

149
00:06:40.171 --> 00:06:43.160
<v Speaker 3>another smartphone with way weaker </v>
<v Speaker 3>software and it wouldn't look as good.</v>

150
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what they do with that,</v>

151
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 3>that image processing APP,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a rolling buffer of images.</v>

152
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:51.980
<v Speaker 3>So you can take a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like instant shutter.</v>

153
00:06:51.981 --> 00:06:54.300
<v Speaker 3>So as soon as you press the shutter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's instant shutter a,</v>

154
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.020
<v Speaker 3>you freeze the motion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dynamic range is great.</v>

155
00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:59.930
<v Speaker 3>The detail is great and it's photos are </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

156
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.330
<v Speaker 3>I was amazed of the low light photos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

157
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.590
<v Speaker 3>there was stunning because I had seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>before that was the Walway,</v>

158
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.470
<v Speaker 3>the mate Rs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it was.</v>

159
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.320
<v Speaker 3>There's been a couple really good night </v>
<v Speaker 3>modes in while we phones.</v>

160
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.173
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this seemed even better than that </v>

161
00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:15.644
<v Speaker 3>and it didn't seem distorted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seemed like you realized it was at </v>

162
00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:19.460
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you could see all the detail.</v>

163
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:20.541
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>

164
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 3>It's just never going to look as good as</v>
<v Speaker 3>daytime.</v>

165
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:23.000
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

166
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:23.863
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

167
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.460
<v Speaker 3>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have the update yet,</v>

168
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:26.294
<v Speaker 3>but there's going to be an update to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pixel that has night site or another </v>

169
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:31.880
<v Speaker 3>night mode that does the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is taking a bunch of exposures and</v>

170
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:32.714
<v Speaker 3>long exposures and use a stabilization </v>
<v Speaker 3>and hopefully get some much brighter </v>

171
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:40.570
<v Speaker 3>image that looks way better than what </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be different from the update in,</v>

172
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.100
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in comparison to what it does now.</v>

173
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.450
<v Speaker 3>So right now if you just take a photo at</v>
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>

174
00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:47.030
<v Speaker 3>it'll just try to noise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reduce all.</v>

175
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:49.400
<v Speaker 3>Like when you take a photo at night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of grain,</v>

176
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.263
<v Speaker 3>you're pumping the ISO all the way up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you clean all that noise out </v>

177
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.673
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of like airbrushing the image </v>

178
00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:57.800
<v Speaker 3>and it's going to be softer.</v>

179
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.470
<v Speaker 3>So if you do a lot of noise reduction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you lose all your detail.</v>

180
00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:03.620
<v Speaker 3>It's really soft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So low light photos just aren't as good.</v>

181
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.090
<v Speaker 3>But if you can take a longer exposure </v>
<v Speaker 3>with better stabilization,</v>

182
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:12.410
<v Speaker 3>you can not crank the ISO as high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not introduced as much noise.</v>

183
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.750
<v Speaker 3>And then at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a more detailed,</v>

184
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.613
<v Speaker 3>better looking photo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the theory behind a lot of </v>

185
00:08:18.171 --> 00:08:21.380
<v Speaker 3>these night modes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do they do the all in software?</v>

186
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.033
<v Speaker 3>A lot of calibration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of knowing exactly how good the </v>

187
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:28.070
<v Speaker 3>optical image stabilization is in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lens.</v>

188
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.290
<v Speaker 3>And then electronic stabilization as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

189
00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:34.100
<v Speaker 3>A lot of algorithms knowing what part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the photo is moving versus what isn't.</v>

190
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:35.613
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of computational </v>
<v Speaker 3>photography is what it's called a </v>

191
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.300
<v Speaker 3>happening on the chip that makes it that</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

192
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.313
<v Speaker 3>It's just fascinating that Google is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>only one who's doing this with one </v>

193
00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:46.430
<v Speaker 3>camera as opposed to everyone else.</v>

194
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:49.940
<v Speaker 3>Like my iphone has several cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a uh,</v>

195
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.310
<v Speaker 3>a note nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I really like.</v>

196
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 3>And one of the other things about Google</v>
<v Speaker 3>does not have a lot of Ram.</v>

197
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:57.683
<v Speaker 3>Now I've found that actually kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an interesting week point about this </v>

198
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:01.164
<v Speaker 3>phone and I haven't even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've reviewed it and it was kind of </v>

199
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:05.760
<v Speaker 3>skeptical about it's only only four gigs</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Ram,</v>

200
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.650
<v Speaker 3>which is like a couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

201
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 3>Four weeks or I'm at a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

202
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:09.954
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of phones coming out and has </v>

203
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.080
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight gigs of Ram.</v>

204
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.120
<v Speaker 3>Who has the most right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A phone,</v>

205
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:17.430
<v Speaker 3>just a gaming phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just came out with 10 gigs of Ram or the</v>

206
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:19.110
<v Speaker 3>razor phone or a different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now another one,</v>

207
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:21.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't even remember the name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then there's also an apo.</v>

208
00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:24.860
<v Speaker 3>Find x with 10 gigs of Ram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do you need that?</v>

209
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:25.590
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>

210
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:26.730
<v Speaker 3>You don't need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would.</v>

211
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 3>What would be the benefit of having 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>gigs of Ram?</v>

212
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:29.874
<v Speaker 3>Like what software would run?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically the advantage to having more </v>

213
00:09:32.251 --> 00:09:36.480
<v Speaker 3>ram is keeping apps open and running in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the background longer,</v>

214
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.343
<v Speaker 3>so if you have your camera and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter and your instagram and your web </v>

215
00:09:40.411 --> 00:09:42.360
<v Speaker 3>browser and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of high,</v>

216
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:47.100
<v Speaker 3>maybe a couple of games all running at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same time and then you multitask and</v>

217
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:49.290
<v Speaker 3>switch between them on a phone with less</v>
<v Speaker 3>ram.</v>

218
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:50.124
<v Speaker 3>You'll find that you'll switch from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>game to the browser and you go back to </v>

219
00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:56.700
<v Speaker 3>the browser and it reloads everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it completely garbage.</v>

220
00:09:56.701 --> 00:09:58.060
<v Speaker 3>That from the memory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After awhile,</v>

221
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.350
<v Speaker 3>because it was trying to save space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so on the phone with four gigs of Ram,</v>

222
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.303
<v Speaker 3>this happened a couple of times where </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be listening to music and I'd open </v>

223
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:05.304
<v Speaker 3>the camera and take a few photos and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then the music or the podcasts or </v>

224
00:10:08.131 --> 00:10:08.964
<v Speaker 3>whatever would just stop and it killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>that APP in the background with only </v>

225
00:10:11.521 --> 00:10:12.354
<v Speaker 3>four gigs of Ram.</v>

226
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing that crazy things with </v>
<v Speaker 3>multitasking.</v>

227
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.013
<v Speaker 3>Just two things running just to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it might've been a bug because </v>

228
00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:19.374
<v Speaker 3>the camera uses a lot of memory and for </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever reason it just picks the other </v>

229
00:10:21.781 --> 00:10:25.110
<v Speaker 3>big memory app and kills it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not very repeatable.</v>

230
00:10:25.111 --> 00:10:27.510
<v Speaker 3>I've had it happen to me since I landed </v>
<v Speaker 3>yesterday,</v>

231
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.290
<v Speaker 3>like a couple of times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it I think a phone with six or eight</v>

232
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:32.124
<v Speaker 3>gigs of Ram though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last phone I was using for awhile </v>

233
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:38.490
<v Speaker 3>was the one plus six has eight gigs of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ram and I never happened to me.</v>

234
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.900
<v Speaker 3>Every time I multitask and go back five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 apps to go and open it,</v>

235
00:10:42.901 --> 00:10:43.734
<v Speaker 3>it was right where I left off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the Google Pixel three your favorite </v>

236
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:50.790
<v Speaker 3>phone or is it just your favorite film?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because of the camera.</v>

237
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:56.810
<v Speaker 3>It is my favorite phone period and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>also has the best camera.</v>

238
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:57.923
<v Speaker 3>And is it your favorite film because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>has pure Google because you have the </v>

239
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.833
<v Speaker 3>android,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the latest android which is Kinda </v>

240
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.453
<v Speaker 3>hard to find and then you get obviously </v>
<v Speaker 3>this pure google experience in this </v>

241
00:11:07.981 --> 00:11:12.090
<v Speaker 3>amazing camera and a great display and </v>
<v Speaker 3>my priority is in a phone or pretty much</v>

242
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:12.953
<v Speaker 3>along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need a great camera and then I want a </v>

243
00:11:14.791 --> 00:11:15.624
<v Speaker 3>great display.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want good software and then the rest </v>

244
00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:20.070
<v Speaker 3>kind of follows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you want pure Google,</v>

245
00:11:20.071 --> 00:11:21.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be operating under the</v>

246
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:23.640
<v Speaker 3>Samsung Skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mind.</v>

247
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't mind a skin if it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

248
00:11:26.401 --> 00:11:30.290
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of skins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one plus has oxygen less and it's a</v>

249
00:11:30.291 --> 00:11:32.760
<v Speaker 3>skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Technically it's close to pure google,</v>

250
00:11:32.761 --> 00:11:36.000
<v Speaker 3>but it's missing a lot of the pixel </v>
<v Speaker 3>features but it's fine.</v>

251
00:11:36.001 --> 00:11:36.834
<v Speaker 3>It's smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>

252
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.240
<v Speaker 3>Is One plus running the latest android?</v>

253
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.133
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

254
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.030
<v Speaker 3>Who is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a central phone.</v>

255
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:46.200
<v Speaker 3>So one plus I think just got the android</v>
<v Speaker 3>p update essential,</v>

256
00:11:46.201 --> 00:11:51.201
<v Speaker 3>just got the android update and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone else is on like one version ago</v>

257
00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:54.120
<v Speaker 3>or older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why?</v>

258
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.100
<v Speaker 3>Why is that a pain the ass for them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can't it be universal?</v>

259
00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:58.203
<v Speaker 3>I have a bunch of theories on why they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't update their software as quickly </v>

260
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 3>as they probably could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of it in the US,</v>

261
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.720
<v Speaker 3>especially as youth carriers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have to get a.</v>

262
00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.090
<v Speaker 3>You want to push a software update to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone on verizon for example.</v>

263
00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:17.260
<v Speaker 3>Not only do you have to like rewrite the</v>
<v Speaker 3>software and optimized and everything,</v>

264
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:20.980
<v Speaker 3>but then you have to submit it for like </v>
<v Speaker 3>certification from verizon.</v>

265
00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:21.814
<v Speaker 3>Verizon has to push that update.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That whole introduction of the third </v>

266
00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:27.370
<v Speaker 3>party through the carrier is a huge pain</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the ass.</v>

267
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.400
<v Speaker 3>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of people who when they get</v>

268
00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:32.770
<v Speaker 3>a software update,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like actively avoid installing it,</v>

269
00:12:32.771 --> 00:12:35.350
<v Speaker 3>they just don't want change in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>

270
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:36.723
<v Speaker 3>So at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they put all that money and work </v>

271
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:40.384
<v Speaker 3>into making a software update and half </v>
<v Speaker 3>the people never install it or don't </v>

272
00:12:43.661 --> 00:12:44.494
<v Speaker 3>care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they just figured they might as </v>

273
00:12:45.401 --> 00:12:48.700
<v Speaker 3>well not put the money there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of teams are.</v>

274
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:52.120
<v Speaker 3>A lot of manufacturers just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>

275
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.040
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they support the phone for a year or two</v>

276
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:56.140
<v Speaker 3>and then that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for folks like you,</v>

277
00:12:56.141 --> 00:12:58.180
<v Speaker 3>for the power users,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's big.</v>

278
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.730
<v Speaker 3>That's a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having the latest and greatest.</v>

279
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.720
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

280
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:06.010
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm a fan of phones that keep</v>
<v Speaker 3>the skin light and update quickly,</v>

281
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.850
<v Speaker 3>which is what you'll find with pixel and</v>
<v Speaker 3>essential in oxygen license,</v>

282
00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.410
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's really it.</v>

283
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.840
<v Speaker 3>Like Samsung takes a long time to get to</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

284
00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:14.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

285
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.420
<v Speaker 3>Was Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As Samsung phones are,</v>

286
00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:18.940
<v Speaker 3>they definitely are not first to get new</v>
<v Speaker 3>software.</v>

287
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.610
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to do it quicker </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently what I've been reading,</v>

288
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:22.444
<v Speaker 3>but I guess there is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of issues always </v>

289
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.580
<v Speaker 3>bottleneck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now when,</v>

290
00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.453
<v Speaker 3>when you compare phones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like do you have a checklist of things </v>

291
00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:35.830
<v Speaker 3>that you have like on a computer or is </v>
<v Speaker 3>it just all off the top of your head?</v>

292
00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:36.664
<v Speaker 3>Like do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you have like a rating system that </v>

293
00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:40.690
<v Speaker 3>you use?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A personal rating system?</v>

294
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a rating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do have a,</v>

295
00:13:42.161 --> 00:13:42.994
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a checklist of things that I </v>

296
00:13:44.651 --> 00:13:48.820
<v Speaker 3>definitely pay attention to every time </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I must go through screens,</v>

297
00:13:48.821 --> 00:13:49.654
<v Speaker 3>displays and battery life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how good the camera is and things like </v>

298
00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:53.224
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'd never come to like a rating out </v>

299
00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:56.434
<v Speaker 3>of whatever.</v>

300
00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.310
<v Speaker 3>I used to do that a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I stopped because I just,</v>

301
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:01.390
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of like a neverending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll never,</v>

302
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.363
<v Speaker 3>you'll never get a 10 out of 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically because if you ever give </v>

303
00:14:05.471 --> 00:14:08.410
<v Speaker 3>something a 10 out of 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next one's going to be better.</v>

304
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.273
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how do you,</v>

305
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:10.833
<v Speaker 3>how do you put that on the scale?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just don't turn up for October </v>

306
00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:14.780
<v Speaker 3>2018,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess he,</v>

307
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.450
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like this is the best phone.</v>

308
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:18.430
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that say this is the best phone right</v>

309
00:14:18.431 --> 00:14:20.440
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then maybe that's not a 10 out of 10,</v>

310
00:14:20.441 --> 00:14:21.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's like the best you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>

311
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:26.130
<v Speaker 3>that line just keeps moving so I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>give things numbers but see for me those</v>

312
00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.013
<v Speaker 3>are the things you said that would be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pain in the ass that your music would </v>

313
00:14:29.531 --> 00:14:31.120
<v Speaker 3>shut off because you're using the </v>
<v Speaker 3>camera.</v>

314
00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:32.820
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a pain.</v>

315
00:14:32.821 --> 00:14:33.400
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

316
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.150
<v Speaker 3>that it's not a 10 out of 10 because of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the memory is a problem.</v>

317
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the notches bothering some people.</v>

318
00:14:39.611 --> 00:14:43.030
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't bother me anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just kind of blends in.</v>

319
00:14:43.031 --> 00:14:43.864
<v Speaker 3>I don't really look at the notch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So have you gone into the developer </v>

320
00:14:45.801 --> 00:14:48.100
<v Speaker 3>settings and fuck now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Removal of the notch.</v>

321
00:14:48.101 --> 00:14:49.900
<v Speaker 3>I tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that big a deal.</v>

322
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 3>It just makes a big black</v>

323
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.780
<v Speaker 1>bar over the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

324
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.660
<v Speaker 1>And you just lose the screen you paid </v>
<v Speaker 1>extra for that seems silly.</v>

325
00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind it on the iphone.</v>

326
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.890
<v Speaker 1>I mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly I use the excess Max.</v>

327
00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:05.210
<v Speaker 1>This one right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm so sour on apple because of what</v>

328
00:15:05.211 --> 00:15:07.140
<v Speaker 1>they did with the batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

329
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:12.080
<v Speaker 1>That was such a dirty thing to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everybody had always suspected.</v>

330
00:15:12.081 --> 00:15:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Like my friend Brian was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

331
00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:15.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you when the new phones come</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

332
00:15:15.471 --> 00:15:18.350
<v Speaker 1>your old phone starts moving slower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dad's a conspiracy.</v>

333
00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:20.780
<v Speaker 1>That's all horse shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your phone's just old bro.</v>

334
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.700
<v Speaker 1>But then when I found out that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

335
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:26.050
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you assholes and problem.</v>

336
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:26.923
<v Speaker 1>And the problem was the way they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell people like they could have just </v>

337
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.513
<v Speaker 1>avoided the whole whatever pr we want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you wanna call it by just </v>

338
00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:35.870
<v Speaker 1>telling people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

339
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:37.450
<v Speaker 1>this is what we do on your phones.</v>

340
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.293
<v Speaker 1>Getting older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to preserve either the CPU or </v>

341
00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:41.624
<v Speaker 1>the battery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we need to either voltage down the </v>

342
00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:46.220
<v Speaker 1>CPU or save your battery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick one and give us a choice.</v>

343
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:50.000
<v Speaker 1>They didn't tell us until people started</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspecting things and they had to make a</v>

344
00:15:50.001 --> 00:15:54.550
<v Speaker 1>statement and then another kind of dirty</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like hidden by it.</v>

345
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:55.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a trick to try to get you </v>

346
00:15:56.781 --> 00:15:57.710
<v Speaker 1>to buy new phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

347
00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.240
<v Speaker 1>There was no way they didn't think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

348
00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no chance that.</v>

349
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why else would they do it that way?</v>

350
00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:04.064
<v Speaker 1>Why would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't they just let the battery </v>

351
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:06.194
<v Speaker 1>be slower or they let the CPB slower and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best part is they give you the </v>

352
00:16:10.161 --> 00:16:12.620
<v Speaker 1>choice now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you never look for it,</v>

353
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:13.483
<v Speaker 1>you'll never find it and they definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>still default to saving your battery by </v>

354
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:18.230
<v Speaker 1>under clocking a chip.</v>

355
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:19.423
<v Speaker 1>So your phone will still slow down if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know where to find that </v>

356
00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:23.540
<v Speaker 1>option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as a new phones come out,</v>

357
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.230
<v Speaker 1>basically no motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just dirty.</v>

358
00:16:27.231 --> 00:16:28.064
<v Speaker 1>It seems pretty dirty yet because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that everybody always </v>

359
00:16:30.111 --> 00:16:31.140
<v Speaker 1>suspected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

360
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.053
<v Speaker 1>everybody was suspected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was some sort of engineered </v>

361
00:16:33.861 --> 00:16:36.380
<v Speaker 1>obsolescence and they're due.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing this on purpose to get you</v>

362
00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:38.600
<v Speaker 1>to keep buying the newest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>latest and greatest.</v>

363
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:43.900
<v Speaker 1>But I wanted to like go now apple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apple wouldn't do that.</v>

364
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your friends,</v>

365
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.153
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paint this picture that's really up </v>

366
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.250
<v Speaker 1>upright and like we want you to have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best experience as long as possible,</v>

367
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.410
<v Speaker 1>which involves not replacing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>battery,</v>

368
00:16:54.411 --> 00:16:58.200
<v Speaker 1>which means we'll just slow down your </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone just a little bit so that it's,</v>

369
00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:00.050
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it lasts longer in the battery.</v>

370
00:17:00.051 --> 00:17:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Can keep up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sense on paper,</v>

371
00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.130
<v Speaker 1>but on paper.</v>

372
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things about apple that</v>

373
00:17:06.201 --> 00:17:09.190
<v Speaker 1>I really like a really love the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the OSTP.</v>

374
00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.030
<v Speaker 1>I really love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

375
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:15.470
<v Speaker 1>it's just so much better than windows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their keyboard sucks so bad on their</v>

376
00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:17.360
<v Speaker 1>laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just all the laptop.</v>

377
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cliquey,</v>

378
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:20.990
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't feel good.</v>

379
00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:23.150
<v Speaker 1>There's the sketch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shallow travel.</v>

380
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.043
<v Speaker 1>There's all these issues with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I switched to a Lenovo and went with a </v>

381
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.850
<v Speaker 1>thinkpad just for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for standup.</v>

382
00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:32.240
<v Speaker 1>I have to write a lot and I found out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I wrote way slower,</v>

383
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.710
<v Speaker 1>like maybe 10 words per minute slower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

384
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:36.583
<v Speaker 1>it's a real issue because it's like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a lot more mistakes with those </v>

385
00:17:39.531 --> 00:17:42.140
<v Speaker 1>little shallow clicky things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

386
00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:44.330
<v Speaker 1>And with the Lenovo you have um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a much.</v>

387
00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.690
<v Speaker 1>You have much more travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much easier to touch type.</v>

388
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 1>It just feels better for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that bums</v>

389
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.150
<v Speaker 2>me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

390
00:17:51.151 --> 00:17:52.650
<v Speaker 2>why can't they get that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

391
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.513
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're making these things for creative </v>

392
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:55.890
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

393
00:17:55.891 --> 00:17:57.930
<v Speaker 2>That's your whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think different,</v>

394
00:17:57.931 --> 00:17:58.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

395
00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.330
<v Speaker 3>that's another thing I kinda got like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's again,</v>

396
00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:02.164
<v Speaker 3>like what apple tries to portray </v>
<v Speaker 3>themself as versus what you're actually </v>

397
00:18:04.841 --> 00:18:07.210
<v Speaker 3>experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you never listen to apple and you get</v>

398
00:18:07.211 --> 00:18:07.991
<v Speaker 3>the new laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

399
00:18:07.991 --> 00:18:09.910
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's keyboards worse sex,</v>

400
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.240
<v Speaker 3>why is this keyboard so shallow and </v>
<v Speaker 3>mushy a,</v>

401
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.700
<v Speaker 3>and then you're supposed to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>apple.</v>

402
00:18:15.701 --> 00:18:16.480
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

403
00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.150
<v Speaker 3>we made it quieter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We made it thinner.</v>

404
00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:21.430
<v Speaker 3>So the laptop's thinner now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

405
00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:22.383
<v Speaker 3>and they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll give you all these reasons why </v>

406
00:18:23.171 --> 00:18:24.910
<v Speaker 3>they did what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's supposed to go,</v>

407
00:18:24.911 --> 00:18:25.361
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

408
00:18:25.361 --> 00:18:26.320
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that actually makes sense.</v>

409
00:18:26.321 --> 00:18:27.154
<v Speaker 3>Maybe this is better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your experience often says the </v>

410
00:18:30.611 --> 00:18:31.444
<v Speaker 3>opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why people like to not listen </v>

411
00:18:32.681 --> 00:18:36.610
<v Speaker 3>to what apple says and just evaluate it </v>
<v Speaker 3>without listening to that.</v>

412
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.523
<v Speaker 2>Particularly for writers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for someone who writes and you write on </v>

413
00:18:41.131 --> 00:18:41.964
<v Speaker 2>a regular basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want a comfortable keyboard and you </v>

414
00:18:45.391 --> 00:18:45.691
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

415
00:18:45.691 --> 00:18:46.524
<v Speaker 2>I've constantly searched for the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>keyboard and right now I think it's </v>

416
00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:50.124
<v Speaker 2>probably the thinkpad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard great things about the </v>

417
00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:53.730
<v Speaker 2>razor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the razor pro,</v>

418
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.713
<v Speaker 2>which is the really large gaming one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a mechanical keyboard for the </v>

419
00:18:58.141 --> 00:19:02.130
<v Speaker 2>first time ever on a laptop and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be really good.</v>

420
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.630
<v Speaker 3>I have tried the blade and I have tried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm using right now is the surface,</v>

421
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.960
<v Speaker 3>the Microsoft surface laptop too and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's got a pretty good at keyboard.</v>

422
00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's travels a lot.</v>

423
00:19:11.491 --> 00:19:12.324
<v Speaker 3>It's backlit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the actual laptop part itself </v>

424
00:19:14.791 --> 00:19:17.010
<v Speaker 3>is not metal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got like Al Conterra like you might</v>

425
00:19:17.011 --> 00:19:17.844
<v Speaker 3>see inside a car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a soft touch on the laptop in my </v>

426
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:20.791
<v Speaker 3>backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

427
00:19:20.791 --> 00:19:24.460
<v Speaker 3>So I'll go grab that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of Falcon Tara.</v>

428
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like fake Suede.</v>

429
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:26.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what you seem to.</v>

430
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:30.150
<v Speaker 3>That's the craziest Shit I've ever heard</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my life now.</v>

431
00:19:30.151 --> 00:19:30.984
<v Speaker 3>Can Tara?</v>

432
00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the razor.</v>

433
00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:37.690
<v Speaker 2>Pull up that razer blade pro too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get a chance,</v>

434
00:19:37.691 --> 00:19:40.690
<v Speaker 2>we'll look at the surface first because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to go grab that.</v>

435
00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:41.793
<v Speaker 2>But the razer blade pro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also an enormous laptop and it has </v>

436
00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:46.421
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

437
00:19:46.421 --> 00:19:47.254
<v Speaker 2>that's it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The razer blade pro is so big and wide </v>

438
00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.080
<v Speaker 2>that it actually has the mouse on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>

439
00:19:53.081 --> 00:19:54.520
<v Speaker 2>like a track pad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>

440
00:19:54.521 --> 00:19:55.340
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

441
00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.540
<v Speaker 3>So that's the surface laptop too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

442
00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.340
<v Speaker 3>How weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a keyboard.</v>

443
00:20:01.341 --> 00:20:04.340
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a polished Alcantara Ooh,</v>

444
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.050
<v Speaker 3>that feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

445
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:09.290
<v Speaker 3>The question though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever you ecm material is like if I'm</v>

446
00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:12.260
<v Speaker 3>putting my palms on that all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long will that last?</v>

447
00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.273
<v Speaker 3>Will it start to thin out and look kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of worn after awhile or will it stay </v>

448
00:20:17.331 --> 00:20:18.560
<v Speaker 3>looking like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope it does.</v>

449
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:20.480
<v Speaker 3>And also the whole laptop is matte </v>
<v Speaker 3>black,</v>

450
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.670
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that looks dope,</v>

451
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.593
<v Speaker 3>but that's also usually a fingerprint </v>
<v Speaker 3>magnet we carry around like a matte </v>

452
00:20:27.201 --> 00:20:30.080
<v Speaker 3>black thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get like all this is grease on it or</v>

453
00:20:30.081 --> 00:20:32.450
<v Speaker 3>whatever carrying it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a challenge for that laptop,</v>

454
00:20:32.451 --> 00:20:33.830
<v Speaker 3>but I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

455
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.440
<v Speaker 3>the other thing about</v>

456
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:40.490
<v Speaker 2>the difference between the keyboard on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this versus the keyboard on,</v>

457
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.113
<v Speaker 2>what I have is I have the Lenovo Carbon </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] [inaudible] and what I </v>

458
00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 2>really like about this is that</v>

459
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.870
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not flat.</v>

460
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:53.440
<v Speaker 3>They have like a little bit of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a dip to them.</v>

461
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:57.160
<v Speaker 3>So your fingers sort of a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

462
00:20:57.161 --> 00:20:59.080
<v Speaker 3>there's a little bit of A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

463
00:20:59.081 --> 00:21:00.960
<v Speaker 3>that's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish more so like you kind of.</v>

464
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.950
<v Speaker 3>It's easier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

465
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.050
<v Speaker 3>It's easier to touch type when you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the spot.</v>

466
00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:07.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't people figure that out?</v>

467
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:08.880
<v Speaker 3>I think all of it is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get used to it like a,</v>

468
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:09.743
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a google tablet that came out </v>

469
00:21:11.051 --> 00:21:11.884
<v Speaker 3>recently with a $200 keyboard accessory </v>
<v Speaker 3>that has circular quays and slightly </v>

470
00:21:17.471 --> 00:21:18.304
<v Speaker 3>concave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like typing on it was fine and like </v>

471
00:21:21.041 --> 00:21:21.940
<v Speaker 3>they claim like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

472
00:21:21.941 --> 00:21:22.774
<v Speaker 3>once you get used to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the surface area of the key being </v>

473
00:21:24.521 --> 00:21:27.520
<v Speaker 3>circular makes it easier to type faster </v>
<v Speaker 3>after awhile.</v>

474
00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.350
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I buy that yet,</v>

475
00:21:29.351 --> 00:21:31.180
<v Speaker 3>but maybe if you were a secretary and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you really,</v>

476
00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.070
<v Speaker 3>you're really used to the circular.</v>

477
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.960
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a typewriter when you just</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at it.</v>

478
00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:39.700
<v Speaker 3>We want to pull that thing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be the google.</v>

479
00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:41.890
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they call it?</v>

480
00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:44.710
<v Speaker 3>Something Tab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It came out like the same time.</v>

481
00:21:44.711 --> 00:21:46.900
<v Speaker 3>The pixel three and they're naming is </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird with them,</v>

482
00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.680
<v Speaker 3>but it has a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

483
00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.090
<v Speaker 3>basically a surface like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like $200 keyboard,</v>

484
00:21:52.091 --> 00:21:52.924
<v Speaker 3>magnet accessory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can prop it up at any angle and it </v>

485
00:21:55.001 --> 00:21:57.850
<v Speaker 3>goes from a tablet to a laptop with this</v>
<v Speaker 3>keyboard dock.</v>

486
00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.440
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it's a,</v>

487
00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.570
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the circular quay is.</v>

488
00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:05.680
<v Speaker 3>I found weird that Alcan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tara on the hand rest feels amazing.</v>

489
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:07.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really nice.</v>

490
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to get used to that.</v>

491
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:09.843
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

492
00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.530
<v Speaker 3>I've been using a Mac book pro for so </v>
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

493
00:22:11.531 --> 00:22:12.364
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the contrast is like I was really used </v>

494
00:22:14.441 --> 00:22:17.690
<v Speaker 3>to like having metal and metal feels </v>
<v Speaker 3>premium and good.</v>

495
00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's not going to wear down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

496
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:21.610
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like this a lot.</v>

497
00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what metal doesn't feel good?</v>

498
00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.530
<v Speaker 3>Those on your hands when you're sitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>on it for a long time?</v>

499
00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.800
<v Speaker 3>Just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

500
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:29.643
<v Speaker 3>they kinda got where?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they wrap the material around to </v>

501
00:22:32.501 --> 00:22:34.150
<v Speaker 3>the sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mac Book Pros.</v>

502
00:22:34.151 --> 00:22:36.660
<v Speaker 3>Literally sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cut to kind of.</v>

503
00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:38.110
<v Speaker 3>You put your hands on the edge for too </v>
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

504
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.620
<v Speaker 3>When Nova was carbon fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>

505
00:22:40.621 --> 00:22:43.120
<v Speaker 3>So this whole thing is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not cheap though.</v>

506
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:44.103
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not cheap in comparison to a Mac </v>

507
00:22:47.021 --> 00:22:48.430
<v Speaker 3>laptop though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

508
00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:50.910
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's way more options.</v>

509
00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.950
<v Speaker 3>That's the other thing with a Mac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get like a 13 inch,</v>

510
00:22:53.951 --> 00:22:54.784
<v Speaker 3>you get a 15 inch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta touch bar or you get nothing </v>

511
00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.080
<v Speaker 3>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's a matter of Jamie Pixel slate?</v>

512
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.790
<v Speaker 3>I just had it there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The picture changed.</v>

513
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.280
<v Speaker 3>Oh these motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it's called though.</v>

514
00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.830
<v Speaker 3>Pixel sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh there it is now.</v>

515
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.180
<v Speaker 3>So those are the key.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Circular quays and that sort of connects</v>

516
00:23:10.181 --> 00:23:11.014
<v Speaker 3>to the tablet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great accessory like the magnet </v>

517
00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:15.274
<v Speaker 3>on the back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I don't know if you've seen a </v>

518
00:23:15.851 --> 00:23:18.120
<v Speaker 3>surface tablet with the little </v>
<v Speaker 3>kickstand.</v>

519
00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.980
<v Speaker 3>You kind of have like a couple notches </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you can adjust it.</v>

520
00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.170
<v Speaker 3>And I think the new version has infinite</v>
<v Speaker 3>adjustment,</v>

521
00:23:23.171 --> 00:23:25.450
<v Speaker 3>but this is the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a magnet in the back of the</v>

522
00:23:25.451 --> 00:23:26.284
<v Speaker 3>surface or the pixel slate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've lets you adjust the tablet to any </v>

523
00:23:31.091 --> 00:23:32.770
<v Speaker 3>angle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch videos type.</v>

524
00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.610
<v Speaker 3>Apple's the only company that makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>keyboards that I know that had it better</v>

525
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
<v Speaker 3>in like 2012 than they do in 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get a 2012 macbook you.</v>

526
00:23:42.311 --> 00:23:43.480
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is kind of better.</v>

527
00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.130
<v Speaker 3>There's more travel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

528
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.600
<v Speaker 3>You might think it's like an upgrade if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they want backwards.</v>

529
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:48.463
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

530
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:48.890
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

531
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:49.740
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goofy.</v>

532
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.850
<v Speaker 3>Kind of agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how they did that.</v>

533
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:53.893
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

534
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Well there's so design oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everything looks stellar.</v>

535
00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.450
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apple has been a,</v>

536
00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:05.800
<v Speaker 3>not a victim of their own desire to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>great design,</v>

537
00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:07.053
<v Speaker 3>but they often very often make </v>
<v Speaker 3>compromises sometimes to the detriment </v>

538
00:24:10.901 --> 00:24:13.810
<v Speaker 3>of how good a product can be to make it </v>
<v Speaker 3>look better.</v>

539
00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:18.130
<v Speaker 3>Classic example was the Mac pro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the little circular trashcan looking Mac</v>

540
00:24:18.131 --> 00:24:19.220
<v Speaker 3>pro that came out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

541
00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:23.320
<v Speaker 3>he 12 or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They kept.</v>

542
00:24:23.321 --> 00:24:27.010
<v Speaker 3>They made all these promises.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this sleek modern workstation,</v>

543
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:31.060
<v Speaker 3>it's going to have the xeon chips and </v>
<v Speaker 3>big gps and I loved it,</v>

544
00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:32.223
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it only had one fan for a six slash </v>

545
00:24:34.151 --> 00:24:34.984
<v Speaker 3>$7,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>workstation and they constantly </v>

546
00:24:37.601 --> 00:24:42.010
<v Speaker 3>overheated and would throttle and </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually it was a nightmare for them.</v>

547
00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:42.913
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that something that was going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the latest laptops with the latest </v>

548
00:24:45.891 --> 00:24:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Mac book pro?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

549
00:24:46.791 --> 00:24:47.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing,</v>

550
00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.850
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made the,</v>

551
00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.450
<v Speaker 1>the I nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the core I nine.</v>

552
00:24:50.451 --> 00:24:50.960
<v Speaker 1>They put in this</v>

553
00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.050
<v Speaker 3>super thin laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They made this laptop so finn and I kept</v>

554
00:24:54.051 --> 00:24:56.030
<v Speaker 3>the fan speed so low because it's got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be quiet.</v>

555
00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:58.483
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just throttled the CPU down so it </v>

556
00:25:00.881 --> 00:25:03.260
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't get so hot that they had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>kick up the fans that high.</v>

557
00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.370
<v Speaker 1>So the actual performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the CPU is more powerful,</v>

558
00:25:06.371 --> 00:25:08.710
<v Speaker 1>was not as good as the last model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

559
00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Which was to make it look good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

560
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:14.480
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple's been a victim of their own,</v>

561
00:25:14.481 --> 00:25:15.314
<v Speaker 1>like desire to make things so beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they got fucked by Walway </v>

562
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:20.703
<v Speaker 1>because while we came along with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mate book and the mate book pro is </v>

563
00:25:24.401 --> 00:25:27.760
<v Speaker 1>really a better version of the Mac book </v>
<v Speaker 1>and into it.</v>

564
00:25:27.761 --> 00:25:29.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he nailed it.</v>

565
00:25:29.441 --> 00:25:34.240
<v Speaker 1>There's no bezels the way that Webcam </v>
<v Speaker 1>pops up from the found interesting.</v>

566
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it angles up your </v>
<v Speaker 1>nostril.</v>

567
00:25:36.401 --> 00:25:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like on</v>

568
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.740
<v Speaker 3>the table level of wherever you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting and looking up at you.</v>

569
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.180
<v Speaker 3>That's very odd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

570
00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:43.043
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of great things about </v>

571
00:25:43.621 --> 00:25:44.150
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

572
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:47.300
<v Speaker 1>pull that thing up mate book pro while </v>
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>

573
00:25:47.301 --> 00:25:49.340
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile it's probably spying on </v>
<v Speaker 1>you all day long.</v>

574
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Sending information to the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

575
00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always reputations and also hot.</v>

576
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Found some spy chip and their cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

577
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:59.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about the uh,</v>

578
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.430
<v Speaker 3>well there's a couple things that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened with,</v>

579
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.473
<v Speaker 3>with chips in hardware.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's another thing about a Bloomberg </v>

580
00:26:06.651 --> 00:26:08.000
<v Speaker 3>report.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that?</v>

581
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.033
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a the chips that came from all </v>

582
00:26:11.571 --> 00:26:12.404
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

583
00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:13.243
<v Speaker 3>this server company or this company that</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes the chips that sells to all these </v>

584
00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:17.174
<v Speaker 3>big companies like apple and and major </v>
<v Speaker 3>major companies and now everyone's </v>

585
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:22.670
<v Speaker 3>compromised and after was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>

586
00:26:22.671 --> 00:26:24.290
<v Speaker 3>not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely not true.</v>

587
00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:25.880
<v Speaker 3>Don't say the chorus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not us.</v>

588
00:26:25.881 --> 00:26:26.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No 100 percent.</v>

589
00:26:26.811 --> 00:26:28.490
<v Speaker 3>Not Us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

590
00:26:28.491 --> 00:26:30.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a really weird story.</v>

591
00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.630
<v Speaker 3>Look at this map.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Book blue.</v>

592
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.160
<v Speaker 3>The bezels</v>

593
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:35.443
<v Speaker 1>almost nonexistent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your challenge or just website if </v>

594
00:26:38.121 --> 00:26:38.954
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're just laptop rather than if </v>

595
00:26:39.821 --> 00:26:44.340
<v Speaker 1>you're wowway and you make that now you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to convince people to switch from</v>

596
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.233
<v Speaker 3>the Mac books that they love to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just on looks alone they could </v>

597
00:26:48.721 --> 00:26:49.554
<v Speaker 3>probably do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then there's all the other features </v>

598
00:26:51.001 --> 00:26:53.400
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it doesn't run Mac os 10.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Do I have a message?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

600
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.350
<v Speaker 3>Do I have all these other things that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>like about my Mac?</v>

601
00:26:58.351 --> 00:27:00.820
<v Speaker 3>This huge touchpad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

602
00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:05.920
<v Speaker 3>it does have a huge touchpad yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I say to this day still,</v>

603
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:09.770
<v Speaker 3>apple has the best laptop touch pad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The multitouch stuff with a battery life</v>

604
00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:11.100
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be excellent as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

605
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.200
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How have I given that chart?</v>

606
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.660
<v Speaker 3>That chart was perfect because that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like all these x's for that.</v>

607
00:27:15.661 --> 00:27:16.860
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have great design.</v>

608
00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:17.723
<v Speaker 3>We have better ports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You only have USBC on a little Mac book </v>

609
00:27:19.681 --> 00:27:20.980
<v Speaker 3>pro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have full size USB,</v>

610
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.520
<v Speaker 3>we have all this stuff will give audio </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the Mac book pro.</v>

611
00:27:23.521 --> 00:27:24.690
<v Speaker 3>It's got bigger speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

612
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.550
<v Speaker 3>but we have a better battery life.</v>

613
00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:27.383
<v Speaker 3>We have all this better lower price,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the steps and you still have to </v>

614
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.840
<v Speaker 3>reconcile with what people love about </v>
<v Speaker 3>their macbook pros,</v>

615
00:27:33.841 --> 00:27:36.600
<v Speaker 3>which is Mac is 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's that,</v>

616
00:27:36.601 --> 00:27:40.470
<v Speaker 3>but there's also people love having an </v>
<v Speaker 3>apple product net too.</v>

617
00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:41.850
<v Speaker 3>They do love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

618
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:42.923
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could put an apple logo and a </v>

619
00:27:44.461 --> 00:27:47.970
<v Speaker 3>wowway I wonder how many make itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably a little bit of the shit out of</v>

620
00:27:47.971 --> 00:27:48.580
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

621
00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:49.413
<v Speaker 3>Well you know some comic has a joke </v>
<v Speaker 3>about texting a girl and the text </v>

622
00:27:52.681 --> 00:27:54.750
<v Speaker 3>message comes back and green and go damn</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

623
00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:58.350
<v Speaker 3>For true felt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have.</v>

624
00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:03.720
<v Speaker 3>People want I message like if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're messaging someone and you find</v>

625
00:28:03.721 --> 00:28:07.530
<v Speaker 3>out it won't send an imessage will only </v>
<v Speaker 3>send a text message like a Weirdo.</v>

626
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:08.850
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a flip phone,</v>

627
00:28:08.851 --> 00:28:11.130
<v Speaker 3>like so weird eighth person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been on the other side of that,</v>

628
00:28:11.131 --> 00:28:12.580
<v Speaker 3>like I carry an iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>

629
00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:14.970
<v Speaker 3>I text people on my android phone so </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never been on the uh,</v>

630
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.070
<v Speaker 3>judging side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

631
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.070
<v Speaker 3>I wonder about that everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like really what does it matter?</v>

632
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:24.510
<v Speaker 3>Like I text you with a green bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which apple decided,</v>

633
00:28:24.511 --> 00:28:25.344
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to differentiate I message versus text </v>

634
00:28:27.391 --> 00:28:28.440
<v Speaker 3>message,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is hilarious.</v>

635
00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:30.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

636
00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:31.980
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it matter?</v>

637
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:34.580
<v Speaker 3>Does look better it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they decided to.</v>

638
00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:37.770
<v Speaker 3>They I'm sure in a software update they </v>
<v Speaker 3>tweaked that green to make it look extra</v>

639
00:28:37.771 --> 00:28:40.440
<v Speaker 3>harsh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They figured out,</v>

640
00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:43.260
<v Speaker 3>they figured out with pool tables a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>time ago.</v>

641
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.680
<v Speaker 3>Like pool tables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cloth generally is green,</v>

642
00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:47.573
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when they started playing in </v>

643
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:49.493
<v Speaker 3>professional tournament's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they realized that blue cloth is </v>

644
00:28:53.071 --> 00:28:55.410
<v Speaker 3>actually easier on the eyes and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could differentiate,</v>

645
00:28:55.470 --> 00:29:00.470
<v Speaker 3>differentiate the edges better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of really high end professional</v>

646
00:29:00.901 --> 00:29:03.300
<v Speaker 3>matches are played on blue cloth now.</v>

647
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:06.450
<v Speaker 3>It's like a light blue sky blue cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

648
00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.433
<v Speaker 3>I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's I guess because of the way </v>

649
00:29:08.941 --> 00:29:09.774
<v Speaker 3>your eyes work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like something about primary colors and </v>

650
00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:14.370
<v Speaker 3>the cones and you're more contrast and </v>
<v Speaker 3>suited to blue.</v>

651
00:29:14.371 --> 00:29:16.480
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about the way.</v>

652
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.333
<v Speaker 3>The way white contrast with green is not</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite as pleasing as white contrasting </v>

653
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:22.403
<v Speaker 3>with blue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it could be the apple fucking with </v>

654
00:29:24.691 --> 00:29:27.330
<v Speaker 3>you with the green to give you some </v>
<v Speaker 3>vomit.</v>

655
00:29:27.331 --> 00:29:29.580
<v Speaker 3>Green.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Making some brand color next year.</v>

656
00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:32.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The color of the APP is green.</v>

657
00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:33.960
<v Speaker 3>What would they make it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blue.</v>

658
00:29:33.961 --> 00:29:34.794
<v Speaker 3>I messaged the APP.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That button you press to open it as </v>

659
00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:37.660
<v Speaker 3>green.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a green though.</v>

660
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.540
<v Speaker 3>Why not make it blue?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really true.</v>

661
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:40.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>

662
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 3>That's very good point.</v>

663
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did they do that?</v>

664
00:29:45.521 --> 00:29:46.354
<v Speaker 1>It's still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would it be green when you're </v>

665
00:29:47.681 --> 00:29:49.630
<v Speaker 1>sending blue messages?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apple.</v>

666
00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.360
<v Speaker 1>We'd dorks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve jobs is dead.</v>

667
00:29:52.361 --> 00:29:53.950
<v Speaker 1>You guys are fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what you're doing.</v>

668
00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:57.430
<v Speaker 1>But the mate book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than that,</v>

669
00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:58.413
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to have a better keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to have a keyboard that's </v>

670
00:30:00.551 --> 00:30:04.780
<v Speaker 1>probably similar to that surface book </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's supposed to have better battery</v>

671
00:30:04.781 --> 00:30:06.060
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bacillus,</v>

672
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:06.831
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bezel.</v>

673
00:30:06.831 --> 00:30:08.320
<v Speaker 1>This touch screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>touch screen,</v>

674
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:11.380
<v Speaker 1>higher resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to deal with windows 10,</v>

675
00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:13.570
<v Speaker 1>which is a little bit of a pain in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>

676
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.750
<v Speaker 1>I gotTa admit it's like the updates are </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost daily.</v>

677
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:17.763
<v Speaker 1>There's something going on with firmware</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something going on with this or that </v>

678
00:30:20.861 --> 00:30:21.694
<v Speaker 1>or I've gotten used to it mostly though </v>
<v Speaker 1>because most of what I do on my laptop </v>

679
00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:26.103
<v Speaker 1>is pretty web based,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm just living in chrome or safari </v>

680
00:30:28.481 --> 00:30:29.920
<v Speaker 1>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not a big deal.</v>

681
00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.753
<v Speaker 1>But then yet once I have to go out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna go in light room and do some </v>

682
00:30:33.431 --> 00:30:37.150
<v Speaker 1>photo work and then like suddenly I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>digging through files and I'm in windows</v>

683
00:30:37.151 --> 00:30:37.984
<v Speaker 1>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you start to feel like you're </v>

684
00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:40.570
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

685
00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:42.780
<v Speaker 1>When you first time you have to update a</v>
<v Speaker 1>driver.</v>

686
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 96.</v>

687
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:47.510
<v Speaker 1>The fuck is going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm updating drivers.</v>

688
00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:51.880
<v Speaker 1>I try to get away that it's just their </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes though.</v>

689
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Like it's way better than it was five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

690
00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:57.100
<v Speaker 1>five years ago you would look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>windows,</v>

691
00:30:57.101 --> 00:30:59.380
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is some archaic.</v>

692
00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Pixilated came from Vista to Windows </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven to windows,</v>

693
00:31:04.631 --> 00:31:05.464
<v Speaker 1>10 vista was kind of that nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they kinda have worked upwards </v>

694
00:31:08.581 --> 00:31:09.414
<v Speaker 1>since I started with windows 95.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to make my own computers back in </v>

695
00:31:12.581 --> 00:31:13.414
<v Speaker 1>my hardcore video gaming days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice to go to fry's electronics and get </v>

696
00:31:17.261 --> 00:31:19.750
<v Speaker 1>motherboards and box and fans.</v>

697
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:24.750
<v Speaker 1>And I started that online so I never </v>
<v Speaker 1>went to a physical computer store to buy</v>

698
00:31:25.211 --> 00:31:26.044
<v Speaker 1>parts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would have to do the whole like </v>

699
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:32.050
<v Speaker 1>cross cross referencing what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>compatible with what online and then put</v>

700
00:31:32.051 --> 00:31:32.884
<v Speaker 1>together a whole list and then just buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and then nine boxes show up and like </v>

701
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:37.550
<v Speaker 1>hopefully they all work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

702
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:39.010
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the same experience.</v>

703
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:40.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sli,</v>

704
00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:45.540
<v Speaker 1>video cards and connecting them with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that cable and mess up in Brooklyn.</v>

705
00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

706
00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:47.773
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But fixing it makes you feel like you </v>

707
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:50.223
<v Speaker 1>did something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's something going on when </v>

708
00:31:51.491 --> 00:31:52.324
<v Speaker 1>you're like the jumpers for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherboard and you're moving stuff </v>

709
00:31:55.271 --> 00:31:57.970
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was cool.</v>

710
00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:58.943
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once you actually gone online </v>

711
00:32:00.071 --> 00:32:02.180
<v Speaker 1>with a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you made yourself like this.</v>

712
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:03.423
<v Speaker 1>Something about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I met her when you used to be able </v>

713
00:32:05.351 --> 00:32:06.340
<v Speaker 1>to do that with apple.</v>

714
00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.520
<v Speaker 1>You used to be able to buy clones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

715
00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I way back in the day,</v>

716
00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:16.090
<v Speaker 1>still in high school I had a Dell xps </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 7:30,</v>

717
00:32:16.091 --> 00:32:19.900
<v Speaker 1>I think it was called is huge desktop </v>
<v Speaker 1>where again you could like take this cpu</v>

718
00:32:19.901 --> 00:32:22.030
<v Speaker 1>cooler out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put a new one and it was modular fully.</v>

719
00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.820
<v Speaker 1>And then apple also made this huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>desktop,</v>

720
00:32:24.821 --> 00:32:27.940
<v Speaker 1>this power mac or I don't know what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was called at the time,</v>

721
00:32:27.941 --> 00:32:30.840
<v Speaker 1>but it was again massive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could take the graphics card out,</v>

722
00:32:30.841 --> 00:32:32.950
<v Speaker 1>put a new one in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take the ram out,</v>

723
00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:34.690
<v Speaker 1>take the CPU out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was like this,</v>

724
00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:35.803
<v Speaker 1>this weird system where like they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>on like decks and you had to like take </v>

725
00:32:39.621 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 1>this big</v>

726
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:43.340
<v Speaker 3>metal slot out and then do the Cpu there</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then put it back in.</v>

727
00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:47.570
<v Speaker 3>It was really satisfying to like change </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hardware and like yeah I did that.</v>

728
00:32:47.571 --> 00:32:49.520
<v Speaker 3>And they put it up and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly right.</v>

729
00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:51.230
<v Speaker 3>Now it's got eight gigs around the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>

730
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.220
<v Speaker 3>Especially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

731
00:32:52.221 --> 00:32:56.160
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a man thing to men like </v>
<v Speaker 3>changing carburetor,</v>

732
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:58.010
<v Speaker 3>mechanical field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

733
00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:59.860
<v Speaker 3>That's probably a lot to do with it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

734
00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:00.763
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One generation after that because that </v>

735
00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:08.240
<v Speaker 3>whole that it had like basically like </v>
<v Speaker 3>elevator levels to it,</v>

736
00:33:08.241 --> 00:33:09.074
<v Speaker 3>like the top level and on the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 3>level and on the hard drives and the </v>

737
00:33:11.061 --> 00:33:12.830
<v Speaker 3>power supply and the top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all that stuff.</v>

738
00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:14.173
<v Speaker 3>And he can mess with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go over someone's house and they </v>

739
00:33:15.801 --> 00:33:18.140
<v Speaker 3>have that now you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is wrong with you?</v>

740
00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:19.003
<v Speaker 3>But that's the thing about that was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most accessible modular desktop apple </v>

741
00:33:23.871 --> 00:33:25.010
<v Speaker 3>ever ever made.</v>

742
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.500
<v Speaker 3>And now they're making this promise </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

743
00:33:27.501 --> 00:33:28.334
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

744
00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.680
<v Speaker 3>we listened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know that little trash can.</v>

745
00:33:30.681 --> 00:33:34.160
<v Speaker 3>Mac Pro was not good thermally or design</v>
<v Speaker 3>wise for anyone.</v>

746
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.790
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to make a modular </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional desktop Mac pro.</v>

747
00:33:37.791 --> 00:33:38.624
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they said and it's going to </v>

748
00:33:40.671 --> 00:33:43.550
<v Speaker 3>be next year sometime and I keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>picturing that.</v>

749
00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:44.743
<v Speaker 3>I picture them going back to the roots </v>
<v Speaker 3>of like a real bonafide desktop because </v>

750
00:33:48.081 --> 00:33:48.914
<v Speaker 3>right now the most powerful imac or Mac </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get is the imac pro and you </v>

751
00:33:52.881 --> 00:33:55.130
<v Speaker 3>can't even update the ram and the Imac </v>
<v Speaker 3>pro.</v>

752
00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.960
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't update anything about Macra.</v>

753
00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.060
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

754
00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:00.470
<v Speaker 3>What you buys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you get,</v>

755
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.140
<v Speaker 3>if you buy a $7,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>imac pro,</v>

756
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:04.303
<v Speaker 3>you will have that spec forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apple doesn't want you opening anything </v>

757
00:34:08.391 --> 00:34:09.830
<v Speaker 3>in that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when they say,</v>

758
00:34:09.831 --> 00:34:10.664
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to make a modular updatable </v>

759
00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:15.830
<v Speaker 3>real well-designed apple desktop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

760
00:34:15.831 --> 00:34:18.230
<v Speaker 3>I really hope they're doing that.</v>

761
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:20.240
<v Speaker 3>Like exactly because that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

762
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:24.590
<v Speaker 3>Do they have regular towers anymore or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No?</v>

763
00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.320
<v Speaker 3>Everything's an Imac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had that,</v>

764
00:34:26.321 --> 00:34:29.750
<v Speaker 3>that little trashcan and then the Mac </v>
<v Speaker 3>mini,</v>

765
00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:32.840
<v Speaker 3>which is the longest since they've ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>updated it.</v>

766
00:34:32.841 --> 00:34:34.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping they update it at the event </v>
<v Speaker 3>this month,</v>

767
00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:35.624
<v Speaker 3>but the Mac mini is the only other tower</v>
<v Speaker 3>they made and that Scott Laptop </v>

768
00:34:38.661 --> 00:34:42.050
<v Speaker 3>internals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so not really a true desktop,</v>

769
00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:42.903
<v Speaker 3>so everything is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that just because of technology's </v>

770
00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:45.853
<v Speaker 3>advanced to the point where you can kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of fit everything in the big screen of </v>

771
00:34:48.921 --> 00:34:50.810
<v Speaker 3>an Imac basically?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

772
00:34:50.811 --> 00:34:54.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean the Imac,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have those desktop internals in it,</v>

773
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.510
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

774
00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:57.200
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

775
00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.740
<v Speaker 3>you're still going to be restrained by </v>
<v Speaker 3>like how closed off that spaces,</v>

776
00:35:00.741 --> 00:35:03.190
<v Speaker 3>how many fans I can fit in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

777
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:06.710
<v Speaker 3>so if they really want to do like a true</v>
<v Speaker 3>desktop,</v>

778
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.560
<v Speaker 3>they got to open it up and make it huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not very like apple.</v>

779
00:35:10.561 --> 00:35:11.840
<v Speaker 3>So it's gonna be interesting to see what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do.</v>

780
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.393
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

781
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:14.390
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is your,</v>

782
00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.000
<v Speaker 3>what year is your laptop over there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an older one,</v>

783
00:35:17.001 --> 00:35:17.834
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the last one before they added the </v>

784
00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:22.820
<v Speaker 3>track bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last one that glows 20 slash 15.</v>

785
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.400
<v Speaker 3>Does yours have a dip at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To the keys?</v>

786
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:28.820
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very small,</v>

787
00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:29.683
<v Speaker 3>but that's all you need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you need is a very small dip about </v>

788
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:34.130
<v Speaker 3>flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as they went with flat,</v>

789
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:38.720
<v Speaker 3>they fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a company that refurbishes</v>

790
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:41.970
<v Speaker 2>17 inch Mac books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big one,</v>

791
00:35:41.971 --> 00:35:46.580
<v Speaker 2>the Mac daddy these a laptop would </v>
<v Speaker 2>refurbish it and put a,</v>

792
00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:49.120
<v Speaker 2>like a modern CPU in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put a,</v>

793
00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:51.590
<v Speaker 2>a big um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>SSD drive,</v>

794
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:54.180
<v Speaker 2>a one terabyte or two terabyte SSD </v>
<v Speaker 2>drive.</v>

795
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:57.840
<v Speaker 2>So you deal with the solid state drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's instantly fires up.</v>

796
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Much more ram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Much more everything.</v>

797
00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.153
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they call a desktop </v>

798
00:36:01.761 --> 00:36:03.350
<v Speaker 3>replacement laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

799
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:05.270
<v Speaker 3>I was into that for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was like one of my.</v>

800
00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:08.910
<v Speaker 3>That's actually how I started my channel</v>
<v Speaker 3>was I bought a 17 inch laptop now.</v>

801
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:09.783
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to figure out which one </v>
<v Speaker 3>strikes the balance of where I want to </v>

802
00:36:11.811 --> 00:36:12.644
<v Speaker 3>be with taking it off the dock once in </v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile and walking around the house </v>

803
00:36:15.501 --> 00:36:16.334
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like planting it back here and it's </v>

804
00:36:17.811 --> 00:36:19.400
<v Speaker 3>my desktop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a 17 inch screen.</v>

805
00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.330
<v Speaker 3>That was where I started with HP.</v>

806
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:26.490
<v Speaker 2>If you're at the airport and you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a canceled flight,</v>

807
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.640
<v Speaker 2>you could get a workout in just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifting.</v>

808
00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:32.940
<v Speaker 2>Nothing will probably have you go side </v>
<v Speaker 2>to side.</v>

809
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.800
<v Speaker 3>That's the other thing that I was on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>plane with this.</v>

810
00:36:34.801 --> 00:36:38.010
<v Speaker 3>This is like a 12 inch screen and every </v>
<v Speaker 3>time the guy in front of me lean back,</v>

811
00:36:38.011 --> 00:36:41.040
<v Speaker 3>he just smacked my laptop to like move </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

812
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:42.143
<v Speaker 3>You really need like a 12 inch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nine inch screen probably to get away </v>

813
00:36:44.761 --> 00:36:46.530
<v Speaker 3>with what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 12 inches.</v>

814
00:36:46.531 --> 00:36:48.900
<v Speaker 3>Can you flip that around as a 12 or 13 </v>
<v Speaker 3>inch screen?</v>

815
00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:51.510
<v Speaker 3>But it's like a taller three two aspect </v>
<v Speaker 3>ratio.</v>

816
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:55.650
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the smaller,</v>

817
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:56.543
<v Speaker 3>a 16 by nine screen would be underneath </v>
<v Speaker 3>like where that guy was hitting my </v>

818
00:36:58.711 --> 00:37:00.810
<v Speaker 3>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So most of the bezels seems like it's on</v>

819
00:37:00.811 --> 00:37:02.180
<v Speaker 3>the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

820
00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.400
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

821
00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:04.980
<v Speaker 3>So your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your chat at the bottom here.</v>

822
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty good size basil,</v>

823
00:37:07.021 --> 00:37:10.550
<v Speaker 3>but like I'm still hoping for like </v>
<v Speaker 3>vesselis laptops.</v>

824
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:11.583
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever thought about going with </v>

825
00:37:12.581 --> 00:37:13.414
<v Speaker 3>the Walway?</v>

826
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:15.120
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really.</v>

827
00:37:15.121 --> 00:37:19.380
<v Speaker 3>Mostly because I switched laptops so </v>
<v Speaker 3>infrequently that I was just like,</v>

828
00:37:19.381 --> 00:37:21.300
<v Speaker 3>if it's not massively better than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mac book pro,</v>

829
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.193
<v Speaker 3>I don't really feel the need to switch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This came on my radar in the last like </v>

830
00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:30.830
<v Speaker 3>two weeks and I decided to try it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been like worth the shot.</v>

831
00:37:31.411 --> 00:37:34.110
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm really into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably going to switch back to the</v>

832
00:37:34.111 --> 00:37:34.944
<v Speaker 3>Mac book pro in a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once I started to run up against things </v>

833
00:37:37.861 --> 00:37:39.930
<v Speaker 3>like this doesn't have USBC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is sad.</v>

834
00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:41.683
<v Speaker 3>That's weird though that eventually </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to bite me and when I do </v>

835
00:37:43.411 --> 00:37:45.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to want to switch back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's got</v>

836
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:46.970
<v Speaker 2>a new Microsoft laptop that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

837
00:37:46.971 --> 00:37:48.650
<v Speaker 2>USBC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't really make a lot of sense.</v>

838
00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.840
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't at all why they do that.</v>

839
00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:52.600
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to ask.</v>

840
00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.110
<v Speaker 3>It's a great laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have the charger.</v>

841
00:37:56.111 --> 00:37:56.944
<v Speaker 3>Is this weird like it's not like magsafe</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's this slot charger thing where </v>

842
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:01.853
<v Speaker 3>it like goes in and out easily but also </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have a card reader also doesn't </v>

843
00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:09.370
<v Speaker 3>have like a lot of things that I kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>hoped to laptop would have.</v>

844
00:38:09.371 --> 00:38:10.660
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

845
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:15.020
<v Speaker 2>This thing is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This thing is regular USB USBC.</v>

846
00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:20.480
<v Speaker 3>This has one size Usb port headphone </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jack and what it looks like</v>

847
00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:21.423
<v Speaker 2>just as Htmi bias does not have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of this thing and then </v>

848
00:38:25.171 --> 00:38:26.004
<v Speaker 2>they make a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make a 15 inch version of it as </v>

849
00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:28.830
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the,</v>

850
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:29.703
<v Speaker 2>I guess</v>

851
00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:33.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how big that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do you do?</v>

852
00:38:33.891 --> 00:38:36.370
<v Speaker 3>Like mostly on the laptop because I know</v>
<v Speaker 3>he writing,</v>

853
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:39.640
<v Speaker 3>writing and then getting online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just online bullshit.</v>

854
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.470
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no software really.</v>

855
00:38:41.471 --> 00:38:44.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really running anything other </v>
<v Speaker 3>than writing programs.</v>

856
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:46.210
<v Speaker 3>Microsoft word which is native,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

857
00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:47.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

858
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:50.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could probably get away with </v>
<v Speaker 3>any number of laps,</v>

859
00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:51.553
<v Speaker 3>similar laptops just like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at that point you basically pick the </v>

860
00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:56.860
<v Speaker 3>design you like best and if it has the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ports you need then you're good.</v>

861
00:38:57.370 --> 00:39:00.820
<v Speaker 3>But if you find yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if I'm a I like to do photo editing</v>

862
00:39:00.821 --> 00:39:04.030
<v Speaker 3>a lot and so basically I have to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>some way to read memory cards.</v>

863
00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:05.253
<v Speaker 3>Mac book pro doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just has a lot of USBC ports so I </v>

864
00:39:07.421 --> 00:39:10.990
<v Speaker 3>just have that dongle plugged into Usb </v>
<v Speaker 3>card reader and then I'm good.</v>

865
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.063
<v Speaker 3>This one I'll have to get a USB card </v>
<v Speaker 3>reader also for it and then get light </v>

866
00:39:15.021 --> 00:39:15.854
<v Speaker 3>room and then I'm good.</v>

867
00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.560
<v Speaker 3>You'll have to get a regular USB card </v>
<v Speaker 3>readers,</v>

868
00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.430
<v Speaker 3>which is five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less common.</v>

869
00:39:21.431 --> 00:39:23.440
<v Speaker 3>It's still easy to find,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like it's Kinda Dorky.</v>

870
00:39:23.441 --> 00:39:25.300
<v Speaker 3>Eventually it will be like 20 slash 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

871
00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't want this in 20.</v>
<v Speaker 3>20.</v>

872
00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That raise your pro.</v>

873
00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.300
<v Speaker 3>The razer blade pro that we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

874
00:39:31.301 --> 00:39:34.510
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting about that is it has </v>
<v Speaker 3>a track pad on the righthand side,</v>

875
00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:35.373
<v Speaker 3>like a mouse because the mouse is on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right and then it has this enormous </v>

876
00:39:38.651 --> 00:39:42.640
<v Speaker 3>keyboard and a mechanical keyboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'm a really big fan of.</v>

877
00:39:42.641 --> 00:39:45.040
<v Speaker 3>I like those clicky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>True,</v>

878
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.110
<v Speaker 3>true desktop replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

879
00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.730
<v Speaker 3>Look at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

880
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:51.490
<v Speaker 3>Isn't an acid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus look at all the cool colors.</v>

881
00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:55.450
<v Speaker 3>I have the 15 inch with the RGB.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love their rgb.</v>

882
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:56.343
<v Speaker 3>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's your razor thing because they </v>

883
00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.880
<v Speaker 3>have a phone now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know the,</v>

884
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:04.510
<v Speaker 3>the razor phone to has rgb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>glowing backlight.</v>

885
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:05.630
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>

886
00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.330
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's their own aesthetic.</v>

887
00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.820
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is rgb stand for?</v>

888
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:10.691
<v Speaker 3>Just red,</v>
<v Speaker 3>green,</v>

889
00:40:10.691 --> 00:40:11.524
<v Speaker 3>blue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the fact that you can cycle </v>

890
00:40:13.541 --> 00:40:16.430
<v Speaker 3>between colors or whatever at any time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

891
00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.153
<v Speaker 3>is almost almost pointless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's technically a backlight which </v>

892
00:40:21.161 --> 00:40:23.770
<v Speaker 3>is useful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but other than that you're just Kinda,</v>

893
00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:26.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get into the Gamer aesthetic,</v>

894
00:40:26.351 --> 00:40:27.820
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

895
00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:28.571
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

896
00:40:28.571 --> 00:40:29.404
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fantastic thing if you're into </v>

897
00:40:31.571 --> 00:40:32.404
<v Speaker 3>games like that thing literally you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>play high end games at very high frame </v>

898
00:40:37.181 --> 00:40:38.014
<v Speaker 3>rates and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what kind of battery life </v>

899
00:40:41.291 --> 00:40:43.330
<v Speaker 3>it has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably not that great.</v>

900
00:40:43.331 --> 00:40:47.520
<v Speaker 3>It's a four k what's so much juice in so</v>
<v Speaker 3>much screen and that's.</v>

901
00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:50.740
<v Speaker 3>So that's a four k laptop with a desktop</v>
<v Speaker 3>gpu in it,</v>

902
00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:54.610
<v Speaker 3>size of four k model versus a full hd </v>
<v Speaker 3>mode model.</v>

903
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:59.200
<v Speaker 3>And I think the fourK has a lower Max </v>
<v Speaker 3>frame rate if I'm not.</v>

904
00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:01.990
<v Speaker 3>So what is the difference in full hd </v>
<v Speaker 3>model?</v>

905
00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:05.440
<v Speaker 3>So I think the full hd model is a higher</v>
<v Speaker 3>100,</v>

906
00:41:05.441 --> 00:41:08.470
<v Speaker 3>20 hertz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 80 p or probably 60 hertz,</v>

907
00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.313
<v Speaker 3>four k.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're gaming you'll probably go </v>

908
00:41:12.041 --> 00:41:14.440
<v Speaker 3>with the 10 80 p,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you get your higher frame rates</v>

909
00:41:14.441 --> 00:41:15.274
<v Speaker 3>and you'll enjoy games better on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if your photo editing than you'll </v>

910
00:41:19.031 --> 00:41:19.864
<v Speaker 3>probably go with the four k and you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>that desktop power or video editing for </v>

911
00:41:23.621 --> 00:41:24.950
<v Speaker 3>example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

912
00:41:24.951 --> 00:41:25.784
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the battery life would be </v>

913
00:41:27.371 --> 00:41:30.760
<v Speaker 3>very long on a four k laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to imagine.</v>

914
00:41:30.761 --> 00:41:32.350
<v Speaker 3>It's so big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

915
00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 3>Like finding</v>

916
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.140
<v Speaker 1>out what it says in terms of the battery</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

917
00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.890
<v Speaker 1>But like if you just playing a game and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not plugged in,</v>

918
00:41:39.891 --> 00:41:40.950
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

919
00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.290
<v Speaker 1>If you're that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're that guy,</v>

920
00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:44.390
<v Speaker 1>you're walking around with the power </v>
<v Speaker 1>cable all the time.</v>

921
00:41:44.391 --> 00:41:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

922
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.070
<v Speaker 1>You're walking to a new room plugging it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and then setting up there.</v>

923
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is better than a desktop </v>

924
00:41:50.931 --> 00:41:51.800
<v Speaker 1>technically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

925
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:53.570
<v Speaker 1>you're walking around with the power all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

926
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:55.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Better than the desktop technically.</v>

927
00:41:55.881 --> 00:41:59.870
<v Speaker 1>But is it as powerful as a desktop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you get a gaming desktop almost.</v>

928
00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:00.943
<v Speaker 1>I think their goal is to get as close to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a desktop as they reasonably can and </v>

929
00:42:05.961 --> 00:42:08.990
<v Speaker 1>then give you the ability to take it </v>
<v Speaker 1>places quickly.</v>

930
00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.410
<v Speaker 1>What does it say about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

931
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:12.643
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking motherfucker disable every </v>

932
00:42:14.871 --> 00:42:17.120
<v Speaker 1>website ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's popups.</v>

933
00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.400
<v Speaker 1>Ugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so gross.</v>

934
00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:22.190
<v Speaker 1>What could this world we live in now?</v>

935
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:23.543
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do I want notifications from your </v>

936
00:42:24.951 --> 00:42:27.620
<v Speaker 1>website?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a great jeff the other day.</v>

937
00:42:27.621 --> 00:42:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Am I saying that right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeff?</v>

938
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.863
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like every website where like you go </v>

939
00:42:31.401 --> 00:42:33.470
<v Speaker 1>on to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even get to the content.</v>

940
00:42:33.471 --> 00:42:35.870
<v Speaker 1>It's just three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>52 minutes.</v>

941
00:42:35.871 --> 00:42:36.704
<v Speaker 1>Battery life movie tests for just </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching a movie that's still 100 </v>

942
00:42:42.471 --> 00:42:44.840
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Watch a movie and then it's dead.</v>

943
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.420
<v Speaker 1>That's hilariously low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

944
00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Because if you watch a movie on a Mac </v>
<v Speaker 1>book pro,</v>

945
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.060
<v Speaker 1>like you got plenty of juice left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie's over.</v>

946
00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:55.070
<v Speaker 1>You might be able to watch three or four</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

947
00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:57.500
<v Speaker 1>The battery 99.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

948
00:42:57.501 --> 00:42:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Our battery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually huge battery,</v>

949
00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.270
<v Speaker 1>but still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

950
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:04.370
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that I liked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

951
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:05.503
<v Speaker 1>not this model of Lenovo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of the pads have a swappable </v>

952
00:43:08.511 --> 00:43:11.210
<v Speaker 1>battery that you could swap wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a while it's on.</v>

953
00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:11.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

954
00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

955
00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

956
00:43:13.971 --> 00:43:15.050
<v Speaker 1>I used to be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

957
00:43:15.051 --> 00:43:15.884
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely a barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an internal battery and there's </v>

958
00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:19.960
<v Speaker 1>an external battery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you pop out the external,</v>

959
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:22.190
<v Speaker 1>but which is a big thick band plugged </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

960
00:43:22.191 --> 00:43:23.024
<v Speaker 1>You want to get the full Jamey that goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 25 fucking hours and if you pop </v>

961
00:43:27.021 --> 00:43:30.530
<v Speaker 1>that sucker out you could do it while </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is still running yet and it doesn't</v>

962
00:43:30.531 --> 00:43:33.330
<v Speaker 1>shut off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pop the new one in hot swapping?</v>

963
00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hot swap that.</v>

964
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:36.900
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had a laptop with that since </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

965
00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.800
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years ago probably.</v>

966
00:43:39.801 --> 00:43:41.150
<v Speaker 1>It's been a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

967
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:44.840
<v Speaker 1>well I think thinkpads are mostly </v>
<v Speaker 1>business oriented.</v>

968
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:47.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really mostly what people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are using them for.</v>

969
00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

970
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:49.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

971
00:43:49.981 --> 00:43:52.370
<v Speaker 1>there's that balance of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you looking for?</v>

972
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Like are you looking for something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do everything?</v>

973
00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Are you looking for something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>

974
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:57.043
<v Speaker 1>I mean most people for a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could really get by with one of </v>

975
00:44:00.321 --> 00:44:03.860
<v Speaker 1>those Google chromebooks that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have much storage at all.</v>

976
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:07.520
<v Speaker 1>That's where I'll probably end up </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting my parents into a lot.</v>

977
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Like if your parents or grandparents </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really need much of a computer,</v>

978
00:44:10.851 --> 00:44:13.760
<v Speaker 1>but all they need to do really is email </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

979
00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:17.810
<v Speaker 1>maybe go to a website or to watch it </v>
<v Speaker 1>online movie.</v>

980
00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.200
<v Speaker 1>You just need a web browser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like a chromebook is great.</v>

981
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much is in the cloud.</v>

982
00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

983
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:26.600
<v Speaker 1>So many people keep their photos in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cloud,</v>

984
00:44:26.601 --> 00:44:28.820
<v Speaker 1>they keep it as long as you have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet connection,</v>

985
00:44:28.821 --> 00:44:29.810
<v Speaker 1>you're good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're good.</v>

986
00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 1>But in terms of like local storage,</v>

987
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:33.360
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

988
00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.630
<v Speaker 3>that's probably one of the things about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when I was talking about this</v>

989
00:44:36.631 --> 00:44:37.464
<v Speaker 3>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only does it only have four gigs of </v>

990
00:44:39.241 --> 00:44:41.820
<v Speaker 3>Ram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it also only has 64 gigs of storage.</v>

991
00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:42.900
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

992
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.863
<v Speaker 3>there's a 64 and a one slash 28 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of phones now that have </v>

993
00:44:45.841 --> 00:44:46.980
<v Speaker 3>like 2:50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

994
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:49.890
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 and then expandable storage via micro</v>

995
00:44:49.891 --> 00:44:52.440
<v Speaker 3>SD.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reasoning google is giving,</v>

996
00:44:52.441 --> 00:44:56.460
<v Speaker 3>which I actually subscribed to you is </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything just goes through the cloud.</v>

997
00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:00.990
<v Speaker 3>Like the only thing I keep offline is my</v>
<v Speaker 3>spotify library and podcasts.</v>

998
00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:02.063
<v Speaker 3>So my whole spotify,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever is like 30 gigs and then </v>

999
00:45:05.251 --> 00:45:07.200
<v Speaker 3>whatever podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a couple more gigs.</v>

1000
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:11.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't need a 512 gig phone for </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1001
00:45:11.101 --> 00:45:11.934
<v Speaker 3>I usually keep offline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a couple of big apps but not </v>

1002
00:45:14.071 --> 00:45:15.030
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1003
00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:15.883
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the photos I take get uploaded </v>

1004
00:45:17.311 --> 00:45:18.144
<v Speaker 3>automatically to google photos in full </v>
<v Speaker 3>resolution and I never really have to </v>

1005
00:45:22.351 --> 00:45:23.184
<v Speaker 3>keep all of them locally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So every photo I've ever taken in full </v>

1006
00:45:25.501 --> 00:45:26.334
<v Speaker 3>resolution is on my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though I only have 128 gigs of </v>

1007
00:45:28.801 --> 00:45:29.634
<v Speaker 3>storage</v>

1008
00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:34.710
<v Speaker 2>now when you use the Google version of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like whatever I photo is,</v>

1009
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:36.923
<v Speaker 2>I photo uploads everything to the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really simple when you get a new </v>

1010
00:45:39.371 --> 00:45:40.640
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything loads up to it.</v>

1011
00:45:40.641 --> 00:45:42.020
<v Speaker 2>Does the same thing happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>

1012
00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:43.250
<v Speaker 2>Google just as good.</v>

1013
00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:44.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can use it on an iphone,</v>

1014
00:45:44.661 --> 00:45:45.560
<v Speaker 3>which is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to.</v>

1015
00:45:45.561 --> 00:45:46.640
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real photos.</v>

1016
00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:47.683
<v Speaker 3>I have google photos on my iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so every time I take great photos on </v>

1017
00:45:50.001 --> 00:45:51.320
<v Speaker 3>this phone they're on my iphone.</v>

1018
00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:52.323
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is actually not having the APP is </v>

1019
00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.180
<v Speaker 2>pretty useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nice.</v>

1020
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:58.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know there's a thing that's one of</v>

1021
00:45:58.611 --> 00:46:01.580
<v Speaker 2>the things that people really love about</v>
<v Speaker 2>iphones is that airdrop feature.</v>

1022
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:02.623
<v Speaker 2>That's very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the best apple only </v>

1023
00:46:06.201 --> 00:46:07.260
<v Speaker 2>features.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1024
00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:11.060
<v Speaker 2>But don't they have an android?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an android dropped to now I know</v>

1025
00:46:11.061 --> 00:46:16.061
<v Speaker 2>that because I've used it to send things</v>
<v Speaker 2>from my Samsung phone to my apple phone.</v>

1026
00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:19.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly.</v>

1027
00:46:19.511 --> 00:46:22.420
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like a first party thing.</v>

1028
00:46:22.421 --> 00:46:23.254
<v Speaker 3>So NFC is useful when I want to send </v>
<v Speaker 3>something between two android phones </v>

1029
00:46:28.271 --> 00:46:31.150
<v Speaker 3>that NFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is something I recently,</v>

1030
00:46:31.151 --> 00:46:32.890
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't really using airdrop until </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently.</v>

1031
00:46:32.891 --> 00:46:33.611
<v Speaker 3>And then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh wait,</v>

1032
00:46:33.611 --> 00:46:34.444
<v Speaker 3>I do have a Mac and an iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can just transfer transfer files back </v>

1033
00:46:37.421 --> 00:46:39.310
<v Speaker 3>and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1034
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:41.020
<v Speaker 3>we started doing that in the office a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot,</v>

1035
00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:41.883
<v Speaker 3>which we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a bunch of MACs and iphones in </v>

1036
00:46:43.211 --> 00:46:44.044
<v Speaker 3>the office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we started like passing files back </v>

1037
00:46:45.371 --> 00:46:46.204
<v Speaker 3>and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then one day I was trying to do it </v>

1038
00:46:47.561 --> 00:46:48.610
<v Speaker 3>on my android phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1039
00:46:48.611 --> 00:46:49.630
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like a bummer.</v>

1040
00:46:49.631 --> 00:46:52.660
<v Speaker 3>I have to go into like dropbox and </v>
<v Speaker 3>upload it and then download it.</v>

1041
00:46:52.661 --> 00:46:53.494
<v Speaker 3>And it was just this couple extra steps </v>
<v Speaker 3>were a pain and it made me really </v>

1042
00:46:56.021 --> 00:46:58.030
<v Speaker 3>appreciate how good airdrop is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1043
00:46:58.210 --> 00:46:59.043
<v Speaker 2>they're just pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was really good at making things </v>

1044
00:47:00.991 --> 00:47:02.430
<v Speaker 2>super simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1045
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.473
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't ever really have to update </v>

1046
00:47:04.831 --> 00:47:08.310
<v Speaker 2>things and until the ostp updates and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty rare.</v>

1047
00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything works really good.</v>

1048
00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:14.730
<v Speaker 2>You don't really even worry about </v>
<v Speaker 2>viruses or anything like that.</v>

1049
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot they do.</v>

1050
00:47:16.471 --> 00:47:18.870
<v Speaker 2>That's really excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1051
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:23.910
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like the running on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>momentum of Steve Jobs,</v>

1052
00:47:23.911 --> 00:47:26.150
<v Speaker 2>maniacal vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1053
00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:28.323
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's been a lot of apples changed or </v>

1054
00:47:31.961 --> 00:47:34.390
<v Speaker 3>apple is not the same sense since no </v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

1055
00:47:34.391 --> 00:47:37.210
<v Speaker 3>Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is true obviously.</v>

1056
00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:40.780
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're also like their momentum,</v>

1057
00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:43.600
<v Speaker 3>like how can you not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're insane.</v>

1058
00:47:43.601 --> 00:47:45.190
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're a trillion dollar company now.</v>

1059
00:47:45.191 --> 00:47:49.750
<v Speaker 3>They continue to make iphones that look </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same that they did nine years ago.</v>

1060
00:47:49.751 --> 00:47:51.790
<v Speaker 3>Like why not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1061
00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:52.863
<v Speaker 3>And if people keep buying them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course they'll probably never have a </v>

1062
00:47:54.331 --> 00:47:55.164
<v Speaker 3>reason to change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a different kind of company </v>

1063
00:47:57.041 --> 00:47:57.611
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before.</v>

1064
00:47:57.611 --> 00:48:01.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was like Jen generally </v>
<v Speaker 3>regarded as an asshole,</v>

1065
00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.880
<v Speaker 3>like just a crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1066
00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:05.260
<v Speaker 3>Whip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cracking.</v>

1067
00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:06.540
<v Speaker 3>Micromanaging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1068
00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:07.413
<v Speaker 3>Just just a nut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's that famous thing of him </v>

1069
00:48:09.761 --> 00:48:12.100
<v Speaker 3>trying to use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what the device was,</v>

1070
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:15.620
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't used.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't working during one stage.</v>

1071
00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:17.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember that live and he threw it.</v>

1072
00:48:17.411 --> 00:48:18.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like did.</v>

1073
00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:19.660
<v Speaker 3>It was casual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was hilarious.</v>

1074
00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:23.320
<v Speaker 3>It was like there was anger to it though</v>
<v Speaker 3>because someone definitely got fired.</v>

1075
00:48:23.321 --> 00:48:25.510
<v Speaker 3>Like within minutes of that happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1076
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:29.430
<v Speaker 3>And that's happened on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like things mess up on stage like yeah,</v>

1077
00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.980
<v Speaker 3>it's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For a couple of years ago there was a,</v>

1078
00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:33.843
<v Speaker 3>an apple event or s I'm pretty sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve was on stage trying to get </v>

1079
00:48:36.551 --> 00:48:37.384
<v Speaker 3>something to work like in a demo and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've ever been or seen like an apple </v>

1080
00:48:42.011 --> 00:48:44.440
<v Speaker 3>event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the entire audience or half of it,</v>

1081
00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:49.810
<v Speaker 3>half of the audience is just people </v>
<v Speaker 3>typing like blogging,</v>

1082
00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:50.673
<v Speaker 3>like exactly what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're all connected to the </v>

1083
00:48:51.971 --> 00:48:53.140
<v Speaker 3>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're live blogging.</v>

1084
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:54.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Steve is like,</v>

1085
00:48:54.791 --> 00:48:57.130
<v Speaker 3>get me one that works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at his face.</v>

1086
00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:57.993
<v Speaker 3>This is the thing like back that up a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit and give me some volume like </v>

1087
00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:02.853
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1088
00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:06.650
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take that,</v>

1089
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:12.103
<v Speaker 4>turn it on.</v>

1090
00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:14.420
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well let's see if we can turn it on.</v>

1091
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:16.910
<v Speaker 3>There's an anger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1092
00:49:16.911 --> 00:49:17.840
<v Speaker 3>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

1093
00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:21.920
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my speech after the show,</v>

1094
00:49:21.921 --> 00:49:23.320
<v Speaker 3>he was definitely doing the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1095
00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:24.213
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's another event where like </v>

1096
00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:25.453
<v Speaker 3>something wasn't working and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need everyone in this room to turn </v>

1097
00:49:28.041 --> 00:49:30.560
<v Speaker 3>your wifi off so that this will work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone.</v>

1098
00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.800
<v Speaker 3>I need everyone to stop blogging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>close your laptops,</v>

1099
00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:36.230
<v Speaker 3>get off the Wifi and then this will </v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

1100
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:38.510
<v Speaker 3>And it was kind of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple minutes of like,</v>

1101
00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:39.530
<v Speaker 3>ha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's funny.</v>

1102
00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:40.663
<v Speaker 3>Maybe is he serious?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like slowly like everyone did close </v>

1103
00:49:44.231 --> 00:49:44.740
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1104
00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:45.470
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone,</v>

1105
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:46.303
<v Speaker 3>everyone get off the Wifi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone close your computers right now </v>

1106
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:49.940
<v Speaker 3>and this is going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was the issue.</v>

1107
00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:51.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember exactly it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

1108
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:54.500
<v Speaker 3>Must have been some wireless related </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting something to load or work.</v>

1109
00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:55.693
<v Speaker 3>But that was pretty hilarious to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like if you want things to </v>

1110
00:49:58.851 --> 00:50:01.610
<v Speaker 3>operate at the speed of apple when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was alive,</v>

1111
00:50:01.611 --> 00:50:03.820
<v Speaker 3>you kind of have to be a fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>asshole.</v>

1112
00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have that next level.</v>

1113
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:08.780
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need a vision of what you wanted to be</v>

1114
00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:12.200
<v Speaker 3>and then you need to be insane enough to</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to get people to do that.</v>

1115
00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:14.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he also was according to.</v>

1116
00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.870
<v Speaker 3>Is this it right here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1117

1119
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:24.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a four minute.</v>

1120
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.093
<v Speaker 4>But this is.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Wifi is just getting tagged.</v>

1123
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.180
<v Speaker 3>He isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wifi is getting crushed.</v>

1124
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:47.850
<v Speaker 3>So instead of verizon atnt</v>

1127
00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:59.170
<v Speaker 4>confronting moment where he said it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're actually unwind by here.</v>

1128
00:50:59.171 --> 00:51:04.171
<v Speaker 4>So at 20 minutes later Jesus.</v>

<v Speaker 4>running around like crazy.</v>

1130
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:14.340
<v Speaker 4>We figured out why.</v>

1131
00:51:14.341 --> 00:51:15.174
<v Speaker 4>little crashed.</v>

1132
00:51:18.961 --> 00:51:23.961
<v Speaker 4>stations operating in this room?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't deal with that either.</v>

1133
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:27.733
<v Speaker 4>I've got some really great that I'd like</v>
<v Speaker 4>to show you so we can turn off all the </v>

1134

<v Speaker 4>stuff and see the demos or we give up </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't show you the demo.</v>

1135
00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:41.810
<v Speaker 4>Would you want to see?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking of hoping</v>

1136
00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:45.890
<v Speaker 3>he'll just try again and then I'll have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to turn it off.</v>

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:46.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1138

<v Speaker 4>So all you need to turn off,</v>

1139
00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.153
<v Speaker 4>turn off every notebook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like them to put them down on the </v>

1140
00:51:56.591 --> 00:51:59.650
<v Speaker 4>floor and all you look around and want </v>
<v Speaker 4>you to help me see each other.</v>

1147
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:20.030
<v Speaker 4>Hey Johnny facetime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another thing.</v>

1148
00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:20.630
<v Speaker 4>Like</v>

1149
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:22.970
<v Speaker 3>facetime is another proprietary thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that apple has.</v>

1150
00:52:22.971 --> 00:52:26.390
<v Speaker 3>It's really excellent and it's built </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the contacts.</v>

1151
00:52:26.391 --> 00:52:28.080
<v Speaker 3>It works perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1152
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:30.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just everyone with an iphone.</v>

1153
00:52:30.141 --> 00:52:32.210
<v Speaker 3>You can do it with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just Papao.</v>

1154
00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:35.740
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a massive vat and I message,</v>

1155
00:52:35.741 --> 00:52:36.574
<v Speaker 3>or like two of the biggest reasons </v>
<v Speaker 3>people refused to even try an android </v>

1156
00:52:40.131 --> 00:52:41.030
<v Speaker 3>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm like,</v>

1157
00:52:41.031 --> 00:52:41.864
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well clearly google's mission should be </v>

1158
00:52:43.491 --> 00:52:46.490
<v Speaker 3>to get it message on Android,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1159
00:52:46.491 --> 00:52:50.720
<v Speaker 3>Like that should be like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An apple will never let that happen.</v>

1160
00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:55.130
<v Speaker 3>They know that they can hold people </v>
<v Speaker 3>hostage on Ios as long as they want.</v>

1161
00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:56.293
<v Speaker 3>If they can't get the message anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>else and takes time and things like </v>

1162
00:52:58.881 --> 00:53:00.050
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I imessage,</v>

1163
00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.790
<v Speaker 3>facetime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>airdrop,</v>

1164
00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:03.630
<v Speaker 3>walled garden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1165
00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.033
<v Speaker 3>Wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Walled Garden made a video about this </v>

1166
00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.700
<v Speaker 3>whole ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's A.</v>

1167
00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.710
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a real major advantage.</v>

1168
00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really is.</v>

1169
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:15.223
<v Speaker 3>And they've got that nailed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They really do try to make their own </v>

1170
00:53:19.311 --> 00:53:20.960
<v Speaker 3>versions of these things too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1171
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:23.990
<v Speaker 3>just like they tried to do google plus </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everybody was like,</v>

1172
00:53:23.991 --> 00:53:24.930
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good luck with it.</v>

1173
00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:26.490
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who was an executive at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Google.</v>

1174
00:53:26.491 --> 00:53:27.324
<v Speaker 3>It was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was always telling me how great </v>

1175
00:53:28.741 --> 00:53:29.574
<v Speaker 3>google pluses might.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shit's dead in the water thing is </v>

1176
00:53:31.771 --> 00:53:35.760
<v Speaker 3>google plus Google plus even though only</v>
<v Speaker 3>like nine people used it.</v>

1177
00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:38.280
<v Speaker 3>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure was really good,</v>

1178
00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:39.353
<v Speaker 3>like all the things that they let you do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I wish facebook would let us do </v>

1179
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:43.223
<v Speaker 3>like sharing with certain groups of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and like all these different </v>

1180
00:53:45.211 --> 00:53:47.550
<v Speaker 3>things with circles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was kind of a shit show with like how</v>

1181
00:53:47.551 --> 00:53:49.440
<v Speaker 3>they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's good.</v>

1182
00:53:49.590 --> 00:53:52.880
<v Speaker 3>Like it was good anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's going to die now and that's kind</v>

1183
00:53:52.881 --> 00:53:53.340
<v Speaker 3>of sad.</v>

1184
00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:54.570
<v Speaker 3>It is killing Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1185
00:53:54.571 --> 00:53:57.120
<v Speaker 3>They have this whole security breach </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

1186
00:53:57.810 --> 00:53:59.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is also a weird story.</v>

1187
00:53:59.761 --> 00:54:01.200
<v Speaker 3>But then eventually they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

1188
00:54:01.201 --> 00:54:03.220
<v Speaker 3>we're shutting it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1189
00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:05.570
<v Speaker 3>I want to call my friend up and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ha ha,</v>

1190
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:06.543
<v Speaker 3>I told you so it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be finally no more google </v>

1191
00:54:09.751 --> 00:54:13.170
<v Speaker 3>plus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like Google keeps trying to do this.</v>

1192
00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:16.890
<v Speaker 3>They keep calling it like a universal </v>
<v Speaker 3>message service.</v>

1193
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:17.671
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1194
00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:19.860
<v Speaker 3>I messaged for Android,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to make your own great.</v>

1195
00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:20.903
<v Speaker 3>And then make a aloe duo hangouts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men like they have all these half </v>

1196
00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:30.210
<v Speaker 3>halfway there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things that kind of tie into android and</v>

1197
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:34.040
<v Speaker 3>are sort of like facetime and imessage </v>
<v Speaker 3>but not really a.</v>

1198
00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:37.980
<v Speaker 3>and it's just not well done and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>convincing anyone.</v>

1199
00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:38.843
<v Speaker 3>Now I know there's been some third party</v>
<v Speaker 3>attempts to figure out how to put our </v>

1200
00:54:41.851 --> 00:54:42.684
<v Speaker 3>message on android phones that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>get like some sort of an app that allow </v>

1201
00:54:47.611 --> 00:54:51.990
<v Speaker 3>you to use our message is probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>really clunky and 40.</v>

1202
00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:53.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't tried that.</v>

1203
00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:55.950
<v Speaker 3>I haven't either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I imagine it's horrible.</v>

1204
00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:58.620
<v Speaker 3>I have the note nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1205
00:54:58.621 --> 00:55:00.750
<v Speaker 3>and I was thinking about switching over </v>
<v Speaker 3>to it and I was like,</v>

1206
00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:03.150
<v Speaker 3>oh I'll use this pen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never use a pen once.</v>

1207
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:04.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1208
00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:06.480
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I as a reviewer,</v>

1209
00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:07.373
<v Speaker 3>I'm always trying to figure out what is </v>
<v Speaker 3>a real genuine use it everyday feature </v>

1210
00:55:11.550 --> 00:55:12.383
<v Speaker 3>that's worth paying extra for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what is a cool demo feature that'll </v>

1211
00:55:16.141 --> 00:55:19.500
<v Speaker 3>get you to brag about the phone and show</v>
<v Speaker 3>your friends but you'll never use it.</v>

1212
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:21.023
<v Speaker 3>And I've always been split on the s pen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a thing people really use all </v>

1213
00:55:24.751 --> 00:55:25.584
<v Speaker 3>the time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've been like kind of somewhat </v>

1214
00:55:27.721 --> 00:55:28.950
<v Speaker 3>convinced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's people who like,</v>

1215
00:55:28.951 --> 00:55:30.450
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use the s pen every day.</v>

1216
00:55:30.451 --> 00:55:33.600
<v Speaker 3>I take notes on my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use that APP and I'm like,</v>

1217
00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:36.060
<v Speaker 3>I try,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try.</v>

1218
00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:38.070
<v Speaker 3>I had this little point where I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1219
00:55:38.071 --> 00:55:38.904
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do lock screen notes every </v>

1220
00:55:39.841 --> 00:55:40.674
<v Speaker 3>time I want to remember something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to write it down and I just </v>

1221
00:55:42.931 --> 00:55:43.764
<v Speaker 3>never got into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like I'm usually pretty good about </v>

1222
00:55:46.411 --> 00:55:48.660
<v Speaker 3>like dividing things into buckets of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1223
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:49.553
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is something we will use and is </v>

1224
00:55:50.821 --> 00:55:52.770
<v Speaker 3>worth paying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is dumb,</v>

1225
00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:53.693
<v Speaker 3>but it's really cool to demo and it will</v>
<v Speaker 3>just sell people and they never use it </v>

1226
00:55:55.921 --> 00:55:57.790
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those two buckets are very clear.</v>

1227
00:55:57.791 --> 00:55:58.624
<v Speaker 3>The yes pencil has been in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the lock screen things weird too </v>

1228
00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:04.710
<v Speaker 3>because it doesn't work that smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lock screen known better.</v>

1229
00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:05.663
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a little clunky and then you don't </v>

1230
00:56:07.621 --> 00:56:10.020
<v Speaker 3>just get it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It saves it to notes.</v>

1231
00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:12.210
<v Speaker 3>So you have to go to and you have to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the notes APP.</v>

1232
00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.073
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1233
00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:14.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what my thought was,</v>

1234
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:15.863
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to use this and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>put my set list on my phone and that </v>

1235
00:56:19.591 --> 00:56:22.950
<v Speaker 3>where anytime I go to the lock screen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the note setlist would be there.</v>

1236
00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 3>I'll just be able to scroll through</v>

1237
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.880
<v Speaker 1>my set list when I go on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1238
00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:27.900
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't work there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1239
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:30.640
<v Speaker 1>I've got to go to the notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well what is this then?</v>

1240
00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1241
00:56:31.781 --> 00:56:34.150
<v Speaker 1>so it's just kind of weird halfway </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1242
00:56:34.310 --> 00:56:35.710
<v Speaker 1>but I want to talk to someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1243
00:56:35.711 --> 00:56:36.544
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I buy the note every year because I got </v>

1244
00:56:37.201 --> 00:56:39.710
<v Speaker 1>to have the pen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I got this.</v>

1245
00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:41.470
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1246
00:56:41.471 --> 00:56:42.304
<v Speaker 1>one thing that is kind of cool about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've never used once but kind of </v>

1247
00:56:44.771 --> 00:56:48.190
<v Speaker 1>cool about it is the fact that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>use that pen as a remote control.</v>

1248
00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:49.053
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely a take photographs </v>
<v Speaker 1>firmly in the second bucket of like </v>

1249
00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:53.700
<v Speaker 1>great demo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1250
00:56:53.701 --> 00:56:54.534
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm halfway across the room taking a </v>

1251
00:56:55.181 --> 00:56:56.110
<v Speaker 1>selfie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool,</v>

1252
00:56:56.111 --> 00:56:56.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1253
00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you'll never use it,</v>

1254
00:56:57.851 --> 00:56:58.684
<v Speaker 1>never use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also using it as a remote </v>

1255
00:57:00.341 --> 00:57:04.180
<v Speaker 1>control for music and for video you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>map it to all kinds of crazy thing.</v>

1256
00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:06.160
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a really well thought out </v>
<v Speaker 1>feature.</v>

1257
00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:09.490
<v Speaker 1>It gets Bluetooth and the s pen has its </v>
<v Speaker 1>own battery now.</v>

1258
00:57:09.491 --> 00:57:10.324
<v Speaker 1>So you put the battery in the phone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it charges the stylists very quickly in </v>

1259
00:57:14.411 --> 00:57:16.240
<v Speaker 1>a couple of seconds you get like half of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the battery.</v>

1260
00:57:16.241 --> 00:57:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Like it's really well thought out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1261
00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:21.730
<v Speaker 1>But am I ever going to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>

1262
00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The battery is huge too.</v>

1263
00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:24.723
<v Speaker 1>It's got a 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>milliamp battery as opposed to the </v>

1264
00:57:26.171 --> 00:57:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what?</v>

1265
00:57:27.131 --> 00:57:28.960
<v Speaker 1>30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the big ones,</v>

1266
00:57:28.961 --> 00:57:31.870
<v Speaker 1>like at 31 and $3,200.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that that little?</v>

1267
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean like iphone.</v>

1268
00:57:33.301 --> 00:57:36.820
<v Speaker 1>So I've never needed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The number on paper to be big to be well</v>

1269
00:57:36.821 --> 00:57:38.680
<v Speaker 1>optimized because it's software </v>
<v Speaker 1>software,</v>

1270
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:43.390
<v Speaker 1>but they've done tests where they did </v>
<v Speaker 1>benchmark tests between the note and the</v>

1271
00:57:43.391 --> 00:57:46.410
<v Speaker 1>iphone x.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it matter to tennis 10.</v>

1272
00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Ask Max.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1273
00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:48.793
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

1274
00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:50.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1275
00:57:50.431 --> 00:57:52.000
<v Speaker 1>the note crushes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1276
00:57:52.090 --> 00:57:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1277
00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Samsung's getting better with </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimization too,</v>

1278
00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:56.350
<v Speaker 1>which is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That they crush it.</v>

1279
00:57:56.351 --> 00:57:57.184
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to be kind of scared of </v>

1280
00:57:57.971 --> 00:58:01.720
<v Speaker 1>batteries in the notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder why so that they finally gotten</v>

1281
00:58:01.721 --> 00:58:03.570
<v Speaker 1>better at that and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing really well.</v>

1282
00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:04.483
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that they bounced back from</v>
<v Speaker 1>that at all because we'll fucking died </v>

1283
00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:09.760
<v Speaker 1>in A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anyone died.</v>

1284
00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some one guy,</v>

1285
00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:12.453
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a famous guy who was a </v>

1286
00:58:14.291 --> 00:58:18.160
<v Speaker 1>tech guy who died because his battery </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploded in his house,</v>

1287
00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:20.190
<v Speaker 1>caught on fire and he died in the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1288
00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:21.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what phone he was using </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1289
00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:23.650
<v Speaker 1>He was some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

1290
00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:25.023
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was the note crypto </v>
<v Speaker 1>currency guy not follow the note pretty </v>

1291
00:58:28.481 --> 00:58:31.380
<v Speaker 1>closely because that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a couple of them just because like</v>

1292
00:58:31.381 --> 00:58:33.370
<v Speaker 1>I was in the middle of reviewing it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>using it.</v>

1293
00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:35.800
<v Speaker 1>I carried when everyday starts getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>banned,</v>

1294
00:58:35.801 --> 00:58:38.230
<v Speaker 1>starts getting caught on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't fly with it.</v>

1295
00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Like I followed that all very closely </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of you.</v>

1296
00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:41.723
<v Speaker 1>The cases of cause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it started off with not only where the </v>

1297
00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.153
<v Speaker 1>note seven starting to explode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they started recalling them and </v>

1298
00:58:48.071 --> 00:58:51.970
<v Speaker 1>sending people replacements and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>replacements started to explode.</v>

1299
00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:55.090
<v Speaker 1>At that point I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is amazing.</v>

1300
00:58:55.091 --> 00:58:57.910
<v Speaker 1>I need to follow very closely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1301
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.823
<v Speaker 1>had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a blackberry and a y way and they don't </v>

1302
00:59:00.371 --> 00:59:04.230
<v Speaker 1>know which one exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably walway assassination.</v>

1303
00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:06.880
<v Speaker 1>I never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a weird,</v>

1304
00:59:06.881 --> 00:59:07.714
<v Speaker 1>actually wasn't ceo cradle fund ceo now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just written Hassan song and it caught </v>

1305
00:59:13.091 --> 00:59:14.820
<v Speaker 1>his whole house on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1306
00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:17.410
<v Speaker 1>He died after smartphones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling catches fire in his bedroom.</v>

1307
00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.090
<v Speaker 1>That is really extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1308
00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where to go.</v>

1309
00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:22.060
<v Speaker 1>They can't mess around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like</v>

1310
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:24.830
<v Speaker 3>one that's when your phone starts </v>
<v Speaker 3>exploding and you're Samsung,</v>

1311
00:59:24.831 --> 00:59:26.720
<v Speaker 3>like you have to get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to fix that.</v>

1312
00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:27.613
<v Speaker 3>There was a famous video of the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 3>parked his car in the driveway and put </v>

1313
00:59:31.251 --> 00:59:33.320
<v Speaker 3>his phone in the charger and left it </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1314
00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:36.620
<v Speaker 3>And he came outside to his car bursting </v>
<v Speaker 3>into flames.</v>

1315
00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:39.560
<v Speaker 3>His whole car was on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1316
00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:40.663
<v Speaker 3>That's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially in a gas car with literal </v>

1317
00:59:43.041 --> 00:59:46.580
<v Speaker 3>flammable liquids in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Luckily it wasn't in his garage.</v>

1318
00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:49.880
<v Speaker 3>She was in his driveway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is net fuck.</v>

1319
00:59:50.090 --> 00:59:50.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

1320
00:59:50.961 --> 00:59:52.970
<v Speaker 3>They've bounced back from that though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they really have.</v>

1321
00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:54.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're actually,</v>

1322
00:59:54.171 --> 00:59:56.150
<v Speaker 3>that's been impressive at their </v>
<v Speaker 3>reputation.</v>

1323
00:59:56.151 --> 00:59:58.240
<v Speaker 3>So like in the reviewer community of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1324
00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:00.740
<v Speaker 3>I watch it all my friends videos about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the note when it came out,</v>

1325
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:05.510
<v Speaker 3>we stopped making explosion jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This year I noticed that the galaxy note</v>

1326
01:00:05.511 --> 01:00:07.010
<v Speaker 3>seven had all the explosion jokes.</v>

1327
01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:08.293
<v Speaker 3>No eight came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the explosion jokes last year it </v>

1328
01:00:11.031 --> 01:00:13.130
<v Speaker 3>exploded guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what have they done this year?</v>

1329
01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:16.240
<v Speaker 3>It's better now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're on no nine and I think we're kinda</v>

1330
01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:18.510
<v Speaker 3>over it two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how long it takes.</v>

1331
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:23.330
<v Speaker 3>That's today though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the short cycle of news today.</v>

1332
01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:24.183
<v Speaker 3>It's like things come and go so quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wonder if that would've happened </v>

1333
01:00:26.901 --> 01:00:27.734
<v Speaker 3>to an iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of nightmare that would have </v>

1334
01:00:30.111 --> 01:00:30.944
<v Speaker 3>been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also think there's probably no way it </v>

1335
01:00:32.571 --> 01:00:34.520
<v Speaker 3>would have happened to an iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you would think.</v>

1336
01:00:34.521 --> 01:00:36.950
<v Speaker 3>There's no way what happened to Samsung,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but somehow it did.</v>

1337
01:00:36.951 --> 01:00:40.940
<v Speaker 3>But like there's this whole process of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like getting a battery supplier for your</v>

1338
01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:44.540
<v Speaker 3>phone and then trusting their quality </v>
<v Speaker 3>testing and then using that supplier for</v>

1339
01:00:44.541 --> 01:00:46.330
<v Speaker 3>your manufacturing and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1340
01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:48.213
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know how different that </v>
<v Speaker 3>process is for Samsung versus other </v>

1341
01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:55.610
<v Speaker 3>manufacturers like apple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just seems like apple would never</v>

1342
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:59.100
<v Speaker 3>let that sort of oversight slip bright.</v>

1343
01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:00.350
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder,</v>

1344
01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:01.930
<v Speaker 3>but if it did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how crazy would that have been?</v>

1345
01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:04.310
<v Speaker 3>Samsung comes out with new phones way </v>
<v Speaker 3>quicker,</v>

1346
01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:06.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1347
01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:07.363
<v Speaker 3>so they come out with phones more often,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they update their lineups at the </v>

1348
01:01:11.151 --> 01:01:11.984
<v Speaker 3>same rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like once a year for note and also once </v>

1349
01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.650
<v Speaker 3>a year for galaxy s.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But since they're six months apart,</v>

1350
01:01:18.651 --> 01:01:21.950
<v Speaker 3>it looks like they made four new phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to get a new phone.</v>

1351
01:01:21.951 --> 01:01:22.784
<v Speaker 3>Every April galaxy has 10 will come out </v>
<v Speaker 3>in April and they'll get galaxy note in </v>

1352
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:28.420
<v Speaker 3>September.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was like,</v>

1353
01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:30.950
<v Speaker 3>well it's only six months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's part of a different lineup.</v>

1354
01:01:30.951 --> 01:01:31.784
<v Speaker 3>So like galaxy s is every year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Galaxy notice every year they have all </v>

1355
01:01:34.071 --> 01:01:34.904
<v Speaker 3>these other lineups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they didn't make a lot more phones </v>

1356
01:01:36.531 --> 01:01:37.364
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Are they still doing the sport </v>

1357
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:41.120
<v Speaker 3>because they had that sport model </v>
<v Speaker 3>active?</v>

1358
01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:42.980
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they are still.</v>

1359
01:01:42.981 --> 01:01:47.960
<v Speaker 3>It's not nearly as special seeming to </v>
<v Speaker 3>them as it used to be.</v>

1360
01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:50.390
<v Speaker 3>They used to really like put a separate </v>
<v Speaker 3>commercials for it.</v>

1361
01:01:50.391 --> 01:01:51.224
<v Speaker 3>And they have like all this hype.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember like Galaxy s seven active </v>

1362
01:01:53.541 --> 01:01:56.570
<v Speaker 3>was a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if there is a galaxy s</v>

1363
01:01:56.571 --> 01:01:58.060
<v Speaker 3>nine active,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe there is.</v>

1364
01:01:58.061 --> 01:01:58.894
<v Speaker 3>It might not be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a rumor that it was coming out </v>

1365
01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:03.230
<v Speaker 3>and then it was going to be completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>waterproof and shock resistant.</v>

1366
01:02:03.231 --> 01:02:05.310
<v Speaker 3>It was going to have a rubberized case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1367
01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.360
<v Speaker 3>And it was going to have an enormous </v>
<v Speaker 3>battery life that didn't.</v>

1368
01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:12.470
<v Speaker 3>They haven't released it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The nine was going to have the same size</v>

1369
01:02:12.471 --> 01:02:17.471
<v Speaker 3>battery as the note nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the regular size nine screen.</v>

1370
01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 3>So 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>million amp</v>

1371
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.080
<v Speaker 2>battery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the s nine screen.</v>

1372
01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:24.120
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which would have been massive.</v>

1373
01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just.</v>

1374
01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:26.513
<v Speaker 2>That would have been incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess people just don't buy it as </v>

1375
01:02:29.731 --> 01:02:30.570
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1376
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:33.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people knew about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's one of those deals.</v>

1377
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.233
<v Speaker 2>I love battery life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always scared that my phone's going </v>

1378
01:02:37.821 --> 01:02:38.654
<v Speaker 2>to run out of battery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's ridiculous because it very </v>

1379
01:02:39.931 --> 01:02:41.160
<v Speaker 2>rarely does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm always like,</v>

1380
01:02:41.161 --> 01:02:42.480
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if it runs out of battery?</v>

1381
01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:43.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I hear about like the iphone's </v>

1382
01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.430
<v Speaker 2>battery not being so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

1383
01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:48.473
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the x s regular has better battery life </v>

1384
01:02:53.781 --> 01:02:58.080
<v Speaker 2>and the excess Max because Max has the </v>
<v Speaker 2>larger screen.</v>

1385
01:02:58.190 --> 01:03:00.770
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're about the same.</v>

1386
01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:01.933
<v Speaker 3>I think that standby time on the tennis </v>
<v Speaker 3>Max is better because of the bigger </v>

1387
01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:07.520
<v Speaker 3>battery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you do use your screen a lot,</v>

1388
01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:10.640
<v Speaker 3>they kind of diminished down to the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>number I think.</v>

1389
01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.410
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the iphone 10 are,</v>

1390
01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:13.363
<v Speaker 3>which I've just started using,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to have a battery battery life </v>

1391
01:03:15.231 --> 01:03:16.064
<v Speaker 3>than both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is the less expensive $750 ips </v>

1392
01:03:20.391 --> 01:03:23.270
<v Speaker 3>lcd version of the iphone 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1393
01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:24.290
<v Speaker 3>The color is and all that.</v>

1394
01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:27.640
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of a factor is that in everyday</v>

1395
01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:29.150
<v Speaker 2>use?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you notice the difference?</v>

1396
01:03:29.151 --> 01:03:29.984
<v Speaker 2>The battery life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1397
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:30.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1398
01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:33.170
<v Speaker 2>the image quality not being as good with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the different screen.</v>

1399
01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:34.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the only factor,</v>

1400
01:03:34.701 --> 01:03:36.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of the internal components of same.</v>

1401
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:39.800
<v Speaker 3>They are the same as one gig of Ram </v>
<v Speaker 3>weirdly,</v>

1402
01:03:39.801 --> 01:03:41.630
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the rest of the internals of what is</v>

1403
01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:42.493
<v Speaker 3>a standard one half six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so four gigs of Ram on every iphone </v>

1404
01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:49.990
<v Speaker 3>still and then three gigs in the 10 are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then also one camera instead of two.</v>

1405
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:54.620
<v Speaker 3>And then an aluminum rail on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call it a rail,</v>

1406
01:03:54.621 --> 01:03:56.840
<v Speaker 3>but the outside's aluminum instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stainless steel.</v>

1407
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:59.330
<v Speaker 3>So the iphone's got the shiny stainless </v>
<v Speaker 3>steel outside.</v>

1408
01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:01.100
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

1409
01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:03.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the screen is still pretty decent.</v>

1410
01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:07.160
<v Speaker 3>I know everyone likes to trash on it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's only eight,</v>

1411
01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:09.080
<v Speaker 3>20 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>PM,</v>

1412
01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:11.240
<v Speaker 3>7:20</v>
<v Speaker 3>p screen roughly.</v>

1413
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:14.300
<v Speaker 3>This is the bar the are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1414
01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:17.390
<v Speaker 3>but like using it or just looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks fine.</v>

1415
01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:19.820
<v Speaker 3>And like an apple iphone eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1416
01:04:19.850 --> 01:04:22.700
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same pixel density as an iphone</v>

1417
01:04:22.701 --> 01:04:24.800
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was fine for most people.</v>

1418
01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.390
<v Speaker 3>So if you get too caught up on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>number,</v>

1419
01:04:26.391 --> 01:04:28.700
<v Speaker 3>which is not the typical iphone 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our buyer,</v>

1420
01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:29.960
<v Speaker 3>then it's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look bad,</v>

1421
01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:31.970
<v Speaker 3>but if you just look at the screen and </v>
<v Speaker 3>use it,</v>

1422
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.220
<v Speaker 3>which is most people walking in a store </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just say,</v>

1423
01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:36.980
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this looks fine and it's $250 cheaper.</v>

1424
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:39.600
<v Speaker 3>I think I'll just get this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I think the 10 hours is going</v>

1425
01:04:39.601 --> 01:04:42.260
<v Speaker 3>to be a great seller for Apple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1426
01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:43.123
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when you switch to those </v>

1427
01:04:44.751 --> 01:04:45.584
<v Speaker 3>battery pack cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's now you have a brick in your </v>

1428
01:04:48.981 --> 01:04:50.180
<v Speaker 3>pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's huge.</v>

1429
01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:52.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big phone already too.</v>

1430
01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:56.390
<v Speaker 3>So a six point one inch screen on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>10 hour and then this big battery on the</v>

1431
01:04:56.391 --> 01:04:57.860
<v Speaker 3>back yet it's just going to be massive.</v>

1432
01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:58.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1433
01:04:58.881 --> 01:05:03.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean I haven't seen any excess Max </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a case that has a battery in it,</v>

1434
01:05:03.411 --> 01:05:07.550
<v Speaker 2>but shoes I wouldn't even try finger </v>
<v Speaker 2>pocket anymore,</v>

1435
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:10.130
<v Speaker 2>but it's great if you go on a trip </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere and you.</v>

1436
01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:13.850
<v Speaker 2>You might be in some Janky plays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have.</v>

1437
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:17.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Power like a travel version</v>

1438
01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:18.953
<v Speaker 1>of your setup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1439
01:05:18.970 --> 01:05:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big old brick case.</v>

1440
01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well not a case person.</v>

1441
01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have any cases onto cases you,</v>

1442
01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:29.680
<v Speaker 1>but you switched phones so often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you drop them.</v>

1443
01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:31.930
<v Speaker 1>That's what people say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Papa Sim card out.</v>

1444
01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:33.790
<v Speaker 1>I still take good care of my phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are like,</v>

1445
01:05:33.791 --> 01:05:34.624
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a new phone every two weeks you </v>

1446
01:05:35.681 --> 01:05:36.514
<v Speaker 1>might be right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still take really good care of my </v>

1447
01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:40.540
<v Speaker 1>phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually did kind of getting out of my</v>

1448
01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:42.490
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the slid out of my pocket,</v>

1449
01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:43.983
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of a nightmare and it took</v>
<v Speaker 1>one bounce before I like sort of half </v>

1450
01:05:46.691 --> 01:05:47.524
<v Speaker 1>caught it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got these little scratch on the </v>

1451
01:05:48.851 --> 01:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's google phone,</v>

1452
01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Google phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's fine.</v>

1453
01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:55.890
<v Speaker 1>So I always questioned people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have cases.</v>

1454
01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:56.411
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1455
01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:59.130
<v Speaker 1>you're one of those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Andrew Santino,</v>

1456
01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:02.740
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't put a case on anything and I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have like a good.</v>

1457
01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:05.620
<v Speaker 1>He was a more a design person who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1458
01:06:05.621 --> 01:06:08.110
<v Speaker 1>look how beautiful this case in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of it.</v>

1459
01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.170
<v Speaker 1>But Neil degrasse Tyson had a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting perspective.</v>

1460
01:06:11.350 --> 01:06:12.183
<v Speaker 1>He said he takes his case and he flips </v>
<v Speaker 1>it around in his hand constantly and he </v>

1461
01:06:15.731 --> 01:06:18.400
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to like watch like cadets when</v>

1462
01:06:18.401 --> 01:06:19.234
<v Speaker 1>they're learning how to handle guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're spinning their gun around and </v>

1463
01:06:21.941 --> 01:06:23.620
<v Speaker 1>catching it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you think they're doing that?</v>

1464
01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:27.940
<v Speaker 1>They're doing that so that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>always able to catch their gun no matter</v>

1465
01:06:27.941 --> 01:06:30.450
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the suit.</v>

1466
01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:35.490
<v Speaker 1>He takes his phone and he flips it </v>
<v Speaker 1>around his hand like a cadet.</v>

1467
01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:40.000
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess my phone and he showed me.</v>

1468
01:06:40.001 --> 01:06:41.500
<v Speaker 1>He was like flipping in between his </v>
<v Speaker 1>fingers,</v>

1469
01:06:41.501 --> 01:06:42.610
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1470
01:06:42.611 --> 01:06:44.710
<v Speaker 1>I like seat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's him.</v>

1471
01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:49.090
<v Speaker 1>He's got this next level thought process</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind everything.</v>

1472
01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.680
<v Speaker 1>That's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not having a case.</v>

1473
01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:53.050
<v Speaker 1>That means he's not a case person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always got his phone.</v>

1474
01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

1475
01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:56.710
<v Speaker 1>I actually like your case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this case,</v>

1476
01:06:57.010 --> 01:07:01.390
<v Speaker 1>which is a clear case and the reason why</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it is because it's more grippy in</v>

1477
01:07:01.391 --> 01:07:02.590
<v Speaker 1>your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just.</v>

1478
01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:05.360
<v Speaker 1>There's more to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found a slippery.</v>

1479
01:07:05.361 --> 01:07:07.600
<v Speaker 1>I phones are these slippery as phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their.</v>

1480
01:07:07.601 --> 01:07:08.434
<v Speaker 1>The way they're shaped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the stainless steel and then </v>

1481
01:07:10.001 --> 01:07:10.834
<v Speaker 1>they kind of just melt into this orb </v>
<v Speaker 1>shape and it's by far the most common </v>

1482
01:07:14.681 --> 01:07:16.750
<v Speaker 1>like slide out of my pocket phone is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>iphone.</v>

1483
01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:19.060
<v Speaker 1>This phone was never slid out of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>pocket obviously.</v>

1484
01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.340
<v Speaker 1>And the one plus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1485
01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:24.310
<v Speaker 1>You said that that was your favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone before the Google Pixel three?</v>

1486
01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.313
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you like the Pixel three better </v>

1487
01:07:27.731 --> 01:07:28.564
<v Speaker 1>than that phone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I've heard great things about </v>

1488
01:07:29.861 --> 01:07:30.694
<v Speaker 1>the one plus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the one plus still and I would </v>

1489
01:07:32.261 --> 01:07:33.094
<v Speaker 1>have no problem using it today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this camera is so much better than </v>

1490
01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:36.940
<v Speaker 1>every other phone.</v>

1491
01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:37.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now is that because you took a lot of </v>

1492
01:07:38.981 --> 01:07:43.000
<v Speaker 1>photos for youtube and blogging and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing?</v>

1493
01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just social.</v>

1494
01:07:44.051 --> 01:07:44.884
<v Speaker 1>I tweet a lot of photos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I instagram a lot of photos and I just </v>

1495
01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:48.750
<v Speaker 1>much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1496
01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:53.960
<v Speaker 1>that's much better than the one plus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is already a $600 phone and is the</v>

1497
01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.140
<v Speaker 1>one plus what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean.</v>

1498
01:07:56.141 --> 01:07:56.974
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the galaxy note nine was supposed to </v>

1499
01:07:59.021 --> 01:08:00.520
<v Speaker 1>have a very good cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1500
01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:03.020
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good enough.</v>

1501
01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:04.273
<v Speaker 1>You most people won't until you put them</v>
<v Speaker 1>next to each other and then you kind of </v>

1502
01:08:07.781 --> 01:08:08.411
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1503
01:08:08.411 --> 01:08:09.244
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a much like when you put an </v>

1504
01:08:10.871 --> 01:08:13.780
<v Speaker 1>iphone photo next to a pixel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>photo,</v>

1505
01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:15.880
<v Speaker 1>iphones have matory</v>

1506
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.680
<v Speaker 3>great cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pixels have notoriously great cameras.</v>

1507
01:08:18.681 --> 01:08:20.000
<v Speaker 3>You might be totally fine with either </v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

1508
01:08:20.001 --> 01:08:20.834
<v Speaker 3>but if you put them next to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will notice massive differences </v>

1509
01:08:23.571 --> 01:08:24.770
<v Speaker 3>between the cradles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1510
01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:28.760
<v Speaker 3>So did you notice comparisons that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>online that we could pull up right now?</v>

1511
01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:30.410
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my last one,</v>

1512
01:08:30.411 --> 01:08:35.411
<v Speaker 3>I compare it a pixel to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to iphone 10 to one plus five t,</v>

1513
01:08:37.670 --> 01:08:39.080
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two other phones.</v>

1514
01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:42.470
<v Speaker 3>I did it like a five camera blind test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what I did was I put the five photos</v>

1515
01:08:42.471 --> 01:08:45.060
<v Speaker 3>next to each other but didn't tell you </v>
<v Speaker 3>which one is which ne B,</v>

1516
01:08:45.061 --> 01:08:45.894
<v Speaker 3>c,</v>
<v Speaker 3>d or e.</v>

1517
01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:47.960
<v Speaker 3>and you go down the list and I have like</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>

1518
01:08:47.961 --> 01:08:49.190
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine photos in a row,</v>

1519
01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:49.591
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>b,</v>

1520
01:08:49.591 --> 01:08:50.001
<v Speaker 3>c,</v>
<v Speaker 3>d,</v>

1521
01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:51.080
<v Speaker 3>or e,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pick your favorite one.</v>

1522
01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:52.333
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people went with b.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people went with D and they </v>

1523
01:08:53.901 --> 01:08:54.620
<v Speaker 3>didn't know which one.</v>

1524
01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:58.190
<v Speaker 3>It was not the end I revealed which one </v>
<v Speaker 3>was which,</v>

1525
01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:00.200
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of people were surprised by </v>
<v Speaker 3>which one they picked.</v>

1526
01:09:00.230 --> 01:09:02.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I picked the pixel over the iphone every</v>

1527
01:09:02.751 --> 01:09:03.770
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really interesting.</v>

1528
01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:04.943
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of times when you put them </v>

1529
01:09:06.201 --> 01:09:09.170
<v Speaker 3>side by side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll notice like iphones like to boost</v>

1530
01:09:09.171 --> 01:09:11.590
<v Speaker 3>the shadows a lot more so that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>much more immediately lit.</v>

1531
01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:13.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is that side.</v>

1532
01:09:13.311 --> 01:09:14.300
<v Speaker 3>So like if a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>b,</v>

1533
01:09:14.301 --> 01:09:16.630
<v Speaker 3>c,</v>
<v Speaker 3>D and e,</v>

1534
01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:20.720
<v Speaker 3>which one do I like better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I already can tell immediately which</v>

1535
01:09:20.721 --> 01:09:23.390
<v Speaker 3>ones the pixel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you might not because Iraq,</v>

1536
01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:28.130
<v Speaker 3>I remember Pixel two had cooler colors </v>
<v Speaker 3>and more contrast than any other one.</v>

1537
01:09:28.190 --> 01:09:30.650
<v Speaker 3>And this is a backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1538
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:32.263
<v Speaker 3>So another thing about these is it helps</v>
<v Speaker 3>to see it in a high resolution because </v>

1539
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:36.343
<v Speaker 3>the difference in detail and sharpness </v>
<v Speaker 3>between them is another thing I paid </v>

1540
01:09:39.621 --> 01:09:40.430
<v Speaker 3>attention to.</v>

1541
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:43.610
<v Speaker 3>Which ones he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say that was the one plus,</v>

1542
01:09:43.611 --> 01:09:44.444
<v Speaker 3>but I forget now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure be as the pixel because </v>

1543
01:09:47.421 --> 01:09:48.254
<v Speaker 3>this backpack is starting to look a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit blue and that was a big </v>

1544
01:09:50.961 --> 01:09:51.794
<v Speaker 3>characteristic of the pixel two from </v>
<v Speaker 3>last year and that was a big issue with </v>

1545
01:09:56.001 --> 01:09:59.450
<v Speaker 3>the screen as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right to the Pixel xl?</v>

1546
01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:00.343
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this contrast like you see like </v>

1547
01:10:01.821 --> 01:10:02.654
<v Speaker 3>all these are like pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you see B and you see how much </v>

1548
01:10:05.031 --> 01:10:08.270
<v Speaker 3>more contrast that has and you look at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how much it's lifted.</v>

1549
01:10:08.271 --> 01:10:09.710
<v Speaker 3>The shadows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1550
01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:10.573
<v Speaker 3>He's got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a pretty even tone and is also </v>

1551
01:10:12.861 --> 01:10:15.200
<v Speaker 3>the one plus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what it is.</v>

1552
01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:18.710
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to go back to the video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>switched them around one every time.</v>

1553
01:10:18.711 --> 01:10:21.290
<v Speaker 3>It was the same as the same every time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>B is the same every time.</v>

1554
01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:24.260
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm already pretty sure that B is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pixel.</v>

1555
01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.420
<v Speaker 3>Go to a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to the top left one with the selfie.</v>

1556
01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.610
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that gray sweatshirt,</v>

1557
01:10:31.611 --> 01:10:34.910
<v Speaker 3>it starting to look at blue and be right</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

1558
01:10:34.911 --> 01:10:37.070
<v Speaker 3>He become much higher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brighter.</v>

1559
01:10:37.071 --> 01:10:37.904
<v Speaker 3>Those shadows are like my black hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks kind of gray at that point in </v>

1560
01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:41.893
<v Speaker 3>that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of things you don't </v>

1561
01:10:42.621 --> 01:10:47.000
<v Speaker 3>notice until you put them side by side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so nitpicky,</v>

1562
01:10:47.001 --> 01:10:50.570
<v Speaker 3>they all look so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all look pretty much like the same.</v>

1563
01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:52.670
<v Speaker 3>So you never see your little parallel </v>
<v Speaker 3>syrup?</v>

1564
01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:54.440
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See is a little bit tighter.</v>

1565
01:10:54.441 --> 01:10:56.430
<v Speaker 3>So I'm gonna go see as the iphone </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the iphone has,</v>

1566
01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:59.630
<v Speaker 3>has a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of a tighter selfie camera.</v>

1567
01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.393
<v Speaker 3>A lot of android phones have a wider </v>
<v Speaker 3>angle selfie camera because you can fit </v>

1568
01:11:03.891 --> 01:11:04.724
<v Speaker 3>more people in them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But apple's always told me they go with </v>

1569
01:11:06.561 --> 01:11:09.230
<v Speaker 3>a tighter angle because there's less </v>
<v Speaker 3>distortion and they want it to feel more</v>

1570
01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:10.064
<v Speaker 3>natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just take a picture of yourself and </v>

1571
01:11:11.001 --> 01:11:11.834
<v Speaker 3>you look great.</v>

1572
01:11:14.290 --> 01:11:15.720
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iphone X.</v>

1573
01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:18.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know it too in hassle.</v>

1574
01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.130
<v Speaker 3>But I did add a real camera into the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Into the mix.</v>

1575
01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:24.450
<v Speaker 3>Can I wrote was preferred good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1576
01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:25.980
<v Speaker 3>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's $10,000.</v>

1577
01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:28.470
<v Speaker 3>That was a real camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Better look.</v>

1578
01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:32.340
<v Speaker 3>Pretty good film or is that a or?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a photo.</v>

1579
01:11:32.341 --> 01:11:33.870
<v Speaker 3>So it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a medium format.</v>

1580
01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:36.540
<v Speaker 3>Fifty Megapixel Hasselblad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

1581
01:11:36.570 --> 01:11:37.403
<v Speaker 3>It's a crazy camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iphone x was pretty God damn good right </v>

1582
01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:40.050
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does,</v>

1583
01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:43.770
<v Speaker 3>but there's just a little bit more to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Pixel to pixel.</v>

1584
01:11:43.771 --> 01:11:46.470
<v Speaker 3>Two has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is a portrait mode comparison.</v>

1585
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:47.423
<v Speaker 3>So I remember I was trying to test like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the blurry background versus an actual </v>

1586
01:11:50.641 --> 01:11:51.474
<v Speaker 3>good camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And whenever you look at these portrait </v>

1587
01:11:53.521 --> 01:11:54.354
<v Speaker 3>mode photos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing is they're sort of </v>

1588
01:11:55.351 --> 01:11:56.184
<v Speaker 3>trying to outline the subject,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep it sharp and then blur the </v>

1589
01:11:59.611 --> 01:12:00.444
<v Speaker 3>background artificially and year after </v>
<v Speaker 3>year they've gotten better at this </v>

1590
01:12:02.821 --> 01:12:06.690
<v Speaker 3>because the fall off between the blur </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't just like a cut out in real life.</v>

1591
01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:10.320
<v Speaker 3>You get sort of like a gradient of how </v>
<v Speaker 3>much blur you have.</v>

1592
01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:11.543
<v Speaker 3>So Pixel two has typically the sharpest </v>
<v Speaker 3>cut out and the best like separation </v>

1593
01:12:15.901 --> 01:12:20.460
<v Speaker 3>between the background where the iphone </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of just takes the face,</v>

1594
01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:24.270
<v Speaker 3>keeps the face sharp and then sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>has a more natural fall off.</v>

1595
01:12:24.271 --> 01:12:29.271
<v Speaker 3>So your body might not be at infocus uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and note eight as it's just not as good.</v>

1596
01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that image,</v>

1597
01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:35.550
<v Speaker 3>that's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that in that one you really see how good</v>

1598
01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:36.880
<v Speaker 3>the pixel two is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1599
01:12:37.150 --> 01:12:39.420
<v Speaker 3>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it takes all three.</v>

1600
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:41.940
<v Speaker 3>Got Better at that actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1601
01:12:41.941 --> 01:12:43.530
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now you can change.</v>

1602
01:12:43.531 --> 01:12:44.364
<v Speaker 3>Something note was doing last year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can change how blur the background </v>

1603
01:12:46.501 --> 01:12:49.380
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So an iphone 10 s now pixel three,</v>

1604
01:12:49.381 --> 01:12:50.580
<v Speaker 3>note nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of them.</v>

1605
01:12:50.581 --> 01:12:52.620
<v Speaker 3>You can change how blurry the background</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

1606
01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.040
<v Speaker 3>Now I noticed you have an apple watch on</v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

1607
01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:00.200
<v Speaker 3>I do that Smart Watch and the game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is I'm a is by a lot by a lot.</v>

<v Speaker 3>By Lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1609
01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:06.120
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm an iphone person really </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the watch.</v>

1610
01:13:06.121 --> 01:13:10.560
<v Speaker 3>I carry two phones all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An android phone of choice and an iphone</v>

1611
01:13:10.561 --> 01:13:11.394
<v Speaker 3>of choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my android phone of choice is my </v>

1612
01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:14.820
<v Speaker 3>pixel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the main number.</v>

1613
01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:15.713
<v Speaker 3>The main phone I usually use a and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>iphone of choice of carry because </v>

1614
01:13:19.191 --> 01:13:20.024
<v Speaker 3>there's still things that I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>iphones do better and I always carry </v>

1615
01:13:21.931 --> 01:13:23.970
<v Speaker 3>whatever the best iphone is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of things.</v>

1616
01:13:23.971 --> 01:13:27.070
<v Speaker 3>It's media related.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like whenever I'm airdropping,</v>

1617
01:13:27.071 --> 01:13:28.650
<v Speaker 3>like when I'm publishing a video on the </v>

<v Speaker 3>like I have the thumbnail from airdrop </v>
<v Speaker 3>on this phone,</v>

1619
01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:33.720
<v Speaker 3>but just things like snapchat and </v>

1620
01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:34.613
<v Speaker 3>instagram stories and instagram live a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of apps with camera stuff or better </v>

1621
01:13:39.811 --> 01:13:40.644
<v Speaker 3>optimized on the iphone than they are on</v>
<v Speaker 3>any android phone because they're built </v>

1622
01:13:43.651 --> 01:13:44.484
<v Speaker 3>for iphone.</v>

1623
01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:49.880
<v Speaker 3>So I carry an iphone and the best smart </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch is the Apple Watch stories for.</v>

1624
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:52.680

<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>

1626
01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:57.900
<v Speaker 3>But you don't get text messages on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>Apple Watch them now?</v>

1627
01:13:57.901 --> 01:13:58.940

<v Speaker 3>kind of.</v>

1630
01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:07.500
<v Speaker 3>I would love to be able to use a </v>
<v Speaker 3>smartwatch and this good with my android</v>

1631
01:14:07.501 --> 01:14:10.440

1632
01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:13.510
<v Speaker 3>but I'm mainly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm using this for fitness tracking now,</v>

1633
01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:14.613
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like keeping track of workouts and </v>

1634
01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:20.170
<v Speaker 3>calories and standing hours and all this</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1635
01:14:20.171 --> 01:14:21.004
<v Speaker 3>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty cool.</v>

1636
01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:22.023
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This</v>

1637
01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:25.160
<v Speaker 2>talking to you before the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the sober October fitness challenge,</v>

1638
01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:27.650
<v Speaker 2>we're doing this the first time I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever worn a heart monitor.</v>

1639
01:14:27.710 --> 01:14:30.140
<v Speaker 2>And then the scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual scores,</v>

1640
01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.233
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a real crazy motivating factor </v>

1641
01:14:33.621 --> 01:14:35.270
<v Speaker 2>of seeing an actual number.</v>

1642
01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:36.163
<v Speaker 3>The game of gamifying of fitness is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really entertaining to me and that's </v>

1643
01:14:40.371 --> 01:14:41.204
<v Speaker 3>what's kept me like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've usually don't wear a smart watch </v>

1644
01:14:43.221 --> 01:14:44.054
<v Speaker 3>for very long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's been about a month and </v>

1645
01:14:45.351 --> 01:14:46.184
<v Speaker 3>I just keep like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a feature now where you can </v>

1646
01:14:48.111 --> 01:14:48.944
<v Speaker 3>challenge people to a one week long </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge to whoever burns the most </v>

1647
01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:56.330
<v Speaker 3>calories and it has the most points or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was like a point system.</v>

1648
01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:57.253
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that gamification of fitness has </v>

1649
01:14:59.181 --> 01:14:59.931
<v Speaker 3>been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1650
01:14:59.931 --> 01:15:01.760
<v Speaker 3>pretty special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been pretty good.</v>

1651
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:05.090
<v Speaker 3>Well this contest has been really crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>with me and my friends.</v>

1652
01:15:05.150 --> 01:15:05.990
<v Speaker 3>So what are you trying to do?</v>

1653
01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:10.300
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the winter is going to get a belt,</v>

1654
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:12.640
<v Speaker 2>like a wwe style belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

1655
01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:17.641
<v Speaker 2>It says intergalactic sober October </v>
<v Speaker 2>champion and it has like</v>

1656
01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:22.080
<v Speaker 3>marijuana leaf with the line through it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a bottle of booze,</v>

1657
01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:24.280
<v Speaker 3>the line through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1658
01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:26.000
<v Speaker 3>you were these things.</v>

1659
01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:31.500
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called a mile zone and it,</v>

1660
01:15:31.770 --> 01:15:35.260
<v Speaker 2>it works with an APP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It works pretty good and it,</v>

1661
01:15:35.261 --> 01:15:38.910
<v Speaker 2>it registers your amount of your heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>rate,</v>

1662
01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:42.540
<v Speaker 2>the amount of calories you burn and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>gives you a point system.</v>

1663
01:15:42.541 --> 01:15:44.500
<v Speaker 2>And the point system is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it,</v>

1664
01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:47.190
<v Speaker 2>what they call it's m e P eps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it stands for,</v>

1665
01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:48.413
<v Speaker 2>but this is the amount of points over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the month is what everyone's shooting </v>

1666
01:15:53.851 --> 01:15:54.570
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1667
01:15:54.570 --> 01:15:55.403
<v Speaker 2>And so today were at October the 23rd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we have eight days to go and I have </v>

1668
01:16:01.411 --> 01:16:02.244
<v Speaker 2>worked out more in these 23 days than I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have in the last six months and I'm not </v>

1669
01:16:06.121 --> 01:16:07.110
<v Speaker 2>exaggerating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1670
01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:10.170
<v Speaker 2>I put in five and a half hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday.</v>

1671
01:16:10.890 --> 01:16:13.230
<v Speaker 2>Hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got more than 900 points.</v>

1672
01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.273
<v Speaker 2>Then after the podcast I said fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go for another hundred </v>

1673
01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:19.530
<v Speaker 2>and I worked out and I've got another </v>
<v Speaker 2>100 points.</v>

1674
01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:22.860
<v Speaker 2>Put in another hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's maniacal because you,</v>

1675
01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:26.940
<v Speaker 2>you actually see the number and because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see the number,</v>

1676
01:16:26.941 --> 01:16:30.540
<v Speaker 2>I could see all my friends' numbers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm way ahead.</v>

1677
01:16:30.541 --> 01:16:31.374
<v Speaker 2>So I'm what I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just keep telling them that I'm </v>

1678
01:16:32.671 --> 01:16:35.700
<v Speaker 2>twisting the blade because I'm so far </v>
<v Speaker 2>ahead.</v>

1679
01:16:35.701 --> 01:16:36.534
<v Speaker 2>Like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am 1500 points away from everybody </v>

1680
01:16:40.381 --> 01:16:42.780
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All births trying to work out again,</v>

1681
01:16:42.781 --> 01:16:45.930
<v Speaker 2>that Slob.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you see somebody catching up,</v>

1682
01:16:45.931 --> 01:16:46.860
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I better hit the gym.</v>

1683
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:48.510
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1684
01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:49.513
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm planning on staying so far ahead </v>

1685
01:16:51.631 --> 01:16:54.510
<v Speaker 2>that they must die in order to beat me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

1686
01:16:54.690 --> 01:16:55.523
<v Speaker 3>the iphone or the Apple Watch when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have people connected with the fitness </v>

1687
01:16:58.801 --> 01:16:59.634
<v Speaker 3>part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will literally notify me when one of </v>

1688
01:17:01.471 --> 01:17:05.760
<v Speaker 3>my friends has finished a workout and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me like how good there were,</v>

1689
01:17:05.761 --> 01:17:08.610
<v Speaker 3>how many points they just got as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>finish it.</v>

1690
01:17:08.611 --> 01:17:10.640
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hit the finish button and you know,</v>

1691
01:17:10.641 --> 01:17:13.520
<v Speaker 3>everyone's getting a notification like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>

1692
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:16.160
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to put in the extra four or</v>
<v Speaker 3>five miles on the bike.</v>

1693
01:17:16.161 --> 01:17:19.160
<v Speaker 3>So they get that notification that I did</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and that really does work</v>

1694
01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:20.013
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1695
01:17:20.170 --> 01:17:22.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1696
01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:27.010
<v Speaker 2>Just having that external motivating </v>
<v Speaker 2>factor and then seeing a number.</v>

1697
01:17:27.011 --> 01:17:29.350
<v Speaker 2>There's something about like with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the meps,</v>

1698
01:17:29.351 --> 01:17:31.300
<v Speaker 2>mtps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck that stands for,</v>

1699
01:17:31.330 --> 01:17:33.050
<v Speaker 2>find out what that stands for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what that stands</v>

1700
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:35.750
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know how the Apple Watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>measures points either.</v>

1701
01:17:35.751 --> 01:17:37.610
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's measuring.</v>

1702
01:17:37.670 --> 01:17:39.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of sensors in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

1703
01:17:39.231 --> 01:17:42.080
<v Speaker 3>so not only as a heart rate monitor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an accelerometer and a gyroscope</v>

1704
01:17:42.081 --> 01:17:46.540
<v Speaker 3>so it knows when you're standing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knows when you're moving quickly and I.</v>

1705
01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:50.310
<v Speaker 3>It basically just comes up with a points</v>
<v Speaker 3>number at the end of the day and I.</v>

1706
01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:52.910
<v Speaker 3>Every time I fly I just don't get any </v>
<v Speaker 3>points because I just sit there.</v>

1707
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.080
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1708
01:17:54.081 --> 01:17:54.914
<v Speaker 3>there's like a live counter constantly </v>
<v Speaker 3>going of like you and your friends and </v>

1709
01:17:59.631 --> 01:18:00.710
<v Speaker 3>you got to have the highest number.</v>

1710
01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:05.090
<v Speaker 2>So out of all the stuff that you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>during my zone effort points,</v>

1711
01:18:05.091 --> 01:18:06.470
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the maps points.</v>

1712
01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:07.513
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing about that maps </v>
<v Speaker 2>points and we were trying to figure out </v>

1713
01:18:09.441 --> 01:18:10.274
<v Speaker 2>why it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives you the same amount of points </v>

1714
01:18:12.801 --> 01:18:15.740
<v Speaker 2>for 80 percent of your Max heart rate as</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does for 90.</v>

1715
01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:16.753
<v Speaker 2>So like the first day I said I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to sprint and try to bury these </v>

1716
01:18:19.611 --> 01:18:20.444
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I put them in 90 percent for 35 </v>

1717
01:18:23.331 --> 01:18:24.620
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1718
01:18:24.650 --> 01:18:25.483
<v Speaker 2>they can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to do some shit they </v>

1719
01:18:26.511 --> 01:18:27.344
<v Speaker 2>can't do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't give you any more points </v>

1720
01:18:29.001 --> 01:18:31.250
<v Speaker 2>for 90 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ninety percent gives the exact amount of</v>

1721
01:18:31.251 --> 01:18:33.340
<v Speaker 2>points is 80 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's there on proprietary.</v>

1722
01:18:33.370 --> 01:18:36.170
<v Speaker 2>See those two?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fibers piece of shit.</v>

1723
01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:37.760
<v Speaker 2>So uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so dumb.</v>

1724
01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:38.683
<v Speaker 2>So I think the reason why they did that </v>
<v Speaker 2>as to keep people from killing </v>

1725
01:18:40.581 --> 01:18:41.750
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I think,</v>

1726
01:18:42.370 --> 01:18:43.203
<v Speaker 2>which makes just get somewhere in the 80</v>
<v Speaker 2>to 90 range that Bert is always in the </v>

1727
01:18:46.431 --> 01:18:49.730
<v Speaker 2>two and three fat bird never gets in </v>
<v Speaker 2>yellow.</v>

1728
01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:52.580
<v Speaker 2>That slob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just modeling around,</v>

1729
01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.720
<v Speaker 2>waddling around with blue and green.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mostly gray gets a lot of gray.</v>

1730
01:18:56.721 --> 01:18:59.870
<v Speaker 2>He'll get gray for hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just waddling complaining,</v>

1731
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:02.570
<v Speaker 2>thinking about vodka,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dreaming about food.</v>

1732
01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:05.980
<v Speaker 2>He's going to watch this and hit the gym</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately on the gym.</v>

1733
01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:06.913
<v Speaker 2>The Gym right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's at the gym right now trying to </v>

1734
01:19:09.171 --> 01:19:11.900
<v Speaker 2>catch up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So always playing catch up.</v>

1735
01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing you gotta stay,</v>

1736
01:19:14.890 --> 01:19:17.710
<v Speaker 2>you gotta stay ahead like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you fall behind in the distance,</v>

1737
01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:20.300
<v Speaker 2>you got to think of them as wolves </v>
<v Speaker 2>barking in the distance,</v>

1738
01:19:20.301 --> 01:19:21.134
<v Speaker 2>chasing it like no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not eating me bitch wolves 10 </v>

1739
01:19:24.051 --> 01:19:24.884
<v Speaker 2>miles away and not going to get you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but wolves a hundred yards away they </v>

1740
01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:29.350
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get now they're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to kiss you.</v>

1741
01:19:29.351 --> 01:19:30.021
<v Speaker 2>You gotTa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotTa.</v>

1742
01:19:30.021 --> 01:19:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Keep the distance 10 miles away too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ten miles that you want to hear.</v>

1743
01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:36.600
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1744
01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:40.480
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to be at least just slob.</v>

1745
01:19:40.481 --> 01:19:42.360
<v Speaker 2>He said he's going to double everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

1746
01:19:42.570 --> 01:19:44.640
<v Speaker 2>Look at fat face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not even possible.</v>

1747
01:19:46.050 --> 01:19:48.480
<v Speaker 5>I brought my dog up here to fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1748
01:19:48.481 --> 01:19:49.790
<v Speaker 5>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all so broken.</v>

1749
01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:54.460
<v Speaker 2>Stop this before I throw up the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so far behind.</v>

1750
01:19:54.461 --> 01:19:57.970
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible to win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the point.</v>

1751
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.030
<v Speaker 2>The point is to keep the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To keep the boot on his neck.</v>

1752
01:20:01.170 --> 01:20:02.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>

1753
01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:04.800
<v Speaker 3>This only does seven day challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you basically like you get,</v>

1754
01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 3>you start it and they accept then </v>
<v Speaker 3>accounts for the next</v>

1755
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:09.810
<v Speaker 1>seven days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all your cumulative points.</v>

1756
01:20:10.230 --> 01:20:11.063
<v Speaker 1>Well that would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you just do for and they can just </v>

1757
01:20:12.811 --> 01:20:13.610
<v Speaker 1>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1758
01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:14.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Over.</v>

1759
01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1760
01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:18.290
<v Speaker 1>I like the challenge aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really mean.</v>

1761
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:21.060
<v Speaker 1>All jokes aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been really fun with my friends.</v>

1762
01:20:21.061 --> 01:20:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Poor Tommy Buns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way behind what was going on.</v>

1763
01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Thomson [inaudible] way behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like 1800 points behind me.</v>

1764
01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Warn them up as he like saving for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of days.</v>

1765
01:20:32.401 --> 01:20:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be sandbagged.</v>

1766
01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:39.210
<v Speaker 1>Then just comes full strength all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You saw you store them up in,</v>

1767
01:20:39.211 --> 01:20:43.320
<v Speaker 1>you're in this device and then you sync </v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can pretend that you're not doing</v>

1768
01:20:43.321 --> 01:20:45.190
<v Speaker 1>any work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could sand bag.</v>

1769
01:20:45.210 --> 01:20:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knows.</v>

1770
01:20:46.921 --> 01:20:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Then the last day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you son of a bitch shows online.</v>

1771
01:20:49.561 --> 01:20:50.710
<v Speaker 1>He's 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>points ahead.</v>

1772
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a real issue.</v>

1773
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:56.070
<v Speaker 1>So the key is just keep the work rate at</v>
<v Speaker 1>an almost impossible level.</v>

1774
01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:57.420
<v Speaker 1>So like yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1775
01:20:57.421 --> 01:21:02.190
<v Speaker 1>I worked out five and a half hours and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then another hour and today I've already</v>

1776
01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:04.290
<v Speaker 1>put in two hours and put in two hours at</v>
<v Speaker 1>7:00</v>

1777
01:21:04.291 --> 01:21:06.690
<v Speaker 1>this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I tell her it doesn't have any.</v>

1778
01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.600
<v Speaker 1>The thing is I'm putting two hours in at</v>
<v Speaker 1>yellow,</v>

1779
01:21:09.630 --> 01:21:12.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm hitting 80 percent for two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fat Burn out,</v>

1780
01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:15.690
<v Speaker 1>they're waddling around with his dog </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretending he's working hard,</v>

1781
01:21:15.691 --> 01:21:17.220
<v Speaker 1>making videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1782
01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:19.950
<v Speaker 1>he's got like gray and a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>blue.</v>

1783
01:21:19.951 --> 01:21:23.370
<v Speaker 1>He maybe green who agree and then he </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes a break.</v>

1784
01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Cries and his numbers are low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're lower than mine.</v>

1785
01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:34.410
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked out more yesterday,</v>

1786
01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:37.470
<v Speaker 1>last night and this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he has an a whole day.</v>

1787
01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:40.710
<v Speaker 1>He knows my problem when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I play Frisbee,</v>

1788
01:21:40.711 --> 01:21:44.460
<v Speaker 1>so I take the watch off when I played </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a risk thing.</v>

1789
01:21:44.570 --> 01:21:46.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm constantly mutating.</v>

1790
01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Play like Frisbee disc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimate Frisbee.</v>

1791
01:21:50.251 --> 01:21:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Ultimate Frisbee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1792
01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:54.840
<v Speaker 1>So I take it off every time I play and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that's thousands of points that I'm</v>

1793
01:21:54.841 --> 01:21:55.674
<v Speaker 1>missing out on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is disc golf versus ultimate </v>

1794
01:21:57.331 --> 01:22:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Frisbee disc golf is what it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

1795
01:22:01.021 --> 01:22:01.854
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you play nine or 18 holes and you're </v>

1796
01:22:03.991 --> 01:22:08.550
<v Speaker 1>throwing in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking up or you throwing a Frisbee and</v>

1797
01:22:08.551 --> 01:22:09.384
<v Speaker 1>look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna.</v>

1798
01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Get an Air Sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So ultimate Frisbee is different.</v>

1799
01:22:12.121 --> 01:22:17.121
<v Speaker 1>Ultimate Frisbee you can think of as </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like football slash basketball,</v>

1800
01:22:18.430 --> 01:22:21.360
<v Speaker 1>throwing that Frisbee with the left and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right hand.</v>

1801
01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly one end.</v>

1802
01:22:23.130 --> 01:22:23.963
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you throw a little offhand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you switch the sucker to the </v>

1803
01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:27.550
<v Speaker 1>lefthand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1804
01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:28.500
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1805
01:22:28.501 --> 01:22:29.334
<v Speaker 1>there's something about wearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something on my wrist of like throwing </v>

1806
01:22:31.201 --> 01:22:34.200
<v Speaker 1>and catching and it's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so serious about it.</v>

1807
01:22:34.201 --> 01:22:35.830
<v Speaker 1>You're willing to lose points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1808
01:22:36.150 --> 01:22:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I really had to wear it for a week to</v>

1809
01:22:38.551 --> 01:22:42.060
<v Speaker 1>get really playing competitive here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1810
01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:42.923
<v Speaker 1>So this is all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure this is all pro </v>

1811
01:22:43.921 --> 01:22:46.380
<v Speaker 1>highlights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you guys are pro.</v>

1812
01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:47.273
<v Speaker 1>There's professional ultimate Frisbee </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and you're playing professionally </v>

1813
01:22:50.130 --> 01:22:52.080

<v Speaker 1>Ultimate Frisbee.</v>

1814
01:22:52.170 --> 01:22:56.310

<v Speaker 1>This actually looks really fun.</v>

1815
01:22:56.410 --> 01:22:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of.</v>

<v Speaker 1>psychologist called,</v>

1824
01:23:20.251 --> 01:23:23.440
<v Speaker 1>which is a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just roof to roof to roof.</v>

1825
01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Is that an ultimate Frisbee?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all kinds of uh,</v>

1826
01:23:26.850 --> 01:23:27.451
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1827
01:23:27.451 --> 01:23:28.284
<v Speaker 1>there's a term for a common one is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>skyride someone but roofed I like </v>

1828
01:23:32.551 --> 01:23:34.470
<v Speaker 1>because it's a disc and it's above his </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

1829
01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:35.553
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you asked somebody what does </v>

1830
01:23:37.201 --> 01:23:39.780
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you lost someone like Randy Moss.</v>

1831
01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wearing muscle went out for football</v>

1832
01:23:41.701 --> 01:23:44.760
<v Speaker 1>and his chest is out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your like at your head level.</v>

1833
01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:49.290
<v Speaker 1>That's what someone looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's other words for it.</v>

1834
01:23:49.291 --> 01:23:50.124
<v Speaker 1>So you might reach someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you're doing this </v>

1835
01:23:51.901 --> 01:23:54.840
<v Speaker 1>without your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your sensor on because you're so serious</v>

1836
01:23:54.841 --> 01:23:55.750
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody.</v>

1837
01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're losing so many points.</v>

1838
01:23:58.890 --> 01:23:59.723
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you do any strength and conditioning </v>

1839
01:24:01.021 --> 01:24:02.700
<v Speaker 1>to prepare for this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1840
01:24:02.701 --> 01:24:06.300
<v Speaker 1>So the season is a couple of months </v>
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

1841
01:24:06.330 --> 01:24:09.330
<v Speaker 1>So yes I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in the off season now.</v>

1842
01:24:09.331 --> 01:24:12.720
<v Speaker 1>This season just ended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're just basically rebuilding.</v>

1843
01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:15.720
<v Speaker 1>I lose 15 pounds during the season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm putting that up</v>

1844
01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:16.573
<v Speaker 3>back on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you get to like try out season in </v>

1845
01:24:18.261 --> 01:24:21.270
<v Speaker 3>like February or March.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1846
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:23.080
<v Speaker 3>and then you just start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1847
01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:25.730
<v Speaker 3>getting a throws back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting your cardio back and starting to</v>

1848
01:24:25.731 --> 01:24:27.230
<v Speaker 3>work into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the season starts.</v>

1849
01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:31.040
<v Speaker 1>I would think that like leg strength and</v>
<v Speaker 1>explosive power,</v>

1850
01:24:31.041 --> 01:24:33.950
<v Speaker 1>like doing box jumps and things along </v>
<v Speaker 1>those lines would be huge for you.</v>

1851
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1852
01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:36.540
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's different,</v>

1853
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:39.900
<v Speaker 3>like sort of like basketball or </v>
<v Speaker 3>football.</v>

1854
01:24:39.901 --> 01:24:41.820
<v Speaker 3>There's different sort of types of </v>
<v Speaker 3>players.</v>

1855
01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can sort of diff.</v>

1856
01:24:45.690 --> 01:24:47.220
<v Speaker 3>There's so many things to explain with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Frisbee.</v>

1857
01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.530
<v Speaker 3>There's a throwers and catchers you </v>
<v Speaker 3>might call them,</v>

1858
01:24:49.531 --> 01:24:52.860
<v Speaker 3>so handlers and receivers a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>shorter,</v>

1859
01:24:52.861 --> 01:24:53.694
<v Speaker 3>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who aren't as explosive but are </v>

1860
01:24:55.501 --> 01:24:56.430
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really quick.</v>

1861
01:24:56.630 --> 01:24:57.463
<v Speaker 3>Our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our handlers now go around the squirrel </v>

1862
01:24:58.951 --> 01:24:59.784
<v Speaker 3>around and they'll have awesome strength</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they'll be able to throw it </v>

1863
01:25:02.491 --> 01:25:03.324
<v Speaker 3>anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they won't necessarily go downfield </v>

1864
01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:08.860
<v Speaker 3>and try to go score on someone because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not as tall or as explosive.</v>

1865
01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:12.690
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of cutters are receivers are.</v>

1866
01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.850
<v Speaker 3>You can think of sort of like a wide </v>
<v Speaker 3>receiver in football,</v>

1867
01:25:14.851 --> 01:25:15.684
<v Speaker 3>they're going down field in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the athletes going and making plays in </v>

1868
01:25:18.451 --> 01:25:20.760
<v Speaker 3>the air and they're hard to guard down </v>
<v Speaker 3>field,</v>

1869
01:25:20.761 --> 01:25:23.160
<v Speaker 3>but they're not necessarily scrolling </v>
<v Speaker 3>around throwing a lot.</v>

1870
01:25:23.190 --> 01:25:24.023
<v Speaker 3>They're mostly just catching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dumping it off to another thrower and </v>

1871
01:25:26.161 --> 01:25:30.030
<v Speaker 3>then going for some more yards again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you watch a game unfold,</v>

1872
01:25:30.031 --> 01:25:30.864
<v Speaker 3>it's very fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You constantly switched between offense </v>

1873
01:25:33.091 --> 01:25:34.380
<v Speaker 3>and defense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like basketball,</v>

1874
01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:35.333
<v Speaker 3>you're scoring and an end zone and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>the points over and then you pull again </v>

1875
01:25:37.771 --> 01:25:40.560
<v Speaker 3>to start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as the points going on,</v>

1876
01:25:40.561 --> 01:25:44.700
<v Speaker 3>you kind of notice like certain players </v>
<v Speaker 3>are mostly doing certain things,</v>

1877
01:25:44.701 --> 01:25:47.040
<v Speaker 3>like mostly throwing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly getting the disc back.</v>

1878
01:25:47.250 --> 01:25:50.400
<v Speaker 3>Other people are mostly going downfield,</v>
<v Speaker 3>threatening deep.</v>

1879
01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:53.640
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of terminology you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in this.</v>

1880
01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:55.350
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the high school I went to,</v>

1881
01:25:55.351 --> 01:25:58.260
<v Speaker 3>Columbia high school invented this sport</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 1968.</v>

1882
01:25:59.080 --> 01:25:59.913
<v Speaker 3>Had a very competitive team for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>years that I was there and I made a lot </v>

1883
01:26:01.951 --> 01:26:02.784
<v Speaker 3>of friends on the team playing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played for the JV team for the first </v>

1884
01:26:05.721 --> 01:26:09.200
<v Speaker 3>two years and then I played for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Varsity team my second two years,</v>

1885
01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:13.100
<v Speaker 3>so it was pretty serious program and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>played against other high schools around</v>

1886
01:26:13.101 --> 01:26:13.640
<v Speaker 3>the country.</v>

1887
01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:16.640
<v Speaker 3>We traveled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we flew play against.</v>

1888
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:21.650
<v Speaker 3>We had rivals in Massachusetts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Connecticut and all these other schools,</v>

1889
01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:22.873
<v Speaker 3>and then we had the big eastern </v>
<v Speaker 3>championship at the end of the high </v>

1890
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:26.420
<v Speaker 3>school season.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

1891
01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:27.253
<v Speaker 3>that's what we all played for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We won 11 straight state championships </v>

1892
01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:33.560
<v Speaker 3>the two years that I played.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

1893
01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not know that.</v>

1894
01:26:35.541 --> 01:26:38.450
<v Speaker 3>This was even a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They dealt as a rich history to it.</v>

1895
01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:39.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tea.</v>

1896
01:26:39.770 --> 01:26:41.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>50th anniversary this year.</v>

1897
01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:43.640
<v Speaker 3>That is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would've never guessed.</v>

1898
01:26:43.641 --> 01:26:45.480
<v Speaker 3>You said one was ultimate frisbee </v>
<v Speaker 3>invented.</v>

1899
01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:47.590
<v Speaker 3>I would say like a couple months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1900
01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:51.230
<v Speaker 3>Well it's so the pro league just is less</v>
<v Speaker 3>than 10 years old,</v>

1901
01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:53.210
<v Speaker 3>so there's always been this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>club.</v>

1902
01:26:53.211 --> 01:26:54.160
<v Speaker 3>You think of clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>soccer,</v>

1903
01:26:54.161 --> 01:26:56.000
<v Speaker 3>like area teams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always been that.</v>

1904
01:26:56.001 --> 01:26:56.834
<v Speaker 3>So I've played for the New Jersey Garden</v>
<v Speaker 3>State Club team for much longer than I </v>

1905
01:27:00.321 --> 01:27:01.154
<v Speaker 3>played for any proteins and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>generally what players take the most </v>

1906
01:27:04.101 --> 01:27:04.730
<v Speaker 3>seriously.</v>

1907
01:27:04.730 --> 01:27:07.160
<v Speaker 3>The club championships were this past </v>
<v Speaker 3>weekend,</v>

1908
01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:12.110
<v Speaker 3>the New York area team beat the San </v>
<v Speaker 3>Francisco area team to win nationals.</v>

1909
01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.930
<v Speaker 3>Like that's generally what people care </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most about,</v>

1910
01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:20.560
<v Speaker 3>but it's not very spectator friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what we've sort of created is the Adl</v>

1911
01:27:22.301 --> 01:27:27.050
<v Speaker 3>is the American ultimate disc league.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a pro version of Frisbee.</v>

1912
01:27:27.051 --> 01:27:29.570
<v Speaker 3>It's mainly the same sport but a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger field,</v>

1913
01:27:29.950 --> 01:27:30.783
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a little bit faster play just </v>

1914
01:27:33.291 --> 01:27:34.124
<v Speaker 3>because they've shortened the stoppages </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have referees and everything </v>

1915
01:27:35.961 --> 01:27:36.794
<v Speaker 3>now and there is selling tickets and </v>
<v Speaker 3>selling merchant and jerseys and like </v>

1916
01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:44.720
<v Speaker 3>broadcasting games and they have a pro </v>
<v Speaker 3>championship at the end of the year.</v>

1917
01:27:45.230 --> 01:27:46.063
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been like a whole new thing for </v>

1918
01:27:48.681 --> 01:27:50.690
<v Speaker 3>frisbee players to pay attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've,</v>

1919
01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:51.853
<v Speaker 3>I've played for a protein as well as </v>
<v Speaker 3>past couple years and it's been pretty </v>

1920
01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:56.150
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I bought it because,</v>

1921
01:27:56.151 --> 01:27:58.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean just watching that clip was </v>
<v Speaker 3>really exciting.</v>

1922
01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:00.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks fun and you guys aren't getting</v>

1923
01:28:00.651 --> 01:28:03.140
<v Speaker 3>any brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big deal.</v>

1924
01:28:03.141 --> 01:28:05.870
<v Speaker 3>It's about the same level of contact is </v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball I would say.</v>

1925
01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:06.853
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're not like throwing elbows or </v>

1926
01:28:08.361 --> 01:28:10.760
<v Speaker 3>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are false so you got to be careful</v>

1927
01:28:10.761 --> 01:28:11.900
<v Speaker 3>about where you're throwing your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>

1928
01:28:11.901 --> 01:28:14.480
<v Speaker 3>but you're not going to happen because </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are running at each other,</v>

1929
01:28:14.481 --> 01:28:15.260
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1930
01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:17.320
<v Speaker 3>You're not worried about tackles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>

1931
01:28:17.370 --> 01:28:19.910
<v Speaker 3>Stopped football or Lacrosse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I tried Lacrosse.</v>

1932
01:28:19.911 --> 01:28:20.744
<v Speaker 3>That was not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ridiculous people hitting each other </v>

1933
01:28:22.731 --> 01:28:23.564
<v Speaker 3>with sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1934
01:28:23.690 --> 01:28:24.890
<v Speaker 3>fuck all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a lot.</v>

1935
01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:29.270
<v Speaker 3>Do you mess around with Vr at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1936
01:28:29.330 --> 01:28:30.530
<v Speaker 3>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have A.</v>

1937
01:28:30.531 --> 01:28:34.700
<v Speaker 3>I have an htc vive and that's been the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most common use of Vr.</v>

1938
01:28:34.701 --> 01:28:35.534
<v Speaker 3>We have a vibe in the studio and the two</v>
<v Speaker 3>games that come to mind the most are </v>

1939
01:28:38.211 --> 01:28:39.770
<v Speaker 3>called super hot.</v>

1940
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:41.510
<v Speaker 3>Don't know if you've played that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1941
01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:44.870
<v Speaker 3>And beat Saber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to play,</v>

1942
01:28:44.871 --> 01:28:48.320
<v Speaker 3>but my kids dominate this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The vr thing.</v>

1943
01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:49.173
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come in here and like get outta </v>

1944
01:28:50.210 --> 01:28:52.000
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pushed me away and there's a lot of</v>

1945
01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.780
<v Speaker 3>those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of fun stuff,</v>

1946
01:28:53.781 --> 01:28:56.480
<v Speaker 3>so I like so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so super high is a fun one.</v>

1947
01:28:56.481 --> 01:28:59.420
<v Speaker 3>It's a shooting game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strategy game type of thing.</v>

1948
01:28:59.630 --> 01:29:00.770
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1949
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:02.583
<v Speaker 3>so the way supra you're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in Vr so you're wearing this </v>

1950
01:29:04.681 --> 01:29:05.514
<v Speaker 3>thing and it's a bunch of stick figures </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to kill you and they're running </v>

1951
01:29:08.461 --> 01:29:10.220
<v Speaker 3>downstairs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>running around corners,</v>

1952
01:29:10.290 --> 01:29:12.210
<v Speaker 3>shooting at you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to kill you,</v>

1953
01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:17.240
<v Speaker 3>but time only moves when you move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you hold still you can look around</v>

1954
01:29:17.701 --> 01:29:18.534
<v Speaker 3>and like see in the headset where people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are and sort of evaluate like okay I </v>

1955
01:29:21.571 --> 01:29:22.404
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can pick up this object and hurt </v>

1956
01:29:23.341 --> 01:29:24.174
<v Speaker 3>somebody with it.</v>

1957
01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:25.350
<v Speaker 3>This is it right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1958
01:29:25.351 --> 01:29:27.570
<v Speaker 3>This is very crude looking video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1959
01:29:27.571 --> 01:29:29.580
<v Speaker 3>it's super basic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1960
01:29:29.581 --> 01:29:30.414
<v Speaker 3>stick figures trying to kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like a strategy game in that </v>

1961
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.823
<v Speaker 3>you sort of have to evaluate where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're at and not look around too much </v>

1962
01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:41.550
<v Speaker 3>and then as soon as you start to move </v>
<v Speaker 3>and throw things,</v>

1963
01:29:41.610 --> 01:29:43.170
<v Speaker 3>everyone else is trying to kill you </v>
<v Speaker 3>also.</v>

1964
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:44.263
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you can sort of dodge bullets as </v>

1965
01:29:45.991 --> 01:29:46.824
<v Speaker 3>they come around because you don't move </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you see them flying through the </v>

1966
01:29:49.711 --> 01:29:50.544
<v Speaker 3>air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of cool stuff to this </v>

1967
01:29:51.691 --> 01:29:53.520
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got really into it.</v>

1968
01:29:53.550 --> 01:29:55.770
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get to this level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is probably.</v>

1969
01:29:55.771 --> 01:29:56.604
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to dodge all the bullets flying </v>

1970
01:29:57.961 --> 01:29:58.810
<v Speaker 3>at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turn around,</v>

1971
01:29:58.830 --> 01:29:59.700
<v Speaker 3>throw something at him.</v>

1972
01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:03.270
<v Speaker 2>There's a boxing game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's several boxing games,</v>

1973
01:30:03.271 --> 01:30:06.720
<v Speaker 2>but in vr that are really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1974
01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:07.613
<v Speaker 2>And there they give you a workout </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a guy in front of you </v>

1975
01:30:10.771 --> 01:30:11.604
<v Speaker 2>and he's throwing punches and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>bobbing and weaving like full speed </v>

1976
01:30:13.771 --> 01:30:15.060
<v Speaker 2>punching at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1977
01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:18.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they look good like it looks like,</v>

1978
01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:19.183
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're in the ring and the guy's </v>

1979
01:30:20.410 --> 01:30:23.190
<v Speaker 2>looking at Jews mean mugging in throws </v>
<v Speaker 2>punches your way.</v>

1980
01:30:23.330 --> 01:30:25.320
<v Speaker 2>And when you get hit you see a flash of </v>
<v Speaker 2>white.</v>

1981
01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:28.650
<v Speaker 2>I want to try that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1982
01:30:28.710 --> 01:30:30.570
<v Speaker 2>it's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think with the,</v>

1983
01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:31.673
<v Speaker 2>with the haptic feedback suit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you could put something </v>

1984
01:30:33.781 --> 01:30:34.860
<v Speaker 2>there it is right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new one.</v>

1985
01:30:34.861 --> 01:30:35.694
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh this is a new one to create video </v>

1986
01:30:36.361 --> 01:30:37.160
<v Speaker 2>casts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On your mouth.</v>

1987
01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:39.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rock new rocky movie.</v>

1988
01:30:39.570 --> 01:30:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Or they can block.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1989
01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:44.650
<v Speaker 2>follow up damaging kind of expose </v>
<v Speaker 2>protocol.</v>

1990
01:30:45.150 --> 01:30:48.120
<v Speaker 2>You could hear rocky's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're chairing this look at this,</v>

1991
01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:52.980
<v Speaker 2>but when you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we did it out here in the hallway.</v>

1992
01:30:53.010 --> 01:30:53.843
<v Speaker 2>My feet were hurting because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving and shifting left and right and </v>

1993
01:30:57.721 --> 01:31:01.710
<v Speaker 2>throwing punches and bouncing off my </v>
<v Speaker 2>toes and after it was over to my fucking</v>

1994
01:31:01.711 --> 01:31:02.544
<v Speaker 2>feet are exhausted and you're doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>drills and everything more so than it </v>

1995
01:31:07.051 --> 01:31:09.540
<v Speaker 2>would be if I was actually sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1996
01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:11.640
<v Speaker 2>Because it was actually sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I would.</v>

1997
01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:15.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it would throw as many </v>
<v Speaker 2>punches in such a quick succession.</v>

1998
01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:20.220
<v Speaker 2>You'd be more worried about getting hit </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and actually getting punched,</v>

1999
01:31:20.490 --> 01:31:22.440
<v Speaker 2>but when you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting.</v>

2000
01:31:22.770 --> 01:31:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2001
01:31:24.410 --> 01:31:27.300
<v Speaker 2>that's I got to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that Adrian?</v>

2002
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:33.050
<v Speaker 3>There's also the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this the eight htc vive to it says,</v>

2003
01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:34.290
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this just came out for all of them.</v>

2004
01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:35.253
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2005
01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:36.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other one,</v>

2006
01:31:36.810 --> 01:31:39.300
<v Speaker 3>the other one's called beat Saber and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a.</v>

2007
01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:42.720
<v Speaker 3>You can think of it as like guitar hero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're holding a light saber.</v>

2008
01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:44.960
<v Speaker 2>My kids love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gone past you.</v>

2009
01:31:44.961 --> 01:31:45.794
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And things are flying at you and you're </v>

2010
01:31:46.881 --> 01:31:47.714
<v Speaker 2>hitting them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2011
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:49.700
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a really well done.</v>

2012
01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:52.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of really well done once</v>

2013
01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:53.233
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a great one that you're in a </v>

2014
01:31:54.261 --> 01:31:55.094
<v Speaker 2>castle and you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an old school bone Arrow and then </v>

2015
01:31:58.070 --> 01:32:00.340
<v Speaker 2>disease almost like South Park.</v>

2016
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:02.630
<v Speaker 3>Look at monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2017
01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:04.960
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still kind of cartoony.</v>

2018
01:32:04.961 --> 01:32:07.470
<v Speaker 3>But like if the graphics are crisp </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough that you like,</v>

2019
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:09.550
<v Speaker 3>feel like you're a cartoon character in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a way.</v>

2020
01:32:09.551 --> 01:32:10.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's good.</v>

2021
01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:12.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really cool.</v>

2022
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:13.303
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's actual physics to the </v>

2023
01:32:15.041 --> 01:32:15.874
<v Speaker 3>Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you shoot it certainly like </v>

2024
01:32:17.321 --> 01:32:19.780
<v Speaker 3>you have to lift your arm up to get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>arc of the Arrow.</v>

2025
01:32:19.781 --> 01:32:21.160
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A hit it things.</v>

2026
01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:22.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2027
01:32:22.330 --> 01:32:22.860
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

2028
01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:26.050
<v Speaker 3>I so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think about vr a lot just because as a</v>

2029
01:32:26.051 --> 01:32:26.884
<v Speaker 3>video maker you're making content for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the platform that people view it on and </v>

2030
01:32:32.171 --> 01:32:33.004
<v Speaker 3>we started to get this little creeping </v>
<v Speaker 3>up of like three 60 video is getting </v>

2031
01:32:35.801 --> 01:32:36.634
<v Speaker 3>really good and like interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>applications of of three 60 video and </v>

2032
01:32:41.111 --> 01:32:41.944
<v Speaker 3>it's still kind of early and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really know if it's gonna take off or </v>

2033
01:32:44.321 --> 01:32:45.154
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just this medium steppingstone </v>

2034
01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:48.093
<v Speaker 3>format to what might be a more immersive</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing or maybe just ar is going to be </v>

2035
01:32:52.271 --> 01:32:52.780
<v Speaker 3>way better.</v>

2036
01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:53.613
<v Speaker 3>I don't know yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I pay a lot of attention to it just </v>

2037
01:32:56.141 --> 01:32:57.670
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's new.</v>

2038
01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:01.600
<v Speaker 3>Ar is fascinating as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we,</v>

2039
01:33:01.601 --> 01:33:02.401
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we discussed,</v>

2040
01:33:02.401 --> 01:33:04.330
<v Speaker 3>what was it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>magic leap.</v>

2041
01:33:04.331 --> 01:33:05.164
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Microsoft one know that that's the </v>

2042
01:33:07.001 --> 01:33:07.834
<v Speaker 3>other one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollow Lens is Microsoft and then </v>

2043
01:33:09.041 --> 01:33:11.920
<v Speaker 3>magically it does its own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't tried either actually yet.</v>

2044
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:15.250
<v Speaker 3>And which one was the one where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ballerina was dancing in your hand?</v>

2045
01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:18.910
<v Speaker 3>Magic leap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but which one is that?</v>

2046
01:33:18.911 --> 01:33:20.800
<v Speaker 3>The one that people are saying is kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of vaporware,</v>

2047
01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:23.640
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>

2048
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.903
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine that that screen on that</v>
<v Speaker 3>phone would have some sort of similar </v>

2049
01:33:30.130 --> 01:33:31.930
<v Speaker 3>technologies like light field </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>

2050
01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:34.630
<v Speaker 3>Talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doing weird stuff with your eyes.</v>

2051
01:33:34.650 --> 01:33:37.240
<v Speaker 3>This is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this phone has a,</v>

2052
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:38.703
<v Speaker 3>what are they calling it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to remember what they're </v>

2053
01:33:43.491 --> 01:33:44.100
<v Speaker 3>calling it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2054
01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:45.870
<v Speaker 3>is there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need Wifi for it actually.</v>

2055
01:33:46.770 --> 01:33:47.603
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got a three d screen at glasses </v>

2056
01:33:49.650 --> 01:33:50.483
<v Speaker 3>list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>3D,</v>

2057
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:53.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>

2058
01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:56.180
<v Speaker 3>you basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has a three d screening.</v>

2059
01:33:56.181 --> 01:34:01.181
<v Speaker 3>You look at media on it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to sort of pop out at the top.</v>

2060
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:06.860
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't have to be lowercase a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lowercase.</v>

2061
01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:07.420
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2062
01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:08.390
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is it,</v>

2063
01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:12.160
<v Speaker 3>this is um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>t ballon.</v>

2064
01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:13.313
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2065
01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:14.590
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2066
01:34:14.850 --> 01:34:17.090
<v Speaker 3>but basically it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can look like that,</v>

2067
01:34:17.150 --> 01:34:22.150
<v Speaker 3>but you can't have things actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>popping out above the screen.</v>

2068
01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:24.560
<v Speaker 3>So things on the screen will look three </v>
<v Speaker 3>d,</v>

2069
01:34:24.561 --> 01:34:26.750
<v Speaker 3>but anything like outside of the screen </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't.</v>

2070
01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:28.450
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of hard to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2071
01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:32.900
<v Speaker 3>And so this is for video games or for </v>
<v Speaker 3>other things as well.</v>

2072
01:34:32.930 --> 01:34:33.763
<v Speaker 3>So at this point what they're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do is have a media like photos and </v>

2073
01:34:38.541 --> 01:34:40.760
<v Speaker 3>videos pop out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pop out,</v>

2074
01:34:40.761 --> 01:34:43.160
<v Speaker 3>so not just games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to have games as well,</v>

2075
01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:44.473
<v Speaker 3>but they have shared with me a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 3>media files that are like a good use of </v>

2076
01:34:50.091 --> 01:34:53.480
<v Speaker 3>the three d and I'm curious what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think of them because they're definitely</v>

2077
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:58.670
<v Speaker 3>like a stretch but it's hollow me </v>
<v Speaker 3>Holler,</v>

2078
01:34:59.030 --> 01:35:02.030
<v Speaker 3>holographic is the word they use but </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2079
01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:04.580
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to explain and it's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>trippy,</v>

2080
01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.033
<v Speaker 6>oh</v>

2081
01:35:08.170 --> 01:35:09.430
<v Speaker 1>do this is weird.</v>

2082
01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:12.360
<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's different like,</v>

2083
01:35:12.361 --> 01:35:15.720
<v Speaker 3>so there's a movie trailer version of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>where there's like things coming towards</v>

2084
01:35:15.721 --> 01:35:17.820
<v Speaker 3>you and I think that's maybe the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>use of it.</v>

2085
01:35:17.821 --> 01:35:18.654
<v Speaker 3>I've seen</v>

2086
01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:22.850
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible to show on camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried many different times this,</v>

2087
01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:26.110
<v Speaker 1>this will never show up on camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is odd.</v>

2088
01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:27.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're an issue or like people have to </v>

2089
01:35:30.281 --> 01:35:32.680
<v Speaker 1>make stuff for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2090
01:35:32.681 --> 01:35:36.040
<v Speaker 1>So any content you have to shoot for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for view,</v>

2091
01:35:36.130 --> 01:35:37.060
<v Speaker 1>they call it four of you</v>

2092
01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:42.540
<v Speaker 3>or they can take existing content and </v>
<v Speaker 3>convert it to four view,</v>

2093
01:35:42.581 --> 01:35:45.070
<v Speaker 3>but that's a little less successful </v>
<v Speaker 3>usually.</v>

2094
01:35:46.990 --> 01:35:49.780
<v Speaker 1>So it's really strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the cameras on the back,</v>

2095
01:35:49.781 --> 01:35:50.614
<v Speaker 1>they have two cameras on the back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can shoot for a view with the </v>

2096
01:35:52.901 --> 01:35:55.270
<v Speaker 1>cameras on the hydrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2097
01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2098
01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:56.593
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm looking at right now is a </v>

2099
01:35:57.910 --> 01:36:00.700
<v Speaker 1>topographic maps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2100
01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.480
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing man.</v>

2101
01:36:04.690 --> 01:36:05.580
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2102
01:36:05.740 --> 01:36:06.350
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to</v>

2103
01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:07.183
<v Speaker 3>tell again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I try to separate things into </v>

2104
01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:09.873
<v Speaker 3>buckets of this is something you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to use everyday and love or this </v>

2105
01:36:12.791 --> 01:36:14.470
<v Speaker 3>is a total gimmick that you'll never use</v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

2106
01:36:15.070 --> 01:36:15.903
<v Speaker 3>And I met,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started with it in the bucket of this </v>

2107
01:36:17.891 --> 01:36:18.724
<v Speaker 3>is kind of like a gimmick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they've put so much effort into </v>

2108
01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:26.930
<v Speaker 3>making it good and all these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversion techniques in.</v>

2109
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:33.730
<v Speaker 3>Let me see if I can find a clip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they've been constantly changing the</v>

2110
01:36:33.731 --> 01:36:34.564
<v Speaker 3>algorithms and adjusting it and updating</v>
<v Speaker 3>it to look better that it's starting to </v>

2111
01:36:39.011 --> 01:36:39.844
<v Speaker 3>convince me that it might be worth </v>
<v Speaker 3>paying attention to for more than just </v>

2112
01:36:42.611 --> 01:36:47.611
<v Speaker 3>the first two seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is amazing.</v>

2113
01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:52.660
<v Speaker 3>Do you think you would like use it all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time?</v>

2114
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:53.623
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never use it.</v>

2115
01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:56.390
<v Speaker 1>It's still amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still pretty cool.</v>

2116
01:36:56.391 --> 01:36:58.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very cool.</v>

2117
01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:03.320
<v Speaker 1>But how much better is it than regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>video that,</v>

2118
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:04.183
<v Speaker 1>that end?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long can you like look at it before </v>

2119
01:37:05.421 --> 01:37:07.330
<v Speaker 1>your eyes start to tweak?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little bit.</v>

2120
01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:08.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm already going,</v>

2121
01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:11.990
<v Speaker 1>but it looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It definitely looks really good.</v>

2122
01:37:11.991 --> 01:37:13.610
<v Speaker 1>It looks cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of interesting.</v>

2123
01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:14.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

2124
01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:16.793
<v Speaker 3>so you can take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can take photos and videos with the </v>

2125
01:37:18.901 --> 01:37:23.400
<v Speaker 3>camera on the phone that are in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>three d and that's maybe the best use of</v>

2126
01:37:23.401 --> 01:37:25.950
<v Speaker 3>it because then you can see like what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually in the room around you.</v>

2127
01:37:25.951 --> 01:37:28.290
<v Speaker 3>The way it would just show up and like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>direct translation.</v>

2128
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:30.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of an impact does it have on </v>

2129
01:37:31.061 --> 01:37:33.090
<v Speaker 1>storage size?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2130
01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:34.113
<v Speaker 1>not much.</v>

2131
01:37:34.190 --> 01:37:37.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's still video files and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like big four k videos,</v>

2132
01:37:37.641 --> 01:37:41.540
<v Speaker 3>but they're not necessarily through </v>
<v Speaker 3>faces big or anything like that.</v>

2133
01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:45.500
<v Speaker 3>It looks cool but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then use the video looks pretty cool</v>

2134
01:37:45.501 --> 01:37:47.120
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you go into the view finder and you</v>

2135
01:37:47.121 --> 01:37:47.954
<v Speaker 3>go from two d to three d,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he can take photos and videos of </v>

2136
01:37:52.190 --> 01:37:53.023
<v Speaker 3>things</v>

2137
01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:55.040
<v Speaker 1>in that format.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

2138
01:37:55.180 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 1>oh this</v>

2139
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:58.070
<v Speaker 3>is weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take.</v>

2140
01:37:58.410 --> 01:37:59.243
<v Speaker 3>If you take a capture and then look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and you kind of like move the phone </v>

2141
01:38:02.011 --> 01:38:05.160
<v Speaker 3>around a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda like Shimmery in a weird way,</v>

2142
01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:09.750
<v Speaker 3>but kind of three d sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is very odd.</v>

2143
01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:11.400
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2144
01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:13.860
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to look at this through this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2145
01:38:13.861 --> 01:38:15.960
<v Speaker 3>Like you'd would never be able to show </v>
<v Speaker 3>this to someone in a video.</v>

2146
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:16.863
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2147
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:20.100
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at these plastic sell little</v>

2148
01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:23.520
<v Speaker 3>figurines and as I move forward and </v>
<v Speaker 3>backward,</v>

2149
01:38:23.521 --> 01:38:26.160
<v Speaker 3>you really get a sense of three d.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2150
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:27.383
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I gotta figure out how to show it in </v>

2151
01:38:30.211 --> 01:38:31.740
<v Speaker 3>the video of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>

2152
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:34.470
<v Speaker 3>I just have to describe it to use my </v>
<v Speaker 3>words.</v>

2153
01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.760
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>

2154
01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:37.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's.</v>

2155
01:38:37.530 --> 01:38:38.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably coming.</v>

2156
01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:39.753
<v Speaker 3>That's probably common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably going to be something </v>

2157
01:38:40.591 --> 01:38:41.580
<v Speaker 3>we're all gonna have to deal with.</v>

2158
01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:42.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm interested.</v>

2159
01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:44.760
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you ask,</v>

2160
01:38:44.761 --> 01:38:45.520
<v Speaker 3>read that tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2161
01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:47.570
<v Speaker 3>this is the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's going to be like this.</v>

2162
01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:48.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got it.</v>

2163
01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:52.110
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to say that at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>three d movies were a big deal.</v>

2164
01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:54.920
<v Speaker 3>Get those stupid glasses and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2165
01:38:55.050 --> 01:38:56.220
<v Speaker 3>so they're claiming is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2166
01:38:56.221 --> 01:38:57.054
<v Speaker 3>this is what's it's genuinely good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can use it in portrait and </v>

2167
01:39:00.061 --> 01:39:01.680
<v Speaker 3>landscape glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's three d,</v>

2168
01:39:01.681 --> 01:39:04.800
<v Speaker 3>it's usually only one way or the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of polarization.</v>

2169
01:39:04.801 --> 01:39:09.390
<v Speaker 3>So this is a lenticular technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly how it works,</v>

2170
01:39:09.630 --> 01:39:11.520
<v Speaker 3>but you can use it in portrait or </v>
<v Speaker 3>landscape.</v>

2171
01:39:11.521 --> 01:39:16.170
<v Speaker 3>You can play games with it and things </v>
<v Speaker 3>will react in depth of space on,</v>

2172
01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:17.400
<v Speaker 3>in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2173
01:39:17.401 --> 01:39:19.110
<v Speaker 3>the first video that you showed me is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really interesting too,</v>

2174
01:39:19.111 --> 01:39:21.570
<v Speaker 3>because it's essentially like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>topographic map.</v>

2175
01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:23.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like Sarah,</v>

2176
01:39:23.490 --> 01:39:24.840
<v Speaker 3>you're paying attention to depth.</v>

2177
01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:25.713
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at the layers of the </v>

2178
01:39:27.181 --> 01:39:32.181
<v Speaker 3>mountain and the hillside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was kind of weirder,</v>

2179
01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:36.630
<v Speaker 3>like seeing these little figurines and </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving toward them in real life.</v>

2180
01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:37.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2181
01:39:37.370 --> 01:39:39.780
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think is a,</v>

2182
01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:42.980
<v Speaker 3>that's the best way to calibrate tier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like what it's doing around,</v>

2183
01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:44.580
<v Speaker 3>if you just look at like a video of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2184
01:39:44.581 --> 01:39:46.860
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks three d like it's coming at me.</v>

2185
01:39:46.890 --> 01:39:48.930
<v Speaker 3>And they had a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2186
01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:51.570
<v Speaker 3>like a movie trailer type of thing where</v>
<v Speaker 3>like again,</v>

2187
01:39:51.571 --> 01:39:52.404
<v Speaker 3>like it was mostly shot for this format </v>
<v Speaker 3>and things would like kind of go past </v>

2188
01:39:56.491 --> 01:39:59.010
<v Speaker 3>you and the speakers are also really </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

2189
01:39:59.011 --> 01:39:59.844
<v Speaker 3>So they have this sort of a three d </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversion technique for audio as well </v>

2190
01:40:02.761 --> 01:40:06.300
<v Speaker 3>where it sort of goes behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2191
01:40:06.570 --> 01:40:08.760
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2192
01:40:08.761 --> 01:40:09.594
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you mess around with Google glasses </v>

2193
01:40:11.431 --> 01:40:12.390
<v Speaker 3>when they first came out?</v>

2194
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:13.260
<v Speaker 3>It did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2195
01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:14.760
<v Speaker 3>What did you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2196
01:40:14.761 --> 01:40:15.594
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be something I guess I </v>

2197
01:40:18.391 --> 01:40:19.920
<v Speaker 3>probably did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2198
01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:20.993
<v Speaker 3>it was a glass was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was ahead of its time but also like </v>

2199
01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:26.450
<v Speaker 3>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

2200
01:40:26.451 --> 01:40:27.570
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had it,</v>

2201
01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:28.493
<v Speaker 3>I was in college also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was like I can't wear it to class </v>

2202
01:40:30.271 --> 01:40:33.180
<v Speaker 3>or like walk around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I could walk around hoboken with</v>

2203
01:40:33.181 --> 01:40:34.014
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the whole idea of an augmented </v>

2204
01:40:35.191 --> 01:40:36.024
<v Speaker 3>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this little screen that I could just </v>

2205
01:40:37.651 --> 01:40:38.484
<v Speaker 3>check the weather and then look back </v>
<v Speaker 3>down or check my texts and look back </v>

2206
01:40:40.831 --> 01:40:42.170
<v Speaker 3>down and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2207
01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:43.013
<v Speaker 3>that could be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also if you look at someone wearing </v>

2208
01:40:45.301 --> 01:40:46.110
<v Speaker 3>google glass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2209
01:40:46.110 --> 01:40:48.120
<v Speaker 3>that guy's wearing google glass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

2210
01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:48.993
<v Speaker 3>can't get around it where people would </v>
<v Speaker 3>get angry at people for wearing it </v>

2211
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:52.560
<v Speaker 3>because it had a camera and filming me.</v>

2212
01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:53.393
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2213
01:40:53.410 --> 01:40:55.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was another thing is I tried,</v>

2214
01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't even say the name,</v>

2215
01:40:57.371 --> 01:40:58.204
<v Speaker 3>but like another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like much newer version of that where </v>

2216
01:41:00.191 --> 01:41:01.160
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like a,</v>

2217
01:41:01.470 --> 01:41:03.530
<v Speaker 3>a small projection to a prism that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>

2218
01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:04.473
<v Speaker 3>you could see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one else could and it would fit </v>

2219
01:41:06.371 --> 01:41:08.860
<v Speaker 3>into something that looked more like </v>
<v Speaker 3>regular glasses.</v>

2220
01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:10.233
<v Speaker 3>So it had a battery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had everything but it didn't have a </v>

2221
01:41:11.621 --> 01:41:14.680
<v Speaker 3>camera and you still had a screen that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could look up into the corner too.</v>

2222
01:41:15.490 --> 01:41:16.061
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2223
01:41:16.061 --> 01:41:18.610
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if you'll notice the difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>between regular glasses.</v>

2224
01:41:18.611 --> 01:41:19.444
<v Speaker 3>And I went down and I met the guys who </v>
<v Speaker 3>were showing it to me in the lobby and </v>

2225
01:41:22.151 --> 01:41:23.710
<v Speaker 3>immediately I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy's wearing it.</v>

2226
01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:26.320
<v Speaker 3>I can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see a little light in his eye.</v>

2227
01:41:26.350 --> 01:41:28.480
<v Speaker 3>I can see like the extra thick glasses.</v>

2228
01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:30.460
<v Speaker 3>So it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2229
01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:31.353
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting concept and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know where it goes from here if it has </v>

2230
01:41:36.611 --> 01:41:37.444
<v Speaker 3>to be glasses based or if we'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually have some sort of a chip in </v>

2231
01:41:40.691 --> 01:41:43.900
<v Speaker 3>her eye or what the deal is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the next move is.</v>

2232
01:41:43.930 --> 01:41:46.360
<v Speaker 3>But it's a cool concept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2233
01:41:46.361 --> 01:41:47.194
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things that sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of been flirting with for the </v>

2234
01:41:51.521 --> 01:41:54.400
<v Speaker 3>longest time people thought virtual </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality was going to be.</v>

2235
01:41:55.590 --> 01:42:00.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was virtual reality </v>
<v Speaker 3>concepts 20 years ago and people thought</v>

2236
01:42:00.611 --> 01:42:02.880
<v Speaker 3>virtual reality was going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future and then it,</v>

2237
01:42:03.010 --> 01:42:06.100
<v Speaker 3>it took a long time for the hardware to </v>
<v Speaker 3>catch up.</v>

2238
01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:07.263
<v Speaker 3>I think augmented reality has a more </v>
<v Speaker 3>promising immediate future just because </v>

2239
01:42:10.031 --> 01:42:12.160
<v Speaker 3>it's more useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2240
01:42:12.610 --> 01:42:16.750
<v Speaker 3>but virtual reality has like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>immersion factor going for it.</v>

2241
01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:20.380
<v Speaker 3>The problem is you have to make a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to make a whole world.</v>

2242
01:42:20.410 --> 01:42:24.970
<v Speaker 3>So augmented reality is just like some </v>
<v Speaker 3>layer on top of your current world.</v>

2243
01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:27.340
<v Speaker 3>So you get like a little screen or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2244
01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:31.000
<v Speaker 3>or you look at one particular thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks different from real life.</v>

2245
01:42:31.210 --> 01:42:33.820
<v Speaker 3>That's easier to build for virtual </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality,</v>

2246
01:42:33.821 --> 01:42:37.930
<v Speaker 3>you have to build the whole world that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you step into it.</v>

2247
01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:42.910
<v Speaker 3>That's like a much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much a deeper layer of immersion,</v>

2248
01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:45.340
<v Speaker 3>which is great to step into but also </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard to make.</v>

2249
01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:49.570
<v Speaker 3>So that's the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm more into ar at the moment.</v>

2250
01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:54.490
<v Speaker 3>Well I think ar in the sense of having </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the functions of your phone in front</v>

2251
01:42:54.491 --> 01:42:56.770
<v Speaker 3>of you in the air when you call upon </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2252
01:42:57.130 --> 01:42:58.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of like a movie.</v>

2253
01:42:58.290 --> 01:42:59.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a,</v>

2254
01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:02.050
<v Speaker 3>like one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone in a movie or like iron man even</v>

2255
01:43:02.051 --> 01:43:02.884
<v Speaker 3>like they just out like as a sheet of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like buttons in front of them and like </v>

2256
01:43:05.230 --> 01:43:08.830
<v Speaker 3>close it only they could see that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the future and have some,</v>

2257
01:43:08.831 --> 01:43:11.380
<v Speaker 3>Hey Siri type,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2258
01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:13.470
<v Speaker 3>hopefully not demand series.</v>

2259
01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:14.560
<v Speaker 3>Terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Serious.</v>

2260
01:43:14.561 --> 01:43:16.870
<v Speaker 3>Not that good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It works for some things.</v>

2261
01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:20.290
<v Speaker 3>It's okay if something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Siri Google assistants better though.</v>

2262
01:43:20.350 --> 01:43:21.400
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2263
01:43:21.550 --> 01:43:23.430
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2264
01:43:23.450 --> 01:43:25.010
<v Speaker 3>See that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's the.</v>

2265
01:43:25.210 --> 01:43:27.940
<v Speaker 3>Have you tried bixby thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excuse even worse.</v>

2266
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:29.590
<v Speaker 3>Bixby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty bad.</v>

2267
01:43:29.710 --> 01:43:31.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But bixby does a few things.</v>

2268
01:43:31.721 --> 01:43:32.551
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a checks.</v>

2269
01:43:32.551 --> 01:43:33.460
<v Speaker 3>Flights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2270
01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:34.453
<v Speaker 3>Me has like bixby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think is hilarious because it shows </v>

2271
01:43:36.911 --> 01:43:39.370
<v Speaker 3>how good it can be and then it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>good like it.</v>

2272
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:40.263
<v Speaker 3>It has a couple of things that it can </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely do better than any other </v>

2273
01:43:43.841 --> 01:43:44.674
<v Speaker 3>assistant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what it can dig in locally on </v>

2274
01:43:46.961 --> 01:43:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Samsung phones and like do strings of </v>
<v Speaker 3>commands.</v>

2275
01:43:50.050 --> 01:43:50.883
<v Speaker 3>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2276
01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:52.730
<v Speaker 3>Spi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>open my settings APP,</v>

2277
01:43:52.731 --> 01:43:57.020
<v Speaker 3>turn my brightness halfway down and turn</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wifi off and it'll do all of that.</v>

2278
01:43:57.860 --> 01:43:59.600
<v Speaker 3>And Siri and Google assistant won't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2279
01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:00.741
<v Speaker 3>But if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2280
01:44:00.741 --> 01:44:03.740
<v Speaker 3>big speed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how tall is like the Statue of Liberty?</v>

2281
01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:07.910
<v Speaker 3>It might not do it like it's a really </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad at a lot of basic things.</v>

2282
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:09.343
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google Assistant I think is the most </v>

2283
01:44:10.761 --> 01:44:13.430
<v Speaker 3>complete and useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I genuinely use it all the time.</v>

2284
01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:14.473
<v Speaker 3>Syria mostly triggered by accident and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then I wonder if it's better and it </v>

2285
01:44:17.841 --> 01:44:20.510
<v Speaker 3>isn't what's offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bixby has a button.</v>

2286
01:44:20.710 --> 01:44:21.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate that.</v>

2287
01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:22.670
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2288
01:44:22.670 --> 01:44:23.503
<v Speaker 3>And you can remap an unreal mappable </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick speed button that you accidentally </v>

2289
01:44:27.201 --> 01:44:29.220
<v Speaker 3>press all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2290
01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:31.570
<v Speaker 3>lower left hand corner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is this thing that.</v>

2291
01:44:31.730 --> 01:44:32.840
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2292
01:44:32.841 --> 01:44:35.450
<v Speaker 3>The iphone Siri button gets pressed a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot,</v>

2293
01:44:35.451 --> 01:44:38.090
<v Speaker 3>but what I really like about the pixels </v>
<v Speaker 3>of squeeze.</v>

2294
01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:39.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can turn it off.</v>

2295
01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:41.400
<v Speaker 3>Do you use it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just squeeze it?</v>

2296
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:42.740
<v Speaker 3>Actually the assistant?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2297
01:44:42.750 --> 01:44:43.583
<v Speaker 3>Once in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mostly use the hey google trigger </v>

2298
01:44:45.170 --> 01:44:48.470
<v Speaker 3>which is mapped to my voice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so see it turns on now that I said it.</v>

2299
01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:51.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I started using the squeeze a little</v>

2300
01:44:51.141 --> 01:44:51.974
<v Speaker 3>more so I don't have to yell and I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>just squeeze it and say a commander </v>

2301
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:57.110
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mostly question now,</v>

2302
01:44:57.111 --> 01:44:57.944
<v Speaker 3>do you use any of the home feature </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like do you use Alexa or the </v>

2303
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:03.403
<v Speaker 3>Google home or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A first thing I got into my home was </v>

2304
01:45:05.571 --> 01:45:07.850
<v Speaker 3>google home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now I have a google home home.</v>

2305
01:45:08.450 --> 01:45:12.050
<v Speaker 3>If I had Alexa first thing I probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>would have had an Alexa home with things</v>

2306
01:45:12.051 --> 01:45:12.884
<v Speaker 3>that worked with Alexa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they genuinely like usually work </v>

2307
01:45:14.661 --> 01:45:15.920
<v Speaker 3>with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do your lights,</v>

2308
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:16.783
<v Speaker 3>work with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also what I have is I have a nest </v>

2309
01:45:18.921 --> 01:45:23.921
<v Speaker 3>thermostat and I have a nest security </v>
<v Speaker 3>camera and I think that's it.</v>

2310
01:45:25.190 --> 01:45:26.023
<v Speaker 3>And I had smart lights but I stopped </v>
<v Speaker 3>using them so it's mostly just the nest </v>

2311
01:45:28.371 --> 01:45:33.371
<v Speaker 3>stuff and I can ask what the temperature</v>
<v Speaker 3>is upstairs and then say hey,</v>

2312
01:45:33.771 --> 01:45:35.540
<v Speaker 3>change the temperature to this and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll do it.</v>

2313
01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:39.620
<v Speaker 3>So I don't have to run out and find the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thermostat and change it myself.</v>

2314
01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:41.990
<v Speaker 3>I remember hearing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2315
01:45:42.230 --> 01:45:43.063
<v Speaker 3>Bill Gates had some pin that you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>put on when you entered into his home </v>

2316
01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:51.170
<v Speaker 3>and when you go into certain rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you had a pin on it would recognize,</v>

2317
01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:52.033
<v Speaker 3>oh it's bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill likes the temperature at this </v>

2318
01:45:54.111 --> 01:45:56.360
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He likes this art on the wall.</v>

2319
01:45:56.361 --> 01:46:00.350
<v Speaker 3>So he had have lcd screens that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>display different images.</v>

2320
01:46:00.710 --> 01:46:03.050
<v Speaker 3>That's almost too much modularity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

2321
01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:07.070
<v Speaker 3>I kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it a general state of like things</v>

2322
01:46:07.071 --> 01:46:08.870
<v Speaker 3>are the same unless I want them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>

2323
01:46:09.190 --> 01:46:10.023
<v Speaker 3>Like that would be kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like every time you leave the room the </v>

2324
01:46:11.421 --> 01:46:12.254
<v Speaker 3>art changes behind you when you walked </v>
<v Speaker 3>back in and it changes back and you </v>

2325
01:46:14.481 --> 01:46:16.220
<v Speaker 3>leave again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of a lot.</v>

2326
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:17.780
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

2327
01:46:17.781 --> 01:46:18.614
<v Speaker 3>like just like a couple things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I have the Google home app where </v>

2328
01:46:21.291 --> 01:46:22.190
<v Speaker 3>I'll like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2329
01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:26.210
<v Speaker 3>changes the temperature once in awhile </v>
<v Speaker 3>or a you get,</v>

2330
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:28.820
<v Speaker 3>there's this thing I've considered </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting the ring doorbell.</v>

2331
01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:30.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which has a camera,</v>

2332
01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:32.210
<v Speaker 3>but I don't really use the doorbell that</v>
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>

2333
01:46:32.211 --> 01:46:34.320
<v Speaker 3>It's mostly packages get delivered to </v>
<v Speaker 3>work instead of home.</v>

2334
01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:36.553
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's about it.</v>

2335
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:39.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Alexa and the Google home,</v>

2336
01:46:39.981 --> 01:46:42.010
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the big concern that people have is</v>

2337
01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:42.853
<v Speaker 3>it's listening to you all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a store that I read </v>

2338
01:46:45.291 --> 01:46:46.124
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a murder investigation and </v>

2339
01:46:47.931 --> 01:46:52.630
<v Speaker 3>that they were trying to get the records</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Amazon Alexa Wild,</v>

2340
01:46:52.770 --> 01:46:53.603
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this murder investigation was going on </v>

2341
01:46:55.081 --> 01:46:55.914
<v Speaker 3>because they think they could have like </v>
<v Speaker 3>listened to the conversation and then </v>

2342
01:46:58.351 --> 01:46:59.310
<v Speaker 3>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

2343
01:46:59.530 --> 01:47:01.860
<v Speaker 3>this fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just listening all the time.</v>

2344
01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:03.900
<v Speaker 3>Well it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>

2345
01:47:05.050 --> 01:47:06.570
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll help you.</v>

2346
01:47:06.571 --> 01:47:08.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get murdered dee,</v>

2347
01:47:08.610 --> 01:47:09.900
<v Speaker 3>you don't want anybody to get away with </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2348
01:47:09.901 --> 01:47:10.950
<v Speaker 3>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

2349
01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:13.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a lot.</v>

2350
01:47:13.890 --> 01:47:15.300
<v Speaker 3>Yet it's got to listen like.</v>

2351
01:47:15.330 --> 01:47:19.380
<v Speaker 3>So the whole privacy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have honestly have to think about that</v>

2352
01:47:19.381 --> 01:47:20.430
<v Speaker 3>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike.</v>

2353
01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:25.460
<v Speaker 3>My compromise in my own head personally </v>
<v Speaker 3>is I don't have privacy and I know it so</v>

2354
01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:29.070
<v Speaker 3>I might as well get something back for </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2355
01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:31.760
<v Speaker 3>which is convenience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like if,</v>

2356
01:47:31.810 --> 01:47:34.560
<v Speaker 3>if I'm going to have like this Google </v>
<v Speaker 3>assistant on my phone,</v>

2357
01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:38.420
<v Speaker 3>I already have a gps and Wifi and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these sensors in my phone,</v>

2358
01:47:38.430 --> 01:47:39.263
<v Speaker 3>I might as well like Google of course </v>
<v Speaker 3>they know where I am so I might as well </v>

2359
01:47:41.941 --> 01:47:44.940
<v Speaker 3>get something for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe I'll get like shortcuts to like</v>

2360
01:47:44.990 --> 01:47:46.290
<v Speaker 3>where I need to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2361
01:47:46.291 --> 01:47:49.080
<v Speaker 3>where my work is just gimme a shortcut </v>
<v Speaker 3>to traffic to work.</v>

2362
01:47:49.081 --> 01:47:51.430
<v Speaker 3>Like that's what's weird and says you'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>be home in 12 minutes.</v>

2363
01:47:51.431 --> 01:47:52.470
<v Speaker 3>Like pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you know where I lived?</v>

2364
01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:53.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2365
01:47:53.610 --> 01:47:54.780
<v Speaker 3>How do you know when I'm home?</v>

2366
01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:55.613
<v Speaker 3>But if you're going to know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I know you are because you're </v>

2367
01:47:57.200 --> 01:47:58.950
<v Speaker 3>google,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then give me something back.</v>

2368
01:47:59.010 --> 01:48:00.390
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2369
01:48:00.510 --> 01:48:03.030
<v Speaker 3>restaurants near me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you know where I am?</v>

2370
01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:06.450
<v Speaker 3>You're watching me all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're constantly basically.</v>

2371
01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:10.950
<v Speaker 3>So it knows like I have a couple of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>preferences that seem like pretty minor,</v>

2372
01:48:10.951 --> 01:48:11.784
<v Speaker 3>like what sports teams do you like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What sports do you enjoy watching or </v>

2373
01:48:14.131 --> 01:48:14.964
<v Speaker 3>like what sort of topics do you enjoy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you open my google assistant it </v>

2374
01:48:17.551 --> 01:48:18.384
<v Speaker 3>will tell you like here's the score of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the game you were about to check the </v>

2375
01:48:20.461 --> 01:48:23.670
<v Speaker 3>score to here's the traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a flight later.</v>

2376
01:48:23.970 --> 01:48:24.803
<v Speaker 3>What is going to do and I know it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do this is it's going to tell </v>

2377
01:48:26.761 --> 01:48:29.130
<v Speaker 3>me when it's time to leave based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>traffic,</v>

2378
01:48:29.190 --> 01:48:30.023
<v Speaker 3>based on my location to arrive to my </v>
<v Speaker 3>flight 90 minutes before the scheduled </v>

2379
01:48:33.811 --> 01:48:34.644
<v Speaker 3>departure.</v>

2380
01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:37.770
<v Speaker 3>It's going to tell me when to leave </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it knows where I am.</v>

2381
01:48:37.771 --> 01:48:40.290
<v Speaker 3>It knows where the airport I'm leaving </v>
<v Speaker 3>from is it knows my flight,</v>

2382
01:48:40.710 --> 01:48:41.543
<v Speaker 3>my flight time and it knows I need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get to the airport in 90 minutes before </v>

2383
01:48:44.281 --> 01:48:46.500
<v Speaker 3>the flight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does Google own ways now?</v>

2384
01:48:46.910 --> 01:48:49.830
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they either own ways or bought.</v>

2385
01:48:50.050 --> 01:48:51.750
<v Speaker 3>I think that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they bought waste.</v>

2386
01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:54.480
<v Speaker 3>So when you get something through Google</v>
<v Speaker 3>maps,</v>

2387
01:48:54.481 --> 01:48:56.700
<v Speaker 3>it does kind of the same thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>weighs does,</v>

2388
01:48:56.701 --> 01:48:57.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2389
01:48:57.370 --> 01:48:57.871
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2390
01:48:57.871 --> 01:48:58.704
<v Speaker 3>They use data from which people who live</v>
<v Speaker 3>in these neighborhoods were ways is now </v>

2391
01:49:02.461 --> 01:49:03.440
<v Speaker 3>rerouting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You heard about.</v>

2392
01:49:03.490 --> 01:49:06.390
<v Speaker 3>They are furious about that and I'm away</v>
<v Speaker 3>his person.</v>

2393
01:49:06.391 --> 01:49:07.224
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you're very familiar with the </v>

2394
01:49:08.551 --> 01:49:11.070
<v Speaker 3>rerouting and it's pretty hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious.</v>

2395
01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:11.933
<v Speaker 3>People had these sleepy little </v>
<v Speaker 3>communities and now it's like it's </v>

2396
01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:18.570
<v Speaker 3>traffic streams of cars going through </v>
<v Speaker 3>their neighborhood is great though.</v>

2397
01:49:18.690 --> 01:49:19.523
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is great.</v>

2398
01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:20.730
<v Speaker 3>It is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

2399
01:49:20.731 --> 01:49:21.564
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing how well it predicts your </v>
<v Speaker 3>time arrival to and the whole like </v>

2400
01:49:25.290 --> 01:49:28.140
<v Speaker 3>notifying you when there's construction </v>
<v Speaker 3>or police or something.</v>

2401
01:49:28.290 --> 01:49:29.101
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2402
01:49:29.101 --> 01:49:32.160
<v Speaker 3>it's excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The car's broken down the right lane,</v>

2403
01:49:32.250 --> 01:49:33.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shift to the left.</v>

2404
01:49:34.170 --> 01:49:35.570
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get around it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

2405
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:39.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by all these advances and</v>

2406
01:49:39.871 --> 01:49:42.250
<v Speaker 3>where they're taking us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2407
01:49:42.290 --> 01:49:43.123
<v Speaker 3>I spent a lot of time thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spend a lot of time thinking about </v>

2408
01:49:45.811 --> 01:49:48.130
<v Speaker 3>what the future or what</v>

2409
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:50.260
<v Speaker 2>the future holds and where all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff is going.</v>

2410
01:49:50.650 --> 01:49:55.650
<v Speaker 2>And I never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never would have imagined 20 years ago</v>

2411
01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:58.233
<v Speaker 2>that we would be all addicted to our </v>
<v Speaker 2>phones and one of the big issues would </v>

2412
01:50:01.661 --> 01:50:02.494
<v Speaker 2>be like one of the new features in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>iphone shows you how much screen time </v>

2413
01:50:05.111 --> 01:50:09.070
<v Speaker 2>you have and because when we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this fitness challenge,</v>

2414
01:50:09.130 --> 01:50:12.250
<v Speaker 2>your screen is on all the time because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at your screen because it</v>

2415
01:50:12.251 --> 01:50:13.084
<v Speaker 2>shows you the score that you're scaling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like your screen usage this </v>

2416
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:19.600
<v Speaker 2>month is up 900 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like oh no,</v>

2417
01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:24.400
<v Speaker 2>that's not good at counting this month </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously because of that.</v>

2418
01:50:24.401 --> 01:50:25.234
<v Speaker 2>But there's something to addiction to </v>
<v Speaker 2>phones and addiction to technology and </v>

2419
01:50:30.011 --> 01:50:32.410
<v Speaker 2>the fact that it's so a part of our life</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I.</v>

2420
01:50:32.650 --> 01:50:33.483
<v Speaker 2>I can only imagine it's going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more immersive and we're going </v>

2421
01:50:36.061 --> 01:50:39.610
<v Speaker 2>to become more and more symbiotic with </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this electronics mean you're wearing</v>

2422
01:50:39.611 --> 01:50:40.444
<v Speaker 2>a watch that Paula tile and new things </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time and you have three phones </v>

2423
01:50:43.751 --> 01:50:44.250
<v Speaker 2>with you.</v>

2424
01:50:44.250 --> 01:50:45.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

2425
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:48.220
<v Speaker 3>on one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that it's gotten a,</v>

2426
01:50:48.270 --> 01:50:50.310
<v Speaker 3>at least recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little more in the spotlight.</v>

2427
01:50:50.311 --> 01:50:54.360
<v Speaker 3>Like Google just added the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It digital wellbeing feature which tells</v>

2428
01:50:54.361 --> 01:50:55.194
<v Speaker 3>you how much screen time you've had in </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain apps and we'll let you restrict </v>

2429
01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:03.750
<v Speaker 3>your usage of instagram by a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of minutes,</v>

2430
01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:04.830
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon the same thing.</v>

2431
01:51:05.730 --> 01:51:08.100
<v Speaker 3>They both introduced that within six </v>
<v Speaker 3>months of each other,</v>

2432
01:51:08.130 --> 01:51:13.130
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But on the other hand I think I think in</v>

2433
01:51:13.441 --> 01:51:14.274
<v Speaker 3>my own head that I am not addicted yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still unplug every weekend to play </v>

2434
01:51:20.251 --> 01:51:23.430
<v Speaker 3>ultimate and then I plugged back in on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Monday.</v>

2435
01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:26.800
<v Speaker 2>When you say you unplugged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning you don't check your email,</v>

2436
01:51:27.190 --> 01:51:28.660
<v Speaker 3>check your texts?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2437
01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:29.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2438
01:51:29.290 --> 01:51:32.980
<v Speaker 3>if I get texts I get them but like as </v>
<v Speaker 3>far as that mean.</v>

2439
01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:35.590
<v Speaker 3>So like I have my stuff with me but like</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I go,</v>

2440
01:51:35.591 --> 01:51:38.500
<v Speaker 3>when we go play a tournament that's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll have like five games in a day.</v>

2441
01:51:38.501 --> 01:51:40.870
<v Speaker 3>So I'd get up at like 7:30.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go to the fields,</v>

2442
01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:42.550
<v Speaker 3>you put your bag down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you warm up,</v>

2443
01:51:42.551 --> 01:51:43.750
<v Speaker 3>you play a game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you warm up,</v>

2444
01:51:43.751 --> 01:51:44.670
<v Speaker 3>you play a game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you warm up,</v>

2445
01:51:44.671 --> 01:51:47.110
<v Speaker 3>you play a game and you'd done about </v>
<v Speaker 3>like four or 5:00</v>

2446
01:51:47.110 --> 01:51:47.860
<v Speaker 3>PM.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2447
01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:50.680
<v Speaker 3>All Day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no phone activity.</v>

2448
01:51:50.710 --> 01:51:51.790
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

2449
01:51:51.791 --> 01:51:53.410
<v Speaker 3>You're not wearing your watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2450
01:51:53.590 --> 01:51:55.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm missing out on a lot of points.</v>

2451
01:51:55.890 --> 01:51:58.960
<v Speaker 3>I'd be whooping some people in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition thing,</v>

2452
01:51:58.961 --> 01:52:01.090
<v Speaker 3>but I'm clearly not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2453

<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all day and then we'll have a team </v>

2454
01:52:02.861 --> 01:52:04.840
<v Speaker 3>dinner and then shower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sleep,</v>

2455
01:52:04.841 --> 01:52:06.820
<v Speaker 3>wake up the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>day two of the tournament.</v>

2456
01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Sunday you need instead of that risk </v>
<v Speaker 2>drop,</v>

2457
01:52:10.261 --> 01:52:13.490
<v Speaker 2>you needed like a forearm strap that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like on out of</v>

2458
01:52:13.490 --> 01:52:14.460
<v Speaker 3>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2459
01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:18.710
<v Speaker 3>like on like one of those tennis fan </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2460
01:52:18.940 --> 01:52:19.773
<v Speaker 3>I know I have a couple of friends at </v>
<v Speaker 3>that play ultimate with that on like </v>

2461
01:52:22.851 --> 01:52:26.470
<v Speaker 3>under their jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like the watch is the points.</v>

2462
01:52:26.490 --> 01:52:28.490
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't know if the watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I put it up here,</v>

2463
01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:31.130
<v Speaker 3>we'll still measure my heart rate and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff the same,</v>

2464
01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:31.993
<v Speaker 3>but my zone thinks thinks to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>compression shirt and I know you can </v>

2465
01:52:34.311 --> 01:52:37.280
<v Speaker 3>sync them eyes on thing to your watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Apple Watch it that way.</v>

2466
01:52:37.340 --> 01:52:38.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure you.</v>

2467
01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:39.553
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean it syncs to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>compression to compression shirt that </v>

2468
01:52:41.361 --> 01:52:44.810
<v Speaker 3>has those little sensors sinks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but through their.</v>

2469
01:52:45.710 --> 01:52:46.250
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

2470
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:48.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost bought it,</v>

2471
01:52:48.821 --> 01:52:51.340
<v Speaker 1>but he snapped the thing into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>compression for all,</v>

2472
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:53.060
<v Speaker 1>for women in a shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For my God,</v>

2473
01:52:53.061 --> 01:52:55.370
<v Speaker 1>I got to get a Bra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2474
01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:58.940
<v Speaker 1>I want to get one of those days because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind's getting super sweaty,</v>

2475
01:52:58.941 --> 01:53:00.590
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing is losing a lot of.</v>

2476
01:53:00.591 --> 01:53:01.424
<v Speaker 1>It's less density.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so gross to instincts that you can </v>

2477
01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:08.010
<v Speaker 1>wash it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wash it in water and these led drivers.</v>

2478
01:53:08.011 --> 01:53:10.100
<v Speaker 1>So I thought it was electronic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2479
01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:11.600
<v Speaker 1>isn't going to stink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

2480
01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:13.820
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the fabric part.</v>

2481
01:53:14.290 --> 01:53:15.123
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just assumed that because all this </v>

2482
01:53:16.191 --> 01:53:18.300
<v Speaker 1>stuff is like you have to voltage </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensors.</v>

2483
01:53:18.301 --> 01:53:19.134
<v Speaker 1>It's just the sensors or making some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a contact with these buttons </v>

2484
01:53:22.791 --> 01:53:25.220
<v Speaker 1>which makes a contact with your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't wash the sensor.</v>

2485
01:53:25.250 --> 01:53:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Plastic metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't watch this,</v>

2486
01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:28.813
<v Speaker 1>but the rest of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to go through these pads to get </v>

2487
01:53:31.011 --> 01:53:31.844
<v Speaker 1>to your skin.</v>

2488
01:53:31.970 --> 01:53:34.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it to be shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2489
01:53:34.750 --> 01:53:35.930
<v Speaker 1>get this straight then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2490
01:53:36.110 --> 01:53:38.690
<v Speaker 1>How many get the shirt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2491
01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:40.193
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost,</v>

2492
01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:41.053
<v Speaker 1>not quite yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not too late overnight that four </v>

2493
01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:44.780
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2494
01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>augmented reality,</v>

2495
01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:49.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2496
01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:49.933
<v Speaker 1>I know that there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's talk about a contact lens that </v>

2497
01:53:54.891 --> 01:53:55.724
<v Speaker 1>was being in development that was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be some sort of a lens that's going </v>

2498
01:53:59.681 --> 01:54:03.860
<v Speaker 1>to allow you to do like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>minority report type shit in front of.</v>

2499
01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:05.173
<v Speaker 1>I think tech is tech as I know it is too</v>
<v Speaker 1>far from that to make that work just </v>

2500
01:54:09.921 --> 01:54:14.180
<v Speaker 1>because you need like a contact lens you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of is just like this clear thing.</v>

2501
01:54:14.181 --> 01:54:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some circuits on it or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like you need a battery,</v>

2502
01:54:17.181 --> 01:54:18.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you need,</v>

2503
01:54:18.730 --> 01:54:21.440
<v Speaker 1>unless it operates off your body I </v>
<v Speaker 1>guess,</v>

2504
01:54:21.441 --> 01:54:22.274
<v Speaker 1>but then you still need some smartwatch </v>
<v Speaker 1>that operates off the heat of your body </v>

2505
01:54:26.050 --> 01:54:26.430
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

2506
01:54:26.430 --> 01:54:27.263
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know how direct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like even if you do operate off of some </v>

2507
01:54:30.441 --> 01:54:31.274
<v Speaker 1>other power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says you need to get that power source </v>

2508
01:54:33.770 --> 01:54:36.050
<v Speaker 1>to connect to the electronics to make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

2509
01:54:36.051 --> 01:54:39.290
<v Speaker 1>which still takes some space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much but see,</v>

2510
01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:41.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems kind of far out,</v>

2511
01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:43.010
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

2512
01:54:43.070 --> 01:54:46.070
<v Speaker 1>it's a cool idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also seems really,</v>

2513
01:54:46.071 --> 01:54:46.904
<v Speaker 1>really difficult to put a contact lens </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly in front of your retina and be </v>

2514
01:54:50.151 --> 01:54:52.850
<v Speaker 1>able to focus on it and there's a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of questions I have about it.</v>

2515
01:54:52.851 --> 01:54:55.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how reasonable or realistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

2516
01:54:56.060 --> 01:55:01.060
<v Speaker 1>My real fear is that they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>invent a better eye for blind people and</v>

2517
01:55:03.531 --> 01:55:05.960
<v Speaker 1>when they do like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how amazing this is.</v>

2518
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:07.940
<v Speaker 1>We've given blind people the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

2519
01:55:07.941 --> 01:55:09.170
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>optical zoom,</v>

2520
01:55:09.290 --> 01:55:10.123
<v Speaker 1>but now they also have all these other </v>
<v Speaker 1>features that you don't have with your </v>

2521
01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:13.010
<v Speaker 1>regularized.</v>

2522
01:55:13.010 --> 01:55:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Let us keep those bad boys out and put </v>
<v Speaker 1>some fucking.</v>

2523
01:55:16.580 --> 01:55:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Some robot eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>binocular eyes.</v>

2524
01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:22.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little worried about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Realistically worried about that.</v>

2525
01:55:22.670 --> 01:55:23.750
<v Speaker 1>It came.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It came from.</v>

2526
01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:24.973
<v Speaker 1>We were watching this video once where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy who got his arm and his </v>

2527
01:55:27.081 --> 01:55:27.914
<v Speaker 1>leg bit off by sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got attacked by a shark when you're </v>

2528
01:55:30.801 --> 01:55:31.990
<v Speaker 1>surfing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2529
01:55:32.010 --> 01:55:34.890
<v Speaker 1>this carbon fiber hand that totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate,</v>

2530
01:55:34.891 --> 01:55:37.460
<v Speaker 1>it's like a real hand and he's standing </v>
<v Speaker 1>there with his.</v>

2531
01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:38.773
<v Speaker 1>From his knee down was an artificial leg</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was walking around and moving </v>

2532
01:55:42.501 --> 01:55:43.590
<v Speaker 1>like a regular person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2533
01:55:43.591 --> 01:55:44.130
<v Speaker 1>look at this guy.</v>

2534
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:45.480
<v Speaker 2>This is an incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2535
01:55:45.481 --> 01:55:48.810
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of a bionic guy because his </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand was moving around.</v>

2536
01:55:48.811 --> 01:55:51.510
<v Speaker 2>He could shake your hand and he seemed </v>
<v Speaker 2>so normal.</v>

2537
01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:54.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if it gets like many,</v>

2538
01:55:54.481 --> 01:55:55.314
<v Speaker 2>many generations better than this where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it has like Luke skywalker when he got </v>

2539
01:55:58.671 --> 01:55:59.504
<v Speaker 2>his hand chopped off by Darth Vader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember we got that robot hand and </v>

2540
01:56:02.730 --> 01:56:03.563
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

2541
01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:05.540
<v Speaker 3>There's people working on this every </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

2542
01:56:05.570 --> 01:56:09.050
<v Speaker 3>So I kind of figure we're headed in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>direction where like,</v>

2543
01:56:09.110 --> 01:56:09.943
<v Speaker 3>what's this Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just googled something at not out </v>

2544
01:56:12.651 --> 01:56:14.630
<v Speaker 3>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because this is called Macula,</v>

2545
01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:19.520
<v Speaker 3>which is a Ar Lens that you were with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sunglasses.</v>

2546
01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:24.130
<v Speaker 3>So in and together they make an air </v>
<v Speaker 3>station</v>

2547
01:56:24.850 --> 01:56:27.260
<v Speaker 2>glasses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lens as a contact,</v>

2548
01:56:27.261 --> 01:56:28.550
<v Speaker 2>and then sunglasses</v>

2549
01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:30.040
<v Speaker 3>picture that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2550
01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:33.330
<v Speaker 3>that's what they say they got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

2551
01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:35.370
<v Speaker 3>What is the Macula?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

2552
01:56:35.490 --> 01:56:40.490
<v Speaker 3>I have a lens here and then go over top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do about a creepy dude?</v>

2553
01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:42.430
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a picture.</v>

2554
01:56:42.490 --> 01:56:44.310
<v Speaker 3>It's not out yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just this,</v>

2555
01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:45.173
<v Speaker 3>you can invest in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's more like how magic leap was </v>

2556
01:56:47.071 --> 01:56:48.170
<v Speaker 3>about a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>year and a half ago.</v>

2557
01:56:48.250 --> 01:56:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not invested in anything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>uses guys are covered.</v>

2558
01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:52.240
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up with his face?</v>

2559
01:56:52.290 --> 01:56:53.520
<v Speaker 2>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking robot,</v>

2560
01:56:53.521 --> 01:56:54.600
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's an alien.</v>

2561
01:56:54.601 --> 01:56:58.820
<v Speaker 2>He looks like the guy from men in black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember when the alien put the skin on.</v>

2562
01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:01.773
<v Speaker 3>Remember?</v>

2563
01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:02.783
<v Speaker 2>That's what he looks like here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something wrong with the left side of </v>

2564
01:57:04.171 --> 01:57:05.004
<v Speaker 2>his face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2565
01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:06.870
<v Speaker 2>He's wearing someone's skin.</v>

2566
01:57:07.950 --> 01:57:11.250
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lens in a contact.</v>

2567
01:57:11.670 --> 01:57:15.700
<v Speaker 3>So the battery might be in the glass and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the glasses and it's working and I don't</v>

2568
01:57:15.701 --> 01:57:16.740
<v Speaker 3>know how it's connected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

2569
01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:18.600
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2570
01:57:19.290 --> 01:57:20.250
<v Speaker 3>Well we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>

2571
01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:23.370
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the other thing.</v>

2572
01:57:23.371 --> 01:57:26.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't need the information that fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that bad.</v>

2573
01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:27.533
<v Speaker 3>I'm okay with a one second delay of </v>
<v Speaker 3>picking up my phone and checking it </v>

2574
01:57:30.780 --> 01:57:32.400
<v Speaker 3>instead of [inaudible] like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you getting with?</v>

2575
01:57:32.430 --> 01:57:34.920
<v Speaker 3>You saw the note.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The examples were like incoming call,</v>

2576
01:57:35.340 --> 01:57:37.260
<v Speaker 3>the weather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your emails,</v>

2577
01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:38.903
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like information you can already get in </v>

2578
01:57:40.781 --> 01:57:42.750
<v Speaker 3>two seconds by just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

2579
01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:44.550
<v Speaker 3>I have an incoming call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have an email.</v>

2580
01:57:44.580 --> 01:57:47.880
<v Speaker 3>I have a text like that pretty quick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty quick.</v>

2581
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:48.743
<v Speaker 3>And I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've said this before where someone has </v>

2582
01:57:50.490 --> 01:57:51.323
<v Speaker 3>asked me like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are we at like the final form of </v>

2583
01:57:53.521 --> 01:57:54.810
<v Speaker 3>smartphones?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like where are they going to go?</v>

2584
01:57:54.811 --> 01:57:56.550
<v Speaker 3>Are we going to get bigger?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get smaller.</v>

2585
01:57:56.590 --> 01:57:57.423
<v Speaker 3>Are they going to be implanted in you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think smartphones are at like pretty </v>

2586
01:58:01.711 --> 01:58:06.090
<v Speaker 3>much their final form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to keep evolving the insides</v>

2587
01:58:06.091 --> 01:58:08.460
<v Speaker 3>of smartphones to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to get faster,</v>

2588
01:58:08.461 --> 01:58:11.550
<v Speaker 3>they're going to get more and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>transparent,</v>

2589
01:58:11.551 --> 01:58:12.384
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll get like more interesting </v>

2590
01:58:13.171 --> 01:58:14.004
<v Speaker 3>looking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's always going to be a </v>

2591
01:58:15.061 --> 01:58:18.870
<v Speaker 3>thing I pick up and use and then put it </v>
<v Speaker 3>back down.</v>

2592
01:58:19.650 --> 01:58:21.570
<v Speaker 3>I think that's where we're at for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>

2593
01:58:21.870 --> 01:58:22.703
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w what are your thoughts on Samsung's </v>

2594
01:58:24.361 --> 01:58:25.590
<v Speaker 2>foldable screens</v>

2595
01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:29.890
<v Speaker 3>that I am very curious about because </v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2596
01:58:30.370 --> 01:58:34.840
<v Speaker 3>sounds awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why do I fold it?</v>

2597
01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:35.793
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What am I doing with it and how big is </v>

2598
01:58:37.151 --> 01:58:37.984
<v Speaker 3>it going to get yet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I so like maybe so we had this a </v>

2599
01:58:41.141 --> 01:58:43.660
<v Speaker 3>while ago when we started first getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>this big phones,</v>

2600
01:58:43.661 --> 01:58:46.180
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh you could have a really big phone,</v>

2601
01:58:46.630 --> 01:58:47.463
<v Speaker 3>like a tablet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you fold it in half and it's a </v>

2602
01:58:49.150 --> 01:58:49.983
<v Speaker 3>phone size now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I might as well just have a </v>

2603
01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:57.610
<v Speaker 3>phone and a tablet unless I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>if I need both to remember the Samsung.</v>

2604
01:58:57.640 --> 01:59:02.640
<v Speaker 3>What was that giant thing that they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was bigger than a note a while.</v>

2605
01:59:03.131 --> 01:59:06.580
<v Speaker 3>They have small tablets but they had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a phone.</v>

2606
01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:09.190
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the galaxy mega.</v>

2607
01:59:10.330 --> 01:59:11.163
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have like the weird thing is like </v>

2608
01:59:12.701 --> 01:59:13.534
<v Speaker 3>that I think was like a six and a half </v>
<v Speaker 3>inch screen and that's where we're at </v>

2609
01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:16.560
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2610
01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:17.500
<v Speaker 3>Was it really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2611
01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:20.770
<v Speaker 3>it was massive compared to what we had </v>
<v Speaker 3>also in the market,</v>

2612
01:59:20.771 --> 01:59:23.500
<v Speaker 3>which was like five inch screens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never saw one in the wild.</v>

2613
01:59:23.950 --> 01:59:25.110
<v Speaker 3>I reviewed one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2614
01:59:25.111 --> 01:59:25.944
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was way bigger than any other phone </v>

2615
01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:27.873
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm pretty sure if I looked back </v>

2616
01:59:29.561 --> 01:59:31.870
<v Speaker 3>that was like a six and a half inch </v>
<v Speaker 3>screen.</v>

2617
01:59:31.930 --> 01:59:34.120
<v Speaker 3>It was less than seven inch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the sweet spot.</v>

2618
01:59:34.121 --> 01:59:39.121
<v Speaker 3>Seven inch screen tablet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six inch screen phone and I think yeah,</v>

2619
01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:42.990
<v Speaker 3>this is a six point two inch screen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a six point five.</v>

2620
01:59:43.570 --> 01:59:46.290
<v Speaker 3>Six point five inch screen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's that?</v>

2621
01:59:46.330 --> 01:59:49.990
<v Speaker 3>It was six point three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's bigger than the galaxy mega.</v>

2622
01:59:50.050 --> 01:59:52.360
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that thing.</v>

2623
01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:53.313
<v Speaker 3>Endless entertainment mega for x zoom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that thing's still had the forehead </v>

2624
01:59:59.411 --> 02:00:00.244
<v Speaker 3>and the bezels on the Chin and bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really in comparison to that horrible </v>

2625
02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:05.793
<v Speaker 3>iphone eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda the same galaxy mega 16 </v>

2626
02:00:08.381 --> 02:00:10.930
<v Speaker 3>gigabytes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woo Baby.</v>

2627
02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:14.620
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that thing.</v>

2628
02:00:14.621 --> 02:00:16.840
<v Speaker 3>That's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what year that was.</v>

2629
02:00:16.841 --> 02:00:18.140
<v Speaker 3>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2630
02:00:18.150 --> 02:00:20.620
<v Speaker 3>don't tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was probably college.</v>

2631
02:00:20.621 --> 02:00:23.500
<v Speaker 3>So like 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20.</v>

2632
02:00:23.501 --> 02:00:25.390
<v Speaker 3>Pulled that thing out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were a pimp.</v>

2633
02:00:25.570 --> 02:00:29.590
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you doing with touch and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shine as movies all the time?</v>

2634
02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:32.200
<v Speaker 3>Battery life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forty four minutes.</v>

2635
02:00:34.610 --> 02:00:35.830
<v Speaker 3>That was a fun time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2636
02:00:35.860 --> 02:00:38.950
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy when you connect your phone </v>
<v Speaker 3>to your car.</v>

2637
02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:41.260
<v Speaker 3>Here's the other one that just happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2638
02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:43.990
<v Speaker 3>this tiny palm phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2639
02:00:43.991 --> 02:00:44.824
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've seen this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a super small phone </v>

2640
02:00:48.340 --> 02:00:53.340
<v Speaker 3>accessory to your normal phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it does almost everything your normal</v>

2641
02:00:54.251 --> 02:00:55.900
<v Speaker 3>phone does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's way smaller.</v>

2642
02:00:55.960 --> 02:01:00.960
<v Speaker 3>It has like a half of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says congratulations.</v>

2643
02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:05.020
<v Speaker 3>You've launched the stupidest product of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the year.</v>

2644
02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:10.120
<v Speaker 3>If it's a phone accessory to your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could have just made a small phone.</v>

2645
02:01:11.110 --> 02:01:13.450
<v Speaker 3>That would have been fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then they made this,</v>

2646
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:14.500
<v Speaker 3>this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>

2647
02:01:14.530 --> 02:01:15.363
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it has to connect to your other </v>

2648
02:01:17.591 --> 02:01:22.591
<v Speaker 3>phone and then it uses the same phone </v>
<v Speaker 3>number but it works sometimes.</v>

2649
02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:24.693
<v Speaker 3>And steph curry is our ambassador and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know anymore why someone would </v>

2650
02:01:29.231 --> 02:01:30.064
<v Speaker 3>want to get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how close does it have to be your </v>

2651
02:01:31.461 --> 02:01:33.160
<v Speaker 3>regular phone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2652
02:01:33.161 --> 02:01:36.250
<v Speaker 3>I think it has its own data or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2653
02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:37.840
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda like an apple watch.</v>

2654
02:01:37.841 --> 02:01:38.674
<v Speaker 3>Like it's an accessory to your phone </v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of is the same form factor as </v>

2655
02:01:42.471 --> 02:01:43.460
<v Speaker 3>a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You put it in your pocket,</v>

2656
02:01:43.461 --> 02:01:44.294
<v Speaker 3>you like go to the gym and you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring that instead of bringing the main </v>

2657
02:01:45.771 --> 02:01:46.604
<v Speaker 3>phone or you just go on a hike and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just don't want to bring your whole </v>

2658
02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:50.690
<v Speaker 3>setup so you just bring the little</v>

2659
02:01:51.220 --> 02:01:54.240
<v Speaker 2>be in the meeting with whatever cokehead</v>
<v Speaker 2>came up with that idea.</v>

2660
02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:55.393
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of any other really great </v>

2661
02:01:57.551 --> 02:02:00.090
<v Speaker 2>reasons to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think the iphone,</v>

2662
02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:02.650
<v Speaker 2>the apple watch sort of has it nailed </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2663
02:02:02.690 --> 02:02:03.523
<v Speaker 2>You get your notifications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it's excessive or that you enjoy </v>

2664
02:02:06.941 --> 02:02:07.774
<v Speaker 2>it even though you're not even using it </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of the features I'm using for </v>

2665
02:02:10.781 --> 02:02:13.300
<v Speaker 2>the fitness aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what else do you use on it?</v>

2666
02:02:13.950 --> 02:02:15.240
<v Speaker 3>Whether or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2667
02:02:15.241 --> 02:02:16.800
<v Speaker 3>so like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have the four g version,</v>

2668
02:02:16.801 --> 02:02:21.060
<v Speaker 3>I get the weather and also it has the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to make calls.</v>

2669
02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:22.410
<v Speaker 3>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I never do.</v>

2670
02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:23.573
<v Speaker 3>We never do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if I wanted to call a restaurant </v>

2671
02:02:25.081 --> 02:02:26.250
<v Speaker 3>and see what kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2672
02:02:26.310 --> 02:02:28.830
<v Speaker 3>hours they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could say hey siri and make a call.</v>

2673
02:02:28.831 --> 02:02:29.780
<v Speaker 3>But yeah.</v>

2674
02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:34.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now is there nothing commensurate in the</v>

2675
02:02:34.111 --> 02:02:34.950
<v Speaker 2>Google world?</v>

2676
02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:40.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's other smartwatches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is technically A.</v>

2677
02:02:40.450 --> 02:02:41.283
<v Speaker 3>Samsung also makes their own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have a galaxy smartwatch that </v>

2678
02:02:43.521 --> 02:02:45.610
<v Speaker 3>has like a kind of a cool spinning </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2679
02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:46.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Galaxy Watch.</v>

2680
02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:48.113
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably the best android </v>

2681
02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:53.020
<v Speaker 3>compatible smartwatch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huawei has a kind of a cool one too.</v>

2682
02:02:53.021 --> 02:02:53.854
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why we did this thing that I thought </v>

2683
02:02:55.541 --> 02:02:59.650
<v Speaker 3>was is the good try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a good try.</v>

2684
02:03:00.730 --> 02:03:01.563
<v Speaker 3>It was a smartwatch that has a digital </v>
<v Speaker 3>screen but then had a mechanical hand </v>

2685
02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:11.670
<v Speaker 3>like so that it looked like a normal </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch on the screen is not on.</v>

2686
02:03:12.430 --> 02:03:13.263
<v Speaker 3>The problem with that is when you go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at like your notifications or </v>

2687
02:03:15.761 --> 02:03:19.180
<v Speaker 3>whatever you get the hands are blocking </v>
<v Speaker 3>the screen.</v>

2688
02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:21.730
<v Speaker 3>So they didn't really think too hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

2689
02:03:21.990 --> 02:03:23.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got to that point and they're like,</v>

2690
02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:24.633
<v Speaker 3>oh you know what we'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll have this button where you press </v>

2691
02:03:26.231 --> 02:03:30.550
<v Speaker 3>it and then the hands like move out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way and then the screen,</v>

2692
02:03:30.580 --> 02:03:33.460
<v Speaker 3>the notification will like move to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>side so you can read it.</v>

2693
02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:38.410
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tried,</v>

2694
02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:40.510
<v Speaker 3>they really tried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tried to be different.</v>

2695
02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:43.030
<v Speaker 3>I respect the hell out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good try wowway.</v>

2696
02:03:43.031 --> 02:03:44.440
<v Speaker 3>But no.</v>

2697
02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:48.130
<v Speaker 2>Now do people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do companies ever come to you and say,</v>

2698
02:03:48.131 --> 02:03:48.964
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really good at reviewing these </v>

2699
02:03:50.201 --> 02:03:51.160
<v Speaker 2>things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2700
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:52.630
<v Speaker 2>are we [inaudible] up here?</v>

2701
02:03:53.830 --> 02:03:54.663
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kinda sorta red came to me before this </v>

2702
02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:00.773
<v Speaker 3>existed in it's in this form a and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't a prototype phase and they were </v>

2703
02:04:04.201 --> 02:04:06.210
<v Speaker 3>still pretty far along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was kinda like,</v>

2704
02:04:06.540 --> 02:04:08.970
<v Speaker 3>should we do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should we put this here?</v>

2705
02:04:09.180 --> 02:04:10.860
<v Speaker 3>Should we keep the headphone Jack?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2706
02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:12.650
<v Speaker 3>I was giving them sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2707
02:04:12.750 --> 02:04:14.700
<v Speaker 3>they kept the headphone Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Little things like that.</v>

2708
02:04:15.010 --> 02:04:17.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part,</v>

2709
02:04:17.461 --> 02:04:18.294
<v Speaker 3>I think what a lot of people don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand about product development is </v>

2710
02:04:20.251 --> 02:04:22.080
<v Speaker 3>it happens many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

2711
02:04:22.081 --> 02:04:24.350
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many months before you ever see the,</v>

2712
02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:27.000
<v Speaker 3>the products show up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know if you remember,</v>

2713
02:04:27.001 --> 02:04:27.834
<v Speaker 3>like all the leaks about the pixel xl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of them guarantee six months before </v>

2714
02:04:31.141 --> 02:04:32.160
<v Speaker 3>the iphone came out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was done.</v>

2715
02:04:32.940 --> 02:04:35.640
<v Speaker 3>Like they knew that that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gonna more than I think any phone that I</v>

2716
02:04:35.641 --> 02:04:36.750
<v Speaker 3>can recall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2717
02:04:36.780 --> 02:04:37.613
<v Speaker 3>So that's the same as the iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they've been working on the </v>

2718
02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:41.033
<v Speaker 3>whatever the next iphone is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been working on that iphone and </v>

2719
02:04:43.231 --> 02:04:44.064
<v Speaker 3>it's probably going to be like a couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>more months and then they're like </v>

2720
02:04:46.501 --> 02:04:50.580
<v Speaker 3>finalizing design and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when you start to see phones come</v>

2721
02:04:50.581 --> 02:04:51.414
<v Speaker 3>out like around like September and </v>
<v Speaker 3>October and they start to all kind of </v>

2722
02:04:55.291 --> 02:04:58.410
<v Speaker 3>resemble each other and then another one</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes out and it looks the same.</v>

2723
02:04:58.411 --> 02:04:59.244
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they saw the phone in </v>
<v Speaker 3>early October and they were like let's </v>

2724
02:05:01.501 --> 02:05:02.334
<v Speaker 3>copy that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they made the next phone two </v>

2725
02:05:03.451 --> 02:05:06.390
<v Speaker 3>weeks later they've been working on this</v>
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>

2726
02:05:06.391 --> 02:05:07.224
<v Speaker 3>So like when the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the whole notch thing was people </v>

2727
02:05:10.381 --> 02:05:12.550
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh I hope Google's trolling us.</v>

2728
02:05:12.551 --> 02:05:13.384
<v Speaker 3>Then that's not really the notch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're going to have this phone </v>

2729
02:05:14.611 --> 02:05:15.444
<v Speaker 3>with no notch.</v>

2730
02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:16.373
<v Speaker 3>Now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been working on this for a long </v>

2731
02:05:17.671 --> 02:05:19.080
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what they planned.</v>

2732
02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:23.070
<v Speaker 3>What is that one phone where the back </v>
<v Speaker 3>slides up for the selfie camera.</v>

2733
02:05:23.580 --> 02:05:24.413
<v Speaker 3>So there's two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what you're thinking of Apo </v>

2734
02:05:25.410 --> 02:05:26.243
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>10.</v>

2735
02:05:26.410 --> 02:05:27.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a pretty.</v>

2736
02:05:27.901 --> 02:05:30.360
<v Speaker 3>I like the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty cool,</v>

2737
02:05:30.420 --> 02:05:31.111
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2738
02:05:31.111 --> 02:05:33.840
<v Speaker 3>how long is that thing gonna work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the question.</v>

2739
02:05:33.990 --> 02:05:37.130
<v Speaker 3>So phones are no chips in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2740
02:05:37.230 --> 02:05:40.050
<v Speaker 3>any little bit of breeze motors?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2741
02:05:40.051 --> 02:05:42.570
<v Speaker 3>Phones are solid state for the most part</v>
<v Speaker 3>for good reason.</v>

2742
02:05:42.571 --> 02:05:43.404
<v Speaker 3>You don't want a lot of moving parts in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a phone that you're like running around </v>

2743
02:05:45.661 --> 02:05:46.494
<v Speaker 3>with A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's another one called the Vivo </v>

2744
02:05:49.170 --> 02:05:50.370
<v Speaker 3>Apex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A.</v>

2745
02:05:50.380 --> 02:05:51.870
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's another vivo phone.</v>

2746
02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:52.793
<v Speaker 3>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nex is what it's called and it has just </v>

2747
02:05:54.661 --> 02:05:55.494
<v Speaker 3>the selfie camera pop up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Testing that one too and that's another </v>

2748
02:05:58.111 --> 02:05:58.680
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2749
02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:00.900
<v Speaker 3>well what if a grain of sand gets in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>

2750
02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:02.460
<v Speaker 3>Like is it toasts?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Immediately,</v>

2751
02:06:02.850 --> 02:06:05.190
<v Speaker 3>drop that soccer on the beefy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drop it while it's open.</v>

2752
02:06:05.191 --> 02:06:08.000
<v Speaker 3>Is that over by evo next?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2753
02:06:08.020 --> 02:06:10.740
<v Speaker 3>Any excess or next?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I'm supposed to say next</v>

2754
02:06:10.741 --> 02:06:13.050
<v Speaker 3>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's a.</v>

2755
02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:15.720
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks cool because now look,</v>

2756
02:06:15.721 --> 02:06:17.370
<v Speaker 3>you have the fingerprint reader under </v>
<v Speaker 3>the glass.</v>

2757
02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:18.473
<v Speaker 3>You have all the way to the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the screen and then all the way to the </v>

2758
02:06:20.071 --> 02:06:21.960
<v Speaker 3>top is the screen and then you just have</v>
<v Speaker 3>the selfie camera.</v>

2759
02:06:22.170 --> 02:06:24.020
<v Speaker 3>It looks amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

2760
02:06:24.150 --> 02:06:24.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2761
02:06:24.780 --> 02:06:26.250
<v Speaker 3>no bezels at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2762
02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:27.113
<v Speaker 3>Or basically no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bezels pretty much tiny chin at the </v>

2763
02:06:29.101 --> 02:06:32.400
<v Speaker 3>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the idea is like we're in this</v>

2764
02:06:32.401 --> 02:06:35.430
<v Speaker 3>sort of a race to get to a Bezel this </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>

2765
02:06:36.050 --> 02:06:36.883
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I guess that's the closest we can </v>

2766
02:06:39.691 --> 02:06:40.524
<v Speaker 3>get right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just having a little mechanical </v>

2767
02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:42.780
<v Speaker 3>thing pop out.</v>

2768
02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:46.470
<v Speaker 3>I think what we want is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stuff to be behind the glass.</v>

2769
02:06:46.580 --> 02:06:48.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A camera behind the glass.</v>

2770
02:06:48.541 --> 02:06:51.240
<v Speaker 3>But then how would you see the image?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2771
02:06:51.330 --> 02:06:52.163
<v Speaker 3>so I think if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on what I know about the physics </v>

2772
02:06:55.921 --> 02:06:56.754
<v Speaker 3>of the technology you need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need an oled display and you need </v>

2773
02:07:00.271 --> 02:07:01.104
<v Speaker 3>the camera to be behind the oled display</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when you light up the camera </v>

2774
02:07:05.400 --> 02:07:06.233
<v Speaker 3>you need like a little black circle </v>
<v Speaker 3>where those pixels are off so that they </v>

2775
02:07:09.871 --> 02:07:10.704
<v Speaker 3>can shine through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if this is all making </v>

2776
02:07:11.611 --> 02:07:12.444
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're still going to always </v>

2777
02:07:13.681 --> 02:07:18.681
<v Speaker 3>have some sort of a black circle in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of the phone somewhere.</v>

2778
02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:19.833
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating about iphone versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>android is that there's so much more </v>

2779
02:07:23.071 --> 02:07:23.904
<v Speaker 3>room for possibility with android </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have so many different </v>

2780
02:07:26.011 --> 02:07:29.220
<v Speaker 3>manufacturers that are competing in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>marketplace.</v>

2781
02:07:29.250 --> 02:07:30.083
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to find some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way to shine and that was where the </v>

2782
02:07:33.571 --> 02:07:34.404
<v Speaker 3>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

2783
02:07:34.410 --> 02:07:36.040
<v Speaker 3>was it the mate rs</v>

2784
02:07:36.610 --> 02:07:37.443
<v Speaker 1>with like the Porsche Design version </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I thought that was a really </v>

2785
02:07:40.061 --> 02:07:42.520
<v Speaker 1>interesting film because it was stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive,</v>

2786
02:07:42.910 --> 02:07:47.910
<v Speaker 1>but it had a gigantic battery and had an</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible 20 megapixel camera.</v>

2787
02:07:48.970 --> 02:07:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Great night photos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Low light photos.</v>

2788
02:07:52.420 --> 02:07:53.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2789
02:07:53.261 --> 02:07:53.720
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2790
02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:56.160
<v Speaker 1>they really tried to do like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2791
02:07:56.200 --> 02:07:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Porsche designed does a lot of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2792
02:07:57.851 --> 02:08:00.180
<v Speaker 1>They do sunglasses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2793
02:08:00.830 --> 02:08:01.663
<v Speaker 1>Ballpoint pens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do all kinds of weird stuff and </v>

2794
02:08:03.020 --> 02:08:05.500
<v Speaker 1>really has nothing to do with the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they've really.</v>

2795
02:08:06.100 --> 02:08:06.933
<v Speaker 1>They design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They came up with something really high </v>

2796
02:08:09.581 --> 02:08:13.060
<v Speaker 1>end and they showed there's some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a market for that.</v>

2797
02:08:13.150 --> 02:08:13.901
<v Speaker 1>Is that it right there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2798
02:08:13.901 --> 02:08:17.350
<v Speaker 1>that's it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phone now they did with the mate 20.</v>

2799
02:08:17.351 --> 02:08:20.590
<v Speaker 1>They did the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great looking fun,</v>

2800
02:08:21.340 --> 02:08:22.173
<v Speaker 1>but it's a again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at like how much you have </v>

2801
02:08:24.491 --> 02:08:27.010
<v Speaker 1>to pay versus what extra you're getting.</v>

2802
02:08:27.460 --> 02:08:31.700
<v Speaker 1>You might as well just get the mate 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pro and not worry about the science.</v>

2803
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:35.680
<v Speaker 1>People want that Porsche design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then just to go look at me.</v>

2804
02:08:35.681 --> 02:08:38.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm a baller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made a bitch fade.</v>

2805
02:08:38.890 --> 02:08:41.950
<v Speaker 1>They did the same like Porsche does that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lamborghini does that.</v>

2806
02:08:42.010 --> 02:08:44.260
<v Speaker 1>A Ferrari does that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tesla does that.</v>

2807
02:08:44.261 --> 02:08:47.650
<v Speaker 1>There is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Lamborghini addition.</v>

2808
02:08:47.651 --> 02:08:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Apo fine 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2809
02:08:49.980 --> 02:08:50.813
<v Speaker 1>Like carbon fiber and phone though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to put it on the car and it </v>

2810
02:08:54.611 --> 02:08:56.050
<v Speaker 1>looks dope on the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

2811
02:08:56.290 --> 02:08:59.710
<v Speaker 1>That's a dope looking phone period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you mess with that phone at all?</v>

2812
02:09:00.170 --> 02:09:00.631
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2813
02:09:00.631 --> 02:09:02.920
<v Speaker 1>I mess with the May 20 but not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>porsche design one,</v>

2814
02:09:03.010 --> 02:09:03.843
<v Speaker 1>but it comes down to like using the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone itself is going to be pretty much </v>

2815
02:09:07.421 --> 02:09:09.790
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like once you get past like the design,</v>

2816
02:09:09.791 --> 02:09:10.624
<v Speaker 1>which is a little bit different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you open up the phone and the software </v>

2817
02:09:12.521 --> 02:09:13.354
<v Speaker 1>is you'd get a cool couple wallpapers </v>
<v Speaker 1>but like it's the same phone and on the </v>

2818
02:09:16.661 --> 02:09:20.710
<v Speaker 1>inside a little more storage maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically the same thing.</v>

2819
02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:22.113
<v Speaker 1>But I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it fascinating that they've </v>

2820
02:09:23.441 --> 02:09:26.650
<v Speaker 1>decided to go that far out into the high</v>
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>

2821
02:09:26.651 --> 02:09:28.300
<v Speaker 1>deep end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2822
02:09:28.390 --> 02:09:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I guess you have to differentiate </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself at $20,000,</v>

2823
02:09:32.681 --> 02:09:33.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2824
02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:33.993
<v Speaker 1>Starts at $2,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess as hype as you want to get </v>

2825
02:09:36.101 --> 02:09:38.320
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like are you going to go pay $2,000</v>

2826
02:09:38.321 --> 02:09:39.700
<v Speaker 1>for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>

2827
02:09:39.940 --> 02:09:43.290
<v Speaker 1>But then when the note nine came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of took a lot of the window.</v>

2828
02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:44.133
<v Speaker 1>They're sales battery was the same size </v>
<v Speaker 1>cameras for fairly similar big ass </v>

2829
02:09:48.761 --> 02:09:49.594
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing about phones is we </v>

2830
02:09:52.041 --> 02:09:52.874
<v Speaker 1>got all these phones that are a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars now and it's made it so easy to </v>

2831
02:09:57.851 --> 02:10:01.110
<v Speaker 1>just bump up the price of your phone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not have anyone blink an eye.</v>

2832
02:10:01.470 --> 02:10:02.303
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the iphone 10 starts at a </v>

2833
02:10:06.130 --> 02:10:06.670
<v Speaker 1>thousand dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2834
02:10:06.670 --> 02:10:11.670
<v Speaker 1>So then the iphone 10 art came out and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think they could have priced it anywhere</v>

2835
02:10:12.071 --> 02:10:15.310
<v Speaker 1>from 6:50</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 8:50</v>

2836
02:10:15.730 --> 02:10:17.890
<v Speaker 1>and they just nestle it right in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>at 7:15</v>

2837
02:10:17.891 --> 02:10:18.311
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2838
02:10:18.311 --> 02:10:21.820
<v Speaker 1>that's way cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then this phone comes out Pixel Pixel</v>

2839
02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:22.833
<v Speaker 1>and Pixel xl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably don't remember what the </v>

2840
02:10:24.521 --> 02:10:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Pixel to cost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the pixel three starts at seven 99,</v>

2841
02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:30.610
<v Speaker 1>which seems like that's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable,</v>

2842
02:10:30.611 --> 02:10:33.470
<v Speaker 1>right in that range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hundred $50 more expensive than</v>

2843
02:10:33.471 --> 02:10:34.304
<v Speaker 1>last year.</v>

2844
02:10:34.950 --> 02:10:35.783
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what's so much better about pixel </v>

2845
02:10:39.171 --> 02:10:41.860
<v Speaker 3>three then pixel to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a dollar is more.</v>

2846
02:10:42.170 --> 02:10:43.003
<v Speaker 3>The market is just lifted everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>plus $200 so that a thousand dollars as </v>

2847
02:10:47.891 --> 02:10:50.360
<v Speaker 3>a high end now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's what's convinced.</v>

2848
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:51.223
<v Speaker 3>Companies like Wowway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if we want to compete with apple </v>

2849
02:10:53.060 --> 02:10:55.820
<v Speaker 3>and really make what seems and looks </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a premium phone,</v>

2850
02:10:55.970 --> 02:10:59.750
<v Speaker 3>we have to charge $1,200</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that people know it's better than the</v>

2851
02:10:59.751 --> 02:11:01.790
<v Speaker 3>iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we charge $800,</v>

2852
02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.920
<v Speaker 3>they're not gonna think it's better than</v>
<v Speaker 3>the iphone.</v>

2853
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:05.263
<v Speaker 3>We have to charge more than apple </v>
<v Speaker 3>charging to prove that we have more in </v>

2854
02:11:08.481 --> 02:11:09.270
<v Speaker 3>our phone,</v>

2855
02:11:09.270 --> 02:11:12.450
<v Speaker 2>but plus is interesting because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>really reasonable,</v>

2856
02:11:12.451 --> 02:11:13.680
<v Speaker 2>but their specs are very high.</v>

2857
02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:14.790
<v Speaker 3>I liked them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2858
02:11:14.791 --> 02:11:15.624
<v Speaker 3>they've had a good history of like they </v>
<v Speaker 3>usually listen to what people seem to </v>

2859
02:11:18.551 --> 02:11:19.384
<v Speaker 3>want and a phone and they're also good </v>
<v Speaker 3>at like picking high end numbers that </v>

2860
02:11:22.301 --> 02:11:23.134
<v Speaker 3>look great on paper and usually </v>
<v Speaker 3>translate pretty well to using the </v>

2861
02:11:26.381 --> 02:11:27.670
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2862
02:11:28.330 --> 02:11:29.163
<v Speaker 3>but they always cut out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They cut as many corners as they can to </v>

2863
02:11:32.561 --> 02:11:34.990
<v Speaker 3>get the price as low as they can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their phone.</v>

2864
02:11:34.991 --> 02:11:37.420
<v Speaker 3>Last year it was about 550 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2865
02:11:38.110 --> 02:11:40.030
<v Speaker 3>All glass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no wireless charging.</v>

2866
02:11:40.090 --> 02:11:42.220
<v Speaker 3>But it's glass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have dual cameras.</v>

2867
02:11:42.550 --> 02:11:44.680
<v Speaker 3>You hardly ever use a second camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still cameras.</v>

2868
02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:47.710
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight gigs of Ram snapdragon 8:45.</v>

2869
02:11:47.711 --> 02:11:50.080
<v Speaker 3>A lot of phones have the same specs now </v>
<v Speaker 3>these days.</v>

2870
02:11:50.081 --> 02:11:53.740
<v Speaker 3>But like they've gotten pretty good at </v>
<v Speaker 3>like going the opposite direction.</v>

2871
02:11:53.741 --> 02:11:55.600
<v Speaker 3>Like we're not going to charge a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand bucks.</v>

2872
02:11:55.601 --> 02:11:58.780
<v Speaker 3>We're going to make a that same phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trust us,</v>

2873
02:11:58.781 --> 02:12:01.090
<v Speaker 3>it's the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for way less money,</v>

2874
02:12:01.250 --> 02:12:02.083
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a much more popular direction to </v>

2875
02:12:03.491 --> 02:12:04.660
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As far as sales,</v>

2876
02:12:04.830 --> 02:12:05.663
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've done the same strategy for the </v>

2877
02:12:06.541 --> 02:12:08.040
<v Speaker 2>newest one plus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2878
02:12:08.580 --> 02:12:10.500
<v Speaker 2>And they're coming out with a new one </v>
<v Speaker 2>this month.</v>

2879
02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:12.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one plus 16.</v>

2880
02:12:12.850 --> 02:12:16.170
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They keep the headphone Jack so far.</v>

2881
02:12:16.290 --> 02:12:18.660
<v Speaker 2>So far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack is a weird one.</v>

2882
02:12:18.661 --> 02:12:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2883
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:21.570
<v Speaker 2>how is Samsung going to hold onto that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sucker?</v>

2884
02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:22.433
<v Speaker 2>Samsung's been very popular for keeping </v>
<v Speaker 2>the headphone Jack and not having a </v>

2885
02:12:25.291 --> 02:12:26.124
<v Speaker 2>notch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like the last ones to have a </v>

2886
02:12:28.621 --> 02:12:31.140
<v Speaker 2>headphone Jack and no notch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2887
02:12:31.141 --> 02:12:35.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of the way the note nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks when I'm using it.</v>

2888
02:12:35.430 --> 02:12:40.140
<v Speaker 2>That's a beautiful device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels net premium and the hand.</v>

2889
02:12:40.170 --> 02:12:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2890
02:12:41.850 --> 02:12:44.160
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is wrong with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>With no nine?</v>

2891
02:12:44.210 --> 02:12:45.043
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2892
02:12:45.070 --> 02:12:50.070
<v Speaker 3>My biggest problem with note nine is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>front facing camera and the software and</v>

2893
02:12:50.741 --> 02:12:52.750
<v Speaker 3>the software is not even that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

2894
02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:56.050
<v Speaker 3>it's gotten slow for me quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times,</v>

2895
02:12:56.051 --> 02:12:56.884
<v Speaker 3>like I've been using note nine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also don't think it's the prettiest </v>

2896
02:12:58.871 --> 02:13:01.360
<v Speaker 3>software.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really like Samsung screens,</v>

2897
02:13:01.361 --> 02:13:02.860
<v Speaker 3>so I know they can make good looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

2898
02:13:03.010 --> 02:13:06.400
<v Speaker 3>but I think if they made A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you remember Google play</v>

2899
02:13:06.401 --> 02:13:07.234
<v Speaker 3>addition when they used to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they made a Google play edition </v>

2900
02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:11.193
<v Speaker 3>galaxy note nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would instantly by that phone that </v>

2901
02:13:13.231 --> 02:13:14.064
<v Speaker 3>would be sick because I love Google's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like software being cleaner and looking </v>

2902
02:13:17.441 --> 02:13:20.180
<v Speaker 3>a little better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at Samsung software,</v>

2903
02:13:20.181 --> 02:13:22.090
<v Speaker 3>it looks kind of cartoony a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

2904
02:13:22.220 --> 02:13:24.580
<v Speaker 3>Very colorful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a problem,</v>

2905
02:13:24.581 --> 02:13:25.660
<v Speaker 3>but it's just not my favorite.</v>

2906
02:13:25.820 --> 02:13:26.653
<v Speaker 2>I know some people have figured out a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to use the google launcher on other </v>

2907
02:13:30.261 --> 02:13:32.790
<v Speaker 2>phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they other phones look like a pixel.</v>

2908
02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:33.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>

2909
02:13:34.170 --> 02:13:35.003
<v Speaker 3>You can go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can only go so far back like you </v>

2910
02:13:37.381 --> 02:13:38.214
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can use the Google launcher and you </v>

2911
02:13:39.391 --> 02:13:40.224
<v Speaker 3>can use an icon packed use google icons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still you're going to have your </v>

2912
02:13:43.411 --> 02:13:45.520
<v Speaker 3>settings pull down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still gonna look like Samsung.</v>

2913
02:13:45.521 --> 02:13:46.354
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have in the apps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the settings app is still going to </v>

2914
02:13:48.751 --> 02:13:52.710
<v Speaker 3>look like the Samsung settings app.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're still gonna have three email apps</v>

2915
02:13:52.711 --> 02:13:54.270
<v Speaker 3>and three messaging apps and all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2916
02:13:54.271 --> 02:13:55.060
<v Speaker 3>Samsung on his does,</v>

2917
02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:56.720
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the messaging apps are weird.</v>

2918
02:13:56.760 --> 02:13:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Do you want this one to beard to fault </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like.</v>

2919
02:13:58.510 --> 02:13:59.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that is.</v>

2920
02:13:59.610 --> 02:14:01.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just that one.</v>

2921
02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:03.030
<v Speaker 3>I just want to use one and not have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>message.</v>

2922
02:14:03.031 --> 02:14:04.080
<v Speaker 3>Plus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2923
02:14:04.150 --> 02:14:08.280
<v Speaker 3>like why is it better if you use a </v>
<v Speaker 3>verizon Samsung note,</v>

2924
02:14:08.281 --> 02:14:09.114
<v Speaker 3>I think you end up with three messaging </v>
<v Speaker 3>apps like verizon messages of rise in </v>

2925
02:14:13.231 --> 02:14:18.231
<v Speaker 3>Messenger and then there's the message </v>
<v Speaker 3>plus on this Google's messenger and it's</v>

2926
02:14:18.321 --> 02:14:19.154
<v Speaker 3>just a lot and then there's hangouts and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then how do I even get in touch with so </v>

2927
02:14:22.241 --> 02:14:23.010
<v Speaker 3>on anymore.</v>

2928
02:14:23.010 --> 02:14:23.843
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering if there's ever going to </v>

2929
02:14:24.901 --> 02:14:25.734
<v Speaker 2>be a time where something happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>technologically where the walled garden </v>

2930
02:14:30.181 --> 02:14:33.510
<v Speaker 2>of apple sort of dissolves and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything becomes accessible.</v>

2931
02:14:33.770 --> 02:14:34.603
<v Speaker 3>Apple will fight till they die to let </v>
<v Speaker 3>that wall that they will never let that </v>

2932
02:14:38.511 --> 02:14:39.440
<v Speaker 3>go down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

2933
02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:43.730
<v Speaker 3>That's like one of their biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most prideful accomplishment is building</v>

2934
02:14:43.731 --> 02:14:44.564
<v Speaker 3>that wall.</v>

2935
02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:45.473
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they really have nailed it now other </v>

2936
02:14:47.101 --> 02:14:50.520
<v Speaker 2>than brand loyalty and other than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>prestige of having an apple product,</v>

2937
02:14:50.521 --> 02:14:52.110
<v Speaker 2>which is all very high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2938
02:14:52.170 --> 02:14:54.400
<v Speaker 2>That walled garden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where it's at.</v>

2939
02:14:54.510 --> 02:14:59.510
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever tried to leave an iphone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did like that's a thing.</v>

2940
02:15:00.030 --> 02:15:00.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2941
02:15:00.710 --> 02:15:02.190
<v Speaker 2>It was a fucking nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2942
02:15:02.260 --> 02:15:03.093
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get text messages and very </v>

2943
02:15:04.851 --> 02:15:05.661
<v Speaker 2>calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's the thing.</v>

2944
02:15:05.661 --> 02:15:06.494
<v Speaker 2>I even called up apple and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to remove me from your </v>

2945
02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:11.810
<v Speaker 2>message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2946
02:15:11.810 --> 02:15:12.440
<v Speaker 2>From your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2947
02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:14.840
<v Speaker 2>I gave them my email address.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave them a phone number,</v>

2948
02:15:14.841 --> 02:15:18.440
<v Speaker 2>the whole deal and they will why I go </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I went with a pixel phone and it</v>

2949
02:15:18.441 --> 02:15:21.440
<v Speaker 2>was like a pause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just ate a baby.</v>

2950
02:15:22.940 --> 02:15:24.320
<v Speaker 2>It's a different phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Fox.</v>

2951
02:15:24.321 --> 02:15:27.260

2958
02:15:38.391 --> 02:15:39.800
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to shut it off.</v>

2959
02:15:39.870 --> 02:15:41.090
<v Speaker 2>Turn it back on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing,</v>

2960
02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:43.250
<v Speaker 2>you have to start with a new phone </v>
<v Speaker 2>number.</v>

2961
02:15:43.310 --> 02:15:44.540
<v Speaker 2>The Wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2962
02:15:44.570 --> 02:15:46.340
<v Speaker 2>You have to literally start with a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>number.</v>

2963
02:15:46.370 --> 02:15:49.390
<v Speaker 2>You have to start from scratch and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>people get that green mess.</v>

2964
02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:50.513
<v Speaker 3>The reason why I don't make my main </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone number and I found it because I </v>

2965
02:15:53.101 --> 02:15:55.590
<v Speaker 3>know I'm like lowering myself into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>garden.</v>

2966
02:15:55.650 --> 02:15:56.483
<v Speaker 3>Like I can use an iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that will probably never be my main </v>

2967
02:15:59.011 --> 02:16:00.300
<v Speaker 3>sim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have two sims.</v>

2968
02:16:00.630 --> 02:16:03.090
<v Speaker 3>My main number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one everyone has an android phone.</v>

2969
02:16:03.091 --> 02:16:05.500
<v Speaker 3>I think it'll stay that way as long as </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the way</v>

2970
02:16:05.770 --> 02:16:10.770
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you in your particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>profession as a and you're a reviewer of</v>

2971
02:16:11.311 --> 02:16:12.144
<v Speaker 2>all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you kind of have to do that </v>

2972
02:16:13.980 --> 02:16:16.050
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise you'd be in this weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>position of</v>

2973
02:16:16.350 --> 02:16:18.690
<v Speaker 3>not being able to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the thing.</v>

2974
02:16:18.691 --> 02:16:20.270
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there is a video,</v>

2975
02:16:20.340 --> 02:16:21.173
<v Speaker 3>Lou data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually we keep saying Lulu from unbox </v>

2976
02:16:24.121 --> 02:16:25.680
<v Speaker 3>therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clarify.</v>

2977
02:16:25.790 --> 02:16:27.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was like,</v>

2978
02:16:27.420 --> 02:16:29.230
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all went to ces in January,</v>

2979
02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:30.133
<v Speaker 3>all in vegas every year in January.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we just went around the room and </v>

2980
02:16:32.021 --> 02:16:33.790
<v Speaker 3>just went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what phone do you use?</v>

2981
02:16:33.970 --> 02:16:34.803
<v Speaker 3>I saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what phone is in your pocket </v>

2982
02:16:36.551 --> 02:16:37.450
<v Speaker 3>right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take it out,</v>

2983
02:16:37.451 --> 02:16:40.690
<v Speaker 3>show us with fung,</v>
<v Speaker 3>use iphone after iphone after iphone.</v>

2984
02:16:40.750 --> 02:16:42.010
<v Speaker 3>And there was a couple of pixels in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2985
02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:43.900
<v Speaker 3>but every time you ask an iphone person </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2986
02:16:43.901 --> 02:16:45.400
<v Speaker 3>so why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I felt and they're like,</v>

2987
02:16:46.030 --> 02:16:48.410
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm message facetime.</v>

2988
02:16:48.490 --> 02:16:49.323
<v Speaker 3>Like that ecosystem is real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Louis seemed angry about being more </v>

2989
02:16:53.951 --> 02:16:55.750
<v Speaker 3>people weren't using pixels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2990
02:16:55.900 --> 02:16:57.700
<v Speaker 3>there was a whole thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2991
02:16:58.210 --> 02:16:59.043
<v Speaker 3>just whatever phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people who do a </v>

2992
02:17:01.780 --> 02:17:05.230
<v Speaker 3>sponsored videos where they'll talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a phone as if they use it,</v>

2993
02:17:05.380 --> 02:17:06.213
<v Speaker 3>but they don't.</v>

2994
02:17:06.550 --> 02:17:07.383
<v Speaker 3>And that was one of the things that at </v>
<v Speaker 3>ces specifically that we kind of had a </v>

2995
02:17:11.021 --> 02:17:11.854
<v Speaker 3>laugh with at our studio because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would think like if you watched </v>

2996
02:17:14.621 --> 02:17:15.580
<v Speaker 3>everyone's videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2997
02:17:15.610 --> 02:17:16.930
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's using a wowway.</v>

2998
02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:17.793
<v Speaker 3>Everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess while we had a big budget for </v>

2999
02:17:18.821 --> 02:17:23.821
<v Speaker 3>ces and they just paid a bunch of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make mate 10 pro videos at ces.</v>

3000
02:17:25.330 --> 02:17:27.970
<v Speaker 3>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you went into watching a video,</v>

3001
02:17:27.971 --> 02:17:31.450
<v Speaker 3>like what phone is in everyone's pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you would just assume everyone's</v>

3002
02:17:31.451 --> 02:17:33.610
<v Speaker 3>got away mate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ten pro and nobody did,</v>

3003
02:17:33.730 --> 02:17:36.010
<v Speaker 3>which is really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's dirty.</v>

3004
02:17:36.190 --> 02:17:38.800
<v Speaker 3>And then the other thing is about wally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate trashing while away,</v>

3005
02:17:38.801 --> 02:17:41.320
<v Speaker 3>but I also kind of left trashing wildly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3006
02:17:41.410 --> 02:17:42.243
<v Speaker 3>is they have a lot of money to pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrities to tweet ads for awhile way </v>

3007
02:17:47.801 --> 02:17:50.890
<v Speaker 3>basically Gaga being one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3008
02:17:50.891 --> 02:17:52.740
<v Speaker 3>And you heard this story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3009
02:17:53.020 --> 02:17:53.853
<v Speaker 3>so she's tweeted a bunch of wally ads </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I noticed that while she's a brand </v>

3010
02:17:57.731 --> 02:18:01.570
<v Speaker 3>ambassador for awhile way tweeting ads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how much he loves her Huawei phone.</v>

3011
02:18:02.470 --> 02:18:03.303
<v Speaker 3>If you look in the details of the tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always via twitter for iphone and </v>

3012
02:18:08.610 --> 02:18:10.150
<v Speaker 3>it's like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She can use an iphone.</v>

3013
02:18:10.151 --> 02:18:10.984
<v Speaker 3>I don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I thought it was funny so I just </v>

3014
02:18:11.771 --> 02:18:13.570
<v Speaker 3>tweeted it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it blew up.</v>

3015
02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:16.780
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had walway reached out to me like,</v>

3016
02:18:16.781 --> 02:18:18.910
<v Speaker 3>how did you find this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did you know,</v>

3017
02:18:19.180 --> 02:18:21.640
<v Speaker 3>where did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this a mistake?</v>

3018
02:18:21.641 --> 02:18:22.930
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could this be a pr?</v>

3019
02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:24.740
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has this ever malfunction?</v>

3020
02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:25.211
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3021
02:18:25.211 --> 02:18:27.160
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how twitter works.</v>

3022
02:18:27.161 --> 02:18:29.620
<v Speaker 3>Like you can see the data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's clearly an iphone.</v>

3023
02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:32.410
<v Speaker 3>And I thought that was Larry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Larry.</v>

3024
02:18:32.420 --> 02:18:34.150
<v Speaker 3>That's my screenshot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

3025
02:18:34.151 --> 02:18:38.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only did Gaga Dope Bloch Gal Godot,</v>

3026
02:18:38.141 --> 02:18:39.850
<v Speaker 3>the fucking wonder woman lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3027
02:18:39.851 --> 02:18:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Wonder woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonder woman,</v>

3028
02:18:43.241 --> 02:18:44.074
<v Speaker 3>you fucking fake from an iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just funny because look at the </v>

3029
02:18:46.931 --> 02:18:47.764
<v Speaker 3>picture.</v>

3030
02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:51.820
<v Speaker 3>She blocked you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only did she blocked me,</v>

3031
02:18:51.821 --> 02:18:52.654
<v Speaker 3>but way since then has tweeted all they </v>
<v Speaker 3>deleted like her latest tweets and </v>

3032
02:18:57.641 --> 02:18:58.474
<v Speaker 3>repost them from an android phone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's tweeted from android phone ever </v>

3033
02:19:00.521 --> 02:19:01.720
<v Speaker 3>since.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give her respect for that.</v>

3034
02:19:02.430 --> 02:19:04.960
<v Speaker 3>They probably told you lose all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>cash.</v>

3035
02:19:04.961 --> 02:19:07.060
<v Speaker 3>There's no way she's tweeting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she has a team.</v>

3036
02:19:07.090 --> 02:19:07.923
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like whoever was on her team </v>

3037
02:19:09.850 --> 02:19:13.030
<v Speaker 3>tweeting from an iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the fact that she blocked you,</v>

3038
02:19:13.031 --> 02:19:14.530
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those hilarious.</v>

3042
02:19:18.671 --> 02:19:22.480
<v Speaker 3>well I tagged her in and she probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just getting barraged by like people</v>

3043

<v Speaker 3>going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you're using an APP like an iphone.</v>

3044
02:19:24.941 --> 02:19:25.774

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>razor the company who made that a razor </v>

<v Speaker 3>to 30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One meter,</v>

3073
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:33.703
<v Speaker 3>I think also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the weird thing about Ip </v>

3074
02:20:35.271 --> 02:20:38.630
<v Speaker 3>certification is it's just as far as I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3075
02:20:38.631 --> 02:20:39.464
<v Speaker 3>the way it works is you just submit the </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone for a certain test and if it </v>

3076
02:20:42.951 --> 02:20:45.080
<v Speaker 3>passes then you get to say it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>certified.</v>

3077
02:20:45.560 --> 02:20:49.460
<v Speaker 3>And the only difference between Ip 67 </v>
<v Speaker 3>and [inaudible] 68 is ip.</v>

3078
02:20:49.461 --> 02:20:53.450
<v Speaker 3>60 seven is technically certified for 30</v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

3079
02:20:53.510 --> 02:20:58.340
<v Speaker 3>One meter an IP 68 is certified for 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes,</v>

3080
02:20:58.400 --> 02:21:03.400
<v Speaker 3>one point five meters and the meter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes it's two meters,</v>

3081
02:21:04.191 --> 02:21:07.220
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's a little more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's basically just a measurement of</v>

3082
02:21:07.221 --> 02:21:08.560
<v Speaker 3>water pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you.</v>

3083
02:21:08.750 --> 02:21:09.583
<v Speaker 3>There's different half a meter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean water's heavy but like it didn't </v>

3084
02:21:13.461 --> 02:21:15.920
<v Speaker 3>seem that significant to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's basically just water pressure.</v>

3085
02:21:15.921 --> 02:21:17.780
<v Speaker 3>So he splashed the phone a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>harder.</v>

3086
02:21:17.781 --> 02:21:20.210
<v Speaker 3>Is it going to break versus an ip?</v>

3087
02:21:20.210 --> 02:21:21.650
<v Speaker 3>60 eight phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3088
02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:22.633
<v Speaker 3>just seems safe to Ip 68 every time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it must be a big enough difference </v>

3089
02:21:25.491 --> 02:21:27.660
<v Speaker 3>that some of them do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3090
02:21:27.760 --> 02:21:28.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

3091
02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:30.860
