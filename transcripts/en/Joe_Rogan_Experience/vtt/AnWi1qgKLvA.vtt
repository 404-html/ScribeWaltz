00:00:42.971 --> 00:00:44.350
<v Speaker 1>things though.</v>

00:01:16.991 --> 00:01:17.824
<v Speaker 1>And that was like,</v>

55
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be,</v>

56
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.860
<v Speaker 1>and that's how crazy is that way you don't even want to be involved because you</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know that nick was black.</v>

74
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.821
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

75
00:01:49.821 --> 00:01:54.410
<v Speaker 2>if you can help somebody out and they can get rid of it or change the way you</v>

76
00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

77
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

78
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.011
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

79
00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Joe Schilling Mani did Simon [inaudible] relationship with his dad was miles</v>

80
00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:00.260
<v Speaker 2>better before he passed away.</v>

81
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.820
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that pretty powerful.</v>

82
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:02.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

83
00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Joe talked about it on the podcast.</v>

84
00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>He talked about it just,</v>

85
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:08.920
<v Speaker 1>it's completely changed his whole perception of his relationship with his dad,</v>

86
00:02:08.921 --> 00:02:12.160
<v Speaker 1>who his dad was in his life and just he let it all go.</v>

87
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

88
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.020
<v Speaker 1>And that just helped him tremendously.</v>

89
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

90
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.670
<v Speaker 2>What more can you say the na really as a coach,</v>

91
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:17.911
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

92
00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 2>Ian Mccall had said,</v>

93
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

94
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.680
<v Speaker 2>I know they didn't get his fight with Justin Scoggins and that because of the</v>

95
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:23.000
<v Speaker 2>weight,</v>

96
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 2>whatever her name was saying that his life has changed since two inside mine</v>

97
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 2>therapy and doing the,</v>

98
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:28.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

99
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:28.951
<v Speaker 2>work with me,</v>

100
00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 2>not just timeline therapy and not just hypnosis with my coach and in general,</v>

101
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:34.170
<v Speaker 2>cause it's multifaceted really.</v>

102
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.190
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

103
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.390
<v Speaker 2>he said he's lives changed.</v>

104
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:36.660
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

105
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.800
<v Speaker 2>he's a different person.</v>

106
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:38.890
<v Speaker 2>People have no [inaudible].</v>

107
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.271
<v Speaker 2>We know.</v>

108
00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:40.104
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

109
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.430
<v Speaker 2>for me it's great news.</v>

110
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.380
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes it just takes the realization of what's been fucking with you.</v>

111
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.110
<v Speaker 1>That once you realize what it is,</v>

112
00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:50.900
<v Speaker 1>then you have it in your mind and then you can kind of look at it for what it</v>

113
00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:51.321
<v Speaker 1>really is.</v>

114
00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Instead of this like thing that's playing in the background that you can't quite</v>

115
00:02:55.401 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>identify or you or you know what exists but you ignore and you just,</v>

116
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

117
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

118
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 2>you don't ever get over it.</v>

119
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

120
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 2>He says he's interested in I to a client the other week called joy.</v>

121
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:10.861
<v Speaker 2>She's 80 years of age and she was going to a wedding in Spain for our grandson</v>

122
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 2>and she was beside herself.</v>

123
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 2>She was terrified,</v>

124
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.751
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

125
00:03:14.751 --> 00:03:15.131
<v Speaker 2>and we did it.</v>

126
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Just a few things,</v>

127
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

128
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 2>little things to make you consider different ways of looking at the anxiety she</v>

129
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 2>was getting because anxiety is basically a,</v>

130
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 2>you should have your unconscious mind is to focus on what you want because if</v>

131
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 2>you're in an anxious state,</v>

132
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 2>you're focusing on what you don't want,</v>

133
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

134
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.110
<v Speaker 2>There's different levels of it.</v>

135
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

136
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.981
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

137
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 2>she was focusing on what may go wrong,</v>

138
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 2>instead of saying all this will go into a wedding is a celebration of two</v>

139
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 2>People's matrimony,</v>

140
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:37.211
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

141
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to be nice and Dah,</v>

142
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:38.771
<v Speaker 2>Dah,</v>

143
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:38.861
<v Speaker 2>Dah,</v>

144
00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:38.981
<v Speaker 2>Dah.</v>

145
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't focused on that.</v>

146
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 2>She was focused on something else.</v>

147
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.680
<v Speaker 2>I changed that and like she was happy and she went to the wedding and it's,</v>

148
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.451
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

149
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:46.771
<v Speaker 2>he's got,</v>

150
00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:46.931
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

151
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 2>she's 80 years of age.</v>

152
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:49.200
<v Speaker 2>He might not be going to Lowe's or weddings,</v>

153
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 2>let's be honest.</v>

154
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

155
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.303
<v Speaker 2>But if for me,</v>

156
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 2>the job itself,</v>

157
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 2>what can you say about nice?</v>

158
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:55.100
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

159
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 2>it transforms people,</v>

160
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

161
00:03:57.331 --> 00:03:58.790
<v Speaker 2>and I adore it.</v>

162
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Mark Spitz.</v>

163
00:04:00.021 --> 00:04:00.830
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

164
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:01.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that guy.</v>

165
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.130
<v Speaker 1>He was a 76 Olympics I think.</v>

166
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.993
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

167
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.111
<v Speaker 1>It has to be it.</v>

168
00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:07.670
<v Speaker 1>He looks like Burt Reynolds from deliverance.</v>

169
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.990
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

170
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.170
<v Speaker 1>72 72.</v>

171
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

172
00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:10.251
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

173
00:04:10.251 --> 00:04:10.611
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

174
00:04:10.611 --> 00:04:11.480
<v Speaker 1>I forgot about that guy.</v>

175
00:04:11.481 --> 00:04:11.781
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

176
00:04:11.781 --> 00:04:14.030
<v Speaker 1>So he was the first of the,</v>

177
00:04:14.031 --> 00:04:14.864
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

178
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 1>the superstar Michael Phelps type swimmer dudes I think before,</v>

179
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.923
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

180
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.510
<v Speaker 1>I want to say before Phelps came along and I really don't know,</v>

181
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.440
<v Speaker 1>but I think that spits was the guy who won the most gold medals up until that</v>

182
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.320
<v Speaker 1>moment and then Phelps just fucking blew him out of the water.</v>

183
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.303
<v Speaker 1>Where is he now?</v>

184
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

185
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.830
<v Speaker 1>if I had to guess,</v>

186
00:04:33.831 --> 00:04:34.191
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

187
00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:36.950
<v Speaker 1>it looks in an Burt Reynolds movie in the 1970s.</v>

188
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

189
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:39.934
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at him.</v>

190
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.840
<v Speaker 1>I hope that guy still rocks that look,</v>

191
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.350
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if being in water more than a more average,</v>

192
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.420
<v Speaker 1>the average person is better or worse for your,</v>

193
00:04:47.421 --> 00:04:48.260
<v Speaker 1>your skin.</v>

194
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.040
<v Speaker 1>For every probably worse because chlorine is not good for you.</v>

195
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.570
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for Ya.</v>

196
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Chlorine kills everything that's in the water,</v>

197
00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.560
<v Speaker 1>but it also fucks with the floor of your own skin.</v>

198
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

199
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.670
<v Speaker 1>it's not the best stuff in the world for your skin.</v>

200
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

201
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.380
<v Speaker 1>it's sterile water.</v>

202
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.341
<v Speaker 1>What about saltwater?</v>

203
00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:08.390
<v Speaker 1>That's probably better for you.</v>

204
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

205
00:05:08.811 --> 00:05:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Let's say salt water's better for ya.</v>

206
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

207
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.740
<v Speaker 1>So water is interesting man,</v>

208
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.840
<v Speaker 1>because I can't get it in my eyes.</v>

209
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.400
<v Speaker 1>I know some people can get it in their eyes.</v>

210
00:05:16.401 --> 00:05:17.270
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a problem with it.</v>

211
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.931
<v Speaker 1>I get it in my eyes,</v>

212
00:05:17.931 --> 00:05:18.980
<v Speaker 1>it fucking stings.</v>

213
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

214
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Like when I go to,</v>

215
00:05:21.741 --> 00:05:22.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

216
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.821
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

217
00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:23.031
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

218
00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:23.630
<v Speaker 1>the beach,</v>

219
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.650
<v Speaker 1>if I get water in my eyes,</v>

220
00:05:24.651 --> 00:05:25.690
<v Speaker 1>it fucking stinks.</v>

221
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

222
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.800
<v Speaker 1>is that add to your sodium levels?</v>

223
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:28.291
<v Speaker 1>He's not.</v>

224
00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:28.611
<v Speaker 1>It's mark.</v>

225
00:05:28.611 --> 00:05:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Spitz wasn't even using a swim cap.</v>

226
00:05:30.771 --> 00:05:32.240
<v Speaker 1>When you're saying in your eyes were stinging.</v>

227
00:05:32.241 --> 00:05:33.990
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have goggles on either price on it.</v>

228
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

229
00:05:34.551 --> 00:05:36.140
<v Speaker 1>but I'm talking about a pool.</v>

230
00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:38.720
<v Speaker 1>He swam in a pool and the ocean is where my eyes sting.</v>

231
00:05:38.721 --> 00:05:39.554
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

232
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.401
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

233
00:05:40.401 --> 00:05:40.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

234
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.810

<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

237
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.020
<v Speaker 1>he probably swam in a flannel shirt.</v>

238
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Those are looking at his body.</v>

239
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.220

241
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 1>They didn't do any strength and conditioning back there stops showing me just</v>

242
00:05:58.341 --> 00:05:59.031
<v Speaker 1>men in their underwear.</v>

00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 1>y'all got soap?</v>

264
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what he looks like.</v>

265
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.280
<v Speaker 1>He's like some,</v>

266
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.480
<v Speaker 1>some weird fucking dude might've worked out a couple of times in his underwear.</v>

267
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:29.781
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Like that dude with gold chains around your neck.</v>

271
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.410
<v Speaker 1>This is a fucking strange picture.</v>

272
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.020
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really look to swim swimmer body either.</v>

273
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Like the difference between that body and Michael Phelps body or any swimmer</v>

274
00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:44.831
<v Speaker 3>nowadays,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's like pretty different.</v>

276
00:06:46.181 --> 00:06:46.881
<v Speaker 3>Like his legs,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

281
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.480
<v Speaker 3>They don't really seem muscularity kind of seems sexy.</v>

282
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

283
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.880

287
00:06:55.141 --> 00:06:56.370
<v Speaker 1>you beat a guy like Robbie Lawler.</v>

288
00:06:56.371 --> 00:06:59.730
<v Speaker 1>You knock 'em out and in one round you've got to think the momentum coming off</v>

289
00:06:59.731 --> 00:06:59.911
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

290
00:06:59.911 --> 00:07:00.870
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be stunning.</v>

291
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.300
<v Speaker 3>I would love to see fantasy UFC like a show where they take maybe the fighters</v>

292
00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:09.540
<v Speaker 3>that have retired or people that aren't as good as the other fires and have him</v>
