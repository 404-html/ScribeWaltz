56
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's guaranteed they're going to be</v>

<v Speaker 1>The waitresses are all will be well</v>
<v Speaker 1>trained,</v>

60
00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:32.580
<v Speaker 1>the Dj all beyond on point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all the same experience.</v>

61
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.440
<v Speaker 1>It's just a little bit of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>staff,</v>

62
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 1>different staff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

63
00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:39.890
<v Speaker 1>in Kentucky it's like they put emphasis</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the fact that they go,</v>

64
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>if you come here and pay a premium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to laugh your ass off for</v>

65
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:44.160
<v Speaker 1>two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to do,</v>

66
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know what the fuck they're doing</v>

67
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:50.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of those good chains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.243
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

70
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 1>what's up mom and pop clubs does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

71
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:55.680
<v Speaker 1>it really is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it ever put out one?</v>

72
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:56.880
<v Speaker 1>And even if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it does,</v>

73
00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:58.710
<v Speaker 1>maybe those mom and pop one socked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

74
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Why can they compete?</v>

75
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.731
<v Speaker 2>That's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

76
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 2>the problem is I do hear that they do</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

77
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 2>When they tell you you can't work the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other club.</v>

78
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 2>Well I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a member.</v>

79
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:09.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm they levity represents me and I love</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

80
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:13.260
<v Speaker 2>They financed my one hour just recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take some levity is the people that</v>

81
00:03:13.261 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 2>owned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Robert Procurement owns a lot of</v>

82
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a personal friend.</v>

83
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to tell you something</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

84
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying just because I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put the podcasts.</v>

85
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 2>That guy's a great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great guy.</v>

86
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 2>He loves comedy is very competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind that.</v>

87
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:25.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

88
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 2>But I think at the end of the day those</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys are there.</v>

89
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.710
<v Speaker 2>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have said that they,</v>

90
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 2>they only let you do the Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that I have a different booking</v>

91
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 2>agent now who's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Justin Edberg over at super</v>

92
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.270
<v Speaker 2>entertainment.</v>

93
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.820
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to do any club I want and he books</v>

94
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:42.300
<v Speaker 2>me out anywhere I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're with them,</v>

95
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 2>any pressure to not only do the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

96
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.630
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that I had when I was at</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gersh.</v>

97
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Gersh had some secret deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

98
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 2>Info.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

99
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.100
<v Speaker 2>It was really creepy because other clubs</v>
<v Speaker 2>would tell me like a few of them would</v>

100
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:54.461
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

101
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to book you forever and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could never booked you.</v>

102
00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:57.640
<v Speaker 2>And I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

103
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never heard any of this.</v>

104
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.740
<v Speaker 2>I never got any of the deals like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nashville and never did Nashville when I</v>

105
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:03.960
<v Speaker 2>was with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of clubs,</v>

106
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.910
<v Speaker 2>but they just would ignore me because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a relationship.</v>

107
00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:09.340
<v Speaker 2>They develop and they cherish those</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships because they can get more</v>

108
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:10.960
<v Speaker 2>bang for their buck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always gonna happen.</v>

109
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 2>But what I did is that's why you</v>
<v Speaker 2>separate the powers.</v>

110
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 2>That's why you get a booking agent who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to make his own money on you in</v>

111
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:18.430
<v Speaker 2>his own way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it sort of.</v>

112
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 2>There's a fucking dance man between big</v>
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>

113
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.510
<v Speaker 2>which you can't have a fucking society</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this without a big business.</v>

114
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.960
<v Speaker 2>That extends from comedy clubs until,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me pretty much anything.</v>

115
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you example of why that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>good and why it's bad you you.</v>

116
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.520
<v Speaker 2>Let's take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

117
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.470
<v Speaker 2>have you noticed that when you travel</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country,</v>

118
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.620
<v Speaker 2>there aren't a lot of restaurants that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are locally owned,</v>

119
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:41.370
<v Speaker 2>so in other you don't see a lot of mom</v>
<v Speaker 2>and pop restaurants with character.</v>

120
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.650
<v Speaker 2>Lot of times you go into a place and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got hooters,</v>

121
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 2>applebee's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>applebee's,</v>

122
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:46.783
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

123
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.150
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to eat that kind of food.</v>

124
00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really like that kind of food.</v>

125
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather have something with</v>
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>

126
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:53.300
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons I live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

127
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.120
<v Speaker 2>what I like about New York or even</v>
<v Speaker 2>Venice doubt and you're so busy humean</v>

128
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.710
<v Speaker 2>variables but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it.</v>

129
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.430
<v Speaker 2>But it's individual expression and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

130
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:02.260
<v Speaker 2>people from Venice named cook their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>

131
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.610
<v Speaker 2>I liked the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that too.</v>

132
00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 2>And there's something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fun.</v>

133
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.310
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

134
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.640
<v Speaker 2>but what's happened I think is that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a very litigious societies,</v>

135
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.390
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

136
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.870
<v Speaker 2>So if you open it for stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means people are too soupy.</v>

137
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:16.550
<v Speaker 2>But show you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry for you young kids,</v>

138
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm really bombastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means I would use sling those words</v>

139
00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:26.110
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what happened is it bad?</v>

140
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.880
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you open a restaurant,</v>

141
00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:30.020
<v Speaker 2>so when he gets food poisoning and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>sue you,</v>

142
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.410
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

143
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.810
<v Speaker 2>you're a lot of times you better have</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good insurance because keeping up</v>

144
00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 2>with those medical bills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if two people get to,</v>

145
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a for people,</v>

146
00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:40.870
<v Speaker 2>get a cola or whatever it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have a local restaurant,</v>

147
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 2>we'll see later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason that a lot of these</v>

148
00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:46.150
<v Speaker 2>restaurants take a chance of opening up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to make a restaurant work</v>

149
00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:47.290
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason you,</v>

150
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:49.030
<v Speaker 2>you opened a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're pf Chang's,</v>

151
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:52.000
<v Speaker 2>you've got deep pockets and you become a</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporation.</v>

152
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.560
<v Speaker 2>You can withstand any kind of bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 2>you deal with when it comes to lawsuits,</v>

153
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.640
<v Speaker 2>food poisoning or what are they</v>
<v Speaker 2>franchises</v>

154
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 1>or they all protected under the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>umbrella financially,</v>

155
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 1>legally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both actually the mother corporation</v>

156
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.880
<v Speaker 1>that will create these subsidiaries so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they do get sued.</v>

157
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:09.710
<v Speaker 1>They can't come after the mother</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation.</v>

158
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 1>So that's Kinda how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they got deep pockets financing</v>

159
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:14.780
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do appreciate in the mom and pop</v>

160
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 1>aspect of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know also when you're in a town</v>

161
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:20.560
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to go to best buy and know if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a fucking lap price.</v>

162
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Everything has a price you want Walmart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it brings tvs down to $26,</v>

163
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>but but you're gonna pay a price in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways and how has that.</v>

164
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:32.300
<v Speaker 1>One example is main street used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>spring up organically in the American</v>

165
00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:33.134
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

166
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.170
<v Speaker 1>You got main street and he had a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of little shops and those shops were</v>

167
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 1>passed down generation to generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knew each other.</v>

168
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.540
<v Speaker 1>There's something very charming and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful about that,</v>

169
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:42.410
<v Speaker 1>but guess what?</v>

170
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 1>That costs money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is not as efficient as say target on</v>

171
00:06:46.491 --> 00:06:48.020
<v Speaker 1>one side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walmart on the other,</v>

172
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.540
<v Speaker 1>but you pay a price in another way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion,</v>

173
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.540
<v Speaker 1>anonymity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're surrounded by beige walls.</v>

174
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.900
<v Speaker 1>You have no connection to a continuum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell me the difference between</v>

175
00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Kansas City a lot of times and Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Missouri,</v>

176
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:00.140
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

177
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 1>when you walk down the street that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming a very generic looking place</v>

178
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.210
<v Speaker 1>and have and the experiences generic you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go shopping,</v>

179
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.510
<v Speaker 1>you go to an outdoor mall or an indoor</v>
<v Speaker 1>mall depending on the weather and,</v>

180
00:07:11.511 --> 00:07:14.330
<v Speaker 1>and you're gonna find the same exact</v>
<v Speaker 1>stores everywhere you go.</v>

181
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Sure you can get anything you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what at what price?</v>

182
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.380
<v Speaker 1>But it's a little bit like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you buy food for texture and not taste</v>

183
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:24.710
<v Speaker 1>and you want a real taste in food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a lot of time.</v>

184
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 1>It takes a lot of time in the kitchen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>prepare.</v>

185
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't care about thinking of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of food.</v>

186
00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:31.730
<v Speaker 1>I love the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no reservations.</v>

187
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:33.560
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about it on the podcast</v>

188
00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:36.320
<v Speaker 1>all the time and one of the things he</v>
<v Speaker 1>did was he went to New York City and he</v>

189
00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:39.440
<v Speaker 1>went to all the really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really old places where they own the</v>

190
00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:42.380
<v Speaker 1>building and it's a family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went to this Italian,</v>

191
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>owned restaurant Slash Deli.</v>

192
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.550
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda wish I remembered the name</v>

193
00:07:46.551 --> 00:07:48.530
<v Speaker 1>because I haven't saved on the DVR.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>

194
00:07:48.531 --> 00:07:51.060
<v Speaker 1>That shows the best show on television</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Anthony Bourdain,</v>

195
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Bourdain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the best show on television and no,</v>

196
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:54.590
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

197
00:07:54.591 --> 00:07:56.840
<v Speaker 1>ands or buts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's consistently excellent.</v>

198
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 1>He's on point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

199
00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:00.830
<v Speaker 1>I love the way that guy thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he.</v>

200
00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:05.660
<v Speaker 1>He really loves like you went to South</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston to this awesome episode on South</v>

201
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Boston and the way he fucking loves like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a town,</v>

202
00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:13.301
<v Speaker 1>like a real town which South Boston is</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he went to these places in New York</v>

203
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:17.450
<v Speaker 1>and this one Italian bakery or it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deli but not a bakery.</v>

204
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.231
<v Speaker 1>It's got everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:19.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like all these canned meats and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

206
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:24.680
<v Speaker 1>like a meat hanging from dried meats and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheese hanging from the ceiling and shit</v>

207
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:26.180
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy who was running it had been</v>

208
00:08:26.181 --> 00:08:30.020
<v Speaker 1>working there since he was a baby and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in his eighties.</v>

209
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.770
<v Speaker 1>He was old as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His whole family had been by that.</v>

210
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:33.791
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

211
00:08:33.791 --> 00:08:36.560
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is what we're losing this country.</v>

212
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.810
<v Speaker 1>That is exactly the thing is they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

213
00:08:38.811 --> 00:08:42.170
<v Speaker 1>the only way they could do this as if</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one they're stubborn old Italians,</v>

214
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.390
<v Speaker 1>which is a family business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I got rid of the family.</v>

215
00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are we getting there to the family</v>

216
00:08:45.471 --> 00:08:47.570
<v Speaker 1>business they do in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

217
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.640
<v Speaker 1>and they own the building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've owned the building forever,</v>

218
00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:52.850
<v Speaker 1>so that's the only reason why these</v>
<v Speaker 1>exist and it was a fascinating thing to</v>

219
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>watch and the fucking food looks.</v>

220
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.420
<v Speaker 1>So they had spaghetti with meatballs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All my God,</v>

221
00:08:57.421 --> 00:08:59.000
<v Speaker 1>I want to go make the spaghetti with</v>
<v Speaker 1>meatballs.</v>

222
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.750
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I have the wrong gate for the house?</v>

223
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Do I have breadcrumbs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck can I do where I can walk</v>

224
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 1>into a store like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you smell a smell.</v>

225
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.910
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to explain if someone lives in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbus,</v>

226
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:09.721
<v Speaker 1>Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

227
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Like where you're from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all.</v>

228
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.000
<v Speaker 1>That's all city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

229
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

230
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.840
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely a lot of miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also have like a lot of amish</v>

231
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:17.670
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have like the Amish restaurants</v>

232
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:19.970
<v Speaker 1>and you do have like a different kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>know the homage.</v>

233
00:09:19.971 --> 00:09:24.900
<v Speaker 1>They can really cook up a pie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how to fuck to like rabbits with</v>

234
00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:25.920
<v Speaker 1>beards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

235
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:27.780
<v Speaker 1>rabbits with beards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weirdest thing about the amish.</v>

236
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that documentary where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

237
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.370
<v Speaker 1>What's the thing they do called rum</v>
<v Speaker 1>scale or something like that?</v>

238
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.190
<v Speaker 1>I guess when they're graduated from high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

239
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:38.550
<v Speaker 1>they're allowed to go nutty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They nutty and then one time in their</v>

240
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.760
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

241
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.570
<v Speaker 1>they get to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get to party,</v>

242
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.070
<v Speaker 1>they go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go off,</v>

243
00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:45.000
<v Speaker 1>they party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fuck,</v>

244
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.940
<v Speaker 1>they go nutty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they basically hit like</v>

245
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.970
<v Speaker 1>spiritual emptiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the full bore,</v>

246
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.790
<v Speaker 1>like all at once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crash out most of America.</v>

247
00:09:53.791 --> 00:09:58.470
<v Speaker 1>So from every single trash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meth and cocaine haze and then they go,</v>

248
00:09:58.471 --> 00:10:00.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming back to the church where</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone loves me.</v>

249
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.790
<v Speaker 1>They're really literally completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>unprepared.</v>

250
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.130
<v Speaker 1>If you grow up in the amish community</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

251
00:10:05.131 --> 00:10:07.350
<v Speaker 1>it's a very different kind of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>

252
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.860
<v Speaker 1>It's cultish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube to a community and a strong</v>

253
00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:13.560
<v Speaker 1>community with history and also I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really easy.</v>

254
00:10:13.561 --> 00:10:16.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot easier in some ways to grow</v>
<v Speaker 1>up that way because you're,</v>

255
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.520
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're given a your boundaries and the</v>

256
00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:24.150
<v Speaker 1>way to behave and the blueprint for how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live your life is laid out for you.</v>

257
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.030
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times we grow up in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country with no blueprint.</v>

258
00:10:27.031 --> 00:10:28.560
<v Speaker 1>You've got to kind of make it up as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go along,</v>

259
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's a funny blueprint and you must</v>
<v Speaker 1>dress like Johnny Cash and not use</v>

260
00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:35.630
<v Speaker 1>electricity to the kind of blueprint is</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

261
00:10:35.631 --> 00:10:36.660
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

262
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.660
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird blueprint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They smelled too,</v>

263
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:39.503
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a kid.</v>

264
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generalization,</v>

265
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.650
<v Speaker 1>going to be racist against the 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

266
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:49.780
<v Speaker 1>We had field trips to like the zoo and</v>
<v Speaker 1>amusement parks and they would go and</v>

267
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.800
<v Speaker 1>buy like buses and that's one thing as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>child growing up,</v>

268
00:10:52.801 --> 00:10:54.990
<v Speaker 1>you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are these weird people dressed weird</v>

269
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.300
<v Speaker 1>shit was like doh and hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hell's going on here.</v>

270
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:02.250
<v Speaker 1>And they were also busted a lot for like</v>
<v Speaker 1>having raised and stuff all the time in</v>

271
00:11:02.251 --> 00:11:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Columbus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

272
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.020
<v Speaker 1>like where they would catch a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amish people in a barn somewhere with a</v>

273
00:11:07.021 --> 00:11:07.950
<v Speaker 1>bunch of ecstasy.</v>

274
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Like they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not all this innocence that or</v>

275
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 1>whatever it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

276
00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:16.120
<v Speaker 1>I would have to find the name of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's dragged grunge scalar.</v>

277
00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:20.760
<v Speaker 1>Nobody as you can grow up a certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you put an idea in somebody's</v>

278
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:21.151
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

279
00:11:21.151 --> 00:11:23.850
<v Speaker 1>this feels really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really Rumspringa.</v>

280
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.700
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to to stop human</v>

281
00:11:26.701 --> 00:11:29.370
<v Speaker 1>nature and human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you push in one direction,</v>

282
00:11:29.371 --> 00:11:31.850
<v Speaker 1>they pull in another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it with my daughter and I see it</v>

283
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.160
<v Speaker 1>with the three year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating watching a little human</v>

284
00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:37.860
<v Speaker 1>being developed and one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know and you have a daughter the</v>

285
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:38.610
<v Speaker 1>same age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

286
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll know what I'm talking about.</v>

287
00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Like you can see where when you tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>them not to do things,</v>

288
00:11:43.201 --> 00:11:48.030
<v Speaker 1>they want automatically to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's so ingrained.</v>

289
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not something that you teach a</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby,</v>

290
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.930
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's autumn,</v>

291
00:11:51.931 --> 00:11:52.890
<v Speaker 1>it's already in there.</v>

292
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.780
<v Speaker 1>There's a contrarian streak and a human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

293
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.710
<v Speaker 1>It's why any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime you see in any government</v>

294
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:03.340
<v Speaker 1>experiment in history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any society where it's a monarchy and</v>

295
00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:04.420
<v Speaker 1>oligarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

296
00:12:04.421 --> 00:12:06.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a collective as sort of</v>

297
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:08.440
<v Speaker 1>NATO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all going to behave this way and</v>

298
00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:10.390
<v Speaker 1>these are the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People rebel.</v>

299
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.220
<v Speaker 1>It never really works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to.</v>

300
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.100
<v Speaker 1>That's a part of what has made a human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a human being.</v>

301
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.610
<v Speaker 1>It's getting coded into our genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unquestionably.</v>

302
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:20.590
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why Catholic girls are</v>

303
00:12:20.591 --> 00:12:22.690
<v Speaker 1>whores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so simple.</v>

304
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.520
<v Speaker 1>When I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the Catholic girls were slots.</v>

305
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.920
<v Speaker 1>We all knew it and we would joke about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because in Catholic School,</v>

306
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.870
<v Speaker 1>oh shits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd go,</v>

307
00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:33.190
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's in Catholic school.</v>

308
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.950
<v Speaker 1>You knew that when you got that bitch</v>
<v Speaker 1>alone and stuck a finger in her,</v>

309
00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:38.970
<v Speaker 1>she was going to go crazy in your car.</v>

310
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Grab Your Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it was a rope hanging over a canyon</v>

311
00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:45.790
<v Speaker 1>and she fell out of an airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just caught it before sudden death,</v>

312
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.910
<v Speaker 1>like fucking sylvester stallone in</v>
<v Speaker 1>cliffhanger.</v>

313
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.220
<v Speaker 1>And she's going to milk that Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

314
00:12:51.221 --> 00:12:55.930
<v Speaker 1>like it's the sweetest elixir I had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl was telling me about her</v>

315
00:12:55.931 --> 00:12:58.520
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She got nice.</v>

316
00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:02.530
<v Speaker 1>We had an argument which was fun and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we had an argument and I quickly</v>

317
00:13:02.531 --> 00:13:03.364
<v Speaker 1>realized it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

318
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.230
<v Speaker 1>she didn't have a whole lot to base this</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

319
00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:06.930
<v Speaker 1>It was just kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had gone through some kind of a</v>

320
00:13:06.931 --> 00:13:11.931
<v Speaker 1>crisis and then last on the Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I banged her in her car to our theater</v>

321
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:13.390
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

322
00:13:13.391 --> 00:13:14.860
<v Speaker 1>in my car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never forgot this.</v>

323
00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:15.694
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

324
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:16.900
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

325
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:17.743
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

326
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.750
<v Speaker 1>I can't either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have a connection.</v>

327
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.330
<v Speaker 1>We connect it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why all the religious girls are.</v>

328
00:13:22.331 --> 00:13:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the horrors back in high school now</v>

329
00:13:24.161 --> 00:13:25.840
<v Speaker 1>are religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you notice,</v>

330
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:29.850
<v Speaker 1>like I used to be so Douchey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an,</v>

331
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.910
<v Speaker 1>an ultimate confession to make when any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever the subject of religion would</v>

332
00:13:33.911 --> 00:13:35.410
<v Speaker 1>come up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was that guy.</v>

333
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:39.400
<v Speaker 1>I would be so douchey where I'd be like</v>
<v Speaker 1>insulting to you if you believe</v>

334
00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:41.650
<v Speaker 1>something silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be not just dismissive,</v>

335
00:13:41.651 --> 00:13:44.500
<v Speaker 1>but insulting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was such a star because it was,</v>

336
00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.860
<v Speaker 1>no one's doing anything bad to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what it is is there's something</v>

337
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.870
<v Speaker 1>about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when I was young,</v>

338
00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:52.510
<v Speaker 1>when I was 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really considering religion at one</v>

339
00:13:52.511 --> 00:13:54.400
<v Speaker 1>point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very lost.</v>

340
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.110
<v Speaker 1>I was going to join the army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

341
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.170
<v Speaker 1>I was doing taekwondo and I heard the</v>
<v Speaker 1>army had a big taekwondo team,</v>

342
00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:02.050
<v Speaker 1>was this kid named Clayton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Clayton Barber,</v>

343
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.940
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might not be his name,</v>

344
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:06.610
<v Speaker 1>but he was a high level taekwondo guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fought for the army.</v>

345
00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.271
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

346
00:14:07.271 --> 00:14:10.180
<v Speaker 1>they pay for him to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All have to do is give them some cushy</v>

347
00:14:10.181 --> 00:14:12.130
<v Speaker 1>office job and then he gets a train all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

348
00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:15.250
<v Speaker 1>So I was thinking about that and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was terrified of religion.</v>

349
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.530
<v Speaker 1>I was terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like whenever I'd fight someone and I</v>

350
00:14:17.531 --> 00:14:20.050
<v Speaker 1>knew that there were Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would get really nervous because they</v>

351
00:14:20.051 --> 00:14:20.771
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had sort of,</v>

352
00:14:20.771 --> 00:14:23.100
<v Speaker 1>they believed and they had a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>inner strength I would have ever.</v>

353
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if there's a God with God's looking</v>

354
00:14:24.851 --> 00:14:26.710
<v Speaker 1>out for them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really would think that,</v>

355
00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:28.480
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember one time this guy,</v>

356
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.170
<v Speaker 1>he was sitting on the sidelines on one</v>
<v Speaker 1>knee reading a fucking Bible before we</v>

357
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.150
<v Speaker 1>fund.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put that book away.</v>

358
00:14:34.151 --> 00:14:36.910
<v Speaker 1>You Fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put that book like he was going to use</v>

359
00:14:36.911 --> 00:14:40.180
<v Speaker 1>them in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Ghost was nervous,</v>

360
00:14:40.181 --> 00:14:41.290
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got nervous,</v>

361
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:42.880
<v Speaker 1>but you know what that does.</v>

362
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.040
<v Speaker 1>I think what the power of any kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion or anything,</v>

363
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.890
<v Speaker 1>anytime you try to go beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you can measure.</v>

364
00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.690
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of belief has to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>less to do with superstition and more to</v>

365
00:14:52.691 --> 00:14:55.460
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda the same inspiration.</v>

366
00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:58.280
<v Speaker 1>So the the same way you listen to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of music that gets you pumped to</v>

367
00:14:58.281 --> 00:15:01.250
<v Speaker 1>go do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people can derive the same kind</v>

368
00:15:01.251 --> 00:15:04.020
<v Speaker 1>of strength and inspiration from</v>
<v Speaker 1>scripture or whatever it was.</v>

369
00:15:04.021 --> 00:15:06.380
<v Speaker 1>I know they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I have a good friend and I'm not</v>

370
00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:08.840
<v Speaker 1>going to talk about him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's very religious and a lot of</v>

371
00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:11.690
<v Speaker 1>people would be shocked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a pretty strict Catholic and</v>

372
00:15:11.691 --> 00:15:13.250
<v Speaker 1>he's a good friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just let him do his thing.</v>

373
00:15:13.251 --> 00:15:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it's on him.</v>

374
00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:16.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what would keep them happy,</v>

375
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.150
<v Speaker 1>but when I was young I was so douchey</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and really it was somehow or</v>

376
00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:22.340
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was because I was insecure that a,</v>

377
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.850
<v Speaker 1>maybe they were writing or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or be there when I was really young,</v>

378
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.040
<v Speaker 1>but then I started reading religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>history and go,</v>

379
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:28.910
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

380
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is craziness.</v>

381
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know I still.</v>

382
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.960
<v Speaker 1>But what fascinates me is I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read a whole thing on the origins of</v>

383
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.260
<v Speaker 1>Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty interesting.</v>

384
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.393
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

385
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.680
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came to St Louis and I went,</v>

386
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:43.543
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really,</v>

387
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.000
<v Speaker 1>if you really look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

388
00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.560
<v Speaker 1>how much Christ actually said that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can put it on a,</v>

389
00:15:48.561 --> 00:15:50.450
<v Speaker 1>on a four by four card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not a lot.</v>

390
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.540
<v Speaker 1>And then you had all these other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these followers and call for example,</v>

391
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.470
<v Speaker 1>every met him and had this conversion on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the road to Damascus and wrote all these</v>

392
00:15:57.471 --> 00:15:59.900
<v Speaker 1>letters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question becomes why though did</v>

393
00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:03.610
<v Speaker 1>those ideas last 2000 years and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas did.</v>

394
00:16:03.611 --> 00:16:06.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I always fascinates me</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we killed the most people.</v>

395
00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.060
<v Speaker 1>What sense that simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Christians killed them.</v>

396
00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.700
<v Speaker 1>It literally is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

397
00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:12.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with that because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could say the same.</v>

398
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.140
<v Speaker 1>Same thing about fascism and to kill a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people,</v>

399
00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:16.050
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of.</v>

400
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.650
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the Muslims had kicked the ass</v>

401
00:16:18.651 --> 00:16:21.310
<v Speaker 1>that the Christians did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would all be learning that omahamed</v>

402
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.180
<v Speaker 1>was the thing and we wouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrating Christmas with.</v>

403
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.330
<v Speaker 1>You're celebrating some walk around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>big box.</v>

404
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:27.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that there is some.</v>

405
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.470
<v Speaker 1>There is a resilience to things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

406
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.290
<v Speaker 1>love thy enemy and unforgiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that's true,</v>

407
00:16:33.291 --> 00:16:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to understand that all of</v>

408
00:16:34.691 --> 00:16:37.520
<v Speaker 1>this stuff is rehashing old shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to tell you that and the</v>

409
00:16:37.521 --> 00:16:40.940
<v Speaker 1>reason why we are immersed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity's because this epoch,</v>

410
00:16:40.941 --> 00:16:43.910
<v Speaker 1>this world that we're living in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're dealing with a very small amount</v>

411
00:16:43.911 --> 00:16:45.620
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like an enormous amount of time</v>

412
00:16:45.621 --> 00:16:47.090
<v Speaker 1>for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the amount of time that the</v>

413
00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Christian religion has dominated the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth is not the same amount of time.</v>

414
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.970
<v Speaker 1>That back when the Romans were</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominating shit or the Greeks were</v>

415
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:55.640
<v Speaker 1>dominating shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a couple of thousand years on</v>

416
00:16:55.641 --> 00:16:58.130
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much we've only been around for a</v>

417
00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.830
<v Speaker 1>couple hundred years or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country in the world,</v>

418
00:17:00.831 --> 00:17:01.970
<v Speaker 1>the world of Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lewis,</v>

419
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:03.800
<v Speaker 1>2000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let me ask you a question.</v>

420
00:17:03.801 --> 00:17:07.400
<v Speaker 1>How much do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it seems like human beings always</v>

421
00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:12.401
<v Speaker 1>had this sort of need for to impose</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own forms of self restriction and</v>

422
00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.120
<v Speaker 1>discipline and they think it's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>operating system.</v>

423
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's a part of our human</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

424
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.670
<v Speaker 1>but you think that's a natural function</v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

425
00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that we're evolving and we are</v>

426
00:17:22.971 --> 00:17:26.810
<v Speaker 1>in an adolescent stage of evolution and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are something that's in the middle.</v>

427
00:17:26.811 --> 00:17:29.750
<v Speaker 1>We are not quite animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that we are animal.</v>

428
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.140
<v Speaker 1>We know we interact with animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know we have feelings for animals,</v>

429
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:35.420
<v Speaker 1>but we also know that they're not us.</v>

430
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.550
<v Speaker 1>We know where something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even from monkeys.</v>

431
00:17:37.551 --> 00:17:39.470
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why you're allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep monkeys in the zoo,</v>

432
00:17:39.471 --> 00:17:42.380
<v Speaker 1>but you can't have a slave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because we make some sort of a</v>

433
00:17:42.381 --> 00:17:45.560
<v Speaker 1>distinction that we are something</v>
<v Speaker 1>different from them and people will say,</v>

434
00:17:45.561 --> 00:17:46.311
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's stupid.</v>

435
00:17:46.311 --> 00:17:47.600
<v Speaker 1>We're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's wrong.</v>

436
00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:48.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals have rights.</v>

437
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>

438
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't for us being so super</v>

439
00:17:52.831 --> 00:17:54.390
<v Speaker 1>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd all have eaten us.</v>

440
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.290
<v Speaker 1>It's really that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some crazy weird survival thing</v>

441
00:17:58.291 --> 00:18:02.790
<v Speaker 1>going on and the only way to truly be</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy as you have to be on whatever team</v>

442
00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:05.310
<v Speaker 1>you're is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a dog and you're ratting out</v>

443
00:18:05.311 --> 00:18:07.350
<v Speaker 1>all these other dogs and then the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>running around in club,</v>

444
00:18:07.351 --> 00:18:10.860
<v Speaker 1>the dogs that death in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be assured you'll feel terrible</v>

445
00:18:10.861 --> 00:18:11.970
<v Speaker 1>so you don't get in trouble with Joe.</v>

446
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Rogan is not talking about racist and</v>
<v Speaker 1>white black or he's talking about human</v>

447
00:18:15.001 --> 00:18:15.750
<v Speaker 1>rights here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

448
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about animals over other</v>

449
00:18:18.691 --> 00:18:21.090
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the human race as a</v>

450
00:18:21.091 --> 00:18:23.220
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in some weird thing where we're</v>

451
00:18:23.221 --> 00:18:25.650
<v Speaker 1>not quite an animal anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're an animal,</v>

452
00:18:25.651 --> 00:18:28.290
<v Speaker 1>but we're self aware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need food.</v>

453
00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:30.840
<v Speaker 1>We need animal protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need vegetable protein,</v>

454
00:18:30.841 --> 00:18:33.210
<v Speaker 1>we need water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need all the things that are regular</v>

455
00:18:33.211 --> 00:18:35.610
<v Speaker 1>biological unit needs to keep itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive,</v>

456
00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:37.620
<v Speaker 1>so then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we also have some weird awareness</v>

457
00:18:37.621 --> 00:18:39.900
<v Speaker 1>and evolution for you is not just</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological,</v>

458
00:18:39.901 --> 00:18:42.180
<v Speaker 1>it's not just mathematics and bio</v>
<v Speaker 1>biology.</v>

459
00:18:42.181 --> 00:18:42.931
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

460
00:18:42.931 --> 00:18:45.840
<v Speaker 1>We're also evolving from a consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

461
00:18:45.841 --> 00:18:49.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean and and biologists will argue</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you over the semantics,</v>

462
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:52.920
<v Speaker 1>over the word evolution saying the</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution only pertains to a biological</v>

463
00:18:52.921 --> 00:18:55.080
<v Speaker 1>thing that you don't have like evolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>of culture.</v>

464
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:56.940
<v Speaker 1>You have advancement of culture and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

465
00:18:56.941 --> 00:18:58.840
<v Speaker 1>you have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

466
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.590
<v Speaker 1>advanced levels of complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

467
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's not technically evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we all know what the word evolution</v>

468
00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:06.570
<v Speaker 1>means and it's a better word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind using anything that I</v>

469
00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.660
<v Speaker 1>haven't think societies and even the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world as a whole develops a,</v>

470
00:19:10.661 --> 00:19:12.600
<v Speaker 1>their own sort of sense of self</v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness.</v>

471
00:19:12.601 --> 00:19:15.530
<v Speaker 1>We are very aware of what the pitfalls</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

472
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.030
<v Speaker 1>of how to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you get you fall into things like</v>

473
00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:21.210
<v Speaker 1>genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think the world has less brutal as</v>

474
00:19:21.211 --> 00:19:22.460
<v Speaker 1>a whole today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way More,</v>

475
00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:24.150
<v Speaker 1>way more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for us to understand.</v>

476
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.760
<v Speaker 1>I always try to relate this to people</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we talk about the,</v>

477
00:19:26.761 --> 00:19:27.211
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

478
00:19:27.211 --> 00:19:28.980
<v Speaker 1>like people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've had so many conversations,</v>

479
00:19:28.981 --> 00:19:29.680
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

480
00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm Alex Jones is a good friend of mine</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Alex Jones will tell you that right</v>

481
00:19:33.751 --> 00:19:36.420
<v Speaker 1>now that the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end up,</v>

482
00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.210
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so doom and gloom,</v>

483
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some people that I know that I'm</v>

484
00:19:41.041 --> 00:19:43.860
<v Speaker 1>friends with that are so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is the end of the world.</v>

485
00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Like you gotta look at it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bureau,</v>

486
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:50.220
<v Speaker 1>the apocalypse is here but not here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

487
00:19:50.221 --> 00:19:53.640
<v Speaker 1>It's on the earth in certain spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always has been.</v>

488
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.700
<v Speaker 1>It's just back then when you described</v>
<v Speaker 1>the apocalypse and the plague.</v>

489
00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a plague in northern Africa,</v>

490
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.770
<v Speaker 1>but guess where there wasn't a plague in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking China at the same time in China.</v>

491
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:03.250
<v Speaker 1>They were challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were banging,</v>

492
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:04.980
<v Speaker 1>make more Chinese people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>

493
00:20:04.981 --> 00:20:06.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were playing fucking games.</v>

494
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:11.630
<v Speaker 1>It's you have access right now to too</v>
<v Speaker 1>much information for our puny brains and</v>

495
00:20:12.001 --> 00:20:15.540
<v Speaker 1>that's where religion and any sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>predetermined pattern of behavior that</v>

496
00:20:15.541 --> 00:20:18.120
<v Speaker 1>you can follow as an operating system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's been an amish person or</v>

497
00:20:18.121 --> 00:20:20.010
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they come in handy because</v>

498
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:22.140
<v Speaker 1>things so squirrely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are so crazy.</v>

499
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.990
<v Speaker 1>You look the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meltdown in Japan and fucking</v>

500
00:20:24.991 --> 00:20:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Mississippi's underwater and you the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking tornadoes go through Alabama and</v>

501
00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:31.480
<v Speaker 1>birds are falling from the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never ends either way.</v>

502
00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Looking at the view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for shitty things.</v>

503
00:20:33.541 --> 00:20:35.610
<v Speaker 1>You can find them all day and I'll tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you something.</v>

504
00:20:35.611 --> 00:20:37.200
<v Speaker 1>If for any of the young people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening,</v>

505
00:20:37.201 --> 00:20:40.830
<v Speaker 1>if you think it's worse today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up any piece of literature or</v>

506
00:20:40.831 --> 00:20:42.610
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just take a look like.</v>

507
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at Lincoln's life and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>find that back.</v>

508
00:20:45.781 --> 00:20:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Then let's just take Lincoln's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

509
00:20:47.651 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Civil</v>

510
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.870
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

511
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:54.820
<v Speaker 2>you always last two or three or your</v>
<v Speaker 2>children to all kinds of diseases.</v>

512
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.790
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diptheria t,</v>

513
00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:58.450
<v Speaker 2>when was the last time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Do you know who ever died of</v>

514
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.170
<v Speaker 2>whooping cough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diphtheria,</v>

515
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.200
<v Speaker 2>tetanus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smallpox.</v>

516
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.730
<v Speaker 2>These diseases would roll through and</v>
<v Speaker 2>epidemics and it wasn't like the flu or</v>

517
00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.070
<v Speaker 2>a cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You died slowly and horrible and it was</v>

518
00:21:09.071 --> 00:21:11.890
<v Speaker 2>usually your child under a tent that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't touch,</v>

519
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.480
<v Speaker 2>so if anybody tuberculosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tuberculosis,</v>

520
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:17.350
<v Speaker 2>when you got consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is another word for tuberculosis,</v>

521
00:21:17.351 --> 00:21:21.820
<v Speaker 2>and it's just anytime you read any kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of any piece of literature history from</v>

522
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.630
<v Speaker 2>even 50 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is always is always a story about</v>

523
00:21:25.631 --> 00:21:26.890
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eugene O'Neill,</v>

524
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.840
<v Speaker 2>Nobel prize winning playwright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his brother got tuberculosis and he had</v>

525
00:21:31.841 --> 00:21:34.540
<v Speaker 2>to watch him die and long day's journey</v>
<v Speaker 2>into night is about that.</v>

526
00:21:34.541 --> 00:21:35.620
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing you could do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

527
00:21:35.621 --> 00:21:36.430
<v Speaker 2>You know what they do?</v>

528
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Go Up to the mountains and breathed the</v>
<v Speaker 2>air to see if it helps your lungs.</v>

529
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.740
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you fucking died and that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>one disease of of cow.</v>

530
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Look at polio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixty years ago,</v>

531
00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:49.450
<v Speaker 2>50 years ago when kids were on iron</v>
<v Speaker 2>lungs and the best case scenario,</v>

532
00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:51.670
<v Speaker 2>you're child is four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll never walk again.</v>

533
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.400
<v Speaker 2>That was the best case scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but usually you just died because your</v>

534
00:21:54.401 --> 00:21:57.000
<v Speaker 2>lungs didn't hold up and we've invented</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

535
00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:58.630
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the fundamental difference.</v>

536
00:21:58.631 --> 00:22:02.600
<v Speaker 2>Nobody that's listening right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee knows anybody who has even</v>

537
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.790
<v Speaker 2>been crippled by something like polio</v>
<v Speaker 2>scarred by something like smallpox,</v>

538
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.810
<v Speaker 2>so the world in a lot of ways we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeding in the seventies,</v>

539
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.960
<v Speaker 2>in the seventies and in especially in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sixties,</v>

540
00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.800
<v Speaker 2>China and India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Half the world's population was</v>

541
00:22:17.801 --> 00:22:18.850
<v Speaker 2>starving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

542
00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:19.893
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

543
00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:23.770
<v Speaker 2>they had to import grain now in the as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge grain exporter.</v>

544
00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.390
<v Speaker 2>So because of the green revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of what's that guy's name,</v>

545
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.680
<v Speaker 2>one man who came up with ways to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

546
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.100
<v Speaker 2>to grains and things more and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>resistant to drought and things like</v>

547
00:22:33.101 --> 00:22:36.520
<v Speaker 2>that are our advancements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our technological advancements have</v>

548
00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:39.400
<v Speaker 2>pushed us so far beyond our biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even funny.</v>

549
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.930
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>

550
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:44.710
<v Speaker 2>it's so overwhelming and moving so</v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly that people feel like they,</v>

551
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.900
<v Speaker 2>since they can't understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to come up with some kind of</v>

552
00:22:46.901 --> 00:22:49.660
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a debunking mechanism or something they</v>

553
00:22:49.661 --> 00:22:52.570
<v Speaker 2>can understand or at least something</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can hold onto and that's where</v>

554
00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:54.670
<v Speaker 2>religion plays a huge part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think religion,</v>

555
00:22:54.671 --> 00:22:57.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't think technology is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is pushing religion out of the way.</v>

556
00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.230
<v Speaker 2>In some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this huge,</v>

557
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.660
<v Speaker 2>this huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

558
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.360
<v Speaker 2>a multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the exponential growth of technology is</v>

559
00:23:04.361 --> 00:23:09.361
<v Speaker 2>actually ushering in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another wave and that is a wave of very</v>

560
00:23:09.731 --> 00:23:12.580
<v Speaker 2>religious people who have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who don't know how to put this</v>

561
00:23:12.581 --> 00:23:14.890
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technological wave into context,</v>

562
00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.360
<v Speaker 2>tissue regeneration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the stuff we talk about.</v>

563
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:22.300
<v Speaker 2>It's also that you were able to contact</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people in our groups and get very</v>

564
00:23:22.301 --> 00:23:25.420
<v Speaker 2>selective on the internet too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can choose just to hang out in one</v>

565
00:23:25.421 --> 00:23:28.330
<v Speaker 2>or two sort of forums and you can just</v>
<v Speaker 2>think the way they think.</v>

566
00:23:28.331 --> 00:23:30.430
<v Speaker 2>Nick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nick Swardson does such a funny joke</v>

567
00:23:30.431 --> 00:23:32.590
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He ever sees joke about his new job.</v>

568
00:23:32.591 --> 00:23:33.281
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

569
00:23:33.281 --> 00:23:35.200
<v Speaker 2>back before the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had a fetish man,</v>

570
00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.090
<v Speaker 2>it was just really hard to find like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

571
00:23:37.091 --> 00:23:38.800
<v Speaker 2>a group or just anybody you could get</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit with you.</v>

572
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.240
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to go out to dinner and be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

573
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:41.560
<v Speaker 2>I'll be right back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>

574
00:23:41.561 --> 00:23:43.840
<v Speaker 2>Go to the bathroom unless you want me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>piss on your face.</v>

575
00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:45.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kidding.</v>

576
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.030
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's true.</v>

577
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Feel it out and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many weird groups that we're</v>

578
00:23:54.111 --> 00:23:57.620
<v Speaker 1>finding out about from doing this</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast and you have to talk to porn</v>

579
00:23:57.621 --> 00:23:58.910
<v Speaker 1>stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>

580
00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.610
<v Speaker 1>They hold you down and sometimes you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

581
00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:03.530
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get into conversations like you</v>

582
00:24:03.531 --> 00:24:06.440
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you find out things like cream pies</v>

583
00:24:06.441 --> 00:24:09.080
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and foot jobs and all these different,</v>

584
00:24:09.081 --> 00:24:12.140
<v Speaker 1>like really creepy things that are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally standard.</v>

585
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Their standard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's used to be fine.</v>

586
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:18.980
<v Speaker 1>When I was 14 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we always used to find porn in the woods</v>

587
00:24:18.981 --> 00:24:21.500
<v Speaker 1>and everyone shares this story is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

588
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:23.390
<v Speaker 1>all over the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in Boston.</v>

589
00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.940
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to friends that grew up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>La.</v>

590
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.490
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You found porn in the woods.</v>

591
00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.520
<v Speaker 1>We all used to find magazines in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>woods and I remember,</v>

592
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.780
<v Speaker 1>I will remember this.</v>

593
00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:37.780
<v Speaker 1>This is the very day that the darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dark side of sexuality was revealed</v>

594
00:24:38.301 --> 00:24:40.220
<v Speaker 1>to me because normally when you find</v>
<v Speaker 1>these magazines,</v>

595
00:24:40.221 --> 00:24:42.530
<v Speaker 1>you'd find like Time magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

596
00:24:42.531 --> 00:24:44.540
<v Speaker 1>and then there would be like a playboy</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of it.</v>

597
00:24:44.541 --> 00:24:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Someone who would be naughty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

598
00:24:46.671 --> 00:24:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Like if you would find what over</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's house,</v>

599
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.780
<v Speaker 1>but if you find them in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

600
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:52.610
<v Speaker 1>like I never bought a magazine until I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like 20.</v>

601
00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.730
<v Speaker 1>You always found them over someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>house or you stole it from Your Dad's</v>

602
00:24:55.731 --> 00:24:58.490
<v Speaker 1>bathroom or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the magazines that you would get</v>

603
00:24:58.491 --> 00:25:01.010
<v Speaker 1>from your dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like penthouse if you're lucky.</v>

604
00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:02.960
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go gynecological more.</v>

605
00:25:02.961 --> 00:25:07.070
<v Speaker 1>They show the pussy spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I was in the woods,</v>

606
00:25:07.071 --> 00:25:10.310
<v Speaker 1>you'd find like Hustler and Sherry and</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

607
00:25:10.311 --> 00:25:12.910
<v Speaker 1>screw and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

608
00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:15.920
<v Speaker 1>I stumbled upon this one magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was me and my friends,</v>

609
00:25:15.921 --> 00:25:19.820
<v Speaker 1>and I'll never forget this</v>
<v Speaker 1>because my friend Juan,</v>

610
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:22.280
<v Speaker 1>my friend Juan Alvarado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

611
00:25:22.281 --> 00:25:24.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the first one to talk and we were</v>

612
00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:27.560
<v Speaker 1>all sitting around looking at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>magazine and we peel through it page by</v>

613
00:25:27.561 --> 00:25:30.570
<v Speaker 1>page for like five minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just page.</v>

614
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.630
<v Speaker 1>And he finally goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

615
00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I think this magazines all dicks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>

616
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.960
<v Speaker 1>It was the whole magazine was Dixon</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>

617
00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.020
<v Speaker 1>And I remember this because also it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time my friend,</v>

618
00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.640
<v Speaker 1>my friend Josh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

619
00:25:46.641 --> 00:25:48.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was the next one to speak.</v>

620
00:25:48.411 --> 00:25:49.880
<v Speaker 1>It was the first time I ever heard</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone say,</v>

621
00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:53.120
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck in a way that I knew they</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't really want him to answer.</v>

622
00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say what the fuck?</v>

623
00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you come home,</v>

624
00:25:58.551 --> 00:26:00.080
<v Speaker 1>there's water everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

625
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.540
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

626
00:26:02.541 --> 00:26:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

627
00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't really want an answer man.</v>

628
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:10.340
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you can have an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certain times when you say,</v>

629
00:26:10.341 --> 00:26:12.800
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where if you were expecting to answer,</v>

630
00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:15.860
<v Speaker 1>you asked the wrong question and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them,</v>

631
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:17.720
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking magazine,</v>

632
00:26:17.721 --> 00:26:20.930
<v Speaker 1>this magazine that we found under a log,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

633
00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:22.340
<v Speaker 1>It's always there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always damp.</v>

634
00:26:22.341 --> 00:26:25.430
<v Speaker 1>The pages are stuck together and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>all dicks and feet.</v>

635
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.220
<v Speaker 1>It was so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all white guys.</v>

636
00:26:28.221 --> 00:26:31.730
<v Speaker 1>You can never find a black dick if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were looking for some black dick back in</v>

637
00:26:31.731 --> 00:26:33.830
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very difficult.</v>

638
00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.160
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see a black Dick until the</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet came along and then I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they really are bigger back then man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know every now and then you'd be</v>

<v Speaker 1>A couple of black guys that said</v>

647
00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:58.380
<v Speaker 1>separates the girls from the women that</v>
<v Speaker 1>separates the pros,</v>

648
00:26:58.381 --> 00:27:01.710
<v Speaker 1>that separates the real slots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real girls who go in there and</v>

649
00:27:01.711 --> 00:27:05.670
<v Speaker 1>there's three fucking giant juiced up</v>
<v Speaker 1>football player,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and they're going to fuck every hole and</v>

651
00:27:09.821 --> 00:27:11.730
<v Speaker 1>you're going to pretend you love it or</v>
<v Speaker 1>do love it.</v>

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>get off at this stop.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just got to be nice to them.</v>

656
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:23.820
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think slots are just like every other</v>

657
00:27:23.821 --> 00:27:26.130
<v Speaker 1>component and the society inevitable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

658
00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:28.560
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and porn stars and Comedians and</v>

659
00:27:28.561 --> 00:27:29.200
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

660
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:34.140
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like this society has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece in place to counteract every other</v>

661
00:27:34.141 --> 00:27:38.010
<v Speaker 1>piece that moves along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this society comes if you're hot</v>

662
00:27:38.011 --> 00:27:39.540
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes with a certain amount of power and</v>

663
00:27:39.541 --> 00:27:40.800
<v Speaker 1>cache.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

664
00:27:40.801 --> 00:27:41.800
<v Speaker 1>salary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

665
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:44.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hate and forget about that.</v>

666
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.320
<v Speaker 1>What about the hate you get from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other women that you know you're,</v>

667
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:50.070
<v Speaker 1>you're not playing by their rules</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the first day.</v>

668
00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:54.530
<v Speaker 1>What it is is they're just tapping into</v>
<v Speaker 1>our base evolutionary that the chimp</v>

669
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.450
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the chimpanzee and you know you.</v>

670
00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just total genetic thing.</v>

671
00:27:57.991 --> 00:28:00.960
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to be around that girl</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know there's a place for</v>

672
00:28:00.961 --> 00:28:01.794
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

673
00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:02.430
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

674
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.980
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often think that it's there the same</v>

675
00:28:04.981 --> 00:28:06.270
<v Speaker 1>rate for the same reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religions,</v>

676
00:28:06.271 --> 00:28:10.140
<v Speaker 1>they're all this controlling behaviors</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we ultimately have this weird</v>

677
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.580
<v Speaker 1>sort of a group goal and the weird group</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal is the progression of technology.</v>

678
00:28:14.581 --> 00:28:17.430
<v Speaker 1>The weird group goal is burger and I say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and people say,</v>

679
00:28:17.431 --> 00:28:17.761
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

680
00:28:17.761 --> 00:28:20.640
<v Speaker 1>it's not just about technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about social engineering.</v>

681
00:28:20.641 --> 00:28:22.980
<v Speaker 1>It's about lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

682
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.930
<v Speaker 1>but what's at the front of the front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the line?</v>

683
00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.700
<v Speaker 1>The front of the line is what's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>latest,</v>

684
00:28:26.701 --> 00:28:29.700
<v Speaker 1>greatest shit we're inventing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much does the culture evolve?</v>

685
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.420
<v Speaker 1>We still have most of the same fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid laws in place that were in place</v>

686
00:28:33.421 --> 00:28:36.060
<v Speaker 1>in the sixties and seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pot is still illegal.</v>

687
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could the culture is still walked out of</v>

688
00:28:38.611 --> 00:28:39.480
<v Speaker 1>their mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

689
00:28:39.481 --> 00:28:44.190
<v Speaker 1>the culture still really fucking weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but technology is in another place.</v>

690
00:28:44.191 --> 00:28:47.250
<v Speaker 1>The evolution of technology is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand times faster.</v>

691
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what it does.</v>

692
00:28:48.121 --> 00:28:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

693
00:28:49.081 --> 00:28:51.870
<v Speaker 1>in porn for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you exactly what you want right</v>

694
00:28:51.871 --> 00:28:56.770
<v Speaker 1>now in every technicolor detailed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was an article I read by this,</v>

695
00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.380
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember her name.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're finding this interesting</v>

698
00:29:03.091 --> 00:29:06.720
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon with teenage boys and that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these kids are now have access to</v>

699
00:29:06.721 --> 00:29:08.970
<v Speaker 1>red tube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're watching porn starting at 10,</v>

700
00:29:08.971 --> 00:29:11.250
<v Speaker 1>nine and they're getting exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want.</v>

701
00:29:11.251 --> 00:29:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you and I,</v>

702
00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:16.110
<v Speaker 1>when you and I saw a naked girl that</v>
<v Speaker 1>right when we met,</v>

703
00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.680
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have the Internet right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you saw and you saw that,</v>

704
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.200
<v Speaker 1>you were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

705
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:24.180
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't worried about life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't worried about shaving.</v>

706
00:29:24.181 --> 00:29:26.520
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the smell of think.</v>

709
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.430

710
00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.400
<v Speaker 1>they're so used to seeing perfection and</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what they want,</v>

711
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.050
<v Speaker 1>that they'll see a girl and they'll be</v>

<v Speaker 1>occasion and become sluttier and</v>

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.940
<v Speaker 1>I get upset and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn did.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Weirdo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

755
00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:12.900
<v Speaker 1>according</v>

756
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.640
<v Speaker 2>to this one book called the murder room</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

757
00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:19.020
<v Speaker 2>that this guy who was a serial killer</v>
<v Speaker 2>profile of specializes in sadism and he,</v>

758
00:31:19.021 --> 00:31:19.720
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

759
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.940
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know about this.</v>

760
00:31:20.941 --> 00:31:23.540
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The society where they,</v>

761
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.700
<v Speaker 2>they get together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like the third Thursday of every</v>

762
00:31:26.701 --> 00:31:28.560
<v Speaker 2>month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these retired profilers and</v>

763
00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:33.150
<v Speaker 2>detectives and they solve cold cases and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rule is it's got to be an ingest</v>

764
00:31:33.151 --> 00:31:34.740
<v Speaker 2>case where a little girl was killed or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

765
00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:37.290
<v Speaker 2>It can't be a drug dealer was knocked</v>
<v Speaker 2>off they find,</v>

766
00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's usually the deal with serial</v>
<v Speaker 2>killers and people got away with it and</v>

767
00:31:40.051 --> 00:31:43.440
<v Speaker 2>they think it's as serial killer and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've solved a lot of crimes and he</v>

768
00:31:43.441 --> 00:31:44.490
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>

769
00:31:44.491 --> 00:31:47.570
<v Speaker 2>he's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He basically wrote the helix on,</v>

770
00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:50.640
<v Speaker 2>on the evolution of a serial killer that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the FBI still uses today.</v>

771
00:31:50.641 --> 00:31:55.641
<v Speaker 2>I'm profiling and he said that almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>all serial killers start with a fetish</v>

772
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:59.940
<v Speaker 2>fetish and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and once you get into the fetish,</v>

773
00:31:59.941 --> 00:32:01.560
<v Speaker 2>once you get into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

774
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.350
<v Speaker 2>whatever it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming on somebody's feet and then you</v>

775
00:32:04.351 --> 00:32:05.790
<v Speaker 2>want to then you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

776
00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:06.870
<v Speaker 2>maybe choke them or whatever.</v>

777
00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.680
<v Speaker 2>You don't go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mentally never go back to being</v>

778
00:32:10.681 --> 00:32:12.930
<v Speaker 2>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you start going down the rabbit</v>

779
00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:14.400
<v Speaker 2>hole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people stopped,</v>

780
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:16.290
<v Speaker 2>some people stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people will stop it,</v>

781
00:32:16.291 --> 00:32:17.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like to stop at whatever it might</v>

782
00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:21.030
<v Speaker 2>be shitting on your fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is extreme fetishes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>for Asians,</v>

784
00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:28.080

<v Speaker 2>against strangers in buses that's</v>

785
00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:31.230

788
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:42.470
<v Speaker 2>like just really cut with a razor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something called peaker rhythm,</v>

789
00:32:42.471 --> 00:32:44.390
<v Speaker 2>which is where they like to cut your</v>
<v Speaker 2>skin.</v>

790
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.390
<v Speaker 2>That shit is a very common thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it's fucking,</v>

791
00:32:47.391 --> 00:32:50.460
<v Speaker 2>so they're cutting you like when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing in an elevator or something,</v>

793
00:32:51.591 --> 00:32:54.290

794
00:32:54.291 --> 00:32:55.220
<v Speaker 2>because it's dangerous.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>mind is not wired,</v>

798
00:33:01.791 --> 00:33:02.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is that.</v>

799
00:33:02.871 --> 00:33:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Is that a social thing?</v>

<v Speaker 2>that if you are an evil person,</v>

802
00:33:09.651 --> 00:33:11.660
<v Speaker 2>let's say you're a serial killer or are</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just a killer?</v>

803
00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:12.890
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

804
00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:16.730
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of evidence to suggest</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you lack the ability not only with</v>

805
00:33:16.731 --> 00:33:19.040
<v Speaker 2>the [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the part of the brain that I</v>

806
00:33:19.041 --> 00:33:19.551
<v Speaker 2>guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

807
00:33:19.551 --> 00:33:23.540
<v Speaker 2>deals with compassion and things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you also may also not have the</v>

808
00:33:23.541 --> 00:33:28.541
<v Speaker 2>neuron synapses required to actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire when somebody is being hurt and it</v>

809
00:33:31.251 --> 00:33:33.860
<v Speaker 2>causes a sense of a distain or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

810
00:33:33.861 --> 00:33:34.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

811
00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.150
<v Speaker 2>or you feel bad about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

812
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:40.610
<v Speaker 2>So as we learn more about the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may just be that criminals,</v>

813
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:44.120
<v Speaker 2>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our brain damaged are simply brain</v>

814
00:33:44.121 --> 00:33:44.840
<v Speaker 2>damage.</v>

815
00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:49.250
<v Speaker 2>So that raises a really important</v>
<v Speaker 2>question if then you can prove that</v>

816
00:33:49.251 --> 00:33:54.251
<v Speaker 2>someone has a lesion the size of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pinhead on a certain part of their brain</v>

817
00:33:54.531 --> 00:33:59.090
<v Speaker 2>that causes them to lack any kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>compassion and in fact caused him not to</v>

818
00:33:59.091 --> 00:34:02.480
<v Speaker 2>be able to feel at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they have to do crazy shit just</v>

819
00:34:02.481 --> 00:34:04.400
<v Speaker 2>to feel just to be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

820
00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.740
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do with that person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that.</v>

821
00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:07.491
<v Speaker 2>What does that say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

822
00:34:07.491 --> 00:34:08.900
<v Speaker 2>you can kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can kill them.</v>

823
00:34:08.901 --> 00:34:12.590
<v Speaker 2>But I'm talking about as a society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you see that they are brain damaged,</v>

824
00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.390
<v Speaker 2>now here's another study them and kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

825
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or how about this?</v>

826
00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:19.130
<v Speaker 2>What if you have the means to actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>fix that lesion on the brain?</v>

827
00:34:19.131 --> 00:34:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Depends on what they've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've already done something fucked</v>

828
00:34:21.951 --> 00:34:22.784
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to kill him.</v>

829
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:25.670
<v Speaker 2>What if I could prove scientifically</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're all hundred percent normal</v>

830
00:34:25.671 --> 00:34:27.880
<v Speaker 2>with all the ability to feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>compassionate?</v>

831
00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:29.220
<v Speaker 2>You still got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still jealous,</v>

832
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:30.063
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To kill him.</v>

833
00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:33.080
<v Speaker 2>You can't have them walking around with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy killed your sister.</v>

834
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:35.560
<v Speaker 2>Do you imagine if you were walking</v>
<v Speaker 2>around and some guy killed your sister</v>

835
00:34:35.561 --> 00:34:36.051
<v Speaker 2>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

836
00:34:36.051 --> 00:34:38.120
<v Speaker 2>sorry you just said some shit wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brain,</v>

837
00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:40.190
<v Speaker 2>but it does raise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does raise questions.</v>

838
00:34:40.191 --> 00:34:43.400
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be grappling with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another thing about technology as we</v>

839
00:34:43.401 --> 00:34:46.580
<v Speaker 2>learn more about the brain and you find</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of criminals have an</v>

840
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:47.760
<v Speaker 2>underdeveloped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

841
00:34:47.761 --> 00:34:49.130
<v Speaker 2>meticulous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the word.</v>

842
00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:50.590
<v Speaker 2>Is that what the part of the bedroom?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

843
00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:53.330
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but medically because it's make up</v>

844
00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.400
<v Speaker 2>another word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sounds.</v>

845
00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Look it up on the Internet like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>regular.</v>

846
00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.720
<v Speaker 2>But the point is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking interesting to me.</v>

847
00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:07.580
<v Speaker 2>What was your actual brain damaged?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't have the ability to feel.</v>

848
00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.730
<v Speaker 2>You don't even fucking know how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>process that and you haven't since you</v>

849
00:35:10.731 --> 00:35:14.210
<v Speaker 2>were born isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But where does that come from?</v>

850
00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.510
<v Speaker 2>Because a huge percentage of the serial</v>
<v Speaker 2>killers that seemed to come from some</v>

851
00:35:17.511 --> 00:35:19.320
<v Speaker 2>sort of a torture is childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

852
00:35:19.321 --> 00:35:24.110
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But is that some don't bullshit.</v>

853
00:35:24.111 --> 00:35:27.680
<v Speaker 2>Maybe because Jeffrey Dahmer's parents</v>
<v Speaker 2>claimed that they didn't fuck him,</v>

854
00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:29.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is fine.</v>

855
00:35:29.391 --> 00:35:31.760
<v Speaker 2>He's pretty normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Yo Yo,</v>

856
00:35:31.761 --> 00:35:33.070
<v Speaker 2>something happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no,</v>

857
00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no question though,</v>

858
00:35:35.061 --> 00:35:38.970
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of very evil people let's</v>
<v Speaker 2>take stolen and not actually not a good</v>

859
00:35:38.971 --> 00:35:39.321
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

860
00:35:39.321 --> 00:35:40.530
<v Speaker 2>let's take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of like,</v>

861
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.960
<v Speaker 2>like shitty the really terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>dictators,</v>

862
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:44.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But isn't it a part of the real problem</v>

863
00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:48.330
<v Speaker 2>is finding the God who the fuck knows</v>
<v Speaker 2>when?</v>

864
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.840
<v Speaker 2>I think that you're definitely wounded</v>
<v Speaker 2>some time in your,</v>

865
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:55.560
<v Speaker 2>in a crucial stage of development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably that seems to be at another</v>

866
00:35:55.561 --> 00:35:58.020
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard where people say as you're</v>

867
00:35:58.021 --> 00:36:00.600
<v Speaker 2>developing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times if you're developing</v>

868
00:36:00.601 --> 00:36:04.410
<v Speaker 2>sexually and mentally at a certain age</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you see something really horrific</v>

869
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.510
<v Speaker 2>and violent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will,</v>

870
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.950
<v Speaker 2>you can associate violence with sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

871
00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.270
<v Speaker 2>release.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all kinds of shit like that.</v>

872
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:15.450
<v Speaker 2>Or as a way of coping with something you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't even put into context,</v>

873
00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.150
<v Speaker 2>you'd turn it sexual because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>defensive mechanism.</v>

874
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:21.270
<v Speaker 2>A lot of girls that have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except that a lot of girls who've been</v>

875
00:36:21.271 --> 00:36:23.100
<v Speaker 2>molested and raped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they turn to porn.</v>

876
00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:24.090
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they.</v>

877
00:36:24.091 --> 00:36:27.390
<v Speaker 2>We live the trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it reliving it strange.</v>

878
00:36:27.391 --> 00:36:28.770
<v Speaker 2>You would think that it would turn them</v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

879
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:31.020
<v Speaker 2>Some people it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what the.</v>

880
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:33.270
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mystery is that you see people who</v>

881
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:37.380
<v Speaker 2>go through the worst abuse in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they come out of it incredible</v>

882
00:36:37.381 --> 00:36:41.400
<v Speaker 2>people who give back to society and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there everybody's hero and then you see</v>

883
00:36:41.401 --> 00:36:41.850
<v Speaker 2>somebody wear.</v>

884
00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:45.330
<v Speaker 2>One thing happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing happens at the right time and</v>

885
00:36:45.331 --> 00:36:46.210
<v Speaker 2>they turn into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're there.</v>

886
00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:48.270
<v Speaker 2>They're in and out of Rehab for the rest</v>
<v Speaker 2>of their life.</v>

887
00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:50.280
<v Speaker 2>Look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at people who make a shitload of</v>

888
00:36:50.281 --> 00:36:52.650
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of their kids good looking tall to</v>

889
00:36:52.651 --> 00:36:55.920
<v Speaker 2>doing all the thing and they spend their</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole life battling a drug drug problem.</v>

890
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.040
<v Speaker 2>Whereas one dude comes up from in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>orphanage and ends up running the</v>

891
00:36:59.041 --> 00:37:01.320
<v Speaker 2>fucking running a company or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it might be,</v>

892
00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:04.860
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's all really kind of clear.</v>

893
00:37:04.861 --> 00:37:07.590
<v Speaker 2>If you look at it like in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>progression of their lives and what kind</v>

894
00:37:07.591 --> 00:37:10.210
<v Speaker 2>of experiences have they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they move towards,</v>

895
00:37:10.211 --> 00:37:12.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>solving or getting past that experience</v>

896
00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.310
<v Speaker 2>and what can you learn from watching</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

897
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you really wanted to really wanted to</v>

898
00:37:16.921 --> 00:37:20.310
<v Speaker 2>take the crazy point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crazy point of view is that this</v>

899
00:37:20.311 --> 00:37:23.730
<v Speaker 2>world is really your imagination and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everything that takes place in this</v>

900
00:37:23.731 --> 00:37:25.130
<v Speaker 2>world is really a lesson for you.</v>

901
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:27.900
<v Speaker 2>You can either learn from it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see the whole thing is some</v>

902
00:37:27.901 --> 00:37:32.580
<v Speaker 2>grand play played out for your amusement</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in every weakness you can,</v>

903
00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:33.720
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can learn.</v>

904
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:37.500
<v Speaker 2>And one of the issues that I have with</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings and like I said with</v>

905
00:37:37.501 --> 00:37:38.081
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

906
00:37:38.081 --> 00:37:41.370
<v Speaker 2>I get upset at things that I'm afraid of</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing in myself.</v>

907
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get upset at weakness in people.</v>

908
00:37:43.941 --> 00:37:45.780
<v Speaker 2>I get upset at jealousy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get upset,</v>

909
00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.450
<v Speaker 2>I get upset at all the things that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrified of seeing in myself.</v>

910
00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:51.540
<v Speaker 2>And it's almost like that that plays out</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>

911
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.280
<v Speaker 2>It's like these are all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's your school.</v>

912
00:37:53.281 --> 00:37:54.320
<v Speaker 2>The world is your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your.</v>

913
00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.450
<v Speaker 2>This is your path to enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the world in front of you.</v>

914
00:37:57.451 --> 00:38:00.300
<v Speaker 2>This is a shaky roadmap of</v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment.</v>

915
00:38:00.301 --> 00:38:02.370
<v Speaker 2>You said something that that always</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck with me.</v>

916
00:38:02.371 --> 00:38:05.120
<v Speaker 2>I never forgot it and I wasn't that</v>
<v Speaker 2>young guy when you said it.</v>

917
00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:09.840
<v Speaker 2>It was actually kind of recent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was about five years ago and there</v>

918
00:38:09.841 --> 00:38:14.610
<v Speaker 2>was this situation that I'd been at</v>
<v Speaker 2>dinner and I fucking freaked out and my</v>

919
00:38:14.611 --> 00:38:17.190
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend time and you said to me the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next day you go,</v>

920
00:38:17.191 --> 00:38:19.860
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to become the star of the movie</v>

921
00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:21.890
<v Speaker 2>that you live in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't be.</v>

922
00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.550
<v Speaker 2>You can't behave that way because that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not what the star of the movie would do.</v>

923
00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:28.140
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

924
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:31.470
<v Speaker 2>You make a choice as to how you behave</v>
<v Speaker 2>and who you want to be,</v>

925
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:35.040
<v Speaker 2>and that is a series of choices that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can choose to be someone that you would</v>

926
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 2>admire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

927
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.220
<v Speaker 1>exactly fucking right and that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to do.</v>

928
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:42.040
<v Speaker 1>It takes responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes saying no to a lot of shit,</v>

929
00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:43.570
<v Speaker 1>but it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also.</v>

930
00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.100
<v Speaker 1>It is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a way it's also,</v>

931
00:38:45.101 --> 00:38:49.000
<v Speaker 1>it is easier in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make your fucking choice and I think you</v>

932
00:38:49.001 --> 00:38:51.520
<v Speaker 1>also know exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always find people who act like</v>

933
00:38:51.521 --> 00:38:54.100
<v Speaker 1>they're really confused and they'll ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>me advice about how to live their life</v>

934
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:55.810
<v Speaker 1>and I started looking at him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

935
00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.490
<v Speaker 1>you know exactly what you're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

936
00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.301
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

937
00:38:58.301 --> 00:39:00.850
<v Speaker 1>it is very confusing if you haven't made</v>
<v Speaker 1>steps already,</v>

938
00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:02.410
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're one of those purposes,</v>

939
00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:05.770
<v Speaker 1>people that have never ventured into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep water and you're free to jump in,</v>

940
00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:08.260
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big for a lot of people,</v>

941
00:39:08.261 --> 00:39:09.640
<v Speaker 1>any sort of changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying,</v>

942
00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.200
<v Speaker 1>any movement and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

943
00:39:11.201 --> 00:39:13.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about leaving this job and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing my dreams.</v>

944
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:16.390
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking terrifying for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying because a lot of times it</v>

945
00:39:16.391 --> 00:39:17.470
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>

946
00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:19.540
<v Speaker 1>but they haven't done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've done it a bunch of times,</v>

947
00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:19.871
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

948
00:39:19.871 --> 00:39:22.480
<v Speaker 1>I already did this already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did that already tried move on here.</v>

949
00:39:22.481 --> 00:39:26.710
<v Speaker 1>And sports sports make a band up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was listening to mark Marin,</v>

950
00:39:26.711 --> 00:39:28.180
<v Speaker 1>I think he was talking to Greg</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fitzsimmons.</v>

951
00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Somebody sent me this clip we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>married,</v>

952
00:39:30.671 --> 00:39:33.910
<v Speaker 1>was talking about how if he was upset</v>
<v Speaker 1>with anything was that his parents never</v>

953
00:39:33.911 --> 00:39:36.490
<v Speaker 1>instilled a sense of healthy competition</v>
<v Speaker 1>in him.</v>

954
00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:39.100
<v Speaker 1>For him it was always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's losing the game,</v>

955
00:39:39.101 --> 00:39:42.010
<v Speaker 1>he's throwing the board up in the air</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the fucking games over because</v>

956
00:39:42.011 --> 00:39:45.400
<v Speaker 1>he left because he couldn't take it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was like life or death and</v>

957
00:39:45.401 --> 00:39:49.560
<v Speaker 1>that's such an important point man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a healthy form of competition and by</v>

958
00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:51.490
<v Speaker 1>healthy one of the things is you got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose.</v>

959
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:53.680
<v Speaker 1>I was about to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to feel that you learn a lot</v>

960
00:39:53.681 --> 00:39:55.330
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times by losing.</v>

961
00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:58.450
<v Speaker 1>You learn what you're doing wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get motivated.</v>

962
00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

963
00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:03.340
<v Speaker 1>I still to this day do a lot of Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things about Jujitsu is</v>

964
00:40:03.341 --> 00:40:04.270
<v Speaker 1>you get tapped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

965
00:40:04.271 --> 00:40:07.390
<v Speaker 1>you get tapped all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I roll with good guys so I get caught,</v>

966
00:40:07.391 --> 00:40:08.150
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>

967
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:11.290
<v Speaker 1>And when you're getting caught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a matter of do I tap out or does my</v>

968
00:40:11.291 --> 00:40:14.020
<v Speaker 1>arm break?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I tap out or are you going to fuck my</v>

969
00:40:14.021 --> 00:40:15.070
<v Speaker 1>neck up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

970
00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:18.340
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by doing that all the time,</v>

971
00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:23.260
<v Speaker 1>you get very humble and you get used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>losing and winning and you realize that</v>

972
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:24.440
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

973
00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:25.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good that you do,</v>

974
00:40:25.901 --> 00:40:28.030
<v Speaker 1>whether you're good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do good at Jujitsu or any other game.</v>

975
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:30.280
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why I'm obsessed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>games because there's a direct</v>

976
00:40:30.281 --> 00:40:33.310
<v Speaker 1>correlation in my mind between focusing</v>
<v Speaker 1>excellence,</v>

977
00:40:33.311 --> 00:40:36.610
<v Speaker 1>like focusing my energy and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration on something and then</v>

978
00:40:36.611 --> 00:40:40.510
<v Speaker 1>seeing direct results and then applying</v>
<v Speaker 1>those direct results to the rest of my</v>

979
00:40:40.511 --> 00:40:44.290
<v Speaker 1>life and with some people they never</v>
<v Speaker 1>have any real competition in their life.</v>

980
00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:46.690
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when anything comes up,</v>

981
00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:49.300
<v Speaker 1>anything that's big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that does require you to rise</v>

982
00:40:49.301 --> 00:40:51.580
<v Speaker 1>to the occasion or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or deal with a social issue,</v>

983
00:40:51.581 --> 00:40:52.840
<v Speaker 1>you fucking lock up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

984
00:40:52.841 --> 00:40:54.220
<v Speaker 1>He's out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You freeze up because it's scary.</v>

985
00:40:54.221 --> 00:40:54.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

986
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:56.260
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Michael Jordan,</v>

987
00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.890
<v Speaker 1>they always say he had his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hills.</v>

988
00:40:58.891 --> 00:41:02.500
<v Speaker 1>These statistic for hitting the most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>last minute winning shots.</v>

989
00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>

990
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.490
<v Speaker 1>He also holds this statistic for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most losing,</v>

991
00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.440
<v Speaker 1>missing the most game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>winning shots.</v>

992
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.080
<v Speaker 1>He's also a notorious gambling addicts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

993
00:41:11.081 --> 00:41:13.780
<v Speaker 1>but that's in a book that's in a book</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the outliers and I thought was</v>

994
00:41:13.781 --> 00:41:14.614
<v Speaker 1>really interesting.</v>

995
00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Take some chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

996
00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.760
<v Speaker 1>He missed this many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He missed more than he made.</v>

997
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Now he's a legend and he was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest basketball player ever,</v>

998
00:41:21.821 --> 00:41:24.490
<v Speaker 1>but that took a lot of fucking missing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of losing.</v>

999
00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.150
<v Speaker 1>It took a lot of obsession to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

1000
00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:28.930
<v Speaker 1>He's a fascinating subject to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I followed him very closely.</v>

1001
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very closely because I'm obsessed with</v>

1002
00:41:31.721 --> 00:41:34.880
<v Speaker 1>extreme winters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm because I think there's a madness to</v>

1003
00:41:34.881 --> 00:41:38.570
<v Speaker 1>it and I truly believe that in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be truly great at something,</v>

1004
00:41:38.571 --> 00:41:42.020
<v Speaker 1>you have to give into a certain amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of madness and how much can you manage</v>

1005
00:41:42.021 --> 00:41:43.070
<v Speaker 1>that madness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1006
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:45.290
<v Speaker 1>but guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be that guy flying</v>

1007
00:41:45.291 --> 00:41:47.870
<v Speaker 1>through the fucking air with your tongue</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in front of the baddest</v>

1008
00:41:47.871 --> 00:41:50.870
<v Speaker 1>motherfucking basketball players in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and kicking shit on the level that</v>

1009
00:41:50.871 --> 00:41:51.950
<v Speaker 1>they've never seen before.</v>

1010
00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:53.540
<v Speaker 1>Dr Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suck my Dick.</v>

1011
00:41:53.541 --> 00:41:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch this.</v>

1012
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fly through the air.</v>

1013
00:41:57.261 --> 00:41:59.390
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about I'm going to do some shit that</v>

1014
00:41:59.391 --> 00:42:01.610
<v Speaker 1>nobody's ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hit some fucking layups</v>

1015
00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.970
<v Speaker 1>that's going to have all you white</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitches scratching your head already.</v>

1016
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Line used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Michael Jordan had been on the</v>

1017
00:42:05.961 --> 00:42:07.560
<v Speaker 1>titanic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would not have sung.</v>

1018
00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:11.890
<v Speaker 1>It would have been fucking fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every.</v>

1019
00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am fascinated by ultra bad</v>

1020
00:42:14.001 --> 00:42:16.040
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a reality to the.</v>

1021
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:18.620
<v Speaker 1>There's a madness to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To all of them,</v>

1022
00:42:18.621 --> 00:42:21.380
<v Speaker 1>every single one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Michael Jordan is a extreme one last</v>

1023
00:42:21.381 --> 00:42:23.300
<v Speaker 1>at pool wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't talk to his teammate for three</v>

1024
00:42:23.301 --> 00:42:24.134
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1025
00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.800
<v Speaker 1>I believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe he's also got a real real</v>

1026
00:42:27.801 --> 00:42:31.580
<v Speaker 1>problem with gambling and any sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>games and I know that that thing in</v>

1027
00:42:31.581 --> 00:42:33.980
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was younger I had a real problem</v>

1028
00:42:33.981 --> 00:42:34.180
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

1029
00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much better now,</v>

1030
00:42:35.211 --> 00:42:39.470
<v Speaker 1>but when I was younger I had a real</v>

1176
00:48:29.561 --> 00:48:33.280
<v Speaker 2>wonderful people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Bangkok and Tom's been Bangkok just</v>

1177
00:48:33.281 --> 00:48:37.390
<v Speaker 2>by the nature of the city and there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It smells like garlic soup.</v>

1178
00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:41.490
<v Speaker 2>It smells like I was on the top of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>hotel and I was like that.</v>

1179
00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:43.340
<v Speaker 2>It does well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bangkok smells a lot,</v>

1180
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:46.870
<v Speaker 2>a lot like fish and garlic and soup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you mix that together,</v>

1181
00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.840
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not far right.</v>

1182
00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:53.350
<v Speaker 2>They're great people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ties are fucking awesome.</v>

1183
00:48:53.351 --> 00:48:55.750
<v Speaker 2>How long were you there for the only</v>
<v Speaker 2>country never been colonized,</v>

1184
00:48:55.751 --> 00:48:56.960
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At oil?</v>

1185
00:48:57.010 --> 00:48:59.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thailand is the only country where you</v>

1186
00:48:59.111 --> 00:49:01.590
<v Speaker 2>could make the argument for Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they'd gone through so many wars</v>

1187
00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:03.310
<v Speaker 2>fighting for their independence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their bad has people,</v>

1188
00:49:03.311 --> 00:49:08.311
<v Speaker 2>but the ties somehow we're always able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to compromise and find a way to be just</v>

1189
00:49:08.981 --> 00:49:09.340
<v Speaker 2>in the middle.</v>

1190
00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:13.150
<v Speaker 2>Think about Indochina in that area and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how fucking incredibly volatile that</v>

1191
00:49:13.151 --> 00:49:15.790
<v Speaker 2>always been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Chinese were always invading</v>

1192
00:49:15.791 --> 00:49:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were already knew.</v>

1193
00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:19.510
<v Speaker 2>That whole part was just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Light was always hard.</v>

1194
00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Vietnamese are tough fucking people</v>
<v Speaker 2>because their history has been a</v>

1195
00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:24.970
<v Speaker 2>thousand years of keeping people out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their fucking country.</v>

1196
00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:26.470
<v Speaker 2>The French,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Chinese,</v>

1197
00:49:26.471 --> 00:49:27.940
<v Speaker 2>the Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just never gave up.</v>

1198
00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:32.950
<v Speaker 2>When you look at fucking ties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow somehow they were able to just</v>

1199
00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:36.550
<v Speaker 2>keep everything real kosher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just played the road.</v>

1200
00:49:36.551 --> 00:49:37.091
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1201
00:49:37.091 --> 00:49:39.580
<v Speaker 2>America will your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not really good friends.</v>

1202
00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:42.240
<v Speaker 2>Hey Roger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys want to fuck our girl?</v>

1203
00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:45.430
<v Speaker 2>We got great food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful women.</v>

1204
00:49:45.431 --> 00:49:47.910
<v Speaker 2>The weather's great commodity to wild</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

1205
00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:53.020
<v Speaker 2>Thai fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their fights in Thailand really are like</v>

1206
00:49:53.021 --> 00:49:57.850
<v Speaker 2>those old van Damme movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're waving cash in the area in</v>

1207
00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.010
<v Speaker 2>gambling tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're no joke,</v>

1208
00:50:00.011 --> 00:50:02.830
<v Speaker 2>but they're just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really good at being communal</v>

1209
00:50:02.831 --> 00:50:03.440
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1210
00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:05.920
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think at the root of Thai culture is</v>

1211
00:50:05.921 --> 00:50:09.430
<v Speaker 2>this notion of being able to compromise</v>
<v Speaker 2>and negotiate and not,</v>

1212
00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:12.970
<v Speaker 2>not spoiling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not taking the fucking chessboard thrown</v>

1213
00:50:12.971 --> 00:50:14.560
<v Speaker 2>in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just let's just,</v>

1214
00:50:14.561 --> 00:50:16.330
<v Speaker 2>let's keep playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost a little bit,</v>

1215
00:50:16.331 --> 00:50:19.280
<v Speaker 2>but it's not just a battle in the war</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself is a,</v>

1216
00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:22.480
<v Speaker 2>there is no or it's a beautiful way of</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at life.</v>

1217
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:25.750
<v Speaker 2>They're not too competitive about shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a king still right and you</v>

1218
00:50:25.751 --> 00:50:26.990
<v Speaker 2>can't shit on the king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1219
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.820
<v Speaker 2>Thailand is an incredibly liberal place</v>
<v Speaker 2>for and,</v>

1220
00:50:30.821 --> 00:50:32.640
<v Speaker 2>and I did a little reading on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture and seven,</v>

1221
00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:33.770
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very liberal place.</v>

1222
00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:37.910
<v Speaker 2>But the one thing that they never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have no sense of humor about as</v>

1223
00:50:37.911 --> 00:50:40.490
<v Speaker 2>their king nailing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason is because there's a,</v>

1224
00:50:40.491 --> 00:50:42.200
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a form of superstition.</v>

1225
00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:45.000
<v Speaker 2>It's what a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1226
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:46.520
<v Speaker 2>they're very superstitious about their</v>
<v Speaker 2>king.</v>

1227
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:50.420
<v Speaker 2>There king is considered to be a semi</v>
<v Speaker 2>deity and they take that shit seriously</v>

1228
00:50:50.421 --> 00:50:52.100
<v Speaker 2>and I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1229
00:50:52.101 --> 00:50:54.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the holiday was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a time when you were supposed</v>

1230
00:50:54.561 --> 00:50:59.561
<v Speaker 2>to give alms to the king and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was a religious ceremony and they</v>

1231
00:50:59.931 --> 00:51:01.970
<v Speaker 2>would walk by and all of them would put</v>
<v Speaker 2>their hands together.</v>

1232
00:51:01.971 --> 00:51:05.120
<v Speaker 2>Even people on the street would walk by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Golden Shrine and put their hands</v>

1233
00:51:05.121 --> 00:51:07.560
<v Speaker 2>together and bow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it might be one of the last cultures</v>

1234
00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:10.850
<v Speaker 2>on earth and that feels that way about</v>
<v Speaker 2>their king.</v>

1235
00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:11.841
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1236
00:51:11.841 --> 00:51:14.540
<v Speaker 2>like North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>North Korea is under a dictatorship is</v>

1237
00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:17.140
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Tibetans have this notion that the,</v>

1238
00:51:17.141 --> 00:51:21.830
<v Speaker 2>that the Dalai Lama is the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's a religious thing,</v>

1239
00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.610
<v Speaker 2>but this is also a little bit as well I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think so very much do.</v>

1240
00:51:25.611 --> 00:51:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does the King Do Shady Shit?</v>

1241
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:30.260
<v Speaker 2>No other king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From what I understand,</v>

1242
00:51:30.261 --> 00:51:33.320
<v Speaker 2>his son is a little bit different than</v>
<v Speaker 2>sun is falling a little bit out of favor</v>

1243
00:51:33.321 --> 00:51:36.350
<v Speaker 2>with the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a playboy and a product of just,</v>

1244
00:51:36.351 --> 00:51:37.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how shit,</v>

1245
00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:39.650
<v Speaker 2>but his dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his dad is.</v>

1246
00:51:39.651 --> 00:51:40.670
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

1247
00:51:40.671 --> 00:51:43.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean son was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't hear bad things about his son,</v>

1248
00:51:43.431 --> 00:51:48.431
<v Speaker 2>but his father was always this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>sober stayed presence is just having a</v>

1249
00:51:48.501 --> 00:51:50.120
<v Speaker 2>good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really,</v>

1250
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:51.110
<v Speaker 2>he took it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1251
00:51:51.111 --> 00:51:52.100
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even that kid,</v>

1252
00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:54.950
<v Speaker 2>they take their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their role as a symbol very,</v>

1253
00:51:54.951 --> 00:51:58.530
<v Speaker 2>very seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they know how important and how,</v>

1254
00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how important assemble they are.</v>

1255

1257
00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.330
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the notion that we are,</v>

1258
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.370
<v Speaker 2>we are what you should aspire to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1259
00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:10.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being conservative like a lot of things</v>

1260
00:52:10.101 --> 00:52:12.500
<v Speaker 2>about the Thai women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people think well because there are</v>

1261
00:52:12.501 --> 00:52:14.630
<v Speaker 2>a lot of like strip clubs and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>big sex trade.</v>

1262
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:15.980
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Thai women are losing.</v>

1263
00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1264
00:52:18.081 --> 00:52:19.970
<v Speaker 2>in Thai culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women aren't,</v>

1265
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:20.560
<v Speaker 2>they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

1266
00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:23.090
<v Speaker 2>it's not like you just go fuck a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people at all.</v>

1267
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:25.760
<v Speaker 2>They're very conservative in their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>families.</v>

1268
00:52:25.761 --> 00:52:26.411
<v Speaker 2>And as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

1269
00:52:26.411 --> 00:52:28.580
<v Speaker 2>as a group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to a lot of Thai people</v>

1270
00:52:28.581 --> 00:52:30.980
<v Speaker 2>about that and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and women who were there who were</v>

1271
00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:32.060
<v Speaker 2>working in some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was like,</v>

1272
00:52:32.061 --> 00:52:34.420
<v Speaker 2>it's a huge misconception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the notion that you can just meet a Thai</v>

1273
00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:35.840
<v Speaker 2>girl and get been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't been banked.</v>

1274
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:40.140
<v Speaker 2>So it's just the prostitutes are just so</v>
<v Speaker 2>prevalent because they make it legal,</v>

1275
00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:43.100
<v Speaker 2>don't try to control it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They and they zone it.</v>

1276
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.240
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a red light district where I</v>

1277
00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:47.850
<v Speaker 2>spent all my time and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1278
00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:51.170
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have numbers and it's,</v>

1279
00:52:51.171 --> 00:52:53.720
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get it for $19.</v>

1280
00:52:53.721 --> 00:52:55.250
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can pay the bar,</v>

1281
00:52:55.251 --> 00:52:56.810
<v Speaker 2>find wherever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 bucks,</v>

1282
00:52:56.811 --> 00:52:58.640
<v Speaker 2>you can bring them back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all very cheap.</v>

1283
00:52:58.641 --> 00:53:03.641
<v Speaker 2>But you see these disgusting fat</v>
<v Speaker 2>barnacle written German tourists who are</v>

1284
00:53:04.401 --> 00:53:06.880
<v Speaker 2>60 with this like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1285
00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:11.120
<v Speaker 2>15 year old farm girl from the north of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thailand or Cambodia or good.</v>

1286
00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:13.570
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not a,</v>

1287
00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:15.650
<v Speaker 2>it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sinful thing.</v>

1288
00:53:15.651 --> 00:53:18.200
<v Speaker 2>And their culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's almost like I'm,</v>

1289
00:53:18.201 --> 00:53:20.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna help this person.</v>

1290
00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I'm going to give them a</v>

1291
00:53:21.711 --> 00:53:24.290
<v Speaker 2>massage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so either way,</v>

1292
00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 2>I think a huge strength of the</v>

1293
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Thai people also is the notion that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of power and strength in</v>

1294
00:53:29.191 --> 00:53:32.550
<v Speaker 1>given there's a lot of power and</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength and being subservient and</v>

1295
00:53:32.551 --> 00:53:34.860
<v Speaker 1>making you feel welcome and have a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1296
00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking moving to Thailand.</v>

1297
00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:40.560
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was an old single dude who just</v>

1298
00:53:40.561 --> 00:53:43.050
<v Speaker 1>liked to watch kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking move to Thailand if I didn't</v>

1299
00:53:43.051 --> 00:53:45.720
<v Speaker 1>have any friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard the air quality is so bad.</v>

1300
00:53:45.721 --> 00:53:49.830
<v Speaker 1>They can't walk around with a mask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't have to live in Bangkok.</v>

1301
00:53:49.831 --> 00:53:52.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live in Bali is paquette.</v>

1302
00:53:52.681 --> 00:53:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I thought about going their vacation,</v>

<v Speaker 1>how cool would it be to go on vacation?</v>

1306

1307
00:54:03.691 --> 00:54:06.230
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it safe for tourists and everything?</v>

1308
00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:07.800
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing about even</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bangkok,</v>

1309
00:54:07.801 --> 00:54:09.720
<v Speaker 1>incredibly safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even Bangkok,</v>

1310

<v Speaker 1>Bangkok,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1311
00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:11.790

<v Speaker 1>it's a huge city.</v>

1312
00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:14.610
<v Speaker 1>I never once heard anybody telling me</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't walk around.</v>

1313
00:54:14.611 --> 00:54:16.470
<v Speaker 1>I walked around everywhere you go</v>

1326
00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:58.020

<v Speaker 1>You were filming the hangover two.</v>

1327
00:54:58.021 --> 00:55:00.570
<v Speaker 1>And for how long were you there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there for almost two weeks.</v>

1328
00:55:00.571 --> 00:55:05.571
<v Speaker 1>I stayed at the four seasons sun suite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a player when you do it by</v>

1329
00:55:06.181 --> 00:55:07.850
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't fly family now.</v>

1330
00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:09.240
<v Speaker 1>I was just by myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two weeks.</v>

1331
00:55:09.241 --> 00:55:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a long time to freak out now when</v>

1332
00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:13.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1333
00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:16.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't really like traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did so much of it as a kid that I</v>

1334
00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:17.130
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1335
00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:18.930
<v Speaker 1>I've had an opportunity to go to South</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>

1336
00:55:18.931 --> 00:55:23.220
<v Speaker 1>And when you lived in the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something I wanted to talk to</v>

1337
00:55:23.221 --> 00:55:27.270
<v Speaker 1>you about because I wanted to know if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember the place that you were</v>

1338
00:55:27.271 --> 00:55:29.990
<v Speaker 1>when you heard the news that the prince</v>
<v Speaker 1>was with</v>

1339
00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Prince Prince was what?</v>

1340
00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:37.320
<v Speaker 1>I just said that because that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the highlight of my life and I</v>

1341
00:55:37.321 --> 00:55:38.520
<v Speaker 1>was sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>

1342
00:55:38.521 --> 00:55:39.161
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1343
00:55:39.161 --> 00:55:40.980
<v Speaker 1>this woman said to me two in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>

1344
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:44.370
<v Speaker 1>this woman said to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you didn't leave and watch.</v>

1345
00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.680
<v Speaker 1>You didn't even watch the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like I go,</v>

1346
00:55:46.681 --> 00:55:47.190
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

1347
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:48.990
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want some straight.</v>

1348
00:55:48.991 --> 00:55:51.630
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said this woman actually it was.</v>

1349
00:55:51.631 --> 00:55:53.460
<v Speaker 1>My mom was trying to figure out who said</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to me.</v>

1350
00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Because you ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never know how someone says</v>

1351
00:55:55.711 --> 00:55:56.251
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to go.</v>

1352
00:55:56.251 --> 00:55:57.330
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck said that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it was like,</v>

1353
00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:59.160
<v Speaker 1>in my mind I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this older woman.</v>

1354
00:55:59.161 --> 00:56:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Why am I talking to her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's had a store.</v>

1355
00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:01.553
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's my mom.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1358
00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:05.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was a prince that was a good</v>

1359
00:56:05.881 --> 00:56:08.060
<v Speaker 1>looking guy like he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't begin logging married.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's got to do what he's got to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the street from us.</v>

1371
00:56:25.811 --> 00:56:29.350
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about her dress and</v>
<v Speaker 1>her shoes and they all got excited.</v>

1372
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:32.230
<v Speaker 1>They had like 50 people over their house</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching the wedding on TV.</v>

1373
00:56:32.231 --> 00:56:35.630
<v Speaker 1>They got up early because it's alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1374
00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:40.720
<v Speaker 1>it's different times so crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 10 hours ahead of us or something,</v>

1375
00:56:40.901 --> 00:56:44.260
<v Speaker 1>at least eight hours ahead of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd been following all this Osama shit.</v>

1376
00:56:44.261 --> 00:56:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1377
00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:46.220
<v Speaker 1>that's as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He grew weed on his,</v>

1378
00:56:46.221 --> 00:56:49.390
<v Speaker 1>on his arm and he did grow weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's super common in the Middle</v>

1379
00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:49.420
<v Speaker 1>East.</v>

1380
00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the video that they released</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday?</v>

1381
00:56:52.301 --> 00:56:55.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that they released all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>like home videos that they found at that</v>

1382
00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.020
<v Speaker 1>compound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're suspect because you know,</v>

1383
00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.860
<v Speaker 1>the CIA's admitted that they were going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make fake news stories.</v>

1384
00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is this fake at all.</v>

1385
00:57:01.770 --> 00:57:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a second.</v>

1386
00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:07.360
<v Speaker 1>You see the CIA has admitted in several</v>
<v Speaker 1>times that they were going to make fake</v>

1387
00:57:07.361 --> 00:57:09.460
<v Speaker 1>news stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was after nine slash 11 and they</v>

1388
00:57:09.461 --> 00:57:11.710
<v Speaker 1>said to throw off the terrorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were going to make fake news</v>

1389
00:57:11.711 --> 00:57:13.970
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as they start saying that,</v>

1390
00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:15.970
<v Speaker 1>letting everybody know we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lie to you,</v>

1391
00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:19.240
<v Speaker 1>that the depths of their lives is only</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your imagination.</v>

1392
00:57:19.241 --> 00:57:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when when you see him and he's</v>

1393
00:57:21.881 --> 00:57:25.990
<v Speaker 1>got like his beard is dyed black and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you see other videos of him and his</v>

1394
00:57:25.991 --> 00:57:26.824
<v Speaker 1>beard is white.</v>

1395
00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:28.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on this.</v>

1396
00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:33.130
<v Speaker 1>This is why I don't buy that is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're right now will absolutely be an</v>

1397
00:57:33.131 --> 00:57:35.980
<v Speaker 1>active campaign to discredit him if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have murdered him.</v>

1398
00:57:35.981 --> 00:57:38.530
<v Speaker 1>If they did shoot Osama bin Ladin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any was unarmed,</v>

1399
00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.410
<v Speaker 1>they will discredit him and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways they're going to discredit him to</v>

1400
00:57:41.411 --> 00:57:43.330
<v Speaker 1>make him look vein and to make him look</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's a,</v>

1401
00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:45.510
<v Speaker 1>a crazy dictator who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1402
00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:47.560
<v Speaker 1>living in squalor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's an insane person.</v>

1403
00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:51.490
<v Speaker 1>So if you show pictures of his house and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his house was all fucked up in disarray</v>

1404
00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:54.670
<v Speaker 1>and there's blood all over the place and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just garbage everywhere and then</v>

1405
00:57:54.671 --> 00:57:56.710
<v Speaker 1>you saw pictures of his beard and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>

1406
00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:59.920
<v Speaker 1>He looks like a nutty man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the video of him and they're</v>

1407
00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:02.120
<v Speaker 1>just watching TV though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know that</v>

1408
00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:07.150
<v Speaker 1>he's got a white beard and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it talks about conspiracy and the</v>

1409
00:58:07.151 --> 00:58:08.500
<v Speaker 1>idea that this might be a fake story.</v>

1410
00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:12.370
<v Speaker 1>They did take a look at how the US</v>
<v Speaker 1>government works.</v>

1411
00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1412
00:58:13.841 --> 00:58:16.330
<v Speaker 1>how these operations work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something.</v>

1413
00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:19.330
<v Speaker 1>When you do a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you do a major operation like that,</v>

1414
00:58:19.331 --> 00:58:20.770
<v Speaker 1>you've got seal team six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1415
00:58:20.771 --> 00:58:23.970
<v Speaker 1>it's got to go through all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilian channels right away and they</v>

1416
00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:25.480
<v Speaker 1>have to be privy to all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

1417
00:58:25.481 --> 00:58:27.790
<v Speaker 1>not dimension the Security Council and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

1418
00:58:27.970 --> 00:58:30.730
<v Speaker 1>If you take a look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm talking about the hundred people</v>

1419
00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:35.020
<v Speaker 1>at least to have top secret clearance</v>
<v Speaker 1>who all have different agendas and have</v>

1420
00:58:35.021 --> 00:58:37.690
<v Speaker 1>no interest in glorifying Barack Obama</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all,</v>

1421
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:40.240
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them.</v>

1422
00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:43.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea that you could ever pull</v>
<v Speaker 1>off this,</v>

1423
00:58:43.001 --> 00:58:46.450
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fake assassination of Osama bin</v>

1424
00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Ladin after we've been trying to get him</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this long is is it wouldn't work.</v>

1425
00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Even in a Hollywood movie and when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about fake stories,</v>

1426
00:58:54.881 --> 00:58:57.550
<v Speaker 1>what the CIA was doing with those fake</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories was they were leaking.</v>

1427
00:58:57.551 --> 00:58:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Then it's true two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

1428
00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:01.930
<v Speaker 1>two on Al Jazeera and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But mainly what they would do is they</v>

1429
00:59:01.931 --> 00:59:04.910
<v Speaker 1>want to get information out of you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a young man who believes in you</v>

1430
00:59:04.911 --> 00:59:08.020
<v Speaker 1>are a mom and you got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got captured and they'll show you a</v>

1431
00:59:08.021 --> 00:59:10.960
<v Speaker 1>fake headline of the New York Times and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll say,</v>

1432
00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:11.770
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

1433
00:59:11.770 --> 00:59:15.160
<v Speaker 1>All your guys had been killed and all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them are singing like canaries.</v>

1434
00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:19.150
<v Speaker 1>They used all kinds of technical course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt you don't want to trust</v>

1435
00:59:19.151 --> 00:59:21.070
<v Speaker 1>the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the what's wonderful about</v>

1436
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:22.310
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

1437
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:25.220
<v Speaker 2>this is just a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is anytime you try to keep a secret or</v>

1438
00:59:25.221 --> 00:59:27.080
<v Speaker 2>come up with a huge conspiracy like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1439
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:30.770
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with 16 other people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a totally different agenda.</v>

1440
00:59:30.771 --> 00:59:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Who would want nothing more than to</v>
<v Speaker 2>expose you,</v>

1441
00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:38.630
<v Speaker 2>and anytime you have a group of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Kissinger and Nixon or</v>

1442
00:59:38.631 --> 00:59:42.560
<v Speaker 2>whoever who tried to come up with their</v>
<v Speaker 2>own agenda to steer foreign policy or my</v>

1443
00:59:42.561 --> 00:59:44.990
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come up with a way to glorify their</v>

1444
00:59:44.991 --> 00:59:46.580
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what this did for the</v>

1445
00:59:46.581 --> 00:59:48.290
<v Speaker 2>Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell you something.</v>

1446
00:59:48.291 --> 00:59:49.760
<v Speaker 2>The Republicans are going to have no</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

1447
00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:53.780
<v Speaker 2>They can no longer use the notion that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama is weak on terrorism for this</v>

1448
00:59:53.781 --> 00:59:56.390
<v Speaker 2>upcoming election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can promise you there were plenty</v>

1449
00:59:56.391 --> 00:59:58.910
<v Speaker 2>of Republicans who would have loved to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have taken credit for this.</v>

1450
00:59:59.180 --> 00:59:59.661
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1451
00:59:59.661 --> 01:00:00.261
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1452
01:00:00.261 --> 01:00:01.220
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to go through.</v>

1453
01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:03.650
<v Speaker 2>It'd be basically impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can.</v>

1454
01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:06.290
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>launching a team like seal team six,</v>

1455
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:08.420
<v Speaker 2>that was so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was interesting about this was it</v>

1456
01:00:08.421 --> 01:00:11.830
<v Speaker 2>was so risky for the president that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that notion.</v>

1457
01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:13.310
<v Speaker 2>Here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>

1458
01:00:13.311 --> 01:00:16.010
<v Speaker 2>if you're young and you don't vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why.</v>

1459
01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:18.800
<v Speaker 2>Forget the platform you're on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're Republican or Democrat,</v>

1460
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:22.700
<v Speaker 2>when you vote for a president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure that guy has wisdom.</v>

1461
01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.980
<v Speaker 2>Make sure that guy is an intellect and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has wisdom.</v>

1462
01:00:24.981 --> 01:00:27.680
<v Speaker 2>And here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're the president of United</v>

1463
01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.030
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have very little power,</v>

1464
01:00:29.031 --> 01:00:31.400
<v Speaker 2>but you also have a great deal of power</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is how it works.</v>

1465
01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:33.680
<v Speaker 2>They come to you with six different</v>
<v Speaker 2>scenarios and they say,</v>

1466
01:00:33.681 --> 01:00:36.200
<v Speaker 2>Mr. President,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a lot of intelligence to suggest</v>

1467
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:40.280
<v Speaker 2>that Osam Osama bin Ladin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's been protected by the Isi and</v>

1468
01:00:40.281 --> 01:00:44.240
<v Speaker 2>whoever it is in Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is living in a compound now we could</v>

1469
01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:44.480
<v Speaker 2>drop.</v>

1470
01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Here's one of the options,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could drop 60,000 pounds worth of</v>

1471
01:00:47.451 --> 01:00:51.590
<v Speaker 2>bombs on that and create a crater and</v>
<v Speaker 2>calm the place for DNA and see if it</v>

1472
01:00:51.591 --> 01:00:55.640
<v Speaker 2>really was him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or we can send in a crack commando team</v>

1473
01:00:55.641 --> 01:00:57.470
<v Speaker 2>like seal team six and take this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1474
01:00:57.590 --> 01:00:58.880
<v Speaker 2>Why is that risky?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1475
01:00:58.881 --> 01:01:00.290
<v Speaker 2>here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couple reasons.</v>

1476
01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:04.460
<v Speaker 2>You're sending in a team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a third of a mile or something</v>

1477
01:01:04.461 --> 01:01:06.920
<v Speaker 2>crazy or three miles less away from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1478
01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:09.710
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What Pakistan's west point is this huge</v>

1479
01:01:09.711 --> 01:01:12.350
<v Speaker 2>military facility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna scramble jets,</v>

1480
01:01:12.351 --> 01:01:14.270
<v Speaker 2>which they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a whole bunch of other things.</v>

1481
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:16.580
<v Speaker 2>The minute they start hearing gunshots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1482
01:01:16.581 --> 01:01:17.361
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In their quarter,</v>

1483
01:01:17.361 --> 01:01:19.280
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of people in the</v>

1484
01:01:19.281 --> 01:01:21.380
<v Speaker 2>military probably know he's already</v>
<v Speaker 2>there anyway,</v>

1485
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:24.550
<v Speaker 2>so we send on our team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If Americans die and we fail at this or</v>

1486
01:01:24.551 --> 01:01:26.390
<v Speaker 2>RC helicopter stalls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it did.</v>

1487
01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:29.810
<v Speaker 2>You were taking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say goodbye to your fucking your</v>

1488
01:01:29.811 --> 01:01:32.100
<v Speaker 2>election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you add all those guys in that war</v>

1489
01:01:32.101 --> 01:01:34.380
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton and Gates Hillary.</v>

1490
01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:37.760
<v Speaker 2>I said the news headline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was photo shopped out of the</v>

1491
01:01:37.790 --> 01:01:39.080
<v Speaker 2>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's photoshop,</v>

1492
01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:40.790
<v Speaker 2>a couple of countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>photoshop,</v>

1493
01:01:41.110 --> 01:01:43.300
<v Speaker 2>that's funny because she's a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1494
01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:46.340
<v Speaker 2>but the bottom line is you see all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people including Obama sitting there</v>

1495
01:01:46.341 --> 01:01:50.420
<v Speaker 2>with incredible 10 incredibly tense</v>
<v Speaker 2>faces and he took the weekend to think</v>

1496
01:01:50.421 --> 01:01:53.100
<v Speaker 2>about whether or not to move in on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where the response.</v>

1497
01:01:53.101 --> 01:01:55.670
<v Speaker 2>So you think that the president really</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets that kind of a control.</v>

1498
01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:57.500
<v Speaker 2>I know he does know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you know?</v>

1499
01:01:57.650 --> 01:02:02.650
<v Speaker 2>Because because because I read American</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't a hangover to any biography from a</v>

1500
01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.970
<v Speaker 2>precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think that you really think that</v>

1501
01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:06.510
<v Speaker 2>there's one guy that gets to make the</v>
<v Speaker 2>call,</v>

1502
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:08.510
<v Speaker 2>that that is how our government works.</v>

1503
01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:11.600
<v Speaker 2>The final,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the commander in chief makes the final</v>

1504
01:02:11.601 --> 01:02:13.250
<v Speaker 2>decision when you give them four or</v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

1505
01:02:13.251 --> 01:02:14.930
<v Speaker 2>six sessions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

1506
01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:16.400
<v Speaker 2>those scenarios come from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>department.</v>

1507
01:02:16.401 --> 01:02:18.470
<v Speaker 2>Defense Pentagon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>State Department.</v>

1508
01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:21.550
<v Speaker 2>They come your secretary of state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come from your soul.</v>

1509
01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:24.150
<v Speaker 2>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no military industrial complex</v>

1510
01:02:24.151 --> 01:02:26.220
<v Speaker 2>is one guy that's got his finger at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>button.</v>

1511
01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:28.280
<v Speaker 2>He's able to push all the switch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I said.</v>

1512
01:02:28.281 --> 01:02:29.980
<v Speaker 2>What I said is that he gets to make the</v>
<v Speaker 2>call.</v>

1513
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.880
<v Speaker 2>Military Industrial Complex is so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>competing interests as well,</v>

1514
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:34.650
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is true that there's a lot of</v>

1515
01:02:34.651 --> 01:02:37.110
<v Speaker 2>profit and war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also a lot of risks and I</v>

1516
01:02:37.111 --> 01:02:39.780
<v Speaker 2>agree with everything you've said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with everything you said about</v>

1517
01:02:39.781 --> 01:02:41.250
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seal team six,</v>

1518
01:02:41.251 --> 01:02:43.740
<v Speaker 2>the baddest motherfuckers in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the guys that,</v>

1519
01:02:43.741 --> 01:02:45.780
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know as being a seal is</v>

1520
01:02:45.781 --> 01:02:49.350
<v Speaker 2>incredibly difficult and they take the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best of the seals and 50 fucking percent</v>

1521
01:02:49.351 --> 01:02:52.770
<v Speaker 2>of them wash out because they can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>handle what it takes to be in seal team</v>

1522
01:02:52.771 --> 01:02:53.340
<v Speaker 2>six.</v>

1523
01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read the Deq Marchenko books and</v>

1524
01:02:55.831 --> 01:02:59.660
<v Speaker 2>all the dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're on another level of human bear.</v>

1525
01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:02.400
<v Speaker 2>They're on another level of human being</v>
<v Speaker 2>boss route and was telling me how he</v>

1526
01:03:02.401 --> 01:03:05.520
<v Speaker 2>trains the seal team six and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>record they had for running up and down</v>

1527
01:03:05.521 --> 01:03:07.190
<v Speaker 2>this hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marc Hamann Acada.</v>

1528
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:09.540
<v Speaker 2>He ran up and down this hill four times</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a huge hill.</v>

1529
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:12.210
<v Speaker 2>The seal teams guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did it 12 times and boss had to</v>

1530
01:03:12.211 --> 01:03:14.130
<v Speaker 2>stop them because he thought they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to die.</v>

1531
01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.840
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're on another level.</v>

1532
01:03:15.841 --> 01:03:18.480
<v Speaker 2>There's another level and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're not going to do.</v>

1533
01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:22.550
<v Speaker 2>They all have different agendas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the bottom line is the government is</v>

1534
01:03:22.551 --> 01:03:24.630
<v Speaker 2>lying about a bunch of stories like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the past.</v>

1535
01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:27.030
<v Speaker 2>Jessica Lynch is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a perfect example.</v>

1536
01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:31.110
<v Speaker 2>There's a woman that she was inside of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking hospital and they pretend that</v>

1537
01:03:31.111 --> 01:03:34.740
<v Speaker 2>there was this crazy gun fight to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>her out and rescue her from the Iraqis</v>

1538
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:38.130
<v Speaker 2>and what would really turn down was it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just a girl in the hospital and</v>

1539
01:03:38.131 --> 01:03:39.390
<v Speaker 2>there was no bullets shot at all.</v>

1540
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:41.700
<v Speaker 2>To your point and exactly what you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1541
01:03:41.701 --> 01:03:43.020
<v Speaker 2>let me do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me piggyback on that.</v>

1542
01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:45.420
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it would have been in our interest,</v>

1543
01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:48.720
<v Speaker 2>would have been very much in our</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest to say about Osama bin Laden.</v>

1544
01:03:48.721 --> 01:03:51.300
<v Speaker 2>They had a machine gun on a shooting at</v>
<v Speaker 2>us and you know what happened within.</v>

1545
01:03:51.301 --> 01:03:53.550
<v Speaker 2>Within hours as the stories started</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfolding,</v>

1546
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.140
<v Speaker 2>the truth came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

1547
01:03:55.141 --> 01:03:59.160
<v Speaker 2>That was a woman was in front of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She charged the guy shot her in the leg</v>

1548
01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.700
<v Speaker 2>and Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Osama was not armed yet.</v>

1549
01:04:02.701 --> 01:04:05.310
<v Speaker 2>The guy shot him in the head right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you,</v>

1550
01:04:05.311 --> 01:04:06.670
<v Speaker 2>that's been a question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1551
01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.730
<v Speaker 2>and Banksy Moon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of,</v>

1552
01:04:08.731 --> 01:04:09.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1553
01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:12.630
<v Speaker 2>the secretary general of United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>United Nations came out and said,</v>

1554
01:04:12.631 --> 01:04:13.291
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1555
01:04:13.291 --> 01:04:14.880
<v Speaker 2>there was no trial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a bit barbaric.</v>

1556
01:04:14.881 --> 01:04:18.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that was who said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a lot of backlash and said</v>

1557
01:04:18.301 --> 01:04:19.440
<v Speaker 2>the guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy was on,</v>

1558
01:04:19.441 --> 01:04:20.910
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck didn't you arrest them</v>

1559
01:04:20.911 --> 01:04:21.450
<v Speaker 2>instead of shooting?</v>

1560
01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:22.320
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they shot him,</v>

1561
01:04:22.321 --> 01:04:25.500
<v Speaker 2>they had a picture and the picture had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason they haven't released it is</v>

1562
01:04:25.501 --> 01:04:27.030
<v Speaker 2>because part of his skull got blown</v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

1563
01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Now what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really just photoshop that a</v>

1564
01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:34.380
<v Speaker 2>blur that out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a kit and a bride style.</v>

1565
01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:37.310
<v Speaker 2>Here's what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what they did when the seal teams</v>

1566
01:04:37.311 --> 01:04:37.921
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about this guy?</v>

1567
01:04:37.921 --> 01:04:42.090
<v Speaker 2>He shoots Osama bin Ladin in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He takes a picture of it,</v>

1568
01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:45.930
<v Speaker 2>he fax it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he scans and sends that to,</v>

1569
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:48.600
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the office where they're all,</v>

1570
01:04:48.601 --> 01:04:49.890
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these people are there.</v>

1571
01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:52.350
<v Speaker 2>They get this picture of a but in mom's</v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

1572
01:04:52.351 --> 01:04:55.680
<v Speaker 2>How do you know what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put it through a facial recognition</v>

1573
01:04:55.681 --> 01:04:57.600
<v Speaker 2>scan right away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is about,</v>

1574
01:04:57.601 --> 01:04:59.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about as they take the geometric</v>

1575
01:04:59.341 --> 01:05:00.660
<v Speaker 2>portions where your nose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your eyes.</v>

1576
01:05:00.661 --> 01:05:02.010
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a fingerprint.</v>

1577
01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:03.300
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>

1578
01:05:03.301 --> 01:05:04.850
<v Speaker 2>That's a match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the Sullivan Law.</v>

1579
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Then they take DNA as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they got the body and you,</v>

1580
01:05:08.161 --> 01:05:11.610
<v Speaker 2>not many people saw his body probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally 100.</v>

1581
01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:14.920
<v Speaker 2>All the seal team guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those people on that ship that dress</v>

1582
01:05:14.921 --> 01:05:17.740
<v Speaker 2>the body that read the rights and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>dumped at sea,</v>

1583
01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:18.220
<v Speaker 2>which</v>

1584
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.970
<v Speaker 1>according to Islamic law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to bury a body 24 hours after</v>

1585
01:05:21.971 --> 01:05:24.100
<v Speaker 1>it's been killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's supposed to be at sea.</v>

1586
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason I'm standing is a great</v>

1587
01:05:25.991 --> 01:05:26.771
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason they didn't,</v>

1588
01:05:26.771 --> 01:05:29.630
<v Speaker 1>they did it at sea because no country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including Saudi Arabia where he's from.</v>

1589
01:05:29.631 --> 01:05:32.930
<v Speaker 1>We would take that body right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because then it would be a shrine to be</v>

1590
01:05:32.931 --> 01:05:35.550
<v Speaker 1>a shrine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Doug Stanhope had a great point.</v>

1591
01:05:35.570 --> 01:05:37.050
<v Speaker 1>You said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come these,</v>

1592
01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:39.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they identified his body within an hour</v>

1593
01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.950
<v Speaker 1>you had to take these poor fucking guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are wrongly accused.</v>

1594
01:05:41.951 --> 01:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Thirty years to get a DNA match to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of prison.</v>

1595
01:05:45.050 --> 01:05:46.300
<v Speaker 1>That's so true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dog Stand.</v>

1596
01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:47.470
<v Speaker 1>That was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so true.</v>

1597
01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:50.590
<v Speaker 1>This is a perfect point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the fuck man.</v>

1598
01:05:50.591 --> 01:05:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it really that important to kill some</v>

1599
01:05:52.601 --> 01:05:54.310
<v Speaker 1>guy living in squalor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1600
01:05:54.311 --> 01:05:57.620
<v Speaker 1>is it that much more important than</v>
<v Speaker 1>rescuing citizens that are wrongly</v>

1601
01:05:57.621 --> 01:05:57.870
<v Speaker 1>accused?</v>

1602
01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:58.920
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good question too,</v>

1603
01:05:58.921 --> 01:06:00.760
<v Speaker 1>because it also raises this</v>
<v Speaker 1>assassination,</v>

1604
01:06:00.761 --> 01:06:04.330
<v Speaker 1>raises a fuck load of questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of which is now that we've gotten</v>

1605
01:06:04.331 --> 01:06:06.280
<v Speaker 1>the big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big net name.</v>

1606
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a justification for being in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan?</v>

1607
01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:11.141
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

1608
01:06:11.141 --> 01:06:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I never did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the first place.</v>

1609
01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Listening to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were in Afghanistan for minerals</v>

1610
01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:20.310
<v Speaker 1>and probably heroin over Afghanistan for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Taliban had dropped heroin</v>

1611
01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:25.630
<v Speaker 1>production down to minuscule levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the United States is over there and</v>

1612
01:06:25.631 --> 01:06:29.950
<v Speaker 1>we produce shit more than 90 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world's heroin in Afghanistan.</v>

1613
01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:31.870
<v Speaker 1>More than 90 percent of the world's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's grown up.</v>

1614
01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:34.330
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the world is big.</v>

1615
01:06:35.050 --> 01:06:38.980
<v Speaker 1>The world is big as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if 90 percent of the Viagra was</v>

1616
01:06:38.981 --> 01:06:41.380
<v Speaker 1>grown in one little village,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

1617
01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:45.160
<v Speaker 1>We would infiltrate that culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would find a way to corrupt them and</v>

1618
01:06:45.161 --> 01:06:46.300
<v Speaker 1>turn them into terrorism.</v>

1619
01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:49.450
<v Speaker 1>We would have them attack ships or blow</v>
<v Speaker 1>things up and then we'd use that as an</v>

1620
01:06:49.451 --> 01:06:51.190
<v Speaker 1>excuse to go in and Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're Viagra.</v>

1621
01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:53.830
<v Speaker 1>That's what we would do because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we've done forever.</v>

1622
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.050
<v Speaker 1>This is what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was a Viagra was luck,</v>

1623
01:06:56.051 --> 01:06:58.730
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big d hard dick pills are very fucking</v>

1624
01:06:58.750 --> 01:06:59.830
<v Speaker 1>valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1625
01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.690
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they didn't exist,</v>

1626
01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.630
<v Speaker 1>I like tigers and get them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan,</v>

1627
01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:07.630
<v Speaker 1>in Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The number one way that they bribe</v>

1628
01:07:07.631 --> 01:07:09.460
<v Speaker 1>warlords,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't know the way I've</v>

1629
01:07:09.461 --> 01:07:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Ganesan is structured today in 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why it's an unwinnable</v>

1630
01:07:13.541 --> 01:07:16.270
<v Speaker 1>country and an unwinnable war because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a country,</v>

1631
01:07:16.271 --> 01:07:20.770
<v Speaker 1>it's a series of war lords that are all</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of interconnected and they all live</v>

1632
01:07:20.771 --> 01:07:22.150
<v Speaker 1>in these villages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1633
01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:24.520
<v Speaker 1>always has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not going to change the way</v>

1634
01:07:24.521 --> 01:07:25.630
<v Speaker 1>they get them to random.</v>

1635
01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:28.870
<v Speaker 1>The Taliban is they give him Viagra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the number one like,</v>

1636
01:07:28.871 --> 01:07:30.360

1684
01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:14.340
<v Speaker 1>the view that the world is a theater</v>
<v Speaker 1>played out for your own enjoyment.</v>

1685
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:16.980
<v Speaker 1>If you were going to have this story</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to any conclusion,</v>

1686
01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:19.380
<v Speaker 1>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the best conclusion ever.</v>

1687
01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if this was a fucking movie,</v>

1688
01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:23.640

01:09:23.641 --> 01:09:25.650
<v Speaker 1>just died mysteriously in and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumped them and see,</v>

1690
01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:26.633
<v Speaker 1>they'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1691
01:09:26.770 --> 01:09:28.950
<v Speaker 1>And when you buckle up and the credits</v>
<v Speaker 1>would roll and he'd go,</v>

1692
01:09:28.951 --> 01:09:31.890
<v Speaker 1>fucking for sure there's going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sequel for sure.</v>

1693
01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:34.380
<v Speaker 1>That guy is coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They dump them.</v>

1694
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:36.950
<v Speaker 1>And then they're going to show you how</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't really die and he can,</v>

1695
01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:38.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they fucking,</v>

1696
01:09:38.101 --> 01:09:41.220
<v Speaker 1>they knocked them out the back and shot</v>
<v Speaker 1>some other guy in the head and said it</v>

1697
01:09:41.221 --> 01:09:41.700
<v Speaker 1>was him.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They had to come in there with three</v>

1700
01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.920
<v Speaker 1>helicopters if it really happened that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1701
01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.110
<v Speaker 1>When you hear about the Jessica Lynch</v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1703
01:09:50.371 --> 01:09:52.710
<v Speaker 1>you have to wonder how much of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>story is true and how much of it is not.</v>

1704
01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:57.030
<v Speaker 1>If is it possible that they storm this</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking compound?</v>

1705
01:09:57.031 --> 01:09:58.980
<v Speaker 1>There are a bunch of Islamic militants</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1706
01:09:59.030 --> 01:10:01.080
<v Speaker 1>There are a bunch of bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were looking for it.</v>

1707
01:10:01.081 --> 01:10:02.760
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kept these motherfuckers,</v>

1708

<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

1709
01:10:04.261 --> 01:10:05.580

1710
01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:06.241
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1711
01:10:06.241 --> 01:10:08.140
<v Speaker 1>we know we're doing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to take them a lot.</v>

1712
01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:10.160
<v Speaker 1>We've had them on ice for five years and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna.</v>

1713
01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Say we shot them and we're going to fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys up.</v>

1714
01:10:12.271 --> 01:10:14.340
<v Speaker 1>We're going to fuck up their mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they got to go.</v>

1715
01:10:14.341 --> 01:10:16.350
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd been looking for him.</v>

1716
01:10:16.351 --> 01:10:17.510
<v Speaker 1>He's not that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

1717
01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.810
<v Speaker 1>we've been telling him this whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1718
01:10:18.811 --> 01:10:20.160
<v Speaker 1>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking hadn't been loud and</v>

1719
01:10:20.161 --> 01:10:23.490
<v Speaker 1>that's why we need to go to Pakistan</v>
<v Speaker 1>with these drones and Shoot Hellfire</v>

1720
01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:26.190
<v Speaker 1>missiles out of these drones to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountainside to fuck all these people</v>

1721
01:10:26.191 --> 01:10:27.720
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because they've got bin Ladin.</v>

1722
01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile</v>

1723
01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:30.420
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're telling you,</v>

1724
01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:32.270
<v Speaker 2>been locked up and get forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen him.</v>

1725
01:10:32.271 --> 01:10:33.420
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen him.</v>

1726
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:37.620
<v Speaker 2>I think it actually puts us in a really</v>
<v Speaker 2>tough position because now you've got a</v>

1727
01:10:37.621 --> 01:10:40.980
<v Speaker 2>lot of people asking very tough</v>
<v Speaker 2>questions of Pakistan saying you guys</v>

1728
01:10:40.981 --> 01:10:44.370
<v Speaker 2>didn't know he was there and Pakistan</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been our ally for the most part.</v>

1729
01:10:44.371 --> 01:10:45.230
<v Speaker 2>They're not really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've,</v>

1730
01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.940
<v Speaker 2>they ostensibly been our ally because we</v>
<v Speaker 2>need them.</v>

1731
01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:49.170
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of our,</v>

1732
01:10:49.230 --> 01:10:51.570
<v Speaker 2>well they're friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We pay them to be our friends,</v>

1733
01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:53.560
<v Speaker 2>but the most dangerous country in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1734
01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:54.830
<v Speaker 2>a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

1735
01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:58.830
<v Speaker 2>They have 100 nuclear weapons and</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing and they've already given that</v>

1736
01:10:58.831 --> 01:11:02.950
<v Speaker 2>technology already to Libya,</v>
<v Speaker 2>North Korea and um,</v>

1737
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:04.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck else.</v>

1738
01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:07.500
<v Speaker 2>One of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the persons and one of the group</v>

1739
01:11:07.501 --> 01:11:12.501
<v Speaker 2>of people and and to this guy a que con,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had complicity with the Pakistani</v>

1740
01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:16.530
<v Speaker 2>military and there's no doubt that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pakistan has its own agenda.</v>

1741
01:11:16.530 --> 01:11:18.240
<v Speaker 2>They were fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're terrified of India.</v>

1742
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:19.650
<v Speaker 2>They use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1743
01:11:19.651 --> 01:11:21.050
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing about us foreign</v>
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>

1744
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:22.740
<v Speaker 2>Nobody thinks about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have our agenda,</v>

1745
01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:23.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We go in with,</v>

1746
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:24.840
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go into Afghanistan.</v>

1747
01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:28.020
<v Speaker 2>The motherfuckers that lived there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>around there and they go,</v>

1748
01:11:28.021 --> 01:11:29.760
<v Speaker 2>you guys are going to be gone in 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1749
01:11:29.761 --> 01:11:31.830
<v Speaker 2>We got to deal with what's really going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1750
01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:34.960
<v Speaker 2>So you want us to be mean to the quote</v>
<v Speaker 2>unquote Taliban.</v>

1751
01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the Taiwanese.</v>

1752
01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:39.240
<v Speaker 2>It's the dude with the biggest fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>guns and the most drugs.</v>

1753
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That she was going to be holding the</v>

1754
01:11:41.071 --> 01:11:43.920
<v Speaker 2>cards after you guys leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So after your centralized government,</v>

1755
01:11:43.921 --> 01:11:46.890
<v Speaker 2>that big experiment where you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy in a country that's always</v>

1756
01:11:46.891 --> 01:11:49.400
<v Speaker 2>been a series of tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to tell me what,</v>

1757
01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:52.020
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we have to deal with that fucking</v>

1758
01:11:52.021 --> 01:11:52.350
<v Speaker 2>mess.</v>

1759
01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:54.720
<v Speaker 2>We got to deal with that law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This area was aristotle,</v>

1760
01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:57.270
<v Speaker 2>etc. And that's what's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kind of just wAit and let us spend</v>

1761
01:11:57.271 --> 01:11:58.800
<v Speaker 2>a shitload of money and then they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1762
01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:01.230
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a vacuum and I just fill it up and it</v>

1763
01:12:01.231 --> 01:12:03.930
<v Speaker 2>goes back to normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the tough thing about foreign</v>

1764
01:12:03.931 --> 01:12:04.764
<v Speaker 2>policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1765
01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>

1766
01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:07.800
<v Speaker 2>It's a very tricky thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1767
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:10.290
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very tricky thing to go nation</v>

1768
01:12:10.291 --> 01:12:11.340
<v Speaker 2>building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a game,</v>

1769
01:12:11.341 --> 01:12:12.600
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1770
01:12:12.610 --> 01:12:15.250
<v Speaker 2>it station building is the dumbest game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

1771
01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:19.740
<v Speaker 2>It's so clearly a resource game because</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's our biggest fucking physical</v>

1772
01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:24.390
<v Speaker 2>threat of safety ready Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's right next door or you can fucking</v>

<v Speaker 2>drive there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That life is worth a nickel.</v>

1774
01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:30.180
<v Speaker 2>It's in and everyone's selling drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goes back to what you said,</v>

1775
01:12:30.210 --> 01:12:33.060
<v Speaker 2>how we started this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said telling your daughter to do one</v>

1776
01:12:33.061 --> 01:12:33.180
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1777
01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:36.060
<v Speaker 2>She does the other you would think you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can nation build at the.</v>

1778
01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:38.130
<v Speaker 2>At the point of view from the barrel of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a gun,</v>

1779
01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:40.110
<v Speaker 2>you think you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to tell people how to</v>

1780
01:12:40.111 --> 01:12:43.140
<v Speaker 2>behave the minute you come in there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a foreigner who doesn't speak</v>

1781
01:12:43.141 --> 01:12:45.510
<v Speaker 2>their language and you're telling them</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to fucking live.</v>

1782
01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:47.460
<v Speaker 2>What do people do the minute they do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1783
01:12:47.461 --> 01:12:49.350
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out of here and if I can't</v>

1784
01:12:49.351 --> 01:12:50.910
<v Speaker 2>shoot you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to keep my mouth shut and</v>

1785
01:12:50.911 --> 01:12:52.440
<v Speaker 2>when you're gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spend all your money.</v>

1786
01:12:52.441 --> 01:12:54.420
<v Speaker 2>When you're fucking gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do whatever I want.</v>

1787
01:12:54.421 --> 01:12:56.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do what I'm supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We only go places where there's</v>

1788
01:12:56.941 --> 01:12:58.890
<v Speaker 2>something that's the only place where we</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

1789
01:12:58.891 --> 01:13:00.750
<v Speaker 2>We pretend that there's these big</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>

1790
01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:02.850
<v Speaker 2>It's just like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the country of pfizer that</v>

1791
01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.020
<v Speaker 2>produces viagara.</v>

1792
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:06.900
<v Speaker 2>If there was such a little land that</v>
<v Speaker 2>produced viagara,</v>

1793
01:13:06.910 --> 01:13:09.240
<v Speaker 2>we would fucking steal from them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would rob them.</v>

1794
01:13:09.490 --> 01:13:12.290
<v Speaker 2>Mexico has got tacos and tacos aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>worth that much.</v>

1795
01:13:12.291 --> 01:13:14.650
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that the only thing that has,</v>

1796
01:13:15.330 --> 01:13:17.790
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that has resilience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only way,</v>

1797
01:13:17.850 --> 01:13:20.700
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that changes anything in</v>
<v Speaker 2>life and the only thing that has</v>

1798
01:13:20.701 --> 01:13:25.200
<v Speaker 2>resilience is ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An idea is very powerful.</v>

1799
01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:27.990
<v Speaker 2>When an idea takes hold like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution of this country or</v>

1800
01:13:27.991 --> 01:13:29.490
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when an idea takes hold,</v>

1801
01:13:29.730 --> 01:13:33.650
<v Speaker 2>if an idea called democracy takes hold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll fucking change and bring down</v>

1802
01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:36.570
<v Speaker 2>military dictatorships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take a look at fucking all of south</v>

1803
01:13:36.571 --> 01:13:38.970
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all military dictatorships.</v>

1804
01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:41.250
<v Speaker 2>Twenty years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The notion of democracy,</v>

1805
01:13:41.490 --> 01:13:45.420
<v Speaker 2>even as messy as it is took hold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an idea that you just couldn't</v>

1806
01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:47.370
<v Speaker 2>fucking argue with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's by the way,</v>

1807
01:13:47.371 --> 01:13:49.200
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in the middle east,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this spring,</v>

1808
01:13:49.201 --> 01:13:52.380
<v Speaker 2>awakening with all these young people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who who could give a shit about islam.</v>

1809
01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:55.650
<v Speaker 2>What they really care about is having a</v>
<v Speaker 2>better life for themselves and their</v>

1810
01:13:55.651 --> 01:13:59.520
<v Speaker 2>kids and they want education and freedom</v>
<v Speaker 2>of speech and representative government,</v>

1811
01:13:59.521 --> 01:14:02.850
<v Speaker 2>which are human fucking rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You try keeping that now that that's out</v>

1812
01:14:02.851 --> 01:14:03.990
<v Speaker 2>of the box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just try.</v>

1813
01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Good luck to all the kadafi and all his</v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole is good luck trying to keep a</v>

1814
01:14:07.741 --> 01:14:10.050
<v Speaker 2>lid on that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to do it because.</v>

1815
01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Because that's caught and they've seen</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the rest of the world lives.</v>

1816
01:14:14.291 --> 01:14:17.840
<v Speaker 2>They can see it with their computers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their cell phones and you're never going</v>

1817
01:14:17.841 --> 01:14:19.300
<v Speaker 2>to be able to keep the fucking truth</v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

1818
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:21.250
<v Speaker 2>but the two points you can do it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuba.</v>

1819
01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.620
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the final vestige of that is North Korea</v>

1820
01:14:23.621 --> 01:14:26.800
<v Speaker 2>and those people are suffer so horribly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sick,</v>

1821
01:14:26.801 --> 01:14:30.040
<v Speaker 2>but but that's the one place in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world that's still somehow this,</v>

1822
01:14:30.041 --> 01:14:30.671
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1823
01:14:30.671 --> 01:14:33.280
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this tyrannical dIctator has the lid on,</v>

1824
01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:36.340
<v Speaker 2>but there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we were saying,</v>

1825
01:14:36.341 --> 01:14:37.990
<v Speaker 2>there is a tradition of freedom isn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>

1826
01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:42.070
<v Speaker 2>But it's true that the cia is without a</v>
<v Speaker 2>doubt involved in orchestrating a lot of</v>

1827
01:14:42.071 --> 01:14:43.480
<v Speaker 2>these revolts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we.</v>

1828
01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:45.940
<v Speaker 2>It's not that these things are happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>organically.</v>

1829
01:14:46.090 --> 01:14:50.740
<v Speaker 2>Wesley clark in 2007 talked about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>United States plan and all these</v>

1830
01:14:50.741 --> 01:14:53.800
<v Speaker 2>different foreign countries and many of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them that have dictatorships including</v>

1831
01:14:53.801 --> 01:14:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Libya and he talked about the plans to</v>
<v Speaker 2>overthrow Libya and this was in 2007.</v>

1832
01:14:58.030 --> 01:14:59.120
<v Speaker 2>It's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know the,</v>

1833
01:14:59.121 --> 01:15:02.080
<v Speaker 2>the this spring awakening really</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually caught a lot of people on their</v>

1834
01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:05.260
<v Speaker 2>heels and especially a lot of middle</v>
<v Speaker 2>east experts because I think all you</v>

1835
01:15:05.261 --> 01:15:07.090
<v Speaker 2>need to do is push it and then it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1836
01:15:07.091 --> 01:15:08.080
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1837
01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:11.800
<v Speaker 2>you know how it happened in Tunisia of</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetable cart.</v>

1838
01:15:11.801 --> 01:15:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Guy got these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Government officials came and they,</v>

1839
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:16.540
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how the whole revolution</v>

1840
01:15:16.541 --> 01:15:17.320
<v Speaker 2>started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

1841
01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.210
<v Speaker 2>these government guys said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's your license?</v>

1842
01:15:19.211 --> 01:15:20.350
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have a fucking license.</v>

1843
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:23.680
<v Speaker 2>They threw a scales in the street and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took his fruit and smashed.</v>

1844
01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:26.500
<v Speaker 2>You know what he did?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fucking lit himself on fire.</v>

1845
01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:29.410
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he lit himself on fire and protest</v>

1846
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:34.120
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that proverbial match set off a fire</v>

1847
01:15:34.121 --> 01:15:36.600
<v Speaker 2>across the middle east and chooses judge</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions.</v>

1848
01:15:36.730 --> 01:15:40.570
<v Speaker 2>this is the tunisians and the tunisians</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought down a dictator who I believe</v>

1849
01:15:40.571 --> 01:15:43.570
<v Speaker 2>had been in power for 25 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came down and did his name.</v>

1850
01:15:43.571 --> 01:15:46.630
<v Speaker 2>His last name is ali,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they brought that motherfucker down.</v>

1851
01:15:46.631 --> 01:15:50.500
<v Speaker 2>They brought that whole government down</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that kid lit himself on fire and</v>

1852
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:53.080
<v Speaker 2>it caught fire in Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take a look at Syria,</v>

1853
01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:56.890
<v Speaker 2>take a look at what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm bashar al a door to door in Syria</v>

1854
01:15:56.891 --> 01:15:57.520
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

1855
01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.500
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're being brutal because they're</v>

1856
01:15:59.501 --> 01:16:01.450
<v Speaker 2>fucking awful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but while they're,</v>

1857
01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:05.560
<v Speaker 2>they're scared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trainable in the fucking streets</v>

1858
01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:09.100
<v Speaker 2>and it's like the french revolution in</v>
<v Speaker 2>history keeps repeating itself.</v>

1859
01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:10.780
<v Speaker 2>How much of it you think is</v>
<v Speaker 2>orchestrated?</v>

1860
01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:14.590
<v Speaker 2>How much of this is just a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just natural that people are tired of</v>

1861
01:16:14.591 --> 01:16:17.290
<v Speaker 2>being fucked with and how much do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think is the United States?</v>

1862
01:16:17.710 --> 01:16:19.450
<v Speaker 2>I think very little has to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

1863
01:16:19.451 --> 01:16:22.390
<v Speaker 2>In fact the us hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't even get our reporters into the</v>

1864
01:16:22.391 --> 01:16:24.100
<v Speaker 2>Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't even get reported right when</v>

1865
01:16:24.101 --> 01:16:25.870
<v Speaker 2>you hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got like wesley clark is a</v>

1866
01:16:25.871 --> 01:16:27.880
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is your four star general running</v>

1867
01:16:27.881 --> 01:16:29.890
<v Speaker 2>for president?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he says that the United States had</v>

1868
01:16:29.891 --> 01:16:33.210
<v Speaker 2>been plotting this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd always been one.</v>

1869
01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:37.240
<v Speaker 2>The must have some influence on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Think in the sense that we're trying</v>

1870
01:16:37.241 --> 01:16:37.650
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1871
01:16:37.650 --> 01:16:39.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the influence we had for example in</v>

1872
01:16:39.550 --> 01:16:43.090
<v Speaker 2>Libya was that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>along with our nato allies,</v>

1873
01:16:43.091 --> 01:16:45.000
<v Speaker 2>said let's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't allow the,</v>

1874
01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:49.240
<v Speaker 2>the libyan military to fly over these</v>
<v Speaker 2>rebel strong roles in these towns and</v>

1875
01:16:49.241 --> 01:16:51.370
<v Speaker 2>just carpet bomb the fuck out of him and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot him.</v>

1876
01:16:51.670 --> 01:16:53.800
<v Speaker 2>We gotta take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We gotta create a no fly zone around</v>

1877
01:16:53.801 --> 01:16:56.050
<v Speaker 2>these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in that sense we did get militarily</v>

1878
01:16:56.051 --> 01:16:58.000
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very controversial.</v>

1879
01:16:58.001 --> 01:17:00.830
<v Speaker 2>It still is very controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1880
01:17:01.230 --> 01:17:03.700
<v Speaker 2>to an extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that democratic countries</v>

1881
01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:06.130
<v Speaker 2>starting with europe and this was</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually led by europe.</v>

1882
01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:07.610
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1883
01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:08.771
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1884
01:17:08.771 --> 01:17:11.090
<v Speaker 2>they say what is in our national</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest,</v>

1885
01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:13.700
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it still in our national interest for</v>

1886
01:17:13.701 --> 01:17:17.390
<v Speaker 2>khadafi or mubarak in Egypt had been</v>
<v Speaker 2>there for 30 years.</v>

1887
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Is it in our national interest for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy to be in power?</v>

1888
01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:22.940
<v Speaker 2>There is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a convenience.</v>

1889
01:17:22.941 --> 01:17:26.870
<v Speaker 2>When obama was in power and you say you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can make a phone call to mark and say,</v>

1890
01:17:27.050 --> 01:17:28.360
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta,</v>

1891
01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:31.820
<v Speaker 2>you gotta cooperate with Israel because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in our national interest.</v>

1892
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's no longer the case.</v>

1893
01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:36.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a different fucking ball game now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different ballgame.</v>

1894
01:17:36.951 --> 01:17:38.690
<v Speaker 2>you're having to deal with the arab</v>
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>

1895
01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:42.170
<v Speaker 2>You're having to deal with the will of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people and uh,</v>

1896
01:17:42.230 --> 01:17:44.330
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be very interesting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see how it plays out.</v>

1897
01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:48.440
<v Speaker 2>That's what democracy is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like I literally feel like I'm on a</v>

1898
01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:52.190
<v Speaker 2>political talk show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actuallY starting to talk that way.</v>

1899
01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:53.900
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1900
01:17:53.901 --> 01:17:54.440
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>

1901
01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:55.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you read,</v>

1902
01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:58.390
<v Speaker 1>you read shit like confessions of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic hitman and you know,</v>

1903
01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.940
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that we go only into countries</v>

1904
01:18:00.941 --> 01:18:04.990
<v Speaker 1>that have massive natural resources that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to stockpile and control.</v>

1905
01:18:05.490 --> 01:18:07.840
<v Speaker 1>It makes it very skeptical about</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>

1906
01:18:07.841 --> 01:18:11.890
<v Speaker 1>It makes you very skeptical when you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the money that people spend on war.</v>

1907
01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:16.570
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not pro socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am pro fixing problems and I think</v>

1908
01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:19.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe necessarily in welfare.</v>

1909
01:18:19.530 --> 01:18:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't believe that if you give</v>
<v Speaker 1>people money that you're going to</v>

1910
01:18:22.810 --> 01:18:24.780
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another improve their life</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're,</v>

1911
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:26.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were broke and now you give them</v>

1912
01:18:26.321 --> 01:18:27.700
<v Speaker 1>money and now everything's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

1913
01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:29.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to develop a whole</v>

1914
01:18:29.681 --> 01:18:31.780
<v Speaker 1>culture that expects to get a check for</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

1915
01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:34.480
<v Speaker 1>And then when you have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no motivation,</v>

1916
01:18:34.481 --> 01:18:36.850
<v Speaker 1>you have no work ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will have no enjoyment and</v>

1917
01:18:36.851 --> 01:18:39.100
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no productivity.</v>

1918
01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:44.650
<v Speaker 1>But I am for fixing schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am for trying to develop human beings</v>

1919
01:18:44.651 --> 01:18:48.310
<v Speaker 1>that are going to contribute and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a society and as a community and as a</v>

1920
01:18:48.311 --> 01:18:50.290
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the most important things</v>

1921
01:18:50.291 --> 01:18:52.690
<v Speaker 1>we can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet we Ignore that.</v>

1922
01:18:52.810 --> 01:18:57.040
<v Speaker 1>We all know this and we ignore that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on boogie men on the other</v>

1923
01:18:57.041 --> 01:19:01.360
<v Speaker 1>side of the fucking planet where it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite obvious that this is transparent</v>

1924
01:19:01.361 --> 01:19:05.860
<v Speaker 1>game going on where these boogeymen just</v>
<v Speaker 1>so happen to only be where the gas is.</v>

1925
01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:07.960
<v Speaker 1>They just so happen to only be where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil is.</v>

1926
01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.270
<v Speaker 1>they just so happen to only be with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin is.</v>

1927
01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:13.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not that cut and dry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

1928
01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:15.090
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think also that the.</v>

1929
01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:18.710
<v Speaker 2>The other question it raised is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime you have a country with a lot of</v>

1930
01:19:18.711 --> 01:19:21.830
<v Speaker 2>natural resources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just take oil which is traded</v>

1931
01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:25.530
<v Speaker 2>openly on the world market and that none</v>
<v Speaker 2>of us would go anywhere without oil.</v>

1932
01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:27.760
<v Speaker 2>And we all need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1933
01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.710
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the history of oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an expert on the history of oil.</v>

1934
01:19:30.711 --> 01:19:32.060
<v Speaker 2>I did live in Saudi Arabia for three</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

1935
01:19:32.061 --> 01:19:32.681
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1936
01:19:32.681 --> 01:19:33.980
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at the history of oil,</v>

1937
01:19:33.981 --> 01:19:34.814
<v Speaker 2>you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1938
01:19:35.490 --> 01:19:38.750
<v Speaker 2>in the middle east,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was strategic because of that</v>

1939
01:19:38.751 --> 01:19:41.000
<v Speaker 2>resource.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The soviets and the americans were</v>

1940
01:19:41.001 --> 01:19:43.460
<v Speaker 2>obviously always fighting over who had</v>
<v Speaker 2>control of that,</v>

1941
01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:45.590
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the arabs for the most part created a</v>

1942
01:19:45.591 --> 01:19:47.960
<v Speaker 2>little something called opec and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck both you guys,</v>

1943
01:19:47.961 --> 01:19:48.950
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna start.</v>

1944
01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:50.930
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna start controlling our own</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

1945
01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:54.140
<v Speaker 2>But the idea of pan arab islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the notion that all the arabs,</v>

1946
01:19:54.141 --> 01:19:57.410
<v Speaker 2>that's what saddam hussein and those</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys and abdel nasser in Egypt try to</v>

1947
01:19:57.411 --> 01:19:58.550
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They trIed to bring all the arabs</v>

1948
01:19:58.551 --> 01:20:01.130
<v Speaker 2>together under one banner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's never going to do that because</v>

1949
01:20:01.131 --> 01:20:02.390
<v Speaker 2>people are nationalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people go,</v>

1950
01:20:02.391 --> 01:20:03.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm libyan first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not arab,</v>

1951
01:20:03.771 --> 01:20:05.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm living and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm egyptian.</v>

1952
01:20:05.451 --> 01:20:06.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just never worked.</v>

1953
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:07.461
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1954
01:20:07.461 --> 01:20:08.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1955
01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:11.130
<v Speaker 2>you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at how there was so much,</v>

1956
01:20:11.190 --> 01:20:15.000
<v Speaker 2>there was so much involvement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And vying for those resources between</v>

1957
01:20:15.001 --> 01:20:17.610
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two superpowers that of course,</v>

1958
01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:21.200
<v Speaker 2>of course shit is going to get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course when saddam was saying it</v>

1959
01:20:21.210 --> 01:20:25.180
<v Speaker 2>makes a huge mistake and invades Kuwait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1960
01:20:25.210 --> 01:20:27.660
<v Speaker 2>and we come to is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not only come to his rescue,</v>

1961
01:20:27.661 --> 01:20:30.840
<v Speaker 2>but we use Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the land of muhammad,</v>

1962
01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:31.521
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

1963
01:20:31.521 --> 01:20:35.490
<v Speaker 2>where islam started and we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>launching planes out of Saudi Arabia to</v>

1964
01:20:35.491 --> 01:20:39.750
<v Speaker 2>kill other muslims for a guy like some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of bin ladin that was the equivalent of</v>

1965
01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:42.390
<v Speaker 2>slaughtering pigs in a synagogue for</v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys.</v>

1966
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:44.160
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're out of your fucking mind.</v>

1967
01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:46.650
<v Speaker 2>We're now the imperialists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you want to call them are</v>

1968
01:20:46.651 --> 01:20:48.300
<v Speaker 2>actually killing muslims from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

1969
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.950
<v Speaker 2>from the original caliphate state when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking know.</v>

1970
01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:54.720
<v Speaker 2>And that was one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>radicalized him when the.</v>

1971
01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:56.490
<v Speaker 2>These are the kinds of things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

1972
01:20:56.491 --> 01:20:56.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1973
01:20:56.930 --> 01:20:59.580
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always the cio has an idea.</v>

1974
01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:01.830
<v Speaker 2>They want to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you say we,</v>

1975
01:21:01.831 --> 01:21:02.730
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1976
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.490
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of different people in a room</v>
<v Speaker 2>that come up with an idea.</v>

1977
01:21:05.491 --> 01:21:06.760
<v Speaker 2>But let's just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just for the,</v>

1978
01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:08.820
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for let's just simplify it and say the</v>

1979
01:21:08.821 --> 01:21:10.900
<v Speaker 2>cia or the us government at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1980
01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:12.330
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want this,</v>

1981
01:21:12.331 --> 01:21:15.360
<v Speaker 2>this is our agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing that they always talk about is</v>

1982
01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:20.810
<v Speaker 2>there's always circumstances that unfold</v>
<v Speaker 2>that none of us had any fucking idea</v>

1983
01:21:21.091 --> 01:21:23.490
<v Speaker 2>what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be that's the way life is.</v>

1984
01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:26.490
<v Speaker 2>You got one plan and everything goes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1985
01:21:26.850 --> 01:21:27.480
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1986
01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:30.780
<v Speaker 2>you could make the argument by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the idea that we killed osama bin</v>

1987
01:21:30.781 --> 01:21:32.700
<v Speaker 2>ladin has raised a whole bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>

1988
01:21:32.701 --> 01:21:35.340
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't want to answer</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a political point of view.</v>

1989
01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:36.570
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1990
01:21:36.630 --> 01:21:38.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1991
01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:39.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1992
01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:40.990
<v Speaker 2>and so it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a verb.</v>

1993
01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:43.470
<v Speaker 1>What I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point was not that,</v>

1994
01:21:43.471 --> 01:21:46.260
<v Speaker 1>why do we go to war?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we spend money on the things</v>

1995
01:21:46.261 --> 01:21:49.170
<v Speaker 1>that we really need to spend money on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do we spend all this money on war?</v>

1996
01:21:50.410 --> 01:21:52.290
<v Speaker 1>We do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't spend nearly enough do.</v>

1997
01:21:52.291 --> 01:21:55.680
<v Speaker 1>There's massive school cuts right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>that raises the class of massive school</v>

1998
01:21:55.681 --> 01:21:56.460
<v Speaker 1>cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>

1999
01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:58.590
<v Speaker 1>There's fucking no community centers in</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2000
01:21:58.591 --> 01:22:00.700
<v Speaker 1>in these bad neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no guide,</v>

2001
01:22:00.701 --> 01:22:03.630
<v Speaker 1>there's no counseling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you wanted to look at the one huge</v>

2002
01:22:03.631 --> 01:22:06.900
<v Speaker 1>problem that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's babies and children growing up and</v>

2003
01:22:06.901 --> 01:22:09.990
<v Speaker 1>becoming shitty human beings because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no love because there's not</v>

2004
01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:12.760
<v Speaker 1>getting any help and they're at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not putting money in that at all.</v>

2005
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:16.020
<v Speaker 1>The question of disproportionate amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of money we put in the military budget</v>

2006
01:22:16.021 --> 01:22:19.680
<v Speaker 1>and compared to how we treat children in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country and raise kids and work on</v>

2007
01:22:19.710 --> 01:22:23.400
<v Speaker 1>terrible communities and work on</v>
<v Speaker 1>educating and getting people out of bad</v>

2008
01:22:23.401 --> 01:22:24.830
<v Speaker 1>situations and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2009
01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:25.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know they're going to figure it out</v>

2010
01:22:25.891 --> 01:22:26.430
<v Speaker 1>on their own.</v>

2011
01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:31.430
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a fucking clue what kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a disproportionate life you'd be</v>

2012
01:22:32.071 --> 01:22:35.670
<v Speaker 1>living if you were born in the ghetto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever been around the projects.</v>

2013
01:22:35.671 --> 01:22:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been around terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods?</v>

2014
01:22:37.530 --> 01:22:39.690
<v Speaker 1>I never lived in a really bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood,</v>

2015
01:22:39.691 --> 01:22:43.200
<v Speaker 1>but I lived in Jamaica plain in boston</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't good by any stretch of the</v>

2016
01:22:43.201 --> 01:22:45.780
<v Speaker 1>imagination and there was a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>really poor people around me,</v>

2017
01:22:45.781 --> 01:22:48.000
<v Speaker 1>but we would go into really bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods.</v>

2018
01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:51.360
<v Speaker 1>We would go to buy pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would go to do dIfferent shit.</v>

2019
01:22:51.361 --> 01:22:53.130
<v Speaker 1>We would go just because it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>

2020
01:22:53.131 --> 01:22:54.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were young kids.</v>

2021
01:22:54.301 --> 01:22:57.150
<v Speaker 1>We're close to bad neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people lIve in it in ways that</v>

2022
01:22:57.151 --> 01:23:00.690
<v Speaker 1>you can't even wrap your head around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not much ways out of there.</v>

2023
01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:03.400
<v Speaker 1>You're you're there and you're golf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tomorrow is a classic example of how</v>

2024
01:23:03.401 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 1>about fucking detroit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're 50 percent of the people can't</v>

2025
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.150
<v Speaker 2>read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievable.</v>

2026
01:23:07.151 --> 01:23:10.180
<v Speaker 2>That's a real statistic that just came</v>
<v Speaker 2>out was actually 47 percent,</v>

2027
01:23:10.450 --> 01:23:13.270
<v Speaker 2>47 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't say that.</v>

2028
01:23:13.271 --> 01:23:16.450
<v Speaker 2>That's an even playing field and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't say that for the human race.</v>

2029
01:23:16.570 --> 01:23:18.580
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't need to be addressed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>helped.</v>

2030
01:23:18.581 --> 01:23:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not a mountain getting welfare</v>

2031
01:23:20.861 --> 01:23:23.140
<v Speaker 2>mothers money so they can keep shitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>out kids.</v>

2032
01:23:23.410 --> 01:23:26.770
<v Speaker 2>It's about helping the fucking kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The welfare mother might already be</v>

2033
01:23:26.771 --> 01:23:29.020
<v Speaker 2>fucked or programming might already be</v>
<v Speaker 2>jacked.</v>

2034
01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:31.530
<v Speaker 2>She might already be on some downward or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2035
01:23:31.531 --> 01:23:33.850
<v Speaker 2>the addiction spiral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>

2036
01:23:33.970 --> 01:23:35.200
<v Speaker 2>but you can help that kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2037
01:23:35.201 --> 01:23:37.870
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that always raised</v>
<v Speaker 2>with social scientists as they say,</v>

2038
01:23:38.170 --> 01:23:41.260
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of cases in this country</v>
<v Speaker 2>where were you through a lot of money at</v>

2039
01:23:41.261 --> 01:23:43.180
<v Speaker 2>a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's take headstart as an example.</v>

2040
01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:44.401
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2041
01:23:44.401 --> 01:23:45.330
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or just a lot,</v>

2042
01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:47.650
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the money that bush spent on</v>
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>

2043
01:23:47.651 --> 01:23:50.380
<v Speaker 2>which was a lot of money over the past</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight years.</v>

2044
01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Why in the world didn't a lot of test</v>
<v Speaker 2>scores in certain segments of society.</v>

2045
01:23:54.170 --> 01:23:55.760
<v Speaker 2>They didn't budge and sometimes they</v>
<v Speaker 2>went,</v>

2046
01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:57.820
<v Speaker 2>they went down and you spend all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

2047
01:23:57.830 --> 01:24:01.390
<v Speaker 2>Those teachers aren't making shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're spending the money the wrong way.</v>

2048
01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:03.610
<v Speaker 2>The money is being spent too much in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this area.</v>

2049
01:24:03.611 --> 01:24:04.690
<v Speaker 2>Then not that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that area.</v>

2050
01:24:04.691 --> 01:24:06.460
<v Speaker 2>And that's the challenge of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

2051
01:24:06.610 --> 01:24:09.590
<v Speaker 2>That's the challenge of a bureaucracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You your tax,</v>

2052
01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:13.630
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of money trying to find</v>
<v Speaker 2>out how to spend that money and where to</v>

2053
01:24:13.631 --> 01:24:17.470
<v Speaker 2>spend the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always been a challenge for a</v>

2054
01:24:17.471 --> 01:24:19.780
<v Speaker 2>proportion of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Money is the problem.</v>

2055
01:24:19.781 --> 01:24:22.450
<v Speaker 2>The proportion is tiny compared to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

2056
01:24:22.451 --> 01:24:25.150
<v Speaker 2>It's tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The salaries that teachers get is</v>

2057
01:24:25.151 --> 01:24:29.590
<v Speaker 2>unlivable and that is a really important</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of being a human being.</v>

2058
01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.920
<v Speaker 2>If you look back on your teachers that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had and how much they influenced you</v>

2059
01:24:32.921 --> 01:24:34.330
<v Speaker 2>and how much power they have over you.</v>

2060
01:24:34.450 --> 01:24:36.680
<v Speaker 2>This is the person who stands in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the class and tells you how the</v>

2061
01:24:36.681 --> 01:24:38.620
<v Speaker 2>fucking world works and when you're a</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid,</v>

2062
01:24:38.621 --> 01:24:42.310
<v Speaker 2>that's a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge responsibility that many times is</v>

2063
01:24:42.311 --> 01:24:45.790
<v Speaker 2>bestowed on idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bestowed on idiots and they took</v>

2064
01:24:45.791 --> 01:24:48.070
<v Speaker 2>this job because they couldn't get</v>
<v Speaker 2>another job and they're fucking,</v>

2065
01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:51.310
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try tribe with the teacher's unions and</v>

2066
01:24:51.311 --> 01:24:54.490
<v Speaker 2>then just try getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just try firing a teacher who has tenure</v>

2067
01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:57.370
<v Speaker 2>because they've been teaching for three</v>
<v Speaker 2>years and a lot of districts just try</v>

2068
01:24:57.371 --> 01:25:00.890
<v Speaker 2>now in the high schools they get tenure</v>
<v Speaker 2>like so hard to find our schools.</v>

2069
01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:03.490
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is so well there's a docuMentary</v>

2070
01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:07.060
<v Speaker 2>called waiting for superman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but forget that there's an article just</v>

2071
01:25:07.061 --> 01:25:11.020
<v Speaker 2>now in the New York times about about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to get a.</v>

2072
01:25:11.021 --> 01:25:14.950
<v Speaker 2>I think it was in the state of Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just trying to get one law passed one</v>

2073
01:25:14.951 --> 01:25:18.220
<v Speaker 2>law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one law that makes it harder for a</v>

2074
01:25:18.221 --> 01:25:22.450
<v Speaker 2>teacher to get tenure or easier to hire</v>
<v Speaker 2>a high quality teacher in place.</v>

2075
01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:27.450
<v Speaker 2>If someone was not performing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't dealing with fucking 65</v>

2076
01:25:27.521 --> 01:25:30.130
<v Speaker 2>different interests with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>lobbying power.</v>

2077
01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:34.660
<v Speaker 2>Starting with the teacher's union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That also then has a subsIdiary called</v>

2078
01:25:34.661 --> 01:25:38.170
<v Speaker 2>the chicago teacher's union that has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidiary called the county teachers</v>

2079
01:25:38.171 --> 01:25:42.490
<v Speaker 2>union and you're dealing with fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reality of trying to make a law go</v>

2080
01:25:42.491 --> 01:25:44.200
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy shit,</v>

2081
01:25:44.201 --> 01:25:45.330
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy shit.</v>

2082
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:47.650
<v Speaker 2>Talk to a senator sometime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>

2083
01:25:47.651 --> 01:25:49.360
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get a law passed and it's a</v>

2084
01:25:49.361 --> 01:25:52.090
<v Speaker 2>simple one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talk to him and see how long it takes</v>

2085
01:25:52.150 --> 01:25:54.880
<v Speaker 2>and how many years and how many people</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to pay off and how many people.</v>

2086
01:25:54.881 --> 01:25:58.600
<v Speaker 2>You got to convince them you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a homicide because a lot of people</v>

2087
01:25:58.601 --> 01:26:00.790
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with the law as two things.</v>

2088
01:26:00.791 --> 01:26:02.620
<v Speaker 2>You pass a law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does one thing.</v>

2089
01:26:02.621 --> 01:26:04.200
<v Speaker 2>It puts a whole bunch of people out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>business</v>

2090
01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:08.420
<v Speaker 1>and a whole bunch of other people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>business and any law you pass doesn't go</v>

2091
01:26:08.421 --> 01:26:12.650
<v Speaker 1>away in this country and you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because a whole cottage industry grows</v>

2092
01:26:12.651 --> 01:26:14.900
<v Speaker 1>up around that law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>

2093
01:26:15.010 --> 01:26:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about that many times.</v>

2094
01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Especially when it comes to drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a reason why people are</v>

2095
01:26:19.611 --> 01:26:23.690
<v Speaker 1>still trying to keep marijuana illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have more than 50 percent of the</v>

2096
01:26:23.691 --> 01:26:27.800
<v Speaker 1>people in prison today in this country</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in prison for nonviolent drug</v>

2097
01:26:27.801 --> 01:26:32.090
<v Speaker 1>offenses and there are a tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of private prisons in this</v>

2098
01:26:32.091 --> 01:26:33.120
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're on pain.</v>

2099
01:26:33.170 --> 01:26:36.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a business and we have to wrap our</v>
<v Speaker 1>heads around the fact that there's some</v>

2100
01:26:36.741 --> 01:26:40.130
<v Speaker 1>sort of a creepy situations happen where</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of money and keeping</v>

2101
01:26:40.131 --> 01:26:43.550
<v Speaker 1>people in jail and because of that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are make no doubt about it.</v>

2102
01:26:43.730 --> 01:26:46.440
<v Speaker 1>The prison guard unions and all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2103
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:49.730
<v Speaker 1>various law enforcement unions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not lobbying to keep marijuana</v>

2104
01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:51.440
<v Speaker 1>to make marijuana legal.</v>

2105
01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.470
<v Speaker 1>They don't want it at all because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of their economy.</v>

2106
01:26:54.471 --> 01:26:56.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a part of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their whole system situation that this</v>

2107
01:26:56.991 --> 01:27:01.090
<v Speaker 1>is what happens in life is know a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have a vested interest.</v>

2108
01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:03.650
<v Speaker 1>That's why being a politician or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>president and that the old saying,</v>

2109
01:27:03.651 --> 01:27:05.000
<v Speaker 1>when you're a president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make,</v>

2110
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:06.770
<v Speaker 1>you make one decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2111
01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:08.750
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make 50 percent of the people happy.</v>

2112
01:27:08.751 --> 01:27:11.240
<v Speaker 1>And then another 58 percent of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there hate your guts.</v>

2113
01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:13.490
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way to avoid that when you</v>

2114
01:27:13.491 --> 01:27:17.360
<v Speaker 1>have power tenure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tenure for a teacher is almost.</v>

2115
01:27:17.361 --> 01:27:20.120
<v Speaker 1>It's has some of the elements of</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual,</v>

2116
01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:24.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welfare in a great way to put it in</v>

2117
01:27:24.411 --> 01:27:27.650
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean in that it sounds</v>

2118
01:27:27.651 --> 01:27:29.770
<v Speaker 1>like a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what you're gonna do is you're</v>

2119
01:27:29.771 --> 01:27:33.560
<v Speaker 1>gonna make it so you can't get fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you are allowed to be free with your</v>

2120
01:27:33.561 --> 01:27:36.290
<v Speaker 1>ideas and you don't have to worry about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the repercussions of your,</v>

2121
01:27:36.291 --> 01:27:37.220
<v Speaker 1>of your free thinking.</v>

2122
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:40.880
<v Speaker 1>And this is gonna promote thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with that is when you</v>

2123
01:27:40.881 --> 01:27:43.130
<v Speaker 1>know that you can't get fired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become a client.</v>

2124
01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:45.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's just what people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's natural.</v>

2125
01:27:45.291 --> 01:27:46.124
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2126
01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:48.050
<v Speaker 1>I was doing standup and I think it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kansas city.</v>

2127
01:27:48.051 --> 01:27:49.670
<v Speaker 1>I talked to a principal that came to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

2128
01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:52.040
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me your take on the education</v>

2129
01:27:52.041 --> 01:27:52.671
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

2130
01:27:52.671 --> 01:27:54.020
<v Speaker 1>education system's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2131
01:27:54.021 --> 01:27:54.800
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2132
01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.150
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my school is amazing,</v>

2133
01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:58.190
<v Speaker 1>but you know what the problem is</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>

2134
01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:01.280
<v Speaker 1>a lot of parents suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They suck.</v>

2135
01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:04.850
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of it is this culture that</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't put a premium on education and a</v>

2136
01:28:04.851 --> 01:28:07.250
<v Speaker 1>lot of places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you gotta work your</v>

2137
01:28:07.251 --> 01:28:10.610
<v Speaker 1>fucking ass off against insurmountable</v>
<v Speaker 1>odds for anything.</v>

2138
01:28:10.611 --> 01:28:11.480
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2139
01:28:11.481 --> 01:28:14.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well kids in where we live with an even</v>

2140
01:28:14.481 --> 01:28:17.420
<v Speaker 1>trickier element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this fucking weird escape clause</v>

2141
01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:20.990
<v Speaker 1>where you can become famous for nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you get millions.</v>

2142
01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:25.370
<v Speaker 1>And so instead of working your ass off</v>
<v Speaker 1>for almost nothing after taxes,</v>

2143
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:29.840
<v Speaker 1>you look at kim kardashian who just fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody and makes a video of it.</v>

2144
01:28:29.841 --> 01:28:32.090
<v Speaker 1>And then gets a tv show where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow her around,</v>

2145
01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.220
<v Speaker 1>she does nothing to contribute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's not saying anything,</v>

2146
01:28:34.221 --> 01:28:36.290
<v Speaker 1>but yet she's making millions of dollars</v>
<v Speaker 1>and good for her.</v>

2147
01:28:36.291 --> 01:28:37.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hating on her good for her,</v>

2148
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:40.880
<v Speaker 1>but to kids that all of a sudden becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>this goal,</v>

2149
01:28:40.881 --> 01:28:45.260
<v Speaker 1>this weird fucking weird like clause in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the contract.</v>

2150
01:28:45.261 --> 01:28:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Since we're little escape clause and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few people find it and they,</v>

2151
01:28:49.231 --> 01:28:51.740
<v Speaker 1>they get through the system and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden look at this person making</v>

2152
01:28:51.741 --> 01:28:54.050
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim kardashians made something like</v>

2153
01:28:54.051 --> 01:28:56.720
<v Speaker 1>$60,000,000 last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking insane.</v>

2154
01:28:57.010 --> 01:28:58.220
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2155
01:28:58.310 --> 01:29:00.110
<v Speaker 1>She's an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I go to the fucking airport</v>

2156
01:29:00.111 --> 01:29:02.160
<v Speaker 1>and I throw my keys in the bin,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You made a mistake or face all puffy.</v>

2171
01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:36.630
<v Speaker 2>Looking like a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman was like right after she had a</v>

01:29:39.690 --> 01:29:42.990
<v Speaker 2>I worked with her on how I met your</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother and she wouldn't give a fuck</v>

2175
01:29:42.991 --> 01:29:43.824
<v Speaker 2>where you work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She looked.</v>

2176
01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:44.520
<v Speaker 2>LIsten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pal.</v>

2177
01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:49.520
<v Speaker 2>This tossed girls had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to start like this girl is a blast.</v>

2178
01:29:49.610 --> 01:29:51.630
<v Speaker 2>Exert who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Without a doubt.</v>

2179
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:53.130
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever man.</v>

2180
01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:54.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's your business,</v>

2181
01:29:54.331 --> 01:29:56.040
<v Speaker 2>your business is staying hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

2182
01:29:56.041 --> 01:29:58.020
<v Speaker 2>What you gotta do what you gotta do like</v>
<v Speaker 2>26,</v>

2183
01:29:58.021 --> 01:29:58.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's fine.</v>

2184
01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:00.510
<v Speaker 2>She's delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me see like that.</v>

2185
01:30:05.790 --> 01:30:07.120
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're looking for the photos here.</v>

2186
01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:09.030
<v Speaker 2>We'll uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll find them and I'll show them to</v>

2187
01:30:09.031 --> 01:30:10.620
<v Speaker 2>you later because this is going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain in the ass.</v>

2188
01:30:11.250 --> 01:30:14.610
<v Speaker 2>But what my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I have both talked about this</v>

2189
01:30:14.611 --> 01:30:16.530
<v Speaker 2>and I did get out of here for a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>while,</v>

2190
01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:20.100
<v Speaker 2>but moving to somewhere where that's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>an influence.</v>

2191
01:30:20.670 --> 01:30:24.510
<v Speaker 2>Is that even possible anymore though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that influence is sort of like</v>

2192
01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:26.520
<v Speaker 2>all over the country now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2193
01:30:26.521 --> 01:30:27.180
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2194
01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:28.740
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think though,</v>

2195
01:30:28.741 --> 01:30:31.320
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still gonna have a lot of people</v>

2196
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:35.430
<v Speaker 2>who hold on to what's important because</v>
<v Speaker 2>life is basically a kick in the nuts and</v>

2197
01:30:35.431 --> 01:30:37.050
<v Speaker 2>it's going to teach you that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2198
01:30:37.051 --> 01:30:39.330
<v Speaker 2>you still got to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've still got to fight gravity.</v>

2199
01:30:39.331 --> 01:30:41.880
<v Speaker 2>You still got to find fulfillment and</v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplishment.</v>

2200
01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:45.480
<v Speaker 2>And the only way to accomplish something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a black belt in jujitsu is fucking</v>

2201
01:30:45.481 --> 01:30:48.870
<v Speaker 2>roll all the time for four or five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six or seven or 10 years.</v>

2202
01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:50.940
<v Speaker 2>If you want a black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it takes.</v>

2203
01:30:50.941 --> 01:30:53.960
<v Speaker 2>If you want to know that you truly are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know somebody that can tie somebody</v>

2204
01:30:53.970 --> 01:30:56.400
<v Speaker 2>in a knot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm speaking metaphorically in</v>

2205
01:30:56.401 --> 01:30:58.410
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a long fucking time.</v>

2206
01:30:58.411 --> 01:31:00.060
<v Speaker 2>You want to be a Good stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to be.</v>

2207
01:31:00.061 --> 01:31:01.500
<v Speaker 2>You want to make people laugh all over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country.</v>

2208
01:31:01.501 --> 01:31:04.690
<v Speaker 2>I'll see in 10 years minimum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in a way,</v>

2209
01:31:05.170 --> 01:31:08.880
<v Speaker 2>if you're lucky in a way life is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to life kind of sorts itself out so</v>

2210
01:31:08.881 --> 01:31:11.280
<v Speaker 2>people worry about I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's always been,</v>

2211
01:31:11.281 --> 01:31:12.660
<v Speaker 2>well these people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2212
01:31:12.661 --> 01:31:14.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know of any story in the world</v>

2213
01:31:14.551 --> 01:31:15.830
<v Speaker 2>or any leader in the world.</v>

2214
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:19.770
<v Speaker 2>It didn't complain that his followers</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the most part were retards and,</v>

2215
01:31:19.771 --> 01:31:20.604
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2216
01:31:20.770 --> 01:31:22.680
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to change and get people to understand</v>

2217
01:31:22.681 --> 01:31:26.010
<v Speaker 2>what's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what every religious leader of,</v>

2218
01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:28.920
<v Speaker 2>from from christ on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for moses,</v>

2219
01:31:28.921 --> 01:31:30.380
<v Speaker 2>for god's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>5,000 years ago,</v>

2220
01:31:30.450 --> 01:31:33.900
<v Speaker 2>why my people don't know what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>important here are the commandments.</v>

2221
01:31:33.901 --> 01:31:34.890
<v Speaker 2>You pagans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2222
01:31:34.891 --> 01:31:38.240
<v Speaker 2>it's always been that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always been people who are older</v>

2223
01:31:38.250 --> 01:31:40.680
<v Speaker 2>always been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking kids are partying too much.</v>

2224
01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:42.480
<v Speaker 2>Stop with all the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the drinking,</v>

2225
01:31:42.481 --> 01:31:43.670
<v Speaker 2>the booze and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2226
01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:44.790
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the drugs.</v>

2227
01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:46.740
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2228
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.390
<v Speaker 2>if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get struck down by</v>

2229
01:31:48.391 --> 01:31:50.400
<v Speaker 2>lightning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the I'm going to scare the shit out</v>

2230
01:31:50.401 --> 01:31:51.450
<v Speaker 2>of you for your own good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2231
01:31:51.451 --> 01:31:54.210
<v Speaker 2>And ultimately all of these things are</v>
<v Speaker 2>in place so that we can have this</v>

2232
01:31:54.211 --> 01:31:57.930
<v Speaker 2>society so that people can survive so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people can keep breeding so we can</v>

2233
01:31:57.931 --> 01:31:59.710
<v Speaker 2>continue doing what doing,</v>

2234
01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:02.470
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of centers around</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

2235
01:32:03.210 --> 01:32:04.660
<v Speaker 1>social animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've alwaYs,</v>

2236
01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:07.600
<v Speaker 1>we've always had a war with nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

2237
01:32:07.601 --> 01:32:11.140
<v Speaker 1>That's kinda like what we're the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal that has a symbiotic relationship</v>

2238
01:32:11.141 --> 01:32:14.050
<v Speaker 1>with an artificial life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that artificial life is technology.</v>

2239
01:32:14.051 --> 01:32:16.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say technology is not alive,</v>

2240
01:32:16.570 --> 01:32:20.410
<v Speaker 1>but I mean we use the word evolution to</v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally earlier use the word</v>

2241
01:32:20.411 --> 01:32:24.160
<v Speaker 1>evolution for machines and if you look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at simple machines that were around,</v>

2242
01:32:24.161 --> 01:32:24.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50,</v>

2243
01:32:24.671 --> 01:32:28.990
<v Speaker 1>60 years ago and you look at the complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>machines now with the microchips that</v>

2244
01:32:28.991 --> 01:32:31.750
<v Speaker 1>are powering your fucking cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're where this is all headed in</v>

2245
01:32:31.751 --> 01:32:36.010
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a weird direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are inexorably connected to this</v>

2246
01:32:36.011 --> 01:32:39.850
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't inexorably inexorably connected</v>

2247
01:32:39.851 --> 01:32:44.851
<v Speaker 1>to this technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inevitably in our society is connected</v>

2248
01:32:45.071 --> 01:32:46.450
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this was what the unabomber was</v>

2249
01:32:46.451 --> 01:32:49.540
<v Speaker 1>terrified about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is when he took his manifesto.</v>

2250
01:32:50.410 --> 01:32:53.800
<v Speaker 1>Technology will get to a point where it</v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer has a respect for its</v>

2251
01:32:53.801 --> 01:32:56.430
<v Speaker 1>biological heritage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People can say it's not a live forum.</v>

2252
01:32:56.431 --> 01:32:57.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not a life form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

2253
01:32:57.671 --> 01:32:58.510
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

2254
01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:00.600
<v Speaker 1>There's no blood in it and there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>tissues cells,</v>

2255
01:33:00.610 --> 01:33:03.320
<v Speaker 1>but what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that's growing in a va.</v>

2256
01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:05.940
<v Speaker 1>You can say that it's not a life form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is it?</v>

2257
01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:08.830
<v Speaker 1>A fucking human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A human being iS some sort of a weird</v>

2258
01:33:08.831 --> 01:33:11.560
<v Speaker 1>biological computer that's riddled with</v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria.</v>

2259
01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:14.620
<v Speaker 1>That's what we that with synthetic dna</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming up with.</v>

2260
01:33:14.621 --> 01:33:16.960
<v Speaker 1>We're not just living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're coming up with living.</v>

2261
01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:19.840
<v Speaker 1>We're coming up with manmade bacteria</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

2262
01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:22.210
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of those conversations that</v>

2263
01:33:22.211 --> 01:33:25.210
<v Speaker 1>inevitably when whenever we have this</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of conversation on the message,</v>

2264
01:33:25.211 --> 01:33:27.740
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my message board,</v>

2265
01:33:27.741 --> 01:33:30.940
<v Speaker 1>someone will come up and go this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit stoned hippy talk.</v>

2266
01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:35.200
<v Speaker 1>It's always some aggro fuckhead with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor argument and they get upset about</v>

2267
01:33:35.201 --> 01:33:37.510
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the the bottom line is with all this</v>

2268
01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:38.820
<v Speaker 1>hippie talk is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2269
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:40.390
<v Speaker 1>everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you thinking about that?</v>

2270
01:33:40.391 --> 01:33:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Why are you thinking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2271
01:33:41.441 --> 01:33:43.210
<v Speaker 1>where's it all going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just all going,</v>

2272
01:33:43.211 --> 01:33:44.200
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going nowhere.</v>

2273
01:33:44.201 --> 01:33:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Shut up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to work.</v>

2274
01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:49.120
<v Speaker 1>The reality is that something is</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and for whatever reason we</v>

2275
01:33:49.121 --> 01:33:51.700
<v Speaker 1>have an instinct to ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not hippy talk anyway.</v>

2276
01:33:51.701 --> 01:33:52.990
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think a tippy talk,</v>

2277
01:33:53.230 --> 01:33:56.020
<v Speaker 1>take a look at what computer scientists</v>
<v Speaker 1>are talking about.</v>

2278
01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Computer scientists and scientists in</v>
<v Speaker 1>general are talking about evolution in,</v>

2279
01:34:01.401 --> 01:34:06.401
<v Speaker 1>in terms of human beings can control and</v>
<v Speaker 1>are controlling their own evolution,</v>

2280
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:11.440
<v Speaker 1>so it's not hippy talk at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fAct it's called hard scientific</v>

2281
01:34:11.441 --> 01:34:12.980
<v Speaker 1>talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is cold outside dog,</v>

2282
01:34:13.210 --> 01:34:15.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's also still radical theoretic.</v>

2283
01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:17.570
<v Speaker 1>It's also stoner talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the kind of things but the.</v>

2284
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:22.510
<v Speaker 1>That's why we did so awesome you fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as we started talking in 20 years,</v>

2285
01:34:22.810 --> 01:34:26.300
<v Speaker 1>we are going to like it or not have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>contend with tech,</v>

2286
01:34:26.530 --> 01:34:30.970
<v Speaker 1>technological advances that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are so far beyond what most of us</v>

2287
01:34:30.971 --> 01:34:34.300
<v Speaker 1>are dealing with today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Biocompatible technology,</v>

2288
01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:37.250
<v Speaker 1>things that fit into your body that make</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember fast.</v>

2289
01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Keep you awake longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Placement parts.</v>

2290
01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Heinz bionic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2291
01:34:40.991 --> 01:34:41.824
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2292
01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:42.671
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2293
01:34:42.671 --> 01:34:46.930
<v Speaker 1>so these are realities that are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>affect how you make a living,</v>

2294
01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:50.020
<v Speaker 1>what you talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you listened to,</v>

2295
01:34:50.021 --> 01:34:53.770
<v Speaker 1>what your children are influenced by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anybody who thinks they can stay out</v>

2296
01:34:53.771 --> 01:34:57.650
<v Speaker 1>of this debate or even this discussion</v>
<v Speaker 1>is kitten themselves.</v>

2297
01:34:57.651 --> 01:34:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kidding yourself.</v>

2298
01:34:58.970 --> 01:35:03.290
<v Speaker 1>He does have an air of silliness to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got an air of man.</v>

2299
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:05.890
<v Speaker 1>You know there's something to it when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're considering,</v>

2300
01:35:06.090 --> 01:35:06.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2301
01:35:06.681 --> 01:35:10.700
<v Speaker 1>these really fantastical possibilities</v>
<v Speaker 1>and probabilities of the exponential</v>

2302
01:35:10.701 --> 01:35:11.690
<v Speaker 1>growth of technology.</v>

2303
01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:14.040
<v Speaker 1>It does have this sort of silliness to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2304
01:35:14.041 --> 01:35:17.420
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of where we're spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation comes in with the notion</v>

2305
01:35:17.421 --> 01:35:20.000
<v Speaker 1>that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have all these technical logical</v>

2306
01:35:20.001 --> 01:35:22.250
<v Speaker 1>advances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the same old questions that a human</v>

2307
01:35:22.251 --> 01:35:26.600
<v Speaker 1>being's going to have to answer for</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself are still gonna exist sort of</v>

2308
01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:27.553
<v Speaker 1>one way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2309
01:35:27.690 --> 01:35:31.130
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it's there for the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why when your dick is hard,</v>

2310
01:35:31.190 --> 01:35:33.140
<v Speaker 1>you don't even think about putting a</v>
<v Speaker 1>condom on.</v>

2311
01:35:33.141 --> 01:35:34.870
<v Speaker 1>you just stick it in there because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because yeah,</v>

2312
01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:36.090
<v Speaker 1>just whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just getting up,</v>

2313
01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:37.250
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a kid.</v>

2314
01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:39.650
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like it's designed that way</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our,</v>

2315
01:35:39.850 --> 01:35:41.600
<v Speaker 1>our mass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2316
01:35:41.601 --> 01:35:43.220
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the huge percentage of the population is</v>

2317
01:35:43.221 --> 01:35:47.330
<v Speaker 1>not thinking about the eventual upcoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>technological singularity.</v>

2318
01:35:47.331 --> 01:35:48.510
<v Speaker 1>TheY're just not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2319
01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:49.880
<v Speaker 1>and if you bring it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2320
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:51.740
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2321
01:35:51.741 --> 01:35:52.101
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2322
01:35:52.101 --> 01:35:54.290
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wonder if that's there for the</v>

2323
01:35:54.291 --> 01:35:54.890
<v Speaker 1>same reason.</v>

2324
01:35:54.890 --> 01:35:58.820
<v Speaker 1>It's the same sort of an instinct that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes the hard dick stick it in without</v>

2325
01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:02.030
<v Speaker 1>a condom to make sure it happens anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this crazy instincts.</v>

2326
01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just don't come and tell me.</v>

2327
01:36:04.671 --> 01:36:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2328
01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:06.420
<v Speaker 1>well shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2329
01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:08.980
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like it's engineered into</v>

2330
01:36:09.190 --> 01:36:11.350
<v Speaker 1>reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you start talking about if it's</v>

2331
01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:12.650
<v Speaker 1>a guy gets up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2332
01:36:12.651 --> 01:36:14.570
<v Speaker 1>climate change and sea levels are</v>
<v Speaker 1>rising.</v>

2333
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:16.490
<v Speaker 1>You talked to me about that talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to me.</v>

2334
01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:18.410
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's too big to think about and I</v>

2335
01:36:18.411 --> 01:36:20.180
<v Speaker 1>don't have any way to cool the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

2336
01:36:20.181 --> 01:36:21.490
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to change the channel right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2337
01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:24.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm walking away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you talked to dopey republicans</v>

2338
01:36:24.381 --> 01:36:26.570
<v Speaker 1>about all will only tell you something</v>
<v Speaker 1>about these liberals.</v>

2339
01:36:26.571 --> 01:36:29.060
<v Speaker 1>He's liberals in their climate control</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2340
01:36:29.070 --> 01:36:30.950
<v Speaker 1>they been going on and on about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate control.</v>

2341
01:36:30.951 --> 01:36:32.060
<v Speaker 1>There's what we know ladies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gentleman,</v>

2342
01:36:32.061 --> 01:36:34.460
<v Speaker 1>we know that the climate has changed</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the beginning of time.</v>

2343
01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:35.990
<v Speaker 1>It's cyclical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

2344
01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Don't get in the way of big business and</v>
<v Speaker 1>big industry.</v>

2345
01:36:39.231 --> 01:36:41.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's a reason why the United</v>

2346
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:42.231
<v Speaker 1>States of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing show.</v>

2347
01:36:42.231 --> 01:36:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason why you need this</v>

2348
01:36:43.431 --> 01:36:45.300
<v Speaker 1>economy to turn around and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal,</v>

2349
01:36:45.301 --> 01:36:48.620
<v Speaker 1>so it's not a god damn sitting around</v>
<v Speaker 1>with tambourines and a circle around a</v>

2350
01:36:48.621 --> 01:36:50.570
<v Speaker 1>campfire singing grateful dead songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

2351
01:36:50.630 --> 01:36:51.201
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2352
01:36:51.201 --> 01:36:53.120
<v Speaker 1>we'll be right back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean,</v>

2353
01:36:53.330 --> 01:36:56.090
<v Speaker 1>and you get into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's read that right wing rhetoric</v>

2354
01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:57.580
<v Speaker 1>idea that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2355
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:59.150
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god got settled down.</v>

2356
01:36:59.151 --> 01:37:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Hippies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what it is.</v>

2357
01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:02.030
<v Speaker 1>It allows things to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it also,</v>

2358
01:37:02.031 --> 01:37:05.570
<v Speaker 1>it also stops the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It allows you to stick your dick in</v>

2359
01:37:05.571 --> 01:37:10.040
<v Speaker 1>without a condom because you're silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did the instincts are to fuck things up.</v>

2360
01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:13.580
<v Speaker 1>The instincts are to make more people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The instincts are to continue the</v>

2361
01:37:13.581 --> 01:37:16.220
<v Speaker 1>technological progress regardless of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what fucking effect.</v>

2362
01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:19.640
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is human history is one.</v>

2363
01:37:19.641 --> 01:37:23.510
<v Speaker 1>The one constant in human history is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people were never able to see</v>

2364
01:37:23.511 --> 01:37:26.000
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe as a group through world war</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

2365
01:37:26.001 --> 01:37:28.760
<v Speaker 1>world war ii famines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the black plague.</v>

2366
01:37:28.761 --> 01:37:32.660
<v Speaker 1>It never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are not good at predicting major</v>

2367
01:37:32.661 --> 01:37:36.860
<v Speaker 1>fucking issues and events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a tsunami all due respect</v>

2368
01:37:36.861 --> 01:37:39.010
<v Speaker 1>to the people in Japan or anything like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2369
01:37:39.011 --> 01:37:42.200
<v Speaker 1>We'll eventually not good at doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2370
01:37:42.201 --> 01:37:44.990
<v Speaker 1>we haven't gotten a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be and say,</v>

2371
01:37:44.991 --> 01:37:45.950
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2372
01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:48.170
<v Speaker 1>there's an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a 20 percent likelihood that a</v>

2373
01:37:48.171 --> 01:37:52.130
<v Speaker 1>huge earthquakes about to hit and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next week that I'm sure we'll get better</v>

2374
01:37:52.131 --> 01:37:55.470
<v Speaker 1>at doing stuff that we will use to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you didn't know a tornado was</v>

2375
01:37:55.471 --> 01:37:57.420
<v Speaker 1>coming until it killed you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea.</v>

2376
01:37:57.421 --> 01:37:59.670
<v Speaker 1>you had to see it go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

2377
01:37:59.671 --> 01:38:00.600
<v Speaker 1>In 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>

2378
01:38:00.610 --> 01:38:03.180
<v Speaker 1>300 plus people in Alabama and our</v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

2379
01:38:03.181 --> 01:38:05.670
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing they can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing they could do about</v>

2380
01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:06.553
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2381
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen the the destruction</v>
<v Speaker 1>photos online?</v>

2382
01:38:10.050 --> 01:38:12.870
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted them there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're insane to tuscaloosa.</v>

2383
01:38:12.871 --> 01:38:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Alabama was literally wiped off them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never experienced in any way a</v>

2384
01:38:17.370 --> 01:38:19.950
<v Speaker 1>nature's force like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That must be so crazy.</v>

2385
01:38:19.951 --> 01:38:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2386
01:38:20.821 --> 01:38:22.740
<v Speaker 1>and the crazy thing is it happens every</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

2387
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.410
<v Speaker 1>There was something like 400 fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>tornadoes this year.</v>

2388
01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:29.190
<v Speaker 1>We were in a house and it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets ripped apart and you're in the</v>

2389
01:38:29.191 --> 01:38:30.150
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2390
01:38:30.151 --> 01:38:32.250
<v Speaker 1>you know when there's a rainstorm and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear thunder,</v>

2391
01:38:32.251 --> 01:38:32.731
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

2392
01:38:32.731 --> 01:38:35.670
<v Speaker 1>let's cut it off in front of the tv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my reality,</v>

2393
01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:38.140
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would fucking mood.</v>

2394
01:38:38.490 --> 01:38:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been in a hurricane?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2395
01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:42.510
<v Speaker 1>I've been in a hurricane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the hurricanes that hit the east</v>

2396
01:38:42.511 --> 01:38:45.510
<v Speaker 1>coast up in the boston area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time they got up there,</v>

2397
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not so much.</v>

2398
01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Not that big a deal when you're in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in when you're in the middle,</v>

2399
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:52.200
<v Speaker 1>when it starts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're in the fact that whatever</v>

2400
01:38:52.201 --> 01:38:53.580
<v Speaker 1>they call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eye of the storm,</v>

2401
01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:54.930
<v Speaker 1>that's not the start.</v>

2402
01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:57.570
<v Speaker 1>The start is the eye is the center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you fuck up and you go,</v>

2403
01:38:57.571 --> 01:39:00.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's over and you step outside the air</v>

2404
01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:06.380
<v Speaker 1>force guys who fly into that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit to test all the kinds of nutty</v>

2405
01:39:06.490 --> 01:39:10.170
<v Speaker 1>there in the middle of a fucking insane</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that because any other plane comes</v>

2406
01:39:10.171 --> 01:39:11.550
<v Speaker 1>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other plant comes apart,</v>

2407
01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:13.830
<v Speaker 1>they come apart and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a pilot,</v>

2408
01:39:14.130 --> 01:39:17.010
<v Speaker 1>my dad was a pilot for 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're a pilot,</v>

2409
01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:21.810
<v Speaker 1>you fuck and worry about thunderstorms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's thunderstorms that is death,</v>

2410
01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:24.300
<v Speaker 1>you don't scare a thunderstorm and scary</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2411
01:39:24.330 --> 01:39:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter if you're a seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>47 or less.</v>

2412
01:39:26.010 --> 01:39:28.170
<v Speaker 1>guys just fly right into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fly.</v>

2413
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we make all planes out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same shit they make those other plans</v>

2414
01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:36.380
<v Speaker 1>because you can only have two or three</v>
<v Speaker 1>passengers and to make it awesome would</v>

2415
01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:37.330
<v Speaker 1>be if you were in a plane.</v>

2416
01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:40.620
<v Speaker 1>He knew it couldn't break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>this coin is never going to crash.</v>

2417
01:39:40.621 --> 01:39:42.720
<v Speaker 1>It flies in a fucking hurricanes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2418
01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:44.820
<v Speaker 1>It's made out of the black box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard,</v>

2419
01:39:44.850 --> 01:39:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I heard the craziest stupid old hack j.</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's.</v>

2420
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I heard that the craziest hippy a theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>lately.</v>

2421
01:39:50.401 --> 01:39:53.970
<v Speaker 1>I read somewhere today that if you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a birthmark that's where you were</v>

2422
01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:57.090
<v Speaker 1>murdered in a past life or killed in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>past life.</v>

2423
01:39:57.110 --> 01:39:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Is this from a girl that you're trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bang?</v>

2424
01:39:58.730 --> 01:40:01.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read it on facebook or something.</v>

2425
01:40:02.290 --> 01:40:04.350
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have been stabbed in the back of</v>

2426
01:40:04.351 --> 01:40:07.110
<v Speaker 1>the head and the interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have brain damage people always.</v>

2427
01:40:08.130 --> 01:40:12.330
<v Speaker 1>That's why you good experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what about fucking redheads or</v>

2428
01:40:12.331 --> 01:40:13.190
<v Speaker 1>stabbed everywhere?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Shot to the body.</v>

2431
01:40:16.330 --> 01:40:19.260
<v Speaker 1>When you and I were talking about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you blew up the internet.</v>

01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Is that when you can get facts right</v>

<v Speaker 1>Before that,</v>

2434
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:26.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all just would just start saying shit</v>

2435
01:40:26.130 --> 01:40:27.600
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start saying anything.</v>

2436
01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I know and this is the truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being,</v>

<v Speaker 1>The last time you Were here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was one.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the people to protect the people.</v>

2446
01:40:50.071 --> 01:40:54.070

<v Speaker 3>vaginas that are under age and you're</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck was that all about?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like he knew that he was just shaking</v>

2532
01:44:03.951 --> 01:44:08.550
<v Speaker 3>his head was so weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>

2533
01:44:08.590 --> 01:44:10.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walked into starbucks and now now that</v>

<v Speaker 3>at me.</v>

2535
01:44:12.681 --> 01:44:14.000
<v Speaker 3>But it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right when I walked in and was like,</v>

2536
01:44:14.001 --> 01:44:15.350
<v Speaker 3>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the weirdest.</v>

2537
01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:18.860
<v Speaker 3>I was super high when all this</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous conversation or you should</v>

2538
01:44:18.861 --> 01:44:20.870
<v Speaker 3>have started off this conversation by</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

2539
01:44:20.871 --> 01:44:22.690
<v Speaker 3>oh hi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were because you're like alan,</v>

2540
01:44:22.691 --> 01:44:24.130
<v Speaker 3>all those staring at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

2541
01:44:24.510 --> 01:44:26.990
<v Speaker 3>and that was like really freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck kind of a</v>

2542
01:44:26.991 --> 01:44:29.750
<v Speaker 3>conversation that we have in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>

2543
01:44:30.380 --> 01:44:32.690
<v Speaker 3>What kind of story is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what happened to me yesterday.</v>

2544
01:44:32.691 --> 01:44:34.340
<v Speaker 3>We left out the most important part.</v>

2545
01:44:34.930 --> 01:44:36.880
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the reasons why pot</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be illegal.</v>

2546
01:44:36.881 --> 01:44:38.850
<v Speaker 1>NoW I'm on the other side of the fence</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we are,</v>

2547
01:44:38.890 --> 01:44:40.540
<v Speaker 1>but here's what I don't believe right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2548
01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I don't believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in psychics.</v>

2549
01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:48.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that corporations like</v>
<v Speaker 1>bp have anything to do with like are</v>

2550
01:44:48.431 --> 01:44:50.720
<v Speaker 1>able to pull off murderers or any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that state</v>

2551
01:44:52.410 --> 01:44:56.760
<v Speaker 1>or murder or based on oil and all wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much how loud?</v>

2552
01:44:56.780 --> 01:45:00.430
<v Speaker 1>It was tough in brisbane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't based based on oil necessarily</v>

2553
01:45:00.431 --> 01:45:03.820
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actual outlet because you left it on all</v>

2554
01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:05.200
<v Speaker 1>week and it's going to blow the fuck up.</v>

2555
01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Go war made the oil more expensive and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of ways.</v>

2556
01:45:10.091 --> 01:45:12.250
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know why because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>making more money.</v>

2557
01:45:12.251 --> 01:45:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Those cons you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not the ones that nine slash</v>

2558
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:19.600
<v Speaker 1>11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that how things work you?</v>

2559
01:45:19.610 --> 01:45:22.210
<v Speaker 1>You say that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how can you say that with any level</v>

2560
01:45:22.211 --> 01:45:23.320
<v Speaker 1>of certainty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

2561
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:25.170
<v Speaker 1>I can say it with a lot of level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainty.</v>

2562
01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:29.620
<v Speaker 1>The same way I can tell people camper</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations are working when there's so</v>

2563
01:45:29.621 --> 01:45:31.810
<v Speaker 1>many instances of corporations killing</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2564
01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:33.910
<v Speaker 1>they all have different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all have different agendas is all</v>

2565
01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:35.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying like if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a bank,</v>

2566
01:45:35.410 --> 01:45:37.900
<v Speaker 1>you have a different agenda and watch a</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie and you're competing against</v>

2567
01:45:37.901 --> 01:45:42.901
<v Speaker 1>another bank and there's a movie where</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone is trying to make money and</v>

2568
01:45:43.181 --> 01:45:46.840
<v Speaker 1>something goes wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they hire a hitman and jason</v>

2569
01:45:46.841 --> 01:45:48.430
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2570
01:45:48.431 --> 01:45:49.390
<v Speaker 1>Based on what?</v>

2571
01:45:49.420 --> 01:45:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Based on human fucking nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know it's possible.</v>

2572
01:45:52.001 --> 01:45:55.120
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about super powers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about someone having</v>

2573
01:45:55.121 --> 01:45:57.340
<v Speaker 1>someone killed because it would cost</v>
<v Speaker 1>them billions and billions.</v>

2574
01:45:57.830 --> 01:46:00.310
<v Speaker 1>We don't think it's possible boardroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have a problem wIth this</v>

2575
01:46:00.311 --> 01:46:04.150
<v Speaker 1>bp story is it has all the elements of</v>
<v Speaker 1>an internet hoax.</v>

2576
01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:05.073
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

2577
01:46:05.090 --> 01:46:08.170
<v Speaker 1>it's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's it's unresearched bubble and I'm</v>

2578
01:46:08.171 --> 01:46:11.740
<v Speaker 1>trying to research it and it keeps</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me that all those investigative</v>

<v Speaker 1>newspapers are always looking for a</v>

2580
01:46:14.261 --> 01:46:15.460

2610
01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Fourth marijuana conviction gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>slidell.</v>

2611
01:47:27.331 --> 01:47:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Louisiana may have life in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a repeat offender.</v>

2612
01:47:32.010 --> 01:47:34.290
<v Speaker 1>And by this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a refeed burpee defender,</v>

2613
01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:38.010
<v Speaker 1>the jury found defendant guilty of</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to possess and distribute</v>

2614
01:47:38.011 --> 01:47:41.370
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude was selling weed and they put them</v>

2615
01:47:41.371 --> 01:47:43.920
<v Speaker 1>in jail for life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for life.</v>

2616
01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:46.560
<v Speaker 1>And he's 35 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

2617
01:47:46.561 --> 01:47:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tragedy.</v>

2618
01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:51.090
<v Speaker 1>It's the only way pot kills you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two ways.</v>

2619
01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:51.621
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

2620
01:47:51.621 --> 01:47:53.190
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the all four times the same</v>

2621
01:47:53.191 --> 01:47:54.080
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2622
01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:55.560
<v Speaker 1>it sounds weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2623
01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:59.040
<v Speaker 1>That guy deserves to be in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking after the second or third</v>

2624
01:47:59.041 --> 01:47:59.641
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2625
01:47:59.641 --> 01:48:01.210
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking start funding like in a</v>

2626
01:48:01.211 --> 01:48:03.130
<v Speaker 1>different job for selling weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2627
01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:04.370
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2628
01:48:04.371 --> 01:48:05.820
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the law is unjust.</v>

2629
01:48:05.970 --> 01:48:08.660
<v Speaker 1>It's unjust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Retard is.</v>

2630
01:48:08.670 --> 01:48:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely had the brightest guy in the</v>

2631
01:48:10.591 --> 01:48:11.580
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what he's doing,</v>

2632
01:48:11.581 --> 01:48:14.670
<v Speaker 1>he's not hurting anyone or do we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>too many fucking laws?</v>

2633
01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:16.320
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel bad for him because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not yo,</v>

2634
01:48:16.321 --> 01:48:16.970
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2635
01:48:16.970 --> 01:48:20.710
<v Speaker 1>it easily could be one strike anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

2636
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:23.190
<v Speaker 1>If you have for duis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you deserve to be fucking.</v>

2637
01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:26.670
<v Speaker 1>You're just a fucking retard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this guy is selling for duis are</v>

2638
01:48:26.671 --> 01:48:28.140
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hurting people.</v>

2639
01:48:28.141 --> 01:48:30.450
<v Speaker 1>You're scaring me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter this brian that</v>

2640
01:48:30.690 --> 01:48:31.523
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It matters.</v>

2641
01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.420
<v Speaker 1>It matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also matters like this guy's been</v>

2642
01:48:33.421 --> 01:48:35.340
<v Speaker 1>in trouble three times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two times.</v>

2643
01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>

2644
01:48:37.650 --> 01:48:40.230
<v Speaker 1>but your giving in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're giving into the man.</v>

2645
01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:42.480
<v Speaker 1>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying whatever law rules that</v>

2646
01:48:42.481 --> 01:48:44.820
<v Speaker 1>you make is illogical as they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fall back on because I</v>

2647
01:48:44.821 --> 01:48:48.240
<v Speaker 1>don't want to get locked in a cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is there's no way you</v>

2648
01:48:48.241 --> 01:48:49.980
<v Speaker 1>should be locking someone in a cage for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2649
01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:52.140
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if someone does that,</v>

2650
01:48:52.290 --> 01:48:54.750
<v Speaker 1>they're the criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have a society,</v>

2651
01:48:54.751 --> 01:48:58.920
<v Speaker 1>a complex society with a massive amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of access to information and literally</v>

2652
01:48:58.921 --> 01:49:01.320
<v Speaker 1>you can find the answers to any question</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly on your phone.</v>

2653
01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:04.830
<v Speaker 1>When you have a law that's in place</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's completely illogical,</v>

2654
01:49:04.831 --> 01:49:07.980
<v Speaker 1>like marijuana laws and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>prosecute people for them and then you</v>

2655
01:49:07.981 --> 01:49:10.830
<v Speaker 1>lock them in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are the criminal.</v>

2656
01:49:10.831 --> 01:49:15.060
<v Speaker 1>You are the one who's going against</v>
<v Speaker 1>logic and nature with all your fucking</v>

2657
01:49:15.061 --> 01:49:19.890
<v Speaker 1>silly studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ron paul just own some motherfucker the</v>

2658
01:49:19.891 --> 01:49:23.160
<v Speaker 1>other day on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the senate floor and it was.</v>

2659
01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:27.110
<v Speaker 1>The guy Was talking about marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he thought heroin should be</v>

2660
01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:29.460
<v Speaker 1>legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ron paul,</v>

2661
01:49:29.461 --> 01:49:32.100
<v Speaker 1>just clown them about personal use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of use,</v>

2662
01:49:32.101 --> 01:49:35.880
<v Speaker 1>and if heroin was legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think we'd all be using heroin?</v>

2663
01:49:36.250 --> 01:49:37.500
<v Speaker 1>We just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was so.</v>

2664
01:49:37.590 --> 01:49:39.930
<v Speaker 1>It was so on the money man about all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2665
01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:43.890
<v Speaker 1>We need less fucking laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you people out there that are</v>

2666
01:49:43.891 --> 01:49:47.030
<v Speaker 1>involved in this industry of laws and</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry of,</v>

2667
01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:50.170
<v Speaker 1>of creating jobs that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are attached to laws.</v>

2668
01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Your leeches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your this is leeching off society.</v>

2669
01:49:53.681 --> 01:49:56.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking loophole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we got rid of that loophole and</v>

2670
01:49:56.291 --> 01:50:00.610
<v Speaker 1>forced everybody that has some shitbag</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs for locking people up for pot,</v>

2671
01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:03.820
<v Speaker 1>we would force those people to have more</v>
<v Speaker 1>productive lives because they would have</v>

2672
01:50:03.821 --> 01:50:05.800
<v Speaker 1>to evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you would have to contribute.</v>

2673
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:08.650
<v Speaker 1>I think that more than any other time in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our country's history,</v>

2674
01:50:08.651 --> 01:50:09.230
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2675
01:50:09.230 --> 01:50:12.490
<v Speaker 1>the discussion about legalizing drugs is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much alive.</v>

2676
01:50:12.491 --> 01:50:17.160
<v Speaker 1>And even polIticians like ron paul who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a growing following are,</v>

2677
01:50:17.161 --> 01:50:22.161
<v Speaker 1>are being taken very serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly evolve fast enough drugs not fast</v>

2678
01:50:22.451 --> 01:50:23.920
<v Speaker 1>enough or logic or my taste.</v>

2679
01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:26.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not not changing enough in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime.</v>

2680
01:50:26.081 --> 01:50:27.550
<v Speaker 1>It is changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

2681
01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:31.030
<v Speaker 1>the climate here in California</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially is really revolutionary.</v>

2682
01:50:31.031 --> 01:50:32.830
<v Speaker 1>If you drive down the street near my</v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

2683
01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:36.300
<v Speaker 1>there's fucking five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd stores in a one block radius ratio</v>

2684
01:50:36.650 --> 01:50:37.483
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2685
01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:40.510
<v Speaker 1>it's really data that is incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not changed enough.</v>

2686
01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:45.310
<v Speaker 1>There's still plenty of fucking morons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>silly ideas about forcing people into</v>

2687
01:50:45.311 --> 01:50:48.640
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a reason why the United States</v>

2688
01:50:48.641 --> 01:50:51.600
<v Speaker 1>is not competing with the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world as far as things we produce.</v>

2689
01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:53.740
<v Speaker 1>It's because a lot of people aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>producing shit.</v>

2690
01:50:54.010 --> 01:50:56.830
<v Speaker 1>They're just a part of some weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking system,</v>

2691
01:50:56.980 --> 01:51:00.220
<v Speaker 1>some weird system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very weird system that doesn't</v>

2692
01:51:00.221 --> 01:51:03.250
<v Speaker 1>necessarily make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our financial system doesn't necessarily</v>

2693
01:51:03.251 --> 01:51:04.020
<v Speaker 1>make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our,</v>

2694
01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:04.670
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our are,</v>

2695
01:51:04.670 --> 01:51:05.321
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>

2696
01:51:05.321 --> 01:51:07.120
<v Speaker 1>we don't really produce anythIng.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2697
01:51:07.121 --> 01:51:10.330
<v Speaker 1>putin said it best when he was analyzing</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States economy before the crash.</v>

2698
01:51:10.630 --> 01:51:12.700
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the american economy.</v>

2699
01:51:12.701 --> 01:51:15.280
<v Speaker 1>All they seem to be doing is buying and</v>
<v Speaker 1>selling each other's houses.</v>

2700
01:51:15.970 --> 01:51:18.250
<v Speaker 1>And he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck else do we do anymore?</v>

2701
01:51:18.370 --> 01:51:21.730
<v Speaker 1>We make mustangs and camaro's and</v>
<v Speaker 1>corvettes and a couple other things.</v>

2702
01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:23.770
<v Speaker 1>We have a comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very powerful.</v>

2703
01:51:23.850 --> 01:51:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>military.</v>

2704
01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:25.451
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2705
01:51:25.451 --> 01:51:25.770
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2706
01:51:25.770 --> 01:51:26.603
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2707
01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:29.290
<v Speaker 1>comPuter industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we do that innovation,</v>

2708
01:51:29.291 --> 01:51:31.930
<v Speaker 1>art in medical innovation and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2709
01:51:31.931 --> 01:51:34.480
<v Speaker 1>We got a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be argued though,</v>

2710
01:51:34.481 --> 01:51:37.930
<v Speaker 1>that if there were less laws and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were more freedom and there was less</v>

2711
01:51:37.931 --> 01:51:41.590
<v Speaker 1>people in these fucking bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 1>parasitic government jobs that those</v>

2712
01:51:41.591 --> 01:51:44.850
<v Speaker 1>people would be forced to contribute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they would become cabinet makers.</v>

2713
01:51:44.890 --> 01:51:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great argument.</v>

2714
01:51:46.451 --> 01:51:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they'd become authors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There would be.</v>

2715
01:51:48.450 --> 01:51:51.790
<v Speaker 1>They would contribute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a form of social welfare to have</v>

2716
01:51:51.791 --> 01:51:53.580
<v Speaker 1>shit jobs that aren't necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>

2717
01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:56.530
<v Speaker 1>There was a great article in the wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>street journal about how a lot of</v>

2718
01:51:56.531 --> 01:51:58.720
<v Speaker 1>states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three out of one job,</v>

2719
01:51:58.721 --> 01:52:01.390
<v Speaker 1>our government jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not not private sector jobs,</v>

2720
01:52:01.540 --> 01:52:04.060
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you hear like the government</v>

2721
01:52:04.061 --> 01:52:07.530
<v Speaker 1>created new jobs and you know what a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those jobs are surveyors,</v>

2722
01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:11.710
<v Speaker 1>weird fucking government exemptions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are unnecessary and build anything</v>

2723
01:52:11.711 --> 01:52:15.730
<v Speaker 1>that's not what made this country great</v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucrats and you're absolutely right</v>

2724
01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:19.030
<v Speaker 1>and it is a form of social welfare</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you give someone a job and</v>

2725
01:52:19.031 --> 01:52:20.800
<v Speaker 1>make it so they don't have to find their</v>
<v Speaker 1>path.</v>

2726
01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:23.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like I've always said that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest thing that ever happened to me</v>

2727
01:52:23.081 --> 01:52:25.420
<v Speaker 1>when I was 21 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played the lottery once.</v>

2728
01:52:25.630 --> 01:52:27.880
<v Speaker 1>I won a free ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I played it again.</v>

2729
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:29.950
<v Speaker 1>I want nothing and then I was done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2730
01:52:29.951 --> 01:52:30.880
<v Speaker 1>I quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2731
01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:34.660
<v Speaker 1>What if I was 21 and broke and scared</v>
<v Speaker 1>and lost and I won the lottery.</v>

2732
01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:36.280
<v Speaker 1>That would have been the worst curse</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

2733
01:52:36.430 --> 01:52:39.670
<v Speaker 1>I would have never found my way in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you get some shitty fucking easy</v>

2734
01:52:39.671 --> 01:52:42.880
<v Speaker 1>government job you can't get fired from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that becomes your life.</v>

2735
01:52:42.881 --> 01:52:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Well guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to find your place</v>

2736
01:52:44.561 --> 01:52:45.350
<v Speaker 1>either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2737
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:47.870
<v Speaker 1>You're just going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a form almost of social welfare.</v>

2738
01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:51.090
<v Speaker 1>We need less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less of everything.</v>

2739
01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:53.630
<v Speaker 1>That's where I got like ron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul's on the fucking money,</v>

2740
01:52:53.631 --> 01:52:55.880
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That ain't that bad motherfucker.</v>

2741
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:56.751
<v Speaker 1>That guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2742
01:52:56.751 --> 01:52:58.190
<v Speaker 1>he's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other guy,</v>

2743
01:52:58.191 --> 01:53:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Gary Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the former governor of New Mexico,</v>

2744
01:53:00.081 --> 01:53:02.210
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just stand up at a great point.</v>

2745
01:53:02.211 --> 01:53:03.044
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like him.</v>

2746
01:53:03.050 --> 01:53:04.850
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same sense less jesus,</v>

2747
01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:08.090
<v Speaker 1>but I don't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind ron paul's diseases.</v>

2748
01:53:08.330 --> 01:53:10.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind any of it because the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>he talks is the way,</v>

2749
01:53:11.230 --> 01:53:14.750
<v Speaker 1>which in my mind is America when my mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

2750
01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:15.860
<v Speaker 1>here's the deal.</v>

2751
01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:20.920
<v Speaker 1>He believes in personal freedom and</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and allowing people to</v>

2752
01:53:21.111 --> 01:53:25.130
<v Speaker 1>make their own choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes the call on what is really</v>

2753
01:53:25.131 --> 01:53:28.280
<v Speaker 1>going on and why we're invested in all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these different parts of the world and</v>

2754
01:53:28.281 --> 01:53:30.470
<v Speaker 1>what we're really doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's honest about it and he was saying,</v>

2755
01:53:30.471 --> 01:53:32.570
<v Speaker 1>this is not what America should be all</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

2756
01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:35.660
<v Speaker 1>and he says that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not what this constitution was</v>

2757
01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:37.670
<v Speaker 1>supposed to mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not what our founding fathers</v>

2758
01:53:37.671 --> 01:53:40.160
<v Speaker 1>wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the way this is supposed to be.</v>

2759
01:53:40.161 --> 01:53:44.570
<v Speaker 1>The best example possible of what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do with this society.</v>

2760
01:53:44.571 --> 01:53:46.610
<v Speaker 1>This is 2011.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've learned from the greeks.</v>

2761
01:53:46.611 --> 01:53:48.740
<v Speaker 1>We learned from the romans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we learned from the nazis.</v>

2762
01:53:48.741 --> 01:53:50.690
<v Speaker 1>We learned from everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got it down,</v>

2763
01:53:50.810 --> 01:53:53.180
<v Speaker 1>but we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't and we don't and it's</v>

2764
01:53:53.181 --> 01:53:55.610
<v Speaker 1>transparent how we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all there.</v>

2765
01:53:55.670 --> 01:53:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Every time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the obama recently pass on fucking</v>

2766
01:53:58.551 --> 01:54:02.450
<v Speaker 1>new law about genetically modified food</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to fuck over all these</v>

2767
01:54:02.451 --> 01:54:03.380
<v Speaker 1>organic farmers.</v>

2768
01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:05.860
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shit's been going on for awhile.</v>

2769
01:54:05.870 --> 01:54:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Monsanto's involved in a lot of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>creepy shit,</v>

2770
01:54:08.451 --> 01:54:10.400
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the government has been behind all</v>

2771
01:54:10.401 --> 01:54:12.560
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good book though about about that</v>

2772
01:54:12.630 --> 01:54:15.390
<v Speaker 1>and we're again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about technology and</v>

2773
01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:17.990
<v Speaker 1>monsanto and these other companies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>do genetic engineering,</v>

2774
01:54:18.230 --> 01:54:21.410
<v Speaker 1>the only way we're going to feed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing population is through genetic</v>

2775
01:54:21.411 --> 01:54:22.100
<v Speaker 1>injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

2776
01:54:22.100 --> 01:54:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a way to do It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bad way to do it.</v>

2777
01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it comes with risks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also comes with a great deal of</v>

2778
01:54:27.531 --> 01:54:30.920
<v Speaker 1>promise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but genetic engineering is in all of</v>

2779
01:54:30.921 --> 01:54:32.960
<v Speaker 1>your future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you like it or not.</v>

2780
01:54:33.190 --> 01:54:37.820
<v Speaker 1>The real problem has toiled to farm</v>
<v Speaker 1>organically and feed all the people in</v>

2781
01:54:37.821 --> 01:54:38.750
<v Speaker 1>africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2782
01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:40.550
<v Speaker 1>etc. Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2783
01:54:40.551 --> 01:54:42.890
<v Speaker 1>But isn't the real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is sustainability,</v>

2784
01:54:42.891 --> 01:54:45.710
<v Speaker 1>but the real problem is also that you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to own that.</v>

2785
01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:48.710
<v Speaker 1>You own a plant and monsanto is</v>
<v Speaker 1>inherently.</v>

2786
01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:50.090
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to,</v>

2787
01:54:50.210 --> 01:54:51.760
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tried to patent pigs.</v>

2788
01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:54.080
<v Speaker 1>Do you know it's going to be a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and they're going to figure this</v>

2789
01:54:54.081 --> 01:54:56.030
<v Speaker 1>out in the courts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the bottom line is this.</v>

2790
01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:00.440
<v Speaker 1>One thing that none of the promises of</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic engineering is that we will</v>

2791
01:55:00.441 --> 01:55:04.550
<v Speaker 1>maybe never have to use any pesticides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to talk about</v>

2792
01:55:04.551 --> 01:55:06.920
<v Speaker 1>agricultural runoff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the biggest forms of</v>

2793
01:55:06.921 --> 01:55:10.370
<v Speaker 1>pollutants and all our waterways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

2794
01:55:10.371 --> 01:55:12.860
<v Speaker 1>if you could come up with a kernel of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rice,</v>

2795
01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:17.580
<v Speaker 1>an apple that requires no spring because</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it it has genes that are not only</v>

2796
01:55:17.590 --> 01:55:20.000
<v Speaker 1>incredibly nutritious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that can ward off any kind of a</v>

2797
01:55:20.001 --> 01:55:22.280
<v Speaker 1>pest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something that is going to be in</v>

2798
01:55:22.281 --> 01:55:24.680
<v Speaker 1>our future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't come with risks is are there</v>

2799
01:55:24.681 --> 01:55:25.570
<v Speaker 1>problems are.</v>

2800
01:55:25.570 --> 01:55:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel weird about taking the,</v>

2801
01:55:27.390 --> 01:55:30.710
<v Speaker 1>the gene of a jellyfish and putting it</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a strawberry because it actually</v>

2802
01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:32.900
<v Speaker 1>keeps it from freezing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can ship it farther.</v>

2803
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2804
01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:36.320
<v Speaker 1>This is where adam corolla would come</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

2805
01:55:36.530 --> 01:55:40.940
<v Speaker 1>What we got here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be great in about 10</v>

2806
01:55:40.941 --> 01:55:42.710
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2807
01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:45.750
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to get in on the ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>floor.</v>

2808
01:55:45.751 --> 01:55:48.870
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to get in here with all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this genetic engineering.</v>

2809
01:55:49.470 --> 01:55:52.230
<v Speaker 1>You want to wait?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see if that's what he would do.</v>

2810
01:55:52.350 --> 01:55:53.011
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2811
01:55:53.011 --> 01:55:56.520
<v Speaker 1>we told them that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you said too about the improV.</v>

2812
01:55:56.580 --> 01:56:00.300
<v Speaker 1>He actually repeated it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repeated it to us and said that he was</v>

2813
01:56:00.301 --> 01:56:02.850
<v Speaker 1>the happiest he'd ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you made him so happy.</v>

2814
01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:04.380
<v Speaker 1>And I concurred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2815
01:56:04.381 --> 01:56:05.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought it up.</v>

2816
01:56:05.401 --> 01:56:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brian cowen said this,</v>

2817
01:56:06.511 --> 01:56:07.560
<v Speaker 1>and I think he's absolutely right.</v>

2818
01:56:07.770 --> 01:56:12.770
<v Speaker 1>He's the best at tying together as long</v>
<v Speaker 1>rants and making them work.</v>

2819
01:56:12.810 --> 01:56:14.220
<v Speaker 1>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I listened to him,</v>

2820
01:56:14.221 --> 01:56:17.820
<v Speaker 1>I can get him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could start doing my act and he's got</v>

2821
01:56:17.821 --> 01:56:18.800
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a uh,</v>

2822
01:56:18.810 --> 01:56:19.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those things.</v>

2823
01:56:19.891 --> 01:56:20.990
<v Speaker 1>I think it was that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2824
01:56:21.210 --> 01:56:23.610
<v Speaker 1>he's that smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kind of norm macdonald's and he's an</v>

2825
01:56:23.611 --> 01:56:24.540
<v Speaker 1>interesting guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2826
01:56:24.541 --> 01:56:25.630
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked him.</v>

2827
01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very smart.</v>

2828
01:56:27.041 --> 01:56:29.490
<v Speaker 1>He's very smart and in a very unique and</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting way.</v>

2829
01:56:29.530 --> 01:56:31.200
<v Speaker 1>My buddy box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very honest.</v>

2830
01:56:31.230 --> 01:56:33.000
<v Speaker 1>He's got heavy hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

2831
01:56:33.001 --> 01:56:33.781
<v Speaker 1>I really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2832
01:56:33.781 --> 01:56:35.760
<v Speaker 1>he's a good boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the movie the hammer?</v>

2833
01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:38.070
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about him being a boxer.</v>

2834
01:56:38.110 --> 01:56:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he's in the ring and he's,</v>

2835
01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:43.260
<v Speaker 1>he's apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a boxing trainer for a long time</v>

2836
01:56:43.261 --> 01:56:44.760

<v Speaker 1>unusual thinker and a,</v>

2840
01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:52.960
<v Speaker 1>and an unabashed gearhead.</v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2842
01:56:55.070 --> 01:56:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I hate when people pretend like I've run</v>
<v Speaker 1>on some guy's thing,</v>

2843
01:56:59.310 --> 01:57:03.510
<v Speaker 1>shitting on someone for being middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>aged and buying a sports car that it was</v>

2844
01:57:03.810 --> 01:57:06.750
<v Speaker 1>such a midlife crisis sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a silly way to look at that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fun of anybody who's a gearhead because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a passion.</v>

2848
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:17.310
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be in anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational and logical about it.</v>

2849
01:57:17.311 --> 01:57:19.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a passion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some people are born with the</v>

2850
01:57:19.621 --> 01:57:24.090
<v Speaker 1>wrenching gene at the random forest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrenching jane.</v>

2851
01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:26.670

<v Speaker 1>I'd rather have somebody else to do.</v>

01:57:34.531 --> 01:57:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a technology fanatic.</v>

2857
01:57:36.811 --> 01:57:39.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm obsessed with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always been obsessed with any new</v>

2858
01:57:39.901 --> 01:57:42.570
<v Speaker 1>gadget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time I saw pong I</v>

2859
01:57:42.571 --> 01:57:44.430
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was obsessed with it.</v>

2860
01:57:44.431 --> 01:57:46.950
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe that soMeone had</v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out a way to make this move.</v>

2861
01:57:46.951 --> 01:57:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Something on the tv was one of the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>people I ever met who had email and</v>

2862
01:57:51.061 --> 01:57:52.410
<v Speaker 1>stuff like I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>computer in [inaudible] 94 and I didn't</v>

2864
01:57:55.501 --> 01:57:59.180
<v Speaker 1>send an email to anybody until like 98.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody had fucking email though.</v>

2865
01:57:59.470 --> 01:58:01.950
<v Speaker 1>I never got it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hardly ever talked to any of my friend</v>

2866
01:58:01.970 --> 01:58:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Amy Patton oswald and I've been going</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and forth on twitter.</v>

2867
01:58:04.890 --> 01:58:06.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm supposed to call them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

2868
01:58:06.181 --> 01:58:10.740
<v Speaker 1>can I actually have to call somebody and</v>
<v Speaker 1>make her go back and forth to talk about</v>

2869
01:58:10.741 --> 01:58:14.800
<v Speaker 1>a funny dude I love his writing was one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my favorite guys as far as like</v>

2870
01:58:15.090 --> 01:58:18.810
<v Speaker 1>taking a premise and this beaten the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit out of it and he's going into all</v>

2871
01:58:18.811 --> 01:58:20.040
<v Speaker 1>sorts of weird ways with it.</v>

2872
01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:21.810
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a really interesting guy.</v>

2873
01:58:21.811 --> 01:58:23.820
<v Speaker 1>I liked him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a writer on mad tv when I.</v>

2874
01:58:24.230 --> 01:58:26.520
<v Speaker 1>When I first started this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really was a part of the original</v>

2875
01:58:26.521 --> 01:58:29.310
<v Speaker 1>cast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was there and I enjoy his cds.</v>

2876
01:58:29.311 --> 01:58:33.720
<v Speaker 1>I think he's my favorite guy to listen</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you and have sketch ideas on the wall</v>

2877
01:58:34.020 --> 01:58:38.580
<v Speaker 1>and one was one was just explosive</v>
<v Speaker 1>diarrhea and then the other was feeling</v>

2878
01:58:38.581 --> 01:58:39.540
<v Speaker 1>kind of rapey.</v>

2879
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:42.850
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2880
01:58:42.850 --> 01:58:45.790
<v Speaker 1>when we were doing mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man show that was one of the most</v>

2881
01:58:45.791 --> 01:58:50.770
<v Speaker 1>fun things is to put a pump a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and try to make some duty that I</v>

2882
01:58:50.771 --> 01:58:52.060
<v Speaker 1>do that with my writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you do that?</v>

2883
01:58:52.061 --> 01:58:54.320
<v Speaker 1>see I have a board up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do that with my,</v>

2884
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:58.450
<v Speaker 1>my act now and I take a photo of it on</v>
<v Speaker 1>my iphone and then when I'm in a hotel</v>

2885
01:58:58.451 --> 01:59:01.540
<v Speaker 1>room and I want to go over my notes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just look at the photo and you could</v>

2886
01:59:01.541 --> 01:59:04.420
<v Speaker 1>get expanded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I move it around and iT's easier than</v>

2887
01:59:04.421 --> 01:59:07.360
<v Speaker 1>turning pages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's technology man.</v>

2888
01:59:07.630 --> 01:59:09.410
<v Speaker 1>It's making it all easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2889
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:12.960
<v Speaker 1>I think writing something down and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting it up there for you.</v>

2890
01:59:13.030 --> 01:59:16.420
<v Speaker 1>There's something about creating when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you write things down and then put it</v>

2891
01:59:16.421 --> 01:59:19.570
<v Speaker 1>into like a little box and then stick</v>
<v Speaker 1>the box in the wall and step back and</v>

2892
01:59:19.571 --> 01:59:22.630
<v Speaker 1>look at it as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of like being on top of it,</v>

2893
01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:25.740
<v Speaker 1>writing it and being immersed in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>words to sit,</v>

2894
01:59:25.750 --> 01:59:28.190
<v Speaker 1>put it on the wall and step back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

2895
01:59:28.290 --> 01:59:31.020
<v Speaker 2>really successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Screenplay writer I've ever spoken to</v>

2896
01:59:31.350 --> 01:59:34.250
<v Speaker 2>does exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really sIt down and write real,</v>

2897
01:59:34.510 --> 01:59:38.700
<v Speaker 2>real wow from Alan Ball who I talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wrote american beauty,</v>

2898
01:59:38.701 --> 01:59:42.930
<v Speaker 2>who I talked to about how he starts his</v>
<v Speaker 2>scripts and stuff and he said character,</v>

2899
01:59:42.931 --> 01:59:44.820
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but any of those guys,</v>

2900
01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:46.380
<v Speaker 2>all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>todd phillips,</v>

2901
01:59:46.620 --> 01:59:49.650
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they outlined the shit out of it.</v>

2902
01:59:49.651 --> 01:59:51.240
<v Speaker 2>They see it up on a board and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2903
01:59:51.241 --> 01:59:54.860
<v Speaker 2>one director or one right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or certainly not one screenplay writer.</v>

2904
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:57.050
<v Speaker 2>Not one who makes it fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2905
01:59:57.060 --> 01:59:58.710
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a successful screenplay writer,</v>

2906
01:59:58.711 --> 02:00:01.620
<v Speaker 2>a professional who doesn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just started doing it recently.</v>

2907
02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:03.990
<v Speaker 2>I've been writing forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the way to do it.</v>

2908
02:00:03.991 --> 02:00:06.390
<v Speaker 2>That's why a lot of people write a</v>
<v Speaker 2>screenplay and then they just end up</v>

2909
02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:08.730
<v Speaker 2>running out of steam or it doesn't quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

2910
02:00:09.450 --> 02:00:13.640
<v Speaker 2>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a real sort of structure and</v>

2911
02:00:13.690 --> 02:00:15.750
<v Speaker 2>technique to writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>

2912
02:00:15.751 --> 02:00:18.330
<v Speaker 2>even novelists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>novelist will lay it out,</v>

2913
02:00:18.331 --> 02:00:20.670
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean john irving for his last book,</v>

2914
02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:23.310
<v Speaker 2>took seven years to write that book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven,</v>

2915
02:00:23.311 --> 02:00:26.970
<v Speaker 2>think about the act of faith that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>require because it had to be thematic.</v>

2916
02:00:27.090 --> 02:00:29.040
<v Speaker 2>He created these characters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very autobiography,</v>

2917
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:34.350
<v Speaker 2>a book a year in the mystic river,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a one year in the scripture,</v>

2918
02:00:34.710 --> 02:00:36.650
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it about a.</v>

2919
02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:39.460
<v Speaker 2>It's very autobiographical about silicon</v>
<v Speaker 2>goc.</v>

2920
02:00:39.630 --> 02:00:40.980
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>john irving is that.</v>

2921
02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:41.873
<v Speaker 2>Not everything is.</v>

2922
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:45.720
<v Speaker 1>It took them seven years and it's always</v>
<v Speaker 1>about blown dudes by the river.</v>

2923
02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Black cod</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns this in.</v>

2924
02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:51.860
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you read.</v>

2925
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Have you read any of his books?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2926
02:00:53.250 --> 02:00:54.910
<v Speaker 1>No dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you haven't read genre.</v>

2927
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.711
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude?</v>

2928
02:00:55.711 --> 02:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>I kind of stopped reading fiction a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time ago.</v>

2929
02:00:57.601 --> 02:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>I started reading some Joe Hill</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>

2930
02:00:59.390 --> 02:01:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I stopped leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kingsborough.</v>

2931
02:01:00.970 --> 02:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started.</v>

2932
02:01:01.710 --> 02:01:04.710
<v Speaker 1>I started reading it again because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun and I realized I was reading too</v>

2933
02:01:04.711 --> 02:01:06.720
<v Speaker 1>much creepy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was almost like what I was talking.</v>

2934
02:01:06.721 --> 02:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to writing a whole bit about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in my act now about the apocalypse is</v>

2935
02:01:10.681 --> 02:01:11.514
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2936
02:01:11.550 --> 02:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>it's here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not here.</v>

2937
02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what I said earlier,</v>

2938
02:01:14.671 --> 02:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>the way I phrase it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the first time I ever phrased it</v>

2939
02:01:16.291 --> 02:01:17.310
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's here in the sunnier,</v>

2940
02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:21.330
<v Speaker 1>but I'm writing this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole big chunk about that and so</v>

2941
02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:22.470
<v Speaker 1>it's forcing me.</v>

2942
02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm constantly reading all this nutty</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking shit about the world and I'm</v>

2943
02:01:26.251 --> 02:01:26.971
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god damn it.</v>

2944
02:01:26.971 --> 02:01:28.790
<v Speaker 1>This is not that fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can.</v>

2945
02:01:28.791 --> 02:01:32.020
<v Speaker 1>You can freak out about fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>supermassive black holes and super</v>

2946
02:01:32.021 --> 02:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>volcanoes and you could freak out about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shifting of the polar ice caps and</v>

2947
02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.250
<v Speaker 1>it really doesn't make life any more</v>
