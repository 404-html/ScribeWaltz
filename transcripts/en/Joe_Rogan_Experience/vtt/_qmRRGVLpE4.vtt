00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches</v>

2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.981
<v Speaker 1>time I ever met.</v>

3
00:00:05.981 --> 00:00:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Alex said that weekend didn't,</v>

4
00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:08.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:09.910
<v Speaker 1>that's the only time you've ever heard that in Waco.</v>

6
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.751
<v Speaker 1>Waco first.</v>

7
00:00:10.751 --> 00:00:12.370
<v Speaker 1>And then that I lost touch with him after that.</v>

8
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.930
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

9
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:13.880
<v Speaker 1>he really couldn't,</v>

10
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.570
<v Speaker 1>he liked me again actually after I wrote the minister go.</v>

11
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like he didn't like me after I wrote my book them,</v>

12
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.540
<v Speaker 1>which includes all this stuff about being sneaking into Bohemian Grove cause he</v>

13
00:00:22.541 --> 00:00:24.970
<v Speaker 1>thought I was too much of a debunker of Bohemian Grove.</v>

14
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.800
<v Speaker 1>But then when I wrote the metastatic goats,</v>

15
00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:29.110
<v Speaker 1>he liked me again because he felt that I was like,</v>

16
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:29.771
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

17
00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:30.760
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like a bit of a,</v>

18
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:31.311
<v Speaker 1>the minister.</v>

19
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:31.581
<v Speaker 1>It goes,</v>

20
00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:33.520
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like a conspiracy book in a way.</v>

21
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.141
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

23
00:00:35.141 --> 00:00:35.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.060
<v Speaker 1>how much different is it than the,</v>

25
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.560
<v Speaker 1>should we keep going with this Bohemian Grove?</v>

26
00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

27
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

28
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.110
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

29
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.943
<v Speaker 1>There's more to say.</v>

30
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

31
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.550
<v Speaker 1>so Alex and Mike decided to go in via the undergrowth.</v>

32
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:46.331
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

33
00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:47.320

00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

35
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.000
<v Speaker 1>so they went in through the bushes.</v>

36
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.830
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't see the bushes and there was a lot of poison oak.</v>

37
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:53.740
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be at all.</v>

38
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.340

48
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I've missed out of this story was it was the night before we were going to</v>

83
00:02:09.101 --> 00:02:09.341
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

84
00:02:09.341 --> 00:02:09.781

86
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>He'd gone through on the east coast,</v>

87
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:13.830
<v Speaker 1>he'd lock the bathroom from the</v>

88
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.120
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

89
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.080
<v Speaker 1>You say you liked the batteries from the outside of the east coast when you</v>

90
00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:21.580
<v Speaker 1>leave a bar at night,</v>

91
00:02:21.581 --> 00:02:22.414
<v Speaker 1>when they close up,</v>

92
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.320
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

93
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.680
<v Speaker 1>They locked the bathroom and then they put like a a lock bolts or if you break</v>

94
00:02:26.681 --> 00:02:27.250
<v Speaker 1>in they can't.</v>

95
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 1>He would go in the bathroom.</v>

96
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Johnny read like 11 o'clock in the morning,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the P and we locked them in there.</v>

98
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.130
<v Speaker 1>We leave them in there until like six o'clock at night.</v>

99
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.960
<v Speaker 1>We come back to have a drink.</v>

100
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.450
<v Speaker 1>We'd opened the bathroom and he'd come out like nothing.</v>

101
00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:39.010
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God like nothing happened.</v>

102
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.750
<v Speaker 1>He was hilarious.</v>

103
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean one day I put my Dick on a chair next to him.</v>

104
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.610
<v Speaker 1>He was sending out of Boston,</v>

105
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.981
<v Speaker 1>my friends,</v>

106
00:02:47.981 --> 00:02:48.151
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

107
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:48.984
<v Speaker 1>which it,</v>

108
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.890
<v Speaker 1>see what happens and he's like,</v>

109
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:51.491
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

110
00:02:51.491 --> 00:02:56.110
<v Speaker 1>And he just got up Johnny relived like maybe 12 years ago.</v>

111
00:02:56.111 --> 00:02:59.020
<v Speaker 1>We used to give him bumps a coke and get them riled up at the,</v>

112
00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.981
<v Speaker 1>and they just leave.</v>

113
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you motherfuckers.</v>

114
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>I'll fight all of this that he just fucking leave.</v>

115
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

116
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Irish Jew a Jew.</v>

117
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 1>You ever have a girl you dated to kill herself?</v>

118
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:09.683
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

119
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:10.783
<v Speaker 1>they should've</v>

120
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 1>put that fucking helmet.</v>

121
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Grad Committee.</v>

122
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Your fucking Dick.</v>

123
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

124
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 1>kill yourself the first time.</v>

125
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>And when you get to your destination,</v>

126
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 2>well for police it's even worse because we're perpetuating that situation.</v>

127
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 2>So work,</v>

128
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 2>we're the ones doing that cycle.</v>

129
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 2>So when we see a 61 time I was a shift commander in the eastern district and I'm</v>

130
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 2>telling my guys,</v>

131
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 2>stop pulling over old white ladies.</v>

132
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Stop pulling over that young cute girl.</v>

133
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.113
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>

134
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 2>We focus on who committed the crimes and who commit the crimes in Baltimore,</v>

135
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 2>16 to 24 year old black males.</v>

136
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 2>That's who's committing the crimes.</v>

137
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.130
<v Speaker 2>So focus on them.</v>

138
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.730
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense until you complete the cycle and realize that you started doing</v>

139
00:03:57.431 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 2>that because of institutionalized racism in your organization.</v>

140
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 2>And so when you are jacking up those guys on the corner and you do find that</v>

141
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 2>dime bag,</v>

142
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 2>so you sent him to jail.</v>

143
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 2>Now he can't go to work the next day.</v>

144
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:11.290
<v Speaker 2>So he loses his job and then he can't make it to court.</v>

145
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.640
<v Speaker 2>So he gets his license suspended and then he's driving and then you are focusing</v>

146
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.100
<v Speaker 2>on those 16 to 24 black males.</v>

147
00:04:17.101 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 2>So now you're more likely to pull them over.</v>

148
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.200
<v Speaker 2>Now you pull him over.</v>

149
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:21.400
<v Speaker 2>Now he has a suspended license.</v>

150
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 2>Now he gets his license is revoked and now he can't get to the job legally and</v>

151
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

152
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.140
<v Speaker 2>and now,</v>

153
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 2>now he's dealt.</v>

154
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.200
<v Speaker 2>It's left with selling drugs on the corner.</v>

155
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.450
<v Speaker 2>So you were were creating it.</v>

156
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:35.160
<v Speaker 2>We have to step back and realize what the facts are and what we're doing.</v>

157
00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 2>And the number one problem is the drug war.</v>

158
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.770
<v Speaker 2>And then we have money in politics.</v>

159
00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 2>These are our two big issues that we have to solve before we get anywhere.</v>

160
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

161
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.530
<v Speaker 2>what does the money in politics,</v>

162
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:45.364
<v Speaker 2>how's that player?</v>

163
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.640
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think we can change anything until we stopped having politicians that</v>

164
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 2>are serving their donors versus serving the people.</v>

165
00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.730
<v Speaker 2>So somebody that's talking like me is never going to run a police agency as long</v>

166
00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:02.290
<v Speaker 2>as all their corporate donors are saying,</v>

167
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:02.471
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

168
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:02.711
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

169
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:02.891
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

170
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:05.260
<v Speaker 2>You keep those animals and the cages because that's what they do.</v>

171
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:05.411
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

172
00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:08.680
<v Speaker 2>that's a good joke in Baltimore that police are actually the zookeepers.</v>

173
00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:09.610
<v Speaker 2>She keeps everything in it.</v>

174
00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 2>Don't let it hit the county.</v>

175
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.310
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

176
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.961
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

177
00:05:11.961 --> 00:05:12.521
<v Speaker 2>that's our role.</v>

178
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:13.570
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're doing.</v>

179
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.920
<v Speaker 2>So your mayors and your politicians are going to continue to encourage that.</v>

180
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:19.780
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to take a risk and say,</v>

181
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.471
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

182
00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:23.530
<v Speaker 2>how do we lower juvenile possession of marijuana?</v>

183
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.030
<v Speaker 2>You know that I know you do.</v>

184
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.931
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

185
00:05:25.931 --> 00:05:26.764
<v Speaker 2>you legalize it.</v>

186
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

187
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.383
<v Speaker 2>And you control it.</v>

188
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.860
<v Speaker 2>And rates actually go down.</v>

189
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 2>Whether we're overseas or were in Colorado,</v>

190
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 2>your possession rates for marijuana will go down among juveniles.</v>

191
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.120
<v Speaker 2>But we don't do that.</v>

192
00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 2>We keep looking at everything like we're a hammer searching for now and we keep</v>

193
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:43.030
<v Speaker 2>looking for what we're going to hit to stop it.</v>

194
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.870
<v Speaker 2>Instead of standing back and using science and figuring out what are we actually</v>

195
00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:48.670
<v Speaker 2>going to do to fix this problem,</v>

196
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:49.900
<v Speaker 2>what we'll actually have results.</v>

197
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.450
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>

198
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.620
<v Speaker 1>there are behaviors.</v>

199
00:05:51.621 --> 00:05:52.071
<v Speaker 1>This book,</v>

200
00:05:52.071 --> 00:05:53.780
<v Speaker 1>the murderer is so fucking incredible.</v>

201
00:05:53.781 --> 00:05:54.051
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

202
00:05:54.051 --> 00:05:54.651
<v Speaker 1>Richard Walter.</v>

203
00:05:54.651 --> 00:05:59.651
<v Speaker 1>There are behaviors that people like certain guys will rape and kill a woman,</v>

204
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 1>but when they're raping her,</v>

205
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:02.540
<v Speaker 1>if she dies in the process,</v>

206
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:04.970
<v Speaker 1>they'll stop immediately because they don't want the cops that think they're</v>

207
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:05.804
<v Speaker 1>freaks.</v>

208
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 1>All kinds of weird shit.</v>

209
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:08.181
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

210
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:08.301
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

211
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 1>that was the thing about this green river guys and he didn't want them to know</v>

212
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 1>that he fucked them after they were.</v>

213
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:12.920
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

214
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.420
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want to admit it because he had an ego and ego and the guy he,</v>

215
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.271
<v Speaker 1>the way he got them to do it,</v>

216
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:18.104
<v Speaker 1>he was looking at it.</v>

217
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.190
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't be the first guy.</v>

218
00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys who've done that's right.</v>

219
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

220
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.171
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

221
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:21.381
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

222

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

224
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:22.251
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

225
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:22.581
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

226
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:23.091
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>

227
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:23.710
<v Speaker 1>I did do that.</v>

228
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:24.340
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do that.</v>

229
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 1>I do like they used to,</v>

230
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:27.643
<v Speaker 1>they got a guy,</v>

231

234
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.311

241
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.470

242

<v Speaker 1>he became up in a very strict Islamic society.</v>

245
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 1>So they showed them some dick slot as life shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

269
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.380
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't go with fucking great greats in 10th grade.</v>

270
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Might be a little intense and too much of a big word to you.</v>

271
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Be a little hyperbole there.</v>

272
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.510
<v Speaker 1>May never seen one of our parents.</v>

273
00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:26.200
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

274
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You'd never seen her work?</v>

279
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.131
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot.</v>

280
00:07:33.131 --> 00:07:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Did you not do research for that episode?</v>

281
00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
