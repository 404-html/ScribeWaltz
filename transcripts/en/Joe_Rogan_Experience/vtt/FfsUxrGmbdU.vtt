00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:20.670
<v Speaker 1>I was going to do it.</v>

19
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

20
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>I did ketamine,</v>

22
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.730
<v Speaker 1>which I got to say I cannot recommend.</v>

23
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

24
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

25
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 1>I did three.</v>

26
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.671
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

27
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>actually I did six sessions.</v>

28
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

29
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>which was crazy.</v>

30
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.321
<v Speaker 1>Did it.</v>

31
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:39.321
<v Speaker 1>But the side effects long term were my eyes burnt for straight up two to three</v>

32
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:41.360
<v Speaker 1>months every day.</v>

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 1>like I needed drops constantly.</v>

38
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>like irritated.</v>

41
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.963
<v Speaker 1>More like that.</v>

43
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

44
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.950
<v Speaker 1>and I just felt like kind of groggy and out of it for a couple months.</v>

45
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

46
00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.530
<v Speaker 1>Then I did explain,</v>

48
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.990
<v Speaker 1>so ketamine glossier.</v>

49
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

50
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.661
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

51
00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 1>I talked about it last time I was here,</v>

52
00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

53
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>cause I got a lot of talk about you were going to do it or you don't.</v>

54
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.320
<v Speaker 1>It may be I was going to do it.</v>

55
00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:12.210
<v Speaker 1>I think you had done it.</v>

56
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

57
00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>I had done it and I was,</v>

58
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>it was still too early to tell,</v>

59
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>but I remember running into in the hall the comedy store and you were super</v>

60
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:19.351
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>

61
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

62
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.120
<v Speaker 1>The first time I did it,</v>

63
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>the first two sessions were great and then after that I kind of hit a plateau</v>

64
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

65
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

66
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>I just kind of felt like,</v>

67
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>just kinda like groggy for a not kidding,</v>

68
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>like a couple months.</v>

69
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Speaker 1>So the first session you,</v>

70
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>did you get this positive benefit from it?</v>

71
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

72
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:37.740
<v Speaker 1>they point in continuing,</v>

73
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.753
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 1>because the,</v>

75
00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

76
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>the treatment is six sessions.</v>

77
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.463
<v Speaker 1>The protocol,</v>

78
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.723
<v Speaker 1>that's the protocol.</v>

79
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.953
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

80
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

81
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.771
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

82
00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 1>I think I have video of it too.</v>

83
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.923
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

84
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.070
<v Speaker 1>I know I have video witching and you're just in a,</v>

85
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>basically in like a hospital room and uh,</v>

86
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.260
<v Speaker 1>and experience itself you said was full blown psychedelic,</v>

87
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.610
<v Speaker 1>straight up fucking 100% tripping,</v>

88
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.623
<v Speaker 1>tripping balls.</v>

89
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.060
<v Speaker 1>And this is all FDA approved.</v>

90
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

91
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>it's FDA approved as an anesthetic.</v>

92
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

93
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not FDA approved.</v>

94
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I actually know it.</v>

95
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.501
<v Speaker 1>It's getting the,</v>

96
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:17.041
<v Speaker 1>I think it is.</v>

97
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:19.410
<v Speaker 1>They're actually because otherwise wouldn't be able to talk about it.</v>

98
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

99
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

100
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.470
<v Speaker 1>it is approved as an off label,</v>

101
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

102
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.680
<v Speaker 1>depression treatment off labels.</v>

103
00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:26.431
<v Speaker 1>Tricky Shit,</v>

104
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

105
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

106
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Because there's no,</v>

107
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.870
<v Speaker 1>they don't know.</v>

108
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

109
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.711
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

110
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:33.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's all of them in some ways,</v>

111
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.160
<v Speaker 1>especially with antidepressants.</v>

112
00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:35.701
<v Speaker 1>It's all like,</v>

113
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:35.881
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

114
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:36.714
<v Speaker 1>this might,</v>

115
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.370
<v Speaker 1>this might could do something,</v>

116
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.210
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>

117
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>

118
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>There's stuff that they can do to you that is definitely beneficial,</v>

119
00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:44.154
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>

120
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

121
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>your insurance isn't gonna cover it.</v>

122
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.820
<v Speaker 1>If you have the cash,</v>

123
00:02:46.821 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>you can pay for it.</v>

124
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

125
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

126
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.230
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of the situation I was in where it's like nobody was going to pay</v>

127
00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:52.651
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>

128
00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:56.810
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to roll the dice and I rolled the dice and I got to say,</v>

129
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.703
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

130
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>do you think that if the initial treatments that you had,</v>

131
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 1>the first couple that you really had good responses from,</v>

132
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 1>if you just stop there,</v>

133
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 1>you'd have a different opinion of it.</v>

134
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.913
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

135
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing is if I had just done at once,</v>

136
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>it kind of felt like you ever do acid.</v>

137
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

138
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 1>You know that like paying that like super clear feeling.</v>

139
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

140
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 1>That's how I felt the day I saw you.</v>

141
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 1>I did ask him for the first time,</v>

142
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>like I was,</v>

143
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 1>I want to say four months ago.</v>

144
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

145
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Months ago.</v>

146
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

147
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 1>What'd you think?</v>

148
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Loved it.</v>

149
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

150
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 1>You didn't find it too intense?</v>

151
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

152
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

153
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Because it can be speedy as fuck.</v>

154
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm so used to edibles and float tanks.</v>

155
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

156
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>That I think it's,</v>

157
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

158
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting.</v>

159
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>It was very clean,</v>

160
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>like the eye,</v>

161
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 1>the idea behind it,</v>

162
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.041
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

163
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

164
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.491
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

165
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>the feeling behind it,</v>

166
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>the thought process behind it.</v>

167
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

168
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

169
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 1>this is like some mine clarifier.</v>

170
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:48.904
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

171
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:49.140
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

172
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

173
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.841
<v Speaker 1>Bill Hicks,</v>

174
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:51.600
<v Speaker 1>he used to call it a squeegee and your third,</v>

175
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.700
<v Speaker 1>I like mushrooms.</v>

176
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

177
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.213
<v Speaker 1>it felt,</v>

178
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.121
<v Speaker 1>it felt very,</v>

179
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

180
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 1>clarifying if that makes any sense.</v>

181
00:03:58.211 --> 00:03:59.560
<v Speaker 1>But of course it makes total sense.</v>

182
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 1>I felt great.</v>

183
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>I felt really good.</v>

184
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 1>Felt really friendly</v>

185
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 1>during.</v>

186
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

187
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:08.561
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

188
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 1>like real musta had good stuff.</v>

189
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Cause a lot of times it can be speedy and it ends up feeling like mushrooms and</v>

190
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.930
<v Speaker 1>I think mushroom math.</v>

191
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

192
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.830
<v Speaker 1>combined you're saying?</v>

193
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

194
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 1>You end up with this just like intense fucking,</v>

195
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 1>it's not the God damn problem is that it's illegal.</v>

196
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

197
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.930
<v Speaker 1>You're getting weird versions of it.</v>

198
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Here's your thing,</v>

199
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.350
<v Speaker 1>here's the doctor putting the Ivm IIR okay.</v>

200
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.303
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>

201
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.593
<v Speaker 1>Can I say it?</v>

202
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

203
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.273
<v Speaker 1>Oh Christ.</v>

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.593
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

205
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Did you take this with the 1980s phone?</v>

206
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.941
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

207
00:04:37.941 --> 00:04:40.310
<v Speaker 1>that's just the way it's saved or whatever.</v>

208
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Why does it seem so little?</v>

209
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.583
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

210
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.300
<v Speaker 1>This is blue.</v>

211
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Are you blowing okay?</v>

212
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.261
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

213
00:04:48.261 --> 00:04:48.680
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

214
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.513
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

215
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.260
<v Speaker 1>So this doctor is,</v>

216
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

217
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.000
<v Speaker 1>he looked like Bob Shapiro.</v>

218
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Ojs Council.</v>

219
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.311
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

220
00:04:55.311 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 1>just lead counsel.</v>

221
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.973
<v Speaker 1>You can</v>

222
00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.123
<v Speaker 1>corner.</v>

223
00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

224
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:00.571
<v Speaker 1>so we just,</v>

225
00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:05.330
<v Speaker 1>you just go into a regular doctor's office and sticks this thing in your own</v>

226
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.500
<v Speaker 1>thing in your arm and off you go.</v>

227
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Now the doctor has,</v>

228
00:05:08.701 --> 00:05:09.630
<v Speaker 1>he tried it himself.</v>

229
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.441
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

230
00:05:10.441 --> 00:05:12.000
<v Speaker 1>he would not say,</v>

231
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.830
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

232
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.990
<v Speaker 1>he said it with a wink that he had.</v>

233
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.861
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

234
00:05:16.861 --> 00:05:20.460
<v Speaker 1>I won't comment either way on whether I've done it myself.</v>

235
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.480
<v Speaker 1>So all those guys,</v>

236
00:05:21.481 --> 00:05:23.010
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to keep it on the sneak tip.</v>

237
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

238
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.100
<v Speaker 1>But clearly he had and so yeah.</v>

239
00:05:26.101 --> 00:05:29.610
<v Speaker 1>So I would say for for the first session was amazing.</v>

240
00:05:29.611 --> 00:05:30.480
<v Speaker 1>That's when I saw you.</v>

241
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.180
<v Speaker 1>And then after that it got a little dicey.</v>

242
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Now what does it feel like when you're in it?</v>

243
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I was in a,</v>

244
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.170
<v Speaker 1>it felt like I was in a pod,</v>

245
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.870
<v Speaker 1>a pod in like a small,</v>

246
00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:45.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a small world after all like Pod,</v>

247
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm going into the [inaudible] now crossing my arms and I would like a little</v>

248
00:05:50.971 --> 00:05:55.971
<v Speaker 1>boat just going along through rooms and the rooms I would say were designed like</v>

249
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 1>kind of a bit like a,</v>

250
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Speaker 1>what's the a clockwork orange but like the,</v>

251
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 1>the milk bar thing,</v>

252
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:08.930
<v Speaker 1>a bit like white walls,</v>

253
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.680
<v Speaker 1>white breathing walls and yeah,</v>

254
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.111
<v Speaker 1>breathing.</v>

255
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:12.944
<v Speaker 1>I'd say they were breathing.</v>

256
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah they were inhaling and exhaling and,</v>

257
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.970
<v Speaker 1>but I was never freaked out and then there was like kind of digits on it.</v>

258
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:22.844
<v Speaker 1>Like the Matrix,</v>

259
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.770
<v Speaker 1>it had like a green hue to it.</v>

260
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:26.623
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

261
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 1>my biggest worry when I was in it was like I'm so out of it.</v>

262
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:33.600
<v Speaker 1>If there's an earthquake I'm fucked like I am.</v>

263
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.500
<v Speaker 1>And then I would get like wide shots of California.</v>

264
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.450
<v Speaker 1>We'll get like wide shots of California and take about like the hospital</v>

265
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:42.284
<v Speaker 1>crumbling.</v>

266
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 1>And then I've me trying to get out and go and like I can't go man,</v>

267
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.480
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to have to go without me.</v>

268
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Give me 40 minutes and I'll catch up to you guys.</v>

269
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

270
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.190
<v Speaker 1>so that was my biggest worry,</v>

271
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:54.410
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part it was just like a fairly pleasant,</v>

272
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.430
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't get over the fact that this was happening in a doctor's office.</v>

273
00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

274
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just like a regular ass fucking doctor.</v>

275
00:07:01.861 --> 00:07:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Like literally waiting room with other physicians and their patients.</v>

276
00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Old Weirdos,</v>

277
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Ma,</v>

279
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.030
<v Speaker 1>And then you go in and you trip your fucking head off and so you're sitting in</v>

280
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 1>like a regular chair.</v>

281
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:15.951
<v Speaker 1>You're sitting,</v>

282

00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:19.730
<v Speaker 1>double bed cosmetic type thing.</v>

285

<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

286
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:20.511
<v Speaker 1>It's real nice.</v>

287
00:07:20.511 --> 00:07:20.901
<v Speaker 1>They spared,</v>

288
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:21.061
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

289
00:07:21.061 --> 00:07:21.894
<v Speaker 1>he's nuts.</v>

290
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 1>So you're sitting in this craftmatic adjustable bed,</v>

291
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

292
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:25.970
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.450
<v Speaker 1>you get the needle in the arm and they leave it in there for how long?</v>

295
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.100
<v Speaker 1>40 40 minutes.</v>

296
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:31.963
<v Speaker 1>40 minutes.</v>

297
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Now if an earthquake happened,</v>

298
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:34.400
<v Speaker 1>could you just pull the needle out of your arm?</v>

299
00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:35.720
<v Speaker 1>And it was so out of it.</v>

300
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I could have.</v>

301
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I think once the drip happened,</v>

302
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.070
<v Speaker 1>like it's in you for a while.</v>

303
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

304
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.340
<v Speaker 1>so what's the drip happens?</v>

305
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.050
<v Speaker 1>You probably have however long.</v>

306
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a 40 minute trip apparently,</v>

307
00:07:46.671 --> 00:07:48.200
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if it's based on one,</v>

308
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>

309
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much is going in at once.</v>

310
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Now that stuff,</v>

311
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:53.600
<v Speaker 1>ketamine is weird because it's,</v>

312
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:54.434
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

313
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.850
<v Speaker 1>it was a tranquilizer,</v>

314
00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:56.181
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

315
00:07:56.181 --> 00:07:57.014
<v Speaker 1>For animals.</v>

316
00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

317
00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:58.551
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

318
00:07:58.551 --> 00:07:58.830
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

319
00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:59.663
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

320
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.590
<v Speaker 1>it's a horse tranquilizer and they use it as an anesthesia for humans.</v>

321
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:04.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

322
00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:04.910
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of that.</v>

323
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.710
<v Speaker 1>The guy was an anesthesiologist.</v>

324
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:07.341
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

325
00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:07.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

326
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 1>Don't they use that in war time?</v>

327
00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Because it's easy to carry around.</v>

328
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:16.490
<v Speaker 1>I believe they have in war time because you can use very small amounts and it</v>

329
00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:17.390
<v Speaker 1>puts people under,</v>

330
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:18.920
<v Speaker 1>you know what that sounds like.</v>

331
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:20.450
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like a Joe Rogan fact.</v>

332
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:21.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

333
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know for sure.</v>

334
00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 1>But it sounds like,</v>

335
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.050
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

336
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.501
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

337
00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:24.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

338
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:25.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that's the case.</v>

339
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure.</v>

340
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

341
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to a podcast with her talking about various forms of anesthesia</v>

342
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.610
<v Speaker 1>and sort of the evolution of using anesthesia and that ketamine worked really</v>

343
00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:40.820
<v Speaker 1>good in the field because you could have a very small amount and you would,</v>

344
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:41.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

345
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.890
<v Speaker 1>put someone under pretty deeply.</v>

346
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:43.641
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

347
00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:45.320
<v Speaker 1>What if it's local?</v>

348
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.861
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

349
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:46.011
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

350
00:08:46.011 --> 00:08:47.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you could have done surgery.</v>

351
00:08:47.811 --> 00:08:49.490
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like I couldn't feel myself.</v>

352
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.180
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

353
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.340
<v Speaker 1>It was more like I had no interest in it.</v>

354
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.400
<v Speaker 1>When you got here following FDA approval in 1971 did that Asia was first given</v>

355
00:08:57.931 --> 00:08:59.610
<v Speaker 1>to American soldiers during the Vietnam War.</v>

356
00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

357
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.073
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

358
00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:03.283
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

359
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:03.691
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

360
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:05.490
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit on reddit about,</v>

361
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 1>about it as an,</v>

362
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.910
<v Speaker 1>as an antidepressant treatment.</v>

363
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Frantic for depression.</v>

364
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.640
<v Speaker 1>So for you,</v>

365
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.833
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

366
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 1>you heard about this,</v>

367
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:14.994
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

368
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

369
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:19.620
<v Speaker 1>I want to say if you just Google depression treatments,</v>

370
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.480
<v Speaker 1>so you just worked growing my age too,</v>

371
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.570
<v Speaker 1>or alternative depression treatment is probably what I,</v>

372
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.590
<v Speaker 1>what I Google now we've had these conversations before you and I have found</v>

373
00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:30.420
<v Speaker 1>about depression and different treatments.</v>

374
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.670
<v Speaker 1>How much exercise do you do?</v>

375
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:33.661
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

376
00:09:33.661 --> 00:09:34.590
<v Speaker 1>did we talk about this before?</v>

377
00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:35.280
<v Speaker 1>I send them out?</v>

378
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.300
<v Speaker 1>I've run probably three,</v>

379
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:37.110
<v Speaker 1>four days a week.</v>

380
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.830
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty nice.</v>

381
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

382
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Speaker 1>That's supposed to be one of the best things.</v>

383
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:40.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

384
00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Depressions.</v>

385
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

386
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:41.993
<v Speaker 1>Cardio.</v>

387
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.890
<v Speaker 1>But like I've never gotten a runner's high,</v>

388
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:44.760
<v Speaker 1>if that makes sense.</v>

389
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

390
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:48.780
<v Speaker 1>I think I have a shortage of dopamine in my brain.</v>

391
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.913
<v Speaker 1>Just naturally.</v>

392
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Like I just think I don't have a ton of dough mean like I don't,</v>

393
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.440
<v Speaker 1>joy is not a thing I think I've ever experienced.</v>

394
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 1>What I repeat joy is a thing that I don't think I've ever experienced.</v>

395
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:04.310
<v Speaker 1>I'll experience adrenaline rushes and like ego but I'll never be truly like</v>

396
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.071
<v Speaker 1>Julius.</v>

397

<v Speaker 1>it stinks.</v>

399
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.890
<v Speaker 1>It fucking stinks cause it's something I'm,</v>

400
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.050
<v Speaker 1>I I believe in,</v>

401
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.120
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

402
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.840
<v Speaker 1>I've accomplished things I've done,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But I never get this sense of like this real,</v>

405
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

406
00:10:20.821 --> 00:10:22.560

<v Speaker 1>I'm the worst guy to talk to this about because I don't really,</v>

445
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:11.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't really get depressed.</v>

446
00:11:11.661 --> 00:11:12.860
<v Speaker 1>I've been depressed before,</v>

447
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.390

474
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

475
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.753
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

476
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:42.380
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucking,</v>

477

<v Speaker 1>I'm just lucky.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Super loud.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

482
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:52.030
<v Speaker 1>I just don't feel that that sense of satisfaction you,</v>

483
00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.120
<v Speaker 1>you have now,</v>

484
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.251
<v Speaker 1>it varied.</v>

485
00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Have you had higher and lower feelings of satisfaction?</v>

486
00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

487
00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 1>I think when I'm working a lot I feel pretty satisfied.</v>

488
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

489

<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So accomplishments or task,</v>

492
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.470
<v Speaker 1>task and goal oriented.</v>

493
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Like I like,</v>

494
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.820
<v Speaker 1>it's satisfying to deal with special or direct a commercial or,</v>

495
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:13.930
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

<v Speaker 1>not accomplishing anything or I'm not doing,</v>

502
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.210
<v Speaker 1>like if I get like real lazy,</v>

503
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.260
<v Speaker 1>I can get depressed.</v>

504
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Somebody else told me that they said that a very,</v>

505
00:12:28.811 --> 00:12:31.090
<v Speaker 1>very joyous guy told me when he gets injured,</v>

506
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.050
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>

507
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.160
<v Speaker 1>that takes it out of him.</v>

508
00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Ken,</v>

509

<v Speaker 1>I've been injured gang of times.</v>

510
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.350
<v Speaker 1>I've had a bunch of surgeries from,</v>

511
00:12:38.351 --> 00:12:39.184
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

512
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

513
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 1>athletic injuries.</v>

514
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.141
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

515
00:12:41.141 --> 00:12:41.974
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

516

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

518

<v Speaker 1>if I go into Lowe's,</v>

519
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.420
<v Speaker 1>like if I'm not accomplishing things or in the past I don't allow myself to get</v>

520
00:12:49.421 --> 00:12:52.270
<v Speaker 1>into those anymore because it's just not a good feeling.</v>

521
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:53.111
<v Speaker 1>And even,</v>

522
00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:58.111
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even necessarily have to be like a career like oriented thing,</v>

523
00:12:58.961 --> 00:13:00.880
<v Speaker 1>but I have to have things that I'm enjoying.</v>

529
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.940
<v Speaker 1>But if I'm not doing something I,</v>

530
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.770
<v Speaker 1>my brain for whatever reason,</v>

531
00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:13.090
<v Speaker 1>needs tasks,</v>

532
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.970
<v Speaker 1>it needs stuff to do and need stuff to figure out.</v>

592
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.500
<v Speaker 1>And you know what led me there?</v>

593
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:27.840
<v Speaker 1>My personality and my experience coming in,</v>

594
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:28.870
<v Speaker 1>incoming me nervous.</v>

595
00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.093
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

596
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:30.521
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

597
00:14:30.521 --> 00:14:31.030
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>

598
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.110
<v Speaker 1>this tms thing,</v>

599
00:14:32.111 --> 00:14:35.350
<v Speaker 1>transcranial magnetic stimulation covered by Blue Cross,</v>

600
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.160
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>

601
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:36.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

602
00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

603
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:38.021
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

604
00:14:38.021 --> 00:14:39.940
<v Speaker 1>that's what like it's,</v>

605
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:40.480
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

606
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.380
<v Speaker 1>it was really,</v>

607
00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:42.011
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>

608
00:14:42.011 --> 00:14:42.844
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

609
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:46.480
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of my life I felt like I had a all right,</v>

610
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.500
<v Speaker 1>I had like a,</v>

611
00:14:47.501 --> 00:14:48.301
<v Speaker 1>I had like a,</v>

612
00:14:48.301 --> 00:14:48.760
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

613
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.960
<v Speaker 1>a thing like a,</v>

614
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.790
<v Speaker 1>it almost felt like a metal weight,</v>

615
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.080
<v Speaker 1>like a bit of like five pound weight on my upper left forehead,</v>

616
00:14:57.081 --> 00:14:57.914
<v Speaker 1>my left.</v>

617
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.400
<v Speaker 1>And then so I went to this Whoa,</v>

618
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:02.234
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

619
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.210
<v Speaker 1>that sound is like an Mri.</v>

620
00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:05.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

621
00:15:05.761 --> 00:15:06.600
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>

622
00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.290
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

623
00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:07.591
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

624
00:15:07.591 --> 00:15:10.170
<v Speaker 1>It's basically the same exact magnet as an MRI.</v>

625
00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:10.591
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

626
00:15:10.591 --> 00:15:11.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just made your day.</v>

627
00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:12.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

628
00:15:12.151 --> 00:15:13.320
<v Speaker 1>They put it on your head.</v>

629
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:14.183
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty simple.</v>

630
00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:15.390
<v Speaker 1>The first time they measure it,</v>

631
00:15:15.391 --> 00:15:17.130
<v Speaker 1>they have to get to like the exact spot.</v>

632
00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:17.750
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

633
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.000
<v Speaker 1>and there's another video where my finger is pulsing that you'll enjoy.</v>

634
00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.650
<v Speaker 1>And what is it doing to you?</v>

635
00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the benefit?</v>

636
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

637
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:29.130
<v Speaker 1>it's basically magnetizing and electrifying a,</v>

638
00:15:29.131 --> 00:15:30.150
<v Speaker 1>it's waking up,</v>

639
00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:35.180
<v Speaker 1>basically did a synopsis according to them.</v>

640
00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

641
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

642
00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:37.560
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

643
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.720
<v Speaker 1>it's waking up dead synapses and,</v>

644
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:40.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

645
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:41.510
<v Speaker 1>picking up dead,</v>

646
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:43.250
<v Speaker 1>waking them up so they're dormant.</v>

647
00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

648
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.260
<v Speaker 1>that's what they say.</v>

649
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:46.783
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

650
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:47.810
<v Speaker 1>you don't even look into it.</v>

651
00:15:47.811 --> 00:15:48.021
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

652
00:15:48.021 --> 00:15:48.321
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

653
00:15:48.321 --> 00:15:48.851
<v Speaker 1>shoot me out here.</v>

654
00:15:48.851 --> 00:15:49.684
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

655
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Can I do quarter one?</v>

656
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.170
<v Speaker 1>And this one time I don't have kids,</v>

657
00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:54.531
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

658
00:15:54.531 --> 00:15:55.071
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>

659
00:15:55.071 --> 00:15:55.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

660
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit,</v>

661
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:56.511
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

662
00:15:56.511 --> 00:15:57.800
<v Speaker 1>whatever it's going to cost me.</v>

663
00:15:57.801 --> 00:15:58.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to do it.</v>

664
00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:59.421
<v Speaker 1>If you had kids,</v>

665
00:15:59.421 --> 00:16:00.254
<v Speaker 1>you think you wouldn't do it?</v>

666
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:01.420
<v Speaker 1>I think kids,</v>

667
00:16:01.421 --> 00:16:02.140
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

668
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:02.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

669
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:03.730
<v Speaker 1>sort of more,</v>

670
00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.640
<v Speaker 1>more cautious about it were young.</v>

671
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

672
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:07.950
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

673
00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:08.350
<v Speaker 1>Cause I'm,</v>

674
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like reckless,</v>

675
00:16:09.461 --> 00:16:10.294
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not,</v>

676
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:11.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like,</v>

677
00:16:11.681 --> 00:16:12.514
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

678
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:13.810
<v Speaker 1>I do research.</v>

679
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.190
<v Speaker 1>It's also vague anyway.</v>

680
00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

681
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:16.301
<v Speaker 1>The research,</v>

682
00:16:16.301 --> 00:16:16.991
<v Speaker 1>it's also like,</v>

683
00:16:16.991 --> 00:16:18.070
<v Speaker 1>we think it does this.</v>

684
00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Most antidepressants,</v>

685
00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.410
<v Speaker 1>they know,</v>

686
00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.150
<v Speaker 1>they think they know what's happening.</v>

687
00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:23.860
<v Speaker 1>They don't actually know.</v>

688
00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:24.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

689
00:16:24.641 --> 00:16:25.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird one.</v>

690
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

691
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:30.010
<v Speaker 1>When you think about how many people are prescribed these things and then</v>

692
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.040
<v Speaker 1>there's not really a direct understanding of how it impacts each p East person.</v>

693
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:36.071
<v Speaker 1>They'll tell you,</v>

694
00:16:36.071 --> 00:16:36.311
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

695
00:16:36.311 --> 00:16:38.320
<v Speaker 1>we'll try this medication and if it doesn't work,</v>

696
00:16:38.321 --> 00:16:39.154
<v Speaker 1>we'll try another one.</v>

697
00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

698
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:40.331
<v Speaker 1>Does this one work?</v>

699
00:16:40.331 --> 00:16:41.200
<v Speaker 1>We'll just cycle through it.</v>

700
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:45.700
<v Speaker 1>And how do you know if it's working for you or if you're having a good time in</v>

701
00:16:45.701 --> 00:16:48.880
<v Speaker 1>your life and so you're feeling better because maybe you started a new</v>

702
00:16:48.881 --> 00:16:51.110
<v Speaker 1>relationship and a new job and it's going wow.</v>

703
00:16:51.111 --> 00:16:51.791
<v Speaker 1>And Hey,</v>

704
00:16:51.791 --> 00:16:52.500
<v Speaker 1>it just a,</v>

705
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:53.620
<v Speaker 1>everything seems pretty good.</v>

706
00:16:53.621 --> 00:16:58.030
<v Speaker 1>I was on medications that made me nauseous for a year and a half before I was</v>

707
00:16:58.031 --> 00:16:58.181
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

708
00:16:58.181 --> 00:16:59.014
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

709
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.890
<v Speaker 1>I literally thought I was nauseous because I was eating too many lifesavers.</v>

710
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Not even fucking kidding.</v>

711
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:05.471
<v Speaker 1>Literally I was like,</v>

712
00:17:05.471 --> 00:17:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I gotta take it easy on these life savers because every night I throw up on the</v>

713
00:17:10.061 --> 00:17:12.850
<v Speaker 1>way to the laugh factory and then I realized like,</v>

714
00:17:12.851 --> 00:17:13.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

715
00:17:13.271 --> 00:17:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Neil,</v>

716
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.510
<v Speaker 1>you're taking a pretty high dosage of Zoloft,</v>

717
00:17:16.511 --> 00:17:18.370
<v Speaker 1>or you might want to just take it down a notch.</v>

718
00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:23.440
<v Speaker 1>That Zoloft stuff is supposed to be really weird for your discerning of what</v>

719
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.120
<v Speaker 1>matters and what doesn't matter.</v>

720
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

721
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.130
<v Speaker 1>like it's hard to,</v>

722
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.320
<v Speaker 1>I've never done it so it's,</v>

723
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.520
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for me to describe it.</v>

724
00:17:30.521 --> 00:17:31.030
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

725
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.040
<v Speaker 1>the people that I've talked to that had done it and said,</v>

726
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:38.430
<v Speaker 1>one of the issues that they had with it is nothing had the bad things,</v>

727
00:17:39.011 --> 00:17:40.570
<v Speaker 1>didn't feel bad anymore,</v>

728
00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.400
<v Speaker 1>but the good things didn't feel good either.</v>

729
00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Well that's thing with a lot of antidepressants is they,</v>

730
00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.293
<v Speaker 1>they raise the,</v>

731
00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:49.830
<v Speaker 1>the floor and they also the ceiling,</v>

732
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:50.970
<v Speaker 1>we'll so that it,</v>

733
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.910
<v Speaker 1>it narrows your band of experience basically.</v>

734
00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Whew.</v>

735
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

736
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:55.771
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

737
00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:57.420
<v Speaker 1>but if you're severely depressed,</v>

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.840
<v Speaker 1>That's the biggest thing.</v>

853
00:20:06.841 --> 00:20:07.020
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

854
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:07.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

855
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:08.310
<v Speaker 1>the head thing,</v>

856
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.650
<v Speaker 1>the feeling like there was a plate on my head.</v>

857
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Getting rid of that was really,</v>

858
00:20:13.081 --> 00:20:13.531

864
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.420
<v Speaker 1>a little weight and a little pressure.</v>

867
00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:26.940
<v Speaker 1>because there were times where I'd go off of uh,</v>

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.230
<v Speaker 1>so that was a big one.</v>

890
00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.420
<v Speaker 1>That was really helpful.</v>

891
00:20:58.421 --> 00:21:00.710
<v Speaker 1>Then I did a,</v>

892
00:21:00.711 --> 00:21:02.050
<v Speaker 1>I was in New York for a couple of months.</v>

893
00:21:02.051 --> 00:21:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Did that show three mikes?</v>

894
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

895
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:05.740
<v Speaker 1>which I think I told you the premise,</v>

896
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

897
00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:06.311
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

898
00:21:06.311 --> 00:21:06.851
<v Speaker 1>you told me,</v>

899
00:21:06.851 --> 00:21:07.310
<v Speaker 1>but tell him,</v>

900
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.890
<v Speaker 1>say it.</v>

901
00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.270
<v Speaker 1>So the premise is onstage,</v>

902
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.910
<v Speaker 1>I put three Mikes equidistant apart from each other.</v>

903
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.190
<v Speaker 1>One is for stand up,</v>

904
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.150
<v Speaker 1>one is for one liners that I just couldn't fit anywhere.</v>

905
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:24.570
<v Speaker 1>And then one is for true sort of emotional confessions type shit.</v>

906
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Talking about depression,</v>

907
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.310
<v Speaker 1>talking about a shit with my dad.</v>

908
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.473
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

909
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.940
<v Speaker 1>like the sort of the,</v>

910
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.660
<v Speaker 1>I won't spoil the surprise but pretty heavy shit between my me and my dad when</v>

911
00:21:37.661 --> 00:21:39.610
<v Speaker 1>he died or right before he died.</v>

912
00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:40.930
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

913
00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:42.010
<v Speaker 1>and then the,</v>

914
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.720
<v Speaker 1>and then the second monologue is about,</v>

915
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:44.613
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

916
00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.880
<v Speaker 1>kind of about like celebrity and,</v>

917
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:47.630
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

918
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:48.520
<v Speaker 1>and dealing with,</v>

919
00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:53.020
<v Speaker 1>with having a partner and then break it up and become my own guy and all that</v>

920
00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:53.854
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

921
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.750
<v Speaker 1>So it's basically like,</v>

922
00:21:55.751 --> 00:21:58.690
<v Speaker 1>it ends up being probably 40 minutes to stand up,</v>

923
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:03.750
<v Speaker 1>45 stand up in a half hour of true stories and then five minutes of one liners.</v>

924
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.140
<v Speaker 4>And did you do it after you had completed your treatment?</v>

925
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:08.303
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

926
00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.300
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

927
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.350
<v Speaker 1>I did it after,</v>

928
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:10.651
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

929
00:22:10.651 --> 00:22:13.800
<v Speaker 1>And in the middle of it I actually stopped taking everything and in the middle</v>

930
00:22:13.801 --> 00:22:15.840
<v Speaker 1>of recording or practice in the middle of,</v>

931
00:22:15.841 --> 00:22:15.991
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

932
00:22:15.991 --> 00:22:17.010
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the run,</v>

933
00:22:17.011 --> 00:22:18.900
<v Speaker 1>I had an eight week run,</v>

934
00:22:18.901 --> 00:22:19.531
<v Speaker 1>I think in New York.</v>

935
00:22:19.531 --> 00:22:19.741
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

936
00:22:19.741 --> 00:22:20.574
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

937
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:23.640
<v Speaker 1>and I stopped everything in the middle of it.</v>

938
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not like suddenly just like,</v>

939
00:22:25.111 --> 00:22:25.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I need it.</v>

940
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:26.790
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

941
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:27.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

942
00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:27.721
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

943
00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:28.380
<v Speaker 4>what were the,</v>

944
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.350
<v Speaker 4>what's the difference when you get off medication?</v>

945
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.240
<v Speaker 4>What was the,</v>

946
00:22:32.241 --> 00:22:34.560
<v Speaker 4>the difference in the way your brain was functioning?</v>

947
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:40.230
<v Speaker 1>I can almost tell how well my brain's functioning if I'm not depressed or not</v>

948
00:22:41.591 --> 00:22:42.760
<v Speaker 1>slowed down by depression.</v>

949
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:45.040
<v Speaker 1>My associations are much quicker.</v>

950
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're just like the simplest thing of like,</v>

951
00:22:48.551 --> 00:22:51.700
<v Speaker 1>that guy looks like so and so like,</v>

952
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

953
00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.040
<v Speaker 1>sort of a little roast,</v>

954
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.870
<v Speaker 1>like a little like what is that shirt fucking looks like the kind of shirt you</v>

955
00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:56.411
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

956
00:22:56.411 --> 00:22:57.460
<v Speaker 1>If I'm not depressed,</v>

957
00:22:57.461 --> 00:22:58.750
<v Speaker 1>I can think of those quickly.</v>

958
00:22:59.340 --> 00:22:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

959
00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.580
<v Speaker 1>if I'm depressed,</v>

960
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:03.850
<v Speaker 1>there were times where I'd get depression would affect my memory,</v>

961
00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.220
<v Speaker 1>where I couldn't remember the,</v>

962
00:23:06.221 --> 00:23:06.500
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

963
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:06.850
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

964
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:11.590
<v Speaker 1>the test I would always do in my head is there's a guy who directed,</v>

965
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.590
<v Speaker 1>gone with a win and the wizard of Oz back to back.</v>

966
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

967
00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

968
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

969
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.190
<v Speaker 1>and I would try to remember his name.</v>

970
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:19.420
<v Speaker 1>His name's Victor Fleming,</v>

971
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:21.160
<v Speaker 1>but if I was depressed,</v>

972
00:23:21.161 --> 00:23:21.994
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't remember it.</v>

973
00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Like it affects your fucking,</v>

974
00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.353
<v Speaker 1>do you think</v>

975
00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.373
<v Speaker 4>resource thing,</v>

976
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:31.150
<v Speaker 4>like your brain is so concentrating on the depression and feeling like shit that</v>

977
00:23:31.151 --> 00:23:32.890
<v Speaker 4>just doesn't have the resources</v>

978
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.610
<v Speaker 1>think it,</v>

979
00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:36.800
<v Speaker 1>I tend to think it's more a dead sinaps thing.</v>

980
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

981
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:38.480
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's a,</v>

982
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:40.070
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an energy.</v>

983
00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.130
<v Speaker 1>I think depression is a lack of energy in the brain.</v>

984
00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.120
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

985
00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:44.960
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you're right.</v>

986
00:23:44.961 --> 00:23:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it is.</v>

987
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.090
<v Speaker 1>It's all going to one place,</v>

988
00:23:47.091 --> 00:23:49.010
<v Speaker 1>but that's my own personal interpretation of it.</v>

989
00:23:58.770 --> 00:23:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
