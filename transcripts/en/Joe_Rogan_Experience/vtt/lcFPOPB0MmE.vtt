00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.210
One of the beautiful things about the Internet is you could watch a video,

2
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.690
meet someone from that video and have them in the podcast online right now.

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.860
Chris Harris,
ladies and gentlemen,

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.320
you're one of my all time favorite auto journalists,

5
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:19.770
you and Jeremy Clarkson because both you and Matt Farah,

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.980
the both of you guys,
you and Jeremy Clarkson,
a really funny,
you know,
you,

7
00:00:23.981 --> 00:00:27.270
you say some really funny shit while you driving these cars around your you and

8
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:32.271
also you're also like very obviously a true car nut.

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.890
You really love cars.
They all have a sort of medical condition with cards ready.

10
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:40.230
It's a problem.
I was just talking to someone earlier about this and um,

11
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.900
if you look at the upsides of what I do for living,

12
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:45.570
which is basically to review cars,
well that's how it started out.

13
00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:49.170
And it's something a bit different.
I already,
um,
I get free cars.

14
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.760
That's the upside,
right?
So I can,
I can basically earn not much money.

15
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.430
That's what you do as,
and also journalists,
do you have a a line in earning,

16
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:59.010
not much money,
but if you want to borrow a gt three for the weekend,

17
00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:02.390
you've Fernet portion along.
As you can justify it,
you probably the cost,

18
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.770
you get lots of free cars,
really expensive,
nice cars.

19
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.880
So what you shouldn't do is buy cars,
but I still buy cars.

20
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.650
I got too many cars and I don't have much money.
But yeah,

21
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.690
it's with your family.
Did you get shit about that?
I don't know.

22
00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:18.520
I have a long suffering,
an understanding wife who,

23
00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:21.030
who sort of sees it and actually the car market at the moment,

24
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:22.050
it's pretty good as you know.

25
00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:25.530
So there's stuff that I bought at the top that I bought has kind of gone up a

26
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:29.040
bit or that it's all on paper and I'm sure that by the time you've sure and it's

27
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:32.370
broken down,
you've serviced it at,
you probably wipe out all the upsides anyway.

28
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.780
Um,
but no.
Yeah,
I,
it's a great subject,
is a great medium to work with you.

29
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.430
And it's no coincidence that top gear such success because the guys are

30
00:01:41.431 --> 00:01:42.690
brilliant.
They're super talented,

31
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.200
and if you put them in charge of a gardening show,
it'd be just as good.
Well,

32
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:50.340
those guys made a shit load of money though.
They really did make a lot of money.

33
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:53.070
I mean,
they're wealthy.
Yeah.
I mean it's not past tense.
They're still doing it.

34
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:57.510
Yeah.
And um,
yeah,
they've,
they've done a fantastic job,
but then,
you know,

35
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.260
that is globally the largest television show per views in the world is,

36
00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:06.060
it really isn't that amazing.
Cars.
Yeah.
So yeah,

37
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:08.760
the top gift phenomena is,
is amazing.
I get asked about it the whole time,

38
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.500
but that's it.
I love it.

39
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:12.240
And I celebrate it and I think they're brilliant at what they do.

40
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.350
But that's a bit like finishing the Olympic 200 meters and being the bloat that

41
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:20.390
comes second and being asked what it was like to watch Usain Bolt's ass.

42
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.480
You know,
it's kind of,
it's,
it's,
uh,
it's,
I want to celebrate it,
but it's,

43
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.820
it's quite frustrating because they dominate the market.

44
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:30.630
Like no other genre has a dominance like that.
So if you,

45
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:34.590
if you view television as a series of verticals,
you know,
gardening,
cookery,

46
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.460
martial arts,
whatever you want it to be,
motoring is,

47
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.790
is the one that has the fewest players.
And the biggest dominance,
I mean,

48
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.050
if it was a company,

49
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:45.910
it would be investigated by the monopolies and mergers commission and shut down.

50
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.831
So,
but you know,

51
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:50.310
we were [inaudible] I had someone at MIP calm trying to sell my wares.
You know,

52
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:52.680
there's MIP comes the big content fairing can,

53
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.290
where you want to buy a television program about anything.
You can buy it.

54
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.071
And I thought,

55
00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:58.710
we need to make some money out this content that send someone down there and

56
00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:00.290
sell some.
And they read.

57
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.790
And you can buy three British TV programs about baking alone,

58
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.220
but you can't actually,
you know,
you,
you can't find many car shows.

59
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:11.200
There aren't many out there actually in Europe.
Certainly.

60
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:12.070
I know you've got some here,

61
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:15.250
but they're all quite tangental the cars one was coincidental,

62
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.840
but we have top gear,

63
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.580
u s we have a version with a good buddy of mine,
Adam Ferrara's on,

64
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:26.290
they're doing like a version of,
and it's so,
I mean I love Adam,
he's a great guy,

65
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:30.100
but they're copying it in some weird way where they even do the thing where

66
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:34.390
they're standing around and they have an audience that's standing around them

67
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.840
exactly the same as they do in the UK.
Yeah.

68
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.860
I'm the one thing we've always set out to do is to never copy top gear.

69
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.250
It's ludicrous.
It's like sitting down to write a novel and saying,

70
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:47.920
I'm going to try and copy bleak house.
Either you're not going to do it right,

71
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.820
it's going to go wrong.
So I think,
yeah,
copying the format,

72
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:55.450
it's impossible because the format they've arrived at and they've arrived at

73
00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:58.060
because of the personalities they have and the chemistry that you have and it

74
00:03:58.061 --> 00:04:00.880
works,
but if you're not absolutely on point,

75
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.510
I think it's difficult to pull it off.
Really.
Does Jimmy?
It's Jeremy Clarkson.

76
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:06.310
Did he take any more shit for that?
You know,

77
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:11.140
he did that eeny meeny miny moe thing where he did the racist,
well I think,

78
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:14.380
um,
I think all of that was just unfortunate really.
And uh,

79
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.620
and he's probably dealt with it and taking his pain.

80
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.380
But then the big one that just kicked off with the Argentina one you had to
know,

81
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:23.460
have you heard about that?
No.
Of Gold.
Where do I start with that?

82
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.940
That's become a proper diplomatic incident.
Obviously my cup,

83
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.260
my country UK doesn't have a great relationship with Argentina cause we had a

84
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:34.240
bit of a war with them in 1992 over the Falkland Islands and Mal Venus,

85
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.083
I think they called them.

86
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.780
And they feel quite strongly that we should give them back.

87
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.620
And I think we feel that the inhabitants probably should be allowed to,
uh,

88
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.880
have a democratic say in that.
And they sort of want to remain British.

89
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:49.530
I gather I remain nonpartisan and all of this,
I don't really know.
Okay.

90
00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:52.780
And actually,
um,
so long story short,

91
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.680
they've just filmed the Christmas special.
They took three cars,

92
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.230
I Think v eight sports cars and they're going to drive them all the way down

93
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:01.900
through South America and ended up in Argentina I think.

94
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.740
And if you've not heard about this,
this is so ridiculous.

95
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:07.120
It's very interesting because this is big.

96
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.920
This has been big news in the UK and in Argentina.
Um,

97
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.170
and when I tell you the story and why it kicked off,

98
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.300
I want to see your reaction and your reaction because,

99
00:05:17.301 --> 00:05:20.220
because you might just turn around and go,
that is nonsense.

100
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.940
You couldn't make that up.
So they bought,

101
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.990
I think Alexis is a Spree v eight to drive through South America.

102
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:28.190
I mean you couldn't get between London and Bristol in one of those that are

103
00:05:28.191 --> 00:05:29.024
breaking down.

104
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.030
And they bought a Porsche nine to eight gt and they bought some kind of Ford

105
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.650
Mustang fastback,
seventies one I think.

106
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.580
And halfway through the Philippines they had to remove them plates on the push

107
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.840
because it,

108
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.590
the number plate was accused of having some kind of a reference to the Falkland

109
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.540
Islands.
It was a totally,
it was a normal British number plate.

110
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:55.120
So it had a number three letters.
So it's so a letter,

111
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:59.210
three numbers and three letters afterwards and it was something like j nine

112
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:00.530
eight two for that little light,

113
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.370
1982 and then f k l Falklands.

114
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.350
But you know,
it was,

115
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.630
it was a bit like me looking at your number plate and just using it as an

116
00:06:09.631 --> 00:06:13.160
anagram of nothing and just making up the fact that you were calling me a tepee

117
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.040
Uranian or something and I'd just,
so anyhow,
uh,

118
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:21.041
full diplomatic incident occurred and they somehow someone on social media or,

119
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.110
or the,
the,

120
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.830
the information of that number plate was disseminated in us in Argentina when

121
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:30.760
they were down there shooting and they got a fence.

122
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.830
Effectively a mob came after them.
It's like throwing rocks at the cars.

123
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.770
They were told they were told to leave the country and they did and they

124
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:40.520
basically had to run pretty much as the,
as the crew tallit for their lives.

125
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.060
So they abandoned the cars,
which just got smashed up.
They left this town.

126
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:45.170
They had to nip across the board,

127
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:48.200
I think in the Chile to get out of the place and they flew back with that

128
00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:52.760
finishing the show.
Um,
and it's really kicked off.

129
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:57.440
So the Argentinian embassy has made a formal complaint to the BBC saying it

130
00:06:57.441 --> 00:07:00.860
shouldn't add the program.
Um,
and it's all around this number plate.
Well,

131
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:03.400
the number plate came with the car pretty much.
I mean if you,

132
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.350
if you trace the number plate back,
that's,

133
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.190
that's the number plate the car had and they've just drawn a conclusion from it.

134
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.490
However,
the question that is asked is,

135
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.140
does Jeremy have the wit and naughtiness about him to identify a number plate in

136
00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:23.120
advance and then choose that car because of that number plate and then go out

137
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:25.820
and shoot a whole program around it just so he can poke some fun at the

138
00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:28.240
Argentinians.
Um,
now I,

139
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.930
I think that's so far fetched that even a comedy genius like Jeremy Isn't,
isn't,

140
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.180
isn't going to be able to do that.
So,
um,

141
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.140
but it really has kicked off and it's quite an ugly incident.

142
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.320
That seems completely ridiculous.
Yeah.
I mean,
I know,
I mean,

143
00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:45.320
they were rocks with throne.
Someone got injured,

144
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.840
they had to leave you equipment,
got lost,

145
00:07:47.841 --> 00:07:51.530
the cars got a band and they just left the cars and rant.
That's so crazy.

146
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.450
That doesn't make any sense at all.
No.

147
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:55.370
So I've just told you the story as a casual bystander.

148
00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:58.220
Does that just sound ridiculous to you?
Sounds completely ridiculous.
But it,

149
00:07:58.221 --> 00:08:02.570
unless it's like Falkland Suck.
You know,

150
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.420
which remember when they did the one through America and they just,
and they,

151
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.480
and they and Kamins car had I love man love painted down the side of it or

152
00:08:10.821 --> 00:08:12.000
something and they try and they shit.

153
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.470
Well they'd know they drove through some Bible belt state and they got chased

154
00:08:15.471 --> 00:08:19.760
off a petro full call.
Fairly aggressive fashion.
It's a very good one.

155
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.070
Um,
I love man love.
Yes.
I thought,
Oh man,
love rocks or something.
What?

156
00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:26.900
Stay with it.
I don't know,

157
00:08:26.901 --> 00:08:29.600
but it was somewhere where such things and not appreciated.
Well,

158
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:32.900
the United States is,
we have some differences.
You know,

159
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.260
if you did that in California,
nobody would give a shit if he did it in New York,

160
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.940
most likely no one will give a shit.

161
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.180
But if you went to Tennessee and you drove around,

162
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.980
there's certain places where you could get in trouble with anything.

163
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.750
You've remotely controversial,

164
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.640
remotely supporting of homosexuality or in remotely in any way,

165
00:08:52.641 --> 00:08:56.880
negative towards the Bible or negative towards Christianity.
Yeah,

166
00:08:56.881 --> 00:08:58.110
we've got some knuckle draggers.

167
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.080
It's an interesting group of knuckle draggers in this country.

168
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.110
Everyone has a right to their own opinion.
I'm not gonna say anymore than that.

169
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:06.940
I want to make it to the airport safety without being beaten up by so much.

170
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.580
You're fine,
man.
You're in La.
This is as far west as it gets.
This is the,

171
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:14.550
the last outpost before you hit the ocean.
Yeah,
it does seem pretty,

172
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.820
pretty laid back here.
This is very laid back and very progressive.

173
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:20.880
This is the most progressive part of the country for sure.
Yeah.

174
00:09:20.881 --> 00:09:22.740
This in San Francisco,
San Francisco,

175
00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:26.070
almost to progressive cause they go so far left.

176
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:29.250
They almost become right with their lefty ideas,

177
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.460
like they get so socialist,
you know,

178
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.050
so so progressive that they,

179
00:09:35.051 --> 00:09:39.150
they're like Uber supportive of marginalized people to the point where it

180
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:43.100
becomes imbalanced but that's necessary.
It counter bound.

181
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:47.970
I think all in all it balances out.
Like you take a little bit of a,

182
00:09:47.971 --> 00:09:48.804
you know,

183
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:54.170
Tennessee or Kentucky and you balance it out with Oakland or Berkeley and it all

184
00:09:55.201 --> 00:09:58.020
comes together.
I think my modern democracies in the same aren't they?

185
00:09:58.021 --> 00:10:02.200
And certainly the European ideal tends to lean towards what you've described to

186
00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:05.680
San Francisco.
You can,
you can,
you can,

187
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.190
as a sort of minority myself within my country,

188
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.420
you can start to support minorities to the point where actually you,

189
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.920
you d normalize the normal and then,
and then everyone's standing around going,

190
00:10:16.921 --> 00:10:19.820
well,
what's going on here?
You know,
sh,
sh what,
where do,

191
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:20.760
where do you draw the line?

192
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:25.890
I read in the news today that the European Union or the European law has just

193
00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:30.030
decided to,
to classify obesity as a,
as a medical condition,

194
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.020
which is very interesting situation.
Not that I know much about it,

195
00:10:34.021 --> 00:10:36.790
but it's probably endemic of what's going on.
But you know,
okay.

196
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.560
Some people genetically just pile on the weight.
I do.
So,
yeah.

197
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.180
And I feel very sort of people that do.

198
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.720
But if you just happen to be a fat fucker,
there eats loads of burgers.

199
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.470
I don't really see why I should have to support the fact that you eat burgers.

200
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:50.011
Oh,

201
00:10:50.011 --> 00:10:54.720
so medical condition meaning that like you have socialized medicine so that that

202
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.970
helps us pick.
In the UK we have something called the welfare state,
which is,

203
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.700
you know,
quite foreign to some people.
The doll.
Well,
yeah,

204
00:11:02.701 --> 00:11:06.730
you have the rock and roll though.
And um,
and,
and I feel as a,

205
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.300
as I sort of closet socialist at times,
I feel quite strongly about that.

206
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.183
I think if you,

207
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.610
if you earn a good amount of money and you have a surplus from it,

208
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:16.050
once you've had a good time,
we'd get money,

209
00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:18.930
then why shouldn't that go towards people that are less fortunate than you?

210
00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:22.440
That's a good thing.
Why shouldn't you try and have free healthcare sensibly?

211
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.300
As long as the money's spent on doctors and not middle management,
that's all.

212
00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.350
That's all great.
But if you choose,
you know,

213
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:30.930
I've just had something called a fat burger earlier.
Oh,

214
00:11:30.931 --> 00:11:33.720
you went to fat Burger and I'd never been on tour right over here then it was,

215
00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:37.640
it was down near Jay's,
Gary's Jay Leno's carriage.
And um,
and I,

216
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.580
I just looked at the pictures on the wall and when hit the bloat,

217
00:11:40.581 --> 00:11:42.960
when just have a large,
I'm an encore hungry,

218
00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:45.000
I'll have the one in the middle of the one,
like the,
not the biggest,

219
00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:47.070
but the one down.
That's what I'd normally do in the UK.

220
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:52.670
And this bloke basically served me a cow that had been through a mincer and

221
00:11:52.681 --> 00:11:54.010
slapped between two bits of bread.

222
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.670
<v 1>And I just looked at the fucking thing.
Um,
and I,
of course I ate the whole thing.</v>

223
00:11:57.671 --> 00:12:01.330
So now I feel genuinely ill if I channel on your desk.
I'm sorry,

224
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.510
but you're fucking around with burgers though.
And you're in the United States.

225
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:07.660
Have you eaten it in and out?
Yeah,
of course.
I have been.
I've been in,

226
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.960
I've been in the country since Monday.
I've had two in announced.
You can't,

227
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:14.590
this is,
you've got to get a three by three.
You got to get an in and out,

228
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:18.260
three by three with raw onions.
But this is the one to the counts.

229
00:12:18.261 --> 00:12:22.330
So I love the concept of a retail outfit,
the cells,
false food.

230
00:12:22.331 --> 00:12:26.150
That doesn't tell you what you can buy a pack,
animal style under the counselor.

231
00:12:26.151 --> 00:12:28.810
It's a bit like when you were back in the days of Vhs,

232
00:12:28.811 --> 00:12:31.330
you go to the video shop and go to the guy when the cancer can have something

233
00:12:31.331 --> 00:12:34.440
fun to the counts of how you play man under the counter.
It's the same isn't it?

234
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.690
Like someone said,
you have your fries,
animal style.
I'm looking at this.

235
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:42.610
Nothing about animal slide up there.
Just to come back to that point.
I think,

236
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.830
yeah,
I think that kind of,
that sorts of socialism works,
but I,
but I,

237
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:52.360
I struggle with the idea of paying for people who just eat too much food.

238
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:52.930
I agree.

239
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:57.930
I mean I socialized medicine I I very strongly support in in a way and the way

240
00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:02.860
being that I think that poor people should absolutely have adequate health care

241
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.230
if they get injured,
if they get sick,

242
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:10.300
they shouldn't be fucked and saddled down with debt.
They're already poor.

243
00:13:10.301 --> 00:13:13.780
And I think that it also should be something that society,

244
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.140
if we're going to take care of our citizens,
we're going to,

245
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.340
we're going to provide good roads,
we're going to provide schools.

246
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.420
How could we not provide healthcare?
It seems like a really important thing,

247
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.440
but then again,

248
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:31.450
if you're a doctor and you've fucking struggled through school and you've,

249
00:13:31.451 --> 00:13:33.490
you know,
you've made it to the top of your profession,

250
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.060
you should be adequately compensated for your hard work and effort.

251
00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:42.240
So I'm torn in a way and that I think that absolutely there should be some sort

252
00:13:43.481 --> 00:13:46.870
of socialized medicine as some sort of socialized health care and it should be a

253
00:13:46.871 --> 00:13:50.920
part of the services that a society provides.
I also,

254
00:13:50.921 --> 00:13:55.420
I don't want to see doctors suffer and be disgruntled and pissed off because

255
00:13:55.421 --> 00:13:59.200
they have $500,000 in fucking student loans.
And you know,

256
00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:03.610
the government wants to pay them $50,000 a year to take care of people 12 hours

257
00:14:03.611 --> 00:14:05.440
a day.
I think that's ridiculous too.

258
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.450
So I think if we do have socialized medicine,

259
00:14:07.451 --> 00:14:11.110
I think doctors have to be adequately compensated.
If they're not,

260
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.660
you're not going to get the same effort that you're going to get from people

261
00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:18.661
that are in a capitalist medical society where the best doctors cost more money

262
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.630
and they're better.
They're just better.
We have a lot of fucking,

263
00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.170
we have people that fly from all over the world to come to the United States

264
00:14:26.171 --> 00:14:30.280
because some of the doctors that we have are the best in the world in their

265
00:14:30.281 --> 00:14:33.310
field.
And those guys,
they should just,
they deserve money.

266
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.430
They've made it to this position by being excellent.

267
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.800
So I'm torn in a way.
I mean,
I,

268
00:14:38.801 --> 00:14:42.880
I don't think anybody should ever go without healthcare.
W if they get injured,

269
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:44.920
they should certainly be taken care of.
If they get sick,

270
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:48.370
they should get medicine.
But you know,

271
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.010
it comes to a distribution of money.
Yeah.
It's interesting isn't

272
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.290
<v 0>it?
Because you,
you can,</v>

273
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.930
you can't view it as a utopia because there is no single solution,

274
00:14:56.931 --> 00:14:59.720
but certainly is that the health,
the NHS as we call it,

275
00:14:59.721 --> 00:15:02.000
the national health services is sort of a global freak.

276
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:05.480
There's nothing else like it,
right.
It costs us a fortune.
I'm literally,

277
00:15:05.481 --> 00:15:09.350
I'm going to a,
as a percentage of GDP,
I don't know the figure,
but it's fast.
Um,

278
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.090
and it is an amazing thing,

279
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.990
but once you scrutinize the costs and where the money actually gets spent,

280
00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:17.630
of course,
naturally in any modern,
mature bureaucracy,

281
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.690
too much of the money gets spent.
Not Making people better,

282
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.960
not paying the doctors and not spending it on medical care.

283
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.340
It's in middle management.
It's in infrastructure,
it's in waste,
of course.

284
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:31.280
And that's like charity.
Yeah.
It's just,
that's the great frustration with it.

285
00:15:31.281 --> 00:15:32.280
Really.
Um,

286
00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:37.190
how the fuck did we get there from driving through really this podcast.

287
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:42.380
But no,
we don't have a real structure.
No.
And I think it's um,
yeah,
strange on my,

288
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.120
my wife's a doctor and I think,
uh,

289
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.590
I think that one of the frustrations of watching her generation of,
of,

290
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.680
of colleagues and graduates is that they graduated sort of just before the.com

291
00:15:53.151 --> 00:15:57.960
boom.
So late nineties and their comeuppance there,

292
00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:02.510
they're kind of grinning moment was that when the rest of us had finished

293
00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:06.050
getting pissed and behaving badly at university for three or four years and

294
00:16:06.051 --> 00:16:09.050
they'd had to work.
So every time we'd stack it in at five in the morning,

295
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:12.080
shit faced and they'd had to say,
I didn't go out last night,

296
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.150
I've got to get up and do something serious tomorrow morning.

297
00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.970
They turned around and they all got jobs straight away.
Fair enough.

298
00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:19.280
Cause they'd worked hard and they all learnt reasonably good money.

299
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.940
But then the.com thing happened and suddenly pretty much everyone who'd been a

300
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:25.550
loser and a drop out and done their work suddenly start earning more money than

301
00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:27.280
them.
And they're all saying,
well hang on a minute.
I changed.

302
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.980
I've trained for eight years and I earned less than the person that's working on

303
00:16:30.981 --> 00:16:34.910
some reception at Goldman Sachs.
So how does that work?
Um,

304
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.760
but I think if you like anything in life,

305
00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:40.820
if you start to plot what happens strategically over time,

306
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:45.210
they don't do too badly because they are mostly insured and,

307
00:16:45.211 --> 00:16:48.650
and sort of de-risked against the,
the,
the,
the boom and bust cycles aren't they?

308
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:52.930
Doctors can earn money regardless of where you are on the economic cycle.
Um,

309
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.840
and they should have more.
Well,
you know,

310
00:16:55.841 --> 00:16:59.840
what price do you put on someone that can,
that can save your life.
It's amazing,

311
00:16:59.841 --> 00:17:01.910
isn't it?
You must have asked your quest that question.
You must have had some,

312
00:17:01.911 --> 00:17:03.890
something happened to you where a doctor's really helps you out.

313
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.830
And if you did a sort of matrix style freeze frame of that moment and said,

314
00:17:06.831 --> 00:17:08.660
right,
given my net worth,

315
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.480
what would I be willing to give to that person because of what they've just done

316
00:17:11.481 --> 00:17:14.240
to me?
It's a lot of money,
isn't it?
Yeah.
I think we've all had moments.

317
00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:15.620
We've just thought,
I'll give you everything.

318
00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.960
I think you're so wonderful actually give you everything,

319
00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.330
especially when it comes to life changing things like cancer or you know,

320
00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.860
spinal injuries or something along those lines.
Yeah.

321
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.300
And then about 10 minutes later of course,

322
00:17:26.301 --> 00:17:28.290
once it's all subsided we will calm down and think no,

323
00:17:28.291 --> 00:17:32.560
I wouldn't give them anything.
I buy another horse.
Um,
so uh,

324
00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.140
your green Porsche,
the famous Kermit,

325
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.960
whatever you call it,
the green fucker.
Shit,

326
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:44.000
it ain't shit or that you built this 1972,

327
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.300
it was on a 72 shell.
Yeah,
I love that car.

328
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.630
I seriously thought about building one of those.
Alex from shark works.

329
00:17:51.631 --> 00:17:52.740
Kind of talk me out of it.

330
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:57.120
We talked about doing an older air cooled car and you know,
he was his,

331
00:17:57.121 --> 00:18:01.530
his thought is once you have one of those gt three Rs is with a 3.9 liter,

332
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.630
502 horsepower engine and he's like,

333
00:18:03.631 --> 00:18:06.030
you're just not going to be able to deal with that little car.

334
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.440
It's just not the same.

335
00:18:07.441 --> 00:18:12.441
But I think there's something pure about those little tiny lightweight cars.

336
00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:16.470
Yours was like,
what,
2100 pounds or something like that.
And English money,

337
00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:19.740
it was just over a ton,
switched over a thousand kilograms.

338
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.250
So 2100 pounds,

339
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.770
which is extremely light for a car.

340
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:30.640
And then 300 and probably 340 horsepower on a proper Porsche,
340 horsepower.

341
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.480
So that's like a Ferrari.
The one of those five.
Um,

342
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.610
it was a mega think they're interesting,
aren't they?

343
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.070
Can we can get geeky now because you've got some car people that listen to this,

344
00:18:38.071 --> 00:18:42.420
the lot the,
and people were very excited to have you on the difference.

345
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.240
The difference between the car you've got and the on the older cars is

346
00:18:45.241 --> 00:18:49.320
definitely one of size and interaction.
It's stranger than motor vehicle.

347
00:18:49.321 --> 00:18:51.750
You can add very small amounts of girth to,

348
00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:56.220
to a car and that sort of becomes exponential on the road.

349
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.450
The feeling of size.

350
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:02.570
You only have to make a car 2030 mil wider and suddenly you feel that you're

351
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.640
taking it more and more of the road.
You have fewer options,

352
00:19:05.641 --> 00:19:10.360
fewer lines you can take in a turn.
And so it becomes less wieldy.
Yeah.
And,

353
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.500
and you become conscious of that and I think you're driving adjusts accordingly.

354
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.500
So the smaller cars,
the older cars definitely have that about them.

355
00:19:16.501 --> 00:19:20.550
Of course there are more tactile because they don't have assisted steering.

356
00:19:20.551 --> 00:19:23.790
They don't have,
you know,
they have flow hinge paddles.
They have,

357
00:19:23.791 --> 00:19:26.580
there's lots of other things that are interesting classic about them.

358
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.810
You can give them breaks but it's standing,
they don't have much breaks.
Um,

359
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.190
and they tend to,

360
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.850
what they tend to do is they tend to offer a lot more interaction of fun at

361
00:19:35.851 --> 00:19:39.450
lower speeds.
That's,
that's what I,
what I would say.
I'd say in a,

362
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.060
in a nice 2.4 s from 73,

363
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.260
you can probably get your kicks and feel that you've had something from the car

364
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:50.220
by not driving it that hard.
Um,
and by just mooching around you,

365
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:54.090
you're probably busier whereas your car in econ need to get up.

366
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.730
And there's a personality about,

367
00:19:56.731 --> 00:20:00.870
particularly the GT series Porsches from 99 onwards where they go,

368
00:20:00.871 --> 00:20:04.680
do they go do the engines?
If you draw,
if you,
if you don't rev it beyond three,

369
00:20:04.681 --> 00:20:06.240
you really feel that you've missed out.

370
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:09.390
Basically if you've taken the hot back to your room and you've made her a cup of

371
00:20:09.391 --> 00:20:12.510
coffee and gone to sleep.
And I think you really,

372
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.350
whereas I think the older cars offer a little bit more,

373
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.500
the green car was complete folly.
I mean it was developed with a friend of mine,

374
00:20:19.501 --> 00:20:22.740
Richard Tuttle,
and they make amazing rally cars.
I mean,

375
00:20:22.741 --> 00:20:24.750
you know what's ago and one of their things that are off the scale,

376
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.150
well you didn't even have a key,
you had a switch.
Hey,

377
00:20:27.151 --> 00:20:28.080
we just had a toggle switch.

378
00:20:28.081 --> 00:20:31.530
We didn't see that was that we thought that was really cool until I found

379
00:20:31.531 --> 00:20:35.790
someone sitting in it just,
just,
just the probably ready to steal it.
But I mean,

380
00:20:35.791 --> 00:20:37.590
yeah.
Well as you found someone saying,
yeah,

381
00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:41.760
what was I Bristol or somewhere and um,
I just politely asked him.

382
00:20:41.761 --> 00:20:43.590
He wanted to get out of my car and he did and walked off.

383
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.290
Did you ask him what the fuck he was doing?
No,
he was,

384
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.960
he looked like had probably done far too many plus eight so I don't know what he

385
00:20:49.961 --> 00:20:54.370
was going to do but drugs and he was kind of um,

386
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.720
it made me realize that the coolness of the lack of security probably wasn't the

387
00:20:58.721 --> 00:21:00.130
cleverest thing we could have done.
But we ended up,

388
00:21:00.131 --> 00:21:02.860
we ended up actually hiding and electronic cutout on it.

389
00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:04.810
Some are a bit sneaky so that then that,
then it went,

390
00:21:04.811 --> 00:21:06.670
he works cause you could just give it that one.

391
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:09.250
And then I just liked the simplicity of the toggle.
It was nice.

392
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.460
I also hate started buttons in cars don't you?

393
00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.570
I think they're the most pathetic invention.

394
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.070
W M three that as a starter button and I like it cause I just get,

395
00:21:18.071 --> 00:21:21.730
you don't have to do,
you don't have to use a key d.
A lot of them like a Ferrari.

396
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:22.631
You're getting it,

397
00:21:22.631 --> 00:21:25.630
you turn the key on and then you have to hit a button on the steering wheel.

398
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.100
That seems too,
why would you do that?

399
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.710
I like the fact that I have my key in my pocket.

400
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.790
I grab a hold of the door number three.
Well I sit down in the car,

401
00:21:33.791 --> 00:21:37.300
I pressed the button,
it starts.
I love that.
I do love that.

402
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.790
I think what was liberating about the,
the green car was it was a bit like,
um,

403
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.830
it was a bit like a food critic being told to cook a meal.

404
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:51.100
I'd spent at that stage probably 10 years criticizing everyone else's work.

405
00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:54.630
I was the critic and the critic is quite low creature actually in,
in,
in,

406
00:21:54.631 --> 00:21:58.570
in the scheme of things,
you just go along and you saw that and that's very good.

407
00:21:58.571 --> 00:22:00.250
I don't think that's very good.
I think that's not bad.

408
00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:05.020
And that's based on your experience with the cars and you hope that people think

409
00:22:05.021 --> 00:22:07.570
those are valid opinions,
but you've never actually done it yourself.

410
00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:08.980
So I wanted to do it myself.

411
00:22:08.981 --> 00:22:13.480
I wanted to make a car that I thought roughly approximate it to what I wanted in

412
00:22:13.481 --> 00:22:17.920
a driving device,
in an aesthetic object.
And I really enjoyed the process.

413
00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:21.190
It was really,
really enjoyable and I was amazed at how wrong we got it at times.

414
00:22:21.191 --> 00:22:26.191
We just got it so profoundly wrong and it was so eyeopening the process to work

415
00:22:26.591 --> 00:22:29.050
out where the money goes.
I mean it was just hopelessly inefficient.

416
00:22:29.051 --> 00:22:30.640
And Richard and I are really good mates and we,

417
00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:34.240
neither of us really got any clue with money at all.
And he'll admit that.

418
00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:36.640
And we just,
the bills just racked up and up and up.

419
00:22:36.641 --> 00:22:38.590
We've got this bloke to do the trimming inside the car.

420
00:22:38.591 --> 00:22:41.380
I wanted not too much trim,
but whatever it was there,

421
00:22:41.381 --> 00:22:43.030
I wanted to be of exceptional quality.

422
00:22:43.031 --> 00:22:45.790
So I wanted to stitching to be by hand on the panels on the dash.

423
00:22:45.791 --> 00:22:49.060
And I wanted an alkyne Tyler roof and I wanted the recaro seats trimmed.

424
00:22:49.061 --> 00:22:53.890
And we've got this bloke in from Jaguar who does all the,
um,
the show cars.

425
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:56.980
So it does those beautiful interiors.
And when the bill came in,

426
00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.280
I just said to Richard was clearly wrong.
There's like two astronauts on it.
Well,

427
00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.130
why was he doing?
He's putting too many Zeros on the,

428
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:05.500
on the bill and we couldn't work it out.

429
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.860
Trimming cars like that just costs a fortune.

430
00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:10.830
And I didn't know how expensive was.

431
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.030
So oddly enough that then alter my perspective.

432
00:23:13.031 --> 00:23:17.120
So when I next got in a small volume sports car rather than going,
oh,

433
00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.490
that's a bit shit that trim there,

434
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.870
what have they done that I immediately thought,

435
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.130
I now know why they've done that because actually for the money they could have

436
00:23:24.131 --> 00:23:27.250
had spent on that trim,
they've actually probably given us a better differential.

437
00:23:27.251 --> 00:23:28.540
They're probably given us better dampers.

438
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.300
There were probably five things about the car dynamically they could have spent

439
00:23:31.301 --> 00:23:34.690
that money on that made the vehicle much better than if they'd gone for the

440
00:23:34.691 --> 00:23:35.980
fancy panel on the dashboard.

441
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:40.180
Well that's why something like singer is such an interesting approach.

442
00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:44.590
Like they've gone all high end.
If you don't know what singer is,

443
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:46.100
singer vehicles

444
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:47.090
<v 1>in California,</v>

445
00:23:47.091 --> 00:23:52.091
they take a nine six four which was a 19 what an 89 to 92 93 something like

446
00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:59.330
that.
Porsche and they,
they strip out everything.

447
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:01.460
They take all the body panels off.

448
00:24:01.461 --> 00:24:06.230
They replace them with carbon fiber body panels that mimic the long hood models

449
00:24:06.231 --> 00:24:10.730
between 70 and 73 is that what it was?
The long hood ones,

450
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.380
but they will from the very start,

451
00:24:12.381 --> 00:24:16.580
they were long hood so you could save from 64 actually,
right?
Yeah.
And they um,

452
00:24:16.581 --> 00:24:20.690
they put this incredible Cosworth engine in it.

453
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:25.610
They put this amazing,
beautiful interior,
everything,
carbon fiber,
everything,

454
00:24:25.611 --> 00:24:30.230
hand stitched,
everything be spoke.
And the cost is staggering.

455
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:35.440
They start at like $300,000 us and they get up to well over half a million for a

456
00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:42.380
nine,
six,
four.
And you know,
and I really dynamically,
the way it drives,

457
00:24:42.381 --> 00:24:46.040
it's a nine,
six,
four with a souped up engine and a good suspension.

458
00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:49.180
<v 0>Both you and I agree that live,
we had half a minute spend on a car.</v>

459
00:24:49.181 --> 00:24:52.570
We'd have almond milk because they are just amazing.
I was with Mars last night.

460
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.310
Mass has got a hangover at the moment.
Um,
and uh,
so he's very Masterman sing it.

461
00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.040
But yeah,
we've got,
you've got to be careful about the singer.
It's,
it's,

462
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:04.990
you can't say singing on 11.
I just did.
So I didn't say it for legal reasons.

463
00:25:04.991 --> 00:25:06.850
Is it good?
It was a very careful legal position.
So it's a,

464
00:25:06.851 --> 00:25:10.750
it's a reimagined nine 11 that happened to be made by a company called singer.

465
00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.930
So is there an issue there that's just,
there has to be straightforward.
Yeah.

466
00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.250
You Porsche don't like anyone playing with their IP too much,

467
00:25:18.251 --> 00:25:22.250
so they just got to be quite careful with how do they feel about singer?
Um,

468
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:27.270
he says,
he says,
yeah,
they,

469
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:32.240
I think on an engineering level and account enthusiast level,
they love it.

470
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:33.650
But I think also the,

471
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:37.760
they view it as their thing now that is the most,

472
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:40.610
one of the most recognizable products on the planet and someone else's.

473
00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:41.220
<v 2>Okay.</v>

474
00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.020
<v 1>Playing with it.
So in a big way.
Yeah.
I mean it's,</v>

475
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:49.010
it looks like a 73 but it's a s 1989 and then

476
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.600
<v 0>it's a stunning thing though,</v>

477
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.510
I think of all the cars I've driven in the last three years,
that's,

478
00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:57.290
that's one of the top few that I really,
I'd put my money into it.

479
00:25:57.291 --> 00:26:00.920
I just think they're gorgeous.
Absolutely gorgeous.
It's a beautiful car,

480
00:26:00.921 --> 00:26:03.470
that's for sure.
And they do drive brilliant new as well.

481
00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:07.600
And I love the story behind it.
Rob British guy who's,
you know,

482
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.270
spent six months messing around with modeling clay to get the shapes on the

483
00:26:11.271 --> 00:26:14.300
fenders.
Right.
And it was a lead singer in a band.
Yeah,
yeah.

484
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.550
When he's the cousin of Bruce Dickinson,
who's,

485
00:26:16.551 --> 00:26:19.310
I'm the lead singer of iron maiden.
There's,
that's the know.
So there's,
there's,

486
00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:22.910
there's there,
there's,
there's rock in the blood.
So what band was he in again?

487
00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.220
What was Robin?
I don't know what ban Robert.
Well,

488
00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:28.220
Robert Forgotten your band name.
Sorry.
He Wa he was in a pretty good,
you know,

489
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:32.700
well known band.
Um,
and I just loved the story and I both,

490
00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.740
I think any product is naturally enhanced by the,
by the narrative behind it,

491
00:26:36.741 --> 00:26:40.520
isn't it?
And the singer,
the singer story is lovely and they just wicked blokes,

492
00:26:40.521 --> 00:26:44.280
but do that.
They're cooking on gas now.
So to start with it was,
crikey,

493
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.400
<v 3>can we build three of these right now?
It's,
you know,</v>

494
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.160
how do we build all the cars we've got orders for?
I mean they've,

495
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:54.840
they've really taken off what a weird world we live in where they can't fill

496
00:26:54.841 --> 00:26:59.610
enough orders of half a million dollar cars.
It,
well the car,

497
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.320
he's bizarre isn't it?
And it has,

498
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:06.330
it's taken on a new form that has shocked even people like me.

499
00:27:06.331 --> 00:27:10.290
Cause I,
I've always felt confident that people will spend money on cars,

500
00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:15.000
big money on costs because we all bump into people that have resources.

501
00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:18.150
And it seems that the motorcar is something that more often than not,
they like,

502
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:23.610
um,
and,
and yet I'm stuck at by the fact that,
you know,

503
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:28.710
Mclaren can build 395 p ones and they just sold out a couple of days after they

504
00:27:28.891 --> 00:27:29.460
announced it.

505
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:34.350
And the one is how many million is 1,000,009 or some crazy shit probably.

506
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:37.700
Yeah,
probably is that means that a Laferrari is over too,
isn't it?
I mean

507
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:40.290
the one,

508
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:45.290
the one that actually is baffling is the portion on 18 because they built 918 of

509
00:27:45.871 --> 00:27:49.230
those.
And I sat several times in interviews with Mr Hats,

510
00:27:49.231 --> 00:27:53.130
who is the boss of vice arc in Porsche to the r and d development place.

511
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.950
And the man that makes those decisions and has to stand by them.

512
00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:00.570
And I just sat goading him saying,
you'll never sell 918 of those,
you just won't.

513
00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:03.660
And you know,
look at,
look at Mclaren and Ferrari.
You have taken a more sense,

514
00:28:03.661 --> 00:28:07.890
we'll have to do,
I think it's 499 la Ferrari's and there's 395 p ones.

515
00:28:07.891 --> 00:28:11.070
Those seem like realistic volumes,
but 918 of a vehicle,

516
00:28:11.071 --> 00:28:13.800
that's what's that over here?
It's a,
it's a million quid.

517
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:17.040
More than a million dollars.
Yeah.
So it must be 1.4 million.
I would have thought.

518
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.790
Um,
they've just sold them all.
They've just announced they've sold them off.

519
00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:21.361
So I've got,

520
00:28:21.361 --> 00:28:24.420
I've basically got to wear a tee shirt that says I'm sorry I was wrong the next

521
00:28:24.421 --> 00:28:28.860
time I see him.
Wow.
Um,
so,
but there,
there is this huge appetite for it.

522
00:28:28.861 --> 00:28:31.110
And also there is,
um,

523
00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.620
I suppose there's a parallel with the advertising photographer from the 80s

524
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:38.970
which was,
you almost couldn't say this off of you are too cheap.
Could you,

525
00:28:38.971 --> 00:28:42.060
you know,
if you,
if you,
if someone approached you and said,
you know,

526
00:28:42.061 --> 00:28:44.190
you're a great photographer,
how much for a day?
Shoot.

527
00:28:44.191 --> 00:28:47.100
And he went as 5,000 pounds,
they'd get in there,
you're not expensive enough.

528
00:28:47.101 --> 00:28:49.320
And you'd go,
Oh damn,
why didn't I say I was 50,000 pounds?

529
00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.630
And it's the same in the car world.
I think if you,

530
00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:56.230
you'd be trying to sell something at 200 grand now sterling,
so let's say three,

531
00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.460
250 to $300,000 you're slightly a no man's land.

532
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.280
You're not bespoke enough to be really special,

533
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.810
but you're probably more expensive than the average are eight nine 11 by wants

534
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.760
to spend money on.
So you're a nomas.

535
00:29:08.761 --> 00:29:10.620
And so you've got to sort of take yourself out there.

536
00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:14.430
And if you take yourself out to that weird place where the billionaires look and

537
00:29:14.431 --> 00:29:18.510
just say,
there it is.
It's a million,
2 million,
5 million.
I'm just making it up.

538
00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:20.520
They just buy into it.

539
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:23.850
And of course if you can then make that stick at that top end,

540
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:26.890
you could bring the volumes down that makes you more exclusive and then they buy

541
00:29:26.891 --> 00:29:31.530
into the exclusivity as well.
Um,
guess a mad world when you follow it.

542
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:34.890
And also the great thing about the three hyper cars that everyone's talking

543
00:29:34.891 --> 00:29:37.530
about at the moment is that quite a few of blokes that have them,
of course,

544
00:29:37.531 --> 00:29:42.430
all three,
you know,
so the number of people who've got a 18 and a Laferrari

545
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.250
<v 0>and a and a p one as there's several of them.
That's insane.</v>

546
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:50.140
I saw a big Bugatti Veyron in public,
and when I saw it all,

547
00:29:50.141 --> 00:29:53.080
I can think the number one thing,
I thought there's $1 million,

548
00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.890
there's a million plus dollars in,
in a,
you know,

549
00:29:56.891 --> 00:30:01.750
whatever at 10 foot little segment.
But did you want it now it's an ugly car,

550
00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:07.420
ugly.
I don't,
I don't,
I don't,
I,
that's not the kind of car I like.
It's a big,

551
00:30:07.421 --> 00:30:11.740
heavy,
super powerful car.
It's like,
it's not an intriguing to me,

552
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:15.670
you know,
it seems like a wild rocket ship and it's kind of interesting,

553
00:30:15.671 --> 00:30:19.930
but it's so over the top what I drive it for a day.
Yeah,

554
00:30:19.931 --> 00:30:24.880
it'd be fun to drive,
but to own it.
No,
it just seems,
it seems ridiculous.

555
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:29.530
He had the failure on,
he said he's a really weird thing.
I wonder how,

556
00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.580
I wonder how history will remember it.
It's,
it's,

557
00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:36.160
it's sort of a piece of engineering for the sake of a piece of engineering.

558
00:30:36.161 --> 00:30:36.970
That's what it is.

559
00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:41.320
It's a demonstration of what the Volkswagen group could do at the time and for

560
00:30:41.321 --> 00:30:44.740
that,
it's fascinating and it will be remembered for technologically for several

561
00:30:44.741 --> 00:30:47.680
things.
I mean,
it's the first really fast cars.
He's a dual clutch gearbox.

562
00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:48.250
That was,

563
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:51.340
that was the thing that hit me when I first drove it because before that you

564
00:30:51.341 --> 00:30:54.370
either had those shit actuated manuals,
the sort of original paddle shifters,

565
00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:58.840
the Flores f one and whatever Lamborghini called it,
shit tronic or something.

566
00:30:58.841 --> 00:31:01.810
I don't know.
I mean they just Audi r eight up until recently,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

567
00:31:01.811 --> 00:31:02.290
So you had,

568
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:05.710
you had these transmissions sort of limited the experience they got in the way

569
00:31:05.711 --> 00:31:06.400
of it.

570
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.860
Whereas you've got in the veil on and you suddenly just had this little panel

571
00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:11.590
and he just pulled it and you had instant gear shifts.

572
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:16.800
So and that's in conjunction with his four wheel drive meant that yes you had a

573
00:31:17.171 --> 00:31:21.040
cane pathic of over a thousand horsepower,
but that doesn't really matter.

574
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.860
You can claim any numbers what you can actually put onto the road at any one

575
00:31:23.861 --> 00:31:26.920
time that matters.
Net usable performance or power,
let's say.

576
00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:30.970
So have you had a thousand horsepower in the mid eighties if you had a car that

577
00:31:30.971 --> 00:31:34.630
did have that power,
you probably only have 30% of that available.
Anyone time.

578
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:37.720
By the time you had shit ties a shit transmission and everything else wasn't

579
00:31:37.721 --> 00:31:40.140
working,
you wouldn't have the performance.
The,

580
00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:44.110
what struck me with the Vayar almost even on a slightly damp road in an emulsion

581
00:31:44.111 --> 00:31:44.944
where the factory is,

582
00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:49.790
you could kind of use 80 90% of that performance and that created all of the

583
00:31:49.791 --> 00:31:52.270
other problems,
which was that I'd never driven on the road that fast before.

584
00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:53.410
It was just crazy.

585
00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:57.550
You were so far out of sync with any other piece of traffic and the things quite

586
00:31:57.551 --> 00:31:58.810
big as well.
It's quite big.

587
00:31:58.811 --> 00:32:02.170
It's quite heavy and of course once you get up to those speeds you have to get

588
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.610
back from them quite quickly as well.

589
00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.680
So I suppose that was more of a super bike mentality.

590
00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.960
It did stop and the veteran was,

591
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.810
wasn't always has been just this ridiculous connection of numbers and they

592
00:32:10.811 --> 00:32:13.840
continue into the ownership experience as well.
So you know,

593
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:17.670
because of the MAG wheels and the tires,
they will learn.

594
00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.530
I think you can only change the rims and the tires two or three times.

595
00:32:20.531 --> 00:32:23.600
Then you've got to replace the wheels as well.
So that's why it's,

596
00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:27.520
that's 25 $30,000.
Why is that?
Just because they,
they won't,

597
00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:29.990
they won't allow them to carry on just against,

598
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:31.990
they've got cracks in them cause their magnesium,

599
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:37.320
everything about the vehicle had to be engineered to a level that allowed

600
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.210
maintenance so that you could go into 250 and it whenever you wanted or
whatever.

601
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:42.740
It would do 246 miles an hour.

602
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:45.710
And that meant some of the top end stuff was really,
really extreme.

603
00:32:45.711 --> 00:32:47.480
Particularly on wheels and tires and consumables.

604
00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:51.970
It is the most expensive carve his type to run ever.
I mean the Laferrari,

605
00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:55.040
the p one and the nine 18 are child's play compared to a very wrong,

606
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:58.540
and that's why very values are so suppressed.
I mean,
is it,

607
00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:03.560
it's the value car out there now because you can't just buy one and stick it in

608
00:33:03.771 --> 00:33:05.060
the garage and hope it's going to go up.

609
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.460
You'll stick it in the carriage and before you sell it again,

610
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:10.360
someone will want $50,000 to do something to it.
Right.

611
00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:12.680
And that's what suppresses the values of them.
Yeah.

612
00:33:12.681 --> 00:33:17.090
It seems like it's not a car that's going to be valuable in 10 20 years from
now,

613
00:33:17.091 --> 00:33:21.890
whereas like a Ferrari f four 30 is going to be valuable in the future.

614
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:25.760
You know,
will it,
I mean I think a manual one might I think,
I think,
uh,

615
00:33:25.761 --> 00:33:29.120
I think the manual at four 30 I shouldn't be saying this is probably the sneaky

616
00:33:29.121 --> 00:33:31.760
one out there at the moment because it's hard to find them.
They are,

617
00:33:31.761 --> 00:33:34.820
what's the last manual?
Berlinetta v Eight Ferrari.

618
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:39.410
So that's worthy of celebration because there was no manual for five,
eight.
Um,

619
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.240
I could see that being worth a few quid in the future.

620
00:33:41.241 --> 00:33:44.390
I mean the favor on will be worth money,
but I just don't know.

621
00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.610
I just don't know how you're going to maintain them.

622
00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.390
Said the nine five nine is a similar car actually if it's era cause they're 40

623
00:33:50.391 --> 00:33:54.260
values just sprung up straight away two or three years ago.

624
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:56.330
And another story of them in America,

625
00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.750
what does the day the other night with vine,
yeah.
Yeah.
You had to and you had,

626
00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:01.720
they let have them all sitting in a,
in a lot,
didn't they?

627
00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.790
They couldn't actually distribute,

628
00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:05.480
couldn't distribute them because they weren't crashed.
Tested.

629
00:34:05.481 --> 00:34:09.380
So Bill Gates bought two and crashed one.
Did he?
Yes.

630
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:15.350
Brilliant story crashed one a million dollar classic Porsche nine five nine

631
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.160
crash tested it just so that they could get it to pass in America.

632
00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:22.490
And that was that from the original batch back in whenever 19 no,

633
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.540
I don't know where he got it from,

634
00:34:23.541 --> 00:34:28.280
but I remember it was a big story that he had bought two so he could crash one

635
00:34:28.281 --> 00:34:30.930
and drive one.
What a wonderful story.
Yeah,

636
00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:35.860
the knife was the VA one of its era because it has advanced technologies in it.

637
00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.160
One of which was a,
you know,

638
00:34:37.161 --> 00:34:42.080
you go buy a 78 well I guess it's a hundred plus thousand dollars now Nissan Gtr

639
00:34:42.081 --> 00:34:44.600
and it would bury that Co.
Of course it would.
But that's progress,
isn't it?

640
00:34:44.601 --> 00:34:46.910
And I think that people that buy into old cars aren't too worried about

641
00:34:46.911 --> 00:34:48.550
comparing modern performance with all before.

642
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:51.440
That's a problem with something like a very Ron [inaudible].
Ron,

643
00:34:51.441 --> 00:34:54.890
the big thing about it is the fastest car you can buy,

644
00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:59.390
that's why it's $1 million.
It's an unbelievably obscene,
really fast.

645
00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:04.660
But if you were on a real track like the Nurburgring with a VA Ron and a GTR,

646
00:35:04.671 --> 00:35:06.080
the GTR would probably be,
yeah,

647
00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.450
I think the VA Ron has never really been a track car.

648
00:35:08.451 --> 00:35:12.920
The Va runs just to stick it in a straight line and go really fast in it car and

649
00:35:12.921 --> 00:35:15.560
I've never driven anything like it's still for a straight line performance.

650
00:35:15.561 --> 00:35:17.750
I think we did.
What was it at the time?

651
00:35:17.751 --> 00:35:20.150
It was the quickest it had done on the public road.

652
00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:25.780
We borrowed one in about 2006 and uh,

653
00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.190
we had the car for a day.
That's the way it works.

654
00:35:28.191 --> 00:35:33.191
You could borrow the car for a day and a Julius Kruta.

655
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:36.980
Hello Julius.
He was the guy that sort of manage the loan.
Great Guy.

656
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.860
He was in charge of,
his job title was brilliant.
It was sort of,

657
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.050
he was like an antiquarian bookseller.

658
00:35:43.051 --> 00:35:45.990
He was in charge of heritage and stuff like that.
And um,

659
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:49.290
and he handed the car over and we shot it in a group test,

660
00:35:49.291 --> 00:35:52.320
normal sort of magazine scenario.
And we did it for all to,
I think it was,

661
00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:55.620
and we had an hour rate and some other stuff and we did some bits and bobs and

662
00:35:55.621 --> 00:35:57.120
then the shoot finished when the light faded.

663
00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:00.120
But we still had this car and everyone else going back to the hotel.
And I said,

664
00:36:00.121 --> 00:36:03.360
well,
we've got this thing for a day.
I'm using it for a day,
you know,

665
00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:05.910
when it gets dark through the night,
why would we stop using it?

666
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:09.150
Let's go and do something.
And we had a video camera with us.
We said,
well,

667
00:36:09.151 --> 00:36:12.360
let's go,
you know,
we're near Germany,
we'll just hop over the border and we'll,

668
00:36:12.361 --> 00:36:15.060
um,
we'll go fast on the autobahn.
I'd never been fast.

669
00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:19.470
You need to have effectively a second key to make the Vero and going through it

670
00:36:19.471 --> 00:36:24.340
super fast mode where the big wing comes out the back.
Yeah.
It's just,

671
00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.300
it's a second effective is second mode.

672
00:36:26.301 --> 00:36:29.160
It's a bit like the old corvette Zr one where you had this set.

673
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:34.060
I think it is a second key and that then lowers the car and puts it into super

674
00:36:34.061 --> 00:36:34.620
fast mode.

675
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:39.620
Cause before that would you believe it is limited to 236 I think it's crazy.

676
00:36:39.961 --> 00:36:41.400
You know,
speed limits are and then,

677
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:44.460
but if you want to do the final 12 miles an hour,
you have to have the,

678
00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:48.750
we didn't have the special key.
Um,
but we went out on the Autobahn in a,

679
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.620
we have two cars.
We had exactly the same car as yours,
but stock standard.

680
00:36:51.621 --> 00:36:56.621
So we have the Porsche press orange nine nine seven gt three Rs gen one 3.6 and

681
00:36:58.051 --> 00:37:03.051
we had a very rum and photographer and another driver and he got to about

682
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.880
midnight and we waited for the a five nickels river,

683
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:10.320
which is a great piece of auto bonus.
It's like five lanes wide undulates a bit,

684
00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:13.780
but there's a good long fast action is totally de restricted.
Um,

685
00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:15.460
we're waiting for it to clear a bit and we just thought,
well,

686
00:37:15.461 --> 00:37:17.010
we'll see how fast the car will go.
And just,

687
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.560
so we did a couple of kind of bearing in mind,

688
00:37:19.561 --> 00:37:23.100
this is a road where a hundred is a cruise,

689
00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.830
120 is you're moving a bit,
140.

690
00:37:25.831 --> 00:37:29.700
There's a lot of people doing that and regularly people come past it in one 60,

691
00:37:29.701 --> 00:37:33.240
one 70 even then that's,
that's the way of the world in Germany.
Um,

692
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:35.970
but anything over one 70,
you're quite anomalous,
you know,

693
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:40.500
there's not many of you doing that.
And we use the very one gets from 130,

694
00:37:40.501 --> 00:37:45.390
280 very quickly.
And then from one 80,
from from one 80,

695
00:37:45.391 --> 00:37:48.610
it feels like at the time it felt like no car.
I had driven before because,
uh,

696
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.360
an LP,
six 70,
um,

697
00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:55.380
mercy Alago Lamborghini that that can get to 190,
quite quickly,
180,

698
00:37:55.381 --> 00:37:57.780
but after that,
those next 20 miles an hour,

699
00:37:57.781 --> 00:38:00.690
you watch the needle just creep and you watch the numbers come up,

700
00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:04.350
a single digits,
just click,
click,
click.
The very one just goes bang.

701
00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.590
So we did a couple of runs were it just hit 200 and I thought,

702
00:38:07.591 --> 00:38:09.660
well that's quite interesting.
So let's see how fast we can go.

703
00:38:09.661 --> 00:38:12.510
So we put the camera in it and this,
this did a lot of hits on Youtube.

704
00:38:12.511 --> 00:38:13.230
I remember.

705
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:16.740
And we just went and see how fast it would go and there was still traffic out on

706
00:38:16.741 --> 00:38:17.574
the road.
And we did,

707
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.620
we did 227 in amongst and amongst all these other cards.

708
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.910
And um,
and I just kept my foot pinned for a bit longer and just kept it going.

709
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.790
And the push that your car was behind us following as a structure,
sort of a,

710
00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.410
yeah,
it was like a support car really to make sure everything's all right.

711
00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:36.970
And had a camera on the front of it I think.
And,

712
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:40.600
and we had radios and I got so far ahead of it and he was doing,

713
00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.450
I remember we stopped,
the support was really,

714
00:38:43.451 --> 00:38:46.920
really hot and he stops the next services and I was really frazzled because I'd

715
00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:50.080
not been that fast on the road before.
And everything looks different.
You know,

716
00:38:50.081 --> 00:38:53.430
you do tunnel in a bit on the sides.
You have to be very,
very careful.

717
00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:54.790
The cards I start to wonder a little bit,

718
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:58.120
you pick up cambers everything just behaves a bit differently and you have to

719
00:38:58.210 --> 00:38:59.650
have your wits about you more than I thought.

720
00:38:59.651 --> 00:39:01.090
I thought you'd just put your foot down and go.

721
00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.660
And I'd done 200 many times before,
but the extra 27 miles an hour,

722
00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.140
it was like entering a new zone.
And um,

723
00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:11.560
it was amazing to talk to someone who'd been driving then one of the fastest

724
00:39:11.561 --> 00:39:14.190
sports cars on the planet,
the Gt three Rs.
And he just said,
you,

725
00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:17.410
you went out of sight.
We couldn't see.
You got so far ahead,

726
00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:20.800
but it was like you were in a different type of vehicle altogether.

727
00:39:20.801 --> 00:39:22.640
You just went,
you might as well have been in an aircraft.

728
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:27.820
It was mega and after that I suppose there were a lot of people at the time just

729
00:39:27.821 --> 00:39:32.050
saying it's not a McLaren f one it's too heavy.
It's not fast run a track elite,

730
00:39:32.051 --> 00:39:32.884
it's breaks.

731
00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:37.750
But when you've done that speed in one in traffic and then felt the way it

732
00:39:37.751 --> 00:39:39.550
stops,
the felt,
the way it responds.

733
00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.900
You do have some respect for the car you do and you,

734
00:39:41.901 --> 00:39:44.060
I think you create an emotional bond with it that you,

735
00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:46.840
you can't really relinquish so,
so I am a,

736
00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:51.900
I'm actually a very wrong defender because I felt what it can do and what it was

737
00:39:52.091 --> 00:39:55.180
designed to do.
I think part of the problem with the veil and is that the,

738
00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:59.230
the design brief for it was flawed.

739
00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:02.130
You can't blame the vehicle for being flawed if,

740
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:05.860
if the reason it exists was a bit flawed that you see my logic here,

741
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:10.330
I think if they'd set out to make the best driving hypercar of all time,

742
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:11.590
they probably would have done it.

743
00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.850
But what they actually set out to do was to do 250 miles an hour safely and

744
00:40:15.851 --> 00:40:18.610
reliably.
That in itself is bonkers.
I mean,

745
00:40:18.611 --> 00:40:21.240
when you talk to the engineers about the engine,
it's rated at what,

746
00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:26.050
over a thousand horsepower.
But apparently it can put out so much more.

747
00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.060
It can,
you know,
it could have 1300 horsepower,

748
00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:30.210
but it needed to without even thinking about it,

749
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:36.400
1300 if it needed to,
it needed to.
So it's,
yeah,
it's,

750
00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.620
it's a strange thing,
but here's the question,

751
00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:43.680
is it a more pleasurable drive then your green Porsche that has 340 horsepower?

752
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:49.510
No,
that's the,
that's the great debate amongst all of us car people,
isn't it?

753
00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:53.590
And like I vacillate hugely between the two and I'm completely spoiled.

754
00:40:53.591 --> 00:40:56.350
So I'm the last person to ask because what I'll tend to do is go through phases.

755
00:40:56.351 --> 00:41:00.310
I think all men go through phases.
You go through car phase is high five phases,

756
00:41:00.311 --> 00:41:03.010
watch phases where you're a little fad is the thing that you're into and

757
00:41:03.011 --> 00:41:05.110
sometimes things are really important.

758
00:41:05.111 --> 00:41:08.350
Then they drop away and you can spot it by the dates of the magazines you've got

759
00:41:08.351 --> 00:41:11.210
in your house.
Aren't you all haven't bought high fi magazine for a bit.
Um,

760
00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:15.400
and I think I'm like that with cars.
I kind of need all the fixes.

761
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.010
So if you gave me,
if I woke up tomorrow morning,

762
00:41:18.011 --> 00:41:19.840
I'll probably tell you I'm in a bit of a delicate phase,

763
00:41:19.841 --> 00:41:23.100
so I'd quite like to have an at least I'd like 118 horsepower basic earlier

764
00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:27.110
lease on original p Zeros to it's fucking lethal in the wet.
Um,

765
00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:29.330
and I liked the challenge and I like the fact that it's not that fast.

766
00:41:29.331 --> 00:41:33.870
You've got to carry momentum.
And I,
I take joy in the long travel suspension,
I'd,

767
00:41:33.871 --> 00:41:34.070
I'd

768
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.380
<v 3>celebrate everything that's great about Lotus and the purity of it.</v>

769
00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:41.560
But then after a month I'd probably quite light something just to swap me fast

770
00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:43.591
and straighten this.

771
00:41:43.591 --> 00:41:47.000
I'd probably want a Gtr with a thousand horsepower and I'll probably drive that

772
00:41:47.001 --> 00:41:47.834
for a month.

773
00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:50.120
And I love it and I wouldn't miss the loads of the tool and I'd love the

774
00:41:50.121 --> 00:41:52.640
performance and I constantly am myself in trouble with the law.

775
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:53.750
But then after that month,

776
00:41:53.751 --> 00:41:58.730
I probably think God would you like a nine 11 and and I this is the problem with

777
00:41:58.731 --> 00:42:01.700
it.
I don't think there's an answer.
I think broadly speaking,

778
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:07.780
the cheaper for the lighter purist route is where I sit broadly speaking.

779
00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.310
But I'm not a purist.

780
00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.570
I cannot tell you that I can adhere to one single philosophy of,

781
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:16.490
of the type of fast car that I want.

782
00:42:16.491 --> 00:42:18.350
I think it's a broad church and I want it all.

783
00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:23.570
<v 1>I agree.
I like a light car and,
and I,</v>

784
00:42:23.571 --> 00:42:26.550
I like a,
a really good handling car,

785
00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.650
but occasionally like an American muscle car.

786
00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:33.450
I used to have a Shelby gt 500 and it was a fun car.

787
00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.340
I didn't really enjoy driving.
Was that one,

788
00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:39.570
2011 so 550 horsepower one not the big one.

789
00:42:39.571 --> 00:42:43.440
That's 668 the the recent one,
but it was fun.
I mean,

790
00:42:43.441 --> 00:42:46.980
it was so stupid.
You don't need anything more than 550 horsepower.

791
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:51.840
Anytime I want it to,
the tires would break lose.
Anytime I'm turning a corner,

792
00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:56.460
all I'd have to do just give it a little extra juice and why that'd be sideways

793
00:42:56.461 --> 00:43:00.720
around the corner.
It was fun.
It was stupid live Rear Axle,

794
00:43:00.721 --> 00:43:03.150
completely archaic Caveman car,

795
00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:08.100
but it would make me smile all the time.
Just the sound of the rumble,

796
00:43:08.101 --> 00:43:10.470
the VA and the wine of the supercharger.

797
00:43:10.471 --> 00:43:14.760
Just combine with all that together.

798
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:19.500
It was fun,
stupid fun,

799
00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.710
but they really do make that shrieking noise.

800
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.790
It's so much more retarded than the Porsche cause the Porsche,

801
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.010
everything feels balanced out.

802
00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:33.720
Even the shark works 502 horsepower version of it.
It seems balanced out.

803
00:43:33.721 --> 00:43:37.890
Like you have to rev it up to get the real power or there's a lot of,
you know,

804
00:43:37.891 --> 00:43:42.720
you've got (800) 800-0800 Rpms till you hit the red line is a lot going on
there.

805
00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:46.440
Where's would that Shelby first gear,
stomp the gas.

806
00:43:46.441 --> 00:43:51.210
You're going completely sideways.
The car just,
it would just go,

807
00:43:51.211 --> 00:43:54.450
it just,
it can't keep up narrow tires.

808
00:43:54.451 --> 00:43:57.810
It doesn't have the right amount of traction.
Ridiculous engineering.

809
00:43:57.811 --> 00:44:02.100
It's not a car that's designed,
they took a regular Mustang and they just said,

810
00:44:02.101 --> 00:44:05.550
let's just get crazy with this regular Mustang.
And it's stupid.

811
00:44:05.551 --> 00:44:09.300
But there's something fun in that stupidity that would always make me smile when

812
00:44:09.301 --> 00:44:10.020
I drove it.

813
00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:13.440
<v 3>Well,
I think,
but it comes down to the broad church,
doesn't it?</v>

814
00:44:13.441 --> 00:44:16.380
The thing I've just explained,
I've,
I,
if I had,

815
00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.740
if you had to keep that as your only car for three years,
I get bored.

816
00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:23.220
It would worth in the joke would wear thin.
He'd want something different.

817
00:44:23.221 --> 00:44:26.900
So actually what we're saying is to all you men out there,
um,

818
00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:29.070
and women that are into the subject,
this is your excuse.

819
00:44:29.071 --> 00:44:32.600
You've got to have lots of cars.
You can't,
you can't have,
you know,

820
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.480
I always try and keep things a bit balanced and I,

821
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:40.890
I tend to get it wrong,
but I've got something that's Italian and stupid and,

822
00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.700
and to make me look like I've got a tiny Willie.
Um,

823
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:46.800
and I've got some German stuff which works and I really appreciate the

824
00:44:46.801 --> 00:44:50.610
engineering and I've got some old French tat that I really enjoy because it just

825
00:44:50.611 --> 00:44:53.070
makes me feel alive and pleasurable and it's,

826
00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.850
and it's light and clever and gallic.
Um,
and I've,
you know,

827
00:44:56.851 --> 00:45:00.210
I've got something that goes off road and I think you need all of that.

828
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.720
And it's just all of these things are excuses to waste money,
right?

829
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:05.850
That's what it's all about.
And once you've done that,

830
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:09.960
you can then cover all the bases off and of course you will always be in the

831
00:45:09.961 --> 00:45:11.190
wrong car for the job.
That's,

832
00:45:11.191 --> 00:45:15.210
that's the whole point of it all being a current thesis is about

833
00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:19.920
shouldering the pain and the burden because you'd never in the right thing.

834
00:45:19.921 --> 00:45:24.090
So if I,
if I wake up and I go,
I'm going to go out in my five,
12 Ferrari,
great.

835
00:45:24.091 --> 00:45:25.410
And I get the thing started up,
you know,

836
00:45:25.411 --> 00:45:26.910
and I can't guarantee it's going to start,

837
00:45:26.911 --> 00:45:28.500
but if it does start and we'd go out in it,

838
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:30.900
that's the day that my wife will phone and say,

839
00:45:30.901 --> 00:45:33.420
can you go and collect two of the children from school?
And I'll go,
I can't.

840
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:35.970
And she'll go,
why?
That's just so selfish.

841
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.300
So the car basically caused the social issue at home.
So they blame the car.

842
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:42.540
You know,
if I'd been in the m five then I could have done it,
but I wouldn't,

843
00:45:42.541 --> 00:45:44.460
I didn't do it cause the law of Murphy means I didn't have it.

844
00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:49.610
And then the time that I'm out in the two CV with 12 horse power is the time

845
00:45:50.011 --> 00:45:54.150
that I'll come up against some young gun in an evo and I'll want to learn him.

846
00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:55.380
And I wish I was in a fast car,

847
00:45:55.381 --> 00:45:58.220
but I'm in the bloody TCV so I can't do anything about it again.

848
00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:01.950
Like you're always in the wrong tool for the job.
I think when you go to,

849
00:46:01.951 --> 00:46:05.580
you just got back from Jay Leno's garage when you go to jail and it was gross.

850
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:08.730
Do you feel like this guy's got it.
Nailed it.
This is how you do it.

851
00:46:08.731 --> 00:46:12.390
You just have everything that's ever been built and you put it in a fucking

852
00:46:12.391 --> 00:46:15.420
warehouse.
Yeah,
I was.
I asked him about that because I said,

853
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:19.260
what a nice man he is.
I said,
okay,
look,
I've got,
I don't know,

854
00:46:19.261 --> 00:46:23.040
I've got double figures,
carbs,
but they are worth nothing.
My,
you know,

855
00:46:23.041 --> 00:46:24.660
I've got one or two cards that might have some value,

856
00:46:24.661 --> 00:46:26.880
but most of them are worth thousands,
2000 pounds.

857
00:46:26.881 --> 00:46:30.390
They'd rubbish and they never work.
They never start on the key.

858
00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:32.520
I mean the whole point of having cars is that they work.

859
00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:35.400
You don't want to have to,
you know,
if you get a red day off,

860
00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:38.790
you want to drive the thing.
I don't want to,
I'm not a natural span.

861
00:46:38.791 --> 00:46:41.790
I don't want to be playing with the thing.
I want to drive it.
So I said to him,

862
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:42.930
how many cars have you got?

863
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:48.030
Any went roughly 132 so he's got an idea and I said,

864
00:46:48.181 --> 00:46:49.620
so how do you keep them?
So they turned on.

865
00:46:49.621 --> 00:46:52.290
The key to is where we just do so when you walk in there,

866
00:46:52.291 --> 00:46:53.640
they were just batteries everywhere.

867
00:46:53.641 --> 00:46:57.370
Battery chargers everywhere and it does turn on a key.
He,
he,

868
00:46:57.371 --> 00:47:00.750
he manages to do it so that he can use them.
And it's,
I've staff,

869
00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:04.040
of course he does.
I mean it's,
it's a,
it's an opera,
it's a bloody industry.

870
00:47:04.041 --> 00:47:06.450
It's not even a business.
It's incredible to view.

871
00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:10.170
But I love the fact that they are there to start until work,

872
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:14.870
every single one is there to work.
So we were looking at a GM cyclone,

873
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.280
which for a Brit is a really fascinating vehicle.

874
00:47:17.281 --> 00:47:22.281
That was I think in 91 it was the fastest vehicle GM made and it is a truck and

875
00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:27.990
I'm such a cool thing and I'm,
I,
I food or she chose that moment to say to him,

876
00:47:27.991 --> 00:47:30.010
so you know,
when did you last try this?
And

877
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.100
<v 0>he went this morning and just put his hand,
he said,
put your hand on it.</v>

878
00:47:32.101 --> 00:47:36.360
Is still hot.
Damn.
Why didn't I choose something else to try and expose you?
Um,

879
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:37.520
uh

880
00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:40.900
<v 1>yes.
Steam engine,
car.
God,
he's got some amazing stuff.</v>

881
00:47:40.901 --> 00:47:43.480
I mean there's a believe that America,
if they,

882
00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:47.740
they knew Jay Leno just solely based on his love of cars.

883
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:51.760
If he had gotten involved in a car show a long time ago instead of tonight show,

884
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:54.160
they would have a much more positive opinion of him.

885
00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:58.540
How is he genuinely viewed?
I mean what cause he was,
he was,

886
00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.990
he was the what was the show called?
The tonight show?
Yeah,

887
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:03.130
cause we just thought it was amazing.
We just don't know about that one.

888
00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:06.010
Depends on the circles that you travel in.
A lot of people,

889
00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:10.870
they lost a lot of affection for him because he was hosted the tonight show and

890
00:48:10.871 --> 00:48:13.750
then Conan O'brien briefly became hosted the tonight show.

891
00:48:13.751 --> 00:48:17.980
But the ratings dropped and it was partially because he had his own show at

892
00:48:17.981 --> 00:48:22.360
10:00 PM and people watch that and they weren't watching the 11 o'clock version

893
00:48:22.361 --> 00:48:23.500
with Conan O'brien.

894
00:48:23.501 --> 00:48:27.550
And then he reclaimed the tonight show and that a bunch of people got angry at

895
00:48:27.551 --> 00:48:29.140
him,
including a bunch of Hollywood people.

896
00:48:29.141 --> 00:48:31.000
They thought that he's stolen from Conan O'brien.

897
00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.460
I thought the whole thing was pretty fucking ridiculous,
but

898
00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:35.920
<v 0>he's,
he wasn't</v>

899
00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:42.370
<v 1>the most real guy when it came to talking with people about some stupid fucking</v>

900
00:48:42.591 --> 00:48:46.250
movie that he really didn't care about or some album release that he's never

901
00:48:46.251 --> 00:48:48.920
going to listen to the songs.
He just,
he didn't give a shit.

902
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:52.040
So he was just kind of like this gracious,
very friendly,

903
00:48:52.041 --> 00:48:55.490
nice host who really didn't have any passion for what he was talking about.

904
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:59.780
But when you see him talk about cars,
he lights up.

905
00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:04.520
He loves it.
He's wearing a Jean shirt,
you know,
and Jean Pants,

906
00:49:04.521 --> 00:49:06.410
he just wears what he would normally wear.

907
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:10.880
He has Jay Leno's garage and he talks about these cars and you could see his

908
00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:15.200
real knowledge and real passion and he,
he,
it's exciting.
It's fun.

909
00:49:15.201 --> 00:49:18.170
I love watching his youtube show,
Django Leno's garage.

910
00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:19.460
But I've always said to myself,
like,

911
00:49:19.461 --> 00:49:22.610
if this guy just did that from the beginning,

912
00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:24.410
people would have a totally different opinion of him.

913
00:49:24.411 --> 00:49:29.120
He would be loved across the board,
especially by men who love cars and said,

914
00:49:29.121 --> 00:49:33.180
people have this sort of like,
we'll lukewarm opinion of him.
He's,
he's in his,

915
00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:36.920
no one gets excited about Jay Leno in America.
I a bit,
it's a bit like,
like

916
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:40.940
<v 0>me telling you that story about top doing Argentina because I didn't know any of</v>

917
00:49:40.941 --> 00:49:42.160
that.
I didn't know that that was,
he was,

918
00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:47.090
that was the perception of him in that space.
But I want a great bloke.
I mean,

919
00:49:47.091 --> 00:49:52.091
he's probably the most convincing Carinthia just have ever met.

920
00:49:52.341 --> 00:49:54.560
And I only met him three hours ago.
I mean,
he is,

921
00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:57.360
he's so completely into the subjects.
He loves them.

922
00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:01.580
He just took three hours to walk me around all of the rooms in his,

923
00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:03.490
you can't call it a garage.

924
00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:07.760
I mean it's a small town and uh,

925
00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:09.530
and,
and he just,

926
00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:13.490
the way he talks about the vehicles is that he celebrates the engineering within

927
00:50:13.491 --> 00:50:13.611
them.

928
00:50:13.611 --> 00:50:18.410
He's an engineering freak and he has a sort of fetish about weird engineering.

929
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.970
So he's,

930
00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:24.970
he'll walk past something that has a value of $1 million and walk up to a

931
00:50:25.101 --> 00:50:30.101
motorcycle that's probably worth $1,000 because it's got a radial engine housed

932
00:50:30.171 --> 00:50:33.560
within the front wheel spokes.
And that when you bought it,

933
00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:35.390
you were told rather than to stop,

934
00:50:35.391 --> 00:50:38.720
to just do little sort of circles on it to stop it falling over because the

935
00:50:38.721 --> 00:50:42.650
centrifugal force meant it meant it was easier in terms of oil distribution or

936
00:50:42.651 --> 00:50:44.630
something.
I don't know.
And He loves the quirkiness.

937
00:50:44.631 --> 00:50:49.370
He just loves quirky engineering and it's really compelling to listen to.

938
00:50:49.371 --> 00:50:50.290
So yeah,
I mean I,

939
00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:56.080
I think he's fantastic and I think the way that he talks about cars and the

940
00:50:56.661 --> 00:50:59.330
stories behind them and the,
yeah,

941
00:50:59.331 --> 00:51:03.050
the narrative behind all of it is fascinating.
And He loves the story.

942
00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.470
He's a complete sucker for it.
He admitted,
he just said like,

943
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:07.610
I keep buying stuff because of the story binder.

944
00:51:07.611 --> 00:51:09.110
I didn't need another one of those.

945
00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:12.260
But then I spoke to the guy and he told me what they like,
Oh shit,

946
00:51:12.261 --> 00:51:16.370
I better buy it now.
Um,
and I love that he's,
he's,

947
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:17.810
I love people who,

948
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:22.990
who are almost transfixed by their passion and you feel like there's just a sort

949
00:51:23.661 --> 00:51:27.740
of,
there's an invisible rope just dragging them through a process and they don't

950
00:51:27.741 --> 00:51:30.350
really have any control over it.
It's just happening.

951
00:51:30.351 --> 00:51:32.210
And then they're along for the ride and they love it.

952
00:51:32.211 --> 00:51:35.060
And I think that's exactly him.
Um,
yeah.

953
00:51:35.061 --> 00:51:39.680
Well how interesting that that's the perception I suppose as a,
as a,

954
00:51:39.681 --> 00:51:42.050
as a Brit who doesn't know anything about the talk show,

955
00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:43.760
all I can say is that your,

956
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:46.520
your media business is the most advanced in the world.

957
00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:49.640
If he was that bad at his job,
they wouldn't have kept him for that long.

958
00:51:49.641 --> 00:51:50.990
And he was clearly doing something right.

959
00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:55.460
<v 1>Isn't that it was that bad.
He appealed in a strong way to middle America.</v>

960
00:51:55.910 --> 00:52:00.590
Middle America is thought to be the dumbest section of this country and they're

961
00:52:00.591 --> 00:52:04.160
just,
you know what I mean?
I don't,

962
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:07.460
I think that's changing and a lot of ways because of the Internet,

963
00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.630
the Internet is essentially making the entire country one big neighborhood and

964
00:52:11.631 --> 00:52:15.140
that everyone has access to the same amount of information now where it didn't

965
00:52:15.141 --> 00:52:18.500
use to be like that in the middle of the country you're dealing with the Bible

966
00:52:18.501 --> 00:52:18.891
belt,

967
00:52:18.891 --> 00:52:22.520
you dealing with a lot of people that are very religious and very close minded

968
00:52:22.521 --> 00:52:27.521
and they want things very homogenized and pasteurized and that's what Jay Leno

969
00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:31.910
tonight show come on and it would tell like he says hello by the way,

970
00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:34.550
I've got some great guys.
He said to that guy and he's a sweetheart,

971
00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:36.560
I really liked the guy but his,

972
00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:40.820
his version of the show was the most successful version.

973
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:43.940
And what he did,
he figured out how to crack that code.

974
00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:49.180
He figured out how to be the guy that is many people as possible with like,

975
00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:51.110
and for whatever reason,

976
00:52:51.111 --> 00:52:55.040
Hollywood didn't like him and they tried to move him out a couple of times and

977
00:52:55.041 --> 00:52:59.600
he,
when,
when they finally got them away from the job,
he was number one.

978
00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:04.010
He was number one and,
and late night TV.
It's very strange.

979
00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:08.810
The whole thing is very strange.
It's just he never got the respect doing that.

980
00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:13.930
But I still still to this day think that if he had a show and it was just about

981
00:53:14.241 --> 00:53:17.720
cars,
he would be like one of the most loved men in America,

982
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:22.520
especially by men who love cars.
I think.
Yeah.
Well I think it's,
watch this space,

983
00:53:22.521 --> 00:53:26.250
isn't it really?
I mean,
I think,
you know,
he's,
he's primed for it.
The Jay Leno's

984
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:29.100
<v 0>garage brand is fantastic as youtube following,</v>

985
00:53:29.101 --> 00:53:32.310
it's got 1.2 million subs I think.
Ah,

986
00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:36.180
the output loads of content very generously and he's making no money out of it.

987
00:53:36.181 --> 00:53:39.800
It's all,
it's costing your money clearly.
Um,
yeah,
he,

988
00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:43.420
he could be sort of the latent force in,

989
00:53:43.421 --> 00:53:47.130
in car television over the next few years if he,
if he decides to.

990
00:53:47.131 --> 00:53:48.320
It's kind of up to him I think.
Yeah.

991
00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:51.960
He's like the American version of top gear and a lot of ways he just hasn't

992
00:53:51.961 --> 00:53:53.730
gotten into it.
But all these other shows,

993
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:59.030
it's amazing that America has this incredible fondness for automobiles,

994
00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:04.370
but very few really good automobile TV shows to hit strange isn't it?

995
00:54:05.281 --> 00:54:07.140
But that seems to be the case globally.

996
00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:12.060
There's top gear and is the UK known for his love of automobiles?

997
00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:16.140
We have a,
yeah,
we have a strong relationship with the motorcar.

998
00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.760
It's not as strong as yours.
Isn't that strange though?
Wait,

999
00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:22.170
is I think that car television is,

1000
00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:27.890
is naturally a difficult format for broadcasters to get their heads around.

1001
00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:30.390
Instinctively.

1002
00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:35.440
People that run media companies tend not to be into cars.
Is,
is,

1003
00:54:35.441 --> 00:54:36.570
is one thing I'd say.

1004
00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:41.330
They are probably more of an intellectual bent.
Um,

1005
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:46.110
and therefore don't quite understand the wasteful need to go and thrash cars

1006
00:54:46.111 --> 00:54:49.140
around and therefore it's not high on their list of priorities.

1007
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:52.920
And because of that,
it becomes difficult to commission.

1008
00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:56.490
It's not cheap to make television around cars.
Um,

1009
00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.640
and for years the audience is just weren't there.

1010
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:03.750
Most nations and broadcasters have attempted to do some car television but it's

1011
00:55:03.751 --> 00:55:07.360
not really worked cause it all started out as being sort of review car reviews

1012
00:55:07.361 --> 00:55:11.340
or product reviews,
wasn't it?
Um,
and then you fell into the,

1013
00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:15.540
that sort of really gray area of,
of,
of having,
you know,
commercial channels.

1014
00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:18.000
Cause all of your channels are commercials.
Most of yours are.

1015
00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:21.750
The BBC in the UK is that weird anomaly where it's effectively state funded.

1016
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:24.840
We pay a license fee to it.
There's no advertising around it.

1017
00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:28.770
But of course that's the perfect template for a review program because you can

1018
00:55:28.771 --> 00:55:31.290
say anything is bad and it doesn't matter.
You won't lose,
you know,

1019
00:55:31.291 --> 00:55:34.350
you say the Ford focus is shit you fought,
can't turn around and go,

1020
00:55:34.351 --> 00:55:37.570
well we're not advertising anymore.
It doesn't matter.
Um,

1021
00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:40.820
so the review format was always a bit of a problem I think on,
on,

1022
00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:44.910
on an independent commercial channel because people find it very difficult to,

1023
00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:47.640
to watch someone say,
Oh,
the Subaru legacys brilliant,

1024
00:55:47.641 --> 00:55:50.700
well let's cut to a commercial break and it's a Subaru legacy and the
commercial,

1025
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:54.060
I think most consumers struggle with that.
Um,

1026
00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:57.420
and so top gear was the first one to,

1027
00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:00.600
to turn it into an entertainment format and they were just brilliant.
I mean,

1028
00:56:00.601 --> 00:56:05.601
Jeremy and Andy Wilman just sat down and came up with what now and I've very

1029
00:56:05.641 --> 00:56:07.470
simple solutions,
but at the time no one had thought of them.

1030
00:56:07.471 --> 00:56:09.900
So they clearly were clever and sophisticated.

1031
00:56:09.901 --> 00:56:14.400
They just said it needs to be much more than just reviewing cars.
Cause frankly,

1032
00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:18.380
driving around in a small hatchback is pretty fucking dull.
Um,

1033
00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:22.750
it needs to engage the whole family,
so it needs to be entertaining.
Um,

1034
00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:24.900
and we need to do stuff with cars.
You know,
you see it.

1035
00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:27.490
If we think of cars too boring on its own,
let's do something with it.

1036
00:56:27.491 --> 00:56:30.190
Let's throw it off a building and blow it up.
Let's do something with it.

1037
00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:33.760
That makes it interesting.
Um,
and because of that,

1038
00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:36.020
it just created a momentum very,

1039
00:56:36.021 --> 00:56:39.970
very quickly actually that that meant that I think people were scared to compete

1040
00:56:39.971 --> 00:56:44.110
with it.
So you went from having a few players to having this one big plan.

1041
00:56:44.111 --> 00:56:45.940
I think everyone else went,
sat back and went,

1042
00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:49.810
I don't want to even attempt to enter that space cause we're going to look so

1043
00:56:49.811 --> 00:56:53.320
second or third best compared to top gear that it won't happen.

1044
00:56:53.321 --> 00:56:56.770
And that's when the sort of Internet shows that we will been involved in sprung

1045
00:56:56.771 --> 00:57:00.430
up over the last three or four years because no television company would,

1046
00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:03.430
would commission anything because they didn't want to be a second best to top

1047
00:57:03.431 --> 00:57:06.190
gear.
And then youtube came along with a bit of money and said,

1048
00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:10.510
well cars are cool people like car videos according to our stats on the,

1049
00:57:10.511 --> 00:57:12.400
on Youtube.
So why don't you make some content?

1050
00:57:12.490 --> 00:57:15.880
And that's where we sort of ended up really.
But it's still,

1051
00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:19.930
there is still a complete lack of motoring content that I'm into.

1052
00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:21.850
And I suspect you're into,
you know,
it's,

1053
00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:24.430
everyone has to do something clever with the car.

1054
00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:27.460
It's not enough just to say let's just have some really nice cars and do some

1055
00:57:27.461 --> 00:57:29.830
nice things with them.
And maybe that is too simplistic.

1056
00:57:29.831 --> 00:57:34.770
Maybe that does only target too small an audience,
but you know,

1057
00:57:34.771 --> 00:57:37.100
you have to basically modify it or you have to do,
you know,
yeah.

1058
00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:40.690
The car has to sort of be debased and defiled within the process,

1059
00:57:40.691 --> 00:57:42.470
which really pisses me off.
And I,
you know,

1060
00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:44.530
I've been asked to do a few things and I,
you know,

1061
00:57:44.531 --> 00:57:47.710
I don't want to modify a GTR,

1062
00:57:47.711 --> 00:57:51.280
don't want to cut the roof off a Rolls Royce.
It just doesn't interest me at all.

1063
00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:56.140
I want,
I'm into cars,
I'm not into sucking them.
That's what is exciting.

1064
00:57:56.141 --> 00:57:59.080
I mean that's what's attractive to some people.
And I think,

1065
00:57:59.081 --> 00:58:02.530
I think modification process,
I think that's just one part of it.

1066
00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:05.980
I think if you're a TV executive,
you immediately sit down and go right cars,

1067
00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:08.440
what can we do with cars to make them look interesting to people?

1068
00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:09.740
And what they miss is,

1069
00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:14.500
is the fact that inherently at the moment cars are so cool,
like a Laferrari.

1070
00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:17.260
Just the story behind the Laferrari,
the numbers,

1071
00:58:17.261 --> 00:58:21.130
the engineering and then that just the sheer visceral thrill of driving it and

1072
00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:25.150
the way it'll smack you up a road.
That's enough for me.
That's you know.

1073
00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:27.960
Whereas 15 years ago you was,
you know,

1074
00:58:27.961 --> 00:58:31.660
you were dealing in far less exciting cars.
Now the car is the star.

1075
00:58:31.690 --> 00:58:34.260
You almost don't need to do stuff with it.
I mean you,

1076
00:58:34.261 --> 00:58:37.690
you can watch top gear now is the barometer for how exciting and cars they've

1077
00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:42.220
there are so nailed down with the way they treat stuff that you can spot when a

1078
00:58:42.221 --> 00:58:45.220
car is really interesting because they just take it to the track and do the

1079
00:58:45.221 --> 00:58:47.780
track test and it,
one of them gets in it and it does pretty much what I do,

1080
00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:49.600
don't they?
They just get in it,
do some talking,

1081
00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:51.580
slide it around and then that's it.

1082
00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:54.010
But the moment they have to deal with something that's a bit less interesting,

1083
00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:56.110
they have to have a treatment.
Don't even know does that,

1084
00:58:56.111 --> 00:59:00.280
so if you dropped down a bit and m three we probably need to go and race a hang

1085
00:59:00.281 --> 00:59:03.280
glider with it.
And if it gets really bad like a Toyota I go,

1086
00:59:03.281 --> 00:59:06.290
or some little shit box has go and play football with 22 of them because there's

1087
00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:08.380
so uninteresting.
That's what we have to do.

1088
00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:12.780
And that is almost a metaphor for the way the car is treated in,

1089
00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:14.110
in mass media.

1090
00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:19.720
I think everyone's looking for an edge or a treatment and maybe there is an

1091
00:59:19.721 --> 00:59:22.070
audience just for Akasha.
He

1092
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:25.850
<v 3>says massively laded question.
But,
but,
but so no,
I think,</v>

1093
00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:28.670
I think you do need to do something with cars.
You need to go on an adventure.

1094
00:59:28.671 --> 00:59:33.290
You probably need to explain the context because all of it is fascinating.
Um,

1095
00:59:34.310 --> 00:59:35.180
but you don't need to,

1096
00:59:35.181 --> 00:59:37.790
you just don't need all this peripheral stuff and you don't need to try and be

1097
00:59:37.791 --> 00:59:41.780
too clever with it and jokey with it.
And it was that modification scene.

1098
00:59:41.781 --> 00:59:44.870
I love modifying cars.
You know,
your car's modified.
I think that's brilliant.

1099
00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:48.470
But the idea of,
of having to sort of have a,

1100
00:59:48.610 --> 00:59:53.360
a really convoluted idea around the car to make it work as television is a bit

1101
00:59:53.361 --> 00:59:56.480
insulting to the motorcar.
Do you enjoy luxury cars as well?

1102
00:59:56.481 --> 01:00:00.980
Do you enjoy like Mercedes s class or an Audi a eight or anything?
Like anything?

1103
01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:05.180
I like any car.
I'm,
I'm,
I have a medical condition.
As I said at the beginning.

1104
01:00:05.181 --> 01:00:08.970
I am,
I am,
I love anything.
I'll find joy in the hire car.

1105
01:00:08.971 --> 01:00:12.500
I'll find joy in a lawn tractor if it's got wheels,
I want to enjoy it.

1106
01:00:12.501 --> 01:00:15.690
Of course I'd have luxury cars and I,
I'd quite like the fact that I've,

1107
01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:19.730
I'm trying to do a deal with a luxury brand and known to run one for a bit.

1108
01:00:19.731 --> 01:00:24.530
Cause I,
I love wafting around and comfort.
I think everything,

1109
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.340
cars to come back to the Gehrig portfolio situation.
You know,

1110
01:00:28.341 --> 01:00:29.540
car needs to serve a purpose.

1111
01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.310
If I want to get to the airport at four in the morning,

1112
01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:35.810
I don't really want to go in your IRS.
It's the wrong car.
It's this too fast.

1113
01:00:35.811 --> 01:00:39.260
I can't hear the radio in the morning and I want to hear the radio and I want to

1114
01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:41.450
have a coffee and yeah,
you've got a cup holder,
well done,

1115
01:00:41.451 --> 01:00:43.850
but your ride is so firmly will spit the coffee everywhere.

1116
01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.870
So what I like is probably an s class and I got a really nice three 50 diesel

1117
01:00:47.871 --> 01:00:49.040
less class.
That would be lovely.

1118
01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:52.310
And do you know what horror of horrors may be a lot going to drive it for me and

1119
01:00:52.311 --> 01:00:56.260
I can just sit in the back,
can write the story.
Um,

1120
01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.850
so now I love them and I,
I suppose I like,

1121
01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:04.300
I quite liked the absurdity and inverse snobbery of old luxury cars.

1122
01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:06.740
There's something very appealing about faded glory.

1123
01:01:06.741 --> 01:01:11.620
So sort of mid eighties rolls Royces,
bit of Rusp bubbling through them.
Um,

1124
01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:11.820
you know,

1125
01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:15.650
I think they're just hugely cool and I'd quite like to knock a bite and one of

1126
01:01:15.651 --> 01:01:18.890
those,
but we haven't got always testing cars.
Um,

1127
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:21.560
I would quite like one at the moment.
I have to say,
what would I like?

1128
01:01:21.561 --> 01:01:26.561
I quite like a Bentley Mulsanne turbo or something really shit that just leaks

1129
01:01:27.141 --> 01:01:29.780
oil and has hydraulics that break the whole time.

1130
01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:33.190
You just look like you just look like a,

1131
01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:36.670
you just look like a bit of a drug dealer.
And I quite liked,

1132
01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:38.850
I think it look quite cool as a lovely story.
You know,

1133
01:01:38.851 --> 01:01:41.870
you've got a bit of time and the lovely story about the coolest Rolls Royce of,

1134
01:01:41.871 --> 01:01:44.870
well there was um,
there was uh,

1135
01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:48.010
a family that owned a company called catering.
Um,

1136
01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.740
and they were great and I'm probably getting it myself and legal trouble.
No,

1137
01:01:50.741 --> 01:01:54.820
I'm not.
Um,
and they had the sons that ran the company had a,

1138
01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:58.130
a Rolls Royce they'd bought from an auction,
fuck,
fuck,
fuck all money.

1139
01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:00.740
It was like four grand and it was um,

1140
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:03.890
it was beige or sort of Jewish racing gold as they call it in the motor trade in

1141
01:02:03.891 --> 01:02:07.730
the UK.
It was like horrible bronzy beigey color.

1142
01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:11.030
And rather than take taxis everywhere and they're out in London,

1143
01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.780
they bought this Shit Rolls Royce and they met a friendly cab driver that had

1144
01:02:14.781 --> 01:02:16.250
driven them around a few times.
And they said,
right,

1145
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:19.830
I think it's called Sultan Sultan.
You get to keep Rolls,
Royce is yours.

1146
01:02:19.831 --> 01:02:21.840
You just keep it in the gallery.
You can use it whenever you want.

1147
01:02:21.841 --> 01:02:23.370
The deal is whenever we want you,

1148
01:02:23.371 --> 01:02:26.040
you pick us up in the Rolls Royce and you take us to places and we're out in

1149
01:02:26.041 --> 01:02:28.410
town or whatever.
And that's the way it works.

1150
01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:32.490
This thing had sort of RUSP bubbles all down the side and it had an APP,

1151
01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:35.790
a massive Alpine high fire had been fitted through some contra deal I think

1152
01:02:35.791 --> 01:02:36.300
without points.

1153
01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:39.300
So they've got their own fitness to massive amount of high Phi in it.

1154
01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:42.420
And all it had was ACDC.
This,
I remember you were,

1155
01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.160
you were not allowed to listen to anything else.

1156
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.910
And it had this between the back seats where you,

1157
01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:51.600
the two people would sit in the back.
There was a,
a really crappy old cool box.

1158
01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.520
And in the cool box was just Stella Artois,

1159
01:02:53.521 --> 01:02:55.410
which in England is known as wife Beater,

1160
01:02:55.411 --> 01:02:57.750
which is just quite an ugly beer really.
There's a sort of,

1161
01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:00.210
there's a luxury about stellar Artois over here cause it's,

1162
01:03:00.211 --> 01:03:01.620
cause it's kind of a French brand,

1163
01:03:01.621 --> 01:03:03.190
but actually in England is just known as wifebeater.

1164
01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:05.520
It's the lowest common denominator.
People get a bit fighty on it.

1165
01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:08.850
So you used to sit in this thing,
salt and would drive you summer.

1166
01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:10.050
We used to go to the rugby,
it's working,

1167
01:03:10.051 --> 01:03:12.960
it we just quite dignified and all the Range Rover's park up and people have

1168
01:03:12.961 --> 01:03:14.850
their hampers before they go on to watch the game.

1169
01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:18.530
And Salt would basically muscle his way into the car park with no at all.

1170
01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:21.930
We'd be in the back,
stellar Artois ACDC coming out of the back of it.

1171
01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:23.580
Russ bubbles all down the side of it.

1172
01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:26.610
And to this day that is the coolest Rolls Royce I'll ever go in.

1173
01:03:27.610 --> 01:03:32.070
Just a wicked machine.
Um,
and I,
I,
yeah,
I love that.

1174
01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:36.240
I like the faded glory of the slightly shit over the top luxury car.

1175
01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:39.590
Please tell me you agree.
I agree.
Now this is a,

1176
01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:41.530
there's a majesty about them and I,

1177
01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:45.150
and I think particularly the ones that cost way too much money in the period.

1178
01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:47.870
We're all a sucker for value.
We're all suckers for value.
Me,

1179
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:50.670
we love saying to people that was a hundred grand and it was new.

1180
01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.480
I think people love beginning sentences with that to people that don't really

1181
01:03:54.481 --> 01:03:57.900
know.
I've got this job.
So that was 150 grand and you knew I gave three for it.

1182
01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:01.620
[inaudible] the clever responses.
That's cause it's fucking worth three.

1183
01:04:01.621 --> 01:04:04.030
Look at it.
It's a disgrace.
There's a loud,
yeah.

1184
01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:08.540
<v 1>Ferris for old American luxury Cadillacs,
like old Cadillacs,</v>

1185
01:04:08.541 --> 01:04:10.370
like 19 seventy's large ones.

1186
01:04:10.610 --> 01:04:14.210
I was watching this show a one of those west coast customs shows where they take

1187
01:04:14.211 --> 01:04:18.620
a,
an old car and they refurbish it for,
they did it for kid rock.
Uh,
the,

1188
01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:21.470
the rapper and musician,
whatever you wanna call him.
And,
uh,

1189
01:04:21.471 --> 01:04:26.471
he did like a 72 73 Cadillac giant long hood Cadillac and turned it into

1190
01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:33.020
essentially like a personal limousine with a slide up door and a ventilation

1191
01:04:33.021 --> 01:04:37.820
system that sucks out the smoke from his cigars and Oh,
it was amazing,
amazing,

1192
01:04:37.821 --> 01:04:42.110
beautiful,
beautiful car and just floats like a boat.

1193
01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:46.440
Like those things just flow like a boat on the highway.
Action suspension.

1194
01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:49.240
<v 3>Yeah.
You could get me onto a Soviet where I could become a real bore.
Actually,</v>

1195
01:04:50.170 --> 01:04:54.100
the art of comfort be completely lost in motorcars,
completely lost everything,

1196
01:04:54.101 --> 01:04:57.640
has to be firmly sprung,
have massive wheels on it for the marketing department,

1197
01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:01.720
it's all complete shit.
It's a totally unnecessary.
More often than not,

1198
01:05:01.721 --> 01:05:05.260
you want to be comfortable in a car.
So why not take some spring rate out of it?

1199
01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.960
Have a big squashy tie on it.
It's lovely.
You'll float along.

1200
01:05:07.961 --> 01:05:11.710
You get into a seventies Cadillac for a long journey on a straight road that's

1201
01:05:11.711 --> 01:05:14.560
got some bumps in it.
It's a much nicer car than most modern cars.

1202
01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:18.400
You get into an s class.
They're pretty because they've got coverage suspension,

1203
01:05:18.401 --> 01:05:22.870
but a seven series BMW and Audi A.
He'd been an RDA recently.
God Almighty,

1204
01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:26.440
I like there's concrete for suspension.
Totally unnecessary.
Your car,

1205
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:29.970
your car needs to be from,
it's supposed to go faster on the Nurburgring.
That's,

1206
01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:34.600
that's what it's designed to do,
but luxury cars are not actually that luxurious.

1207
01:05:34.601 --> 01:05:38.230
It's quite weird because would ride is fundamental to luxury.

1208
01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:41.200
They spend all this time making sure there's no wind noise.

1209
01:05:41.201 --> 01:05:44.020
They make the power train silent and then you get in them and you're not this or

1210
01:05:44.021 --> 01:05:46.930
that.
You can't see me.
I'm shaking now,
but you're like shaking around and say,

1211
01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:50.910
well where's the suspension guys?
Yeah.
Do you,
what?

1212
01:05:50.911 --> 01:05:52.510
What is your favorite luxury car like?

1213
01:05:52.511 --> 01:05:57.511
What do you think does the best job of like providing that very comforting,

1214
01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:01.660
smooth.
What?
Road bump.
Absorbing ride.
I don't think there is a,

1215
01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:07.150
I suppose a new s class Mercedes on the smallest world and tires.

1216
01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:08.710
It's getting close,

1217
01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:11.980
but I don't think it's as good as it should be or could be real cause of the,

1218
01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:14.890
because of the way they have to have the large wheels.

1219
01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:17.390
And also a lot of it is legislation.
So they need like,
you know,

1220
01:06:17.391 --> 01:06:19.480
lane changing ability 150 miles an hour.

1221
01:06:19.481 --> 01:06:22.630
If you're going to have a lane change at one 50 to pass your euro whenever

1222
01:06:22.631 --> 01:06:23.464
legislation,

1223
01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:27.610
then you can't have the thing running like a 20 kilograms spring because you

1224
01:06:27.611 --> 01:06:28.480
will just rotate.

1225
01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:32.680
So I understand that it's not quite as simple as I'm as I'm portraying it,

1226
01:06:32.681 --> 01:06:36.250
but I think they've gone too far.
Uh,
if you,
if you drive a rolls phantom,

1227
01:06:36.251 --> 01:06:40.150
which is conventionally probably the best luxury car in the world over a really

1228
01:06:40.151 --> 01:06:42.190
bumpy road,
you're still aware of the fact that you,

1229
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:43.720
and you're on a really bumpy road.

1230
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:48.870
But if I gave you a Citroen ds from 1959 or 1960 that was set up properly and

1231
01:06:50.171 --> 01:06:54.880
drove over the same road,
you would be more comfortable in the citron.
Wow.

1232
01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.580
So,
so we've,
we've gone backwards in terms of comfort.

1233
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:59.320
What a fantastically boring subject.

1234
01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:03.490
An s class recently when I was in Washington DC and I loved it.

1235
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:06.130
I think it's good.
The new one or the old one,
new one,
brand new one,

1236
01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:08.980
and I was thinking,
I've never thought about owning an asset class,

1237
01:07:08.981 --> 01:07:10.750
but I rented this for a weekend.

1238
01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:13.940
Me and a friend of mine did some gigs down there and we were driving around his

1239
01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:18.580
thing.
I'm like,
this is something I can get used to.
It's so comforting.

1240
01:07:18.581 --> 01:07:22.180
It's like floaty,
like you chill out,
you get out of it,
you feel relaxed.

1241
01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:23.800
It's a very important distinction.

1242
01:07:23.801 --> 01:07:28.801
I think that you do find a level of just Karma and you are more relaxed.

1243
01:07:29.591 --> 01:07:31.000
I think you're a better road user.

1244
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:34.060
I find myself just being kinder and I tend to be,

1245
01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:37.000
I try to be kind on the road or you know,
but you're in an s class,

1246
01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:41.530
you've nothing to prove your plutocratic.
You probably own the business,
you know,

1247
01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:41.970
you,

1248
01:07:41.970 --> 01:07:46.030
you sit in there and you view the world as a series of poorer people than you,

1249
01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:49.720
and you're quite comfortable with your position and you always drop into

1250
01:07:49.721 --> 01:07:51.730
character,
don't you,
when you're in these cars,
even if they're not yours.

1251
01:07:51.731 --> 01:07:55.030
I find myself doing that.
And,
and because of that you say,

1252
01:07:55.031 --> 01:07:56.650
of course you can pull out in front of the,

1253
01:07:56.651 --> 01:07:57.910
in front of me at the junction or you,

1254
01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.070
I don't care if you want to pull out in front of me there or,

1255
01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:01.650
or duck and you just go ahead and do it.

1256
01:08:01.651 --> 01:08:05.230
Cause I'm in an Escalade and the world's good around me and I've done a 1.6

1257
01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.320
Honda civic then you know,
fuck you,
I'll fight you.

1258
01:08:08.590 --> 01:08:13.540
I'm not you cause your massive.
Um,
but I uh,
no,
I think,
I think the s class is a,

1259
01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:17.420
is a work of art and it's remarkable that generation on generation,

1260
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:21.880
it remains the market leader.
It's almost in a market of its own.
You know,

1261
01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:26.570
if you want a car in that space,
you'd tend not to buy anything else.

1262
01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:30.590
Even that pretty fantastic.
It's pretty fantastic.
I mean I've driven the,

1263
01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:34.670
I used to have an older BMW seven series and I really liked it a lot.

1264
01:08:34.671 --> 01:08:39.340
It was very comfortable.
What year was that to see the final one?

1265
01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:43.430
2007 yes.
It was a bangle one.
Yeah,
it was very nice.
It's very comfortable.

1266
01:08:43.431 --> 01:08:45.920
Nice understated.
You know,
I liked it because it was,

1267
01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:49.100
it didn't attract a lot of attention but as a very comfortable car had some

1268
01:08:49.101 --> 01:08:52.760
weird massage thing where like lift your butt up and down some sort of a weird

1269
01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:57.761
way and that it was designed to never let your body sit in one position.

1270
01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:01.970
So you never got numb legs I guess.
What engine did it have?

1271
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:06.970
Five liter I do not remember was at seven 45 or seven 50 wheelbase.

1272
01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:12.360
Uh,
I don't remember.
That's it.
I love the luxury concept,

1273
01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:15.580
the luxury cars and re matter what engines and as long as it goes,
what are you,

1274
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:16.690
that's a weird thing about the,

1275
01:09:16.730 --> 01:09:21.110
the Benz is this AMG thing where they have the AMG s class,

1276
01:09:21.111 --> 01:09:25.640
the s eight,
the 63 and then the 65 which is a,

1277
01:09:25.641 --> 01:09:27.980
which is kind of weird.
It's like,
you know,

1278
01:09:27.981 --> 01:09:32.981
now you have this twin Turbo v eight monster fucking rocket engine inside this

1279
01:09:34.611 --> 01:09:39.320
giant luxury car that he's supposed to be just sorta chillaxing it.
Yeah,

1280
01:09:39.321 --> 01:09:42.470
it's a way,
but I went all the way to Frankfurt and back from the UK.

1281
01:09:42.471 --> 01:09:46.220
It's quite a long drive in uh,
in one of those,
in an s 63,

1282
01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:48.200
it's a magnificent vehicle.

1283
01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:53.260
Well that's 63 is actually one 10th of a second faster zero to 60 then the 65

1284
01:09:53.690 --> 01:09:57.140
yeah,
the 65 fits perfectly into the category I was describing earlier,

1285
01:09:57.141 --> 01:09:59.720
which is make something stupid and then just name your price.

1286
01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:00.770
That's why they do that,

1287
01:10:00.771 --> 01:10:03.920
because the kind of the type of customer that walks into a,

1288
01:10:03.921 --> 01:10:08.921
showed them to buy a 65 doesn't want the 63 because it's not the most expensive

1289
01:10:10.401 --> 01:10:11.330
and they just walk in and say,

1290
01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.210
I want the most expensive one and [inaudible] job to provide,

1291
01:10:14.211 --> 01:10:18.500
to provide the hyperbolic statement and that has to be the twin Turbo v 12 which

1292
01:10:18.501 --> 01:10:21.920
is inferior to the 63 in every way.
Of course,
it is hard,
right?

1293
01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:26.810
It's the same with the g 65 you know,
the g 65 is largely unusable,
but,

1294
01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:28.580
but if you're,
you know,

1295
01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:31.310
if you're Russian Geezer with a lot of money and you're living in London,

1296
01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.350
you don't want to turn up to your mates and go,

1297
01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:35.180
I didn't get the most expensive one.

1298
01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:38.960
Well that g 65 that g wagon is such a shit box.

1299
01:10:38.961 --> 01:10:43.850
It's just a weird fucking bread truck.
Like a mailbox truck.
I like,

1300
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:46.640
I like the normal one that these are one is great.

1301
01:10:46.641 --> 01:10:49.640
The diesel one is a proper car that you can use.
And they go,

1302
01:10:49.641 --> 01:10:51.950
they'll go off road property,
they've got three deaths you can lock,
you know,

1303
01:10:51.951 --> 01:10:53.450
there's no lines,
a proper car.

1304
01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:57.880
So it was like to the level of a Land Rover defender,
which is sort of shape I,

1305
01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:00.440
we'll go places to defend the,
couldn't hope to go cause yeah,

1306
01:11:00.441 --> 01:11:03.860
cause it's got three lockable diffs so if you put the right tires on a g wagon,

1307
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:08.090
they're really proper.
Whereas the Land Rover,
it doesn't have that.
Um,

1308
01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:12.470
uh,
but the moment you start sticking,
you know,
AMG engines in them,

1309
01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.280
I mean the 60 is ridiculous,

1310
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:17.820
<v 0>but it deserves celebration for that.
Um,
just the,</v>

1311
01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:20.870
the trash and controlled triggers so early on and as the ESP,

1312
01:11:20.871 --> 01:11:23.940
so you go and you could turn it into a corner of what you think is moderate

1313
01:11:23.941 --> 01:11:27.120
speed.
All the lights flash up and yes,
bonkers.

1314
01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:29.070
We had a good day out and one of those in Germany,
actually,

1315
01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.710
I wonder what car gets used.

1316
01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:36.150
One car that has massive off road capabilities gets used the least off road.

1317
01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:40.830
It might be the Lexus,
that big Lexus,
which is the,

1318
01:11:40.831 --> 01:11:44.410
the very comfortable version of the lane.
The of the,
the toilet.

1319
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:49.210
These are what we call the Amazon.
The v eight.
Yeah.
It could be that 70,

1320
01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:53.910
I think they're amazing off road.
Oh yeah.
And,
and of course the,

1321
01:11:53.911 --> 01:11:56.100
the saying goes in Africa that you,
um,

1322
01:11:56.580 --> 01:12:01.050
you use a land rover to go into the desert and you use a land cruiser to come

1323
01:12:01.051 --> 01:12:03.060
out that does it because,
because you know,

1324
01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:04.940
you'll never see a Landrover products in,

1325
01:12:04.941 --> 01:12:08.160
in central Africa because they just don't sort of last,

1326
01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:12.650
well that was the thing with the Taliban that all of,
uh,

1327
01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:14.610
what's Osama bin Laden's people,

1328
01:12:14.611 --> 01:12:18.060
they all drove around and Toyota land cruisers and they were like,

1329
01:12:18.061 --> 01:12:21.210
this is like the ultimate endorsement of the land cruise.

1330
01:12:21.210 --> 01:12:22.860
These people that are involved in the war,

1331
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:25.500
how does Toyotas Press Department deal with that?

1332
01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:30.300
How do you spin something positive from that when they all had snorkels on them

1333
01:12:30.301 --> 01:12:34.450
and the whole deal via [inaudible] it doesn't really work,
does it?
No,

1334
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:38.760
no,
they're,
they're remarkable things.
But then all,

1335
01:12:38.970 --> 01:12:42.470
all motorcars really,
um,

1336
01:12:42.690 --> 01:12:47.100
beyond the most basic utilitarian hatchbacks.
And you know,

1337
01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:52.130
city cars tend to have a series of abilities or um,

1338
01:12:55.230 --> 01:12:55.441
yeah,

1339
01:12:55.441 --> 01:13:00.441
I suppose engineering solutions that are so far and above what the end user will

1340
01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:05.400
actually need.
And you find that in all areas,
you know,
and,

1341
01:13:05.401 --> 01:13:09.480
and I trade in that personally and I,
that's probably what owns in my living.

1342
01:13:09.481 --> 01:13:10.314
If I was to,

1343
01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:15.090
to sort of drill down into what it is that might be it because you give me a new

1344
01:13:15.091 --> 01:13:18.840
m three and I would go on a track for the video and we'll rinse the tires and

1345
01:13:18.841 --> 01:13:21.840
drive it sideways at 90 miles an hour and do all this other stuff.
But you know,

1346
01:13:22.170 --> 01:13:25.950
if anyone buys the car,
but the,
how many people actually do that with?

1347
01:13:25.951 --> 01:13:30.140
It's so few,
but they like to know it can do it.
Right.
Um,

1348
01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:33.430
and I think that's the point you're making with the off road thing.
You know,
why,

1349
01:13:33.431 --> 01:13:38.431
why do people buy the Super Duper Range Rover that's $180,000 and see pictures

1350
01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:41.340
of it in the desert,
but they're never going to do it.
But no,

1351
01:13:41.341 --> 01:13:45.090
they love knowing it can and then like getting into it with their mates and they

1352
01:13:45.091 --> 01:13:48.630
can point at the button that shows the desert logo and then the Cactus logo.

1353
01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:51.810
What was the cat?
I love the Cactus logo.
So I've got an old,

1354
01:13:51.811 --> 01:13:55.230
I've got a the last range over the three to two with the Va supercharged in it.

1355
01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:57.300
I just love it.
It's just the nicest thing.

1356
01:13:57.650 --> 01:14:00.690
I would never go off road at night cause I want to scratch it.
And um,

1357
01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:04.440
but it's got a button,
it's got a cactus on it.
It's like my kids,

1358
01:14:04.441 --> 01:14:06.210
I love the way kids feel that one of my kids just said.

1359
01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:11.070
So is that just in case she drive into a cactus?
I was like,
I'm going to answer,

1360
01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:15.460
but probably yes.
I didn't know what it does.
Um,
so yeah,
the,
the,

1361
01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:20.520
the abilities of all of these vehicles so far outstrip what most people do.

1362
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:25.850
Um,
and pontificate about the future because it's kind of a silly situation where

1363
01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:29.050
worried the horsepower wars,
like the American cars especially,

1364
01:14:29.051 --> 01:14:32.890
there's a challenger Hellcat that has 707 horsepower.

1365
01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:37.480
I drove it recently when I was in Denver.
Amazing,
amazing car.

1366
01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:39.250
Sounds fantastic.

1367
01:14:39.251 --> 01:14:43.630
It's very comfortable for an American car and it's sixty four thousand sixty

1368
01:14:43.630 --> 01:14:46.120
five thousand dollars.
I just sold credible bargain.
Jay Leno,

1369
01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:48.850
she's got one and it was parked there and I,
yeah,

1370
01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:50.860
I don't want to talk about it already because I have not driven one in

1371
01:14:50.861 --> 01:14:53.260
everyone's driven when I'm the only person on the planet is not driven to eat

1372
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:58.240
fucking hell cats.
So I was going to fun.
It's fun car.
The,

1373
01:14:58.270 --> 01:15:03.160
the horsepower race
will probably continue for a bit.
Um,

1374
01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:04.990
I think there's a,

1375
01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:08.920
I think the engineers are a little bit diemel pappy because they might now

1376
01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:11.170
finally be viewing the end of the internal combustion engine.

1377
01:15:11.530 --> 01:15:16.210
BMW made an announcement or someone from BMW last week I think said that,

1378
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:17.470
um,

1379
01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:20.710
they can see another 10 years of internal combustion engines and officer that we

1380
01:15:20.711 --> 01:15:24.170
might be straight into electric or at the very least you'll,

1381
01:15:24.190 --> 01:15:26.730
you'll ice,
um,

1382
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:32.070
might just be a range extender that supports a platform that's broadly speaking

1383
01:15:32.681 --> 01:15:37.330
electric.
So if we've got 10 years left,
you know less,
let's go for it.

1384
01:15:37.890 --> 01:15:41.940
Um,
almost bucket list style.
And I think that we,

1385
01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:46.090
I think we're beginning to see elements of that in what's going on.
Um,

1386
01:15:46.930 --> 01:15:51.930
but I also think that that accessible horsepower is just ripe at the moment.

1387
01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:54.370
People are making big power figures and able to warranty it.

1388
01:15:54.371 --> 01:15:55.780
That's what it comes down to really.
You know,

1389
01:15:55.781 --> 01:15:59.590
I think we would have had 700 horsepower cars many years ago if people could

1390
01:15:59.591 --> 01:16:03.820
have genuinely warrantied the engines to that power and not had them blow up.

1391
01:16:03.821 --> 01:16:07.600
But they can do it now reliably.
You've also got some,

1392
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:12.280
a lot of electronic systems,
so you can,
you can kind of insert your own,

1393
01:16:12.281 --> 01:16:15.520
to come back to that phrase,
the a phrase I use,
net usable horsepower.
You can,

1394
01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:16.570
you can insert that really,

1395
01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:19.360
I mean a hell cats probably got three it pat actually when you're driving it

1396
01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:21.550
because they have two keys.
Exactly.

1397
01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:26.190
So one of them gives you like Farleigh I believe it knocks down to 500.
Yeah,

1398
01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:31.170
just only 500.
I mean stick isn't it?
Um,
so yeah,

1399
01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.440
I think the future's going to be exciting.
I think it's worried me for a while.

1400
01:16:35.441 --> 01:16:37.930
I don't much like electricity.
Um,

1401
01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:42.010
having once twiddled what I thought were two speaker wise when I was about eight

1402
01:16:42.011 --> 01:16:44.500
and they turned out to be just plug straight into the mains and come out of the

1403
01:16:44.501 --> 01:16:47.020
back of a plug.
And I've got a massive electric shock.

1404
01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:49.720
And ever since then I've had a healthy disregard for electricity.

1405
01:16:49.721 --> 01:16:51.980
I think it's quite dangerous stuff.
Um,

1406
01:16:51.981 --> 01:16:56.500
and it's silent and it's lacking in passion and um,
I don't like it.

1407
01:16:56.530 --> 01:16:58.620
I like,
I like burning gasoline.

1408
01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.750
I hate to say that I do and I think we do it increase in new clever ways,

1409
01:17:02.170 --> 01:17:05.770
but it's coming.
It's really,
it's here to stay whether we like it or not.

1410
01:17:05.771 --> 01:17:08.920
And I think people like you and I are going to have to decide very soon whether

1411
01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:10.160
we can carry on being

1412
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:13.460
<v 3>current [inaudible] without burning fossil fuels.</v>

1413
01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:16.030
Have you fucked around with any of the Teslas or anything like that?
Go?

1414
01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:18.680
Not In the new one.
No one's is amazing that you won.

1415
01:17:18.681 --> 01:17:23.360
But the four wheel drive one,
no panties,
60 in two seconds.
I mean,

1416
01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:27.860
I,
and I,
I'm,
I've had to go in the,
at least based sports car they did early on,

1417
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:31.700
which was remarkable.
I mean it just the talk and the thrust of the little ass.

1418
01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:35.120
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you know,
of course it would do about 40 miles on a charge.

1419
01:17:35.121 --> 01:17:36.980
I didn't really see the point in that ridiculous.

1420
01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:40.430
The balance of having all the batteries are back horrible.
You couldn't,

1421
01:17:40.431 --> 01:17:41.860
it was dangerous.
I thought I just,

1422
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:46.350
it was difficult to manage old Porsche Matt style or no,
that's,

1423
01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:48.800
we'll get onto that in a minute.
That the whole porch things in their faith,

1424
01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:52.310
they're really good.
They're just about managing where the weight is.
Um,

1425
01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.930
so I think the,
I think the future is actually quite bright.
Uh,

1426
01:17:56.931 --> 01:18:00.590
the I eight BMW was the thing that made me the most excited of all the things

1427
01:18:00.591 --> 01:18:01.820
I've driven this year.
I got,

1428
01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:06.680
I approached the gate with a heavy dose of cynicism.
I thought,

1429
01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:08.470
God,
is this the future?
I mean,

1430
01:18:08.490 --> 01:18:10.820
if you concentrate on it and you'll never be able to unsee this now it looks

1431
01:18:10.821 --> 01:18:12.170
like it's shitting out a nine one one.

1432
01:18:12.171 --> 01:18:16.880
It'd be seen that look at the back of it and you'll think it's doing a pool of a

1433
01:18:16.881 --> 01:18:20.570
nine one one and you'll never unsee that.
So I've ruined it for you now.

1434
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:22.780
But it's such a clever calm and it,

1435
01:18:23.150 --> 01:18:27.200
it somehow takes electricity and fashions it into something that's fun to drive.

1436
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:31.550
Great to be in this clever,
you know,
that's the future.
I'll embrace that.

1437
01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:34.280
It's not exactly what I want.
I want to just be in a Hellcat.

1438
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:37.580
I want to be in an rs.
But if you're telling me I can't have that,

1439
01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:40.850
then I need to find a solution and I think I can live with that.

1440
01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:44.720
And Electricity has its upsides,
you know,
it gives you vast amounts of Torque,

1441
01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:48.600
which is really nice.
On the road talk is what matters on the road,
not power.
Um,

1442
01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:54.170
so I get,
I I think that I'd have gears.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
I think it's,

1443
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:58.040
I think the future's really quite,
really quite bright and we've,

1444
01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:02.720
we've got a passion that can continue for quite a long time.
There it is.

1445
01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:06.810
Um,
there you go.
Look at that.
If you look at the back of it or you needed,

1446
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:10.400
is that a wide angle lens?
That's a super wide on it.

1447
01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:12.620
Just trying to find better view

1448
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.823
<v 4>down.</v>

1449
01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.280
<v 3>You need a square one from the rear.
Yeah.</v>

1450
01:19:21.281 --> 01:19:22.810
You can sort of see that left that white one.

1451
01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:27.170
<v 4>Yeah,
that's what I see.
Can you see that?
You see</v>

1452
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:35.450
<v 3>there's two lights there.
Oh,
I see what you're saying.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.</v>

1453
01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:37.430
It doesn't vary.
Shitting out of nine 11

1454
01:19:40.170 --> 01:19:45.020
does.
Yeah.
That's ugly.
I don't like all the colors.

1455
01:19:45.650 --> 01:19:47.390
No,
it's a,
it's a cool thing.
I haven't,

1456
01:19:47.410 --> 01:19:50.660
but we tested it here whenever it was earlier in the year and it went from an in

1457
01:19:50.661 --> 01:19:54.800
and out burger in it and parked it up and turning up like a rock star.

1458
01:19:54.801 --> 01:19:58.190
I could've been in a pink f 40 and people would have ignored me cause that was

1459
01:19:58.191 --> 01:19:58.641
there.
It was,

1460
01:19:58.641 --> 01:20:03.641
what do you think about these BMW cars that are adding sound that disturbs me on

1461
01:20:05.330 --> 01:20:10.110
and coming through the speakers that emulates this,
the sound of an engine.
I've,

1462
01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:13.170
I've taken a lot of shit for this cause I've people feel I've been a bit soft on

1463
01:20:13.171 --> 01:20:17.730
it.
I don't really mind too much.
The,
the m three is the,

1464
01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:18.960
is the guilty as party,

1465
01:20:18.961 --> 01:20:23.640
the new one cause gotten in line six and they sort of augmented the noise.
Um,

1466
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.770
and he do get some speaking noise that comes at you.
But again,
is that optional?

1467
01:20:28.771 --> 01:20:31.230
Can you shut it off?
I think you probably can play with it a bit,

1468
01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:34.200
but the really weird one is there's a Renno in the UK where you can choose your

1469
01:20:34.201 --> 01:20:36.990
noise so you're in a false that into what happy you and you can make it sound

1470
01:20:36.991 --> 01:20:40.020
like a Gtr or a v eight or something.
That's really,
really,
yeah.

1471
01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:43.050
That's just odd that,
that's disingenuous.
Um,

1472
01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:47.400
so I'm not too,
I'm not too hard on it.
I,
I'm,

1473
01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:52.460
I've always been more about the dynamics of these things and the moment that you

1474
01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:56.790
start to get too caught up in the noise in an era where turbocharging is going

1475
01:20:56.791 --> 01:20:57.481
to be the norm,
you know,

1476
01:20:57.481 --> 01:21:01.160
you can forget about normal aspiration really from now on.
Um,

1477
01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:02.850
there'll be a few last bastions of it,

1478
01:21:02.851 --> 01:21:07.850
but the new four or five eight will be turbocharge.
Um,
yeah,

1479
01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:12.690
the moment you get to hit up with noise,
I think you're in trouble.

1480
01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:16.430
I think you could find things to not enjoy about cars.
Um,

1481
01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:18.810
noises it is,
it's so,

1482
01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:23.160
it's so important but that you apply a turbocharger and you totally bollocksed

1483
01:21:23.161 --> 01:21:27.150
that intake noise and then really all you can do is fit loud exhaust.

1484
01:21:27.151 --> 01:21:31.830
And I think I love about your car is that the intake and exhaust to quite close

1485
01:21:31.831 --> 01:21:34.740
together,
the two noises blend together to give you something really,

1486
01:21:34.741 --> 01:21:35.700
really special.

1487
01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:39.300
But it's the intake noise on your car but is actually what does it for me,

1488
01:21:39.301 --> 01:21:43.410
it's what I'm hearing in the car.
And that is all the top of the engine.

1489
01:21:43.411 --> 01:21:46.910
That's all where it's coming in.
That's where it's breathing in the exhaling bit.

1490
01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:51.120
You're leaving all that behind.
Right?
So I am,
I'm one for more intake,

1491
01:21:51.121 --> 01:21:55.250
noise in cars,
give me proper intake noise.
Um,
and I think that's what they're,

1492
01:21:55.251 --> 01:21:58.860
they're going to do more and more is they've gone down this route of faking the

1493
01:21:58.861 --> 01:22:02.910
noise and they'd been,
broadly speaking,

1494
01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:07.050
not,
not getting a great response from people.
So what,

1495
01:22:07.051 --> 01:22:09.900
I think it will start doing his tubing noise directly into the cabin and some

1496
01:22:09.901 --> 01:22:12.480
people have tried it,
Mclaren have done it and I think for did it as well.

1497
01:22:12.630 --> 01:22:15.360
Will you just take a little chew right off the top of the engine by the intake

1498
01:22:15.370 --> 01:22:19.500
is and just feed it into the cabin.
It's quite clever.
Um,
but yeah,

1499
01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:23.430
noise is very important for me,
but it's so important that if it's not right,

1500
01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:26.580
I almost want to just forget about it and not get too involved in the,

1501
01:22:26.610 --> 01:22:29.460
in the discussion that what you need to know about the n three is just brilliant

1502
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:33.120
and it's just a great car.
Um,
and they didn't really need to do that.

1503
01:22:33.150 --> 01:22:36.420
The m five is even weirder.
We'd been in a new m five or what the current hand?

1504
01:22:36.421 --> 01:22:37.111
Five.
Well,

1505
01:22:37.111 --> 01:22:41.040
that's strange because the noise that makes fluctuates with the speakers,

1506
01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:44.250
so it sounds like a different car at different points in the rev range,

1507
01:22:44.251 --> 01:22:49.251
but at low revs it sounds like a four cylinder because of the firing order of

1508
01:22:49.261 --> 01:22:50.010
the engine.

1509
01:22:50.010 --> 01:22:53.790
And then when you get up at a little bit it starts to sound like a Subaru

1510
01:22:53.850 --> 01:22:57.570
Impressa.
So it sounds like a flat fall.
And then when you go a bit further,

1511
01:22:57.571 --> 01:23:01.800
it sounds a bit more like an Audi quatro.
Sounds like an ERC,
quatro,

1512
01:23:01.801 --> 01:23:02.790
a five cylinder,

1513
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:07.360
and then at the top end starts to sound a bit like an old [inaudible] 39 m five

1514
01:23:07.361 --> 01:23:09.100
v eight which is strange.

1515
01:23:09.130 --> 01:23:12.310
And I think it really harms the personality of the car because it's a shape

1516
01:23:12.311 --> 01:23:16.810
shifter.
It has these four different sound personalities and you don't really,

1517
01:23:17.170 --> 01:23:19.570
you don't really engage with any of them.
You just think,
well that's weird.
Oh,

1518
01:23:19.571 --> 01:23:24.010
it's in,
it's being a quattro at the moment.
What about the m six grand copay?
Oh,

1519
01:23:24.011 --> 01:23:27.070
that's a car,
isn't it?
July?
Like,
it looks like a monster.
I love the way it looks.

1520
01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:32.260
I like it better than this.
The the two door,
four door grand pay looks.

1521
01:23:32.261 --> 01:23:36.490
It just has like a personality that the two door,
it looks goofy.
You know,

1522
01:23:36.491 --> 01:23:40.060
it's like there's some two door cars that used to be afforded or like I love the

1523
01:23:40.061 --> 01:23:43.960
two door s class.
There's the new ones love new.
It's amazing.

1524
01:23:43.961 --> 01:23:45.130
It looks like a spaceship.

1525
01:23:45.131 --> 01:23:48.400
I mean it looks really incredible but there's something about the m six it's

1526
01:23:48.401 --> 01:23:50.830
always been kind of goofy look into so you don't like the new one.

1527
01:23:51.130 --> 01:23:55.420
I liked the grand coupe.
Pay The floor,
not the coop.
I don't mind.

1528
01:23:55.470 --> 01:23:59.930
Yeah I don't mind the coop.
I I think the grand pay is just elegant,
gorgeous,

1529
01:23:59.950 --> 01:24:01.360
low riding.
I mean if you,

1530
01:24:01.361 --> 01:24:05.830
if you asked me what I thought a modern Jaguar big saloon car should be,

1531
01:24:05.831 --> 01:24:09.850
I might almost give you a picture of the m six grand coupe cause it is just got

1532
01:24:09.851 --> 01:24:13.030
that sort of low seating position.
Low roof line,

1533
01:24:13.390 --> 01:24:17.770
impossibly long loads of power.
Interiors.
Yeah.
Great to drive as well.

1534
01:24:17.771 --> 01:24:19.960
I'm in the fizzle rosters.
Fuck we did.

1535
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:23.680
I think we did 8.6 to 100 miles an hour in it.
That's just,

1536
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:28.230
that's just crazy.
We did a drag race against all the other competition.

1537
01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:30.880
It just mauled all of the AMG.
Yeah.
It's really fast.

1538
01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:34.550
Very efficient transmission in that,
that,
how about this?
The ride quality?
Um,

1539
01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:38.410
too much.
Obviously he doesn't tense.
But then two,
two,
two,
four p for me.

1540
01:24:38.411 --> 01:24:40.000
But you shouldn't ask me about the two things.

1541
01:24:40.001 --> 01:24:43.600
You shouldn't ask me about riding a ride quality because I expect really good.

1542
01:24:43.601 --> 01:24:47.500
Right.
I don't think ride and handling are,
um,
you know,

1543
01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:53.440
I don't think they are
separate entities.

1544
01:24:53.441 --> 01:24:55.780
I think they,
I think you can have one on the other.

1545
01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:58.150
I think they're absolutely workable.
You know,

1546
01:24:58.151 --> 01:25:00.520
it has to be managed by electronics though.
Well,
no,
he just,

1547
01:25:00.521 --> 01:25:02.470
it's just expensive suspension components,
you know.

1548
01:25:02.471 --> 01:25:04.720
The fact is that the bits that you don't see on a car,

1549
01:25:04.721 --> 01:25:09.340
the bits they don't spend money on.
So the damper unit on,
uh,
on,
uh,
and sexy,

1550
01:25:09.341 --> 01:25:12.760
probably not that expensive.
You know,
if you took it to a rally team and said,

1551
01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:14.560
what would you do with it?
They'd just laugh at you and go,

1552
01:25:14.561 --> 01:25:17.590
we'd fit proper damper to at first so you can,
you know,

1553
01:25:17.591 --> 01:25:19.810
the green car that we come back to,
that port on 11 we built.

1554
01:25:19.810 --> 01:25:23.410
The whole point was it had this suppleness about it had world rally car dampers

1555
01:25:23.411 --> 01:25:26.290
on it.
So it was from and supportive when you needed it to be.

1556
01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:30.160
And then the moment that you wanted to go over a rough road,

1557
01:25:30.161 --> 01:25:33.130
it had lots of compliance and wheelchair,
but it was lovely.
Um,

1558
01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:36.100
so that's the one thing that has me about ride because I'll bore you for fucking

1559
01:25:36.190 --> 01:25:39.130
hours about ride and,
and looks to come back to what you just said,

1560
01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:42.400
I can't judge a cars looked publicly privately.
I can,

1561
01:25:42.401 --> 01:25:44.380
I can tell you what I think is nice,
nasty,

1562
01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.240
but I'm not the arbiter of what looks good.

1563
01:25:46.330 --> 01:25:50.020
You can see I'm wearing a yellow t shirt that costs a pound by just don't give a

1564
01:25:50.021 --> 01:25:52.450
fuck about the way I look.
And I just,
I therefore,

1565
01:25:52.451 --> 01:25:54.970
I don't think I have the right to judge the way things look.

1566
01:25:54.970 --> 01:25:58.310
I can tell you to like,
I mean subjectively you'll,
you look at uh,

1567
01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:01.420
a grand cool pay.
That's a beautiful quote I do myself.

1568
01:26:01.450 --> 01:26:05.360
I think it's a lot better looking than the m four I within my,
within my trade.

1569
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:10.250
It's not valid for me to say this car is a great looking car.
Why not?

1570
01:26:10.251 --> 01:26:13.700
Because it's up to the individual and I said to you,
to me,
yeah,
of course.

1571
01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:18.050
To me that's fine.
My,
my opinion's valid to me I think on aesthetics,

1572
01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.180
but you know,
there are people out there,

1573
01:26:19.181 --> 01:26:22.130
the thing that the Panto as to it looks good and they're there.

1574
01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:25.180
They have every right to think that.
I mean,
I think the property,

1575
01:26:25.190 --> 01:26:28.310
a friend who loves the AMG station wagon.
Yeah.

1576
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:32.890
I mean he wants to get one.
Which one?
The big one doing.
I Dunno,
the clause.

1577
01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:35.240
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know which one it is.
I like,

1578
01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:39.980
I quite like those sort of wagon is just so cool.
See,
I love wagons.

1579
01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:43.460
Wow.
I've got an rs six wagon.
Yeah.
I,
that's why I drive.
I drive an io six.

1580
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:45.650
Why wouldn't you?
It's just the coolest thing because I've got,

1581
01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:49.310
I've got a big dog and I've got three kids,
so I couldn't have an rx seven.

1582
01:26:49.311 --> 01:26:52.500
It wouldn't be confused.
I don't mind an SUV.
Do you don't like it?

1583
01:26:52.690 --> 01:26:56.600
I don't like wagons.
I'm,
I'm leaving because
I think

1584
01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:02.480
in the church they call that schism.
Um,
so I love wagons.

1585
01:27:02.690 --> 01:27:06.050
I love the,
I love combining all those disciplines in a car.

1586
01:27:06.051 --> 01:27:07.470
I liked the fact that my Rsx,

1587
01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:12.320
we'll go on a photo shoot and chase a Mclaren p one for two days pretty well
too.

1588
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:15.890
And then on the way back it will go and collect three kids from school.

1589
01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:19.550
And then after that I'll stick the dog on it and we'll go up into the hills and

1590
01:27:19.551 --> 01:27:24.110
go for a walk.
So I like multidisciplined cars.
So if I look at,

1591
01:27:24.111 --> 01:27:27.520
go back to the portfolio of cars,
if you left me with one car,

1592
01:27:27.521 --> 01:27:31.580
it'd be an Rsx at the moment.
Yeah,
because,
because it just,
the new one,

1593
01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:35.360
the old one was terrible.
The new one.
Brilliant.
I just think it's genius.

1594
01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:39.560
What do you think of uh,
the um,
the Audi a s eight.

1595
01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:42.950
The new one?
Yes.
I have not driven the new one,

1596
01:27:42.951 --> 01:27:47.720
but it's got I think which engines the new s eight got some retarded amount of

1597
01:27:47.721 --> 01:27:48.051
power.

1598
01:27:48.051 --> 01:27:52.670
I think it's got the same engine that I've got in my rs six 570 horsepower or

1599
01:27:52.671 --> 01:27:53.504
something.
Yeah.

1600
01:27:54.010 --> 01:27:59.010
That these VW group enters is difficult to keep a track on where they are coming

1601
01:28:00.231 --> 01:28:03.920
from,
what power they've got.
I think it shares the Bentley engine,

1602
01:28:03.921 --> 01:28:06.740
so the engine in my rs six and they've gables.

1603
01:28:06.741 --> 01:28:09.740
The whole powertrain is straight out of the Va Bentley continental gt,

1604
01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:13.660
but it's miles better than it is in the Bentley I think.
Really?
I don't know.

1605
01:28:13.670 --> 01:28:15.880
It just seems to work better.
Suits the carpet.
I Dunno.

1606
01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:19.850
Maybe the calibration is better.
I can't answer that really.
I think,

1607
01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:25.040
yeah,
the essay to fight driven and this is the thing,

1608
01:28:25.041 --> 01:28:26.020
I'm not getting old and I am,

1609
01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:28.430
I is my brain sometimes I can't remember what I've driven.

1610
01:28:28.431 --> 01:28:30.770
Sometimes we're having so many cars,
something will come up and say,

1611
01:28:30.771 --> 01:28:31.680
do you remember the whatever and ever,

1612
01:28:32.450 --> 01:28:35.780
have you driven the s class Mercedes s class coupé yet?
No,

1613
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:38.850
we're doing that in January,
the 63 as well.
It looks amazing.

1614
01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:40.430
I think that's a beautiful looking car.

1615
01:28:40.431 --> 01:28:43.270
One of the best cars I've ever made as far as looks.
It's incredible.

1616
01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:45.740
And the interiors amazing now.

1617
01:28:45.741 --> 01:28:49.580
I think in some ways it kind of defeats the purpose of the s class and not have

1618
01:28:49.581 --> 01:28:52.880
a usable backseat.
It kind of has one,
but you know the,

1619
01:28:52.881 --> 01:28:56.540
the feet are going to be bunched up in the ride quality.

1620
01:28:56.541 --> 01:28:59.850
I'm sure it's probably pretty similar,
but it's not the same length wheelbase.

1621
01:28:59.950 --> 01:29:03.390
Right,
but that car can,
that can stomach a slightly for them.
A ride can't,

1622
01:29:03.391 --> 01:29:06.480
it's a different purpose.
It's a gt car more.
Yeah,
I think so.

1623
01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:10.050
And apparently the story behind the rear seats was they just did a customer

1624
01:29:10.051 --> 01:29:11.790
clinic and said,
how many of you use the rear seats?

1625
01:29:11.791 --> 01:29:13.080
People that buy our cars and they all went,

1626
01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:15.240
we just lift the sea and throw a bag in the back.

1627
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:16.920
That's what we do with the seats.
They went,
okay,

1628
01:29:17.010 --> 01:29:21.570
we'll just not have receipts then really it's just a classic piece of customer

1629
01:29:21.571 --> 01:29:21.890
clinic.

1630
01:29:21.890 --> 01:29:25.050
And he could be very dangerous when you customer clinic cars cause you can't

1631
01:29:25.051 --> 01:29:28.470
fuck things up is known in the past.
Like the five,
seven,
five Ferrari.

1632
01:29:29.250 --> 01:29:34.080
That was a fucked up five 50 because it,
they went to the customers and said,

1633
01:29:34.081 --> 01:29:35.880
so you've all got five fifties,
how would you know,

1634
01:29:35.881 --> 01:29:38.730
what do you want in your new car when we,
if we're doing a new one,

1635
01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:41.610
I'm not saying we're doing anyone,
but if we do a new one,
what would you like it?

1636
01:29:41.611 --> 01:29:43.330
And they all said,
well,
um,

1637
01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:47.850
we want these paddles because your f one drivers have got them and they're

1638
01:29:47.851 --> 01:29:48.301
really cool.

1639
01:29:48.301 --> 01:29:52.650
So we won the paddles and we want more power when we come out of the pay homage

1640
01:29:52.651 --> 01:29:56.090
in San Rafael.
We want more pay powered on your fast and,

1641
01:29:56.270 --> 01:30:00.390
and also the five 50 quite bumpy,
you know,
when we're on road.

1642
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:01.800
So can need to make it less bumpy.

1643
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:05.410
And so what Freud did was they gave it a paddle shift.
Um,

1644
01:30:05.730 --> 01:30:10.110
and they gave it low more power and talk and they softened the hell out of it to

1645
01:30:10.111 --> 01:30:11.340
make it a bit more comfortable.

1646
01:30:11.730 --> 01:30:15.900
And of course the thing was just fucking undrivable cause it,
it was so loose,

1647
01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:18.750
it wasn't,
didn't have nice ride,
it just had a lack of control.

1648
01:30:18.751 --> 01:30:21.660
And the first time we drove it honors of Welsh be road,

1649
01:30:22.030 --> 01:30:23.220
we just ripped the front of the car off.

1650
01:30:23.221 --> 01:30:27.340
It just kept bottoming out and it just tore the front off the car.
So,
um,

1651
01:30:27.490 --> 01:30:30.870
a Freud didn't like that.
Um,
and then in light of what we said about it,

1652
01:30:30.871 --> 01:30:34.530
I remember,
and then about five months later having said to us,

1653
01:30:34.531 --> 01:30:37.110
we don't listen to what you say,
you'll just journalists,
our customers know best.

1654
01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:40.460
They um,
they have,
they announced this thing called the fear on OPAC,

1655
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:44.340
which was like upgraded springs dampers and just fixed all of the problems.

1656
01:30:44.341 --> 01:30:46.170
I want a manual gearbox option as well.

1657
01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:49.980
Well you went from having a Porsche Rs,

1658
01:30:49.981 --> 01:30:53.250
the 4.0 and then you went,
did you get a five,
nine,
nine?

1659
01:30:53.330 --> 01:30:55.710
I had to figure out a five,
nine.
I mean,
that's,
that goes down in history,

1660
01:30:55.711 --> 01:30:58.140
doesn't it as possibly the worst financial move ever.

1661
01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.630
I couldn't believe you did that.
First of all.
First of all,

1662
01:31:00.631 --> 01:31:03.540
get rid of like one of the greatest Porsche's ever.

1663
01:31:03.570 --> 01:31:05.820
We agreed we weren't going to talk about that.
It's just not fair.

1664
01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:08.100
It's just not fair.
You can't remind me of that.
That's like saying,

1665
01:31:08.250 --> 01:31:11.280
it's like me saying yes to,
you know,
your girlfriend was Heidi Klum or something,

1666
01:31:11.290 --> 01:31:13.200
isn't it?
They remind me of that.

1667
01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:17.040
You got rid of one of the greatest cars ever that's worth so much money now.

1668
01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:20.580
That's the crazy thing,
right?
How much are they worth now?

1669
01:31:20.670 --> 01:31:25.290
I saw one for sale for 275,000 American.
Oh,
they're worth much more than that.

1670
01:31:25.530 --> 01:31:30.240
Yeah.
In the UK they're worth well over $350,000.
Wow.

1671
01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:32.960
Um,
so I did a right out of mine.
Hey look,
I,

1672
01:31:32.961 --> 01:31:36.870
I take a very philosophical view about this stuff.
I got to own a 40 TRS.

1673
01:31:37.530 --> 01:31:40.830
I did things with it that not many people that own fully is,
have done.

1674
01:31:40.831 --> 01:31:42.570
I did big journeys.
I used it a lot.

1675
01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:46.350
There's a video of it still up on youtube of it being driven in a completely

1676
01:31:46.351 --> 01:31:50.160
ludicrous manner.
That was my car.
Um,
it made me money.

1677
01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:54.330
That was a pretty nice thing to happen.
And at the time I didn't have any money,

1678
01:31:54.410 --> 01:31:58.170
you know,
I bet the House on that thing I used the last bit of cash,

1679
01:31:58.171 --> 01:32:01.870
I had to put the down,
I didn't meet the finance criteria from Porsche,

1680
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:04.690
so I had to beg,
steal and borrow to get them to lend me the money.

1681
01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:09.190
And then the payments were well over £1,000 a month and I wasn't earning much

1682
01:32:09.191 --> 01:32:12.520
money at the time,
so I couldn't really afford it.
I sort of kept going for,

1683
01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:16.230
I think we had it for a year and a bit and then I just had the set age.

1684
01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:20.080
It was just basic economics.
I couldn't afford the finance.
But then after that,

1685
01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:22.960
about six months after that,
I started earning a bit more money.

1686
01:32:22.961 --> 01:32:26.080
I had a couple of contracts that were quite good.
I had a bit of money.

1687
01:32:26.081 --> 01:32:28.690
And of course the medical condition means the moment you've got money,

1688
01:32:28.691 --> 01:32:30.370
you go straight out and buy a car,
don't you?

1689
01:32:30.490 --> 01:32:35.280
I didn't need a five nine nine it was absolute nonsense.
It cost me a fortune.

1690
01:32:35.290 --> 01:32:36.190
I lost a load of money.

1691
01:32:36.191 --> 01:32:38.530
I'm probably lost half the money I'd made on the port in it,

1692
01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:41.110
but I'd always wanted a five nine nine I,

1693
01:32:41.111 --> 01:32:45.190
I'm I view life is a series of boxes to tick.
Okay.

1694
01:32:45.490 --> 01:32:47.530
And it's quite binary.

1695
01:32:47.531 --> 01:32:51.250
It's just a series of ones and noughts and that's what I want to do.

1696
01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:54.910
And the 42 box has been ticked.
I don't,

1697
01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:58.750
I don't really derive any pleasure from sitting and telling a room full of

1698
01:32:58.751 --> 01:33:02.770
people that I've got a 42 IRS.
I wouldn't,
I derive pleasure from driving it.

1699
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:07.570
But once I had driven it quite a bit,
I can't kind of done it,
you know,
and I'm,

1700
01:33:07.630 --> 01:33:09.550
I'm lucky in that I can kind of use them to the,

1701
01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:11.230
to the full extent of their abilities.

1702
01:33:11.231 --> 01:33:13.750
That's a nice thing to know that you can do that.

1703
01:33:13.751 --> 01:33:16.990
You've driven a 42 IRS to 100% of his ability as a nice thing to know.

1704
01:33:17.230 --> 01:33:19.810
And I'd done that.
And then I thought I quite like a five,
nine,

1705
01:33:19.811 --> 01:33:20.920
nine and then I had had the five,
nine,

1706
01:33:20.921 --> 01:33:24.310
nine for a year and realized that it was actually just too big and too fast for

1707
01:33:24.311 --> 01:33:24.821
UK rose,

1708
01:33:24.821 --> 01:33:28.450
but I tick that box and then the next box to tick was probably a five 12 tr or

1709
01:33:28.451 --> 01:33:32.620
something like that or an m three or uh,
there's just so much out there.

1710
01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:35.140
It's a bit like walking into a bookshop.
You need to know where to start.

1711
01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:40.360
And I love that about the subjects I've got caught endlessly fascinating and

1712
01:33:40.361 --> 01:33:42.210
looking for the next thing that I want to enjoy.

1713
01:33:42.250 --> 01:33:45.210
I've got a massive problem with Mercedes 500 ears at the moment.
You know,
the,

1714
01:33:45.211 --> 01:33:48.010
the old w one two four shape from the,
from the early nineties.

1715
01:33:48.011 --> 01:33:49.870
I W I will end up really?
Yeah,

1716
01:33:49.871 --> 01:33:52.570
I'll end up having one of those in the next six months because I just can't help

1717
01:33:52.571 --> 01:33:54.970
it.
I mean there's a few things that will remain permanent in my life.

1718
01:33:54.971 --> 01:33:58.870
I'll never sell that to CV cause it's just so cool.
Um,

1719
01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:01.280
and also financially I can probably afford,
you know,

1720
01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:03.220
if I get to the stage where I have to sell the two CV,

1721
01:34:03.221 --> 01:34:05.530
I'm fucked it so badly that I'm over anyway.

1722
01:34:05.650 --> 01:34:08.590
I'll keep my m five my eight 28 and five,
I wouldn't ever sell that.

1723
01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:13.990
And I think everything else,
86,
one of the very early ones,
a squared off one.

1724
01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:17.710
Um,
I think everything else is for sale always.
I don't,

1725
01:34:17.770 --> 01:34:22.180
I don't feel I've got a two oh five little little citron,
sorry,

1726
01:34:22.181 --> 01:34:24.890
a little Persia.
That is a worth no money at all.

1727
01:34:24.891 --> 01:34:27.400
But I think I'd struggle to get rid of that.
Everything else is for sale.

1728
01:34:27.670 --> 01:34:30.370
Always will be.
And,
and it as for sale at a loss.

1729
01:34:30.371 --> 01:34:33.250
If I need to move on to the next thing to,
to have a go,

1730
01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:38.460
I'm just starting to develop a thing for two generations ago is m three not the

1731
01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:43.330
last one,
which I have.
I have,
I have,
I know the Va,
I have the v eight one,

1732
01:34:43.450 --> 01:34:47.200
but the one before that,
the 46 333 horsepower one,

1733
01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:49.570
that's the car that I think if you,

1734
01:34:49.630 --> 01:34:54.630
if you wrote down all the disciplines that an m three needs needs to be good at,

1735
01:34:54.850 --> 01:34:56.350
that's probably the best one they ever made.

1736
01:34:56.680 --> 01:35:00.050
I think some respects is nicer than the Va.
It's a beautiful car too.

1737
01:35:00.051 --> 01:35:03.740
I love the shape of it.
It's a classic shape,
understated but very nice.

1738
01:35:03.741 --> 01:35:05.780
And it's so you can find out a nice,

1739
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:10.870
a nice face lift car with the face lift dash with the big sat nav and the 18

1740
01:35:11.181 --> 01:35:15.410
inch wheels or smaller wheels and a manual obviously get rid of those paddles.

1741
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:19.170
And I think that then is,
that's a seriously lovely car.
And did you,

1742
01:35:19.171 --> 01:35:23.960
you didn't get the CSL here,
did you?
Um,
which ones that don't think you did.

1743
01:35:23.961 --> 01:35:27.080
They did a special lightweight car which didn't come here actually get that a

1744
01:35:27.081 --> 01:35:30.080
carbon roof.
Um,
carbon intake,
bit more power,

1745
01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:35.570
full track with pilot Sport Cup standard.
And they launched in o three o four.

1746
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:39.170
They're now very valuable.
They're going up.
That's a really nice car.

1747
01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:44.360
Type in m three CS.
The death of the manuals are often talked about subject,

1748
01:35:44.361 --> 01:35:48.050
but it kind of an important one because when we're talking about sound being

1749
01:35:48.051 --> 01:35:50.240
important,
like sound in a car like that,

1750
01:35:50.241 --> 01:35:54.770
but shifting your own gears is important too.
There's something that's missing.

1751
01:35:54.771 --> 01:35:55.460
I have the,

1752
01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:59.580
my BMW is a double clutch and I like it cause the traffic cause allies,

1753
01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:02.690
traffic's brutal.
It's a good car to just,
it's my commuter car,

1754
01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:07.530
but there's something missing.
Something really missing.
Yeah,
that's it.

1755
01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:08.840
If you get the rear shot of it,

1756
01:36:08.841 --> 01:36:12.830
you'll see it had a special boot lid with a sort of kicked up ducktail on the

1757
01:36:12.831 --> 01:36:16.760
boot.
So really,
really good looking car.
You look at,
there you go.

1758
01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:18.610
Yeah,
that's different.

1759
01:36:18.650 --> 01:36:22.580
Oh I have seen those stuff at the back and they're really special.

1760
01:36:22.650 --> 01:36:25.760
You know the man,
the manual gearbox is very,
very interesting.

1761
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.960
Manual in America is very common and it's almost all,

1762
01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:32.420
all the big sports cars in America,

1763
01:36:32.421 --> 01:36:36.290
whether it's a corvette or the z 28 they all have manual options.

1764
01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:41.060
The new Mustang there,
the Shelby gt three 50 that's coming out.

1765
01:36:41.061 --> 01:36:44.090
That will be a manual as well.
Um,
I think burrs,

1766
01:36:44.210 --> 01:36:48.200
I think the world owes the u s a debt for still wanting manuals over here.

1767
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:50.870
Without you guys wanting them,
there'd be a lot less.

1768
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:53.840
You've also had some cars 50 with manual transmissions that we haven't,

1769
01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:56.480
so being there'll be m five over here you can buy as a shifter and the

1770
01:36:56.490 --> 01:36:59.280
[inaudible] and the m six,
but we can't,
there's just us only they,

1771
01:36:59.281 --> 01:37:01.860
even the grand coupe pay is available as a stick.
I know.
And that's,

1772
01:37:01.861 --> 01:37:05.270
I suppose horses.
Oh,
okay.
The manual thing I could talk about for too long.

1773
01:37:05.271 --> 01:37:08.180
So I'll try and be brief as you can tell.
I get a little bit of a kid stuff.

1774
01:37:08.181 --> 01:37:11.090
So can we brief,
okay.
So the,
the first,

1775
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:14.510
the first point is that the manual gearbox is wonderful.

1776
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:17.550
It's an integral part of driving,
controlling the vehicle,
um,

1777
01:37:18.230 --> 01:37:21.020
your buisiness behind the wheel,
the things that you're active doing.
You know,

1778
01:37:21.021 --> 01:37:22.510
one of the most important is,

1779
01:37:22.511 --> 01:37:26.960
is shifting gear and the process of learning to shift gear properly of healing

1780
01:37:26.961 --> 01:37:29.390
and towing of,
of,
of controlling a vehicle.
That's,

1781
01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:31.400
that's something very personal between you and the machine.

1782
01:37:31.401 --> 01:37:34.700
It's something that you can take pride in.
Um,
and I love that.

1783
01:37:34.730 --> 01:37:36.500
I think that's integral to driving.
However,

1784
01:37:36.710 --> 01:37:39.470
if you live in La and you're stuck in traffic,
I wouldn't have a manual.

1785
01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:41.630
I'd want an automatic.
So it's horses for courses,
isn't it?

1786
01:37:42.090 --> 01:37:45.410
If I'd say for your hobby car,
for the car that you enjoy it.
Weekends,

1787
01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:47.810
I can't see why you'd ever want anything other than manual.

1788
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:51.110
I think you'd be a bit of a masochist if you want to just sit in a traffic jam

1789
01:37:51.111 --> 01:37:55.110
in a manual nine,
nine,
seven turboed heavy clutch,
just be horrible.
Um,

1790
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:59.820
but the manual gearbox and the future of it,
it's an interesting subject.

1791
01:38:00.150 --> 01:38:05.150
I think that the manual gearbox is and is going to be a bit like vinyl records.

1792
01:38:07.410 --> 01:38:11.490
So vinyl records have suddenly exploded in sales.
You've been reading about that.

1793
01:38:11.550 --> 01:38:14.580
So everyone's back into vinyl.
There's always been a subculture that I was vinyl.

1794
01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:16.950
I am,
I've always been one of those are quite like a bit of vinyl.

1795
01:38:16.951 --> 01:38:20.460
I like the sound.
I like just like the tactility of it all.
It's lovely.

1796
01:38:20.461 --> 01:38:22.680
And also reminds you of when you were a kid going to buy an album,
doesn't it?

1797
01:38:22.681 --> 01:38:27.210
It's lovely.
Um,
and I think the manual gear box is going to be a bit like that.

1798
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:29.040
So what's going to happen is you'll see this,

1799
01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:34.340
it will be continued to phase out and manufacturers will make fewer and fewer of

1800
01:38:34.741 --> 01:38:37.890
them and then someone's going to go,
do you know what?
I can see a market here.

1801
01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:41.490
We can make a limited run of manual whatevers.
So if the,
if,
if,

1802
01:38:41.491 --> 01:38:44.520
say Porsche took the nine one one gt three and they've said publicly,

1803
01:38:44.521 --> 01:38:46.920
that's one of the big cars that everyone wants a manual gearbox in.

1804
01:38:47.610 --> 01:38:50.580
But they didn't give one did,
they just gave paddles only and everyone said,

1805
01:38:50.581 --> 01:38:53.130
the commentators said that no one's going to buy it.
It's not a manual.

1806
01:38:53.131 --> 01:38:56.400
Of course they sold every gt three.
They could,
I can make,
um,

1807
01:38:57.210 --> 01:38:58.650
but if feel if porter turned around and said,

1808
01:38:58.651 --> 01:39:02.450
we're going to make a limited run of manual gearbox gt three,

1809
01:39:02.490 --> 01:39:06.230
but they're going to be $100,000 more than the standard car and we're only going

1810
01:39:06.231 --> 01:39:09.090
to make 500 of them,
they'd sell them overnight.

1811
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:10.920
They just would sell them overnight.

1812
01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:13.530
You just know they would because there's enough people out there.

1813
01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:16.560
And I think what will happen is that they will be a kind of,

1814
01:39:16.590 --> 01:39:20.060
there will be a subculture of manual transmissions and know and some money for

1815
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:21.870
how many fractures will endorse it and some won't.

1816
01:39:22.050 --> 01:39:24.120
But I think you'll find that if the numbers stack up,

1817
01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:27.180
what if they turned around and said,
we could engineer a manual gearbox for,
uh,

1818
01:39:27.450 --> 01:39:31.380
for the new four,
five,
eight Ferrari,
but it's going to cost you $150,000 more.

1819
01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:35.190
Exactly.
Really it's just market forces.
If,

1820
01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:38.790
if they can create a business case for doing it,
they will do it.

1821
01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:40.350
I just cannot understand why they haven't,

1822
01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:42.330
I can understand why they haven't released the four or five,

1823
01:39:42.331 --> 01:39:45.150
eight and the GT three.
I just don't understand it.

1824
01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:49.740
So many people want it in a manual.
Two things.
It's um,

1825
01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:51.560
it's economies of scale there.

1826
01:39:51.570 --> 01:39:54.960
These are small volume products and they require quite expensive good

1827
01:39:54.961 --> 01:39:55.531
transmissions.

1828
01:39:55.531 --> 01:39:59.070
You can't just bolt in your kit gearbox that you've got in five other models,

1829
01:39:59.071 --> 01:40:01.740
you know,
you,
you've got to have a proper transmission and they're expensive,

1830
01:40:01.741 --> 01:40:03.780
proper transmissions.
Um,
and its emissions.

1831
01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:06.630
It's a big problem with the missions because you,
when you,

1832
01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:08.810
the admissions cycle certainly in,
in,

1833
01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:12.660
in Europe are there a bit of a con everyone knows what you've got to be doing at

1834
01:40:12.661 --> 01:40:15.060
certain points in the rev range and how you can cheat your way around it.

1835
01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:18.090
And if you've got a seven or eight speed dual clutch transmission,

1836
01:40:18.091 --> 01:40:19.110
that shifts itself,

1837
01:40:19.170 --> 01:40:22.920
you can really work the cycle beautifully to get some very clever results for

1838
01:40:22.921 --> 01:40:25.410
your emissions.
Whereas if you've got a manual is much,

1839
01:40:25.411 --> 01:40:28.290
much more difficult to get the results.
So you,

1840
01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:31.860
you tend to that they play slightly fast and loose with the rules and that's why

1841
01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:35.300
it's,
it's as much the mission space as it is cost base.

1842
01:40:36.510 --> 01:40:40.020
So I think we'll probably lose them a bit again.
Okay.

1843
01:40:40.050 --> 01:40:44.300
This I'd greet manual gearboxes in with vinyl and chronometer in a sort of

1844
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:45.940
standard wine up chronometer watchers,
you know,

1845
01:40:46.050 --> 01:40:49.920
in the 80s who had a chronometer watch.
No one did the day,
you know,
and um,

1846
01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:51.720
but suddenly they were back in fashion.
Now aren't they?

1847
01:40:51.721 --> 01:40:56.500
People want watches that cost 10,000 pounds and don't actually keep time.
Yeah,

1848
01:40:56.501 --> 01:40:59.140
there's soccer cute.
I can see,

1849
01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:04.090
I think the manual gearbox will become a sort of art and product that certain

1850
01:41:04.091 --> 01:41:06.910
brands will buy into and we'll supply you at a cost.

1851
01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:10.060
I'm secretly hoping that the IRS has an a manual option.

1852
01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:14.110
You want to be disappointed?
I don't know for sure,
but I can,
yeah,
it's not,

1853
01:41:15.550 --> 01:41:18.820
it's too expensive for a series of cars,
you know,
it's not going to be there.

1854
01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:20.320
Have you got your name down for one?
I don't know.

1855
01:41:20.410 --> 01:41:22.660
And also I would want it to be a six speed.

1856
01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:26.550
I think that the seven speed is from everything that I've heard.
Seven.

1857
01:41:26.770 --> 01:41:27.790
It was goofy.
Yeah.

1858
01:41:27.791 --> 01:41:31.390
The original seven speed manual in the nine on one is bad to the point where I'd

1859
01:41:31.391 --> 01:41:33.040
actually have a PDK car I think.

1860
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:36.350
And even though I always would want a manual nine 11 I didn't like the seven

1861
01:41:36.351 --> 01:41:41.230
speed.
However,
they've just reengineered the seven speed in the new 901 gts,

1862
01:41:41.231 --> 01:41:42.910
which they launched last month.

1863
01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:47.230
And everyone I've spoken to who I trust says it's totally transformed.

1864
01:41:47.231 --> 01:41:49.750
The new seven speed is proper.
They've made it good.

1865
01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:51.790
So what was missing in the old one,

1866
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:54.850
but it was the shift quality wasn't very nice cause what they did is they

1867
01:41:54.851 --> 01:41:59.560
basically packed a manual transmission into the PDK case.

1868
01:41:59.590 --> 01:42:03.820
So it's effectively a PDK that you're operating manually was not just not Jill

1869
01:42:03.821 --> 01:42:08.020
clutch,
but it's in the same case.
And that meant that the shift was a bit funny.

1870
01:42:08.021 --> 01:42:10.240
So the first and second planes were,
we're good.

1871
01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:14.690
Second and third was fine once you,
so second,
third,

1872
01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:18.580
first and second was fine.
Second and third and fourth were fine.

1873
01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:22.660
But when you got to fifth and sixth it was slightly off angle.

1874
01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:27.070
It wasn't quite right.
So fifth to sixth sick was back towards you a bit.

1875
01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:30.670
If you're in a left hand drive car and then seventh was a way and up,

1876
01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:35.700
it wasn't quite symmetrical and therefore if you wanted to go seventh back to

1877
01:42:36.311 --> 01:42:38.950
fifth and just pop it back and let the spring then put you up into fifth you

1878
01:42:38.951 --> 01:42:43.600
didn't always get fit or weren't always quite sure where it was you could do and

1879
01:42:43.601 --> 01:42:45.850
sick God,
this is a proper geeky conversation,
isn't it?

1880
01:42:46.090 --> 01:42:49.840
And sick for seventh to sixth was quite unsatisfactory,
a shift.

1881
01:42:49.841 --> 01:42:51.970
It was sort of had a resistance to it.

1882
01:42:51.971 --> 01:42:56.050
Now I think they've probably got them all straightened out and it's much more

1883
01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.660
precise and decisive.
They've not driven it,

1884
01:42:58.661 --> 01:43:02.980
but everyone loves the shift quality of life.
The Boxster,
the Boxster,

1885
01:43:02.981 --> 01:43:06.480
and the Cayman being the six speed.
Like why talk writing isn't it?

1886
01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.570
It's talking to those.

1887
01:43:07.571 --> 01:43:11.850
Those gearboxes are probably at the limit of talk and also the obviously the,

1888
01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:14.740
the other way around it,
it's a,
it's a mid engine car.

1889
01:43:14.741 --> 01:43:15.940
The gear box is on the other side,

1890
01:43:15.941 --> 01:43:20.020
so you can't just bolt it on their design course.
They could do it.

1891
01:43:20.021 --> 01:43:21.220
They that it's just the money thing.

1892
01:43:21.670 --> 01:43:26.670
It's just a money thing really just seems so wrong to have an rs and only have

1893
01:43:27.341 --> 01:43:29.140
panel shift.
What do you think to the shift on your car?

1894
01:43:29.141 --> 01:43:33.250
Cause some people prefer the slightly longer slicker shift of the Cayman and the

1895
01:43:33.251 --> 01:43:37.780
box to the IRS.
It's quite Nachi the IRS gearbox,
I dunno.
It's perfect.

1896
01:43:38.230 --> 01:43:41.740
Whatever it is.
It's just every time I drive another car I drive that car.

1897
01:43:41.741 --> 01:43:43.720
I'm like,
this car is like the most tactile,

1898
01:43:43.721 --> 01:43:47.920
the most connected car I've ever driven.
It's just so fun.
I just love it.

1899
01:43:48.150 --> 01:43:51.950
Is it heavily modded jaws?
Chassis wise?
Yeah.
It's pretty modded.

1900
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:56.210
<v 1>Yeah.
It's a little lower.
A little stiffer,
but it's just,
it's so awesome.</v>

1901
01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:57.920
It's the best car I've ever owned.

1902
01:43:57.950 --> 01:44:01.050
502 did you do with the engine in it when you bought it?
WHATSAPP.

1903
01:44:01.090 --> 01:44:04.090
Do you have the engine done?
What was it?
Did He,
no,
I had it done.

1904
01:44:04.110 --> 01:44:08.960
I saw obviously the painful question.
How much is d something for the whole deal?

1905
01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:14.030
Yeah.
You see a buy an rs for a hundred plus and then he sent it to him and spend

1906
01:44:14.031 --> 01:44:17.570
another 60 on it.
So they modify your existing engine or was it new engine?

1907
01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:20.780
It's the existing engine is a 3.6.
Yeah.
He take it out.

1908
01:44:20.781 --> 01:44:23.360
It takes it out and pours it out and the whole deal,
it takes a few months.

1909
01:44:23.630 --> 01:44:25.850
I'm going to have headers put on it now and that will bump it up.

1910
01:44:25.851 --> 01:44:29.900
Another 18 horsepower.
You who changed the sound a little bit?
It

1911
01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:34.820
did it feel noticeably quicker.
Straight away.
Uh,

1912
01:44:34.821 --> 01:44:36.530
I didn't even buy the 3.6.

1913
01:44:36.531 --> 01:44:39.940
I know I bought the 3.6 and headed immediately sent to them.
I never drove it.

1914
01:44:39.941 --> 01:44:44.810
I never touched it.
I had a gen two gt three,
the standard a gt three.

1915
01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:48.320
Uh,
I really enjoyed it.
But then I found out about the,
um,

1916
01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:51.200
the RS shark works car and I was like,
I gotta have one of those.

1917
01:44:51.201 --> 01:44:54.320
So you sold the Gen two,
3.8 and then bought the water.

1918
01:44:54.530 --> 01:44:58.490
Had it immediately sent to Alex at chark works.
Have you driven the 4.1 yet?

1919
01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:01.460
I've not driven either that or engines.
Everyone says their sensation.
Good Golly,

1920
01:45:01.461 --> 01:45:05.570
Miss Molly.
The 3.9 that I have is amazing.
The 4.1,
it's just another,

1921
01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:10.020
so I'm coming back end of January.
Can we go?
Yes.

1922
01:45:10.030 --> 01:45:13.880
We'll go and I'll set it up on the Twitter.
So I see him on the Twitter.

1923
01:45:13.881 --> 01:45:15.890
He's a great guy.
You'll love Alex.
He's awesome.

1924
01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:19.430
He'll be here on the ninth on uh,

1925
01:45:20.210 --> 01:45:24.890
uh yeah.
On January 9th they're coming to La.

1926
01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:28.160
What about,
so they based 0.1,
he's in northern California,

1927
01:45:28.161 --> 01:45:29.690
like up near South San Francisco.

1928
01:45:29.691 --> 01:45:34.100
So that Friday the 9th of January that coming down.
Matt Farris going to be here.

1929
01:45:34.101 --> 01:45:37.200
If you guys still get along by then.
We don't always get to that.

1930
01:45:37.460 --> 01:45:39.640
But this drive thing we'll get,
well I thought,

1931
01:45:39.650 --> 01:45:41.780
what can I have a cigarette and then we'll have a chat about the drive thing.

1932
01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:45.230
Sure.
Yeah.
Is that all right?
Yeah.
What time is it?

1933
01:45:45.231 --> 01:45:47.090
Four 30 you can have a cigarette in here if you like.

1934
01:45:47.091 --> 01:45:50.320
We'll just turn on the air filter.
We have a felt just disgusting.
It's okay.

1935
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:55.810
People do it all the time.
Yeah.
Have one.
Yeah.
Crank that sucker up.
Aching.

1936
01:45:55.870 --> 01:45:58.990
Is that what it is?
You get that achy cigarette thing?
No,
I'm a,

1937
01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:02.270
I'm a reformed smoker who I've just lapsed a bit in the last month or two.

1938
01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:06.530
Do we have any more coffee,
Jamie?
No,
it's fine.

1939
01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:11.060
Drink does not.
Yeah.
What do you want about bubbles in it collects water.

1940
01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:12.973
<v 5>That was one that,</v>

1941
01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:18.860
<v 1>that's a weird Marlboro pack.
If they're black,
what is that?</v>

1942
01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:22.400
I think what that clicky ice blasting on them.
Oh,

1943
01:46:22.401 --> 01:46:27.210
I love that clicky ice blast.
Really strong here.
Mental.
Have you tried them or,

1944
01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:31.310
I'd be talking about menthol.
Ice Blast and you do it on demand.

1945
01:46:31.311 --> 01:46:34.430
You Click it on demand a mouthwash.

1946
01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:38.570
So you quit for how long and you got back into it.
So have a seat,
man.

1947
01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:41.310
Don't worry about it.
Yeah,

1948
01:46:43.090 --> 01:46:46.650
I'm on and off,
but I'm,
I'm no,
I've been good for ages and I shouldn't,
no,

1949
01:46:46.651 --> 01:46:48.800
he shouldn't be saying this because I don't want my children.
No,
no smokes.

1950
01:46:49.230 --> 01:46:50.070
Do you ever try to fuck

1951
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:53.340
<v 0>around with those electronic cigarettes?
No,
I can't see any point in that tool.</v>

1952
01:46:53.550 --> 01:46:57.700
The nicotine like that.
It's like a sugar free drink.
What's the point?
Yeah,

1953
01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:02.160
I like the,
I like having a beer and a fag in my hand.

1954
01:47:02.161 --> 01:47:04.320
It's just seems so natural in America.

1955
01:47:04.350 --> 01:47:08.440
It's known as a cigarette and a fag is a derogatory expression for homosexual.

1956
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:13.080
Can call it a fake.
I don't wear a fanny pack and I walk on.
I do.
I do.

1957
01:47:13.110 --> 01:47:17.880
Where am I?
What pavement or sidewalk?
Either one.
I don't give a fuck.

1958
01:47:17.881 --> 01:47:22.380
I'm American
pavements sidewalk,
whatever you want to call it.

1959
01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:26.310
Hood Trunk.
The whole lexicon of cartoons is a real problem for me because hood,

1960
01:47:26.350 --> 01:47:27.810
the,
I spend too much time in America.

1961
01:47:27.811 --> 01:47:31.940
I start calling things hoods and talking about sedans.
It's a fucking sedan.

1962
01:47:31.970 --> 01:47:35.160
It's saloon car saloon car.
Yeah.
I had to learn all that stuff.

1963
01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:39.780
And I watched your shows from top gear on.
And what about fifth gear?

1964
01:47:39.781 --> 01:47:42.400
Does anybody give a fuck about that anymore?
I'll hope so.
I'm,

1965
01:47:42.401 --> 01:47:44.480
I'm on an episode soon.
So can you give a fuck about it?

1966
01:47:45.610 --> 01:47:49.480
The tifs of legend,
the legend.

1967
01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:53.220
So Tif,
I grew up watching tiff.
You know,

1968
01:47:53.221 --> 01:47:56.130
he was probably one of the reasons we wanted to do this cause he's just mega and

1969
01:47:56.131 --> 01:47:57.660
I used to remember watching those top guests gets.

1970
01:47:57.661 --> 01:48:00.090
So he's the one that can actually drive why and the woman on the car,

1971
01:48:00.091 --> 01:48:03.420
what is the woman on the show?
She can try as well.

1972
01:48:03.421 --> 01:48:06.530
She's the only woman on car shows that they should put me as a shit goes

1973
01:48:06.531 --> 01:48:09.300
sideways around corners.
If there's any really,

1974
01:48:09.301 --> 01:48:12.240
really fast female drivers that want to do car videos that they,

1975
01:48:12.241 --> 01:48:14.970
can you drop me an email please?
Because that's the next thing.

1976
01:48:15.130 --> 01:48:19.680
Even if you could put a really good looking girl in a Mclaren p one,

1977
01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:22.980
that video wouldn't be four and a half million.
It'd be 10 million.

1978
01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:26.340
She had to wear like a bikini or she could,
no,
no,
it doesn't need to be perfect.

1979
01:48:26.341 --> 01:48:29.160
It doesn't need to be like one of those Gti videos where they've topless and you

1980
01:48:29.161 --> 01:48:32.250
know they're not hitting them in the face.
It doesn't need to be like that,

1981
01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:35.760
but just,
I think people prefer this,
the aesthetic of the woman to the man,

1982
01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:39.060
understandably so.
Of course there are better looking at us.
It's a fact.

1983
01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:43.200
Even women like the way the women look.
But I did a shoot with tiff,
so I did.
Um,

1984
01:48:43.710 --> 01:48:47.910
yeah,
that's another subject I did.
Um,
I did a sh we just done a shoot with,
with,

1985
01:48:47.911 --> 01:48:52.290
um,
with tiff for fifth gear and Jesus,
what the guy can really drive.

1986
01:48:52.290 --> 01:48:54.660
He is the real deal,
you know,
it gets in the car,

1987
01:48:54.661 --> 01:48:57.210
but he's not even driven before and the camera man says,

1988
01:48:57.211 --> 01:48:59.970
can you put it there sideways,
you know,
four feet that way.

1989
01:48:59.971 --> 01:49:03.060
And he just does it on point.
They're done.
Bang,
gone.
Can I have a coffee now?

1990
01:49:03.061 --> 01:49:03.894
Please.

1991
01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:08.400
He knows how to drive for sure that he's an absolute legend and a wicked bloat.

1992
01:49:08.401 --> 01:49:12.480
Spend time with as well.
He's,
he's,
he's,
he's the real deal.
Yeah.

1993
01:49:12.481 --> 01:49:17.170
He seems like he would be,
he's a,
he's fun as well.
And so that show,
uh,

1994
01:49:17.190 --> 01:49:19.950
is that a BBC show as well?
No,
that's not going to work then.
Yeah,

1995
01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:22.320
I think it's been,
it might be a discovery show.

1996
01:49:22.530 --> 01:49:24.060
It's been on discovery for a while,

1997
01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:26.790
but I don't think the one I did as until April or something like that.

1998
01:49:26.791 --> 01:49:29.250
But I've done,
so what I've done is they track battle with,

1999
01:49:29.430 --> 01:49:32.340
with tiff in a couple of cars,
um,

2000
01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:36.000
at Castle Combe in the UK is really,
really good fun to work with them.

2001
01:49:36.001 --> 01:49:38.970
But it sort of,
for me it was an eye opener.

2002
01:49:38.971 --> 01:49:41.820
I partly wanted to do it because I get to work with tiff.
That was,

2003
01:49:41.821 --> 01:49:46.440
if you'd said to me when I was 15 that I would shoot a sort of extreme driving

2004
01:49:46.441 --> 01:49:47.980
scene on a with

2005
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:52.480
<v 3>tiff.
I just said,
no way will that ever happen.
Um,</v>

2006
01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:55.880
and I wanted to see how the TV process works as well because we,

2007
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:59.440
we shoot a very particular way.
We're completely renegade.
I just have this,

2008
01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:02.680
you know,
Neal,
who is the guy that I shoot with is like my,
you know,

2009
01:50:03.250 --> 01:50:06.280
my fifth limb,
he's,
he's,
he's everything.
He shoots everything,

2010
01:50:06.281 --> 01:50:07.960
he edits everything.
He's a genius.

2011
01:50:07.961 --> 01:50:10.900
He's just a great guy and we're hyper efficient.

2012
01:50:10.901 --> 01:50:12.430
We don't get much time to do these things.

2013
01:50:12.431 --> 01:50:15.190
We just get given an hour and I try it normally and we'd just cobble it together

2014
01:50:15.191 --> 01:50:18.100
as quickly as possible and then fire it out there and people watch it and they

2015
01:50:18.101 --> 01:50:22.870
seem to enjoy it.
TV has more time and it's more laborious.
And I think,

2016
01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:25.600
I think TV could learn a lot from what we do.

2017
01:50:26.170 --> 01:50:29.530
And equally I think there's still some stuff we can learn from TV and hopefully

2018
01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:32.380
over the next couple of years we'll refine the process into something that can

2019
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:36.980
not only be enjoyable but earn us some money as well.
So you were,

2020
01:50:36.981 --> 01:50:39.700
you were going to have your cigarette and you were going to talk about drive and

2021
01:50:39.701 --> 01:50:41.320
for folks who don't know what's going on,

2022
01:50:41.530 --> 01:50:46.530
drives a channel that was on youtube and then drive morphed into drive plus,

2023
01:50:47.290 --> 01:50:50.640
which happened right when I filmed a,
they filmed the,

2024
01:50:50.641 --> 01:50:55.641
the shark works ones with my car and the 4.1 liter and it became a pay channel

2025
01:50:55.781 --> 01:50:59.980
drive plus became something that you paid for and the Internet revolted.

2026
01:51:00.010 --> 01:51:03.970
There was a a gigantic backlash.

2027
01:51:03.971 --> 01:51:05.080
People got very upset.

2028
01:51:05.081 --> 01:51:08.980
If you look at the comments of the drive video that I did it,

2029
01:51:08.981 --> 01:51:13.390
almost all of them were complaining about drive plus even though the drive
video,

2030
01:51:13.570 --> 01:51:16.600
there's a three,
whatever it was,
five minute drive,

2031
01:51:16.601 --> 01:51:21.220
one which was free and then at 15 minute,
whatever it was,
drive plus,

2032
01:51:21.221 --> 01:51:24.490
which you had to pay for.
Yeah.
The,
the,
the drive.
Um,

2033
01:51:25.390 --> 01:51:26.350
well this isn't really about drive.

2034
01:51:26.351 --> 01:51:28.510
This is about the Internet and this is about content and,

2035
01:51:29.100 --> 01:51:32.140
and whether people are willing to pay for it and where the content worth

2036
01:51:32.141 --> 01:51:34.000
anything.
I mean the Internet is an amazing thing,

2037
01:51:34.001 --> 01:51:38.230
but it's also deeply evil for content producers like you and I.

2038
01:51:38.580 --> 01:51:39.340
Um,

2039
01:51:39.340 --> 01:51:43.870
because it's created a precedent where people think everything should be free,

2040
01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:46.000
but there's a cost to producing stuff.
I mean,

2041
01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:49.240
understandably the overheads for us doing this or a lot less than going out to a

2042
01:51:49.241 --> 01:51:52.620
track,
hiring a track wrecking tires,
putting fuel in a car,
you know,

2043
01:51:52.621 --> 01:51:54.730
it's not a cheap process.
It costs money to do it.

2044
01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:56.860
And because it costs money to do it,

2045
01:51:57.400 --> 01:51:59.530
you need to find a way of remunerating yourself against that.

2046
01:51:59.531 --> 01:52:02.920
So you either advertise against the content and get as many views as you can.

2047
01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:07.150
And if that fails,
which has happened on Youtube now quite publicly,

2048
01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:09.040
you need to find a way of making money.

2049
01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:12.610
So you have to try and charge for the content.
So how has it,
how has it failed?

2050
01:52:12.611 --> 01:52:16.030
What happened?
Well,
I don't think it's failed actually.
It's still going.
I just,

2051
01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:19.450
I'm not part of that now because for my particular type of videos,

2052
01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:24.130
it was a struggle for me to do it because I needed to be doing a lot of views to

2053
01:52:24.131 --> 01:52:26.590
keep the car industry interest interested in what I was doing.

2054
01:52:27.070 --> 01:52:31.750
And I go from doing a couple hundred thousand views to doing 20,000 views and

2055
01:52:31.751 --> 01:52:35.230
then go back to Porsche and say,
can I drive the new rs when it comes out?

2056
01:52:35.231 --> 01:52:37.210
And they'll go,
well you need to do 20,000 views,

2057
01:52:37.211 --> 01:52:39.070
so why would you be on our list of people to drive the car?

2058
01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:42.760
So that kind of means that I struggled to get in the product and ultimately I'm

2059
01:52:42.761 --> 01:52:46.280
a product review or that's the basis of what I do.
Okay.
Broadly speaking,

2060
01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:48.860
<v 0>it's entertainment.
It's just about the skidding cars around having fun.</v>

2061
01:52:48.861 --> 01:52:53.861
And I think it's a sort of a new world now with Internet journalists that didn't

2062
01:52:54.201 --> 01:52:56.360
exist before.
I mean,
so the,

2063
01:52:56.370 --> 01:53:01.280
the numbers are essentially the only thing that justify this new world to these

2064
01:53:01.281 --> 01:53:03.890
old school businesses.
Yeah,
they,
they,

2065
01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:08.340
they view youtube as being something new and amazing and,
and rightly so.

2066
01:53:08.341 --> 01:53:10.190
And we've,
we've sold it to them as being that.

2067
01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:12.710
And then we turned around quite early in the process.

2068
01:53:12.711 --> 01:53:15.980
They've just adopted it and taken it as being something they want to be a part

2069
01:53:15.981 --> 01:53:18.980
of.
And then suddenly we're saying,
actually we can't carry on doing it this way.

2070
01:53:18.981 --> 01:53:19.820
They're not earning enough money.

2071
01:53:19.821 --> 01:53:22.010
I remember talking to someone at Porsche saying,
it must be great.

2072
01:53:22.011 --> 01:53:25.880
You must be getting a lot of dollar of you.
I'm wrong.
No,
no,
we're not.

2073
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:28.760
So that hasn't quite worked.
I think the drive,

2074
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:32.120
I think the drive plus experiment is ongoing.
I don't think it's failed.

2075
01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:34.820
And I think actually it might be,

2076
01:53:34.821 --> 01:53:37.790
I think people might view it in a couple of years time as being quite smart
move.

2077
01:53:38.290 --> 01:53:42.620
Um,
but it just wasn't smart for me within the portfolio.
So I had,

2078
01:53:42.790 --> 01:53:43.880
I had to do something about it.

2079
01:53:43.881 --> 01:53:48.290
I had to get back out there again with free to air films and find another way of

2080
01:53:48.291 --> 01:53:51.920
monetizing it.
Um,
and I think that's what I'm trying to do at the moment.
That's,

2081
01:53:51.921 --> 01:53:55.460
you know,
it's nothing evil.
It's,
you know,
so what are you doing now?

2082
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:59.300
So we've got another youtube channel which sits in its own space,

2083
01:53:59.301 --> 01:54:00.470
just called Chris Harris on cars.

2084
01:54:00.471 --> 01:54:04.250
And I'm just putting my normal films out of the way I used to for free.
Um,

2085
01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:07.970
but I've got to find new ways of interacting with brands to get them to sponsor

2086
01:54:07.971 --> 01:54:10.580
the channel,
to get them to work with us and give us some money so we can,

2087
01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:13.400
we can keep it,
you know,
free to air.

2088
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:16.820
And that means everything from car brands to normal sponsorship.

2089
01:54:16.910 --> 01:54:20.930
You have a much more sophisticated sponsorship model over here.

2090
01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:26.140
People are much more willing to come and spend money around electronic content

2091
01:54:26.361 --> 01:54:27.620
in the U S and they are in Europe.

2092
01:54:27.621 --> 01:54:30.980
It's still difficult to get people to spend money around electronic content in,

2093
01:54:30.981 --> 01:54:33.230
in,
in Europe certainly is what I find.
Well,

2094
01:54:33.260 --> 01:54:34.940
the United States in the podcast world,

2095
01:54:34.941 --> 01:54:38.990
it's only been over the last three years or so that we've had advertisers that

2096
01:54:38.991 --> 01:54:41.540
are willing to get interested in it or willing to get involved.

2097
01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:45.230
And over the last year or two it's actually gotten kind of crazy where they're

2098
01:54:45.231 --> 01:54:49.580
realizing the numbers.
The numbers are just so gigantic.
They're as big,

2099
01:54:49.581 --> 01:54:52.130
if not bigger than very successful cable shows.

2100
01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:55.430
So the amount of money that they can spend to reach,

2101
01:54:55.610 --> 01:54:58.150
especially my show,
which I,

2102
01:54:58.210 --> 01:55:01.280
I personally pick and choose all the advertisers,

2103
01:55:01.281 --> 01:55:06.020
like I reject as many advertisers as I accept because I just don't want,

2104
01:55:06.050 --> 01:55:09.140
I don't believe that the product or I don't want to be involved in the product

2105
01:55:09.141 --> 01:55:12.320
or I can't see it working.
It's not something I want to support.
Whatever.

2106
01:55:12.321 --> 01:55:16.490
The reason is if I decide to get behind something like a Squarespace or whatever

2107
01:55:16.491 --> 01:55:19.190
our ads are,
I know it's a solid product.

2108
01:55:19.191 --> 01:55:23.840
I know I have no remorse whatsoever.
No guilt about about,
uh,

2109
01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:26.300
having that product,
a sponsor,
the show.

2110
01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:30.890
But this wasn't the case just a few years ago.
There was just,
it wasn't,

2111
01:55:30.891 --> 01:55:34.580
it wasn't that much.
We were doing it almost all just for fun in the beginning.

2112
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:39.650
Yeah.
I'm and I'm,
it's,
it's so much more advanced than it is in the video world.

2113
01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:42.980
I mean,
I'm now on this patrion thing,
which that's,
that's fascinating.

2114
01:55:43.010 --> 01:55:44.550
Patrion is like a donation

2115
01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:46.690
<v 3>based thing.
So when we did drug costs,</v>

2116
01:55:46.710 --> 01:55:49.590
a lot of people said a lot of the comments that came back that were,

2117
01:55:50.670 --> 01:55:53.730
were sensible.
Where were people saying,
look,
I love what you do,

2118
01:55:53.731 --> 01:55:55.060
but I don't want to subscribe.
I don't want to,

2119
01:55:55.190 --> 01:55:57.120
I don't want to feel bound into a subscription.

2120
01:55:57.121 --> 01:55:59.490
It's not something I'm comfortable with.
Have you thought of a donation?

2121
01:55:59.491 --> 01:56:03.630
And I'm thinking it's just really weird because it,
it's,
it's a,
it's a service.

2122
01:56:03.631 --> 01:56:04.441
It's a product.
You know,

2123
01:56:04.441 --> 01:56:07.740
if I go into a shop and I want to buy a copy of evo magazine,

2124
01:56:07.741 --> 01:56:10.410
I fully expect to have to pay for it.
I don't just walk into the shop,

2125
01:56:10.411 --> 01:56:12.870
pick it up and walk out again.
So,

2126
01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:15.660
so the idea of sort of donation box seemed a bit strange,

2127
01:56:15.661 --> 01:56:17.220
but I have signed up to it in the last three weeks.

2128
01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:19.560
And bless all of you out there that have contributed.

2129
01:56:19.561 --> 01:56:22.410
I mean I think it's up to about $3,000 a month is what people are willing to

2130
01:56:22.411 --> 01:56:23.740
Tonese.
Yeah.
And it's,

2131
01:56:23.860 --> 01:56:26.910
and it's carrying on and we know we're not going to play fast and loose with

2132
01:56:26.911 --> 01:56:28.770
that.
That is going to help us fund more content.

2133
01:56:28.771 --> 01:56:30.360
That's basically going to pay Neil.
So thank you.

2134
01:56:30.361 --> 01:56:34.410
Well thank you on behalf of Neal.
Is the money public the amount public like yes,

2135
01:56:34.411 --> 01:56:36.900
you can go on there and see it's all public.

2136
01:56:36.901 --> 01:56:38.250
You can go on there and see how much is being,

2137
01:56:38.251 --> 01:56:41.100
so then people can look at it and go,
oh fuck him,
he's getting 3000 a month.

2138
01:56:41.101 --> 01:56:42.510
I'm not going to give him shit.
Well,
yeah,

2139
01:56:42.511 --> 01:56:45.000
cause I mean I don't help myself to I because at the end of the day,
you know,

2140
01:56:45.010 --> 01:56:47.280
the one hand I have got a Ferrari,
I can't hide that.

2141
01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:49.050
I'm always wasting money on cars.
And then I'm saying,

2142
01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:52.470
can I have some money to help me make videos?
But that is,
you know,
in life,

2143
01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:56.850
personal cash doesn't last long in the commercial world and if you start sort of

2144
01:56:56.851 --> 01:57:00.660
applying sums of money that you can live off into video productions,

2145
01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:05.040
the two don't square with each other.
They're quite different things,
not at all.

2146
01:57:05.130 --> 01:57:07.200
Um,
so yeah,
I'm,

2147
01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:11.940
I think that the Internet video space is going to change radically over the next

2148
01:57:12.090 --> 01:57:13.020
even 12 months.

2149
01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:17.460
I think there is already a lot fewer players in there were even two years ago,

2150
01:57:17.461 --> 01:57:19.120
you know,
two years ago it was,
you know,

2151
01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:22.650
all the buff books in the u s had their video channels and we're out putting one

2152
01:57:22.651 --> 01:57:23.640
or two videos a week,

2153
01:57:23.641 --> 01:57:27.210
maybe more in some cases in motor trend were rampant doing some great content

2154
01:57:27.211 --> 01:57:30.570
and loads of it where they're doing nothing like as much.
Now,
current driver,

2155
01:57:30.571 --> 01:57:34.520
we're more cautious and didn't do quite as much,
but they're doing,
you know,

2156
01:57:34.530 --> 01:57:37.740
not so much now as well.
And I think you're gonna find a lot of players,

2157
01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:40.680
big publishers are looking at it and saying,
well,
what's in this for us?
You know,

2158
01:57:40.681 --> 01:57:43.230
we don't make any money out of it.
We're actually losing money.

2159
01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:45.740
Why are we going to carry on doing it?
Um,

2160
01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:50.730
and I think the outrage at drive going to drive plus was,

2161
01:57:50.750 --> 01:57:54.930
was simply the fact that we had allowed people to get drunk on,

2162
01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:59.940
on a product for free.
And maybe it was disingenuous as a,
at the start to say,

2163
01:57:59.941 --> 01:58:02.940
this is going to be free forever.
You know,
I just,

2164
01:58:02.941 --> 01:58:05.730
I can't see how it could be if you can't earn the money back from it and

2165
01:58:05.731 --> 01:58:08.370
advertising,
you have to stop.
It's quite simple.
Yeah.

2166
01:58:08.370 --> 01:58:10.050
That's just the thing about the internet.
If you,

2167
01:58:10.051 --> 01:58:14.770
if drive plus just have drive just went away and didn't come back as dry.

2168
01:58:14.771 --> 01:58:18.360
Plus it just became some new entity that charged money.

2169
01:58:18.570 --> 01:58:20.520
Maybe people would have a different approach to it.

2170
01:58:20.521 --> 01:58:22.800
But people get so used to things being free.

2171
01:58:22.950 --> 01:58:25.200
I know maybe that was wrong and it may make,
you know,

2172
01:58:25.230 --> 01:58:27.210
maybe we all made mistakes and I certainly,
you know,

2173
01:58:27.211 --> 01:58:28.620
I made some mistakes in the process.

2174
01:58:28.621 --> 01:58:32.730
I'm not going to go into that side of things.
Um,
but you know,

2175
01:58:32.731 --> 01:58:37.260
I don't bear any grudge to anyone is in developing it and needing money while

2176
01:58:37.261 --> 01:58:40.500
developing it.
You know,
like needing to pay a salary while development.

2177
01:58:40.501 --> 01:58:44.080
If you were independently wealthy and you were pursuing this whole thing and

2178
01:58:44.081 --> 01:58:46.840
then you would probably eventually figure out some sort of a sponsorship model

2179
01:58:46.841 --> 01:58:49.660
that would make money because the content is excellent,

2180
01:58:49.661 --> 01:58:53.500
the show is excellent and it's a matter of like just getting the right amount of

2181
01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:58.560
eyes on it to get people to sponsor it where it's a substantial amount of money

2182
01:58:58.751 --> 01:59:01.030
that can pay for production and salaries and everything.

2183
01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:02.820
It's a full distribution model as well.
That's,

2184
01:59:02.830 --> 01:59:06.620
that's actually the core flaw is that youtube is a wonderful thing.
Um,

2185
01:59:06.670 --> 01:59:08.560
and has an enormous audience,

2186
01:59:08.770 --> 01:59:13.060
but they keep such a large percentage of the revenue that comes in from

2187
01:59:13.061 --> 01:59:15.340
advertising that it's almost some workable.
I mean,
you know,

2188
01:59:15.341 --> 01:59:19.990
you're giving away 40% straight away,
um,
and the sums aren't great.

2189
01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:23.140
And of course then there's thing called the ad blocker,
which is,
you know,
if you,

2190
01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:25.420
if you dropped an alien down into planet earth and said,

2191
01:59:25.421 --> 01:59:27.180
this is the business model,
they'd say,
what's a home?

2192
01:59:27.190 --> 01:59:30.010
The minute you spend all your money making the films,

2193
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:35.310
40% leaves you straight away and there is software widely available that allows

2194
01:59:36.101 --> 01:59:40.030
people to actually block the adverts that are supporting what you're trying to

2195
01:59:40.031 --> 01:59:41.580
sell.
So,
you know,

2196
01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:45.270
you are completely taken away at the shins before you've even started.

2197
01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:50.050
Isn't it possible to do ads inside the video itself?
Yes,
but that's,
that's,

2198
01:59:50.100 --> 01:59:50.710
you know,
then,

2199
01:59:50.710 --> 01:59:54.370
then you're into slightly grey area with youtube because then they're the losers

2200
01:59:54.371 --> 01:59:55.690
because they're saying,
well,
hang on a minute.

2201
01:59:55.691 --> 01:59:58.630
If you're advertising within the show,
we don't see any of that revenue.

2202
01:59:58.631 --> 02:00:02.110
And yet we're hosting your videos.
Do they do that?
Did they say,
did they do well?

2203
02:00:02.650 --> 02:00:05.710
There are rules around it obviously,
and quite understandably so,

2204
02:00:06.010 --> 02:00:07.150
but they can't police it.

2205
02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:09.460
They'd have to watch every single video on the internet,

2206
02:00:09.461 --> 02:00:13.120
wouldn't they try and spot it.
So I think you've gotta be quite careful.
Um,

2207
02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:16.040
we'll find a way.
All of us,
I think there's,

2208
02:00:16.330 --> 02:00:20.140
what we have proven is that people like those sorts of videos and they will

2209
02:00:20.141 --> 02:00:22.300
watch them no doubt.
Um,
and we just,

2210
02:00:22.330 --> 02:00:26.170
we just have to sort of somewhere within the Patrion,
within the pay wall,

2211
02:00:26.171 --> 02:00:30.490
within youtube,
within Vimeo,
within your own Media Player,

2212
02:00:30.491 --> 02:00:34.780
within selling the content to existing networks within Netflix,

2213
02:00:34.781 --> 02:00:38.080
within southern them to airlines.
You know,
within all of that,

2214
02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:43.120
there's a way of making this work.
It just feels like it's taking a long,

2215
02:00:43.121 --> 02:00:44.590
long fucking time.
You know,

2216
02:00:44.591 --> 02:00:48.270
I've been doing this a long time and you know,

2217
02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:51.370
it doesn't really make us any money.
And at the end of the day,

2218
02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:53.020
I don't want to get super rich on it,

2219
02:00:53.021 --> 02:00:56.470
but it would just be nice for it not to be a lawfully that this year has cost me

2220
02:00:56.471 --> 02:01:00.550
money in video and I've made a loss,
a significant loss in video.
And um,

2221
02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:01.630
that's kind of shocking.

2222
02:01:01.900 --> 02:01:04.090
It's kind of shocking cause you have a huge amount of fans.
You're,

2223
02:01:04.091 --> 02:01:08.230
your videos are very popular.
If I type in,
uh,

2224
02:01:08.350 --> 02:01:12.970
Chris h a Harris comes up,
you know,
in,
in,
in Youtube,

2225
02:01:12.971 --> 02:01:16.360
like on cars like BMW and then I write Chris,

2226
02:01:16.510 --> 02:01:20.120
it gives me the option of Harris like immediately it's a very frequently search

2227
02:01:20.121 --> 02:01:22.750
term.
Like your videos are very popular.
Uh,

2228
02:01:22.751 --> 02:01:25.570
you're one of my favorite all time automotive journalists.

2229
02:01:25.571 --> 02:01:27.190
You're very entertaining your fun.

2230
02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:31.240
It just doesn't make sense to me that so many people can be enjoying you,

2231
02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:35.830
but yet you're having such a hard time figuring out a way to make it financially

2232
02:01:35.831 --> 02:01:37.660
profitable that it's actually a loss this year.

2233
02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:41.990
I'm just going to bask in the glory of his comments from it.
Um,
the,
uh,
yeah,

2234
02:01:41.991 --> 02:01:43.700
it's tough situation and I suppose you can,

2235
02:01:43.730 --> 02:01:46.910
what you could do is just sort of lock yourself in a room with a bottle of good

2236
02:01:46.911 --> 02:01:49.890
single malt and,
and go,
oh,
woe is me,
and play the violin to yourself.

2237
02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:51.620
It'll turn around.
It seems like it can't,

2238
02:01:51.621 --> 02:01:54.680
not because the content is there and the audience is there.

2239
02:01:54.681 --> 02:01:57.980
It's just a matter of figuring out a way to synchronize money out of a rock.

2240
02:01:58.010 --> 02:01:58.820
And I think it's gonna,

2241
02:01:58.820 --> 02:02:02.900
it's gonna involve a bit more time and money investment to get to that place.

2242
02:02:03.230 --> 02:02:06.290
And I don't have the answer for it,
but I'm not,
as you can tell,

2243
02:02:06.291 --> 02:02:10.430
I'm quite careful to,
to answer your,

2244
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:14.840
your phrasing of the drive plus experiment as being a failure.
I don't,

2245
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:18.200
I really don't think it is.
I think I'm going.
Yeah.
And I think,

2246
02:02:18.201 --> 02:02:20.930
I think it was a brave move,
um,

2247
02:02:21.290 --> 02:02:25.010
but it was actually the only option available to that team of people at that

2248
02:02:25.011 --> 02:02:28.460
time.
Um,
and I,
I don't think it was,

2249
02:02:28.490 --> 02:02:30.760
I don't think it was crazy at all.
And I and I,

2250
02:02:30.820 --> 02:02:33.880
I stressed that it didn't quite work well.

2251
02:02:33.890 --> 02:02:38.570
It just didn't work for me at the time and I had to make a call because at the

2252
02:02:38.570 --> 02:02:38.571
end of the day,

2253
02:02:38.571 --> 02:02:43.070
I am just a sole trader and if I'm hidden behind a pay wall and I'm not being

2254
02:02:43.071 --> 02:02:46.340
seen,
that is the biggest problem for me is silence.
Actually.

2255
02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:51.050
If I go away for six months and I disappear the Internet,
if it gets you very,

2256
02:02:51.051 --> 02:02:52.530
very quickly,
I find,

2257
02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:55.130
and I didn't want to be that person that had just disappeared,

2258
02:02:55.131 --> 02:02:56.740
it would worry me because I think then to to,

2259
02:02:56.780 --> 02:03:00.920
to sort of kickstart yourself again would take even more effort and momentum.

2260
02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:04.550
I'm not getting any younger.
I don't quite have the energy I had a few years ago.

2261
02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:08.450
I'm feeling that suddenly I'm willing to work crazy hours still,

2262
02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:10.700
but I think it just becomes a bit laborious.

2263
02:03:10.730 --> 02:03:12.920
And the really sad thing is that we're not talking about,

2264
02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:17.470
I'm not talking here about healthcare or something serious like we discussed

2265
02:03:17.471 --> 02:03:20.000
earlier.
This is not a social issue.
This is not the third world debt.

2266
02:03:20.001 --> 02:03:24.170
We're talking about reviewing fast cars in a way that's actually just roar

2267
02:03:24.171 --> 02:03:25.850
entertainment.
It's not a serious business.

2268
02:03:25.851 --> 02:03:30.680
It should be about having fun and editorial product is nothing more than the fun

2269
02:03:30.980 --> 02:03:34.280
that the people have producing it.
That's what it is.
It's an expression.

2270
02:03:34.281 --> 02:03:38.060
It's a vicarious process.
Come and enjoy what we did with this car.

2271
02:03:38.100 --> 02:03:39.950
Well that's one of the things that's great about your videos.

2272
02:03:39.951 --> 02:03:42.890
You're clearly are having fun.
Well,
you're going sideways around a corner.

2273
02:03:42.891 --> 02:03:46.900
You're laughing like a fucking banshee.
It's fine.
It's mega.
But if,
but if you're,

2274
02:03:46.910 --> 02:03:50.720
if you're approaching that with a sort of,
Oh god,
this is difficult.

2275
02:03:50.721 --> 02:03:53.750
It's costing me too much money,
all the [inaudible],
then you should,

2276
02:03:53.751 --> 02:03:56.480
I think you should just pack up and stop it and go and do something else.

2277
02:03:56.481 --> 02:04:00.060
Go and grow tomatoes or something.
You just,
you need to stop it.
Um,

2278
02:04:00.140 --> 02:04:03.170
and I don't want to get to that stage.
I,
I've,
I've,
I love what I do.

2279
02:04:03.171 --> 02:04:05.300
It's fucking brilliant fun.
It really is.

2280
02:04:05.301 --> 02:04:09.230
It just needs to be sustainable.
And I think we'll get there.

2281
02:04:09.231 --> 02:04:12.770
I think in the next year,
my youtube channel,
we'll,
we'll knock along.
Okay.

2282
02:04:13.070 --> 02:04:15.620
Well we're going to send some people to you,
Chris Harris on cars.

2283
02:04:15.621 --> 02:04:19.130
It's on youtube.
Uh,
we're out of time here man,
but thank you very much.

2284
02:04:19.131 --> 02:04:21.050
It's a pleasure meeting you.
Really fun talking to you.

2285
02:04:21.051 --> 02:04:23.370
As much fun as I thought it was going to be.
And uh,

2286
02:04:23.410 --> 02:04:26.090
thank you so much for all the videos that I've watched over the years,

2287
02:04:26.091 --> 02:04:28.610
cause I really enjoy the shit out of him.
Okay.
Thank you very much.

2288
02:04:28.611 --> 02:04:33.050
Can we continue it from the driver's seat of your car in about two,

2289
02:04:33.110 --> 02:04:37.340
two months time?
Yes,
yes,
for sure.
Good night,
everybody.

2290
02:04:37.341 --> 02:04:39.140
Much love big kiss.
See you soon.
