00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.770
<v Speaker 1>you play the music and the podcast has </v>
<v Speaker 1>come full circle experience trying to </v>

160
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.850
<v Speaker 1>get podcasts all.</v>

161
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.260
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

162
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.550
<v Speaker 1>he just died off there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your,</v>

163
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.480
<v Speaker 1>your actual real voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The podcast has come full circle.</v>

164
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.630
<v Speaker 1>You are here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was not for Opie and Anthony,</v>

165
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.340
<v Speaker 1>I doubt I would have ever thought it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be so fun to do a podcast.</v>

166
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.860
<v Speaker 1>What was it about us that made you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do this?</v>

167
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Because you guys are the first radio </v>
<v Speaker 1>show that I've ever done.</v>

168
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.860
<v Speaker 1>That is a complete hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like almost every show that I had ever </v>

169
00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:36.310
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the great ones.</v>

170
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Howard Stern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it felt like they have an </v>

171
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:41.390
<v Speaker 1>agenda like the sit down and they'll ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions and you know,</v>

172
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:46.410
<v Speaker 1>they have and they're going to control </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and they're going to move it along </v>

173
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.590
<v Speaker 1>certain lines with you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was always just to hang out.</v>

174
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.850
<v Speaker 1>You would go there and it was just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real conversation.</v>

175
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

176
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.070
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just that word lazy.</v>

177
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't understand that all of a </v>

178
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:01.900
<v Speaker 1>sudden the right way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then it became our thing,</v>

179
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to chill out and,</v>

180
00:08:02.471 --> 00:08:03.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go for it.</v>

181
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.460
<v Speaker 1>You guys doing it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspired me to do this the same way I </v>

182
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:08.460
<v Speaker 1>am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so cool.</v>

183
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.070
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>

184
00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:12.850
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't for doing your show because</v>
<v Speaker 1>every other show where someone got,</v>

185
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got interviewed on your show.</v>

186
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.370
<v Speaker 1>You just talked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

187
00:08:18.371 --> 00:08:22.270
<v Speaker 1>we could go on a show and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could just all ask anthony about guns</v>

188
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:27.420
<v Speaker 1>and that'd be a fascinating fucking show</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we could do it for an hour and a </v>

189
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:27.420
<v Speaker 1>half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour and a half.</v>

190
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.290
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's him getting warmed up as far as </v>

191
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:32.040
<v Speaker 1>that'd be three or four hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I mean.</v>

192
00:08:32.041 --> 00:08:33.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

193
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.690
<v Speaker 1>the philosophy I've always had about </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio is a philosophy about radio.</v>

194
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.580
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of egos and radio.</v>

195
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>

196
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.330
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like naming names today,</v>

197
00:08:43.331 --> 00:08:45.940
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to be the funniest guy in the,</v>

198
00:08:45.941 --> 00:08:47.920
<v Speaker 1>in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to be the most creative,</v>

199
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.550
<v Speaker 1>the most interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we took the tack,</v>

200
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:56.590
<v Speaker 1>like if you come on our show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to fucking sit back and </v>

201
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.191
<v Speaker 1>listen to what Joe Rogan has to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you come in well prepared and </v>

202
00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:02.061
<v Speaker 1>you'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you blow our mind every time you come </v>

203
00:09:02.061 --> 00:09:04.401
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I go home and I'm in among my </v>

204
00:09:04.401 --> 00:09:04.401
<v Speaker 1>friends and family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

205
00:09:04.401 --> 00:09:05.610
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a really good show today.</v>

206
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:07.680
<v Speaker 1>I get the credit in the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who gives a fuck?</v>

207
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Who the funniest guy is in the room or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the most interesting.</v>

208
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.790
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of radio guys never understood</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fucking concept.</v>

209
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:19.790
<v Speaker 1>So it goes back to your thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything has to be all right for the </v>

210
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.731
<v Speaker 1>next 15 minutes we're going to do this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we're gonna move onto the </v>

211
00:09:22.731 --> 00:09:24.390
<v Speaker 1>interview and if you get a laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to make sure I get a bigger laugh.</v>

212
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.260
<v Speaker 1>That's an exhausting way to do it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really dumb too.</v>

213
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:33.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you not want other people to </v>

214
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:33.290
<v Speaker 1>be funny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

215
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.830
<v Speaker 1>How does that make you less funny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea that your entire body of </v>

216
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 1>work that you've done up until now is </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningless.</v>

217
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:40.770
<v Speaker 1>If this other person is funnier for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>brief moment.</v>

218
00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Of course it's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

219
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:47.661
<v Speaker 1>why would you be even affected by it at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all if someone else is doing well,</v>

220
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.770
<v Speaker 1>but the business is filled with those </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

221
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.060
<v Speaker 1>It's so weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's comedy is as well.</v>

222
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:54.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

223
00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:58.170
<v Speaker 1>and they're scared of the unknown as far</v>
<v Speaker 1>as radio goes.</v>

224
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:03.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if something's going well just go with </v>

225
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.141
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they have that stupid a clock in </v>

226
00:10:06.141 --> 00:10:06.141
<v Speaker 1>their head and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

227
00:10:06.141 --> 00:10:09.130
<v Speaker 1>we only allowed 20 minutes for this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be funny or interesting and we got to</v>

228
00:10:09.131 --> 00:10:11.570
<v Speaker 1>move on to like news or some horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

229
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.580
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to go to said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just throw all that shit away and just </v>

230
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:16.580
<v Speaker 1>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

231
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.440
<v Speaker 1>We're going to read the news at noon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking thing that you have to do</v>

<v Speaker 1>whole planet thing.</v>

359
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Where earth is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

360
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:23.470
<v Speaker 1>And then it shows this and it just gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger and bigger and just blows your </v>

361
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.690
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing is everywhere.</v>

362
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.220
<v Speaker 1>But you were the first one to tweet </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

363
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

364
00:15:25.901 --> 00:15:28.980

<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

365
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Loved that video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That video is so fascinating.</v>

366
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you love it though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't creep you out.</v>

367
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

368
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:36.560
<v Speaker 1>Definitely does.</v>

369
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.920
<v Speaker 1>We had a neil degrasse Tyson Tyson on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day,</v>

370
00:15:39.921 --> 00:15:41.330
<v Speaker 1>the astrophysicist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

371
00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.520
<v Speaker 1>He was talking to us about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

372
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:46.190
<v Speaker 1>he was talking to us about the depth of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe and it just,</v>

373
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:47.840
<v Speaker 1>the way he does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

374
00:15:47.841 --> 00:15:50.930
<v Speaker 1>he's so brilliant and passionate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he describes things,</v>

375
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.170
<v Speaker 1>it's just so like there's like a theater</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it as well,</v>

376
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's such a good talker and he's</v>

377
00:15:56.211 --> 00:16:01.211
<v Speaker 1>also so fucking smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when he's talking about the </v>

378
00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:03.551
<v Speaker 1>multiverse and the idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe with hundreds of billions of </v>

379
00:16:03.551 --> 00:16:03.920
<v Speaker 1>galaxies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like almost infinite,</v>

380
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.730
<v Speaker 1>is really just one of an infinite number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of universes and he likes,</v>

381
00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.190
<v Speaker 1>it just freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can freak you the fuck out and you're</v>

382
00:16:13.191 --> 00:16:18.191
<v Speaker 1>one of these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're convinces his life all over the </v>

383
00:16:18.191 --> 00:16:18.191
<v Speaker 1>fucking place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

384
00:16:18.191 --> 00:16:19.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

385
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:24.070
<v Speaker 1>I think they've done calculations on not</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like everything in the world is a </v>

386
00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:28.070
<v Speaker 1>collection of Adam's essentially.</v>

387
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think if you understand what it is</v>

388
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:32.610
<v Speaker 1>that's your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

389
00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:37.620
<v Speaker 1>your Dorsal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they understand that if the </v>

390
00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:41.651
<v Speaker 1>universe is large enough that every </v>
<v Speaker 1>collection of atoms in exactly the same </v>

391
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.760
<v Speaker 1>collection as it is on earth will exist </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else that when you're talking </v>

392
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:53.180
<v Speaker 1>about something that's infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like literally everything that exists in</v>

393
00:16:53.181 --> 00:16:58.181
<v Speaker 1>the exact same order and the exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>objects in the exact place exist in some</v>

394
00:16:59.481 --> 00:17:03.200
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be some insane light years</v>

395
00:17:03.201 --> 00:17:05.100
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like 14 trillion,</v>

396
00:17:05.101 --> 00:17:06.260
<v Speaker 1>trillion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trillion trillion.</v>

397
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.850
<v Speaker 1>There was a into the wormhole with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

398
00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:12.440
<v Speaker 1>what's his name guys banging his </v>
<v Speaker 1>granddaughter,</v>

399
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Morgan Freeman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morgan Freeman.</v>

400
00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:18.330
<v Speaker 1>And he's the host of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like.</v>

401
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.330
<v Speaker 1>So there's another ope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

402
00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:22.640
<v Speaker 1>you have to go far enough if that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinity means.</v>

403
00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.250
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy that not only is there </v>
<v Speaker 1>another ope,</v>

404
00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.430
<v Speaker 1>but there's another jamie in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another Brian.</v>

405
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.890
<v Speaker 1>The room is another me and I wrote like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is real,</v>

406
00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:35.920
<v Speaker 1>but what kind of life you think is out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is that I think we're out exactly </v>

407
00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.020
<v Speaker 1>how we're living on earth or it or is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth?</v>

408
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>5,000</v>

409
00:17:40.281 --> 00:17:45.281
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe infinite is so crazy that </v>

410
00:17:45.281 --> 00:17:49.151
<v Speaker 1>the earth in exactly the order that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>appears here might be somewhere else </v>

411
00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:54.010
<v Speaker 1>because it's just a combination of Adams</v>
<v Speaker 1>and various states and that combination </v>

412
00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:57.240
<v Speaker 1>of animes in various states could </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely mirror in the infinite,</v>

413
00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.160
<v Speaker 1>but we have to think about what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite means,</v>

414
00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:04.440
<v Speaker 1>what the with the infinite is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible for us to conceptualize </v>

415
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.220
<v Speaker 1>that freak you out as a kid when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>started thinking about the universe and </v>

416
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:08.790
<v Speaker 1>then you were okay with the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

417
00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:11.610
<v Speaker 1>maybe it ends and there's a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how I thought of it.</v>

418
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

419
00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:15.120
<v Speaker 1>The bar says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a wall,</v>

420
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.090
<v Speaker 1>but then I started thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's on the other side of the</v>

421
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:23.091
<v Speaker 1>wall?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember being a little kid and just </v>

422
00:18:23.091 --> 00:18:23.160
<v Speaker 1>stopping and thinking for a second that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a roof,</v>

423
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.610
<v Speaker 1>there's not a roof to the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

424
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:30.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just kind of flying through </v>

425
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.871
<v Speaker 1>space and all of a sudden my law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my world went like from my point of view</v>

426
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:35.940
<v Speaker 1>to be in this is my neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where I lived,</v>

427
00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:40.960
<v Speaker 1>to what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how come nobody's talking about </v>

428
00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:40.960
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

429
00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.110
<v Speaker 1>it was really weird to be like a seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>or an eight year old,</v>

430
00:18:43.111 --> 00:18:44.910
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was when I really started </v>
<v Speaker 1>about eight.</v>

431
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:50.200
<v Speaker 1>I think it happens a around a for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone because that's about the time </v>

432
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.270
<v Speaker 1>you realize you're going to die your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

433
00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Far too scary day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I learned at eight that you </v>

434
00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:58.950
<v Speaker 1>were going to die and my parents were </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken off to go to the movies.</v>

435
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:04.340
<v Speaker 1>I just want to suck on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Mom's was so fucking scared and to </v>

436
00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:07.860
<v Speaker 1>them it was just a night out to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a life changer.</v>

437
00:19:07.861 --> 00:19:08.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

438
00:19:08.611 --> 00:19:11.310
<v Speaker 1>this fucking thing in day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

439
00:19:11.311 --> 00:19:13.440
<v Speaker 1>It was a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird night.</v>

440
00:19:13.441 --> 00:19:18.441
<v Speaker 1>I cried the first night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized that I was going to die </v>

441
00:19:18.441 --> 00:19:19.170
<v Speaker 1>someday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like six or something like that.</v>

442
00:19:19.171 --> 00:19:24.171
<v Speaker 1>I cried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really sad and that was also when </v>

443
00:19:24.171 --> 00:19:24.171
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

444
00:19:24.171 --> 00:19:25.830
<v Speaker 1>I'd already given up on religion because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a year in Catholic school.</v>

445
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Are you a Catholic guy originally?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

446
00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.240
<v Speaker 1>I did one year in Catholic school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

447
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>

448
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling my parents had run away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

449
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going.</v>

450
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Was it all boys school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

451
00:19:36.121 --> 00:19:41.121
<v Speaker 1>it was separate to separate us in class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was girls that it would have </v>

452
00:19:41.121 --> 00:19:41.910
<v Speaker 1>other classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

453
00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:43.650
<v Speaker 1>I was brought up Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not a,</v>

454
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an organized religion guy.</v>

455
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.790
<v Speaker 1>The craziest girl I ever dated was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to an all girls Catholic school.</v>

456
00:19:48.791 --> 00:19:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you believe in then?</v>

457
00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really believe in anything.</v>

458
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't not believe in anything either.</v>

459
00:19:56.371 --> 00:19:58.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you an atheist?</v>

460
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say I'm an atheist.</v>

461
00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.980
<v Speaker 1>There's something right now we just </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't.</v>

462
00:20:01.981 --> 00:20:06.981
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely not throw out the </v>

463
00:20:06.981 --> 00:20:10.101
<v Speaker 1>possibility that there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think to throw out the possibility </v>

464
00:20:10.101 --> 00:20:10.590
<v Speaker 1>that there's something out there is kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of silly.</v>

465
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:16.040
<v Speaker 1>I think this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the reaction that people do </v>

466
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.340
<v Speaker 1>that is the reaction against organized </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion and organized religion.</v>

467
00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:20.520
<v Speaker 1>We all know is silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your reaction is to say no.</v>

468
00:20:20.521 --> 00:20:22.020
<v Speaker 1>There's no god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no anything,</v>

469
00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:23.400
<v Speaker 1>there's no evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

470
00:20:23.401 --> 00:20:27.660
<v Speaker 1>I respectfully leave open the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility for almost anything.</v>

471
00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.120
<v Speaker 1>But do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said we all know,</v>

472
00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.780
<v Speaker 1>we all know what the religion is </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized religion.</v>

473
00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:37.080
<v Speaker 1>You're listening to this show and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel me on this dog.</v>

474
00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know that it's a crock of shit,</v>

475
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.650
<v Speaker 1>but that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

476
00:20:43.651 --> 00:20:48.651
<v Speaker 1>I want to go with that for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you talking to the people out there </v>

477
00:20:48.651 --> 00:20:49.270
<v Speaker 1>that go to church every Sunday?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They even know?</v>

478
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Or are you talking about the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have given up on,</v>

479
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.330
<v Speaker 1>on organized religion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're really paying attention,</v>

480
00:20:55.331 --> 00:20:56.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tore Shit.</v>

481
00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:58.480
<v Speaker 1>If you're really paying attention and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not paying attention,</v>

482
00:20:58.481 --> 00:20:59.420
<v Speaker 1>that's on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

483
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:04.470
<v Speaker 1>You don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People just don't want to admit that I </v>

484
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.300
<v Speaker 1>don't want it to themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that there's no god is </v>

485
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:06.490
<v Speaker 1>the idea that there's no god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy,</v>

486
00:21:06.491 --> 00:21:10.990
<v Speaker 1>but the real problem was the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>all those contradictory things,</v>

487
00:21:10.991 --> 00:21:15.991
<v Speaker 1>all those ridiculous things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>written down on paper about controlling </v>

488
00:21:17.261 --> 00:21:20.770
<v Speaker 1>property and about wearing types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cloth,</v>

489
00:21:20.771 --> 00:21:25.771
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things need to be put to death for like </v>

490
00:21:25.771 --> 00:21:28.951
<v Speaker 1>if you really knew what the fuck was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bible and you really got a good </v>

491
00:21:28.951 --> 00:21:30.280
<v Speaker 1>account of it and excellent translation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all of it together,</v>

492
00:21:30.281 --> 00:21:31.630
<v Speaker 1>which is really fucking difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

493
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.400
<v Speaker 1>You would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

494
00:21:33.401 --> 00:21:34.900
<v Speaker 1>People talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

495
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.390
<v Speaker 1>this is not God telling you all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

496
00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:42.540
<v Speaker 1>There may be a god and maybe God has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of communicating to you through good</v>

497
00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:46.930
<v Speaker 1>and bad feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good and bad reactions to people,</v>

498
00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:51.931
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that's what God's message </v>
<v Speaker 1>truly is and that's people have sort of </v>

499
00:21:51.931 --> 00:21:53.710
<v Speaker 1>learned lessons from these things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>written them down.</v>

500
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:58.860
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't discount the idea that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be some overwhelming force in the </v>

501
00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:03.631
<v Speaker 1>universe that creates all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that we should discount that </v>

502
00:22:03.631 --> 00:22:04.630
<v Speaker 1>entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's kind of nuts.</v>

503
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:09.990
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem is that it's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplified to this nonsense sort of </v>

504
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.390
<v Speaker 1>cartoonish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

505
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:14.110
<v Speaker 1>man and a robe and gods and then his son</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus came down.</v>

506
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:19.350
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's what fucks it up for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real idea because the real idea is </v>

507
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:20.560
<v Speaker 1>not that far fetched.</v>

508
00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Well how do we update that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

509
00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:27.780
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing because the Bible </v>

510
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:27.780
<v Speaker 1>was written what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>600 years after the fact.</v>

511
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.420
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

512
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:34.530
<v Speaker 1>let me just break it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is pussy because what </v>

513
00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:37.060
<v Speaker 1>happens is someone has a new way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

514
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:42.120
<v Speaker 1>Someone has a new way of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone comes up with a new Bible and </v>

515
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.411
<v Speaker 1>they put it all together and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>start teaching that shit and then they </v>

516
00:22:46.411 --> 00:22:48.790
<v Speaker 1>start banging chicks and then everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets pissed off and then everybody wants</v>

517
00:22:48.791 --> 00:22:53.791
<v Speaker 1>to come in Waco style with guns and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be able to update </v>

518
00:22:53.791 --> 00:22:58.021
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things about religion is it </v>

519
00:22:58.021 --> 00:22:58.021
<v Speaker 1>has to be old as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's not oldest,</v>

520
00:22:58.021 --> 00:22:58.570
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting there.</v>

521
00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.490
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to trust you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a time.</v>

522
00:23:00.491 --> 00:23:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism wasn't old as fuck.</v>

523
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there one time it was as new as </v>

524
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:07.660
<v Speaker 1>scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When was that?</v>

525
00:23:07.661 --> 00:23:12.661
<v Speaker 1>When was it created?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it created all at once or did it </v>

526
00:23:12.661 --> 00:23:13.170
<v Speaker 1>absorb other religions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

527
00:23:13.171 --> 00:23:15.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The history of says I have no idea.</v>

528
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.590
<v Speaker 1>It just always was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't paying attention.</v>

529
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.920
<v Speaker 1>What a country religion to grow up as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholic was just fucking just torturous</v>

530
00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:26.650
<v Speaker 1>and then and then the other religions </v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta blow off as not being real.</v>

531
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's full of shit.</v>

532
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the reality is that the absolute </v>

533
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:37.561
<v Speaker 1>hardcore reality is that we're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying some things that people wrote </v>

534
00:23:37.561 --> 00:23:42.090
<v Speaker 1>and the idea that any of that stuff is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>message from God and then he's not </v>

535
00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:42.430
<v Speaker 1>communicating with you today in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

536
00:23:42.431 --> 00:23:44.320
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

537
00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:49.880
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that most of what people wrote </v>

538
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:49.910
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely the origins of it,</v>

539
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:54.940
<v Speaker 1>the real big experiences that we wrote </v>
<v Speaker 1>about were either bullshit or would </v>

540
00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:55.490
<v Speaker 1>probably psychedelic experiences.</v>

541
00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.590
<v Speaker 1>I think they were eating a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms back then.</v>

542
00:23:57.591 --> 00:24:02.591
<v Speaker 1>The shit grew everywhere and they knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones you could eat and the ones you </v>

543
00:24:02.591 --> 00:24:03.200
<v Speaker 1>couldn't because it kept you alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've talked about that on our show.</v>

544
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

545
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.750
<v Speaker 1>and you look at the old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

546
00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:09.490
<v Speaker 1>what drawings and the drawings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

547
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.830
<v Speaker 1>and you see the fucking magic mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All magic mushrooms,</v>

548
00:24:12.831 --> 00:24:15.880
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over Christmas Lore,</v>

549
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.940
<v Speaker 1>all over depictions of Christmas is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Mascara mushroom.</v>

550
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:24.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean you see little elves with like </v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing around these mushrooms.</v>

551
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.980
<v Speaker 1>So the thing about that mushroom is </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently it was very variable,</v>

552
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:33.130
<v Speaker 1>like you could get ahold of some event </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't do shit for you and then </v>

553
00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:36.281
<v Speaker 1>you can get a hold of some other stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gives you the psychedelic </v>

554
00:24:36.281 --> 00:24:36.890
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it might be seasonal,</v>

555
00:24:36.891 --> 00:24:39.770
<v Speaker 1>it might be geographical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might vary in genetics.</v>

556
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:44.980
<v Speaker 1>So it's a tricky mushroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those are a lot of evidence that </v>

557
00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:48.101
<v Speaker 1>points to the root of a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious things having to do with </v>

558
00:24:48.101 --> 00:24:52.290
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms and the use of psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why do they write about that one?</v>

559
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Because it's first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find a deep on,</v>

560
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:57.260
<v Speaker 1>you could find it on the internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere deep,</v>

561
00:24:57.261 --> 00:24:59.660
<v Speaker 1>but there have been people that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>written things about it,</v>

562
00:24:59.661 --> 00:25:03.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's not something that makes people</v>
<v Speaker 1>excited.</v>

563
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.500
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

564
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:07.530
<v Speaker 1>the idea of psychedelics being anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than a distraction and you know,</v>

565
00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.440
<v Speaker 1>something bad for your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

566
00:25:09.441 --> 00:25:11.600
<v Speaker 1>like when you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like someone says,</v>

567
00:25:11.601 --> 00:25:12.860
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does psychedelics.</v>

568
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:14.280
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

569
00:25:14.281 --> 00:25:15.230
<v Speaker 1>it was to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

570
00:25:15.231 --> 00:25:17.840
<v Speaker 1>automatically think hunter s Thompson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's losing his mind,</v>

571
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:19.490
<v Speaker 1>firing his gun at the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

572
00:25:19.491 --> 00:25:21.590
<v Speaker 1>that that sort of vision pops into mind.</v>

573
00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Are you heading that way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

574
00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.120
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

575
00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.910
<v Speaker 1>if you said arguing the hunter s Thomas </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our time,</v>

576
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:30.520
<v Speaker 1>I heart,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he was an alcoholic too.</v>

579
00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:40.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean at the end it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan and the end of his life </v>

580

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

585

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

595
00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.540
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The old stories of the old pool hall.</v>

596
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just one of the last fun places </v>

597
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:20.300
<v Speaker 1>where a man could be a man in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

598
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:22.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about pool halls,</v>

599
00:26:22.311 --> 00:26:27.311
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of people like they look down</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it or they have a negative </v>

600
00:26:27.311 --> 00:26:30.941
<v Speaker 1>connotation with it because a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>times pool is thought of as like this </v>

601
00:26:30.941 --> 00:26:31.730
<v Speaker 1>kind of tough person game or some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

602
00:26:31.731 --> 00:26:34.230
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be around like seedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters and.</v>

603
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:37.550

<v Speaker 1>my life and pool halls.</v>

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

609
00:26:44.211 --> 00:26:45.390
<v Speaker 1>I played in Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still like it.</v>

610
00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

611
00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:47.790
<v Speaker 1>I just started playing in a tournament </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

612
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.530
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love playing.</v>

613
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:51.300
<v Speaker 1>I played,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played a lot of money.</v>

614
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

615
00:26:52.301 --> 00:26:57.301
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if I'm with somebody I would </v>

616
00:26:57.301 --> 00:27:00.261
<v Speaker 1>gamble like a for the pay for the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that or play for like </v>

617
00:27:00.261 --> 00:27:04.101
<v Speaker 1>20 bucks or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I not really interested in stealing the </v>

618
00:27:04.101 --> 00:27:04.101
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just interested in,</v>

619
00:27:04.101 --> 00:27:09.041
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just liked the game was just like </v>

620
00:27:09.041 --> 00:27:09.041
<v Speaker 1>playing the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like competing.</v>

621
00:27:09.041 --> 00:27:09.041
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you like that game?</v>

622
00:27:09.041 --> 00:27:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a control game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The game is all about focusing in </v>

623
00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:17.321
<v Speaker 1>exactly on the amount of effort that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to use with your hand to make a </v>

624
00:27:17.321 --> 00:27:21.480
<v Speaker 1>ball roll certain amount of revolutions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's times where literally you're</v>

625
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:26.481
<v Speaker 1>looking for the position to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to vary between one and maybe a half a </v>

626
00:27:26.481 --> 00:27:27.210
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

627
00:27:27.211 --> 00:27:32.211
<v Speaker 1>you're looking to get that close and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing this all striking a ball </v>

628
00:27:32.211 --> 00:27:32.340
<v Speaker 1>with another ball.</v>

629
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Now when I play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to try to hit that mark.</v>

630
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen anybody that's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>good?</v>

631
00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

632
00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:39.680
<v Speaker 1>like really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good money.</v>

633
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.290
<v Speaker 1>SPN Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in real life,</v>

634
00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:43.470
<v Speaker 1>but there's like an art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's her name?</v>

635
00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetically she's very good.</v>

636
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:51.110
<v Speaker 1>She's good to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's there's guys that you watched </v>

637
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.420
<v Speaker 1>them play and it's like you're watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>an art form.</v>

638
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:56.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that blows your mind when you </v>

639
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:56.510
<v Speaker 1>see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the case with anything.</v>

640
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:58.920
<v Speaker 1>I think if you understand chess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the chest is like that.</v>

641
00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:01.080
<v Speaker 1>I think the people that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand shit.</v>

642
00:28:01.081 --> 00:28:06.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean I understand chest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not enough to like read like the </v>

643
00:28:06.081 --> 00:28:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Rook Knight to seven and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

644
00:28:06.111 --> 00:28:09.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just know which pieces go in what way,</v>

645
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:12.480
<v Speaker 1>but I know that peace to people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>love games,</v>

646
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.390
<v Speaker 1>they'll sit and watch a guy play and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get an uber.</v>

647
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Ah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they see a good move,</v>

648
00:28:17.131 --> 00:28:19.250
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck yeah,</v>

649
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:20.050
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just it.</v>

650
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Just jacked him with that shit and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that that comes from knowing </v>

651
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.630
<v Speaker 1>that that form of competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

652
00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.780
<v Speaker 1>I used to like playing chess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty good growing up.</v>

653
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:32.670
<v Speaker 1>And then when you realize you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think 10,</v>

654
00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.780
<v Speaker 1>12 fucking moves ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of work done,</v>

655
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:42.290
<v Speaker 1>a lot of work to think to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different things that could </v>

656
00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:45.321
<v Speaker 1>possibly happen and to calculate what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the risk and the reward and the factor </v>

657
00:28:45.321 --> 00:28:46.800
<v Speaker 1>in how your opponent plays and what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>

658
00:28:46.801 --> 00:28:48.350
<v Speaker 1>What's your deal with alcohol?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

659
00:28:48.351 --> 00:28:52.320
<v Speaker 1>why don't you like it as much as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other stuff you've talked about?</v>

660
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fun.</v>

661
00:28:53.041 --> 00:28:54.480
<v Speaker 1>It's just bad for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>on occasion,</v>

665
00:29:01.731 --> 00:29:02.020
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is like get hammered.</v>

666
00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Then the next day you feel like fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

667
00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.420

699
00:30:13.631 --> 00:30:18.631

<v Speaker 1>you don't always ask me why I love Joe </v>

700
00:30:18.631 --> 00:30:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Rogan so much and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were going through our shit for </v>

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:23.240
<v Speaker 1>the sex and the church thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like stepped out and wrote a fucking</v>

702
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:26.140
<v Speaker 1>article on the whole damn thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporting us.</v>

703
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

704
00:30:27.001 --> 00:30:30.850
<v Speaker 1>I was horrified that no one was getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>upset that you guys were getting.</v>

705
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone was getting upset.</v>

706
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.850
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean.</v>

707
00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.990
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like a national free speech.</v>

708
00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Outraged man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wrote a great article and that's </v>

709
00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.290
<v Speaker 1>when I started really realizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what you're all about,</v>

710
00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I knew it for fear factory.</v>

711
00:30:46.301 --> 00:30:48.550
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know that you're a standup</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that.</v>

712
00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:53.910
<v Speaker 1>At that time we didn't know each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I saw your standup I was </v>

713
00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:54.370
<v Speaker 1>absolutely blown away because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

714
00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:57.100
<v Speaker 1>you leave thinking about shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>

715
00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:00.040
<v Speaker 1>I liked that from a standup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm full time.</v>

716
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.210
<v Speaker 1>What was going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

717
00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:06.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no outrage because we didn't </v>

718
00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:07.630
<v Speaker 1>have the social networking like our fan </v>
<v Speaker 1>base was.</v>

719
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:12.720
<v Speaker 1>They were out of their minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you mean you guys are </v>

720
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:12.720
<v Speaker 1>getting kicked off the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was no twitter back then.</v>

721
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:12.720
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing.</v>

722
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:17.700
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we've said on our show a bunch </v>

723
00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:17.700
<v Speaker 1>of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

724
00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.420
<v Speaker 1>you hit your kick it and hill and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ants go fucking scurrying,</v>

725
00:31:19.421 --> 00:31:21.500
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know what the fuck to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

726
00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:23.980
<v Speaker 1>That was our fan base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all pissed off.</v>

727
00:31:23.981 --> 00:31:25.150
<v Speaker 1>They were running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

728
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.960
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of directions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

729
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.610
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't organize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays you can organize obviously.</v>

730
00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.640
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was the most ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit ever.</v>

731
00:31:33.641 --> 00:31:37.810
<v Speaker 1>The people were making a great outrage </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the fact that someone had sex in a</v>

732
00:31:37.811 --> 00:31:41.790
<v Speaker 1>church that it's like you did something </v>
<v Speaker 1>so horrible,</v>

733
00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:46.910
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did something that everybody wants </v>

734
00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:46.910
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't.</v>

735
00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:48.910
<v Speaker 1>The super secret special place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when Magic House,</v>

736
00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:50.830
<v Speaker 1>why's it bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not bad.</v>

737
00:31:50.831 --> 00:31:51.610
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's stupid.</v>

738
00:31:51.611 --> 00:31:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Why would it be worse if someone fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a supermarket?</v>

739
00:31:53.771 --> 00:31:55.210
<v Speaker 1>That was my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be,</v>

740
00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.690
<v Speaker 1>I would think would be worse with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone at a toys r us.</v>

741
00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

742
00:31:57.971 --> 00:32:02.971
<v Speaker 1>I get your point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what would be the answer to why is </v>

743
00:32:02.971 --> 00:32:02.971
<v Speaker 1>it bad in the church?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that disrespectful?</v>

744
00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:04.960
<v Speaker 1>It's a magic house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're saying.</v>

745
00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:06.550
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That magic is real.</v>

746
00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:10.630
<v Speaker 1>And then all this fucking corny bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's obviously not real,</v>

747
00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:15.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really look these people with their </v>

748
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.671
<v Speaker 1>stain glasses and there's a dude is </v>
<v Speaker 1>being tortured to death and he's </v>

749
00:32:17.671 --> 00:32:21.650
<v Speaker 1>supposed to stare at that and feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was in the vestibule anyway so I </v>

750
00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:22.720
<v Speaker 1>don't even think it was in the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>church and to this day I don't even know</v>

751
00:32:22.721 --> 00:32:27.100
<v Speaker 1>if they actually did it cost me two and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a half years of my career.</v>

752
00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:32.610
<v Speaker 1>And you were one of the groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally one of the only guys </v>

753
00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:32.610
<v Speaker 1>stepping forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so gross.</v>

754
00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:37.171
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe it was real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe you guys are getting </v>

755
00:32:37.171 --> 00:32:37.171
<v Speaker 1>fired for that and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>

756
00:32:37.171 --> 00:32:37.480
<v Speaker 1>this is the craziest thing I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard.</v>

757
00:32:37.481 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Like if we don't stand up and say this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is nothing,</v>

758
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.040
<v Speaker 4>this is not that big a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are you making a big deal out of it?</v>

759
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.860
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

760
00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:44.810
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's funny.</v>

761
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.390
<v Speaker 4>It is funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that if they,</v>

762
00:32:47.391 --> 00:32:49.850
<v Speaker 4>if they did it anywhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you have gotten in trouble?</v>

763
00:32:49.851 --> 00:32:54.851
<v Speaker 4>That's the real question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did it a lot of other places that </v>

764
00:32:54.851 --> 00:32:54.851
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that didn't get you in trouble.</v>

765
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:56.900
<v Speaker 4>They don't even talk about the church </v>
<v Speaker 4>that got you in trouble.</v>

766
00:32:56.901 --> 00:32:59.810
<v Speaker 4>So that's really saying that there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a public policy.</v>

767
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.270
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the magic place Israel.</v>

768
00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:06.980
<v Speaker 4>Well here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same day it was done in a toys r us.</v>

769
00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:09.710
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

770
00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:10.930
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is Right about that.</v>

771
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.780
<v Speaker 4>So it was a toy store and the church </v>
<v Speaker 4>were the two biggies that day,</v>

772
00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.890
<v Speaker 4>but they didn't care about the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did Schwartz,</v>

773
00:33:18.891 --> 00:33:21.110
<v Speaker 4>one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it might've been Fao Schwarz,</v>

774
00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:26.770
<v Speaker 4>the fact that that the reinforcing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea that this magic place is actually a</v>

775
00:33:26.811 --> 00:33:27.380
<v Speaker 4>magic place.</v>

776
00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:28.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

777
00:33:28.251 --> 00:33:33.251
<v Speaker 4>It's really kind of creepy that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>go there and they'd want to worship and </v>

778
00:33:33.251 --> 00:33:34.640
<v Speaker 4>then want to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

779
00:33:34.641 --> 00:33:38.390
<v Speaker 4>so like if they interrupted and certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] and a bunch of people and in</v>

780
00:33:38.391 --> 00:33:40.370
<v Speaker 4>front of a bunch of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if no one knows about it,</v>

781
00:33:40.371 --> 00:33:42.470
<v Speaker 4>they actually pulled it off and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>get caught.</v>

782
00:33:42.471 --> 00:33:43.030
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

783
00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:44.410
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

784
00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:48.110
<v Speaker 4>There was a security guard that saw it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and actually he basically said,</v>

785
00:33:48.111 --> 00:33:49.760
<v Speaker 4>get the hell out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to deal with this shit.</v>

786
00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.530
<v Speaker 4>And then someone grandstand of that day </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

787
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:58.750
<v Speaker 4>it got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the only person that saw it was a </v>

788
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.750
<v Speaker 4>security guard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was it.</v>

789
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.750
<v Speaker 4>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were done.</v>

790
00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:03.011
<v Speaker 4>We were good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He saw and he didn't want to deal with </v>

791
00:34:03.011 --> 00:34:03.011
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't want to write it up.</v>

792
00:34:03.011 --> 00:34:04.610
<v Speaker 4>He didn't want to call anyone and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone grand standard.</v>

793
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:06.260
<v Speaker 4>And then the guy basically it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

794
00:34:06.261 --> 00:34:07.520
<v Speaker 4>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if this is what you want.</v>

795
00:34:07.521 --> 00:34:09.890
<v Speaker 4>And then next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cops got called wow.</v>

796
00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:14.980
<v Speaker 4>It was so real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had a chance that we would have got </v>

797
00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:14.980
<v Speaker 4>away with it and then we would have went</v>
<v Speaker 4>to our bosses like that,</v>

798
00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:15.690
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I,</v>

799
00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:18.500
<v Speaker 4>we're just making belief.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just so silly.</v>

800
00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:19.820
<v Speaker 4>But that fucked us up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

801
00:34:19.821 --> 00:34:21.020
<v Speaker 4>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've never come back from.</v>

802
00:34:21.021 --> 00:34:25.070
<v Speaker 4>That was so fucking big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

803
00:34:25.071 --> 00:34:26.490
<v Speaker 4>You guys were gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

804
00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.940
<v Speaker 4>And then the world changed by the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>we got back.</v>

805
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:30.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two and a half fucking years.</v>

806
00:34:30.801 --> 00:34:32.690

811
00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:43.690
<v Speaker 4>couple of years,</v>

<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

823
00:35:00.651 --> 00:35:02.630
<v Speaker 4>There was nothing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had a wait.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They actually paid up and pee.</v>

<v Speaker 4>and a half years or the UFC for two and </v>

828
00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:15.920
<v Speaker 4>a half years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they were paying you.</v>

00:35:15.921 --> 00:35:17.920
<v Speaker 4>Would you be cool with that Joe Rogan?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

830
00:35:17.921 --> 00:35:20.140
<v Speaker 4>I'd be sad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And plus the fact that I,</v>

831
00:35:20.141 --> 00:35:22.880
<v Speaker 4>I knew that another company would hire </v>
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>

832
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:23.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

833
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:26.210
<v Speaker 4>immediately to continue where we were.</v>

834
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:27.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would have immediately gotten.</v>

835
00:35:27.861 --> 00:35:29.390
<v Speaker 4>But our company said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck that.</v>

836
00:35:29.391 --> 00:35:32.780
<v Speaker 4>We're paying every single dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't do nothing.</v>

837
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:36.590
<v Speaker 4>That's so gross.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a Shitty fucking company policy.</v>

838
00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.210
<v Speaker 4>So I tried to get out of my contract at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time,</v>

839
00:35:39.211 --> 00:35:43.000
<v Speaker 4>but my agent was a little scared because</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was getting his piece.</v>

840
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.090
<v Speaker 4>He was getting his taste.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like,</v>

841
00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:50.160
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll get this whole fucking thing back </v>

842
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:50.160
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

843
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.960
<v Speaker 4>that's so yucky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a contract.</v>

844
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.390
<v Speaker 4>Conflict of interest isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're making,</v>

845
00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:56.310
<v Speaker 4>doing something that we're making good </v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

846
00:35:56.311 --> 00:35:58.350
<v Speaker 4>And he was getting his 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

847
00:35:58.351 --> 00:35:59.630
<v Speaker 4>that's a conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would,</v>

848
00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.130
<v Speaker 4>why would he call the company and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

849
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my boys went out,</v>

850
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:06.150
<v Speaker 4>but I'd call them like weekly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

851
00:36:06.151 --> 00:36:11.151
<v Speaker 4>get the fuck out of this contract.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because at the time clear chow was the </v>

852
00:36:11.151 --> 00:36:12.630
<v Speaker 4>big radio company.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want us immediately,</v>

853
00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:15.330
<v Speaker 4>they wanted to put us on a q and a for </v>
<v Speaker 4>New York.</v>

854
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:17.030
<v Speaker 4>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

855
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:20.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did they want money to get a payoff</v>

856
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:25.610
<v Speaker 4>to get you out of the contract?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did they or would you have had to just </v>

857
00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:26.070
<v Speaker 4>take a chance?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had sued.</v>

858
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:28.320
<v Speaker 4>I um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

859
00:36:28.321 --> 00:36:29.910
<v Speaker 4>what was that again?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I had a flip there.</v>

860
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.520
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>

861
00:36:30.521 --> 00:36:34.080
<v Speaker 4>I said why would they want money?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it was the company that don't.</v>

862
00:36:34.081 --> 00:36:35.970
<v Speaker 4>Who owns you guys?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was CBS,</v>

863
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.050
<v Speaker 4>CBS,</v>
<v Speaker 4>xfinity product.</v>

864
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:39.140
<v Speaker 4>They have accepted money to get out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

865
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

866
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:46.730
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how could you say people get to say </v>

867
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.401
<v Speaker 4>you're full of Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know it says I know this to be </v>

868
00:36:49.401 --> 00:36:52.101
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't want us to compete with </v>

869
00:36:52.101 --> 00:36:52.101
<v Speaker 4>Howard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

870
00:36:52.101 --> 00:36:52.101
<v Speaker 4>because they knew we'd go across the </v>
<v Speaker 4>street,</v>

871
00:36:52.101 --> 00:36:54.210
<v Speaker 4>do mornings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would we beat Howard stern warnings?</v>

872
00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like to think we'd have a pretty</v>

873
00:36:56.761 --> 00:36:58.860
<v Speaker 4>good shot at back then especially.</v>

874
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.650
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were killing it.</v>

875
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:06.710
<v Speaker 4>We worked in this fucking huge and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and afternoons they knew at the very </v>

876
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:07.020
<v Speaker 4>least we're going to take a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

877
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:08.920
<v Speaker 4>a nice chunk of his audience away and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

878
00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:13.970
<v Speaker 4>that was a lot of money to the company.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they sat down in a board room and </v>

879
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:13.970
<v Speaker 4>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

880
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:17.160
<v Speaker 4>it's better that we pay these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys for two and a half years instead of</v>

881
00:37:17.161 --> 00:37:19.710
<v Speaker 4>taking the chance them going up against </v>
<v Speaker 4>our main guy.</v>

882
00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:21.900
<v Speaker 4>That is a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

883
00:37:21.901 --> 00:37:23.150
<v Speaker 4>if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

884
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:28.190
<v Speaker 4>if they probably looked at their own </v>
<v Speaker 4>profits and how much it would cost to </v>

885
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:30.831
<v Speaker 4>pay you off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they probably figured it was worth the </v>

886
00:37:30.831 --> 00:37:30.831
<v Speaker 4>gamble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

887
00:37:30.831 --> 00:37:31.170
<v Speaker 4>They made everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They made way more money us.</v>

888
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:34.840
<v Speaker 4>That's how weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how fucked up the business was so</v>

889
00:37:34.841 --> 00:37:37.230
<v Speaker 4>strained as they used to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They used to talk about it.</v>

890
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:38.480
<v Speaker 4>It was a business where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

891
00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:43.530
<v Speaker 4>where you just printed up money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just printed up money and what the </v>

892
00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:47.220
<v Speaker 4>advertisers were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just paying a fucking lot of money</v>

893
00:37:47.221 --> 00:37:52.221
<v Speaker 4>for their ads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much has the radio business changed </v>

894
00:37:52.221 --> 00:37:52.221
<v Speaker 4>since the Internet?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

895
00:37:52.221 --> 00:37:53.100
<v Speaker 4>drastically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Massively,</v>

896
00:37:53.101 --> 00:37:53.750
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

897
00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:58.770
<v Speaker 4>They're stupid because at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the time you need personality driven </v>

898
00:37:58.770 --> 00:37:58.770
<v Speaker 4>radio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

899
00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:02.960
<v Speaker 4>they said fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the two biggest formats on regular </v>

900
00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:03.680
<v Speaker 4>radio is sports talk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which anyone could do.</v>

901
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.540
<v Speaker 4>No offense those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

902
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:09.120
<v Speaker 4>that stuff is easy to study and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a pop music.</v>

903
00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.570
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No talk shows are left.</v>

904
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:12.510
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

905
00:38:12.511 --> 00:38:13.740
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were saying earlier,</v>

906
00:38:13.741 --> 00:38:16.470
<v Speaker 4>Kevin being they have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to play their music now too.</v>

907
00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:18.670
<v Speaker 4>I think they've always done it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think?</v>

908
00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:20.970
<v Speaker 4>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I remember a time where they</v>

909
00:38:20.971 --> 00:38:24.030
<v Speaker 4>were street talk show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

910
00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.650
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're good dudes.</v>

911
00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:30.830
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think that the future is not </v>

912
00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:31.560
<v Speaker 4>looking good for like regular radio </v>
<v Speaker 4>company.</v>

913
00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:34.770
<v Speaker 4>Their model that they operated under.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just really deteriorated.</v>

914
00:38:34.771 --> 00:38:36.370
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's too many options</v>

915
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.960
<v Speaker 1>and we'll like stitcher and your car.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So easy to do.</v>

920
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:53.640
<v Speaker 1>I got it right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard for a radio station to </v>

921
00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.161
<v Speaker 1>compete that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they have the wacky dj </v>

922
00:38:56.161 --> 00:38:58.591
<v Speaker 1>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are one of the first to shit </v>

923
00:38:58.591 --> 00:39:00.550
<v Speaker 1>all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really made it obvious,</v>

924
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:03.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there was obvious to everyone.</v>

925
00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:05.290
<v Speaker 1>It is obvious to everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody brings it up.</v>

926
00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:08.140
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite bits we do every year</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that Jack Tobar bit.</v>

927
00:39:08.141 --> 00:39:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

928
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:13.630
<v Speaker 1>So many radio shows are so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>pissed off at us,</v>

929
00:39:13.631 --> 00:39:16.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's like you look at yourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're actually trying to help you out.</v>

930
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Why are you still doing that type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio?</v>

931
00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.730
<v Speaker 1>October.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So October.</v>

932
00:39:21.731 --> 00:39:22.340
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

933
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:25.260
<v Speaker 1>we feature one show every day for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>month of October.</v>

934
00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Just beat the shit out of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're all doing the same thing.</v>

935
00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:29.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

936
00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.870
<v Speaker 1>there's shows that they have to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>

937
00:39:31.871 --> 00:39:35.590
<v Speaker 1>which we call the whole obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a DM program director.</v>

938
00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:38.080
<v Speaker 1>They get like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would get like youtube together,</v>

939
00:39:38.081 --> 00:39:43.081
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they would throw a woman and </v>

940
00:39:43.081 --> 00:39:43.081
<v Speaker 1>for her point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

941
00:39:43.081 --> 00:39:44.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Course,</v>

942
00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:52.480
<v Speaker 1>it's not that I'm a misogynist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am a man talking to men and they </v>

943
00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:57.540
<v Speaker 1>have a to women too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a tendency to fucking put up </v>

944
00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:57.580
<v Speaker 1>the yield sign or the stop sign like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

945
00:39:57.581 --> 00:39:58.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knock it off.</v>

946
00:39:58.631 --> 00:40:00.710
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've been.</v>

947
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:03.700
<v Speaker 1>So we've been offered females over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and we just said,</v>

948
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:05.130
<v Speaker 1>hell fucking no.</v>

949
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean we'll have females on our show to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do well,</v>

950
00:40:08.111 --> 00:40:09.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do really well.</v>

951
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:10.690
<v Speaker 1>They could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could hold their own,</v>

952
00:40:10.691 --> 00:40:13.060
<v Speaker 1>but to have someone in there on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular basis,</v>

953
00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.590
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a fucking nightmare.</v>

954
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:19.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to have the perfect mix of </v>

955
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:19.950
<v Speaker 1>personalities because otherwise there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

956
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:25.470
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with women like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what women like and men like is </v>

957
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:28.930
<v Speaker 1>varies drastically big fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

958
00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.350
<v Speaker 1>And when women are in the mix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to do anything,</v>

959
00:40:32.351 --> 00:40:34.450
<v Speaker 1>especially something creative along </v>
<v Speaker 1>these lines,</v>

960
00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:35.350
<v Speaker 1>when it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

961
00:40:35.351 --> 00:40:38.860
<v Speaker 1>it's like freeform conversational type </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

962
00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.290
<v Speaker 1>If a woman is in the mix on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis,</v>

963
00:40:41.291 --> 00:40:43.200
<v Speaker 1>it changes the entire dynamic of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

964
00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to watch and everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying?</v>

965
00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotTa Watch everything you're saying</v>

966
00:40:45.941 --> 00:40:47.410
<v Speaker 1>and to try not to be as rude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

967
00:40:47.411 --> 00:40:48.160
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

968
00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.020
<v Speaker 1>You gotta you gotta definitely not shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>on her.</v>

969
00:40:50.021 --> 00:40:52.580
<v Speaker 1>The way you should on each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be very aware of.</v>

970
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:58.020
<v Speaker 1>You can't talk shit to check the way you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could tell it like you just say the </v>

971
00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:58.020
<v Speaker 1>French shut up stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

972
00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:59.240
<v Speaker 1>and that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one ever gets upset.</v>

973
00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.970
<v Speaker 1>But if you say that to a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut up stupid like,</v>

974
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:06.010
<v Speaker 1>eh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think our female listeners understand </v>

975
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:06.010
<v Speaker 1>that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're like,</v>

976
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:07.700
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get to hear like guys unfiltered.</v>

977
00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know the guys in their </v>

978
00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.461
<v Speaker 1>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're around their wives or their </v>

979
00:41:14.461 --> 00:41:14.461
<v Speaker 1>girlfriends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not unfiltered.</v>

980
00:41:14.461 --> 00:41:16.610
<v Speaker 1>So radio shows like yourself and ours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

981
00:41:16.611 --> 00:41:21.611
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like to kind of take that peak and </v>

982
00:41:21.611 --> 00:41:21.611
<v Speaker 1>listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

983
00:41:21.611 --> 00:41:22.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the only opportunity they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like when me,</v>

984
00:41:22.781 --> 00:41:25.630
<v Speaker 1>when I listened to out cute gay radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't listen.</v>

985
00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:29.270
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way I don't ever hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gay people have like conversations.</v>

986
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Is it good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know.</v>

987
00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:36.520
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're nice guys know hall,</v>

988
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:39.140
<v Speaker 1>but there's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I guess I check them out.</v>

989
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:44.170
<v Speaker 1>I just get a kick out of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a kick out of listening to </v>

990
00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:47.021
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like listening to conservative talk </v>

991
00:41:47.021 --> 00:41:49.091
<v Speaker 1>radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like listening to like those really </v>

992
00:41:49.091 --> 00:41:50.480
<v Speaker 1>silly conservative guys where everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>is fucking 100 percent.</v>

993
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:51.560
<v Speaker 1>It's Joe's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

994
00:41:51.561 --> 00:41:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he's,</v>

995
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:57.200
<v Speaker 1>he's little weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex has a lot of shit in there.</v>

996
00:41:57.201 --> 00:41:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Like he thinks marijuana should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal.</v>

997
00:41:59.001 --> 00:42:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Gay Marriage should be legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just a conspiracy theorists to the.</v>

998
00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.850
<v Speaker 1>You scared me for awhile because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

999
00:42:04.851 --> 00:42:06.590
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan is a really smart dude.</v>

1000
00:42:06.591 --> 00:42:09.830
<v Speaker 1>And you were really into the Alex Jones </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I miss.</v>

1001
00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I misread it.</v>

1002
00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:13.370
<v Speaker 1>And we finally had that conversation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1003
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:14.330
<v Speaker 1>you said it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1004
00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:16.070
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What 20 percent did you say?</v>

1005
00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Like it depends.</v>

1006
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:22.330
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I believe 70 to 80 percent of </v>

1007
00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:22.330
<v Speaker 1>the way it says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

1008
00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Because the last time he was on our </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

1009
00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:26.150
<v Speaker 1>I was surprised how much I was taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he was saying.</v>

1010
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.240
<v Speaker 1>But then there's been other times it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been ridiculous.</v>

1011
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:32.930
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's awesome and fun to listen.</v>

1012
00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Do It's an act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1013
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:39.170
<v Speaker 1>I know him really well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an act.</v>

1014
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.740
<v Speaker 1>He's my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've,</v>

1015
00:42:40.741 --> 00:42:45.741
<v Speaker 1>I've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've known that guy for over 10 years </v>

1016
00:42:45.741 --> 00:42:45.741
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones is exactly who he presented.</v>

1017
00:42:45.741 --> 00:42:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to give me the total.</v>

1018
00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:47.580
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1019
00:42:47.581 --> 00:42:47.850
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1020
00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:48.650
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>

1021
00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:50.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he.</v>

1022
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:55.100
<v Speaker 1>He understands conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like living in that world is as good for</v>

1023
00:42:55.101 --> 00:42:56.650
<v Speaker 1>his business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

1024
00:42:56.710 --> 00:43:01.070
<v Speaker 1>he forces some of this shit to continue </v>
<v Speaker 1>to live in the conspiracy world.</v>

1025
00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:01.590
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1026
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:06.730
<v Speaker 1>I understand why you would see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't believe it's that what I </v>

1027
00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:10.781
<v Speaker 1>believe it is more of it's confirmation </v>
<v Speaker 1>bias that happens when someone gets </v>

1028
00:43:10.781 --> 00:43:12.320
<v Speaker 1>really fixated on the idea that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a conspiracy everywhere.</v>

1029
00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.100
<v Speaker 1>So they start seeing conspiracies in </v>
<v Speaker 1>places that they're not right,</v>

1030
00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:19.460
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean that the validity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the shit he's brought up,</v>

1031
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.010
<v Speaker 1>the validity of some of the shit he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought up was unquestionable.</v>

1032
00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of stuff that he brings </v>

1033
00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:27.070
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

1034
00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:28.010
<v Speaker 1>he was bringing it up way ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody else he was,</v>

1035
00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:33.040
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about he during the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>days of September 11th,</v>

1036
00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.500
<v Speaker 1>he was calling it a false flag attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was saying that,</v>

1037
00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1038
00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:40.010
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was possible that,</v>

1039
00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:42.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings were detonated and like he was</v>

1040
00:43:42.771 --> 00:43:44.390
<v Speaker 1>sticking himself way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

1041
00:43:44.391 --> 00:43:46.100
<v Speaker 1>way out on a limb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he did that,</v>

1042
00:43:46.101 --> 00:43:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow man,</v>

1043
00:43:47.001 --> 00:43:47.810
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1044
00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:50.000
<v Speaker 1>you can't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1045
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.930
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1046
00:43:50.931 --> 00:43:53.630
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say that they're willing to go</v>

1047
00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:55.040
<v Speaker 1>to war for profit.</v>

1048
00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:58.010
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was being nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to him.</v>

1049
00:43:58.011 --> 00:43:58.520
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1050
00:43:58.521 --> 00:43:59.750
<v Speaker 1>you're just drawing all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusions,</v>

1051
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:05.050
<v Speaker 1>but next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're at war with Iraq and nobody </v>

1052
00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:05.540
<v Speaker 1>understands why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1053
00:44:05.541 --> 00:44:08.720
<v Speaker 1>he's saying it's for profiteering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're profiteering over there.</v>

1054
00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:13.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that he's right about </v>

1055
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:14.180
<v Speaker 1>like September 11th being orchestrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the government.</v>

1056
00:44:14.181 --> 00:44:15.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was orchestrated by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

1057
00:44:15.621 --> 00:44:17.720
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that capitalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1058
00:44:17.721 --> 00:44:18.920
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1059
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:21.230
<v Speaker 1>one of my thoughts on that is if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

1060
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.030
<v Speaker 1>let's say you want to bring your country</v>
<v Speaker 1>to war,</v>

1061
00:44:23.031 --> 00:44:25.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know that there's some shit that</v>

1062
00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:31.090
<v Speaker 1>could be going down in New York City </v>
<v Speaker 1>like planes going into the fucking </v>

1063
00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:31.090
<v Speaker 1>buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1064
00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:35.760
<v Speaker 1>that would be technically really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the country because then you would,</v>

1065
00:44:35.761 --> 00:44:37.180
<v Speaker 1>like you said profiteer and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1066
00:44:37.181 --> 00:44:37.640
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1067
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:38.580
<v Speaker 1>head off to war.</v>

1068
00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Why when you let it just happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1069
00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:42.330
<v Speaker 1>one of them was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where,</v>

1070
00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.460
<v Speaker 1>that's where I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where my line is,</v>

1071
00:44:44.461 --> 00:44:47.040
<v Speaker 1>where I wonder in that it's like a gray </v>
<v Speaker 1>area to me,</v>

1072
00:44:47.041 --> 00:44:48.570
<v Speaker 1>but to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think that,</v>

1073
00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:53.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were wiring the buildings while </v>

1074
00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:53.700
<v Speaker 1>people were going in and out of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just ridiculous.</v>

1075
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put them possibly let things happen </v>

1076
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.270
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1077
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.270
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know this is going down,</v>

1078
00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:04.191
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the worst thing for what our </v>

1079
00:45:04.191 --> 00:45:04.230
<v Speaker 1>agenda right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

1080
00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:09.290
<v Speaker 1>The real issue is the idea of the false </v>
<v Speaker 1>flag and the idea of the false flag is </v>

1081
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:11.940
<v Speaker 1>the idea that the government would plan </v>
<v Speaker 1>out a fake attack,</v>

1082
00:45:11.941 --> 00:45:14.610
<v Speaker 1>would they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for most people that answer's no,</v>

1083
00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:19.611
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people say the government would </v>

1084
00:45:19.611 --> 00:45:19.611
<v Speaker 1>never do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the real problem is they've done it.</v>

1085
00:45:19.611 --> 00:45:22.020
<v Speaker 1>They really actually have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only have they done it,</v>

1086
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:24.540
<v Speaker 1>they've planned on doing it a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other times they couldn't pull it off.</v>

1087
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:29.190
<v Speaker 1>There was one from when the Bush </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration was leaving.</v>

1088
00:45:29.191 --> 00:45:31.800
<v Speaker 1>They were talking about in 2007,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was.</v>

1089
00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:33.240
<v Speaker 1>They were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1090
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:34.500
<v Speaker 1>going into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1091
00:45:34.501 --> 00:45:39.501
<v Speaker 1>Iran and coming up with a false flag </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack and in order to get us into war </v>

1092
00:45:39.501 --> 00:45:42.360
<v Speaker 1>with Iran before the administration was </v>
<v Speaker 1>to set the,</v>

1093
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:47.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next administration has said Obama </v>

1094
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Administration into some crazy fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>war that he couldn't control.</v>

1095
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Now in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that good for the country in their </v>

1096
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:52.250
<v Speaker 1>minds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1097
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:52.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it's profiteering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

1098
00:45:52.981 --> 00:45:55.710
<v Speaker 1>I think there's any other of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>buddies,</v>

1099
00:45:55.711 --> 00:46:00.711
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no other way and it has nothing </v>

1100
00:46:00.711 --> 00:46:00.711
<v Speaker 1>to do with actually make the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger in the end.</v>

1101
00:46:00.711 --> 00:46:04.970
<v Speaker 1>If you can't justify it militarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can't justify the reason why </v>

1102
00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:05.860
<v Speaker 1>you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you profiteering and you know,</v>

1103
00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:07.380
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really that simple.</v>

1104
00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:10.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like someone profiting amps Fuckin </v>
<v Speaker 1>lutely.</v>

1105
00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can't justify when you're there </v>

1106
00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:18.380
<v Speaker 1>and someone's profiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means it's about the profit and </v>

1107
00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:18.780
<v Speaker 1>that's something that we don't like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear.</v>

1108
00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:19.350
<v Speaker 1>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1109
00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:21.510
<v Speaker 1>we don't like to accept that shit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this country.</v>

1110
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:26.990
<v Speaker 1>And Alex Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patriotic Alex Jones brings up all that </v>

1111
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:31.701
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The northwoods document and the </v>

1112
00:46:31.701 --> 00:46:31.701
<v Speaker 1>northwest documentaries in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties,</v>

1113
00:46:31.701 --> 00:46:35.540
<v Speaker 1>1962,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was before Kennedy was </v>

1114
00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.491
<v Speaker 1>assassinated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They saw the joint chiefs of Staffs </v>

1115
00:46:37.491 --> 00:46:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Sinus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They agreed on this.</v>

1116
00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:42.900
<v Speaker 1>They were going to fake a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks on America by the Cubans.</v>

1117
00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:48.170
<v Speaker 1>They were going to blow up a drone jet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to take a jet flight in </v>

1118
00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:50.190
<v Speaker 1>the air with radio control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then blow it up in the sky.</v>

1119
00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:51.680
<v Speaker 1>They're going to blame it on the cube </v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

1120
00:46:51.681 --> 00:46:54.880
<v Speaker 1>we're going to arm a Cuban friendlies in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1121
00:46:54.881 --> 00:46:56.760
<v Speaker 1>We're going to lob mortars at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Guantanamo,</v>

1122
00:46:56.761 --> 00:47:01.761
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly killing American civilians or </v>

1123
00:47:01.761 --> 00:47:04.880
<v Speaker 1>citizens rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were going to do all this so </v>

1124
00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.031
<v Speaker 1>that we would get angry and we would </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go to war with Cuba because the </v>

1125
00:47:08.031 --> 00:47:08.031
<v Speaker 1>only way we could get to go to war with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba,</v>

1126
00:47:08.031 --> 00:47:08.300
<v Speaker 1>they wrote all this down.</v>

1127
00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:09.210
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're good to go.</v>

1128
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy was like,</v>

1129
00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.170
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck Outta here with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy vetoed it.</v>

1130
00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Where were you at Kennedy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he said they killed them.</v>

1131
00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:21.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I quite a few people.</v>

1132
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:22.350
<v Speaker 1>It was quite a few people wanted that </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

1133
00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:24.150
<v Speaker 1>What's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Came out what?</v>

1134
00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:25.230
<v Speaker 1>A couple days ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1135
00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Robert Kennedy's kid and them wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

1136
00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:31.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said there's definitely.</v>

1137
00:47:31.091 --> 00:47:33.430
<v Speaker 1>You know that that was definitely a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy.</v>

1138
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:35.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1139
00:47:35.321 --> 00:47:40.321
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to tie things up in a neat little </v>

1140
00:47:40.321 --> 00:47:40.321
<v Speaker 1>packages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the least tie.</v>

1141
00:47:40.321 --> 00:47:43.000
<v Speaker 1>A little neat little package on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't,</v>

1142
00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:45.520
<v Speaker 1>just the video alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a prude or video.</v>

1143
00:47:45.521 --> 00:47:50.521
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you know that they had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>attribute all those wounds to one bullet</v>

1144
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:55.800
<v Speaker 1>because they found a bullet that hit an </v>
<v Speaker 1>underpass and ricocheted and so they </v>

1145
00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:59.371
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were coming up with a logical </v>

1146
00:47:59.371 --> 00:47:59.371
<v Speaker 1>reasons why all these wounds.</v>

1147
00:47:59.371 --> 00:48:01.570
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of from three shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of insulting our intelligence,</v>

1148
00:48:01.571 --> 00:48:02.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1149
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Why would they say why would they limit </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to three shots?</v>

1150
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Because I was the only amount feasible </v>
<v Speaker 1>for this guy to pull off course to make,</v>

1151
00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:14.550
<v Speaker 1>to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One guy had to be no more than three </v>

1152
00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:14.680
<v Speaker 1>shots and it doesn't mean Lee Harvey </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oswald wasn't in on it.</v>

1153
00:48:14.681 --> 00:48:15.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could have been.</v>

1154
00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:19.510
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck it been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a long history with the CIA.</v>

1155
00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Had a long history of being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living Russia,</v>

1156
00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:25.060
<v Speaker 1>possibly being a Russian spy mean we </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

1157
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:30.150
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot that points to the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Lee Harvey Oswald was doing some </v>

1158
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.580
<v Speaker 1>shady shit to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever been to Dealey Plaza?</v>

1159
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There were.</v>

1161
00:48:32.401 --> 00:48:33.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those whack jobs come out,</v>

1162
00:48:33.761 --> 00:48:35.950
<v Speaker 1>but their books and their card tables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1163
00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:37.620
<v Speaker 1>there's still reliving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1164
00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:38.170
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>

1165
00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:40.680
<v Speaker 1>And they all have something to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1166
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:42.170
<v Speaker 1>you haven't seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1167
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:44.020
<v Speaker 1>I drove through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Man.</v>

1168
00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Next time you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you played Dallas,</v>

1169
00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:49.180
<v Speaker 1>you have to go to Dealey Plaza and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to hang out there for like three or</v>

1170
00:48:49.181 --> 00:48:49.990
<v Speaker 1>four hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1171
00:48:49.991 --> 00:48:52.300
<v Speaker 1>we drove through it and it's so weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of history.</v>

1172
00:48:52.301 --> 00:48:53.150
<v Speaker 1>It's smaller than.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1173
00:48:53.151 --> 00:48:54.310
<v Speaker 1>it's tiny and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1174
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:55.590
<v Speaker 1>it looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1175
00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:57.460
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a Hollywood stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1176
00:48:57.870 --> 00:49:00.850
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a set for a movie because </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing has really changed.</v>

1177
00:49:00.851 --> 00:49:02.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean the trees have grown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's about it.</v>

1178
00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.960
<v Speaker 1>But these people that were there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

1179
00:49:04.961 --> 00:49:07.540
<v Speaker 1>they're all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talk about profiteering to this day.</v>

1180
00:49:07.541 --> 00:49:12.541
<v Speaker 1>They're profitero and they go there </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday and try to sell their pamphlet </v>

1181
00:49:12.541 --> 00:49:15.270
<v Speaker 1>or their book or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever the fuck it.</v>

1182
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Someone like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would love it.</v>

1183
00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sandy Hook,</v>

1184
00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:24.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully exposed video that's been </v>

1185
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:24.770
<v Speaker 1>announced.</v>

1186
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:26.770
<v Speaker 1>I saw that they tried to say it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy conspiracy.</v>

1187
00:49:26.771 --> 00:49:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1188
00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:32.740
<v Speaker 1>like there was two other shooters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they show like even footage that like </v>

1189
00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:36.660
<v Speaker 1>the news of people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the police catching a guy in the </v>

1190
00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:39.220
<v Speaker 1>woods and then whatever happened to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy and have some of the kids.</v>

1191
00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:44.280
<v Speaker 1>So did the police catch him or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't they just talked to the police or </v>

1192
00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:44.300
<v Speaker 1>the policing on it as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1193
00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm waiting for somebody to debunk that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the videos.</v>

1194
00:49:47.951 --> 00:49:49.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's got to be wrong here.</v>

1195
00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:54.560
<v Speaker 1>They were saying that the tribute video </v>
<v Speaker 1>was put up a month in advance and I was </v>

1196
00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.081
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know that someone did just </v>

1197
00:49:58.081 --> 00:49:58.081
<v Speaker 1>edit something and write it up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another video I like.</v>

1198
00:49:58.081 --> 00:49:59.500
<v Speaker 1>It could've been a post that was made a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month ago.</v>

1199
00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:02.960
<v Speaker 1>They did something else and they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>took out the stuff and put it.</v>

1200
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:05.380
<v Speaker 1>The regular video in that could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been at.</v>

1201
00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.910
<v Speaker 1>There's ways to like fake a timestamp if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever,</v>

1202
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:09.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>previous posts of your editing.</v>

1203
00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether or not that's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1204
00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:15.280
<v Speaker 1>I do know that whenever anything happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

1205
00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:20.320
<v Speaker 1>a million people for conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it doesn't make any sense,</v>

1206
00:50:20.321 --> 00:50:23.560
<v Speaker 1>even though there's no conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love a good conspiracy of love.</v>

1207
00:50:23.561 --> 00:50:25.210
<v Speaker 1>A good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We grew up with that shit.</v>

1208
00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1209
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:29.450
<v Speaker 1>a big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one,</v>

1210
00:50:29.451 --> 00:50:31.490
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really.</v>

1211
00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1212
00:50:32.001 --> 00:50:33.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the reason why.</v>

1213
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One then was going to ask you about </v>

1214
00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:38.560
<v Speaker 1>blackness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is on the same page.</v>

1215
00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:42.581
<v Speaker 1>We get Jane Goodall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a world famous primatologist she </v>

1216
00:50:42.581 --> 00:50:42.581
<v Speaker 1>believes in big five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1217
00:50:42.581 --> 00:50:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

1218
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:45.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She says she's convinced that there's an</v>

1219
00:50:45.381 --> 00:50:48.920
<v Speaker 1>undiscovered primate [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that's her exact words.</v>

1220
00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:54.100
<v Speaker 1>She's convinced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's an undiscovered primate </v>

1221
00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:54.100
<v Speaker 1>living in the Pacific northwest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're.</v>

1222
00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:55.910
<v Speaker 1>The fuckers is the remains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1223
00:50:55.911 --> 00:50:57.080
<v Speaker 1>the deal is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1224
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:58.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a hunter on yesterday.</v>

1225
00:50:58.581 --> 00:51:02.460
<v Speaker 1>This Guy Steven Rinella,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we were talking about animals like,</v>

1226
00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:04.720
<v Speaker 1>has he ever seen a dead mountain lion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1227
00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.530
<v Speaker 1>never seen a dead mountain lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1228
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:07.910
<v Speaker 1>you could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's a hunter.</v>

1229
00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:10.560
<v Speaker 1>He's in the woods constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know mountain lions are real,</v>

1230
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:13.070
<v Speaker 1>but what are the odds of running around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and finding it dead?</v>

1231
00:51:13.071 --> 00:51:14.360
<v Speaker 1>One it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fucking small,</v>

1232
00:51:14.361 --> 00:51:18.110
<v Speaker 1>but no one has found a skeleton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Skeletal remains and nothing.</v>

1233
00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Nothing credible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing credible.</v>

1234
00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:22.300
<v Speaker 1>But Mountain Lion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1235
00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:22.580
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1236
00:51:22.581 --> 00:51:22.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1237
00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about for bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1238
00:51:24.351 --> 00:51:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying I know that,</v>

1239
00:51:25.791 --> 00:51:30.791
<v Speaker 1>but the reason why Jane Goodall believes</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it might be a real animal is </v>

1240
00:51:30.791 --> 00:51:35.291
<v Speaker 1>because there was a real animal that </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked just like that and it lived </v>

1241
00:51:35.291 --> 00:51:35.291
<v Speaker 1>alongside people.</v>

1242
00:51:35.291 --> 00:51:37.430
<v Speaker 1>It's called gigantic Pythagoras and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>photos of them are kind of crazy.</v>

1243
00:51:37.431 --> 00:51:42.431
<v Speaker 1>Like they have a recreation at one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an eight foot tall bipedal </v>

1244
00:51:42.431 --> 00:51:43.000
<v Speaker 1>giant sasquatch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1245
00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:48.010
<v Speaker 1>that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they have actual proof that it </v>

1246
00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:48.010
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1247
00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:48.010
<v Speaker 1>he lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1248
00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:48.140
<v Speaker 1>he lived 100 years ago because they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>bones.</v>

1249
00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:50.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do updates that someone was talking</v>

1250
00:51:50.991 --> 00:51:55.991
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that that actually was one of </v>

1251
00:51:55.991 --> 00:51:55.991
<v Speaker 1>the few primates that stores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dead.</v>

1252
00:51:55.991 --> 00:51:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Like they buried their dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had like,</v>

1253
00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.920
<v Speaker 1>they're dead in one area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1254
00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:00.220
<v Speaker 1>So they think they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1255
00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:05.240
<v Speaker 1>they might've understood life and death </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than other chimps who just sort of </v>

1256
00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.460
<v Speaker 1>leave their monkey bodies laying around </v>
<v Speaker 1>after they die,</v>

1257
00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took care of the bodies,</v>

1258
00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:10.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really kind of freaky.</v>

1259
00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:13.560
<v Speaker 1>And if they were really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really smart and multiple,</v>

1260
00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:15.810
<v Speaker 1>all primates are smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1261
00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.770
<v Speaker 1>they're all reasonably smart because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a gigantic one.</v>

1262
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Does that big?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be smart as fuck,</v>

1263
00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:23.720
<v Speaker 1>but I mean everyone's searching for it </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1264
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Who searching or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1265
00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:27.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like I could say that.</v>

1266
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Say that it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think like people.</v>

1267
00:52:31.971 --> 00:52:36.971
<v Speaker 1>I mean that would be amazing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody if they could prove that </v>

1268
00:52:36.971 --> 00:52:39.500
<v Speaker 1>bigfoot know spike has a new show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a $10,000,000</v>

1269
00:52:39.501 --> 00:52:42.630
<v Speaker 1>challenge or something crazy like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>to find big for my.</v>

1270
00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:47.870
<v Speaker 1>I think I have said too much money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't blame me.</v>

1271
00:52:47.871 --> 00:52:49.190
<v Speaker 1>It might not be 10 million or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

1272
00:52:49.191 --> 00:52:53.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of money to go find big </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot and it's a good concept.</v>

1273
00:52:53.001 --> 00:52:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking great concept.</v>

1274
00:52:54.501 --> 00:52:59.501
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you got to go deep into the woods </v>

1275
00:52:59.501 --> 00:53:00.320
<v Speaker 1>and look for something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only guy that I've ever heard tell a</v>

1276
00:53:00.321 --> 00:53:05.321
<v Speaker 1>big foot store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard him tell it on your show and </v>

1277
00:53:05.321 --> 00:53:05.321
<v Speaker 1>then he came and told it on my podcast.</v>

1278
00:53:05.321 --> 00:53:06.110
<v Speaker 1>It was Les Stroud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>survivor man,</v>

1279
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:06.920
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>

1280
00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:10.640
<v Speaker 1>his big foot story was a pretty credible</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that guy,</v>

1281
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:12.620
<v Speaker 1>what did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1282
00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:13.940
<v Speaker 1>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to,</v>

1283
00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:15.980
<v Speaker 1>to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different encounters.</v>

1284
00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:21.160
<v Speaker 1>One of 'em he was in Alaska and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most memorable and he was in his </v>

1285
00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:24.530
<v Speaker 1>tent and sleeping and it was just lying </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his tent trying to go to sleep.</v>

1286
00:53:24.531 --> 00:53:29.531
<v Speaker 1>And he heard thumping through the woods </v>
<v Speaker 1>by Peta lease and it was walking on two </v>

1287
00:53:29.531 --> 00:53:30.880
<v Speaker 1>legs clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes and it was really heavy.</v>

1288
00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:34.420
<v Speaker 1>You could tell it was really heavy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know what to do.</v>

1289
00:53:34.421 --> 00:53:39.421
<v Speaker 1>So he just laid there and waited and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>got closer to him and it was coming </v>

1290
00:53:39.421 --> 00:53:40.720
<v Speaker 1>towards his camp and he said it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 50 feet from him.</v>

1291
00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:41.280
<v Speaker 1>It started</v>

1292
00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:41.830
<v Speaker 5>both</v>

1293
00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:49.480
<v Speaker 1>like he goes clear primate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds like clear primate sounds.</v>

1294
00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:54.810
<v Speaker 1>And he goes and reaches for his camera </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when he rustles the thing runs off </v>

1295
00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:54.910
<v Speaker 1>and the thing runs off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

1296
00:53:54.911 --> 00:53:56.470
<v Speaker 1>it's running on two legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear it.</v>

1297
00:53:56.471 --> 00:53:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Thump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thump,</v>

1298
00:53:57.521 --> 00:53:58.660

1301
00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:04.300
<v Speaker 1>is he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's convinced that it was a bear.</v>

1302
00:54:04.301 --> 00:54:05.980
<v Speaker 1>He said there's no way that was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking bear.</v>

1303
00:54:05.981 --> 00:54:09.670
<v Speaker 1>There's no way it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I've been around every animal,</v>

1304
00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:11.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a real survivalist.</v>

1305
00:54:11.771 --> 00:54:16.771
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that guy goes out there with the </v>

1306
00:54:16.771 --> 00:54:16.771
<v Speaker 1>fucking pocket life and it can last a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

1307
00:54:16.771 --> 00:54:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Where it was he who is in Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1308
00:54:17.801 --> 00:54:20.910
<v Speaker 1>you said he was hundreds of miles from </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody to do.</v>

1309
00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:25.920
<v Speaker 1>They follow him in on a plane for hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>before they dropped him off for a week </v>

1310
00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:27.160
<v Speaker 1>and he runs into this fucking animal out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1311
00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:30.190
<v Speaker 1>There's been a lot of sightings in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Alaska by the way.</v>

1312
00:54:30.191 --> 00:54:35.191
<v Speaker 1>It's not just one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's hundreds of bigfoot sightings </v>

1313
00:54:35.191 --> 00:54:35.191
<v Speaker 1>and Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to catch one though.</v>

1314
00:54:35.191 --> 00:54:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do too.</v>

1315
00:54:35.981 --> 00:54:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Are you scared of the woods?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

1316

<v Speaker 1>Fucking scared.</v>

1317
00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:44.490
<v Speaker 1>She'd be scared of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything natural because then you </v>

1318
00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:44.740
<v Speaker 1>become a part of the food chain here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a studio,</v>

1319
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:49.950
<v Speaker 1>the beautiful thing about the studio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have eliminated the food chain 100 </v>

1320
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:52.621
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just us in a fucking table and </v>

1321
00:54:52.621 --> 00:54:54.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to like look out for </v>

1322
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Jaguars and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you live somewhere that sucked,</v>

1323
00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:57.730
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to look out for Jaguars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1324
00:54:57.731 --> 00:54:59.290
<v Speaker 1>you know when you're going into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>jungle,</v>

1325
00:54:59.291 --> 00:55:01.510
<v Speaker 1>are you going into the woods?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful thing,</v>

1326
00:55:01.511 --> 00:55:02.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be with nature.</v>

1327
00:55:02.561 --> 00:55:07.561
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also agree to be a part of </v>

1328
00:55:07.561 --> 00:55:07.561
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

1329
00:55:07.561 --> 00:55:07.720
<v Speaker 1>You throw yourself back into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lottery,</v>

1330
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:08.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1331
00:55:08.561 --> 00:55:13.561
<v Speaker 1>and it's fun for the first couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes and then you start seeing those </v>

1332
00:55:13.561 --> 00:55:15.460
<v Speaker 1>shadows and fucking mind plays tricks on</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1333
00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:17.940

<v Speaker 1>I went hunting for a week.</v>

1334
00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:18.700
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1335
00:55:18.701 --> 00:55:21.730
<v Speaker 1>We went with the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Rinella was on yesterday.</v>

1336
00:55:21.731 --> 00:55:23.430
<v Speaker 1>I shot this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woops.</v>

1337
00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shot this thing?</v>

1338
00:55:25.631 --> 00:55:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shot this thing.</v>

1339
00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.450
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a deer.</v>

1340
00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.310
<v Speaker 1>That's a nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Eight a point.</v>

1342
00:55:32.861 --> 00:55:37.861
<v Speaker 1>Fucking deer we're looking at right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the skull and the antlers.</v>

1343
00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:41.230
<v Speaker 1>It was a interesting experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to um,</v>

1344
00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:45.400
<v Speaker 1>to camp out like five nights in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1345
00:55:45.401 --> 00:55:46.480
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1346
00:55:46.481 --> 00:55:49.570
<v Speaker 1>like this really wild habitat like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1347
00:55:49.571 --> 00:55:52.090
<v Speaker 1>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start looking around for stuff.</v>

1348
00:55:52.091 --> 00:55:54.340
<v Speaker 1>You really keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We found Mountain Lion Shit,</v>

1349
00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:55.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a real eyeopener.</v>

1350
00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Like you see a big fat rope of shit with</v>
<v Speaker 1>hair it and you're like,</v>

1351
00:55:59.771 --> 00:56:03.310
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something killed a deer with its face.</v>

1352
00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It caught a deer and killed it with its </v>

1353
00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:08.310
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hanging out here,</v>

1354
00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:10.280
<v Speaker 1>dropping shits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how did,</v>

1355
00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:12.300
<v Speaker 1>how did you know you were safe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1356
00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.680
<v Speaker 1>we had rifles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now at night when you're sleeping,</v>

1357
00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:15.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a tent.</v>

1358
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:20.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna know where to attack in the </v>

1359
00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:21.520
<v Speaker 1>tent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks at a 10.</v>

1360
00:56:21.521 --> 00:56:24.850
<v Speaker 1>It's this big thing that doesn't totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand they,</v>

1361
00:56:24.851 --> 00:56:27.010
<v Speaker 1>when they smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have food in the Tan or something</v>

1362
00:56:27.011 --> 00:56:28.120
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially bears,</v>

1363
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:30.460
<v Speaker 1>it can get really tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's no bears in this area.</v>

1364
00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Like mountain lions are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>scavengers.</v>

1365
00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:34.530
<v Speaker 1>They're looking to kill things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to ask you,</v>

1366
00:56:34.531 --> 00:56:39.310
<v Speaker 1>so how is it a to kill Salta?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that hard.</v>

1367
00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:41.050
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're all right with that.</v>

1368
00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1369
00:56:41.741 --> 00:56:46.741
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine with that because I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating meat my whole life and if you </v>

1370
00:56:46.741 --> 00:56:46.741
<v Speaker 1>don't kill them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they live forever.</v>

1371
00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:49.980
<v Speaker 1>You know what you're doing is you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're ending their life in you.</v>

1372
00:56:49.981 --> 00:56:51.610
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're choosing to end their life.</v>

1373
00:56:51.611 --> 00:56:56.611
<v Speaker 1>But their life is very temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very temporary in a very harsh </v>

1374
00:56:56.611 --> 00:56:57.190
<v Speaker 1>climate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't do it,</v>

1375
00:56:57.490 --> 00:57:00.640
<v Speaker 1>they get eaten by wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not questioning that.</v>

1376
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.580
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it.</v>

1377
00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Of course you could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

1378
00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:06.820
<v Speaker 1>your personal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be alive.</v>

1379
00:57:06.821 --> 00:57:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a father.</v>

1380
00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Does it bother you at all though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1381
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:10.840
<v Speaker 1>not even a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1382
00:57:10.841 --> 00:57:12.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have respect for it.</v>

1383
00:57:12.041 --> 00:57:14.140
<v Speaker 1>I have reverence for the animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was,</v>

1384
00:57:14.141 --> 00:57:15.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1385
00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:17.770
<v Speaker 1>seeing an animal in the wild like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1386
00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:20.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to use the word majestic,</v>

1387
00:57:20.441 --> 00:57:22.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really powerful moment.</v>

1388
00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Like you see that animal like wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's probably never seen a human </v>

1389
00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:30.670
<v Speaker 1>being before we were in the bad lands in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana and you're,</v>

1390
00:57:30.671 --> 00:57:32.680
<v Speaker 1>you're running into a deer that very </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely is,</v>

1391
00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:34.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years old,</v>

1392
00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:34.990
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years old,</v>

1393
00:57:34.991 --> 00:57:36.850
<v Speaker 1>and I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never seen a person ever.</v>

1394
00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:39.040
<v Speaker 1>And then you're sneaking up on them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot them.</v>

1395
00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:41.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty intense,</v>

1396
00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:44.650
<v Speaker 1>but the food is delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really nutritious and healthy.</v>

1397
00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:46.720
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a person who eats animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>protein,</v>

1398
00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:49.490
<v Speaker 1>I can understand the ethics behind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1399
00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:53.020
<v Speaker 1>not wanting to cause harm to animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not wanting to kill them,</v>

1400
00:57:53.021 --> 00:57:56.560
<v Speaker 1>but especially in the case of big game </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting like deer,</v>

1401
00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:01.800
<v Speaker 1>all you're doing is you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're ending their life before a </v>

1402
00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Predator takes them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all get taken out,</v>

1403
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:04.830
<v Speaker 1>but they get taken out and I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're over populated.</v>

1404
00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:05.890
<v Speaker 1>All,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1405
00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:08.360
<v Speaker 1>how many deer die of old age?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero,</v>

1406
00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:10.360
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally zero.</v>

1407
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:15.220
<v Speaker 1>They're just fucking making babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wolves are pulling the babies out of the</v>

1408
00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Mamas Pussy while they're giving birth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1409
00:58:16.311 --> 00:58:21.311
<v Speaker 1>there's a crazy life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're out there in the woods is fucked </v>

1410
00:58:21.311 --> 00:58:23.200
<v Speaker 1>up podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as dark as it gets out there in the</v>

1411
00:58:23.201 --> 00:58:28.201
<v Speaker 1>dear world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you come along and blow their </v>

1412
00:58:28.201 --> 00:58:28.840
<v Speaker 1>heart out with a bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to try it.</v>

1413
00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really like the safest.</v>

1414
00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:33.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean not the safest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the most humane way for them to die</v>

1415
00:58:33.911 --> 00:58:35.110
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1416
00:58:35.111 --> 00:58:40.111
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could understand people's points of </v>

1417
00:58:40.111 --> 00:58:40.111
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you want to be a Vegan,</v>

1418
00:58:40.111 --> 00:58:40.510
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be a vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to cause any harm.</v>

1419
00:58:40.511 --> 00:58:41.920
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally understand that,</v>

1420
00:58:41.921 --> 00:58:46.921
<v Speaker 1>but I think if you do accept that most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people eat meat and that is the case in </v>

1421
00:58:46.921 --> 00:58:48.130
<v Speaker 1>this culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people eat meat.</v>

1422
00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:53.340
<v Speaker 1>This is the most humane way to acquire </v>
<v Speaker 1>the meat and all you're doing is acting </v>

1423
00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:54.250
<v Speaker 1>as a Predator in a world filled with </v>
<v Speaker 1>predators.</v>

1424
00:58:54.251 --> 00:58:57.370
<v Speaker 1>You're not denying any other animal the </v>
<v Speaker 1>predation,</v>

1425
00:58:57.371 --> 00:59:01.030
<v Speaker 1>and in fact the idea is that if done </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly,</v>

1426
00:59:01.031 --> 00:59:04.240
<v Speaker 1>it keeps the animal populations healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Silicon fucking starve to death.</v>

1427
00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I understand all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking of what goes on in </v>

1428
00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:09.770
<v Speaker 1>your head.</v>

1429
00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:09.770
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1430
00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:09.770
<v Speaker 1>it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was ready for it.</v>

1431
00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:12.880
<v Speaker 1>I had prepared myself for it for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1432
00:59:12.881 --> 00:59:14.520
<v Speaker 1>so I wanted to do this the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1433
00:59:14.570 --> 00:59:15.880
<v Speaker 1>the shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1434
00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

1435
00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:18.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not like,</v>

1436
00:59:18.011 --> 00:59:20.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very respectful thing.</v>

1437
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're eating,</v>

1438
00:59:21.711 --> 00:59:23.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm eating on this whole animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1439
00:59:23.361 --> 00:59:26.120
<v Speaker 1>it takes months to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of meat.</v>

1440
00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's processed and cut.</v>

1441
00:59:27.681 --> 00:59:30.830
<v Speaker 1>And I lived in western New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a lot of venison.</v>

1442
00:59:30.831 --> 00:59:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Chili.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1443
00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:37.240
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Western New York is a lot of fucking </v>

1444
00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:37.240
<v Speaker 1>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Shit.</v>

1445
00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.080
<v Speaker 1>When you take that ride from buffalo to </v>
<v Speaker 1>long island where I brought,</v>

1446
00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:39.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was uh,</v>

1447
00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:44.390
<v Speaker 1>brought up all we used to count how many</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead deer on the top of the cars.</v>

1448
00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:47.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see a lot of hundreds.</v>

1449
00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1450
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1451
00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:49.760
<v Speaker 1>especially during hunting season and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1452
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:52.070
<v Speaker 1>and then on the side of the road and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that crap,</v>

1453
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:54.900
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people get their cars fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>by those deer to.</v>

1454
00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's very important to keep </v>

1455
00:59:59.900 --> 00:59:59.900
<v Speaker 1>deer populations down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people don't understand.</v>

1456
00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if gear populations get really big,</v>

1457
01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:05.030
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a lot of lyme disease as well,</v>

1458
01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:10.180
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens to ticks travel from deer </v>

1459
01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:10.180
<v Speaker 1>to deer and they get into people and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1460
01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:12.200
<v Speaker 1>lyme disease and people's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>devastating to your health.</v>

1461
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that is overpopulation,</v>

1462
01:00:15.171 --> 01:00:16.580
<v Speaker 1>is these fucking deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get,</v>

1463
01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:17.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can get,</v>

1464
01:00:18.130 --> 01:00:18.880
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1465
01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:23.000
<v Speaker 1>a road from Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>western Massachusetts to uh,</v>

1466
01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:27.950
<v Speaker 1>New York to like the White Plains area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the road it is probably a,</v>

1467
01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:30.710
<v Speaker 1>I want to say [inaudible] 91 maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is.</v>

1468
01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:33.400
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a two lane road.</v>

1469
01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at one point when you're like,</v>

1470
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:37.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two lanes on each side for later.</v>

1471
01:00:37.911 --> 01:00:42.911
<v Speaker 1>I guess a way way up in the upstate </v>
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts in western Massachusetts </v>

1472
01:00:42.911 --> 01:00:45.050
<v Speaker 1>as you're driving down in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets so bad with deer that you got to</v>

1473
01:00:45.051 --> 01:00:46.160
<v Speaker 1>go like 20 miles an hour.</v>

1474
01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.160
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just darting out in front of the</v>

1475
01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:51.080
<v Speaker 1>lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just running out in front of your car.</v>

1476
01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:52.860
<v Speaker 1>You ever see when get hit by a car?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1479
01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:57.350
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a bunch of them on the side of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the road,</v>

1480
01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in boulder.</v>

1481
01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:01.190
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not scared of cars at all.</v>

1482
01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:03.380
<v Speaker 1>They don't even run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just stand there.</v>

1483
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1484
01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Boulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a deer.</v>

1485
01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:07.700
<v Speaker 1>We parked the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got out,</v>

1486
01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:12.530
<v Speaker 1>the deer was 20 feet away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 feet away and we're all just standing</v>

1487
01:01:12.531 --> 01:01:13.820
<v Speaker 1>there looking at them and there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1488
01:01:13.821 --> 01:01:18.050
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck you bitches looking at it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just keeps eating this grass.</v>

1489
01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:20.680
<v Speaker 1>It was just used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so used to it.</v>

1490
01:01:20.681 --> 01:01:23.060
<v Speaker 1>It was just used to cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We took a picture of him and got back in</v>

1491
01:01:23.061 --> 01:01:24.530
<v Speaker 1>the car and he jumped across the fence.</v>

1492
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:29.530
<v Speaker 1>I haven't run out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they get used to people and you </v>

1493
01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:32.441
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't keep those populations </v>

1494
01:01:32.441 --> 01:01:34.151
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be slamming into your </v>

1495
01:01:34.151 --> 01:01:34.190
<v Speaker 1>cars at night and they're like little </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy squirrels,</v>

1496
01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll kill you.</v>

1497
01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:37.880
<v Speaker 1>Like they'll go through your windshield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>

1498
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen those photos online?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have giant through the,</v>

1499
01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:46.550
<v Speaker 1>through the windshield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're beautiful.</v>

1500
01:01:46.551 --> 01:01:47.570
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

1501
01:01:47.571 --> 01:01:49.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying we should eradicate them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we should eat them.</v>

1502
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:55.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with the eating </v>

1503
01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:55.270
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of them.</v>

1504
01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:55.270
<v Speaker 1>I was just trying to get into your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1505
01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:56.870
<v Speaker 1>I was just curious because I've never </v>
<v Speaker 1>done it.</v>

1506
01:01:56.871 --> 01:01:57.620
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1507
01:01:57.621 --> 01:02:02.621
<v Speaker 1>I never did it until this time and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wondered whether or not I was going to </v>

1508
01:02:02.621 --> 01:02:02.621
<v Speaker 1>have a problem with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1509
01:02:02.621 --> 01:02:03.680
<v Speaker 1>I eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always eaten meat.</v>

1510
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:04.370

1511
01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:07.130

<v Speaker 1>Of course it would be hypocritical.</v>

1512
01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.900
<v Speaker 1>It's one of my favorite foods in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1522
01:02:31.251 --> 01:02:31.251
<v Speaker 1>way better for your body to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you drinking over there?</v>

1523
01:02:31.251 --> 01:02:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Step bulletproof coffee shit that I told</v>
<v Speaker 1>you about,</v>

1524
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:34.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's made with butter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1525
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.620
<v Speaker 1>It's made with grass fed butter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you learn about this shit?</v>

1526
01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>This is a guy named Dave asprey who came</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto Brian,</v>

1527
01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:41.730

1528
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>he's my Yoda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian knows this shit.</v>

1529
01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.610
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like Yoda,</v>

<v Speaker 1>with all the brightest.</v>

1532
01:02:49.611 --> 01:02:50.780
<v Speaker 1>One point on my strengths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

1533
01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:52.270
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1534
01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.120
<v Speaker 1>that we had on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave Asprey,</v>

1535
01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1536
01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.320
<v Speaker 1>gave us a really fascinating speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Mycotoxins,</v>

1537
01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:05.400
<v Speaker 1>some that I wasn't aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most coffee when you buy coffee from</v>

1538
01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:07.590
<v Speaker 1>a store like starbucks or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1539
01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:12.880
<v Speaker 1>it has mold on it and the way that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a coffee is stored in the way of </v>

1540
01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>coffee is treated when it comes off of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right out of the plantations taken care </v>

1541
01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:23.001
<v Speaker 1>of to is directly proportionate to how </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy it is for you and those </v>

1542
01:03:23.001 --> 01:03:27.440
<v Speaker 1>mycotoxins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't moldy coffee or really </v>

1543
01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.691
<v Speaker 1>fucking bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where liver toxicity and all </v>

1544
01:03:29.691 --> 01:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>these different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these different effects that he like.</v>

1545
01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:34.140
<v Speaker 1>There's an issue with some coffee is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad for you at all,</v>

1546
01:03:34.141 --> 01:03:38.370
<v Speaker 1>but other coffee shows like bad liver </v>
<v Speaker 1>markings and what that is,</v>

1547
01:03:38.371 --> 01:03:42.300
<v Speaker 1>is fungus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in corn and it's in coughing to the</v>

1548
01:03:42.301 --> 01:03:43.200
<v Speaker 1>bunch of different shit.</v>

1549
01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:46.320
<v Speaker 1>What kind of coffee is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of different colleges.</v>

1550
01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Big Guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you ever see there's a show called </v>

1551
01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:53.620
<v Speaker 1>the dangerous grounds show is about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude who.</v>

1552
01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.580
<v Speaker 1>He's on the travel channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He travels to all these different exotic</v>

1553
01:03:56.581 --> 01:04:00.960
<v Speaker 1>places where they make coffee like shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>you what it's like to acquire coffee and</v>

1554
01:04:00.961 --> 01:04:05.961
<v Speaker 1>these tropical lands on and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that somewhere between 70 plus </v>

1555
01:04:05.961 --> 01:04:10.191
<v Speaker 1>percent of all the coffee you get has </v>
<v Speaker 1>mold on it and that could be a health </v>

1556
01:04:10.191 --> 01:04:14.781
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when people are talking about the </v>

1557
01:04:14.781 --> 01:04:16.671
<v Speaker 1>health issues of coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave asprey guy says they're talking </v>

1558
01:04:16.671 --> 01:04:18.810
<v Speaker 1>about mycotoxins and when you're dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with toxin free,</v>

1559
01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.490
<v Speaker 1>clean fungus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free coffee,</v>

1560
01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:24.150
<v Speaker 1>you don't have nearly as many issues and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the energy does it.</v>

1561
01:04:24.151 --> 01:04:29.151
<v Speaker 1>You don't crash afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he's saying is that you're </v>

1562
01:04:29.151 --> 01:04:29.151
<v Speaker 1>basically being poisoned by shitty </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

1563
01:04:29.151 --> 01:04:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Isn't the water killing all that stuff?</v>

1564
01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:34.230
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the crazy thing about fungus.</v>

1565
01:04:34.550 --> 01:04:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Not too good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's getting worse.</v>

1566
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:41.210
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should get a stephen hawkings device</v>

1567
01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:43.710
<v Speaker 1>was one of those little things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

1568
01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:44.190
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click.</v>

1569
01:04:44.191 --> 01:04:46.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get strep man.</v>

1570
01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not contagious at that.</v>

1571
01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just don't make out with them.</v>

1572
01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your question.</v>

1573
01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:53.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't.</v>

1574
01:04:53.530 --> 01:04:54.660
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The boiling,</v>

1575
01:04:54.661 --> 01:04:56.040
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1576
01:04:56.041 --> 01:04:59.430
<v Speaker 1>they can survive in space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can survive on radiation.</v>

1577
01:04:59.431 --> 01:05:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spores can survive and insane places.</v>

1578
01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:08.600
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the main reasons why some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people believe that a magic mushrooms </v>

1579
01:05:09.001 --> 01:05:11.790
<v Speaker 1>came from outer space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea being that there's,</v>

1580
01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:16.850
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very different and far as the </v>

1581
01:05:16.850 --> 01:05:19.341
<v Speaker 1>chemical composition from other </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms and other and they mirror </v>

1582
01:05:19.341 --> 01:05:23.371
<v Speaker 1>human neurochemistry and they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive in a vacuum that did survive </v>

1583
01:05:23.371 --> 01:05:27.541
<v Speaker 1>incredible radiation and we know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain shit has come here from </v>

1584
01:05:27.541 --> 01:05:27.541
<v Speaker 1>asteroids.</v>

1585
01:05:27.541 --> 01:05:28.480
<v Speaker 1>We know water's come here from </v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroids.</v>

1586
01:05:28.481 --> 01:05:33.481
<v Speaker 1>We know that things have hit other </v>
<v Speaker 1>planets and sent things to us and could </v>

1587
01:05:33.481 --> 01:05:34.310
<v Speaker 1>have contained organic matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know,</v>

1588
01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:39.340
<v Speaker 1>we know all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're pretty sure that these </v>

1589
01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:40.150
<v Speaker 1>fucking spores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these spores can survive in space.</v>

1590
01:05:40.151 --> 01:05:41.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's how we got some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>

1591
01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that's like prior to that shit </v>

1592
01:05:46.770 --> 01:05:49.411
<v Speaker 1>that causes mad cow disease that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive like a thousand degrees for like</v>

1593
01:05:49.631 --> 01:05:53.160
<v Speaker 1>seven days or something crazy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're,</v>

1594
01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.360
<v Speaker 1>they're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're insanely tolerant.</v>

1595
01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Does this stuff keeps you awake at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night?</v>

1599
01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:09.400
<v Speaker 1>But it's just the way I say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can I take a fucking lake?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1683
01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:03.460
<v Speaker 1>as an adult and especially as a father </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you read about the,</v>

1684
01:10:03.490 --> 01:10:08.490
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the craziness in the world when you see </v>

1689
01:10:16.851 --> 01:10:21.270
<v Speaker 1>How these honor killings is don't stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our country could use a little of that </v>

1690
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:22.440
<v Speaker 1>honor killings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just something.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Fuck man,</v>

1692
01:10:24.661 --> 01:10:29.661

<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like seeing his fucking </v>

1693
01:10:29.661 --> 01:10:30.600
<v Speaker 1>face on the news every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't we just take them out back and</v>

<v Speaker 1>shoot him in the fucking head?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1695
01:10:32.101 --> 01:10:35.270
<v Speaker 1>But that's a big difference between that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and honored that.</v>

1696
01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.170
<v Speaker 1>I was just bringing it all together.</v>

1697
01:10:37.171 --> 01:10:39.540
<v Speaker 1>of course I don't want honor killings in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

1698
01:10:39.541 --> 01:10:40.870
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>

1699
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:45.180
<v Speaker 1>I think we're a bunch of pussies as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as we take care of some of these fucking</v>

1700
01:10:45.181 --> 01:10:50.181
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to take care of school </v>

1701
01:10:50.181 --> 01:10:51.561
<v Speaker 1>shootings?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking fucking take these guys out </v>

<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1703
01:10:51.561 --> 01:10:55.131
<v Speaker 1>You have to also find out what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going on with her mind though in </v>

1704
01:10:55.131 --> 01:10:55.860
<v Speaker 1>keeping them alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can study them.</v>

1705
01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:58.800
<v Speaker 1>You could find out what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we might be able to prevent ones in</v>

1706
01:10:58.801 --> 01:11:01.400
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We might have like markers or flags that</v>

1707
01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:02.390
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1708
01:11:02.850 --> 01:11:07.170
<v Speaker 1>they gotta they gotta figure out what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is psychologically and they also have to</v>

1709
01:11:07.171 --> 01:11:09.690
<v Speaker 1>figure out what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm chemically right,</v>

1710
01:11:09.691 --> 01:11:12.990
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of these guys are on </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants more than 90 percent of.</v>

1711
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:14.140
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1712
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:19.190
<v Speaker 4>I think the mental illness part of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole equation is way worse than the </v>

1713
01:11:19.190 --> 01:11:19.190
<v Speaker 4>fucking gun part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1715
01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.090
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1716
01:11:21.190 --> 01:11:26.190

<v Speaker 4>with fertilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1718
01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:28.230

<v Speaker 4>they can kill you.</v>

1719
01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.260
<v Speaker 4>And I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1724
01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:42.290
<v Speaker 4>but it's cool though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I'm trying to step out of my </v>

1725
01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:42.840
<v Speaker 4>comfort zone does these days different </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

1726
01:11:42.841 --> 01:11:47.841
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because like the type of radio show I </v>

1727
01:11:47.841 --> 01:11:47.841
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1728
01:11:47.841 --> 01:11:47.841
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could almost do it in my sleep now.</v>

1729
01:11:47.841 --> 01:11:47.841
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1730
01:11:47.841 --> 01:11:49.740
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you got to test environment to me is</v>

1731
01:11:49.741 --> 01:11:51.330
<v Speaker 4>really fucking strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>

1732
01:11:51.331 --> 01:11:56.331
<v Speaker 4>I'm just pointing out some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys have really become a home for </v>

1733
01:11:56.490 --> 01:11:58.020
<v Speaker 4>the comedian hangout,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1734
01:11:58.021 --> 01:11:59.820
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we used to hate comics on the,</v>

1735
01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:00.570
<v Speaker 4>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1736
01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:00.930
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>

1737
01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:02.310
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1738
01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:05.050
<v Speaker 4>When we're in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1739
01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:10.160
<v Speaker 4>We fucking hated it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when we first kicked in New </v>

1740
01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:13.400
<v Speaker 4>York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we fucking hate it because we had guys </v>

1741
01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:14.820
<v Speaker 4>that came in and instead of just having </v>
<v Speaker 4>the conversation we're having or just be</v>

1742
01:12:14.821 --> 01:12:19.821
<v Speaker 4>funny because if you're a standup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't you just be funny and about a lot </v>

1743
01:12:19.821 --> 01:12:24.141
<v Speaker 4>of these guys at first because we </v>
<v Speaker 4>weren't getting the quality comics </v>

1744
01:12:24.141 --> 01:12:26.811
<v Speaker 4>either because we just starting out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they came in and they wanted their pit </v>

1745
01:12:26.811 --> 01:12:29.901
<v Speaker 4>set up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why can't you just come in and have a </v>

1746
01:12:29.901 --> 01:12:31.530
<v Speaker 4>conversation and maybe we'll fit in one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of your bits or whatever.</v>

1747
01:12:31.531 --> 01:12:35.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's talk about some shit and maybe</v>

1748
01:12:35.281 --> 01:12:39.150
<v Speaker 4>you get some jokes out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we actually avoid a comics for a long</v>

1749
01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:40.230
<v Speaker 4>fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

1750
01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:42.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you do radio in New York,</v>

1751
01:12:42.211 --> 01:12:43.050
<v Speaker 4>you can't avoid it.</v>

1752
01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:46.110
<v Speaker 4>And we finally embraced it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd love it.</v>

1753
01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:48.060
<v Speaker 4>Of course we love when you guys come in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1754
01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:51.300
<v Speaker 4>you guys figured out how to do it the </v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect way,</v>

1755
01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:56.570
<v Speaker 4>then let real comics come in and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck around and shoot the shit and talk </v>

1756
01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:59.710
<v Speaker 4>shit and it creates these unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 4>hysterical moment.</v>

1757
01:12:59.711 --> 01:13:01.140
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas,</v>

1758
01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you got a guy just come in and set up</v>

1759
01:13:03.571 --> 01:13:05.590
<v Speaker 4>as bits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how long can you do that for you?</v>

1760
01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.370
<v Speaker 4>That's not even a real conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's what they want.</v>

1761
01:13:08.371 --> 01:13:11.130
<v Speaker 4>A lot of radio stations they like even I</v>
<v Speaker 4>did,</v>

1762
01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:16.180
<v Speaker 4>I did a big radio station like a couple </v>
<v Speaker 4>of years ago and they still asked me to </v>

1763
01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:16.180
<v Speaker 4>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

1764
01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:17.420
<v Speaker 4>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we would like you to know,</v>

1765
01:13:17.421 --> 01:13:22.421
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what questions you would like to be </v>

1766
01:13:22.421 --> 01:13:22.421
<v Speaker 4>asked to set up your bids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I go set up my bits.</v>

1767
01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:23.700
<v Speaker 4>And the guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>disappointed.</v>

1768
01:13:23.701 --> 01:13:24.720
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what bits are you going to do?</v>

1769
01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:26.490
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what am I going to do?</v>

1770
01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:31.580
<v Speaker 4>What we did not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we did not know who's coming into your </v>

1771
01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:31.580
<v Speaker 4>fucking show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1772
01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:35.190
<v Speaker 4>I can understand if it's somebody where </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe the comedy club made you take him,</v>

1773
01:13:35.610 --> 01:13:37.940
<v Speaker 4>but someone like you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really it was,</v>

1774
01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.170

<v Speaker 4>shit?</v>

1775
01:13:40.230 --> 01:13:45.230
<v Speaker 4>I only did it because I was not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean you then when they had an </v>

1776
01:13:45.230 --> 01:13:46.370
<v Speaker 4>opportunity to have you just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1777
01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:49.140

<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

1778

<v Speaker 4>It was the producer that was just </v>
<v Speaker 4>weirded me out with all the was so </v>

<v Speaker 4>being relaxed</v>

1787
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.930
<v Speaker 1>and when you're around someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>super tense,</v>

1788

<v Speaker 1>are there out there?</v>

1793
01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:26.770

<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1794
01:14:26.771 --> 01:14:28.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like a handful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a handful,</v>

1795
01:14:28.770 --> 01:14:31.370
<v Speaker 1>handful scattered across the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>named five.</v>

1796
01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Kevin had been in la for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll say this,</v>

1797
01:14:35.801 --> 01:14:37.120
<v Speaker 1>there might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there might be more.</v>

1798
01:14:37.121 --> 01:14:39.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm just telling you named five because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to piss off somebody.</v>

1799
01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:40.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

1800
01:14:40.301 --> 01:14:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Then I'll stop right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not because I don't mean to know,</v>

1801
01:14:43.721 --> 01:14:48.721
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just want to hear any nonsense from </v>

1802
01:14:48.721 --> 01:14:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones,</v>

1803
01:14:49.021 --> 01:14:50.100
<v Speaker 1>all you need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

1804
01:14:50.101 --> 01:14:52.800
<v Speaker 1>we've got Internet radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got live radio.</v>

1805
01:14:52.801 --> 01:14:55.530
<v Speaker 1>We are a hundred people strong in </v>
<v Speaker 1>affiliate.</v>

1806
01:14:56.290 --> 01:14:58.540
<v Speaker 3>One of the best things is when Jim </v>
<v Speaker 3>Norton said,</v>

1807
01:14:58.610 --> 01:15:00.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Alex Jones and never thought of.</v>

1808
01:15:00.581 --> 01:15:05.581
<v Speaker 3>He brought up this brilliant point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that how he always talks about like </v>

1809
01:15:05.581 --> 01:15:07.900
<v Speaker 3>the government is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're changing the papers.</v>

1810
01:15:07.901 --> 01:15:12.901
<v Speaker 3>They're doing this with the papers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then he uses the government's </v>

1811
01:15:12.901 --> 01:15:14.830
<v Speaker 3>research and papers for other points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's true.</v>

1812
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:17.410
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can't do both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1813
01:15:17.650 --> 01:15:19.330
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not as effective.</v>

1814
01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:21.670
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like it hurts a lot to tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1815
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1816
01:15:22.670 --> 01:15:24.640
<v Speaker 1>That's like fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1817
01:15:24.641 --> 01:15:26.710
<v Speaker 1>he definitely does do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1818
01:15:26.711 --> 01:15:27.280
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1819
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:29.770
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Alex is also a guy who,</v>

1820
01:15:29.771 --> 01:15:30.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1821
01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:33.010
<v Speaker 1>he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll research shit that a lot of people</v>

1822
01:15:33.011 --> 01:15:38.011
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll find out some things and a lot of </v>

1823
01:15:38.011 --> 01:15:38.011
<v Speaker 1>people wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's a little wacky.</v>

1824
01:15:38.011 --> 01:15:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

1825
01:15:38.771 --> 01:15:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a little wacky.</v>

1826
01:15:40.890 --> 01:15:42.940
<v Speaker 1>My Pierce Morgan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was awesome.</v>

1827
01:15:42.941 --> 01:15:45.670
<v Speaker 1>I loved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just great fucking TV.</v>

1828
01:15:45.690 --> 01:15:47.350
<v Speaker 1>It's just great theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just went,</v>

1829
01:15:47.351 --> 01:15:50.200
<v Speaker 1>loved it when he was pretending when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was having the English accent,</v>

1830
01:15:50.201 --> 01:15:51.650
<v Speaker 1>who's was talking to a peer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's actually,</v>

1831
01:15:51.651 --> 01:15:53.890
<v Speaker 1>it's like Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you crazy motherfucker.</v>

1832
01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:56.170
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have blamed peers if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>punched him at that point,</v>

1833
01:15:56.730 --> 01:15:57.880
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he appears,</v>

1834
01:15:57.881 --> 01:15:59.650
<v Speaker 1>I think in the end it's just a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>pussy.</v>

1835
01:15:59.730 --> 01:16:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really did say you're just a pussy.</v>

1836
01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:05.070
<v Speaker 1>He seems very gross to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

1837
01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Peers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1838
01:16:05.741 --> 01:16:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Some very dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some.</v>

1839
01:16:07.811 --> 01:16:12.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something going on there and he </v>

1840
01:16:12.811 --> 01:16:12.811
<v Speaker 1>got into some shit over there in </v>
<v Speaker 1>England,</v>

1841
01:16:12.811 --> 01:16:12.811
<v Speaker 1>so he's dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1842
01:16:12.811 --> 01:16:17.760
<v Speaker 1>But it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a very intelligent guy and </v>

1843
01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:17.760
<v Speaker 1>he's a very good host.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

1844
01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:21.130
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if he was involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>tabloid journalism before,</v>

1845
01:16:21.131 --> 01:16:23.530
<v Speaker 1>this is what she was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1846
01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.420
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you,</v>

1847
01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:27.730
<v Speaker 1>why do you want to talk to that guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>right there?</v>

1848
01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Those kind of guys are gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that thing,</v>

1849
01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:32.190
<v Speaker 1>the tabloid journalism like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just really.</v>

1850
01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:37.380
<v Speaker 1>And they did this sneaky shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like listening on people's phones </v>

1851
01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:37.380
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was peers.</v>

1852
01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is really gross.</v>

1853
01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:40.990
<v Speaker 1>That's really gross stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1854
01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1855
01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Why would anybody want to get involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that?</v>

1856
01:16:43.721 --> 01:16:48.721
<v Speaker 1>But Alex wanted to deport them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he said something about the second </v>

1857
01:16:48.721 --> 01:16:48.910
<v Speaker 1>amendment is going after him.</v>

1858
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:51.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was just great theater,</v>

1859
01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:53.700
<v Speaker 1>deported.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know.</v>

1860
01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:59.400
<v Speaker 1>You go back to England and socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't take our guns.</v>

1861
01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:04.920
<v Speaker 1>He gets so angry and just watch you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1862
01:17:04.921 --> 01:17:09.921
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so fun to watch and you see pierce </v>

1863
01:17:09.921 --> 01:17:09.921
<v Speaker 1>like holding it down in very </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional.</v>

1864
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:12.410
<v Speaker 1>He plays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he played them like a master.</v>

1865
01:17:12.710 --> 01:17:17.710
<v Speaker 1>But when you don't understand is you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>never win against Alex Jones because he </v>

1866
01:17:17.710 --> 01:17:21.581
<v Speaker 1>will never feel ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slight pierces trying to like embarrass </v>

1867
01:17:21.581 --> 01:17:24.290
<v Speaker 1>him by being quiet while Alex Jones </v>
<v Speaker 1>screams and yells,</v>

1868
01:17:24.650 --> 01:17:29.650
<v Speaker 1>but then you just allow Alex Jones to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>into full Alex Jones mode and then </v>

1869
01:17:29.650 --> 01:17:33.371
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked because then you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dwarfed by his personality and he's </v>

1870
01:17:33.371 --> 01:17:33.371
<v Speaker 1>saying Hilarious Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1871
01:17:33.371 --> 01:17:34.880
<v Speaker 1>he's talking to you in an English </v>
<v Speaker 1>accent.</v>

1872
01:17:34.881 --> 01:17:35.940
<v Speaker 1>You're not even addressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>

1873
01:17:36.710 --> 01:17:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Cheerio old chap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't take all guns away and pierce is </v>

1874
01:17:41.891 --> 01:17:44.000
<v Speaker 1>just peers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have him back because he knows.</v>

1875
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.470
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good tv.</v>

1876
01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:49.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he will have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he will have them back.</v>

1877
01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:54.970
<v Speaker 1>So what else is going on here that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>went from Larry King to that guy so </v>

1878
01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:55.370
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to do something.</v>

1879
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:58.910
<v Speaker 1>I guess we've had Larry on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's awesome.</v>

1880
01:17:59.150 --> 01:18:00.270
<v Speaker 1>He's elect Larry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

1881
01:18:00.330 --> 01:18:02.750
<v Speaker 1>He tells a good story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still the smell.</v>

1882
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:06.740
<v Speaker 1>He looks like he would like antique </v>
<v Speaker 1>bookstore or something.</v>

1883
01:18:06.810 --> 01:18:07.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>

1884
01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:10.820
<v Speaker 1>He's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has lots of great stories.</v>

1885
01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:11.950
<v Speaker 1>You can have mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll do it.</v>

1886
01:18:12.230 --> 01:18:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Seemed like a real nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done his show a couple times when </v>

1887
01:18:17.230 --> 01:18:18.170
<v Speaker 1>he was on CNN a couple times for fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor.</v>

1888
01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that intimidating?</v>

1889
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Being on CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was weird because that's a big </v>

1890
01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:25.550
<v Speaker 1>international audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very friendly.</v>

1891
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:26.680
<v Speaker 1>He was very friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>

1892
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:28.310
<v Speaker 1>that didn't bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1893
01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:32.030
<v Speaker 1>You ever get nervous about people </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching me on TV?</v>

1894
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:36.830
<v Speaker 1>None of that show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know what you did between</v>

1895
01:18:36.831 --> 01:18:39.830
<v Speaker 1>the UFC and fear factor and I've just </v>
<v Speaker 1>done it so many times,</v>

1896
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:41.560
<v Speaker 1>especially the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

1897
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:47.090
<v Speaker 1>to me the like I owe those people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are fighting.</v>

1898
01:18:47.091 --> 01:18:50.330
<v Speaker 1>I owe them my best performance more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>

1899
01:18:50.410 --> 01:18:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean like the guy has a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight and I don't do great commentary </v>

1900
01:18:55.410 --> 01:18:58.610
<v Speaker 1>over his great fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me it doesn't feel like,</v>

1901
01:18:58.611 --> 01:19:00.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I fail my,</v>

1902
01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:02.900
<v Speaker 1>my side of the bargain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1903
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:08.290
<v Speaker 1>I feel very shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So have any of those guys ever taken a </v>

1904
01:19:08.290 --> 01:19:08.290
<v Speaker 1>swing at you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For?</v>

1905
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Some dudes have been upset at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've never been disrespectful in my </v>

1906
01:19:13.311 --> 01:19:15.410
<v Speaker 1>depictions of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like in a weird way,</v>

1907
01:19:15.411 --> 01:19:20.411
<v Speaker 1>it's brave because you're living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy world to live in this </v>

1908
01:19:20.411 --> 01:19:20.411
<v Speaker 1>crazy world and you're critiquing some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these guys.</v>

1909
01:19:20.411 --> 01:19:25.210
<v Speaker 1>I've always water men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if just one of those guys have </v>

1910
01:19:25.210 --> 01:19:25.790
<v Speaker 1>taken a shot at it doesn't mean that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't kick my ass,</v>

1911
01:19:25.791 --> 01:19:27.800
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean that I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1912
01:19:27.801 --> 01:19:29.980
<v Speaker 1>I know what could make them better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1913
01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:35.060
<v Speaker 1>but they don't want to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I wonder if they've ever </v>

1914
01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:39.131
<v Speaker 1>taken it personally and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might not even be able to </v>

1915
01:19:39.131 --> 01:19:39.131
<v Speaker 1>physically achieve what I'm asking them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

1916
01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:42.700
<v Speaker 1>Some guys that get into striking too </v>
<v Speaker 1>late and uh,</v>

1917
01:19:42.710 --> 01:19:43.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>

1918
01:19:43.371 --> 01:19:48.371
<v Speaker 1>well he needs to do is really go to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great striking camp and really get a </v>

1919
01:19:48.371 --> 01:19:49.520
<v Speaker 1>striking together because he's missing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this big hole.</v>

1920
01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:53.300
<v Speaker 1>There were some guys athletically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is,</v>

1921
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:57.560
<v Speaker 1>but they know they can never really get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the striking part downright.</v>

1922
01:19:57.710 --> 01:20:02.710
<v Speaker 1>It's weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like sometimes you see it in it's </v>

1923
01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:06.640
<v Speaker 1>rare wrestlers who have been wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time and um,</v>

1924
01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:10.860
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason they can't seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get snap and their punches.</v>

1925
01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:15.860
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's some guys who have it like </v>

1926
01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:15.860
<v Speaker 1>right away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

1927
01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:19.921
<v Speaker 1>you start holding the pads for them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>right away they're scary as fuck with </v>

1928
01:20:19.921 --> 01:20:19.921
<v Speaker 1>their power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just super athletes.</v>

1929
01:20:20.010 --> 01:20:22.290
<v Speaker 1>But some guys can't get that striking </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

1930
01:20:22.291 --> 01:20:24.600
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't understand it.</v>

1931
01:20:24.601 --> 01:20:26.970
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's an age thing.</v>

1932
01:20:26.971 --> 01:20:29.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they caught it too late </v>
<v Speaker 1>in life and they don't.</v>

1933
01:20:29.731 --> 01:20:34.731
<v Speaker 1>They just cannot develop the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>explosive that shit is obviously </v>

1934
01:20:34.731 --> 01:20:34.731
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1935
01:20:34.731 --> 01:20:35.580
<v Speaker 1>And when you see these guys okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1936
01:20:35.610 --> 01:20:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me they look,</v>

1937
01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:39.860
<v Speaker 1>they all look like they could strike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah.</v>

1938
01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Well it's one of those things where if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1939
01:20:43.290 --> 01:20:48.290
<v Speaker 1>the more you appreciate martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you understand martial arts,</v>

1940
01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:51.150
<v Speaker 1>the in the more techniques that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1941
01:20:51.151 --> 01:20:53.880

<v Speaker 1>application of the techniques.</v>

1942

<v Speaker 1>So like when people say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know why you getting so excited </v>

1946
01:21:02.451 --> 01:21:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Because I know how hard it is to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's doing.</v>

1947

<v Speaker 1>pulled off a crazy as triangle.</v>

1950
01:21:13.081 --> 01:21:14.040
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1951
01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:19.460
<v Speaker 1>So I am extra excited because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimately aware of how difficult it is </v>

1952
01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:20.830
<v Speaker 1>to do with this guy's trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1953
01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:23.100
<v Speaker 1>I love how you call fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

1954
01:21:23.130 --> 01:21:23.970
<v Speaker 1>It's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1955
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.170
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fun Gig,</v>

1956
01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:25.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

1957
01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:28.080
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only thing that I ever.</v>

1958
01:21:28.081 --> 01:21:29.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say nervous.</v>

1959
01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:31.160
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing that I ever do.</v>

1960
01:21:31.190 --> 01:21:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I feel like my responsibility is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than just me.</v>

1961
01:21:34.801 --> 01:21:35.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1962
01:21:35.770 --> 01:21:39.930
<v Speaker 1>the guys fighting as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a sport to the fact that,</v>

1963
01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:42.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fan base of millions of fans,</v>

1964
01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:44.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm their favorite guy to do this,</v>

1965
01:21:44.611 --> 01:21:47.840
<v Speaker 1>like I can't like slack off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like that,</v>

1966
01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:50.160
<v Speaker 1>that I take like I take that super </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

1967
01:21:50.161 --> 01:21:53.850
<v Speaker 1>So if I ever do feel pressure it's then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that pressure is good pressure,</v>

1968
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:59.390
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like as far as like doing this or </v>

1969
01:21:59.390 --> 01:21:59.390
<v Speaker 1>doing Larry King or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was easy.</v>

1970
01:21:59.390 --> 01:22:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Like I did TV yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing a show for TVS.</v>

1971
01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Who gets the last laugh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a passionate coachers company.</v>

1972
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of reinventing punked.</v>

1973
01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.210
<v Speaker 1>I did something with Ashton Kutcher's </v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

1974
01:22:11.211 --> 01:22:13.710
<v Speaker 1>They were great people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't meet,</v>

1975
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:15.840
<v Speaker 1>I didn't meet astrium but the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>were awesome.</v>

1976
01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm handsome men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm in front of the line for </v>

1977
01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:21.500
<v Speaker 1>features.</v>

1978
01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm in front of a live audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1979
01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:22.020
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a stage,</v>

1980
01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:24.840
<v Speaker 1>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're basically like,</v>

1981
01:22:24.841 --> 01:22:27.190
<v Speaker 1>I directed a prank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like what you've seen on,</v>

1982
01:22:27.210 --> 01:22:30.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on pumped and there's three of us and we</v>

1983
01:22:30.001 --> 01:22:30.700
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1984
01:22:30.750 --> 01:22:34.470
<v Speaker 1>directed a prank and then we present it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a live studio audience.</v>

1985
01:22:34.471 --> 01:22:37.150
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking horrifying for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

1986
01:22:37.190 --> 01:22:38.640
<v Speaker 1>but I could do radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1987
01:22:38.670 --> 01:22:39.540
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1988
01:22:39.541 --> 01:22:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I never get nervous doing radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're also doing radio to your fans</v>

1989
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:45.180
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they introduced me.</v>

1992
01:22:46.801 --> 01:22:49.830
<v Speaker 1>No one knows who the fuck I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you didn't stack the deck.</v>

1993
01:22:49.950 --> 01:22:53.010
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean you didn't tell the ONA</v>
<v Speaker 1>fans to get tickets?</v>

1994
01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.830
<v Speaker 1>I should've.</v>

1997
01:23:00.301 --> 01:23:04.870
<v Speaker 1>off for a couple minutes to burn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a previous podcast we talked about</v>

1998
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:08.120
<v Speaker 4>previous podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about how every time I'm</v>

1999

<v Speaker 4>at a restaurant that goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are like,</v>

2000
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:11.950
<v Speaker 4>you just whistle at me with a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>

2001
01:23:11.951 --> 01:23:13.000
<v Speaker 4>I gotta be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

2002
01:23:13.001 --> 01:23:18.001
<v Speaker 4>it's one of my guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great interview and Rogan asked to try </v>

2003

<v Speaker 4>Trippy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do want to try that.</v>

2006

<v Speaker 4>I want to float to do a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there a place in New York where you </v>

2007
01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:26.700
<v Speaker 4>could do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2008
01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:27.220
<v Speaker 4>I gotta look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyway.</v>

2009
01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:28.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to open one.</v>

2010
01:23:28.330 --> 01:23:30.580
<v Speaker 4>But it was horrified just presenting my </v>
<v Speaker 4>stupid prank.</v>

2011
01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:34.080
<v Speaker 4>So if you stack the deck with a ONA </v>
<v Speaker 4>fans,</v>

2012
01:23:34.090 --> 01:23:36.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you would have been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were cool.</v>

2013
01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:37.880
<v Speaker 4>There was no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2014
01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:39.550
<v Speaker 4>it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was great because it was funny.</v>

2015
01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:42.460
<v Speaker 4>But my point is I don't do a lot of tv,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when I do,</v>

2016
01:23:42.461 --> 01:23:45.190
<v Speaker 4>it's like you want to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 4>stepping out of your comfort zone.</v>

2017
01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:47.590
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that could fuck with you.</v>

2018
01:23:47.591 --> 01:23:52.591
<v Speaker 4>That's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you see those sportscaster </v>

2019
01:23:52.591 --> 01:23:52.591
<v Speaker 4>guys that had been doing it like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>million years and they were like,</v>

2020
01:23:52.591 --> 01:23:57.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the nfl guys or any of these guys </v>

2021
01:23:57.150 --> 01:23:57.150
<v Speaker 4>that had been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

2023
01:23:57.330 --> 01:23:58.690
<v Speaker 4>they've been there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>done that.</v>

2024
01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:01.240
<v Speaker 4>So it's all about doing the job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not about,</v>

2025
01:24:01.241 --> 01:24:02.560
<v Speaker 4>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're on TV.</v>

2026
01:24:02.890 --> 01:24:05.440
<v Speaker 4>That's out the window now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just about being a job.</v>

2027
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:06.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to be nervous doing radio.</v>

2028
01:24:06.881 --> 01:24:09.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that left years ago.</v>

2029
01:24:09.610 --> 01:24:12.620
<v Speaker 4>So the only person who's ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>intimidated me,</v>

2030
01:24:12.650 --> 01:24:14.740
<v Speaker 4>it was a ray Liotta,</v>
<v Speaker 4>diddy,</v>

2031
01:24:14.770 --> 01:24:16.840
<v Speaker 4>intimidating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what it was about him.</v>

2032
01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:20.110
<v Speaker 4>But he came in recently and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely did better.</v>

2033
01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:23.350
<v Speaker 4>I just did better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was one of these guys,</v>

2034
01:24:23.351 --> 01:24:24.460
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is.</v>

2035
01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:29.880
<v Speaker 4>I was fucking intimidating the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>time he came in where I was barely </v>

2036
01:24:31.211 --> 01:24:33.670
<v Speaker 4>talking and he finally looked at me and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

2037
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.230
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that guy sick,</v>

2038
01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:39.210
<v Speaker 4>sick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sick.</v>

2039
01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2040
01:24:42.670 --> 01:24:47.670
<v Speaker 4>no one else does that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Ray Liotta and then the fans knew </v>

2041
01:24:47.670 --> 01:24:47.860
<v Speaker 4>and then when know when he was coming </v>
<v Speaker 4>back in,</v>

2042
01:24:47.861 --> 01:24:50.110
<v Speaker 4>they were all talking about tweeting and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2043
01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:53.170
<v Speaker 4>I did all right the second time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

2044
01:24:53.230 --> 01:24:56.320
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess respect for his acting funky.</v>

2045
01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:57.610
<v Speaker 4>Goodfellas.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You're gonna have to look that shit up.</v>

01:25:41.231 --> 01:25:46.231
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe they kept him up and gave </v>
<v Speaker 4>him coke because he looked like he was </v>

2065
01:25:46.231 --> 01:25:46.231
<v Speaker 4>coked out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2066
01:25:46.231 --> 01:25:47.500
<v Speaker 4>those are the eyes that that's what did </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2067
01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:48.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was staring at his,</v>

2068
01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:49.930
<v Speaker 4>at his eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2069
01:25:49.931 --> 01:25:54.931
<v Speaker 4>because when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got guys in your interview and you </v>

2070
01:25:54.931 --> 01:25:54.931
<v Speaker 4>got to look them right in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>eyes.</v>

2071
01:25:54.931 --> 01:25:54.931
<v Speaker 4>And I was looking in his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2072
01:25:54.931 --> 01:25:59.731
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking freaking me the fuck out.</v>

2073
01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:05.760
<v Speaker 4>Freaking me out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That scene where his eyes were all </v>

2074
01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:05.760
<v Speaker 4>fucked up and he was driving in the car.</v>

2075
01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:06.860
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy.</v>

2076
01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:11.920
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty much his eyes so well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm telling you that it's pretty </v>

2077
01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:15.491
<v Speaker 4>much his eyes in general.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you ever think about like a shit </v>

2078
01:26:15.491 --> 01:26:17.230
<v Speaker 4>actor doing that same part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you take some guy with an actor,</v>

2079
01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:22.420
<v Speaker 4>of course can do that same part that him</v>
<v Speaker 4>knowing where it really oded ever done </v>

2080
01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:23.900
<v Speaker 4>it and this is difference and would we </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2081
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:26.360
<v Speaker 4>we would not know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Goodfellas is a good movie.</v>

2082
01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:28.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder about that a lot.</v>

2083
01:26:28.101 --> 01:26:30.410
<v Speaker 4>Like these bad fucking comedies that </v>
<v Speaker 4>come out.</v>

2084
01:26:30.411 --> 01:26:34.700
<v Speaker 4>You wonder if they got a different guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would that have changed everything?</v>

2085
01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:36.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you got.</v>

2086
01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:41.510
<v Speaker 4>You don't mean if you've got someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>else to play this character.</v>

2087
01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:45.630
<v Speaker 4>This movie could never been as good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ray Liotta was born to play this cat.</v>

2088
01:26:45.650 --> 01:26:50.650
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not saying that someone </v>

2089
01:26:50.650 --> 01:26:50.650
<v Speaker 4>couldn't have come up with something </v>
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>

2090
01:26:50.650 --> 01:26:51.410
<v Speaker 4>Do you like caring about the actors that</v>
<v Speaker 4>were also up for roles like that?</v>

2091
01:26:51.630 --> 01:26:52.980
<v Speaker 4>That's always fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2092
01:26:52.981 --> 01:26:55.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't have an example right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody could have done this.</v>

2093
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:58.620
<v Speaker 4>He was so fucking perfect with this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so perfect.</v>

2094
01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:02.130
<v Speaker 4>What are you looking at it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Looking at?</v>

2096
01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:10.430
<v Speaker 4>There's a few of those guys out there </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are like real craftsman.</v>

2097
01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:12.250
<v Speaker 4>Like Daniel Day Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>

<v Speaker 4>We could still kick it out of the park,</v>

2100
01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:17.930
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to.</v>

2101
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:19.850

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2103
01:27:21.201 --> 01:27:22.280
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what it is.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They keep the just get fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nutty life to be a movie star out </v>

<v Speaker 4>shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or would you like to do that?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Zero interest in making movies was </v>

2109
01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:37.120
<v Speaker 4>because it's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2110
01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:41.750
<v Speaker 4>it's thing you build up to a long point </v>
<v Speaker 4>in time and then the fun things in the </v>

<v Speaker 4>movie comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yay.</v>

2112
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:44.300

<v Speaker 4>But all that making of the movie shit.</v>

2113
01:27:44.301 --> 01:27:46.460
<v Speaker 4>That shit takes forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes forever.</v>

2117
01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:53.540
<v Speaker 4>I see how other people would like to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2123
01:28:06.251 --> 01:28:06.251
<v Speaker 4>exploring New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Exploring.</v>

2125
01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:10.940
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever see dark days where the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bowl people used to live?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't say it's a great document.</v>

2128
01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:15.910
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird document.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird.</v>

2129
01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:20.920
<v Speaker 4>It's a really cool documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's black and white and basically it </v>

2130
01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:20.920
<v Speaker 4>talks about the Amtrak tunnel under,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2131
01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:22.720
<v Speaker 4>the upper west side.</v>

<v Speaker 4>because you worry about the super aids </v>

2134
01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:33.270
<v Speaker 4>that are not super a pitcher.</v>

2135
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.830
<v Speaker 4>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fuck would happen.</v>

<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>

2140

<v Speaker 4>guys there.</v>

2143
01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:56.290
<v Speaker 4>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a network of guys and they go </v>

2144
01:28:56.290 --> 01:28:56.290
<v Speaker 4>around the world like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>live under riverside park on the upper </v>

2151
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:14.481
<v Speaker 4>west side and we went into a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking rat hole on the side of the </v>

2152
01:29:14.481 --> 01:29:15.470
<v Speaker 4>highway and there was one holy wanted me</v>

2155
01:29:20.341 --> 01:29:25.341
<v Speaker 4>let's see if there's another hole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we went a little further and sure </v>

2156
01:29:25.341 --> 01:29:26.190
<v Speaker 4>enough there was a whole just enough to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get your fucking body in and then all of</v>

<v Speaker 4>a sudden you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're under underground in this tunnel.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 4>for like 20,</v>

2160
01:29:33.481 --> 01:29:35.430
<v Speaker 4>25 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They kicked everybody out.</v>

2161
01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:37.060
<v Speaker 4>They kicked them out in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>these little collective groups of other </v>

2164
01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:51.020
<v Speaker 4>people willing to live in a tunnel and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they find each other and they all live </v>

2165

<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>a lot of them are drug addicts.</v>

2167
01:29:51.630 --> 01:29:54.300
<v Speaker 4>How many down there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't really know.</v>

2168
01:29:54.630 --> 01:29:56.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some say hundreds.</v>

2169
01:29:56.161 --> 01:29:58.950
<v Speaker 4>Some say thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't really know.</v>

2170
01:29:58.951 --> 01:29:59.900
<v Speaker 4>In dark days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

2171
01:30:00.150 --> 01:30:02.190
<v Speaker 4>the documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't do a really good job because</v>

2172
01:30:02.191 --> 01:30:04.350
<v Speaker 4>I would have loved to know that type of </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

2173
01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:05.190
<v Speaker 4>They focused on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2174
01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:10.640
<v Speaker 4>probably uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about a dozen people that were living </v>

2175
01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:12.981
<v Speaker 4>down there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How would they built a little really </v>

2176
01:30:12.981 --> 01:30:12.981
<v Speaker 4>nice fucking living arrangements for </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves down there.</v>

2177
01:30:12.981 --> 01:30:13.600
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>

2178
01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:15.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like little shanty towns.</v>

2179
01:30:15.571 --> 01:30:17.400
<v Speaker 4>But they had cable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have electricity.</v>

2180
01:30:17.401 --> 01:30:21.630
<v Speaker 4>They caught the TV,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that TV they plugged into.</v>

2181
01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:23.190
<v Speaker 4>They figured out how to plug into </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

2182
01:30:23.191 --> 01:30:26.640
<v Speaker 4>It was all free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had pipes that they broke for their</v>

2183
01:30:26.641 --> 01:30:29.490
<v Speaker 4>showers that was just constantly running</v>
<v Speaker 4>cold water.</v>

2184
01:30:29.491 --> 01:30:32.550
<v Speaker 4>They would take really ice cold showers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2185
01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had pets down there.</v>

2186
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:37.920
<v Speaker 4>When I went down there recently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was me,</v>

2187
01:30:37.921 --> 01:30:42.921
<v Speaker 4>this Guy Moses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we saw three people the entire time </v>

2188
01:30:42.921 --> 01:30:44.580
<v Speaker 4>we walked under ground two and a half </v>
<v Speaker 4>miles to the way out.</v>

2189
01:30:44.850 --> 01:30:49.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean when you commit you got to go the</v>
<v Speaker 4>distance and it's two and a half miles </v>

2190
01:30:49.850 --> 01:30:52.671
<v Speaker 4>to get the fuck out or he got to where </v>
<v Speaker 4>are you going to come back from where </v>

2191
01:30:52.671 --> 01:30:52.671
<v Speaker 4>you came from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Duke.</v>

2192
01:30:52.671 --> 01:30:54.630
<v Speaker 4>And we only saw three other people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were explorers to.</v>

2193
01:30:55.290 --> 01:30:57.900
<v Speaker 4>So they were explorers as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2194
01:30:57.980 --> 01:30:59.670
<v Speaker 4>checking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>checking that shit out.</v>

2195
01:31:00.150 --> 01:31:02.430
<v Speaker 4>So there's a lot of people that go on </v>
<v Speaker 4>and explore it.</v>

2196
01:31:02.730 --> 01:31:03.700
<v Speaker 4>I mean not a lot.</v>

2197
01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:06.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean that day there was what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five of us total.</v>

2198
01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:07.440
<v Speaker 4>So there's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2199
01:31:07.441 --> 01:31:08.730
<v Speaker 4>that's not big for New York.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2200
01:31:08.850 --> 01:31:12.230
<v Speaker 4>And it's a creepy thing to do though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it kind of creepy man.</v>

2201
01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:16.190
<v Speaker 4>It was cool though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the relative to being in the woods,</v>

2202
01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:19.440
<v Speaker 4>that stuff that used to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they do with it all,</v>

2203
01:31:19.441 --> 01:31:20.900
<v Speaker 4>they just pulled it all out of there and</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2204
01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:23.270
<v Speaker 4>they cleaned it up yet because Amtrak </v>
<v Speaker 4>had it and they.</v>

2205
01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:24.210
<v Speaker 4>I guess I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2206
01:31:24.230 --> 01:31:29.230
<v Speaker 4>I think that the tunnels weren't being </v>
<v Speaker 4>used back then or they weren't being </v>

2207
01:31:29.230 --> 01:31:30.720
<v Speaker 4>used a lot in Amtrak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of their fucking tunnel back.</v>

2208
01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:32.780
<v Speaker 4>So they kicked all the people out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they cleared,</v>

2209
01:31:33.230 --> 01:31:35.070
<v Speaker 4>cleaned house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got all the Shit outta there,</v>

2210
01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:38.760
<v Speaker 4>but there's beautiful artwork down their</v>
<v Speaker 4>murals from these fucking,</v>

2211

2216
01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:57.171
<v Speaker 4>wall and every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every area that has the light coming </v>

2217
01:31:57.171 --> 01:32:00.471

<v Speaker 4>That's such a trip.</v>

2221
01:32:04.450 --> 01:32:09.450
<v Speaker 4>It's such a trip that they had developed</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a little underground city down </v>

2222
01:32:09.450 --> 01:32:09.450
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah.</v>

2223
01:32:09.450 --> 01:32:10.700
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of these guys would come up </v>
<v Speaker 4>during the day to,</v>

2224
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:12.430
<v Speaker 4>to hustle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2225
01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.140
<v Speaker 4>collect cans and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2226
01:32:14.141 --> 01:32:15.070
<v Speaker 4>make money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever they,</v>

2227
01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:20.640
<v Speaker 4>however they could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or they go through the garbage and get </v>

2228
01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:20.640
<v Speaker 4>their fucking food and then they go back</v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

2229
01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:23.320
<v Speaker 4>How long did this go on for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>According to dark days,</v>

2230
01:32:23.321 --> 01:32:25.780
<v Speaker 4>they were talking about guys that were </v>
<v Speaker 4>down there for like two decades.</v>

2231
01:32:25.890 --> 01:32:29.040
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ said fuck it to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2232
01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:32.890
<v Speaker 4>society to society and decide they want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to live down there,</v>

2233
01:32:33.610 --> 01:32:36.320
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of them were drug addicts and </v>
<v Speaker 4>crack heads and shit list.</v>

2234
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:38.290
<v Speaker 4>So many crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it will in the world,</v>

2235
01:32:38.350 --> 01:32:42.160
<v Speaker 4>in the movie a dark days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of the guys would write no crack on</v>

2236
01:32:42.161 --> 01:32:44.560
<v Speaker 4>their little homes because they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>sick of people,</v>

2237
01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:47.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>breaking in or knocking,</v>

2238
01:32:47.081 --> 01:32:48.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>asking for crack.</v>

2239
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:50.950
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to get crack in the basement.</v>

2240
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:54.580
<v Speaker 4>It's the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there you go.</v>

2241
01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:57.070
<v Speaker 4>I keep forgetting that we could check </v>
<v Speaker 4>some of this shit out.</v>

2242
01:32:57.071 --> 01:32:58.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so strange.</v>

2243
01:32:58.950 --> 01:33:00.220
<v Speaker 4>I recommended.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2244
01:33:00.221 --> 01:33:01.630
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the,</v>

2245
01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:04.000
<v Speaker 4>I think they could've done a better job </v>
<v Speaker 4>with this documentary,</v>

2246
01:33:04.001 --> 01:33:05.260
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was definitely cool.</v>

2247
01:33:05.261 --> 01:33:07.030
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy has a dartboard.</v>

2248
01:33:07.210 --> 01:33:08.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a frigerator behind him.</v>

2249
01:33:08.670 --> 01:33:09.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As a refrigerator.</v>

2250
01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:10.660
<v Speaker 4>It's all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2251
01:33:10.661 --> 01:33:15.661
<v Speaker 4>free electricity and that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they just tapped into all the </v>

2252
01:33:15.661 --> 01:33:16.330
<v Speaker 4>wires and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2253
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:21.390
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really ingenious when it was so </v>

2254
01:33:21.390 --> 01:33:21.970
<v Speaker 4>fascinating how people just find a way </v>
<v Speaker 4>to adapt.</v>

2255
01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:22.700
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2256
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:25.150
<v Speaker 4>they find a way to adapt to living in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Siberia.</v>

2257
01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:27.940
<v Speaker 4>They find a way to adapt living in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking tunnels.</v>

2258
01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:29.650
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They seemed very,</v>

2259
01:33:29.651 --> 01:33:33.040
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very happy down there to that it becomes</v>

2260
01:33:33.041 --> 01:33:34.070
<v Speaker 4>their life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2261
01:33:34.071 --> 01:33:39.071
<v Speaker 4>And I bet they probably feel like </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're getting away with not paying </v>

2262
01:33:39.071 --> 01:33:39.160
<v Speaker 4>rent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And of course it cripples everybody.</v>

2263
01:33:39.161 --> 01:33:40.170
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're paying rent.</v>

2264
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:42.640
<v Speaker 4>I was creeped out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought I'd see rats down there.</v>

2265
01:33:42.641 --> 01:33:43.780
<v Speaker 4>I didn't see any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the guy,</v>

2266
01:33:43.781 --> 01:33:45.010
<v Speaker 4>Moses I was with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

2267
01:33:45.011 --> 01:33:46.960
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no people down here anymore.</v>

2268
01:33:46.961 --> 01:33:49.360
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rats need people to survive.</v>

2269
01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:54.420
<v Speaker 4>So they go to the people that are it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because rats basically just eat our </v>

2270
01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:54.420
<v Speaker 4>garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I uh,</v>

2271
01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:59.460
<v Speaker 4>was on the upper west side once and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was at a gas station somewhere on the </v>

2272
01:34:00.191 --> 01:34:02.580
<v Speaker 4>west side and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I uh,</v>

2273

<v Speaker 4>ago this was and was on the phone and my</v>

2274

<v Speaker 4>car was parked and was getting gas rats </v>
<v Speaker 4>or jumping out of this sewer,</v>

2275
01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:14.620
<v Speaker 4>climbing up my wheel and into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wheelhouse.</v>

2276
01:34:14.650 --> 01:34:15.220
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

2280
01:34:22.050 --> 01:34:27.050
<v Speaker 4>You're looking for a way into the car </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking for a way like into the engine </v>

2281
01:34:27.050 --> 01:34:27.580
<v Speaker 4>compartment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They sense the heat coming off of it.</v>

2282
01:34:27.950 --> 01:34:29.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw six,</v>

2283
01:34:29.370 --> 01:34:34.370
<v Speaker 4>seven rats climb all over my wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was discussed and they're highly </v>

2284
01:34:34.370 --> 01:34:34.480
<v Speaker 4>intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many.</v>

2288
01:34:41.801 --> 01:34:44.350
<v Speaker 4>it's really tough to fucking trap them </v>
<v Speaker 4>and all that shit.</v>

2289
01:34:44.530 --> 01:34:49.530
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They understand when you're fucking up </v>

2290
01:34:49.530 --> 01:34:49.530

<v Speaker 4>they set up all their paths and stuff.</v>

2293
01:34:52.331 --> 01:34:54.040
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dopey humans go,</v>

2294
01:34:54.041 --> 01:34:56.800
<v Speaker 4>oh well I'll put the fucking rat trap </v>
<v Speaker 4>right where their path is.</v>

2295
01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:58.610
<v Speaker 4>They.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They understand that shit.</v>

2296
01:34:59.950 --> 01:35:02.030
<v Speaker 4>They're fully aware.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2297
01:35:02.031 --> 01:35:03.710
<v Speaker 4>Rat traps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not enough of those cons.</v>

2298
01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:08.800
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got to come up with robots at eat </v>

2299
01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:10.721
<v Speaker 4>rats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say there's more rats in New York </v>

2300
01:35:10.721 --> 01:35:10.721
<v Speaker 4>City than people and they s in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>book,</v>

2301
01:35:10.721 --> 01:35:12.470
<v Speaker 4>they said at any given time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

2302
01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:15.830
<v Speaker 4>this will blow your mind at any given </v>
<v Speaker 4>time when you're walking around New York</v>

2303
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:17.420
<v Speaker 4>City,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a rat within feet of you.</v>

2304
01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:20.530
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they have all this,</v>

2305
01:35:20.550 --> 01:35:22.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these tunnels under the sidewalk and all</v>

2306
01:35:22.491 --> 01:35:27.491
<v Speaker 4>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they dig their own tunnels under the </v>

2307
01:35:27.491 --> 01:35:27.491
<v Speaker 4>sidewalk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Love fucking tunnels.</v>

2308
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:33.870
<v Speaker 4>But according to this book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at any given moment in New York City or </v>

2309
01:35:33.870 --> 01:35:35.930
<v Speaker 4>very close to a rat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't that be nice if they had an APP</v>

2310
01:35:35.931 --> 01:35:40.931
<v Speaker 4>for that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you'd go and you look at your phone </v>

2311
01:35:40.931 --> 01:35:44.411
<v Speaker 4>like how many rats are near me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you look in everywhere and your </v>

2312
01:35:44.411 --> 01:35:47.201
<v Speaker 4>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like that scene in aliens when the </v>

2313
01:35:47.201 --> 01:35:47.240
<v Speaker 4>little girl is hiding and the aliens are</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming through the ceiling.</v>

2314
01:35:47.850 --> 01:35:52.850
<v Speaker 4>You look all over the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like rats are underneath you and </v>

2315
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:53.030
<v Speaker 4>tunnels everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people would move out.</v>

2316
01:35:53.450 --> 01:35:56.360
<v Speaker 4>They wouldn't be so fucking comfy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>cozy in their upper east side,</v>

2317
01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:57.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>penthouses.</v>

2318
01:35:57.890 --> 01:35:59.290
<v Speaker 4>If you could look down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2319
01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:04.300
<v Speaker 4>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a phone and just see all the rats </v>

2320
01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:04.300
<v Speaker 4>moving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to serve as you know,</v>

2321
01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:05.750
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Plaza Hotel obviously in New York.</v>

2322
01:36:05.751 --> 01:36:10.751
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was the daily news did an </v>

2323
01:36:10.751 --> 01:36:10.751
<v Speaker 4>article about the park across the street</v>
<v Speaker 4>is infested with rats.</v>

2324
01:36:10.751 --> 01:36:13.430
<v Speaker 4>And the reason is because the horse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the horse and carriages,</v>

2325
01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:18.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they put all the feed down so that shit </v>

2326
01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:19.280
<v Speaker 4>is everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a great food source for rats.</v>

2327
01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:21.680
<v Speaker 4>So I read about it in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2328
01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:26.860
<v Speaker 4>the paper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went there that night and they said </v>

2329
01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:29.070
<v Speaker 4>you got to wait til the sun goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And sure the fuck there were rats </v>

2330
01:36:29.070 --> 01:36:33.281
<v Speaker 4>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hopping across the fucking lawns and </v>

2331
01:36:33.281 --> 01:36:33.281
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you freak out?</v>

2332
01:36:33.281 --> 01:36:35.720
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes they run like two feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2333
01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:40.900
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's because they're </v>

2334
01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:40.900
<v Speaker 4>excited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no fucking idea.</v>

2335
01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:41.020
<v Speaker 4>Not Not a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but enough to creep you out.</v>

2336
01:36:41.021 --> 01:36:42.280
<v Speaker 4>Like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rats running.</v>

2337
01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:45.350
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there are people or people were</v>

2338
01:36:45.351 --> 01:36:50.351
<v Speaker 4>just kind of sitting on benches and shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>and rats were literally right behind </v>

2339
01:36:50.351 --> 01:36:55.061
<v Speaker 4>them and they didn't know my because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was fully aware because the article </v>

2340
01:36:55.061 --> 01:36:55.460
<v Speaker 4>somebody and they climb on people </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes to just sit in there.</v>

2341
01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:56.150
<v Speaker 4>Any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

2342
01:36:56.210 --> 01:36:58.280
<v Speaker 4>But then you also see all the paths </v>
<v Speaker 4>where the,</v>

2343
01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:00.670
<v Speaker 4>where they're coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2344
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:05.770
<v Speaker 4>Fuck paths from one bus to another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many didn't think you saw that </v>

2345
01:37:05.770 --> 01:37:06.200
<v Speaker 4>night?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A couple of dozen probably.</v>

2346
01:37:06.290 --> 01:37:07.610
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They came out man.</v>

2347
01:37:07.670 --> 01:37:11.450
<v Speaker 4>And that's probably a tiny fraction of </v>
<v Speaker 4>how many of them are tiny little park.</v>

2348
01:37:11.451 --> 01:37:12.740
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno.</v>

2349
01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:18.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like maybe four times the space </v>

2350
01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:18.390
<v Speaker 4>we're in right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>

2351
01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:18.680
<v Speaker 4>Just a small part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was infested.</v>

2352
01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:21.470
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The city hasn't cleaned it up since.</v>

2353
01:37:21.471 --> 01:37:24.020
<v Speaker 4>So how do they do something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want.</v>

2354
01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:25.400
<v Speaker 4>If you want to check out rats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go there.</v>

2355
01:37:25.401 --> 01:37:27.500
<v Speaker 4>It's across the street from the plaza,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not central park.</v>

2356
01:37:27.501 --> 01:37:30.080
<v Speaker 4>Which is right there too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do they keep a rat population?</v>

2357
01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:34.190
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does guys that make a shitload of money?</v>

2358
01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:35.630
<v Speaker 4>Just killing rats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Killing rats.</v>

2359
01:37:35.630 --> 01:37:37.250
<v Speaker 4>I totally do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2360
01:37:37.251 --> 01:37:38.270
<v Speaker 4>These,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these buildings,</v>

2361
01:37:38.271 --> 01:37:43.271
<v Speaker 4>they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They hire the best guys and they make a </v>

2362
01:37:43.271 --> 01:37:43.271
<v Speaker 4>fortune keeping these buildings red </v>
<v Speaker 4>free.</v>

2363
01:37:43.271 --> 01:37:45.980
<v Speaker 4>You need cats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cats are the way to go.</v>

2364
01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:51.350
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we cooked up rats on our radio show and </v>

2365
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.350
<v Speaker 4>you ate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You didn't know about that one?</v>

2366
01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:56.440
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we did more shit at new than </v>

2367
01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:56.440
<v Speaker 4>satellite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2368
01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:57.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One day we got the idea.</v>

2369
01:37:57.661 --> 01:38:02.661
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there's some dump cooking show on </v>

2370
01:38:02.661 --> 01:38:05.120
<v Speaker 4>baby bird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The bird was the greatest fucking bit </v>

2371
01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:05.120
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2372
01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:06.720
<v Speaker 4>and we got to talk about the destroyer </v>
<v Speaker 4>before I get out of here.</v>

2373
01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:09.540
<v Speaker 4>The nickname you gave me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2374
01:38:09.810 --> 01:38:12.180
<v Speaker 4>You were there for probably the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit we ever did.</v>

2375
01:38:12.210 --> 01:38:17.210
<v Speaker 4>Baby Bird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But let me tell you about the rat thing </v>

2376
01:38:17.210 --> 01:38:19.260
<v Speaker 4>real fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So at new we decided to cook up rats and</v>

2377
01:38:19.261 --> 01:38:22.140
<v Speaker 4>we actually got listeners to come in to </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat rat.</v>

2378
01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:24.150
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I looked at Anthony.</v>

2379
01:38:24.151 --> 01:38:25.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no way,</v>

2380
01:38:25.051 --> 01:38:26.190
<v Speaker 4>but we'll try.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we,</v>

2381
01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:26.970
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2382
01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:29.730
<v Speaker 4>we threw the question out there who </v>
<v Speaker 4>would come in and eat rats,</v>

2383
01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:32.700
<v Speaker 4>phones fucking lit up and people like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ali Rats.</v>

2384
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:35.190
<v Speaker 4>So we had two cooks come in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

2385
01:38:35.250 --> 01:38:40.250
<v Speaker 4>we had one guy that was a French chef </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we had just a fucking run of the </v>

2386
01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:44.130
<v Speaker 4>mill barbecue type guy and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they both had live rats.</v>

2387
01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:46.830
<v Speaker 4>We gave them the live rats and they had </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do everything else.</v>

2388
01:38:47.070 --> 01:38:50.460
<v Speaker 4>And one guy killed the rat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like very humane.</v>

2389
01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:54.120
<v Speaker 4>He found a spot on the neck or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>and just fucking stabbed the real fast.</v>

2390
01:38:54.121 --> 01:38:59.121
<v Speaker 4>The thing was dead in a second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>half a second and the other guy fucking </v>

2391
01:38:59.121 --> 01:39:02.310

<v Speaker 4>death on the side of the table.</v>

2392
01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:05.550
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God killed him because he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>know how else this is on the radio,</v>

2393
01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:06.930
<v Speaker 4>on regular radio.</v>

2394
01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:08.700
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the French chef,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I remember this brown sauce and a nice </v>

<v Speaker 4>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's on twitter.</v>

2530
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Just love Pat Duffy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love him too.</v>

2531
01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:39.650
<v Speaker 1>But whatever happened to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come he's not working for you guys?</v>

2532
01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Because we can't do the stunts anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we got,</v>

2533
01:44:42.650 --> 01:44:44.540
<v Speaker 1>we got a couple of positions that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>open.</v>

2534
01:44:44.541 --> 01:44:49.541
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants to interview for depressed the </v>

2535
01:44:49.541 --> 01:44:50.110
<v Speaker 1>other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounded so sad.</v>

2536
01:44:50.111 --> 01:44:53.300
<v Speaker 1>So really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he called in the Jim Martin show and</v>

2537
01:44:53.301 --> 01:44:55.310
<v Speaker 1>he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing's working for me.</v>

2538
01:44:55.311 --> 01:44:57.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm on my last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's him.</v>

2539
01:44:57.830 --> 01:45:01.070
<v Speaker 1>He's willing to eat shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did amazing stuff for us,</v>

2540
01:45:01.071 --> 01:45:06.071
<v Speaker 1>but he was the one that decided to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the garbage pail when pat from </v>

2541
01:45:06.071 --> 01:45:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Inaki Start puking from toe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We knew pat from when Daca was gonna </v>

2542
01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Puke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we're trying to figure out what </v>

2543
01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:14.180
<v Speaker 1>would be the most fucked up way to cap </v>
<v Speaker 1>off this already awesome radio show.</v>

2544
01:45:14.210 --> 01:45:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're on regular radio.</v>

2545
01:45:16.101 --> 01:45:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was on regular radio,</v>

2546
01:45:17.421 --> 01:45:22.421
<v Speaker 1>so we couldn't swear or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and me from having doing fear </v>

2547
01:45:22.421 --> 01:45:22.421
<v Speaker 1>factor.</v>

2548
01:45:22.421 --> 01:45:24.200
<v Speaker 1>It's the only way I would have ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought to do this.</v>

2549
01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:27.320
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about someone leans over the garbage</v>

2550
01:45:27.321 --> 01:45:31.400
<v Speaker 1>pail and he throws up in their mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought anyone would say yes.</v>

2551
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Duffy's fucking stepped right up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Pat Duffy stepped up immediately and</v>

2552
01:45:34.971 --> 01:45:35.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way.</v>

2553
01:45:35.901 --> 01:45:40.901
<v Speaker 1>This is really gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way it's really going to </v>

2554
01:45:40.901 --> 01:45:42.881
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the cartoonishness of the throw up </v>

2555
01:45:42.881 --> 01:45:46.120
<v Speaker 1>coming out of path will knock you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it literally all Eggnog,</v>

2556
01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:51.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was 70 something shots of Eggnog and </v>

2557
01:45:51.140 --> 01:45:52.710
<v Speaker 1>it was like a broken fire hydrants </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream.</v>

2558
01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:56.630
<v Speaker 1>It was the craziest thing I've ever seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my life,</v>

2559
01:45:56.631 --> 01:46:01.631
<v Speaker 1>the most amazing thing I've ever seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you couldn't imagine there was </v>

2560
01:46:01.631 --> 01:46:04.970
<v Speaker 1>that much fluid and one guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just kept going and go in and go,</v>

2561
01:46:04.971 --> 01:46:06.740
<v Speaker 1>and if you haven't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

01:46:35.061 --> 01:46:39.050
<v Speaker 1>ready to blow it all over Pat's face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once it goes by the way,</v>

2572
01:46:39.051 --> 01:46:43.160
<v Speaker 1>the floor is covered with plastic set up</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's hilarious.</v>

2636
01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:16.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The past,</v>

2637
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:17.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>

2638
01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:22.600
<v Speaker 4>the most loyal and active radio fans I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think of any show.</v>

2639
01:50:22.630 --> 01:50:27.630
<v Speaker 4>And they also turn on us as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I keep us on our toes.</v>

2640
01:50:28.030 --> 01:50:28.900
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>

2642
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:34.030
<v Speaker 4>they definitely do at the comedy shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you guys had some.</v>

2643
01:50:34.330 --> 01:50:35.980
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to one of your shows.</v>

2644
01:50:35.981 --> 01:50:37.900
<v Speaker 4>I did one of your shows in Vegas and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was great.</v>

2645
01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:40.900
<v Speaker 4>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know our audience has a,</v>

2646
01:50:40.930 --> 01:50:43.810
<v Speaker 4>it has to be said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are a great comedy crowd.</v>

2647
01:50:43.870 --> 01:50:46.480
<v Speaker 4>They will sit down and fucking listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2648
01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:52.140
<v Speaker 4>Show in Philly the infamous show or that</v>
<v Speaker 4>one they did was a hostile.</v>

2649
01:50:52.490 --> 01:50:53.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well they,</v>

2650
01:50:53.250 --> 01:50:56.470
<v Speaker 4>they were drinking all day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did these comedy shows across America</v>

2651
01:50:56.471 --> 01:51:01.471
<v Speaker 4>and the Philly one is legendary now and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel bad because I know you're close </v>

2652
01:51:01.471 --> 01:51:02.410
<v Speaker 4>with dom rare,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he ate his balls that day,</v>

2653
01:51:03.230 --> 01:51:05.440
<v Speaker 4>but I've thought about it many times to </v>
<v Speaker 4>sap went on.</v>

2654
01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:07.570
<v Speaker 4>He never had a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He never had a chance to.</v>

2655
01:51:07.571 --> 01:51:12.571
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy Schubert never had a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Jimmy Schubert actually bombed in </v>

2656
01:51:12.571 --> 01:51:15.580
<v Speaker 4>front of his fucking family that were </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically sitting in the front row.</v>

2657
01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:18.760
<v Speaker 4>They had to deal with that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did Jimmy go on first?</v>

2658
01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:20.290
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>know Jimmy came close.</v>

2659
01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:21.490
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2660
01:51:21.491 --> 01:51:22.990
<v Speaker 4>I think he went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who didn't bomb?</v>

2661
01:51:23.890 --> 01:51:26.920
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Norton Bill Burr was next.</v>

2662
01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:31.120
<v Speaker 4>Bill burr saw what was happening with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy Schubert and then and then went on</v>

2663
01:51:31.121 --> 01:51:32.140
<v Speaker 4>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

2664
01:51:32.141 --> 01:51:34.210
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking not doing this to me.</v>

2665
01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:39.270
<v Speaker 4>And at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our audience didn't really know bill </v>

2666
01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:39.270
<v Speaker 4>burr yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2667
01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:41.440
<v Speaker 4>they didn't embrace him yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like other guys that came before bill,</v>

2668
01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:46.620
<v Speaker 4>he was sort of on the cusp of being </v>
<v Speaker 4>accepted by our big fucking lunatic,</v>

2669
01:51:47.010 --> 01:51:48.820
<v Speaker 4>a audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

2670
01:51:48.821 --> 01:51:52.370
<v Speaker 4>I ain't doing that shit to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So legendary that,</v>

2671
01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:54.170
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that clip is out there to.</v>

<v Speaker 4>bell.</v>

2673
01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:00.760

<v Speaker 4>He went after Philadelphia in a way that</v>

2674
01:52:00.761 --> 01:52:02.590
<v Speaker 4>nobody's ever done before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2675
01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:03.880
<v Speaker 4>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>they started booing them.</v>

2677
01:52:06.011 --> 01:52:08.200
<v Speaker 4>By the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got a standing ovation.</v>

2678
01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:10.480
<v Speaker 4>It was one of the most amazing things </v>
<v Speaker 4>I've ever seen.</v>

2679
01:52:10.481 --> 01:52:15.481
<v Speaker 4>I know what I'm saying that a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're bringing up a lot of </v>

2680
01:52:15.481 --> 01:52:18.181
<v Speaker 4>benchmarks today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that was one of the most amazing </v>

2681
01:52:18.181 --> 01:52:18.790
<v Speaker 4>things I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A guy turn a fucking room like that.</v>

2683
01:52:20.790 --> 01:52:22.980
<v Speaker 4>And that bothers me about this video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

2684
01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:25.240
<v Speaker 4>I wish we had a better copy of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2685
01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:28.690

<v Speaker 4>It's somebody a uploaded on.</v>

2686

<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2687
01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:35.100
<v Speaker 4>Got It on their cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill Berg started out in Boston and you </v>

2688
01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:37.450
<v Speaker 4>deal with so many crowds like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>drunk,</v>

2689
01:52:37.540 --> 01:52:42.540
<v Speaker 4>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy fucks that you develop that style </v>

2690
01:52:42.540 --> 01:52:42.640
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2691
01:52:42.970 --> 01:52:46.220

2692
01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:50.120
<v Speaker 1>is Boston set tough for you guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston's a great place,</v>

2693
01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:55.200

<v Speaker 1>Well as long as you got your shit </v>

2694
01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:55.200

2695
01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:56.150
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine it was hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2696
01:52:56.151 --> 01:52:57.650
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when bill and I came up,</v>

2697
01:52:57.651 --> 01:53:00.170
<v Speaker 1>I was a couple of years before him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

2698
01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:03.850
<v Speaker 1>when we came up there was so many good </v>
<v Speaker 1>comics around that,</v>

2699
01:53:03.890 --> 01:53:08.890
<v Speaker 1>like the rules of the land had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much established and there was a </v>

2700
01:53:08.890 --> 01:53:11.220
<v Speaker 1>lot of really good places to do standing</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2701
01:53:11.230 --> 01:53:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was also like a lot of like </v>

2702
01:53:16.230 --> 01:53:16.230
<v Speaker 1>really fucked up little shit holes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get sent to Brazil.</v>

2703
01:53:16.230 --> 01:53:17.660
<v Speaker 1>It's so important though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

2704
01:53:17.661 --> 01:53:22.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't have like only easy crowds </v>

2705
01:53:22.661 --> 01:53:22.661
<v Speaker 1>when you're starting out and really </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn how to do comedy.</v>

2706
01:53:22.661 --> 01:53:24.720
<v Speaker 1>You got to be able to do some hostile </v>
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

2707
01:53:24.730 --> 01:53:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2708
01:53:25.010 --> 01:53:27.730
<v Speaker 1>So I see like a guy like bill in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

2709
01:53:27.731 --> 01:53:29.330

<v Speaker 1>that's right up bills out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you do stand up in Boston,</v>

2711
01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:32.980
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get it.</v>

2712
01:53:33.260 --> 01:53:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I missed those shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were thinking about bringing them back.</v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

2721

<v Speaker 1>Fletcher was his big giant ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter dude.</v>

2725
01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:07.100

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2728
01:54:09.741 --> 01:54:11.840
<v Speaker 1>I do remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you did that,</v>

2729
01:54:11.900 --> 01:54:14.900
<v Speaker 1>that literally became the nickname.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We started using it.</v>

2730
01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:17.780
<v Speaker 1>So like all the podcasts that are called</v>
<v Speaker 1>the desk,</v>

2731
01:54:18.110 --> 01:54:21.260
<v Speaker 1>it all came out of that one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I get a little taste?</v>

2732
01:54:21.410 --> 01:54:22.670
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want a hug?</v>

2733
01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:27.350
<v Speaker 1>I got my money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got my taste was out.</v>

2734
01:54:27.370 --> 01:54:29.200
<v Speaker 1>The tastes of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2735
01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:31.940
<v Speaker 1>it's tough to get that New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>

2736
01:54:31.941 --> 01:54:33.890
<v Speaker 1>he gets got some wacky laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2737
01:54:33.891 --> 01:54:35.340
<v Speaker 1>MMA is illegal in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2738
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:40.350
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't even do a fuck when we talk </v>

2739
01:54:40.350 --> 01:54:42.431
<v Speaker 1>about that with Dana white all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous what to do with fucking </v>

2740
01:54:43.971 --> 01:54:47.390
<v Speaker 1>culinary union that they bind people </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

2741
01:54:47.450 --> 01:54:48.890
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how it works.</v>

2742
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:53.950
<v Speaker 1>But if you're talking about the amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of revenue that's being lost in the </v>

2743
01:54:53.950 --> 01:54:53.950
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why can they work around that knowing</v>

2744
01:54:53.950 --> 01:54:56.060
<v Speaker 1>how much money they're losing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2745
01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:57.000
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2746
01:54:57.140 --> 01:55:00.860
<v Speaker 1>the industry is set up where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence of these unions,</v>

2747
01:55:00.890 --> 01:55:01.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

2748
01:55:01.671 --> 01:55:03.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really been established.</v>

2749
01:55:03.291 --> 01:55:05.210
<v Speaker 1>And when they want to keep something </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

2750
01:55:05.330 --> 01:55:10.330
<v Speaker 1>they spend the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They spent a lot of money on anti UFC </v>

2751
01:55:10.330 --> 01:55:11.150
<v Speaker 1>propaganda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti UFC websites.</v>

2752
01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:16.240
<v Speaker 1>They put out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put out press releases and can't </v>

2753
01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:16.640
<v Speaker 1>make money off of say I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>

2754
01:55:16.641 --> 01:55:21.641
<v Speaker 1>Here's the airstrip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>break it down to the culinary union is </v>

2755
01:55:21.641 --> 01:55:23.660
<v Speaker 1>in dispute with the owners of station </v>
<v Speaker 1>casinos.</v>

2756
01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Station casinos are a non union </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization and apparently according to</v>

2757
01:55:29.421 --> 01:55:34.421
<v Speaker 1>station casinos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the workers in the casinos voted to not </v>

2758
01:55:34.421 --> 01:55:38.051
<v Speaker 1>go union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be involved in human </v>

2759
01:55:38.051 --> 01:55:40.520
<v Speaker 1>because they don't want to have to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dues and they believed that the </v>

2760
01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:40.520
<v Speaker 1>company treats them fairly and pays them</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

2761
01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:43.740
<v Speaker 1>So since they don't want to be in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coroner union,</v>

2762
01:55:43.741 --> 01:55:44.460
<v Speaker 1>apparently</v>

2763
01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:46.060
<v Speaker 6>this is allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

2764
01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:49.350
<v Speaker 6>I don't really have any direct </v>
<v Speaker 6>connection to any of this knowledge.</v>

2765
01:55:49.770 --> 01:55:51.450
<v Speaker 6>This is a lot of hearsay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hearsay.</v>

2766
01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:56.540
<v Speaker 6>Allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Culinary Union would benefit in </v>

2767
01:55:56.540 --> 01:56:00.410
<v Speaker 6>terms of millions and millions of </v>
<v Speaker 6>dollars in dues if they got the station </v>

2768
01:56:00.410 --> 01:56:04.641
<v Speaker 6>casinos because I think there's like 20 </v>
<v Speaker 6>station casinos or something crazy like </v>

2769
01:56:04.641 --> 01:56:06.630
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If they got those casinos unionized than</v>

2770
01:56:06.631 --> 01:56:09.000
<v Speaker 6>it would be very financially beneficial </v>
<v Speaker 6>for them.</v>

2771
01:56:09.001 --> 01:56:14.001
<v Speaker 6>So they have a use lobbyists and they've</v>
<v Speaker 6>used to politicians that they have </v>

2772
01:56:15.090 --> 01:56:18.900
<v Speaker 6>relationships with and people that they </v>
<v Speaker 6>can pay off to try to keep them in May,</v>

2773
01:56:18.901 --> 01:56:20.940
<v Speaker 6>out of New York.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Man,</v>

2774
01:56:20.941 --> 01:56:25.941
<v Speaker 6>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing because his millions of </v>

2775
01:56:25.941 --> 01:56:28.131
<v Speaker 6>people in New York and it's a tiny </v>
<v Speaker 6>handful of slots that are keeping them </v>

2776
01:56:28.131 --> 01:56:29.550
<v Speaker 6>in Mayo and it's all financial and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's made from New York City.</v>

2777
01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:31.920
<v Speaker 6>Can you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to talk out of school,</v>

2778
01:56:31.950 --> 01:56:35.160
<v Speaker 6>so I don't know what the real details of</v>
<v Speaker 6>their dispute or I don't want to pretend</v>

2779
01:56:35.161 --> 01:56:35.550
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2780
01:56:35.551 --> 01:56:37.980
<v Speaker 6>just because I worked for the UFC that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're correct or anybody's career.</v>

2781
01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:42.990
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it looks to me like some typical </v>

2782
01:56:42.990 --> 01:56:42.990
<v Speaker 6>union goons,</v>
<v Speaker 6>strong arm bullshit,</v>

2783
01:56:42.990 --> 01:56:44.260
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's a,</v>

2784
01:56:44.670 --> 01:56:45.330
<v Speaker 6>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a,</v>

2785
01:56:45.380 --> 01:56:46.920
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think unions are important.</v>

2786
01:56:46.921 --> 01:56:47.970
<v Speaker 6>I'm a fan of unions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a,</v>

2787
01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:50.700
<v Speaker 6>I'm a fan of people getting paid well </v>
<v Speaker 6>for,</v>

2788
01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:52.050
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for their efforts.</v>

2789
01:56:52.051 --> 01:56:54.030
<v Speaker 6>And I think that there's a lot of merit </v>
<v Speaker 6>in that,</v>

2790
01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:59.360
<v Speaker 6>but when they do stupid shit like this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it ruins it for all the good </v>

2791
01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:01.500
<v Speaker 6>benefits of the Union code.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They started using themselves as a.</v>

2792
01:57:01.501 --> 01:57:06.501
<v Speaker 6>they're like a mob of course,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they're trying to enforce their own </v>

2793
01:57:06.501 --> 01:57:07.830
<v Speaker 6>interests and it has nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 6>safety or nothing to do with the public.</v>

2794
01:57:07.831 --> 01:57:12.831
<v Speaker 6>And to see these for horror politicians </v>
<v Speaker 6>that have been bought off by these </v>

2795
01:57:12.831 --> 01:57:16.671
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to see them lobbying to keep the UFC </v>

2796
01:57:16.671 --> 01:57:16.671
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just discussed as standard.</v>

2797
01:57:16.671 --> 01:57:17.640
<v Speaker 6>Getting closer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think so.</v>

2798
01:57:17.670 --> 01:57:22.670
<v Speaker 6>I think it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's Joe Rogan Madison Square Garden,</v>

2799
01:57:23.190 --> 01:57:25.560
<v Speaker 6>Madison Square Garden calling a UFC </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking fight.</v>

2800
01:57:25.561 --> 01:57:26.580
<v Speaker 6>Can you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2801
01:57:26.581 --> 01:57:28.770
<v Speaker 6>I could imagine it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That'll fuck it.</v>

2802
01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:30.000
<v Speaker 6>Freaked out a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

2803
01:57:30.060 --> 01:57:32.730
<v Speaker 6>Madison Square Garden now I wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>know.</v>

2804
01:57:32.890 --> 01:57:36.630
<v Speaker 6>I found from the casino that when you </v>
<v Speaker 6>guys were all there,</v>

2805
01:57:36.650 --> 01:57:41.650
<v Speaker 6>it wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It wouldn't shake me because it's a </v>

2806
01:57:41.650 --> 01:57:41.650
<v Speaker 6>historic building,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's at the end of the day,</v>

2807
01:57:41.650 --> 01:57:41.760
<v Speaker 6>it's just a building that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2969
02:04:33.311 --> 02:04:36.551
<v Speaker 4>animal called a civet right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it shits it out and when it hits it </v>

2970
02:04:36.551 --> 02:04:37.440
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

<v Speaker 6>unbelievably smooth and delicious.</v>

2976
02:04:48.450 --> 02:04:50.880
<v Speaker 6>And it doesn't taste like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Someone has to say it.</v>

2977
02:04:50.900 --> 02:04:53.250
<v Speaker 6>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2978
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:58.430
<v Speaker 6>I guess they clean it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just fucking drain the beans a little </v>

2979
02:04:58.430 --> 02:04:58.770
<v Speaker 6>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They cleaned the shit.</v>

2980
02:04:58.771 --> 02:05:00.150
<v Speaker 6>I try that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's good.</v>

2981
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:02.110
<v Speaker 6>I'm telling you it's delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where he gets a different.</v>

2982
02:05:02.130 --> 02:05:04.800
<v Speaker 6>You're going to specialty stores to get </v>
<v Speaker 6>an order online.</v>

2983
02:05:05.130 --> 02:05:07.080
<v Speaker 6>But the fact that someone likes coffee </v>
<v Speaker 6>so much,</v>

2984
02:05:07.081 --> 02:05:08.640
<v Speaker 6>they picked it out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A pilot shit.</v>

2985
02:05:08.641 --> 02:05:11.430
<v Speaker 6>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This little cunty fucking civic.</v>

2986
02:05:11.630 --> 02:05:13.050
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they had been.</v>

2987
02:05:13.230 --> 02:05:14.700
<v Speaker 6>Someone had to try it for the first </v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

2988
02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:15.840
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll think about it.</v>

2989
02:05:15.841 --> 02:05:17.640
<v Speaker 6>Anything that people have eaten yet?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We've,</v>

2990
02:05:17.670 --> 02:05:19.970
<v Speaker 6>we've lobsters and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Someone had to go,</v>

2991
02:05:19.990 --> 02:05:21.690
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that might be tasty.</v>

2992
02:05:21.900 --> 02:05:25.270
<v Speaker 6>They had to give it a shot and they.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I think at this stuff they,</v>

2993
02:05:25.470 --> 02:05:27.100
<v Speaker 6>they tried like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2994
02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:29.450
<v Speaker 6>someone had to try poison ivy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2995
02:05:29.580 --> 02:05:34.580
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the eight that they had to try all </v>

2996
02:05:34.580 --> 02:05:34.580
<v Speaker 6>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then we finally said,</v>

2997
02:05:34.580 --> 02:05:34.580
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>leave that shit alone.</v>

2998
02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:38.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's funny how some plants are delicious</v>

2999
02:05:38.461 --> 02:05:43.461
<v Speaker 6>for you and other plants will kill you </v>
<v Speaker 6>immediately and they all like sorta had </v>

3000
02:05:43.461 --> 02:05:48.440
<v Speaker 6>someone had a fucking figure that shit </v>
<v Speaker 6>out for us that they've all been </v>

3001
02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:48.440
<v Speaker 6>documented.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's essentially into.</v>

3002
02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:53.230
<v Speaker 6>Except for like the rain forest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's they don't know what the fuck's </v>

3003
02:05:53.230 --> 02:05:56.481
<v Speaker 6>in there and you deal with like the </v>
<v Speaker 6>gigantic vast reaches of the Amazon and </v>

3004
02:05:57.151 --> 02:05:59.820
<v Speaker 6>how many plants are in there that we </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't even know about this.</v>

3005
02:06:00.060 --> 02:06:05.060
<v Speaker 6>It's very possible they send botness </v>
<v Speaker 6>down there all the time and they </v>

3006
02:06:05.060 --> 02:06:05.060
<v Speaker 6>discover new shit and we're just fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>destroying.</v>

3007
02:06:06.380 --> 02:06:08.650
<v Speaker 6>Tell us it's no big fucking deal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3008
02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:10.420
<v Speaker 6>the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where's it Borneo?</v>

3009
02:06:10.460 --> 02:06:12.420
<v Speaker 6>Was it born here?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They keep finding new species.</v>

3010
02:06:12.421 --> 02:06:17.421
<v Speaker 6>They've been funding a bunch of new </v>
<v Speaker 6>species and then like tropical rain </v>

3011
02:06:17.421 --> 02:06:18.600
<v Speaker 6>forest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>new species of primates,</v>

3012
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:21.720
<v Speaker 6>new species of bugs and these species of</v>
<v Speaker 6>birds.</v>

3013
02:06:22.140 --> 02:06:27.140
<v Speaker 6>It's like they're constantly finding all</v>
<v Speaker 6>these weird freaky fucking animals they </v>

3014
02:06:27.140 --> 02:06:30.681
<v Speaker 6>didn't even know existed and it's 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We do not have a good inventory of all </v>

3015
02:06:31.591 --> 02:06:33.510
<v Speaker 6>the life on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We got most of it though.</v>

3016
02:06:34.070 --> 02:06:35.100
<v Speaker 6>Not Big.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Todd.</v>

3017
02:06:35.250 --> 02:06:37.190
<v Speaker 6>Todd.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3018
02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:42.840
<v Speaker 6>What about lochness monster?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's most likely horseshit or </v>

3019
02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:44.930
<v Speaker 6>it could be a just a big fish or an </v>
<v Speaker 6>eagle has to be you.</v>

3020
02:06:45.250 --> 02:06:48.870
<v Speaker 6>Now they've been.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They've been looking around enough.</v>

3021
02:06:48.930 --> 02:06:50.840
<v Speaker 6>Well then that didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just look around enough.</v>

3022
02:06:50.850 --> 02:06:55.560
<v Speaker 6>They've actually trolled the sonars know</v>
<v Speaker 6>that and they thought it was a place.</v>

3023
02:06:55.560 --> 02:06:57.120
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or I think,</v>

3024
02:06:57.550 --> 02:07:00.480
<v Speaker 6>but if I'm not mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that animal breeze water.</v>

3025
02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:03.240
<v Speaker 6>I think that animal is supposed to be an</v>
<v Speaker 6>air breathing thing.</v>

3026
02:07:03.241 --> 02:07:04.380
<v Speaker 6>Like a whale,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3027
02:07:04.381 --> 02:07:06.390
<v Speaker 6>that kind of situation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3028
02:07:06.450 --> 02:07:08.040
<v Speaker 6>And it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know though,</v>

3029
02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:09.930
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if they do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they breathe the water,</v>

3030
02:07:10.170 --> 02:07:13.320
<v Speaker 6>but I just don't think that a dinosaur </v>
<v Speaker 6>could be alive today.</v>

3031
02:07:13.590 --> 02:07:15.810
<v Speaker 6>It just doesn't make sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But how cool would that be?</v>

3032
02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:17.490
<v Speaker 6>It would be pretty fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That'd be cool.</v>

3033
02:07:17.491 --> 02:07:19.350
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You think will bring dinosaurs back?</v>

3034
02:07:20.100 --> 02:07:25.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think they're going to do that </v>

3035
02:07:25.100 --> 02:07:26.361
<v Speaker 6>eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going to start doing some of that </v>

3036
02:07:26.361 --> 02:07:28.221
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't imagine them not because </v>

3037
02:07:28.221 --> 02:07:28.560
<v Speaker 6>they're already talking about mammoth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think there's some Russian.</v>

3038
02:07:28.650 --> 02:07:30.400
<v Speaker 6>They're getting close scientists </v>
<v Speaker 6>figuring that out.</v>

3039
02:07:30.410 --> 02:07:32.310
<v Speaker 6>I just think either they're very close </v>
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

3040
02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:33.450
<v Speaker 6>but they've only been extinct.</v>

3041
02:07:33.450 --> 02:07:35.350
<v Speaker 6>How many years?</v>
<v Speaker 6>13,000.</v>

3042
02:07:35.351 --> 02:07:37.000
<v Speaker 6>I was going to say somewhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>pleistocene.</v>

3043
02:07:37.100 --> 02:07:42.100
<v Speaker 6>Somewhere around the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's nothing compared to fucking </v>

3044
02:07:42.100 --> 02:07:42.100
<v Speaker 6>dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3045
02:07:42.100 --> 02:07:42.120
<v Speaker 6>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3046
02:07:42.150 --> 02:07:47.150
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they think that they might have been </v>

3047
02:07:47.150 --> 02:07:47.530
<v Speaker 6>killed the same way they think that a </v>
<v Speaker 6>lot of speculation as to what killed off</v>

3048
02:07:47.531 --> 02:07:52.531
<v Speaker 6>the woolly mammoth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they think the woolly mammoth and </v>

3049
02:07:52.531 --> 02:07:52.531
<v Speaker 6>the tooth tiger might've been killed off</v>
<v Speaker 6>by meteors.</v>

3050
02:07:52.531 --> 02:07:53.170
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3051
02:07:53.171 --> 02:07:54.110
<v Speaker 6>They think that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3052
02:07:54.490 --> 02:07:55.000
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3053
02:07:55.001 --> 02:08:00.001
<v Speaker 6>the decline of the last ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the abruptness might've might've </v>

3054
02:08:00.001 --> 02:08:04.801
<v Speaker 6>been started or triggered initially by </v>
<v Speaker 6>meteor showers because they found that </v>

3055
02:08:04.801 --> 02:08:07.060
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think 12,000</v>

3056
02:08:07.061 --> 02:08:08.710
<v Speaker 6>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the Strada,</v>

3057
02:08:08.711 --> 02:08:11.050
<v Speaker 6>when they do like coil soil samples,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3058
02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:16.830
<v Speaker 6>12,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>years ago they found this type of glass </v>

3059
02:08:16.830 --> 02:08:18.310
<v Speaker 6>that exists at nuclear test sites in on </v>
<v Speaker 6>meteor impact sites.</v>

3060
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:21.810
<v Speaker 6>And it's everywhere all over the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they,</v>

3061
02:08:21.811 --> 02:08:24.760
<v Speaker 6>they found in all sorts of different </v>
<v Speaker 6>countries and it's all in the same area,</v>

3062
02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:30.120
<v Speaker 6>so they're pretty sure that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 6>happened and they think that that </v>

3063
02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:30.430
<v Speaker 6>might've coincided with a lot of mass </v>
<v Speaker 6>extinctions,</v>

3064
02:08:30.431 --> 02:08:34.540
<v Speaker 6>including like the wooly mammoths and </v>
<v Speaker 6>saber tooth tigers because they found,</v>

3065
02:08:34.541 --> 02:08:39.541
<v Speaker 6>they found some areas really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 6>areas where they found like a lot of </v>

3066
02:08:39.541 --> 02:08:42.841
<v Speaker 6>bullying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>mammoth skeletons all together in one </v>

3067
02:08:42.841 --> 02:08:42.841
<v Speaker 6>place.</v>

3068
02:08:42.841 --> 02:08:42.841
<v Speaker 6>Like they all died together.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

3069
02:08:42.841 --> 02:08:44.890
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I tell what kind of classes that they're</v>

3070
02:08:44.891 --> 02:08:46.700
<v Speaker 6>fighting impact glass.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

3071
02:08:46.710 --> 02:08:48.460
<v Speaker 6>what does it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like greenish.</v>

3072
02:08:48.490 --> 02:08:49.250
<v Speaker 6>It's really kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is it,</v>

3073
02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:54.350
<v Speaker 6>like big huge pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's microscopic the </v>

3074
02:08:54.350 --> 02:08:54.600
<v Speaker 6>scopic unless,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3075
02:08:54.610 --> 02:08:56.140
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to say microscopic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's the wrong word.</v>

3076
02:08:56.170 --> 02:08:58.060
<v Speaker 6>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it varies in size,</v>

3077
02:08:58.061 --> 02:09:01.440
<v Speaker 6>but some of it is small pieces that they</v>
<v Speaker 6>just find that's pretty cool in the uh,</v>

3078
02:09:01.690 --> 02:09:03.040
<v Speaker 6>well let me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let me find it like,</v>

3079
02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:07.660
<v Speaker 6>so I can answer your question,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but impact glass glass 12,000</v>

3080
02:09:07.661 --> 02:09:09.610
<v Speaker 6>years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3081
02:09:09.611 --> 02:09:14.611
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fascinating shit because what </v>

3082
02:09:14.611 --> 02:09:17.071
<v Speaker 6>they're saying essentially is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>most likely that if something like that </v>

3083
02:09:17.071 --> 02:09:21.841
<v Speaker 6>did happen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people died and then it </v>

3084
02:09:21.841 --> 02:09:21.841
<v Speaker 6>might've killed off a huge percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 6>our population,</v>

3085
02:09:21.841 --> 02:09:26.821
<v Speaker 6>but it's so long ago that the stories </v>
<v Speaker 6>about it,</v>

3086
02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:30.220
<v Speaker 6>that the fables,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everything that was if there was writing</v>

3087
02:09:30.221 --> 02:09:31.750
<v Speaker 6>back then everything that was written </v>
<v Speaker 6>down,</v>

3088
02:09:31.751 --> 02:09:32.200
<v Speaker 6>it's gone.</v>

3089
02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:35.110
<v Speaker 6>It's long gone and it's my.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It might be very well that the amount of</v>

3090
02:09:35.111 --> 02:09:40.111
<v Speaker 6>civilization that we had back then was </v>
<v Speaker 6>like we were on our way to developing a </v>

3091
02:09:40.111 --> 02:09:43.351
<v Speaker 6>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's pretty remote and pre pretty </v>

3092
02:09:43.351 --> 02:09:45.530
<v Speaker 6>crude and then it got reset and then we </v>
<v Speaker 6>had to start all over again.</v>

3093
02:09:45.531 --> 02:09:50.531
<v Speaker 6>You think it was crude?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Might be if there's a lot of highly </v>

3094
02:09:51.581 --> 02:09:55.150
<v Speaker 6>intelligent beings before us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

3095
02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:57.430
<v Speaker 6>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just as no evidence of it.</v>

3096
02:09:57.460 --> 02:09:58.120
<v Speaker 6>True.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

3097
02:09:58.150 --> 02:10:00.520
<v Speaker 6>What have you found new evidence </v>
<v Speaker 6>somewhere and you found out?</v>

3098
02:10:00.521 --> 02:10:05.521
<v Speaker 6>Well in Greenland,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's an alien ship that came here </v>

3099
02:10:05.521 --> 02:10:08.911
<v Speaker 6>from another fucking planet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They found it in the ground and they </v>

3100
02:10:08.911 --> 02:10:08.911
<v Speaker 6>found all this alien fossils and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>had a whole city set up here.</v>

3101
02:10:08.911 --> 02:10:10.270
<v Speaker 6>One hundred million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd be like,</v>

3102
02:10:10.271 --> 02:10:11.500
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no shit.</v>

3103
02:10:11.501 --> 02:10:12.110
<v Speaker 6>You would.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3104
02:10:12.120 --> 02:10:14.100
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but until they find something like that,</v>

3105
02:10:14.101 --> 02:10:15.610
<v Speaker 6>you just talking to your ass,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

3106
02:10:15.670 --> 02:10:17.160
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what I said about bigfoot.</v>

3107
02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:18.990
<v Speaker 6>Said that about bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3108
02:10:19.140 --> 02:10:22.390
<v Speaker 6>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Except I defer to that lady that,</v>

3109
02:10:22.391 --> 02:10:23.290
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that late.</v>

3110
02:10:23.300 --> 02:10:28.300
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she knows a little bit more Jane </v>

3111
02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:28.300
<v Speaker 6>Goodall's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's a bad bitch.</v>

3112
02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:28.360
<v Speaker 6>She knows what the fuck she's talking </v>
<v Speaker 6>about.</v>

3113
02:10:28.810 --> 02:10:31.240
<v Speaker 6>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that could be just her super excited.</v>

3114
02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:36.570
<v Speaker 6>The melt glass at 1700 degrees equal to </v>
<v Speaker 6>an atomic bomb.</v>

3115
02:10:37.140 --> 02:10:38.670
<v Speaker 6>Meteorites are thought to have </v>
<v Speaker 6>triggered,</v>

3116
02:10:38.700 --> 02:10:42.660
<v Speaker 6>triggered a cold snap that killed off </v>
<v Speaker 6>every civil early civilization and giant</v>

3117
02:10:42.661 --> 02:10:43.590
<v Speaker 6>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3118
02:10:43.710 --> 02:10:45.960
<v Speaker 6>This is what they're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Evidence of this media rights,</v>

3119
02:10:45.961 --> 02:10:47.820
<v Speaker 6>intense heat was found on two </v>
<v Speaker 6>continents.</v>

3120
02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:53.000
<v Speaker 6>Researchers believed the huge,</v>
<v Speaker 6>huge cosmic impact triggered a vicious </v>

3121
02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.320
<v Speaker 6>cold snap which caused widespread </v>
<v Speaker 6>destruction.</v>

3122
02:10:55.350 --> 02:10:58.470
<v Speaker 6>The international team found a substance</v>
<v Speaker 6>known as melt glass,</v>

3123
02:10:58.680 --> 02:11:01.560
<v Speaker 6>which forms the temperatures of 17 whoa.</v>

3124
02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:07.960
<v Speaker 6>Seventeen to 100 degrees to 2,200</v>
<v Speaker 6>degrees Celsius and can result in a </v>

3125
02:11:10.941 --> 02:11:14.360
<v Speaker 6>cosmic body hitting the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's what it's is a result from.</v>

3126
02:11:14.361 --> 02:11:16.640
<v Speaker 6>So they think that that's like one of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the leading.</v>

3127
02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:17.570
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's big man.</v>

3128
02:11:17.571 --> 02:11:19.820
<v Speaker 6>They have big pieces of the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was small,</v>

3129
02:11:19.821 --> 02:11:20.390
<v Speaker 6>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's big.</v>

3130
02:11:20.391 --> 02:11:22.850
<v Speaker 6>It's in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't look like glass though.</v>

3131
02:11:23.300 --> 02:11:23.990
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's weird.</v>

3132
02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:26.290
<v Speaker 6>It's created by it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3133
02:11:26.291 --> 02:11:28.460
<v Speaker 6>it does here more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It looks like,</v>

3134
02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:33.520
<v Speaker 6>like melted glass right out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can just looking at sort of a weird </v>

3135
02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:34.510
<v Speaker 6>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>

3136
02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:40.270
<v Speaker 6>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a thing called the clovis </v>

3137
02:11:40.270 --> 02:11:42.320
<v Speaker 6>comment and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's uh,</v>

3138
02:11:42.340 --> 02:11:42.820
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3139
02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:45.690
<v Speaker 6>a comment that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3140
02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:48.470
<v Speaker 6>an impact site that they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were uh,</v>

3141
02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:53.740
<v Speaker 6>researching too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're trying to figure out is around </v>

3142
02:11:53.740 --> 02:11:53.740
<v Speaker 6>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 6>same time around 12,000</v>

3143
02:11:53.740 --> 02:11:54.810
<v Speaker 6>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They think that uh,</v>

3144
02:11:54.920 --> 02:11:59.920
<v Speaker 6>that might've coincided with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the or might have rather been the source</v>

3145
02:12:00.351 --> 02:12:04.040
<v Speaker 6>of a lot of the stories of cataclysms </v>
<v Speaker 6>and like the old texts,</v>

3146
02:12:04.370 --> 02:12:09.370
<v Speaker 6>like the Sumerian texts and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the ancient stories from the original</v>

3147
02:12:09.891 --> 02:12:14.891
<v Speaker 6>Hebrew Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a lot of those cataclysmic stories </v>

3148
02:12:14.891 --> 02:12:17.501
<v Speaker 6>might've had something to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Retelling of the days of the impacts of </v>

3149
02:12:17.501 --> 02:12:17.770
<v Speaker 6>the meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the showers.</v>

3150
02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:20.710
<v Speaker 6>Were you bored in school?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3151
02:12:20.711 --> 02:12:21.630
<v Speaker 6>I was pretty bored.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3152
02:12:21.710 --> 02:12:23.670
<v Speaker 6>because they weren't teaching this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3153
02:12:23.671 --> 02:12:24.410
<v Speaker 6>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3154
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:29.470
<v Speaker 6>the problem with school is they're just </v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to get you to conform to sitting </v>

3155
02:12:29.470 --> 02:12:31.160
<v Speaker 6>in a chair and absorbing information,</v>
<v Speaker 6>doing what they asked you to do,</v>

3156
02:12:31.161 --> 02:12:32.380
<v Speaker 6>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3157
02:12:32.390 --> 02:12:33.620
<v Speaker 6>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you got a kid.</v>

3158
02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:38.920
<v Speaker 6>The way to get a kid excited about </v>
<v Speaker 6>learning is to get them excited about </v>

3159
02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:39.380
<v Speaker 6>learning something that he's interested </v>
<v Speaker 6>in of course.</v>

3160
02:12:39.381 --> 02:12:42.310
<v Speaker 6>And then once they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3161
02:12:44.530 --> 02:12:49.250
<v Speaker 6>And then once you do that then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>learning becomes fun for most of us.</v>

3162
02:12:49.251 --> 02:12:51.230
<v Speaker 6>Learning became a bore,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a burden.</v>

3163
02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:52.020
<v Speaker 6>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3164
02:12:52.130 --> 02:12:54.830
<v Speaker 6>So I had to kind of relearn what </v>
<v Speaker 6>learning meant.</v>

3165
02:12:54.890 --> 02:12:56.930
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how you handle that with your kids?</v>

3166
02:12:57.920 --> 02:12:59.630
<v Speaker 6>In what way?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How were they learning?</v>

3167
02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:01.580
<v Speaker 6>Just traditional school.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3168
02:13:01.581 --> 02:13:02.300
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

3169
02:13:02.301 --> 02:13:02.750
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3170
02:13:02.751 --> 02:13:07.751
<v Speaker 6>are they having a good time with it or </v>
<v Speaker 6>are they going through the same shit we </v>

3171
02:13:07.751 --> 02:13:08.440
<v Speaker 6>did growing up because my kids are still</v>
<v Speaker 6>too young.</v>

3172
02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:11.680
<v Speaker 6>They're the start that next year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess the,</v>

3173
02:13:11.730 --> 02:13:16.730
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the four year old is in preschool right </v>

3174
02:13:16.730 --> 02:13:19.631
<v Speaker 6>now and it's fascinating to watch them </v>
<v Speaker 6>first start to interact with their </v>

3175
02:13:19.631 --> 02:13:23.231
<v Speaker 6>little friends and they're just starting</v>
<v Speaker 6>to learn things and they're learning </v>

3176
02:13:23.231 --> 02:13:25.850
<v Speaker 6>things and it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And what's really interesting to me is I</v>

3177
02:13:25.851 --> 02:13:29.060
<v Speaker 6>was watching the other day and they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>teaching this class and you know,</v>

3178
02:13:29.061 --> 02:13:30.530
<v Speaker 6>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're teaching them stuff and they get</v>

3179
02:13:30.531 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 6>excited when they raise their hand and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they</v>

3180
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:34.720
<v Speaker 1>figured out and they're right and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>all like laughing and having fun.</v>

3181
02:13:34.721 --> 02:13:39.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm a lot happens where this stops being</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>

3182
02:13:39.730 --> 02:13:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Like how does this become the gross snus</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is nonchalant high school teachers </v>

3183
02:13:45.691 --> 02:13:47.610
<v Speaker 1>who don't give a fuck and kids in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

3184
02:13:47.611 --> 02:13:52.611
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck and everybody seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be misguided and lost and ready to </v>

3185
02:13:52.611 --> 02:13:54.050
<v Speaker 1>fucking just get out of there and break </v>
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

3186
02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:57.370
<v Speaker 1>I got to answer the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first day they gave you homework.</v>

3187
02:13:58.420 --> 02:14:01.290
<v Speaker 1>I said it though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should do homework.</v>

3188
02:14:01.291 --> 02:14:02.290
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3189
02:14:02.430 --> 02:14:07.430
<v Speaker 1>school was absolutely fun until they </v>
<v Speaker 1>started fucking giving you homework and </v>

3190
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:08.250
<v Speaker 1>if and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was busy work.</v>

3191
02:14:08.580 --> 02:14:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Most of that shit was busy work and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>it did,</v>

3192
02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:12.790
<v Speaker 1>it looked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3193
02:14:12.850 --> 02:14:16.900
<v Speaker 1>only you can only focus on certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3194
02:14:16.910 --> 02:14:19.690
<v Speaker 1>like one thing or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever your,</v>

3195
02:14:19.730 --> 02:14:24.730
<v Speaker 1>your subjects already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really trying to gather </v>

3196
02:14:24.730 --> 02:14:24.730
<v Speaker 1>information on.</v>

3197
02:14:24.730 --> 02:14:27.250
<v Speaker 1>You can only focus on them for a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of amount of hours in the death </v>

3198
02:14:27.250 --> 02:14:30.830
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you're going to lose the </v>

3199
02:14:30.830 --> 02:14:33.051
<v Speaker 1>absorption and when you force kids into </v>
<v Speaker 1>like getting home and then working out </v>

3200
02:14:33.780 --> 02:14:38.780
<v Speaker 1>what about the rest of their life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make an imbalanced </v>

3201
02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:38.780
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3202
02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:41.110
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to school eight hours a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day after that,</v>

3203
02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:46.200
<v Speaker 1>that should be good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should be an eight hours doing anything </v>

3204
02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:46.290
<v Speaker 1>a day should be good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

3205
02:14:46.291 --> 02:14:48.420
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to handle that.</v>

3206
02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:53.480
<v Speaker 1>My son is almost three at preschool next</v>
<v Speaker 1>year in the fall and I don't know.</v>

3207
02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:55.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how.</v>

3208
02:14:55.500 --> 02:14:57.460
<v Speaker 1>What are your thoughts on the way to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3209
02:14:57.820 --> 02:15:02.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously you made a living in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very controversial and I'm a unusual way</v>

3210
02:15:04.250 --> 02:15:05.850
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by becoming a radio guy,</v>

3211
02:15:05.851 --> 02:15:08.030
<v Speaker 1>like very few people make it as a radio </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

3212
02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:11.400
<v Speaker 1>so like mean a lot of parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're big scare.</v>

3213
02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:15.480
<v Speaker 1>The big fear is what if my son or </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter becomes a loser?</v>

3214
02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if I fail to get them ready for the</v>

3215
02:15:18.181 --> 02:15:23.181
<v Speaker 1>real world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they're out there and they </v>

3216
02:15:23.181 --> 02:15:23.181
<v Speaker 1>become like this big burden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then when they hear something like,</v>

3217
02:15:23.181 --> 02:15:24.690
<v Speaker 1>hey mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a radio DJ.</v>

3218
02:15:24.970 --> 02:15:25.980
<v Speaker 1>No son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

3219
02:15:25.981 --> 02:15:30.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to make it in the radio </v>

3220
02:15:30.981 --> 02:15:32.961
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The retail business has one of the </v>

3221
02:15:32.961 --> 02:15:32.961
<v Speaker 1>smallest rates of success of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>business in America.</v>

3222
02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do that?</v>

3223
02:15:34.081 --> 02:15:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Or do you go work with your funder and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stocks and bonds and mom,</v>

3224
02:15:37.540 --> 02:15:38.700
<v Speaker 1>my dad said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go for it.</v>

3225
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Well then your dad's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was an amazing guy.</v>

3226
02:15:41.101 --> 02:15:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he absolutely.</v>

3227
02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:44.730
<v Speaker 1>He told me from a very young age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

3228
02:15:44.731 --> 02:15:49.731
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find something you really enjoy because </v>

3229
02:15:49.731 --> 02:15:49.731
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have to do it for a long fucking time.</v>

3230
02:15:49.731 --> 02:15:52.050
<v Speaker 1>He didn't give a fuck if he wore a suit </v>
<v Speaker 1>or if we,</v>

3231
02:15:52.090 --> 02:15:53.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to be a radio guy.</v>

3232
02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:57.690
<v Speaker 1>And he supported me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He supported me every step of the way.</v>

3233
02:15:57.750 --> 02:16:00.810
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's funny you say what you just did</v>

3234
02:16:00.811 --> 02:16:05.430
<v Speaker 1>because I remember my friends were so </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking jealous of me because I was able</v>

3235
02:16:05.431 --> 02:16:08.910
<v Speaker 1>to go for my dream and they want to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the same fucking dream,</v>

3236
02:16:08.911 --> 02:16:13.911
<v Speaker 1>but they had the parents that you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>marked where they basically said there </v>

3237
02:16:13.911 --> 02:16:18.111
<v Speaker 1>was like five careers that were the hot </v>
<v Speaker 1>careers back then and they've basically </v>

3238
02:16:18.111 --> 02:16:21.240
<v Speaker 1>forced their kids to go to college to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a job with one of those areas.</v>

3239
02:16:21.540 --> 02:16:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the safest route.</v>

3240
02:16:23.850 --> 02:16:25.050
<v Speaker 1>And those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys,</v>

3241
02:16:25.380 --> 02:16:27.240
<v Speaker 1>they're miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're absolutely miserable.</v>

3242
02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're fucked because stuck on </v>

3243
02:16:32.720 --> 02:16:32.720
<v Speaker 1>that path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing he could do.</v>

3244
02:16:32.720 --> 02:16:32.890
<v Speaker 1>You get the mortgage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got the wife,</v>

3245
02:16:32.891 --> 02:16:34.330
<v Speaker 1>you've got the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got the job.</v>

3246
02:16:34.330 --> 02:16:39.330
<v Speaker 1>That's a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you gonna quit this good </v>

3247
02:16:39.330 --> 02:16:39.330
<v Speaker 1>job and then how are you going to live?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do.</v>

3248
02:16:39.330 --> 02:16:42.651
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be a musician now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really not your time to be a musician </v>

3249
02:16:42.651 --> 02:16:43.330
<v Speaker 1>was when you were 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to be fair,</v>

3250
02:16:43.331 --> 02:16:45.730
<v Speaker 1>my dad always said have something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall back on.</v>

3251
02:16:45.820 --> 02:16:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Like he was aware that the odds were </v>
<v Speaker 1>against me,</v>

3252
02:16:49.181 --> 02:16:50.080
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3253
02:16:50.081 --> 02:16:52.330
<v Speaker 1>make sure that you have something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall back on.</v>

3254
02:16:52.390 --> 02:16:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Which I never really did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just Kinda,</v>

3255
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:57.880
<v Speaker 1>I was either going to do that and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a bomb or something I think.</v>

3256
02:16:58.180 --> 02:17:01.510
<v Speaker 1>But as far as my kid goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want him to just try every.</v>

3257
02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever he enjoys.</v>

3258
02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pursuing enjoys.</v>

3259
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:07.120
<v Speaker 1>I always say that if there's a guy out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

3260
02:17:07.121 --> 02:17:09.280
<v Speaker 1>anybody out there that's making comic </v>
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>

3261
02:17:09.730 --> 02:17:11.110
<v Speaker 1>you can make comic books too.</v>

3262
02:17:11.170 --> 02:17:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's a guy out there who's making </v>

3263
02:17:16.170 --> 02:17:16.170
<v Speaker 1>movies you can make movies to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a person.</v>

3264
02:17:16.170 --> 02:17:16.660
<v Speaker 1>You've got to figure out what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

3265
02:17:16.661 --> 02:17:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you're going to figure it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

3266
02:17:18.430 --> 02:17:20.710
<v Speaker 1>You might not be able to figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it was so easy to do,</v>

3267
02:17:20.711 --> 02:17:21.990
<v Speaker 1>everybody be doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3268
02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:24.490
<v Speaker 1>but if someone's doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be done,</v>

3269
02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:25.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

3270
02:17:25.361 --> 02:17:28.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out and along the way</v>

3271
02:17:28.210 --> 02:17:30.730
<v Speaker 1>you learned about yourself and you learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>about getting shit done.</v>

3272
02:17:31.210 --> 02:17:33.100
<v Speaker 1>You learned about making things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

3273
02:17:33.101 --> 02:17:38.101
<v Speaker 1>that's what people don't learn when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the safe route and they save the </v>

3274
02:17:38.101 --> 02:17:38.101
<v Speaker 1>take that safe route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3275
02:17:38.101 --> 02:17:39.670
<v Speaker 1>they don't learn about making shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

3276
02:17:39.890 --> 02:17:44.890
<v Speaker 1>It'll learn about the thrill of carving </v>
<v Speaker 1>a life out of something that's like a </v>

3277
02:17:44.890 --> 02:17:47.380
<v Speaker 1>really difficult business like the radio</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

3278
02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:49.810
<v Speaker 1>like you've got to kick back at the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the day and go,</v>

3279
02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:50.560
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

3280
02:17:50.590 --> 02:17:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm opie from opie and Anthony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the biggest radio teams in </v>

3281
02:17:55.590 --> 02:17:56.530
<v Speaker 1>the history of the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A 10 year period.</v>

3282
02:17:56.531 --> 02:17:58.860
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no one can take that away.</v>

3283
02:17:59.470 --> 02:18:01.420
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking awesome.</v>

3284
02:18:01.660 --> 02:18:03.220
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing I've done in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole life,</v>

3285
02:18:03.250 --> 02:18:04.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eighteen years old,</v>

3286
02:18:04.510 --> 02:18:06.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to think about how few of them,</v>

3287
02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:12.120
<v Speaker 1>how few people who get into radio ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to be an opening and a few people </v>

3288
02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:12.280
<v Speaker 1>get to be on a show like opie and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Anthony,</v>

3289
02:18:12.430 --> 02:18:14.800
<v Speaker 1>a few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were scared to take the chance.</v>

3290
02:18:14.801 --> 02:18:19.801
<v Speaker 1>So you can understand why your parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be reluctant to try to encourage </v>

3291
02:18:20.471 --> 02:18:23.290
<v Speaker 1>you to do that kind of a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't want your kid to be a loser</v>

3292
02:18:23.291 --> 02:18:25.150
<v Speaker 1>and you see something like radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

3293
02:18:25.151 --> 02:18:26.440
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking kid.</v>

3294
02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:31.800
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what they really thought were </v>

3295
02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:32.230
<v Speaker 1>they weren't talking to me when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>away doing this fucking thing.</v>

3296
02:18:32.230 --> 02:18:33.550
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3297
02:18:34.090 --> 02:18:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they had conversations like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>

3298
02:18:36.071 --> 02:18:37.510
<v Speaker 1>I hope he gives up on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3299
02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:42.600
<v Speaker 1>fortunately one of these days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my parents didn't have any influence on </v>

3300
02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:43.540
<v Speaker 1>me by the time I was 21.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing they could say.</v>

3301
02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:46.360
<v Speaker 1>I was so stubborn like I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I had it in my mind,</v>

3302
02:18:46.361 --> 02:18:47.530
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't matter to me.</v>

3303
02:18:47.531 --> 02:18:49.960
<v Speaker 1>So when I started doing standup comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mother was like,</v>

3304
02:18:49.990 --> 02:18:54.990
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never really thought you were that </v>

3305
02:18:54.990 --> 02:18:54.990
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

3306
02:18:54.990 --> 02:18:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom didn't think I was funny at all.</v>

3307
02:18:54.990 --> 02:18:55.530
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3308
02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:57.580
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never looked back at 18.</v>

3309
02:18:57.910 --> 02:18:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3310
02:18:58.571 --> 02:18:59.640
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came from a,</v>

3311
02:18:59.850 --> 02:19:01.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a strange upbringing.</v>

3312
02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:06.600
<v Speaker 1>My mom was fucking mentally insane and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew I had to get the fuck out of there.</v>

3313
02:19:07.380 --> 02:19:10.390
<v Speaker 1>So when all those stories about your dad</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the gambling,</v>

3314
02:19:10.900 --> 02:19:12.880
<v Speaker 1>gambling,</v>

3338
02:19:55.731 --> 02:19:58.070
<v Speaker 4>if your mother had a mental illness back</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the day,</v>

3339
02:19:58.100 --> 02:19:59.430
<v Speaker 4>nobody did anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not.</v>

3340
02:19:59.450 --> 02:20:01.280
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have any results.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She went away.</v>

3341
02:20:01.370 --> 02:20:05.000
<v Speaker 4>She would go away to mental hospitals </v>
<v Speaker 4>and as kids we were like,</v>

3348
02:20:14.810 --> 02:20:18.380
<v Speaker 4>the bad kind a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've been able to pinpoint that shit.</v>

3349
02:20:18.440 --> 02:20:19.800
<v Speaker 4>So when they do give you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's recap,</v>

3350
02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:20.990
<v Speaker 4>now they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they kinda,</v>

3351
02:20:21.470 --> 02:20:26.470
<v Speaker 4>they understand a little better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but back then they were just frying the </v>

3352
02:20:26.470 --> 02:20:26.510
<v Speaker 4>whole fucking brand and hoping they </v>
<v Speaker 4>returning some shit off.</v>

3353
02:20:28.380 --> 02:20:33.380
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's really interesting when you look </v>

3354
02:20:33.380 --> 02:20:35.561
<v Speaker 4>at like respected peer reviewed medical </v>
<v Speaker 4>journals from like the 16 hundreds and </v>

3355
02:20:36.290 --> 02:20:39.840
<v Speaker 4>shed thought you could love bottom eyes </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

3356
02:20:40.190 --> 02:20:42.060
<v Speaker 4>Totally cool thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

3357
02:20:42.150 --> 02:20:44.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what year it was where they</v>
<v Speaker 4>lobotomized people,</v>

3358
02:20:44.361 --> 02:20:47.780
<v Speaker 4>but I'm making the number up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but whenever they used to do it,</v>

3359
02:20:47.781 --> 02:20:50.120
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they thought that was the way to do it.</v>

3360
02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:55.150
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is a good middle of fucking </v>

3361
02:20:55.150 --> 02:20:56.990
<v Speaker 4>stick in there and scrambling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put some day they're going to look at </v>

3362
02:20:56.990 --> 02:20:58.430
<v Speaker 4>the shit we're doing today and going </v>
<v Speaker 4>into these idiots back then thought this</v>

3363
02:20:58.431 --> 02:20:59.180
<v Speaker 4>was the right thing.</v>

3364
02:20:59.210 --> 02:20:59.780
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3365
02:20:59.781 --> 02:21:01.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>artificial hips,</v>

3366
02:21:01.370 --> 02:21:06.370
<v Speaker 4>artificial hips tweaked me out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I can see when someone needs them </v>

3367
02:21:06.370 --> 02:21:06.370
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta do what you gotTa do,</v>

3368
02:21:06.370 --> 02:21:09.470
<v Speaker 4>but I know in a few years they're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be able to regenerate a hip.</v>

3369
02:21:09.500 --> 02:21:12.440
<v Speaker 4>Of course they're going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out to do some really nutty shit.</v>

3370
02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:15.590
<v Speaker 4>They built a woman's bladder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They made a fake bladder.</v>

3371
02:21:16.010 --> 02:21:17.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They built it in a fucking.</v>

3372
02:21:17.840 --> 02:21:19.470
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno how it built it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3373
02:21:19.530 --> 02:21:24.530
<v Speaker 4>Do you use some sort of tissue from her </v>
<v Speaker 4>skin and constructed a bladder one and </v>

3374
02:21:25.061 --> 02:21:28.210
<v Speaker 4>then put it in her body didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3375
02:21:29.140 --> 02:21:30.350
<v Speaker 4>This is a test.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her urine.</v>

3376
02:21:32.890 --> 02:21:36.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't drink other people's urine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just my own.</v>

3377
02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:39.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't even drink my own anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tried it a few times.</v>

3378
02:21:39.731 --> 02:21:41.030
<v Speaker 4>I tried.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that bad.</v>

3379
02:21:41.330 --> 02:21:42.860
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3381
02:21:44.691 --> 02:21:49.691
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those things where you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>survive on a boat if you drink your </v>

3382
02:21:49.691 --> 02:21:51.930
<v Speaker 4>urine or you could die of dehydration.</v>

3384
02:21:55.730 --> 02:21:59.450
<v Speaker 4>I hear you saying that as a father you'd</v>
<v Speaker 4>be able to kill a deer if your kids were</v>

3385
02:21:59.451 --> 02:22:01.220
<v Speaker 4>hungry and you knew that's what you had </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do.</v>

3386
02:22:01.490 --> 02:22:06.490
<v Speaker 4>Brewer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brewer told me the greatest thing about </v>

3387
02:22:06.490 --> 02:22:06.490
<v Speaker 4>being a father when he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you become a father,</v>

3388
02:22:06.490 --> 02:22:09.500
<v Speaker 4>you completely understand that you could</v>
<v Speaker 4>kill another human being.</v>

3389
02:22:09.550 --> 02:22:11.600
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't understand that.</v>

3390
02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:14.540
<v Speaker 4>My wife was pregnant at the time and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was hanging out with her and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>but there was a,</v>

3398
02:22:29.130 --> 02:22:33.030
<v Speaker 4>there was a girl that pushed my son </v>
<v Speaker 4>right into a pole bad and I had a little</v>

3399

<v Speaker 4>He was probably a year and a half at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time was a little girl,</v>

3403

<v Speaker 4>just like in general,</v>

3405
02:22:44.490 --> 02:22:49.490
<v Speaker 4>but the kid was pretty damn scared out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of my mind because the parent wasn't </v>

3406
02:22:49.490 --> 02:22:49.490
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>when you see your kid cry,</v>

3410
02:22:58.880 --> 02:23:00.120
<v Speaker 4>it's brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3411
02:23:00.180 --> 02:23:01.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty brutal.</v>

3412
02:23:01.340 --> 02:23:01.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3413
02:23:02.060 --> 02:23:04.260
<v Speaker 4>I've learned since then you've got to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little cooler about it.</v>

3414
02:23:04.260 --> 02:23:08.310
<v Speaker 4>But I lost my fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my shit because she went right at him,</v>

3415
02:23:08.360 --> 02:23:10.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was being an innocent little kid.</v>

3416
02:23:10.261 --> 02:23:13.080
<v Speaker 4>Just kind of like shadow playing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and following them around.</v>

3417
02:23:13.470 --> 02:23:16.860
<v Speaker 4>She turned around and gave him a shove.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went flying to this poll.</v>

3418
02:23:16.890 --> 02:23:20.250
<v Speaker 4>I thought he was fucked up to say that </v>
<v Speaker 4>most kids that do that,</v>

3419
02:23:20.251 --> 02:23:23.010
<v Speaker 4>like physical kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's because that's happening to them.</v>

3420
02:23:23.410 --> 02:23:23.950
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3421
02:23:24.330 --> 02:23:26.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well we all know kids are sponges,</v>

3422
02:23:26.521 --> 02:23:27.300

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

02:23:27.301 --> 02:23:30.210
<v Speaker 4>They say when kids react violently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like out of,</v>

3424
02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:32.070
<v Speaker 4>out of sort like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of believe that.</v>

3425
02:23:32.180 --> 02:23:37.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I noticed the most kids are passive </v>

3426
02:23:37.180 --> 02:23:38.310
<v Speaker 4>aggressive assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go to the playground with your kids.</v>

3427
02:23:38.340 --> 02:23:39.960
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you handle it?</v>

3428
02:23:40.140 --> 02:23:42.950

<v Speaker 4>And you let him get like thrown out.</v>

3429
02:23:43.170 --> 02:23:45.750
<v Speaker 4>I have a two and a half year old and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a four and a half year old,</v>

3430
02:23:45.780 --> 02:23:47.340
<v Speaker 4>so four and a half year old.</v>

3431
02:23:47.340 --> 02:23:49.410
<v Speaker 4>I've watched her lose a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 4>distance,</v>

3432
02:23:49.740 --> 02:23:51.800
<v Speaker 4>but the two and a half year old I </v>
<v Speaker 4>mirrored her.</v>

3433
02:23:52.450 --> 02:23:54.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm her shadow wherever she goes.</v>

3434
02:23:54.660 --> 02:23:59.660
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I let I let my kid get roughed up a </v>

3435
02:23:59.660 --> 02:23:59.660
<v Speaker 4>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not that,</v>

3436
02:23:59.660 --> 02:23:59.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being pushed into.</v>

3437
02:23:59.660 --> 02:24:01.170
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just doesn't seem very necessary.</v>

3438
02:24:01.230 --> 02:24:03.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would definitely say something,</v>

3439
02:24:03.060 --> 02:24:05.310
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't really badly hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3440
02:24:05.340 --> 02:24:07.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying not to scream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3441
02:24:07.140 --> 02:24:09.090
<v Speaker 4>but it's hard when you're even </v>
<v Speaker 4>embarrassed.</v>

3442
02:24:09.120 --> 02:24:12.960
<v Speaker 4>I lost it and then some parents came up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't her kid.</v>

3443
02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:18.320
<v Speaker 4>It was like a friend of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the parent that was watching the kid </v>

3444
02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:18.960
<v Speaker 4>and she's trying to go at me and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3445
02:24:18.990 --> 02:24:23.990
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't even know what the fuck she </v>

3446
02:24:23.990 --> 02:24:24.510
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was she saying because I'm yelling,</v>

3447
02:24:24.750 --> 02:24:26.250
<v Speaker 4>so she thinks I'm yelling at her kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3448
02:24:26.251 --> 02:24:28.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm technically not yelling at your kid.</v>

3449
02:24:28.050 --> 02:24:29.940
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am losing it because as you see,</v>

3450
02:24:29.941 --> 02:24:33.290
<v Speaker 4>my kid is screaming over here and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

3451
02:24:33.370 --> 02:24:38.370
<v Speaker 4>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't even know what the fuck </v>

3452
02:24:38.370 --> 02:24:38.370
<v Speaker 4>happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

3453
02:24:38.370 --> 02:24:38.370
<v Speaker 4>fuck right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

3454
02:24:38.370 --> 02:24:39.310
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you were,</v>

3455
02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:40.950
<v Speaker 4>were you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you weren't watching your kid.</v>

3456
02:24:41.530 --> 02:24:43.080
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3457
02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:48.110
<v Speaker 4>People get real defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very emotional when you're dealing </v>

3458
02:24:48.110 --> 02:24:50.040
<v Speaker 4>with children and injuries and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you,</v>

3459
02:24:50.041 --> 02:24:55.041
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you like see how fucking wacky the </v>

3460
02:24:55.041 --> 02:24:56.100
<v Speaker 4>world is getting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you worry about the future?</v>

3461
02:24:56.101 --> 02:24:59.040
<v Speaker 4>Each other fucking mean you guys as part</v>
<v Speaker 4>of your show,</v>

3462
02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:04.080
<v Speaker 4>you're constantly covering everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fucked up about the world and </v>

3463
02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:05.400
<v Speaker 4>this constant stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's brutal.</v>

3464
02:25:05.790 --> 02:25:06.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3465
02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:09.060
<v Speaker 4>I kinda liked the days where I just had </v>
<v Speaker 4>to worry about myself.</v>

3466
02:25:09.660 --> 02:25:10.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also,</v>

3467
02:25:11.130 --> 02:25:16.130
<v Speaker 4>I also know that I will absolutely take </v>
<v Speaker 4>one before my kid does.</v>

3468
02:25:16.830 --> 02:25:19.860
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I will jump in front of a car and</v>

3469
02:25:19.861 --> 02:25:21.510
<v Speaker 4>all that shit now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well obviously,</v>

3470
02:25:21.511 --> 02:25:23.000
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we hope it doesn't.</v>

3471
02:25:23.470 --> 02:25:23.980
<v Speaker 4>Course</v>

3472
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:25.540
<v Speaker 1>I did all that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3473
02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:27.340
<v Speaker 1>plays into it being a father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

3474
02:25:27.341 --> 02:25:32.341
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all stuff I've never had to </v>

3475
02:25:32.341 --> 02:25:33.220
<v Speaker 1>think about or worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This world is beautiful in certain spots</v>

3476
02:25:33.221 --> 02:25:38.221
<v Speaker 1>for certain amounts of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the key is trying to take those </v>

3477
02:25:38.221 --> 02:25:40.240
<v Speaker 1>certain spots where it's beautiful for </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amounts of time,</v>

3478
02:25:40.270 --> 02:25:42.310
<v Speaker 1>extended amount of time and spread out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spots.</v>

3479
02:25:42.370 --> 02:25:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that that really is.</v>

3480
02:25:44.740 --> 02:25:49.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about obviously we all like </v>

3481
02:25:49.740 --> 02:25:49.740
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3482
02:25:49.740 --> 02:25:50.200
<v Speaker 1>And we all love people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all love people.</v>

3483
02:25:50.260 --> 02:25:50.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3484
02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:53.380
<v Speaker 1>we all have really good friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all have family,</v>

3485
02:25:53.381 --> 02:25:56.110
<v Speaker 1>we all have people that we enjoy seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>in movies.</v>

3486
02:25:56.680 --> 02:25:59.980
<v Speaker 1>The key is to bring everybody else into </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3487
02:26:00.070 --> 02:26:02.850
<v Speaker 1>like sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an environment like this.</v>

3488
02:26:02.890 --> 02:26:05.110
<v Speaker 1>This idea that we need constant </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict,</v>

3489
02:26:05.650 --> 02:26:10.650
<v Speaker 1>I think that's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some outdated ape shit and I think that </v>

3490
02:26:10.650 --> 02:26:14.101
<v Speaker 1>that needs to be looked over and move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward and it can be managed and done </v>

3491
02:26:14.101 --> 02:26:14.860
<v Speaker 1>with conflict.</v>

3492
02:26:14.890 --> 02:26:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so stupid after awhile.</v>

3493
02:26:18.110 --> 02:26:23.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that every fucking day in the </v>

3494
02:26:23.110 --> 02:26:24.550
<v Speaker 1>news we're talking about going into some</v>
<v Speaker 1>new country and there's some new,</v>

<v Speaker 1>from the fucking 19 fifties.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's an escarpment.</v>

3516

<v Speaker 1>The escarpments and cliff faces of </v>
<v Speaker 1>northern Mallee,</v>

3517
02:27:30.370 --> 02:27:35.370

<v Speaker 1>burrowing into the earth erecting a </v>

3518
02:27:35.681 --> 02:27:40.681
<v Speaker 1>formidable set of defenses to protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is essentially become our titus </v>

3519
02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:43.830

<v Speaker 1>they got a layer that is,</v>

3521
02:27:46.580 --> 02:27:51.580

<v Speaker 1>middle of a mountain that is Wacko </v>

3522
02:27:51.580 --> 02:27:52.030
<v Speaker 1>propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did that,</v>

3523
02:27:52.570 --> 02:27:54.130
<v Speaker 1>a couple of days ago?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3524
02:27:54.190 --> 02:27:59.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it's today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Today's news I haven't </v>

3525
02:27:59.190 --> 02:27:59.190
<v Speaker 1>really checked into 10 hours ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently.</v>

3526
02:27:59.190 --> 02:28:00.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true.</v>

3527
02:28:00.070 --> 02:28:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there really isn't.</v>

3528
02:28:01.361 --> 02:28:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Al Qaeda has a fucking country all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden there.</v>

3529
02:28:03.340 --> 02:28:03.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>

3530
02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:06.460
<v Speaker 1>I haven't turned on CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fox,</v>

3531
02:28:06.461 --> 02:28:08.320
<v Speaker 1>MSNBC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like two or three days.</v>

3532
02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:13.320
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like the government wrote that </v>

3533
02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:16.051
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that a journalist wrote </v>

3534
02:28:16.051 --> 02:28:16.051
<v Speaker 1>that the way this is written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like the government said,</v>

3535
02:28:16.051 --> 02:28:20.911
<v Speaker 1>here go like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like the government hired </v>

3536
02:28:20.911 --> 02:28:23.461
<v Speaker 1>some gay guy hiding from the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gay and he's very creative and he </v>

3537
02:28:24.621 --> 02:28:27.480
<v Speaker 1>writes and he has a boyfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one can know,</v>

3538
02:28:27.770 --> 02:28:30.530
<v Speaker 1>and so he writes this kind of shit for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

3539
02:28:30.531 --> 02:28:31.880
<v Speaker 1>They pull him aside and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

3540
02:28:32.360 --> 02:28:37.360
<v Speaker 1>we need something that really gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>people excited about us going over to </v>

<v Speaker 1>your boyfriend for me in this gay dudes </v>

3599
02:31:02.790 --> 02:31:07.790

<v Speaker 6>Scary Shit.</v>

3604
02:31:14.511 --> 02:31:15.740
<v Speaker 6>When a friend has something like that,</v>

3605
02:31:16.030 --> 02:31:17.680
<v Speaker 1>you should check out the movie 50 slash </v>
<v Speaker 1>50.</v>

3606
02:31:17.681 --> 02:31:20.000
<v Speaker 1>It deals with seth and then</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a young kid getting this cancer and</v>

02:31:27.821 --> 02:31:30.430
<v Speaker 3>having to do like the cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

3611
02:31:31.110 --> 02:31:36.110
<v Speaker 1>I went on a date with a girl once she.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She died of cancer when I wanted a day </v>

3612
02:31:36.110 --> 02:31:38.220
<v Speaker 1>with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was already suffering from cancer.</v>

3613
02:31:38.221 --> 02:31:42.480
<v Speaker 1>When my friend hooked us up together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went on like this double date.</v>

3614
02:31:42.870 --> 02:31:44.370
<v Speaker 1>She was very nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very nice.</v>

3615
02:31:45.420 --> 02:31:50.420
<v Speaker 1>She had something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she had her lymph nodes already </v>

3616
02:31:50.420 --> 02:31:50.420
<v Speaker 1>removed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had some,</v>

3617
02:31:50.610 --> 02:31:53.700
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some issue like her neck had like a scar</v>

3618
02:31:53.701 --> 02:31:58.701
<v Speaker 1>on it and she wore a scar to cover up </v>
<v Speaker 1>this a scarf rather to cover up the </v>

3619
02:31:58.701 --> 02:32:03.351
<v Speaker 1>scar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was very pretty and very smart and </v>

3620
02:32:03.351 --> 02:32:03.351
<v Speaker 1>very nice and like so vibrant and full </v>
<v Speaker 1>of life.</v>

3621
02:32:03.351 --> 02:32:08.030
<v Speaker 1>She was such a fun person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was hard to believe that she was on her </v>

3622
02:32:08.030 --> 02:32:09.270
<v Speaker 1>way out the door and then within a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>

3623
02:32:09.390 --> 02:32:10.940
<v Speaker 1>she was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3624
02:32:10.950 --> 02:32:12.030
<v Speaker 1>It was really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3625
02:32:12.420 --> 02:32:13.160
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3626
02:32:13.170 --> 02:32:15.900
<v Speaker 1>my friend was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you mind going on this double date</v>

3627
02:32:16.050 --> 02:32:16.670
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3628
02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:18.340
<v Speaker 1>with my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3629
02:32:18.390 --> 02:32:19.860
<v Speaker 1>my girlfriend's friend?</v>

3630
02:32:19.920 --> 02:32:20.580
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3631
02:32:20.581 --> 02:32:21.420
<v Speaker 1>sure why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

3632
02:32:21.620 --> 02:32:23.250
<v Speaker 1>but I gotta tell you something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's dying of cancer.</v>

3633
02:32:24.540 --> 02:32:25.440
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3634
02:32:25.441 --> 02:32:27.450
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I go,</v>

3635
02:32:27.451 --> 02:32:28.980
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a tough sell for me.</v>

3636
02:32:29.420 --> 02:32:31.950
<v Speaker 1>She was a tough sell for anywhere she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

3637
02:32:32.250 --> 02:32:34.320
<v Speaker 1>She was alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>

3638
02:32:34.370 --> 02:32:39.370
<v Speaker 1>if she did wind up dying of cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the night that we went and hung out </v>

3639
02:32:39.431 --> 02:32:43.620
<v Speaker 1>and she was very alive and she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing and happy and it was weird.</v>

3640
02:32:43.621 --> 02:32:46.830
<v Speaker 1>It was weird to know that I was saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that she had already had an operation.</v>

3641
02:32:46.831 --> 02:32:49.320
<v Speaker 1>She wore a scarf because she had a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>scar on her neck,</v>

3642
02:32:49.321 --> 02:32:51.300
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had something removed from her neck,</v>

3643
02:32:51.600 --> 02:32:53.910
<v Speaker 1>but she was still like really pretty and</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fun.</v>

3644
02:32:53.911 --> 02:32:58.140
<v Speaker 1>And she was only 27 or 28 I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then how long ago was this?</v>

3645
02:32:58.230 --> 02:32:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Long Time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A long,</v>

3646
02:32:59.260 --> 02:33:00.180
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time ago.</v>

3647
02:33:00.180 --> 02:33:04.350
<v Speaker 1>It was in the nineties and she died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

3648
02:33:04.351 --> 02:33:09.351
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird to think that your body can </v>

3649
02:33:09.351 --> 02:33:12.261
<v Speaker 1>just go wacky on Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And literally your body starts growing </v>

3650
02:33:12.541 --> 02:33:14.460
<v Speaker 1>shit that's not supposed to be growing </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3651
02:33:14.461 --> 02:33:17.640
<v Speaker 1>And it enters into your system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then before you know it,</v>

3652
02:33:17.910 --> 02:33:19.680
<v Speaker 1>you've got a real problem and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's shutting down.</v>

3653
02:33:19.890 --> 02:33:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Just going to check out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horrible.</v>

3654
02:33:21.960 --> 02:33:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3655
02:33:22.770 --> 02:33:23.760
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

3656
02:33:24.070 --> 02:33:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the bathroom.</v>

3657
02:33:25.921 --> 02:33:30.921
<v Speaker 1>What the hell happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard through the grape vine that a,</v>

3658
02:33:31.260 --> 02:33:36.260

<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

3660
02:33:39.420 --> 02:33:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this true?</v>

3661
02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you get into the bowels of the </v>

3662
02:33:46.040 --> 02:33:48.351
<v Speaker 1>Chrysler building with some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutty dude and he climbed up on top of </v>

3663
02:33:48.351 --> 02:33:49.440
<v Speaker 1>the roof and you got like a video of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

3664
02:33:50.310 --> 02:33:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or there's no video.</v>

3665
02:33:52.320 --> 02:33:54.390
<v Speaker 1>There's no video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no video out,</v>

3666
02:33:54.480 --> 02:33:56.040
<v Speaker 1>there's no video out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hurts.</v>

3667
02:33:56.150 --> 02:34:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rumor is you heard through the </v>

3668
02:34:01.150 --> 02:34:01.150
<v Speaker 1>grapevine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rumor is that,</v>

3669
02:34:01.150 --> 02:34:01.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3670
02:34:01.650 --> 02:34:03.480
<v Speaker 1>I want to say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just tell you what I've heard.</v>

3671
02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Rumor is that you have a video that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were there personally,</v>

3672
02:34:07.830 --> 02:34:12.830
<v Speaker 1>while some fucking lunatic was climbing </v>
<v Speaker 1>out onto the actual eagles that overhang</v>

3673
02:34:16.860 --> 02:34:20.380
<v Speaker 1>on the Chrysler building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's literally walking around on this</v>

3674
02:34:20.381 --> 02:34:23.080
<v Speaker 1>metal that is not designed to carry a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking grown man.</v>

3675
02:34:23.081 --> 02:34:24.190
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that.</v>

3676
02:34:24.191 --> 02:34:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Metal would be slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slippery as fuck.</v>

3677
02:34:26.951 --> 02:34:31.951
<v Speaker 1>He's got street shoes on and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing on top of this thing and it's </v>

3678
02:34:31.951 --> 02:34:36.331
<v Speaker 1>how many floors you're seeing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many floors is it might be 60 </v>

3679
02:34:36.331 --> 02:34:36.760
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

3680
02:34:36.860 --> 02:34:40.750
<v Speaker 1>fuck that guy's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not seen this.</v>

3681
02:34:40.751 --> 02:34:45.751
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard this is what I heard is what </v>

3682
02:34:45.751 --> 02:34:45.751
<v Speaker 1>I've heard.</v>

3683
02:34:45.751 --> 02:34:45.751
<v Speaker 1>Is it true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it gets really windy up there.</v>

3684
02:34:45.751 --> 02:34:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Is it real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you.</v>

3685
02:34:46.900 --> 02:34:49.430
<v Speaker 1>How do you get there in the first place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

3686
02:34:49.570 --> 02:34:51.940
<v Speaker 1>How does one get there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say hypothetically,</v>

3687
02:34:52.090 --> 02:34:54.030
<v Speaker 1>how would one get there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get there.</v>

3688
02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:57.460
<v Speaker 1>If you were writing a novel that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly how it all went down,</v>

3689
02:34:57.880 --> 02:35:01.240
<v Speaker 1>how would you have the characters do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a novel.</v>

3690
02:35:01.241 --> 02:35:02.890
<v Speaker 1>This is all fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're in.</v>

3691
02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:03.580
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>

3692
02:35:03.581 --> 02:35:08.581
<v Speaker 1>Didn't actually happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it did happen in your book and </v>

3693
02:35:08.581 --> 02:35:08.950
<v Speaker 1>your book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would the guy do it?</v>

3694
02:35:09.040 --> 02:35:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me a little nervous.</v>

3695
02:35:15.311 --> 02:35:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be nervous.</v>

3696
02:35:16.271 --> 02:35:17.800
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing he can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all hypothetical.</v>

3697
02:35:17.801 --> 02:35:19.180
<v Speaker 1>We've already laid that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3698
02:35:19.181 --> 02:35:21.490
<v Speaker 1>the Guy Moses that took me Undergrad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3699
02:35:21.910 --> 02:35:22.740

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3700
02:35:22.840 --> 02:35:24.820
<v Speaker 1>he knows some things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's done some things.</v>

3701
02:35:25.060 --> 02:35:27.510
<v Speaker 1>He might have been on the Eagle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was him.</v>

3702
02:35:27.520 --> 02:35:29.070
<v Speaker 1>The same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might have been.</v>

3703
02:35:29.250 --> 02:35:30.970
<v Speaker 1>He might have been on your book and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

3704
02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:32.020
<v Speaker 1>his book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be.</v>

<v Speaker 1>coming out in March.</v>

3706
02:35:35.800 --> 02:35:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's the slipper eagle that </v>

3708
02:35:41.430 --> 02:35:41.430
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker's stood on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3709

<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just why?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Looking at my skin's crawling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My assholes quivering.</v>

<v Speaker 1>sweating crazy.</v>

3712
02:35:50.950 --> 02:35:52.990
<v Speaker 1>I haven't even talked about this on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>own show yet.</v>

3713
02:35:54.040 --> 02:35:55.270
<v Speaker 1>What did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

3714
02:35:55.271 --> 02:35:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what the fuck he's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>so fucking pissed off.</v>

3715
02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I mean,</v>

3716
02:36:00.281 --> 02:36:02.960
<v Speaker 1>but you can word gets out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Internet has no secrets.</v>

3717
02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would he take me on this amazing </v>

3718
02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:09.040
<v Speaker 1>tour and it allow me to tow and allow me</v>
<v Speaker 1>to film it,</v>

3719
02:36:09.470 --> 02:36:13.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because maybe he's a crazy.</v>

3720
02:36:13.510 --> 02:36:15.880
<v Speaker 1>That's why he's fucking climbing around </v>
<v Speaker 1>on metal eagles.</v>

3721
02:36:15.880 --> 02:36:20.880
<v Speaker 1>Sixty nine store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if he slipped and you look up his </v>

3722

<v Speaker 1>bucket list?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moses Gates.</v>

3723
02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:23.740
<v Speaker 1>What if he slipped off and you had that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my first anxiety attack,</v>

3724
02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:25.690
<v Speaker 1>panic attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking at that,</v>

3725
02:36:25.870 --> 02:36:27.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I went home that night,</v>

3726
02:36:28.390 --> 02:36:30.340
<v Speaker 1>over and over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over again,</v>

3727
02:36:30.341 --> 02:36:33.010
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pictured him falling from that Eagle.</v>

3728
02:36:33.070 --> 02:36:38.070
<v Speaker 1>What would you have done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you have gotten in trouble if he </v>

3729
02:36:38.070 --> 02:36:38.070
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think you would have been okay.</v>

3731
02:36:39.670 --> 02:36:41.920
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know I didn't push them?</v>

3732
02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:47.070
<v Speaker 1>You have good lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you push them and him sitting </v>

3733
02:36:47.070 --> 02:36:47.070
<v Speaker 1>on Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that him?</v>

<v Speaker 1>So it's on the Internet,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's a crazy fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His book comes out and March Kim in his </v>

3747

3748
02:37:17.551 --> 02:37:17.551
<v Speaker 1>top of thing on his twitter page </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically like,</v>

3749
02:37:17.551 --> 02:37:21.591
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't tell anybody that I'm standing on </v>

3750
02:37:21.591 --> 02:37:24.621
<v Speaker 1>top of this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile he's got a photo of it </v>

3751

<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

3752
02:37:24.621 --> 02:37:27.120
<v Speaker 1>if you have a photo of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we went off the hook,</v>

3753
02:37:27.180 --> 02:37:27.960
<v Speaker 1>we went under ground,</v>

3754
02:37:28.050 --> 02:37:31.140
<v Speaker 4>the mole people used to live and then he</v>
<v Speaker 4>goes,</v>

3755
02:37:31.141 --> 02:37:33.480
<v Speaker 4>I want to show you something else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I go,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm up,</v>

3757
02:37:34.260 --> 02:37:39.260
<v Speaker 4>but he won't tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We take a cab ride and I kind of seen </v>

3758
02:37:39.260 --> 02:37:39.540
<v Speaker 4>the distance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the Chrysler building.</v>

3759
02:37:39.541 --> 02:37:44.541
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's fucking taking me to the </v>

3760
02:37:44.541 --> 02:37:44.541
<v Speaker 4>Chrysler building.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>

3761
02:37:44.541 --> 02:37:46.650
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden we got past security.</v>

3762
02:37:47.340 --> 02:37:52.340
<v Speaker 4>His name was on a list and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we went in the elevators and we went up </v>

3763
02:37:52.340 --> 02:37:53.580
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the,</v>

3764
02:37:53.700 --> 02:37:55.320
<v Speaker 4>I want to say like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3765
02:37:55.321 --> 02:37:56.310
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say,</v>

3766
02:37:56.640 --> 02:38:00.330
<v Speaker 4>but in the fifties and then all of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sudden we get out of the elevator and do</v>

3767
02:38:00.331 --> 02:38:01.600
<v Speaker 4>a quick dark to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3768
02:38:01.660 --> 02:38:04.080
<v Speaker 4>the stairwell and then we went up </v>
<v Speaker 4>another,</v>

3769
02:38:04.081 --> 02:38:09.081
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like maybe seven or eight floors and </v>

3770
02:38:09.081 --> 02:38:10.650
<v Speaker 4>next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there might've been a door unlocked.</v>

3771
02:38:10.651 --> 02:38:14.370
<v Speaker 4>That isn't an office that is abandoned.</v>

3772
02:38:16.590 --> 02:38:21.590
<v Speaker 1>And from that you can get that office </v>
<v Speaker 1>allegedly to the bowels or rather the </v>

3773
02:38:22.051 --> 02:38:23.820
<v Speaker 1>peak the attic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

3774
02:38:23.821 --> 02:38:28.821
<v Speaker 1>You're going there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was doing the first part of </v>

3775
02:38:28.821 --> 02:38:31.230
<v Speaker 1>the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God was this.</v>

3776
02:38:32.660 --> 02:38:33.510
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3777
02:38:33.540 --> 02:38:38.540
<v Speaker 1>this abandoned office leads to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it used to be an observation </v>

3778
02:38:38.540 --> 02:38:39.750
<v Speaker 1>deck back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the railings really low.</v>

3779
02:38:39.751 --> 02:38:42.480
<v Speaker 1>It's only about four feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3780
02:38:42.540 --> 02:38:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People didn't give a fuck back then.</v>

3781
02:38:44.630 --> 02:38:46.240
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's harder people and that.</v>

3782
02:38:46.290 --> 02:38:48.000
<v Speaker 1>And you're looking at it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're watching,</v>

3783
02:38:48.180 --> 02:38:49.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching this podcast,</v>

3784
02:38:49.801 --> 02:38:53.550
<v Speaker 1>that's the iconic eagles that had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a shitload of movies and whatnot.</v>

3785
02:38:53.640 --> 02:38:57.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot my fucking hands are sweating.</v>

3786
02:38:57.940 --> 02:39:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Looking at that picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my hands are sweating.</v>

3787
02:39:00.121 --> 02:39:02.880
<v Speaker 1>My toes were wiggling back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm shitting my pants.</v>

3788
02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:06.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to unload them my fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyber right now.</v>

3789
02:39:06.660 --> 02:39:11.660
<v Speaker 1>So this guy knew that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the office space was abandoned and this </v>

3790
02:39:11.660 --> 02:39:16.431
<v Speaker 1>guy knew also that the door was unlocked</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he knew how to do it when he'd </v>

3791
02:39:16.950 --> 02:39:18.030
<v Speaker 1>gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's obviously,</v>

3792
02:39:18.031 --> 02:39:19.740
<v Speaker 1>he's taking fucking pictures up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's,</v>

3793
02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:22.500
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole network of people.</v>

3794
02:39:22.501 --> 02:39:24.300
<v Speaker 1>They go to each other cities and do this</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

3795
02:39:24.301 --> 02:39:26.940
<v Speaker 1>So I'm on top of each other's rooms and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

3796
02:39:26.941 --> 02:39:31.941
<v Speaker 1>This is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This video is that guys on the ground </v>

3797
02:39:31.941 --> 02:39:33.891
<v Speaker 1>and like old water tunnels and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys like climbing the fucking bridges </v>

3798
02:39:33.891 --> 02:39:35.960
<v Speaker 1>and all that Shell of being up there </v>
<v Speaker 1>lesbians.</v>

3799
02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:41.720
<v Speaker 1>So we had to go up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the door was the door to the </v>

3800
02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:45.171
<v Speaker 1>outside was open sliding door and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like an old fucking observation </v>

3801
02:39:45.171 --> 02:39:47.310
<v Speaker 1>deck with those eagles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as I'm at,</v>

3802
02:39:47.820 --> 02:39:50.190
<v Speaker 1>as I'm at one of the eagles just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>filming shit,</v>

3803
02:39:50.790 --> 02:39:55.790
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden I look over and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing on the head of the Eagle.</v>

3804
02:39:56.150 --> 02:39:59.460
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

3805
02:39:59.461 --> 02:40:01.470
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the picture of soaking wet.</v>

3806
02:40:01.970 --> 02:40:06.540
<v Speaker 1>And then he did it again and that I do </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a video of them doing it.</v>

3807
02:40:06.541 --> 02:40:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do have,</v>

3808
02:40:10.650 --> 02:40:13.230
<v Speaker 1>when he turns around and get back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>safety,</v>

3809
02:40:13.770 --> 02:40:17.220
<v Speaker 1>I saw the slight slip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw how it would happen.</v>

3810
02:40:17.340 --> 02:40:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where that's all it would take because </v>

3811
02:40:22.340 --> 02:40:22.340
<v Speaker 1>this thing is like Kinda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's first of all,</v>

3812
02:40:22.340 --> 02:40:22.660
<v Speaker 1>it's not flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3813
02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:27.680
<v Speaker 1>it's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's some kind of metal which looks </v>

3814
02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:27.960
<v Speaker 1>really slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a wind.</v>

3815
02:40:28.380 --> 02:40:30.330
<v Speaker 1>The wind was about 30 miles an hour that</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

3816
02:40:30.780 --> 02:40:33.420
<v Speaker 1>And I saw him turn around and that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>slight slip.</v>

3817
02:40:33.421 --> 02:40:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it would have happened.</v>

3818
02:40:35.190 --> 02:40:39.960
<v Speaker 1>So when I went home that night and I saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>that play over and over again in my head</v>

3819
02:40:39.961 --> 02:40:42.090
<v Speaker 1>and I had my first fucking anxiety tech.</v>

3820
02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:47.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm a middle aged man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never had an anxiety attack before </v>

3821
02:40:47.840 --> 02:40:51.050
<v Speaker 1>my heart was pounding out of my chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I woke up my wife and she had a fucking </v>

3822
02:40:51.050 --> 02:40:53.430
<v Speaker 1>calm me down because over and over again</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw him fucking fallen.</v>

3823
02:40:53.850 --> 02:40:58.850
<v Speaker 1>If I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have given you a hit of some of </v>

3824
02:40:58.850 --> 02:40:58.850
<v Speaker 1>this shit and it will put you right over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the edge.</v>

3825
02:40:58.850 --> 02:41:02.690
<v Speaker 1>No Shit right there at that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you give a hit of that green crack </v>

3826
02:41:02.690 --> 02:41:02.690
<v Speaker 1>and he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3827
02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:06.510
<v Speaker 1>And then we might have done other shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching that.</v>

3828
02:41:06.511 --> 02:41:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Just watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That almost gives me a heart attack.</v>

3829
02:41:08.850 --> 02:41:12.660
<v Speaker 1>So I got video of him going out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kissing the head and he's a crazy man.</v>

3830
02:41:12.750 --> 02:41:14.430
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it kills people below to.</v>

3832
02:41:17.730 --> 02:41:19.590
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean breaks off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it broke off,</v>

3833
02:41:19.591 --> 02:41:21.900
<v Speaker 1>what if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if his weight.</v>

3834
02:41:21.900 --> 02:41:24.870

<v Speaker 1>pound man or whatever the alleyways.</v>

<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

3837
02:41:28.381 --> 02:41:30.880
<v Speaker 1>So that part of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could tell that thrill.</v>

3838
02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:32.970
<v Speaker 1>We know who we have coming in.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So like he's hanging off and climbing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pulling himself up like thousands of</v>

3844
02:41:52.140 --> 02:41:54.660
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>

<v Speaker 4>is not done yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3886
02:43:43.090 --> 02:43:43.630
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3887
02:43:43.660 --> 02:43:44.980
<v Speaker 4>It's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're really.</v>

3888
02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.200
<v Speaker 4>When is it going to be done?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe next year.</v>

3889
02:43:48.070 --> 02:43:53.070
<v Speaker 4>That's got to be crazy to live in a city</v>
<v Speaker 4>and see something like that happen </v>

3890
02:43:53.070 --> 02:43:53.290
<v Speaker 4>because all of us that experienced </v>
<v Speaker 4>September 11th,</v>

3891
02:43:53.291 --> 02:43:55.690
<v Speaker 4>we experience it from the west coast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3892
02:43:55.720 --> 02:43:56.520
<v Speaker 4>it was creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3893
02:43:56.620 --> 02:43:57.650
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3894
02:43:57.780 --> 02:44:02.780
<v Speaker 4>I'll never forget the smell of a plastic</v>
<v Speaker 4>and death.</v>

3895
02:44:05.300 --> 02:44:07.030
<v Speaker 4>You could smell dramatic pause.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3896
02:44:07.750 --> 02:44:08.890
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>

3897
02:44:08.940 --> 02:44:10.750
<v Speaker 4>I stayed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't living in the city at the time,</v>

3898
02:44:10.751 --> 02:44:15.751
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I stayed for a few days so we could </v>

3899
02:44:15.751 --> 02:44:15.751
<v Speaker 4>broadcast because they shut down the </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole fucking city.</v>

3900
02:44:15.940 --> 02:44:20.560
<v Speaker 4>And in midtown you smelled burning </v>
<v Speaker 4>plastic and you smelled death.</v>

3901
02:44:20.590 --> 02:44:22.660
<v Speaker 4>There was no doubt in your fucking mind </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>

3902
02:44:22.810 --> 02:44:26.040
<v Speaker 4>that was dead people all the way in mid </v>
<v Speaker 4>town.</v>

3903
02:44:26.041 --> 02:44:28.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many miles officially </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is from ground zero,</v>

3904
02:44:28.511 --> 02:44:30.010
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's quite a hike.</v>

3905
02:44:30.610 --> 02:44:35.500
<v Speaker 4>And I also remember that some people </v>
<v Speaker 4>were just going about their day,</v>

3906
02:44:35.501 --> 02:44:39.040
<v Speaker 4>like nothing was different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember like studying people,</v>

3907
02:44:39.310 --> 02:44:44.310
<v Speaker 4>I remember looking at these two women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were going to happy hour and they </v>

3908
02:44:44.310 --> 02:44:44.440
<v Speaker 4>were just talking about their dme </v>
<v Speaker 4>office,</v>

3909
02:44:44.610 --> 02:44:45.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their day at the office.</v>

3910
02:44:45.851 --> 02:44:47.560
<v Speaker 4>And I'm sitting there thinking to </v>
<v Speaker 4>myself,</v>

3911
02:44:48.070 --> 02:44:53.070
<v Speaker 4>Holy Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you understand just what happened to </v>

3912
02:44:53.070 --> 02:44:53.070
<v Speaker 4>the city 24 hours ago?</v>

3913
02:44:53.070 --> 02:44:54.100
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never,</v>

3914
02:44:54.160 --> 02:44:55.540
<v Speaker 4>never forgot that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3915
02:44:55.541 --> 02:45:00.541
<v Speaker 4>it's weird how people can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird if some people can just kind </v>

3916
02:45:00.541 --> 02:45:02.260
<v Speaker 4>of shut off and disconnect to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because most of the people living in New</v>

3917
02:45:02.260 --> 02:45:02.890
<v Speaker 4>York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were all like,</v>

3918
02:45:02.891 --> 02:45:07.891
<v Speaker 4>holy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you did see these other people that </v>

3919
02:45:07.891 --> 02:45:10.840
<v Speaker 4>they basically their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their lives didn't change that day.</v>

3920
02:45:11.080 --> 02:45:14.500
<v Speaker 4>I noticed that when I went to work that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people were friendlier.</v>

3921
02:45:15.710 --> 02:45:18.250
<v Speaker 4>The people got a lot friendlier beyond </v>
<v Speaker 4>friendly.</v>

3922
02:45:18.251 --> 02:45:20.050
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden like you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>people in the eyes.</v>

3923
02:45:20.051 --> 02:45:22.420
<v Speaker 4>Like when you live in New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't look at anybody.</v>

3924
02:45:22.510 --> 02:45:24.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very lonely place.</v>

3925
02:45:24.670 --> 02:45:26.440
<v Speaker 4>There's so many people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not weird.</v>

3926
02:45:26.470 --> 02:45:29.230
<v Speaker 4>It's a lonely place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's no one looks at anyone.</v>

3927
02:45:29.620 --> 02:45:32.320
<v Speaker 4>No one strikes depending conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very rare,</v>

3928
02:45:32.650 --> 02:45:34.680
<v Speaker 4>but after nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone was talking to each other.</v>

3929
02:45:34.681 --> 02:45:37.720
<v Speaker 4>It's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird thing about New York or you</v>

3930
02:45:37.721 --> 02:45:42.721
<v Speaker 4>go to a big place and it's crowded with </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and no one's talking to anybody </v>

3931
02:45:42.721 --> 02:45:42.790
<v Speaker 4>and everybody's being themselves.</v>

3932
02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:44.950
<v Speaker 4>Unless they know they can get a buck </v>
<v Speaker 4>off,</v>

3933
02:45:44.951 --> 02:45:46.160
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very strange.</v>

3934
02:45:46.490 --> 02:45:48.430
<v Speaker 4>They know they can make money off and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then they're talking to you,</v>

3935
02:45:48.431 --> 02:45:51.430
<v Speaker 4>but in general you're not having that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that small talk.</v>

3936
02:45:51.431 --> 02:45:53.740
<v Speaker 4>Like I live in a building.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been there for years.</v>

3937
02:45:53.741 --> 02:45:56.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anyone in my building.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one talks to anyone.</v>

3938
02:45:56.501 --> 02:46:01.501
<v Speaker 4>I see the same people in the elevator </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I want to look at him like we know </v>

3939
02:46:01.501 --> 02:46:05.221
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about we talk a little bit and I've </v>

3940
02:46:05.221 --> 02:46:05.221
<v Speaker 4>tried,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think you're a creep.</v>

3941
02:46:05.221 --> 02:46:06.280
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it happens to everybody.</v>

3942
02:46:06.340 --> 02:46:07.750
<v Speaker 4>It'd be easy to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

3943
02:46:07.810 --> 02:46:09.980
<v Speaker 4>but then when you do have a with someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the</v>

3944
02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:11.900
<v Speaker 1>elevator of my building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know they're visiting.</v>

3945
02:46:12.210 --> 02:46:17.210
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt in your mind because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones that are having that </v>

3946
02:46:17.210 --> 02:46:19.670
<v Speaker 1>small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't think you're creep when </v>

3947
02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:19.670
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to start up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

3948
02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because I feel like God,</v>

3949
02:46:20.420 --> 02:46:25.420
<v Speaker 1>we've seen it so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm doing anything out of </v>

3950
02:46:25.420 --> 02:46:25.420
<v Speaker 1>the ordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never liked that about New York.</v>

3951
02:46:25.420 --> 02:46:27.260
<v Speaker 1>I always thought that was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate that,</v>

3952
02:46:27.310 --> 02:46:31.790
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of a behavior exists,</v>

3953
02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:36.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like real standoffish with each </v>

3954
02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:38.681
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I liked the </v>

3955
02:46:38.681 --> 02:46:40.841
<v Speaker 1>most about living a when I lived in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado was a few people there where </v>

3956
02:46:40.841 --> 02:46:41.900
<v Speaker 1>there's only a 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in Boulder.</v>

3957
02:46:42.020 --> 02:46:43.500
<v Speaker 1>People are very friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3958
02:46:43.520 --> 02:46:45.830
<v Speaker 1>because it's just less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less burnout.</v>

3959
02:46:45.890 --> 02:46:47.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3960
02:46:47.240 --> 02:46:48.800
<v Speaker 1>you're around people all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

3961
02:46:48.801 --> 02:46:50.270
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can get the fuck away from me,</v>

3962
02:46:50.570 --> 02:46:52.520
<v Speaker 1>but then if you see somebody that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't seen it forever,</v>

3963
02:46:52.521 --> 02:46:53.510
<v Speaker 1>you're so happy to see them.</v>

3964
02:46:53.550 --> 02:46:55.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like you to find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to strike a balance point.</v>

3965
02:46:56.040 --> 02:47:01.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the balance point is </v>
<v Speaker 1>stalking people up 70 funding stories </v>

3966
02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:02.060
<v Speaker 1>high and I kind of miss when I used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in western New York,</v>

3967
02:47:02.061 --> 02:47:06.210
<v Speaker 1>it was more of a small town mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you guys ever earlier,</v>

3968
02:47:06.420 --> 02:47:08.690
<v Speaker 1>have you ever thought about moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else?</v>

3969
02:47:08.720 --> 02:47:13.720
<v Speaker 1>You and Anthony ever thought about not </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in New York and just fucking </v>

3970
02:47:13.720 --> 02:47:13.820
<v Speaker 1>taking the show on the road somewhere?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh hell no,</v>

3971
02:47:14.020 --> 02:47:14.730
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3972
02:47:15.320 --> 02:47:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how many more years </v>

3973
02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:20.320
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna do?</v>

3974
02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:20.690
<v Speaker 1>If you don't do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just chill out for a awhile.</v>

3975
02:47:20.870 --> 02:47:23.500
<v Speaker 1>The Fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna die going to get old.</v>

3976
02:47:23.510 --> 02:47:28.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can hang out with him right back and </v>

3977
02:47:28.510 --> 02:47:28.510
<v Speaker 1>just chill out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know you guys should do it for real.</v>

3978
02:47:28.510 --> 02:47:28.820
<v Speaker 1>You should do.</v>

3979
02:47:28.820 --> 02:47:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to figure out what's next </v>

3980
02:47:33.820 --> 02:47:34.370
<v Speaker 1>for us to do exactly what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do it on the Internet because that's</v>

3981
02:47:34.371 --> 02:47:36.050
<v Speaker 1>what's going to be in everyone's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>stereo.</v>

3982
02:47:36.350 --> 02:47:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's car stereo is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected to the Internet.</v>

3983
02:47:38.690 --> 02:47:40.760
<v Speaker 1>We probably should have made the leap </v>
<v Speaker 1>this last contract,</v>

3984
02:47:40.761 --> 02:47:43.610
<v Speaker 1>but you can make the leap to years </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly,</v>

3985
02:47:43.850 --> 02:47:46.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just do it under assumed names</v>

3986
02:47:46.101 --> 02:47:47.290
<v Speaker 1>that everybody knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3987
02:47:47.300 --> 02:47:49.460
<v Speaker 1>he could come up with your own name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3988
02:47:49.660 --> 02:47:51.680
<v Speaker 1>fucking Douchey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3989
02:47:51.681 --> 02:47:52.600
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Call it.</v>

3990
02:47:52.820 --> 02:47:56.260
<v Speaker 1>I think a Dale Dudley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call themselves teabagging taint.</v>

3991
02:47:57.330 --> 02:47:59.900
<v Speaker 1>I think he's got some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a contract issue,</v>

3992
02:47:59.930 --> 02:48:04.930
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just do it and just start it up with </v>

3993
02:48:04.930 --> 02:48:05.510
<v Speaker 1>what could they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it for a long time.</v>

3994
02:48:05.780 --> 02:48:08.840
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's easy and it's fun.</v>

3995
02:48:08.841 --> 02:48:10.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm just looking for something new and </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

3996
02:48:10.520 --> 02:48:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

3997
02:48:11.300 --> 02:48:12.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4086
02:51:41.751 --> 02:51:41.751
<v Speaker 4>that part of your brain that tells you </v>

<v Speaker 4>you might be fine.</v>

4093
02:51:53.330 --> 02:51:55.560
<v Speaker 4>So what's up with the wing suits?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does.</v>

4094
02:51:55.561 --> 02:52:00.561
<v Speaker 4>Cause rather than mom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you see the one video where the guy </v>

4095
02:52:00.561 --> 02:52:02.721
<v Speaker 4>thinks holding up the balloons or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something and the wing suit guy comes </v>

4096
02:52:02.721 --> 02:52:03.570
<v Speaker 4>flying through and I think it's on Vimeo</v>
<v Speaker 4>or something.</v>

4097
02:52:03.660 --> 02:52:06.040
<v Speaker 4>He's holding up a balloon tweeted the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other day.</v>

4098
02:52:06.041 --> 02:52:11.041
<v Speaker 4>It was just amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He jumped off the top of a fucking </v>

4099
02:52:11.041 --> 02:52:12.340
<v Speaker 4>mountain and now he's flying through the</v>
<v Speaker 4>valley and,</v>

4100
02:52:12.400 --> 02:52:13.810
<v Speaker 4>and he's coming towards buddy.</v>

4101
02:52:13.810 --> 02:52:18.810
<v Speaker 4>And the buddy I think holds up balloons </v>
<v Speaker 4>or something literally right over his </v>

4102
02:52:18.810 --> 02:52:20.920
<v Speaker 4>head and he comes flying at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could barely see.</v>

4103
02:52:20.921 --> 02:52:22.840
<v Speaker 4>It's just like a flash.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4104
02:52:22.841 --> 02:52:25.210
<v Speaker 4>they're going really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go like 100 miles an hour.</v>

4105
02:52:25.810 --> 02:52:27.820
<v Speaker 4>That is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're so silly.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's got to be ridiculous.</v>

4110
02:52:43.200 --> 02:52:44.170
<v Speaker 4>hand strength and their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their ability to do chin ups.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I heard him talking about.</v>

4114
02:52:50.651 --> 02:52:53.050

<v Speaker 4>one finger,</v>

4117
02:52:59.040 --> 02:53:00.160

<v Speaker 4>Have you seen it?</v>

4118
02:53:00.190 --> 02:53:01.120
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I believe it.</v>

4119
02:53:01.390 --> 02:53:02.730
<v Speaker 4>You believe it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4122
02:53:06.461 --> 02:53:09.340
<v Speaker 4>you start out with your full hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you work your way to four fingers,</v>

4123
02:53:09.341 --> 02:53:11.320
<v Speaker 4>three fingers to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the more you keep doing it,</v>

4124
02:53:11.321 --> 02:53:12.400
<v Speaker 4>you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

4125
02:53:12.500 --> 02:53:15.340
<v Speaker 4>The guys can do chin ups,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pushups rather with one finger.</v>

4126
02:53:15.460 --> 02:53:18.760
<v Speaker 4>I've seen that one finger on each side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guys do pushups,</v>

4127
02:53:19.240 --> 02:53:20.500
<v Speaker 4>full pushups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

4128
02:53:20.540 --> 02:53:22.460

<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4129
02:53:22.470 --> 02:53:27.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4130
02:53:27.470 --> 02:53:27.470
<v Speaker 4>hands and your tendons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the difference between someone</v>

4131
02:53:27.470 --> 02:53:32.071
<v Speaker 4>who's really strong and someone who's </v>

02:53:38.870 --> 02:53:43.060
<v Speaker 4>Having fun because he slipped and caught</v>
<v Speaker 4>himself and was okay with the difference</v>

4136

<v Speaker 4>between someone really strong and </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's not really strong besides </v>

4137
02:53:48.061 --> 02:53:48.061
<v Speaker 4>genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that someone is really strong,</v>

4138
02:53:48.070 --> 02:53:53.070
<v Speaker 4>forced their body to get strong by </v>
<v Speaker 4>making it lift weights a lot and keep </v>

<v Speaker 4>Carry yourself around that,</v>

4158
02:54:47.980 --> 02:54:50.920
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird way to get you thrills,</v>

4159
02:54:51.130 --> 02:54:51.970
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

4160
02:54:52.150 --> 02:54:57.150
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird way to just get your </v>
<v Speaker 4>jollies out of climbing the top of </v>

4161
02:54:57.150 --> 02:54:58.750
<v Speaker 4>something that can fucking kill you at </v>
<v Speaker 4>sleeping on the side.</v>

4162
02:55:01.810 --> 02:55:04.070
<v Speaker 4>Don't go to the top of the Chrysler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to wrap this</v>

4163
02:55:04.070 --> 02:55:04.910
<v Speaker 1>bitch up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

4164
02:55:04.911 --> 02:55:05.690
<v Speaker 1>This was fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4165
02:55:05.691 --> 02:55:09.440
<v Speaker 1>You got me out of my comfort zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy you came down to this.</v>

4166
02:55:09.441 --> 02:55:12.410
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This podcast owes you a lot man,</v>

4167
02:55:12.560 --> 02:55:15.380
<v Speaker 1>not just for naming death squad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a ridiculous name,</v>

4168
02:55:15.381 --> 02:55:17.420
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that deserves a twitter plug,</v>

4169
02:55:17.650 --> 02:55:19.640
<v Speaker 1>but anyone but not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just data,</v>

4170
02:55:19.670 --> 02:55:24.670
<v Speaker 1>but that's for Stan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for creating a radio show that allowed </v>

4171
02:55:25.311 --> 02:55:30.311
<v Speaker 1>us to realize that there's a show in </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] talking because there's a </v>

4172
02:55:30.311 --> 02:55:31.340
<v Speaker 1>show and just hanging and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4173
02:55:31.341 --> 02:55:35.270
<v Speaker 1>you guys make it so comfortable for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for comics to come in and fuck around.</v>

4174
02:55:35.330 --> 02:55:40.330
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of podcasts really </v>

4175
02:55:40.330 --> 02:55:40.330
<v Speaker 1>followed that lead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of,</v>

4176
02:55:40.330 --> 02:55:42.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to play that game usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I kind of get that feeling.</v>

4177
02:55:42.970 --> 02:55:46.400
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the podcasts are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much like one.</v>

4178
02:55:46.430 --> 02:55:51.430
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are the most unstructured of </v>

4179
02:55:51.430 --> 02:55:54.821
<v Speaker 1>all the major radio show told you that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're lazy and it just worked </v>

4180
02:55:54.821 --> 02:55:54.821
<v Speaker 1>out because it works.</v>

4181
02:55:54.821 --> 02:55:56.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the right way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're lucky to the lazy way's the right</v>

4182
02:55:56.631 --> 02:55:57.370
<v Speaker 1>way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We actually,</v>

4183
02:55:58.190 --> 02:56:00.210
<v Speaker 1>we used to like prepare for our show and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

4184
02:56:00.340 --> 02:56:01.330
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like,</v>

4185
02:56:01.760 --> 02:56:06.140
<v Speaker 1>that was some of our worst shows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we did try to have structure for</v>

4186
02:56:06.141 --> 02:56:11.141
<v Speaker 1>awhile there and there's some days where</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we don't even know what the fuck </v>

4187
02:56:11.141 --> 02:56:11.220
<v Speaker 1>we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the end of the show we,</v>

4188
02:56:11.460 --> 02:56:12.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a good one.</v>

4189
02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:16.460
<v Speaker 1>You guys have an awesome group between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Norton who's in my opinion,</v>

4190
02:56:16.461 --> 02:56:19.070
<v Speaker 1>the funniest fucking guy was ever been </v>
<v Speaker 1>on radio ever.</v>

4191
02:56:19.280 --> 02:56:24.280
<v Speaker 1>He makes me how all that kind of regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis listen to that show just because </v>

4192
02:56:24.280 --> 02:56:28.391
<v Speaker 1>he's so perverted and twisted in these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carved out his own little fucking slice </v>

4193
02:56:28.391 --> 02:56:29.120
<v Speaker 1>of the world with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4194
02:56:29.121 --> 02:56:30.950
<v Speaker 1>his way and you know his way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

4195
02:56:30.951 --> 02:56:35.951
<v Speaker 1>so it's extra hilarious when he says </v>
<v Speaker 1>something crops up and then Anthony's </v>

4196
02:56:35.951 --> 02:56:39.401
<v Speaker 1>fucking bananas and you're crazy and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>three guys together know each other so </v>

4197

<v Speaker 1>well and then you bring in comics.</v>

4198
02:56:39.650 --> 02:56:40.990

<v Speaker 1>It's been a good run,</v>

<v Speaker 1>acknowledge us.</v>
