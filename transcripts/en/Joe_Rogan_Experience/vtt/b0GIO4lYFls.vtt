00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.010
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

4
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred mile man or a hundred man,</v>

5
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.160
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 100 mile man.</v>

6
00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:14.250
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ran a hundred mile race so years ago</v>

7
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>and then say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the fucking man,</v>

8
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.880
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me grab it if it's available.</v>

9
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 1>That's cool that you got it man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's a very popular thing now.</v>

10
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you run this before or after you did</v>

11
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:27.900
<v Speaker 1>the book with David Goggins?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ran it before.</v>

12
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.741
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

13
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's time when I did it.</v>

14
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:33.980
<v Speaker 1>They were like 400 Americans is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they ran a hundred miles or something.</v>

15
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why it was available.</v>

16
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it crazy how many people do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>

17
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I was trying to figure out in my</v>

18
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:44.210
<v Speaker 1>head how many do it a year and like how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many races?</v>

19
00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:47.640
<v Speaker 1>A hundred mile races there are there a</v>
<v Speaker 1>month and then multiply it out.</v>

20
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.050
<v Speaker 1>So probably five or 6,000 I'm guessing</v>
<v Speaker 1>five or 6,000 people who've done it?</v>

21
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>I think probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

22
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans.</v>

23
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a long way.</v>

24
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>It's a long fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just about talking right before</v>

25
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:05.580
<v Speaker 1>the podcast about how Miss America</v>
<v Speaker 1>yanked off,</v>

26
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all theirs.</v>

27
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>They're no longer judge by their beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I post this because I thought it was</v>

28
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>silly and there's just these fights</v>
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>

29
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fucking fights in the comments and</v>

30
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>fights and people are tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>People need to go out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>run those hundred miles.</v>

32
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:25.530
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they loosen up fast,</v>

33
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.440
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

34
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going to miss?</v>
<v Speaker 1>America is scrapping the swimsuit</v>

35
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>competition would no longer be judged on</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical appearance.</v>

36
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.870
<v Speaker 1>It's literally a beauty contest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what it is.</v>

37
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 1>What are they replacing it with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

38
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:43.200
<v Speaker 1>I got to think it's like when playboy</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to not have people nude,</v>

39
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

40
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.140
<v Speaker 1>That like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing,</v>

41
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:49.410
<v Speaker 1>but no longer judging them on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical appearance.</v>

42
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.550
<v Speaker 1>But what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

43
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a two way.</v>

44
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>No longer a pageant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gretchen Carlson says</v>

45
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 1>we're competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

46
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>I give up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

47
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 1>I think that might have bee a bee of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt the ratings a little bit.</v>

48
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I think a little bit or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe people will get very excited about</v>

49
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:15.840
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a little ramp up.</v>

50
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's getting a lot of talk.</v>

51
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe people will be pissed off and so</v>

52
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>they'll tune in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

53
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you stand on it?</v>

54
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so stupid.</v>

55
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Miss America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

56
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:27.690
<v Speaker 1>this is what's really fascinating to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

57
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a read in the comments.</v>

58
00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>A lot of feminists were angry at me that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was Maki and I saw a few of them.</v>

59
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

60
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:41.481
<v Speaker 1>why would you even want a who I'd most</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to fuck contest because that's what</v>

61
00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

62
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't these gals parade around or</v>

63
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>bikini.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a beauty contest.</v>

64
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Do we have a Mister America contest?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is that just the president?</v>

65
00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Is that what the Mr American context is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

67
00:02:55.831 --> 00:02:56.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

68
00:02:56.221 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to ask you as someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply connected to competition</v>

69
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 2>and mindsets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

70
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not following it that closely,</v>

71
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 2>but I am going to miss that part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>competition even though really I just,</v>

72
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 2>there's so many opportunities to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>people naked today.</v>

73
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:13.361
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

74
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a kid watching the met Miss America</v>

75
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 2>pageant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

76
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't allowed to options back</v>

77
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

78
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kids today are broken sports illustrated</v>

79
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 2>and dust pageant swimsuit issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if they're gonna continue to</v>

80
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.460
<v Speaker 2>swimsuit issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

81
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

82
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

83
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just see their faces and just have to</v>

84
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 2>assume they're in this swimsuit and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

85
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 2>there'll be like a bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thought bubble and it will be filled</v>

86
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 2>with an amazing quote that they say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be the new swimsuit issue.</v>

87
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 2>Cause we're just judging them on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>minds.</v>

88
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the content.</v>

89
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The content,</v>

90
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.043
<v Speaker 2>the content.</v>

91
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Speaking to content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living with monks.</v>

92
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it called?</v>

93
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 2>Living with the monks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Living with the monks.</v>

94
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does your new book?</v>

95
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did you start to do that and how</v>

96
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 2>long did you do it for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it for 15 days.</v>

97
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 2>I was enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's more than enough,</v>

98
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:07.600
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

99
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.840
<v Speaker 2>We're going to go like this for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your finger all fall off dealing with</v>

100
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:13.660
<v Speaker 2>your finger up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a repetition.</v>

101
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 2>What did you have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I uh,</v>

102
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.160
<v Speaker 2>well I live with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>

103
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 2>there were eight monks for which had</v>
<v Speaker 2>been there for 50 years,</v>

104
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 2>50 50 on a monastery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>800,</v>

105
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.800
<v Speaker 2>800,</v>
<v Speaker 2>500 acres kind of in the middle of</v>

106
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:28.800
<v Speaker 2>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

107
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.480
<v Speaker 2>I went for 15 days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I figured,</v>

108
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

109
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.130
<v Speaker 2>I'd invested so much of my life on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical side and ran a hundred miles</v>

110
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:41.131
<v Speaker 2>and just always active and this and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have really invested very little on</v>

111
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.430
<v Speaker 2>my own inner work.</v>

112
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.200
<v Speaker 2>And I just felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

113
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.370
<v Speaker 2>I just felt overwhelmed a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said to my wife,</v>

114
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are the masters and everything</v>

115
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:53.890
<v Speaker 2>pointed to monks and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go live on a monastery.</v>

116
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.600
<v Speaker 2>There's something romantic about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

117
00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like the guy who goes off</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the woods to write a book.</v>

118
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.670
<v Speaker 2>I like being with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a monk like and just being,</v>

119
00:05:02.671 --> 00:05:04.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a monastery with monks.</v>

120
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 2>There's something very romantic about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

121
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.331
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it,</v>

122
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:12.331
<v Speaker 2>you've shared all your worldly</v>
<v Speaker 2>belongings and you no longer care about</v>

123
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 2>the day to day nonsense that everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 2>fixated on.</v>

124
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.560
<v Speaker 2>Just decide to just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

125
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.570
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

126
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.380
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

127
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.300
<v Speaker 2>all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do it.</v>

128
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

129
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.050
<v Speaker 2>You should want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've lived the opposite of amongst life.</v>

130
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 2>My life is filled with bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

131
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where'd you go?</v>

132
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.880
<v Speaker 2>So I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to a monastery just south of</v>

133
00:05:40.881 --> 00:05:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Canada in the states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

134
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.760
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

135
00:05:43.761 --> 00:05:46.010
<v Speaker 2>what state is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was in upstate New York.</v>

136
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

137
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like on the Vermont border and it was</v>

138
00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:49.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

139
00:05:49.911 --> 00:05:52.880
<v Speaker 2>no phone total kind of separation from</v>
<v Speaker 2>my family.</v>

140
00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:54.200
<v Speaker 2>I have four kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife,</v>

141
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.890
<v Speaker 2>and just got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

142
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.520
<v Speaker 2>get to know myself little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

143
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 2>Now when you were up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was there any time where you're like,</v>

144
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one minute into it.</v>

145
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 2>I got when I first got up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main monk,</v>

146
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 2>like my goto monk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brother,</v>

147
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.020
<v Speaker 2>brother Christopher took me to my room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call the rooms a cell,</v>

148
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 2>which is about the size of this table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had a bed.</v>

149
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 2>I walked in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a bed,</v>

150
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.080
<v Speaker 2>there was a little desk with a night</v>
<v Speaker 2>lamp on it and nothing on the walls.</v>

151
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.410
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow we're going to start prayer,</v>

152
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.530
<v Speaker 2>reflection and meditation at 7:15 AM and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked at my watch and it was 6:00 PM</v>

153
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 2>and I asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

154
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:40.331
<v Speaker 2>what do we do between now and 7:15 AM?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he looked at me dead in the eye and</v>

155
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:42.650
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think?</v>

156
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.400
<v Speaker 2>And I said to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucked.</v>

157
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.960
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really like spend a lot of time</v>

158
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.510
<v Speaker 2>in thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went and I said,</v>

159
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:57.080
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>

160
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to meditate.</v>

161
00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm here.</v>

162
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.250
<v Speaker 2>Let me start this journey with</v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation.</v>

163
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:04.190
<v Speaker 2>I'd taken a little a course in</v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendental meditation.</v>

164
00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:07.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a big meditation guy other than</v>
<v Speaker 2>running.</v>

165
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.550
<v Speaker 2>And so I set my timer for 20 minutes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sat down in my chair and I started</v>

166
00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:17.240
<v Speaker 2>like focusing on my mantra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like immediately I'm bombarded with how</v>

167
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:18.860
<v Speaker 2>is my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the kids,</v>

168
00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:19.920
<v Speaker 2>the hawks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this,</v>

169
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Atlanta Hawks.</v>

170
00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:23.360
<v Speaker 2>I look at the ladder like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

171
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.650
<v Speaker 2>and not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of hawk,</v>

172
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.350
<v Speaker 2>everything's coming at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

173
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>time is going by and I'm just getting</v>

174
00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:33.680
<v Speaker 2>bombarded with thought and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why isn't my timer buzz like it's been,</v>

175
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:36.620
<v Speaker 2>I've been here forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was going to look and reset my</v>

176
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:37.910
<v Speaker 2>thing and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be cheating.</v>

177
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:40.220
<v Speaker 2>Let me keep going and going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all the time's going by.</v>

178
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.770
<v Speaker 2>And finally I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck is going on with my time or you</v>

179
00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:45.050
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I opened my eyes and I looked to</v>

180
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.900
<v Speaker 2>reset my timer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's three minutes and 27 seconds.</v>

181
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.760
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said to my,</v>

182
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:53.210
<v Speaker 2>I like really thought it was 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was like hours,</v>

183
00:07:53.211 --> 00:07:56.000
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like I'd never really sat in a</v>

184
00:07:56.001 --> 00:08:01.001
<v Speaker 2>room like with nothing going on and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>closed my eyes alone and thought and</v>

185
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:05.090
<v Speaker 2>time to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I calculated how much time I have</v>

186
00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:06.740
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 15 days times,</v>

187
00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:08.120
<v Speaker 2>24 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 60 minutes.</v>

188
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:09.860
<v Speaker 2>And I said to myself like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

189
00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:12.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't like,</v>

190
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.500
<v Speaker 2>like this isn't what I'm on Gilligan's</v>
<v Speaker 2>island.</v>

191
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.540
<v Speaker 2>This is a real like I can't get out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

192
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.940
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a really hard time with it.</v>

193
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 2>What was the commitment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The commitment was 15 days.</v>

194
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.530
<v Speaker 2>So the only you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a personal feeling.</v>

195
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.890
<v Speaker 2>Did it up to you like there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing in writing.</v>

196
00:08:30.891 --> 00:08:35.870
<v Speaker 2>And did you have a way to escape?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was thinking of escape plans,</v>

197
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.960
<v Speaker 2>but I'm on the monastery and this is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little crazy that the way the monks keep</v>

198
00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:44.450
<v Speaker 2>the lights on is they breed German</v>
<v Speaker 2>shepherds.</v>

199
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.790
<v Speaker 2>That's how they make money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They breed German shepherds are,</v>

200
00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:49.070
<v Speaker 2>the largest I've seen is they wrote a</v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

201
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.840
<v Speaker 2>they wrote a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the book.</v>

202
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.880
<v Speaker 2>It's a book about raising puppies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

203
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:54.290
<v Speaker 2>The same guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same guys.</v>

204
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they weren't Buddhist.</v>

205
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.670
<v Speaker 2>They were Russian Orthodox and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>raise German shepherds.</v>

206
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.300
<v Speaker 2>So they live on this property and there</v>
<v Speaker 2>are these 11 German shepherds,</v>

207
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.680
<v Speaker 2>and at the end of the property,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only way off the property where two</v>

208
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:10.920
<v Speaker 2>mobile homes unconnected to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>monastery at the end of this road that</v>

209
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:12.060
<v Speaker 2>leads up to the monastery.</v>

210
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.220
<v Speaker 2>And both of those homes had German</v>
<v Speaker 2>shepherds as well that were a little</v>

211
00:09:17.221 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Speaker 2>territorial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there really was no way for me to</v>

212
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:21.900
<v Speaker 2>escape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I couldn't,</v>

213
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:27.330
<v Speaker 2>I ran 120 miles up and down the driveway</v>
<v Speaker 2>while I was there because I couldn't</v>

214
00:09:27.331 --> 00:09:32.250
<v Speaker 2>leave the property.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just timed herself or paced</v>

215
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Speaker 2>yourself using an APP or something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said like 2000 steps equals a mile.</v>

216
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.220
<v Speaker 2>Counted your steps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

217
00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:39.600
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

218
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I counted it and marked it to,</v>

219
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.520
<v Speaker 2>what did they think about you running</v>
<v Speaker 2>around back and forth like that?</v>

220
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.700
<v Speaker 2>Thought it was a fucking psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

221
00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:49.740
<v Speaker 2>you guys have been here for 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

222

<v Speaker 2>They speak English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the conversation like?</v>

235
00:10:25.551 --> 00:10:26.301
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

236
00:10:26.301 --> 00:10:29.370
<v Speaker 2>what do you say to a guy who's been in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>monastery for 50 years?</v>

237
00:10:29.371 --> 00:10:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Just staring at the walls while I</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted,</v>

238
00:10:31.171 --> 00:10:32.850
<v Speaker 2>if I could have talked to him about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pageant,</v>

239
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.430
<v Speaker 2>that would have been just a conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>he brought,</v>

240
00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:36.530
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super confused.</v>

241
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I first got up there and they would</v>

242
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.030
<v Speaker 2>ask me a little bit about my background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told them,</v>

243
00:10:42.031 --> 00:10:43.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's in the private jet business?</v>

244
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.110
<v Speaker 2>They didn't understand private jets</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

245
00:10:46.111 --> 00:10:48.180
<v Speaker 2>And then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a coconut water company.</v>

246
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.500
<v Speaker 2>They never heard of coconut water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told them I was involved with the</v>

247
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.300
<v Speaker 2>Atlanta Hawks and one of the monk said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

248
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.840
<v Speaker 2>I've been to a an expos game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

249
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.150
<v Speaker 2>that's a different sport and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>play,</v>

250
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:04.830
<v Speaker 2>they don't exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is very like timewarp at first.</v>

251
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.710
<v Speaker 2>It was really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting.</v>

252
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.140
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what led these,</v>

253
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.080
<v Speaker 2>these guys that are 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 years on the Montessori,</v>

254
00:11:13.081 --> 00:11:15.060
<v Speaker 2>how old were they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

255
00:11:15.061 --> 00:11:18.360
<v Speaker 2>so some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the age range from,</v>

256
00:11:18.361 --> 00:11:23.250
<v Speaker 2>I think the youngest monk was probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>35 up until late seventies.</v>

257
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.830
<v Speaker 2>So late seventies with the guys that had</v>
<v Speaker 2>been there for 50 years.</v>

258
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.660
<v Speaker 2>They checked in when they were 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

259
00:11:28.661 --> 00:11:30.750
<v Speaker 2>in their young twenties in the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>spot.</v>

260
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.420
<v Speaker 2>They actually built this monastery by</v>
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>

261
00:11:33.421 --> 00:11:36.750
<v Speaker 2>They bought 500 acres for very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

262
00:11:36.751 --> 00:11:39.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like $50,000 or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

263
00:11:39.061 --> 00:11:39.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something crazy.</v>

264
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.690
<v Speaker 2>And then they built the monastery by</v>
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>

265
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:48.320
<v Speaker 2>And so it's been a passion of love and</v>
<v Speaker 2>labor and they've been there since.</v>

266
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 2>And so the vow of celibacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole deal and poverty,</v>

267
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Speaker 2>poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insolvency at 20.</v>

268
00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

269
00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:02.350
<v Speaker 2>they take a vow for things of um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>celibacy.</v>

270
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.390
<v Speaker 2>Poverty's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pledge all their personal</v>

271
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:07.600
<v Speaker 2>belongings to the monastery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So really they're only possession is a</v>

272
00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.900
<v Speaker 2>driver's license.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obedience and stability.</v>

273
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.600
<v Speaker 2>Meaning we're not leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what we're going to do.</v>

274
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.070
<v Speaker 2>So I mean talk about discipline just off</v>
<v Speaker 2>the charts to do forever.</v>

275
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.170
<v Speaker 2>Forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And where do they get funding?</v>

276
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.550
<v Speaker 2>They're self sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they stay breeds German shepherds,</v>

277
00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:26.890
<v Speaker 2>they sell them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of one income stream.</v>

278
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:31.690
<v Speaker 2>And then their master's world masters of</v>
<v Speaker 2>dog training training.</v>

279
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:36.430
<v Speaker 2>So every two weeks they have 10 dogs</v>
<v Speaker 2>that come in and they,</v>

280
00:12:36.431 --> 00:12:40.150
<v Speaker 2>and I've watched this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they literally dogs come in like</v>

281
00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:42.160
<v Speaker 2>spuds Mackenzie and leave.</v>

282
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:47.160
<v Speaker 2>Like they just left etiquette school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was like anytime you're in the</v>

283
00:12:47.531 --> 00:12:51.250
<v Speaker 2>presence of the people that are the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world,</v>

284
00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:53.800
<v Speaker 2>that what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking fascinating.</v>

285
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.220
<v Speaker 2>And these guys were masters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are the masters of,</v>

286
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are great but in their space of dog</v>

287
00:13:03.341 --> 00:13:06.370
<v Speaker 2>training and breeding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was so special about the way they</v>

288
00:13:06.371 --> 00:13:08.590
<v Speaker 2>trained dogs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the command,</v>

289
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:11.380
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they had an energy that the dogs</v>

290
00:13:11.381 --> 00:13:13.630
<v Speaker 2>responded to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like I would walk in and the dogs</v>

291
00:13:13.631 --> 00:13:15.730
<v Speaker 2>would go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd sniff my nuts.</v>

292
00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:17.290
<v Speaker 2>They just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go nuts,</v>

293
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys would walk in and like they</v>

294
00:13:19.241 --> 00:13:21.490
<v Speaker 2>could just sense that they were in</v>
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>

295
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:25.330
<v Speaker 2>they were in control and like the eye</v>
<v Speaker 2>contact that they,</v>

296
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.340
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that they talk,</v>

297
00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:29.950
<v Speaker 2>their tone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their hand mannerisms,</v>

298
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:35.170
<v Speaker 2>they just have mastered this and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a deep connection with the dogs.</v>

299
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Dogs are weird in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have a one year old golden</v>

300
00:13:38.621 --> 00:13:42.940
<v Speaker 1>retriever and he has different rules for</v>
<v Speaker 1>different people and he knows who he can</v>

301
00:13:42.941 --> 00:13:45.380
<v Speaker 1>get away with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What with uh,</v>

302
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:49.120
<v Speaker 1>my wife's mom has zero shot at</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling this dog.</v>

303
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.100
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

304
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.101
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm the boss.</v>

307
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.430

<v Speaker 1>kiss.</v>

310
00:13:56.951 --> 00:13:59.320
<v Speaker 1>pause on you when you sit in a chair and</v>

<v Speaker 2>get him to break his goal of going.</v>

350
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:39.080
<v Speaker 2>They were kind of simulating a park</v>
<v Speaker 2>scene or a city scene and making this</v>

351
00:15:39.081 --> 00:15:43.160
<v Speaker 2>dog not get distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would go nuts with the pork chop</v>

352
00:15:43.161 --> 00:15:44.480
<v Speaker 2>and this and throw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

353
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.870
<v Speaker 2>The dog would just go unwavering from</v>
<v Speaker 2>point a to point b.</v>

354
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.300
<v Speaker 2>And the monk said to me at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

355
00:15:50.301 --> 00:15:51.950
<v Speaker 2>it's just like life man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

356
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:52.520
<v Speaker 2>if you have a</v>

357
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.353
<v Speaker 4>goal,</v>

358
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.680
<v Speaker 2>just like rainbows goal is to get from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>to B,</v>

359
00:15:56.681 --> 00:15:59.080
<v Speaker 2>you can't be distracted in your goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

360
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.060
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some karate kid stuff,</v>

361
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.160
<v Speaker 2>like I'm like mock song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

362
00:16:03.161 --> 00:16:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Like wax on and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all these different lessons started</v>

363
00:16:07.721 --> 00:16:09.730
<v Speaker 2>to emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty interesting.</v>

364
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

365
00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:12.671
<v Speaker 1>that isn't just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

366
00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:16.160
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting too that they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it with German shepherds are really,</v>

367
00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:18.280
<v Speaker 1>really smart dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want like,</v>

368
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:21.380
<v Speaker 1>what's a dumb dog?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

369
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.350
<v Speaker 1>what's like a generally thought of</v>
<v Speaker 1>downward dog?</v>

370
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Let's think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to think like what would</v>

371
00:16:30.241 --> 00:16:33.450
<v Speaker 1>generally be thought of as a dumb dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no like,</v>

372
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:34.890
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

373
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.410
<v Speaker 1>prejudices for dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

374
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>

375
00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:41.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one breed or like this dumb fucking</v>

376
00:16:41.521 --> 00:16:44.880
<v Speaker 1>breed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think of like when you say like</v>

377
00:16:44.881 --> 00:16:47.400
<v Speaker 1>a dumb dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dumb individual dogs,</v>

378
00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.320
<v Speaker 1>but I don't ever think of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

379
00:16:49.321 --> 00:16:52.530
<v Speaker 1>that there's some dogs that are like</v>
<v Speaker 1>spastic,</v>

380
00:16:52.531 --> 00:16:54.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Jack Russell terriers are kind of</v>

381
00:16:54.571 --> 00:16:56.700
<v Speaker 1>spastic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's because they were raised to</v>

382
00:16:56.701 --> 00:17:00.180
<v Speaker 1>kill rats and they just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have high kill drive and they're</v>

383
00:17:00.181 --> 00:17:02.220
<v Speaker 1>super hyper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

384
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.730
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of a dog that's supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be stupid,</v>

385
00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.320
<v Speaker 1>but German shepherds are generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be smart with English</v>

386
00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:12.330
<v Speaker 1>bulldogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if that's really true.</v>

387
00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:13.750
<v Speaker 1>I think they're just lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

388
00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:17.070
<v Speaker 1>My dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutus is half English bulldog and half</v>

389
00:17:17.071 --> 00:17:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Sheebu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He know he just has bad joints and he's</v>

390
00:17:19.651 --> 00:17:21.300
<v Speaker 1>just lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>

391
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

392
00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.370
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said Dick to other dogs,</v>

393
00:17:26.371 --> 00:17:28.500
<v Speaker 1>but I just think that's because he's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain a lot.</v>

394
00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.470
<v Speaker 1>These dogs were super smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so smart,</v>

395
00:17:31.471 --> 00:17:33.770
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those dogs look at you and they're</v>

396
00:17:33.771 --> 00:17:35.070
<v Speaker 1>little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're sizing you up,</v>

397
00:17:35.071 --> 00:17:37.020
<v Speaker 1>checking you out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what the fuck you're up to.</v>

398
00:17:37.021 --> 00:17:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Make sure you're cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's like this feeling like they</v>

399
00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.650
<v Speaker 1>know they could kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're looking at you like,</v>

400
00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.420
<v Speaker 1>I could kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just checking you out.</v>

401
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.480
<v Speaker 2>I had that feeling that they could kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>me too.</v>

402
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real feeling.</v>

403
00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

404
00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:51.810
<v Speaker 2>they can and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was scared.</v>

405
00:17:51.811 --> 00:17:55.130
<v Speaker 2>They were sensing that he's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like down.</v>

406
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:56.670
<v Speaker 2>Downplay my fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

407
00:17:56.671 --> 00:17:59.820
<v Speaker 2>My friend who trains them has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dog that's like,</v>

408
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:04.910
<v Speaker 2>he does police work and it's like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>serious fucking dog and he'll attack</v>

409
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.490
<v Speaker 2>like a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're holding like a stick,</v>

410
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.940
<v Speaker 2>like on command and he jumps and one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things he does,</v>

411
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.750
<v Speaker 2>he bites the stick and then to pause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go right into your nuts.</v>

412
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.660
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think it's on purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but damn,</v>

413
00:18:18.661 --> 00:18:22.380
<v Speaker 2>it's an effective strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like bite and then nuts stomp</v>

414
00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:23.970
<v Speaker 2>all in one maneuver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

415
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But those dogs are,</v>

416
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're uh,</v>

417
00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:32.100
<v Speaker 2>they're a dog that's sort of bread and</v>
<v Speaker 2>designed for protection work and police</v>

418
00:18:32.101 --> 00:18:32.760
<v Speaker 2>work and stuff.</v>

419
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

420
00:18:34.261 --> 00:18:37.830
<v Speaker 2>And they train their dogs as pets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they didn't do any kind of,</v>

421
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>police work or anything like that.</v>

422
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:44.040
<v Speaker 2>So that the 11 German shepherds that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were on the property was super well</v>

423
00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:44.611
<v Speaker 2>behaved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

424
00:18:44.611 --> 00:18:47.910
<v Speaker 2>like ridiculously well behaved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when they train them or they're just</v>

425
00:18:47.911 --> 00:18:50.010
<v Speaker 2>training them to make sure that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>obedient,</v>

426
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just listen,</v>

427
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:53.670
<v Speaker 2>watch the house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bark at strangers,</v>

428
00:18:53.671 --> 00:18:54.540
<v Speaker 2>that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

429
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.720
<v Speaker 2>Hand signals obedient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

430
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.590
<v Speaker 2>not jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really that,</v>

431
00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know who's in control.</v>

432
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:05.310
<v Speaker 2>So did these guys do that before they</v>
<v Speaker 2>started running the monastery or was it</v>

433
00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:08.250
<v Speaker 2>something that they decided to do while</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had the monastery?</v>

434
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:09.001
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

435
00:19:09.001 --> 00:19:10.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fell into it.</v>

436
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:11.570
<v Speaker 2>They didn't go up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

437
00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.860
<v Speaker 2>none of them had any experience in dog</v>
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>

438
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:15.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't the intent.</v>

439
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:17.910
<v Speaker 2>They just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to keep the lights on here.</v>

440
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:22.860
<v Speaker 2>And they had a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had a dog as a pet and fell in love</v>

441
00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:25.470
<v Speaker 2>with a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And ultimately they,</v>

442
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.390
<v Speaker 2>when the dog passed away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all got killed.</v>

443
00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.090
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted another dog and they went to</v>

444
00:19:30.091 --> 00:19:34.290
<v Speaker 2>a breeder and they got two dogs and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually just,</v>

445
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.840
<v Speaker 2>they realize that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

446
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
<v Speaker 2>once they bred an amazing puppy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived their first litter that and</v>

447
00:19:41.581 --> 00:19:44.910
<v Speaker 2>train these dogs that there was demand</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just scaled it like any other</v>

448
00:19:44.911 --> 00:19:46.170
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

449
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.780
<v Speaker 2>and they learned along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trial and error,</v>

450
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.460
<v Speaker 2>just like any entrepreneur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

451
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.350
<v Speaker 2>these guys will like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

452
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.810
<v Speaker 2>they were monks in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're super spiritual.</v>

453
00:19:54.811 --> 00:19:56.610
<v Speaker 2>They're religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were Russian Orthodox,</v>

454
00:19:56.611 --> 00:19:59.580
<v Speaker 2>they weren't in Buddhist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

455
00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:04.910
<v Speaker 2>but they're amazing entrepreneurs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like they ran this thing super</v>

456
00:20:04.951 --> 00:20:08.610
<v Speaker 2>efficiently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point would only be to make</v>

457
00:20:08.611 --> 00:20:10.110
<v Speaker 2>enough money to keep the lights on.</v>

458
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:11.910
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as an entrepreneur,</v>

459
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.090
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

460
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.640
<v Speaker 2>they're limited in their ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think excess,</v>

461
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:18.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like they're,</v>

462
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:23.520
<v Speaker 2>if they have excess money and revenue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to material things,</v>

463
00:20:23.521 --> 00:20:25.560
<v Speaker 2>but it's for the life and the extension</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them,</v>

464
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.040
<v Speaker 2>of the monitors monastery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would save it and put it away for</v>

465
00:20:29.041 --> 00:20:30.390
<v Speaker 2>taxes or what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

466
00:20:30.391 --> 00:20:31.230
<v Speaker 2>Or they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

467
00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.490
<v Speaker 2>they're in the hands of God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

468
00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.610
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a lot of litters or they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have a lot of puppies or they have</v>

469
00:20:35.611 --> 00:20:36.570
<v Speaker 2>no income.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

470
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.340
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>

471
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.670
<v Speaker 2>Now these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they do for recreation?</v>

472
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pray Jesus,</v>

473
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.250
<v Speaker 2>they think they read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they read?</v>

474
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.030
<v Speaker 2>And they have like an amazing collection</v>
<v Speaker 2>of books,</v>

475
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.570
<v Speaker 2>fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything really super low red.</v>

476
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.990
<v Speaker 2>So they do have some entertainment in</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of like fiction.</v>

477
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:00.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

478
00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:02.930
<v Speaker 2>periods of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I went up there with no expectation.</v>

479
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.500
<v Speaker 2>The only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I had heard of monks,</v>

480
00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:07.810
<v Speaker 2>I watched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen monks in movies and read</v>

481
00:21:07.811 --> 00:21:10.480
<v Speaker 2>articles and blogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I never,</v>

482
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.030
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know much about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the culture,</v>

483
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.960
<v Speaker 2>certainly about Russian Orthodox and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>different factions and this and that.</v>

484
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:18.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I went up there,</v>

485
00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.940
<v Speaker 2>eyes wide open and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

486
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.840
<v Speaker 2>I went up there really just to detach</v>
<v Speaker 2>and get away from feeling overloaded and</v>

487
00:21:25.841 --> 00:21:27.730
<v Speaker 2>feeling distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Man,</v>

488
00:21:27.731 --> 00:21:30.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm a father of four and I have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>business and my wife has an entrepreneur</v>

489
00:21:30.911 --> 00:21:33.250
<v Speaker 2>and Sandra and I just wanted to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

490
00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:36.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's is Kinda my been my journey.</v>

491
00:21:36.011 --> 00:21:38.170
<v Speaker 2>I learned best by diving into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown,</v>

492
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.880
<v Speaker 2>just like I did with Dave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just says,</v>

493
00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:41.710
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done in businesses and other</v>

494
00:21:41.711 --> 00:21:44.200
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like I learned best by going</v>

495
00:21:44.201 --> 00:21:45.034
<v Speaker 2>into the unknown.</v>

496
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:49.840
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't do a lot of research around</v>
<v Speaker 2>them or how they made money or this or</v>

497
00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:51.040
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just kind of showed up.</v>

498
00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

499
00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:58.030
<v Speaker 2>it's a crazy undertaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I guess if you knew you only had 15</v>

500
00:21:58.031 --> 00:22:01.120
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least you have like some light at the</v>

501
00:22:01.121 --> 00:22:04.620
<v Speaker 2>end of the rain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when that 15th Day came and what did</v>

502
00:22:04.621 --> 00:22:06.430
<v Speaker 2>you get in a car and drive away from</v>
<v Speaker 2>that place?</v>

503
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:07.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How fucking good did it feel?</v>

504
00:22:07.891 --> 00:22:12.050
<v Speaker 2>Did you check your phone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just felt really on data.</v>

505
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:15.190
<v Speaker 2>What's going on on twitter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on day four and five.</v>

506
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.720
<v Speaker 2>I was already kind of making excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was rationalizing in my head that's</v>

507
00:22:18.721 --> 00:22:21.280
<v Speaker 2>seven days would be enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like in my head I was going home day</v>

508
00:22:21.281 --> 00:22:22.430
<v Speaker 2>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

509
00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:23.441
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was like,</v>

510
00:22:23.441 --> 00:22:27.190
<v Speaker 2>no one's going to know the difference or</v>
<v Speaker 2>care if I went 15 days or seven days or</v>

511
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.320
<v Speaker 2>is not like if you're at mile 50 and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

512
00:22:29.321 --> 00:22:31.150
<v Speaker 2>that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

513
00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:34.270
<v Speaker 2>Same kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same kind of thing until you wake up the</v>

514
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.770
<v Speaker 2>next day and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dropped out.</v>

515
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:36.723
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you feel like,</v>

516
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

517
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:39.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

518
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.400
<v Speaker 2>I decided like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

519
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stick this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I left it was a,</v>

520
00:22:44.711 --> 00:22:46.900
<v Speaker 2>it was a good feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the feeling was proud.</v>

521
00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.710
<v Speaker 2>I felt proud of myself for sticking</v>
<v Speaker 2>through it.</v>

522
00:22:50.711 --> 00:22:51.760
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that funny?</v>

523
00:22:51.761 --> 00:22:53.830
<v Speaker 2>These guys had been there for 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 years,</v>

524
00:22:53.831 --> 00:22:54.431
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

525
00:22:54.431 --> 00:22:56.140
<v Speaker 2>I did two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

526
00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.230
<v Speaker 2>It felt good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet it's it.</v>

527
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.110
<v Speaker 2>It also felt good to go through a bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

528
00:23:02.111 --> 00:23:04.450
<v Speaker 2>it's the 50 years when you're describing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

529
00:23:04.451 --> 00:23:07.540
<v Speaker 2>That seems so insane to me that I can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>even relate.</v>

530
00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.430
<v Speaker 2>But when you're talking about your 15</v>
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>

531
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:10.061
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

532
00:23:10.061 --> 00:23:12.520
<v Speaker 2>you poor bastard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel bad for you.</v>

533
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.540
<v Speaker 2>The guy that 50 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he might as well be living in another</v>

534
00:23:16.541 --> 00:23:17.390
<v Speaker 2>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

535
00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.040
<v Speaker 2>As far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

536
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:24.010
<v Speaker 2>I went in there and it's twenties that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just so nothing,</v>

537
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.410
<v Speaker 2>no sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no family,</v>

538
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.990
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no neighborhood.</v>

539
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.570
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No fucking hobbies.</v>

540
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.850
<v Speaker 2>No drive to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

541
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.040
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know their,</v>

542
00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:39.190
<v Speaker 2>their impression of it is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we made this decision so it's not,</v>

543
00:23:39.191 --> 00:23:42.250
<v Speaker 2>we didn't sacrifice it like we decided</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the life we want to live.</v>

544
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.070
<v Speaker 2>But when he made this decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was 19 what?</v>

545
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.490
<v Speaker 2>1965</v>

546
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.070
<v Speaker 1>or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just black and white tvs.</v>

547
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a crazy decision.</v>

548
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:55.710
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy too to decide back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

549
00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.610
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what's coming and I've had enough,</v>

550
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.940
<v Speaker 1>I've had enough these daily newspapers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just too much information.</v>

551
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:02.960
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

552
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.000
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy time to check out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they don't know what the fuck's going</v>

553
00:24:08.001 --> 00:24:09.830
<v Speaker 1>on in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you quiz them on shit,</v>

554
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.530
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really quiz them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

555
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.720
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every Sunday night they have one,</v>

556
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:17.660
<v Speaker 1>there's one TV and one back room and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they watch the news.</v>

557
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.600
<v Speaker 1>So they get a sense of just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

558
00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:23.450
<v Speaker 1>kind of where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>State of the Union war.</v>

559
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:25.880
<v Speaker 1>If there's a nuclear meltdown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

560
00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:28.040
<v Speaker 1>One hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

561
00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:30.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They watch about an hour on Sunday</v>

562
00:24:30.111 --> 00:24:31.640
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one night a week.</v>

563
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's how the tuner who do they</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

564
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.890
<v Speaker 1>I was immediately like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my head went to like,</v>

565
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure we're being attacked right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm stuck at the monastery.</v>

566
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:45.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure the airlines are flying and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck here for another 30 days.</v>

567
00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

568
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:50.330
<v Speaker 1>my mind went to a place where I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking just the worst of everything.</v>

569
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what news do they trust?</v>

570
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they trust it all,</v>

571
00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.540
<v Speaker 1>but like which channel do they go to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

572
00:24:59.541 --> 00:25:00.740
<v Speaker 1>they would just watch like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

573
00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:02.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the local ABC,</v>

574
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:05.780
<v Speaker 1>see the local network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever's local in upstate New York.</v>

575
00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:10.640
<v Speaker 1>They weren't Netflix options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they have internet?</v>

576
00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no access to the Internet and I</v>

577
00:25:14.271 --> 00:25:16.340
<v Speaker 1>think they have access probably for</v>
<v Speaker 1>their job,</v>

578
00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:20.390
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the dog training Jesus Christ,</v>

579
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.930
<v Speaker 1>it was wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why is that so romantic to people?</v>

580
00:25:23.931 --> 00:25:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Because it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very romantic,</v>

581
00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about this idea of</v>

582
00:25:28.041 --> 00:25:29.810
<v Speaker 1>checking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

583
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I had a buddy who did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

584
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:33.590
<v Speaker 1>for all I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he still does it.</v>

585
00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:36.620
<v Speaker 1>I lost touch with them 25 plus years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

586
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:42.040
<v Speaker 1>but he was a taekwondo guy and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>started to meditate because he was</v>

587
00:25:43.371 --> 00:25:47.810
<v Speaker 1>always very nervous about sparring and</v>
<v Speaker 1>very nervous about competition.</v>

588
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:50.630
<v Speaker 1>So excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to figure out what was</v>

589
00:25:50.631 --> 00:25:51.800
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he said,</v>

590
00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:53.810
<v Speaker 1>let me just take some meditation</v>
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>

591
00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.210
<v Speaker 1>It took some meditation classes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>really enjoyed it,</v>

592
00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:57.830
<v Speaker 1>got really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really into it.</v>

593
00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:03.280
<v Speaker 1>And then one day decided to give up all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worldly possessions and all of the</v>

594
00:26:06.051 --> 00:26:08.930
<v Speaker 1>trappings of civilization and move into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the monastery.</v>

595
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:12.440
<v Speaker 1>And I remember we went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we met him for lunch one day,</v>

596
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:17.360
<v Speaker 1>he'd also become a vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you only ate vegetables and we were</v>

597
00:26:17.361 --> 00:26:20.960
<v Speaker 1>all just hanging around and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he seemed oddly a piece and it was so</v>

598
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:26.090
<v Speaker 1>confusing to me because at the time I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like probably 20 and I was just</v>

599
00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.100
<v Speaker 1>didn't know what the fuck is going on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

600
00:26:28.101 --> 00:26:33.101
<v Speaker 1>He was maybe 10 years older than me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy just decided I've had enough.</v>

601
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:36.350
<v Speaker 1>It was weird to me though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made me nervous.</v>

602
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:37.701
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

603
00:26:37.701 --> 00:26:41.210
<v Speaker 1>like he made me nervous that like he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto something.</v>

604
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 1>It may be nervous that he wiser</v>

605
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:48.510
<v Speaker 5>than me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it highlighted how fucked up I am.</v>

606
00:26:48.511 --> 00:26:50.400
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially at 20 years,</v>

607
00:26:50.401 --> 00:26:52.370
<v Speaker 5>it's so life is so chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

608
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:57.830
<v Speaker 5>No idea what the future holds for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it's going to be success or failure,</v>

609
00:26:58.021 --> 00:27:01.110
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to slip it every fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>banana peel you run across.</v>

610
00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:05.500
<v Speaker 2>But he seemed to have it figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting there and eating vegetables,</v>

611
00:27:05.501 --> 00:27:08.200
<v Speaker 2>all common shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's he now?</v>

612
00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.270
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost touch with them.</v>

613
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:12.280
<v Speaker 2>I lost touch with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

614
00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.400
<v Speaker 2>probably like 30 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

615
00:27:15.401 --> 00:27:16.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was 20,</v>

616
00:27:16.481 --> 00:27:20.590
<v Speaker 2>those guys freaked me out too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They must've freaked you out just when</v>

617
00:27:20.591 --> 00:27:21.640
<v Speaker 2>you did this book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

618
00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.290
<v Speaker 2>I freaked them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

619
00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.200
<v Speaker 2>I was an alien and I came in there high</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy,</v>

620
00:27:26.201 --> 00:27:27.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rah Rah and like,</v>

621
00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.790
<v Speaker 2>he's the only guys ever done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

622
00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.240
<v Speaker 2>probably probably at this particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>

623
00:27:34.241 --> 00:27:36.280
<v Speaker 2>I think for an extended period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that.</v>

624
00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

625
00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:42.020
<v Speaker 2>What w w why did they let you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

626
00:27:42.021 --> 00:27:43.810
<v Speaker 2>that I had written a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pryor,</v>

627
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living with a seal and they knew I was</v>

628
00:27:47.081 --> 00:27:49.330
<v Speaker 2>coming up there to write a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

629
00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess they liked the first book.</v>

630
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it be good for the dog business</v>

631
00:27:53.651 --> 00:27:54.700
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

632
00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

633
00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.420
<v Speaker 2>So they read your book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they read my book.</v>

634
00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:00.160
<v Speaker 2>Were you allowed to read books while you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were there?</v>

635
00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:02.260
<v Speaker 2>I was allowed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought,</v>

636
00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.280
<v Speaker 2>I brought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

637
00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:07.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like a big reader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I figured two books would carry me</v>

638
00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:09.190
<v Speaker 2>for 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 15 days.</v>

639
00:28:09.191 --> 00:28:11.810
<v Speaker 2>But I read them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read both in like the first day,</v>

640
00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.230
<v Speaker 2>like the first two days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause Yeah.</v>

641
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.210
<v Speaker 2>So then I was like a check whatever they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

642
00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mary poppins.</v>

643
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read this stupid shit.</v>

644
00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said I'm good.</v>

645
00:28:21.191 --> 00:28:22.780
<v Speaker 2>Just thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

646
00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:26.860
<v Speaker 2>So was there any point at like day 13</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're like,</v>

647
00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.020
<v Speaker 2>I actually Kinda liked this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

648
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:32.140
<v Speaker 2>I think around day seven and once I</v>
<v Speaker 2>realized like,</v>

649
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:34.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got the excuses out of my head that</v>

650
00:28:34.361 --> 00:28:35.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm staying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

651
00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:36.573
<v Speaker 2>I'm not leaving.</v>

652
00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm doing.</v>

653
00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:42.700
<v Speaker 2>And I settled into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got tremendously energized because</v>

654
00:28:42.701 --> 00:28:45.100
<v Speaker 2>like at the monastery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't make any decisions.</v>

655
00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:49.030
<v Speaker 2>Do you eat when they tell you to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eat what they tell you to eat.</v>

656
00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:51.640
<v Speaker 2>You go to service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the Church Bell Rings,</v>

657
00:28:51.641 --> 00:28:55.210
<v Speaker 2>you go [inaudible] one outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I showered once.</v>

658
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.690
<v Speaker 2>So all of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the decisions were taken away from</v>

659
00:28:58.691 --> 00:29:00.580
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when all the decisions are taken</v>

660
00:29:00.581 --> 00:29:02.950
<v Speaker 2>away from you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it frees up so much energy.</v>

661
00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.400
<v Speaker 2>So I was getting like super clear and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

662
00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.590
<v Speaker 2>I like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like no one could get to me.</v>

663
00:29:08.591 --> 00:29:11.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm not getting bombarded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one can schedule appointments with</v>

664
00:29:11.951 --> 00:29:12.784
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

665
00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:17.050
<v Speaker 2>This isn't so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever done a sensory deprivation</v>

666
00:29:17.051 --> 00:29:20.020
<v Speaker 2>tank?</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] there's</v>

667
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:22.320
<v Speaker 5>the thing about the sensory deprivation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what it is,</v>

668
00:29:22.321 --> 00:29:24.840
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing that's most interesting about</v>

669
00:29:24.841 --> 00:29:29.841
<v Speaker 5>it is that in the absence of input,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your brain is freer and you can make</v>

670
00:29:30.061 --> 00:29:33.270
<v Speaker 5>decisions better and think about things</v>
<v Speaker 5>better because there's no input coming</v>

671
00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:34.590
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't think about it.</v>

672
00:29:34.591 --> 00:29:39.591
<v Speaker 5>But as we're sitting here just touching,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this table is input.</v>

673
00:29:39.781 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 5>You are not looking at each other across</v>
<v Speaker 5>the lights.</v>

674
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.370
<v Speaker 5>All of this is input.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in that tank there's no input.</v>

675
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:48.940
<v Speaker 5>And in the absence of input,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it frees up more resources for your</v>

676
00:29:48.941 --> 00:29:51.130
<v Speaker 5>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in a sense,</v>

677
00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:55.090
<v Speaker 5>what these monks you're saying or doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>by having everything on a schedule,</v>

678
00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:58.600
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to think about anything</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's nothing coming in.</v>

679
00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.060
<v Speaker 5>There's no twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>facebook,</v>

680
00:30:01.061 --> 00:30:02.680
<v Speaker 5>all that jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>

681
00:30:02.681 --> 00:30:04.570
<v Speaker 5>you have more resources.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>

682
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.433
<v Speaker 5>And he feel better.</v>

683
00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:07.540
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

684
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:09.310
<v Speaker 2>And I experienced that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

685
00:30:09.311 --> 00:30:13.330
<v Speaker 2>I think the average American makes like</v>
<v Speaker 2>35,000 to 50,000 decisions a day.</v>

686
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.060
<v Speaker 2>And there's a real thing called decision</v>
<v Speaker 2>fatigue.</v>

687
00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:17.103
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

688
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:21.190
<v Speaker 2>And when you eliminate all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I remember when I came home,</v>

689
00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.490
<v Speaker 2>I came home and the day I got home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife is like,</v>

690
00:30:24.491 --> 00:30:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Sweetie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take the kids to school and</v>

691
00:30:27.611 --> 00:30:29.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna take the blue car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

692
00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:30.670
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the blue car.</v>

693
00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:32.260
<v Speaker 2>And she came back a minute later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

694
00:30:32.261 --> 00:30:34.390
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the other car,</v>

695
00:30:34.391 --> 00:30:36.400
<v Speaker 2>because I want to park in the blue cars</v>
<v Speaker 2>too big.</v>

696
00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:38.050
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could take the other car.</v>

697
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:39.640
<v Speaker 2>And then she came back in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she goes,</v>

698
00:30:39.641 --> 00:30:41.740
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take the blue car because</v>

699
00:30:41.741 --> 00:30:42.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah,</v>

700
00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:48.150
<v Speaker 2>you're using so much energy or already</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 7:45 AM on what car to drive.</v>

701
00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.400
<v Speaker 2>And I realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happens all the time.</v>

702
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:52.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like exhausting,</v>

703
00:30:52.961 --> 00:30:54.970
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>

704
00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:55.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go on.</v>

705
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

706
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying like when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have any of that.</v>

707
00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.830
<v Speaker 2>So it freed up all this energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just making like massive life</v>

708
00:31:02.831 --> 00:31:05.830
<v Speaker 2>lists what I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I became very aware of my relationship</v>

709
00:31:05.831 --> 00:31:08.470
<v Speaker 2>with time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when we think of relationships,</v>

710
00:31:08.471 --> 00:31:12.310
<v Speaker 2>we think of our relationships with our</v>
<v Speaker 2>mom or a dad or a kids or this and that.</v>

711
00:31:12.311 --> 00:31:14.770
<v Speaker 2>But like no one thinks of a relationship</v>
<v Speaker 2>with time.</v>

712
00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm turning 50 the average American</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives to be 78 years old.</v>

713
00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.000
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope I'm not,</v>

714
00:31:22.001 --> 00:31:24.580
<v Speaker 2>but that means I got 28 years of life</v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

715
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:28.450
<v Speaker 2>If you reverse engineer that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you reverse engineer it,</v>

716
00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.370
<v Speaker 2>you know like I just climbed Mt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington,</v>

717
00:31:30.371 --> 00:31:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 year olds climbing Mount Washington,</v>

718
00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:37.150
<v Speaker 2>the act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual years that you have left to</v>

719
00:31:37.151 --> 00:31:39.250
<v Speaker 2>be active and do the shit that we want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

720
00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:42.760
<v Speaker 2>They shrink significantly as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>percentage as you get older.</v>

721
00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:45.850
<v Speaker 2>So once you get aware of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with time,</v>

722
00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:50.230
<v Speaker 2>everything shifts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had a fundamental shift when I</v>

723
00:31:50.231 --> 00:31:52.390
<v Speaker 2>came home with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it relates to my relationship with</v>

724
00:31:52.391 --> 00:31:56.200
<v Speaker 2>time and who I want to spend it with and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I want to do.</v>

725
00:31:56.230 --> 00:32:00.040
<v Speaker 2>And I want to put more on my plate of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that I love to do with the</v>

726
00:32:00.041 --> 00:32:03.670
<v Speaker 2>people I love to do it with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I started getting like a lot of</v>

727
00:32:03.671 --> 00:32:08.290
<v Speaker 2>clarity around that when I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting bombarded with everything else.</v>

728
00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't spend any time alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only time I spent a loan as when if</v>

729
00:32:12.041 --> 00:32:14.350
<v Speaker 2>I go for a run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else is I'm getting</v>

730
00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:17.230
<v Speaker 2>influenced by everybody else and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>

731
00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:21.580
<v Speaker 2>So I'm losing my main superpower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my instinct to survive.</v>

732
00:32:21.581 --> 00:32:23.170
<v Speaker 2>I've got a 90 on my sat man.</v>

733
00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:28.060
<v Speaker 2>I survive on instinct and gut and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>losing that because I was so distracted.</v>

734
00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:32.290
<v Speaker 2>So once I started to get that alone time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to go to a monastery to do</v>

735
00:32:32.291 --> 00:32:32.950
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just gotta,</v>

736
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:35.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carving out a little bit of time for</v>

737
00:32:35.081 --> 00:32:38.940
<v Speaker 2>myself every day I just started to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot clearer on like you,</v>

738
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.900
<v Speaker 2>how do I want to live?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reverse engineer the rest of my life.</v>

739
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think this is something that you</v>

740
00:32:45.581 --> 00:32:48.050
<v Speaker 2>would do on a regular basis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

741
00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:51.110
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that I have and I feel</v>

742
00:32:51.111 --> 00:32:51.944
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

743
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.080
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like going into the unknown,</v>

744
00:32:54.081 --> 00:32:55.880
<v Speaker 2>it gives you an edge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

745
00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:57.620
<v Speaker 2>it gives you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come out of it a little bit</v>

746
00:32:57.621 --> 00:32:59.630
<v Speaker 2>different than you go in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be a monastery.</v>

747
00:32:59.631 --> 00:33:01.700
<v Speaker 2>He could be a race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be business experience,</v>

748
00:33:01.701 --> 00:33:02.450
<v Speaker 2>like whatever.</v>

749
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But just doing something different,</v>

750
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:07.580
<v Speaker 2>doing it different because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

751
00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.380
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's,</v>

752
00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I would do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think I have to because I</v>

753
00:33:13.161 --> 00:33:15.620
<v Speaker 2>already have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tap into that when I need it.</v>

754
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:19.160
<v Speaker 2>Do you dental where off though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause a lot of times inspiration for</v>

755
00:33:19.161 --> 00:33:20.260
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

756
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.240
<v Speaker 2>it's fleeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The takeaways won't,</v>

757
00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.490
<v Speaker 2>won't wear off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm already back on my phone,</v>

758
00:33:25.491 --> 00:33:27.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm back in modern day life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

759
00:33:27.441 --> 00:33:32.441
<v Speaker 2>I'm all fucked up again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the main things like my relationship</v>

760
00:33:32.931 --> 00:33:35.300
<v Speaker 2>with time and certain things of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

761
00:33:35.301 --> 00:33:38.330
<v Speaker 2>who I want to spend there with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I want to do and continuing to</v>

762
00:33:38.331 --> 00:33:42.380
<v Speaker 2>build what I call my life resume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing these things to build up my,</v>

763
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:45.350
<v Speaker 2>not my business resume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my life resume.</v>

764
00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:49.220
<v Speaker 2>That's things that I know I want to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>more of and that will never go away.</v>

765
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:51.050
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

766
00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

767
00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:55.310
<v Speaker 2>there's things that came out of it that</v>
<v Speaker 2>will last forever.</v>

768
00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:57.560
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of adjustments did you</v>
<v Speaker 2>make when you came back?</v>

769
00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Started saying no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Started praying.</v>

770
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:02.570
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I reversed engineered my life.</v>

771
00:34:02.571 --> 00:34:04.790
<v Speaker 2>So let me give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My parents are</v>

772
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.030
<v Speaker 2>88.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

773
00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:09.800
<v Speaker 2>I have a good relationship with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>

774
00:34:09.801 --> 00:34:11.510
<v Speaker 2>My parents are 88.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They live in Florida.</v>

775
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:15.800
<v Speaker 2>I see my parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say my parents lived to be 92.</v>

776
00:34:15.801 --> 00:34:17.230
<v Speaker 2>I hope they live longer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's say,</v>

777
00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:19.280
<v Speaker 2>let's say they live five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

778
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:23.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't have five years left with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>

779
00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:27.560
<v Speaker 2>I see my parents twice a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means I have 10 visits with my</v>

780
00:34:27.561 --> 00:34:30.710
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I started to look at Shit like</v>

781
00:34:30.711 --> 00:34:34.010
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made significant changes.</v>

782
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.731
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

783
00:34:34.731 --> 00:34:36.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna get on a plane and see my</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>

784
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:39.680
<v Speaker 2>And when I'm in those moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my feet are on the ground.</v>

785
00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:43.640
<v Speaker 2>That's where I am because I only have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>limited amount of time with them.</v>

786
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:45.620
<v Speaker 2>You understand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not five years people</v>

787
00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:46.850
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh I got five more now.</v>

788
00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:48.890
<v Speaker 2>You know how many times you see him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

789
00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.440
<v Speaker 2>you see him two times a year you've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 visits.</v>

790
00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.900
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just started looking at stuff like</v>

791
00:34:53.901 --> 00:34:58.901
<v Speaker 2>that and became really aware when I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 2>moments that are big moments to take it</v>

792
00:34:59.811 --> 00:35:03.290
<v Speaker 2>in and take note of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it has an impact on me and I</v>

793
00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:05.390
<v Speaker 2>appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

794
00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.550
<v Speaker 2>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you shift anything else in your</v>

795
00:35:07.551 --> 00:35:09.560
<v Speaker 2>life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like as far as like what you do with</v>

796
00:35:09.561 --> 00:35:11.900
<v Speaker 2>your time during the days I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

797
00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:14.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started putting parameters around</v>

798
00:35:14.001 --> 00:35:17.060
<v Speaker 2>simple things like my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I was the guy at the movie</v>

799
00:35:17.061 --> 00:35:18.130
<v Speaker 2>theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be checking my young,</v>

800
00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.660
<v Speaker 2>forgot the bing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like look under my shirt so the</v>

801
00:35:20.661 --> 00:35:22.790
<v Speaker 2>light doesn't light up and know what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

802
00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:25.490
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm glad at least you did that</v>
<v Speaker 2>courteous.</v>

803
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

804
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:28.160
<v Speaker 2>But I put parameters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

805
00:35:28.161 --> 00:35:30.980
<v Speaker 2>nothing I'm not keeping my phone in at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

806
00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.840
<v Speaker 2>at nighttime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

807
00:35:32.841 --> 00:35:34.640
<v Speaker 2>seeing anything come in at five in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>

808
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:36.980
<v Speaker 2>nothing at the dinner table with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

809
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.390
<v Speaker 2>So like basic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious things like that.</v>

810
00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:43.830
<v Speaker 2>But as far as my time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made two really big changes.</v>

811
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.810
<v Speaker 2>One changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I kind of always been doing this,</v>

812
00:35:46.811 --> 00:35:48.750
<v Speaker 2>so I wouldn't necessarily say it was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>

813
00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:53.040
<v Speaker 2>but I take three hours a day for myself</v>
<v Speaker 2>religiously every day.</v>

814
00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:56.400
<v Speaker 2>Like I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's new just since the monster.</v>

815
00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:57.563
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

816
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:59.880
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

817
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:04.170
<v Speaker 2>it's unwavering since the monastery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of been in my life and add in</v>

818
00:36:04.171 --> 00:36:06.990
<v Speaker 2>my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just made a pie chart of time.</v>

819
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:10.650
<v Speaker 2>It's 24 hours in a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all have the same pie chart.</v>

820
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:13.260
<v Speaker 2>It starts the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

821
00:36:13.261 --> 00:36:15.210
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sleep seven hours.</v>

822
00:36:15.211 --> 00:36:17.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I'm out of balance with them</v>

823
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:20.280
<v Speaker 2>doing something big and put right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>six or seven hours.</v>

824
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:22.620
<v Speaker 2>I take three for myself and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>cumulative.</v>

825
00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.180
<v Speaker 2>So like I'll take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be,</v>

826
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:26.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go for an hour run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna sit in the Sauna for 20</v>

827
00:36:26.821 --> 00:36:28.470
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do fucking nothing.</v>

828
00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:33.360
<v Speaker 2>But when I'm in my time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not mad that I'm not with my kids or</v>

829
00:36:33.361 --> 00:36:36.270
<v Speaker 2>my wife or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I'm not mad that I'm not at my</v>

830
00:36:36.271 --> 00:36:38.760
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's my time and when I'm with my</v>

831
00:36:38.761 --> 00:36:41.400
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not mad that I'm not at work or</v>

832
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:46.020
<v Speaker 2>whatever cause I don't want to resent my</v>
<v Speaker 2>wife from my boss or anybody for taking</v>

833
00:36:46.021 --> 00:36:49.050
<v Speaker 2>away the shit that I love to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if they said you can't run,</v>

834
00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.470
<v Speaker 2>you can't go in the sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be really pissed off.</v>

835
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:55.080
<v Speaker 2>I'd be pissed at my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be pissed at everybody.</v>

836
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.920
<v Speaker 2>So I take three hours for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The average American works 40 hours a</v>

837
00:36:58.921 --> 00:37:00.780
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's eight hours a day.</v>

838
00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:04.020
<v Speaker 2>You still have six hours left in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

839
00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:05.790
<v Speaker 2>Now of course you have to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to commute,</v>

840
00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:10.740
<v Speaker 2>you got family and this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my point is even take 24 hours is a</v>

841
00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.840
<v Speaker 2>long day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned that running,</v>

842
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:16.140
<v Speaker 2>you can get a lot of shit done if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep moving for 24 hours.</v>

843
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Even if you take three hours for</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

844
00:37:19.171 --> 00:37:23.040
<v Speaker 2>if you get rid of the stuff that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>move the needle in the buckets that are</v>

845
00:37:23.041 --> 00:37:26.370
<v Speaker 2>most important to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get a lot done.</v>

846
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:28.970
<v Speaker 2>So I take three hours for myself and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been a,</v>

847
00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:30.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not mad about it.</v>

848
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:36.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like guilty about it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm way out of balance.</v>

849
00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:40.590
<v Speaker 2>And then the second thing actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't come from the monastery,</v>

850
00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:42.720
<v Speaker 2>but it was like kind of an offshoot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the monastery.</v>

851
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.450
<v Speaker 2>I was mentioned to you that I climbed</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mount Washington.</v>

852
00:37:45.451 --> 00:37:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Now Washington's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

853
00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:50.040
<v Speaker 2>in the winter is one of the 10 most</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous mountains.</v>

854
00:37:50.041 --> 00:37:52.650
<v Speaker 2>I think the climb certainly in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>states has the highest death rate</v>

855
00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:57.510
<v Speaker 2>because the winds are go up to about</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere from on any given day,</v>

856
00:37:57.511 --> 00:38:00.930
<v Speaker 2>50 to a hundred miles an hour minus 35</v>
<v Speaker 2>degrees.</v>

857
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:06.060
<v Speaker 2>No visibility to fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a hundred miles an hour.</v>

858
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is that like?</v>

859
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:09.331
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

860
00:38:09.331 --> 00:38:12.840
<v Speaker 2>I had an experience a hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I experienced super high winds.</v>

861
00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:16.260
<v Speaker 2>Like when did you experience 50?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think need more 50.</v>

862
00:38:16.261 --> 00:38:16.980
<v Speaker 2>60.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

863
00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:18.810
<v Speaker 2>What does it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

864
00:38:18.811 --> 00:38:21.630
<v Speaker 2>the first I went twice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time I went to do it,</v>

865
00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't make it to the summit because</v>

866
00:38:24.001 --> 00:38:24.870
<v Speaker 2>it was too dangerous.</v>

867
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:29.370
<v Speaker 2>A T I actually timed out like I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have enough time to get back to make it</v>

868
00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:30.810
<v Speaker 2>an altitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

869
00:38:30.811 --> 00:38:32.730
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just in the amount of darkness,</v>

870
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:34.860
<v Speaker 2>darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would just gotten too too,</v>

871
00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.870
<v Speaker 2>too tough to get back down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was with five friends,</v>

872
00:38:37.871 --> 00:38:39.880
<v Speaker 2>no tour guide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean did everything wrong.</v>

873
00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I actually came home after that</v>

874
00:38:43.901 --> 00:38:45.280
<v Speaker 2>attempt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a year ago,</v>

875
00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.790
<v Speaker 2>and I was talking to my wife about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was getting,</v>

876
00:38:48.791 --> 00:38:52.050
<v Speaker 2>I posted it on facebook so everybody was</v>
<v Speaker 2>blasted.</v>

877
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:53.550
<v Speaker 2>You make it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

878
00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.300
<v Speaker 2>not Washington is only about four or</v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

879
00:38:55.301 --> 00:38:57.460
<v Speaker 2>five miles to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>4.6 miles.</v>

880
00:38:57.461 --> 00:38:59.740
<v Speaker 2>Just the elements in the weather that</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it so hard.</v>

881
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:02.350
<v Speaker 2>And I said to my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I failed.</v>

882
00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:03.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I didn't make it.</v>

883
00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:06.280
<v Speaker 2>I feel like an ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so disappointed.</v>

884
00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:07.480
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go back.</v>

885
00:39:07.481 --> 00:39:08.110
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

886
00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:10.990
<v Speaker 2>get a tour guide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>break in your boots,</v>

887
00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:15.310
<v Speaker 2>properly trained for this and go back</v>
<v Speaker 2>next winter and check it off your list.</v>

888
00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:17.500
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next winter,</v>

889
00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:22.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm going back on Saturday next winter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like who knows if I'm going to be</v>

890
00:39:23.501 --> 00:39:26.560
<v Speaker 2>healthy it off next winter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went back next winter,</v>

891
00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:29.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean that Saturday with the same guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we did it.</v>

892
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:32.980
<v Speaker 2>And then recently this year I took my</v>
<v Speaker 2>son who's eight,</v>

893
00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:34.390
<v Speaker 2>not to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're like,</v>

894
00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:37.300
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go camp out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to experience this,</v>

895
00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.150
<v Speaker 2>got them a minus 40 sleeping bag and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>

896
00:39:40.151 --> 00:39:42.460
<v Speaker 2>And we went out there with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend is a police officer and</v>

897
00:39:42.461 --> 00:39:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Suffolk County.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He brought his daughter and we're</v>

898
00:39:45.041 --> 00:39:48.400
<v Speaker 2>sitting on out there sleeping outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking freezing,</v>

899
00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:53.410
<v Speaker 2>fucking freezing and I'm all bundled up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I turned to him and I'm like,</v>

900
00:39:53.411 --> 00:39:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how often do you do shit like this?</v>

901
00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a police officer,</v>

902
00:39:57.551 --> 00:40:00.400
<v Speaker 2>he's the happiest guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rock star shape.</v>

903
00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:03.970
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call it the Kevin rule.</v>

904
00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:09.330
<v Speaker 2>He goes every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go on one trip a year with my college</v>

905
00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:14.820
<v Speaker 2>roommates been doing since I'm 21 and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then once every two months I take a</v>

906
00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.830
<v Speaker 2>weekend and I do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go camping.</v>

907
00:40:17.831 --> 00:40:20.320
<v Speaker 2>I would run a marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go hiking,</v>

908
00:40:20.321 --> 00:40:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I'll go to whatever with my family or</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>

909
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:25.420
<v Speaker 2>And I said to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I can't,</v>

910
00:40:25.421 --> 00:40:29.170
<v Speaker 2>going back to your question about time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I can't take a weekend,</v>

911
00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:33.820
<v Speaker 2>every eight weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once every two months,</v>

912
00:40:33.821 --> 00:40:37.540
<v Speaker 2>if I can't carve out a day or two to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take some kind of adventure to put on my</v>

913
00:40:37.541 --> 00:40:40.690
<v Speaker 2>life resume or to have collected a</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment for me,</v>

914
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:44.470
<v Speaker 2>then my life is out of balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call it the Kevin rule.</v>

915
00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.840
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I live 30 more years,</v>

916
00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:50.050
<v Speaker 2>if I live to 80 and I do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

917
00:40:50.051 --> 00:40:53.010
<v Speaker 2>for 30 years it's 150 or a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>basic,</v>

918
00:40:53.011 --> 00:40:57.820
<v Speaker 2>150 more fucking amazing memories that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to create.</v>

919
00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:03.270
<v Speaker 2>And that became another one of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>time-related monastery related urgency</v>

920
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.130
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just,</v>

921
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:09.460
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just became a real big clarity around</v>

922
00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:10.360
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

923
00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:14.470
<v Speaker 2>I want to live with urgency and I want</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's cumulative.</v>

944

<v Speaker 2>It's not one or I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

945
00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.360
<v Speaker 2>I made my one person ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

946
00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:11.090
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be one person every day or</v>

947
00:42:11.091 --> 00:42:14.720
<v Speaker 2>so with some new requests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was the first shift.</v>

948
00:42:14.721 --> 00:42:17.360
<v Speaker 2>And the second thing is for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I put myself first,</v>

949
00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:18.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

950
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:23.360
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of times I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in certain times I do.</v>

951
00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:26.540
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized that I was,</v>

952
00:42:26.541 --> 00:42:28.310
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe might be a little bit more</v>

953
00:42:28.311 --> 00:42:31.310
<v Speaker 2>specific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I realized I love football.</v>

954
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:33.950
<v Speaker 2>I'll watch a lot of football,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

955
00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.590
<v Speaker 2>I realized that I was watching two</v>
<v Speaker 2>games,</v>

956
00:42:36.591 --> 00:42:39.950
<v Speaker 2>the college game on Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fantasy football Sunday.</v>

957
00:42:39.951 --> 00:42:42.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm locked in Sunday night game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monday night,</v>

958
00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:46.490
<v Speaker 2>Thursday night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I realized that if at this point,</v>

959
00:42:46.491 --> 00:42:51.491
<v Speaker 2>if I live to be 85 80 whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be 36,000 hours of football,</v>

960
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:57.640
<v Speaker 2>36,000 hours football,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'd be watching that throw in some</v>

961
00:42:58.341 --> 00:43:00.050
<v Speaker 2>of the fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing some of the other stuff.</v>

962
00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like I pulled out this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took the,</v>

963
00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:06.710
<v Speaker 2>the fo the plug out and I freed up these</v>
<v Speaker 2>36,000 hours and my wife said,</v>

964
00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.180
<v Speaker 2>don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean you google live in the</v>

965
00:43:08.181 --> 00:43:08.990
<v Speaker 2>monastery?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

966
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:10.190
<v Speaker 2>it's 15 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweetie.</v>

967
00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:14.330
<v Speaker 2>I just freed up 36,000 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get the benefit of that.</v>

968
00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:18.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm going for 15 days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I freed up the time by eliminating</v>

969
00:43:18.891 --> 00:43:20.600
<v Speaker 2>stuff that like fucking didn't move the</v>
<v Speaker 2>needle.</v>

970
00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.750
<v Speaker 2>So you stop watching football told I</v>
<v Speaker 2>still watch it,</v>

971
00:43:23.751 --> 00:43:26.720
<v Speaker 2>but I mean I became very aware of it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just like,</v>

972
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:28.430
<v Speaker 2>I still watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I check in.</v>

973
00:43:28.431 --> 00:43:30.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sitting around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

974
00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:31.970
<v Speaker 2>on Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And nothing wrong with it.</v>

975
00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.060
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't moving the needle in my</v>

976
00:43:35.061 --> 00:43:37.730
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my finances or my wellness.</v>

977
00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:44.060
<v Speaker 2>But what about recreation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does recreation time is that valuable?</v>

978
00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Like enjoying things like sitting back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and watching a good movie enjoying?</v>

979
00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:50.600
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I do.</v>

980
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.190
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not,</v>

981
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:53.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

982
00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking for myself as much as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>asking for you.</v>

983
00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:57.471
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

984
00:43:57.471 --> 00:43:58.071
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

985
00:43:58.071 --> 00:43:59.720
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be happy and do the things you</v>

986
00:43:59.721 --> 00:44:01.850
<v Speaker 2>like to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

987
00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.170
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

988
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:05.300
<v Speaker 2>I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at it very simply.</v>

989
00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.670
<v Speaker 2>I got three or four buckets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my family and my wellness plan,</v>

990
00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.000
<v Speaker 2>my finances and causes that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>important to me.</v>

991
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.150
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's not moving the needle in those</v>

992
00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:17.030
<v Speaker 2>four buckets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really just a distraction.</v>

993
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that doesn't mean I'm not going to</v>

994
00:44:18.981 --> 00:44:20.120
<v Speaker 2>go to a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's family.</v>

995
00:44:20.121 --> 00:44:20.570
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

996
00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:23.570
<v Speaker 2>it's part of my wellness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relaxing as part of my wellness.</v>

997
00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:25.910
<v Speaker 2>You want to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

998
00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are kind of,</v>

999
00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:31.390
<v Speaker 2>everything else kind of gets to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like going to lunch to,</v>

1000
00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:35.160
<v Speaker 2>to look at someone else's idea and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>category I don't really know much about</v>

1001
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.100
<v Speaker 2>because they want to maybe get to me or</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't my wife.</v>

1002
00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:39.670
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1003
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.113
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1004
00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.640
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should make a tee shirt.</v>

1005
00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:47.280
<v Speaker 2>I've said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1006
00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:49.530
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was starting out as an</v>

1007
00:44:49.531 --> 00:44:52.110
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneur when I was 20 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1008
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:55.860
<v Speaker 2>and I was cleaning kiddie pools and</v>
<v Speaker 2>through in the music business I was</v>

1009
00:44:55.861 --> 00:44:58.980
<v Speaker 2>doing all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I laugh at a lot of jokes that were</v>

1010
00:44:58.981 --> 00:44:59.814
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>

1011
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:01.740
<v Speaker 2>I know what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1012
00:45:01.741 --> 00:45:04.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To get deals to get stuff out of La</v>

1013
00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Laugh and I'm sick of laughing at jokes</v>
<v Speaker 2>than on funny.</v>

1014
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.730
<v Speaker 2>That's actually very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you saying that it's very funny.</v>

1015
00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:15.510
<v Speaker 2>It's a smart thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the beginning it's very hard,</v>

1016
00:45:15.511 --> 00:45:17.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're trying to get momentum,</v>

1017
00:45:17.251 --> 00:45:19.020
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to establish</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships.</v>

1018
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:21.030
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want people to like you.</v>

1019
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:25.050
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to dead face a stupid</v>
<v Speaker 2>joke that have people go,</v>

1020
00:45:25.051 --> 00:45:27.420

<v Speaker 2>anything with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1022
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:30.240
<v Speaker 2>So you laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1023
00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:36.000
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you organize your time like very</v>

1024
00:45:36.001 --> 00:45:38.130
<v Speaker 2>specifically now and did you do that in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the past?</v>

1025
00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:41.970
<v Speaker 2>I do now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it in the past cause you know,</v>

1026
00:45:41.971 --> 00:45:44.400
<v Speaker 2>in the path I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a do anything.</v>

1027
00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:49.230
<v Speaker 2>I say yes to two action things without</v>
<v Speaker 2>really thinking them through very often.</v>

1028
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.190
<v Speaker 2>Right now what I do is I have a third</v>
<v Speaker 2>grade,</v>

1029
00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:56.910
<v Speaker 2>three year old system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have two notebooks.</v>

1030
00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:00.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of old school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really operate well keeping</v>

1031
00:46:00.001 --> 00:46:03.390
<v Speaker 2>stuff and phones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just take everything that comes into</v>

1032
00:46:03.391 --> 00:46:05.850
<v Speaker 2>my head and I put it on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd dump it out in my head to free up</v>

1033
00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:08.940
<v Speaker 2>space in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have one journal that has</v>

1034
00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:13.080
<v Speaker 2>everything I need to do and I just do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to get it out of my head.</v>

1035
00:46:13.081 --> 00:46:17.250
<v Speaker 2>So I don't have to remember that I have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get my son's friends eight year old</v>

1036
00:46:17.251 --> 00:46:19.620
<v Speaker 2>birthday present for Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just write it down.</v>

1037
00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:22.110
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean it goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's out of my head.</v>

1038
00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:26.190
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I have my daily from that list</v>

1039
00:46:26.191 --> 00:46:28.140
<v Speaker 2>I picked the most important things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to get done.</v>

1040
00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:31.020
<v Speaker 2>And then I know the night before I write</v>
<v Speaker 2>them down or,</v>

1041
00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:34.020
<v Speaker 2>or the beginning of the week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just knock them out man.</v>

1042
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:39.180
<v Speaker 2>And how long ago was it that you went to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this monastery and did this fear?</v>

1043
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:40.440
<v Speaker 2>The year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one year ago,</v>

1044
00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:44.580
<v Speaker 2>and has this enthusiasm or this feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>waned at all?</v>

1045
00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:46.020
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1046
00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:49.230
<v Speaker 2>That's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you conveyed that in the</v>

1047
00:46:49.231 --> 00:46:51.120
<v Speaker 2>book?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

1048
00:46:51.121 --> 00:46:51.881
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1049
00:46:51.881 --> 00:46:54.090
<v Speaker 2>I've been living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I've been living my life</v>

1050
00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:59.070
<v Speaker 2>like this even before the monastery just</v>
<v Speaker 2>reinforced a lot of things.</v>

1051
00:46:59.071 --> 00:47:01.650
<v Speaker 2>I think combined with the fact that for</v>
<v Speaker 2>some reason,</v>

1052
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:04.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm turning 50 it's had,</v>

00:47:04.501 --> 00:47:07.440
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking with me in a way that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't think it would.</v>

1054
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:09.360
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know how you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how old are you?</v>

1055

<v Speaker 2>don't say to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the clock.</v>

1064
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:37.390

<v Speaker 2>enough?</v>

<v Speaker 2>delicious vinyl.</v>

<v Speaker 2>album.</v>

1091
00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:36.280
<v Speaker 2>And I moved to New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have two things on my resume,</v>

1092
00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.910
<v Speaker 2>Kiddie pool attendant cause I was a</v>

<v Speaker 2>So I'm staying on my friend's couch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living on his couch with his roommate</v>

<v Speaker 2>out of the apartment.</v>

1095
00:48:47.471 --> 00:48:51.190
<v Speaker 2>So instead of going to look for a new</v>
<v Speaker 2>apartment over the weekend,</v>

1096
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:54.010
<v Speaker 2>I go to my friend's Bachelor Party on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jersey Shore.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm getting a drink at the bar and I see</v>

1098
00:48:57.341 --> 00:48:59.200
<v Speaker 2>this girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started chatting with her.</v>

1099
00:48:59.201 --> 00:49:02.710
<v Speaker 2>She asked me where I live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told her actually as of Monday,</v>

1100
00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:03.910
<v Speaker 2>I have nowhere to go.</v>

1101
00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:07.510
<v Speaker 2>She takes out a Napkin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She writes her address on the Napkin.</v>

1102
00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:10.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm 21 years old and she says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's an emergency on Monday and</v>

1103
00:49:10.871 --> 00:49:12.280
<v Speaker 2>you're stuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can come live with me.</v>

1104
00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:15.490
<v Speaker 2>Monday comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get kicked out of my friend's</v>

1105
00:49:15.491 --> 00:49:17.140
<v Speaker 2>apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have nowhere to go.</v>

1106
00:49:17.141 --> 00:49:18.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an emergency.</v>

1107
00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:22.510
<v Speaker 2>I take out the Napkin and I live with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this girl and her roommate for six</v>

1108
00:49:22.511 --> 00:49:26.800
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turns out that her father is a big</v>

1109
00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:30.220
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneur business man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He owns a piece of the Yankees,</v>

1110
00:49:30.221 --> 00:49:34.990
<v Speaker 2>dislike monster mogul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write this song for the New York</v>

<v Speaker 2>Knicks called go New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go and it becomes a big success.</v>

1112
00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:40.700
<v Speaker 2>You remember that song?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1113
00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:40.960

<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>

1115
00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:43.530
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a sports fan.</v>

1116
00:49:43.531 --> 00:49:47.350
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a big hit and I just realized</v>

1117
00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:50.290
<v Speaker 2>that there's an opportunity to write</v>
<v Speaker 2>theme songs for all these professional</v>

1118
00:49:50.291 --> 00:49:53.110
<v Speaker 2>sports teams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have a penny to go in the</v>

1119
00:49:53.111 --> 00:49:56.560
<v Speaker 2>studio to do the demos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to shop them to the team.</v>

1120
00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.190
<v Speaker 2>So I need money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I go to this music guy and he says,</v>

1121
00:50:00.191 --> 00:50:05.191
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you $10,000 to go and do these</v>
<v Speaker 2>songs for 10% of everything you make for</v>

1122
00:50:05.651 --> 00:50:07.720
<v Speaker 2>the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to buy me like a style of the</v>

1123

1132
00:50:27.411 --> 00:50:30.550
<v Speaker 2>business mogul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm living with her and I sit down</v>

1133
00:50:30.551 --> 00:50:32.240
<v Speaker 2>and I'd go to this guy's apartment</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1134
00:50:32.241 --> 00:50:36.050

<v Speaker 2>Manhattan,</v>

1138
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:47.390
<v Speaker 2>in Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just setting the stage of the</v>

1139
00:50:47.391 --> 00:50:51.230
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I go in and I tell him the story</v>

1140
00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:56.330
<v Speaker 2>about the 10% and he says to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would trade,</v>

1141
00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:01.030
<v Speaker 2>this is exactly what he said to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will trade everything that I have if</v>

1142
00:51:01.031 --> 00:51:02.030
<v Speaker 2>you'd get out of my daughter's life.</v>

1143
00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Automate everything I have for the one</v>

1144
00:51:10.011 --> 00:51:11.480
<v Speaker 2>thing that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1145
00:51:11.481 --> 00:51:12.650
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking broke.</v>

1147
00:51:14.601 --> 00:51:15.890

<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1148
00:51:15.891 --> 00:51:19.100
<v Speaker 2>youth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he had already gone through the</v>

1149
00:51:19.101 --> 00:51:21.140
<v Speaker 2>journey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though he had everything,</v>

1150
00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:26.390
<v Speaker 2>he already had gone through the process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't that 20 year old that you're</v>

1151
00:51:26.391 --> 00:51:29.330
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whatever he had gone through it,</v>

1152
00:51:29.331 --> 00:51:32.960
<v Speaker 2>he had it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He Wa he wa he missed the process,</v>

1153
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:37.400
<v Speaker 2>the journey of being you coming up at 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not know like,</v>

1154
00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:38.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here you are.</v>

1155
00:51:38.631 --> 00:51:40.310
<v Speaker 2>But it was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those were the years,</v>

1156
00:51:40.311 --> 00:51:41.340
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1157
00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:43.880
<v Speaker 2>The first fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first this like that.</v>

1158
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:47.150
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what makes you like so,</v>

1159
00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.680
<v Speaker 2>and that stuck with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1160
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:52.280
<v Speaker 2>At 21 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's stuck with me and realize that</v>

1161
00:51:52.281 --> 00:51:52.641
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1162
00:51:52.641 --> 00:51:57.140
<v Speaker 2>I got to enjoy the process and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>really never rubbed off on me in front</v>

1163
00:51:57.141 --> 00:51:57.310
<v Speaker 2>of me.</v>

1164
00:51:57.310 --> 00:51:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why didn't that guy,</v>

1165
00:51:59.541 --> 00:52:01.790

<v Speaker 2>let's see,</v>

1167
00:52:02.841 --> 00:52:06.750
<v Speaker 2>he must have been his sixties when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>just do shit to a bunch of shoot day</v>

1168
00:52:06.751 --> 00:52:08.200
<v Speaker 2>lounging around his fucking swimming</v>
<v Speaker 2>pool.</v>

1169
00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Did he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had an amazing man.</v>

1170
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:11.690
<v Speaker 2>He was 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had an amazing life.</v>

1171
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:14.810
<v Speaker 2>He had an amazing life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what did you wind up doing?</v>

1172
00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said the SEC,</v>

1173
00:52:17.241 --> 00:52:18.950
<v Speaker 2>the second part of that conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1174
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:19.820
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1175
00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:22.670
<v Speaker 2>will you make this work on your own?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1176
00:52:22.671 --> 00:52:23.960
<v Speaker 2>I think I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1177
00:52:23.961 --> 00:52:26.230
<v Speaker 2>I didn't ask you if you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1178
00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:27.143
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1179
00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:30.050
<v Speaker 2>will you make it work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1180
00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:31.400
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1181
00:52:31.401 --> 00:52:35.480
<v Speaker 2>and then go tell the guy to fuck off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it and it goes and go make it work.</v>

1182
00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:36.803
<v Speaker 2>And I did.</v>

1183
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:40.190
<v Speaker 2>So how'd you get it funded that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1184
00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:44.180
<v Speaker 2>I somehow got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the Dallas Mavericks after the</v>

1185
00:52:44.181 --> 00:52:49.181
<v Speaker 2>Knicks and told them that I convinced</v>
<v Speaker 2>them to give me a $2,500 the next pay</v>

1186
00:52:50.131 --> 00:52:52.190
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the crazy part of my life,</v>

1187
00:52:52.191 --> 00:52:56.480
<v Speaker 2>but they gave me $2,500 to do the demo</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they bought the song for like</v>

1188
00:52:56.481 --> 00:53:00.680
<v Speaker 2>$20,000 and that funded the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>business that I ultimately sold to a</v>

1189
00:53:00.681 --> 00:53:03.020
<v Speaker 2>public company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1190
00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:06.140
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you almost gave away 10% of your</v>

1191
00:53:06.141 --> 00:53:09.260
<v Speaker 2>whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy wanted 10% is a piece of shit.</v>

1192
00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:12.320
<v Speaker 2>What a mother fucker like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

1193
00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:16.670
<v Speaker 2>it's just business drives prisoners and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no one to go to,</v>

1194
00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:21.230
<v Speaker 2>but I know he's taken advantage of a 21</v>
<v Speaker 2>year old kid who's just got some dreams</v>

1195
00:53:21.231 --> 00:53:24.350
<v Speaker 2>and need some cash and 10 grand to hims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably nothing.</v>

1196
00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 2>I called my father and my father</v>

1197
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.910
<v Speaker 1>owned the plumbing supply house in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mineola Long Island and I during this</v>

1198
00:53:29.911 --> 00:53:32.100
<v Speaker 1>time in my thing and my father said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1199
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:35.160
<v Speaker 1>I love him to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>

1200
00:53:35.161 --> 00:53:36.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

1201
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Do what you think is best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just didn't,</v>

1202
00:53:39.601 --> 00:53:41.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know who to turn to.</v>

1203
00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:42.810
<v Speaker 1>I had no one to turn to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1204
00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.300
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't give up 10% of your life.</v>

1205
00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was just crazy that someone asks</v>

1206
00:53:48.151 --> 00:53:49.920
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you hear things like,</v>

1207
00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is similar to what they do in the</v>

1208
00:53:51.451 --> 00:53:54.330
<v Speaker 1>music business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how the music business treats</v>

1209
00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:56.640
<v Speaker 1>artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They essentially sign you to these</v>

1210
00:53:56.641 --> 00:53:59.580
<v Speaker 1>contracts and then take a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1211
00:53:59.581 --> 00:54:01.590
<v Speaker 1>They take a piece of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do a movie,</v>

1212
00:54:01.591 --> 00:54:04.740
<v Speaker 1>they take a piece of your live</v>
<v Speaker 1>performances,</v>

1213
00:54:04.741 --> 00:54:07.230
<v Speaker 1>your merchandise sales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1214
00:54:07.231 --> 00:54:07.921
<v Speaker 1>They just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1215
00:54:07.921 --> 00:54:09.960
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll help you out a little bit,</v>

1216
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.150
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want you,</v>

1217
00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:13.313
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1218
00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean at least you're in a contract</v>

1219
00:54:15.451 --> 00:54:18.060
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's some creepy contracts that</v>

1220
00:54:18.061 --> 00:54:20.610
<v Speaker 1>they used to do in the old days of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood that were similar to that.</v>

1221
00:54:20.611 --> 00:54:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just take a pcf forever.</v>

1222
00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1223
00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I signed my music deal,</v>

1224
00:54:26.131 --> 00:54:27.330
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1225
00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.590
<v Speaker 1>you can take whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1226
00:54:28.591 --> 00:54:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Get me on MTV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1227
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:30.691
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1228
00:54:30.691 --> 00:54:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Cause did all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1229
00:54:31.591 --> 00:54:35.130
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole idea there were the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why these exploitation contracts</v>

1230
00:54:35.131 --> 00:54:38.790
<v Speaker 1>work is because in the beginning you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so desperate and what you have is</v>

1231
00:54:38.791 --> 00:54:40.950
<v Speaker 1>what they don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have talent,</v>

1232
00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:42.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>

1233
00:54:42.241 --> 00:54:45.930
<v Speaker 1>as you're creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're young and full of energy and</v>

1234
00:54:45.931 --> 00:54:48.240
<v Speaker 1>you've got something exciting that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to look at.</v>

1235
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:50.400
<v Speaker 1>And so what they do is they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1236
00:54:50.401 --> 00:54:51.750
<v Speaker 1>you will look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we gotta fucking,</v>

1237
00:54:51.751 --> 00:54:54.660
<v Speaker 1>we got to wade through the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we want 75% of the profits.</v>

1238
00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:57.330
<v Speaker 1>We want a little bit of this and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't get any money back until</v>

1239
00:54:57.331 --> 00:55:02.331
<v Speaker 1>we recoup our money that we spent on</v>
<v Speaker 1>executives and parking and car leases</v>

1240
00:55:03.781 --> 00:55:07.320
<v Speaker 1>and they calculate all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much the fucking building costs,</v>

1241
00:55:07.321 --> 00:55:09.540
<v Speaker 1>how much the electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>

1242
00:55:09.541 --> 00:55:11.460
<v Speaker 1>They cow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've seen those,</v>

1243
00:55:11.461 --> 00:55:12.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

1244
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Contracts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking sign them.</v>

1245
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I've sat in on my own way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1246
00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.710
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1247
00:55:19.711 --> 00:55:22.710
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the process and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>leverage,</v>

1248
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:24.270
<v Speaker 1>no leverage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

1249
00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:27.000
<v Speaker 1>They've got the leverage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now and now they don't have</v>

1250
00:55:27.001 --> 00:55:29.370
<v Speaker 1>delivered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they still figure out a way to pull</v>

1251
00:55:29.371 --> 00:55:31.770
<v Speaker 1>it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird because who the fuck</v>

1252
00:55:31.771 --> 00:55:34.060
<v Speaker 1>is buying an albums now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>

1253
00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:35.340
<v Speaker 1>no one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1254
00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:38.550
<v Speaker 1>Yet these record companies are still</v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how to cling on,</v>

1255
00:55:38.551 --> 00:55:41.370
<v Speaker 1>do you like a lamprey?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suck blood out.</v>

1256
00:55:42.810 --> 00:55:47.810
<v Speaker 1>There's still staying alive and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat fingers driving their fat Mercedes</v>

1257
00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Benz.</v>

1258
00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:51.300
<v Speaker 1>They know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just figured out a way to grab</v>

1259
00:55:51.301 --> 00:55:54.480
<v Speaker 1>people that are just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just getting poppin,</v>

1260
00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:57.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just sign it and then figured out a</v>

1261
00:55:57.421 --> 00:56:00.300
<v Speaker 1>way to get in with these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>streaming companies.</v>

1262
00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.520
<v Speaker 1>If you paid attention to that shit a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

1263
00:56:02.521 --> 00:56:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the darkest.</v>

1264
00:56:05.401 --> 00:56:09.060
<v Speaker 1>It's even darker than the music</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution because the artists get</v>

1265
00:56:09.061 --> 00:56:12.100
<v Speaker 1>like no money point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1266
00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Steven Tyler was talking about it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1267
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:17.380
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was explaining it and there's a,</v>

1268
00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:18.900
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the company's actually,</v>

1269
00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:21.990
<v Speaker 1>or the organization is actually called m</v>
<v Speaker 1>m a what is it?</v>

1270
00:56:21.991 --> 00:56:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did it stand for?</v>

1271
00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Musicians for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1272
00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:30.640
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of an act where they're,</v>

1273
00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:33.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to stop these streaming companies</v>

1274
00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:37.600
<v Speaker 1>from ripping off these artists' music</v>
<v Speaker 1>modernization act.</v>

1275
00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dark.</v>

1276
00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's along the same lines.</v>

1277
00:56:41.741 --> 00:56:46.741
<v Speaker 1>It's like people figuring out a way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>just take something from somebody</v>

1278
00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:49.510
<v Speaker 1>because you need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1279
00:56:49.511 --> 00:56:51.070
<v Speaker 1>you're broke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're desperate.</v>

1280
00:56:51.071 --> 00:56:51.400
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1281
00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:52.730
<v Speaker 1>you signed a contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1282
00:56:52.731 --> 00:56:56.920
<v Speaker 1>we've got to by contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as they then music that was</v>

1283
00:56:56.921 --> 00:56:59.680
<v Speaker 1>invented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how they put led Zepplin on the</v>

1284
00:56:59.681 --> 00:57:01.090
<v Speaker 1>streaming service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1285
00:57:01.091 --> 00:57:01.924
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1286
00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:04.970
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no streaming when that this</v>

1287
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:06.850
<v Speaker 1>should be a whole new contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1288
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:10.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true with audio books too,</v>

1289
00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:11.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1290
00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:14.950
<v Speaker 2>even bucks now and all these old</v>
<v Speaker 2>publications,</v>

1291
00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:16.930
<v Speaker 2>they never envisioned that there would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

1292
00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:20.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ebooks and audio books and all these</v>

1293
00:57:20.741 --> 00:57:25.120
<v Speaker 2>different distribution areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that audio books</v>

1294
00:57:25.121 --> 00:57:27.280
<v Speaker 2>probably mirror the sales of regular</v>

1295
00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:28.590
<v Speaker 1>books now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1296
00:57:28.591 --> 00:57:29.220
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1297
00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:34.220
<v Speaker 1>at least in my circle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know so many people who just use audio</v>

1298
00:57:34.261 --> 00:57:36.540
<v Speaker 1>books and they hardly ever hardly ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>

1299
00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:40.200
<v Speaker 1>And what they've essentially done is</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken that commuter time that was just</v>

1300
00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.140
<v Speaker 2>dead air and filled it up with books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

1301
00:57:43.141 --> 00:57:43.680
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

1302
00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.510
<v Speaker 2>when seal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I put it the seal book,</v>

1303
00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:49.680
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe how many people hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>me about the audio because I did my own</v>

1304
00:57:49.681 --> 00:57:54.030
<v Speaker 2>audio book and I just couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even hear was that came out two</v>

1305
00:57:54.031 --> 00:57:55.530
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1306
00:57:55.860 --> 00:58:00.660
<v Speaker 2>And it just never dawned on me that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people even listen to audio books when</v>

1307
00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.360
<v Speaker 2>it may be angry that I did the read so</v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>

1308
00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:05.220
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should have invested a little bit more</v>

1309
00:58:05.221 --> 00:58:07.830
<v Speaker 2>time like gotten a coach or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1310
00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:09.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like read it.</v>

1311
00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:13.980
<v Speaker 2>What percentage of your books were audio</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus paper?</v>

1312
00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:15.810
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1313
00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:20.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna Guess about 30% 30 to 40 maybe</v>

1314
00:58:20.911 --> 00:58:24.180
<v Speaker 2>40 30 40%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's closing in closing in on 50</v>

1315
00:58:25.110 --> 00:58:27.060
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people can now speed it up a little bit</v>

1316
00:58:27.061 --> 00:58:29.270
<v Speaker 2>so they can get through it quicker and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do it when they're,</v>

1317
00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:31.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do that with podcasts,</v>

1318
00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:32.780
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So listeners when frankly,</v>

1319
00:58:32.781 --> 00:58:35.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lola do listen to us right now.</v>

1320
00:58:35.191 --> 00:58:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Like we're on speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1321
00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:40.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you are done with this book</v>

1322
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:42.300
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1323
00:58:42.330 --> 00:58:45.760
<v Speaker 1>you get back from this monk thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1324
00:58:45.761 --> 00:58:49.740
<v Speaker 1>you realize that this is made like some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a fundamental shift in the way</v>

1325
00:58:49.741 --> 00:58:52.530
<v Speaker 1>you live your life and you put this book</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1326
00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Is there a real sense that people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>read this book are going to get that</v>

1327
00:58:56.611 --> 00:58:57.660
<v Speaker 1>from you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1328
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:59.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you aware that you're probably going</v>

1329
00:58:59.491 --> 00:59:01.620
<v Speaker 1>to change the way a lot of people live</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives?</v>

1330
00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:03.051
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1331
00:59:03.051 --> 00:59:05.510
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they'll change the lies,</v>

1332
00:59:05.511 --> 00:59:06.650
<v Speaker 2>but I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope,</v>

1333
00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:10.910
<v Speaker 2>I hope that it helps them look through</v>
<v Speaker 2>things through a different Lens,</v>

1334
00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:12.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1335
00:59:12.321 --> 00:59:14.220
<v Speaker 2>make their own decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1336
00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:18.320
<v Speaker 2>one of the takeaways from the book isn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much a specific around the monastery.</v>

1337
00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:21.110
<v Speaker 2>It's around this notion of building your</v>
<v Speaker 2>life resume,</v>

1338
00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:23.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just stepping into the unknown.</v>

1339
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:24.343
<v Speaker 2>Because to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1340
00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:26.190
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where I learned the best thing</v>

1341
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:29.480
<v Speaker 2>you could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could get a traditional coach or go to</v>

1342
00:59:29.481 --> 00:59:31.730
<v Speaker 2>seminars or experts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just don't learn.</v>

1343
00:59:31.731 --> 00:59:34.720
<v Speaker 2>I learned by going into the unknown and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope it just,</v>

1344
00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:38.000
<v Speaker 2>it just motivates people to have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit more urgency and do stuff</v>

1345
00:59:38.001 --> 00:59:40.850
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to go to a monastery,</v>

1346
00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:44.870
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an old Japanese ritual,</v>

1347
00:59:44.871 --> 00:59:46.310
<v Speaker 2>you might be familiar with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1348
00:59:46.311 --> 00:59:47.270
<v Speaker 2>called the Ms Sogi.</v>

1349
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:52.220
<v Speaker 2>And the thought around them is Sogi is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was introduced to me by Kyle Korver</v>

1350
00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:54.260
<v Speaker 2>played at the hawks for the Atlanta</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hawks.</v>

1351
00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:56.120
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1352
00:59:56.121 --> 01:00:01.121
<v Speaker 2>the notion around the Muskogee is you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something so hard one time a year that</v>

1353
01:00:02.001 --> 01:00:07.001
<v Speaker 2>it has an impact the other 364 days of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the year on you that you go so far</v>

1354
01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:09.380
<v Speaker 2>beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1355
01:00:09.381 --> 01:00:11.150
<v Speaker 2>for me that was my hundred mile run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1356
01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:16.100
<v Speaker 2>I can look back since 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had moments like that every year,</v>

1357
01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:18.370
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

1358
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:22.640
<v Speaker 2>and I believe in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in that and um,</v>

1359
01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.370
<v Speaker 2>in the widest brought that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1360
01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:26.690
<v Speaker 2>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1361
01:00:26.691 --> 01:00:29.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's just kind of one of the themes</v>

1362
01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:32.840
<v Speaker 2>around this urgency and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1363
01:00:32.841 --> 01:00:34.310
<v Speaker 2>creating memories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

1364
01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's things like that sort of</v>

1365
01:00:36.851 --> 01:00:41.630
<v Speaker 2>highlight that urgency that if you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>live your life like at the same steady</v>

1366
01:00:41.631 --> 01:00:46.631
<v Speaker 2>static pace and maybe sometimes you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't feel it as much,</v>

1367
01:00:46.641 --> 01:00:49.940
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm sure after you did your hundred</v>

1368
01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:51.920
<v Speaker 2>mile run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when it was over,</v>

1369
01:00:51.921 --> 01:00:55.040
<v Speaker 2>you probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably felt so good to relax.</v>

1370
01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well first of all,</v>

1371
01:00:56.871 --> 01:00:58.580
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1372
01:00:59.210 --> 01:01:03.680
<v Speaker 2>the pressure around completing the run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I did the run,</v>

1373
01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:09.110
<v Speaker 2>I raised millions of dollars for charity</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone in my world knew I was</v>

1374
01:01:10.071 --> 01:01:12.470
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave myself 90 days to train for.</v>

1375
01:01:12.471 --> 01:01:16.850
<v Speaker 2>It isn't what's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say like for the people in the</v>

1376
01:01:16.851 --> 01:01:19.130
<v Speaker 2>shape that I was in going into it</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a year,</v>

1377
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:20.300
<v Speaker 2>eight months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six months.</v>

1378
01:01:20.301 --> 01:01:21.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1379
01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:24.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean I gave myself 90 days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started in August and the,</v>

1380
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:29.530
<v Speaker 2>the race was 90 days later and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone in my world was donating or</v>

1381
01:01:31.341 --> 01:01:34.670
<v Speaker 2>involved or knew about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I didn't finish it,</v>

1382
01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:37.280
<v Speaker 2>so much can go wrong in a hundred mile</v>
<v Speaker 2>run.</v>

1383
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:39.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if something goes wrong in a</v>

1384
01:01:39.291 --> 01:01:41.240
<v Speaker 2>marathon at mile 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got it out.</v>

1385
01:01:41.241 --> 01:01:43.040
<v Speaker 2>You've got seven more miles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1386
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:46.400
<v Speaker 2>something goes wrong at Mile 1981 miles</v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

1387
01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.830
<v Speaker 2>You can't gut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people can't cut that out.</v>

1388
01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:53.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt so relieved when it was done</v>

1389
01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:54.920
<v Speaker 2>because I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1390
01:01:54.921 --> 01:01:57.500
<v Speaker 2>I did it and no one can take it away</v>
<v Speaker 2>from me.</v>

1391
01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:00.800
<v Speaker 2>What was the longest you would root rote</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not written?</v>

1392
01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ran before that I ran two 50s,</v>

1393
01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.170
<v Speaker 2>two fifties to 50 milers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1394
01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:09.170
<v Speaker 2>I never did miles at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I did two 10 hour,</v>

1395
01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:13.820
<v Speaker 2>10 hour runs twice and 50 miles in those</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 hours probably around there,</v>

1396
01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:14.923
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1397
01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:19.830
<v Speaker 2>but you knew that you were at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>halfway mark roughly and you could push</v>

1398
01:02:19.831 --> 01:02:22.710
<v Speaker 2>through the rest?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew that if I got to 50 mile,</v>

1399
01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:24.220
<v Speaker 2>if I could get to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1400
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:28.650
<v Speaker 2>50 miles and 10 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could basically even injured walk the</v>

1401
01:02:28.651 --> 01:02:30.450
<v Speaker 2>rest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the allocated time.</v>

1402
01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.100
<v Speaker 2>Now after that was over and after he did</v>
<v Speaker 2>do the 100 miles,</v>

1403
01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:40.440
<v Speaker 2>how much of a shift did that make in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way you thought about time and effort?</v>

1404
01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:45.800
<v Speaker 2>Totally changed my life completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely talking about this Miss Sogi,</v>

1405
01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:51.810
<v Speaker 2>it completely changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was in 2006.</v>

1406
01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:56.811
<v Speaker 2>I think that I did the run and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely changed my life because when</v>

1407
01:02:57.481 --> 01:03:01.140
<v Speaker 2>I started running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my goal was to run two miles.</v>

1408
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.740
<v Speaker 2>If I could run two miles in 18 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine minute pace,</v>

1409
01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:08.220
<v Speaker 2>I consider myself a runner and I work</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards that goal.</v>

1410
01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:09.420
<v Speaker 2>Like out of college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1411
01:03:09.421 --> 01:03:11.400
<v Speaker 2>just got out of college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to run two miles,</v>

1412
01:03:11.401 --> 01:03:13.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it took me a little to get there in</v>

1413
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:17.070
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] nine minute pace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1414
01:03:17.850 --> 01:03:21.570
<v Speaker 2>fast forward I ran this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing in my body changed,</v>

1415
01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.590
<v Speaker 2>does the same legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God gave me same lugs God gave me.</v>

1416
01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:27.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm not very strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing's changed.</v>

1417
01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:33.170
<v Speaker 2>But I took that two mile body and ran a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred miles and I bet almost a lot of</v>

1418
01:03:34.831 --> 01:03:38.310
<v Speaker 2>people that are listening this could run</v>
<v Speaker 2>two miles and with a gun to their head,</v>

1419
01:03:38.311 --> 01:03:40.050
<v Speaker 2>they could run two miles that they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1420
01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:45.590
<v Speaker 2>And the only thing that changed was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way I perceive what I thought I could do</v>

1421
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:50.190
<v Speaker 2>in this run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I realized after the race that Holy</v>

1422
01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:51.750
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did 50 acts,</v>

1423
01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:57.140
<v Speaker 2>what my initial goal was like I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>under indexing 50 x in this category of</v>

1424
01:03:58.771 --> 01:04:01.290
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the areas of my life,</v>

1425
01:04:01.291 --> 01:04:03.120
<v Speaker 2>Jesse?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What other areas of your life,</v>

1426
01:04:03.121 --> 01:04:05.970
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you under indexing in like,</v>

1427
01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:09.060
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a sales quota at Marquis jet,</v>

1428
01:04:09.061 --> 01:04:13.320
<v Speaker 2>my company was 20 jet cards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that cause I knew I could get it and</v>

1429
01:04:13.321 --> 01:04:16.170
<v Speaker 2>it was comfortable or should I be like</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm putting you on the board for 40</v>

1430
01:04:16.171 --> 01:04:18.480
<v Speaker 2>fellows this month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me see what the fuck I can do.</v>

1431
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:21.390
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was living in this like comfort.</v>

1432
01:04:21.391 --> 01:04:25.920
<v Speaker 2>I was going through life like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>routine and routines are great,</v>

1433
01:04:25.921 --> 01:04:27.450
<v Speaker 2>but routines can also be a Rut.</v>

1434
01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:30.360
<v Speaker 2>You can't get better in a routine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you get,</v>

1435
01:04:30.361 --> 01:04:32.520
<v Speaker 2>so when you're in a routine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>time goes fast.</v>

1436
01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:35.220
<v Speaker 2>When you're adding your routine time go</v>
<v Speaker 2>slow.</v>

1437
01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:37.710
<v Speaker 2>So I was so comfortable in my routine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1438
01:04:37.711 --> 01:04:38.250
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

1439
01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:39.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go through life like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1440
01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.150
<v Speaker 2>I want to go through life like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1441
01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:43.970
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were listening.</v>

1442
01:04:43.971 --> 01:04:45.490
<v Speaker 2>You were going up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to host.</v>

1443
01:04:45.491 --> 01:04:46.410
<v Speaker 2>People are listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1444
01:04:46.411 --> 01:04:48.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm scrolling fun.</v>

1445
01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:50.550
<v Speaker 2>I'll do this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just locked.</v>

1446
01:04:50.551 --> 01:04:51.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know where people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening.</v>

1447
01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:53.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm locked into you.</v>

1448
01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.660
<v Speaker 2>I was going flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1449
01:04:54.661 --> 01:04:59.640
<v Speaker 2>I was just doing the same shit and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>want a nice 45 degree upward angle.</v>

1450
01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:00.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>

1451
01:05:00.391 --> 01:05:01.620
<v Speaker 2>this run showed me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1452
01:05:01.621 --> 01:05:05.340
<v Speaker 2>I was under indexing so much what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought I was capable of and it made me</v>

1453
01:05:05.341 --> 01:05:07.800
<v Speaker 2>think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what else am I capable of?</v>

1454
01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:10.260
<v Speaker 2>What about recovery?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what was it like when you were</v>

1455
01:05:10.261 --> 01:05:12.630
<v Speaker 2>done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1456
01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:18.020
<v Speaker 2>at Mile 94 I realized I had toenails in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my show.</v>

1457
01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:24.240
<v Speaker 2>So that was an uncomfortable feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I felt them felting rattle</v>

1458
01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:29.280
<v Speaker 2>around and when I took my shoes off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my feet were so fucked up.</v>

1459
01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:33.310
<v Speaker 2>Is it because your feet swell while</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're running and you,</v>

1460
01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.060
<v Speaker 2>if you have like a size 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to swap out to a size 11</v>

1461
01:05:37.061 --> 01:05:38.140
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what works.</v>

1462
01:05:38.290 --> 01:05:39.850
<v Speaker 2>I swapped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to size up,</v>

1463
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.920
<v Speaker 2>but I blisters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bad blisters.</v>

1464
01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:46.950
<v Speaker 2>My blisters were really bad and bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you ran or I got them as I was</v>

1465
01:05:47.831 --> 01:05:52.630
<v Speaker 2>going and they look like it literally</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked like I had swallowed red grapes</v>

1466
01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:54.550
<v Speaker 2>and they went to the bottom of each of</v>
<v Speaker 2>my toe.</v>

1467
01:05:54.610 --> 01:05:57.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just so I was in a wheelchair for</v>

1468
01:05:57.281 --> 01:06:00.600
<v Speaker 2>four days after the race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four days just because of the bottom of</v>

1469
01:06:00.601 --> 01:06:03.910
<v Speaker 2>the blisters and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1470
01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.790
<v Speaker 2>but so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

1471
01:06:06.791 --> 01:06:08.410
<v Speaker 2>it just like a regular guy.</v>

1472
01:06:08.830 --> 01:06:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1473
01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.180
<v Speaker 2>it was a very powerful moment for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1474
01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:14.560
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was worth,</v>

1475
01:06:14.590 --> 01:06:16.600
<v Speaker 2>it was worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all well,</v>

1476
01:06:16.601 --> 01:06:17.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well worth it.</v>

1477
01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Once I was done and I realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay,</v>

1478
01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:22.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in shock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not dehydrated.</v>

1479
01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:24.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm just in super pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1480
01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:28.480
<v Speaker 2>that was a great moment and I have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>regret from that race.</v>

1481
01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the biggest regrets in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1482
01:06:30.221 --> 01:06:32.320
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't like the way I finished the</v>
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>

1483
01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:37.720
<v Speaker 2>I ran 99 miles the last mile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took me 48 minutes and literally had to</v>

1484
01:06:37.721 --> 01:06:41.320
<v Speaker 2>like grab my shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brothers shoulders and like I just,</v>

1485
01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:44.020
<v Speaker 2>if I could do it all over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to really finish that like a</v>

1486
01:06:44.021 --> 01:06:45.610
<v Speaker 2>champion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1487
01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:48.550
<v Speaker 2>And I was just very disappointed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very happy about it.</v>

1488
01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.490
<v Speaker 2>But I also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my biggest regrets from the race</v>

1489
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:52.810
<v Speaker 2>is just that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1490
01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:56.590
<v Speaker 2>I got to that moment where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just didn't finish it the way I</v>

1491
01:06:56.591 --> 01:06:58.030
<v Speaker 2>wanted to finish it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was wrong?</v>

1492
01:06:58.850 --> 01:07:02.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my fucking joints like my hips and my</v>

1493
01:07:02.111 --> 01:07:07.111
<v Speaker 2>knees were just like swollen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so much,</v>

1494
01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:10.180
<v Speaker 2>just so much pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were just,</v>

1495
01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:14.740
<v Speaker 2>it was just so at 75 I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just kind of like was running and then</v>

1496
01:07:14.741 --> 01:07:18.440
<v Speaker 2>all a sudden I was on the ground because</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I just buckled because it was,</v>

1497
01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.380
<v Speaker 2>it was my joints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not my muscles,</v>

1498
01:07:20.381 --> 01:07:21.870
<v Speaker 2>just like my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1499
01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:22.691
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

1500
01:07:22.691 --> 01:07:25.840
<v Speaker 2>if you roll your thumb around for 24</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>

1501
01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:27.960
<v Speaker 2>your thumb's gonna fall off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1502
01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:30.010
<v Speaker 2>it's this the stop motion and pounding</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1503
01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.140
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't know what I was wearing</v>

1504
01:07:32.141 --> 01:07:33.100
<v Speaker 2>cotton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1505
01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.550
<v Speaker 2>I did everything wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1506
01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:35.913
<v Speaker 2>but I did it.</v>

1507
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:41.770
<v Speaker 2>And when you did get done with that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wheelchair for four days,</v>

1508
01:07:41.771 --> 01:07:44.140
<v Speaker 2>how long did it take before your body</v>
<v Speaker 2>felt normal?</v>

1509
01:07:44.141 --> 01:07:49.141
<v Speaker 2>Like your joints normalized your hips</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your knees and took about two over a</v>

1510
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:51.520
<v Speaker 2>little over two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1511
01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just hobbling around for two</v>

1512
01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:57.760
<v Speaker 2>weeks thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still impacted by it really?</v>

1513
01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:01.030
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a huge cyst,</v>

1514
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:04.270
<v Speaker 2>like from all the stress on my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my foot that,</v>

1515
01:08:04.570 --> 01:08:08.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had like a ham sized,</v>

1516
01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:09.520
<v Speaker 2>when you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1517
01:08:09.521 --> 01:08:10.350
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're holding.</v>

1518
01:08:10.350 --> 01:08:14.170
<v Speaker 2>You see like you have a skull on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how big was it?</v>

1519
01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 2>Like big enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't wear shoes.</v>

1520
01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.440
<v Speaker 2>Why don't I wear sneakers that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1521
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:20.150
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you a picture.</v>

1522
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:24.440
<v Speaker 2>I got a drain twice and then I went to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a real,</v>

1523
01:08:24.441 --> 01:08:26.570
<v Speaker 2>like a almost fruitarian diet and went</v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

1524
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:30.350
<v Speaker 2>Fruitarians just all fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did that do it?</v>

1525
01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:32.750
<v Speaker 2>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1526
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.930
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1527
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:37.370
<v Speaker 2>I used to try fruits with vegetables or</v>
<v Speaker 2>fruits with anything else.</v>

1528
01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:41.120
<v Speaker 2>So for 27 years I've only had fruit till</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 o'clock noon.</v>

1529
01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:46.360
<v Speaker 2>That's all I eat in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I extended that out further and it</v>

1530
01:08:46.971 --> 01:08:50.150
<v Speaker 2>went away on its own from fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's the reason.</v>

1531
01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:53.600
<v Speaker 2>Maybe over a month just went away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1532
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:56.120
<v Speaker 2>but I made some significant changes in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my diet.</v>

1533
01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:58.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

1534
01:08:58.791 --> 01:09:01.730
<v Speaker 2>but what led you to be the fruitarian</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea?</v>

1535
01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:04.880
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read a book called fit for life when I</v>

1536
01:09:04.881 --> 01:09:06.020
<v Speaker 2>was 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1537
01:09:06.021 --> 01:09:08.630
<v Speaker 2>For my first marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 21 or 22 years old.</v>

1538
01:09:08.631 --> 01:09:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Like looking for an edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the book it challenges the reader</v>

1539
01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:14.660
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1540
01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:17.360
<v Speaker 2>try to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the principles of the book is to</v>

1541
01:09:17.361 --> 01:09:19.460
<v Speaker 2>only fruit until noon and we can talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>

1542
01:09:19.461 --> 01:09:20.294
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1543
01:09:20.330 --> 01:09:23.230
<v Speaker 2>it challenges the reader to try it for</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 days and then day 11,</v>

1544
01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.400
<v Speaker 2>go back to regular breakfast and see how</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel.</v>

1545
01:09:25.730 --> 01:09:28.370
<v Speaker 2>So I did like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can invest 10 days to try this.</v>

1546
01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:31.490
<v Speaker 2>And on day 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went back to oatmeal and toast or</v>

1547
01:09:31.491 --> 01:09:33.740
<v Speaker 2>whatever and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1548
01:09:33.741 --> 01:09:37.460
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt so sluggish and like bloated and</v>

1549
01:09:37.461 --> 01:09:39.110
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never went back.</v>

1550
01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:40.760
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

1551
01:09:40.770 --> 01:09:43.610
<v Speaker 2>that's unwavering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm unwavering on that.</v>

1552
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:47.450
<v Speaker 2>I've run marathon and never changes</v>
<v Speaker 2>fruit until noon.</v>

1553
01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:52.790
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's why now what are these people</v>

1554
01:09:52.791 --> 01:09:56.720
<v Speaker 2>eat in the monastery?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have a very light breakfast that</v>

1555
01:09:56.721 --> 01:09:57.554
<v Speaker 2>suited me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1556
01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:00.410
<v Speaker 2>they have fruit in the morning and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>their lunch,</v>

1557
01:10:00.411 --> 01:10:02.060
<v Speaker 2>they called dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's their big meal.</v>

1558
01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:06.350
<v Speaker 2>So the afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>noon meal was sup is like dinner and</v>

1559
01:10:06.351 --> 01:10:09.610
<v Speaker 2>then at night it was super light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like soup and salad or whatever it is</v>

1560
01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:12.170
<v Speaker 2>really like almost one meal a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they vegetarian?</v>

1561
01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.161
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere,</v>

1562
01:10:13.161 --> 01:10:15.470
<v Speaker 2>but others weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interest.</v>

1563
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:16.930
<v Speaker 2>Not all of them were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>

1564
01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:19.100
<v Speaker 2>which was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you expect them to be?</v>

1565
01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.220
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost a lot of weight there.</v>

1566
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:24.320
<v Speaker 2>I lost like 17 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>

1567
01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:25.110
<v Speaker 2>17 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1568
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1569
01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Why so what do you think it's lack of</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar?</v>

1570
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:30.830
<v Speaker 2>No carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lack of sugar.</v>

1571
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:34.400
<v Speaker 2>One meal a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't eat any bread or they did.</v>

1572
01:10:34.401 --> 01:10:38.900
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to put a little asterisk next</v>

1573
01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:39.560
<v Speaker 2>to my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

1574
01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:42.020
<v Speaker 2>I went in there saying to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to have,</v>

1575
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:45.980
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to come back clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I really try not to have any grains.</v>

1576
01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.050
<v Speaker 2>And I did have some grains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not,</v>

1577
01:10:48.051 --> 01:10:49.700
<v Speaker 2>not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I walked a lot.</v>

1578
01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:53.570
<v Speaker 2>I walked 120 miles over the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the time I was there up and down</v>

1579
01:10:53.571 --> 01:10:55.530
<v Speaker 2>the driveway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1580
01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:57.050
<v Speaker 2>so I lost a lot of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of weight.</v>

1581
01:10:57.950 --> 01:11:00.290
<v Speaker 2>I gained it all back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the time,</v>

1582
01:11:00.291 --> 01:11:03.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now these people that live this life,</v>

1583
01:11:04.190 --> 01:11:06.950
<v Speaker 2>do they have something they're working</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards?</v>

1584
01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:09.200
<v Speaker 2>Do they have an idea that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>working towards?</v>

1585
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Does it mean when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you press them on it and ask them</v>

1586
01:11:11.841 --> 01:11:12.531
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you here?</v>

1587
01:11:12.531 --> 01:11:15.240
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever plan on leaving?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever see yourself going somewhere</v>

1588
01:11:15.241 --> 01:11:16.620
<v Speaker 2>else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a really good question.</v>

1589
01:11:16.621 --> 01:11:18.210
<v Speaker 2>I asked them all those questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1590
01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:19.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1591
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:22.350
<v Speaker 2>They felt like that was their calling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their calling.</v>

1592
01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:27.180
<v Speaker 2>They were doing what they were supposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be doing and um,</v>

1593
01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:30.270
<v Speaker 2>that they were committed to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle.</v>

1594
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:31.890
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't,</v>

1595
01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:36.930
<v Speaker 2>there was no thought of going back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There had been monks that have left the</v>

1596
01:11:36.931 --> 01:11:38.940
<v Speaker 2>monastery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just wasn't the right lifestyle for</v>

1597
01:11:38.941 --> 01:11:41.580
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the monks that were there when I was</v>

1598
01:11:41.581 --> 01:11:42.890
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1599
01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:46.530
<v Speaker 2>50 years they were committed and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not going anywhere.</v>

1600
01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:49.770
<v Speaker 2>When you say that's what's confusing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1601
01:11:49.771 --> 01:11:52.380
<v Speaker 2>like I understand that they're enjoying</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I understand that they're,</v>

1602
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:54.540
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they liked that life,</v>

1603
01:11:54.541 --> 01:11:59.520
<v Speaker 2>but that it's a calling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the calling to do nothing or just</v>

1604
01:11:59.521 --> 01:12:04.110
<v Speaker 2>think maybe it's just sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Serve God,</v>

1605
01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:07.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>live a life of purity.</v>

1606
01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:09.600
<v Speaker 2>This is not right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

1607
01:12:09.601 --> 01:12:12.390
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's kind of the mindset</v>

1608
01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:14.250
<v Speaker 2>around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1609
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:17.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>step away from</v>

1610
01:12:18.930 --> 01:12:23.400
<v Speaker 2>the regular life that they were living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting is that they weren't</v>

1611
01:12:23.401 --> 01:12:24.990
<v Speaker 2>born into the monastery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1612
01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:28.500
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these guys made this decision</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their twenties,</v>

1613
01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.790
<v Speaker 2>thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1614
01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:33.150
<v Speaker 2>so what were their jobs before they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all over the board,</v>

1615
01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.460
<v Speaker 2>all over the board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally,</v>

1616
01:12:35.610 --> 01:12:37.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one guy,</v>

1617
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:39.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the most of the lifeguard as a</v>

1618
01:12:39.901 --> 01:12:41.220
<v Speaker 2>teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1619
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:43.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just all over the board.</v>

1620
01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:44.560
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1621
01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:49.050
<v Speaker 2>but regular jobs just always felt</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to God and connected to this</v>

1622
01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:52.110
<v Speaker 2>higher living a life just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1623
01:12:52.650 --> 01:12:53.580
<v Speaker 2>under these terms.</v>

1624
01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:57.840
<v Speaker 2>But what's fascinating to me is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying that there was so happy</v>

1625
01:12:58.050 --> 01:12:59.430
<v Speaker 2>because if you get a rent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1626
01:12:59.431 --> 01:13:01.320
<v Speaker 2>how many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people were in this monastery?</v>

1627
01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight and they're all male.</v>

1628
01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:04.740
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight men.</v>

1629
01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.010
<v Speaker 2>If you get eight random men in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1630
01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:13.100
<v Speaker 2>what's the young stage of the guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>35 35 up to 70 you get eight random 35</v>

1631
01:13:15.211 --> 01:13:17.190
<v Speaker 2>to 70 is now is how many of them are</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy?</v>

1632
01:13:17.490 --> 01:13:20.430
<v Speaker 2>Actually truly happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe too,</v>

1633
01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:23.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people do you think are happy?</v>

1634
01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:25.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just did a study as a famous Harris</v>

1635
01:13:25.561 --> 01:13:30.561
<v Speaker 2>study on happiness in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think 67% of people are unhappy that</v>

1636
01:13:31.081 --> 01:13:33.630
<v Speaker 2>it's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what here I did this jail,</v>

1637
01:13:33.631 --> 01:13:34.860
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a good test.</v>

1638
01:13:34.861 --> 01:13:37.830
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you'll want to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did this when I was speaking at an</v>

1639
01:13:37.831 --> 01:13:42.540
<v Speaker 2>event for 500 Wall Street people</v>
<v Speaker 2>recently and it was fascinating.</v>

1640
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:44.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll take you through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can tell me if you're comfortable</v>

1641
01:13:44.761 --> 01:13:47.010
<v Speaker 2>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you take all the areas of your</v>

1642
01:13:47.011 --> 01:13:49.170
<v Speaker 2>life and put them in a blender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1643
01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.630
<v Speaker 2>so take a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you live,</v>

1644
01:13:51.631 --> 01:13:53.400
<v Speaker 2>your relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your finances,</v>

1645
01:13:53.401 --> 01:13:54.870
<v Speaker 2>your health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

1646
01:13:55.050 --> 01:13:58.200
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put it in one fucking big blender and</v>

1647
01:13:58.201 --> 01:14:01.380
<v Speaker 2>blend it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on a scale of one to 10 with 10</v>

1648
01:14:01.381 --> 01:14:06.381
<v Speaker 2>being the Dalai Lama of happiness and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>one being a guidance at rock was zero</v>

1649
01:14:06.601 --> 01:14:10.200
<v Speaker 2>being some of us at rock bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What your happiness number</v>

1650
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.950
<v Speaker 5>me?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1651
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty fucking happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well I don't know.</v>

1652
01:14:14.711 --> 01:14:17.440
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I definitely wouldn't give it a number.</v>

1653
01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.000
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause I feel like that you're,</v>

1654
01:14:19.001 --> 01:14:21.620
<v Speaker 5>you're making something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1655
01:14:21.621 --> 01:14:23.290
<v Speaker 5>you're turning like</v>

1656
01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:28.810
<v Speaker 5>a constant state of thinking and</v>
<v Speaker 5>expression and consideration.</v>

1657
01:14:31.131 --> 01:14:34.000
<v Speaker 5>You're turning it into a number and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

1658
01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:37.460
<v Speaker 5>I don't like that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like that idea because I think</v>

1659
01:14:37.461 --> 01:14:40.880
<v Speaker 5>it's a management issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of what happiness is a</v>

1660
01:14:40.881 --> 01:14:44.360
<v Speaker 5>management issue and decisions that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're making right now.</v>

1661
01:14:44.361 --> 01:14:46.940
<v Speaker 5>Like you could be in a shit state of</v>
<v Speaker 5>mind right now,</v>

1662
01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:51.860
<v Speaker 5>but you can make some decisions to</v>
<v Speaker 5>adjust that and over the next couple</v>

1663
01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:56.360
<v Speaker 5>hours you'll get to a much better place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And these constant management decisions,</v>

1664
01:14:56.361 --> 01:14:58.820
<v Speaker 5>they waver in and out of your life on a</v>
<v Speaker 5>daily basis.</v>

1665
01:14:58.821 --> 01:15:00.640
<v Speaker 5>Like this idea that you could have a</v>
<v Speaker 5>good mindset,</v>

1666
01:15:00.650 --> 01:15:03.050
<v Speaker 5>then all of a sudden you'll be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's horse shit.</v>

1667
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:06.110
<v Speaker 5>Like it's that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like the tide,</v>

1668
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:09.680
<v Speaker 5>it comes in and it comes out and there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be days where you're just not</v>

1669
01:15:09.681 --> 01:15:13.100
<v Speaker 5>feeling so good physically and that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to affect the way your happiness</v>

1670
01:15:13.101 --> 01:15:15.050
<v Speaker 5>level is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's never static.</v>

1671
01:15:15.051 --> 01:15:16.970
<v Speaker 5>It's never the exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>True.</v>

1672
01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:21.200
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at it overall at 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>feet and you had to give yourself a</v>

1673
01:15:21.201 --> 01:15:23.330
<v Speaker 2>grade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's happy as fuck is what I would say.</v>

1674
01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:25.130
<v Speaker 2>Happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1675
01:15:25.190 --> 01:15:27.920
<v Speaker 2>So I'll take that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take that.</v>

1676
01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:30.170
<v Speaker 2>Most people in that room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1677
01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:32.900
<v Speaker 2>raised there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said if anyone is seven and you know</v>

1678
01:15:33.230 --> 01:15:34.760
<v Speaker 2>for anyone that listening that wants to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it,</v>

1679
01:15:35.810 --> 01:15:37.170
<v Speaker 2>raise your hand if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1680
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:39.950
<v Speaker 2>seven or below.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to put anyone on the spot.</v>

1681
01:15:39.951 --> 01:15:42.130
<v Speaker 2>And majority of the room stood up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1682
01:15:42.230 --> 01:15:45.170
<v Speaker 2>Being a seven and thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know like seven's pretty happy</v>

1683
01:15:45.171 --> 01:15:50.171
<v Speaker 2>number but a seven if my son comes home</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a 70 on a test to see minus.</v>

1684
01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:55.550
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all I'm saying is,</v>

1685
01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:57.440
<v Speaker 2>but what was interesting about the test</v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

1686
01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:00.680
<v Speaker 2>if you do actually go through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>process for those that like go through</v>

1687
01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:02.340
<v Speaker 2>and get a number in their head or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1688
01:16:02.341 --> 01:16:03.830
<v Speaker 2>do you want to give their self a grade?</v>

1689
01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Your brain automatically goes to a 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then subtracts the two or three</v>

1690
01:16:08.661 --> 01:16:11.360
<v Speaker 2>things pop in that make you better bring</v>
<v Speaker 2>you happiness down.</v>

1691
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:15.650
<v Speaker 2>It's a great way to identify what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>making you unhappy and that,</v>

1692
01:16:15.651 --> 01:16:17.630
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it started at 10 you're like,</v>

1693
01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:22.130
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck my relationship or this or that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually it triggers an automatic,</v>

1694
01:16:22.131 --> 01:16:24.560
<v Speaker 2>like this is what's fucked up in my life</v>
<v Speaker 2>response,</v>

1695
01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.960
<v Speaker 2>and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it helps you identify,</v>

1696
01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:30.800
<v Speaker 2>but it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have benchmarks and so many things in</v>

1697
01:16:30.801 --> 01:16:32.330
<v Speaker 2>our life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have an Iq test,</v>

1698
01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:37.340
<v Speaker 2>you have tax brackets to measure your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your wealth or financial statements.</v>

1699
01:16:37.490 --> 01:16:39.140
<v Speaker 2>You have Iq tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

1700
01:16:39.141 --> 01:16:40.910
<v Speaker 2>you can get on a scale to measure your</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight,</v>

1701
01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:43.130
<v Speaker 2>but you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Happiness is one of those things.</v>

1702
01:16:43.131 --> 01:16:46.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like how do you benchmark it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1703
01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.610
<v Speaker 2>It kind of fluctuates.</v>

1704
01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:49.200
<v Speaker 5>It's like hunger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

1705
01:16:49.201 --> 01:16:49.711
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1706
01:16:49.711 --> 01:16:51.630
<v Speaker 5>it's something that's go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it goes in and out.</v>

1707
01:16:51.631 --> 01:16:53.790
<v Speaker 5>It's always there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But happy as fuck is a,</v>

1708
01:16:53.791 --> 01:16:55.440
<v Speaker 5>is a good answer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I,</v>

1709
01:16:55.480 --> 01:17:00.480
<v Speaker 5>this is something I've cultivated for a</v>
<v Speaker 5>long time and avoided things that make</v>

1710
01:17:01.111 --> 01:17:05.520
<v Speaker 5>me unhappy and figured out what those</v>
<v Speaker 5>things are and been very rigid about</v>

1711
01:17:05.521 --> 01:17:09.180
<v Speaker 5>eliminating them from my life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of the big ones is</v>

1712
01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:13.070
<v Speaker 5>interactions with people that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>negative.</v>

1713
01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:15.190
<v Speaker 5>That is gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And B,</v>

1714
01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:20.180
<v Speaker 5>because I realized that I'm not really</v>
<v Speaker 5>as independent as I used to,</v>

1715
01:17:20.181 --> 01:17:22.880
<v Speaker 5>like to think I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to like to think that my thought</v>

1716
01:17:22.881 --> 01:17:26.270
<v Speaker 5>process was independent and that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>give a fuck what anybody thinks.</v>

1717
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:30.560
<v Speaker 5>That's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People say that because they absolutely</v>

1718
01:17:30.561 --> 01:17:32.690
<v Speaker 5>care what people think and it bothers</v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1719
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:34.490
<v Speaker 5>So they say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck,</v>

1720
01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:35.900
<v Speaker 5>but that I don't give a fuck.</v>

1721
01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:40.640
<v Speaker 5>Stuff is almost entirely nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You do care and you care in both ways.</v>

1722
01:17:40.641 --> 01:17:43.820
<v Speaker 5>You care if people critical of you've</v>
<v Speaker 5>care if people are positive you,</v>

1723
01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:49.060
<v Speaker 5>but you also care if people are living</v>
<v Speaker 5>positive lives and they're motivating</v>

1724
01:17:49.161 --> 01:17:50.300
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

1725
01:17:50.301 --> 01:17:53.390
<v Speaker 5>that's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are fuel and other people.</v>

1726
01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:55.280
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the reasons why I like</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking to people.</v>

1727
01:17:55.281 --> 01:17:58.070
<v Speaker 5>One of the reasons why I like to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>podcasts because I get a lot out of,</v>

1728
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:59.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like just talking to you about your time</v>

1729
01:17:59.961 --> 01:18:03.380
<v Speaker 5>in the monastery or you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're pushed to get to that hundred</v>

1730
01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:06.170
<v Speaker 5>miles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you get energy out of people like</v>

1731
01:18:06.171 --> 01:18:10.220
<v Speaker 5>that and you think about this energy and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think about this inspiration when</v>

1732
01:18:10.221 --> 01:18:14.630
<v Speaker 5>you're doing other things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it also sets in your mind that when</v>

1733
01:18:14.631 --> 01:18:16.760
<v Speaker 5>you meet these exceptional people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>move you,</v>

1734
01:18:16.761 --> 01:18:20.330
<v Speaker 5>like what are the characters?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are the qualities that they have?</v>

1735
01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:22.970
<v Speaker 5>What are the characteristics that they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they possess?</v>

1736
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:26.210
<v Speaker 5>And those things become significant and</v>
<v Speaker 5>important to you.</v>

1737
01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:30.620
<v Speaker 5>Whereas if you live around a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that are complaining and bitching</v>

1738
01:18:30.621 --> 01:18:33.560
<v Speaker 5>about everything and they see the</v>
<v Speaker 5>negative in everything and they're</v>

1739
01:18:33.561 --> 01:18:38.210
<v Speaker 5>always whining,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those people are the opposite of that.</v>

1740
01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.240
<v Speaker 5>They're the opposite of inspiration and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

1741
01:18:40.241 --> 01:18:42.890
<v Speaker 5>they're just there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're mud and you're just like,</v>

1742
01:18:42.891 --> 01:18:45.290
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're up to your ankles and</v>

1743
01:18:45.291 --> 01:18:46.820
<v Speaker 5>bud,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you try to trudge through life.</v>

1744
01:18:46.821 --> 01:18:48.380
<v Speaker 5>It's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not light.</v>

1745
01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:50.680
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not pushing it.</v>

1746
01:18:50.681 --> 01:18:53.180
<v Speaker 5>It's not a wind at your back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the winds in your face.</v>

1747
01:18:53.181 --> 01:18:54.740
<v Speaker 5>And it's rough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1748
01:18:54.741 --> 01:18:59.741
<v Speaker 5>And over time I've learned that these</v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

1749
01:19:00.290 --> 01:19:02.240
<v Speaker 5>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to fix him.</v>

1750
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:03.920
<v Speaker 5>I used to want to fix someone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was young,</v>

1751
01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:04.910
<v Speaker 5>I used to want to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

1752
01:19:04.911 --> 01:19:05.744
<v Speaker 5>I see what you're doing.</v>

1753
01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:06.291
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

1754
01:19:06.291 --> 01:19:07.370
<v Speaker 5>don't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>

1755
01:19:07.371 --> 01:19:08.400
<v Speaker 5>just try it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just,</v>

1756
01:19:08.490 --> 01:19:11.780
<v Speaker 5>just do this and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and stop doing that and start doing</v>

1757
01:19:11.781 --> 01:19:13.280
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you just work towards this,</v>

1758
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:16.610
<v Speaker 5>you could be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then a week later the guys doing the</v>

1759
01:19:16.611 --> 01:19:17.630
<v Speaker 5>same shit and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1760
01:19:17.631 --> 01:19:21.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm wasting a significant amount of my</v>
<v Speaker 5>energy on someone who doesn't want to</v>

1761
01:19:21.411 --> 01:19:26.411
<v Speaker 5>waste any of their energy on themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so managing the,</v>

1762
01:19:26.661 --> 01:19:29.270
<v Speaker 5>the community and the tribe that you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

1763
01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:32.090
<v Speaker 5>making sure that you're a good member of</v>
<v Speaker 5>that tribe,</v>

1764
01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:35.000
<v Speaker 5>that your doing your part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1765
01:19:35.001 --> 01:19:40.001
<v Speaker 5>And there's a lot of cynicism in these</v>
<v Speaker 5>days about inspiration and about</v>

1766
01:19:42.141 --> 01:19:44.420
<v Speaker 5>motivation because there's a lot of fake</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

1767
01:19:44.450 --> 01:19:47.180
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can go on instagram and you see a</v>

1768
01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:51.830
<v Speaker 5>million of these inspirational quote</v>
<v Speaker 5>pages and there were run by people that</v>

1769
01:19:51.831 --> 01:19:53.330
<v Speaker 5>are probably depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1770
01:19:53.331 --> 01:19:55.070
<v Speaker 5>you see a lot of people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1771
01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:58.850
<v Speaker 5>talking about how to get ahead in life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're not really doing anything</v>

1772
01:19:58.851 --> 01:19:59.684
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>

1773
01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:01.820
<v Speaker 5>So there's a lot of cynicism involved in</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1774
01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:05.960
<v Speaker 5>But there's also sincerity in it and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can get,</v>

1775
01:20:05.961 --> 01:20:09.150
<v Speaker 5>if you just look at it with a pure heart</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a pure mind,</v>

1776
01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:14.180
<v Speaker 5>you can get a lot of energy out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when you're around happy,</v>

1777
01:20:15.150 --> 01:20:17.580
<v Speaker 5>inspirational people that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>successful,</v>

1778
01:20:17.581 --> 01:20:21.060
<v Speaker 5>it makes you feel better and you get</v>
<v Speaker 5>inspired.</v>

1779
01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:25.020
<v Speaker 5>And if you act on that inspiration,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your life will be more fulfilled.</v>

1780
01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:28.110
<v Speaker 5>And it's not just inspirational in terms</v>
<v Speaker 5>of financial success,</v>

1781
01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:31.920
<v Speaker 5>but in terms of doing difficult things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's running a hundred miles,</v>

1782
01:20:31.921 --> 01:20:34.470
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't pay you a God damn thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>other than the the,</v>

1783
01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:39.530
<v Speaker 5>the wealth of the knowledge that you can</v>
<v Speaker 5>push yourself to such an extreme or</v>

1784
01:20:39.721 --> 01:20:41.510
<v Speaker 5>anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether it's someone who becomes a</v>

1785
01:20:41.511 --> 01:20:44.970
<v Speaker 5>really good at playing chess or someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's really good at martial arts or,</v>

1786
01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.470
<v Speaker 5>or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1787
01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:51.150
<v Speaker 5>there's a great feeling in these</v>
<v Speaker 5>overcoming these difficult things</v>

1788
01:20:51.151 --> 01:20:56.151
<v Speaker 5>because life is never this just constant</v>
<v Speaker 5>state of I'm at a nine all day and when</v>

1789
01:20:57.031 --> 01:20:59.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm with my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hit 10 Yay.</v>

1790
01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:02.100
<v Speaker 5>And I stay like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not real.</v>

1791
01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:07.280
<v Speaker 5>What's real is like you saying that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>went to this monastery and felt all</v>

1792
01:21:10.441 --> 01:21:13.860
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this angsty about meditating and being</v>

1793
01:21:13.861 --> 01:21:16.860
<v Speaker 5>alone and not having your phone and not</v>
<v Speaker 5>having the input.</v>

1794
01:21:16.861 --> 01:21:19.950
<v Speaker 5>But then when it comes out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you have this reward.</v>

1795
01:21:19.951 --> 01:21:23.040
<v Speaker 5>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you pushed through this and you had</v>

1796
01:21:23.041 --> 01:21:26.760
<v Speaker 5>these uncomfortable feelings and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>came out of those uncomfortable feelings</v>

1797
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:31.910
<v Speaker 5>with this new found appreciation for</v>
<v Speaker 5>time and this new found respect for your</v>

1798
01:21:32.011 --> 01:21:36.120
<v Speaker 5>own existence in your own space and</v>
<v Speaker 5>carving out three hours for yourself a</v>

1799
01:21:36.121 --> 01:21:38.310
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where it all comes from.</v>

1800
01:21:38.311 --> 01:21:43.311
<v Speaker 5>It all comes from life lessons and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>lessons are learned through struggle and</v>

1801
01:21:43.501 --> 01:21:46.380
<v Speaker 5>I think that there's a lot of people out</v>
<v Speaker 5>there that thinks somehow or another</v>

1802
01:21:46.381 --> 01:21:49.050
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get to some place where</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're living in silk sheets and you get</v>

1803
01:21:49.051 --> 01:21:52.170
<v Speaker 5>your toes done while someone's dropping</v>
<v Speaker 5>grapes into your mouth.</v>

1804
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:54.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never wanted that.</v>

1805
01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:57.660
<v Speaker 5>That guy's not going to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be bored our into the</v>

1806
01:21:57.661 --> 01:21:59.760
<v Speaker 5>grapes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can we get those fucking grapes away</v>

1807
01:21:59.761 --> 01:22:02.040
<v Speaker 5>from me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stop painting my toes.</v>

1808
01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:04.710
<v Speaker 5>What am I doing in this bed?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to do something.</v>

1809
01:22:04.711 --> 01:22:07.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm not stimulated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The human organism,</v>

1810
01:22:07.651 --> 01:22:12.510
<v Speaker 5>the animal that we are needs constant</v>
<v Speaker 5>stimulation because it evolved.</v>

1811
01:22:12.511 --> 01:22:16.530
<v Speaker 5>Trying to find food and escape enemies</v>
<v Speaker 5>and find shelter,</v>

1812
01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:18.840
<v Speaker 5>escape nature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>escape the elements,</v>

1813
01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:22.500
<v Speaker 5>try to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is the great joy that you</v>

1814
01:22:22.501 --> 01:22:25.710
<v Speaker 5>haven't taken care of your children,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you can protect your children from</v>

1815
01:22:25.711 --> 01:22:28.110
<v Speaker 5>the elements and the enemies and feed</v>
<v Speaker 5>them and,</v>

1816
01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:31.140
<v Speaker 5>and it's also the great sadness that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>see in losers.</v>

1817
01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:33.450
<v Speaker 5>When I see a loser,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see some guys,</v>

1818
01:22:33.630 --> 01:22:36.660
<v Speaker 5>43 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lives in his parents' basement and he</v>

1819
01:22:36.661 --> 01:22:38.190
<v Speaker 5>fucking hates the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1820
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:40.130
<v Speaker 5>that was a baby man.</v>

1821
01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:43.980
<v Speaker 5>This is a baby that somebody just gave</v>
<v Speaker 5>shitty nutrients to.</v>

1822
01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:48.990
<v Speaker 5>Whether its nutrients in the forms of</v>
<v Speaker 5>food or in the form of thoughts and</v>

1823
01:22:48.991 --> 01:22:53.991
<v Speaker 5>ideas and examples and this kid develop</v>
<v Speaker 5>these horrible self defeating patterns</v>

1824
01:22:55.291 --> 01:22:59.460
<v Speaker 5>of behavior that have led them to this</v>
<v Speaker 5>point where they're this,</v>

1825
01:22:59.730 --> 01:23:04.590
<v Speaker 5>this middle aged person with no future</v>
<v Speaker 5>and no idea of how to get out of this</v>

1826
01:23:04.591 --> 01:23:06.910
<v Speaker 5>Rut,</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably never will escape it and might</v>

1827
01:23:06.911 --> 01:23:09.220
<v Speaker 5>just wind up sucking on a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1828
01:23:09.221 --> 01:23:11.290
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the world that we live in today</v>

1829
01:23:11.291 --> 01:23:15.370
<v Speaker 5>and I think part of that world is</v>
<v Speaker 5>because we have been fed this line of</v>

1830
01:23:15.371 --> 01:23:19.450
<v Speaker 5>Horse Shit that you're supposed to seek</v>
<v Speaker 5>comfort and I don't think you are.</v>

1831
01:23:19.630 --> 01:23:23.980
<v Speaker 5>I think you're supposed to seek lessons</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you supposed to seek difficult tasks</v>

1832
01:23:23.981 --> 01:23:24.980
<v Speaker 5>and and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1833
01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:29.110
<v Speaker 5>and accomplishments and through those</v>
<v Speaker 5>things and through doing things that are</v>

1834
01:23:29.111 --> 01:23:31.300
<v Speaker 5>hard to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if it's just a fucking 90 minute</v>

1835
01:23:31.301 --> 01:23:34.240
<v Speaker 5>hot yoga class,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do a 90 minute yoga class,</v>

1836
01:23:34.241 --> 01:23:34.450
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1837
01:23:34.450 --> 01:23:35.710
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those last 20 minutes,</v>

1838
01:23:35.711 --> 01:23:39.700
<v Speaker 5>I do not want to be there man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I definitely don't want to give 100%</v>

1839
01:23:39.701 --> 01:23:41.140
<v Speaker 5>and I can cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>

1840
01:23:41.170 --> 01:23:43.000
<v Speaker 5>I could kind of have acid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>

1841
01:23:43.090 --> 01:23:46.390
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if I don't and I get through it,</v>

1842
01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:50.110
<v Speaker 5>when that time is up and the lady says</v>
<v Speaker 5>Namaz Day and everybody gets up,</v>

1843
01:23:50.111 --> 01:23:51.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck man,</v>

1844
01:23:51.310 --> 01:23:52.390
<v Speaker 5>I made it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1845
01:23:52.391 --> 01:23:55.580
<v Speaker 5>I lost 15 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My fucking Yoga Mat is drenched to the</v>

1846
01:23:55.581 --> 01:23:59.770
<v Speaker 5>point where I can literally wring it out</v>
<v Speaker 5>and fill up a jug up with water.</v>

1847
01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:04.300
<v Speaker 5>But through that struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will now have a better day and I</v>

1848
01:24:04.301 --> 01:24:08.230
<v Speaker 5>better fucking do it again tomorrow or</v>
<v Speaker 5>do something else because if I just</v>

1849
01:24:08.231 --> 01:24:09.790
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well tomorrow I'm just going to coast</v>

1850
01:24:09.791 --> 01:24:11.980
<v Speaker 5>and eat twinkies and watch TV.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1851
01:24:11.981 --> 01:24:13.810
<v Speaker 5>hello sadness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my old friend.</v>

1852
01:24:13.930 --> 01:24:16.360
<v Speaker 5>Hello Depression.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because when you're not doing anything</v>

1853
01:24:16.361 --> 01:24:19.990
<v Speaker 5>you feel like shit and that's just part</v>
<v Speaker 5>of being a human being and we can</v>

1854
01:24:19.991 --> 01:24:23.090
<v Speaker 5>pretend that we're something other than</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we really are and we can pretend</v>

1855
01:24:23.091 --> 01:24:23.860
<v Speaker 5>not me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1856
01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:25.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm just cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just chilling,</v>

1857
01:24:25.330 --> 01:24:26.950
<v Speaker 5>doing nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bullshit.</v>

1858
01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:29.140
<v Speaker 5>You're a fucking human.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a human being.</v>

1859
01:24:29.141 --> 01:24:32.830
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you evolve from the fucking hundreds and</v>

1860
01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:34.600
<v Speaker 5>thousands of years of hunters and</v>
<v Speaker 5>gatherers and people that were</v>

1861
01:24:34.601 --> 01:24:37.600
<v Speaker 5>struggling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those real human reward systems are</v>

1862
01:24:37.601 --> 01:24:41.290
<v Speaker 5>carved deeply into your DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you don't respect that,</v>

1863
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:45.640
<v Speaker 5>if you don't respect the mechanism of</v>
<v Speaker 5>happiness and fulfillment and what you</v>

1864
01:24:45.641 --> 01:24:48.670
<v Speaker 5>really need to do in order to feel</v>
<v Speaker 5>satisfied in life,</v>

1865
01:24:49.330 --> 01:24:51.220
<v Speaker 5>camaraderie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>love,</v>

1866
01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:53.080
<v Speaker 5>family,</v>
<v Speaker 5>friendship,</v>

1867
01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:55.450
<v Speaker 5>struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>testing yourself,</v>

1868
01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:58.630
<v Speaker 5>learning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all those things are imperative.</v>

1869
01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:00.640
<v Speaker 5>They're all a giant part of being a</v>
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>

1870
01:25:01.450 --> 01:25:03.370
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was amazing.</v>

1871
01:25:03.371 --> 01:25:05.440
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking in my head and my checking</v>

1872
01:25:05.441 --> 01:25:08.890
<v Speaker 5>those boxes as you're talking and in my</v>
<v Speaker 5>living my life like that,</v>

1873
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:10.450
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1874
01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:11.890
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you.</v>

1875
01:25:11.930 --> 01:25:13.180
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like you are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am.</v>

1876
01:25:13.181 --> 01:25:13.511
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1877
01:25:13.511 --> 01:25:14.170
<v Speaker 5>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1878
01:25:14.170 --> 01:25:14.831
<v Speaker 5>waiver,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1879
01:25:14.831 --> 01:25:16.930
<v Speaker 5>We all have days in and days out.</v>

1880
01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:19.420
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But to be reinforced.</v>

1881
01:25:20.110 --> 01:25:21.300
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm a,</v>

1882
01:25:21.301 --> 01:25:22.270
<v Speaker 5>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1883
01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:24.850
<v Speaker 5>as I'm listening to you talk about that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm literally going through like the</v>

1884
01:25:24.851 --> 01:25:26.590
<v Speaker 5>last 10 years of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1885
01:25:26.591 --> 01:25:29.230
<v Speaker 5>And when I live with David,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I went on the modest as all of</v>

1886
01:25:29.231 --> 01:25:30.500
<v Speaker 5>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1887
01:25:30.670 --> 01:25:32.920
<v Speaker 5>they're all about getting an edge and</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing what you,</v>

1888
01:25:33.010 --> 01:25:33.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it is,</v>

1889
01:25:33.971 --> 01:25:36.040
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's like part of being human</v>

1890
01:25:36.690 --> 01:25:39.190
<v Speaker 5>and that stuff makes me feel most the</v>
<v Speaker 5>most alive too.</v>

1891
01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:42.880
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it just makes me feel alive.</v>

1892
01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:44.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1893
01:25:44.801 --> 01:25:47.950
<v Speaker 5>and also like little improvements over</v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

1894
01:25:47.951 --> 01:25:50.560
<v Speaker 5>It's why doing difficult things as good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's running.</v>

1895
01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:54.370
<v Speaker 5>So like if you're running and you run,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could run two miles and then one day</v>

1896
01:25:54.371 --> 01:25:57.070
<v Speaker 5>you get it up to three.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like fuck,</v>

1897
01:25:57.071 --> 01:26:01.600
<v Speaker 5>I remember when I struggled with too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now I can do for little improvements,</v>

1898
01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:04.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you really that in yoga class and in</v>

1899
01:26:04.821 --> 01:26:07.220
<v Speaker 5>particular for me because I'm not good</v>
<v Speaker 5>at it,</v>

1900
01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:10.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so when I do a yoga class and I can hold</v>

1901
01:26:10.881 --> 01:26:14.300
<v Speaker 5>a pose until the night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know like you're holding these pose</v>

1902
01:26:14.301 --> 01:26:17.030
<v Speaker 5>for a minute and if you could stand on</v>
<v Speaker 5>one foot,</v>

1903
01:26:17.031 --> 01:26:19.880
<v Speaker 5>grabbing your other foot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lifting it above your head and keep your</v>

1904
01:26:19.881 --> 01:26:23.540
<v Speaker 5>arm out straight and your balance and</v>
<v Speaker 5>your foot's on fire and your core is</v>

1905
01:26:23.541 --> 01:26:24.080
<v Speaker 5>engaged.</v>

1906
01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.490
<v Speaker 5>But if you can get to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 5>they say stop you,</v>

1907
01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:29.690
<v Speaker 5>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you feel like,</v>

1908
01:26:29.691 --> 01:26:31.640
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't used to be able to do that.</v>

1909
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:34.950
<v Speaker 5>I used to be able to hold it for 10</v>
<v Speaker 5>seconds and I would fall down and then</v>

1910
01:26:34.951 --> 01:26:37.430
<v Speaker 5>I'd have to start all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Start from scratch.</v>

1911
01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:40.730
<v Speaker 5>There's little improvements.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Will you feel yourself getting a little</v>

1912
01:26:40.731 --> 01:26:44.060
<v Speaker 5>better at something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's Jujitsu or anything else,</v>

1913
01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:46.940
<v Speaker 5>little improvements I think or what life</v>
<v Speaker 5>is all about.</v>

1914
01:26:46.941 --> 01:26:51.941
<v Speaker 5>And I think also there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are a tool to feed the mind cause</v>

1915
01:26:52.221 --> 01:26:54.990
<v Speaker 5>I really believe the mind needs these</v>
<v Speaker 5>little lessons.</v>

1916
01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.460
<v Speaker 5>The mind needs these little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these little tasks.</v>

1917
01:26:58.730 --> 01:27:00.350
<v Speaker 5>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your brain doesn't get that,</v>

1918
01:27:00.351 --> 01:27:03.590
<v Speaker 5>I think it atrophies and it gets</v>
<v Speaker 5>depressed and it's like,</v>

1919
01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:06.560
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's half of what a lot of</v>

1920
01:27:06.561 --> 01:27:11.561
<v Speaker 5>people's sadness is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is this lack of stimulation and reward,</v>

1921
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:14.810
<v Speaker 5>lack of these peaks and valleys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this again,</v>

1922
01:27:14.811 --> 01:27:17.900
<v Speaker 5>this bullshit idea that we're constantly</v>
<v Speaker 5>fed,</v>

1923
01:27:17.901 --> 01:27:19.190
<v Speaker 5>that you should be comfortable.</v>

1924
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:20.820
<v Speaker 2>It's so true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1925
01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:22.380
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Goggins live with me,</v>

1926
01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:25.050
<v Speaker 2>his rule is we had to do something</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday that sucked.</v>

1927
01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:28.680
<v Speaker 2>That was his role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's the master at that Shit.</v>

1928
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Tell me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when did he make you do?</v>

1929
01:27:31.890 --> 01:27:34.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday sucked.</v>

1930
01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:37.620
<v Speaker 2>He didn't tell me that we're going to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that five times a day.</v>

1931
01:27:37.830 --> 01:27:38.663
<v Speaker 2>That what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1932
01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:39.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1933
01:27:39.871 --> 01:27:41.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember one day Bob was,</v>

1934
01:27:41.791 --> 01:27:44.790
<v Speaker 2>the first thing we did was we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he came in and he um,</v>

1935
01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:48.330
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to see how many pull ups I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could do so we can map out the month.</v>

1936
01:27:48.331 --> 01:27:52.380
<v Speaker 2>He lived with me for a month and I went</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the pull up bar and I got like maybe</v>

1937
01:27:52.381 --> 01:27:54.630
<v Speaker 2>eight pull ups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an exaggeration.</v>

1938
01:27:54.631 --> 01:27:58.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably got like four pull ups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are listening.</v>

1939
01:27:58.831 --> 01:28:01.430
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1940
01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:02.850
<v Speaker 2>and then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wait 30 seconds,</v>

1941
01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:03.743
<v Speaker 2>go and do it again.</v>

1942
01:28:04.230 --> 01:28:07.590
<v Speaker 2>And I went up on the pull up bar and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>did maybe like three or four.</v>

1943
01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:08.640
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wait 30 seconds,</v>

1944
01:28:08.641 --> 01:28:11.760
<v Speaker 2>I want you to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I got up on the pull up bar and I</v>

1945
01:28:11.761 --> 01:28:13.980
<v Speaker 2>did maybe like one kipping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1946
01:28:13.981 --> 01:28:16.200
<v Speaker 2>getting my damn chin over the bar and</v>
<v Speaker 2>barely,</v>

1947
01:28:16.230 --> 01:28:18.240
<v Speaker 2>and I dropped down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all jacked up and I said,</v>

1948
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:19.331
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what's,</v>

1949
01:28:19.331 --> 01:28:20.280
<v Speaker 2>what's next?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1950
01:28:20.281 --> 01:28:21.720
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's next is we're not leaving here</v>

1951
01:28:21.721 --> 01:28:24.350
<v Speaker 2>until you do a hundred more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not leaving the gym until you do</v>

1952
01:28:24.351 --> 01:28:26.640
<v Speaker 2>100 more that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1953
01:28:26.970 --> 01:28:27.960
<v Speaker 2>like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1954
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:31.950
<v Speaker 2>So you and I was like seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did like probably seven or 10.</v>

1955
01:28:31.951 --> 01:28:32.820
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1956
01:28:32.821 --> 01:28:35.310
<v Speaker 2>God knows that's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1957
01:28:35.311 --> 01:28:35.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already,</v>

1958
01:28:35.970 --> 01:28:38.910
<v Speaker 2>I already know what your biggest problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>is and he's just like the limitations</v>

1959
01:28:38.911 --> 01:28:41.040
<v Speaker 2>you're putting on yourself or are self</v>
<v Speaker 2>imposed,</v>

1960
01:28:41.041 --> 01:28:42.330
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck back on the bar.</v>

1961
01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:46.800
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roger that then and uh,</v>

1962
01:28:46.830 --> 01:28:50.400
<v Speaker 2>I got up on the bar and I all over over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the course of an hour or two,</v>

1963
01:28:50.401 --> 01:28:53.640
<v Speaker 2>I did them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that started our journey of like,</v>

1964
01:28:53.670 --> 01:28:56.370
<v Speaker 2>you're about to go in a place where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've never been motherfucker,</v>

1965
01:28:56.820 --> 01:28:58.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1966
01:28:58.801 --> 01:29:00.990
<v Speaker 2>we went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember one day I was sitting on</v>

1967
01:29:01.050 --> 01:29:04.560
<v Speaker 2>couch and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Connecticut where I was living at the</v>

1968
01:29:04.561 --> 01:29:06.150
<v Speaker 2>time and on the ticker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

1969
01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:08.700
<v Speaker 2>on the TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the emergency broadcast system came up,</v>

1970
01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:12.660
<v Speaker 2>stay inside freezing rain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>icy conditions,</v>

1971
01:29:12.661 --> 01:29:14.910
<v Speaker 2>high winds stay inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like beeping,</v>

1972
01:29:14.911 --> 01:29:17.220
<v Speaker 2>stay inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Gaga was like,</v>

1973
01:29:17.221 --> 01:29:19.050
<v Speaker 2>this is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now let's go for a run.</v>

1974
01:29:21.150 --> 01:29:24.960
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're telling us the exact opposite.</v>

1975
01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:27.750
<v Speaker 2>They're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're broadcasting to the whole</v>

1976
01:29:27.751 --> 01:29:31.410
<v Speaker 2>community to stay inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we go for a 10 mile run in the</v>

1977
01:29:31.411 --> 01:29:35.220
<v Speaker 2>blizzard and we'd come home and I lived</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a lake and kids are playing hockey on</v>

1978
01:29:35.221 --> 01:29:37.830
<v Speaker 2>the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we go down and he takes his hand and</v>

1979
01:29:37.831 --> 01:29:42.180
<v Speaker 2>he moves all the snow off the ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets a boulder and he breaks the ice,</v>

1980
01:29:42.181 --> 01:29:43.680
<v Speaker 2>a little hole in the ice with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>boulder.</v>

1981
01:29:43.681 --> 01:29:46.260
<v Speaker 2>And then he takes his hand and he mixed</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole little bit bigger.</v>

1982
01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:50.460
<v Speaker 2>And then he jumps in and then he points</v>
<v Speaker 2>at me and he takes his finger and he's</v>

1983
01:29:50.461 --> 01:29:54.330
<v Speaker 2>singles for me to jump in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going in the fucking freezing</v>

1984
01:29:54.331 --> 01:29:57.690
<v Speaker 2>cold water because my mother told me as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kid in long island,</v>

1985
01:29:57.691 --> 01:30:00.450
<v Speaker 2>don't go anywhere near the frozen where</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you fall in,</v>

1986
01:30:00.451 --> 01:30:01.530
<v Speaker 2>you have like a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1987
01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:02.700
<v Speaker 2>he's bathing in it.</v>

1988
01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:06.530
<v Speaker 2>So of course I go in and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1989
01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:07.321
<v Speaker 2>he looks at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1990
01:30:07.321 --> 01:30:08.280
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got about,</v>

1991
01:30:08.281 --> 01:30:10.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about four to two to four minutes.</v>

1992
01:30:10.661 --> 01:30:12.360
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna get hypothermia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just went on to run.</v>

1993
01:30:12.361 --> 01:30:15.870
<v Speaker 2>We got to get you out of the lake and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to get ad,</v>

1994
01:30:15.871 --> 01:30:16.770
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't get out.</v>

1995
01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:18.930
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your skin touches the ice,</v>

1996
01:30:18.931 --> 01:30:22.140
<v Speaker 2>it's going to stick to the ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the kid in Christmas story is Tang</v>

1997
01:30:22.141 --> 01:30:23.550
<v Speaker 2>that sticks to the pole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1998
01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:28.551
<v Speaker 2>so he puts my shoes back on my hands and</v>
<v Speaker 2>picks my ass up and puts my sock.</v>

1999
01:30:28.561 --> 01:30:31.890
<v Speaker 2>I put my socks on or whatever and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could bear crawl out of the ice and I</v>

2000
01:30:32.250 --> 01:30:36.480
<v Speaker 2>run up and I see my wife looking out the</v>
<v Speaker 2>window as I'm running into the house and</v>

2001
01:30:36.481 --> 01:30:39.480
<v Speaker 2>we come in and she says to Goggins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2002
01:30:39.481 --> 01:30:41.310
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the medical benefit of jumping in</v>

2003
01:30:41.311 --> 01:30:43.440
<v Speaker 2>a frozen lake?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said to her,</v>

2004
01:30:43.470 --> 01:30:45.120
<v Speaker 2>there's no medical benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

2005
01:30:45.150 --> 01:30:47.400
<v Speaker 2>this is what your husband signed up for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2006
01:30:47.401 --> 01:30:48.960

2007
01:30:48.961 --> 01:30:51.390
<v Speaker 2>to get to his goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2028
01:31:32.641 --> 01:31:35.170
<v Speaker 2>at all,</v>

01:32:39.371 --> 01:32:41.830
<v Speaker 1>and you live a life with those lessons</v>
<v Speaker 1>find you.</v>

2058
01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2059
01:32:42.890 --> 01:32:44.110
<v Speaker 1>and seek them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You seek them.</v>

2060
01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Goggins story is so fascinating</v>

2061
01:32:46.481 --> 01:32:50.410
<v Speaker 1>because he wasn't that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was fat and out of shape and</v>

2062
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:55.470
<v Speaker 1>unmotivated and lazy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked openly about the first time he</v>

2063
01:32:55.541 --> 01:32:56.680
<v Speaker 1>ran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he quit.</v>

2064
01:32:56.710 --> 01:32:57.910
<v Speaker 1>He was supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2065
01:32:57.911 --> 01:33:00.580
<v Speaker 1>ran about three quarters of a mile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he said,</v>

2066
01:33:00.581 --> 01:33:05.581
<v Speaker 1>and quit and he was exhausted and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking milkshakes and all fucked up.</v>

2067
01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:11.520
<v Speaker 1>And somehow or another decided he's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be that guy anymore and went</v>

2068
01:33:12.250 --> 01:33:17.250
<v Speaker 1>180 degrees and became this intensely</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated ironman.</v>

2069
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2070
01:33:18.731 --> 01:33:21.010

<v Speaker 1>I saw him at the race where he broke all</v>

2071
01:33:21.011 --> 01:33:22.270
<v Speaker 1>the bones in his feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2072
01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:23.200
<v Speaker 1>I saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at the,</v>

2073
01:33:23.201 --> 01:33:25.660
<v Speaker 1>I participated in that race the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>time I saw him.</v>

2074
01:33:25.661 --> 01:33:27.330
<v Speaker 1>That's how I met him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2075
01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:30.660
<v Speaker 1>in 2007 and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2076
01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:33.020
<v Speaker 1>he broke all the bones in his feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He Brooks,</v>

2077
01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:33.591
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2078
01:33:33.591 --> 01:33:34.840
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was running a hundred.</v>

2079
01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:37.840
<v Speaker 1>I was running this race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a 24 hour race as a relay team.</v>

2080
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I was with four friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the format of the races,</v>

2081
01:33:41.351 --> 01:33:42.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you run a mile.</v>

2082
01:33:42.281 --> 01:33:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I run a mile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever team runs the most amount of</v>

2083
01:33:44.441 --> 01:33:45.274
<v Speaker 1>miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2084
01:33:45.490 --> 01:33:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Wins the race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had no teammates.</v>

2085
01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:53.860
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the rest of the team?</v>

2086
01:33:54.010 --> 01:33:56.710
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he weighed a lot at the time.</v>

2087
01:33:56.740 --> 01:34:00.790
<v Speaker 1>So I watched him wait a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was He bodybuilding at the time?</v>

2088
01:34:00.791 --> 01:34:03.940
<v Speaker 1>He was just beating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably weighed 260 70 pounds.</v>

2089
01:34:03.941 --> 01:34:05.950
<v Speaker 1>Maybe one was dead lifting and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

2090
01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:08.560
<v Speaker 1>maybe even more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So was this the one where he ran 24</v>

2091
01:34:08.561 --> 01:34:12.250
<v Speaker 1>hours all around the room just to show</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he could run a hundred miles?</v>

2092
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Want up shitting himself?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I saw it.</v>

2094
01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:17.800
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know he broke all the bones in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his feet.</v>

2266
01:41:11.810 --> 01:41:12.270
<v Speaker 2>That sounds</v>

2267
01:41:12.270 --> 01:41:17.060
<v Speaker 1>so much better than living with a monk</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just so much better.</v>

2268
01:41:17.130 --> 01:41:18.870
<v Speaker 1>I miss them.</v>

01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:23.390
<v Speaker 2>Doing a while,</v>

2272
01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:24.481

01:41:28.401 --> 01:41:33.401

<v Speaker 2>but exciting.</v>

2276
01:41:34.610 --> 01:41:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the monk thing seems like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>drone of it all.</v>

2277
01:41:39.170 --> 01:41:41.930
<v Speaker 2>We'll just get to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and my surroundings in the monk thing.</v>

2279
01:41:46.851 --> 01:41:50.930
<v Speaker 2>I was like in their world forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forever.</v>

2280
01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:52.640
<v Speaker 2>And they live in the same way that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

2281
01:41:52.670 --> 01:41:54.830
<v Speaker 2>They have a little cell as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2283
01:41:58.071 --> 01:42:00.650
<v Speaker 2>from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even smaller than when I was in and I</v>

2284
01:42:00.651 --> 01:42:03.830
<v Speaker 2>was just smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller than this table.</v>

2285
01:42:04.370 --> 01:42:06.650
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my room was about the size of this tape.</v>

2286
01:42:06.710 --> 01:42:09.260
<v Speaker 2>The winners were smaller from what I</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's just the stuff that you can learn</v>

2353
01:45:04.071 --> 01:45:06.350
<v Speaker 2>if you allow yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>because even like you were giving that</v>
<v Speaker 2>little monologue and he was going</v>

2357
01:45:13.971 --> 01:45:14.631
<v Speaker 2>through it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2359
01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:20.960
<v Speaker 2>On a high level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put yourself in the position and</v>

2360
01:45:20.961 --> 01:45:23.120
<v Speaker 2>then you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be able to extract it and</v>

2361
01:45:23.121 --> 01:45:24.190
<v Speaker 2>apply it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2362
01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:27.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And exactly what I was saying is what</v>

2363
01:45:27.921 --> 01:45:31.100

<v Speaker 2>like you were around greatness.</v>

<v Speaker 2>accept mediocrity and does not accept</v>

2365

<v Speaker 2>shitty effort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants everything your body can do.</v>

2366
01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:44.690
<v Speaker 2>And through doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just get something more out of your</v>

2367
01:45:44.691 --> 01:45:46.910
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get something more out of your life.</v>
