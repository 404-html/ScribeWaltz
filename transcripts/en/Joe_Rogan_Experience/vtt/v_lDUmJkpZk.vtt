1
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.550
All right,

2
00:00:02.551 --> 00:00:02.941
here we go.

3
00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:06.480
Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight but we wish we

4
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:11.481
were brought to you by wd 40 cause Brian I think I shit is constantly squeak in.

5
00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:14.290
So when we would be like here,

6
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.143
all that,

7
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.010
it's really the springs,

8
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.360
the springs of the problem.

9
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.570
But I wonder if like just a little splash of wd 40 wouldn't save the day.

10
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:21.870
Joe.

11
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:22.660
Maybe it would,

12
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.281
maybe it wouldn't.

13
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:25.380
Maybe it would just smell a garage in here then.

14
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:26.540
Oh God,

15
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.740
that'd be high blood guys need a free case of that.

16
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.030
I free case wd foot out and then maybe a little bit of sponsorship.

17
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:37.200
Think the reality of the uncensored nature of this podcast makes it very

18
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:40.290
problematic for anybody to want to be professionally associated with it.

19
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:41.940
I don't know if I go in my dad's garage,

20
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:46.590
he has a fucking Pamela Anderson poster on the wall and he has all these wd 40

21
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:46.951
products.

22
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:50.190
They have like these deputy 40 pens now where it's just like if you just want to

23
00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:54.120
dab something with the fleshlight wd 40 is a lubricant.

24
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.613
You imagine.

25
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.140
Imagine what kind of damage your duty a dick.

26
00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.510
If you fuck the flush lines,

27
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.360
wd 40 does that shit all day.

28
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.530
What do you think that's square black spot in his hair is,

29
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:12.360
it's from to juicing all over his fucking head.

30
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.410
Wd 40 squirting out the tip of the functioning of those got black loads.

31
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.150
Oil like loads.

32
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.090
It's been around cars too long to imagine if you love cars so much that you

33
00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:26.250
really tried to jerk off to gasoline.

34
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.160
You really try to pour gas in your hand and beat off with it.

35
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:30.480
I mean it is like a lubricant,

36
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:31.120
right?

37
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.290
Liquid could.

38
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.000
You have to be unbelievably painful,

39
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:36.330
right?

40
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.971
You realize you're,

41
00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:39.270
you're pitching some sort of extreme reality show.

42
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:41.240
Like what can you check off with?

43
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.490
Yeah,

44
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.940
and it's a combination of some perverted show and like name that tune.

45
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.400
I can jerk off with gasoline.

46
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.130
Joe Rogan chuck off with that gasoline.

47
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.731
No,

48
00:01:50.731 --> 00:01:51.080
I can,

49
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.930
I can get to fuck a bandanna on because the fumes come in.

50
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.950
Three strokes.

51
00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.261
Yeah.

52
00:01:58.261 --> 00:01:59.460
How many aces that didn't take,

53
00:01:59.461 --> 00:01:59.791
how many,

54
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:00.780
how many minutes?

55
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:01.614
How many minutes?

56
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.290
If you had a race to come ready,

57
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:04.681
go,

58
00:02:04.681 --> 00:02:06.330
there's a fucking camera on you.

59
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.660
You're alone in a fucking white room and you,

60
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.720
you don't get to watch it.

61
00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:11.640
What else peed off?

62
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:13.170
So you have to imagine,

63
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.670
and it's for $1 million,

64
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.460
the people who get off on that up,

65
00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:19.830
people who always fantasized about being in a room with just a cat.

66
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.330
Yeah.

67
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.980
If you were shows always turned me on.

68
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:23.814
I don't know what it was.

69
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.330
If you are a freak reality star gay dude,

70
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.160
that would probably be a good gig for you.

71
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.670
You could probably like win that contest the quickest outright.

72
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.510
Yeah.

73
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.110
Cause you know you would really be worried about guys watching you beat off.

74
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.800
Or like athletes who don't freeze up and like game seven,

75
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.400
I can take the big shot.

76
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:43.350
They don't care if like with all that attention,

77
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.090
I was watching some documentary on prison and there was one dude who claimed

78
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.310
that he had an affair with a,

79
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:53.420
there was a female prison guard and he wound up,

80
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.430
I'll fucking this female prison guard and some,

81
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.560
some shit went on.

82
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.510
She got in trouble for it.

83
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.380
Wow.

84
00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.213
The Guy,

85
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.550
apparently

86
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.550
<v 1>he could make his dick hard and ejaculate all without touching himself.</v>

87
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.550
That's how much free time that dude had.

88
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.530
That dude was in jail for so long.

89
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.280
They figured out.

90
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.480
Talk about game though.

91
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.201
Yeah,

92
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:15.600
to be in the prison cell.

93
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.200
You know she's fucking with their career.

94
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:20.050
Her ability to mortgage still got it.

95
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.670
He probably did that trick he got,

96
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.340
he showed her that.

97
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.360
I think he showed her that.

98
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:26.650
I bet she just couldn't take it.

99
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.630
I mean that is like the ultimate pimp move.

100
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:33.631
You're in a cage locked up in a cage and you can make yourself not all of

101
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:36.040
yourself and it's so hot that the guard,

102
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:37.600
the one person who's,

103
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.650
she's free,

104
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:40.030
she just works there.

105
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.670
She just works around you and you're stuck in up.

106
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:44.080
What did he do for a crime?

107
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.213
I don't know.

108
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.590
I wish I had all the details of the story or the not.

109
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.460
It was actually true,

110
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.790
you know?

111
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.470
I mean she could have just made that shit up,

112
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.960
but that's a pretty extraordinary thing.

113
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:54.160
Is there a guy who can do that?

114
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.780
I've seen guys blow themselves.

115
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.960
I didn't know if it was I with the guy who,

116
00:03:58.961 --> 00:03:59.490
uh,

117
00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.921
we went to,

118
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:02.470
we went to a titty bar and a d,

119
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.640
I don't think he got a lap dance.

120
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:04.990
He was just looking at this girl.

121
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.640
He got so turned on,

122
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.210
he blew it in his pants and I w I laughed.

123
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.730
He didn't tell me until like weeks later.

124
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.000
And it was one of the hardest I've ever laughed because he was laughing.

125
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:17.740
He had a great sense of humor about himself,

126
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.020
so I'll do it if it was just one of those fucking,

127
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:21.250
you just crying,

128
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:26.251
laughing like there was the first wave of what do with this fucking way.

129
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.000
And he was like,

130
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:28.210
dude,

131
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.510
I don't know how I was just sitting there.

132
00:04:30.511 --> 00:04:31.170
He's like a pothead.

133
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.340
I just sit and I don't know,

134
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.330
I just came this pants.

135
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.101
Anyway,

136
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:37.840
this is the longest fleshlight commercial.

137
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.240
That's like some shit.

138
00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:42.010
Maybe you do it when you like,

139
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.730
I dunno.

140
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.850
11 o'clock the commercial reminder.

141
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.310
12 yeah,

142
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:49.144
that's ridiculous.

143
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.753
The ability.

144
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.280
We've got bill Burke contact high.

You might've got hot box in the small room and it could have happened.

151
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.391
Go to Joe Rogan,

I believe in it and I wanted make it as easy as possible where people don't feel

168
00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:39.480
even remotely ripped off and because of that,

169
00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:43.100
the way we have it set up the first order 30 pills you by you,

170
00:05:43.101 --> 00:05:43.580
you can,

171
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.360
you get a hundred percent money back guarantee.

172
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.280
You don't have to return the pills.

173
00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:48.960
You just say this stuff doesn't work.

174
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.520
You get 100% of your money back.

175
00:05:50.521 --> 00:05:54.270
We're way more concerned with making sure that nobody feels ripped off than we

176
00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:55.140
are with making money.

177
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.591
That's,

178
00:05:55.591 --> 00:05:57.380
that is my number one priority

179
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.300
<v 0>and all of these things,</v>

180
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.130
all these different nootropics are all things that I've been into before I ever

181
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:05.260
had anything to do with it.

182
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.460
If you use the code name Rogan,

183
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.590
you'll save yourself 10% off.

184
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.150
Okay.

185
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.320
Cue The magic pill bars here.

186
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.121
And like I said,

187
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:14.954
I think

188
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.080
we got a contact Rogan experience try by day Joe Rogan podcast.

189
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.570
Is that a new thing you're doing?

190
00:06:27.571 --> 00:06:28.410
They're Dj's

191
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.120
Dj r d

192
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:33.630
powerful bill burr.

193
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:34.710
Good to see you buddy.

194
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.280
What's going on?

195
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.851
Good to see you too,

196
00:06:35.851 --> 00:06:36.170
sir.

197
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.340
Fucking awesome to have you come down here again.

198
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:39.091
Always.

199
00:06:39.091 --> 00:06:39.930
Always a good time.

200
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.240
And you were telling a fucking hilarious story about eating a pot Brownie and

201
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.180
about how fucked up it.

202
00:06:45.181 --> 00:06:45.880
Got Ya.

203
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.713
Yeah.

204
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.160
I'm guessing this is the story that you had told on our first podcast,

205
00:06:50.161 --> 00:06:50.994
but I forgot it,

206
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.740
but it's fucking hilarious.

207
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.821
It's true.

208
00:06:53.821 --> 00:06:54.600
Kids don't,

209
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.580
don't just John just eat pot.

210
00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.640
That shit is way stronger than smoking pot four to five times more psychoactive.

211
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.761
Yeah.

212
00:07:02.761 --> 00:07:06.480
Nobody told me that the person didn't know and uh,

213
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.810
yeah,

214
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:07.860
so I had two and a half.

215
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:08.720
I have a sweet tooth.

216
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.440
You know what I know.

217
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.273
No,

218
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:11.491
<v 4>I had one,</v>

219
00:07:11.491 --> 00:07:14.370
she had half of one right.

220
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.233
She had half of one.

221
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.680
Then I ate her other half,

222
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.193
I don't remember.

223
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.160
And then there was another half left and I threw that you cause cause she was

224
00:07:23.161 --> 00:07:24.750
getting high and I wasn't feeling anything.

225
00:07:24.751 --> 00:07:29.751
And then we got in a car and went to Newark Airport to go fly a Costa Rica.

226
00:07:29.761 --> 00:07:30.690
And by the time I got there,

227
00:07:30.691 --> 00:07:30.901
dude,

228
00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:31.231
it was,

229
00:07:31.231 --> 00:07:32.064
it was,

230
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:32.971
it was insane.

231
00:07:32.971 --> 00:07:33.750
I was like borderline

232
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.010
<v 0>hallucinating dude.</v>

233
00:07:35.011 --> 00:07:35.640
The,

234
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.640
the eating of it is like if you go back to like early literature on Hash eating,

235
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.910
like what would the kinds of things that people were describing when they were

236
00:07:44.911 --> 00:07:45.750
eating hash,

237
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.450
incredible psychedelic experiences.

238
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.480
People don't realize that's not just like getting hot.

239
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.890
You're not just like smoking a little reefer and kicking back and hey this

240
00:07:55.891 --> 00:07:58.740
movie's kind of Vani is fucking pizza tastes so good now.

241
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:03.510
Now you ate two pot brownies and where you probably should have ate a quarter of

242
00:08:03.511 --> 00:08:06.390
one of them cause they're fucking notoriously strong.

243
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.440
Nobody ever,

244
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.170
when was the last time you ever heard of anybody getting a like really shitty

245
00:08:10.171 --> 00:08:10.830
brownies?

246
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:11.730
Seven days ago,

247
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:12.601
seven days ago.

248
00:08:12.601 --> 00:08:13.320
You heard PR,

249
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.380
somebody getting Shitty Brown.

250
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.560
I got shitty Brown.

251
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:16.170
Yeah,

252
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.940
I think there were mushroom brownies.

253
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:18.391
Oh,

254
00:08:18.391 --> 00:08:19.710
you just got them from a dude.

255
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.010
Some guy just gave it to me how to fucking show and then I felt like I was

256
00:08:23.011 --> 00:08:23.550
tripping.

257
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:23.970
Crazy.

258
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:24.631
You're eating things.

259
00:08:24.631 --> 00:08:25.830
People just giving you a chance.

260
00:08:25.831 --> 00:08:29.040
That's like Jim Morrison Shit fucking down the street eating whatever anybody

261
00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:30.360
gives you the dispatch.

262
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:35.420
I go to a dispensary that I trust and there you get used to whatever they're,

263
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.740
they're sort of labeling is,

264
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:38.461
you know.

265
00:08:38.461 --> 00:08:40.140
But when you got to ask them like what?

266
00:08:40.141 --> 00:08:40.974
Like what do you do?

267
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:43.400
[inaudible] I know like,

268
00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:45.780
like governmental sticker that's on there like this is,

269
00:08:45.781 --> 00:08:46.051
you know,

270
00:08:46.051 --> 00:08:47.220
4.5%.

271
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.150
Well then alcohol,

272
00:08:48.151 --> 00:08:50.380
it gets silly because they have like axes,

273
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.050
especially baked goods.

274
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.430
See the with marijuana,

275
00:08:53.431 --> 00:08:54.840
if it's just the marijuana that you,

276
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.130
it's pretty obvious,

277
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:56.641
you know,

278
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:57.150
it's all,

279
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.740
even if it's really strong marijuana,

280
00:08:58.741 --> 00:08:59.574
it's still,

281
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.080
you know what you're smoking,

282
00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:02.490
you know what the size of it is.

283
00:09:02.491 --> 00:09:05.940
You know how much THC is going to get in there from a bowl or a joint.

284
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:07.590
When you eat something,

285
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.440
they have these weird labels on,

286
00:09:09.441 --> 00:09:12.150
I'm like five x and three x,

287
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.920
but x is,

288
00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:15.390
there's no real x.

289
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.190
It's not like x equals 10 milligrams.

290
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:18.510
It's just they're just making it up.

291
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:19.890
So it doesn't mean anything.

292
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.710
This smelling when you guys smoked,

293
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:24.470
it took me back to that fucking hurt.

294
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.193
I'll set up.

295
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.710
It'd be like if you ever puked on a grant,

296
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:29.251
you know what I mean?

297
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:31.040
Like I long time ago I,

298
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:35.850
one of the worst side of acute was drinking rum and cokes and for like 25 years,

299
00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:36.270
I never,

300
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.410
I never had another run,

301
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:38.730
not 25 what am I talking about?

302
00:09:38.731 --> 00:09:39.960
That old like 20 years.

303
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.540
It just smelled it and it would just immediately associated with peaking

304
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:46.261
outside,

305
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:46.660
you know,

306
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.300
underage drinking and the type of shit.

307
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:49.500
So when I smelled that stuff,

308
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:49.910
I was just like,

309
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:50.640
oof.

310
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.500
I had one of those Jack Daniels for a long time to fucking that.

311
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.060
The first time I got drunk,

312
00:09:57.061 --> 00:09:59.790
I got drunk with some friends in high school and Oh my God,

313
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:02.220
I didn't had no idea what I was doing.

314
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.480
I mean there's just no

315
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:05.963
Jack Daniels.

316
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:07.590
Yeah.

317
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.220
At a party with a bunch of my friends that were all too,

318
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.520
we're all like serious stoners,

319
00:10:11.521 --> 00:10:16.080
but I wouldn't smoke pot because I was too in martial arts and I thought that

320
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.120
part was a drug and pot would fuck you up,

321
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.300
but I would drink every now and then with them and the first time I ever did it

322
00:10:21.301 --> 00:10:21.720
was,

323
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.560
oh my God,

324
00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:23.640
I was so crazy.

325
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.770
Gusting Lee blasted untracked Daniels.

326
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.110
I was the old Milwaukee just in comparison

327
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.610
grows couple of scrolls and I drank like a third.

328
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:34.861
I'm like,

329
00:10:34.861 --> 00:10:35.730
am I drunk?

330
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:36.703
You know,

331
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.381
there's no way.

332
00:10:37.381 --> 00:10:38.670
Or we do jack too year,

333
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:39.901
we're car.

334
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:40.950
I threw up in a taxi,

335
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.550
a taxi cab threw up in the backseat of the cab.

336
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.110
It's fucking horrible.

337
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.790
I can barely remember it when I'm,

338
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.640
when I talk about something that happened when I was like 14 or whatever the

339
00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:51.450
hell I was,

340
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.250
it doesn't seem like I'm telling the truth.

341
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.031
You know what I mean?

342
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:54.250
It's,

343
00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.870
it seems like a kind of have a memory of that.

344
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.360
But boy is it fucking fuzzy.

345
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:00.811
You know?

346
00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:04.590
If I had to describe to you like moments in high school because it was so long

347
00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:04.911
ago,

348
00:11:04.911 --> 00:11:06.330
a long fucking time ago,

349
00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:06.990
man,

350
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.250
I'm 44 now.

351
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.840
When I look back when I was 14,

352
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.090
I don't really remember what the fuck happened back then.

353
00:11:12.091 --> 00:11:15.900
I remember a few things I can tell you where we lived to tell you my street we

354
00:11:15.901 --> 00:11:16.380
lived on,

355
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.540
but if I try to get specific with,

356
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.900
I went back to where I grew up the other day and um,

357
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:22.381
it was,

358
00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:22.730
uh,

359
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:23.850
it was really fascinating.

360
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:24.061
Man.

361
00:11:24.061 --> 00:11:28.260
Went back to the house and the w w when I went to high school,

362
00:11:28.261 --> 00:11:28.471
that,

363
00:11:28.471 --> 00:11:31.690
that era of my life and everything looked different than I imagined it.

364
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.251
It was,

365
00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:33.690
it was very strange.

366
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:34.201
It was like,

367
00:11:34.201 --> 00:11:34.381
man,

368
00:11:34.381 --> 00:11:36.570
my memories of this shit or blurry,

369
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:37.410
it's fuck.

370
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.180
Like you can start pulling them.

371
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.030
When you go back to towns then like you go,

372
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:41.640
oh yeah,

373
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.890
remember this is where we did this.

374
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:43.651
Oh yeah,

375
00:11:43.651 --> 00:11:44.630
this is what we do that and he'd,

376
00:11:44.631 --> 00:11:44.831
they'll,

377
00:11:44.831 --> 00:11:45.990
they'll start pulling back.

378
00:11:45.991 --> 00:11:46.601
Cause you go in,

379
00:11:46.601 --> 00:11:47.970
it been since you went back home.

380
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.070
Oh it had been a long fucking time.

381
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:55.071
I moved out of Boston and probably 90 91 maybe 92 so you haven't been back in

382
00:11:57.581 --> 00:11:59.290
like 21 years had been,

383
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.590
I had been back just every now and then to do gigs.

384
00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:05.290
Like Boston itself made sense to me.

385
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:08.920
But then I went to Newton where I grew up and I went like the house where I used

386
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:09.430
to live.

387
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.720
I went and looked at that and I was like,

388
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:10.991
wow,

389
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:11.824
this is crazy.

390
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.360
This is strange.

391
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:13.971
<v 1>She's done that.</v>

392
00:12:13.971 --> 00:12:16.770
Going back to houses when I was a kid you thought the front yard was like nine

393
00:12:16.771 --> 00:12:20.010
miles so he can make it to the front door in two steps.

394
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.990
That's why when you were a kid you thought it snowed more.

395
00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:22.940
It's because you are a midget.

396
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.620
You're literally walking around.

397
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.120
Every snow storm was up to your waist,

398
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:27.900
<v 0>you know?</v>

399
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.190
I think that's good for you.

400
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.690
I think it's good to grow up in a place where it snows to have a little respect

401
00:12:33.691 --> 00:12:34.524
for nature.

402
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:35.100
You know?

403
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.200
Versiti we grew up in Boston,

404
00:12:37.201 --> 00:12:38.250
men in Boston,

405
00:12:38.251 --> 00:12:42.330
you fucking respected nature for six months out of the year for six months out

406
00:12:42.331 --> 00:12:42.990
of the year.

407
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.340
You knew what the fuck was going on.

408
00:12:44.341 --> 00:12:45.990
If you had a flat on the side of the road,

409
00:12:45.991 --> 00:12:46.824
you might die.

410
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:47.400
Okay,

411
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.233
how about that?

412
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:49.123
How about that?

413
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.290
And now you can be out on your way to Mansfield and they don't.

414
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.580
They don't find you in time.

415
00:12:53.581 --> 00:12:54.480
The state patrol,

416
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:54.811
you know?

417
00:12:54.811 --> 00:12:59.100
But the goal is by some guy driving by that happened to a friend of mine from

418
00:12:59.101 --> 00:12:59.940
high school dead.

419
00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.080
He was changing a tire.

420
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.610
Can I hit the car and killed him?

421
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.140
Oh yeah.

422
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:04.980
Fuck that man.

423
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.400
<v 1>It bring up a bad memory.</v>

424
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:08.400
I remember going,

425
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.820
being convicted of drinking and driving.

426
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.070
I had to go to a mothers against drunk driving meeting and I was all paranoid is

427
00:13:13.071 --> 00:13:14.660
going to be like 10 mother's screaming at me.

428
00:13:14.661 --> 00:13:15.980
But what a piece of shit I was.

429
00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:16.611
And when I went there,

430
00:13:16.611 --> 00:13:17.810
it was the exact opposite.

431
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:22.280
It was like 200 drunk sitting there and some woman trying to tell the story

432
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.760
about her kid while all these fucking drunks bitched about their cases tour

433
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.790
going like,

434
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.971
oh,

435
00:13:28.971 --> 00:13:30.290
he blew a 0.08.

436
00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:31.641
And she standing up,

437
00:13:31.641 --> 00:13:31.911
they go,

438
00:13:31.911 --> 00:13:32.121
well,

439
00:13:32.121 --> 00:13:32.451
you know,

440
00:13:32.451 --> 00:13:34.250
you probably should discuss that with the,

441
00:13:34.251 --> 00:13:34.490
uh,

442
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:35.323
with the judge.

443
00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:38.430
So Johnny was changing his tire after practice.

444
00:13:38.431 --> 00:13:39.264
It was fucking,

445
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:39.711
no,

446
00:13:39.711 --> 00:13:42.140
that was a watershed moment for me because I couldn't judge him.

447
00:13:42.141 --> 00:13:42.531
I was like,

448
00:13:42.531 --> 00:13:44.630
I am in this demographic of fucking idiots.

449
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.650
It's like I am a 22 year old freshman in college.

450
00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:49.580
I'm a fucking loser.

451
00:13:49.581 --> 00:13:50.870
And like within 12 months I,

452
00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:51.410
uh,

453
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:53.900
started doing standup and I got away from all of that crap.

454
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.920
But uh,

455
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.420
you don't drink at all anymore right now?

456
00:13:56.421 --> 00:13:57.140
I do.

457
00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:57.441
I do.

458
00:13:57.441 --> 00:13:58.111
I took a year,

459
00:13:58.111 --> 00:13:59.330
a year and two days off.

460
00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:01.040
I wish I didn't start back up.

461
00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:02.240
It's just a bad habit.

462
00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:02.601
I mean,

463
00:14:02.601 --> 00:14:03.141
I don't get like,

464
00:14:03.141 --> 00:14:03.950
you know,

465
00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:04.251
but,

466
00:14:04.251 --> 00:14:04.490
uh,

467
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:05.210
I love it.

468
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.050
I love drinking.

469
00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.070
I love getting hammered.

470
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:08.773
I hate,

471
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.300
I hate the next day how I feel.

472
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.140
Yeah.

473
00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.130
But uh,

474
00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:14.150
I like all that shit.

475
00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:14.800
I like,

476
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.200
oh,

477
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.730
I mean all this shit that's bad for you.

478
00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:17.620
I like it.

479
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:17.981
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

480
00:14:17.981 --> 00:14:21.400
It's a very unfortunate that next day feeling no,

481
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.280
<v 1>you got to switch the waters at some point.</v>

482
00:14:23.281 --> 00:14:24.810
That's when you become a professional.

483
00:14:24.811 --> 00:14:25.350
But like,

484
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:28.490
that still doesn't really have when really all I got one buddy of ranking

485
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.190
yourself.

486
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:29.440
Yeah,

487
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:29.970
no,

488
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:30.690
I understand.

489
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:30.901
I mean,

490
00:14:30.901 --> 00:14:31.590
none of it.

491
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.080
<v 0>I do bad shows if I'm hung over,</v>

492
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.400
I don't like my shows.

493
00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.600
They don't feel good.

494
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:38.370
They don't have the flow to them,

495
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.121
you know?

496
00:14:39.121 --> 00:14:39.820
And I,

497
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:40.630
I just,

498
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:41.730
I hate that feeling.

499
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.320
I hate the feeling of being on stage and it's,

500
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.710
it would be my fault if I was hung over.

501
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:47.810
I was hung over on seats.

502
00:14:47.811 --> 00:14:48.060
It's like,

503
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:52.190
it's my fault that I'm working at like three quarter right now or it's not

504
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.001
<v 4>clicking right now.</v>

505
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:53.151
Like,

506
00:14:53.151 --> 00:14:54.460
that's so cool.

507
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.880
I wish I could just have one,

508
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.830
but it's not satisfying because you have one and then you want a hundred and

509
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.021
then,

510
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:02.330
and then you drink a hundred and then you feel like shit.

511
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.460
And like if I just drink one,

512
00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:05.810
like I've have one at lunch,

513
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.420
then it's like I want to go take a nap.

514
00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:09.370
Right?

515
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:09.471
Yeah.

516
00:15:09.471 --> 00:15:10.760
I either got to keep going.

517
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:11.780
If I keep going,

518
00:15:11.781 --> 00:15:12.650
I can go for like,

519
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.573
you know,

520
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:17.450
a good hardcore for or a gentleman six

521
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:20.443
and then I'm done.

522
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.681
But like,

523
00:15:21.681 --> 00:15:22.514
uh,

524
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.031
I,

525
00:15:23.031 --> 00:15:23.864
yeah,

526
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.250
I feel pulled to it.

527
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.110
No.

528
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.580
Is it like Gollum in the ring?

529
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:28.821
No,

530
00:15:28.821 --> 00:15:29.151
I just,

531
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:29.984
I don't know what that means.

532
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.823
I just,

533
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.193
I just like,

534
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:33.160
no,

535
00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:33.361
no,

536
00:15:33.361 --> 00:15:33.571
no,

537
00:15:33.571 --> 00:15:34.404
no,

538
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:35.230
no.

539
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:36.063
I like,

540
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.351
I don't even know what that is.

541
00:15:39.351 --> 00:15:41.240
I don't want to see the Lord of the rings.

542
00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:42.680
You didn't see that the Lord of the rings.

543
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.500
I went to one of those and it was so fucking long and every time they would,

544
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.900
they would fade to black.

545
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:48.411
I'd be like,

546
00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:49.400
just roll the credits,

547
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:50.953
roll the credits,

548
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.530
and then they would open up on some big field and it's just like Jesus,

549
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:58.010
get the fucking thing back to the guy so we can get out of here.

550
00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:59.630
I hate,

551
00:15:59.660 --> 00:15:59.841
I,

552
00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:00.171
you know what,

553
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:01.850
I fucking hate all of it.

554
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.260
And I fucking paid people who don't have a sense of humor about the bullshit

555
00:16:06.261 --> 00:16:08.450
that they watched when they were kids.

556
00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.030
Like adults who talk about star wars,

557
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:15.230
like that isn't a fucking movie now when you watch it,

558
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.740
I mean like how busy,

559
00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:17.583
terrible.

560
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:19.850
I was making fun the other night.

561
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.060
The other night I came home,

562
00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:22.310
I got,

563
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.790
I got,

564
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:23.720
I got free,

565
00:16:23.721 --> 00:16:23.960
uh,

566
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:24.860
free Cinemax,

567
00:16:24.861 --> 00:16:26.570
which is the greatest fucking channel ever.

568
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.430
They either w 24 hours a day.

569
00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:32.060
They're either showing the greatest movie ever or the worst fucking movie ever.

570
00:16:32.061 --> 00:16:35.510
And it's all compelling as I watch like nine movies in a row,

571
00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:36.470
like this fucking channels.

572
00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:37.304
Unbelievable.

573
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.830
So I ended up flipping up,

574
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:40.753
uh,

575
00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:41.991
cause late at night.

576
00:16:41.991 --> 00:16:42.890
They just had some sort of,

577
00:16:42.891 --> 00:16:43.150
you know,

578
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:43.941
softcore porn,

579
00:16:43.941 --> 00:16:45.560
which is ridiculous now when you have the Internet.

580
00:16:45.561 --> 00:16:46.550
So just was redundant.

581
00:16:46.551 --> 00:16:46.791
Sorry,

582
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:47.624
I got off of that.

583
00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.070
So I went on to VH one.

584
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:49.963
Uh,

585
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:50.350
and,

586
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:54.050
and they were playing this to show metal mania and I was watching all these

587
00:16:54.051 --> 00:16:57.260
bands and these videos that I just thought were fucking sick and they were

588
00:16:57.261 --> 00:16:57.471
injured.

589
00:16:57.471 --> 00:16:58.304
The devil dude,

590
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:59.760
I was just by the NFL.

591
00:16:59.761 --> 00:16:59.931
It's like,

592
00:16:59.931 --> 00:17:01.430
how was this better than disco?

593
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.740
Like why did disco gets so much shit?

594
00:17:03.741 --> 00:17:05.720
Like I'm not talking about like the iron maidens,

595
00:17:05.721 --> 00:17:06.554
the metallic,

596
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.090
but you know what I'm talking about?

597
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:09.440
That middle of the fucking ground,

598
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:14.590
those people with the spiked fucking gloves and all this stupid shit and raw

599
00:17:14.821 --> 00:17:15.890
meat and it was just,

600
00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:17.340
it was horse shit.

601
00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:18.470
It was fucking,

602
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:19.281
I watched it.

603
00:17:19.281 --> 00:17:20.480
It was the dumbest shit ever.

604
00:17:20.481 --> 00:17:21.560
It was embarrassing that I,

605
00:17:21.561 --> 00:17:22.630
I mean I moved,

606
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.910
granted I had all of that music still on my iPod.

607
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.691
I am not,

608
00:17:26.691 --> 00:17:27.524
I'm not above it.

609
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:28.401
But if someone were,

610
00:17:28.401 --> 00:17:31.730
were from this generation where to come back and tell me that music was awful

611
00:17:31.731 --> 00:17:32.564
and it was stupid,

612
00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.470
I would laugh.

613
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.831
There's like,

614
00:17:33.831 --> 00:17:35.420
there's no way I could defend it.

615
00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.800
<v 2>Isn't it weird how you look at,</v>

616
00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.030
like if you look at music or you look at movies,

617
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.600
that's like one of the clearest examples of like some sort of a evolution or

618
00:17:46.271 --> 00:17:49.550
progress is going on with humans because like the,

619
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.370
the movies

620
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:51.061
<v 1>of the past,</v>

621
00:17:51.061 --> 00:17:54.360
like so many of them are there are so clunky.

622
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:55.041
N the,

623
00:17:55.041 --> 00:17:55.201
the,

624
00:17:55.201 --> 00:17:55.441
the,

625
00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:55.681
the,

626
00:17:55.681 --> 00:17:58.980
the style of communicating is so artificial.

627
00:17:59.130 --> 00:17:59.963
It looks,

628
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:00.780
it's,

629
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.220
it's such a shit,

630
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:03.120
you know,

631
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.600
representation of life in comparison to a real good mood until the 60.

632
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:08.730
Once they figure it out,

633
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.073
you know,

634
00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.700
like just acting on film,

635
00:18:11.701 --> 00:18:13.380
like those people just learning how to do it.

636
00:18:13.381 --> 00:18:14.161
So everything was,

637
00:18:14.161 --> 00:18:16.890
was gonna be not wanting to talk to Tom Ferry.

638
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:17.260
Yeah.

639
00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:22.170
That type of acting had to go away with the Brando's and the James Deans and

640
00:18:22.171 --> 00:18:22.711
those guys.

641
00:18:22.711 --> 00:18:24.240
And then you had to have like the,

642
00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:24.930
uh,

643
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:25.631
there's a couple of,

644
00:18:25.631 --> 00:18:25.930
with like,

645
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.770
there's movies back there like Jack Lemmon,

646
00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:28.613
the apartment.

647
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.161
Well,

648
00:18:29.161 --> 00:18:32.680
the hustler is way ahead of his time that the hustler movie.

649
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.990
Stanley Kubrick.

650
00:18:33.991 --> 00:18:34.350
Yeah,

651
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:35.160
that type of shit.

652
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:35.881
There were some delays.

653
00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:37.010
It still holds up though.

654
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.380
But those were the bad movies from the 60s and the 70s you know,

655
00:18:40.381 --> 00:18:44.490
watch like try to wash like Jaws Three d oh yeah,

656
00:18:44.491 --> 00:18:44.701
no,

657
00:18:44.701 --> 00:18:45.030
that's good.

658
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:45.540
That's bad.

659
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.290
That's a bad one.

660
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:47.280
This was this a bad,

661
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.121
they've always had,

662
00:18:48.121 --> 00:18:49.260
they still have movies like sure.

663
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:49.770
I mean,

664
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.300
I think along the shore to this day,

665
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.530
that transformer shit,

666
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.490
even though I didn't see it,

667
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.770
but if you see and I never got,

668
00:18:54.771 --> 00:18:56.820
I never vibed with Scifi people,

669
00:18:56.821 --> 00:18:57.870
like Scifi listeners,

670
00:18:57.871 --> 00:18:59.760
I always get trashed by them because I just don't,

671
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:00.990
I just don't get it.

672
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.340
Unless you don't get Psi Phi at all.

673
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:02.750
No.

674
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.650
If it's like aliens,

675
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:07.260
like it has to be high quality like aliens.

676
00:19:07.261 --> 00:19:09.580
It's like the Goodfellas of that side.

677
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.270
I like on like top shelf Scifi.

678
00:19:12.271 --> 00:19:13.470
I'm going to be in the blade runner,

679
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:15.330
the aliens and that type of Shit,

680
00:19:15.331 --> 00:19:16.440
but if I'm just going to go watch,

681
00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:16.820
you know,

682
00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:17.180
oh we're,

683
00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.040
we're in hoth.

684
00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:18.440
I didn't,

685
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.440
what the fuck that's from?

686
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.191
What is hoth?

687
00:19:20.191 --> 00:19:20.431
Is that,

688
00:19:20.431 --> 00:19:21.480
that's a star wars thing.

689
00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:21.960
I don't know.

690
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.960
I don't know what that is.

691
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.210
Like one of those fucking things.

692
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:26.040
The action figures and shit.

693
00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:26.883
It's just,

694
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:28.530
did you like transformers?

695
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.761
I didn't like,

696
00:19:29.761 --> 00:19:33.690
I didn't like to Baka Baka Baka it's like,

697
00:19:33.691 --> 00:19:33.961
dude,

698
00:19:33.961 --> 00:19:35.880
you're a fucking fucking awesome guy to have around.

699
00:19:35.881 --> 00:19:36.714
He's huge.

700
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:37.060
Yeah.

701
00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.700
Imagine you can party with big foot.

702
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.670
I would totally party should be ripping somebody his arms off.

703
00:19:41.671 --> 00:19:42.570
He's shooting a gun.

704
00:19:42.571 --> 00:19:43.241
Like he's a fuck.

705
00:19:43.241 --> 00:19:43.651
He's like,

706
00:19:43.651 --> 00:19:43.980
he's,

707
00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.230
he's a bad ass limit is how to shoot guns too.

708
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:47.460
He'll rip the fucking arms off,

709
00:19:47.461 --> 00:19:49.050
but he can also shoot you from a distance.

710
00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:49.581
Bitch.

711
00:19:49.581 --> 00:19:50.430
She's limited.

712
00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:50.851
Oh,

713
00:19:50.851 --> 00:19:52.100
I liked you bought star wars.

714
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.300
I would totally hang out with,

715
00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:54.230
no,

716
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.990
I didn't like about him.

717
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:56.010
He was a follower.

718
00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.140
Well started.

719
00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.060
He started hanging out with all the humans and next thing he knows he's sitting

720
00:20:00.061 --> 00:20:00.451
up right.

721
00:20:00.451 --> 00:20:01.230
And shares.

722
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:01.591
Right,

723
00:20:01.591 --> 00:20:01.861
right.

724
00:20:01.861 --> 00:20:02.231
SIP it.

725
00:20:02.231 --> 00:20:03.400
A little juicy juices.

726
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.030
Yeah.

727
00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.050
I wonder if he can understand.

728
00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:07.801
He could,

729
00:20:07.801 --> 00:20:08.580
they understand him.

730
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:09.450
They could speak that.

731
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:11.930
I think it was a language,

732
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:13.530
but we just didn't understand it.

733
00:20:13.531 --> 00:20:15.930
So all that same fucking thing every time.

734
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.160
Not that many rookies.

735
00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:18.300
You know,

736
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.280
it's like Chewbacca and like there's no other famous what?

737
00:20:21.281 --> 00:20:22.830
He was like the Dodo bird.

738
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:23.803
Oh isn't that weird?

739
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.240
We're going to be destroyed on Twitter cause we are star wars knowledge suck

740
00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:28.243
<v 5>and</v>

741
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.020
there's a fucking million WorkKeys.

742
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:34.030
There is a nation of Lucky's.

743
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.370
There is a federation of low keys.

744
00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:37.541
You know,

745
00:20:37.541 --> 00:20:38.620
not what you're talking about.

746
00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:44.140
<v 1>There's nothing better than just having a fucking 10% knowledge of those rooms</v>

747
00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.890
criticizing them because it's just driving kid nuts.

748
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:52.930
<v 0>If you look at old TV shows like father knows best and then watch.</v>

749
00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:54.460
What's something good today?

750
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.400
Well the office or in is the office code.

751
00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:57.820
That's what you're supposed to say.

752
00:20:59.060 --> 00:20:59.860
Watched it.

753
00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:00.310
I think it's good.

754
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.760
I haven't,

755
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.440
I haven't watched a sitcom in years.

756
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.790
I haven't watched anything since.

757
00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:05.800
Maybe Larry Sanders.

758
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:07.420
I just watched sports.

759
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.100
Larry Sanders,

760
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:11.900
unless something huge happens.

761
00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:14.170
His name Larry David.

762
00:21:14.171 --> 00:21:14.900
Jesus clarity.

763
00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.840
I was watching some classic Seinfeld last night.

764
00:21:16.841 --> 00:21:18.590
That shit is fucking hell by the way.

765
00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.511
That was an awesome show.

766
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:20.111
Larry Sanders.

767
00:21:20.111 --> 00:21:21.430
I don't know why I pulled that out of my ass.

768
00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:22.270
Yeah,

769
00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.103
but yeah.

770
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:23.351
Yeah,

771
00:21:23.351 --> 00:21:23.831
it was amazing.

772
00:21:23.831 --> 00:21:24.850
Show Seinfeld,

773
00:21:24.851 --> 00:21:25.460
remember that?

774
00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.670
That episode where Elaine,

775
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.090
every time she went to the doctor,

776
00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:32.200
that doctor wrote down notes about her and then I only saw a few Seinfeld's

777
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:33.063
quite honestly,

778
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.190
maybe solid five or six of them ever for whatever reason.

779
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:40.420
Cause you were headlining and you were on a hit sitcom that was not on a hit

780
00:21:40.421 --> 00:21:41.020
sitcom.

781
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:46.020
I was on a sitcom that was like number 84 and the ratings when news radio was

782
00:21:46.331 --> 00:21:46.750
on,

783
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:47.770
it did terrible.

784
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.940
It was terrible in the ratings.

785
00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:49.280
Great.

786
00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.310
Did good when it was in good time slots.

787
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.270
But they moved us around nine times over five years.

788
00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.150
So there was nobody ever got cocky,

789
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.110
have you put I was like,

790
00:22:00.111 --> 00:22:00.310
yeah,

791
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.550
fuck.

792
00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:01.291
It was always that.

793
00:22:01.291 --> 00:22:04.840
There was always that good show that they just kept moving around and like the

794
00:22:04.841 --> 00:22:06.940
creators were like losing their fucking minds.

795
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:08.320
But you guys made syndication though,

796
00:22:08.321 --> 00:22:08.990
right?

797
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.531
I yeah,

798
00:22:09.531 --> 00:22:09.851
I did,

799
00:22:09.851 --> 00:22:10.481
but barely.

800
00:22:10.481 --> 00:22:11.141
It's Kinda funny.

801
00:22:11.141 --> 00:22:12.700
We only did 98 episodes.

802
00:22:12.701 --> 00:22:14.920
You're supposed to have a hundred for syndication.

803
00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.610
I'm pretty sure we only had 98 but how does that work?

804
00:22:18.611 --> 00:22:20.680
Do you get checks now for like 3 cents?

805
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:21.431
Does it still work?

806
00:22:21.431 --> 00:22:22.540
Like it was a halfway decent?

807
00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:24.210
No,

808
00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:25.043
that's okay.

809
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:25.961
The people,

810
00:22:25.961 --> 00:22:27.370
people think you get really rich from it.

811
00:22:27.371 --> 00:22:29.200
The people that get rich from it are the people that own it.

812
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.180
So if they say if you all in the show and you sell it,

813
00:22:31.181 --> 00:22:32.540
but like the actors there,

814
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.030
they're going to get compensated.

815
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:36.310
They get compensated very well.

816
00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.680
But it's not like a,

817
00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:39.500
but a show runner make.

818
00:22:39.501 --> 00:22:41.470
So when people see like oh he's on syndication,

819
00:22:41.471 --> 00:22:42.250
he's rich.

820
00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:42.640
No,

821
00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.930
not necessarily at all.

822
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.840
Cause it seems like the stuff I do the first time you get paid,

823
00:22:46.841 --> 00:22:47.674
it's great.

824
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.430
Next time they cut it in half on the second running and then all of a sudden

825
00:22:51.431 --> 00:22:55.090
then you start getting checks for a dollar 30 but when you Tim Allen or someone

826
00:22:55.091 --> 00:22:56.530
like that who has a home improvement,

827
00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.120
then you know he owns,

828
00:22:58.121 --> 00:23:01.180
I'm sure he must have owned a chunk of that show.

829
00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:03.910
So when that shit goes to syndication you just fuck it,

830
00:23:03.911 --> 00:23:04.744
rake it in.

831
00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:05.950
It was worth it for him,

832
00:23:05.951 --> 00:23:08.260
I guess to stop doing standup for a long time.

833
00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.620
I know I shouldn't speak out of turn because I don't know if this is really

834
00:23:11.621 --> 00:23:11.861
true.

835
00:23:11.861 --> 00:23:13.990
This is just what I had heard was that Tim Allen,

836
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.270
who was a very good stand up,

837
00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:16.630
you ever watched him?

838
00:23:16.631 --> 00:23:17.464
Alan back in the day.

839
00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.960
That's what I heard was a very good stand up and a,

840
00:23:19.961 --> 00:23:20.501
you know,

841
00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:21.760
a fun guy to watch.

842
00:23:21.761 --> 00:23:23.170
He was fun and,

843
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:23.710
but he's,

844
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.480
his show was like just a little rowdy,

845
00:23:25.481 --> 00:23:25.781
you know,

846
00:23:25.781 --> 00:23:26.501
just not,

847
00:23:26.501 --> 00:23:27.131
not dirty.

848
00:23:27.131 --> 00:23:27.611
Not really.

849
00:23:27.611 --> 00:23:27.821
You know,

850
00:23:27.821 --> 00:23:30.400
it wasn't like a Kennison or anything like that,

851
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:31.181
but I guess,

852
00:23:31.181 --> 00:23:31.570
uh,

853
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:32.590
it was too,

854
00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.600
too rowdy for the show.

855
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.451
And they were saying,

856
00:23:35.451 --> 00:23:35.621
you know,

857
00:23:35.621 --> 00:23:35.831
look,

858
00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:38.050
you're going to be on home improvement.

859
00:23:38.051 --> 00:23:38.230
You know,

860
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.300
you should turn that shit down and you should,

861
00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:41.470
you should stop performing.

862
00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.513
Right.

863
00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.420
You're out there and you,

864
00:23:43.421 --> 00:23:43.571
you know,

865
00:23:43.571 --> 00:23:46.010
you're saying crazy things about drills and hammers

866
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.281
<v 1>and you know,</v>

867
00:23:46.281 --> 00:23:47.320
you're going to get us in trouble.

868
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.390
So it's probably wasn't the shit about the drills and hammers.

869
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.400
I imagined it was a shit about jail.

870
00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.740
Fucking Michigan or whatever.

871
00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:55.851
That's all it was.

872
00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:56.180
Coke.

873
00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:56.451
Yeah.

874
00:23:56.451 --> 00:23:57.051
That I would want,

875
00:23:57.051 --> 00:23:57.884
I would want to hear.

876
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.431
Yeah,

877
00:23:58.431 --> 00:23:59.450
well that was a weird thing when I,

878
00:23:59.451 --> 00:24:00.530
when you hear about that,

879
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.861
they like,

880
00:24:00.861 --> 00:24:01.510
well you could,

881
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:03.230
you go to jail and then wind up on TV.

882
00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:04.730
That's pretty fucking bad ass.

883
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:04.971
No.

884
00:24:04.971 --> 00:24:06.350
When you get out of jail is to,

885
00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.960
you get into sales or show business.

886
00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:10.940
Those are the only two places they don't give a fuck.

887
00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:12.020
I had to guy up,

888
00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:12.860
well,

889
00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:13.071
you know,

890
00:24:13.071 --> 00:24:15.570
do like five bring up the next year.

891
00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.360
It was a dude that we knew from Rhode Island that Peter got at death with a

892
00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.213
stick.

893
00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.850
I'm just thinking about this car right now.

894
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.100
Do you,

895
00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.410
did you know Eddie Galvin?

896
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.140
<v 6>Okay.</v>

897
00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:26.561
<v 1>Uh,</v>

898
00:24:26.561 --> 00:24:26.980
no.

899
00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:27.880
From Rhode Island.

900
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.580
What was he gone by the time you were,

901
00:24:30.581 --> 00:24:31.060
uh,

902
00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.500
you were coming around Galvin?

903
00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.010
Yeah.

904
00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:34.870
I would remember the guy if he get beat to death.

905
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.311
No,

906
00:24:35.311 --> 00:24:35.410
no,

907
00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:35.531
no.

908
00:24:35.531 --> 00:24:36.370
He didn't get beat to death.

909
00:24:36.371 --> 00:24:37.360
He beat the guy to death.

910
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.530
Oh,

911
00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:38.920
heckler.

912
00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.270
I'm sure I'm saying his name right.

913
00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:41.900
<v 6>Okay.</v>

914
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.400
<v 1>Who was a really funny guy though.</v>

915
00:24:43.401 --> 00:24:45.560
He was one of those Brian Holtzman type guys.

916
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:46.490
There was just like,

917
00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.420
comics would be like,

918
00:24:47.421 --> 00:24:49.790
get into the back of the room to watch him when he would go on stage and just

919
00:24:49.791 --> 00:24:49.971
go,

920
00:24:49.971 --> 00:24:51.760
Jesus fucking Christ.

921
00:24:51.761 --> 00:24:54.020
And he just say that he was a crazy dude.

922
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.420
Who did he beat to death?

923
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.593
Some guy.

924
00:24:59.310 --> 00:24:59.931
The story.

925
00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:00.740
I Dunno.

926
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:01.573
I Dunno what happened.

927
00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:03.620
I might not even be right.

928
00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.410
Jesus.

929
00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:05.690
What did,

930
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:08.900
what did you smoke before this random?

931
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:09.171
No,

932
00:25:09.171 --> 00:25:10.710
I'm just saying it doesn't even know if that happened.

933
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.510
You just started a Rhode Island in this whole movie started playing in your

934
00:25:14.511 --> 00:25:14.900
head.

935
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.640
What's a fighting people beating people to death.

936
00:25:16.641 --> 00:25:19.020
What's a famous movie that was shot in Rhode Island with some,

937
00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:19.940
it gets beat to death.

938
00:25:19.941 --> 00:25:21.380
I bet that's just playing in his head.

939
00:25:21.381 --> 00:25:22.100
Right.

940
00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.030
That's what he's remembering.

941
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:24.890
You ever see a friends of Eddie Coyle?

942

Yeah.

948
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.350

Yes.

952
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:35.401
Peter.

953
00:25:35.401 --> 00:25:35.551
Uh,

954
00:25:35.551 --> 00:25:36.110

Yeah.

958

I just saw that in the past year.

959
00:25:39.261 --> 00:25:40.730
All of a sudden like resurfaced.

960
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:43.250
Peter Boyle was a fucking amazing actor.

961
00:25:43.251 --> 00:25:44.780
Holy Shit was that guy could,

962
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:46.190
that's a great movie.

963
00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.050
That is a really good movie.

964
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:49.160
I like those kinds of movies.

965
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:52.010
That's the kind of shit I still like if I buy something on DVD,

966
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.470
I'm going to buy like the dirty dozen.

967
00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:55.251
Yeah.

968
00:25:55.251 --> 00:25:56.900
Magnificent seven like that era.

969
00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:00.440
You know what I bought the other day Lamont's with Steve McQueen.

970
00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:00.860
Yeah.

971
00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:01.730
God Damn.

972
00:26:01.731 --> 00:26:03.530
That's how you used to come out once a year.

973
00:26:03.531 --> 00:26:08.531
They would play that on either TV 38 or Wl VI channel 56 I was saying this shit

974
00:26:10.011 --> 00:26:11.540
cause I know you grew up that area and I up.

975
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:12.800
That's why I watched all those guys,

976
00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:14.530
all that Bronson Lean,

977
00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:15.373
Marvin,

978
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.980
uh,

979
00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:16.910
Clint Eastwood,

980
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:17.721
all of that Shit.

981
00:26:17.721 --> 00:26:21.050
And it was on a rotation the same time every year that they would play like the

982
00:26:21.051 --> 00:26:21.890
eight o'clock movie.

983
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:23.270
Steve McQueen.

984
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.370
Did you ever watch it?

985
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:25.340
You've seen the Mons?

986
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:25.820
Yeah.

987
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.580
There was like parts in that movie for like,

988
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:29.690
Oh like five,

989
00:26:29.691 --> 00:26:30.410
10 minutes.

990
00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:30.621
We're,

991
00:26:30.621 --> 00:26:31.700
no one said a word.

992
00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:32.330
Yeah.

993
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:33.410
For like 10 minutes.

994
00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:34.550
Like you watched the movie,

995
00:26:34.551 --> 00:26:35.061
they're changing,

996
00:26:35.061 --> 00:26:36.740
tires are setting things up.

997
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:38.030
People go and get a cup of coffee.

998
00:26:38.031 --> 00:26:39.170
All this shit is chicken place.

999
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.700
No one's talking at all.

1000
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:41.960
They're like wow,

1001
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:43.890
this is like a era.

1002
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.210
It's a different world.

1003
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:45.421
Yeah.

1004
00:26:45.421 --> 00:26:48.780
That's when the directors took over the world of like Stanley Kubrick,

1005
00:26:48.781 --> 00:26:53.340
you know the world of 2001 a space before that whole movement happened that back

1006
00:26:53.341 --> 00:26:53.881
in the day,

1007
00:26:53.881 --> 00:26:55.980
like at the director,

1008
00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:59.910
all the director did for the most part was just make sure that you were in frame

1009
00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.460
that you said everything you said.

1010
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.380
And in the second you wrapped on the movie,

1011
00:27:04.381 --> 00:27:07.050
the studio took it and they edited the thing.

1012
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:08.160
Wow.

1013
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.270
And it wasn't until,

1014
00:27:09.271 --> 00:27:09.661
uh,

1015
00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:10.220
I dunno,

1016
00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.910
I'm really speaking out attorney cause I don't,

1017
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.310
I know about as much about this as I do about star wars.

1018
00:27:14.311 --> 00:27:17.790
But like somewhere in the 60s is when the director started taking over going

1019
00:27:17.791 --> 00:27:17.941
like,

1020
00:27:17.941 --> 00:27:18.061
no,

1021
00:27:18.061 --> 00:27:19.290
this is my fucking film.

1022
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.960
I'm going to edit this and we want to do it this way.

1023
00:27:21.961 --> 00:27:24.330
That was sort of the first wave of that.

1024
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.200
And when that happened,

1025
00:27:25.201 --> 00:27:26.580
that's when you had all the uh,

1026
00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:28.140
dust on apocalypse now.

1027
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:28.770
Yeah.

1028
00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:28.861
Oh,

1029
00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:29.460
that was sort of the,

1030
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:29.710
the,

1031
00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:31.890
that the lady that was 10 years after.

1032
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:33.413
But that kind of,

1033
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:34.920
that kind of movie,

1034
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.000
that's where that comes from.

1035
00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:36.480
And that,

1036
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.313
that was like,

1037
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.120
that during that time,

1038
00:27:39.121 --> 00:27:40.590
like art was ridiculous.

1039
00:27:40.591 --> 00:27:41.131
The music,

1040
00:27:41.131 --> 00:27:42.670
you have the tail end of the Beatles going on,

1041
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:44.340
those directors we've taken over and then,

1042
00:27:44.341 --> 00:27:44.581
you know,

1043
00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:48.180
Richard Pryor was like finding his voice and like stand up was coming out to the

1044
00:27:48.181 --> 00:27:48.630
forefront.

1045
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:50.280
Like that whole error in uh,

1046
00:27:50.281 --> 00:27:51.600
in artists is incredible,

1047
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.101
but it's funny.

1048
00:27:53.101 --> 00:27:53.881
But then they just,

1049
00:27:53.881 --> 00:27:54.121
you know,

1050
00:27:54.121 --> 00:27:55.140
that 70 show,

1051
00:27:55.141 --> 00:27:57.060
they just boil it down to like lava lamps.

1052
00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:00.960
It was a little more interesting shit going on back then.

1053
00:28:00.961 --> 00:28:01.150
And I,

1054
00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:01.380
I mean,

1055
00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:01.740
I know,

1056
00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.090
I know it's just a sitcom,

1057
00:28:03.091 --> 00:28:03.924
but I'm just saying,

1058
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.430
you know,

1059
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:09.750
they do the early seventies is Nixon resigning and the late seventies is

1060
00:28:09.751 --> 00:28:10.650
everybody doing coke,

1061
00:28:10.651 --> 00:28:11.970
listening to disco and then like,

1062
00:28:11.971 --> 00:28:14.670
well that's that decade now we're into the 80s.

1063
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.120
How about Michael J j Fox picture.

1064
00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.800
I remember when Nixon was president.

1065
00:28:19.801 --> 00:28:20.634
Do you remember?

1066
00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:22.410
And then when I was a kid,

1067
00:28:22.411 --> 00:28:27.411
listen to him crying on the radio when he stepped down first Kent State and then

1068
00:28:27.601 --> 00:28:28.434
Watergate.

1069
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:33.490
Like has there ever been a more fucked up crooked guy shooting at fucking

1070
00:28:34.081 --> 00:28:35.240
college students?

1071
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.140
Is that Johnson was an opposite.

1072
00:28:37.141 --> 00:28:37.651
Oh no,

1073
00:28:37.651 --> 00:28:38.484
that was the extent.

1074
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.091
Those next,

1075
00:28:39.091 --> 00:28:40.440
well he wasn't there with the rifles was,

1076
00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:41.980
he probably was.

1077
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.780
It was probably his idea was son of a bitch.

1078
00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:48.570
He probably wanted us to silence these fucking punk kids.

1079
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.090
Nixon was a creepy dude,

1080
00:28:51.091 --> 00:28:51.480
man.

1081
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.860
He was the fact that you were,

1082
00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:57.420
you're so paranoid that you fucking record yourself having conversations.

1083
00:28:57.421 --> 00:28:57.711
Like what?

1084
00:28:57.711 --> 00:28:59.190
What you thought was going to happen to you?

1085
00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:02.280
I think losing to Jack Kennedy just fucked with his head.

1086
00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:03.150
Yeah.

1087
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:06.360
Cause I guess he blew him away in the debates on the radio.

1088
00:29:06.361 --> 00:29:07.650
But if you watched it on TV,

1089
00:29:07.651 --> 00:29:09.450
Jack was sitting there looking like a movie star,

1090
00:29:09.451 --> 00:29:10.800
looking like fucking Tony Curtis.

1091
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.890
He's sitting there looking like some guy waiting to get his teeth cleaned.

1092
00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.180
It is true.

1093
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:20.520
People will vote for looks.

1094
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:20.850
No.

1095
00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:24.750
He went from almost winning the presidency to his entire career being fucking

1096
00:29:24.751 --> 00:29:25.584
over.

1097
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:30.620
He then lost I think the governor race or something like that in California and

1098
00:29:31.261 --> 00:29:33.600
he was completely out of office and they were like,

1099
00:29:33.601 --> 00:29:34.111
that's it.

1100
00:29:34.111 --> 00:29:34.681
Game set,

1101
00:29:34.681 --> 00:29:36.090
match and like within four years,

1102
00:29:36.091 --> 00:29:36.930
I don't know what happened.

1103
00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.580
He signed a deal with the devil.

1104
00:29:38.581 --> 00:29:40.080
That guy was an in office.

1105
00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:40.860
What?

1106
00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.220
Lyndon Johnson was growing

1107
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.920
<v 4>his hair going crazy and Nixon slid in.</v>

1108
00:29:44.921 --> 00:29:46.300
Bobby Kennedy got whacked.

1109
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:49.660
There's a kill you that they just fucking knocked down the ambassador hotel.

1110
00:29:49.661 --> 00:29:51.460
Like they just don't give a fuck about history out here.

1111
00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:53.140
I was in Dallas.

1112
00:29:53.141 --> 00:29:55.470
They would have like an entire like w like the entire

1113
00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.810
<v 1>block would be preserved.</v>

1114
00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.280
Do you think it's an embarrassment?

1115
00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:02.060
You think that's what they knocked it down because that's what Kennedy was shot?

1116
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.411
<v 4>No,</v>

1117
00:30:02.411 --> 00:30:03.760
cause they think they do with everything.

1118
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:06.100
I find it frustrating out here because a I,

1119
00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:06.361
it's,

1120
00:30:06.361 --> 00:30:10.310
it's very hard to feel grounded out here with just the end.

1121
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:12.010
Endless like strip malls.

1122
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.140
If there's like a piece of history,

1123
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.430
there's a way to be like,

1124
00:30:15.431 --> 00:30:15.761
okay,

1125
00:30:15.761 --> 00:30:19.180
this is from then and this is what happened and then this happened and now we're

1126
00:30:19.181 --> 00:30:19.640
here.

1127
00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:23.000
<v 1>This is the steakhouse where John Gadi shot Paul Castillo.</v>

1128
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:23.930
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1129
00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:24.221
Shit.

1130
00:30:24.221 --> 00:30:25.001
Like in New York,

1131
00:30:25.001 --> 00:30:27.820
the triangle shirtwaist fire and they got a little plaque,

1132
00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.020
they got all that shit.

1133
00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.070
You can kind of be like right.

1134
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:32.320
There's a bunch of native Americans buried under here.

1135
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:36.160
The Astors got a bunch of blood money and now they have a subway stop named

1136
00:30:36.161 --> 00:30:37.540
after him Cooper Union,

1137
00:30:37.541 --> 00:30:38.201
that type of shit.

1138
00:30:38.201 --> 00:30:38.451
But you,

1139
00:30:38.451 --> 00:30:40.090
you're out here and it's just like a,

1140
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:43.210
you know like they had like you know before nine 11 like the big,

1141
00:30:43.211 --> 00:30:44.680
the biggest like act of terrorism,

1142
00:30:44.681 --> 00:30:45.041
like you know,

1143
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:45.851
blown up a building,

1144
00:30:45.851 --> 00:30:50.770
people jumping to their death and shit was the first La Times building and it's

1145
00:30:50.771 --> 00:30:51.730
not the one that's there.

1146
00:30:51.731 --> 00:30:55.090
If somebody blew it up at like two in the morning at the turn of the century and

1147
00:30:55.091 --> 00:30:55.391
there's not,

1148
00:30:55.391 --> 00:30:57.880
I can't find it on the fucking Internet where it was,

1149
00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:58.961
I don't know what's there.

1150
00:30:58.961 --> 00:30:59.800
There's no plaque,

1151
00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:00.730
there is no nothing.

1152
00:31:00.731 --> 00:31:01.400
Go Fuck you.

1153
00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.830
<v 1>Self burn down his the new one.</v>

1154
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:04.641
Wow.

1155
00:31:04.641 --> 00:31:05.300
And that's it.

1156
00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.133
Yeah.

1157
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.771
Yeah,

1158
00:31:06.771 --> 00:31:07.221
that's true.

1159
00:31:07.221 --> 00:31:09.110
There's not much of a sense of history here.

1160
00:31:09.111 --> 00:31:11.060
I mean there's like the Chinese theater,

1161
00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:11.601
right?

1162
00:31:11.601 --> 00:31:12.470
That's the big thing.

1163
00:31:12.471 --> 00:31:13.790
Mann's Chinese theater.

1164
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:14.833
That's like a lounge,

1165
00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:16.150
<v 4>that ambassador hotel.</v>

1166
00:31:16.151 --> 00:31:18.670
I guarantee you there's like a burger king sitting on top of it.

1167
00:31:18.671 --> 00:31:20.110
They don't give you a staples.

1168
00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:21.281
It's just,

1169
00:31:21.281 --> 00:31:21.730
I dunno,

1170
00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:23.430
that's the one thing out here that I,

1171
00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.190
I uh,

1172
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:25.350
that fucks

1173
00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:25.641
<v 1>me.</v>

1174
00:31:25.641 --> 00:31:27.650
After a while we filmed fear factor there.

1175
00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.360
We filmed an episode there.

1176
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.890
I remember being weirded out.

1177
00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:33.690
You went to it and I never went.

1178
00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:35.240
I walked through the kitchen.

1179
00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:40.540
I walked through where he got shot and what was going on at that time was it,

1180
00:31:40.581 --> 00:31:41.650
was it shut down?

1181
00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:42.320
Well,

1182
00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:42.771
it's a,

1183
00:31:42.771 --> 00:31:43.880
they rented out to,

1184
00:31:43.881 --> 00:31:48.050
for filming the rented out to people make movies there and they were there were

1185
00:31:48.051 --> 00:31:48.940
making TV shows.

1186
00:31:48.941 --> 00:31:49.140
How,

1187
00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:49.371
how,

1188
00:31:49.371 --> 00:31:49.830
how,

1189
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:51.170
how creepy was that?

1190
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.841
I would have loved it.

1191
00:31:51.841 --> 00:31:52.674
It was bizarre.

1192
00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.013
I wish I had known.

1193
00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:54.321
I wish.

1194
00:31:54.321 --> 00:31:55.460
I don't think I knew you then.

1195
00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.860
But if I had known or you weren't here,

1196
00:31:57.861 --> 00:31:59.090
then I think I was living in New York.

1197
00:31:59.260 --> 00:31:59.991
I had met you,

1198
00:31:59.991 --> 00:32:00.690
but if you,

1199
00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:01.040
if I,

1200
00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:01.251
yeah,

1201
00:32:01.251 --> 00:32:03.470
if I knew someone was like a crazy Kennedy freak,

1202
00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:04.200
that's a no,

1203
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:04.291
no.

1204
00:32:04.291 --> 00:32:05.091
Just a history,

1205
00:32:05.091 --> 00:32:06.090
like that type of stuff.

1206
00:32:06.091 --> 00:32:06.770
But I mean that,

1207
00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:06.941
that,

1208
00:32:06.941 --> 00:32:07.411
but that's the,

1209
00:32:07.411 --> 00:32:07.581
I'm like,

1210
00:32:07.581 --> 00:32:07.791
come on,

1211
00:32:07.791 --> 00:32:07.911
man.

1212
00:32:07.911 --> 00:32:08.744
That's like,

1213
00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.550
did you ever go through that place in Dallas too?

1214
00:32:10.551 --> 00:32:12.440
Have you ever driven through Dealey Plaza?

1215
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:13.191
Weird,

1216
00:32:13.191 --> 00:32:13.421
right?

1217
00:32:13.421 --> 00:32:13.520
Yeah.

1218
00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:13.791
<v 4>No,</v>

1219
00:32:13.791 --> 00:32:14.351
it was that,

1220
00:32:14.351 --> 00:32:15.111
that was too much.

1221
00:32:15.111 --> 00:32:16.010
They preserve the,

1222
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:18.470
you feel like it's weird that you're not in black

1223
00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.180
<v 1>as you're walking around.</v>

1224
00:32:21.181 --> 00:32:21.361
I mean,

1225
00:32:21.361 --> 00:32:22.070
they literally,

1226
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.730
if you've never been there to your listeners,

1227
00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:27.180
the entire block is this just watch,

1228
00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:29.070
was it this of the film?

1229
00:32:29.071 --> 00:32:29.221
Yeah.

1230
00:32:29.221 --> 00:32:30.054
That's the one in color.

1231
00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:30.601
You're going to,

1232
00:32:30.601 --> 00:32:31.560
you're going to see,

1233
00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:32.701
you're going to,

1234
00:32:32.701 --> 00:32:33.720
you're going to see those buildings.

1235
00:32:33.721 --> 00:32:34.770
I mean at the same color.

1236
00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:35.963
The whole thing.

1237
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:36.571
Yeah.

1238
00:32:36.571 --> 00:32:36.991
It's a,

1239
00:32:36.991 --> 00:32:40.130
it's a real mind fuck to cause a block away.

1240
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:44.600
It's 2012 and you go there and it's November,

1241
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.150
1963 bill hicks had a great fucking choke about that place.

1242
00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:47.900
He goes,

1243
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:48.260
uh,

1244
00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:52.580
you go to the up to the book depository and he goes and I try to do a Bill Hicks

1245
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:53.210
accident.

1246
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:53.901
And he goes,

1247
00:32:53.901 --> 00:32:54.200
uh,

1248
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:59.200
and they have it marked off and it looks exactly the way it did in 1960.

1249
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:00.651
What was it?

1250
00:33:00.651 --> 00:33:01.490
Three you got shot?

1251
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:03.540
He 1963 no.

1252
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:04.070
Why?

1253
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:05.430
Cause Oswald's not in there

1254
00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:09.920
as well as not there either.

1255
00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:11.750
That's hilarious.

1256
00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.231
He goes,

1257
00:33:12.231 --> 00:33:14.810
they don't let you look out the window as he walks in.

1258
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.171
Oh,

1259
00:33:15.171 --> 00:33:16.310
so I'm the patsy.

1260
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:20.020
That's the one that always sends a chill baby.

1261
00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:20.841
You don't do it.

1262
00:33:20.841 --> 00:33:22.000
I think everything is bullshit.

1263
00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.570
I think the is fixed.

1264
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.681
That's what we are.

1265
00:33:24.681 --> 00:33:25.331
Most things.

1266
00:33:25.331 --> 00:33:27.050
So most obvious pieces of bullshit.

1267
00:33:27.051 --> 00:33:27.884
And you know what site?

1268
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:29.930
Some fucking sports are fixed,

1269
00:33:29.931 --> 00:33:30.620
man.

1270
00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:31.800
That's reality now.

1271
00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:32.643
It's a lot of money.

1272
00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:33.980
Eight the NBA had a mop.

1273
00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:34.290
<v 4>Yup.</v>

1274
00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:35.123
Ref.

1275
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:39.480
And then they did an inhouse investigation and then they did the Oswald acted

1276
00:33:39.481 --> 00:33:40.200
alone.

1277
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.220
Nothing to see here.

1278
00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:42.241
And they found,

1279
00:33:42.241 --> 00:33:43.110
how'd they catch the guy?

1280
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:44.733
Um,

1281
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:48.980
<v 1>how did they get to that a Ferrari?</v>

1282
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:50.061
You know what?

1283
00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:50.990
I don't even know.

1284
00:33:50.991 --> 00:33:52.060
I just get the number

1285
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.440
<v 4>came on the news and you know,</v>

1286
00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:57.750
all gamblers were all yelling.

1287
00:33:57.751 --> 00:33:58.950
I fucking know it.

1288
00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:00.263
I know it.

1289
00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:03.000
I knew this shit was fixed and um,

1290
00:34:03.001 --> 00:34:05.110
then they tried to say it was just him and I,

1291
00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:05.550
you know,

1292
00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:06.720
I'm not saying they all are,

1293
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.190
I'm just saying like,

1294
00:34:08.191 --> 00:34:08.610
look,

1295
00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:10.200
I always compare it to this like,

1296
00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:10.981
like,

1297
00:34:10.981 --> 00:34:11.250
dude,

1298
00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:12.930
remember when you had a day job and shit,

1299
00:34:12.931 --> 00:34:15.240
if two people were hooking up on the Diallo,

1300
00:34:15.241 --> 00:34:18.240
how long did it take you to figure they thought nobody knew.

1301
00:34:18.241 --> 00:34:19.710
You could tell by their body language.

1302
00:34:19.711 --> 00:34:20.940
You could tell what the fuck they were doing.

1303
00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:25.880
You can't tell me you on an NBA officiating team and you can't tell somebody is

1304
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:26.970
fixing games.

1305
00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:27.961
How many times?

1306
00:34:27.961 --> 00:34:28.171
Okay,

1307
00:34:28.171 --> 00:34:29.210
it was kind of weird tonight.

1308
00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.590
Then he's weird again and then weird again.

1309
00:34:31.591 --> 00:34:32.520
All of a sudden you've gotta be like,

1310
00:34:32.521 --> 00:34:33.680
this guy is a,

1311
00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:37.110
I don't know if you're sitting in the crowd and you could notice.

1312
00:34:37.111 --> 00:34:39.900
I just don't think another professional referee can't notice.

1313
00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:42.420
I think it's they're investigating it right now.

1314
00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:43.920
I heard one guy.

1315
00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:44.760
Yeah.

1316
00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:45.181
Well,

1317
00:34:45.181 --> 00:34:45.541
I mean,

1318
00:34:45.541 --> 00:34:45.690
no,

1319
00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:46.560
we already went to jail.

1320
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:47.430
He's already in jail.

1321
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:48.263
Oh,

1322
00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.000
they already talking about the pack fight in your mind.

1323
00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:51.541
<v 1>Oh No,</v>

1324
00:34:51.541 --> 00:34:51.690
no,

1325
00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:51.821
no,

1326
00:34:51.821 --> 00:34:51.961
no,

1327
00:34:51.961 --> 00:34:52.111
no.

1328
00:34:52.111 --> 00:34:53.100
We weren't talking about that,

1329
00:34:53.101 --> 00:34:54.150
but we've gone to,

1330
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:55.980
I was going to ask you,

1331
00:34:55.981 --> 00:34:59.130
what do you think about Pacquiao Bradley was that fixed?

1332
00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.760
That was the worst decision I've ever seen in the history of boxing.

1333
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:04.290
Never seen such a bad decision.

1334
00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:05.111
<v 4>I didn't watch it,</v>

1335
00:35:05.111 --> 00:35:05.770
but here's my,

1336
00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:06.580
my,

1337
00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.110
I don't know shit about the fight game,

1338
00:35:08.111 --> 00:35:09.130
believe it or not to look at me.

1339
00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.600
I don't know anything about it,

1340
00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:16.600
but I find it amazing that someone could come in at his light of weight,

1341
00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:18.610
put on 40 pounds,

1342
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:20.320
not lose any speed,

1343
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:21.910
be actually be stronger.

1344
00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:22.711
Like I don't know how,

1345
00:35:22.711 --> 00:35:23.544
how do you do that?

1346
00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:24.500
<v 1>I don't know Ma.</v>

1347
00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:25.693
Okay.

1348
00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:26.331
No Man.

1349
00:35:26.331 --> 00:35:27.450
You got to talk to him about all,

1350
00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.430
<v 4>I would never,</v>

1351
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:29.680
never that guy he did,

1352
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:33.880
he'd had button me than sing me a song and then wait for me to wake up and kick

1353
00:35:33.881 --> 00:35:34.231
the shit out.

1354
00:35:34.231 --> 00:35:34.541
I'm again.

1355
00:35:34.541 --> 00:35:34.810
Right.

1356
00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:35.800
What do you need explosives?

1357
00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:36.880
Looking for my phone.

1358
00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:38.070
Oh,

1359
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.970
<v 2>did you leave it in the bathroom?</v>

1360
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:39.301
No,

1361
00:35:39.301 --> 00:35:39.750
that was what,

1362
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:40.740
that's what I was worried about it.

1363
00:35:40.741 --> 00:35:41.574
I'm sorry.

1364
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:42.413
I panicked

1365
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:44.813
<v 1>I think.</v>

1366
00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:45.663
I think uh,

1367
00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:47.290
yeah,

1368
00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:49.570
I think the NBA is just as filthy as boxing.

1369
00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.040
<v 2>Do you?</v>

1370
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:50.660
What did you,

1371
00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:51.970
did you watch the boxing match?

1372
00:35:51.971 --> 00:35:53.560
Did you see the packout Bradley fine?

1373
00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.633
No I didn't,

1374
00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:55.780
but I've watched boxing.

1375
00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:56.621
I see what happens.

1376
00:35:56.621 --> 00:35:58.150
The only fight where I've never,

1377
00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:03.250
I've never heard of a fight before where I haven't met a single person that

1378
00:36:03.251 --> 00:36:04.360
thought Bradley one,

1379
00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.860
not one person.

1380
00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:07.120
I mean they must be out.

1381
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.730
<v 1>So what's the reason for doing it?</v>

1382
00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.930
Took to just make a bunch of money on a rematch made for a rematch cause they

1383
00:36:12.931 --> 00:36:14.070
don't think Mayweather's going to happen.

1384
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.070
Yes.

1385
00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:16.110
Mayweather's in jail right now.

1386
00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:16.560
Yeah.

1387
00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.330
And look if I eating.

1388
00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:18.660
Yeah.

1389
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.230
From what I heard.

1390
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:20.040
Oh really?

1391
00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.200
Like go on and look a hunger strike.

1392
00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:23.251
Yeah.

1393
00:36:23.251 --> 00:36:24.670
Like let me out of here.

1394
00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:25.610
I'm not going to,

1395
00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:26.713
I'm going to die.

1396
00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:27.803
Oh I can tell.

1397
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:28.651
Look Real.

1398
00:36:28.651 --> 00:36:30.060
I have an am radio in my truck.

1399
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:33.960
I went under a bridge halfway through that story.

1400
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:38.103
I don't know.

1401
00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:39.693
I don't know.

1402
00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:41.200
That's hilarious.

1403
00:36:41.201 --> 00:36:42.500
That's what it sounded like.

1404
00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:44.490
Cause cause the,

1405
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:44.721
the,

1406
00:36:44.721 --> 00:36:46.330
the prosecuting attorney was like,

1407
00:36:46.331 --> 00:36:47.010
well what do you think?

1408
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:47.801
He's in prison.

1409
00:36:47.801 --> 00:36:49.000
This isn't the four seasons.

1410
00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:54.130
Well see this is how rumors get started in bars by shit heads like me who have

1411
00:36:54.131 --> 00:36:56.680
like fucking half the information they need and then they just start

1412
00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:01.690
pontificating to some on the Internet who's taken a couple of hits and then

1413
00:37:01.691 --> 00:37:02.524
you'll back me up.

1414
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.961
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1415
00:37:02.961 --> 00:37:03.794
totally.

1416
00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:04.280
Dude.

1417
00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:04.901
I'm telling you,

1418
00:37:04.901 --> 00:37:06.650
I said I'm just happy to be in the conversation.

1419
00:37:06.651 --> 00:37:07.484
Yeah Dude.

1420
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.821
Yeah,

1421
00:37:07.821 --> 00:37:09.800
I bet that's exactly how they did it there.

1422
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:12.860
You need to listen to the first half of it because you're freaking out about

1423
00:37:12.861 --> 00:37:13.694
your phone.

1424
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.790
Well Bob,

1425
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:21.320
I know that Bob Arum and Floyd Mayweather did not get along and Bob Arum was

1426
00:37:21.321 --> 00:37:24.680
Pascal's promoter and Floyd may with a tried to make some sort of a deal with

1427
00:37:24.681 --> 00:37:28.790
them but he didn't want to do 50 50 like they were having a hard time bargaining

1428
00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:29.803
it out.

1429
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:34.930
But if I was a promoter and I was a crooked guy and I was trying to fix

1430
00:37:36.981 --> 00:37:37.760
something,

1431
00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:42.470
that would be like the perfect fight to fix because there's nobody else that's

1432
00:37:42.471 --> 00:37:43.550
interesting out there.

1433
00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:44.960
Now that Mayweather is in jail.

1434
00:37:44.961 --> 00:37:45.560
So who's,

1435
00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.840
who else is interesting for him to fight and if you were a mastermind,

1436
00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:49.600
if you,

1437
00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.830
if you want to put together a conspiracy,

1438
00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:52.730
I'm convinced.

1439
00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.010
Exactly it'll be brilliant.

1440
00:37:55.011 --> 00:37:57.920
Moneymaking move and you got to admire them really

1441
00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:00.850
<v 1>now everybody wants to watch packy I'll get his revenge.</v>

1442
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:01.833
Exactly.

1443
00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.210
I mean I think the NBA is the same way.

1444
00:38:04.211 --> 00:38:06.460
I think they have their guys that they want in the ring.

1445
00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.020
They finesse it.

1446
00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:08.940
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1447
00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:09.740
finesse.

1448
00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:12.150
And I also bet that pack yellows,

1449
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:15.810
I bet there's probably some verbiage in his contract that changes,

1450
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:16.291
you know,

1451
00:38:16.291 --> 00:38:19.980
how much money he gets based on whether or not he's a champion based on whether

1452
00:38:19.981 --> 00:38:20.970
or not he wins or loses.

1453
00:38:20.971 --> 00:38:21.151
I mean,

1454
00:38:21.151 --> 00:38:22.020
I would imagine,

1455
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:22.351
did you,

1456
00:38:22.351 --> 00:38:23.310
did you something?

1457
00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:24.443
Maybe not.

1458
00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:25.560
It may the eat me.

1459
00:38:25.561 --> 00:38:26.311
He such a draw.

1460
00:38:26.311 --> 00:38:27.630
Maybe that's nonsense.

1461
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.531
Why would they gamble?

1462
00:38:28.531 --> 00:38:29.160
Something like that.

1463
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.030
I think that I,

1464
00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.700
I like your theory that they would try and keep it interesting.

1465
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:34.950
I think that's exactly what I would do.

1466
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:36.250
I was a corrupt guy.

1467
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:37.480
<v 1>I'm not saying that they did that,</v>

1468
00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:37.901
but I'm saying,

1469
00:38:37.901 --> 00:38:38.111
look,

1470
00:38:38.111 --> 00:38:41.380
if I was like some dude in a Batman comic book that was manipulating,

1471
00:38:41.381 --> 00:38:44.260
I got this [inaudible] I don't,

1472
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.210
I don't think it's like that

1473
00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:45.471
<v 4>dude.</v>

1474
00:38:45.471 --> 00:38:46.340
It's a business.

1475
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:47.181
It's a business.

1476
00:38:47.181 --> 00:38:47.760
And you had,

1477
00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.460
you had a major asset,

1478
00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.380
just get taken off the table.

1479
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:53.270
What can we do to keep excitement?

1480
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:54.800
Keep it spicy going like that.

1481
00:38:54.801 --> 00:38:54.981
Yeah.

1482
00:38:54.981 --> 00:38:55.761
And I think like,

1483
00:38:55.761 --> 00:38:56.270
uh,

1484
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:57.290
did you hear today on,

1485
00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:57.511
uh,

1486
00:38:57.511 --> 00:38:58.341
on Jim Rome,

1487
00:38:58.341 --> 00:38:58.890
he asked,

1488
00:38:58.890 --> 00:38:59.190
uh,

1489
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.570
uh,

1490
00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:00.403
David Stern,

1491
00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:01.420
uh,

1492
00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:01.740
if,

1493
00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:02.210
if the,

1494
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:03.920
the NBA lottery was fixed,

1495
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:05.300
I know it doesn't mean shit to you.

1496
00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.580
What is the NBA lottery lottery is like,

1497
00:39:07.581 --> 00:39:08.960
basically in most sports,

1498
00:39:08.961 --> 00:39:10.370
if you had the worst record,

1499
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:11.600
um,

1500
00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:12.770
when the draft comes around,

1501
00:39:12.771 --> 00:39:16.010
all the new talent comes out of college or whatever you get first pick.

1502
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:19.220
So that way the worst teams can get better and it,

1503
00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:22.760
and it creates some sort of parity in theory,

1504
00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:23.511
keeps them,

1505
00:39:23.511 --> 00:39:24.320
you know,

1506
00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.153
um,

1507
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:26.031
but the NBA,

1508
00:39:26.031 --> 00:39:27.170
to make it more exciting,

1509
00:39:27.171 --> 00:39:28.130
they have a lottery.

1510
00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:28.810
So like the,

1511
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:31.310
the lower tan or whatever the fuck it is,

1512
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:32.470
they all get,

1513
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.930
uh,

1514
00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:33.111
the,

1515
00:39:33.111 --> 00:39:35.840
I'll get a shot at possibly being number one.

1516
00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:39.710
So then they put a bunch of ping pong balls into the thing and then they pull it

1517
00:39:39.711 --> 00:39:39.831
out.

1518
00:39:39.831 --> 00:39:41.810
Like I'd like the Massachusetts State fucking lottery.

1519
00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:42.350
Whoa.

1520
00:39:42.350 --> 00:39:42.921
And a,

1521
00:39:42.921 --> 00:39:44.360
they do that for whatever reason.

1522
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:46.760
Like in some people think that they do it.

1523
00:39:46.761 --> 00:39:47.600
So every like three,

1524
00:39:47.601 --> 00:39:48.081
four years,

1525
00:39:48.081 --> 00:39:51.770
when there's a serious guy coming out who's going to be like a Paki out level

1526
00:39:51.771 --> 00:39:53.420
guy but like up like a basketball player,

1527
00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:54.680
um,

1528
00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:58.970
as far as like a drawing power of a Pacquiao and they have a major market that's

1529
00:39:58.971 --> 00:39:59.804
hurting,

1530
00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.340
they manipulate it where like,

1531
00:40:01.341 --> 00:40:01.641
you know,

1532
00:40:01.641 --> 00:40:02.000
they're going to,

1533
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.140
like the first year they did it,

1534
00:40:03.141 --> 00:40:04.580
all of a sudden New York City,

1535
00:40:04.581 --> 00:40:06.160
which had the worst chance of winning it.

1536
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:06.741
They want it.

1537
00:40:06.741 --> 00:40:07.940
And then they got Patrick Ewing,

1538
00:40:07.941 --> 00:40:10.520
which was great for hoop like that.

1539
00:40:10.521 --> 00:40:12.140
That's something if they do manipulate that,

1540
00:40:12.141 --> 00:40:12.771
I'm just thinking,

1541
00:40:12.771 --> 00:40:12.921
you know,

1542
00:40:12.921 --> 00:40:14.090
that's just a good business plan,

1543
00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.231
you know?

1544
00:40:15.231 --> 00:40:15.751
But anyway,

1545
00:40:15.751 --> 00:40:17.420
so this Guy Jim Rome asked him,

1546
00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:19.760
he asked him if it was fixed,

1547
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:23.990
which is a fucking hilarious and insane question to ask the commissioner of

1548
00:40:23.991 --> 00:40:24.561
basketball.

1549
00:40:24.561 --> 00:40:25.210
Like he's going to be like,

1550
00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:25.451
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1551
00:40:25.451 --> 00:40:26.440
you know what it is.

1552
00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:27.890
But he asked it

1553
00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:28.480
<v 4>right?</v>

1554
00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:28.900
And,

1555
00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.520
and I guess Stern freaked out.

1556
00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:31.940
He's,

1557
00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:32.441
he said,

1558
00:40:32.441 --> 00:40:33.430
how could you even ask me that?

1559
00:40:33.431 --> 00:40:33.750
He said,

1560
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.941
Joe,

1561
00:40:33.941 --> 00:40:34.541
let me ask you this.

1562
00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:34.841
He goes,

1563
00:40:34.841 --> 00:40:36.250
when did you stop beating your wife?

1564
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:37.383
<v 1>Whoa.</v>

1565
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:39.420
<v 4>Takes that literal,</v>

1566
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:40.440
I guess that I know.

1567
00:40:40.441 --> 00:40:41.121
I never heard that,

1568
00:40:41.121 --> 00:40:41.301
that,

1569
00:40:41.301 --> 00:40:43.050
but I guess it's some old school,

1570
00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:44.663
um,

1571
00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.470
expression that they're there.

1572
00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:48.131
They're there.

1573
00:40:48.131 --> 00:40:50.890
What he's really doing is criticizing your question by saying what was,

1574
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:53.250
when did you stop beating your wife?

1575
00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:57.040
Is the insinuation is that you're already beating your wife even if you're

1576
00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:57.781
totally innocent.

1577
00:40:57.781 --> 00:40:59.460
So Jim Rome didn't beat his wife,

1578
00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:00.110
right?

1579
00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:00.460
He,

1580
00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:02.640
he threw it at him like that saying,

1581
00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.170
that's what you're doing to me right now.

1582
00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:05.291
<v 1>Wow.</v>

1583
00:41:05.291 --> 00:41:08.410
What kind of headed the fucking Stanley Kubrick symbolism is that,

1584
00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.140
I don't know.

1585
00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:09.973
And once again,

1586
00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:12.850
I have not heard the audio.

1587
00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:13.691
Oh,

1588
00:41:13.691 --> 00:41:18.520
Jesus cry was driving over on my radio on the am radio going under bridges.

1589
00:41:18.521 --> 00:41:19.271
And this is what I heard.

1590
00:41:19.271 --> 00:41:20.104
This is all what I heard.

1591
00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:22.060
I heard they found Sasquatch.

1592
00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:23.710
Now this is the thing about me though.

1593
00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.170
I admit that I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

1594
00:41:26.171 --> 00:41:29.650
It cuts down on so many angry emails and it also makes people feel good about

1595
00:41:29.651 --> 00:41:30.484
themselves.

1596
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:33.860
Most people think they're as full shit as I am,

1597
00:41:33.861 --> 00:41:34.070
but

1598
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:34.221
<v 4>they,</v>

1599
00:41:34.221 --> 00:41:36.200
but they never have that honest moment with themselves.

1600
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.361
Well,

1601
00:41:36.361 --> 00:41:37.550
you're full of shitness though.

1602
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:38.413
Creates art.

1603
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:39.530
Creates comedy,

1604
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:40.513
you know?

1605
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.941
Yeah.

1606
00:41:40.941 --> 00:41:42.020
By being the butt of the joke.

1607
00:41:42.021 --> 00:41:42.854
I know how it works.

1608
00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:43.521
I think.

1609
00:41:43.521 --> 00:41:44.354
I don't know how my,

1610
00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.530
how my bread's buttered.

1611
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:47.090
I got my voice down.

1612
00:41:47.091 --> 00:41:47.924
I'm a fucking idiot.

1613
00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:50.690
I make people feel smarter than they really are.

1614
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.460
I set the bar low,

1615
00:41:52.461 --> 00:41:53.294
Joe.

1616
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:54.800
It's not a bad move.

1617
00:41:54.801 --> 00:41:56.150
I really like how you're rocking it.

1618
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:57.703
Yeah.

1619
00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:58.550
I shouldn't be here.

1620
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.600
I should have,

1621
00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:04.600
I should have died of an appendicitis in 1980 but they had enough medicine to

1622
00:42:05.121 --> 00:42:05.954
keep me going.

1623
00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:06.300
Um,

1624
00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:07.011
I'm one of the week,

1625
00:42:07.011 --> 00:42:07.844
Joe.

1626
00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:08.660
I shouldn't be here.

1627
00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:09.160
Oh,

1628
00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:09.950
one of the week.

1629
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:10.760
Yeah.

1630
00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.710
I'm going to be how you feel be allowed.

1631
00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:13.521
Yeah.

1632
00:42:13.521 --> 00:42:18.521
I think that that's why like this sea of fucking morons that's out there,

1633
00:42:18.711 --> 00:42:19.401
that's what it is.

1634
00:42:19.401 --> 00:42:19.591
It's,

1635
00:42:19.591 --> 00:42:21.410
it's all the penicillin that's available.

1636
00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:22.371
If you just,

1637
00:42:22.371 --> 00:42:23.930
you just brought it back a little bit.

1638
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.333
You know,

1639
00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.520
I think we'd have a lot more shiny stars out there.

1640
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:30.560
You'd see people driving better if there was more disease.

1641
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:35.240
If he just let the weak die off and I know I'm not gonna make the cut.

1642
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:36.463
Well

1643
00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:39.920
I think there's only so much chicken.

1644
00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:41.960
There's only so much water out there.

1645
00:42:41.961 --> 00:42:43.760
We just weave out fucked all of it.

1646
00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:44.180
But that's it.

1647
00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.280
<v 0>Terrible decision because it's,</v>

1648
00:42:46.281 --> 00:42:47.140
it's often taught,

1649
00:42:47.141 --> 00:42:47.601
I mean there's,

1650
00:42:47.601 --> 00:42:49.880
there's a weird balance to the way life works.

1651
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:51.043
And uh,

1652
00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:52.350
when you say the week,

1653
00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:57.590
often it's those weak that are inventing fucking imax and those are the ones

1654
00:42:58.161 --> 00:42:59.960
that are figuring out how to make your internet faster.

1655
00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.220
Four g phones,

1656
00:43:01.221 --> 00:43:02.180
they would have come up with that.

1657
00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:03.483
I don't think

1658
00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.360
you could leave those fucking sword swinging and dudes,

1659
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:10.550
you could leave them alone for a million years.

1660
00:43:10.551 --> 00:43:11.001
Come back.

1661
00:43:11.001 --> 00:43:13.160
They'd still be hacking each other to death with swords.

1662
00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:14.453
<v 4>No,</v>

1663
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.330
I'm not painting with one color here.

1664
00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.870
I'm saying the best of the best of the Imax guys.

1665
00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:21.170
The best of the best of the,

1666
00:43:21.171 --> 00:43:21.341
the,

1667
00:43:21.341 --> 00:43:23.020
the guys who will beat you down.

1668
00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:24.640
I think that the Dream Team,

1669
00:43:24.641 --> 00:43:26.890
a few would be eggs is what I'm talking about.

1670
00:43:26.891 --> 00:43:27.320
He had

1671
00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:27.610
<v 0>what,</v>

1672
00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:31.140
what I'm saying is the physically weak often are the most

1673
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:33.680
<v 4>people when they fucking aliens show up.</v>

1674
00:43:33.681 --> 00:43:35.870
The guys who got actually an actual game plan,

1675
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:39.100
those are the guys who were going to figure out how not to get on that space

1676
00:43:39.101 --> 00:43:39.934
ship and get eaten.

1677
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.790
And isn't this obvious joke,

1678
00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:44.121
this is,

1679
00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:44.954
I'm done.

1680
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:47.210
If I was looking right down the street here,

1681
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.660
<v 0>I was living in another planet.</v>

1682
00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:49.830
I want a food source.

1683
00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:51.150
People would be a good one.

1684
00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:51.960
You know,

1685
00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.270
we're like fucking rats on a sinking ship where everywhere.

1686
00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.193
I know,

1687
00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:57.480
<v 4>and I would come here for we,</v>

1688
00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.650
we would be like a nice steak house with all the fat,

1689
00:43:59.651 --> 00:44:00.461
marble people.

1690
00:44:00.461 --> 00:44:01.294
We'd be the best.

1691
00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:06.360
Well fed grass instead of corn fed.

1692
00:44:06.361 --> 00:44:07.930
It'd be like this one's from Texas.

1693
00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:11.880
Some Houston would be like the Colby beef people would at beach.

1694
00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:14.020
<v 0>This is 100% Vegan Diet.</v>

1695
00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:16.810
Got The guy ate nothing but plants.

1696
00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:18.081
<v 4>Nothing but plants.</v>

1697
00:44:18.081 --> 00:44:18.471
That would be,

1698
00:44:18.471 --> 00:44:18.561
yeah,

1699
00:44:18.561 --> 00:44:19.700
that would be like the uh,

1700
00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:23.090
at a mommy of human beings if you ate one of those guys.

1701
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:23.961
Cannibalism.

1702
00:44:23.961 --> 00:44:25.670
Everybody on the Joe Rogan experience.

1703
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:25.911
Well,

1704
00:44:25.911 --> 00:44:27.590
we know the chimps eat monkeys.

1705
00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.560
Chimps eat fucking assholes about it.

1706
00:44:30.561 --> 00:44:31.394
I hate chimps.

1707
00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.210
<v 1>Can't stand a man.</v>

1708
00:44:33.211 --> 00:44:35.670
I watched his fucking to champion this chip.

1709
00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:37.080
Rip This fucking,

1710
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:39.080
they had this dad,

1711
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:39.960
this whole thing.

1712
00:44:39.961 --> 00:44:40.741
I know you've seen this.

1713
00:44:40.741 --> 00:44:41.910
You watch all of this shit.

1714
00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.020
They will basically,

1715
00:44:43.021 --> 00:44:43.800
I don't know what they did.

1716
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:44.850
They sort of trap.

1717
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:45.391
Yeah,

1718
00:44:45.391 --> 00:44:46.224
they steer that one.

1719
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.711
And they had,

1720
00:44:46.711 --> 00:44:49.470
they had the infrared thing where that you could see where the chips were going

1721
00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:51.480
and they had really scary.

1722
00:44:51.481 --> 00:44:51.691
Yeah.

1723
00:44:51.691 --> 00:44:55.140
It's like they chased them down the street except it was in trees and they had

1724
00:44:55.141 --> 00:44:58.470
to have their Tufts hang in there and they basically drove this monkey bait

1725
00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:02.460
right into the trap and this fucking chimp grabs him.

1726
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:05.880
He's standing on his back and rather than just twisted his head and in his

1727
00:45:05.881 --> 00:45:06.271
misery,

1728
00:45:06.271 --> 00:45:08.160
he just starts digging into his back,

1729
00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:09.840
pulling pieces out of them.

1730
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:11.130
And this fucking monkeys,

1731
00:45:11.131 --> 00:45:11.550
it's gone.

1732
00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:12.383
I

1733
00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:17.610
just freaking out and this fucking thing is just sitting there like biting on

1734
00:45:17.611 --> 00:45:18.180
its hips.

1735
00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:18.751
I remember that.

1736
00:45:18.751 --> 00:45:21.480
He's like biting on his hip to the monkey screaming it.

1737
00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.090
It's a little eyes are like bugging out of his head.

1738
00:45:24.091 --> 00:45:25.780
It's dark and that's it.

1739
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:28.530
Fucking says relatives and just like us,

1740
00:45:28.531 --> 00:45:29.610
they're fucking evil,

1741
00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:30.630
man.

1742
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:31.650
I'd shoot a chimp dude.

1743
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:35.070
I ain't know if you saw in the wild.

1744
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.680
No,

1745
00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:35.840
no,

1746
00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:36.120
no,

1747
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:36.301
no.

1748
00:45:36.301 --> 00:45:37.860
If he's right up to him,

1749
00:45:37.861 --> 00:45:38.694
fuck you.

1750
00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:40.053
Yeah.

1751
00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.490
This is for the monkey.

1752
00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:44.310
Not on this certain animals.

1753
00:45:44.311 --> 00:45:45.144
I could kill.

1754
00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.480
I would be after one set person got their face ripped off by a chimp.

1755
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:48.930
Oh,

1756
00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:51.300
I would be like a trigger.

1757
00:45:51.301 --> 00:45:52.134
Happy Cop.

1758
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:52.441
Well,

1759
00:45:52.441 --> 00:45:52.981
that lady,

1760
00:45:52.981 --> 00:45:55.560
she was given that chimpanzees Xanax.

1761
00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:56.760
That's crazy.

1762
00:45:56.761 --> 00:45:58.650
She was given Xanax and wine.

1763
00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:01.800
I used to get my cat Flonase because it's Persian and always had breathing

1764
00:46:01.801 --> 00:46:03.330
problems and I was really stoned.

1765
00:46:03.331 --> 00:46:03.730
I'm like,

1766
00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:05.820
I'll just put a little drop on the tip of her nose and I'm like,

1767
00:46:05.821 --> 00:46:06.690
that's probably the dumbest thing.

1768
00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:08.120
You could probably do it once.

1769
00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:08.911
It's explained to me.

1770
00:46:08.911 --> 00:46:09.970
I've never tried Zeiss.

1771
00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:14.640
Soon it's the fuck is this stuff's bad for human son even called now I don't.

1772
00:46:14.641 --> 00:46:16.020
You still have one like that.

1773
00:46:16.021 --> 00:46:17.910
Five hour energies and liquid coke.

1774
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:19.200
I need a nap now.

1775
00:46:19.201 --> 00:46:20.370
I want to work all night.

1776
00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:22.200
You know what that is mostly,

1777
00:46:22.201 --> 00:46:26.340
it's a lot of vitamin B 12 so having that much caffeine though,

1778
00:46:26.341 --> 00:46:27.174
those five hour,

1779
00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.310
our energies are actually healthier,

1780
00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:32.930
like on a chemical profile level than it is to dry.

1781
00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.170
I read that day Starbucks,

1782
00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.260
they are insane levels of everything that's good for you,

1783
00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.340
which is never good.

1784
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:39.031
Well,

1785
00:46:39.031 --> 00:46:41.280
it's a little bit at one glass of alcohol is good for you.

1786
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:42.390
You're not 12 chunks.

1787
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.270
You pissed that out.

1788
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:46.321
None of those.

1789
00:46:46.321 --> 00:46:47.160
You have to worry about it.

1790
00:46:47.161 --> 00:46:49.710
It's not like you're drinking them all day every day and you're going to develop

1791
00:46:49.711 --> 00:46:51.090
toxic amounts of vitamins.

1792
00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:51.691
Once again,

1793
00:46:51.691 --> 00:46:51.990
Joe,

1794
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:54.510
I haven't read a book that I've already made up my mind.

1795
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:55.381
It's liquid.

1796
00:46:55.381 --> 00:46:57.330
Coq fucking stuff will kill you.

1797
00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:58.560
You know?

1798
00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.020
Do you remember that there was some shit called red line.

1799
00:47:01.021 --> 00:47:02.340
Did you ever try red line?

1800
00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:03.481
It's one of those things.

1801
00:47:03.481 --> 00:47:06.660
Any of that shit it say like three servings or something.

1802
00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:07.080
I Dunno,

1803
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:07.980
this I'm making up.

1804
00:47:07.981 --> 00:47:09.320
I don't know if it said three servers.

1805
00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.670
Your car underneath a bridge.

1806
00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:15.150
You're in my arena arena because I don't want to get sued.

1807
00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:15.401
I don't know.

1808
00:47:15.401 --> 00:47:15.751
It read,

1809
00:47:15.751 --> 00:47:16.740
lot of people pissed at me,

1810
00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:20.820
but it was the strongest fucking caffeinated beverage I've ever had in my life.

1811
00:47:20.821 --> 00:47:22.110
Like I remember drinking one,

1812
00:47:22.111 --> 00:47:25.290
I was tired and I was driving back from some gig and I got one at like one of

1813
00:47:25.291 --> 00:47:29.170
those 24 marks at a gas station and I sounded fucking drink.

1814
00:47:29.171 --> 00:47:30.070
That's the wheel and I'm on my

1815
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:30.821
<v 4>way home and I'm like,</v>

1816
00:47:30.821 --> 00:47:32.560
Holy Shit.

1817
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.360
I am wide awake.

1818
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:36.610
I'm thinking all this shit I'm going to do back when I get home.

1819
00:47:36.611 --> 00:47:38.230
I gotta clean my fucking office.

1820
00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:39.130
Jesus Christ.

1821
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:42.580
I could still get a workout in if I put an hour and a half cleaning and then I

1822
00:47:42.581 --> 00:47:43.840
do an hour of kettle bells.

1823
00:47:43.841 --> 00:47:44.471
I'm thinking all this shit.

1824
00:47:44.471 --> 00:47:44.950
I'm like,

1825
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:45.281
Oh,

1826
00:47:45.281 --> 00:47:45.591
I'm,

1827
00:47:45.591 --> 00:47:46.900
I'm Mike on Crank right now.

1828
00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:48.003
Essentially on some,

1829
00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:49.420
some liquid amphetamine,

1830
00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:50.890
any of those sports drinks,

1831
00:47:50.891 --> 00:47:51.551
energy drinks,

1832
00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:51.821
anything.

1833
00:47:51.821 --> 00:47:52.654
It's fizzy.

1834
00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.040
I don't fuck with the cloth.

1835
00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:54.521
Let less,

1836
00:47:54.521 --> 00:47:56.710
it's like a root beer or a coke or something like that.

1837
00:47:56.711 --> 00:47:57.544
I'll do that shit.

1838
00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:58.393
Okay.

1839
00:47:58.590 --> 00:47:58.740
Oh,

1840
00:47:58.740 --> 00:47:59.351
speaking of that,

1841
00:47:59.351 --> 00:47:59.591
can I,

1842
00:47:59.591 --> 00:48:00.590
can I plug something?

1843
00:48:00.591 --> 00:48:01.600
I tell them going,

1844
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:04.210
doing something for the Oakland A's.

1845
00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:07.240
They got root beer float Dale Day,

1846
00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:08.140
I swear to God.

1847
00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:11.650
And it's to raise awareness for childhood diabetes.

1848
00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:12.723
Swear to God,

1849
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:15.190
I guess a long time ago,

1850
00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:16.840
uh,

1851
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:18.130
the root beer company,

1852
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:18.370
they,

1853
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:21.940
this was their cause and they were into it and I guess there was no irony back

1854
00:48:21.941 --> 00:48:22.360
in the day.

1855
00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.980
So they are the ones,

1856
00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:25.241
they are the ones.

1857
00:48:25.241 --> 00:48:26.680
So I already know,

1858
00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:27.131
I already know.

1859
00:48:27.131 --> 00:48:27.431
I already,

1860
00:48:27.431 --> 00:48:30.190
everybody in my Twitter thought that they were the most clever person ever.

1861
00:48:30.191 --> 00:48:34.180
Like I didn't notice how ridiculous it is to how funny it is.

1862
00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:35.290
I think it's kind of funny.

1863
00:48:35.291 --> 00:48:35.950
I think it's awesome.

1864
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:36.290
Stop.

1865
00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:36.881
Galpo you know,

1866
00:48:36.881 --> 00:48:37.451
come on down.

1867
00:48:37.451 --> 00:48:38.284
Open Bar let's,

1868
00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:39.310
and alcoholism,

1869
00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:40.020
you know,

1870
00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:40.853
it's just something,

1871
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:41.831
there's something,

1872
00:48:41.831 --> 00:48:42.611
what I like about it,

1873
00:48:42.611 --> 00:48:44.860
there's something almost like anchorman,

1874
00:48:44.861 --> 00:48:46.780
like old school about it that I love it.

1875
00:48:46.781 --> 00:48:47.171
So,

1876
00:48:47.171 --> 00:48:47.471
uh,

1877
00:48:47.471 --> 00:48:48.940
I'm going to go up there and plus,

1878
00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:50.080
you know,

1879
00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:52.060
being a baseball fan of the way it used to be,

1880
00:48:52.061 --> 00:48:54.820
where teams like the pirates in the A's were good before all this,

1881
00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:55.360
you know,

1882
00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.590
the money markets one,

1883
00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:57.641
the money markets,

1884
00:48:57.641 --> 00:48:59.050
one big business,

1885
00:48:59.051 --> 00:48:59.861
including the red sox.

1886
00:48:59.861 --> 00:49:00.000
Like,

1887
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:00.400
I mean,

1888
00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.220
Roger Clemens,

1889
00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:02.920
they said that he's there.

1890
00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.360
He's still getting tried.

1891
00:49:04.361 --> 00:49:05.890
He's going to try it again for something now.

1892
00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:06.040
Yeah.

1893
00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.900
But then none of that shit's about steroids.

1894
00:49:07.901 --> 00:49:11.320
It's about a perjury perjuring yourself and has about steroids,

1895
00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:12.161
steroids.

1896
00:49:12.161 --> 00:49:12.731
But it's really,

1897
00:49:12.731 --> 00:49:13.630
you lied under oath.

1898
00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:14.080
It's,

1899
00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.960
it's a sense the Clinton thing where it wasn't the blow job.

1900
00:49:16.961 --> 00:49:19.390
It's that you said you didn't get one under oath.

1901
00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:21.400
He swore that you would tell the truth.

1902
00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:21.851
Wow.

1903
00:49:21.851 --> 00:49:22.720
That's crazy.

1904
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:23.733
Yeah.

1905
00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.593
Um,

1906
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:26.260
they're going after the dude for,

1907
00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.330
for doing steroids in baseball.

1908
00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:29.031
Leave the bankers.

1909
00:49:29.031 --> 00:49:29.560
That is fine.

1910
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.393
Leave those guys alone.

1911
00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:30.881
That's okay.

1912
00:49:30.881 --> 00:49:33.940
But this mother fucker trying to claim he's got 300 victories.

1913
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.750
That's amazing.

1914
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:35.680
We got to stop this.

1915
00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:36.910
How strange is that?

1916
00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:38.223
It isn't,

1917
00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:39.430
it doesn't hurt worse.

1918
00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:41.140
But I mean in 2012,

1919
00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:42.670
they would waste any time on that.

1920
00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:45.670
The fact that it got congress,

1921
00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.440
Congress,

1922
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:49.270
they had congressional hearings.

1923
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:51.480
I don't send them a base.

1924
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:53.110
Everybody gives a fuck about baseball.

1925
00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:54.490
You got a mobbed up ref.

1926
00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:57.790
The fucking NBA is able able to handle that in house.

1927
00:49:58.120 --> 00:49:59.320
And it was just tearing my rights,

1928
00:49:59.321 --> 00:50:00.490
see lane and go fuck yourself.

1929
00:50:00.491 --> 00:50:00.911
Let's go.

1930
00:50:00.911 --> 00:50:01.900
A game's at seven.

1931
00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.100
And this stuff here,

1932
00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:03.471
like they,

1933
00:50:03.471 --> 00:50:04.240
they uh,

1934
00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.040
for some reason they had to get involved.

1935
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:07.510
I don't know why.

1936
00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.650
I don't fucking read.

1937
00:50:08.651 --> 00:50:09.484
I don't know what's going on.

1938
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:10.811
I really don't.

1939
00:50:10.811 --> 00:50:11.571
I have no idea.

1940
00:50:11.571 --> 00:50:12.280
It's so,

1941
00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:17.260
I never noticed like how truly uninformed I am until I get behind a microphone,

1942
00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:19.240
because I always just hear the audience going like,

1943
00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:19.771
dude,

1944
00:50:19.771 --> 00:50:20.830
that isn't how it is.

1945
00:50:20.831 --> 00:50:24.280
And it's just fucking ridiculous fucking dude.

1946
00:50:24.281 --> 00:50:26.700
It is so fucking ridiculous that I've been able to,

1947
00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:28.040
to earn a living and be able

1948
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:32.930
<v 1>to eat three times a day with just the unbelievable lack of fucking information</v>

1949
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:36.440
that I have that you just act like an idiot and strip malls around the country.

1950
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:36.771
Yeah.

1951
00:50:36.771 --> 00:50:38.060
But there's a beauty in that.

1952
00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.150
There's a beauty in that lack of information.

1953
00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:42.230
That's the weed talking.

1954
00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:43.130
No,

1955
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:44.330
there's a beautiful comedy.

1956
00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:45.403
It's a beauty in it.

1957
00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:46.731
That's a,

1958
00:50:46.731 --> 00:50:47.391
that's your,

1959
00:50:47.391 --> 00:50:49.550
that's your thing that's driving me nuts the whole time.

1960
00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:50.871
Oh,

1961
00:50:50.871 --> 00:50:51.500
I see.

1962
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:55.430
I thought this was added prosthetics to this fucking cat's head for cats had

1963
00:50:55.431 --> 00:50:56.680
broke when it moved in here.

1964
00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:58.940
That was the first thing that broke with my favorite.

1965
00:50:59.060 --> 00:50:59.893
Okay.

1966
00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:01.310
Are you a cat person?

1967
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:03.470
I used to be until recently.

1968
00:51:03.471 --> 00:51:04.340
Now I can't,

1969
00:51:04.341 --> 00:51:04.431
I,

1970
00:51:04.431 --> 00:51:05.930
I'm done with all animals.

1971
00:51:05.931 --> 00:51:07.320
I think this,

1972
00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:07.940
they're,

1973
00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.020
they're just there.

1974
00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:11.020
You have to give them too much attention and I,

1975
00:51:11.021 --> 00:51:12.080
I don't have that.

1976
00:51:12.081 --> 00:51:13.310
Time would be good.

1977
00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:14.680
He gets it like,

1978
00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:15.290
you know,

1979
00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:16.670
we asked like the loners man,

1980
00:51:16.671 --> 00:51:17.500
go fuck yourself.

1981
00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:18.920
Oh you have company when I need you.

1982
00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:19.221
Yeah.

1983
00:51:19.221 --> 00:51:19.761
You think that,

1984
00:51:19.761 --> 00:51:20.291
but you know,

1985
00:51:20.291 --> 00:51:21.124
if it's,

1986
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:22.210
that's a needy basically.

1987
00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:22.491
Yeah.

1988
00:51:22.491 --> 00:51:24.350
My cats are getting the older they get.

1989
00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:25.101
Yeah.

1990
00:51:25.101 --> 00:51:28.760
My cat is super neat when I'm trying to write now ma'am now tries to get in my

1991
00:51:28.761 --> 00:51:32.030
lap all the time and I'll give her like a little bit and try to send her on her

1992
00:51:32.031 --> 00:51:32.600
way.

1993
00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:33.530
But after a while I'm like,

1994
00:51:33.531 --> 00:51:33.891
come on,

1995
00:51:33.891 --> 00:51:34.610
I got to right.

1996
00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:35.390
Leave me alone.

1997
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.870
Stop.

1998
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:36.080
Yeah,

1999
00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:38.330
not well cat's out of the room.

2000
00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:39.920
You have to take her out of the room and shut the door.

2001
00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:40.490
Got scabs.

2002
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:41.600
That Voodoo vibe.

2003
00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:42.140
Yeah.

2004
00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:44.180
Like well they know the date you're going to die.

2005
00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.170
They have like look in there.

2006
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:47.090
They're definitely different.

2007
00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:48.530
I would not,

2008
00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:52.250
I would not be surprised if cats couldn't see some shit that we can't see.

2009
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:53.930
Know some shit that we can't know.

2010
00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.930
They say that animals are the ones that know when earthquakes are coming,

2011
00:51:56.970 --> 00:51:59.810
they start fucking freaking out and they run up hill.

2012
00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:01.070
Like when the tsunami came,

2013
00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.410
no animals died in that shit or not.

2014
00:52:03.411 --> 00:52:04.220
No animal style.

2015
00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:07.340
Very few animals died like regular animals like deers and shit.

2016
00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:09.110
Cause they all ran away.

2017
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:10.610
They all knew it was coming.

2018
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:11.180
They,

2019
00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:12.410
they feel like they have,

2020
00:52:12.411 --> 00:52:14.900
they have senses that we don't need.

2021
00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:15.440
We've,

2022
00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.290
we've vice gifts because there aren't that.

2023
00:52:17.291 --> 00:52:17.960
They're barefoot.

2024
00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.120
Get on their horse thinking it.

2025
00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:20.180
They can feel the rumbling.

2026
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.040
You sitting there and your flip flops,

2027
00:52:22.041 --> 00:52:22.874
that rubber,

2028
00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:23.751
that's all you need.

2029
00:52:23.751 --> 00:52:24.920
That little half inch or rubber.

2030
00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:25.340
Yeah.

2031
00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:26.570
And you're not going to fill a Sufi,

2032
00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:27.230
nope.

2033
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:28.400
No barefoot guy died.

2034
00:52:28.401 --> 00:52:29.234
Not Tsunami though.

2035
00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:30.733
That's true.

2036
00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:35.650
Lasting people heard before that wave crash was the slap of humans

2037
00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.053
running by them.

2038
00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.633
It's true.

2039
00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:40.820
Remember that kind of your central,

2040
00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:41.961
that dog bait,

2041
00:52:41.961 --> 00:52:44.390
this video when that dog heard the earthquake?

2042
00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:46.010
No,

2043
00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:47.090
I don't think I know this.

2044
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:49.041
There's no sound to this.

2045
00:52:49.041 --> 00:52:49.874
I don't believe.

2046
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:52.180
How the fuck can we prove it by watching?

2047
00:52:52.181 --> 00:52:53.440
Could hear the door for example.

2048
00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.080
Uh,

2049
00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:54.380
I don't,

2050
00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:55.790
it's in 2010.

2051
00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:56.480
Uh,

2052
00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.620
we can find out in a sec,

2053
00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:59.090
but is this Japan?

2054
00:52:59.280 --> 00:52:59.690
Uh,

2055
00:52:59.690 --> 00:52:59.910
no,

2056
00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:01.160
but see the dog runs

2057
00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:02.330
<v 7>okay.</v>

2058
00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:03.110
<v 1>And then watch.</v>

2059
00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:03.943
Yeah.

2060
00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:05.813
<v 7>Okay.</v>

2061
00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:06.663
<v 1>Oh Shit.</v>

2062
00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:09.530
Oh Shit.

2063
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:11.703
Whoa.

2064
00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:13.260
This is scary as fuck.

2065
00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:15.450
Here's another view of the dog just running.

2066
00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:17.383
<v 7>Huh?</v>

2067
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:20.090
<v 1>Dogs just like go fuck yourself.</v>

2068
00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.740
Go look at all those cars.

2069
00:53:21.741 --> 00:53:22.760
Move outside.

2070
00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:24.490
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

2071
00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:26.280
<v 2>This is such dumb place to live.</v>

2072
00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:30.510
We live with the dumbest place ever.

2073
00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:33.830
We're just rolling the dice and hoping that the,

2074
00:53:33.831 --> 00:53:36.900
the ground does it open up and swallow the city while we're here.

2075
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:37.561
Yeah,

2076
00:53:37.561 --> 00:53:38.700
but it's all every place.

2077
00:53:38.701 --> 00:53:39.480
It's dumb.

2078
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:40.110
Yeah,

2079
00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:40.943
it's true.

2080
00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:41.390
Yeah.

2081
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:43.590
This is going to be so you live out in the middle of nowhere.

2082
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.140
Then some grizzly bear can come and eat your face.

2083
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.550
Have you been watching mountain men?

2084
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:49.621
<v 4>But I,</v>

2085
00:53:49.621 --> 00:53:50.070
I,

2086
00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:51.750
I have the [inaudible] out your window.

2087
00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:54.363
Cello.

2088
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:56.190
I have the utmost respect

2089
00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.740
<v 2>for fucking rednecks in,</v>

2090
00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:02.710
in mountain men and people who could just live off the land.

2091
00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:06.550
Green Berets just fucking drop them in the middle of nowhere and they can just

2092
00:54:06.551 --> 00:54:09.910
get a fire going and just live out there and like the egg,

2093
00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:11.410
you should know how to do that.

2094
00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:15.070
There's a mountain man show up is a fascinating show.

2095
00:54:15.071 --> 00:54:16.000
It's a bunch of guys.

2096
00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:17.560
They live in different parts of the country,

2097
00:54:17.561 --> 00:54:18.460
all of them in the mountains.

2098
00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:21.210
One guy runs his whole farm and he uh,

2099
00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:24.160
puts on classes and teaches people how to survive,

2100
00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:27.820
trains people how to survive in the wilderness so that you could live off the

2101
00:54:27.821 --> 00:54:28.151
land,

2102
00:54:28.151 --> 00:54:29.500
shows you how to plant Kale,

2103
00:54:29.501 --> 00:54:30.670
shows you how to hunt deer.

2104
00:54:30.671 --> 00:54:34.450
So she had to make like homemade deer stands and he's doing all this shit.

2105
00:54:34.451 --> 00:54:38.920
And another guy is living up in Montana and this mother fucker has a gigantic

2106
00:54:38.921 --> 00:54:42.400
grizzly bear that's stalking his house and they see this thing,

2107
00:54:42.401 --> 00:54:43.820
they got this thing on film and they're,

2108
00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:45.130
they're shining a light on,

2109
00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:49.280
it's fucking enormous and it's just wandering around his yard that the

2110
00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:53.380
footprints this thing the next day and their shoot meets a fucking giant bear

2111
00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:57.010
and it's hungry cause it's starting to get snowy and he wants to hibernate but

2112
00:54:57.011 --> 00:54:58.360
it doesn't have any food in his stomach.

2113
00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:00.500
<v 4>So go get him some fucking sandwiches,</v>

2114
00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:03.920
have a big bag of raw meat out there.

2115
00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:06.710
Let them get the itis and you want to let know the heel,

2116
00:55:06.711 --> 00:55:07.700
chow that down,

2117
00:55:07.701 --> 00:55:08.660
we'll get sleepy.

2118
00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:10.470
<v 2>You can never do that if you feed a bear.</v>

2119
00:55:10.471 --> 00:55:12.960
They always remember where they got it from when they come back for more.

2120
00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:13.371
<v 4>Nah,</v>

2121
00:55:13.371 --> 00:55:14.330
that's an urban myth.

2122
00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.000
I started by those park rangers.

2123
00:55:17.001 --> 00:55:18.350
Just trying to get some press.

2124
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.230
You know what I wanted to watch.

2125
00:55:24.231 --> 00:55:25.280
Tweets are coming in now.

2126
00:55:25.281 --> 00:55:26.240
Fuck you bill burr.

2127
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:28.290
You don't even respect animals.

2128
00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:30.150
Unfollow.

2129
00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:31.521
I love that.

2130
00:55:31.521 --> 00:55:33.290
Like I give a shit that's my favorite.

2131
00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:34.670
Oh the fuck out of me.

2132
00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:37.490
I like the threat that I'm going to unfollow you dude.

2133
00:55:37.491 --> 00:55:39.380
As you have one more sports text,

2134
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:40.670
I'm going to unfollow you.

2135
00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:41.281
Really Fall,

2136
00:55:41.281 --> 00:55:41.720
follow.

2137
00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:42.980
Go ahead and follow through with it.

2138
00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:45.141
I want to see that,

2139
00:55:45.141 --> 00:55:46.600
that show where the uh,

2140
00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:46.881
the,

2141
00:55:46.881 --> 00:55:47.714
the uh,

2142
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:49.940
the people who are preparing for the apocalypse.

2143
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.450
Yeah.

2144
00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:51.200
What is that?

2145
00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:53.210
I wanted to watch that because I think that show was,

2146
00:55:53.211 --> 00:55:54.044
that's another,

2147
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:55.460
that's another thing that you're,

2148
00:55:55.461 --> 00:55:57.800
you're an idiot until it goes down.

2149
00:55:58.040 --> 00:55:58.790
You know what I mean?

2150
00:55:58.790 --> 00:55:59.031
Yeah.

2151
00:55:59.031 --> 00:56:01.070
You look like a nut until the guy was sticks.

2152
00:56:01.071 --> 00:56:03.080
The money in the mattress is a fucking idiot.

2153
00:56:03.081 --> 00:56:05.930
Because what if someone breaks into the house and then the banking system

2154
00:56:05.931 --> 00:56:06.500
collapses,

2155
00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:06.810
right.

2156
00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:07.491
No problem.

2157
00:56:07.491 --> 00:56:07.620
Album

2158
00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:12.300
<v 2>is not going to be storing food and and containing water cause you could do</v>

2159
00:56:12.301 --> 00:56:12.571
that.

2160
00:56:12.571 --> 00:56:15.930
You could store food and water and likely you could ride it out for like a

2161
00:56:15.931 --> 00:56:16.741
couple of months or so.

2162
00:56:16.741 --> 00:56:19.380
The real problem is going to be your neighbor probably didn't do that.

2163
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:20.940
That's going to be the real problem.

2164
00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:24.790
The other people that are you clothes that were poor that will live in day to

2165
00:56:24.791 --> 00:56:27.700
day and check to check what the fuck are they going to do when the food stops

2166
00:56:27.701 --> 00:56:28.180
coming in,

2167
00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:30.280
that's when the real problem kicks in.

2168
00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:32.620
So it might not help that you have a lot of water.

2169
00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:32.841
<v 4>No.</v>

2170
00:56:32.841 --> 00:56:35.060
That's why your plant your food in the backyard,

2171
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:37.180
you don't advertise it by being in the front.

2172
00:56:37.181 --> 00:56:37.500
Yes.

2173
00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:38.333
Everyone's going to see

2174
00:56:40.770 --> 00:56:43.840
yard in the middle of the night and stealing out of vegetables is,

2175
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:46.640
is link up with your other paranoid neighbors.

2176
00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:49.310
This is like a great beginning to a fucking movie,

2177
00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:50.030
right?

2178
00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:50.661
You fucking,

2179
00:56:50.661 --> 00:56:51.170
they link.

2180
00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:55.340
You got like three of four paranoid families on one block and when the shit goes

2181
00:56:55.341 --> 00:56:55.671
down,

2182
00:56:55.671 --> 00:56:57.620
my house is the rally point and we,

2183
00:56:57.830 --> 00:57:01.370
we fight off all these other suckers and meanwhile we're bringing a Bundt cakes

2184
00:57:01.371 --> 00:57:02.690
and everything's fucking cool.

2185
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:03.763
Right?

2186
00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:05.210
I only got the first 10 pages.

2187
00:57:05.211 --> 00:57:08.070
Don't look at me like this is going to go all the way through the [inaudible]

2188
00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.273
script.

2189
00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:10.280
Who shaves name?

2190
00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:10.431
Who?

2191
00:57:10.431 --> 00:57:11.170
Shane black.

2192
00:57:11.170 --> 00:57:11.540
Shane.

2193
00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:12.020
I don't know.

2194
00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:12.201
Yeah.

2195
00:57:12.201 --> 00:57:12.561
So then,

2196
00:57:12.561 --> 00:57:15.010
and then a famous a screenplay car.

2197
00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:16.790
It's like Red Dawn.

2198
00:57:16.791 --> 00:57:18.980
We got to kill your classmate except it's your a,

2199
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.600
your fucking your neighbor.

2200
00:57:20.601 --> 00:57:22.160
Somebody pees and it will radiate or I don't know.

2201
00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:22.760
Oh,

2202
00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:23.593
flushing

2203
00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:27.920
<v 2>involved in Syria and they're selling Syria these giant attack planes.</v>

2204
00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:28.730
That's awesome.

2205
00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:31.220
They were talking about this and the news that uh,

2206
00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:34.550
now serious going to have these crazy Russian attack.

2207
00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:34.830
Calyx

2208
00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:35.990
<v 4>copters can be honest.</v>

2209
00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:37.380
None of that scares me anymore.

2210
00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:37.950
Really.

2211
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:40.680
I have given into the fact that this is our destiny.

2212
00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:44.550
Our destiny is that we are going to fuck ourselves over.

2213
00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:45.601
And uh,

2214
00:57:45.601 --> 00:57:45.871
you know,

2215
00:57:45.871 --> 00:57:46.860
you can only die once.

2216
00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.060
You just hope you're not.

2217
00:57:48.061 --> 00:57:52.350
You don't have a chip on your back and your hip like that's not going to go out

2218
00:57:52.351 --> 00:57:53.184
that way.

2219
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.491
But yeah,

2220
00:57:53.491 --> 00:57:55.440
you want to shoot some shit at me and fucking,

2221
00:57:55.441 --> 00:57:55.771
you know,

2222
00:57:55.771 --> 00:57:56.970
blow me to smithereens.

2223
00:57:57.210 --> 00:57:58.800
How long am I going to give a fuck for?

2224
00:57:58.801 --> 00:58:00.810
I'm just going to be like for like half a second.

2225
00:58:00.811 --> 00:58:01.470
It's over.

2226
00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:02.101
Hopefully.

2227
00:58:02.101 --> 00:58:05.070
What if you get your legs blown off and then you have to live as a prisoner of

2228
00:58:05.071 --> 00:58:05.660
war?

2229
00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:06.480
I bleed out.

2230
00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.130
How do you know he'd be able to bleed out?

2231
00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:11.520
What am I going to push my legs up against the frying managed and try to

2232
00:58:11.521 --> 00:58:12.360
cauterize the,

2233
00:58:12.361 --> 00:58:12.990
is that the right word?

2234
00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:15.060
But sometimes they get fused from the blast.

2235
00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:17.161
I have.

2236
00:58:17.161 --> 00:58:17.461
No,

2237
00:58:17.461 --> 00:58:17.911
there's no way.

2238
00:58:17.911 --> 00:58:19.860
I talked about this on my podcast like I,

2239
00:58:19.861 --> 00:58:22.380
if I was ever faced with like that challenge,

2240
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:24.930
I don't know I could do that,

2241
00:58:24.931 --> 00:58:26.220
but if I was neck down,

2242
00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:27.083
there's no way.

2243
00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:27.721
There's no way.

2244
00:58:27.721 --> 00:58:30.060
I would just sit there and I would be gone along with everybody.

2245
00:58:30.061 --> 00:58:30.350
He baked.

2246
00:58:30.350 --> 00:58:30.511
Wow.

2247
00:58:30.511 --> 00:58:31.380
He's so positive.

2248
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:35.310
I learned how to steer my own wheelchair with my tongue and the first chance

2249
00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:37.230
daylight I got at a staircase,

2250
00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:39.060
I just fucking steer it right over.

2251
00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:40.830
I set myself write down,

2252
00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:41.723
there's no way.

2253
00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:43.030
There's no fucking way I could.

2254
00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:46.950
I couldn't like people who do that and they get naked writer write a book or the

2255
00:58:46.951 --> 00:58:51.060
most amazing human beings in the planet because there's no way I could,

2256
00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:52.140
I would pass that test.

2257
00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:54.130
<v 2>Hawkings has the craziest situation.</v>

2258
00:58:54.131 --> 00:58:54.940
Huh?

2259
00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:56.140
Guy in a wheelchair,

2260
00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:57.550
can't even talk,

2261
00:58:57.620 --> 00:58:58.150
can't,

2262
00:58:58.150 --> 00:59:01.860
can barely move his hand to communicate and he scrolls through words.

2263
00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:03.820
He has some method of,

2264
00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:07.930
of doing that and then this thing reads what he says.

2265
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:09.710
<v 4>That's it says it out loud.</v>

2266
00:59:09.711 --> 00:59:10.544
Being believable.

2267
00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:11.811
Yeah.

2268
00:59:11.811 --> 00:59:12.644
And he's like,

2269
00:59:12.690 --> 00:59:16.180
I got top scientists should have died after the appendicitis.

2270
00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:17.253
I'm one of the week.

2271
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.810
I just did.

2272
00:59:17.810 --> 00:59:18.621
It's just no way.

2273
00:59:18.621 --> 00:59:21.170
He's like one of the rare guys that took three Jiu Jitsu.

2274
00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:22.850
I tapped out for good.

2275
00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:24.800
I'm out.

2276
00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.400
I'm out.

2277
00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:26.233
You should come.

2278
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:26.961
Come,

2279
00:59:26.961 --> 00:59:27.890
come with me tonight man.

2280
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:28.160
Look,

2281
00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:29.770
I know I'm not a man would love it.

2282
00:59:29.771 --> 00:59:33.300
I need to go down there and have it reinforced all you guys get fresher side.

2283
00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:35.280
<v 2>Is it a calm me down and make you feel better</v>

2284
00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:37.701
<v 4>dude,</v>

2285
00:59:37.701 --> 00:59:39.680
I'm like the commerce I've been in my life.

2286
00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:42.800
I'm always going to sound like I'm in a bad mood because I have the east coast

2287
00:59:42.801 --> 00:59:43.340
accent.

2288
00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:44.173
Right?

2289
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.440
Look dude,

2290
00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:46.790
your fucking phony.

2291
00:59:46.791 --> 00:59:47.450
Calm down.

2292
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:47.961
You're like,

2293
00:59:47.961 --> 00:59:48.111
you're,

2294
00:59:48.111 --> 00:59:48.531
you're you,

2295
00:59:48.531 --> 00:59:49.850
you smoke weed.

2296
00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:55.460
<v 2>Why calm down from exercise to weed doesn't necessarily calm me down as it does</v>

2297
00:59:55.651 --> 00:59:57.210
make me just a little more sensitive.

2298
00:59:57.830 --> 00:59:58.481
Red Ban.

2299
00:59:58.481 --> 00:59:59.314
You buying this?

2300
00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:00.570
Do you think we'd calmed me down?

2301
01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:01.780
<v 4>Uh,</v>

2302
01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:02.620
yeah dude,

2303
01:00:02.621 --> 01:00:04.510
you are a completely different person.

2304
01:00:04.511 --> 01:00:09.511
Like when I met you in like 96 97 you are good guy,

2305
01:00:10.301 --> 01:00:13.900
but you wouldn't have the most intense fucking dude's I never met.

2306
01:00:13.901 --> 01:00:18.901
It was like this switch somewhere in your life was flipped and the shit was on.

2307
01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:20.650
I don't even know how you slept.

2308
01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:26.050
I would like you are like a fucking goal line defense middle linebacker.

2309
01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:27.370
That's shit doesn't mean anything to you.

2310
01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:31.510
I'm using sports analogies like you were fucking intense too.

2311
01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:34.420
And every story I heard about you at Taekwondo,

2312
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:35.740
uh,

2313
01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:36.340
events.

2314
01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:40.840
I believed all of it after meeting you for like literally about 25 seconds.

2315
01:00:41.410 --> 01:00:41.681
<v 2>Well,</v>

2316
01:00:41.681 --> 01:00:41.971
I,

2317
01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:44.950
I was transitioning then still.

2318
01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:47.050
That was still just a few weeks.

2319
01:00:47.050 --> 01:00:48.790
<v 4>You sound like a guy trying to mix the role.</v>

2320
01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:49.701
No,

2321
01:00:49.701 --> 01:00:50.350
it's true.

2322
01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:52.340
He was transgender when I was a,

2323
01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:53.490
<v 2>a young guy.</v>

2324
01:00:53.490 --> 01:00:53.761
Crazy.

2325
01:00:53.761 --> 01:00:54.551
Or when I was younger,

2326
01:00:54.551 --> 01:00:56.410
I was going through my entire,

2327
01:00:56.411 --> 01:01:00.430
my entire childhood was spent competing in martial arts tournaments from the

2328
01:01:00.431 --> 01:01:04.840
time I was like 15 to the time I was 22 was my last fight.

2329
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:08.260
<v 4>So do you think it made you like that or it tapped into something that was</v>

2330
01:01:08.261 --> 01:01:09.094
already there?

2331
01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.170
<v 2>I don't think I would have been that intense if I didn't have to deal with</v>

2332
01:01:12.171 --> 01:01:14.450
really dangerous shit on a regular basis.

2333
01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:18.230
It was the fact that you were fighting in tournament's on a regular basis and

2334
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:21.050
nothing ever happened to me.

2335
01:01:21.051 --> 01:01:22.100
I never got hurt,

2336
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:24.080
but I easily could've easily,

2337
01:01:24.081 --> 01:01:27.470
could have zigged when I should have zagged and got knocked the fuck out.

2338
01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:28.550
It just never happened.

2339
01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:31.250
I only lost once in a kickboxing match.

2340
01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:32.361
And that was not,

2341
01:01:32.361 --> 01:01:36.560
not that I didn't lose a before and taekwondo but lost once by stoppage.

2342
01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:38.720
The only time I ever got stopped was in a kickboxing match.

2343
01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:43.490
There was a third fight in a day and I was terrible nutrition back then,

2344
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:45.290
always getting sick,

2345
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:45.741
you know,

2346
01:01:45.741 --> 01:01:48.710
it didn't really take vitamins and shit and I was on the fence back then.

2347
01:01:48.711 --> 01:01:53.711
I was like doing standup and fighting at the same time so it wasn't like a bad

2348
01:01:53.931 --> 01:01:54.530
knock out.

2349
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:58.640
I got dropped by a left hook and then I got up and my legs just wouldn't work

2350
01:01:58.641 --> 01:02:00.140
and he hit me again and I fell down again.

2351
01:02:00.141 --> 01:02:00.974
They stopped the fight.

2352
01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:01.963
It was just a,

2353
01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:05.690
he had hit my jaw like in the perfect spot and everything gave out and I was

2354
01:02:05.691 --> 01:02:07.100
thinking about it like when I was,

2355
01:02:07.101 --> 01:02:09.770
when I was going back that there's one of two things I'm going to do.

2356
01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:14.800
Either I'm going to go fucking crazy now and rededicate myself and try to be a

2357
01:02:14.991 --> 01:02:19.170
world champion kickboxer and just use the fact that I got tired in the third

2358
01:02:19.171 --> 01:02:24.171
fight of the day as motivation to just run extra miles and do extra plyometrics

2359
01:02:25.501 --> 01:02:29.130
and do extra rounds or be a standup.

2360
01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:30.793
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2361
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:31.703
no brainer.

2362
01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.553
It's a no brainer.

2363
01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.430
It's like I can't,

2364
01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:34.980
there's no way.

2365
01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:36.270
<v 2>There's no reward in that.</v>

2366
01:02:36.271 --> 01:02:38.460
There was no ultimate fighting championship back then.

2367
01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:39.120
There was no,

2368
01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.300
so it's like I had to reprogram my brain.

2369
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:43.200
I ended up pro my,

2370
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.730
my brain was used to always thinking about martial arts competition.

2371
01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:48.401
That's all it was.

2372
01:02:48.401 --> 01:02:49.350
It was dodging kicks,

2373
01:02:49.351 --> 01:02:50.250
landing your own,

2374
01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:50.731
you know,

2375
01:02:50.731 --> 01:02:51.361
getting in,

2376
01:02:51.361 --> 01:02:52.830
closing the distance and you know,

2377
01:02:52.831 --> 01:02:54.330
and forcing your game plan.

2378
01:02:54.331 --> 01:02:57.270
That's what my whole day was spent fighting in my head.

2379
01:02:57.271 --> 01:03:00.680
Even if I wasn't finding I'd be fighting in my head what I was when I was a,

2380
01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:01.710
like I had girlfriends,

2381
01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:01.881
we,

2382
01:03:01.881 --> 01:03:04.270
they'd sleep over and I would,

2383
01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:08.680
I would throw kicks in the middle of the night like,

2384
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.660
like my whole body would jolt like a kick because I was having a fighting dream

2385
01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:14.440
so I was terrified.

2386
01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:15.960
I was constantly terrified.

2387
01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:19.590
I got really good at it because I was absolutely horrified of it.

2388
01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:20.311
I just didn't want to,

2389
01:03:20.311 --> 01:03:22.980
I just did not want to get my ass kicked and I was already doing it.

2390
01:03:22.981 --> 01:03:23.191
I'm like,

2391
01:03:23.191 --> 01:03:23.391
well,

2392
01:03:23.391 --> 01:03:24.330
if this is what we're doing,

2393
01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:28.470
then we've got to get really fucking good at this because this is not something

2394
01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:32.250
you can half ass dudes are kicking dudes in the face and knocking people

2395
01:03:32.251 --> 01:03:34.710
unconscious conscious like this is fucking terrifying.

2396
01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.360
I saw it happen so many times,

2397
01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:37.890
saw it happen to good friends.

2398
01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:40.020
I saw it happen to people who are better than me.

2399
01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:43.290
They just fought the wrong dude at the wrong time,

2400
01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:44.820
which easily could have happened to me.

2401
01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:45.630
It didn't,

2402
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:47.820
but it easily could have like a,

2403
01:03:47.821 --> 01:03:50.280
our instructor never protected us at all.

2404
01:03:50.281 --> 01:03:51.060
He put us even,

2405
01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:51.511
we were like,

2406
01:03:51.511 --> 01:03:52.500
kids were teenagers.

2407
01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:55.230
He would put us in the men's division and you know,

2408
01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:56.011
and tell you like,

2409
01:03:56.011 --> 01:03:58.520
you're good enough to fight as a black belt when you were like a blue belt or

2410
01:03:58.530 --> 01:03:58.980
red belt.

2411
01:03:58.980 --> 01:03:59.580
He was just,

2412
01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:01.170
he wanted to see who is crazy.

2413
01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:02.183
He wants to see,

2414
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:05.530
<v 1>he wanted to develop a team of people who didn't give a fuck.</v>

2415
01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.750
That's so funny that you could do that with kids.

2416
01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:08.520
Like that guy.

2417
01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.301
He would be on the,

2418
01:04:09.301 --> 01:04:11.530
the like at the very least local news,

2419
01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:13.150
you know,

2420
01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:14.690
it was very cultish though.

2421
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:16.750
The martial arts schools are very cultish.

2422
01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:17.081
It's,

2423
01:04:17.081 --> 01:04:17.770
yes sir.

2424
01:04:17.770 --> 01:04:18.371
No Sir.

2425
01:04:18.371 --> 01:04:20.380
It's all like almost military,

2426
01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:20.921
you know,

2427
01:04:20.921 --> 01:04:23.560
like it's always bowing when you see him.

2428
01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:24.230
You know this,

2429
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:25.450
you always bow.

2430
01:04:25.451 --> 01:04:26.141
You always call him,

2431
01:04:26.141 --> 01:04:26.710
sir.

2432
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:27.610
It was very,

2433
01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:28.060
I can,

2434
01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:28.480
I can,

2435
01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.790
I never been able to exist in that dynamic.

2436
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:31.380
I don't,

2437
01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:32.290
no matter what it was like,

2438
01:04:32.291 --> 01:04:33.320
there's no way I could,

2439
01:04:33.321 --> 01:04:34.154
uh,

2440
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.940
<v 2>I needed it.</v>

2441
01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:37.080
I grew up without a dad.

2442
01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:38.610
I grew up without a,

2443
01:04:38.611 --> 01:04:39.570
I have a Stepdad,

2444
01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.160
but my real dad,

2445
01:04:41.161 --> 01:04:43.470
I knew he was alive and I didn't communicate with them,

2446
01:04:43.471 --> 01:04:44.730
so it always fucked with me.

2447
01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:48.360
So I needed some sort of intense discipline to get my shit together.

2448
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:51.540
So the first time I ever felt like I had any control of my life at all was when

2449
01:04:51.541 --> 01:04:52.530
I started doing martial arts.

2450
01:04:52.531 --> 01:04:52.850
I was like,

2451
01:04:52.850 --> 01:04:53.610
oh,

2452
01:04:53.610 --> 01:04:54.031
finally,

2453
01:04:54.031 --> 01:04:55.870
I can fucking get good at something at this.

2454
01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:56.700
I'm good at this shit.

2455
01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:57.533
You know?

2456
01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:01.930
But so that's why I was so wound.

2457
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:03.113
You first met.

2458
01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:04.860
It took me a while to relax.

2459
01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.053
You know,

2460
01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:08.400
if you're trying to be the best in the world,

2461
01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:09.660
kick a people in the face.

2462
01:05:10.550 --> 01:05:11.383
That's it.

2463
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:12.220
<v 1>Tents,</v>

2464
01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:12.810
pursuit.

2465
01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:13.211
The few,

2466
01:05:13.211 --> 01:05:14.890
the few fighters that I have met,

2467
01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.240
most of them,

2468
01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:17.200
and I always felt,

2469
01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:18.010
it's like they

2470
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:22.120
<v 4>already proved that they are fucking guy's guy in the ring.</v>

2471
01:05:22.121 --> 01:05:23.530
That when they're hanging around,

2472
01:05:23.531 --> 01:05:24.670
they're just relaxed.

2473
01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:25.190
They don't want,

2474
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:26.380
they don't want any problems.

2475
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:28.990
Most of them are really tired from training to,

2476
01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:29.921
you know,

2477
01:05:29.921 --> 01:05:30.200
when,

2478
01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.120
when you're a fighter,

2479
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:31.421
you know,

2480
01:05:31.421 --> 01:05:31.721
man,

2481
01:05:31.721 --> 01:05:32.521
when you're not training.

2482
01:05:32.521 --> 01:05:33.480
I never thought challenge.

2483
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:34.720
I just always thought like,

2484
01:05:34.721 --> 01:05:34.871
Hey,

2485
01:05:34.871 --> 01:05:36.610
I just knocked the guy out on television,

2486
01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:39.430
no ring wearing no shirt.

2487
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:42.550
Just like bloodsport I kicked the fuck out of this guy.

2488
01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:44.590
I don't give a shit about you and your dockers.

2489
01:05:44.591 --> 01:05:45.460
Go ahead and talk shit.

2490
01:05:45.461 --> 01:05:46.121
I don't give a fuck.

2491
01:05:46.121 --> 01:05:46.740
Like I always felt,

2492
01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:47.860
I always felt like that vibe.

2493
01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:48.940
So I always felt that they were,

2494
01:05:48.941 --> 01:05:49.690
uh,

2495
01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:50.530
after I met a couple,

2496
01:05:50.531 --> 01:05:50.711
it's like,

2497
01:05:50.711 --> 01:05:50.801
oh,

2498
01:05:50.801 --> 01:05:51.360
these guys,

2499
01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:51.640
yeah,

2500
01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:52.061
they chill.

2501
01:05:52.061 --> 01:05:52.894
They don't have anything

2502
01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:53.960
<v 2>walking around.</v>

2503
01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:54.950
Definitely that too.

2504
01:05:55.070 --> 01:05:56.870
Definitely that they don't have anything to prove.

2505
01:05:57.020 --> 01:06:00.680
The worst part about being a man is dealing with dickheads,

2506
01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:01.431
you know?

2507
01:06:01.431 --> 01:06:04.670
And the less dick heads that,

2508
01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:08.300
like the smallest amount of dickheads in the world that I operate in is guys at

2509
01:06:08.301 --> 01:06:09.134
the gym.

2510
01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:10.190
Nicest guys.

2511
01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:10.760
My,

2512
01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:11.930
when I go to Jujitsu class,

2513
01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:14.420
the fucking everybody in the class is nice.

2514
01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:15.650
There's no dickheads.

2515
01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:16.190
None.

2516
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:17.420
Everybody's just training hard,

2517
01:06:17.421 --> 01:06:19.040
doing their thing and it's fun.

2518
01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.020
I think there's,

2519
01:06:21.130 --> 01:06:25.550
it's way easier to be a nice guy when you know how to fight.

2520
01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.020
It's just way easier.

2521
01:06:27.021 --> 01:06:31.430
It removes a big thing that fucks with a lot of dudes so easy.

2522
01:06:31.431 --> 01:06:32.720
If you don't know how to fight like me,

2523
01:06:32.721 --> 01:06:34.430
if you just just be nice,

2524
01:06:35.090 --> 01:06:35.910
be nice to you,

2525
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:37.070
I believe fuck with you.

2526
01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:38.360
I believe in being nice to,

2527
01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:39.530
it's not like people fuck with me.

2528
01:06:39.531 --> 01:06:44.120
I really get away with very little fucking with most people are really nice to

2529
01:06:44.121 --> 01:06:44.241
me.

2530
01:06:44.241 --> 01:06:44.631
People say,

2531
01:06:44.631 --> 01:06:44.701
oh,

2532
01:06:44.701 --> 01:06:45.321
he's a weird,

2533
01:06:45.321 --> 01:06:46.710
like people coming up to you that you know,

2534
01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:47.421
you don't know them.

2535
01:06:47.421 --> 01:06:47.691
They know.

2536
01:06:47.691 --> 01:06:48.940
You know,

2537
01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:53.360
most of the Times they're just being nice like 99.999% of the time they're being

2538
01:06:53.361 --> 01:06:54.194
nice,

2539
01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:54.591
you know?

2540
01:06:54.591 --> 01:06:55.130
So,

2541
01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:58.460
but I'd rather be the guy who can defend himself,

2542
01:06:58.790 --> 01:06:59.390
you know?

2543
01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:04.390
Then a guy who worries about some weird fucking person doing something to them.

2544
01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:09.220
I don't want to plant any theory season

2545
01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:10.580
<v 4>me,</v>

2546
01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:11.670
I don't relevantly Bev,

2547
01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:11.990
isn't it?

2548
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:15.440
I've got a live in a house now and ever since I've lived in a house,

2549
01:07:15.441 --> 01:07:20.060
now this is something fucking unsettling about that where it's just you in that

2550
01:07:20.061 --> 01:07:20.441
they come to,

2551
01:07:20.441 --> 01:07:21.410
someone comes in,

2552
01:07:21.411 --> 01:07:22.280
they're getting you.

2553
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:23.840
Whereas like an apartment building,

2554
01:07:23.841 --> 01:07:24.261
there's like,

2555
01:07:24.261 --> 01:07:25.340
there's a bunch of options.

2556
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:26.360
It's like a buffet.

2557
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.811
You know,

2558
01:07:26.811 --> 01:07:28.550
apartment building thing is weird too,

2559
01:07:28.551 --> 01:07:30.770
because you don't know what the fuck these people are up to.

2560
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.551
You know,

2561
01:07:31.551 --> 01:07:32.840
who knows what that guy,

2562
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:34.580
where's this money?

2563
01:07:34.610 --> 01:07:35.630
But I know where you live,

2564
01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:37.280
so if you're gonna do something,

2565
01:07:37.281 --> 01:07:39.800
you have to fuck with your neighbor because we're too though,

2566
01:07:39.801 --> 01:07:40.400
isn't it?

2567
01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:40.971
When you're like,

2568
01:07:40.971 --> 01:07:41.241
you know,

2569
01:07:41.241 --> 01:07:43.610
you look at each other like across the hall,

2570
01:07:43.611 --> 01:07:43.791
Hey,

2571
01:07:43.791 --> 01:07:44.180
I ain't doing,

2572
01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:44.931
you shut your door.

2573
01:07:44.931 --> 01:07:46.710
And he shuts his fucking door to his leg.

2574
01:07:46.790 --> 01:07:47.990
He's sleeping right there.

2575
01:07:47.991 --> 01:07:52.630
He's like feet away from you or he moves out and then you feel like a loser days

2576
01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:55.570
going to a better building that never,

2577
01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:57.140
that never moving back home.

2578
01:07:57.141 --> 01:07:57.711
They're always going,

2579
01:07:57.711 --> 01:07:58.460
always going,

2580
01:07:58.460 --> 01:07:59.270
moving on.

2581
01:07:59.270 --> 01:08:01.010
I remember put Patrice talk about that.

2582
01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:01.911
Uh,

2583
01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:04.310
he used to talk about how people moving out of,

2584
01:08:04.311 --> 01:08:05.144
uh,

2585
01:08:05.570 --> 01:08:06.231
when he was young,

2586
01:08:06.231 --> 01:08:07.760
when he would see neighbors moving away,

2587
01:08:07.761 --> 01:08:09.050
he would always be looking out the window,

2588
01:08:09.051 --> 01:08:09.884
all sad.

2589
01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:11.150
He would get like depressed.

2590
01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:13.761
Like,

2591
01:08:13.761 --> 01:08:14.920
I don't know why I,

2592
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:18.080
we used to laugh our asses off talking about that kind of shit.

2593
01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:20.980
Just picture a big tree.

2594
01:08:20.981 --> 01:08:23.060
So it was sad,

2595
01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:24.153
bummed out.

2596
01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:24.520
Yeah.

2597
01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:27.290
Like some sort of Christmas episode or something.

2598
01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:27.960
Uh,

2599
01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:32.960
<v 0>I lived in a real cheap apartment complex in revere when I was first moving on</v>

2600
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:34.410
out on my own.

2601
01:08:34.411 --> 01:08:36.750
I lived with a girl there and uh,

2602
01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:38.430
I remember it was really cheap.

2603
01:08:38.431 --> 01:08:39.930
It was a shady place.

2604
01:08:39.931 --> 01:08:41.580
It was thought it was not good.

2605
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:42.170
Right.

2606
01:08:42.170 --> 01:08:43.003
That was one of those.

2607
01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:46.260
And all these fucking people be cooking weird shit.

2608
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:48.600
He would walk down the hallway,

2609
01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:51.900
he'd smell all kinds of weird ethnic food.

2610
01:08:51.901 --> 01:08:53.970
It was just very strange.

2611
01:08:53.971 --> 01:08:58.500
Like the aromas of food was so potent and poor neighborhoods,

2612
01:08:58.710 --> 01:08:59.450
you know,

2613
01:08:59.450 --> 01:09:04.450
like it's very rare you walk into like a real high end apartment complex and you

2614
01:09:05.281 --> 01:09:07.280
smell something like fucking like

2615
01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:08.233
<v 4>Goulash,</v>

2616
01:09:09.610 --> 01:09:11.610
intense spices.

2617
01:09:11.611 --> 01:09:13.920
Someone's fucking making fish head soup.

2618
01:09:14.130 --> 01:09:18.310
You know what's funny is I can hear that metal door slamming in echo when I

2619
01:09:18.311 --> 01:09:21.480
first apartment and I lived in in New York when I would walk in and there's just

2620
01:09:21.481 --> 01:09:26.481
that overwhelming smell of somebody's cooking some fucking cow's head.

2621
01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:30.000
They got a market.

2622
01:09:30.001 --> 01:09:30.834
Me and Bobby used to,

2623
01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:33.990
he used to live together and this place in the upper east side with this

2624
01:09:33.991 --> 01:09:38.991
Nigerian Dooney came home one day with all this fucking meat dead he had bought

2625
01:09:39.001 --> 01:09:41.100
or whatever and being cooked,

2626
01:09:41.101 --> 01:09:43.980
Bobby Selman Bob Eight it kind of tasted a little gamey where he's like,

2627
01:09:43.981 --> 01:09:44.431
what is this?

2628
01:09:44.431 --> 01:09:45.121
And he just was like,

2629
01:09:45.121 --> 01:09:45.451
he was like,

2630
01:09:45.451 --> 01:09:46.284
it's cow.

2631
01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:46.981
He goes,

2632
01:09:46.981 --> 01:09:48.510
I know what kind he's cow.

2633
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:49.170
Like,

2634
01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:50.340
I don't know what he was eating a hook.

2635
01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.090
It was just,

2636
01:09:51.090 --> 01:09:51.923
it wasn't like

2637
01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:55.410
part of the cheek or something.

2638
01:09:55.411 --> 01:09:56.760
I don't know what the fuck he was eating,

2639
01:09:56.761 --> 01:09:58.970
but it was the weirdest looking,

2640
01:09:59.550 --> 01:10:00.570
the texture of it.

2641
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:01.920
I didn't fuck with it.

2642
01:10:02.670 --> 01:10:03.510
I didn't fuck with it.

2643
01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:04.321
That's when I,

2644
01:10:04.321 --> 01:10:08.100
Bobby should have known that he had some sort of food issue or he was starving

2645
01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:10.381
because he said,

2646
01:10:10.381 --> 01:10:10.771
fuck it.

2647
01:10:10.771 --> 01:10:10.840
I'll,

2648
01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:11.610
you know,

2649
01:10:11.610 --> 01:10:13.020
Bobby's a more open dude anyway,

2650
01:10:13.021 --> 01:10:13.441
so he was like,

2651
01:10:13.441 --> 01:10:13.591
yeah,

2652
01:10:13.591 --> 01:10:14.311
I'll try the shit.

2653
01:10:14.311 --> 01:10:14.790
And I looked at it,

2654
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:15.181
as I say,

2655
01:10:15.181 --> 01:10:16.050
I'm a fucking with that.

2656
01:10:16.051 --> 01:10:17.000
That looks like a,

2657
01:10:17.730 --> 01:10:18.750
that's like a tree stump

2658
01:10:20.370 --> 01:10:20.970
muscle avail.

2659
01:10:20.970 --> 01:10:21.803
Rump roast.

2660
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:23.340
He pukes easy easily,

2661
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.910
doesn't he?

2662
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:24.510
Does he,

2663
01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:25.210
isn't he like,

2664
01:10:25.210 --> 01:10:28.140
I have like a gag thing where he just starts puking nonstop.

2665
01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:28.950
If he hears something like,

2666
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:29.160
you know,

2667
01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:29.993
I've never know.

2668
01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:34.680
I think he does because remember like Jimmy pulled his,

2669
01:10:34.681 --> 01:10:35.340
uh,

2670
01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:36.210
he had his belly button.

2671
01:10:36.211 --> 01:10:37.320
He came in his belly button,

2672
01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:38.880
he put his finger in his belly button.

2673
01:10:38.881 --> 01:10:39.990
He's making people smell it.

2674
01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:41.060
I smelled it.

2675
01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:43.680
And why this?

2676
01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:44.790
Cause I wanted to know.

2677
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:45.160
Oh,

2678
01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.500
I wanted to know what it smelled like.

2679
01:10:46.890 --> 01:10:47.900
What it tastes like.

2680
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:50.040
Taste or you're silly bitch.

2681
01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:51.350
That's the most disgusting.

2682
01:10:51.351 --> 01:10:52.230
I did smell it though.

2683
01:10:52.710 --> 01:10:53.543
I gotta tell you though.

2684
01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:55.920
The guy asked me if I wanted to smell it.

2685
01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:56.701
You know,

2686
01:10:56.701 --> 01:10:57.151
right there.

2687
01:10:57.151 --> 01:10:57.984
I don't want to be rude.

2688
01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:01.560
The closest I ever came to puking,

2689
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:02.160
uh,

2690
01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:02.761
in public,

2691
01:11:02.761 --> 01:11:04.260
like that was on the opiate.

2692
01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:04.560
Anthea.

2693
01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:04.801
Oh,

2694
01:11:04.801 --> 01:11:05.820
you were fucking there?

2695
01:11:05.950 --> 01:11:06.783
Yeah.

2696
01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:09.780
Oh my God,

2697
01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:11.320
no before that,

2698
01:11:11.321 --> 01:11:11.650
that they,

2699
01:11:11.650 --> 01:11:12.510
when they had that the egg,

2700
01:11:12.511 --> 01:11:14.760
the egg drinking contest,

2701
01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:19.350
that to this day is the most fucked up thing sane I've ever seen.

2702
01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:21.840
And it was absolutely brilliant.

2703
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:22.880
And uh,

2704
01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:23.191
it was,

2705
01:11:23.191 --> 01:11:24.024
uh,

2706
01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:24.361
uh,

2707
01:11:24.361 --> 01:11:25.194
Nathaniel,

2708
01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.370
he named you.

2709
01:11:26.371 --> 01:11:29.760
You were the one who said the only thing they can top that is if somebody leaned

2710
01:11:29.761 --> 01:11:32.340
back and open their mouth and had somebody puke into it.

2711
01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:34.133
So you,

2712
01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.550
you had the idea and then Nathaniel name that the baby bird called it the baby

2713
01:11:38.551 --> 01:11:39.420
birds made it,

2714
01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.430
that that made it because think about,

2715
01:11:41.431 --> 01:11:43.860
do you ever seen a baby bird get fed by its mother?

2716
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:45.870
The mother essentially like opens his mouth.

2717
01:11:45.871 --> 01:11:47.880
He's like fucking JAKKS in the kid's mouth.

2718
01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:48.960
Ah,

2719
01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.310
it's so hard to watch.

2720
01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:51.660
It's so glorious.

2721
01:11:51.661 --> 01:11:52.260
You know,

2722
01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:55.260
I told that story like three days later,

2723
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:56.380
but tell the whole story.

2724
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.871
Some people,

2725
01:11:56.871 --> 01:11:59.370
the people that it was an egg,

2726
01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.260
it was an eggnog drinking contest.

2727
01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:03.680
Have you ever had,

2728
01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:04.890
even if you like Eggnog,

2729
01:12:04.891 --> 01:12:06.450
Eggnog is fucking disgusting.

2730
01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:11.580
Unbelievably sugary and heavy and a dude.

2731
01:12:11.581 --> 01:12:12.510
Every time I tell a story,

2732
01:12:12.511 --> 01:12:13.344
I start to gag.

2733
01:12:13.450 --> 01:12:13.800
Oh,

2734
01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:14.760
I haven't told it a while.

2735
01:12:14.761 --> 01:12:15.581
It's incredible story.

2736
01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:20.581
So basically what you had to do was you had to do a double shot of eggnog every

2737
01:12:20.911 --> 01:12:21.631
30 seconds.

2738
01:12:21.631 --> 01:12:22.464
So once a minute.

2739
01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:23.670
What was it was a number?

2740
01:12:23.690 --> 01:12:24.000
I don't know.

2741
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:24.301
Yeah,

2742
01:12:24.301 --> 01:12:25.051
it was like every,

2743
01:12:25.051 --> 01:12:26.070
every few seconds.

2744
01:12:26.071 --> 01:12:27.480
I don't remember what it was like once.

2745
01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:30.360
It couldn't be once a minute because he had 72 shots.

2746
01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:31.980
So it couldn't have been once a minute.

2747
01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:32.311
No,

2748
01:12:32.311 --> 01:12:34.110
he didn't know he was up to 40 something.

2749
01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:34.830
Really?

2750
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:36.750
I don't remember who the fuck do I want to say?

2751
01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.240
No you wouldn't.

2752
01:12:39.370 --> 01:12:40.203
<v 8>You might be ready.</v>

2753
01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:40.450
Yeah,

2754
01:12:40.450 --> 01:12:41.283
let's just watch it.

2755
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:45.370
That's the great Pat Duffy.

2756
01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:46.230
Get rid of this.

2757
01:12:46.230 --> 01:12:48.070
I remember this young man's name.

2758
01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:49.460
Easily an intern.

2759
01:12:49.570 --> 01:12:50.530
I remember his name.

2760
01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:53.110
Laura Savage,

2761
01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:54.523
sir.

2762
01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:58.870
Cause I can 73 73 thank you.

2763
01:12:59.260 --> 01:12:59.801
Thank you.

2764
01:12:59.801 --> 01:13:02.440
How's the memory kids 73 yeah.

2765
01:13:02.441 --> 01:13:02.951
So anyway,

2766
01:13:02.951 --> 01:13:04.210
pat from Munafiki is,

2767
01:13:04.211 --> 01:13:04.781
by the way,

2768
01:13:04.781 --> 01:13:07.810
a diabetic who lost a toe to the disease.

2769
01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:09.790
So he has to get this out.

2770
01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:12.830
It's right after comes in and it starts going and he's,

2771
01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:13.780
Oh my God,

2772
01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:14.060
I,

2773
01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:15.070
when it comes out,

2774
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:17.260
it comes out in giant pumps at first,

2775
01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:20.170
but then after a while it comes out cartoonish.

2776
01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:22.230
That's card two ways.

2777
01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:28.780
<v 7>That is cartoonish.</v>

2778
01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:34.883
That's

2779
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:37.383
cartoons.

2780
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:51.180
It's insane.

2781
01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:55.180
The sheer volume is insane.

2782
01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:01.031
Guys,

2783
01:14:01.031 --> 01:14:02.980
the Peter North to throw up.

2784
01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:10.510
Oh my God,

2785
01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:16.340
that is the most fucked up.

2786
01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:21.561
<v 0>Can't top that,</v>

2787
01:14:21.561 --> 01:14:26.560
but that was the greatest moment and only opie and Anthony will be fucking crazy

2788
01:14:26.561 --> 01:14:27.740
to have to do something like that.

2789
01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:28.990
That was amazing.

2790
01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:30.490
It was genius.

2791
01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:33.100
I've only been watching a ted talk version this whole time.

2792
01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:35.200
I just never really watched the real version.

2793
01:14:35.201 --> 01:14:37.070
I've always been watching the POW talk virgin.

2794
01:14:37.071 --> 01:14:38.290
It's so much better quality.

2795
01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:38.970
Oh yeah.

2796
01:14:38.970 --> 01:14:40.760
There's a couple of different cameras in the room.

2797
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:41.440
Huh?

2798
01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:44.860
I told that story like three days later.

2799
01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:47.710
Hook in his fucking head and that's insane.

2800
01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:50.680
Check it out and Opie and anthony.com if that's still going to try to clean his

2801
01:14:50.681 --> 01:14:51.210
head off.

2802
01:14:51.210 --> 01:14:53.260
Didn't even have a shower for this young man.

2803
01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.450
It was the craziest thing I've ever seen.

2804
01:14:56.050 --> 01:14:58.630
The greatest moment of radio history because it was just so,

2805
01:14:58.810 --> 01:15:02.540
what are the stars aligned with a guy who's 300 fucking pounds.

2806
01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:05.590
He could drink the 73 shots of egg nog

2807
01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:05.931
<v 1>this,</v>

2808
01:15:05.931 --> 01:15:09.340
there's no morning show has ever even come close to that.

2809
01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:11.630
Nothing in the neighborhood.

2810
01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:16.130
And then just the stars aligning with this Pat Duffy character being so

2811
01:15:16.131 --> 01:15:17.120
incredibly insane.

2812
01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:18.710
He had already built his way up to it.

2813
01:15:18.711 --> 01:15:22.490
He rushed to the shit that that led up to that there was all those funny

2814
01:15:22.491 --> 01:15:23.301
nicknames we had.

2815
01:15:23.301 --> 01:15:24.350
There was the one guy,

2816
01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:27.380
he would take the shot and then when someone would go to Puke,

2817
01:15:27.410 --> 01:15:28.670
because basically we didn't,

2818
01:15:28.671 --> 01:15:32.180
we didn't explain last person to not puke wins.

2819
01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:35.570
So what would happen was people be getting full of Eggnog and you're not going

2820
01:15:35.571 --> 01:15:35.931
to puke.

2821
01:15:35.931 --> 01:15:37.130
But then someone would puke,

2822
01:15:37.131 --> 01:15:38.090
which would make you feel,

2823
01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:39.620
so this fucking guy,

2824
01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:41.540
every time someone would go to Puke,

2825
01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:44.570
he would walk three steps away and just face the wall.

2826
01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:46.310
We started calling them Blair witch

2827
01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:51.830
and then there was another guy who already puked and he puked into like a

2828
01:15:51.831 --> 01:15:53.080
fucking uh,

2829
01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.560
I don't know like what do you call it?

2830
01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.040
The thank you,

2831
01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:58.970
you your pour like picture a picture he puked into that then poured it on fruit

2832
01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:03.140
loops and would start eating his own puke Froot loops to make other people puke.

2833
01:16:03.141 --> 01:16:04.280
That was the terrorist

2834
01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:10.160
because he used to taking people out with them and I just thought to with so

2835
01:16:10.161 --> 01:16:10.580
many,

2836
01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:14.930
and then I also remember terrorists is just taking people out and then there was

2837
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:19.070
pat full Munafiki the champion and after he won he kept drinking and we were

2838
01:16:19.071 --> 01:16:19.281
like,

2839
01:16:19.281 --> 01:16:20.300
like a true champion.

2840
01:16:20.301 --> 01:16:22.640
He's only competing with themselves and he just,

2841
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:24.590
he put to wreck it are like,

2842
01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.420
he crushed the record.

2843
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:27.491
He crushed it.

2844
01:16:27.491 --> 01:16:27.830
That was,

2845
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:30.350
that had to be like a gallon of Eggnog

2846
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:33.261
but yet it was like,

2847
01:16:33.261 --> 01:16:34.530
you look at these rates,

2848
01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:35.750
double shots.

2849
01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:36.650
What I mean,

2850
01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:37.490
<v 0>well he's,</v>

2851
01:16:37.490 --> 01:16:38.750
he's not lying and not online.

2852
01:16:38.930 --> 01:16:39.960
If you go and watch it,

2853
01:16:40.150 --> 01:16:42.170
you will not believe that.

2854
01:16:42.171 --> 01:16:43.004
What is the value?

2855
01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:44.450
The video you just played,

2856
01:16:44.451 --> 01:16:45.980
what version is I use a bunch of them.

2857
01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:46.161
Yeah.

2858
01:16:46.161 --> 01:16:49.580
I just went to youtube and typed in opie and Anthony,

2859
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:50.720
uh,

2860
01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:51.321
baby bird.

2861
01:16:51.321 --> 01:16:52.780
Baby bird is the first one.

2862
01:16:52.781 --> 01:16:55.730
Don't do the Pao talkers and that one's the bad quality version.

2863
01:16:55.890 --> 01:16:56.360
Okay.

2864
01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:58.070
One right below eggnog champion.

2865
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:59.640
<v 1>Most incident,</v>

2866
01:16:59.640 --> 01:16:59.841
you know,

2867
01:16:59.841 --> 01:17:00.171
just say,

2868
01:17:00.171 --> 01:17:02.770
so I've been trying to tell us I want to,

2869
01:17:02.771 --> 01:17:03.604
I told,

2870
01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:05.010
uh,

2871
01:17:05.010 --> 01:17:08.030
at Nia had one of her friends over and I was telling the story dude,

2872
01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:12.200
and I was laying on the floor crying,

2873
01:17:12.201 --> 01:17:12.860
laughing,

2874
01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:13.910
retelling the story.

2875
01:17:13.911 --> 01:17:14.960
It's like three days later,

2876
01:17:14.961 --> 01:17:16.010
wild gagging.

2877
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:19.430
And I remembered me as friend was horrified.

2878
01:17:19.431 --> 01:17:20.270
She finally says,

2879
01:17:20.271 --> 01:17:21.800
where did they get these people?

2880
01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:23.810
And that's what sent me over the top.

2881
01:17:23.811 --> 01:17:24.381
I was like,

2882
01:17:24.381 --> 01:17:25.250
I was like crying,

2883
01:17:25.251 --> 01:17:26.260
like I don't know.

2884
01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:26.991
And that was it.

2885
01:17:26.991 --> 01:17:27.824
And I,

2886
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:29.540
I almost puked.

2887
01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:33.410
Like what if I actually went into detail and went to tell that story?

2888
01:17:33.411 --> 01:17:34.580
I would start gagging again.

2889
01:17:34.581 --> 01:17:38.150
I don't think I ever won't gag telling that story.

2890
01:17:38.151 --> 01:17:39.530
That was the most disgusting thing.

2891
01:17:39.531 --> 01:17:42.450
And the amount of people on the staff who everybody gets to appoint one of

2892
01:17:42.451 --> 01:17:43.284
people who puked.

2893
01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:43.980
Oh yeah.

2894
01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:48.980
The smell of fucking stomach lining the hell it was,

2895
01:17:49.761 --> 01:17:50.400
I know he's good.

2896
01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.660
<v 0>That's my Sunday night.</v>

2897
01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:52.471
I just got to,

2898
01:17:52.471 --> 01:17:54.120
I'm now finally over that,

2899
01:17:54.150 --> 01:17:57.570
but I had food poisoning and it fucking ruined my life.

2900
01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:58.470
I it,

2901
01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:01.370
that's a great way to lose 10 pounds listening.

2902
01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:02.291
And it's true.

2903
01:18:02.291 --> 01:18:02.520
I did.

2904
01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:04.980
I did lose about nine pounds.

2905
01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:05.700
Uh,

2906
01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:05.950
for,

2907
01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:06.780
yeah.

2908
01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:07.111
Yeah.

2909
01:18:07.111 --> 01:18:08.100
That's not good dude.

2910
01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:09.360
You gotta be careful.

2911
01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:12.090
You gotta be careful what your Sushi song and I can't even eat now.

2912
01:18:12.091 --> 01:18:13.610
It makes me even feel nauseous.

2913
01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:16.860
You shouldn't use it as a time to get like in great shape.

2914
01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:17.170
Yeah.

2915
01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:18.003
I've been eating watermelon.

2916
01:18:18.150 --> 01:18:19.840
Where did you eat Sushi?

2917
01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:21.300
[inaudible] or whatever.

2918
01:18:21.301 --> 01:18:24.060
It's caught at Glendale Americana or whatever.

2919
01:18:24.090 --> 01:18:25.020
And that's a decent place.

2920
01:18:25.021 --> 01:18:25.161
Right?

2921
01:18:25.161 --> 01:18:25.994
That's a nice place.

2922
01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.930
But sushi people were like,

2923
01:18:27.931 --> 01:18:28.141
dude,

2924
01:18:28.141 --> 01:18:29.580
what the fuck you eat Sushi on a Sunday?

2925
01:18:29.581 --> 01:18:30.091
Never do that.

2926
01:18:30.091 --> 01:18:30.510
I'm like,

2927
01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:30.811
Oh yeah,

2928
01:18:30.811 --> 01:18:32.970
it was happy hour Sushi Sunday on.

2929
01:18:33.150 --> 01:18:33.630
That's probably the,

2930
01:18:33.630 --> 01:18:37.170
that's the worst time to go cause cause it's Friday Sushil fish.

2931
01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:38.073
Yeah.

2932
01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:39.293
Getting rid of it.

2933
01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:40.650
I never thought about that.

2934
01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:42.480
Why not have a seven day fish market?

2935
01:18:42.690 --> 01:18:44.020
I don't know that.

2936
01:18:44.190 --> 01:18:44.971
I guess that's the thing.

2937
01:18:44.971 --> 01:18:45.750
Sunday Sushi.

2938
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:47.700
I'd like to get Gordon Ramsey on the case.

2939
01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:50.970
It's so amazing how we've been able to cut that out of our lives.

2940
01:18:50.971 --> 01:18:52.710
That whole food gathering nonsense.

2941
01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:54.560
Like while I was watching this mountain men show,

2942
01:18:54.570 --> 01:18:57.060
watch this poor guy with she rodeo knees.

2943
01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:58.610
He's going out and looking for deer,

2944
01:18:58.620 --> 01:18:59.550
like trying to get a deer,

2945
01:18:59.551 --> 01:19:00.750
some meat for the freezer.

2946
01:19:00.810 --> 01:19:03.800
All he's looking for bears constantly like what

2947
01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:09.310
<v 1>change of life it's happened when they figured out how to cut out that whole</v>

2948
01:19:09.670 --> 01:19:12.400
gathering food that was already bad enough.

2949
01:19:12.401 --> 01:19:16.570
Bad knees looking for a deer and then he does the the over the top wild looking

2950
01:19:16.571 --> 01:19:17.440
for bears.

2951
01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:17.821
Yeah.

2952
01:19:17.821 --> 01:19:18.401
It's amazing.

2953
01:19:18.401 --> 01:19:19.350
You got to watch the show.

2954
01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:20.080
Great show.

2955
01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:20.171
No,

2956
01:19:20.171 --> 01:19:22.390
that's why I just watched it last night for the first time.

2957
01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:24.250
I'm comfortable being in the Matrix.

2958
01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:24.850
I,

2959
01:19:24.850 --> 01:19:25.181
you know,

2960
01:19:25.181 --> 01:19:25.291
I'll,

2961
01:19:25.291 --> 01:19:26.290
I'll starve to death.

2962
01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:28.930
It will be a brutal month and then that'll be it.

2963
01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:33.180
I don't want to be walking around with my bad back out in the fucking book,

2964
01:19:33.250 --> 01:19:34.660
trying to shoot deer in the face,

2965
01:19:37.090 --> 01:19:39.040
trying to gut it with some sharpened stick.

2966
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:40.650
All right.

2967
01:19:40.650 --> 01:19:40.810
I'm,

2968
01:19:40.810 --> 01:19:41.561
I'm part of the week.

2969
01:19:41.561 --> 01:19:42.490
I'm not supposed to be here.

2970
01:19:42.491 --> 01:19:43.420
That's just someone like you.

2971
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.841
You'll,

2972
01:19:43.841 --> 01:19:45.100
you'll tap back into your,

2973
01:19:45.101 --> 01:19:45.934
uh,

2974
01:19:46.090 --> 01:19:47.620
when you through kicks in at night.

2975
01:19:49.150 --> 01:19:50.370
I'll just grow.

2976
01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:53.320
Look at mountain man beard.

2977
01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:57.700
That's where animal skins make my own spears.

2978
01:19:58.050 --> 01:19:58.420
I just,

2979
01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:00.370
that's the name of good Bruce Springsteen album.

2980
01:20:00.670 --> 01:20:01.001
Make,

2981
01:20:01.001 --> 01:20:01.870
make my own spirit.

2982
01:20:03.010 --> 01:20:04.210
When I throw kicks in the night

2983
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:11.400
<v 7>two kicks</v>

2984
01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:17.083
chicks,

2985
01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:23.750
<v 1>it has to be like a breakup margin.</v>

2986
01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:32.330
It's something about being young and getting out of the town and getting away

2987
01:20:32.331 --> 01:20:36.020
from all the boozers and then you go to the chorus kicks in the night

2988
01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:40.380
<v 7>I would split,</v>

2989
01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:42.870
<v 1>he's still write songs.</v>

2990
01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:44.480
So Bruce Springsteen still out there.

2991
01:20:44.481 --> 01:20:44.750
Right?

2992
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:48.560
I have to see that guy live cause Jim Norton's finally the guy will put me over

2993
01:20:48.561 --> 01:20:53.240
the top because Jim was yet another guy who I don't want to speak for him,

2994
01:20:53.241 --> 01:20:54.740
but he didn't seem like he was a fan.

2995
01:20:54.741 --> 01:20:56.510
And then saw him live and was just like,

2996
01:20:56.511 --> 01:20:56.691
dude,

2997
01:20:56.691 --> 01:20:57.660
you got to see this guy alive.

2998
01:20:57.661 --> 01:20:58.580
He's just fucking sad.

2999
01:20:58.581 --> 01:20:58.810
I just,

3000
01:20:58.810 --> 01:20:59.621
it's as a performer.

3001
01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:00.454
You got to go see the guy.

3002
01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:00.831
Yeah,

3003
01:21:00.831 --> 01:21:02.240
that's what Brian Cowen was saying.

3004
01:21:02.241 --> 01:21:03.530
That dude's like in his sixties,

3005
01:21:03.531 --> 01:21:06.780
he does full back bends and slides on his knees on stage.

3006
01:21:06.781 --> 01:21:07.550
Just like,

3007
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.881
you know,

3008
01:21:07.881 --> 01:21:08.391
he's like,

3009
01:21:08.391 --> 01:21:09.980
he's in fucking tremendous shape.

3010
01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:11.930
Three and a half hour show.

3011
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:14.030
I did a standup show and he was one of the acts on it.

3012
01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:15.320
It's what a good what?

3013
01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:15.810
Yeah.

3014
01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:16.730
Sickest lineup ever.

3015
01:21:16.731 --> 01:21:17.480
I did a thing called,

3016
01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.670
I know I was told us on like 20 different podcasts,

3017
01:21:19.671 --> 01:21:20.450
but it's a great story.

3018
01:21:20.450 --> 01:21:21.283
I was a,

3019
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:22.101
I did this,

3020
01:21:22.101 --> 01:21:23.450
this standup for the troops.

3021
01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:24.710
It's this great benefit.

3022
01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:25.550
Um,

3023
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:29.600
it was at the beacon theater and this was the lineup was the Max Weinberg Band

3024
01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:30.471
was,

3025
01:21:30.471 --> 01:21:33.950
was the playing the music in between the acts and beforehand and after hand.

3026
01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:38.780
Jon Stewart hosted a first act out of the gate was Tony Bennett.

3027
01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:40.890
Then it was uh,

3028
01:21:40.970 --> 01:21:41.630
uh,

3029
01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:42.680
Bruce Springsteen.

3030
01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:46.100
Then they auctioned off one of Bruce Springsteen's guitar.

3031
01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:47.480
Went for like a hundred grand.

3032
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:52.990
Then Joe Mchale had to follow that somehow did that then me and then Seinfeld.

3033
01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:55.010
Oh my,

3034
01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:55.880
that was the show.

3035
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:57.020
It was insane.

3036
01:21:57.770 --> 01:21:58.640
It was insane.

3037
01:21:58.641 --> 01:21:59.990
And I remember looking over,

3038
01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:00.981
you know,

3039
01:22:00.981 --> 01:22:01.520
waiting,

3040
01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:02.270
you know,

3041
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:04.170
didn't want to go over cause that's like Jerry,

3042
01:22:04.171 --> 01:22:04.791
it is the king.

3043
01:22:04.791 --> 01:22:05.511
I don't wanna Piss the guy.

3044
01:22:05.511 --> 01:22:09.830
And I looked over and it was literally like backlit with his suit on like Jerry

3045
01:22:09.831 --> 01:22:11.060
ready to go out on stage.

3046
01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:14.020
It was like fucking iconic and it was looking over like going,

3047
01:22:14.090 --> 01:22:16.340
I'm at the beacon theater and that's Jerry Seinfeld,

3048
01:22:16.341 --> 01:22:16.551
right?

3049
01:22:16.551 --> 01:22:17.420
They're going to go on next.

3050
01:22:17.421 --> 01:22:18.254
One of the great,

3051
01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:19.850
great nights,

3052
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:20.280
uh,

3053
01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.740
of being in this businessman.

3054
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:23.930
But I saw Bruce Springs sang one song.

3055
01:22:23.931 --> 01:22:24.950
He was jumping all around.

3056
01:22:24.951 --> 01:22:26.900
I was on the piano and everything and I was just like,

3057
01:22:26.901 --> 01:22:27.111
wow,

3058
01:22:27.111 --> 01:22:27.944
this guys,

3059
01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:29.010
I can't do that.

3060
01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:30.500
This guy's got 25 years on me.

3061
01:22:30.530 --> 01:22:31.363
What song was it?

3062
01:22:31.970 --> 01:22:32.480
I Dunno.

3063
01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:33.950
I never got into his stuff.

3064
01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:36.500
So were you the first guy to do stand up on the show?

3065
01:22:36.501 --> 01:22:37.640
Mchale John Mchale.

3066
01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:38.511
Did Joe had to,

3067
01:22:38.511 --> 01:22:39.344
yeah,

3068
01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:41.031
he's a good dude,

3069
01:22:41.031 --> 01:22:41.211
man.

3070
01:22:41.211 --> 01:22:41.940
I did that.

3071
01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:42.530
Great Guy.

3072
01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:43.090
He's a great guy.

3073
01:22:43.090 --> 01:22:43.923
Really Nice Guy.

3074
01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:45.110
It's,

3075
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:48.180
it's nice to know there's still nice guys out there like you meet people,

3076
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:48.920
you know,

3077
01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:49.753
hang out with them.

3078
01:22:50.690 --> 01:22:51.523
Most people are,

3079
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:55.520
the ACG vast percentage in our business are in comparison to the way people

3080
01:22:55.521 --> 01:22:56.300
think of us.

3081
01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:57.980
People think of Comedians is being like,

3082
01:22:57.981 --> 01:23:00.800
comedians are always miserable to hate life.

3083
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:02.740
They're really only funny when they're on stage.

3084
01:23:03.370 --> 01:23:04.970
There's a lot of stereotypes that go along with being,

3085
01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:06.193
and a lot of them is

3086
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:08.340
<v 2>a lot of truth in that for a while.</v>

3087
01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:09.130
Some,

3088
01:23:09.130 --> 01:23:10.840
but the vast majority,

3089
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:11.920
you were miserable for a while.

3090
01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:13.173
Yeah.

3091
01:23:13.290 --> 01:23:14.290
And we'll lay dead.

3092
01:23:14.291 --> 01:23:14.621
Just,

3093
01:23:14.621 --> 01:23:15.450
you know

3094
01:23:15.450 --> 01:23:18.180
<v 4>what happens in your late twenties and early thirties when you don't think</v>

3095
01:23:18.181 --> 01:23:19.410
you're a psycho and you're not,

3096
01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:20.580
you don't think you're out of your mind.

3097
01:23:20.581 --> 01:23:21.570
And then you realize,

3098
01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:21.721
oh,

3099
01:23:21.721 --> 01:23:23.970
wait a minute and I'm completely out of my fucking mind.

3100
01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:25.260
I'm just,

3101
01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:25.760
you know,

3102
01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:25.960
you,

3103
01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:29.550
you know what you just walking around saying hello to people.

3104
01:23:29.551 --> 01:23:29.821
Hi,

3106
01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:31.200
Nice to meet Ya.

3107
01:23:31.230 --> 01:23:31.501
You know,

3108
01:23:31.501 --> 01:23:33.180
paying your bills on time and you think you're,

3109
01:23:33.690 --> 01:23:36.210
you're normal and a that all of a sudden,

3110
01:23:36.211 --> 01:23:36.760
you know,

3111
01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.100
if some shit happens and you're like,

3112
01:23:38.130 --> 01:23:38.641
Oh fuck,

3113
01:23:38.641 --> 01:23:39.300
I'm this guy.

3114
01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:40.170
I need to work on this,

3115
01:23:40.171 --> 01:23:40.981
need to work on that.

3116
01:23:40.981 --> 01:23:41.814
And uh,

3117
01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:43.050
you know,

3118
01:23:43.050 --> 01:23:47.160
hopefully you make the right choices by the time you get to your late thirties.

3119
01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:47.701
I know.

3120
01:23:47.701 --> 01:23:48.930
This is just how it happened for me.

3121
01:23:48.931 --> 01:23:49.520
I started like

3122
01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:50.520
<v 2>level and out and being like,</v>

3123
01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:50.750
alright,

3124
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:52.940
what am I going to be angry the rest of my fucking life?

3125
01:23:53.710 --> 01:23:54.710
I certainly do though too.

3126
01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:55.550
You know what I mean?

3127
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:59.000
Pot can't be 100% to blame for me calming down,

3128
01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:00.373
but uh,

3129
01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:01.140
<v 4>no,</v>

3130
01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:02.930
the devil comes that point.

3131
01:24:02.931 --> 01:24:04.760
You're either going to steer it into the wall.

3132
01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:05.300
Oh,

3133
01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:05.631
you're going to,

3134
01:24:05.631 --> 01:24:07.340
is going to try to chill a little bit.

3135
01:24:07.341 --> 01:24:07.850
But yeah,

3136
01:24:07.850 --> 01:24:08.840
getting back to the other thing though,

3137
01:24:08.841 --> 01:24:09.101
this,

3138
01:24:09.101 --> 01:24:14.100
there's just way too many talented fucking people in this business for you too.

3139
01:24:14.210 --> 01:24:14.961
I feel to,

3140
01:24:14.961 --> 01:24:18.140
even if you were a dick to get away with it for,

3141
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:21.800
because all they're waiting for is that first project you do to flop.

3142
01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:23.210
They just looking for,

3143
01:24:23.211 --> 01:24:24.770
I mean that they're going to hang with you a while.

3144
01:24:24.771 --> 01:24:24.870
He,

3145
01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:25.880
while you're making them money.

3146
01:24:25.881 --> 01:24:26.190
But I,

3147
01:24:26.190 --> 01:24:28.620
<v 2>well there are a lot of people that are decks and you know,</v>

3148
01:24:28.621 --> 01:24:29.610
and then they stop working.

3149
01:24:29.670 --> 01:24:30.091
I mean that,

3150
01:24:30.091 --> 01:24:34.050
I've have friends that are directors and tell me horror stories about having to

3151
01:24:34.051 --> 01:24:37.160
work with some crazy lady who yells at them the set and you know,

3152
01:24:37.161 --> 01:24:40.490
w demands changes to our character because the character wouldn't do this.

3153
01:24:40.491 --> 01:24:41.140
And I'm like,

3154
01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:41.671
my God,

3155
01:24:41.671 --> 01:24:43.890
we've got to get through this fucking season with her and then they gonna kill

3156
01:24:43.891 --> 01:24:45.140
her off me.

3157
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:48.510
Cause like they tell you stories about shit like that and you're like,

3158
01:24:48.810 --> 01:24:49.231
God,

3159
01:24:49.231 --> 01:24:50.064
this business,

3160
01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:52.250
<v 4>you can get away with that for a little while.</v>

3161
01:24:52.251 --> 01:24:53.040
But like all,

3162
01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:53.510
you know,

3163
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:56.870
not very often that the next few was getting off the bus every day.

3164
01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:57.560
You know what I mean?

3165
01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.360
If you're just going to go the performer route,

3166
01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:01.460
so there's always going to be somebody younger,

3167
01:25:01.461 --> 01:25:02.450
fresher face,

3168
01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:03.290
whatever.

3169
01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:05.270
So you can't,

3170
01:25:05.271 --> 01:25:05.630
I dunno,

3171
01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:07.060
I dunno how you survive doing,

3172
01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:07.881
doing it the other way.

3173
01:25:07.881 --> 01:25:08.714
So

3174
01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:12.830
I've yet to be on anything.

3175
01:25:12.831 --> 01:25:13.071
I mean,

3176
01:25:13.071 --> 01:25:14.150
I'm done a lot of acting stuff,

3177
01:25:14.151 --> 01:25:14.661
but everybody,

3178
01:25:14.661 --> 01:25:16.210
everything I've ever done it,

3179
01:25:16.230 --> 01:25:17.840
everybody has been unbelievably nice.

3180
01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:18.310
Yeah.

3181
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:19.121
<v 2>But we all know guys,</v>

3182
01:25:19.121 --> 01:25:21.880
especially comics that are kind of cons.

3183
01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:23.111
Yeah.

3184
01:25:23.111 --> 01:25:24.070
But how far did they get?

3185
01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:26.320
Some get pretty far.

3186
01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:27.440
They get,

3187
01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:28.090
dude,

3188
01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:28.750
you killing me.

3189
01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:30.310
I was thinking there was a justice in the world.

3190
01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:30.720
No.

3191
01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:31.180
Well the,

3192
01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:32.380
well the ones,

3193
01:25:32.530 --> 01:25:33.970
the examples that I could pull up,

3194
01:25:34.330 --> 01:25:34.571
you know,

3195
01:25:34.571 --> 01:25:36.930
especially my favorite example is kind of,

3196
01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:38.440
we've been diffused,

3197
01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:39.340
you know,

3198
01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:43.690
but men see is a bad guy and that's the zoo's a vindictive guy.

3199
01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:45.670
Like what he was doing the comics was,

3200
01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:47.380
he was going after them.

3201
01:25:47.710 --> 01:25:50.260
I take their shit and do it right before they went on stage.

3202
01:25:50.290 --> 01:25:50.981
Like that kind of thing.

3203
01:25:50.981 --> 01:25:52.360
Take your clothes a bit too.

3204
01:25:52.361 --> 01:25:53.380
Right before you go up,

3205
01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:55.210
try and kick your legs out from under you.

3206
01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:58.780
That was a bad guy and that was the guy who did it for a long time.

3207
01:25:59.350 --> 01:26:00.820
He did it for a long time.

3208
01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:04.040
It didn't last because eventually people figured it out.

3209
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:06.920
But for a long time it did work.

3210
01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.140
<v 1>Sign bad.</v>

3211
01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:10.910
I've never had to be around somebody like that.

3212
01:26:11.170 --> 01:26:12.003
We're lucky.

3213
01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.350
Showbiz is shelters them though.

3214
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:16.960
There's a little bit of Shell subtle stuff I've been around,

3215
01:26:16.961 --> 01:26:17.621
but like nothing,

3216
01:26:17.621 --> 01:26:18.070
nothing.

3217
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.903
Uh,

3218
01:26:19.090 --> 01:26:20.290
to that hard core level.

3219
01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:23.280
I keep thinking that's Ellen degenerate.

3220
01:26:24.010 --> 01:26:24.191
Who,

3221
01:26:24.191 --> 01:26:24.791
you know,

3222
01:26:24.791 --> 01:26:25.624
Hillary Clinton

3223
01:26:28.050 --> 01:26:29.310
thought you was talking about now

3224
01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:33.620
though,

3225
01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:35.140
you're looking at your video.

3226
01:26:36.210 --> 01:26:37.043
No,

3227
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:38.031
Ellen's way,

3228
01:26:38.031 --> 01:26:38.680
way better.

3229
01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:40.360
Way Better looking than Jesus Christ.

3230
01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:41.313
Don't do that to her.

3231
01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:43.090
I just out of the corner of my eye,

3232
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:44.471
Hillary Clinton,

3233
01:26:44.471 --> 01:26:45.304
she's got

3234
01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:49.780
Ellen degeneres is old school haircut.

3235
01:26:50.530 --> 01:26:53.710
Hillary Clinton who she stole from Wayne Gretzky if you want to really want to

3236
01:26:53.711 --> 01:26:54.544
be honest.

3237
01:26:54.970 --> 01:26:55.390
Yeah.

3238
01:26:55.390 --> 01:26:56.223
That's uh,

3239
01:26:57.310 --> 01:26:57.521
yeah.

3240
01:26:57.521 --> 01:26:58.150
Wayne Gretzky.

3241
01:26:58.150 --> 01:26:58.900
Wayne Gretzky.

3242
01:26:58.900 --> 01:26:59.140
Okay.

3243
01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:00.990
I the case she had the head.

3244
01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:05.670
This is how that haircut goes before her LNG generous cash as well.

3245
01:27:05.770 --> 01:27:07.540
Before that it was Wayne Gretzky,

3246
01:27:07.541 --> 01:27:09.710
Patrick sleazy brothers pronouns.

3247
01:27:12.990 --> 01:27:13.750
He hasn't main,

3248
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:16.600
mainly about the eighties is a guy had Hillary Clinton's hair.

3249
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:19.600
Like a lot of guys had Hillary Clinton's hair cut in the 80s.

3250
01:27:21.190 --> 01:27:21.701
I would have,

3251
01:27:21.701 --> 01:27:23.440
if my hair didn't grow out like an Afro,

3252
01:27:23.441 --> 01:27:24.460
I would have rocked that thing.

3253
01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:26.193
I tried to grow,

3254
01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:26.980
grow the mullet.

3255
01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:27.790
I did,

3256
01:27:27.790 --> 01:27:29.650
but my hair was too wood to Afro.

3257
01:27:29.651 --> 01:27:30.820
Wish it would just grow out.

3258
01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:35.320
So I look like a redheaded one Epstein.

3259
01:27:35.321 --> 01:27:35.801
So I was like,

3260
01:27:35.801 --> 01:27:37.300
I can't do this one.

3261
01:27:37.530 --> 01:27:39.220
He hits us with a welcome back,

3262
01:27:39.221 --> 01:27:40.270
Kotter reference.

3263
01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:43.390
Nobody knows who won.

3264
01:27:43.391 --> 01:27:44.224
I've seen his man.

3265
01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:45.430
He just passed away.

3266
01:27:45.610 --> 01:27:48.210
He did just be passed away a few years,

3267
01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:49.570
a few months back.

3268
01:27:49.970 --> 01:27:50.803
<v 2>Ah,</v>

3269
01:27:50.970 --> 01:27:52.590
he played my brother on Newsradio.

3270
01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:54.030
He dead.

3271
01:27:54.030 --> 01:27:55.170
How cool was it to meet him?

3272
01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:56.213
It was cool.

3273
01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:56.731
And it was,

3274
01:27:56.731 --> 01:27:57.564
um,

3275
01:27:58.110 --> 01:27:58.831
Nick Depaulo,

3276
01:27:58.831 --> 01:28:00.330
Brian Cowen and uh,

3277
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:01.950
an Epstein from welcome back.

3278
01:28:01.970 --> 01:28:02.803
Kotter.

3279
01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:05.460
Did he tell you any,

3280
01:28:05.461 --> 01:28:05.821
any,

3281
01:28:05.821 --> 01:28:06.060
uh,

3282
01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:07.260
one Epstein stories?

3283
01:28:07.630 --> 01:28:10.230
They're just happy to be working a nice guy to be around.

3284
01:28:10.290 --> 01:28:11.160
Friendly Guy.

3285
01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:12.211
It's hard for them.

3286
01:28:12.211 --> 01:28:14.430
And it's hard for a lot of those dudes that didn't work.

3287
01:28:14.431 --> 01:28:15.090
You know,

3288
01:28:15.090 --> 01:28:15.720
they uh,

3289
01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:18.810
they did this big hit Sitcom and then they had a hard time getting work after

3290
01:28:18.811 --> 01:28:18.901
it.

3291
01:28:18.901 --> 01:28:22.500
And meanwhile John Travolta takes off and becomes his fucking gigantic movie

3292
01:28:22.501 --> 01:28:24.540
star and just sort of eclipse is them.

3293
01:28:24.690 --> 01:28:29.100
And then it becomes a story of well how come these guys haven't gotten any work

3294
01:28:29.101 --> 01:28:31.320
with John Travolta is a superstar.

3295
01:28:31.321 --> 01:28:31.471
You know,

3296
01:28:31.471 --> 01:28:34.140
we're in the same movie TV show is John Travolta.

3297
01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:35.790
How come you're not a superstar?

3298
01:28:36.030 --> 01:28:39.000
<v 1>I don't know how actors do it because like if you're on,</v>

3299
01:28:39.010 --> 01:28:41.700
if you're on a movie and an end as a convenient,

3300
01:28:41.701 --> 01:28:42.271
you still have it.

3301
01:28:42.271 --> 01:28:43.770
You just be a comedian,

3302
01:28:43.771 --> 01:28:47.370
then you put it on a new hour special and you can like reinvent yourself and all

3303
01:28:47.371 --> 01:28:47.551
that.

3304
01:28:47.551 --> 01:28:51.070
Like I think trying to make it just as like an actor or character actors,

3305
01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:52.200
one of the hardest things ever,

3306
01:28:52.350 --> 01:28:54.060
<v 2>it's gotta be brutal sinner on what,</v>

3307
01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:56.810
and that's why so many of them were so phony cause they,

3308
01:28:56.811 --> 01:28:58.630
they're constantly being politicians.

3309
01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:01.560
They constantly have to sort of protect image.

3310
01:29:01.561 --> 01:29:02.010
And sell

3311
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:03.060
<v 1>a certain image and you know,</v>

3312
01:29:03.061 --> 01:29:04.140
they got to try to push things.

3313
01:29:04.141 --> 01:29:05.760
Same thing like with actors.

3314
01:29:05.761 --> 01:29:06.810
I find that Nice.

3315
01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:09.480
So it's definitely a different energy.

3316
01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.190
It's a much more,

3317
01:29:11.191 --> 01:29:11.970
uh,

3318
01:29:11.970 --> 01:29:13.680
not as intense.

3319
01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:15.273
Lez Comics.

3320
01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:15.690
Yeah.

3321
01:29:15.690 --> 01:29:16.111
Comics,

3322
01:29:16.111 --> 01:29:16.830
you know,

3323
01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:17.221
comics,

3324
01:29:17.221 --> 01:29:18.570
just the did the,

3325
01:29:18.630 --> 01:29:19.770
you're up there by yourself.

3326
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:21.000
People are going to heckle you.

3327
01:29:21.001 --> 01:29:21.181
You're,

3328
01:29:21.181 --> 01:29:22.340
you have defense.

3329
01:29:23.010 --> 01:29:26.490
Defense is up where they're kind of more like a,

3330
01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:27.810
they're a little more open,

3331
01:29:27.811 --> 01:29:28.021
you know,

3332
01:29:28.021 --> 01:29:28.171
they,

3333
01:29:28.171 --> 01:29:28.441
they,

3334
01:29:28.441 --> 01:29:32.190
they came about this and like acting class and everybody's got to go up there

3335
01:29:32.191 --> 01:29:36.450
and as much more healthier sort of easing into this business.

3336
01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:39.870
But I mean that's the only way to be as a comic.

3337
01:29:39.871 --> 01:29:40.070
Give it.

3338
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:41.670
So it's a nutty fucking business.

3339
01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:41.851
No,

3340
01:29:41.851 --> 01:29:42.420
absolutely.

3341
01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:43.171
Go on stage.

3342
01:29:43.171 --> 01:29:46.830
And it was some shit that you wrote down and made up and you're going to tell it

3343
01:29:46.831 --> 01:29:47.300
to these people.

3344
01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:48.133
They're going to laugh,

3345
01:29:48.210 --> 01:29:49.043
are you sure?

3346
01:29:49.570 --> 01:29:53.770
And they got to pay money to hear that for an actual isn't the biggest surprise.

3347
01:29:54.090 --> 01:29:55.320
The first time you did that,

3348
01:29:55.321 --> 01:29:55.861
you wrote something,

3349
01:29:55.861 --> 01:29:58.500
you thought it was gonna be funny and then you just say it and there's nothing,

3350
01:29:58.501 --> 01:30:01.110
just that fucking invisible kicked in the chest.

3351
01:30:01.111 --> 01:30:02.550
You're so confused.

3352
01:30:02.551 --> 01:30:05.130
Like I knew this was going to be a huge bit for me.

3353
01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:09.510
Like I didn't think I found my new closer or what's worse was when you had one

3354
01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:12.570
and it destroyed and then you went out in the first time.

3355
01:30:12.571 --> 01:30:14.970
You tried to recreate what you did the night before.

3356
01:30:14.971 --> 01:30:16.500
But you were thinking about the night before.

3357
01:30:16.501 --> 01:30:18.570
But he didn't realize the reason why it didn't work.

3358
01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:21.060
The reason why it worked before it was cause you were in the moment then you

3359
01:30:21.061 --> 01:30:24.870
tried to do what you did the night before and it falls flat and that quiet ride

3360
01:30:24.871 --> 01:30:25.740
home with yourself.

3361
01:30:25.950 --> 01:30:26.251
Yeah.

3362
01:30:26.251 --> 01:30:26.700
And this,

3363
01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:29.640
there is the reality of different fucking crowds.

3364
01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:30.091
You know,

3365
01:30:30.091 --> 01:30:34.350
a lot of people like to say it's never the crowd that is absolute horse shit

3366
01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:38.130
because there's some crazy fucking crowds and there's some crowds.

3367
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:39.900
We tell a joke,

3368
01:30:39.901 --> 01:30:40.201
you know,

3369
01:30:40.201 --> 01:30:41.370
it's a great fucking joke.

3370
01:30:41.371 --> 01:30:42.960
This is your fucking ace in the hole.

3371
01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:44.010
Starting off slow,

3372
01:30:44.011 --> 01:30:46.200
but I'm going to hit them with this and away we go.

3373
01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:47.183
And clunk,

3374
01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:48.750
it just comes out like this.

3375
01:30:48.751 --> 01:30:48.961
No,

3376
01:30:48.961 --> 01:30:49.794
this is the CRA.

3377
01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:51.390
There's something wrong with this fucking crowd.

3378
01:30:51.810 --> 01:30:52.051
You know,

3379
01:30:52.051 --> 01:30:53.070
when you're just showing up,

3380
01:30:53.190 --> 01:30:55.250
did you do any strip clubs or anything like that?

3381
01:30:55.251 --> 01:30:55.801
And did you ever,

3382
01:30:55.801 --> 01:30:55.980
uh,

3383
01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:56.530
MC,

3384
01:30:56.530 --> 01:30:57.220
uh,

3385
01:30:57.220 --> 01:30:59.730
Wasstrip Cloer strip clubs,

3386
01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:00.780
rock and roll show.

3387
01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:03.240
I'm trying to filter all the ones that I went to and I'm trying to think if

3388
01:31:03.241 --> 01:31:04.074
there's ever a show

3389
01:31:05.730 --> 01:31:07.960
there ever shown.

3390
01:31:08.290 --> 01:31:08.940
Yes.

3391
01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:09.830
Did you ever do rotate?

3392
01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:10.560
You did.

3393
01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:10.921
I did.

3394
01:31:10.921 --> 01:31:11.311
I did.

3395
01:31:11.311 --> 01:31:12.144
There was,

3396
01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:14.790
there was this titty bar in New York City,

3397
01:31:15.450 --> 01:31:16.171
but this was,

3398
01:31:16.171 --> 01:31:16.801
it was weird.

3399
01:31:16.801 --> 01:31:18.450
Like on the other side was the titty bar.

3400
01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:20.700
It was during that Giuliani stuff where he was like,

3401
01:31:20.701 --> 01:31:20.971
okay,

3402
01:31:20.971 --> 01:31:22.920
40% of this can't be pornography,

3403
01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:24.313
pornography,

3404
01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:25.253
pornography,

3405
01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:25.981
pornographic,

3406
01:31:25.981 --> 01:31:27.300
pornographic pornography,

3407
01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:28.040
pornography.

3408
01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:28.271
See,

3409
01:31:28.271 --> 01:31:29.104
I'll fucking,

3410
01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:32.910
I was trying to say pornographic.

3411
01:31:33.150 --> 01:31:37.120
I said pornography and I thought I was on the right track and I just kept going

3412
01:31:37.121 --> 01:31:37.850
for pornography,

3413
01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:38.171
putting it on,

3414
01:31:38.171 --> 01:31:39.060
it's going to come to you.

3415
01:31:39.090 --> 01:31:39.923
It's gonna

3416
01:31:42.290 --> 01:31:43.500
fuck pornographic.

3417
01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:44.910
So uh,

3418
01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:45.300
so,

3419
01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:49.020
so technically we were there but there was no girls walking around with like

3420
01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:51.690
[inaudible] or anything like that.

3421
01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:52.981
I just might,

3422
01:31:52.981 --> 01:31:53.341
as we remember,

3423
01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:54.810
some girl told me a street joke,

3424
01:31:54.811 --> 01:31:55.860
a really bad street joke

3425
01:31:57.500 --> 01:31:59.140
and involve lifting up,

3426
01:31:59.141 --> 01:31:59.560
addressing,

3427
01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:00.371
show me her pussy.

3428
01:32:00.371 --> 01:32:01.011
What the hell was it?

3429
01:32:01.011 --> 01:32:01.211
And I,

3430
01:32:01.211 --> 01:32:02.770
and I couldn't get to the heart to tell him that.

3431
01:32:02.770 --> 01:32:06.220
I already heard that joke and she went all the way with getting like the Tattoo.

3432
01:32:06.650 --> 01:32:07.570
Did you want to see my,

3433
01:32:08.110 --> 01:32:09.250
I want to see my pussy.

3434
01:32:09.310 --> 01:32:10.660
That's what she wants to eat my pussy.

3435
01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:14.290
She lifts up her skirt and it's a tattoo of a cat and says I guess a mouse aided

3436
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:15.040
or what?

3437
01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:15.631
I had a flux.

3438
01:32:15.631 --> 01:32:16.360
Is it go?

3439
01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:17.193
Oh I don't know.

3440
01:32:17.530 --> 01:32:19.000
I think that's a tattoo of a cat.

3441
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:20.020
How the fuck does that go?

3442
01:32:20.110 --> 01:32:20.943
I don't know.

3443
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:23.170
I can't remember the end of the joke.

3444
01:32:23.230 --> 01:32:25.120
And she did it and I had already heard the joke and I want,

3445
01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:28.090
I laughed anyways cause I didn't have the heart to be like,

3446
01:32:28.091 --> 01:32:28.241
yeah,

3447
01:32:28.241 --> 01:32:29.080
I already heard that one.

3448
01:32:29.081 --> 01:32:30.880
Someone else says that joke on their body.

3449
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:32.663
Um,

3450
01:32:32.770 --> 01:32:33.910
am I bombing at this point?

3451
01:32:33.911 --> 01:32:34.660
I feel like I am,

3452
01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:35.441
I have to go.

3453
01:32:35.441 --> 01:32:36.101
I have to go to this,

3454
01:32:36.101 --> 01:32:36.341
this,

3455
01:32:36.341 --> 01:32:36.830
this,

3456
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:38.350
this pit pit bull thing.

3457
01:32:38.350 --> 01:32:38.710
Yeah.

3458
01:32:38.710 --> 01:32:39.640
What does the pit bull thing?

3459
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:40.540
I Dunno.

3460
01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:41.320
They're always,

3461
01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:41.441
oh,

3462
01:32:41.441 --> 01:32:42.370
it's for a shelter,

3463
01:32:42.670 --> 01:32:45.160
but it gets people to a rescue.

3464
01:32:45.161 --> 01:32:48.820
Those beautiful dogs that are fucking awesome and they have your back and

3465
01:32:48.821 --> 01:32:52.380
they'll love you to death in the face off to come to the door.

3466
01:32:52.381 --> 01:32:54.220
Tough action around other dogs.

3467
01:32:54.310 --> 01:32:55.300
You have to be careful.

3468
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:56.423
You know what it's like.

3469
01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:57.273
It's like,

3470
01:32:57.580 --> 01:32:59.590
it's like driving a sports car.

3471
01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:01.380
You have a lethal weapon that there's,

3472
01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:01.810
there's,

3473
01:33:01.810 --> 01:33:03.040
there's a responsibility.

3474
01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:04.210
It's like owning a gun.

3475
01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:05.260
It's like anything else.

3476
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:08.170
It's not like either one of those things because you can control both of those

3477
01:33:08.171 --> 01:33:08.530
things.

3478
01:33:08.530 --> 01:33:09.790
You can't control an animal.

3479
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.130
You need to step into my Dojo dogs.

3480
01:33:15.190 --> 01:33:15.440
Uh,

3481
01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:16.810
I love pit bulls to death,

3482
01:33:16.811 --> 01:33:18.100
but they're dangerous dogs.

3483
01:33:18.250 --> 01:33:19.240
They are dangerous dogs.

3484
01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:20.170
But you respect that,

3485
01:33:20.171 --> 01:33:22.120
but you have to respect that they are dangerous.

3486
01:33:22.121 --> 01:33:25.960
That's why I worked with a trainer for like almost a year and at this point me

3487
01:33:25.961 --> 01:33:27.220
and my girl could take a dog,

3488
01:33:27.221 --> 01:33:30.610
walk it through a bunch of five year olds holding raw meat and there wouldn't be

3489
01:33:30.611 --> 01:33:31.480
a fucking problem.

3490
01:33:31.930 --> 01:33:32.560
It just wouldn't be.

3491
01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:33.400
You say that,

3492
01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:36.880
but you don't know that because dawn's do strange things.

3493
01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:38.440
I had a dog killed one of my dogs.

3494
01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:39.700
Yeah,

3495
01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:40.030
I know.

3496
01:33:40.030 --> 01:33:42.850
Came home and saw a fucking bloodbath in the kitchen.

3497
01:33:42.851 --> 01:33:43.890
I never would have signed up.

3498
01:33:43.891 --> 01:33:44.231
Did that.

3499
01:33:44.231 --> 01:33:44.560
I know,

3500
01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:45.161
but also,

3501
01:33:45.161 --> 01:33:47.590
but how much did you read up on the breed before you got it?

3502
01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:47.921
Oh,

3503
01:33:47.921 --> 01:33:48.610
I read up a lot.

3504
01:33:48.610 --> 01:33:49.301
I've had them for years.

3505
01:33:49.301 --> 01:33:50.770
I've had them for most of my life.

3506
01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:51.933
I don't want to get into this.

3507
01:33:52.230 --> 01:33:52.510
Look,

3508
01:33:52.510 --> 01:33:53.480
I love the dogs.

3509
01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:54.250
I like dogs.

3510
01:33:54.250 --> 01:33:54.881
I sat here,

3511
01:33:54.881 --> 01:33:56.770
I supported you and your lifestyle.

3512
01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:59.800
And as I'm walking out hyping my fucking little charity thing,

3513
01:33:59.801 --> 01:34:00.371
I'm going to,

3514
01:34:00.371 --> 01:34:01.630
all of a sudden I'm getting static.

3515
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.961
I see.

3516
01:34:01.961 --> 01:34:02.794
I see how this game is.

3517
01:34:03.090 --> 01:34:03.923
You know what this is,

3518
01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:04.893
do love them.

3519
01:34:04.930 --> 01:34:05.980
This is a bait and switch.

3520
01:34:06.010 --> 01:34:06.791
I do love them.

3521
01:34:06.791 --> 01:34:07.380
And I am.

3522
01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:08.213
I

3523
01:34:09.790 --> 01:34:10.270
look at it,

3524
01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:11.050
don't,

3525
01:34:11.050 --> 01:34:12.400
all dogs are fucking nuts.

3526
01:34:13.470 --> 01:34:14.303
I'm nuts.

3527
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:15.460
These are great dogs.

3528
01:34:15.461 --> 01:34:17.980
I don't find it that it's tougher than I'll ever be.

3529
01:34:17.981 --> 01:34:18.271
It's like,

3530
01:34:18.271 --> 01:34:18.521
well you know,

3531
01:34:18.521 --> 01:34:19.630
you ever see my body guard?

3532
01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:20.680
That's what my dog is.

3533
01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:22.640
I'm like the little nerd riding on the handlebars.

3534
01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:25.150
Trying to find that piece for the carburetor.

3535
01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:26.373
You have a pit bull?

3536
01:34:26.410 --> 01:34:26.980
Yes I do.

3537
01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:28.390
How was he around other dogs?

3538
01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:29.360
Uh,

3539
01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:32.740
like slow dogs gets competitive with big dogs so we don't take it to the dog

3540
01:34:32.741 --> 01:34:33.370
park.

3541
01:34:33.370 --> 01:34:34.360
Problem solved.

3542
01:34:35.290 --> 01:34:38.020
Just to make sure that you have like a sturdy leash and he never had him around

3543
01:34:38.021 --> 01:34:38.381
dogs.

3544
01:34:38.381 --> 01:34:38.860
Right?

3545
01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:39.450
Yeah,

3546
01:34:39.450 --> 01:34:40.930
I have way beyond them.

3547
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:42.250
That's like me saying,

3548
01:34:42.251 --> 01:34:42.820
listen,

3549
01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:45.720
make sure you don't stick your thumbs in here when you make a fist.

3550
01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:47.500
That's what you're saying to me right now.

3551
01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:48.490
Okay.

3552
01:34:48.490 --> 01:34:48.971
No I'm not,

3553
01:34:48.971 --> 01:34:49.890
I'm not even suggesting it.

3554
01:34:49.891 --> 01:34:51.130
I'm just asking you how you do it.

3555
01:34:51.131 --> 01:34:51.791
Like what is your,

3556
01:34:51.791 --> 01:34:52.860
do you have a philosophy behind it?

3557
01:34:52.861 --> 01:34:54.250
Cause some people don't have that philosophy.

3558
01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:55.120
They just say,

3559
01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:57.300
I see problems come in and I just across um,

3560
01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.040
across the street,

3561
01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:58.640
<v 2>I just,</v>

3562
01:34:58.640 --> 01:34:59.080
you know,

3563
01:34:59.080 --> 01:34:59.230
<v 4>they,</v>

3564
01:34:59.230 --> 01:35:02.140
everybody has an opinion of martial arts version of just avoiding the fight.

3565
01:35:02.230 --> 01:35:02.660
Yeah,

3566
01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:03.480
absolutely.

3567
01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:05.250
There's that hoping that their collar,

3568
01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:06.161
yeah.

3569
01:35:06.161 --> 01:35:07.510
You got to have the right kind of college.

3570
01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:08.890
You have to know what to do with the call.

3571
01:35:08.891 --> 01:35:10.360
If you know what to do and how to hold the leash,

3572
01:35:10.361 --> 01:35:12.760
you can get that thing going to go the same way you get something in a hold and

3573
01:35:12.761 --> 01:35:14.020
where they want to stand up and sit down,

3574
01:35:14.021 --> 01:35:15.130
they have no fucking control.

3575
01:35:15.310 --> 01:35:15.461
Right.

3576
01:35:15.461 --> 01:35:15.970
Because they're like,

3577
01:35:15.970 --> 01:35:16.780
ah.

3578
01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:17.920
It's the same thing with like,

3579
01:35:18.430 --> 01:35:19.120
you know,

3580
01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:19.880
the next line,

3581
01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:20.713
<v 2>that point.</v>

3582
01:35:21.650 --> 01:35:22.483
Bye.

3583
01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:24.473
Okay.

3584
01:35:25.930 --> 01:35:26.763
Yeah.

3585
01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:33.853
Choker collar.

3586
01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:34.350
Yeah.

3587
01:35:34.350 --> 01:35:34.590
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

3588
01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:35.423
The ones with,

3589
01:35:35.890 --> 01:35:36.260
no,

3590
01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:36.560
no,

3591
01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:36.780
no,

3592
01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:36.970
no,

3593
01:35:36.970 --> 01:35:37.140
no,

3594
01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:37.600
no.

3595
01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:38.433
Those are fine.

3596
01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:39.333
Yeah.

3597
01:35:39.410 --> 01:35:40.021
I don't do that.

3598
01:35:40.021 --> 01:35:40.320
Listen,

3599
01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:41.220
you're going to get me in trouble here.

3600
01:35:41.550 --> 01:35:44.220
I have to go to a fucking tree huggers right now.

3601
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:45.361
All right man.

3602
01:35:45.361 --> 01:35:47.460
We'll save some pit bulls and time.

3603
01:35:47.461 --> 01:35:48.600
You want to come back and do it again when,

3604
01:35:48.601 --> 01:35:49.780
when can people see you do stand up?

3605
01:35:49.781 --> 01:35:54.090
When I used to be at the Improv in San Jose this weekend,

3606
01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:54.953
this weekend,

3607
01:35:55.410 --> 01:35:57.150
Thursday,

3608
01:35:57.150 --> 01:35:57.150
Friday,

3609
01:35:57.150 --> 01:35:57.151
Saturday,

3610
01:35:57.151 --> 01:35:59.130
my whole new hours coming together.

3611
01:35:59.630 --> 01:35:59.961
And,

3612
01:35:59.961 --> 01:36:00.370
uh,

3613
01:36:00.370 --> 01:36:00.700
and,

3614
01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:01.051
and,

3615
01:36:01.051 --> 01:36:01.370
and,

3616
01:36:01.370 --> 01:36:02.160
and that is it.

3617
01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:03.840
<v 2>The San Jose Improv is fucking awesome.</v>

3618
01:36:03.841 --> 01:36:05.370
That's what I love the old theater.

3619
01:36:05.371 --> 01:36:07.170
That's a cool old historic place,

3620
01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:08.273
you know?

3621
01:36:08.370 --> 01:36:08.731
So,

3622
01:36:08.731 --> 01:36:08.940
uh,

3623
01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:09.181

Yeah.

3632

Was responsible for you.

3633
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:23.010
Thank you for your digital revolution.

3634
