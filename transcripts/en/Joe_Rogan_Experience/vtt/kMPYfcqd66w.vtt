00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.820
Powerful freaks of the world teach you that low energy,

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.310
not unlike Brian's normal.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.470
Do you know why folks?

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.430
Because he's got the super aids seepa deluxe.

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.260
So Brian has to go to the doctor today.

6
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.120
I'm forcing them to go to the doctor.

7
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:18.954
Police,

8
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.543
oops,

9
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.811
<v 1>do shit though.</v>

10
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:22.561
Every time I go there,

11
00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:23.394
they say,

12
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.271
well,

13
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:25.490
they look at all your,

14
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.200
your aides in all your aides cancels each other out.

15
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.813
It's like

16
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.770
battling Brian Redman.

17
00:00:32.771 --> 00:00:35.250
All your diseases are duking it out in your system.

18
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.270
You just,

19
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.631
I don't know,

20
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:36.871
man.

21
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:37.020
I,

22
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.541
you can't,

23
00:00:37.541 --> 00:00:37.710
uh,

24
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.710
you can't be sick for four or five days in a row without at least getting looked

25
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:42.420
at because you might have something,

26
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:42.780
they can go,

27
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.280
oh,

28
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.470
oh,

29
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.281
you have this.

30
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:45.114
Here's that.

31
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.810
You know,

32
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.090
it's the non eating thing that's really starting to get me.

33
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:48.271
Yeah,

34
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:48.871
that's not good,

35
00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:49.270
dude.

36
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.310
You could have a parasite.

37
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.301
You could have something,

38
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:51.481
you know,

39
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:52.710
you might've eaten something.

40
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.790
It's very possible.

41
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.420
It doesn't catch you smell a certain strain of marijuana that makes you hungry

42
00:00:57.421 --> 00:00:58.380
and less nauseous.

43
00:00:58.381 --> 00:01:01.370
And I tried to smoke weed last night and just made me

44
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.243
<v 0>puke.</v>

45
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.893
Wow.

46
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.650
Uh,

47
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.091
well,

48
00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:05.640
uh,

49
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.330
that's not good.

50
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.540
<v 1>That's not a good ad for that and that sucks.</v>

51
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.930
And then has nothing to do with squarespace.com which is our fucking sponsor,

52
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.760
squarespace.com if anybody's ever used it

53
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.230
<v 0>to make a a website where you can look through your Webcam and take a look at</v>

54
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:24.360
Brian and find out what's wrong with them instantly

55
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.370
<v 1>that's coming,</v>

56
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.203
right?

57
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.250
That kind of technology that's going to be available.

58
00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:29.390
They're going to be able to look at you and go,

59
00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:29.811
Oh dog,

60
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:30.630
we see what's up.

61
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.640
I'm going to take a photo of you like real close up of your retina or some shit

62
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.910
and then in the future those people look in there and go up.

63
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.200
Doug's got an issue with is

64
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.883
<v 0>bladder.</v>

65
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.640
<v 1>I was looking for a body part.</v>

66
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.990
It wasn't too dangerous.

67
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.771
The eyes,

68
00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:49.080
this is the key key to the bladder.

69
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.881
Why not?

70
00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:51.210
They can move to the bladder?

71
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.491
<v 0>She goes,</v>

72
00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:55.880
I know that they can make bladders now they've found a way to make bladders like

73
00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:56.714
in a test tube

74
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.510
<v 1>connect.</v>

75
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.160
If you have problems with your liver,

76
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.240
is that replaceable?

77
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.101
<v 0>They can.</v>

78
00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:02.960
They can certainly transplant livers,

79
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.890
they even,

80
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.700
um,

81
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.150
but you can also transplant a piece of your liver livers,

82
00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:09.160
a weird livers like,

83
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.560
uh,

84
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.400
they regenerate.

85
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.200
So if like a liver breaks open,

86
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.810
I'll give you get an up dangerous a car accident or something like that.

87
00:02:14.811 --> 00:02:16.640
Sometimes you can have like serious liver damage,

88
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.770
but even if you lose a piece of your liver,

89
00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.090
your liver can regenerate.

90
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.190
So the idea is you can transplant like a part of someone's liver,

91
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:29.240
you can help them by giving them a piece of your liver and then that can sort

92
00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:29.510
of,

93
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.930
uh,

94
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:30.450
you know,

95
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.950
jumpstart their little system and then their liver,

96
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.590
I guess,

97
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.270
I don't know if it grows or what.

98
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.460
I need to find that out before I start talking about it.

99
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.900
I don't know if it grows,

100
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.011
but I know that a,

101
00:02:40.011 --> 00:02:41.660
you can donate a piece of your liver.

102
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.410
<v 1>You should make a website on Squarespace.</v>

103
00:02:44.411 --> 00:02:48.130
That tea for people that went and donate livers Oregons or the whole idea of

104
00:02:48.131 --> 00:02:49.780
donating organs is wow.

105
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.830
Which is we're fucking swapping the tax deductible when you donate an Oregon

106
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.130
anyway,

107
00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.791
go make a website.

108
00:02:57.791 --> 00:02:58.624
Fuck

109
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.270
squarespace.com it's a great slogan for them.

110
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.730
Cool.

111
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.531
Make a website.

112
00:03:03.531 --> 00:03:05.090
Fucks me.

113
00:03:05.091 --> 00:03:07.520
And Doug actually hung out with these Squarespace people all weekend.

114
00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:07.671
Yeah,

115
00:03:07.671 --> 00:03:08.930
we red square spacers.

116
00:03:08.931 --> 00:03:09.300
Yeah.

117
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.640
My a food podcast.

118
00:03:10.641 --> 00:03:12.140
They gave out free,

119
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.003
uh,

120
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.401
uh,

121
00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:13.941
what do you call it?

122
00:03:13.941 --> 00:03:16.640
A bloody Mary's to everybody because it was a breakfast edition.

123
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.761
Oh,

124
00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:18.110
that's bad on Squarespace.

125
00:03:18.111 --> 00:03:19.370
But bloody Mary's for everybody.

126
00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:21.110
But then later that night at the bar,

127
00:03:21.111 --> 00:03:22.250
there's a girl from Squarespace.

128
00:03:22.251 --> 00:03:24.020
It was just like anyone standing at this bar.

129
00:03:24.021 --> 00:03:25.040
We're buying drinks,

130
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.513
shifts,

131
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.950
spaces gangster.

132
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:28.813
Yeah.

133
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:29.870
That's hilarious.

134
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.041
Yeah,

135
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:30.874
it was great.

136
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.390
I wouldn't do that though.

137
00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:32.520
What,

138
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.860
what if,

139
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.080
you know,

140
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.040
if you're buying people drinks,

141
00:03:34.041 --> 00:03:36.560
they tend to get fucked up and then they tend to do stupid shit when they're

142
00:03:36.561 --> 00:03:36.981
fucked up.

143
00:03:36.981 --> 00:03:38.080
But then you get in trouble for it.

144
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:38.391
It was,

145
00:03:38.391 --> 00:03:38.751
you know,

146
00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:42.170
very last call adjacent when this went down in a hotel bar.

147
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.471
You know,

148
00:03:42.471 --> 00:03:44.390
hotel bars like to close at weird times,

149
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.400
like two hours before they could be,

150
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.170
they could have been made made $200,

151
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.920
you know,

152
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.410
$200 more than 200 you know,

153
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.290
two hours worth of selling booze to a bunch of nerds at a podcast festival.

154
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.101
And they're like,

155
00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:55.311
no,

156
00:03:55.311 --> 00:03:56.300
we got to shut it down.

157
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.400
So it was last call.

158
00:03:58.401 --> 00:04:00.260
So like she only had to buy like two rounds.

159
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.990
Oh,

160
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.390
well we didn't go crazy on it,

161
00:04:02.391 --> 00:04:03.230
but it was still,

162
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.150
thank you Squarespace.

163
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.020
Very generous.

164
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.191
Yeah.

165
00:04:06.191 --> 00:04:08.720
And it's a cool company that's does things like that.

166
00:04:08.721 --> 00:04:09.930
It's also a gangster move.

167
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:10.790
They're buying drugs.

168
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:12.081
I mean,

169
00:04:12.081 --> 00:04:12.531
that's what they did.

170
00:04:12.531 --> 00:04:13.490
Who wants to get fucked up?

171
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.423
That's what they did.

172
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.021
They just said,

173
00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:15.860
who wants to get fucked up?

174
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.480
No one's drinking and not get fucked up.

175
00:04:17.481 --> 00:04:18.314
I got news for you.

176
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.560
There's a lot of liars out there pretending.

177
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.751
Well,

178
00:04:20.751 --> 00:04:21.140
I just,

179
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.531
you know,

180
00:04:21.531 --> 00:04:22.430
I enjoy a drink.

181
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.930
You enjoy getting fucked up.

182
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.590
Okay.

183
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.390
I'm not saying you're getting all the way fucked up,

184
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.770
but if you have a drink,

185
00:04:27.771 --> 00:04:29.090
you're getting a little fucked up.

186
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.681
All right.

187
00:04:30.681 --> 00:04:32.000
You're starting to get fucked up.

188
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.280
Squarespace is getting people fucked up.

189
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.850
It was great being on that asked episode where they were one of your sponsors.

190
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.481
Hey,

191
00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:44.660
they're nice people if they choose to let us go because we're telling the truth.

192
00:04:44.661 --> 00:04:45.494
How dare you?

193
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.201
How dare he?

194
00:04:46.201 --> 00:04:47.690
How dare this place.

195
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.280
We wouldn't

196
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.850
<v 0>do that.</v>

197
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:49.300
Um,

198
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.560
what it,

199
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.320
what it is.

200
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.460
So we'll just get to this.

201
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:52.300
Um,

202
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.990
if you're,

203
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.040
if you're listening to us going,

204
00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:55.450
what the fuck is Squarespace?

205
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.110
Jesus Christ shouldn't say Jesus Christ like that.

206
00:04:59.111 --> 00:04:59.944
People get mad.

207
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.660
Santa Claus,

208
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.820
same guy.

209
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.301
Golly,

210
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:05.340
Santa Claus,

211
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.550
um,

212
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.840
square and they're funny.

213
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.310
They're the same to me folks.

214
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.423
Um,

215
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.900
Squarespace is a way to build an awesome website online with their website.

216
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.200
You can use their website to make websites super easy to do and you don't even

217
00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:23.650
have to enter in your credit card information when you're trying out their

218
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:24.221
service.

219
00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:25.020
And they have,

220
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.360
you know,

221
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.210
over 20 bad ass designs works on everything.

222
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.901
IPODS,

223
00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:29.740
androids,

224
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.750
fucking Linux.

225
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:32.890
If you're one of those Weirdos,

226
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.660
when those gangster hacker,

227
00:05:34.661 --> 00:05:36.220
hacker type characters,

228
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.150
I'm basic.

229
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.590
I only use unix based

230
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.691
Squarespace.

231
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:41.620
We'll work on that shit too.

232
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:42.190
Um,

233
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.360
and uh,

234
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.190
you can set up an online store.

235
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.150
Super easy to do.

236
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.800
Brian is probably built 20 websites since they've been our sponsor,

237
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:51.191
like,

238
00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:54.490
and he's built every single one of them during the time that it takes us to do

239
00:05:54.491 --> 00:05:55.150
this commercial.

240
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.050
It's really that easy.

241
00:05:56.051 --> 00:05:56.171
I mean,

242
00:05:56.171 --> 00:05:57.470
it's fucking ridiculous.

243
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.023
And like I said,

244
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.810
you can try it out before you actually enter in your credit card information.

245
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:05.870
You can make your own website and then you let you know this was pretty fucking

246
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:06.620
bad ass.

247
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.080
Boom.

248
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.390
You given me credit card information.

249
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.231
And then,

250
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:09.560
uh,

251
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.920
if you use the code Joe and the number 10,

252
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.280
you will get 10% off your first purchases on new accounts and including monthly

253
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:20.720
and annual plans.

254
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:25.160
So that's squarespace.com and use the offer code all in one word,

255
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:27.740
Joe and the number 10 very cool website,

256
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.740
very cool people and a,

257
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.060
we appreciate them supporting the podcast.

258
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.080
We're also brought to you by what's Today.

259
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.450
Do Masani Lumosity,

260
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.530
not luminosity.

261
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.143
How do you say it?

262
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.740
Luma illuminosity it's too much for Brian.

263
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.051
He's like,

264
00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:47.230
this is too complicated.

265
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.160
Lumosity.

266
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.690
Lou Masi t say that Lumosity you should,

267
00:06:53.691 --> 00:06:55.210
you had benefit from Lumosity?

268
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.730
I probably,

269
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.540
I'm not saying Lumosity makes you smarter because apparently no one can ever

270
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:01.280
prove that something makes you smarter.

271
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.791
I would,

272
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:03.320
I would imagine that your brain,

273
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:04.100
uh,

274
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.180
fires better.

275
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:07.520
Let's say that when you were,

276
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.760
you're exercising it on a regular basis and so Lumosity is set up to be sort of

277
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:16.160
like a gym for your brain.

278
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.630
It's really pretty bad ass.

279
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.793
Um,

280
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:19.460
I've,

281
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.830
I've heard about stuff like this for a long time.

282
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:26.540
Like Chris Mcguire actually set me hip to this kind of shit way back in the day.

283
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:29.270
He used to have a video game that he would play.

284
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.830
It's like some Nintendo game and it was a game that was just designed,

285
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:34.820
I don't know if it was Nintendo,

286
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.030
it was a game that was just designed to like give you like a little mental

287
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:39.050
problems to solve.

288
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.011
And he was like,

289
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:41.210
it's really good to do,

290
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.270
especially as you get older and you're not going to school anymore and you're

291
00:07:44.271 --> 00:07:46.910
not really reading that much and not really exercising your mind,

292
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.773
your mind.

293
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.310
Like you'd be amazed at how the mind gets used to certain tasks.

294
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.670
And if you give it like exercise,

295
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.960
you can actually like speed up the results of some of these things that you're

296
00:07:59.961 --> 00:08:00.111
a,

297
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:04.250
you're trying to improve your memory or your attention and they actually have

298
00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:05.900
these games that are set up.

299
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.100
They're very measurable.

300
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.710
It's really kind of interesting because,

301
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:10.544
um,

302
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.850
you can sort of design a program and a,

303
00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:16.880
there's a bunch of flexibility to it depending on what you're trying to do.

304
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:18.710
Like it can be very job specific.

305
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.450
Like if you have something,

306
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.111
you know,

307
00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:21.531
a,

308
00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:22.730
you at work,

309
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:23.600
we feel like you're,

310
00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:26.090
you're not as effective multitasking they have,

311
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.690
they have games and improve your ability to think in a multitasking way.

312
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.010
It's really weird shit.

313
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:32.600
It's kind of fucking cool.

314
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:33.740
Um,

315
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.010
I thought that someone should have come up with something like this a long time

316
00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:37.600
ago.

317
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.000
Um,

318
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.511
I thought,

319
00:08:38.511 --> 00:08:38.750
uh,

320
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:39.021
when I,

321
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:40.670
when I saw Chris Mcguire's video game,

322
00:08:40.671 --> 00:08:44.600
I just assumed that there were some websites like this out there.

323
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.590
But until Lumosity came along,

324
00:08:46.591 --> 00:08:47.421
I never heard of a,

325
00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:47.810
um,

326
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:48.740
a really popular one.

327
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.840
I think angry birds makes you smarter.

328
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:51.830
It tells it.

329
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.810
What about that candy game that everybody plays?

330
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.230
What's the candy game?

331
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.130
There's some new candy

332
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.490
<v 1>crush,</v>

333
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.270
candy crush.

334
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.260
Everybody plays that right?

335
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.800
I see people freaking out about that game and then you have to like keep,

336
00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:03.030
keep sending them money.

337
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.360
It keeps getting more and more complex.

338
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:07.810
Those games are genius fan.

339
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.460
They figured out a way to get people hooked on this game and then once people

340
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:14.520
get hooked because then you have to pay money to get to certain levels and then

341
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:14.791
what's,

342
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:15.241
what's the,

343
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:15.691
got you,

344
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:16.590
they got you.

345
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:17.693
You know,

346
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:18.511
but hey,

347
00:09:18.511 --> 00:09:18.781
you know,

348
00:09:18.781 --> 00:09:20.190
they're designing these fucking things.

349
00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.280
Not saying there's anything wrong with that.

350
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.540
If people are enjoying it then that's a lot.

351
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:25.530
If it's crack,

352
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.840
I mean it's good entertainment depending on how much money,

353
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.450
how much money do you think it could possibly cost to be completely addicted to

354
00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:31.284
an iPad game?

355
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.380
A lot better.

356
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:34.830
Could real up 100 bucks a month.

357
00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:36.750
Maybe that much,

358
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.480
but why should that be illegal?

359
00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:40.770
But gambling is legal.

360
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:41.723
Come on in folks.

361
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:42.600
Come on.

362
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.280
<v 2>Most things I,</v>

363
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.740
most apps I buy if I,

364
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.750
I haven't bought many,

365
00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:46.411
but when you buy him,

366
00:09:46.411 --> 00:09:49.380
they're like five bucks or something and that it's a onetime fee.

367
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.130
Right.

368
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.030
But I guess I'm not,

369
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:51.640
you know,

370
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.000
I'm not messing around with no angry

371
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:53.640
<v 1>birds.</v>

372
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:53.851
Yeah.

373
00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:55.770
There's some games though that will fuck you.

374
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:56.911
This of games.

375
00:09:56.911 --> 00:09:57.660
Do they keep,

376
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.000
they keep fucking pulling that money out.

377
00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:00.870
You just,

378
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.330
you get deeper and deeper into it and you go crazy.

379
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.823
I'm on this site,

380
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.450
it's called Hollywood poker where I played poker

381
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.170
<v 2>and the idea is you can go there and you could play with a pseudo celebrities</v>

382
00:10:11.171 --> 00:10:12.640
like me and uh,

383
00:10:12.641 --> 00:10:13.870
they charged the people that play,

384
00:10:13.871 --> 00:10:14.920
but for me it's free.

385
00:10:14.921 --> 00:10:16.510
So I just sit around and playing it a lot.

386
00:10:16.511 --> 00:10:16.990
Cause I,

387
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.370
I like playing poker and uh,

388
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.030
oh and people can play with you.

389
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.120
You play as Doug Benson?

390
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.391
Yeah.

391
00:10:22.391 --> 00:10:22.711
Yeah.

392
00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:23.980
That's what it was like a picture of me.

393
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.750
And then they just had a alive,

394
00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.810
alive tournament to raise money for a few different charities.

395
00:10:28.811 --> 00:10:29.644
And uh,

396
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.750
I got to play briefly with Bruce.

397
00:10:31.751 --> 00:10:32.710
Buffer was there

398
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.030
<v 1>and uh,</v>

399
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.390
I didn't drop your name cause I'm sure every guy that goes up to him goes to

400
00:10:37.391 --> 00:10:38.160
Rogan.

401
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:38.491
But,

402
00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:39.320
um,

403
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:39.650
he,

404
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:40.680
he seemed very nice,

405
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.120
very nice guy.

406
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.070
Came in a ninth overall in the tournament.

407
00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:44.904
I came in eighth.

408
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:45.211
Yeah,

409
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:46.440
he's a really good poker player.

410
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:47.850
Bruce loves poker.

411
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:48.421
He's a,

412
00:10:48.421 --> 00:10:50.970
I know he's played in the world series of poker and they gave him a microphone

413
00:10:50.971 --> 00:10:52.410
when it started and he did the whole,

414
00:10:52.411 --> 00:10:52.891
you know,

415
00:10:52.891 --> 00:10:53.724
thing.

416
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.110
He's self guys solid.

417
00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:55.650
He's a pro.

418
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:56.350
He's a real pro.

419
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.700
He's a,

420
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:57.780
he's such a character.

421
00:10:57.781 --> 00:10:58.614
I love that guy.

422
00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.550
He's a sweetheart though.

423
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.120
Cause we were just casually,

424
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:01.891
that is weird.

425
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:02.430
Right?

426
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.160
He's always in these impeccable suits.

427
00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:05.790
This big diamond rings and Shit.

428
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.050
He's a bad motherfucker.

429
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.490
He's a really cool guy too.

430
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:09.881
And uh,

431
00:11:09.881 --> 00:11:10.140
you know,

432
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.210
he's been with the UFC longer even than me.

433
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:13.680
He uh,

434
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.513
he was involved,

435
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.650
I'm pretty sure he did the um,

436
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.330
the broadcasting,

437
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.640
like the one that I went to,

438
00:11:20.641 --> 00:11:21.660
the first one I ever went to,

439
00:11:21.661 --> 00:11:23.460
which was like UFC 12,

440
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.350
I'm pretty sure he was the announcer.

441
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.170
I'm pretty sure if it wasn't him.

442
00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:31.890
He definitely did some in that era and then he's been pretty much,

443
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.863
he's the one a day.

444
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:34.530
What a crazy gig.

445
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.150
Tony's got a really funny joke about him.

446
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.400
That's family just wrote that reason.

447
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.271
It's really funny,

448
00:11:39.271 --> 00:11:40.740
but I don't want to give it up.

449
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.280
I'll just say Tony has an awesome John.

450
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:42.841
I hate what?

451
00:11:42.841 --> 00:11:45.210
Hate that I heard about this joke.

452
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.310
Go to a comedy club.

453
00:11:47.311 --> 00:11:48.720
Someone already knows what the joke is.

454
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:49.710
That's so gross.

455
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:51.040
Um,

456
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:51.561
they asked,

457
00:11:51.561 --> 00:11:52.530
they yell out for it.

458
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:53.680
Those sons of bitches.

459
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:54.971
<v 0>Well,</v>

460
00:11:54.971 --> 00:11:55.804
that's not that bad.

461
00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.150
It's not as bad.

462
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.810
Certainly as as,

463
00:11:58.811 --> 00:11:59.110
uh,

464
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.070
heard yelling out,

465
00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:03.680
heard it on the book.

466
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:06.710
Anyway,

467
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:07.543
um,

468
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:08.441
like I said,

469
00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:09.460
a Lumosity,

470
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.300
um,

471
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:14.560
is sponsoring the podcast and it's a very interesting website.

472
00:12:14.561 --> 00:12:15.910
And then I started using it.

473
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.691
I like it.

474
00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:17.410
It's fun.

475
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.370
It's a bunch of games,

476
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.940
a bunch of interesting games and I don't feel as much like I'm just an idiot

477
00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:23.530
sitting in front of the computer playing games.

478
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:29.040
I feel like I'm actually making my mind more flexible by harnessing the brain's

479
00:12:30.221 --> 00:12:33.460
natural ability to adapt to new stimuli.

480
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:34.900
I think it's based on,

481
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:35.620
uh,

482
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.270
I think they call it neuroplasticity.

483
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:38.441
You know what?

484
00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:39.340
I just handed the background.

485
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.470
I hear some non neural plasticity,

486
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.280
but I'm saying I hear him all the fuck.

487
00:12:43.281 --> 00:12:44.860
I was doing some shit to his dome.

488
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.540
Doug's smokes more than Joey Diaz.

489
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.770

497
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.470

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:25.480
and we're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com got a new flavor of a hemp

511
00:13:25.481 --> 00:13:26.440
force protein that's in.

512
00:13:26.441 --> 00:13:27.490
Now we have a,

513
00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:30.370
a vanilla asai protein powder.

514
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:32.200
It's a delicious,

515
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.000
it's so yummy.

516
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.230
Super good for you too.

517
00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:37.690
And now apparently they're going to allow,

518
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:38.020
uh,

519
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.890
the growing of hemp in California for industrial use.

520
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.173
Yes.

521
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.200
Yeah.

522
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:44.650
Yeah.

523
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:45.610
So if this,

524
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.000
if this actually goes through and the federal government doesn't come in and

525
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.540
arrest farmers for growing an awesome plant,

526
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:54.280
if that happens,

527
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:59.670
then we'll be able to invest in a farmers in California and a,

528
00:13:59.861 --> 00:14:01.000
and help the economy.

529
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.310
And I mean,

530
00:14:02.311 --> 00:14:03.310
it sounds like a horse shit.

531
00:14:03.311 --> 00:14:03.990
Like,

532
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.240
you know,

533
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.430
that sounds like promotion horse shit.

534
00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:11.730
But I would love if on it was enhancing the economy by allowing people to make a

535
00:14:13.931 --> 00:14:18.931
living in 2013 by selling a very beneficial plant.

536
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:19.751
If we could do that,

537
00:14:19.751 --> 00:14:21.340
I think that would be pretty fucking awesome.

538
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.170
It's not about getting high either.

539
00:14:23.171 --> 00:14:24.250
It doesn't even get you high.

540
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:25.450
It's about the,

541
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:25.810
the,

542
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:27.280
the protein you get from it,

543
00:14:27.281 --> 00:14:28.690
the amino acids you get from it,

544
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.700
the fact that you can use the fiber makes amazing cloth and amazing paper.

545
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.820
It's super fucking stupid that in 2013,

546
00:14:36.821 --> 00:14:37.810
that shit's still illegal.

547
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.840
So we're really hoping that this works out and goes through.

548
00:14:40.841 --> 00:14:42.430
We're not going to do anything illegal.

549
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.500
We get all of our hemp from Canada,

550
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.200
it's legal to grow and legal to sell in Canada.

551
00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:48.520
It's legal for us to buy it.

552
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.140
So we buy it from them.

553
00:14:50.141 --> 00:14:51.440
It's so crazy.

554
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.470
It's so dumb that it's a totally legal product,

555
00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:56.630
but it's illegal to grow in America.

556
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.320
It's a,

557
00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.480
that's a fucking disgrace.

558
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.370
It's a disgrace to farming.

559
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.550
It's a disgrace to the whole idea of agriculture.

560
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.840
It's a disgrace.

561
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:11.230
It is one of the most beneficial plants known to human beings and assholes have

562
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:12.590
made it illegal.

563
00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:14.150
It's racist.

564
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.350
Craziness.

565
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.790
I mean that's the initial,

566
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:17.391
yeah.

567
00:15:17.391 --> 00:15:19.940
The initial stories were all based on racism.

568
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:21.920
It's so stupid.

569
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:22.460
Uh,

570
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:26.440
but we're hoping either way we buy it from Canada and uh,

571
00:15:26.441 --> 00:15:26.671
we,

572
00:15:26.671 --> 00:15:29.090
we get the best shit we can possibly get.

573
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.200
That's the whole idea behind on it on it is like what we call a human

574
00:15:33.201 --> 00:15:34.490
optimization website.

575
00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:37.130
We're just trying to sell you cool shit that's really good for you.

576
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.840
Cool Shit that I use.

577
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.790
Cool Shit that Aubrey uses.

578
00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:41.180
Cool,

579
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:45.470
cool shit that MMA fighters use for strength and conditioning equipment like

580
00:15:45.471 --> 00:15:49.760
kettle bells and battle ropes and steel maces and steel clubs.

581
00:15:49.761 --> 00:15:51.950
And all these different things that uh,

582
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.510
that benefit functional strength.

583
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.420
And of course we also sell a primal bells,

584
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.390
which are these kettle bells that have uh,

585
00:15:58.820 --> 00:15:59.653
these uh,

586
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:04.430
awesome fucking sculptures of a chimpanzees,

587
00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:05.900
orangutans and gorillas.

588
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.641
And we have a,

589
00:16:06.641 --> 00:16:08.180
a smaller one coming out too.

590
00:16:08.181 --> 00:16:09.014
It's going to be a,

591
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.160
I think it's a different champ and 25 pounds or it might be a monkey.

592
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:14.540
I'm going to be a monkey.

593
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.890
No more battle ropes,

594
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.120
battle ropes were right there son.

595
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:18.410
Right in the middle of the day.

596
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:19.820
The snakes in your face,

597
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:21.561
I can get,

598
00:16:21.561 --> 00:16:21.860
get,

599
00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.110
go to the doctor signed there was in Santa Monica,

600
00:16:24.111 --> 00:16:24.681
there's like this,

601
00:16:24.681 --> 00:16:28.310
that park where everyone works out in and tons of people will have these battle

602
00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:29.144
ropes.

603
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.210
It's a great workout man.

604
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.330
Even saying how tiring it is.

605
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:32.571
Yeah.

606
00:16:32.571 --> 00:16:34.790
You can get a really good work on like you know,

607
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:35.171
you,

608
00:16:35.171 --> 00:16:36.980
you do like these 32nd bursts,

609
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:39.800
like 32nd sprints and then put it down for 30 seconds.

610
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:40.663
Oh my gosh.

611
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.980
There's so many different things you could do with it could jump up in the air

612
00:16:42.981 --> 00:16:43.491
and whip it.

613
00:16:43.491 --> 00:16:44.810
You throw them side to side,

614
00:16:44.811 --> 00:16:45.740
throw him up and down.

615
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.730
Super awesome conditioning stuff and it's really good for your arms.

616
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.100
Like one of the best things that condition your arms,

617
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.160
like if you're in into functional strength and movement because it's such an

618
00:16:55.161 --> 00:16:57.080
awkward thing to whip a rope around,

619
00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:57.501
you know,

620
00:16:57.501 --> 00:17:01.490
requires so many different muscles to get engaged,

621
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.830
but we believe in all that kind of shit.

622
00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:08.210
Different strengthen conditioning equipment that uses the entire body.

623
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:09.900
That's the concept behind it that,

624
00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:10.220
you know,

625
00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.700
isolation exercises are good to look sexy if you want to have some nice 10

626
00:17:13.701 --> 00:17:14.240
tanks,

627
00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:14.511
you know,

628
00:17:14.511 --> 00:17:18.000
do a lot of bench pressing and bench press isn't really isolation as my as well.

629
00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.340
There's a lot of things engaged like,

630
00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:20.300
but like curls,

631
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.700
like you see guys doing preacher curls to build their bicep up.

632
00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.970
That's such a stupid move that doesn't exist in nature.

633
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:28.780
Like when would you rather have your arms straighten out and you're,

634
00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.590
you're pulling your bicep up like that.

635
00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:31.424
That's so dumb.

636
00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:36.170
It says it's just some gyms and walk around in school.

637
00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:37.004
Some guys,

638
00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.830
they're only designed to look sexy.

639
00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.310
It's like you're designed to do this weird isolated move and it will do that,

640
00:17:43.311 --> 00:17:46.180
but then you're going to have this weird imbalanced body and the way you're

641
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.240
really supposed to lift weights.

642
00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.500
If you want your body to perform at its optimum,

643
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.280
your whole body should be using e be moving as an individual unit.

644
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.830
That's when you get real what they call functional strength.

645
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.290
That's where like strong man exercises come from,

646
00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.270
but when you see people doing dead lifts,

647
00:18:00.271 --> 00:18:01.620
you see people doing squats,

648
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:03.330
you see people doing cleans and presses.

649
00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:08.331
All that stuff is full body movement and those full body movements and engage

650
00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:09.450
everything.

651
00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:13.230
Those are the ones that really make you physically strong and and applicable

652
00:18:13.231 --> 00:18:14.160
ways like,

653
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.580
like in sports and,

654
00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:16.540
and you know if you,

655
00:18:16.541 --> 00:18:21.541
if you enjoy doing something you can benefit tremendously from a good strong

656
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.240
strength and conditioning program in your life.

657
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.800
Get into it slowly,

658
00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:26.400
try it out.

659
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.450
It's fucking great.

660
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.990
You can get your body into a really good physical state.

661
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.680
If you're a healthy person and you don't have any medical limitations,

662
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.830
you can get your body feeling much better than it is right now.

663
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.060
As Doug Benson fires up,

664
00:18:39.061 --> 00:18:39.894
again,

665
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.393
look on my trying to,

666
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.170
I'm not trying to pressure you into getting healthy Fox,

667
00:18:43.171 --> 00:18:43.990
but oh,

668
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:45.150
in nit use a code name,

669
00:18:45.151 --> 00:18:45.441
Rogan,

670
00:18:45.441 --> 00:18:49.770
and you will save 10% off any and all supplements including Alpha brain,

671
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:50.281
shroom,

672
00:18:50.281 --> 00:18:51.090
tech,

673
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:51.810
new mood,

674
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:52.650
all that good shit.

675
00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.713
All right folks,

676
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.610
Doug Benson is here.

677
00:18:55.611 --> 00:18:56.341
So you use the code name,

678
00:18:56.341 --> 00:19:00.210
Rogan save 10% you're not a health pusher for sure.

679
00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.220
I am.

680
00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.053
But I've been at,

681
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.210
I've been at meals with you.

682
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.600
Yeah.

683
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.310
And you don't even tell anybody what to eat.

684
00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:07.280
And you always Passover a,

685
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:11.120
another big plate of something that's awful for people like you love.

686
00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:12.600
You still love food.

687
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:13.463
Oh yeah.

688
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:14.071
And uh,

689
00:19:14.071 --> 00:19:15.150
eating late at night.

690
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.320
Yeah.

691
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:16.651
That's,

692
00:19:16.651 --> 00:19:18.350
that's a bad thing at night.

693
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:19.643
It's a bad thing.

694
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.150
It's a bad thing if you're overweight.

695
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:21.821
Yeah,

696
00:19:21.821 --> 00:19:22.080
yeah,

697
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:22.470
yeah.

698
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:23.700
I mean it can definitely put weight on you,

699
00:19:23.701 --> 00:19:24.534
but I'm not overweight.

700
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:24.810
No,

701
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:26.910
I know you can get away with it,

702
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.751
but it's only,

703
00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:32.751
I only get away with it cause I know you're enabling fats like me that get to go

704
00:19:33.241 --> 00:19:35.370
with you and have these delicious meals.

705
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:38.640
Propose show food is probably one of the most pleasurable things ever,

706
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:39.180
isn't it?

707
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.013
Oh it's,

708
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:42.060
food is the most pleasurable thing,

709
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:45.090
but food for us to like after a big show.

710
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.640
Like it's like when after a big show that goes well,

711
00:19:47.641 --> 00:19:48.870
you have a great feeling.

712
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.400
It's a great feeling of relief.

713
00:19:50.401 --> 00:19:53.850
There's a great feeling of like you had a great exchange with these people.

714
00:19:53.851 --> 00:19:54.661
They had a good time.

715
00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:56.370
It feels like super positive all around.

716
00:19:56.371 --> 00:19:59.970
It's what makes you work hard to do standup and it really get good at it.

717
00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:04.080
And then you're not going to just go sit by herself or go to sleep or something.

718
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:04.370
Yeah.

719
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:05.300
You got to go out.

720
00:20:05.301 --> 00:20:06.390
And we definitely,

721
00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:09.900
the posts show meals are like the most fun meals.

722
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.441
You know,

723
00:20:10.441 --> 00:20:11.400
we're all relaxed.

724
00:20:11.401 --> 00:20:15.210
We did our show and then we can go to some groovy place like fucking Chinese

725
00:20:15.211 --> 00:20:18.270
restaurant that we went to me Segura and uh,

726
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.190
Brian Cowen in Toronto.

727
00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.500
God Damn,

728
00:20:21.501 --> 00:20:22.334
it was good.

729
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.970
Holy Shit.

730
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:24.871
You forget.

731
00:20:24.871 --> 00:20:27.660
Like if you're in like a real city like Toronto,

732
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:32.280
you can get some fucking serious like legit ethnic food.

733
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:32.990
You know,

734
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:36.630
where people don't even barely speak English and they're serving Chinese food in

735
00:20:36.631 --> 00:20:39.330
the ducks that are hanging in the window and shit.

736
00:20:39.331 --> 00:20:40.230
One of those joints.

737
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:41.910
It was fucking good.

738
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.870
Every five out of the road with you and you're like,

739
00:20:45.871 --> 00:20:48.190
I'm just going to take it easy and go home after

740
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:48.540
<v 1>the,</v>

741
00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:48.910
you know,

742
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:50.320
after whatever we just did.

743
00:20:50.321 --> 00:20:50.681
I'm a,

744
00:20:50.681 --> 00:20:51.251
I'm always,

745
00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:51.491
you know,

746
00:20:51.491 --> 00:20:52.500
it's sad cause it's,

747
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:54.510
cause every time we go out we always do.

748
00:20:54.511 --> 00:20:58.060
You always find some new amazing restaurant and every town everywhere and the

749
00:20:58.061 --> 00:20:58.361
people,

750
00:20:58.361 --> 00:20:59.920
they're always super nice to you.

751
00:20:59.921 --> 00:21:00.730
And it's a,

752
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:01.570
it's really,

753
00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:02.800
it's good fun.

754
00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:03.700
Yeah.

755
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.630
It's always good fun.

756
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:05.291
It's good fun.

757
00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:07.150
I love tip in the shit out of waiters.

758
00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:07.780
Hey,

759
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.560
um,

760
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.430
we don't need any music.

761
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.590
Doug Benson said we're going to experience,

762
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:11.921
yeah,

763
00:21:11.921 --> 00:21:12.940
they were like,

764
00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.180
we were going for like 40 minutes week.

765
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:17.620
Yeah.

766
00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:18.830
There's no need to like,

767
00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.470
there's no need to have like play music.

768
00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.510
We've already started worthy off and running.

769
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:23.460
It's on.

770
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:23.820
Yeah.

771
00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.180
And all the shit that's bad for you though.

772
00:21:25.181 --> 00:21:27.070
I think that a post show,

773
00:21:27.071 --> 00:21:27.280
uh,

774
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.410
meals on the short list is a pre shrugged drinks.

775
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:31.450
There's a lot of things.

776
00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:31.781
Yeah.

777
00:21:31.781 --> 00:21:35.590
Well also that's my problem is I can't have a big meal before a show cause it

778
00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:36.250
just,

779
00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:37.083
it makes me,

780
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.610
I literally do not want to perform,

781
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.010
you know,

782
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:40.280
which,

783
00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.100
which is such a horrible feeling because that's the,

784
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.080
my favorite thing to do is perform.

785
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:45.790
And so to feel like not getting,

786
00:21:45.791 --> 00:21:47.260
you don't feel like getting up there.

787
00:21:47.261 --> 00:21:47.920
That's,

788
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.551
that sucks.

789
00:21:48.551 --> 00:21:49.810
So it's a terrible feeling.

790
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:50.000
Yeah.

791
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:50.761
So you can't,

792
00:21:50.761 --> 00:21:50.900
uh,

793
00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:54.640
you can't really load up on a huge delicious meal before a show.

794
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:56.260
I stopped eating gluten.

795
00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:58.630
I stopped eating gluten several months ago.

796
00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.650
That's pretty interesting.

797
00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:00.850
That's a big thing for,

798
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:04.640
does it seem real all of a sudden that it's just everywhere.

799
00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.280
They're constantly talking about gluten.

800
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:06.521
Well,

801
00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:10.540
you know why it's because I think a lot of people have just sort of accepted a

802
00:22:10.541 --> 00:22:11.620
certain way of feeling.

803
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:12.380
They just,

804
00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:13.510
this is just how I feel.

805
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:14.231
This is my health,

806
00:22:14.231 --> 00:22:15.130
this is my health level.

807
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:17.920
And then you can do something like,

808
00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:19.930
especially if you are set celiac's disease,

809
00:22:19.931 --> 00:22:22.240
like a lot of people have like real allergies to wheat.

810
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.970
It's like it's a serious issue and we don't send everything.

811
00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:25.211
Yeah,

812
00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:26.290
I don't have an allergy to it,

813
00:22:26.291 --> 00:22:31.291
but I noticed when I stopped eating it like almost right away that my energy

814
00:22:33.161 --> 00:22:34.180
level was way more,

815
00:22:34.181 --> 00:22:35.650
even throughout the day,

816
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:40.480
like there wasn't this big crash after meals and I started thinking about that.

817
00:22:40.481 --> 00:22:42.220
It's crazy if that's really the case,

818
00:22:42.221 --> 00:22:44.980
that the crash of two meals is always bread or pasta.

819
00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:50.370
And then I stopped and thought about every time that I got like really like

820
00:22:50.771 --> 00:22:54.700
stuffed up on Lasagna or spaghetti or something like that.

821
00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.370
That is the worst after food coma.

822
00:22:57.371 --> 00:22:59.830
It's the most delicious shit while you're eating it.

823
00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:00.280
Yeah.

824
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.770
But you fucking pay hard.

825
00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:07.390
Like your body wants to crash because it's processing all that wheat.

826
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.390
It's all I just fucking gummy,

827
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:14.170
weird pasty shit sitting in the bottom of your stomach that doesn't exist in

828
00:23:14.171 --> 00:23:14.860
nature.

829
00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:18.040
Some weird creation that we've concocted and strength.

830
00:23:18.041 --> 00:23:21.010
It's funny you said gummy because the gum has weed in it.

831
00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.173
Yeah.

832
00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:22.960
Isn't that crazy?

833
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:23.793
Yeah.

834
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.120
All it took was one guy saying to me,

835
00:23:25.121 --> 00:23:25.841
you know all that gum,

836
00:23:25.841 --> 00:23:26.291
you're chewing.

837
00:23:26.291 --> 00:23:26.621
You're just,

838
00:23:26.621 --> 00:23:28.900
you're just triggering yourself to want more wheat.

839
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:32.880
And I stopped chewing gum altogether and gum have weed in it.

840
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.070
If you've looked at the Google this,

841
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.213
Google it up.

842
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:37.660
Supposedly a lot of it does.

843
00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:38.733
Wow.

844
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:39.593
There's gum have

845
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.080
bitch Siri can't eat gluten free gum.

846
00:23:44.081 --> 00:23:44.950
Which brand to choose.

847
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.291
Wow.

848
00:23:45.291 --> 00:23:46.220
Some gum has

849
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.660
<v 0>fucking gluten in it.</v>

850
00:23:47.661 --> 00:23:48.650
That is nuts.

851
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:49.700
What are the gluten free one?

852
00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:49.941
We,

853
00:23:49.941 --> 00:23:51.890
it says wheat is chewing gum.

854
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:53.270
This is incredible.

855
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:55.250
Oh my God.

856
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:55.970
Wow.

857
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:58.310
Back in the days before there was chewing gum and this store is,

858
00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.860
farmers actually made their own with grains of wheat.

859
00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:01.330
<v 3>Well,</v>

860
00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:04.540
that's why you see assholes out in the sticks chewing on the end of the thing of

861
00:24:04.541 --> 00:24:04.920
wheat.

862
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.350
Yeah.

863
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.183
It's like gum.

864
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:07.533
Wow,

865
00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:09.940
I want more of this week.

866
00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:10.980
<v 0>Wow.</v>

867
00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:11.581
Yeah.

868
00:24:11.581 --> 00:24:12.820
You put the the Er.

869
00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:13.411
Wow.

870
00:24:13.411 --> 00:24:15.000
You can chew it down to gum.

871
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.100
He put the grains of wheat and your mouth.

872
00:24:17.101 --> 00:24:18.300
You crunch down slowly.

873
00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.710
I started chewing.

874
00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.990
Your jaw and teeth will turn into a stone grinder and you will immediately

875
00:24:22.991 --> 00:24:23.280
begin,

876
00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.590
begin to taste the nutty flavor of the whole wheat.

877
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.101
If you continue to,

878
00:24:27.101 --> 00:24:30.620
and for a few minutes swallowing the SS saliva but not the grains.

879
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:34.200
There'll be a little mound of dough right inside your mouth.

880
00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:39.350
Keep chewing and it will get smoother and soon turn into old fashioned farmers.

881
00:24:39.391 --> 00:24:42.450
Gum farmers gum is pure wheat gluten.

882
00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:47.130
It has pleasing texture and will last and last and probably no flavor.

883
00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.370
Well that's why that shit shouldn't be in your fucking stomach.

884
00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.050
Like that's a perfect example.

885
00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:53.730
You're reading that and it it.

886
00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.700
<v 3>I stopped swallowing gum too.</v>

887
00:24:55.701 --> 00:24:57.140
I decided to stop doing that.

888
00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.233
Flushing.

889
00:24:59.400 --> 00:24:59.660
Oh,

890
00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:03.590
I'm eating too much gum in my forties I think it's about time it out.

891
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.610
Swallowing gum.

892
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:05.733
That's hilarious.

893
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.420
So off it because somebody told me like,

894
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.651
oh,

895
00:25:09.651 --> 00:25:12.330
it stays in your stomach for it 10 years or something and it's,

896
00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.510
and then I went online.

897
00:25:13.511 --> 00:25:13.761
I was like,

898
00:25:13.761 --> 00:25:13.881
oh,

899
00:25:13.881 --> 00:25:14.421
that's bullshit.

900
00:25:14.421 --> 00:25:15.254
You Shit it out.

901
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.270
But so I just started,

902
00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:20.120
it doesn't seem like the right thing to have down there.

903
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:21.530
That was one of those myths.

904
00:25:21.531 --> 00:25:26.060
So that went across the world that if you ain't got another system for 10 years

905
00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:28.480
or watermelon seeds,

906
00:25:28.481 --> 00:25:30.650
you grow watermelon inside your belly.

907
00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.310
Have you heard that?

908
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.710
That's called pregnancy and it's normal.

909
00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.051
<v 0>Well,</v>

910
00:25:34.051 --> 00:25:34.351
you know,

911
00:25:34.351 --> 00:25:36.420
Anthony Bordain told me that people get that,

912
00:25:36.421 --> 00:25:36.990
um,

913
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:39.540
that the same stomach disease that Brock Lesnar had,

914
00:25:39.541 --> 00:25:40.374
what is it called?

915
00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:41.763
Um,

916
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:42.631
where you,

917
00:25:42.631 --> 00:25:42.781
uh,

918
00:25:42.781 --> 00:25:43.680
you have lesions,

919
00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:47.850
diverticulitis that Anthony Bordain so you can get that from seeds.

920
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.650
Like a seed can get stuck inside your body.

921
00:25:49.651 --> 00:25:50.190
It's not,

922
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:54.750
it does not necessarily entirely from just eating meat the way like Brock Lesnar

923
00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:55.680
supposedly it was like,

924
00:25:55.681 --> 00:25:56.970
because he didn't eat enough fiber.

925
00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.550
He's such a fucking carnivores,

926
00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:03.000
just chewing down stakes all day and no vegetables or anything like that.

927
00:26:03.001 --> 00:26:04.770
So he had developed like a backup,

928
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.281
you know,

929
00:26:05.281 --> 00:26:06.750
like he got clogged up down there,

930
00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.370
but he said that anything could do it.

931
00:26:08.371 --> 00:26:08.521
Like,

932
00:26:08.521 --> 00:26:08.750
um,

933
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:09.060
you know,

934
00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.550
like seeds can get stuck in there.

935
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.031
<v 3>That's good.</v>

936
00:26:12.031 --> 00:26:15.870
I forced myself to eat vegetables with every time I have a stake just cause I

937
00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.020
somewhere got in my head that like it's just bad to just have a stake.

938
00:26:19.021 --> 00:26:19.680
Even though I,

939
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.530
I could just fuck up a steak and not even mess with the vegetables.

940
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:26.070
They always get a vegetable that goes good with it and then like put some in

941
00:26:26.071 --> 00:26:26.641
every bite,

942
00:26:26.641 --> 00:26:28.770
you know like I'll throw some spinach on my steak,

943
00:26:28.771 --> 00:26:29.470
you know.

944
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:34.470
<v 0>Well they say it's good digestive wise to to s like to open up the pipes.</v>

945
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:40.030
The idea is like you have a big salad and then the big salad sorta like pushes

946
00:26:40.031 --> 00:26:42.490
the door open for the lumps of stake shit.

947
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.333
But it could come.

948
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.380
It's like the fiber and the,

949
00:26:46.381 --> 00:26:46.710
the,

950
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:47.530
the,

951
00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:49.800
the watery texture of all that vegetables,

952
00:26:49.801 --> 00:26:51.930
all the water content of that food and makes it easy.

953
00:26:51.931 --> 00:26:52.561
The process,

954
00:26:52.561 --> 00:26:55.380
like if you just eat nothing but salads for a couple of days,

955
00:26:55.381 --> 00:26:56.880
your shit's will be magnificent.

956
00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.170
There'll be beautiful,

957
00:26:58.171 --> 00:27:00.200
they just slide out of you.

958
00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.070
So storing you just eat salads.

959
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:05.750
I don't think it's a good idea to do like long term.

960
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.350
I think that you know,

961
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:09.210
but I think you,

962
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.420
you would be surprised at how much protein is in vegetables.

963
00:27:12.421 --> 00:27:14.580
Like Broccoli apparently has a lot of protein in it.

964
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.460
Like they don't keen wise a lot of protein in it.

965
00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:18.031
You know,

966
00:27:18.031 --> 00:27:19.850
hemp has a tremendous amount of protein in it.

967
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:24.210
Hemp is very high in protein and has a essentially amino acids like say they

968
00:27:24.211 --> 00:27:26.370
know you can get a lot at eating plants,

969
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:31.680
but it's way easier to be like optimally healthy if you take in some animal

970
00:27:31.681 --> 00:27:34.020
protein even if it's only eggs.

971
00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:38.280
That's a weird thing with like vegans in such vegans and such.

972
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:39.114
When my Tom,

973
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.273
what's his name,

974
00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:44.220
the fucking huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer,

975
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:45.300
Mark Twain,

976
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.220
vegans inside,

977
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:48.630
they only eat eggs.

978
00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:49.151
It's just a thing.

979
00:27:49.151 --> 00:27:52.230
It's really weird cause I guess the idea is that you don't want to have

980
00:27:52.231 --> 00:27:53.610
domesticated animals period.

981
00:27:53.611 --> 00:27:55.560
But it doesn't hurt the animals.

982
00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.180
You know they have eggs every day.

983
00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:57.500
It's,

984
00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:58.130
it's really,

985
00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:58.530
it's,

986
00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:01.800
it's super healthy to eat if you don't have to eat the chickens.

987
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.180
The chickens can be free range.

988
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:04.260
They can have a nice little life.

989
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.011
I mean,

990
00:28:05.011 --> 00:28:07.500
chickens are not like super complicated animals.

991
00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.810
They don't really need to be like living in the wild.

992
00:28:09.811 --> 00:28:10.830
And if they lived in the wild,

993
00:28:10.831 --> 00:28:11.640
guess what?

994
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.690
They're not going to last.

995
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.190
Chickens can't even fly.

996
00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:14.551
You know,

997
00:28:14.551 --> 00:28:15.361
someone's going to get them,

998
00:28:15.361 --> 00:28:18.660
whether it's coyotes or they go to sleep at night and they just sit there,

999
00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:19.411
you know?

1000
00:28:19.411 --> 00:28:22.410
Do you know what happens when you just sit in there and a coyote comes around

1001
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.930
when the coyotes hunt,

1002
00:28:24.931 --> 00:28:25.740
they hunt at night.

1003
00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.140
You know,

1004
00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.650
I mean the chickens really wouldn't even be around men.

1005
00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.300
It's a silly idea.

1006
00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:31.483
Um,

1007
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.150
the idea is that,

1008
00:28:33.151 --> 00:28:33.361
you know,

1009
00:28:33.361 --> 00:28:36.170
you shouldn't have anything to do with domesticating animals.

1010
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:38.910
I think that must be what they're saying because it doesn't even have to do with

1011
00:28:38.911 --> 00:28:39.744
murder.

1012
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:42.780
Eggs are delicious and they come right out of the chicken and nobody's harmed.

1013
00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:44.470
Simple and make them every,

1014
00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:48.120
every vegetarian Vegan I know is totally on the egg tip.

1015
00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.160
They eat eggs.

1016
00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:49.710
Yeah.

1017
00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:49.801
Oh,

1018
00:28:49.801 --> 00:28:50.530
that's good.

1019
00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:51.750
That's everyone I know.

1020
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:52.591
We can't be a Vegan.

1021
00:28:52.591 --> 00:28:54.180
If you're eating eggs that's not vegan

1022
00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:56.490
eggs or,

1023
00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:56.701
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1024
00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:56.911
yeah,

1025
00:28:56.911 --> 00:28:57.210
yeah.

1026
00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.630
So there are vegetarians or they go or they say I'm,

1027
00:29:00.631 --> 00:29:00.920
I'm,

1028
00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.520
I'm not a strict Vegan,

1029
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:05.640
but I adopt a lot of the Vegan vegans.

1030
00:29:05.641 --> 00:29:06.930
I know like they also go,

1031
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:07.111
oh,

1032
00:29:07.111 --> 00:29:08.070
but I do fish.

1033
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:10.110
That's not a Vegan does it?

1034
00:29:10.111 --> 00:29:10.944
Silly bitches.

1035
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:15.210
That's an La Vega and that's Tony La being like convenient.

1036
00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:15.901
Well we'll,

1037
00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:18.750
Tony's very much vegan except for that.

1038
00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:19.120
Right.

1039
00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:19.380
You know,

1040
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.670
he eats animal to know what I'm saying.

1041
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:21.900
I'm saying like most vegans,

1042
00:29:21.901 --> 00:29:22.920
I know like Tony,

1043
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.740
they all have that one thing though where they're like,

1044
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:30.930
I'm not die hard to the point of everything cause I still eat fish or egg or

1045
00:29:30.931 --> 00:29:31.270
something.

1046
00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:32.730
So it's more of a health choice,

1047
00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:34.440
the ideology.

1048
00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:39.650
But Tony's hilarious because he fucking smoked cigarettes and smoke cigarettes

1049
00:29:39.751 --> 00:29:41.920
like a little chimney and a,

1050
00:29:41.921 --> 00:29:42.251
you know,

1051
00:29:42.251 --> 00:29:45.220
and he's like eating Vegan that's going to counteract.

1052
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:45.911
He drinks every night.

1053
00:29:45.911 --> 00:29:46.744
Every night I go,

1054
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:48.160
I go to the bar and I'm like,

1055
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:48.551
you know what,

1056
00:29:48.551 --> 00:29:49.540
I'm not going to drink tonight.

1057
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:50.740
And then I'm like,

1058
00:29:50.741 --> 00:29:50.981
Tony,

1059
00:29:50.981 --> 00:29:51.671
you're not drinking that night,

1060
00:29:51.671 --> 00:29:51.880
right?

1061
00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:52.360
We got,

1062
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:52.810
and he goes,

1063
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:53.081
Oh yeah,

1064
00:29:53.081 --> 00:29:53.830
I'm drinking.

1065
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:54.880
He's the one that was put goes,

1066
00:29:54.881 --> 00:29:55.061
well,

1067
00:29:55.061 --> 00:29:56.620
if he does and I'm going to do it,

1068
00:29:56.621 --> 00:29:56.870
you know,

1069
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:57.960
it was fun to do too.

1070
00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.390
<v 1>He's a funny dude that's called being a comedian.</v>

1071
00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:01.283
We're a mess.

1072
00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:01.870
We're,

1073
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:03.210
we're a fucking crazy people.

1074
00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:03.481
Yeah.

1075
00:30:03.481 --> 00:30:03.661
I mean,

1076
00:30:03.661 --> 00:30:04.960
that's why I'll you know,

1077
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.970
may never quit drinking is cause I'm in a nightclubs every night and I enjoy it.

1078
00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:09.301
Yeah.

1079
00:30:09.301 --> 00:30:10.134
It's kind of fun,

1080
00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.140
unfortunately,

1081
00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:13.591
you know,

1082
00:30:13.591 --> 00:30:18.370
like it's why take the fun out of what we're doing by like insisting on staying

1083
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:19.223
alive.

1084
00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:19.831
But no,

1085
00:30:19.831 --> 00:30:20.121
you don't.

1086
00:30:20.121 --> 00:30:21.420
Like most comedians,

1087
00:30:21.421 --> 00:30:22.201
it turns sober.

1088
00:30:22.201 --> 00:30:22.531
They,

1089
00:30:22.531 --> 00:30:22.950
uh,

1090
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:23.783
you know,

1091
00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:24.841
they,

1092
00:30:24.841 --> 00:30:25.470
uh,

1093
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:26.240
they lose a step.

1094
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:26.480
They,

1095
00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.240
they,

1096
00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.970
they lose interest in being in the clubs and you know,

1097
00:30:29.971 --> 00:30:30.890
and doing standup.

1098
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:31.321
And it's like,

1099
00:30:31.321 --> 00:30:33.210
I never want to lose interest in that,

1100
00:30:33.211 --> 00:30:33.630
you know,

1101
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:34.230
by the way,

1102
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:35.280
when I said they lose a step,

1103
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:36.330
it doesn't mean you have to,

1104
00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:37.150
and I'm not saying,

1105
00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:38.120
I'm not saying that they,

1106
00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:41.460
but I am saying that a lot of guys who,

1107
00:30:41.461 --> 00:30:41.850
uh,

1108
00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:44.490
who like that I've known that become sober,

1109
00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:46.530
they lose like a certain amount of zest.

1110
00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:48.810
They all of a sudden now they're like,

1111
00:30:48.811 --> 00:30:49.620
well,

1112
00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:50.910
this is just life now.

1113
00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.860
There's no altering the state of consciousness.

1114
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.910
I'm just going to stay mellow and flat and they have other things that fill the

1115
00:30:56.911 --> 00:30:57.720
void,

1116
00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.141
you know,

1117
00:30:58.141 --> 00:30:58.441
like,

1118
00:30:58.441 --> 00:30:59.610
like Chris Hardwick sober,

1119
00:30:59.611 --> 00:31:01.710
but he plays video games all day long.

1120
00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:03.280
Every day you have to fill the void.

1121
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:05.610
They got to have something fun.

1122
00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:06.001
Yeah.

1123
00:31:06.001 --> 00:31:08.930
It's going to be the reason to wake up every day.

1124
00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:09.780
Yeah.

1125
00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:10.221
To some,

1126
00:31:10.221 --> 00:31:11.280
some other addiction.

1127
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.151
But I,

1128
00:31:12.151 --> 00:31:14.760
I don't think there's anything wrong with being sober and don't get me wrong.

1129
00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:18.510
And I think that like Hicks did his best stuff after he was sober.

1130
00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:19.830
It's not interesting.

1131
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:22.740
You don't have to be a fucked up to make good comedy.

1132
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.280
I mean,

1133
00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.270
there's no doubt about it.

1134
00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:24.511
Oh,

1135
00:31:24.511 --> 00:31:24.991
that's true.

1136
00:31:24.991 --> 00:31:25.411
For sure.

1137
00:31:25.411 --> 00:31:25.591
But,

1138
00:31:25.591 --> 00:31:25.960
but,

1139
00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.700
but to,

1140
00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:27.031
you know,

1141
00:31:27.031 --> 00:31:28.620
to appreciate the experience,

1142
00:31:28.621 --> 00:31:29.970
like once he was sober,

1143
00:31:29.971 --> 00:31:30.810
I bet bill Hicks,

1144
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.060
like walk in the club do,

1145
00:31:33.061 --> 00:31:34.470
is set and walk out of the club.

1146
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.820
Like probably,

1147
00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:36.511
you know what I mean?

1148
00:31:36.511 --> 00:31:39.210
It's no fun to be in there if you can't participate.

1149
00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:39.721
Right,

1150
00:31:39.721 --> 00:31:40.021
right,

1151
00:31:40.021 --> 00:31:40.231
right.

1152
00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:40.790
You know,

1153
00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:42.720
if you can't hang out and joke around and laugh,

1154
00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.840
that's like one of the most fun things about being a comedian is hanging out

1155
00:31:45.841 --> 00:31:48.780
with comedians shooting the shit after shows.

1156
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:49.980
You know,

1157
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:50.940
we'll be going in the morning.

1158
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:52.500
It might be the best.

1159
00:31:52.501 --> 00:31:55.740
There is times man walking just all together.

1160
00:31:55.741 --> 00:31:57.720
Hilarious times after shows.

1161
00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:58.830
Yeah,

1162
00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:00.090
that's probably a good look.

1163
00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:01.170
Good reality show.

1164
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:02.490
Stand up post show.

1165
00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:04.531
It shows over,

1166
00:32:04.531 --> 00:32:09.410
get off stage and you know everybody has follow him around from rounds,

1167
00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.790
the eat and just talk shit after shows.

1168
00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:12.660
It's like contrived.

1169
00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:17.280
It's Omniac but in packs of comedians and not just David towl actually a great

1170
00:32:17.281 --> 00:32:18.110
fucking idea.

1171
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.940
It is a good idea.

1172
00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:19.890
That's a great idea.

1173
00:32:19.891 --> 00:32:20.724
Holy Shit.

1174
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:24.000
Comedians after shows eating for don't be stealing this internet.

1175
00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:24.863
God goddammit

1176
00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:25.591
<v 4>Doug,</v>

1177
00:32:25.591 --> 00:32:27.450
do you ever have any problems cause you,

1178
00:32:27.451 --> 00:32:28.770
you drink a lot.

1179
00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:31.020
Do you ever have any tummy troubles or any,

1180
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:34.890
any problems for me to call me trouble you do every time I see you you're

1181
00:32:34.891 --> 00:32:35.251
always,

1182
00:32:35.251 --> 00:32:38.730
you know with your vodka and drink way too much vodka.

1183
00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:39.350
But I,

1184
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:40.130
you know like when people

1185
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:40.881
<v 1>offer me shots,</v>

1186
00:32:40.881 --> 00:32:42.470
like I say no all the time now.

1187
00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:42.740
Yeah.

1188
00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:46.520
Cause that to me is just like once you've had a few shots then it's just like,

1189
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:51.860
then you just have a lot of shots and then I hate hangovers.

1190
00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.790
Like that's my thing is that it's like drink as much as I can to get my buzz

1191
00:32:55.791 --> 00:32:58.190
going and then not be hung over the next day.

1192
00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:59.480
And it's very,

1193
00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.480
it's a very small window there that you have to aim for.

1194
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:03.140
Right.

1195
00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.340
So I don't always get there,

1196
00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.880
but no Tommy troubles or anything call me.

1197
00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.320
Do you have to go potty?

1198
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:12.320
No,

1199
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.160
I don't really.

1200
00:33:13.161 --> 00:33:14.030
But I also,

1201
00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:18.260
like Joe was saying about how people just sort of like accept how they feel.

1202
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:22.220
I could probably feel a lot better if I stopped drinking,

1203
00:33:22.221 --> 00:33:22.580
you know,

1204
00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:26.270
four or five VOD cause every night for sure it will definitely help.

1205
00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:28.100
Yeah.

1206
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.240
But the food thing,

1207
00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:29.901
having fun,

1208
00:33:29.901 --> 00:33:30.201
you know,

1209
00:33:30.201 --> 00:33:30.890
and I'm not,

1210
00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:31.161
you know,

1211
00:33:31.161 --> 00:33:33.170
that's what the scales have to adjust.

1212
00:33:33.171 --> 00:33:34.030
Like you,

1213
00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.570
you with what you have right now.

1214
00:33:35.571 --> 00:33:38.240
It sounds like you might change some things in your life if that,

1215
00:33:38.241 --> 00:33:40.490
if how you're feeling now would continue if you didn't.

1216
00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:41.570
That's just standard.

1217
00:33:41.571 --> 00:33:42.404
Brian Talk.

1218
00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.001
Listen to me.

1219
00:33:44.001 --> 00:33:46.190
He's going to ride that boat right into the fucking rocks.

1220
00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:50.570
Last time I was sick it was because of drinking I think.

1221
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:54.620
And it was because I used to drink jack and diet cokes every night and then I

1222
00:33:54.621 --> 00:33:58.040
went switched it to ginger ale because that's better on your stomach,

1223
00:33:58.041 --> 00:34:01.770
but it's her Turkey one on one and it's,

1224
00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:02.990
it's worse.

1225
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:04.460
Turkey one at one's worse than Jack.

1226
00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:06.110
It's more alcohol.

1227
00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:06.741
Oh really?

1228
00:34:06.741 --> 00:34:07.610
That's what that went away.

1229
00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:10.250
So I couldn't,

1230
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:11.300
I couldn't tell you.

1231
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:12.530
That's hilarious.

1232
00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:13.190
Yeah.

1233
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.023
Yeah,

1234
00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:14.630
you can.

1235
00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.150
You definitely can't red line your system forever.

1236
00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:18.163
That's one thing,

1237
00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:18.371
right?

1238
00:34:18.371 --> 00:34:19.940
Like it's always good to balance it out.

1239
00:34:19.941 --> 00:34:22.580
Like it's one of the things I actually always admired about Andy Dick.

1240
00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:24.710
Andy Dick would go on as a mad benders,

1241
00:34:24.711 --> 00:34:27.110
but I'd never seen anybody takes more vitamins.

1242
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:31.700
That fucking kid would have trays of vitamins and we bring to work and take one

1243
00:34:31.701 --> 00:34:32.091
of these,

1244
00:34:32.091 --> 00:34:32.541
one of these,

1245
00:34:32.541 --> 00:34:33.280
one of these,

1246
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.510
he would just counteract,

1247
00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.430
I mean that's to make up for all the partying,

1248
00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:38.930
sort of analogous to his life.

1249
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:39.763
He's just,

1250
00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:40.221
you know,

1251
00:34:40.221 --> 00:34:43.400
he has moments of sobriety where it completely understands,

1252
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.821
you know,

1253
00:34:43.821 --> 00:34:44.990
that this is,

1254
00:34:44.991 --> 00:34:46.120
this is who he is and this,

1255
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:46.681
you know,

1256
00:34:46.681 --> 00:34:49.520
he's trying to be a nice guy and then he goes off the rails,

1257
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.791
you know,

1258
00:34:49.791 --> 00:34:50.624
craziness.

1259
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:51.680
And then he brings it back.

1260
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:53.720
It's like this huge smoothies.

1261
00:34:53.721 --> 00:34:56.340
He had two liter of smoothie.

1262
00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:57.950
Well he always did that.

1263
00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.500
He always ate like super healthy and they always like,

1264
00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:02.360
and then he would just go fucking crazy.

1265
00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.030
But that's just Andy.

1266
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:06.140
But again,

1267
00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:10.160
I don't think you'd make a person like Andy unless they're kind of off the rails

1268
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.880
like this.

1269
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.620
You don't get that guy.

1270
00:35:12.621 --> 00:35:13.520
You don't get that.

1271
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:14.300
You don't get that.

1272
00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.080
None.

1273
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:15.913
Like that's,

1274
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.023
you know,

1275
00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:19.010
you'll back me up on this Joe.

1276
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.440
There's probably no funny or actor than him.

1277
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.333
So hilarious.

1278
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:24.860
Like so good at like he did it.

1279
00:35:24.861 --> 00:35:25.760
A lot of news radio,

1280
00:35:25.761 --> 00:35:30.560
like a lot of quick turns and beets in one scene that he plays beautifully.

1281
00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:32.750
Like he's almost like a silent film comedian.

1282
00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:33.440
Uh,

1283
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.270
physicality wise like he can,

1284
00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:37.740
it doesn't seem like there isn't anything he could do in that,

1285
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:38.100
in that

1286
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:38.933
<v 5>area.</v>

1287
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.920
As a comic actor,

1288
00:35:40.921 --> 00:35:43.530
I think he's probably one of the funniest guys ever.

1289
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:44.341
He really,

1290
00:35:44.341 --> 00:35:46.020
there was whole show was full of them.

1291
00:35:46.021 --> 00:35:46.520
But yeah,

1292
00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.150
like as a comic actor on a Sitcom,

1293
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.260
he's fucking brilliant and that's why he got away with so much for as long as he

1294
00:35:52.261 --> 00:35:52.591
did.

1295
00:35:52.591 --> 00:35:55.950
Cause everybody loved him as a person and as a funny character.

1296
00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.440
We used to do scenes together and I couldn't get through the scene.

1297
00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:00.870
I couldn't like I had to stop because I was cracking up.

1298
00:36:00.871 --> 00:36:02.160
Like I'm not supposed to be doing anything.

1299
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:06.780
I'm supposed to be like stone faced and he's doing is mad at it and I'm fucking

1300
00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:07.831
lying.

1301
00:36:07.831 --> 00:36:09.000
I have to like walk away.

1302
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:13.650
We did one scene where like I couldn't stop laughing.

1303
00:36:13.651 --> 00:36:14.910
It was so good.

1304
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:17.140
We were all standing out and you know,

1305
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.330
everybody's giving me shit about it.

1306
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:18.520
I said,

1307
00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:19.650
I was so apologetic,

1308
00:36:19.651 --> 00:36:19.920
I was like,

1309
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.960
I don't mean to be fucking this up,

1310
00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:23.490
but he was killing me.

1311
00:36:23.491 --> 00:36:24.324
He was so,

1312
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:25.163
he was asking,

1313
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:28.050
he was talking about all these different things that he ate and ask if he was

1314
00:36:28.051 --> 00:36:28.884
going to die.

1315
00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:34.740
It was just one ridiculous thing after another in context,

1316
00:36:34.741 --> 00:36:37.230
like you'd have to see it like in context,

1317
00:36:37.231 --> 00:36:37.321
I'm,

1318
00:36:37.321 --> 00:36:37.471
no,

1319
00:36:37.471 --> 00:36:40.350
I'm not doing a good job of explaining why it was so funny.

1320
00:36:40.351 --> 00:36:42.990
But I was stone cold sober at the time too,

1321
00:36:42.991 --> 00:36:43.321
by the way.

1322
00:36:43.321 --> 00:36:44.280
I didn't even smoke pot.

1323
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.710
So when he's making me cry,

1324
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.500
I'm sober crying gland.

1325
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:52.860
Imagine if I used to smoke weed back then and I was hanging out with him.

1326
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.810
Well as soon as he said you couldn't stop laughing,

1327
00:36:54.811 --> 00:36:55.201
I was gonna say,

1328
00:36:55.201 --> 00:36:55.321
oh,

1329
00:36:55.321 --> 00:36:57.150
so how often were you high on that shit?

1330
00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:03.860
I don't think I got high wa maybe like maybe once or at the most,

1331
00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:05.630
twice through.

1332
00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:09.300
Not only think I did twice through the entire time we were filming that show and

1333
00:37:09.301 --> 00:37:09.721
if I did,

1334
00:37:09.721 --> 00:37:11.160
it was always drinking.

1335
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.001
Like,

1336
00:37:12.001 --> 00:37:14.610
I was drunk at a party and someone says,

1337
00:37:14.611 --> 00:37:14.761
Hey,

1338
00:37:14.761 --> 00:37:15.301
do you want to,

1339
00:37:15.301 --> 00:37:17.020
you want to try a hit of this joint?

1340
00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:17.251
I'm like,

1341
00:37:17.251 --> 00:37:17.530
Eh,

1342
00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:17.941
all right.

1343
00:37:17.941 --> 00:37:18.510
Come on.

1344
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:19.620
Hanging out with some comics.

1345
00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:20.551
Oh party,

1346
00:37:20.551 --> 00:37:20.971
we'll party.

1347
00:37:20.971 --> 00:37:23.850
Am I going to party behind the comedy store?

1348
00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:24.390
You know,

1349
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.960
that's,

1350
00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.793
it's like,

1351
00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:26.693
I think that,

1352
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:27.833
you know,

1353
00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:31.980
comedians are weird when it comes to consciousness.

1354
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:32.341
You know,

1355
00:37:32.341 --> 00:37:34.140
comedians are weird when it comes to our,

1356
00:37:34.141 --> 00:37:34.470
uh,

1357
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.930
our,

1358
00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:35.271
our,

1359
00:37:35.271 --> 00:37:40.140
our want to change our consciousness because so many of us like have like

1360
00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:45.180
radical consciousness altering things that we,

1361
00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:45.501
we,

1362
00:37:45.501 --> 00:37:46.334
we fight with.

1363
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:46.681
Like,

1364
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:48.300
so many comics are hooked on like,

1365
00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:50.460
either like some form of drug,

1366
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.270
either speed or there's a lot of comics get hooked on coke.

1367
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:58.470
It's classic stories of Boston where all these guys doing blow together.

1368
00:37:58.471 --> 00:37:58.890
Like,

1369
00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:01.410
I got to get going on it my whole career.

1370
00:38:01.411 --> 00:38:03.960
I've never seen another comedian do a line of coke.

1371
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.033
Whoa.

1372
00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.113
Isn't that crazy?

1373
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.080
Really?

1374
00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.220
That's just who I run with.

1375
00:38:08.221 --> 00:38:08.730
You know?

1376
00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:09.510
That's amazing.

1377
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.631
Well,

1378
00:38:09.631 --> 00:38:09.961
you know,

1379
00:38:09.961 --> 00:38:11.400
I appreciate that about you too,

1380
00:38:11.401 --> 00:38:11.880
that you're,

1381
00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:12.990
you're really like,

1382
00:38:12.991 --> 00:38:13.500
uh,

1383
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:13.901
you,

1384
00:38:13.901 --> 00:38:16.800
you've talked about coke like really poorly before.

1385
00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:18.150
You know that you'll say like,

1386
00:38:18.151 --> 00:38:20.010
why would you fuck with that stuff?

1387
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:20.461
Never even,

1388
00:38:20.461 --> 00:38:21.180
I've never tried it.

1389
00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:21.630
Yeah,

1390
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:22.463
I haven't either.

1391
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:22.660
Oh,

1392
00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:23.493
you guys are missing out.

1393
00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:25.940
Try and while we are,

1394
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:26.813
I bet we know.

1395
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:28.470
I would tell you that you should try once,

1396
00:38:28.471 --> 00:38:32.400
but I believe that about so many things that I'm not going to get around to

1397
00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:33.460
that.

1398
00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:34.020
Uh,

1399
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:34.741
but those,

1400
00:38:34.741 --> 00:38:35.140
most,

1401
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.130
those wouldn't lead

1402
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.870
<v 1>to cause if I did love it,</v>

1403
00:38:37.871 --> 00:38:40.270
I'm afraid I would want to do it again.

1404
00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:40.900
Yeah,

1405
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.111
sure.

1406
00:38:41.111 --> 00:38:41.791
Heroin feel,

1407
00:38:41.791 --> 00:38:42.010
you know,

1408
00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:43.780
shooting heroin probably feels great,

1409
00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.270
but you know why?

1410
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:47.980
Why take that risk?

1411
00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:49.330
You have an addictive personality.

1412
00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:50.021
No,

1413
00:38:50.021 --> 00:38:50.291
Joe,

1414
00:38:50.291 --> 00:38:51.070
I don't,

1415
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:51.431
I mean,

1416
00:38:51.431 --> 00:38:52.264
Brian,

1417
00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:53.860
as he hits the pipe,

1418
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:55.000
look,

1419
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:55.750
I don't,

1420
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:58.000
I don't think you should fuck with anything that gets,

1421
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:59.860
that really gets in your system like that.

1422
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.730
That's my feeling.

1423
00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:02.140
I don't trust my system enough.

1424
00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:03.190
I,

1425
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:04.060
I'm not a very,

1426
00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.270
I don't get addicted to substances,

1427
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.610
but I've had like serious video games,

1428
00:39:09.611 --> 00:39:12.760
addictions and the other addictions in my life for sure.

1429
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.760
So when I see something that's like physically addictive too,

1430
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:16.511
not just mentally,

1431
00:39:16.511 --> 00:39:17.344
not like gambling,

1432
00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.700
but like physically addictive,

1433
00:39:18.701 --> 00:39:20.670
it gets into your system and you need,

1434
00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:21.470
yeah,

1435
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:22.720
I see what it does.

1436
00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:25.390
And people seem to be having a certain amount of fun on coke,

1437
00:39:25.391 --> 00:39:29.350
but nobody's like from the second they do it to the second the feeling goes away

1438
00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:31.930
is just super happy about it the whole time.

1439
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:32.321
<v 4>No,</v>

1440
00:39:32.321 --> 00:39:32.621
it's a,

1441
00:39:32.621 --> 00:39:33.970
it's a horrible calm down.

1442
00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:34.121
See,

1443
00:39:34.121 --> 00:39:37.660
that's why I don't understand why anyone would be addicted to it because when

1444
00:39:37.661 --> 00:39:39.340
you're coming down for it from it,

1445
00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.500
and especially the next morning where you're like,

1446
00:39:41.501 --> 00:39:43.450
I spent this much money for that.

1447
00:39:43.451 --> 00:39:44.290
I feel like shit,

1448
00:39:44.291 --> 00:39:45.190
I got a bloody nose.

1449
00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:46.061
It's like,

1450
00:39:46.061 --> 00:39:46.340
it's,

1451
00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.141
it's to me,

1452
00:39:47.141 --> 00:39:48.880
I don't understand why you would ever do it again.

1453
00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:50.230
I've done it before,

1454
00:39:50.231 --> 00:39:51.520
here and there and not too much.

1455
00:39:51.521 --> 00:39:53.080
I used to do it more but,

1456
00:39:53.081 --> 00:39:53.870
but uh,

1457
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:55.790
<v 1>I know you recommend an evening that one time,</v>

1458
00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:00.350
<v 4>too many people are scared that they're going to be like,</v>

1459
00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:01.041
oh my God,

1460
00:40:01.041 --> 00:40:01.551
I'm addicted.

1461
00:40:01.551 --> 00:40:02.031
I love it.

1462
00:40:02.031 --> 00:40:02.320
You know?

1463
00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.140
And it's not like

1464
00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.400
<v 1>I'm not as much scared of that is,</v>

1465
00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:04.930
I just,

1466
00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:06.710
it does not appeal to me.

1467
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.980
Needles in me sniffing something up my nose,

1468
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:11.630
all that just does not like,

1469
00:40:11.631 --> 00:40:15.770
I don't feel like that's going to be in my zone of comfort.

1470
00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:16.160
Brian,

1471
00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.740
you've been sick for like five days now for four or five days.

1472
00:40:18.741 --> 00:40:19.140
Yeah.

1473
00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:19.520
Um,

1474
00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.353
do you,

1475
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:21.560
do you smoke while you're sick?

1476
00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:22.160
No,

1477
00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:22.700
not at all.

1478
00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:23.060
No.

1479
00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:23.271
Well,

1480
00:40:23.271 --> 00:40:24.081
that's a good thing.

1481
00:40:24.081 --> 00:40:25.460
Like maybe you can quit now,

1482
00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:27.470
like maybe doing this,

1483
00:40:27.471 --> 00:40:29.750
you could transition over to gum or some shit.

1484
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:30.711
I mean,

1485
00:40:30.711 --> 00:40:32.630
I guarantee you that's going to make a big difference.

1486
00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.030
Yes.

1487
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.863
E-Cigarettes,

1488
00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:36.170
I guarantee that's gonna make a big difference.

1489
00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.250
That if you could do that,

1490
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:38.031
that reminds me,

1491
00:40:38.031 --> 00:40:39.500
I brought a really tasty,

1492
00:40:39.501 --> 00:40:40.334
um,

1493
00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.400
we'd cigarette that I got somebody gave me yesterday,

1494
00:40:43.401 --> 00:40:45.320
but it's unbelievable how good it tastes.

1495
00:40:45.321 --> 00:40:47.090
I'm sure it doesn't get you very high,

1496
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.841
but yeah,

1497
00:40:47.841 --> 00:40:48.800
it's got like a,

1498
00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:51.470
it almost tastes like a,

1499
00:40:51.471 --> 00:40:52.400
you're uh,

1500
00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:52.880
you know,

1501
00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.700
eating a scented candle or something.

1502
00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:56.331
This is a trick.

1503
00:40:56.331 --> 00:40:57.590
He's had that up his ass all day.

1504
00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:59.480
Hold it out right before the show.

1505
00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:02.300
I'm going to get Joe and Brian to put that in their mouth.

1506
00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:03.651
Obviously you,

1507
00:41:03.651 --> 00:41:05.270
Doug is not smoking from it first.

1508
00:41:05.271 --> 00:41:08.050
So something is up and even if you weren't,

1509
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.950
okay,

1510
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:09.380
alright,

1511
00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:09.770
I'll,

1512
00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:10.820
I'll show you guys.

1513
00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.270
You do this side thing where you're just like,

1514
00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:15.163
ah,

1515
00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:18.650
so it's tasty.

1516
00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.010
It's super tasted.

1517
00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:22.130
Did you see that by Brian?

1518
00:41:22.131 --> 00:41:23.240
Can you try one hit of that?

1519
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:24.343
It's just vapor.

1520
00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:25.490
I might be sick.

1521
00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:26.421
Yeah,

1522
00:41:26.421 --> 00:41:26.930
he's sick.

1523
00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:27.470
You don't want to,

1524
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:28.550
you don't want to pass it back to me.

1525
00:41:28.551 --> 00:41:29.241
I called back.

1526
00:41:29.241 --> 00:41:30.500
My back is soaking wet.

1527
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:30.981
I don't,

1528
00:41:30.981 --> 00:41:32.750
I don't worry about that sort of thing enough.

1529
00:41:32.751 --> 00:41:34.020
I know is really con.

1530
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.430
You're always conscious of it like diseases.

1531
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:36.940
It will,

1532
00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:40.640
if you in a smoking circle and somebody lake looks like they're sick,

1533
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:41.391
you probably wouldn't,

1534
00:41:41.391 --> 00:41:42.260
you wouldn't hit that.

1535
00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.193
No.

1536
00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:44.413
Oh,

1537
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:46.160
you don't want to get that in your body.

1538
00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.680
Like that's like a strong virus,

1539
00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:50.750
a strong a bug.

1540
00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:53.060
It's quicker than a handshake,

1541
00:41:53.061 --> 00:41:54.140
probably quicker.

1542
00:41:54.141 --> 00:41:55.220
It's going to go right in.

1543
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:57.970
It's going to go right and shake this guy guys,

1544
00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:58.520
you know,

1545
00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.470
got to Google maps and figuring out where to,

1546
00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.161
where to know.

1547
00:42:01.161 --> 00:42:02.640
You don't get it from the [inaudible].

1548
00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:05.300
It's bringing your hands to your face after you've touched other people.

1549
00:42:05.301 --> 00:42:05.990
Exactly.

1550
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.800
Exactly.

1551
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.840
So if you want to avoid getting sick,

1552
00:42:08.841 --> 00:42:13.160
one of the big ones is making a concerted effort to not touch your face and wash

1553
00:42:13.161 --> 00:42:13.581
your hands.

1554
00:42:13.581 --> 00:42:13.751
Yeah,

1555
00:42:13.751 --> 00:42:14.630
I do that big one.

1556
00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:14.871
Yeah.

1557
00:42:14.871 --> 00:42:16.420
I really try it like especially,

1558
00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:16.611
you know,

1559
00:42:16.611 --> 00:42:17.421
I play a lot of poker,

1560
00:42:17.421 --> 00:42:19.070
so I'm playing poker with other people.

1561
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:22.250
You're touching all the cards all the time and then everybody at the table is

1562
00:42:22.251 --> 00:42:25.520
touching and nobody's gonna not play poker just because they have a cold,

1563
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:26.480
a cold or something.

1564
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:29.540
So like I've just trained myself to like,

1565
00:42:29.541 --> 00:42:32.060
I just sit there and play and I never touched my face.

1566
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.190
That's smart at all.

1567
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:33.831
That's smart.

1568
00:42:33.831 --> 00:42:36.890
And then wash my hands as often as possible during it.

1569
00:42:36.891 --> 00:42:37.400
You know,

1570
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.270
another good thing man,

1571
00:42:38.271 --> 00:42:39.290
is this kind of shit,

1572
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:40.460
probiotics.

1573
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:41.570
This is a Kombucha.

1574
00:42:41.571 --> 00:42:44.300
This is the real Kombucha that was super into that for a while.

1575
00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:45.000
I mean,

1576
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.240
I got to the part where I liked the taste of it,

1577
00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:47.840
you know,

1578
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.880
cause you know some people they just can't get past.

1579
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:50.750
I love it.

1580
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:51.081
Yeah.

1581
00:42:51.081 --> 00:42:53.810
But did he my favorite thing to drink the very first time you drank when you

1582
00:42:53.811 --> 00:42:54.280
loved it?

1583
00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.100
I love it.

1584
00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.470
Interests Delicious because people usually make that face.

1585
00:42:57.471 --> 00:42:59.130
They make the Eqi fake drinks.

1586
00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:00.740
I don't drink sweet drinks.

1587
00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:04.080
Like I don't drink soda or very rarely I'll have a diet coke cook.

1588
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:06.140
I'll treat myself if I'm out to dinner,

1589
00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:07.070
I'm like,

1590
00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:08.240
do I have a water or a diet coke?

1591
00:43:08.241 --> 00:43:09.620
I'm going to get crazy and have a diet coke.

1592
00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:10.581
But for the most part,

1593
00:43:10.581 --> 00:43:12.690
I don't drink sweet beverages unless they said juice.

1594
00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:14.120
More of those in the fridge.

1595
00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:14.750
Oh yeah,

1596
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.960
yeah.

1597
00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:15.350
Here.

1598
00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:16.100
I mean,

1599
00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:16.401
no,

1600
00:43:16.401 --> 00:43:16.581
no,

1601
00:43:16.581 --> 00:43:16.701
no,

1602
00:43:16.701 --> 00:43:16.851
no,

1603
00:43:16.851 --> 00:43:17.031
no.

1604
00:43:17.031 --> 00:43:17.600
I'm sorry.

1605
00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:18.021
That's all right.

1606
00:43:18.021 --> 00:43:18.854
Home.

1607
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:19.833
I brought it from my house.

1608
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.420
That's what I'm saying is I try one right now because what flavors that this is

1609
00:43:23.421 --> 00:43:24.830
a gingerade.

1610
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:25.901
I liked the,

1611
00:43:25.901 --> 00:43:26.600
the actually the,

1612
00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:28.730
I like the standard one basic.

1613
00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.433
Oh wait,

1614
00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:31.221
are you sure?

1615
00:43:31.221 --> 00:43:32.420
Thirsty for something delicious.

1616
00:43:32.421 --> 00:43:33.320
This is delicious.

1617
00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:34.220
Can I try one of those right?

1618
00:43:34.221 --> 00:43:34.490
Yeah.

1619
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:35.660
We have those when we try that.

1620
00:43:35.661 --> 00:43:38.600
Coco cafe is espresso and coconut minter,

1621
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:39.583
minter,

1622
00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.410
coconut water was going to say milk or water.

1623
00:43:42.411 --> 00:43:43.550
I was trying to figure out which one to go.

1624
00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:46.160
I went with the metal taste like chocolate milk.

1625
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:47.323
It tastes like Yoohoo.

1626
00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:47.840
Yeah.

1627
00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:48.051
Oh,

1628
00:43:48.051 --> 00:43:48.541
I love you though,

1629
00:43:48.541 --> 00:43:48.890
Baby.

1630
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:49.120
Right?

1631
00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:50.570
They're much healthier than you who?

1632
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:51.050
Oh yeah.

1633
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:52.850
It's espresso in coconut water.

1634
00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:53.991
It's all,

1635
00:43:53.991 --> 00:43:54.824
it is.

1636
00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:56.390
Pasteurized coconut water,

1637
00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:57.410
if you will.

1638
00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:59.630
The way to get like the sweetest,

1639
00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:01.580
most delicious coconut water,

1640
00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.020
you have to get companies that,

1641
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:04.670
that pull it out raw.

1642
00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:06.080
And when you get that,

1643
00:44:06.081 --> 00:44:06.861
my God,

1644
00:44:06.861 --> 00:44:07.694
is it good?

1645
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:10.100
Raw coconut water is fucking sensational,

1646
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:11.090
but you don't really,

1647
00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:12.620
it doesn't last that long.

1648
00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.010
So they pasteurize and homogenize it so that they could stay on the shelf

1649
00:44:16.011 --> 00:44:16.844
longer.

1650
00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:17.810
And what about this,

1651
00:44:17.811 --> 00:44:18.290
uh,

1652
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:19.340
this packaging way?

1653
00:44:19.341 --> 00:44:22.760
Is this a specific reason they put it in this instead of like a can or

1654
00:44:22.761 --> 00:44:23.000
something?

1655
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.970
Question and you shake it up or anything?

1656
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:26.900
Yeah,

1657
00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:27.733
shake it a little bit.

1658
00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:28.251
Cause it's,

1659
00:44:28.251 --> 00:44:28.461
you know,

1660
00:44:28.461 --> 00:44:29.480
it's got two things in it.

1661
00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:30.520
The coffee and the,

1662
00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:32.220
is it better for the environment,

1663
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:32.880
<v 5>those cardboard things?</v>

1664
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:33.713
I think so.

1665
00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:35.140
The plastic thing and that to me,

1666
00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:36.533
I don't know.

1667
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:39.630
It seems it doesn't seem reusable so you can have shelf life.

1668
00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:42.420
Do you throw things away in your refrigerator?

1669
00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:47.280
Like when it's expired or do you usually come little over or you can go over

1670
00:44:47.281 --> 00:44:50.370
with dairy and meat but you shouldn't go over much with meat.

1671
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:51.383
Should smell it.

1672
00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:52.500
If it smells gross to you,

1673
00:44:52.501 --> 00:44:53.640
that's because it is gross.

1674
00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:54.420
You know,

1675
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:54.871
you shouldn't put,

1676
00:44:54.871 --> 00:44:56.430
this is the greatest thing I've ever had.

1677
00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.391
Coco cafe.

1678
00:44:57.391 --> 00:44:58.224
It's delicious.

1679
00:44:58.290 --> 00:44:58.681
It's great.

1680
00:44:58.681 --> 00:44:59.430
Right?

1681
00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:00.540
It's super delicious.

1682
00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:01.860
You have them as a sponsor yet?

1683
00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:02.900
No,

1684
00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:03.120
no,

1685
00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:04.350
they just send us from free shit.

1686
00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:06.341
Those caps,

1687
00:45:06.341 --> 00:45:06.920
man,

1688
00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.250
did she,

1689
00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:07.520
he's,

1690
00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:12.330
there's this fucking island somewhere like 2000 miles away from civilization and

1691
00:45:12.331 --> 00:45:17.331
all these birds are dying on this island because they're picking up shiny caps

1692
00:45:17.791 --> 00:45:18.870
and plastic and shit.

1693
00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:23.190
They find floating the off the ocean and they bring it back to their babies and

1694
00:45:23.191 --> 00:45:24.390
they feed it to their babies.

1695
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:29.250
So you find these like skeletons and their stomachs are full of these bird.

1696
00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:30.310
Like,

1697
00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:31.051
I mean these,

1698
00:45:31.051 --> 00:45:31.260
uh,

1699
00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:34.260
pieces of plastic that it was in the birds belly,

1700
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.160
stretch them out.

1701
00:45:35.161 --> 00:45:36.000
It's disgusting.

1702
00:45:36.001 --> 00:45:39.820
Like bottle caps and all this shiny shit plastic thing.

1703
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:42.480
Remember the plastic rings you used to always have to tear them apart.

1704
00:45:42.481 --> 00:45:43.001
So that's,

1705
00:45:43.001 --> 00:45:43.410
you know,

1706
00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:44.250
if you cared about,

1707
00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:44.820
uh,

1708
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:45.121
you know,

1709
00:45:45.121 --> 00:45:46.260
anything out in the ocean,

1710
00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:47.450
but the,

1711
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:48.010
the,

1712
00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:49.840
you don't have those to do that with anymore,

1713
00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:53.190
but there's still plenty of crap that it's just going to get out there and get

1714
00:45:53.191 --> 00:45:53.640
eaten.

1715
00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:54.480
You know what I love?

1716
00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.210
I love when you talk about something online,

1717
00:45:57.211 --> 00:45:59.340
like especially do something like a podcast like this.

1718
00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:00.960
If you bring up a subject,

1719
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:01.980
especially subject,

1720
00:46:01.981 --> 00:46:03.450
it's like really serious.

1721
00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:05.250
There's always gonna be someone comes along goes,

1722
00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:06.600
it's not that big a deal.

1723
00:46:06.601 --> 00:46:07.510
It's actually yes,

1724
00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:08.020
you know,

1725
00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:09.300
no matter how fucked up it is,

1726
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:13.860
like there was a a thing on the Pacific garbage patch and we were calling an

1727
00:46:13.861 --> 00:46:15.750
island of garbage and they were like,

1728
00:46:15.751 --> 00:46:16.110
wow,

1729
00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:17.640
it's actually not in my husband.

1730
00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:18.601
Actually.

1731
00:46:18.601 --> 00:46:21.300
Just a bunch of stuff floating around together.

1732
00:46:21.301 --> 00:46:22.800
It's more like an archipelago.

1733
00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:23.581
I know.

1734
00:46:23.581 --> 00:46:24.310
It's not an Ironman,

1735
00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:25.143
silly goose.

1736
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.520
That's not what's important here.

1737
00:46:26.521 --> 00:46:28.890
What's important here is there's a fucking bunch of garbage,

1738
00:46:28.891 --> 00:46:29.940
Texas size,

1739
00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:31.200
Hunka garbage,

1740
00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:35.520
all swim together and little particles that are floating around it like it's

1741
00:46:35.521 --> 00:46:36.061
really,

1742
00:46:36.061 --> 00:46:36.511
really,

1743
00:46:36.511 --> 00:46:36.931
really,

1744
00:46:36.931 --> 00:46:37.351
really,

1745
00:46:37.351 --> 00:46:37.920
really,

1746
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:38.521
really,

1747
00:46:38.521 --> 00:46:39.001
really,

1748
00:46:39.001 --> 00:46:42.450
really fucking bad because we've only been putting that shit in the ocean for

1749
00:46:42.451 --> 00:46:43.320
200 years.

1750
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:45.720
So how long do we have left?

1751
00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:50.000
How much ocean do we have left until the ocean is all like the fucking the,

1752
00:46:50.001 --> 00:46:51.990
the river right next to the Harlem.

1753
00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:53.153
You know,

1754
00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:53.641
what does that,

1755
00:46:53.641 --> 00:46:54.474
the East River.

1756
00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:55.350
Which one is that?

1757
00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:56.390
I the Hudson.

1758
00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:57.243
The Hudson.

1759
00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.021
How does that mean?

1760
00:46:58.021 --> 00:46:58.531
The Hudson?

1761
00:46:58.531 --> 00:46:59.220
It's just,

1762
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:00.053
we just,

1763
00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.800
everyone knows the Hudson is polluted.

1764
00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:02.490
That's just it.

1765
00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:03.323
It's just polluted.

1766
00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:04.500
It's just we accept it,

1767
00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.251
we accept it.

1768
00:47:05.251 --> 00:47:06.510
It's right next to New York City.

1769
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:08.520
There's millions of people in New York City.

1770
00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:11.100
There's just no way to keep their to land planes in.

1771
00:47:11.101 --> 00:47:11.934
Basically.

1772
00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:16.350
It's crazy how we just accept that that's still part of the fucking ocean.

1773
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:17.980
It's a part of the fucking ecosystem.

1774
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.760
It's right there and we just go get out of there.

1775
00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:22.290
That fucking river is a mess.

1776
00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:27.380
We just totally accept the fact that we've completely ruined a giant river.

1777
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:30.010
Like that's how fucked up

1778
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:30.843
<v 3>be biller.</v>

1779
00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:31.511
We just say,

1780
00:47:31.511 --> 00:47:32.260
but we're here.

1781
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:32.651
We're here.

1782
00:47:32.651 --> 00:47:33.341
So that's fuck.

1783
00:47:33.341 --> 00:47:35.530
Now there's a giant river.

1784
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.860
How's that affecting huge day to day life,

1785
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:39.703
Joe?

1786
00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.770
Because out here in California,

1787
00:47:41.771 --> 00:47:42.700
and it was clean,

1788
00:47:42.701 --> 00:47:44.170
if you were in New York and it was clean,

1789
00:47:44.171 --> 00:47:46.090
it would be a masterpiece.

1790
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:47.770
That'd be beautiful.

1791
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:52.060
Clean River right next to New York City would be fucking incredible.

1792
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:57.230
If it was totally removed of diseased fucking bodies that they throw out there

1793
00:47:58.130 --> 00:48:02.070
and all the fucking oil spills and leaks and barges flood,

1794
00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:03.220
it would be amazing.

1795
00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:04.420
It'd be amazing.

1796
00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:06.730
It'd be fucking an incredible place.

1797
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.311
Like A,

1798
00:48:07.311 --> 00:48:08.170
a beautiful like,

1799
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:09.730
like the coast of Mexico,

1800
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:13.090
like could go down to like Cancun and the water's blue.

1801
00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:14.470
It's like so fantastic.

1802
00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:18.550
Imagine if that was like all the way up to they put drops in that water

1803
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:23.470
or if it was just at least that quality.

1804
00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:24.963
I just stopped.

1805
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:28.240
I stopped using eye drops because I finally,

1806
00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:29.021
I just finally said,

1807
00:48:29.021 --> 00:48:29.231
what,

1808
00:48:29.231 --> 00:48:32.740
who am I trying to hide it from that my eyes are red.

1809
00:48:32.741 --> 00:48:35.440
Like just fucking wear sunglasses,

1810
00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:38.620
Robin Thicke style.

1811
00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:41.050
They're probably disappointed when they see you clear-eyed.

1812
00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:41.981
That's what I mean.

1813
00:48:41.981 --> 00:48:42.191
Like,

1814
00:48:42.191 --> 00:48:43.024
you know,

1815
00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:44.180
it's,

1816
00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:44.891
it's so funny,

1817
00:48:44.891 --> 00:48:46.120
I can't do anything without people.

1818
00:48:46.121 --> 00:48:48.880
Like we were talking about you being whether you were high on news radio.

1819
00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:53.080
I did like this little couple line part on friends and every time it gets rerun

1820
00:48:53.081 --> 00:48:53.890
people write to me.

1821
00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:55.690
You were so high doing that.

1822
00:48:55.691 --> 00:48:56.111
And I was like,

1823
00:48:56.111 --> 00:48:56.321
no,

1824
00:48:56.321 --> 00:48:56.951
that was me.

1825
00:48:56.951 --> 00:48:58.240
But I wasn't so high.

1826
00:48:58.241 --> 00:48:58.990
I was at,

1827
00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:01.600
it was at a movie movie studio lot,

1828
00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:02.441
you know,

1829
00:49:02.441 --> 00:49:03.790
in a scene with Jennifer Aniston.

1830
00:49:03.791 --> 00:49:07.510
So it wasn't like I was running around the corner and hitting bowls every chance

1831
00:49:07.511 --> 00:49:08.560
I got at the taping,

1832
00:49:08.561 --> 00:49:09.394
you know,

1833
00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.830
but people just assume they're just like,

1834
00:49:11.831 --> 00:49:12.410
yeah,

1835
00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:12.880
you know,

1836
00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.230
you're so fucked up all the time.

1837
00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:14.891
Yeah.

1838
00:49:14.891 --> 00:49:15.880
Well that's your thing though,

1839
00:49:15.881 --> 00:49:16.390
right?

1840
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:18.010
I guess do for 20 shows,

1841
00:49:18.011 --> 00:49:18.251
man.

1842
00:49:18.251 --> 00:49:18.461
You do.

1843
00:49:18.461 --> 00:49:18.940
Should do.

1844
00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:19.870
If I do encourage you,

1845
00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:21.070
I'm not gonna lie about that.

1846
00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:21.671
And My,

1847
00:49:21.671 --> 00:49:23.320
if you heard about my new web series,

1848
00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:24.010
no,

1849
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:24.370
what is it?

1850
00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:25.870
It's called getting Doug with high.

1851
00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:26.411
Oh yeah,

1852
00:49:26.411 --> 00:49:28.180
I did hear about this and a yeah,

1853
00:49:28.181 --> 00:49:31.060
maybe your people might've spoken to because you know,

1854
00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:32.093
uh,

1855
00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:33.273
there's people,

1856
00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:34.120
it's,

1857
00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.760
I have all these shows that I booked myself

1858
00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:37.260
<v 2>and this is finally one where the,</v>

1859
00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:40.410
where the folks that are producing the show are going to book the,

1860
00:49:40.411 --> 00:49:41.190
uh,

1861
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.910
the,

1862
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:42.420
you know,

1863
00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:43.320
the guests.

1864
00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:45.390
And so I could still follow up and say,

1865
00:49:45.391 --> 00:49:45.571
Hey,

1866
00:49:45.571 --> 00:49:47.610
please do my show to friends of mine.

1867
00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:51.870
But basically I'm trying to take the booking out of my hands so it's one less

1868
00:49:51.871 --> 00:49:52.704
thing I have to do.

1869
00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:53.281
But,

1870
00:49:53.281 --> 00:49:55.470
so that's why you probably get a call from someone other than me.

1871
00:49:55.471 --> 00:49:57.390
Cause normally if I wanted you to do one of my podcasts,

1872
00:49:57.391 --> 00:49:58.140
I call you up and say,

1873
00:49:58.140 --> 00:49:58.310
dude,

1874
00:49:58.310 --> 00:49:59.131
Doug loves movies.

1875
00:49:59.131 --> 00:49:59.491
And you'd say,

1876
00:49:59.491 --> 00:50:00.380
I don't know that much about it.

1877
00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:01.140
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1878
00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:01.973
Thanks Joe.

1879
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:04.920
All the time you did it.

1880
00:50:04.921 --> 00:50:05.251
Yeah.

1881
00:50:05.251 --> 00:50:05.881
But you didn't do it.

1882
00:50:05.881 --> 00:50:06.691
Didn't love it though.

1883
00:50:06.691 --> 00:50:07.590
You didn't love doing it.

1884
00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:09.000
I really love talking to you.

1885
00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:09.893
I really love that.

1886
00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:10.600
Yeah.

1887
00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:11.460
So we do this.

1888
00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:11.941
Yeah.

1889
00:50:11.941 --> 00:50:12.400
And Swim,

1890
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.470
meet on your turf.

1891
00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:15.540
I would be happy to do your show,

1892
00:50:15.541 --> 00:50:16.021
but I just,

1893
00:50:16.021 --> 00:50:16.370
I don't,

1894
00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:17.580
can't contribute that much.

1895
00:50:17.581 --> 00:50:18.480
I don't know that much.

1896
00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:22.290
Well that's the thing about getting Doug with high is it's just we start at four

1897
00:50:22.291 --> 00:50:25.140
15 Pacific standard time at live streams.

1898
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.490
I mean it's basically what you do,

1899
00:50:26.491 --> 00:50:27.020
but uh,

1900
00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:27.980
it tighter and

1901
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.390
<v 1>treating it more like a TV show.</v>

1902
00:50:29.391 --> 00:50:30.950
Like it's kind of like a talk show set,

1903
00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:31.750
right?

1904
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:32.220
Know,

1905
00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:33.490
like we don't have the cans on it,

1906
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:34.370
but where we sit there,

1907
00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:39.440
me and the guest start smoking at four 20 x smoke all the way till five o'clock.

1908
00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:42.140
And then the last thing that happens is when we're really,

1909
00:50:42.141 --> 00:50:42.921
really high,

1910
00:50:42.921 --> 00:50:44.030
I forced them,

1911
00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:46.130
I forced my guest to watch a magic trick.

1912
00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:47.030
Whoa.

1913
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:50.450
Magician runs in and does the trick for them because nothing like watching a

1914
00:50:50.451 --> 00:50:51.800
stoner watch a magic trick.

1915
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:52.850
A really good magician.

1916
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:53.061
Yeah,

1917
00:50:53.061 --> 00:50:53.580
he's great.

1918
00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:53.920
He,

1919
00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:54.171
you know,

1920
00:50:54.171 --> 00:50:54.711
is this a kid?

1921
00:50:54.711 --> 00:50:55.700
I know that does magic,

1922
00:50:55.701 --> 00:50:57.080
but he's a really good at it.

1923
00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:59.190
I've never been a fan of magic.

1924
00:50:59.191 --> 00:51:00.024
I mean either,

1925
00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:02.030
but I don't like being tricked.

1926
00:51:02.031 --> 00:51:03.740
I think it's probably because I'm a control freak.

1927
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:04.420
Yeah.

1928
00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:05.630
That's why you hit that one show.

1929
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:06.441
Punked also.

1930
00:51:06.441 --> 00:51:07.310
You hated that show.

1931
00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.840
Well that show is dangerous.

1932
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:10.900
You cause you let,

1933
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:11.481
they let people,

1934
00:51:11.481 --> 00:51:13.190
like there was one where,

1935
00:51:13.191 --> 00:51:13.610
uh,

1936
00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:16.070
the guy from trap traumas blink one 85.

1937
00:51:16.071 --> 00:51:18.380
That guy like when are you seven was,

1938
00:51:18.381 --> 00:51:20.820
what did they do to one 82?

1939
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.710
Sorry,

1940
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:25.270
can you take the one o two to the 10 bad ass mother fucker.

1941
00:51:25.271 --> 00:51:26.600
A made amazing drummer.

1942
00:51:26.601 --> 00:51:27.650
I just forget the band's name.

1943
00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:28.610
Um,

1944
00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:32.600
but there was some guy who got in his face and he was like ready to go.

1945
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.991
Like,

1946
00:51:32.991 --> 00:51:34.490
he could have easily punched this guy.

1947
00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:35.010
He,

1948
00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:37.880
this guy was acting like a total douche bag for the show,

1949
00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:38.510
you know,

1950
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:39.730
trying to go to him intellectually,

1951
00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.400
right?

1952
00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:40.821
But I'm like,

1953
00:51:40.821 --> 00:51:41.061
God,

1954
00:51:41.061 --> 00:51:42.290
this is so close like this,

1955
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.860
this,

1956
00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:43.550
you know,

1957
00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:44.750
Travis is not a bitch.

1958
00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:44.961
You know,

1959
00:51:44.961 --> 00:51:46.820
you get in his face and start talking shit to him.

1960
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:48.500
He's ready to fucking kick your ass.

1961
00:51:48.501 --> 00:51:51.290
He's just a regular dude with tattoos up to his chin.

1962
00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:51.891
All right,

1963
00:51:51.891 --> 00:51:52.940
he'll fuck you up.

1964
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:53.271
You know,

1965
00:51:53.271 --> 00:51:53.990
he was ready.

1966
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.531
And so I was like,

1967
00:51:54.531 --> 00:51:55.850
this is a bad situation.

1968
00:51:55.851 --> 00:51:57.410
Like they let it get to this.

1969
00:51:57.650 --> 00:51:57.801
Well,

1970
00:51:57.801 --> 00:52:00.920
like he got up and he was going to kick that guy's ass and I'm gonna go outside

1971
00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:01.581
and then,

1972
00:52:01.581 --> 00:52:01.821
you know,

1973
00:52:01.821 --> 00:52:02.240
he's like,

1974
00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:02.361
ah,

1975
00:52:02.361 --> 00:52:02.870
you're pumped.

1976
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:03.081
Like,

1977
00:52:03.081 --> 00:52:03.441
okay,

1978
00:52:03.441 --> 00:52:04.071
you're lucky.

1979
00:52:04.071 --> 00:52:05.210
No one stabbed you.

1980
00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:06.350
I forgot who it was.

1981
00:52:06.351 --> 00:52:08.720
But Steve Razah Neesy a Radisson,

1982
00:52:08.721 --> 00:52:09.500
easy resin.

1983
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:11.060
Nazanin as easy as easy.

1984
00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:11.571
He,

1985
00:52:11.571 --> 00:52:12.404
um,

1986
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:13.550
uh,

1987
00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:16.190
s it didn't ever air it on punk because the,

1988
00:52:16.191 --> 00:52:16.371
uh,

1989
00:52:16.371 --> 00:52:17.630
the athlete was so,

1990
00:52:17.631 --> 00:52:18.170
uh,

1991
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:18.560
you know,

1992
00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.390
wanting to protect his reputation,

1993
00:52:20.391 --> 00:52:21.440
but I forget who it was now,

1994
00:52:21.441 --> 00:52:22.251
but he said,

1995
00:52:22.251 --> 00:52:22.460
uh,

1996
00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:22.721
like,

1997
00:52:22.721 --> 00:52:23.240
uh,

1998
00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:23.721
you know,

1999
00:52:23.721 --> 00:52:26.660
a professional athlete that he went at it pretty hard,

2000
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:28.130
like almost took a swing at him.

2001
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.761
Dude,

2002
00:52:28.761 --> 00:52:30.860
I would not do that to a professional athlete.

2003
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:32.050
God dammit.

2004
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:33.230
Shit.

2005
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:36.950
That's so stupid because you wake up unconscious and he's like,

2006
00:52:36.951 --> 00:52:37.191
dude,

2007
00:52:37.191 --> 00:52:37.611
I'm sorry.

2008
00:52:37.611 --> 00:52:40.670
I did not know you were filming a TV show and it just fucks you up.

2009
00:52:40.671 --> 00:52:41.870
That easily could happen.

2010
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:43.340
Did you ever see the time that,

2011
00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:44.270
uh,

2012
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:45.131
I think it was,

2013
00:52:45.131 --> 00:52:47.690
was it hulk Hogan drop Richard Belzer on his head?

2014
00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:47.890
Yeah.

2015
00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:51.380
He's choked him unconscious and then dropped him and then he hit his head.

2016
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:51.760
Yeah.

2017
00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.280
Yeah.

2018
00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.550
God Damn Dad is scary to watch.

2019
00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:56.040
Dude.

2020
00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:57.770
J O cogans a giant.

2021
00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.530
He's a fucking giant man.

2022
00:53:00.531 --> 00:53:01.670
I saw him a monster.

2023
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.951
I've,

2024
00:53:01.951 --> 00:53:02.061
I've,

2025
00:53:02.061 --> 00:53:02.810
I've met him,

2026
00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:03.291
obviously.

2027
00:53:03.291 --> 00:53:03.711
I did a,

2028
00:53:03.711 --> 00:53:04.400
um,

2029
00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:04.530
uh,

2030
00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:05.830
interviewed him for a,

2031
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:07.310
one of the a UFC shows.

2032
00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:09.530
It was when he was doing TNA wrestling on spike.

2033
00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:10.880
Holy Shit.

2034
00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:15.140
He see if you find that I stepped behind them during that fight and he just

2035
00:53:15.141 --> 00:53:17.360
combed his hair with this little brush the whole time.

2036
00:53:17.361 --> 00:53:19.850
That's during the didn't really fancy.

2037
00:53:19.851 --> 00:53:20.361
Hold that up.

2038
00:53:20.361 --> 00:53:21.194
Pull it up.

2039
00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:21.990
Oh,

2040
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:23.000
I interviewed the Hulk Hogan.

2041
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:24.590
He's a giant human being,

2042
00:53:24.591 --> 00:53:25.110
man.

2043
00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:25.943
If that guy,

2044
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.450
and this is back way back in the day,

2045
00:53:27.451 --> 00:53:31.260
he's had a gang of back surgeries and all sorts of other stuff go wrong with

2046
00:53:31.261 --> 00:53:32.490
them because of all the,

2047
00:53:32.491 --> 00:53:34.260
the hard days of wrestling,

2048
00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:34.831
you know,

2049
00:53:34.831 --> 00:53:37.500
I'm sure he's probably lost height because they had to,

2050
00:53:37.501 --> 00:53:38.250
uh,

2051
00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:38.431
look.

2052
00:53:38.431 --> 00:53:38.681
I said,

2053
00:53:38.681 --> 00:53:39.890
look how fucking big that dubious.

2054
00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:41.821
I mean,

2055
00:53:41.821 --> 00:53:42.360
I'm short,

2056
00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:43.021
but God damn,

2057
00:53:43.021 --> 00:53:44.220
that guy's big as fuck.

2058
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:45.141
He's giant.

2059
00:53:45.141 --> 00:53:45.350
Yeah.

2060
00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:45.680
<v 6>Thank you.</v>

2061
00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:46.161
My brother,

2062
00:53:46.161 --> 00:53:46.401
you know,

2063
00:53:46.401 --> 00:53:47.810
to be here with Joe Mania.

2064
00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:51.510
It doesn't get any better than this brother.

2065
00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:53.420
These guys are going to war out here.

2066
00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:54.470
It's unbelievable.

2067
00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:55.011
Now you've made,

2068
00:53:55.011 --> 00:53:57.560
it's an intimate fights before and you want to highlight in my life,

2069
00:53:57.590 --> 00:53:58.423
by the way,

2070
00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:05.080
now I understand that you have recently announced a partnership with TNA

2071
00:54:05.961 --> 00:54:06.690
wrestling and it's

2072
00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:09.240
<v 1>president Dixie Carter and you're going to be bad.</v>

2073
00:54:09.241 --> 00:54:10.160
I am at reading shit off.

2074
00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:13.320
I've never seen you with a card out there at the fights.

2075
00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:14.640
They make me do that.

2076
00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:15.840
You know there's give you something,

2077
00:54:15.841 --> 00:54:18.480
hey you got to interview mostly Goldberg does these kinds of things.

2078
00:54:18.481 --> 00:54:20.490
I don't know why I wound up doing this one.

2079
00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:24.120
Maybe if I figured out like he busted ass for you so badly.

2080
00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:25.103
They'll eventually,

2081
00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:26.090
it's,

2082
00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:27.810
I'm fine talking to those guys.

2083
00:54:27.811 --> 00:54:28.231
But you know,

2084
00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:31.380
talking to him in a form like that we have to promote something very specific.

2085
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.010
Yeah.

2086
00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:32.671
Hard to remember.

2087
00:54:32.671 --> 00:54:33.600
You got to have the cards.

2088
00:54:33.601 --> 00:54:36.440
I've got my cards on my new talk show because everybody that comes on,

2089
00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:36.721
you know,

2090
00:54:36.721 --> 00:54:36.961
they're,

2091
00:54:36.961 --> 00:54:41.170
they're agreeing just smoke weed on camera so at least I can do is give him a

2092
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.470
card.

2093
00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:42.660
Gives an accurate plugs.

2094
00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:44.011
Yeah,

2095
00:54:44.011 --> 00:54:45.700
the trouble like the,

2096
00:54:45.701 --> 00:54:48.420
the Ho Ho Ho Cogan thing looks like TNA wrestling.

2097
00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:49.980
I really don't pay attention to wrestling.

2098
00:54:49.981 --> 00:54:51.540
So if you want me to read something about wrestling,

2099
00:54:51.541 --> 00:54:54.420
you gotta tell him you'd probably look down just to catch TNA.

2100
00:54:54.421 --> 00:54:54.841
You're probably like,

2101
00:54:54.841 --> 00:54:56.910
it's some sort of wrestling with initials.

2102
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:58.770
But if it was like an MMA bout,

2103
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:00.030
I wouldn't need any notes at all.

2104
00:55:00.031 --> 00:55:01.050
You'd never seen him with notes.

2105
00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:03.240
If Hawk Koch came on,

2106
00:55:03.241 --> 00:55:05.610
he was talking about fighting Brock Lesnar in a real cage fight.

2107
00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:06.641
There would be no,

2108
00:55:06.641 --> 00:55:06.870
yeah,

2109
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:08.000
you can just go out there and do it.

2110
00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:09.060
It would be pretty simple.

2111
00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:10.920
That goes of giant dude though.

2112
00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:12.900
If he choked your head and let you go like that,

2113
00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:13.853
that's dangerous.

2114
00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:14.790
So like I,

2115
00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:16.230
I enjoyed that punk show,

2116
00:55:16.231 --> 00:55:16.771
but I was like,

2117
00:55:16.771 --> 00:55:17.430
yikes.

2118
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:18.260
This is this.

2119
00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:20.640
Don't even enjoy watching it because I'm just makes me like,

2120
00:55:20.641 --> 00:55:23.420
even though there's always the reveal of the PR person finding out that got

2121
00:55:23.421 --> 00:55:23.880
pumped to go,

2122
00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:24.713
ah,

2123
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:27.900
it's still like they reach a level of ugliness that like,

2124
00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:28.441
you know,

2125
00:55:28.441 --> 00:55:29.570
I would hate to reach well,

2126
00:55:29.571 --> 00:55:29.910
uh,

2127
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:30.743
being filmed,

2128
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:31.480
you know,

2129
00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:31.690
and,

2130
00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:32.880
and have a couple of times,

2131
00:55:32.881 --> 00:55:34.290
but too many violent people.

2132
00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:34.680
Yeah,

2133
00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:37.740
I know too many people that would fuck you up if you did something like that and

2134
00:55:37.741 --> 00:55:40.470
then wouldn't even think that there was anything wrong with fucking you up cause

2135
00:55:40.471 --> 00:55:42.210
thought you were probably going to fuck them up.

2136
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:43.051
Yeah.

2137
00:55:43.051 --> 00:55:43.800
Why?

2138
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:45.060
Why wait for that to happen?

2139
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.110
Why wait to get fucked up?

2140
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:47.303
Timberlake?

2141
00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:48.570
Yeah,

2142
00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:48.860
yeah,

2143
00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:49.693
yeah.

2144
00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:51.910
He's like sitting on the curb crying at one point.

2145
00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:53.961
We shouldn't show it.

2146
00:55:53.961 --> 00:55:54.061
He's,

2147
00:55:54.061 --> 00:55:54.930
we don't own them anyway,

2148
00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:55.441
but yeah,

2149
00:55:55.441 --> 00:55:56.790
and we're not talking nice about it.

2150
00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:58.530
Well then they got away with it.

2151
00:55:58.650 --> 00:55:58.951
But look,

2152
00:55:58.951 --> 00:56:02.490
I should talk because we got away with a ton of Shit on fear factor we should

2153
00:56:02.491 --> 00:56:06.510
have never done did what they did is nothing compared to what we did on fear

2154
00:56:06.511 --> 00:56:06.841
factor.

2155
00:56:06.841 --> 00:56:08.280
So I really should shut the fuck up.

2156
00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:12.800
Like we had people ride bulls that was that you didn't like show you didn't

2157
00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:13.230
like,

2158
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:13.530
you know,

2159
00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:16.100
show up at their place of work and it doesn't matter.

2160
00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:17.670
It doesn't matter.

2161
00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:19.590
It's just a TV show.

2162
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:20.560
Justin Timberlake.

2163
00:56:20.561 --> 00:56:22.740
It was stoned while being punked by Ashton Kutcher.

2164
00:56:22.741 --> 00:56:23.090
That's,

2165
00:56:23.090 --> 00:56:24.010
that was his excuse

2166
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:25.960
<v 3>for crying about losing all of this stuff.</v>

2167
00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:28.870
He said he gave up marijuana after that episode of punk.

2168
00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:29.680
Oh,

2169
00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:30.790
well then you know what?

2170
00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:32.140
That's bullshit.

2171
00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:33.580
That is Wiki.

2172
00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:34.150
He's the,

2173
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:35.370
he's the punk bleaching.

2174
00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:36.550
You could use.

2175
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:39.100
We could use a guy like Justin Timberlake on our side.

2176
00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:41.501
Trust me,

2177
00:56:41.501 --> 00:56:41.861
dude.

2178
00:56:41.861 --> 00:56:42.700
It ain't bad.

2179
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.970
You were freaked out because they were punking you man,

2180
00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:46.210
an act of aggression.

2181
00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:50.680
Plus you're super duper duper duper famous.

2182
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:51.820
I think he's still smokes.

2183
00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:53.320
I think that was just,

2184
00:56:53.321 --> 00:56:53.590
uh,

2185
00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:54.423
you know,

2186
00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:57.880
I mean snoop Dogg has had a press release saying he stopped smoking.

2187
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:58.960
That was a while ago.

2188
00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:00.820
But it's still like anybody who says that,

2189
00:57:00.821 --> 00:57:01.091
it's like,

2190
00:57:01.091 --> 00:57:01.750
well,

2191
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:02.583
for now,

2192
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:04.401
for us,

2193
00:57:04.401 --> 00:57:04.901
for,

2194
00:57:04.901 --> 00:57:05.681
for a reason,

2195
00:57:05.681 --> 00:57:06.910
they're requesting for a reason,

2196
00:57:06.911 --> 00:57:08.830
but they'll be back a post saying,

2197
00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:10.480
I ran into post saying it Disneyland.

2198
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:11.471
Oh yeah.

2199
00:57:11.471 --> 00:57:12.070
How was he?

2200
00:57:12.070 --> 00:57:12.910
He's back on the weed.

2201
00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:13.660
Well,

2202
00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:15.010
I saw him in a comedy festival.

2203
00:57:15.011 --> 00:57:16.930
So of course hanging out with the other comics,

2204
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:18.550
how do the road,

2205
00:57:18.551 --> 00:57:19.480
he's going to do something.

2206
00:57:19.481 --> 00:57:23.800
But I respect the fact that he realized that he needed to get his shit together,

2207
00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:24.401
you know?

2208
00:57:24.401 --> 00:57:25.840
And so that was like sort of his thing.

2209
00:57:25.841 --> 00:57:27.790
Like once you got to shit back in line,

2210
00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:31.480
he just felt like he was using it a little bit too much and it's like you know,

2211
00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:33.460
high around his kid all the time.

2212
00:57:33.461 --> 00:57:33.901
That's got it.

2213
00:57:33.901 --> 00:57:34.190
You got,

2214
00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:35.620
you want to be present for your children.

2215
00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:35.950
Yeah.

2216
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:39.730
And you also want to make sure that you know you're not out of control.

2217
00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:40.151
You know,

2218
00:57:40.151 --> 00:57:43.030
you don't want that feeling of whether whatever it is,

2219
00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:44.050
if it's fucking coffee,

2220
00:57:44.051 --> 00:57:46.750
if you're down in coffee all day every day and you just get up in the morning

2221
00:57:46.751 --> 00:57:49.030
and you just Zombie towards that coffee,

2222
00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:50.050
slow down,

2223
00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:55.500
stop taking it or judge anyone for for not smoking or never smoking like a,

2224
00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.070
that's part of the thing to me.

2225
00:57:57.070 --> 00:57:58.540
Like it's always amazing to me.

2226
00:57:58.541 --> 00:57:59.140
Like,

2227
00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:01.770
I'll get messages from people on like I could smoke you under the table.

2228
00:58:01.771 --> 00:58:02.051
And I'm like,

2229
00:58:02.051 --> 00:58:03.380
so like that's,

2230
00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.260
that's what smoking weed is about.

2231
00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:07.210
That's a new being the best at it.

2232
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:08.830
Being aggressive about it.

2233
00:58:08.831 --> 00:58:09.071
Like,

2234
00:58:09.071 --> 00:58:09.311
no,

2235
00:58:09.311 --> 00:58:13.420
it's about having fun and enjoying yourself dudes though.

2236
00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:14.530
Everything's about that.

2237
00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:14.741
Well,

2238
00:58:14.741 --> 00:58:19.520
sure that some people are just so tightly wound that even weeds not going to,

2239
00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:19.900
you know,

2240
00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:20.920
relax him that much.

2241
00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:22.920
But I think it helps everybody that,

2242
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:23.350
that,

2243
00:58:23.350 --> 00:58:23.950
you know,

2244
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:25.090
most people that use it,

2245
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:26.170
it can be overused.

2246
00:58:26.171 --> 00:58:26.920
Like anything.

2247
00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:27.221
Yeah,

2248
00:58:27.221 --> 00:58:28.120
it certainly can.

2249
00:58:28.121 --> 00:58:29.200
But you're right about most people,

2250
00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:32.380
a lot of people rather being tightly wound that the idea,

2251
00:58:32.381 --> 00:58:35.260
I mean that's part of why I like it is cause I'm kind of a nervous,

2252
00:58:35.261 --> 00:58:37.720
anxious person by nature and uh,

2253
00:58:37.810 --> 00:58:38.350
you know,

2254
00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:42.820
smoking all the time just helps me to just relax and not worry about shit so

2255
00:58:42.821 --> 00:58:43.654
much.

2256
00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:44.800
I still worry about it.

2257
00:58:44.801 --> 00:58:47.710
It's not like I'm checking out completely,

2258
00:58:47.711 --> 00:58:48.341
you know what I mean?

2259
00:58:48.341 --> 00:58:51.100
It's more like you're just opening your mind to,

2260
00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:51.490
you know,

2261
00:58:51.490 --> 00:58:56.490
lots of stuff and hopefully you know enough good stuff that uh,

2262
00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.180
you know,

2263
00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:00.690
you can not worry the other when you have

2264
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:03.610
Jesus Christ,

2265
00:59:04.070 --> 00:59:06.250
you've got so many ideas right now flowing.

2266
00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:08.170
None of trying to catch salmon.

2267
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.700
Yeah.

2268
00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:10.481
I'm just saying that it,

2269
00:59:10.481 --> 00:59:10.710
like,

2270
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:11.800
it not only relaxes me,

2271
00:59:11.801 --> 00:59:16.480
but it also helps me to write and think of things and you know,

2272
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:18.190
oh most definitely it,

2273
00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:18.761
you know,

2274
00:59:18.761 --> 00:59:19.181
it's not,

2275
00:59:19.181 --> 00:59:20.980
it's not all just one thing that it does.

2276
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:21.321
No,

2277
00:59:21.321 --> 00:59:22.070
I think it's very

2278
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:22.903
<v 1>beneficial.</v>

2279
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:26.900
But I think the people develop patterns and sometimes those patterns get out of

2280
00:59:26.901 --> 00:59:27.440
control.

2281
00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:29.210
It's really easy for a person,

2282
00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:31.850
especially of comedic tendencies.

2283
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:35.030
Someone who's got that kind of impulsive nature to them anyway,

2284
00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:36.760
they can just get out of control with something.

2285
00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:38.780
So sometimes it's good to just write the ship,

2286
00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:40.093
you know?

2287
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:41.900
So sometimes it's good when a guy does that.

2288
00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:42.830
Absolutely.

2289
00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:43.071
Yeah.

2290
00:59:43.071 --> 00:59:44.390
He was smoking all day every day.

2291
00:59:44.391 --> 00:59:45.140
Like I,

2292
00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:48.380
there's some days where I'll wake up and I'll sit around for a while and I won't

2293
00:59:48.381 --> 00:59:50.750
smoke cause I tend 20 it's not like,

2294
00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:51.501
oh I just woke up,

2295
00:59:51.501 --> 00:59:52.640
I have to do this,

2296
00:59:52.641 --> 00:59:54.980
you know what I have to do to get through the day.

2297
00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:55.701
It's not,

2298
00:59:55.701 --> 00:59:57.260
I never have that feeling about it,

2299
00:59:57.290 --> 00:59:58.123
you know?

2300
00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.560
It's more like I'll do it when I do it.

2301
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:02.210
Do you see the thing about the Tsa,

2302
01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.550
Tsa is going to let people bring weed on planes,

2303
01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:08.270
but how much and where from anywhere to anywhere.

2304
01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:12.010
Because a lot of states it's still illegal to wear the,

2305
01:00:12.011 --> 01:00:13.580
the idea being that there,

2306
01:00:13.581 --> 01:00:14.780
it's going to be a don't ask,

2307
01:00:14.781 --> 01:00:17.120
don't tell sort of situation and a,

2308
01:00:17.130 --> 01:00:17.841
if you're bringing,

2309
01:00:17.841 --> 01:00:22.160
we'd say if you have a license in Massachusetts and he also have a license in

2310
01:00:22.161 --> 01:00:22.731
Los Angeles,

2311
01:00:22.731 --> 01:00:25.640
you find from Los Angeles where you have a license to Massachusetts where you

2312
01:00:25.641 --> 01:00:26.420
have a license,

2313
01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:27.200
you're good to go.

2314
01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.600
I think you can only get a license in the state you live in though.

2315
01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:30.440
Is that true?

2316
01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.040
I think so.

2317
01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.420
We need to buy real estate and other places,

2318
01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:35.060
Bro Ball or if you want to fly with weed,

2319
01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:36.740
do you still have property in Colorado?

2320
01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:37.600
Is that why?

2321
01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.490
Imagine if you did that,

2322
01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:42.440
get a fucking a house you kept everywhere and every state just so you could fly

2323
01:00:42.441 --> 01:00:43.100
with your weed.

2324
01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:46.070
That would be the ultimate baller legal in every state.

2325
01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:47.990
And I got a f B could still do it anyway.

2326
01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:49.090
Yeah.

2327
01:00:49.090 --> 01:00:50.900
I mean I don't recommend flying with a lot of it,

2328
01:00:50.901 --> 01:00:52.550
but the TSA is not,

2329
01:00:52.551 --> 01:00:53.001
they're not,

2330
01:00:53.001 --> 01:00:54.510
their job is not defined.

2331
01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:55.880
It's not to,

2332
01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:56.700
you know,

2333
01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:57.160
uh,

2334
01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:59.780
Gilligan arrest people for minor drug crimes.

2335
01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:04.400
Like they're looking for shit that's going to cause everybody to die to die.

2336
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.711
Yeah.

2337
01:01:04.711 --> 01:01:06.740
But they have busted people before.

2338
01:01:06.741 --> 01:01:10.400
I mean Warwick got caught with a bunch of joints in her.

2339
01:01:10.401 --> 01:01:11.050
Um,

2340
01:01:11.050 --> 01:01:11.900
it was like a lipstick case.

2341
01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:12.860
How long ago was that?

2342
01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:13.550
Oh,

2343
01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:14.500
I think it's been a while.

2344
01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:14.900
Cause like,

2345
01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:18.800
cause like you don't hear of celebrity pot busts that much anymore.

2346
01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:20.030
And um,

2347
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:20.991
you know,

2348
01:01:20.991 --> 01:01:24.320
if they were still going on you would hear even more about them cause he's TMZ

2349
01:01:24.321 --> 01:01:24.741
and everything.

2350
01:01:24.741 --> 01:01:26.210
That's just looking for those stories,

2351
01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.073
right?

2352
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:28.130
Yeah.

2353
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:28.341
No,

2354
01:01:28.341 --> 01:01:29.850
I definitely think that they're looking for weapons.

2355
01:01:29.850 --> 01:01:30.050
One,

2356
01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:30.980
they're looking for anything,

2357
01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:33.650
but I go to the airport a lot.

2358
01:01:33.651 --> 01:01:37.180
I've never seen anybody pulled aside for,

2359
01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:38.740
for anything but like it,

2360
01:01:38.741 --> 01:01:39.030
you know,

2361
01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:40.580
fully what they do is they call the cops

2362
01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:46.070
never see actual cops cruising around in the airport that much other than,

2363
01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:47.030
you know,

2364
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:48.680
driving and driving around outside.

2365
01:01:48.681 --> 01:01:49.431
Like they don't let you know,

2366
01:01:49.431 --> 01:01:50.720
they don't like cars to stop.

2367
01:01:50.721 --> 01:01:52.760
And you know when they're picking people up,

2368
01:01:52.761 --> 01:01:53.990
the cops keep it moving.

2369
01:01:54.350 --> 01:01:55.640
Well it depends on where you are.

2370
01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.020
If you're in Texas,

2371
01:01:57.050 --> 01:01:58.430
you very well could see that.

2372
01:01:58.690 --> 01:01:59.211
Not only that,

2373
01:01:59.211 --> 01:02:01.430
you could see someone going to jail for weed for real,

2374
01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:02.241
no doubt about it.

2375
01:02:02.241 --> 01:02:05.540
If they pull you over for a stop violation and they find weed on you,

2376
01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:07.700
there's a lot of cops that have put you in jail in Texas.

2377
01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:08.301
Absolutely.

2378
01:02:08.301 --> 01:02:09.110
That's legit.

2379
01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:10.010
California.

2380
01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:14.030
The laws are so lenient right now that we have the medical marijuana and then we

2381
01:02:14.031 --> 01:02:15.410
also have decriminalization.

2382
01:02:15.411 --> 01:02:20.010
That's Arnold Schwarzenegger pass that when he got it office quietly nice and

2383
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:20.843
<v 0>silent,</v>

2384
01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.380
it was the best thing that he ever did.

2385
01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:23.400
And uh,

2386
01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.290
what it means is that you can't go to jail for it,

2387
01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:25.950
which is,

2388
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:26.371
you know,

2389
01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:27.150
makes sense.

2390
01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:28.530
It's fucking ridiculous.

2391
01:02:28.531 --> 01:02:32.530
We're still in this weird sort of a wrestling match with a,

2392
01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:34.000
with reality when it comes to that

2393
01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:39.100
<v 2>easy way to round up people that aren't white is what these minor drug offenses</v>

2394
01:02:40.311 --> 01:02:40.521
are.

2395
01:02:40.521 --> 01:02:45.521
The prisons are full of people that are Hispanic and black and they had three

2396
01:02:46.491 --> 01:02:48.280
strikes that are all just like a,

2397
01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:49.130
you know,

2398
01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:51.320
three pot things in a row or something.

2399
01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:53.090
And now they're in jail.

2400
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.560
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2401
01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:55.161
The uh,

2402
01:02:55.161 --> 01:02:58.730
the isn't private prison industry is a ve.

2403
01:02:58.760 --> 01:02:59.450
What are you doing Brian?

2404
01:02:59.450 --> 01:02:59.961
That's the tug.

2405
01:02:59.961 --> 01:03:00.794
Benson,

2406
01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:01.760
the OCULUS rift.

2407
01:03:01.761 --> 01:03:03.800
This has absolutely nothing to do with what we're talking about,

2408
01:03:03.801 --> 01:03:04.221
but it is,

2409
01:03:04.221 --> 01:03:04.960
but it is funny.

2410
01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.550
Brian made a vine of me wearing the oculus.

2411
01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:09.831
There's nothing to do.

2412
01:03:09.831 --> 01:03:09.921
What?

2413
01:03:09.921 --> 01:03:11.090
We're talking crazy glasses.

2414
01:03:11.091 --> 01:03:11.331
Yeah.

2415
01:03:11.331 --> 01:03:11.900
But it was,

2416
01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:14.630
it was funny when it happened cause I didn't know he was filming me.

2417
01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:15.673
There's a,

2418
01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:16.880
there was an article on boiling,

2419
01:03:16.881 --> 01:03:21.881
boiling the other day about prison profiteers extracting billions by exploiting

2420
01:03:22.551 --> 01:03:23.780
prisoners and their families.

2421
01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.300
It's really fucking scary shit.

2422
01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:27.080
Um,

2423
01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:27.913
I don't know.

2424
01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:30.280
I don't know how much the,

2425
01:03:30.370 --> 01:03:30.760
the,

2426
01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.730
the prison system influences the way laws are formed,

2427
01:03:35.090 --> 01:03:37.370
but the idea that they could possibly do that at all.

2428
01:03:37.371 --> 01:03:38.450
It's really creepy.

2429
01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.530
The idea that you're benefiting from people being in new jails,

2430
01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:43.850
profiting from people,

2431
01:03:43.851 --> 01:03:48.851
being in your jails and spending money to try to promote laws that would keep

2432
01:03:49.461 --> 01:03:54.461
people from getting away with certain crimes so that you can profit off of them.

2433
01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:55.220
Yeah.

2434
01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:55.631
Like you're,

2435
01:03:55.631 --> 01:03:57.530
you're trying to make things illegal

2436
01:03:57.610 --> 01:03:57.960
<v 2>as long.</v>

2437
01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.250
And we all know while they're there,

2438
01:03:59.251 --> 01:03:59.701
whatever,

2439
01:03:59.701 --> 01:04:01.200
whatever criminal acts did,

2440
01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:03.060
they don't know how to do or haven't done.

2441
01:04:03.061 --> 01:04:05.040
They learn all about it while they're in prison.

2442
01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:06.570
This is very scary.

2443
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:07.890
And then they go back out and they,

2444
01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:09.300
that's all they know what it,

2445
01:04:09.301 --> 01:04:10.290
what else they gonna do.

2446
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.983
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2447
01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.030
It's really fucking stranger.

2448
01:04:14.031 --> 01:04:14.841
And then there's also,

2449
01:04:14.841 --> 01:04:15.990
they're talking about the,

2450
01:04:15.991 --> 01:04:19.280
the issue with people getting sick and in prison they're talking about the,

2451
01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:20.210
it says the cruelty,

2452
01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:24.350
the prison medical contractors who ration vital treatments to prisoners,

2453
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:26.360
leaving them in agony and worse.

2454
01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:27.111
For example,

2455
01:04:27.111 --> 01:04:30.530
correctional medical services discourages treatment for hepatitis,

2456
01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:35.920
leaving prisoners with Hep C to slide into permanent profound disability.

2457
01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:37.760
Wow,

2458
01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:39.500
that's insane.

2459
01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:40.490
Super messed up.

2460
01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:41.510
That's insane.

2461
01:04:41.810 --> 01:04:42.320
Like they,

2462
01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.610
they put you in a cage and then they don't provide you with medical attention if

2463
01:04:46.611 --> 01:04:50.360
you're dying of a curable disease or at least a treatable disease,

2464
01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.830
that's fucking scary.

2465
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:54.530
That means they're not responsible for keeping you a healthier,

2466
01:04:54.531 --> 01:04:55.070
alive.

2467
01:04:55.070 --> 01:04:58.430
Like they can just treat you as a subhuman and put you in a cage.

2468
01:04:59.450 --> 01:05:00.283
I mean,

2469
01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.990
I guess maybe it would depend on what kind of a person you are.

2470
01:05:02.991 --> 01:05:06.590
If you're some guy went into a school and just start shooting kids.

2471
01:05:06.591 --> 01:05:06.831
Yeah.

2472
01:05:06.831 --> 01:05:08.900
I don't really think you should get any fucking medicine,

2473
01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:11.180
but that's a very rare,

2474
01:05:11.181 --> 01:05:13.190
small segment of our population.

2475
01:05:13.191 --> 01:05:14.900
There really should be snuffed out.

2476
01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:17.280
Like there's no sense in keeping those people alive.

2477
01:05:17.290 --> 01:05:17.980
Like God kind of

2478
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:18.813
<v 5>situation.</v>

2479
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.730
Someone he is fucking mass shooter,

2480
01:05:21.930 --> 01:05:22.131
he's,

2481
01:05:22.131 --> 01:05:26.650
he's about to go out and do that sort of thing again someday if f ever or

2482
01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:30.490
they're just going to sit in jail for the rest of it.

2483
01:05:30.491 --> 01:05:32.800
Like it's just a waste of everybody's time and money.

2484
01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:34.780
So when this horrible,

2485
01:05:34.781 --> 01:05:36.010
horrible person can,

2486
01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:37.121
yeah,

2487
01:05:37.121 --> 01:05:37.301
I mean,

2488
01:05:37.301 --> 01:05:38.440
so anybody else that's,

2489
01:05:38.441 --> 01:05:39.480
you're not treating like,

2490
01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:39.950
what do you do?

2491
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:44.050
You're going to let them die and fall apart of something that you've got the

2492
01:05:44.051 --> 01:05:45.700
medicine right there and you could just give it to him,

2493
01:05:45.790 --> 01:05:49.090
like how much money you guys make per prisoner or how much money is this fucking

2494
01:05:49.091 --> 01:05:49.930
thing make a year?

2495
01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:51.460
Like what's going on here?

2496
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:55.270
You guys are making how much you guys are making millions and millions and

2497
01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:56.470
millions of dollars off of prisons.

2498
01:05:56.471 --> 01:06:01.471
Like it's a money generating machine that's fucking terrifying.

2499
01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:03.071
That said,

2500
01:06:03.071 --> 01:06:05.860
if they're like rapists or murderers,

2501
01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:06.551
it's not going to,

2502
01:06:06.551 --> 01:06:06.731
I'm,

2503
01:06:06.731 --> 01:06:06.971
you know,

2504
01:06:06.971 --> 01:06:10.030
I'm not going to feel more people that we have more people in prison and per

2505
01:06:10.031 --> 01:06:11.110
capita than any other,

2506
01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.130
any other country.

2507
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:12.760
And it's by,

2508
01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.720
it's by far.

2509
01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:15.640
It's not just by a small margin.

2510
01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:15.791
Oh,

2511
01:06:15.791 --> 01:06:16.690
it's a massive amount.

2512
01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:17.471
Yeah,

2513
01:06:17.471 --> 01:06:18.304
it's a massive amount.

2514
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:19.030
But you know,

2515
01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:21.700
the argument is that's also why America is so safe.

2516
01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:24.070
Whom a man,

2517
01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:26.410
no place is safe.

2518
01:06:26.790 --> 01:06:27.130
Well,

2519
01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:27.410
when you're,

2520
01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:29.230
when you're around other human beings.

2521
01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:30.213
Yeah.

2522
01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:32.470
Well when there's disparity and when,

2523
01:06:32.471 --> 01:06:36.400
when there's poverty and when there's people that are ignored and marginalized,

2524
01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:36.950
that's the,

2525
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:37.271
you know,

2526
01:06:37.271 --> 01:06:39.670
there's an issue in this country where everybody's like,

2527
01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.010
hey,

2528
01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:42.370
people should pull themselves up by their bootstraps.

2529
01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:45.790
And I agreed to do a certain extent.

2530
01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:46.571
I agree.

2531
01:06:46.571 --> 01:06:49.060
If your conditions are optimal,

2532
01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:51.460
if you don't have health issues,

2533
01:06:51.490 --> 01:06:56.200
if you are not in a terrible violent neighborhood trapped in this horrible

2534
01:06:56.201 --> 01:06:56.860
school system,

2535
01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:58.570
if all those factors aren't,

2536
01:06:58.750 --> 01:06:59.141
then yeah,

2537
01:06:59.141 --> 01:07:00.850
you should probably pull yourself by your bootstraps.

2538
01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:02.080
Stop fucking crying.

2539
01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:03.790
Cause you could be one of those kids.

2540
01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:08.290
You can be someone whose situation is fucked from the jump and there's nothing

2541
01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:09.041
you can do about it.

2542
01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:10.480
Everyone's abusing you.

2543
01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:11.950
You've got people hitting you,

2544
01:07:11.951 --> 01:07:13.340
there's violence around you.

2545
01:07:13.341 --> 01:07:13.580
You,

2546
01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:15.670
you don't know what you don't know how to read.

2547
01:07:15.671 --> 01:07:16.421
You're a fucked,

2548
01:07:16.421 --> 01:07:17.740
your whole situation is fucked.

2549
01:07:18.330 --> 01:07:20.740
To tell those people to pull themselves up by their bootstraps,

2550
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:22.630
who's going to teach them how to do that?

2551
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:24.490
Who's going to teach them how to develop character?

2552
01:07:24.491 --> 01:07:26.830
Who's going to teach them to eliminate bad behavior patterns?

2553
01:07:26.831 --> 01:07:26.961
You know,

2554
01:07:26.961 --> 01:07:31.660
how fucking difficult it is to change a person as opposed to develop a person.

2555
01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.310
It's insanely difficult.

2556
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:34.780
So in that sense,

2557
01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:39.670
we're really ridiculous that we ignore the impoverished sections of our cities.

2558
01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:42.220
It's ridiculous to allow that to ever happen.

2559
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.900
That should never be taken place.

2560
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.590
And everybody was like,

2561
01:07:44.590 --> 01:07:44.951
Ooh,

2562
01:07:44.951 --> 01:07:45.581
to youtube,

2563
01:07:45.581 --> 01:07:45.791
you know,

2564
01:07:45.791 --> 01:07:46.570
idea.

2565
01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:47.620
Exactly.

2566
01:07:47.621 --> 01:07:47.890
Yeah.

2567
01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:48.191
And it's,

2568
01:07:48.191 --> 01:07:48.731
by the way,

2569
01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:51.040
it's not like putting people on fucking Mars.

2570
01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:53.530
It's a utopian concept that can be achieved.

2571
01:07:53.830 --> 01:07:58.780
It's a utopian concept that using a fraction of the money we use to support

2572
01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:02.710
these fucking corrupt dictators all throughout the world,

2573
01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:07.800
a fraction of that could clean up every fucking city in America easily,

2574
01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:09.243
easily.

2575
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:09.940
You know,

2576
01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:10.720
people say that,

2577
01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:11.051
you know,

2578
01:08:11.051 --> 01:08:11.500
people,

2579
01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:15.980
people think that the idea of food stamps is that those people are all just uh,

2580
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:16.790
<v 3>you know,</v>

2581
01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:21.790
living on the Dole or whatever and just like kicking back and getting the money

2582
01:08:22.161 --> 01:08:26.960
and it's like a dollar 50 per person in your family per day is not,

2583
01:08:27.490 --> 01:08:31.670
you're not living the life you're struggling to get by and you're probably all

2584
01:08:31.671 --> 01:08:34.640
fat because the food you're eating is all just disgusting.

2585
01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:35.630
You know,

2586
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:39.650
dollar burgers at Mcdonald's and that's the shit you're feeding to your kids

2587
01:08:39.651 --> 01:08:40.340
because you can't,

2588
01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:41.420
it's like Eh,

2589
01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:42.351
it's,

2590
01:08:42.351 --> 01:08:46.520
the system is set up to keep the poor to create more poor.

2591
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:48.230
I don't think it's set up that way.

2592
01:08:48.231 --> 01:08:49.070
I think it take it,

2593
01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:50.420
it just isn't that way.

2594
01:08:51.010 --> 01:08:51.290
Yeah.

2595
01:08:51.290 --> 01:08:51.660
Yeah.

2596
01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:52.150
It takes

2597
01:08:52.150 --> 01:08:55.420
<v 5>vantage of poor people and poor people also get stuck in a Rut.</v>

2598
01:08:55.570 --> 01:08:55.811
I mean,

2599
01:08:55.811 --> 01:08:56.230
it's true.

2600
01:08:56.230 --> 01:08:59.740
We don't have a class system in this country and this is a country where a

2601
01:08:59.741 --> 01:09:04.210
person can be poor and can be really good at something and then eventually want

2602
01:09:04.211 --> 01:09:05.770
to being a wealthy person because of that.

2603
01:09:05.771 --> 01:09:07.240
This is a very rare situation.

2604
01:09:07.241 --> 01:09:11.590
Like that where like a rapper can go from being like in a impoverished

2605
01:09:11.591 --> 01:09:13.840
neighborhood to being like a celebrity,

2606
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:17.350
like a Jay z guy who like a great sports.

2607
01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:17.740
Yeah.

2608
01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:17.921
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2609
01:09:17.921 --> 01:09:19.630
And then export to some extent,

2610
01:09:19.730 --> 01:09:20.231
you know,

2611
01:09:20.231 --> 01:09:21.490
other forms of performing,

2612
01:09:21.491 --> 01:09:22.001
but it's,

2613
01:09:22.001 --> 01:09:22.860
but it's hard to,

2614
01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:26.470
how do you develop that skill if you're poor and you have to,

2615
01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:26.831
you know,

2616
01:09:26.831 --> 01:09:29.020
work all the time or be starving all the the

2617
01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:32.410
<v 5>time and you and you all have any guide.</v>

2618
01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:33.610
You don't have role models.

2619
01:09:33.611 --> 01:09:35.530
Like we need to learn from older people.

2620
01:09:35.531 --> 01:09:36.970
And like I said before,

2621
01:09:36.971 --> 01:09:41.500
it's way harder to change someone once they become a certain way,

2622
01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:45.610
it's way hard to accept that you are fucking up,

2623
01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:47.860
that your personality has holes in it,

2624
01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:48.431
that you,

2625
01:09:48.431 --> 01:09:48.641
you know,

2626
01:09:48.641 --> 01:09:48.911
you're,

2627
01:09:48.911 --> 01:09:49.840
you're psychotic,

2628
01:09:49.841 --> 01:09:50.830
you're abusive,

2629
01:09:50.831 --> 01:09:51.850
you're manipulative,

2630
01:09:51.851 --> 01:09:53.470
like whatever it is that's wrong with you.

2631
01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.540
You can't be told that things might be him.

2632
01:09:55.541 --> 01:09:57.760
I had to go without become you become defensive.

2633
01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:58.990
Almost everybody does.

2634
01:09:58.991 --> 01:09:59.350
Yeah.

2635
01:09:59.350 --> 01:10:00.430
Almost everybody does.

2636
01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:01.330
They don't want to hear it.

2637
01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:01.990
Yeah.

2638
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:03.430
And so changing.

2639
01:10:03.431 --> 01:10:04.930
It's super fucking hard to do.

2640
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:09.160
But when someone who inspires you and you're around people that are admirable

2641
01:10:09.161 --> 01:10:12.790
and someone cares about you and they show you the benefits of living a certain

2642
01:10:12.791 --> 01:10:13.490
way,

2643
01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:17.740
they instruct you on the benefits of being positive and friendly that you could

2644
01:10:17.741 --> 01:10:18.574
change in time,

2645
01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:19.370
generations,

2646
01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:22.030
just massive change throughout our entire country.

2647
01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:26.260
If we just established some community centers where we made sure there was

2648
01:10:26.261 --> 01:10:27.460
plenty of cops around,

2649
01:10:27.461 --> 01:10:28.540
that everything was safe.

2650
01:10:28.810 --> 01:10:33.810
We cut way back on the crime by putting money into these areas and making areas

2651
01:10:34.121 --> 01:10:35.620
where people can feel safe,

2652
01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:37.510
where kids can feel safe after school,

2653
01:10:37.511 --> 01:10:40.200
where they're going to meet like counselors and and and,

2654
01:10:40.201 --> 01:10:43.900
and coaches and people that were happy to be working there.

2655
01:10:43.901 --> 01:10:46.930
Helping these young kids and teaching them how to play a gang games,

2656
01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:48.190
get along with each other,

2657
01:10:48.191 --> 01:10:52.000
teaching a little bit about character and and having a place where they know

2658
01:10:52.001 --> 01:10:53.140
that they don't have to worry.

2659
01:10:53.141 --> 01:10:54.610
They're going to get food for sure.

2660
01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:57.040
They're going to get someone who cares about them for sure.

2661
01:10:57.190 --> 01:11:01.900
They're going to get people that can instruct them and various elusive aspects

2662
01:11:01.901 --> 01:11:02.321
of life.

2663
01:11:02.321 --> 01:11:05.770
When you're a young man or a young woman and you're growing up in a terrible

2664
01:11:05.771 --> 01:11:06.550
neighborhood,

2665
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:07.720
we don't take care of that.

2666
01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:10.990
And that's one of the reasons why we have to worry about bad neighborhoods.

2667
01:11:10.991 --> 01:11:13.000
It's one of the reasons why we have to worry about poverty.

2668
01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:16.920
It's because people have just been fucking shit on from the moment that they

2669
01:11:16.921 --> 01:11:18.180
came out of their mother's womb.

2670
01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:19.740
They just never got a break.

2671
01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.150
And that's not fair.

2672
01:11:21.151 --> 01:11:24.810
And they see people like you or like I or like,

2673
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:25.121
you know,

2674
01:11:25.121 --> 01:11:28.860
a nice white people that live in Nice neighborhoods that have never really

2675
01:11:28.861 --> 01:11:32.760
experienced anything horrible like that and they almost feel like you stole

2676
01:11:32.761 --> 01:11:33.594
something.

2677
01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:35.360
You feel like you stole something from him.

2678
01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:35.971
Why us?

2679
01:11:35.971 --> 01:11:37.050
Why instead of them?

2680
01:11:37.051 --> 01:11:37.531
Exactly.

2681
01:11:37.531 --> 01:11:41.430
It's all just cosmic a luck of the draw.

2682
01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:46.580
But it seems like it's the Utopian concept is achievable in that way,

2683
01:11:47.101 --> 01:11:52.101
that you can at least have a massive impact on the society if you started taking

2684
01:11:53.341 --> 01:11:56.940
care of its young a little bit better or helping them taking care of its young,

2685
01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:58.800
relieving a little bit of the burden,

2686
01:11:59.040 --> 01:11:59.310
you know?

2687
01:11:59.310 --> 01:12:01.830
And the idea that it creates more welfare.

2688
01:12:01.831 --> 01:12:03.810
Welfare creates more welfare and you know,

2689
01:12:03.811 --> 01:12:05.910
people creates people that can't help themselves.

2690
01:12:06.330 --> 01:12:07.163
It doesn't have to be,

2691
01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:07.730
it's not,

2692
01:12:07.730 --> 01:12:09.870
it does not have to be that you either.

2693
01:12:09.871 --> 01:12:10.230
There's,

2694
01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:14.940
there can be a way to do it where you're trying to help people help themselves

2695
01:12:15.090 --> 01:12:16.260
and it's just set up like that.

2696
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:21.350
The amount of money we spend and rebuilding places that we explode is fucking

2697
01:12:21.511 --> 01:12:22.680
staggering.

2698
01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:25.620
When you look at the amount of money like military contractors got for

2699
01:12:25.621 --> 01:12:29.040
rebuilding Iraq and they just built shit that they didn't even need like water

2700
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:30.830
treatment plants like well we got to build once,

2701
01:12:30.850 --> 01:12:31.710
we're going to put one right here.

2702
01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:33.060
I got a contract to do this.

2703
01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:35.220
Like there was a lot of complaints about that kind of shit.

2704
01:12:35.221 --> 01:12:37.290
It's just like they had these,

2705
01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:41.340
they had to spend an x amount of money to justify the amount of money that was

2706
01:12:41.341 --> 01:12:42.150
coming to them.

2707
01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:43.320
So they're constantly,

2708
01:12:43.530 --> 01:12:44.300
you know,

2709
01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.190
do shit machines.

2710
01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:48.090
The newest TSA machines are all,

2711
01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:53.120
that's some government contract paid for those and paid off somebody to supply

2712
01:12:54.151 --> 01:12:54.990
all the airports with them.

2713
01:12:54.991 --> 01:12:57.030
You know the ones that we have to stand with your hands over your head.

2714
01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:57.991
Not only that,

2715
01:12:57.991 --> 01:13:00.060
the guy who sold it to them,

2716
01:13:00.061 --> 01:13:00.841
one of the machines,

2717
01:13:00.841 --> 01:13:02.760
at least he used to work for the TSA.

2718
01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:05.160
He's be like the president of the Tsa and then he leaves.

2719
01:13:05.161 --> 01:13:09.060
He makes us fucking machine that's involved in cells into the Tsi.

2720
01:13:09.061 --> 01:13:10.440
It's like what the hell?

2721
01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:13.110
But the TSA is not like a government organization.

2722
01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:15.850
The TSA is like private organization.

2723
01:13:15.851 --> 01:13:16.530
So that's,

2724
01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:18.060
it's actually a normal thing.

2725
01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:21.690
I think it's government because they're checking your shit and they're going

2726
01:13:21.691 --> 01:13:22.710
through your underwear and stuff,

2727
01:13:22.711 --> 01:13:23.491
but it's really not.

2728
01:13:23.491 --> 01:13:24.900
It's like they work for the government.

2729
01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:25.773
Yeah.

2730
01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.360
So that's why like if you had some weed on you,

2731
01:13:27.361 --> 01:13:28.290
they'd have to call a cop.

2732
01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:29.251
They can't arrest you,

2733
01:13:29.251 --> 01:13:30.084
they can't do shit.

2734
01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:31.830
I think they just say,

2735
01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:32.723
you know,

2736
01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.750
they bring a cop over.

2737
01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:34.171
They'd know.

2738
01:13:34.171 --> 01:13:36.330
They say throw it out or something that you hope.

2739
01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:37.111
No,

2740
01:13:37.111 --> 01:13:38.400
I mean that's the anecdotally,

2741
01:13:38.401 --> 01:13:40.980
that's what I always hear is that that's the worst thing that happens.

2742
01:13:40.981 --> 01:13:42.330
But also again,

2743
01:13:42.331 --> 01:13:42.690
it's,

2744
01:13:42.690 --> 01:13:45.960
these are white friends of mine with a very small amount of weed on them.

2745
01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:46.350
Yeah.

2746
01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:49.200
And it's probably happening in California and mean El Paso.

2747
01:13:49.410 --> 01:13:49.651
Yeah.

2748
01:13:49.651 --> 01:13:49.980
Yeah.

2749
01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:50.813
And it's like,

2750
01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:52.350
like you were saying earlier though,

2751
01:13:52.351 --> 01:13:53.184
I mean it's going to,

2752
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:54.570
there's definitely like,

2753
01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:58.650
I think that Oregon and Washington and um,

2754
01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:00.000
maybe Colorado,

2755
01:14:00.001 --> 01:14:01.140
maybe all of those,

2756
01:14:01.141 --> 01:14:06.090
you can fly from state to state if you have a card in one of them.

2757
01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:07.290
I think,

2758
01:14:07.290 --> 01:14:07.370
uh,

2759
01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:07.760
yeah,

2760
01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.200
those two things.

2761
01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:11.780
I don't want to hear what I'm getting on a plane with weed maybe.

2762
01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:12.010
And I

2763
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:15.340
<v 3>think possibly that sounds like a disaster,</v>

2764
01:14:15.370 --> 01:14:15.611
but that's,

2765
01:14:15.611 --> 01:14:18.370
so that's the trouble with hanging out with stoners though and talking to him

2766
01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:22.190
about these things is people will tell you emphatically things that aren't,

2767
01:14:22.350 --> 01:14:23.183
aren't true.

2768
01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:23.890
You know?

2769
01:14:23.890 --> 01:14:25.210
Like they'll still just say,

2770
01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:25.391
no,

2771
01:14:25.391 --> 01:14:25.721
you can,

2772
01:14:25.721 --> 01:14:26.380
you got your card.

2773
01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:27.610
You could definitely fly there.

2774
01:14:27.611 --> 01:14:28.450
And they don't.

2775
01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.040
That's something they heard from another dude.

2776
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.781
Well tell me if the,

2777
01:14:30.781 --> 01:14:32.800
you think this is true because one of those,

2778
01:14:33.130 --> 01:14:34.400
do you think that,

2779
01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:38.290
I've read this online and I'm very curious because I think I might be just

2780
01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.540
feeding this problem that this uh,

2781
01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:45.780
US shutdown the shutdown of the U S it has driving traffic to sugar daddy sites

2782
01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:48.520
and the sugar daddy sites.

2783
01:14:48.521 --> 01:14:53.260
A sugar daddy side is where like a girl can go and like people can like bid on

2784
01:14:53.261 --> 01:14:54.100
taking her on a date.

2785
01:14:54.101 --> 01:14:54.750
I guess.

2786
01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:58.090
I like old rich dudes who got some fucking billionaire.

2787
01:14:58.090 --> 01:15:01.570
Dude's got some cash and all of us and I'm just looking at your profile.

2788
01:15:01.571 --> 01:15:02.291
I'll pay your rent.

2789
01:15:02.291 --> 01:15:02.890
Like what's up?

2790
01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:03.940
Like let's work something out.

2791
01:15:03.970 --> 01:15:04.510
Yeah,

2792
01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:06.730
they went up 50% why?

2793
01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:07.360
I Dunno,

2794
01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:08.193
that's my question.

2795
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:11.620
Do you think that that's true or do you think that that's a really smart

2796
01:15:11.621 --> 01:15:15.280
business move by this company to release a press statement saying that their

2797
01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:17.890
business went up 50% because we're talking about them.

2798
01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:19.120
We're talking about him now.

2799
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:20.550
New sponsors that you're not known.

2800
01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:21.310
No sponsor.

2801
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:22.170
I'm just confused.

2802
01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:22.930
What would the,

2803
01:15:22.930 --> 01:15:25.740
what would the direct connection be between the shutdown?

2804
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:30.250
Exactly that going up because it's like all the shutdown has done is furloughed

2805
01:15:30.251 --> 01:15:35.251
a lot of people that probably are orange and we never will be sugar daddies and

2806
01:15:36.071 --> 01:15:40.150
it's not necessarily making the people that are rich more money because of the

2807
01:15:40.151 --> 01:15:40.750
shutdown.

2808
01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:41.710
Is it a no,

2809
01:15:41.711 --> 01:15:45.200
I think the idea is that there's a bunch of people that don't have jobs now and

2810
01:15:45.201 --> 01:15:48.490
so they have nothing better to do than go and bid on dates.

2811
01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:48.641
No,

2812
01:15:48.641 --> 01:15:48.701
no,

2813
01:15:48.701 --> 01:15:48.881
no.

2814
01:15:48.881 --> 01:15:52.110
The girls that girls like what you're seeing more girls are going there.

2815
01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:53.620
More girls are checking it out.

2816
01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:54.513
Exactly.

2817
01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:58.410
Imagine that these girls are falling the news closely enough to,

2818
01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:00.100
to know that the government might,

2819
01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:01.130
is shutting down,

2820
01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:02.420
that we might default on the,

2821
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:03.300
on the debt.

2822
01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:04.080
I don't know.

2823
01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:04.590
I really,

2824
01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:05.100
I don't know.

2825
01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:06.610
And that they're that panicked about it,

2826
01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.410
what it's gonna do to them directly.

2827
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.771
Well,

2828
01:16:08.771 --> 01:16:13.771
it could be that someone who is already financially in a bad situation and then

2829
01:16:14.261 --> 01:16:16.900
they see something like that starting to panic because you know,

2830
01:16:16.901 --> 01:16:20.170
Obama saying stuff like we might go into a worse for a session and the one we

2831
01:16:20.171 --> 01:16:21.970
were just in exactly.

2832
01:16:21.971 --> 01:16:24.460
If we don't settle this debt ceiling thing.

2833
01:16:24.670 --> 01:16:25.330
So yeah.

2834
01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:26.080
Uh,

2835
01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:26.950
so that's possible.

2836
01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:31.030
I thought you meant that there's more guys money with money trying to get these

2837
01:16:31.031 --> 01:16:31.570
girls,

2838
01:16:31.570 --> 01:16:33.040
but it just seems like a,

2839
01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:34.540
not a coincidence,

2840
01:16:34.541 --> 01:16:35.530
but it just seems like,

2841
01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:36.240
you know,

2842
01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:39.700
it's probably going to be on a steady rise for a while until the economy gets

2843
01:16:39.701 --> 01:16:40.534
better.

2844
01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:41.561
They're saying,

2845
01:16:41.561 --> 01:16:42.520
they're saying it's sudden.

2846
01:16:42.521 --> 01:16:44.800
They're saying it's a sudden spike.

2847
01:16:44.801 --> 01:16:45.211
Yes.

2848
01:16:45.211 --> 01:16:48.970
They're saying 50% jump since the government shutdown.

2849
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:49.660
I don't know if the,

2850
01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:51.400
I can't see those two being connected.

2851
01:16:51.670 --> 01:16:52.290
I Dunno.

2852
01:16:52.290 --> 01:16:54.130
Join one of those websites recently.

2853
01:16:54.131 --> 01:16:54.400
Joe,

2854
01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.650
did you really seeking arrangement.com and what you do is,

2855
01:16:57.870 --> 01:16:59.500
is this a fucking telling us all about it?

2856
01:16:59.501 --> 01:17:00.070
Yeah.

2857
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:01.090
And if you use the coupon code,

2858
01:17:01.091 --> 01:17:01.510
no,

2859
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.811
no,

2860
01:17:01.811 --> 01:17:02.440
but uh,

2861
01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:03.190
and uh,

2862
01:17:03.190 --> 01:17:04.030
it's so weird,

2863
01:17:04.031 --> 01:17:04.360
man.

2864
01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:08.170
Like there's this people that you just tell them like how much money you make

2865
01:17:08.171 --> 01:17:10.180
and do this and that is a tank you,

2866
01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:14.000
it seems like there would be a smart move if you were just looking to find

2867
01:17:14.001 --> 01:17:17.540
people to meet that or it seems like a website in your money.

2868
01:17:17.610 --> 01:17:18.050
No.

2869
01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:21.410
What is it only your running pretty much entering anything else?

2870
01:17:21.411 --> 01:17:23.390
Like what you do or what your interest story.

2871
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:24.290
You don't have to write anything.

2872
01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:24.680
Wife,

2873
01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:29.680
I've have so many messages since I just recently did this as a joke and I only

2874
01:17:30.501 --> 01:17:34.040
have one photo and it's a blurry photo cause I didn't want anyone to see that.

2875
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:34.963
Your real name?

2876
01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:35.510
Uh,

2877
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:36.340
no.

2878
01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:39.090
And it's like that's my photo look up blurry that is blurred.

2879
01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:40.433
I 10 I'm sorry.

2880
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:42.800
Start trolling you dummy.

2881
01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:45.430
Why wasn't really using this as like,

2882
01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:46.580
I'm going to even check it.

2883
01:17:46.581 --> 01:17:47.630
I forgot all about it.

2884
01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:48.051
But anyway,

2885
01:17:48.051 --> 01:17:52.520
my point is do you think that there's a panic in the air and that's why the

2886
01:17:52.521 --> 01:17:55.040
sugar daddy websites get an upswing of traffic?

2887
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.730
That's the idea.

2888
01:17:55.730 --> 01:17:56.001
Maybe.

2889
01:17:56.001 --> 01:17:56.570
Yeah,

2890
01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:57.440
maybe.

2891
01:17:57.650 --> 01:18:00.890
Maybe more women or giving women and giving up.

2892
01:18:00.891 --> 01:18:01.251
It's not just,

2893
01:18:01.251 --> 01:18:01.790
you can say,

2894
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.971
well,

2895
01:18:01.971 --> 01:18:03.470
giving up on the idea of just,

2896
01:18:03.471 --> 01:18:04.304
you know,

2897
01:18:04.890 --> 01:18:05.410
rolling.

2898
01:18:05.410 --> 01:18:09.590
I don't want to say that they're not willing to willing or able to stand on

2899
01:18:09.591 --> 01:18:09.981
their own,

2900
01:18:09.981 --> 01:18:10.581
but they're just,

2901
01:18:10.581 --> 01:18:13.620
there seems to be some women in society that are,

2902
01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:14.960
they're fine with the idea of,

2903
01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:15.620
you know,

2904
01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:17.180
meeting a man with some money and not,

2905
01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:18.860
and then just doing whatever.

2906
01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:19.131
You know,

2907
01:18:19.131 --> 01:18:22.100
they're not necessarily both the guys nice.

2908
01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:22.670
Yeah.

2909
01:18:22.670 --> 01:18:24.110
But they're not necessarily like Wah,

2910
01:18:24.190 --> 01:18:27.910
but every woman I meet seems to not be interested in,

2911
01:18:27.911 --> 01:18:29.180
in money these days.

2912
01:18:29.181 --> 01:18:30.014
But that's,

2913
01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:32.810
that just might be just because with a bunch of liars.

2914
01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:35.121
I mean,

2915
01:18:35.121 --> 01:18:35.780
nobody's ever,

2916
01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:38.780
I don't feel like anybody's ever come on to me because I have a little bit of

2917
01:18:38.781 --> 01:18:39.390
money.

2918
01:18:39.390 --> 01:18:39.541
<v 5>Well,</v>

2919
01:18:39.541 --> 01:18:40.440
you're a smart guy.

2920
01:18:40.441 --> 01:18:42.150
He's not hanging around with a bunch of assholes,

2921
01:18:42.151 --> 01:18:43.400
but without the bow,

2922
01:18:43.650 --> 01:18:46.560
there are people that will hang out with you just because they think that

2923
01:18:46.561 --> 01:18:48.060
somehow know that they could profit from it.

2924
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.711
You know,

2925
01:18:48.711 --> 01:18:49.081
you could,

2926
01:18:49.081 --> 01:18:51.500
you could definitely stumble into the wrong crowd and you,

2927
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:51.790
you,

2928
01:18:51.790 --> 01:18:52.623
you haven't,

2929
01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:54.090
you certainly could.

2930
01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:58.230
This is a weird thing where people worry about what other people do for money.

2931
01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.010
Like uh,

2932
01:18:59.010 --> 01:18:59.250
uh,

2933
01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:03.810
if there's some Gal who's a married to some 60 year old guy and she's 24 and

2934
01:19:03.811 --> 01:19:05.490
she's driving a Ferrari and you're like,

2935
01:19:05.491 --> 01:19:05.671
oh,

2936
01:19:05.671 --> 01:19:06.391
this is bullshit.

2937
01:19:06.391 --> 01:19:08.280
Like what do you care?

2938
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:09.990
Like why would you care at all?

2939
01:19:09.991 --> 01:19:11.430
Why would you care what she does?

2940
01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:12.473
Why would you care what he,

2941
01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.610
<v 3>those two are working it out and chances are,</v>

2942
01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:15.230
you know,

2943
01:19:15.230 --> 01:19:18.050
especially the guys probably also still kind of miserable,

2944
01:19:18.051 --> 01:19:18.351
you know,

2945
01:19:18.351 --> 01:19:19.190
because it's not,

2946
01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:21.170
it's not a real relationship,

2947
01:19:21.171 --> 01:19:24.920
but it's the fuck knows that's what he's settling for or what he was enjoying at

2948
01:19:24.921 --> 01:19:25.311
the time.

2949
01:19:25.311 --> 01:19:26.030
So why not?

2950
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.990
It is possible.

2951
01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:28.670
It's also possible that they like each other.

2952
01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:29.421
That's possible too.

2953
01:19:29.421 --> 01:19:30.254
It's not as likely,

2954
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:32.600
but it's possible.

2955
01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:33.680
They like each other for,

2956
01:19:33.710 --> 01:19:34.431
for reasons.

2957
01:19:34.431 --> 01:19:34.641
You know,

2958
01:19:34.641 --> 01:19:36.050
she's hot and he's got money,

2959
01:19:36.051 --> 01:19:36.280
you know,

2960
01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:37.113
that they,

2961
01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:38.770
they both get something out of it.

2962
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:40.000
<v 5>She struggled,</v>

2963
01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:40.331
you know,

2964
01:19:40.331 --> 01:19:40.781
and he,

2965
01:19:40.781 --> 01:19:43.930
he's a materialist and he likes taking care of people.

2966
01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:44.793
It makes them feel good.

2967
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:51.550
<v 3>I do fall into matters very much like taking care of people.</v>

2968
01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:52.590
Do you like it

2969
01:19:52.590 --> 01:19:52.951
<v 5>that though?</v>

2970
01:19:52.951 --> 01:19:54.030
Just because you're nice,

2971
01:19:54.150 --> 01:19:54.421
you know,

2972
01:19:54.421 --> 01:19:56.910
because it is a nice thing to be able to help someone out.

2973
01:19:56.911 --> 01:19:59.460
When you meet someone and you see that they're struggling and help them.

2974
01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:01.110
It's a nice feeling to be able to do

2975
01:20:01.570 --> 01:20:01.661
<v 3>well.</v>

2976
01:20:01.661 --> 01:20:04.210
I had an idea when you were talking about earlier about why,

2977
01:20:04.211 --> 01:20:06.280
why not start like a Joe Rogan,

2978
01:20:06.281 --> 01:20:07.150
a fight camps.

2979
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:08.040
Underprivileged

2980
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:08.490
<v 5>kids.</v>

2981
01:20:08.490 --> 01:20:09.090
Good idea.

2982
01:20:09.090 --> 01:20:11.640
You want to organize it president?

2983
01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:13.010
Yeah,

2984
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:15.360
I know right now the scammers will start coming up.

2985
01:20:15.450 --> 01:20:15.931
That's another thing.

2986
01:20:15.931 --> 01:20:19.170
You have to be really careful about getting weird things that people come up to

2987
01:20:19.171 --> 01:20:20.100
you with like they,

2988
01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:20.491
well,

2989
01:20:20.491 --> 01:20:23.880
any charities like the where you want to find out when you get involved in a

2990
01:20:23.881 --> 01:20:24.211
charity,

2991
01:20:24.211 --> 01:20:27.300
whether or not it's legit because unfortunately there have been illegit

2992
01:20:27.301 --> 01:20:27.990
charities.

2993
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:30.120
I've retweeted things sometimes because I think,

2994
01:20:30.121 --> 01:20:30.840
you know,

2995
01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.100
pulls on my heartstrings and I'm like,

2996
01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:34.950
I'll try to help these people and then I immediately get all these emails back.

2997
01:20:34.951 --> 01:20:36.300
That place is a scam.

2998
01:20:36.301 --> 01:20:36.700
That's a,

2999
01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:37.260
that's a,

3000
01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:38.220
you just gave me a virus.

3001
01:20:38.221 --> 01:20:39.060
You fuck yeah.

3002
01:20:39.061 --> 01:20:39.930
Or whatever it is.

3003
01:20:39.931 --> 01:20:40.231
Yeah.

3004
01:20:40.231 --> 01:20:41.064
It's uh,

3005
01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:41.910
so it's,

3006
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:43.050
it's hard to not,

3007
01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:43.651
you know,

3008
01:20:43.651 --> 01:20:44.610
retweet those things.

3009
01:20:44.611 --> 01:20:46.050
But what do you remember Kony?

3010
01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:47.810
Remember Kony 2000 watts?

3011
01:20:47.850 --> 01:20:49.770
One of the examples where people are all over my shit.

3012
01:20:49.770 --> 01:20:51.140
Just cause I tried to help,

3013
01:20:51.150 --> 01:20:53.670
I just watched the video and was moved by it and it was like,

3014
01:20:53.671 --> 01:20:53.971
okay,

3015
01:20:53.971 --> 01:20:55.050
everybody should watch this.

3016
01:20:55.410 --> 01:20:56.191
And then immediately,

3017
01:20:56.191 --> 01:20:57.024
oh that guy.

3018
01:20:58.460 --> 01:20:59.100
Yeah.

3019
01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:01.350
A few weeks later he's running around naked in the streets.

3020
01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:02.640
That was,

3021
01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:07.470
that was one of my favorite moments in all of civilization because it was so

3022
01:21:07.471 --> 01:21:08.071
absurd.

3023
01:21:08.071 --> 01:21:09.210
It was so quick,

3024
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:10.050
immediate,

3025
01:21:10.050 --> 01:21:11.040
all encompassing.

3026
01:21:11.041 --> 01:21:12.150
Everyone was Kony.

3027
01:21:12.151 --> 01:21:14.400
2012 there was bumper stickers and tee shirts.

3028
01:21:14.401 --> 01:21:15.270
I saw them everywhere.

3029
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:16.830
I saw posters.

3030
01:21:16.831 --> 01:21:19.020
I saw so much about it in the news.

3031
01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:21.300
I saw it on websites all the time.

3032
01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:23.490
And then boom,

3033
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:24.833
gone.

3034
01:21:25.050 --> 01:21:25.650
I mean,

3035
01:21:25.650 --> 01:21:28.920
in a flash it was the flavor of the month.

3036
01:21:28.921 --> 01:21:32.730
Literally it lasted about a month and after it was over,

3037
01:21:32.731 --> 01:21:34.860
millions of dollars had been exchanged.

3038
01:21:35.130 --> 01:21:38.850
One guy had ran around beating off in the street naked and you never heard from

3039
01:21:38.851 --> 01:21:43.200
him or anything to do with it ever again.

3040
01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.650
You're coneys just still doing his thing,

3041
01:21:46.651 --> 01:21:47.340
I guess.

3042
01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:49.230
I don't know what the fuck he was doing in the first place.

3043
01:21:49.231 --> 01:21:51.240
Isn't that place like flooded with guys like that?

3044
01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:51.991
I think so.

3045
01:21:51.991 --> 01:21:53.980
I think that's what part of it was.

3046
01:21:53.981 --> 01:21:54.360
It's like,

3047
01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:54.750
you know,

3048
01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:55.261
oh sure.

3049
01:21:55.261 --> 01:21:55.630
That's,

3050
01:21:55.630 --> 01:21:56.610
that's a good cause,

3051
01:21:56.611 --> 01:22:00.570
but that's not going to solve the overall problem and that there's many,

3052
01:22:01.290 --> 01:22:02.123
you know,

3053
01:22:02.970 --> 01:22:04.140
evil people like that.

3054
01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:04.920
Yeah.

3055
01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:05.610
Um,

3056
01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:05.851
yeah,

3057
01:22:05.851 --> 01:22:06.810
Africa is,

3058
01:22:06.811 --> 01:22:07.591
why don't we say that?

3059
01:22:07.591 --> 01:22:09.300
If you want to find the apocalypse,

3060
01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:11.580
you can find it right now.

3061
01:22:11.610 --> 01:22:13.230
2013 in Africa.

3062
01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:16.680
Like if you watched that vice documentary on Liberia,

3063
01:22:16.681 --> 01:22:21.681
have you ever seen that captain or a general butt naked duties to take off all

3064
01:22:21.871 --> 01:22:26.490
his clothes and run naked and fucking killing people in war would eat children's

3065
01:22:26.491 --> 01:22:27.324
hearts.

3066
01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.370
Cut the enemy's children's heart,

3067
01:22:29.371 --> 01:22:30.210
take their children,

3068
01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:31.050
cut their hair down,

3069
01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:31.883
eat it.

3070
01:22:32.010 --> 01:22:32.221
See,

3071
01:22:32.221 --> 01:22:34.620
that's a guy that just needs to find weed and just,

3072
01:22:34.621 --> 01:22:35.700
he's still alive.

3073
01:22:35.701 --> 01:22:36.480
Fuck down.

3074
01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:38.430
He's responsible for thousands of deaths,

3075
01:22:38.431 --> 01:22:39.680
including children that he ate,

3076
01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:40.560
ate their hearts,

3077
01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:45.120
still alive and was forgiven because now he's a Christian preacher.

3078
01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:46.921
Oh,

3079
01:22:46.921 --> 01:22:47.754
okay.

3080
01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:49.493
Yeah.

3081
01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:50.700
People are trying to crop,

3082
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:51.350
you know,

3083
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:52.310
they're trying again.

3084
01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:52.970
He's so he's,

3085
01:22:52.970 --> 01:22:53.300
you know,

3086
01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:54.450
it's like he's a different person.

3087
01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.840
Came out of his mother's vagina all over again,

3088
01:22:58.170 --> 01:22:58.951
but it's a,

3089
01:22:58.951 --> 01:23:00.690
when you watched them interviewing him,

3090
01:23:00.691 --> 01:23:02.400
man in Liberia,

3091
01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:03.450
it's fucking crazy.

3092
01:23:03.451 --> 01:23:04.410
That was our boy Shane.

3093
01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:04.930
I bought,

3094
01:23:04.930 --> 01:23:06.430
it was like one of the best,

3095
01:23:06.610 --> 01:23:11.610
<v 0>most like in depth pieces I've ever seen on a country in massive turmoil where</v>

3096
01:23:13.331 --> 01:23:13.841
this guy,

3097
01:23:13.841 --> 01:23:17.680
general butt naked was talking about how he knows what human flesh tastes like.

3098
01:23:17.681 --> 01:23:20.110
And he found a vendor that was selling meat on the corner.

3099
01:23:20.111 --> 01:23:22.990
It was human flesh and he had to tell the police because he knows what flesh

3100
01:23:22.991 --> 01:23:23.824
tastes like.

3101
01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:25.630
Like he's eating so many people,

3102
01:23:25.631 --> 01:23:26.680
he knows what people tastes like.

3103
01:23:26.681 --> 01:23:27.670
So when they're serving people,

3104
01:23:27.671 --> 01:23:27.971
it was like,

3105
01:23:27.971 --> 01:23:28.810
this is not cow.

3106
01:23:28.811 --> 01:23:29.740
This is people.

3107
01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:32.260
And then he brings over the cops and they arrest that guy.

3108
01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:32.800
Meanwhile,

3109
01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:36.040
he's eating babies and because he's got a Bible there,

3110
01:23:36.041 --> 01:23:37.120
letting him run the streets.

3111
01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:40.190
That's way crazier than Matt backs that.

3112
01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:42.850
That's way crazier than Thunderdome.

3113
01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:44.073
Two men,

3114
01:23:44.490 --> 01:23:45.390
one man leap,

3115
01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:46.870
he eight babies,

3116
01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:47.501
k,

3117
01:23:47.501 --> 01:23:50.320
he cut their hearts out and now he talks about an old,

3118
01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:51.610
he reads from an old book.

3119
01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:54.340
And because of that he's allowed to just roam the streets.

3120
01:23:54.341 --> 01:23:56.080
You're responsible for thousands of deaths.

3121
01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:57.430
It's a,

3122
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:58.390
it's a crazy place,

3123
01:23:58.391 --> 01:23:58.690
man.

3124
01:23:58.690 --> 01:23:59.341
That's a cro.

3125
01:23:59.341 --> 01:24:00.520
Raise the place.

3126
01:24:01.630 --> 01:24:02.710
He and he was forgiven.

3127
01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:04.181
Did you,

3128
01:24:04.181 --> 01:24:04.391
uh,

3129
01:24:04.391 --> 01:24:05.350
have you heard about that movie?

3130
01:24:05.351 --> 01:24:06.370
The act of killing?

3131
01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:09.360
<v 7>MMM.</v>

3132
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:10.263
<v 2>What is this?</v>

3133
01:24:10.690 --> 01:24:15.100
These old genocidal dudes that were involved in genocides are like telling the

3134
01:24:15.101 --> 01:24:16.570
stories and reenacting,

3135
01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:17.030
uh,

3136
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.350
the,

3137
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:19.720
the way Cambodia way they kill people.

3138
01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:20.051
Yeah.

3139
01:24:20.051 --> 01:24:20.501
And it's,

3140
01:24:20.501 --> 01:24:21.250
uh,

3141
01:24:21.250 --> 01:24:22.660
it's supposedly,

3142
01:24:22.661 --> 01:24:23.494
I mean it's,

3143
01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:24.700
everyone says it's a great film,

3144
01:24:24.701 --> 01:24:28.270
but I haven't watched it yet because it just sounds so horrible to see these

3145
01:24:28.271 --> 01:24:31.030
people who got away with this shit bragging about it.

3146
01:24:31.031 --> 01:24:31.540
You know,

3147
01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:32.380
I can't do that,

3148
01:24:32.381 --> 01:24:33.214
man.

3149
01:24:33.490 --> 01:24:34.070
I can't,

3150
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.280
you know,

3151
01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:35.500
just to be a great film though.

3152
01:24:35.710 --> 01:24:35.861
Oh,

3153
01:24:35.861 --> 01:24:36.790
I'm sure it's great.

3154
01:24:36.970 --> 01:24:39.270
But I did this because they get these guys to shit.

3155
01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:42.160
They get these guys to reenact scenes where they killed people,

3156
01:24:42.161 --> 01:24:43.630
like using old movies,

3157
01:24:43.631 --> 01:24:43.990
like,

3158
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.420
you know,

3159
01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:45.420
like Scarface,

3160
01:24:45.890 --> 01:24:46.480
shut down,

3161
01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:47.290
please shut this off.

3162
01:24:47.290 --> 01:24:47.411
Oh,

3163
01:24:47.411 --> 01:24:48.550
is that what it is to Brian?

3164
01:24:48.551 --> 01:24:49.360
Put it up there.

3165
01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.193
I don't want to watch that,

3166
01:24:50.650 --> 01:24:51.311
but it's a,

3167
01:24:51.311 --> 01:24:51.581
yeah,

3168
01:24:51.581 --> 01:24:52.810
that movie's really,

3169
01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:53.650
uh,

3170
01:24:53.650 --> 01:24:56.920
people described as an extremely intense experience.

3171
01:24:57.130 --> 01:24:57.251
<v 0>Oh,</v>

3172
01:24:57.251 --> 01:24:58.084
I'm sure.

3173
01:24:58.380 --> 01:24:59.730
Human beings are incredible,

3174
01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:01.200
incredible,

3175
01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:03.150
weird things and what we're capable of.

3176
01:25:03.151 --> 01:25:05.070
Some really fucking heinous things.

3177
01:25:05.670 --> 01:25:06.870
Really heinous acts.

3178
01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:07.640
Yeah.

3179
01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:08.473
And it,

3180
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.380
could that ever change?

3181
01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:13.110
Is it possible for what's definitely changing?

3182
01:25:13.410 --> 01:25:14.520
There's way less of it.

3183
01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:15.120
Sure.

3184
01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:19.230
I think if you look at the actual numbers of human beings in comparison to what

3185
01:25:19.231 --> 01:25:21.510
they were just a hundred years ago or 200 years ago,

3186
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:25.110
and then you factor in the amount of death and murder and chaos,

3187
01:25:25.111 --> 01:25:27.630
and it's probably safer now than ever before.

3188
01:25:27.690 --> 01:25:28.440
Probably.

3189
01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:28.801
Maybe,

3190
01:25:28.801 --> 01:25:29.670
maybe debatable,

3191
01:25:29.850 --> 01:25:30.031
you know,

3192
01:25:30.031 --> 01:25:32.760
because now we can wipe out the larger numbers quicker.

3193
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:34.140
Everybody lives longer for sure.

3194
01:25:34.170 --> 01:25:35.003
For sure.

3195
01:25:35.010 --> 01:25:35.843
So,

3196
01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:37.013
you know,

3197
01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:37.980
it's,

3198
01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:38.191
it's,

3199
01:25:38.191 --> 01:25:39.240
it's very debatable,

3200
01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:40.251
but there's,

3201
01:25:40.251 --> 01:25:43.530
there's still no question that there's areas of the world right now where they

3202
01:25:43.531 --> 01:25:44.161
live in,

3203
01:25:44.161 --> 01:25:44.910
in justice,

3204
01:25:44.910 --> 01:25:45.743
chaotic,

3205
01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:45.990
uh,

3206
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:47.430
situation and the,

3207
01:25:47.431 --> 01:25:48.930
as has ever existed,

3208
01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:50.700
but the people in Africa,

3209
01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:51.840
like he's perfectly example,

3210
01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:52.853
Somalia,

3211
01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:55.140
all those people that,

3212
01:25:55.141 --> 01:25:55.411
uh,

3213
01:25:55.411 --> 01:25:57.480
were forced to become pirates because,

3214
01:25:57.481 --> 01:25:57.720
uh,

3215
01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:58.321
all their,

3216
01:25:58.321 --> 01:25:58.650
uh,

3217
01:25:58.650 --> 01:26:03.650
fishing waters were polluted by a European businesses that with Tom Hanks looks

3218
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.640
<v 2>intense,</v>

3219
01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:05.473
very intense.

3220
01:26:06.450 --> 01:26:07.350
<v 0>The origin of that,</v>

3221
01:26:07.351 --> 01:26:07.561
you know,

3222
01:26:07.561 --> 01:26:10.980
they call themselves the volunteer coast guard of Somalia,

3223
01:26:11.130 --> 01:26:12.270
that's what they call themselves.

3224
01:26:12.570 --> 01:26:16.200
They all started doing that because these fucking guys had no fish anymore.

3225
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:20.370
These Europeans would dump waste off the shore and just polluted everything,

3226
01:26:20.371 --> 01:26:21.204
killed everything.

3227
01:26:21.570 --> 01:26:22.950
And so these poor fucking people,

3228
01:26:23.130 --> 01:26:24.420
they started kidnapping.

3229
01:26:24.421 --> 01:26:26.640
These boat captains had dumped his stuff off the shore.

3230
01:26:26.641 --> 01:26:27.360
They would find them,

3231
01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:29.270
they would find the oil slick and follow the bone.

3232
01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:29.910
Yeah,

3233
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:30.211
they,

3234
01:26:30.211 --> 01:26:30.600
uh,

3235
01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:32.280
started getting way,

3236
01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:34.920
way more money doing that than they ever got fishing.

3237
01:26:35.130 --> 01:26:35.641
So they're like,

3238
01:26:35.641 --> 01:26:36.690
fuck fishing.

3239
01:26:37.050 --> 01:26:40.800
And they just became kidnappers and now they're just these gangster crazy fucks

3240
01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:42.120
that have nothing to lose.

3241
01:26:42.270 --> 01:26:44.190
And they're on this thing called cat,

3242
01:26:44.490 --> 01:26:45.121
which is a,

3243
01:26:45.121 --> 01:26:45.460
it's,

3244
01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:45.960
it's a,

3245
01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:46.550
it's a,

3246
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:51.350
it's a leave that you chew and it's got like a narcotic effect,

3247
01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:52.770
like a stimulant effect,

3248
01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:53.701
not narcotic,

3249
01:26:53.701 --> 01:26:57.840
like a almost like amphetamines and they chew that shit and it makes them

3250
01:26:57.841 --> 01:26:58.674
bonkers.

3251
01:26:58.800 --> 01:26:59.730
So the eighth is drug.

3252
01:26:59.731 --> 01:26:59.911
They,

3253
01:26:59.911 --> 01:27:02.910
they're literally method out with submachine guns.

3254
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.320
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

3255
01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:05.230
True trigger happy trigger.

3256
01:27:05.250 --> 01:27:05.840
Have nothing.

3257
01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:06.840
No doubt.

3258
01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:08.670
I guess in like a,

3259
01:27:08.671 --> 01:27:10.110
in some cases they've got,

3260
01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:11.851
you know,

3261
01:27:11.851 --> 01:27:13.240
if they kill everybody then they,

3262
01:27:13.241 --> 01:27:13.710
then they're,

3263
01:27:13.710 --> 01:27:16.380
they're cutting into how much money they could potentially make.

3264
01:27:16.381 --> 01:27:16.730
Right.

3265
01:27:16.730 --> 01:27:17.040
Cause they,

3266
01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:20.370
cause they hold these things for ransom so they can't,

3267
01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.540
they can't kill everybody.

3268
01:27:21.541 --> 01:27:25.950
But they still probably are so crazy that sometimes,

3269
01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:26.730
you know,

3270
01:27:26.730 --> 01:27:28.520
it's hard to keep control of all your,

3271
01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:29.443
your men.

3272
01:27:30.030 --> 01:27:30.480
Right,

3273
01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:30.901
exactly.

3274
01:27:30.901 --> 01:27:32.310
I'm sure there's situations like that.

3275
01:27:32.311 --> 01:27:33.260
This captain Phillips movie,

3276
01:27:33.261 --> 01:27:36.000
it's the same guy who did those first two born movies and uh,

3277
01:27:36.330 --> 01:27:36.751
and the,

3278
01:27:36.751 --> 01:27:37.200
uh,

3279
01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:39.480
United whatever the flight number was.

3280
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.410
I can't,

3281
01:27:40.410 --> 01:27:40.921
I don't know why.

3282
01:27:40.921 --> 01:27:42.120
I can't ever remember that.

3283
01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:46.800
I guess cause it's such an unpleasant idea that the movie was named after a

3284
01:27:46.801 --> 01:27:47.730
flight that crashed.

3285
01:27:47.731 --> 01:27:48.061
What was it?

3286
01:27:48.061 --> 01:27:51.390
[inaudible] 93 Paul Greengrass did that.

3287
01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.010
And so this is going to be the same level of intensity I think.

3288
01:27:56.010 --> 01:27:56.990
Have you seen gravity dog?

3289
01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:58.500
You sound like a guy who loves movies.

3290
01:27:59.130 --> 01:28:00.000
Have you seen gravity?

3291
01:28:00.510 --> 01:28:01.380
I think you'd like that.

3292
01:28:01.410 --> 01:28:01.590
Yeah,

3293
01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:02.423
you'll love it.

3294
01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:05.220
And people were given Neil degrasse Tyson shit on Twitter,

3295
01:28:05.221 --> 01:28:05.520
man.

3296
01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:07.260
Oh cause he,

3297
01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:09.750
cause he said things are inaccurate or something.

3298
01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:10.620
It,

3299
01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:11.320
who cares?

3300
01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.660
What if you know him,

3301
01:28:12.661 --> 01:28:14.700
he would have said those things with a big smile on his face.

3302
01:28:14.701 --> 01:28:14.820
Yeah,

3303
01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:15.451
I don't mind.

3304
01:28:15.451 --> 01:28:16.560
Miss said that he enjoyed it.

3305
01:28:16.650 --> 01:28:16.980
I don't,

3306
01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:17.191
yeah,

3307
01:28:17.191 --> 01:28:19.160
I don't mind that he's pointing out the inaccuracies.

3308
01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:20.130
I just say who cares?

3309
01:28:20.131 --> 01:28:20.910
Because it's like,

3310
01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:24.450
it's one of those things where the movie just has to get me to a point where I

3311
01:28:24.451 --> 01:28:26.220
believe what's happening in the movie.

3312
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:26.760
You know,

3313
01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:27.300
that it's,

3314
01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:30.630
it's telling a good story and it doesn't seem fake or stupid,

3315
01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:31.590
you know?

3316
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:32.970
And I'm just a layman,

3317
01:28:32.971 --> 01:28:33.360
you know?

3318
01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:33.720
Yeah.

3319
01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:33.871
Well,

3320
01:28:33.871 --> 01:28:35.430
that's what people are giving him a hard time about.

3321
01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:36.690
Like lawyers can't watch

3322
01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:40.130
<v 0>not having a suspension of disbelief for a movie like this.</v>

3323
01:28:40.150 --> 01:28:40.760
Yeah.

3324
01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:43.130
And people were making fun of them saying like,

3325
01:28:43.131 --> 01:28:45.650
you're always the guy who's trying to,

3326
01:28:45.651 --> 01:28:46.280
uh,

3327
01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:50.300
push science and here's a movie that shows space and that you weren't into it.

3328
01:28:50.510 --> 01:28:51.111
It's really interesting.

3329
01:28:51.111 --> 01:28:52.280
I was reading these people,

3330
01:28:52.281 --> 01:28:52.730
uh,

3331
01:28:52.730 --> 01:28:52.971
uh,

3332
01:28:52.971 --> 01:28:53.601
attacking him,

3333
01:28:53.601 --> 01:28:54.050
but

3334
01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:54.360
<v 2>he,</v>

3335
01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:55.191
he's right.

3336
01:28:55.191 --> 01:28:55.821
First of all,

3337
01:28:55.821 --> 01:28:56.900
everything he's saying is correct.

3338
01:28:56.930 --> 01:28:58.760
And if he was saying it in front of you,

3339
01:28:58.761 --> 01:29:00.470
he would be smiling and you would love it.

3340
01:29:01.010 --> 01:29:02.040
Like a lot is lost

3341
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:02.611
<v 1>in text,</v>

3342
01:29:02.611 --> 01:29:06.240
especially when he said that it was a good movie.

3343
01:29:06.241 --> 01:29:07.074
Yeah.

3344
01:29:07.170 --> 01:29:07.951
It's a fun movie.

3345
01:29:07.951 --> 01:29:08.521
But you know,

3346
01:29:08.521 --> 01:29:10.810
a lawyer goes to any movie that takes place in a courtroom,

3347
01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:14.400
they're going to tell you every fucking thing that's not accurate.

3348
01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:18.240
And then it's the power of that individual movie to overcome that.

3349
01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:18.661
You know,

3350
01:29:18.661 --> 01:29:19.111
like it's,

3351
01:29:19.111 --> 01:29:22.500
it's just a version of space that's being sold to us for entertainment.

3352
01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:23.431
You know,

3353
01:29:23.431 --> 01:29:25.290
it's not a documentary.

3354
01:29:25.770 --> 01:29:28.950
He wrote my tweets after everybody went after him.

3355
01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:31.770
He wrote my tweets hardly ever convey opinion,

3356
01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:33.600
mostly perspectives on the world.

3357
01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:37.320
But if you must know I enjoyed gravity very much so.

3358
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:40.680
He just enjoys gravity every day cause he would hate to just float away.

3359
01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:42.270
He's giving you a fax.

3360
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:45.630
Me like mysteries of gravity,

3361
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:47.090
nearly all satellites order,

3362
01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:47.580
orbit,

3363
01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:48.840
Earth West to east.

3364
01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:52.620
Yet all satellite debris portrayed orbited east to west.

3365
01:29:54.090 --> 01:29:54.421
Okay.

3366
01:29:54.421 --> 01:29:55.320
He's just right.

3367
01:29:55.820 --> 01:29:56.760
It's only saying,

3368
01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:57.061
I mean,

3369
01:29:57.061 --> 01:29:57.894
and there's nothing,

3370
01:29:57.930 --> 01:29:59.370
it's not going to ruin my,

3371
01:29:59.430 --> 01:30:00.780
my enjoyment of the movie.

3372
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:04.650
I remember there was a movie a long time ago called crack Atella east of Java

3373
01:30:04.651 --> 01:30:08.070
about a volcano and crack Atalla is west of Java.

3374
01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.680
It's just wrong right there in the title.

3375
01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:11.431
Yeah,

3376
01:30:11.431 --> 01:30:15.470
so little then there's not much gravity and gravity as it turns out in the

3377
01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:16.380
streets of gravity.

3378
01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:17.580
Why bullocks hair,

3379
01:30:17.581 --> 01:30:22.581
otherwise convincingly zero in in otherwise convincing zero g scenes did not

3380
01:30:23.791 --> 01:30:25.440
float freely on her head.

3381
01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:26.910
So he's just basically,

3382
01:30:26.911 --> 01:30:31.050
he was talking about the actual scientific inaccuracy in the movie.

3383
01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:35.070
She looks good when she's floating around in her little like a sports outfit.

3384
01:30:35.071 --> 01:30:39.270
Basically my take is if you're going to fucking make a movie like this,

3385
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:41.490
talk to Neil degrasse Tyson first,

3386
01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:45.180
throw homeboy a couple grand and give him the script and said,

3387
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:46.020
Hey Dawg,

3388
01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:49.080
let us know if there's some shit in here that doesn't fly because you're talking

3389
01:30:49.081 --> 01:30:51.450
about fucking science and he's an astrophysicist.

3390
01:30:51.690 --> 01:30:52.051
I mean,

3391
01:30:52.051 --> 01:30:53.580
he's the guy who's going to know about it,

3392
01:30:53.670 --> 01:30:54.540
but you know,

3393
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:55.750
no,

3394
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:56.150
I mean,

3395
01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:57.080
I don't want to watch it.

3396
01:30:57.090 --> 01:30:59.910
Knows the difference when the degree he knows you're just going,

3397
01:30:59.911 --> 01:31:00.421
Holy Shit,

3398
01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:02.670
look at that debris that's crashing into them.

3399
01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:03.630
It's so exciting.

3400
01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:05.430
But couldn't it have just been the right way?

3401
01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:08.400
It couldn't have been west to east or whichever one was the right way.

3402
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:09.360
I don't know.

3403
01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:09.650
Why wouldn't,

3404
01:31:09.650 --> 01:31:10.483
why not do it that way?

3405
01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:15.500
We've got to talk to Alphonso Kieron maybe it's a alternate universe where Chris

3406
01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:16.671
is our universe.

3407
01:31:16.671 --> 01:31:17.461
This didn't really happen.

3408
01:31:17.461 --> 01:31:18.300
And the alternate universe,

3409
01:31:18.301 --> 01:31:20.490
it travels in a different direction and uh,

3410
01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:24.660
the g zero g has no effect on your hair and the alternate universe.

3411
01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:28.470
Maybe they just got super dope hairspray in the future and just slapped that

3412
01:31:28.471 --> 01:31:29.130
bitch on.

3413
01:31:29.130 --> 01:31:30.810
And no matter how much the wind blows,

3414
01:31:30.811 --> 01:31:33.120
it just looks so natural and sits there perfectly.

3415
01:31:33.150 --> 01:31:33.901
It's like a shield.

3416
01:31:33.901 --> 01:31:34.734
She's a me.

3417
01:31:34.770 --> 01:31:37.080
I just wasn't really looking at her hair personally.

3418
01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:38.520
What were you looking at her feet?

3419
01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:40.260
Like little outfit.

3420
01:31:40.261 --> 01:31:40.771
She's actually,

3421
01:31:40.771 --> 01:31:44.280
her haircut makes her look like she's wearing like a green shirt and she has a

3422
01:31:44.281 --> 01:31:44.610
haircut,

3423
01:31:44.610 --> 01:31:46.710
so she kind of looks like Peter Pan Floating around.

3424
01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:48.053
But um,

3425
01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:50.190
but she's still,

3426
01:31:50.191 --> 01:31:50.660
uh,

3427
01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:50.870
I,

3428
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:53.880
I've always liked Sandra Bullock as a person and as a,

3429
01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:54.750
you know,

3430
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:56.250
I've always thought she was attractive,

3431
01:31:56.490 --> 01:31:57.470
but man,

3432
01:31:57.520 --> 01:31:59.040
she dumb movies all the time,

3433
01:31:59.050 --> 01:31:59.950
so I'm just excited.

3434
01:31:59.951 --> 01:32:01.150
She's in a good one.

3435
01:32:01.151 --> 01:32:03.580
Something that I like and it's only 90 minutes long.

3436
01:32:03.610 --> 01:32:03.971
Wait a minute,

3437
01:32:03.971 --> 01:32:04.301
wait a minute,

3438
01:32:04.301 --> 01:32:04.691
wait a minute.

3439
01:32:04.691 --> 01:32:05.320
Wait a minute.

3440
01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:07.840
So you didn't like that cop movie with her and the dude from [inaudible],

3441
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:08.703
Mike and Molly.

3442
01:32:08.710 --> 01:32:10.150
The dude or the girl?

3443
01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:11.000
Russell McCarthy.

3444
01:32:12.730 --> 01:32:13.660
I haven't seen that one.

3445
01:32:13.890 --> 01:32:17.410
I meant to cause I like bridesmaids and the director Paul Feig,

3446
01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:18.251
but I,

3447
01:32:18.251 --> 01:32:18.620
uh,

3448
01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:19.900
the dude from Mike and Molly's excellent.

3449
01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:20.733
My friend Billy,

3450
01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:21.573
Billy Guardiola.

3451
01:32:21.610 --> 01:32:22.450
Super Nice Guy.

3452
01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:23.140
Very good dude.

3453
01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:24.130
Crazy funny guy.

3454
01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:24.970
Yeah,

3455
01:32:24.970 --> 01:32:25.690
he's a sweetheart.

3456
01:32:25.690 --> 01:32:26.050
Yeah.

3457
01:32:26.050 --> 01:32:26.800
I love that guy.

3458
01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:27.370
So yeah.

3459
01:32:27.370 --> 01:32:28.203
Um,

3460
01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:29.530
she,

3461
01:32:29.530 --> 01:32:30.580
I think she's very funny,

3462
01:32:30.581 --> 01:32:31.414
but um,

3463
01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:34.930
I didn't see that identity thief movie that she was in because it got such bad

3464
01:32:34.931 --> 01:32:35.764
reviews.

3465
01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:37.031
Oh yeah.

3466
01:32:37.031 --> 01:32:38.890
That looked like ass.

3467
01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:39.340
Yeah.

3468
01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:40.540
But the heat looks okay.

3469
01:32:40.541 --> 01:32:41.374
It looks fun.

3470
01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:42.580
I just haven't seen it yet.

3471
01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:45.940
What were the chick like that like really over the top hilarious.

3472
01:32:46.090 --> 01:32:47.980
Like it's all about finding the right vehicle.

3473
01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:50.380
There's no stuff that many fucking vehicles.

3474
01:32:50.410 --> 01:32:50.561
No,

3475
01:32:50.561 --> 01:32:52.180
that's part of the problem is that they're just,

3476
01:32:52.181 --> 01:32:52.421
you know,

3477
01:32:52.421 --> 01:32:53.580
they're just going to throw,

3478
01:32:53.650 --> 01:32:57.790
she's going to make two or three movies a year and a summer going to be better

3479
01:32:57.791 --> 01:32:58.440
than others.

3480
01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:00.970
This is also when you start making a movie,

3481
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.120
you think it's going to be really good and then halfway and you're like,

3482
01:33:04.330 --> 01:33:04.571
oh,

3483
01:33:04.571 --> 01:33:06.790
this is a wretched piece of shit I'm involved in.

3484
01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:07.320
I mean,

3485
01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:07.960
that can happen.

3486
01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:09.940
Jason Bateman has been in a lot of crappy comedies,

3487
01:33:09.941 --> 01:33:12.160
but there's hardly a funnier comedic actor.

3488
01:33:12.161 --> 01:33:12.730
He just,

3489
01:33:12.730 --> 01:33:13.181
you know,

3490
01:33:13.181 --> 01:33:14.110
he's just got to be in the,

3491
01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:16.300
it's impossible to just be in good ones.

3492
01:33:16.330 --> 01:33:16.511
Yeah.

3493
01:33:16.511 --> 01:33:17.770
That's why it sucks being an actor,

3494
01:33:17.771 --> 01:33:18.150
man.

3495
01:33:18.150 --> 01:33:20.320
You've got to wait around for someone to give you a good role.

3496
01:33:20.321 --> 01:33:20.840
He drew,

3497
01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:22.180
that's a Bateman,

3498
01:33:22.181 --> 01:33:23.050
just switched over to,

3499
01:33:23.051 --> 01:33:24.010
he directed his,

3500
01:33:24.011 --> 01:33:24.550
uh,

3501
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:29.550
most recent movie that's called bad words and I guess people loved it at the

3502
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.020
Toronto Film Festival.

3503
01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:31.930
He's a famous guy and a very successful guy.

3504
01:33:31.931 --> 01:33:32.920
He can do stuff like that,

3505
01:33:32.921 --> 01:33:37.180
but to be irregular actor trying to make it like God damn.

3506
01:33:37.181 --> 01:33:38.014
What a grind.

3507
01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:40.060
It just waiting to get picked up,

3508
01:33:40.061 --> 01:33:41.080
waiting for someone to say,

3509
01:33:41.081 --> 01:33:44.050
you can do it and there's so many and bonds on wiring.

3510
01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:45.880
Here's the real fucking problem.

3511
01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:47.800
It ain't that hard.

3512
01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:50.050
It ain't that fucking hard.

3513
01:33:50.051 --> 01:33:53.380
You can take athletes and they can act and do a really fucking good job.

3514
01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:54.333
How about that?

3515
01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:54.910
How about,

3516
01:33:54.910 --> 01:33:55.300
how about,

3517
01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:55.661
you know,

3518
01:33:55.661 --> 01:33:59.740
people have done acting in a big movie for the first time and kicked ass.

3519
01:33:59.890 --> 01:34:01.390
It's happened several times,

3520
01:34:01.570 --> 01:34:05.470
way more than anyone's ever done that then an actor has ever played in the NBA

3521
01:34:05.471 --> 01:34:06.730
and kick some fucking ass.

3522
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.410
That shit never happened once.

3523
01:34:08.411 --> 01:34:09.850
It's not in the history of the universe,

3524
01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:15.180
but athletes have gone over and acted very successfully and it looks good.

3525
01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:16.300
You know,

3526
01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:16.751
I mean,

3527
01:34:16.751 --> 01:34:18.370
even like pro wrestlers,

3528
01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:19.270
you know,

3529
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:19.570
like,

3530
01:34:19.570 --> 01:34:22.510
like we're talking about Hulk Hogan due to Hong Kong and can act.

3531
01:34:22.511 --> 01:34:22.691
I mean,

3532
01:34:22.691 --> 01:34:24.400
he acts over the top most of the time,

3533
01:34:24.670 --> 01:34:27.490
but if you gave them a role where it was actually acting,

3534
01:34:27.491 --> 01:34:29.230
I bet he could pull it off quite nicely.

3535
01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:31.780
Dice was great in the new Woody Allen movie.

3536
01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:32.860
Nice is not an athlete.

3537
01:34:32.890 --> 01:34:35.860
I don't know where you're going with this because he's a big guy who's like,

3538
01:34:35.861 --> 01:34:36.281
you know,

3539
01:34:36.281 --> 01:34:36.611
I mean,

3540
01:34:36.611 --> 01:34:37.990
I've always thought he was a good actor,

3541
01:34:37.991 --> 01:34:38.700
but he hasn't,

3542
01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:42.460
he obviously hasn't had the greatest acting career and,

3543
01:34:42.461 --> 01:34:42.821
uh,

3544
01:34:42.821 --> 01:34:44.290
I thought he was really good in the movie.

3545
01:34:44.330 --> 01:34:45.280
I heard it was amazing.

3546
01:34:45.281 --> 01:34:47.710
My point was just that not only,

3547
01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:48.851
you know,

3548
01:34:48.851 --> 01:34:52.480
can the individual probably learn pretty easily how to act,

3549
01:34:52.481 --> 01:34:53.440
but also that,

3550
01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:54.120
uh,

3551
01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:57.710
performances could be gotten by a good directors.

3552
01:34:57.740 --> 01:34:58.190
Yes.

3553
01:34:58.190 --> 01:34:58.580
<v 2>Ken,</v>

3554
01:34:58.580 --> 01:34:59.390
you know,

3555
01:34:59.390 --> 01:35:02.630
obviously they have a choice of different takes and different reads and stuff

3556
01:35:02.631 --> 01:35:03.050
and they can,

3557
01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:06.220
they can make somebody that's not that great at its still look pretty good.

3558
01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:07.770
<v 0>That's certainly possible.</v>

3559
01:35:07.771 --> 01:35:09.180
Especially if someone works hard at it,

3560
01:35:09.181 --> 01:35:11.070
which is what a lot of athletes have done.

3561
01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:11.460
You know,

3562
01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:12.810
a lot of athletes work hard,

3563
01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:13.441
you know,

3564
01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:14.270
so you

3565
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:17.990
<v 2>not everybody can give like Daniel Day Lewis performances like he does in</v>

3566
01:35:17.991 --> 01:35:22.991
Lincoln and my left foot because what actors are being are our winning roles

3567
01:35:23.061 --> 01:35:26.720
where they don't look or sound anything like the character they're going to be

3568
01:35:26.721 --> 01:35:29.690
playing there only being cast because of how brilliant they are.

3569
01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:31.730
And everyone knows that they'll get there,

3570
01:35:31.930 --> 01:35:33.140
that they'll make it work.

3571
01:35:33.141 --> 01:35:33.351
You know,

3572
01:35:33.351 --> 01:35:35.300
like him and Sean Penn and a couple of others.

3573
01:35:35.690 --> 01:35:36.523
You know,

3574
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:39.560
lately Al Pachino seems to put it on a different crazy wig for every,

3575
01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:40.221
you know,

3576
01:35:40.221 --> 01:35:42.230
every movie where he's playing a real life person.

3577
01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:42.760
But he,

3578
01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.000
they all act like Pachino,

3579
01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:44.840
you know,

3580
01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:48.980
but it's like a great acting is like the really,

3581
01:35:48.981 --> 01:35:49.970
really great acting.

3582
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.330
Most actors don't get that much opportunity to do that.

3583
01:35:53.331 --> 01:35:56.480
Kind of writing those roles and transforming into something else.

3584
01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:57.960
And there was no one else got to,

3585
01:35:58.550 --> 01:36:01.310
no one got to audition to play a raging bull.

3586
01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:01.911
You know what I mean?

3587
01:36:01.911 --> 01:36:02.450
Dinero said,

3588
01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:03.140
I'll get in the weight,

3589
01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:03.880
let's just do this.

3590
01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:04.540
Right.

3591
01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:05.090
He goes,

3592
01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:08.330
those roles are going to go to someone who's like a huge draw.

3593
01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:09.680
Those roles are going to go,

3594
01:36:09.681 --> 01:36:11.000
the first person is going to get it.

3595
01:36:11.001 --> 01:36:13.310
It's like a Russell Crowe type character or you know,

3596
01:36:13.311 --> 01:36:14.690
reputation is helpful too.

3597
01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:18.650
Like Sam Rockwell works a lot because he's always great even though he's still

3598
01:36:18.651 --> 01:36:19.640
not a household name,

3599
01:36:19.641 --> 01:36:20.210
you know,

3600
01:36:20.210 --> 01:36:20.660
is he,

3601
01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:21.830
he's not a household name.

3602
01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:24.410
BC level household name.

3603
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:24.981
I guess.

3604
01:36:24.981 --> 01:36:25.450
I don't lie.

3605
01:36:25.450 --> 01:36:25.970
I don't like,

3606
01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:27.650
I don't like B c and d very much,

3607
01:36:27.651 --> 01:36:28.420
but uh,

3608
01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:28.981
it is gross.

3609
01:36:28.981 --> 01:36:29.814
I apologize.

3610
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:33.230
But that movie moon that he did was fucking sensational.

3611
01:36:33.410 --> 01:36:34.310
That was really good.

3612
01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:34.910
He's really,

3613
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:35.360
he's,

3614
01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:36.680
he's really a really good,

3615
01:36:36.681 --> 01:36:36.961
accurate,

3616
01:36:36.961 --> 01:36:37.140
but,

3617
01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:37.611
but you know,

3618
01:36:37.611 --> 01:36:40.670
sometimes enough of the chameleon that that makes it hard for not only the

3619
01:36:40.671 --> 01:36:41.720
public to track him,

3620
01:36:41.721 --> 01:36:42.460
but also,

3621
01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:42.740
you know,

3622
01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:44.180
for him to be cast and stuff.

3623
01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:44.931
You know,

3624
01:36:44.931 --> 01:36:45.320
it's like,

3625
01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:45.650
Oh,

3626
01:36:45.650 --> 01:36:46.401
who's that guy?

3627
01:36:46.401 --> 01:36:46.641
You know,

3628
01:36:46.641 --> 01:36:47.060
cause he's,

3629
01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:49.070
he's always so good and so different.

3630
01:36:49.110 --> 01:36:51.570
<v 0>He was so good in that movie moon because it was,</v>

3631
01:36:51.571 --> 01:36:55.200
that was a really subtle role and it was a role where the entire movie was

3632
01:36:55.230 --> 01:36:55.921
basically,

3633
01:36:55.921 --> 01:36:58.200
I don't want to say I should stop myself right there.

3634
01:36:58.230 --> 01:36:59.310
I don't want to say what the entire week,

3635
01:36:59.400 --> 01:36:59.960
go watch it.

3636
01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:00.880
I want to give you a spoiler.

3637
01:37:00.881 --> 01:37:01.260
Yeah.

3638
01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:02.100
But he,

3639
01:37:02.101 --> 01:37:02.934
uh,

3640
01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:04.770
I can't even say what he does in the movie,

3641
01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:05.671
but very,

3642
01:37:05.671 --> 01:37:06.720
very interesting moving,

3643
01:37:06.721 --> 01:37:08.490
very intense and interesting movie.

3644
01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:09.001
And,

3645
01:37:09.001 --> 01:37:09.170
uh,

3646
01:37:09.170 --> 01:37:13.230
she shows his range from that to the iron man character that he does.

3647
01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:13.890
Brian,

3648
01:37:13.890 --> 01:37:14.131
look,

3649
01:37:14.131 --> 01:37:15.510
go to my Twitter and,

3650
01:37:15.511 --> 01:37:15.830
uh,

3651
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:18.900
there's a thing that I retweeted earlier today from,

3652
01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:19.933
uh,

3653
01:37:19.950 --> 01:37:20.783
uh,

3654
01:37:21.210 --> 01:37:23.280
Dan Carlin hardcore history guy.

3655
01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:24.271
He,

3656
01:37:24.271 --> 01:37:24.600
uh,

3657
01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:29.600
put up a trailer of a Gingiss Khan and the Mongols from like the John Wayne era.

3658
01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:34.830
They did a movie [inaudible] con.

3659
01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:36.660
It's so bad.

3660
01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:37.321
Oh my God.

3661
01:37:37.321 --> 01:37:38.070
It's brilliant.

3662
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.581
It's a,

3663
01:37:38.581 --> 01:37:40.200
if you go to my Twitter is the third one down.

3664
01:37:40.890 --> 01:37:41.400
You got it.

3665
01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:42.060
Look at this.

3666
01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:44.140
Crank this up so you could hear this way too.

3667
01:37:44.141 --> 01:37:45.920
You hear John Wayne as Gaviscon.

3668
01:37:46.290 --> 01:37:48.060
First of all getting is kind of was fucking Chinese.

3669
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:48.940
All right.

3670
01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:49.630
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

3671
01:37:49.630 --> 01:37:51.440
Look at this forever counselor.

3672
01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:52.221
Right?

3673
01:37:52.221 --> 01:37:52.780
The car.

3674
01:37:52.780 --> 01:37:53.650
That's the great con.

3675
01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:54.513
John Wayne.

3676
01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:55.980
Listen to him is getting

3677
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:58.150
<v 8>his con slaves.</v>

3678
01:37:58.170 --> 01:37:59.080
You have this,

3679
01:37:59.330 --> 01:38:00.510
it looks so fake.

3680
01:38:00.511 --> 01:38:00.740
I,

3681
01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:01.650
but otherwise me.

3682
01:38:02.250 --> 01:38:02.860
Listen to me.

3683
01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:04.240
There are moments for wisdom,

3684
01:38:04.241 --> 01:38:04.771
Gym Yoga.

3685
01:38:04.771 --> 01:38:07.800
Then I listened to you and there are moments for action.

3686
01:38:07.801 --> 01:38:08.970
Then I listened to my blood.

3687
01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.370
I feel less tired or a woman is from me.

3688
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:13.310
He sounds the same.

3689
01:38:13.311 --> 01:38:14.640
Like is he doesn't every other movie

3690
01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:17.610
taking you for a wipe board.

3691
01:38:17.611 --> 01:38:21.030
Ty and I take your dowry tomorrow at Heart Gut.

3692
01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:22.290
I make gift of it.

3693
01:38:22.291 --> 01:38:23.220
Dwayne con,

3694
01:38:24.510 --> 01:38:28.080
he doesn't believe he's saying Dwayne con city.

3695
01:38:30.050 --> 01:38:32.690
I keep of all my balls.

3696
01:38:39.790 --> 01:38:40.240
<v 9>Oh,</v>

3697
01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:41.840
hug me shall be this dry

3698
01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:47.653
treachery.

3699
01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:50.260
People are so dumb.

3700
01:38:50.261 --> 01:38:52.690
Back then he was that big of a bad ass.

3701
01:38:52.750 --> 01:38:53.250
Awesome.

3702
01:38:53.250 --> 01:38:53.590
You know?

3703
01:38:53.590 --> 01:38:55.200
But somebody made a new trailer forward.

3704
01:38:55.210 --> 01:38:56.043
Is that what this is?

3705
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:57.833
Yeah.

3706
01:38:59.340 --> 01:38:59.590
Yeah.

3707
01:38:59.590 --> 01:39:00.880
They didn't have trailers back then,

3708
01:39:00.881 --> 01:39:01.714
did they?

3709
01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:02.471
They did,

3710
01:39:02.471 --> 01:39:03.830
but they weren't this,

3711
01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:06.460
whoever did this is a bad motherfucker.

3712
01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:07.360
I don't think they said that.

3713
01:39:07.690 --> 01:39:09.150
The day and date on them like that.

3714
01:39:13.150 --> 01:39:14.590
<v 1>It almost makes me want to go wash this.</v>

3715
01:39:15.670 --> 01:39:16.180
You know what?

3716
01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:18.910
Maybe we can get a resurgence from this movie,

3717
01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:22.600
but playing this and then it could be like the rocky horror picture show of,

3718
01:39:22.601 --> 01:39:22.960
of,

3719
01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:24.880
of barbaric dramas.

3720
01:39:25.650 --> 01:39:29.830
Everybody could go to it and quote the words that John Wayne says as Ganga is

3721
01:39:29.831 --> 01:39:30.370
con,

3722
01:39:30.370 --> 01:39:30.881
do you think,

3723
01:39:30.881 --> 01:39:32.010
do you really think that they,

3724
01:39:32.130 --> 01:39:35.650
they let him do that voice because he was that big of a bad ass.

3725
01:39:35.651 --> 01:39:36.850
They thought if he was to be like,

3726
01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:37.181
aw,

3727
01:39:37.181 --> 01:39:38.650
y'all and stuff like that,

3728
01:39:38.651 --> 01:39:39.484
they would,

3729
01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:46.630
it's always funny in any movies where it's like a,

3730
01:39:46.631 --> 01:39:47.111
you know,

3731
01:39:47.111 --> 01:39:50.710
English or American actors playing for in a foreign roles.

3732
01:39:50.711 --> 01:39:51.161
Is that,

3733
01:39:51.161 --> 01:39:51.994
uh,

3734
01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:52.541
you know,

3735
01:39:52.541 --> 01:39:52.790
why,

3736
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:53.960
why would you have a,

3737
01:39:54.490 --> 01:39:54.830
uh,

3738
01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:55.750
an accent,

3739
01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:57.060
but speaking English,

3740
01:39:57.530 --> 01:39:58.363
you know,

3741
01:39:58.420 --> 01:39:59.380
so they just go,

3742
01:39:59.381 --> 01:40:00.310
they just say fuck it.

3743
01:40:00.311 --> 01:40:01.240
And they just have him,

3744
01:40:01.690 --> 01:40:01.991
you know,

3745
01:40:01.991 --> 01:40:04.240
not having actual accent and speaking English.

3746
01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:06.250
It's like Tom Cruise and Valkyrie,

3747
01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:08.680
Kevin Costner and Robin Hood,

3748
01:40:08.681 --> 01:40:09.520
Prince of Thieves.

3749
01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:10.990
Sometimes they're just like,

3750
01:40:11.050 --> 01:40:11.161
hey,

3751
01:40:11.161 --> 01:40:11.861
he's a big star.

3752
01:40:11.861 --> 01:40:12.430
Fuck it.

3753
01:40:12.430 --> 01:40:13.900
He'll just talking his voice.

3754
01:40:14.140 --> 01:40:15.340
He'll just talk how he talks.

3755
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:18.400
I'd rather him do that then actually try to fake it,

3756
01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:19.353
you know?

3757
01:40:19.810 --> 01:40:20.021
Yeah.

3758
01:40:20.021 --> 01:40:20.560
I just don't,

3759
01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:20.831
I don't,

3760
01:40:20.831 --> 01:40:21.780
I wouldn't see the point y'all,

3761
01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:24.730
the only thing maybe you should do is let you know,

3762
01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:27.160
say it in the actual language and then they have subtitles,

3763
01:40:27.161 --> 01:40:28.000
but that's like,

3764
01:40:28.001 --> 01:40:28.834
you know,

3765
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:31.300
there's only so many actors that could pull that shit off.

3766
01:40:32.050 --> 01:40:34.690
Like I was watching a movie called,

3767
01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:36.340
what was it called,

3768
01:40:36.341 --> 01:40:37.174
French kiss

3769
01:40:38.770 --> 01:40:39.603
French something.

3770
01:40:39.730 --> 01:40:41.590
It was Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan.

3771
01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:45.490
But Kevin Kline was French in it and he speaks French a lot in it,

3772
01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:46.181
you know,

3773
01:40:46.181 --> 01:40:46.700
and uh,

3774
01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:48.250
he clearly just knows French,

3775
01:40:48.490 --> 01:40:49.323
but it was still,

3776
01:40:49.450 --> 01:40:50.320
I was impressed.

3777
01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:52.570
I watched a sneakers last night.

3778
01:40:52.571 --> 01:40:53.404
Again,

3779
01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:54.730
I haven't seen that in forever.

3780
01:40:54.731 --> 01:40:56.700
Does that hold up such a good movie still?

3781
01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:57.260
Yeah.

3782
01:40:57.260 --> 01:40:58.150
I highly recommend,

3783
01:40:58.160 --> 01:40:59.210
highly recommend watching that.

3784
01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:00.520
It's Robert Redford,

3785
01:41:00.521 --> 01:41:01.450
Dan Akroyd.

3786
01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:02.390
<v 10>Uh,</v>

3787
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:04.350
that one dude from a,

3788
01:41:05.710 --> 01:41:08.690
<v 1>there's like a team of five and they're all like hackers.</v>

3789
01:41:08.710 --> 01:41:09.543
Yeah.

3790
01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:10.693
<v 10>Such a good movie.</v>

3791
01:41:10.990 --> 01:41:12.670
I'll tell you who it was all in it right now.

3792
01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:15.720
<v 1>The fifth state movies coming out.</v>

3793
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:16.640
Speaking of hackers,

3794
01:41:16.850 --> 01:41:17.060
I,

3795
01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:17.361
you know,

3796
01:41:17.361 --> 01:41:19.750
that guy really looks and sounds like Julian Assange,

3797
01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:22.400
but I hear the movie as a kind of muddled,

3798
01:41:22.401 --> 01:41:24.230
like they don't do a good job telling the story.

3799
01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:25.640
Robert Redford,

3800
01:41:25.670 --> 01:41:28.100
Dan Akroyd a river Phoenix.

3801
01:41:28.130 --> 01:41:30.290
That's what's it called again?

3802
01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:31.430
Sneakers.

3803
01:41:31.890 --> 01:41:32.661
Such a good movie.

3804
01:41:32.661 --> 01:41:34.120
I watched it last about hackers,

3805
01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:34.520
right?

3806
01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:35.121
Where the other two,

3807
01:41:35.121 --> 01:41:35.954
I think it was like 15,

3808
01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:39.830
Sydney Portiere da Da da.

3809
01:41:39.831 --> 01:41:41.720
You fucking barbarian.

3810
01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:43.220
You don't know.

3811
01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:47.420
He was like the first like super acceptable black guy or a girl in a team or an

3812
01:41:47.450 --> 01:41:48.500
or a super nerd.

3813
01:41:48.650 --> 01:41:49.790
He talked like a European,

3814
01:41:49.791 --> 01:41:50.624
right?

3815
01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:51.771
Yeah.

3816
01:41:51.771 --> 01:41:53.240
He was pretty a fancy,

3817
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:54.103
super elegant,

3818
01:41:54.710 --> 01:41:55.543
super eloquent.

3819
01:41:56.190 --> 01:41:56.680
Uh,

3820
01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:57.501
Joe or like,

3821
01:41:57.501 --> 01:41:59.180
if you think back like the old days,

3822
01:41:59.181 --> 01:42:00.200
like the sixties and seventies,

3823
01:42:00.201 --> 01:42:02.120
who is the most elegant black guy?

3824
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:04.010
They called me Mr Tibbs.

3825
01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:04.873
Cindy pulled.

3826
01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:05.620
Yeah.

3827
01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:06.291
He was very,

3828
01:42:06.291 --> 01:42:06.680
uh,

3829
01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:07.760
always annunciated.

3830
01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:09.020
Yeah.

3831
01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:09.770
And that's how they,

3832
01:42:09.770 --> 01:42:10.071
you know,

3833
01:42:10.071 --> 01:42:10.671
the east,

3834
01:42:10.671 --> 01:42:11.090
uh,

3835
01:42:11.090 --> 01:42:11.631
you know,

3836
01:42:11.631 --> 01:42:12.320
the,

3837
01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:13.160
all the white folks,

3838
01:42:13.161 --> 01:42:14.360
they kind of ease them in with like,

3839
01:42:14.361 --> 01:42:15.410
guess who's coming to dinner.

3840
01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:19.670
Got like a whole movie about a white family that doesn't like a black dude

3841
01:42:19.671 --> 01:42:20.504
coming to dinner.

3842
01:42:20.570 --> 01:42:21.403
Exact Donal.

3843
01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:21.950
Who?

3844
01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:22.783
Mary MacDonald.

3845
01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:23.421
Oh yeah,

3846
01:42:23.421 --> 01:42:23.840
that's her name.

3847
01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:26.270
So maybe she didn't go on the mission though or whatever.

3848
01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:30.630
Don't they go on like a don't they have to get in somewhere and Sydney 40,

3849
01:42:30.730 --> 01:42:34.580
there's a van they ride around in a van a little bit accepting an honorary

3850
01:42:34.581 --> 01:42:35.414
Oscar.

3851
01:42:35.630 --> 01:42:37.800
Denzel Washington brings up Sydney port ea.

3852
01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:39.110
So that was,

3853
01:42:39.110 --> 01:42:40.340
that was probably in the last year or two,

3854
01:42:40.341 --> 01:42:41.020
right.

3855
01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:41.660
Um,

3856
01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:44.390
since 2008 the five years,

3857
01:42:44.650 --> 01:42:47.780
it says the 74th annual Academy Awards.

3858
01:42:48.130 --> 01:42:49.250
That's sane.

3859
01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:51.530
There's been 74 academy awards.

3860
01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:54.520
Isn't it funny how much they loved Patty chest?

3861
01:42:55.450 --> 01:42:58.520
Does that sound like you were trying to interrupt Joe?

3862
01:42:59.570 --> 01:43:01.320
You should save that as a drop.

3863
01:43:01.670 --> 01:43:03.970
One of those corny morning zoos do,

3864
01:43:03.971 --> 01:43:04.101
do,

3865
01:43:04.101 --> 01:43:04.251
do,

3866
01:43:04.251 --> 01:43:04.431
do,

3867
01:43:04.431 --> 01:43:04.970
do.

3868
01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:05.540
Um,

3869
01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:08.030
what the fuck was I saying something about how the Academy Awards,

3870
01:43:08.031 --> 01:43:09.210
who goes about them?

3871
01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:09.440
How,

3872
01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:10.550
why has there been so many?

3873
01:43:10.551 --> 01:43:14.750
It's just amazing how much back patting their is that they have these gigantic

3874
01:43:14.780 --> 01:43:16.910
elegant award shows for essentially entertainment.

3875
01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:17.840
You know what I mean?

3876
01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:19.580
It's really cool that you do this.

3877
01:43:19.581 --> 01:43:21.920
It's really cool that you provide us with his awesome entertainment.

3878
01:43:22.250 --> 01:43:25.370
But the amount of fanfare that goes into that,

3879
01:43:25.371 --> 01:43:26.960
like here's a perfect example.

3880
01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:28.400
The guy who,

3881
01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:28.680
the,

3882
01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:28.901
the,

3883
01:43:28.901 --> 01:43:30.900
the guys who were working on the,

3884
01:43:30.901 --> 01:43:34.100
the Higgs Boston trying to find the God particle,

3885
01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:34.600
they're,

3886
01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:36.740
they're getting a Nobel prize,

3887
01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:37.551
you know,

3888
01:43:37.551 --> 01:43:38.880
and who,

3889
01:43:38.950 --> 01:43:40.040
who fucking knows that?

3890
01:43:41.210 --> 01:43:41.541
I mean,

3891
01:43:41.541 --> 01:43:43.880
everybody knows when the academy awards are out,

3892
01:43:44.030 --> 01:43:47.000
everybody knows that there's a red carpet and the lights are going off.

3893
01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:48.230
That the scientists,

3894
01:43:48.231 --> 01:43:48.501
if,

3895
01:43:48.501 --> 01:43:48.980
uh,

3896
01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:51.740
these guys who won the Nobel prize physics,

3897
01:43:51.741 --> 01:43:51.980
three

3898
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:52.660
<v 5>of them,</v>

3899
01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:52.880
the,

3900
01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.350
if these guys were walking down the street,

3901
01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:55.280
no one gives a flying.

3902
01:43:55.281 --> 01:43:56.040
Fuck,

3903
01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:56.420
no,

3904
01:43:56.420 --> 01:43:57.950
no one's gonna take photos of them.

3905
01:43:58.130 --> 01:44:02.300
They might be more responsible for changing the way we perceive the universe in

3906
01:44:02.301 --> 01:44:04.040
any scientist who ever existed.

3907
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:07.970
And they could just walk freely down the street and no one gives a shit.

3908
01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:12.890
But if you know there's a red carpet and some person who was in the awesome

3909
01:44:12.891 --> 01:44:17.150
pretender of stars and nothing wrong with them being an awesome pretender,

3910
01:44:17.151 --> 01:44:18.170
but as they walk through,

3911
01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:19.940
I mean it's really weird.

3912
01:44:19.941 --> 01:44:20.774
We're weird.

3913
01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:24.620
Weird is finding a full people to mostly the winners are often very attractive.

3914
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:26.000
Not these winters,

3915
01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:27.213
these Oscars.

3916
01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:27.561
No,

3917
01:44:27.561 --> 01:44:28.041
the other ones,

3918
01:44:28.041 --> 01:44:28.874
the Nobel prize.

3919
01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:34.010
That's why more people look at the Oscars is the attractive to look at of these

3920
01:44:34.011 --> 01:44:35.090
doctors need that date,

3921
01:44:35.091 --> 01:44:36.440
like a low hand or something like that.

3922
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:37.760
It's the symmetry of the face.

3923
01:44:37.761 --> 01:44:39.020
Symmetry guarantee you.

3924
01:44:39.021 --> 01:44:41.480
There's probably some pimp ass man,

3925
01:44:42.010 --> 01:44:45.800
like man scientists out there that's looking to get himself a movie star wife

3926
01:44:45.801 --> 01:44:47.240
like that might be like a good move.

3927
01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:49.610
Like a Neil degrasse Tyson type character.

3928
01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:51.800
He could nail himself like if he wasn't married,

3929
01:44:51.801 --> 01:44:52.580
I don't know if he knows,

3930
01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:53.330
but if he wasn't,

3931
01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:54.800
let's just an alternative universe,

3932
01:44:54.801 --> 01:44:57.810
the very least he could get like a Padma Lakshmi who?

3933
01:44:57.860 --> 01:45:01.640
That girl that's married to a Saulman rusty.

3934
01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:03.500
I don't know who she is,

3935
01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:04.550
but you know who he is?

3936
01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:04.990
Yes.

3937
01:45:04.990 --> 01:45:05.310
Yeah,

3938
01:45:05.310 --> 01:45:06.143
she had actually,

3939
01:45:06.330 --> 01:45:10.820
he had to go into hiding for a while because of this say tannic versus and a and

3940
01:45:10.821 --> 01:45:13.250
she's just a host of top chef.

3941
01:45:13.710 --> 01:45:14.090
Oh really?

3942
01:45:14.090 --> 01:45:15.110
And she's gorgeous.

3943
01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:16.120
Whoa.

3944
01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:16.580
Yeah.

3945
01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:17.300
That's interesting.

3946
01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:17.481
Yeah.

3947
01:45:17.481 --> 01:45:17.771
And that's,

3948
01:45:17.771 --> 01:45:18.541
so she's married too.

3949
01:45:18.541 --> 01:45:20.590
Cause like that's your point was that there's,

3950
01:45:20.980 --> 01:45:21.340
there's,

3951
01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:21.610
you know,

3952
01:45:21.610 --> 01:45:23.270
these hot chicks out there that are really,

3953
01:45:23.271 --> 01:45:23.541
really,

3954
01:45:23.541 --> 01:45:28.541
really smart dude with a lot of notoriety for being smart could actually scooped

3955
01:45:28.811 --> 01:45:29.180
him up.

3956
01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:29.481
Yeah.

3957
01:45:29.481 --> 01:45:31.250
It makes a girl look like a bad ass bitch.

3958
01:45:31.850 --> 01:45:35.810
She's hanging some movie stars hanging around some superstar astrophysicist guy

3959
01:45:36.290 --> 01:45:38.510
who's creating fucking laser beams and shit.

3960
01:45:38.511 --> 01:45:40.190
Did you see the rail gun that day developed?

3961
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:41.060
Uh,

3962
01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:42.800
Holy Shit.

3963
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:45.470
You want to see the next level of warfare weapons?

3964
01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:50.360
There's a fucking thing that I developed that it shoots through this solid wall

3965
01:45:50.361 --> 01:45:55.010
of steel punches a hole through and go straight in a straight line after that

3966
01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:56.510
seven kilometers.

3967
01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:57.710
Wow.

3968
01:45:57.710 --> 01:45:58.260
Yeah.

3969
01:45:58.260 --> 01:45:59.150
Who pull this up,

3970
01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:00.590
rail gun invented.

3971
01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:01.640
Watch this demo.

3972
01:46:01.641 --> 01:46:03.570
This is going to make you shit your pants.

3973
01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:04.370
Is it recently?

3974
01:46:04.370 --> 01:46:06.050
Because there's the one from 2007.

3975
01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:06.231
Oh,

3976
01:46:06.231 --> 01:46:06.771
it's recent.

3977
01:46:06.771 --> 01:46:06.981
Here.

3978
01:46:06.981 --> 01:46:07.814
Let me find it.

3979
01:46:08.150 --> 01:46:10.120
Real gun invented.

3980
01:46:10.150 --> 01:46:10.331
It's,

3981
01:46:10.331 --> 01:46:11.450
it's incredible.

3982
01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:13.430
I mean it really is like,

3983
01:46:13.610 --> 01:46:14.443
and they show up.

3984
01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:17.690
They have a village of it's shooting through a wall.

3985
01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:20.360
Will they showed they started it with bricks.

3986
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:21.230
Um,

3987
01:46:21.230 --> 01:46:21.621
they were,

3988
01:46:21.621 --> 01:46:22.730
they were shooting bricks.

3989
01:46:22.731 --> 01:46:25.700
Like they would just load up a brick and fucking punch through this fucking

3990
01:46:25.701 --> 01:46:25.970
thing.

3991
01:46:25.970 --> 01:46:27.470
I'm not going to feel safe in here now.

3992
01:46:27.471 --> 01:46:28.370
And then they,

3993
01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:29.333
um,

3994
01:46:29.890 --> 01:46:34.890
and then they decided at general atomics rail gun test 2013 but Google that they

3995
01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:41.070
develop this alloy bullet that's this giant metal piece that's aerodynamic and

3996
01:46:42.081 --> 01:46:44.240
it breaks off sort of like a stage rocket,

3997
01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:44.811
I guess.

3998
01:46:44.811 --> 01:46:45.261
They shoot it,

3999
01:46:45.261 --> 01:46:46.130
parts break off.

4000
01:46:46.131 --> 01:46:47.990
And then there's the aerodynamic end of it,

4001
01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:49.010
which is like a little,

4002
01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:50.041
a speaker,

4003
01:46:50.041 --> 01:46:51.120
like a little like,

4004
01:46:51.121 --> 01:46:53.040
it's like a giant bullet is what it looks like.

4005
01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:56.010
And it just punches right through this fucking steel wall.

4006
01:46:56.250 --> 01:46:57.031
Check this shit out.

4007
01:46:57.031 --> 01:46:58.640
It's like the other parts of this pill,

4008
01:46:58.650 --> 01:47:01.290
it so fast that when they jettison it does,

4009
01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:05.860
<v 11>you don't walk five blocks six and after they tell that's a brick,</v>

4010
01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:06.750
not that impressive.

4011
01:47:07.170 --> 01:47:08.130
So we came with the kit.

4012
01:47:08.131 --> 01:47:11.550
We basically came with an aerodynamic ground and that that's the next round of

4013
01:47:11.551 --> 01:47:12.384
testing that we did.

4014
01:47:12.690 --> 01:47:13.770
We did that this summer.

4015
01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:14.701
This was around,

4016
01:47:14.701 --> 01:47:16.140
it was actually developed by bowling,

4017
01:47:16.141 --> 01:47:18.150
what they'd done to support this program.

4018
01:47:18.330 --> 01:47:22.350
What do you see here is the armature that use to generate the force and the,

4019
01:47:22.351 --> 01:47:23.184
and the round.

4020
01:47:23.310 --> 01:47:24.210
So with that there's a,

4021
01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:24.720
there's a,

4022
01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:24.770
uh,

4023
01:47:24.770 --> 01:47:27.330
hundreds of thousands of pounds pushing around down the bore.

4024
01:47:28.050 --> 01:47:29.580
And then once it gets out the Bor,

4025
01:47:30.090 --> 01:47:30.960
then uh,

4026
01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:36.020
air hits the Sibo and causes the suburb to separate.

4027
01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:39.780
And then this was the round that we launched down range.

4028
01:47:40.350 --> 01:47:40.810
And,

4029
01:47:40.810 --> 01:47:41.250
um,

4030
01:47:41.250 --> 01:47:43.830
we launched this particular round at 1600 meters a second,

4031
01:47:43.831 --> 01:47:47.420
which is about mach five and it with no gun elevation meetings,

4032
01:47:47.421 --> 01:47:48.630
zero degrees elevation.

4033
01:47:48.970 --> 01:47:49.560
Uh,

4034
01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:53.160
this thing went seven kilometers down range before it stopped and that's after

4035
01:47:53.161 --> 01:47:55.560
punching through a steel plate about an eighth inch thick,

4036
01:47:55.561 --> 01:47:56.670
a hundred yards down range.

4037
01:47:56.830 --> 01:48:01.180
<v 5>But look at how it just keeps going after going through that steel plate in</v>

4038
01:48:01.181 --> 01:48:02.110
eight inch thick

4039
01:48:02.180 --> 01:48:03.013
<v 11>different options</v>

4040
01:48:03.110 --> 01:48:05.330
<v 5>and it goes through it like it doesn't even exist</v>

4041
01:48:05.630 --> 01:48:06.463
<v 11>say in the navy,</v>

4042
01:48:07.150 --> 01:48:12.150
<v 5>look like it slowed it down and go seven kilometers past that Oh nutty.</v>

4043
01:48:12.501 --> 01:48:13.670
Or people were like,

4044
01:48:13.671 --> 01:48:17.510
when it's not good enough at killing people yet we're missing something.

4045
01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:19.670
Do you think that guy in that video gets laid a lot?

4046
01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:20.871
He's in key shows.

4047
01:48:20.871 --> 01:48:21.704
Girls that video,

4048
01:48:21.710 --> 01:48:23.660
I think when the camera was up waste above,

4049
01:48:23.661 --> 01:48:26.530
it's cause someone was talking this deck that he would think he demands that it

4050
01:48:26.531 --> 01:48:29.120
demands that at all times where he sends a rail gun through your fucking house

4051
01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:29.330
thing,

4052
01:48:29.330 --> 01:48:30.081
looked when he wants,

4053
01:48:30.081 --> 01:48:31.010
he pulled all the parts off.

4054
01:48:31.011 --> 01:48:32.210
It looked like a dick dude.

4055
01:48:32.211 --> 01:48:33.350
That thing looked like death.

4056
01:48:33.530 --> 01:48:33.861
That's,

4057
01:48:33.861 --> 01:48:34.910
it was a death dick.

4058
01:48:35.090 --> 01:48:38.480
It's incredible that we were not satisfied with our ability to blow shit up.

4059
01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:43.510
Like we're constantly inventing new and terrifying ways to shoot through walls.

4060
01:48:43.671 --> 01:48:48.110
I want to see a villain get killed by that thing in a bond movie.

4061
01:48:48.890 --> 01:48:53.870
Did you see the video of the Serbian rebels getting hit with a missile?

4062
01:48:54.230 --> 01:48:55.040
Uh,

4063
01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:55.873
no.

4064
01:48:56.300 --> 01:48:56.960
Well it's not,

4065
01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:00.680
not super gory but it's got to be brutal.

4066
01:49:00.710 --> 01:49:01.760
Insanely shocking.

4067
01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:05.300
This guy's in a window and he's looking out the window and there's these guys in

4068
01:49:05.301 --> 01:49:08.890
a truck and they're driving the truck up the street and the truck has like armor

4069
01:49:08.910 --> 01:49:09.451
man on it.

4070
01:49:09.451 --> 01:49:11.840
It has guns on it and these guys are standing in the middle of the street and

4071
01:49:11.841 --> 01:49:13.190
the guy drives a truck off.

4072
01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:15.290
And I guess when he was driving the truck off,

4073
01:49:15.291 --> 01:49:18.770
the missile was already common as the people that were standing where the truck

4074
01:49:18.771 --> 01:49:19.310
were.

4075
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:22.460
All of a sudden you see them like go fuck and try to run.

4076
01:49:22.461 --> 01:49:26.360
They get like a couple of steps and this fucking thing hits the ground and it's

4077
01:49:26.361 --> 01:49:28.220
a huge ball of fire.

4078
01:49:28.490 --> 01:49:29.900
This insane explosion.

4079
01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:32.270
Everything goes flying by and then you hear like,

4080
01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:33.670
oh blah blah blah,

4081
01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:34.191
hello,

4082
01:49:34.191 --> 01:49:35.024
walk blah.

4083
01:49:35.090 --> 01:49:35.690
You know,

4084
01:49:35.690 --> 01:49:36.411
that's like what?

4085
01:49:36.411 --> 01:49:37.580
They'll say God is great,

4086
01:49:37.581 --> 01:49:39.710
God is great when the shit goes wrong,

4087
01:49:39.711 --> 01:49:40.010
they were like,

4088
01:49:40.010 --> 01:49:41.090
it's like holy fuck.

4089
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:43.310
That's like God Damn Jesus Christ,

4090
01:49:43.311 --> 01:49:44.150
Jesus Christ.

4091
01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:47.920
And so you look out the window and it's just fucking shoot crater.

4092
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:52.510
This fucking gigantic missile just slammed down the middle of the street and you

4093
01:49:52.511 --> 01:49:55.840
get a sense of how fast it would hit you.

4094
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:57.100
Like when you're on the ground,

4095
01:49:57.101 --> 01:49:58.090
you don't know it's common.

4096
01:49:58.210 --> 01:50:01.930
And then these guys just looked up to like shit and it was too late.

4097
01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:04.360
Well launching,

4098
01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:05.193
no thing.

4099
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.660
Yeah,

4100
01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:07.921
we're,

4101
01:50:07.921 --> 01:50:09.370
we're really good at blowing people up.

4102
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:11.020
I say we as in you and I,

4103
01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:11.340
Joe,

4104
01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:14.410
did you see that picture that somebody sent me and you on Twitter of his

4105
01:50:14.411 --> 01:50:15.400
emotional needs?

4106
01:50:15.401 --> 01:50:17.380
Pit Bull that he brings on planes.

4107
01:50:17.390 --> 01:50:17.540
Oh,

4108
01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:18.340
come on.

4109
01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:18.910
No Way.

4110
01:50:18.910 --> 01:50:19.121
Yeah.

4111
01:50:19.121 --> 01:50:22.860
Look at this guy brings you the emotional needs pit bull on planes.

4112
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:24.580
That is so crazy.

4113
01:50:25.390 --> 01:50:26.440
That's so crazy.

4114
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:27.303
Ivan tipples.

4115
01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:28.630
That's so crazy.

4116
01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:29.890
Wow.

4117
01:50:29.890 --> 01:50:31.030
Well you know what?

4118
01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:35.720
It's nice that your dogs nice and you love them today they're making here in Los

4119
01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:35.721
Angeles.

4120
01:50:35.721 --> 01:50:37.300
So they're making it a law.

4121
01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:39.640
I think a or they're voting on the law,

4122
01:50:39.641 --> 01:50:44.641
but I think it's gonna pass a that you have to get your pitbull spayed and

4123
01:50:44.651 --> 01:50:45.460
neutered,

4124
01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:45.820
uh,

4125
01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:47.290
after the age of four months.

4126
01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:48.370
Oh yeah.

4127
01:50:48.370 --> 01:50:49.001
That's crazy.

4128
01:50:49.001 --> 01:50:49.121
Yeah,

4129
01:50:49.121 --> 01:50:50.260
because I guess we're just,

4130
01:50:50.290 --> 01:50:53.260
there's so many pit bulls here that they're just killing like piles of them a

4131
01:50:53.261 --> 01:50:53.620
day,

4132
01:50:53.620 --> 01:50:53.801
you know,

4133
01:50:53.801 --> 01:50:54.850
at the pounds and stuff.

4134
01:50:54.910 --> 01:50:55.691
That's crazy though,

4135
01:50:55.691 --> 01:50:57.000
that you can force someone to get their,

4136
01:50:57.010 --> 01:50:57.791
their dog spayed.

4137
01:50:57.791 --> 01:50:59.020
Like what if you're breeding dogs?

4138
01:50:59.021 --> 01:51:01.690
What if you were responsible dog breeder that breeds dogs and just saying,

4139
01:51:01.691 --> 01:51:02.070
you know,

4140
01:51:02.070 --> 01:51:05.230
they get a special license or some probably get wondering license.

4141
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:08.230
I think just this probably just for private ownership of a pimple.

4142
01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:08.530
Yeah,

4143
01:51:08.530 --> 01:51:09.130
maybe.

4144
01:51:09.130 --> 01:51:11.350
It's interesting because it changes the personality of the dog.

4145
01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:12.430
You know,

4146
01:51:12.430 --> 01:51:13.241
have you mailed dogs?

4147
01:51:13.241 --> 01:51:16.000
It makes them a more sedate and make some,

4148
01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:16.900
they get there,

4149
01:51:16.901 --> 01:51:19.690
they're tired or they lose like a lot of their energy.

4150
01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:20.441
Enthusiasm.

4151
01:51:20.441 --> 01:51:22.870
I noticed a big difference when my dog got got fixed.

4152
01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:24.310
It's like older dudes on,

4153
01:51:24.311 --> 01:51:25.420
you know that have low t.

4154
01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:26.950
Exactly.

4155
01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:29.620
I mean certainly it's probably a calmer dog,

4156
01:51:30.250 --> 01:51:30.970
but um,

4157
01:51:30.970 --> 01:51:34.950
my veterinarian that I went to for years before he passed away,

4158
01:51:35.020 --> 01:51:37.120
never believed in Spang male dogs.

4159
01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:40.480
He didn't believe in having them breed and create puppies.

4160
01:51:40.630 --> 01:51:40.841
You know,

4161
01:51:40.841 --> 01:51:41.730
you don't take care of.

4162
01:51:41.731 --> 01:51:42.101
It's like,

4163
01:51:42.101 --> 01:51:42.610
you know,

4164
01:51:42.610 --> 01:51:44.080
you're with your dog all the time.

4165
01:51:44.081 --> 01:51:45.370
If you're a responsible dog owner,

4166
01:51:45.371 --> 01:51:46.660
you know that your dog's not going to breed.

4167
01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:49.900
He's like that sad like unless you dog as a real aggressive problem,

4168
01:51:50.260 --> 01:51:51.520
you don't need to spam.

4169
01:51:51.730 --> 01:51:51.971
And then,

4170
01:51:51.971 --> 01:51:52.960
but then other people have said,

4171
01:51:52.961 --> 01:51:56.680
yes you do because otherwise your dog can get testicular cancer.

4172
01:51:57.100 --> 01:51:59.050
And my take on that has always been like,

4173
01:51:59.360 --> 01:51:59.620
okay,

4174
01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:02.680
so they can't get testicular cancer if you cut off their testicles.

4175
01:52:02.910 --> 01:52:03.071
Like,

4176
01:52:03.071 --> 01:52:03.790
is that your,

4177
01:52:03.790 --> 01:52:04.451
are you really,

4178
01:52:04.451 --> 01:52:05.680
is that really what's going on here?

4179
01:52:06.070 --> 01:52:06.280
Like,

4180
01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:06.730
why is it,

4181
01:52:06.730 --> 01:52:07.950
why are the dogs getting cancer?

4182
01:52:07.970 --> 01:52:08.561
Their balls?

4183
01:52:08.561 --> 01:52:10.000
Like is there a way to avoid that?

4184
01:52:10.001 --> 01:52:12.340
Just check for lumps on the dog's balls once a week.

4185
01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:16.270
That's already doing stuff around there.

4186
01:52:16.270 --> 01:52:16.661
Anyway,

4187
01:52:16.661 --> 01:52:17.494
so excited.

4188
01:52:17.850 --> 01:52:18.683
He's so excited.

4189
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:19.420
Oh No.

4190
01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:21.520
We've even discussed about this on the podcast.

4191
01:52:21.521 --> 01:52:21.611
Why?

4192
01:52:21.611 --> 01:52:25.540
This is a concerted effort on my part to eliminate why does your dog run away

4193
01:52:25.541 --> 01:52:26.560
from you every Wednesday?

4194
01:52:26.610 --> 01:52:27.071
Oh No,

4195
01:52:27.071 --> 01:52:27.251
no,

4196
01:52:27.251 --> 01:52:27.431
no,

4197
01:52:27.431 --> 01:52:27.611
no,

4198
01:52:27.611 --> 01:52:28.444
not Wednesday.

4199
01:52:28.990 --> 01:52:33.990
But I can understand the girl thing now getting girls spade because you don't

4200
01:52:34.631 --> 01:52:36.400
want them to have periods all over the place.

4201
01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:36.641
Well,

4202
01:52:36.641 --> 01:52:37.400
it's also that,

4203
01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:37.691
you know,

4204
01:52:37.691 --> 01:52:37.871
they,

4205
01:52:37.871 --> 01:52:40.180
they go into heat and then that attracts dogs.

4206
01:52:40.181 --> 01:52:40.870
And I,

4207
01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:44.860
when I had a dog that lived next door to a dog that was in heat,

4208
01:52:44.861 --> 01:52:46.160
it was because

4209
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:48.230
<v 0>I thought there was something wrong with him.</v>

4210
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:49.400
He was in pain.

4211
01:52:49.401 --> 01:52:51.670
He was like going down the stairs and Yiping and pains.

4212
01:52:51.690 --> 01:52:53.870
I thought he'd like broken a hip or something like that.

4213
01:52:53.871 --> 01:52:55.940
I thought he was in pain because he was injured.

4214
01:52:55.941 --> 01:52:57.950
So I brought him to the hospital and,

4215
01:52:57.951 --> 01:52:58.160
uh,

4216
01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:00.290
the veterinarian was checking him out.

4217
01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:01.101
And this is like a,

4218
01:53:01.101 --> 01:53:02.090
is there a dog in your,

4219
01:53:02.091 --> 01:53:02.301
uh,

4220
01:53:02.301 --> 01:53:03.710
your neighborhood that's in heat?

4221
01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:04.791
And I said,

4222
01:53:04.791 --> 01:53:05.960
I don't know why he goes,

4223
01:53:06.110 --> 01:53:07.400
because your dog's just horny as hell.

4224
01:53:08.090 --> 01:53:08.511
And I was like,

4225
01:53:08.511 --> 01:53:09.344
are you serious?

4226
01:53:09.450 --> 01:53:10.000
Like my dogs,

4227
01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:10.521
so horny.

4228
01:53:10.521 --> 01:53:11.990
He's crying so bad.

4229
01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:12.740
He was,

4230
01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:13.100
you know,

4231
01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:13.461
this big,

4232
01:53:13.461 --> 01:53:14.181
strong dog.

4233
01:53:14.181 --> 01:53:15.014
But he would walk in,

4234
01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:19.520
come him panic and I'd be like,

4235
01:53:19.521 --> 01:53:20.301
it's okay buddy.

4236
01:53:20.301 --> 01:53:20.721
It's okay.

4237
01:53:20.721 --> 01:53:22.550
What's the matter and sound like my poor dog,

4238
01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:24.560
I carried him to the car cause I thought it was broken.

4239
01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:26.510
Meanwhile I was just horny.

4240
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:27.170
That's,

4241
01:53:27.170 --> 01:53:27.430
yeah,

4242
01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:28.970
that's the noise I make.

4243
01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:29.450
You know,

4244
01:53:29.450 --> 01:53:30.850
if a girl comes back to my place,

4245
01:53:31.090 --> 01:53:31.923
it doesn't put out.

4246
01:53:32.710 --> 01:53:33.543
<v 12>Sorry.</v>

4247
01:53:35.150 --> 01:53:36.410
<v 0>Danson sexist.</v>

4248
01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:37.791
Use the term,

4249
01:53:37.791 --> 01:53:38.480
put out.

4250
01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:40.190
How dare you give it up.

4251
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:41.211
Oh my God.

4252
01:53:41.211 --> 01:53:42.044
He said give it up.

4253
01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:43.400
Give up the honey hole.

4254
01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:44.713
Oh God,

4255
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:47.623
you were hurting.

4256
01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:49.880
Give it up.

4257
01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:50.713
Is that a thing?

4258
01:53:50.980 --> 01:53:51.331
Um,

4259
01:53:51.331 --> 01:53:54.740
I'm sure it's a thing people call it that for sure.

4260
01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:55.431
Honey Pot,

4261
01:53:55.431 --> 01:53:56.161
I think they call it.

4262
01:53:56.161 --> 01:53:56.760
Is that it?

4263
01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:57.000
Yeah.

4264
01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.400
Honeypot and honey hole,

4265
01:53:58.401 --> 01:53:59.930
you'd be better off with a hole in a pot.

4266
01:54:00.230 --> 01:54:00.841
Seems like a whole,

4267
01:54:00.841 --> 01:54:02.720
you can be a little bit more specific about the size of it

4268
01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:06.200
and call it a big old hole.

4269
01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:10.760
You don't want to put your Dick in anything you're calling a pot that's can't be

4270
01:54:10.761 --> 01:54:11.180
big.

4271
01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:11.511
Like what's,

4272
01:54:11.511 --> 01:54:13.340
even if my child's pots did they play in?

4273
01:54:13.770 --> 01:54:14.960
They're still fucking quick,

4274
01:54:14.961 --> 01:54:15.794
quite big.

4275
01:54:15.890 --> 01:54:16.520
You know,

4276
01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:20.060
a cauldron my back in the day they had cauldrons.

4277
01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:20.970
Yeah,

4278
01:54:20.970 --> 01:54:21.290
you,

4279
01:54:21.290 --> 01:54:23.150
that's what Chuck Jack Two giants would fuck.

4280
01:54:23.330 --> 01:54:25.700
Have you been paying attention to this fucking government shutdown?

4281
01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:26.661
Uh,

4282
01:54:26.661 --> 01:54:27.494
you know,

4283
01:54:27.710 --> 01:54:28.543
uh,

4284
01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:31.550
I don't enjoy paying attention to it cause it just makes me angry.

4285
01:54:31.551 --> 01:54:32.384
But I,

4286
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:35.480
I do check in every day to see what they're saying about it.

4287
01:54:36.650 --> 01:54:37.400
Yeah.

4288
01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:38.750
I am so confused.

4289
01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:40.490
It's a big whole mass.

4290
01:54:40.491 --> 01:54:41.360
It's just stupid.

4291
01:54:41.450 --> 01:54:42.380
I'm so confused.

4292
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:45.020
It's exactly what's wrong with American politics.

4293
01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:46.671
I'm also,

4294
01:54:46.671 --> 01:54:47.091
I'm just,

4295
01:54:47.091 --> 01:54:49.370
I'm so confused that they let it get to this point too.

4296
01:54:49.371 --> 01:54:50.240
I don't understand.

4297
01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:51.620
I mean,

4298
01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:52.670
how could they fucking,

4299
01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:56.750
like if it's really is like a standoff thing where one side won't won't,

4300
01:54:57.710 --> 01:54:58.640
it's like one third.

4301
01:54:58.641 --> 01:55:01.160
It's not even a side as much as it's like a third.

4302
01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:03.700
I don't understand crazy.

4303
01:55:03.890 --> 01:55:05.870
I don't know how it ever even gets made.

4304
01:55:06.850 --> 01:55:08.150
I don't know how it's possible.

4305
01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:10.760
Everyone's just like a,

4306
01:55:10.770 --> 01:55:11.603
you know,

4307
01:55:11.690 --> 01:55:15.260
everyone wants to be reelected is that is their number one goal.

4308
01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:16.453
Uh,

4309
01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:17.030
you know,

4310
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:18.740
and if they're about to retire,

4311
01:55:18.741 --> 01:55:22.790
their number one goal is to take down then the number one person on the opposing

4312
01:55:22.791 --> 01:55:25.640
team and that seems all they want to do.

4313
01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:25.941
Yeah.

4314
01:55:25.941 --> 01:55:26.210
Just,

4315
01:55:26.210 --> 01:55:28.340
I just have a hard time believing that,

4316
01:55:28.670 --> 01:55:29.121
you know,

4317
01:55:29.121 --> 01:55:33.170
in this day and age that we can allow the whole system,

4318
01:55:33.171 --> 01:55:37.400
did you shut down for more than a week because they can't agree on something?

4319
01:55:37.450 --> 01:55:38.283
It seems like,

4320
01:55:38.540 --> 01:55:39.410
I understand.

4321
01:55:39.411 --> 01:55:42.440
I'm not trying to be naive that they have to represent their constituents and

4322
01:55:42.441 --> 01:55:44.040
that they have viewpoints

4323
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:45.690
<v 5>on certain things like Obamacare.</v>

4324
01:55:45.870 --> 01:55:48.030
But apparently that's the big stipulation.

4325
01:55:48.031 --> 01:55:49.740
It's all about the,

4326
01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:50.050
the,

4327
01:55:50.050 --> 01:55:53.260
the program that's going to be instituted for healthcare,

4328
01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:54.450
mandatory healthcare.

4329
01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:56.220
There's certain stipulations about the program.

4330
01:55:56.370 --> 01:55:58.140
I know that a lot of business owners don't like,

4331
01:55:58.500 --> 01:55:59.970
but I know that other people think it's good.

4332
01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:00.510
Another thing,

4333
01:56:00.510 --> 01:56:01.920
people think that it's a great step.

4334
01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:02.880
So I don't,

4335
01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:05.430
I need to fucking really dig into it and,

4336
01:56:05.550 --> 01:56:08.940
and take an evening and really research it from a bunch of different points of

4337
01:56:08.941 --> 01:56:09.630
view.

4338
01:56:09.630 --> 01:56:11.160
Because right now I'm getting,

4339
01:56:11.190 --> 01:56:11.730
you know,

4340
01:56:11.730 --> 01:56:14.400
just sort of abstract information about it and I don't,

4341
01:56:14.401 --> 01:56:15.690
I don't have enough to talk about it.

4342
01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:18.420
It seems to me that it's a very divisive issue.

4343
01:56:18.530 --> 01:56:20.720
<v 2>I try not to talk about these things just cause I,</v>

4344
01:56:20.721 --> 01:56:21.554
you know,

4345
01:56:22.130 --> 01:56:24.290
I don't consider myself an expert,

4346
01:56:24.291 --> 01:56:26.690
but I do pay attention.

4347
01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:26.931
You know,

4348
01:56:26.931 --> 01:56:29.990
I do listen to all of it to try to understand it.

4349
01:56:30.590 --> 01:56:31.340
Um,

4350
01:56:31.340 --> 01:56:32.330
and in the case of this,

4351
01:56:32.331 --> 01:56:33.830
it just really feels like,

4352
01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:35.953
uh,

4353
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:38.600
if Obamacare is fully implemented,

4354
01:56:38.601 --> 01:56:39.270
then that's,

4355
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:43.250
then they no longer have the Obamacare is going to ruin the country argument

4356
01:56:43.490 --> 01:56:45.320
unless it really does ruin the country.

4357
01:56:45.580 --> 01:56:46.670
And in which case,

4358
01:56:47.150 --> 01:56:49.850
why won't they just let it happen if they think it's going to ruin the country

4359
01:56:49.851 --> 01:56:51.860
and then they can jump in and be the saviors,

4360
01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:53.353
you know?

4361
01:56:53.540 --> 01:56:53.781
Yeah,

4362
01:56:53.781 --> 01:56:54.231
I guess so.

4363
01:56:54.231 --> 01:56:57.150
There seems like they're trying to stop it.

4364
01:56:57.170 --> 01:57:00.470
Just any kind of success that can be had by the current administration needs to

4365
01:57:00.471 --> 01:57:02.120
be stopped at any cost.

4366
01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:03.680
It feels like what's going on.

4367
01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:06.980
And also laws that are put in place are much more difficult to resend.

4368
01:57:07.310 --> 01:57:07.551
Yeah.

4369
01:57:07.551 --> 01:57:08.150
It's fun.

4370
01:57:08.150 --> 01:57:08.470
Obama,

4371
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:09.770
Obamacare is a fucking law.

4372
01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:10.730
Yeah.

4373
01:57:10.730 --> 01:57:11.360
You know,

4374
01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:11.791
so they're,

4375
01:57:11.791 --> 01:57:14.930
they're going to all this trouble to fight it when there's all these other

4376
01:57:14.931 --> 01:57:15.740
issues that's,

4377
01:57:15.740 --> 01:57:17.300
that genuinely need,

4378
01:57:17.301 --> 01:57:17.660
like,

4379
01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:19.760
why aren't they all just trying to create jobs?

4380
01:57:19.761 --> 01:57:21.350
Like why is this the discussion?

4381
01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:23.150
Do you guys understand the Obamacare at all?

4382
01:57:23.151 --> 01:57:23.330
Like,

4383
01:57:23.330 --> 01:57:23.830
like if,

4384
01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:24.310
if,

4385
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:24.520
if,

4386
01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:27.260
is that because Kevin Pereira just signed up for it?

4387
01:57:27.261 --> 01:57:28.610
Like that night at midnight,

4388
01:57:28.611 --> 01:57:29.570
he was on the computer.

4389
01:57:29.571 --> 01:57:34.571
It's signing up for Obamacare and I think he pays like $200 a month or $300 a

4390
01:57:35.241 --> 01:57:38.480
month for like really fucking awesome insurance because of it now.

4391
01:57:38.810 --> 01:57:39.110
But,

4392
01:57:39.110 --> 01:57:39.351
uh,

4393
01:57:39.351 --> 01:57:41.060
it doesn't start until January.

4394
01:57:41.090 --> 01:57:42.680
I guess you have to sign your first.

4395
01:57:42.681 --> 01:57:42.831
It's,

4396
01:57:42.831 --> 01:57:44.180
this is the sign up period.

4397
01:57:44.181 --> 01:57:45.440
They're trying to get everybody,

4398
01:57:45.441 --> 01:57:49.130
but like there's all these ads on TV telling you that it's bad and that you

4399
01:57:49.131 --> 01:57:50.210
shouldn't sign up for it.

4400
01:57:50.750 --> 01:57:54.320
They have ads that try to encourage young people to not sign up for it because

4401
01:57:54.321 --> 01:57:55.154
they have,

4402
01:57:55.190 --> 01:57:55.970
uh,

4403
01:57:55.970 --> 01:58:00.320
a young woman is sitting in like a gynecologist office with her feet in the

4404
01:58:00.321 --> 01:58:04.250
stirrups and then the gynecologist has a giant ugly,

4405
01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:05.030
uh,

4406
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:06.080
Uncle Sam,

4407
01:58:06.510 --> 01:58:07.590
a paper machine,

4408
01:58:07.610 --> 01:58:09.970
Uncle Sam head that rises up and,

4409
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:12.050
and it's like looming over her vagina.

4410
01:58:12.410 --> 01:58:14.270
Like trying to tell young people,

4411
01:58:14.271 --> 01:58:16.260
don't sign up for Obamacare because then they're there.

4412
01:58:16.490 --> 01:58:18.920
Then the government's going to tell you what you can do with your vagina.

4413
01:58:19.260 --> 01:58:20.093
What was that true?

4414
01:58:20.110 --> 01:58:21.740
It was the government has a vagina agenda.

4415
01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:22.551
Well,

4416
01:58:22.551 --> 01:58:22.971
the thing is,

4417
01:58:22.971 --> 01:58:26.490
is they argue that Republicans do are,

4418
01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:27.433
are,

4419
01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:27.771
you know,

4420
01:58:27.771 --> 01:58:29.270
do have a vagina agenda,

4421
01:58:29.450 --> 01:58:30.283
but it's not too,

4422
01:58:31.340 --> 01:58:32.480
it's so weird that they've,

4423
01:58:32.610 --> 01:58:34.430
they basically have just flipped the script.

4424
01:58:34.460 --> 01:58:35.750
Like it's supposed to be that,

4425
01:58:35.751 --> 01:58:36.270
you know,

4426
01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:36.541
uh,

4427
01:58:36.541 --> 01:58:39.020
the Republicans are anti woman,

4428
01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:42.130
but they're trying to make it look like Obama's really the one that wants

4429
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:42.820
<v 5>to tell you when,</v>

4430
01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:44.450
what you could do with your vagina.

4431
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:46.000
So it's just a manipulative,

4432
01:58:46.030 --> 01:58:47.920
it's about healthcare period.

4433
01:58:47.921 --> 01:58:50.200
So they use it to like sexual health care.

4434
01:58:50.230 --> 01:58:51.490
They go to that right away.

4435
01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:52.331
Babies,

4436
01:58:52.331 --> 01:58:53.200
Vagina.

4437
01:58:53.260 --> 01:58:54.370
Your wife's purse.

4438
01:58:54.700 --> 01:58:54.881
Yeah.

4439
01:58:54.881 --> 01:58:56.650
Well cause that's what the Democrats had been using.

4440
01:58:56.651 --> 01:58:58.630
They've been saying the Republicans are anti woman,

4441
01:58:58.631 --> 01:58:59.021
so this,

4442
01:58:59.021 --> 01:59:01.180
so they're just using the same approach but saying,

4443
01:59:01.210 --> 01:59:05.260
but putting it on Obamacare and Obamacare is anti woman.

4444
01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:07.450
It's really fascinating that they're allowed to do that.

4445
01:59:07.451 --> 01:59:08.290
It's really fascinated.

4446
01:59:08.291 --> 01:59:12.640
They're allowed to editorialize at all and that they're allowed to have like any

4447
01:59:12.641 --> 01:59:15.790
sort of dramatic influence at all and their commercials.

4448
01:59:16.180 --> 01:59:17.200
It's so crazy.

4449
01:59:17.201 --> 01:59:19.540
Like you're allowing people to manipulate.

4450
01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:20.620
You know,

4451
01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:23.440
Doug Benson has shown time and time again.

4452
01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:26.260
He doesn't care about the people of Los Angeles.

4453
01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:31.300
Doug Benson promotes smoking marijuana for underage children,

4454
01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:33.790
including your children.

4455
01:59:34.090 --> 01:59:36.850
Doug Benson is not a good American.

4456
01:59:36.851 --> 01:59:37.450
In fact,

4457
01:59:37.450 --> 01:59:40.960
he would live in Canada if it wasn't so fucking cold.

4458
01:59:42.010 --> 01:59:45.130
Doug pence and we'll make up shit presidents.

4459
01:59:46.680 --> 01:59:48.910
They almost can say that man,

4460
01:59:48.911 --> 01:59:49.510
they can,

4461
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:50.770
they're so dramatic.

4462
01:59:50.771 --> 01:59:53.290
It's not facts like very clear,

4463
01:59:53.291 --> 01:59:56.950
simple vetted facts that had been verified in both sides and agreed to,

4464
01:59:57.110 --> 01:59:57.320
no,

4465
01:59:57.320 --> 01:59:57.460
no,

4466
01:59:57.460 --> 01:59:57.611
no,

4467
01:59:57.611 --> 01:59:59.350
no nonsense,

4468
01:59:59.530 --> 02:00:00.730
hyperbole,

4469
02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:01.750
drama,

4470
02:00:01.780 --> 02:00:03.640
dramatic writing,

4471
02:00:03.670 --> 02:00:04.690
fucking manipulation,

4472
02:00:04.691 --> 02:00:05.141
the truth,

4473
02:00:05.141 --> 02:00:06.790
all that standard fare and oh,

4474
02:00:06.791 --> 02:00:07.624
by the way,

4475
02:00:07.630 --> 02:00:10.000
we've been paid for by giant corporations.

4476
02:00:10.001 --> 02:00:11.380
All of this manipulation,

4477
02:00:11.650 --> 02:00:14.260
the changing of the opinion of the culture there,

4478
02:00:14.410 --> 02:00:15.160
that sheep beloved,

4479
02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:20.160
the culture has been all manipulated by giant corporations under the law hall.

4480
02:00:22.190 --> 02:00:25.870
All totally squeaky clean in legal and encouraged and necessary for the

4481
02:00:26.020 --> 02:00:26.950
political process.

4482
02:00:26.951 --> 02:00:27.784
Doug Benson,

4483
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:30.400
why the political process needs money injected into it.

4484
02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:35.020
There's very few laws that are against rich people.

4485
02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:40.140
Very few rich feeling get away with almost anything as long as they can.

4486
02:00:40.690 --> 02:00:42.940
Not Rape or murder rich people are set.

4487
02:00:43.270 --> 02:00:43.720
Yeah,

4488
02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:44.980
they're never going to jail.

4489
02:00:45.010 --> 02:00:45.710
Jerry's a lot.

4490
02:00:45.710 --> 02:00:46.110
Well,

4491
02:00:46.110 --> 02:00:48.100
unless they rip off rich people,

4492
02:00:48.190 --> 02:00:51.640
unless you've already made on then I mean like there's nobody's in jail from the

4493
02:00:51.641 --> 02:00:52.151
last,

4494
02:00:52.151 --> 02:00:52.600
uh,

4495
02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:53.200
you know,

4496
02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:56.470
crisis on Wall Street and nobody got arrested for that.

4497
02:00:56.500 --> 02:00:56.681
Well,

4498
02:00:56.681 --> 02:00:57.281
Bernie made off.

4499
02:00:57.281 --> 02:00:59.050
You can't really connect to the crisis on Wall Street,

4500
02:00:59.051 --> 02:00:59.201
but,

4501
02:00:59.201 --> 02:00:59.371
no,

4502
02:00:59.371 --> 02:00:59.560
no,

4503
02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:01.600
but I'm just saying went down because he ripped off.

4504
02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:02.860
It's super hard.

4505
02:01:03.220 --> 02:01:04.060
But if you think about it,

4506
02:01:04.061 --> 02:01:05.410
there's the super rich people,

4507
02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:06.460
there's people that lost money,

4508
02:01:06.461 --> 02:01:10.390
but there's also people that have gained money in the craziness of the market as

4509
02:01:10.391 --> 02:01:11.500
it existed before.

4510
02:01:11.770 --> 02:01:14.500
And there's people that recognize that a correction was going to be in place.

4511
02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:17.910
And it's also people to recognize that because of the political money that they

4512
02:01:17.911 --> 02:01:18.790
put into the system,

4513
02:01:18.970 --> 02:01:20.200
the banks were rescued.

4514
02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:23.500
So even though they lost all this money and it could have been a catastrophic

4515
02:01:23.501 --> 02:01:23.760
failure,

4516
02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:26.010
the catastrophic failure for these companies like this,

4517
02:01:26.060 --> 02:01:26.291
listen,

4518
02:01:26.291 --> 02:01:27.340
we're going to be taken care of.

4519
02:01:27.550 --> 02:01:31.240
And so then the government gangs money from the people perhaps back up the bank

4520
02:01:31.330 --> 02:01:31.781
saying,

4521
02:01:31.781 --> 02:01:32.500
listen,

4522
02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:34.660
this economy is very fragile.

4523
02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:37.450
We have to keep it going as only we know how.

4524
02:01:37.570 --> 02:01:38.590
So we're going to need some money.

4525
02:01:38.950 --> 02:01:42.290
We're to need some money and we're sorry about this and don't worry about it.

4526
02:01:42.410 --> 02:01:43.910
We're never going to happen again.

4527
02:01:43.970 --> 02:01:44.390
Um,

4528
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:45.680
your tax dollars would never go to these.

4529
02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:47.000
Why is he getting a bonus?

4530
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.331
Oh,

4531
02:01:47.331 --> 02:01:48.200
he needs a bonus,

4532
02:01:48.201 --> 02:01:48.411
man.

4533
02:01:48.411 --> 02:01:49.340
He gotta get his bonus.

4534
02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:50.480
If you don't get his bonus,

4535
02:01:50.481 --> 02:01:50.660
man,

4536
02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:51.170
he'll leave.

4537
02:01:51.170 --> 02:01:52.220
He'll go somewhere else.

4538
02:01:52.370 --> 02:01:53.540
He did the job.

4539
02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:55.620
Fucking bonuses.

4540
02:01:55.770 --> 02:01:57.920
Bonuses were half a million dollars.

4541
02:01:57.921 --> 02:01:59.030
That was the limitation.

4542
02:01:59.031 --> 02:02:00.290
The cap cover.

4543
02:02:01.310 --> 02:02:05.710
We've been informed that people are upset about the bonuses we need to raise the

4544
02:02:05.711 --> 02:02:06.544
debt ceiling.

4545
02:02:06.830 --> 02:02:07.663
Yeah.

4546
02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:12.770
We have limited their bonuses to $500,000.

4547
02:02:15.530 --> 02:02:20.420
That's so much money for the average person to get a $500,000 bonus in the mail.

4548
02:02:20.570 --> 02:02:21.051
They'd be like,

4549
02:02:21.051 --> 02:02:22.970
holy fucking shit.

4550
02:02:23.150 --> 02:02:24.590
Can you imagine if you go to your mailbox,

4551
02:02:24.780 --> 02:02:25.240
you've ever,

4552
02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:26.780
you just received a bonus from work.

4553
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:29.703
What are the fuck they say?

4554
02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:30.970
You're just not thinking about what kind of car?

4555
02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:31.580
My mind,

4556
02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:32.990
I'm going to buy a fucking new corvette.

4557
02:02:33.010 --> 02:02:33.680
Goddammit.

4558
02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:34.490
You can say,

4559
02:02:34.490 --> 02:02:35.390
how much is the down payment?

4560
02:02:35.410 --> 02:02:35.691
A house?

4561
02:02:35.691 --> 02:02:36.530
How much am I going to have left?

4562
02:02:36.650 --> 02:02:38.870
You would just start going over the money in your head.

4563
02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:41.060
That's what their bonus was.

4564
02:02:41.061 --> 02:02:44.960
This is after they're already making millions in their bank fail,

4565
02:02:44.980 --> 02:02:45.813
Duh,

4566
02:02:45.890 --> 02:02:50.890
crashed into the fucking ground and was prop backup I taxpayers in a way that I

4567
02:02:51.981 --> 02:02:53.300
completely don't understand,

4568
02:02:53.690 --> 02:02:54.800
but if you talked to Brian Cowen,

4569
02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:56.660
he will Fox News you to death on this.

4570
02:02:56.750 --> 02:02:57.583
Oh really?

4571
02:02:57.950 --> 02:02:58.161
Well,

4572
02:02:58.161 --> 02:02:59.810
you know they paid the loan back within nine months

4573
02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:05.170
where that money go then come on.

4574
02:03:05.210 --> 02:03:05.960
They need to pay more.

4575
02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:07.170
Everyone needs to pay for it.

4576
02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:08.113
Figured this out.

4577
02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:09.200
Work this fucking thing out.

4578
02:03:09.201 --> 02:03:10.034
This thing's a mess.

4579
02:03:10.100 --> 02:03:15.100
This is a fucking housemate and a sticks and and gluten gum all fucking patched

4580
02:03:15.281 --> 02:03:18.490
together and fucking wavering in the wind joke.

4581
02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:21.020
Please tell me you saw that Yoko Ono on David Letterman.

4582
02:03:21.050 --> 02:03:22.160
I refuse to watch it.

4583
02:03:22.330 --> 02:03:22.730
Why?

4584
02:03:22.730 --> 02:03:24.080
She makes my blood boil.

4585
02:03:24.570 --> 02:03:25.403
God,

4586
02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:28.850
she makes my blood boil and I don't want to be a mean person,

4587
02:03:28.851 --> 02:03:30.290
so I don't want to say mean things about her.

4588
02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:31.730
But I this,

4589
02:03:31.731 --> 02:03:34.510
this idea that what she's doing is some sort of,

4590
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:35.960
I guess it is a performance art.

4591
02:03:35.961 --> 02:03:36.850
If we're talking about it,

4592
02:03:36.990 --> 02:03:38.840
it elicits a response from you.

4593
02:03:39.050 --> 02:03:42.980
But the response is not the kind of response that I want from my 30 seconds to a

4594
02:03:42.981 --> 02:03:44.510
minute of watching something.

4595
02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:45.350
It's the,

4596
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:47.210
it's a response that makes me annoyed.

4597
02:03:47.650 --> 02:03:47.991
I love,

4598
02:03:47.991 --> 02:03:48.920
what does she do on there?

4599
02:03:48.921 --> 02:03:49.111
That,

4600
02:03:49.111 --> 02:03:51.620
so I love the first comment or the most,

4601
02:03:51.670 --> 02:03:51.980
uh,

4602
02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:52.761
voted comment,

4603
02:03:52.761 --> 02:03:52.970
you know,

4604
02:03:52.970 --> 02:03:53.391
on Youtube,

4605
02:03:53.391 --> 02:03:54.460
the one at the top was,

4606
02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:55.130
it says,

4607
02:03:55.130 --> 02:03:57.200
what the Goddamn fucking fuck did.

4608
02:03:57.201 --> 02:03:59.500
I just was like,

4609
02:03:59.510 --> 02:04:00.470
almost 200,000.

4610
02:04:00.471 --> 02:04:00.890
All right.

4611
02:04:00.890 --> 02:04:02.670
Cause she came out and did a song or something.

4612
02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:03.820
Let's put,

4613
02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:06.260
let's play like 90.

4614
02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:07.400
Yeah.

4615
02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:07.550
Yeah.

4616
02:04:07.550 --> 02:04:08.091
Well she,

4617
02:04:08.091 --> 02:04:08.840
um,

4618
02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:11.300
when she got John Lennon soul into her body,

4619
02:04:11.310 --> 02:04:12.380
she got a double life.

4620
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.170
David Letterman hanging in.

4621
02:04:16.610 --> 02:04:17.210
Good Guy,

4622
02:04:17.210 --> 02:04:18.980
but he's the only having her on just for the,

4623
02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:20.780
this sort of attention

4624
02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:23.990
a lineup has changed over the years.

4625
02:04:23.991 --> 02:04:28.010
But whose namesake has remained at the helm and their new album right here is

4626
02:04:28.011 --> 02:04:30.230
entitled to take me to the weird intro.

4627
02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:31.370
Oh my goodness.

4628
02:04:31.370 --> 02:04:32.151
What a trip.

4629
02:04:32.151 --> 02:04:32.984
That would be

4630
02:04:34.450 --> 02:04:34.790
least.

4631
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:35.211
What'd he say?

4632
02:04:35.211 --> 02:04:36.044
Take me to the what?

4633
02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:36.650
Hell,

4634
02:04:36.650 --> 02:04:37.291
aiming lips.

4635
02:04:37.291 --> 02:04:38.070
Yoko Ono

4636
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:38.720
<v 9>in the house,</v>

4637
02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:39.060
I think.

4638
02:04:39.060 --> 02:04:40.020
What's the name of her album?

4639
02:04:40.990 --> 02:04:41.260
<v 13>I don't know.</v>

4640
02:04:41.260 --> 02:04:41.921
You were talking to,

4641
02:04:41.921 --> 02:04:42.754
fuck.

4642
02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:44.130
I can't look it up.

4643
02:04:45.250 --> 02:04:46.083
Oh my God.

4644
02:04:58.560 --> 02:04:58.831
<v 9>Okay.</v>

4645
02:04:58.831 --> 02:05:00.900
I changed my tune 100% I love her now.

4646
02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:02.033
I thought this.

4647
02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:04.680
I thought it was going to be terrible.

4648
02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:05.700
I mean it's,

4649
02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:06.810
I don't enjoy it.

4650
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:07.270
Well,

4651
02:05:07.270 --> 02:05:08.100
your third fight,

4652
02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:08.933
it's not.

4653
02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:10.470
She's mixed with the flaming lips,

4654
02:05:10.471 --> 02:05:11.160
so yeah,

4655
02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:13.110
the 90% of it is bad ass.

4656
02:05:13.210 --> 02:05:14.043
Yeah.

4657
02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:15.511
Yeah.

4658
02:05:15.511 --> 02:05:16.344
You know what I'm in.

4659
02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:18.900
It's fine to have her screeching of the flaming lips or plan.

4660
02:05:19.310 --> 02:05:19.950
Yeah.

4661
02:05:19.950 --> 02:05:20.790
It's got a good beat.

4662
02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:21.121
Yeah.

4663
02:05:21.121 --> 02:05:21.954
They're bad ass.

4664
02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:24.780
Flaming lips are dope.

4665
02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:29.160
They're making her sound awesome.

4666
02:05:31.330 --> 02:05:32.700
If you is the backup singer,

4667
02:05:32.701 --> 02:05:33.120
he's like,

4668
02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:33.510
Ooh,

4669
02:05:33.510 --> 02:05:33.870
Ooh,

4670
02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:34.710
I like this.

4671
02:05:37.610 --> 02:05:40.680
Do you like the hooded figure with the a cocktail shaker?

4672
02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:41.311
Yeah.

4673
02:05:41.311 --> 02:05:42.420
You know what I love about this?

4674
02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:44.760
This bitch could do this all day with different songs.

4675
02:05:44.970 --> 02:05:46.110
She hasn't written a word of this.

4676
02:05:46.111 --> 02:05:47.640
This is all noise coming out of her mouth.

4677
02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:49.020
So yeah,

4678
02:05:49.570 --> 02:05:52.500
just take your daughter's singing to the mirror and playing dress up.

4679
02:05:53.130 --> 02:05:53.731
I Dunno man.

4680
02:05:53.731 --> 02:05:54.930
She seems pretty good at this.

4681
02:05:55.290 --> 02:05:56.460
This is a new style.

4682
02:05:57.300 --> 02:05:59.520
She looks good to suck a dick.

4683
02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:00.031
You know what?

4684
02:06:00.031 --> 02:06:00.930
This would be good man.

4685
02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:01.980
That's how she got John.

4686
02:06:02.180 --> 02:06:04.290
She had to do something to hook that motherfucker.

4687
02:06:05.370 --> 02:06:06.600
He was so into her.

4688
02:06:06.630 --> 02:06:07.890
She must have a super pussy.

4689
02:06:08.670 --> 02:06:09.930
He must have Gudu Pussy.

4690
02:06:10.280 --> 02:06:11.113
No other way.

4691
02:06:11.250 --> 02:06:12.540
Is that her boyfriend on the floor?

4692
02:06:13.340 --> 02:06:13.500
No,

4693
02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:14.790
it's Robert Plant who gave up,

4694
02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:15.730
I guess he uh,

4695
02:06:16.570 --> 02:06:17.490
and he took the hood off.

4696
02:06:18.980 --> 02:06:21.720
The beautiful thing is you could do this all day with her.

4697
02:06:21.721 --> 02:06:25.320
Like if the flaming lips had her singing songs,

4698
02:06:26.610 --> 02:06:28.440
they could actually be pretty fucking good song.

4699
02:06:28.441 --> 02:06:29.550
Like that would be a good album.

4700
02:06:30.150 --> 02:06:34.260
I'm not bullshitting you because I like music that doesn't have songs that

4701
02:06:34.261 --> 02:06:35.370
doesn't have lyrics sometimes.

4702
02:06:35.371 --> 02:06:38.190
Like I listened to foreign artists because I don't know what the fuck they're

4703
02:06:38.191 --> 02:06:39.024
talking about.

4704
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:39.863
I enjoy it.

4705
02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:43.020
Of course this would get tired.

4706
02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:47.040
I couldn't listen to it every day they have a broad spectrum of what I like

4707
02:06:47.041 --> 02:06:49.010
Brian [inaudible] for instance.

4708
02:06:49.011 --> 02:06:49.730
What are you think I was listening?

4709
02:06:49.730 --> 02:06:50.563
You want to way over here?

4710
02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:55.190
Somebody screaming while dying loop tipped over.

4711
02:06:55.191 --> 02:06:55.671
I don't know.

4712
02:06:55.671 --> 02:06:56.210
Jay Z?

4713
02:06:56.210 --> 02:06:57.043
No,

4714
02:06:57.330 --> 02:06:58.670
that was listening to what?

4715
02:06:58.760 --> 02:06:59.690
Dwight Yoakam.

4716
02:06:59.750 --> 02:07:00.583
Oh,

4717
02:07:00.990 --> 02:07:02.600
I like a little country music every now and then,

4718
02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:03.290
I guess.

4719
02:07:03.290 --> 02:07:04.580
I guess he's a good actor.

4720
02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:05.330
I guess at the end.

4721
02:07:05.330 --> 02:07:06.010
David.

4722
02:07:06.010 --> 02:07:06.540
David says,

4723
02:07:06.540 --> 02:07:07.670
Son who's in sling blade,

4724
02:07:07.671 --> 02:07:08.030
right?

4725
02:07:08.030 --> 02:07:09.520
[inaudible] David King.

4726
02:07:09.530 --> 02:07:10.363
He was scary.

4727
02:07:10.750 --> 02:07:11.583
<v 13>Yeah.</v>

4728
02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:12.513
Well she's tiny.

4729
02:07:13.380 --> 02:07:13.541
I mean,

4730
02:07:13.541 --> 02:07:14.021
he's big,

4731
02:07:14.021 --> 02:07:14.854
but she's telling me

4732
02:07:17.390 --> 02:07:18.640
I am crazy.

4733
02:07:18.641 --> 02:07:19.474
Hello.

4734
02:07:21.220 --> 02:07:22.140
It's fun when you

4735
02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:24.300
<v 9>leave the theater humming the music from the show,</v>

4736
02:07:24.430 --> 02:07:25.780
<v 13>isn't it?</v>

4737
02:07:29.620 --> 02:07:30.000
<v 9>I love it.</v>

4738
02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:30.833
Just love it.

4739
02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:32.200
But it was a friendly burn.

4740
02:07:32.260 --> 02:07:32.750
Yes.

4741
02:07:32.750 --> 02:07:33.760
She has no idea.

4742
02:07:33.910 --> 02:07:34.743
She's royalty.

4743
02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:36.040
You have to be friendly to

4744
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:37.980
<v 5>her even if she drives you crazy even.</v>

4745
02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:38.770
But if she hot,

4746
02:07:38.770 --> 02:07:42.850
like if bill burr and her were in a room together and you saw that bill burr

4747
02:07:42.851 --> 02:07:43.151
bit,

4748
02:07:43.151 --> 02:07:44.290
have you seen that bill Baer bet.

4749
02:07:44.830 --> 02:07:45.500
I can imagine.

4750
02:07:45.500 --> 02:07:46.630
It's a video that he,

4751
02:07:46.631 --> 02:07:47.140
uh,

4752
02:07:47.140 --> 02:07:48.730
from his Monday morning podcast,

4753
02:07:48.731 --> 02:07:52.510
this podcast is one of the most unique podcast because it's just him talking

4754
02:07:52.511 --> 02:07:53.980
into a microphone,

4755
02:07:54.280 --> 02:07:55.420
which just goes off,

4756
02:07:55.660 --> 02:07:56.650
which I've done before.

4757
02:07:56.651 --> 02:07:57.880
I did back in the early days.

4758
02:07:57.881 --> 02:08:00.710
I did a few of those like that where I would like read Twitter and like,

4759
02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:00.820
I,

4760
02:08:00.820 --> 02:08:02.380
there's a couple of things I was just going to talk about.

4761
02:08:02.620 --> 02:08:04.060
It just wanted me being baked,

4762
02:08:04.120 --> 02:08:04.953
rambling.

4763
02:08:05.140 --> 02:08:08.070
But bill does it every week and it's really funny and some,

4764
02:08:08.170 --> 02:08:09.400
one of the best ones,

4765
02:08:09.610 --> 02:08:10.443
if you Google it,

4766
02:08:10.660 --> 02:08:11.120
um,

4767
02:08:11.120 --> 02:08:12.670
bill burr,

4768
02:08:12.820 --> 02:08:17.820
just Google bill burr Yoko Ono and John and Yoko are singing with Chuck Berry on

4769
02:08:19.611 --> 02:08:24.611
stage and build does like some fucking most hilarious commentary on her and him,

4770
02:08:25.091 --> 02:08:27.550
that whole situation between John and Yoko that I've ever heard.

4771
02:08:27.550 --> 02:08:28.300
It was fucking,

4772
02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:29.380
and with the video,

4773
02:08:29.381 --> 02:08:31.330
like whoever made the video because it wasn't bill,

4774
02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:32.200
it's a fan,

4775
02:08:32.270 --> 02:08:36.390
maybe video and splice it together perfectly and edited it perfectly so that

4776
02:08:36.391 --> 02:08:36.610
like,

4777
02:08:36.610 --> 02:08:37.480
as he's talking,

4778
02:08:37.481 --> 02:08:40.840
you see the look on Chuck Berry's face when he's fucking realizing that Yoko

4779
02:08:40.841 --> 02:08:42.070
screaming into the microphone.

4780
02:08:42.110 --> 02:08:42.380
Yeah,

4781
02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:42.941
Ya Ya,

4782
02:08:42.941 --> 02:08:43.774
Ya.

4783
02:08:43.780 --> 02:08:46.980
Cause Bill burr did the rent and then they made the video to match the rant.

4784
02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:47.540
Yes.

4785
02:08:47.540 --> 02:08:48.330
Fantastic.

4786
02:08:48.330 --> 02:08:52.090
Oh that's one of the most beautiful things about the internet is these fan

4787
02:08:52.091 --> 02:08:53.110
created things.

4788
02:08:53.111 --> 02:08:54.610
He's fabricated videos.

4789
02:08:54.700 --> 02:08:57.880
I was at a film festival a couple of weeks ago and I just tweeted on my thing,

4790
02:08:57.881 --> 02:08:58.331
I wonder,

4791
02:08:58.331 --> 02:09:03.331
I want to know someone make a picture of what it would look like if James Woods

4792
02:09:03.341 --> 02:09:07.030
had Elijah Wood's eyes and within two minutes,

4793
02:09:07.031 --> 02:09:08.250
three people at Photoshop,

4794
02:09:08.280 --> 02:09:11.110
his eyes onto James Woods and every picture was creepy as fuck.

4795
02:09:11.140 --> 02:09:12.670
I'm sure I've done it.

4796
02:09:12.670 --> 02:09:13.810
Started getting even worse.

4797
02:09:13.811 --> 02:09:15.520
And then someone started photoshopping his dick.

4798
02:09:15.521 --> 02:09:17.620
Cause James Woods has a notoriously big deck.

4799
02:09:18.230 --> 02:09:19.180
Oh does he?

4800
02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:20.800
Can you get those on Twitter?

4801
02:09:20.830 --> 02:09:24.010
Can you see a lot of shows different Twain's I guess why he's so how he's been

4802
02:09:24.011 --> 02:09:24.640
so cocky,

4803
02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:25.101
very cocky.

4804
02:09:25.101 --> 02:09:25.220
He's,

4805
02:09:25.220 --> 02:09:26.380
it's supposed to have a monster hog.

4806
02:09:26.810 --> 02:09:30.160
Are you allowed to have naked stuff on Twitter?

4807
02:09:30.161 --> 02:09:30.994
How's that work?

4808
02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:31.961
Yeah,

4809
02:09:31.961 --> 02:09:32.710
you are.

4810
02:09:32.710 --> 02:09:37.710
Because a lot of the strip girls of the super crazy point pictures like if you

4811
02:09:38.771 --> 02:09:39.710
go to a porn star,

4812
02:09:39.711 --> 02:09:40.340
that's what I'm saying.

4813
02:09:40.340 --> 02:09:41.020
Page.

4814
02:09:41.020 --> 02:09:41.711
How's that work?

4815
02:09:41.711 --> 02:09:43.450
Is pictures of them with Dixon and and stuff.

4816
02:09:43.950 --> 02:09:45.250
Did they have to be locked?

4817
02:09:45.490 --> 02:09:46.630
Like you have to approve?

4818
02:09:47.640 --> 02:09:48.910
Just let it looks pretty,

4819
02:09:49.380 --> 02:09:50.201
pretty open range.

4820
02:09:50.201 --> 02:09:51.190
I think maybe like,

4821
02:09:51.220 --> 02:09:51.581
you know,

4822
02:09:51.581 --> 02:09:52.990
Twitter could shut him down.

4823
02:09:53.740 --> 02:09:56.380
Well that's when some of the things that people like about Instagram is that you

4824
02:09:56.381 --> 02:09:57.010
can lock it.

4825
02:09:57.010 --> 02:09:57.990
You could have your own thing.

4826
02:09:58.080 --> 02:10:00.730
We only your friends can get into to check it out.

4827
02:10:00.731 --> 02:10:02.590
You have to approve them if they don't get it.

4828
02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:03.633
That's crepey.

4829
02:10:04.510 --> 02:10:04.871
Wow,

4830
02:10:04.871 --> 02:10:05.351
that's weird.

4831
02:10:05.351 --> 02:10:06.220
He looks like a robot.

4832
02:10:06.310 --> 02:10:06.700
Yeah.

4833
02:10:06.700 --> 02:10:08.270
James Woods with Elijah was eyes.

4834
02:10:10.140 --> 02:10:10.570
Um,

4835
02:10:10.570 --> 02:10:12.220
how did we get to talking about James Woods?

4836
02:10:12.940 --> 02:10:16.120
I just brought it up as an example of we know about how you can,

4837
02:10:16.121 --> 02:10:16.540
uh,

4838
02:10:16.540 --> 02:10:18.610
you were talking about how people should cut together.

4839
02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:21.430
Like that's what I've been thinking about.

4840
02:10:21.431 --> 02:10:22.300
You also,

4841
02:10:22.301 --> 02:10:25.930
you know how we talked about how you should do commentary on street fights and

4842
02:10:25.931 --> 02:10:26.470
stuff.

4843
02:10:26.470 --> 02:10:27.303
Yeah.

4844
02:10:28.180 --> 02:10:31.960
Another thing you could do though that would be awesome is just take classic

4845
02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:34.460
fight scenes from movies

4846
02:10:34.970 --> 02:10:36.560
<v 2>and do Joe Rogan,</v>

4847
02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:37.120
uh,

4848
02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:37.550
you know,

4849
02:10:37.550 --> 02:10:39.110
commentary through them as if it's,

4850
02:10:39.140 --> 02:10:39.501
you know,

4851
02:10:39.501 --> 02:10:39.750
you guys,

4852
02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:40.730
if you're calling a fight,

4853
02:10:40.731 --> 02:10:42.920
but it's as no one ever done that before.

4854
02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:43.791
I don't think so.

4855
02:10:43.791 --> 02:10:44.060
Like,

4856
02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:44.541
like a movie,

4857
02:10:44.541 --> 02:10:48.170
like they live that really long fight scene and they live be so much fun.

4858
02:10:48.171 --> 02:10:52.490
If you just recorded the audio of you talking over it and just set that out and

4859
02:10:52.491 --> 02:10:55.970
then people just get that and then they rent the movie and watch it and then

4860
02:10:55.971 --> 02:10:56.340
listen,

4861
02:10:56.340 --> 02:10:57.260
just sync it up.

4862
02:10:57.261 --> 02:10:59.300
So they listened to you talking about it while they're watching it.

4863
02:10:59.690 --> 02:11:00.140
Hmm.

4864
02:11:00.140 --> 02:11:00.741
That might work.

4865
02:11:00.741 --> 02:11:01.574
Be Super Fun

4866
02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:02.570
<v 0>money.</v>

4867
02:11:02.570 --> 02:11:05.570
You'd have to like get the rights to the movies and shit like that to do that.

4868
02:11:05.571 --> 02:11:06.410
You can't just do that.

4869
02:11:06.630 --> 02:11:06.811
<v 2>No,</v>

4870
02:11:06.811 --> 02:11:07.620
they just do it.

4871
02:11:07.620 --> 02:11:08.040
Really?

4872
02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:08.341
Yeah.

4873
02:11:08.341 --> 02:11:09.000
Like Pete,

4874
02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.170
Pete Holmes and Adam Carolla.

4875
02:11:10.171 --> 02:11:13.170
They'll watch a movie and do it and just have a discussion while they're

4876
02:11:13.171 --> 02:11:14.180
watching it do that.

4877
02:11:14.610 --> 02:11:17.760
As long as you're not recording the movie and using the soundtrack of the movie.

4878
02:11:17.910 --> 02:11:20.070
I talked to this about you about two years ago.

4879
02:11:20.230 --> 02:11:22.230
I said talk to you that we should do this.

4880
02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:23.250
And you were,

4881
02:11:23.250 --> 02:11:24.450
you were against it at the time.

4882
02:11:24.540 --> 02:11:24.691
No,

4883
02:11:24.691 --> 02:11:24.871
no.

4884
02:11:24.871 --> 02:11:25.830
Well I think cause you were,

4885
02:11:26.130 --> 02:11:30.090
cause you were referring to in terms of my Benson movie interruption,

4886
02:11:30.091 --> 02:11:32.940
like why don't you film it or why don't you release it?

4887
02:11:32.941 --> 02:11:35.670
And the reason for that is because I can't record a lot.

4888
02:11:35.700 --> 02:11:37.620
I like the live audience element.

4889
02:11:38.070 --> 02:11:41.220
I like improvising while watching the movie and the live audience element.

4890
02:11:41.370 --> 02:11:43.230
So you can't,

4891
02:11:43.380 --> 02:11:46.320
there's no way to record the audience without recording the soundtrack of the

4892
02:11:46.321 --> 02:11:47.730
movie that's in the same theater.

4893
02:11:48.660 --> 02:11:49.051
And that's,

4894
02:11:49.051 --> 02:11:49.351
so that's,

4895
02:11:49.351 --> 02:11:51.360
I just think it's fun as a live event,

4896
02:11:52.050 --> 02:11:54.700
but what I'm talking about here is,

4897
02:11:54.701 --> 02:11:55.080
is,

4898
02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:56.040
is totally doable.

4899
02:11:56.041 --> 02:11:56.461
It's just not,

4900
02:11:56.461 --> 02:11:58.560
it's not something I want to do necessarily.

4901
02:11:58.610 --> 02:11:59.040
Right.

4902
02:11:59.040 --> 02:11:59.221
Yeah.

4903
02:11:59.221 --> 02:12:01.290
Or just to you or you could call it a comedy album.

4904
02:12:01.291 --> 02:12:01.531
You know,

4905
02:12:01.531 --> 02:12:02.161
just like,

4906
02:12:02.161 --> 02:12:02.700
uh,

4907
02:12:02.700 --> 02:12:03.120
you know,

4908
02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:06.690
Joe talks through some of the greatest fight scenes and maybe you put a bunch of

4909
02:12:06.691 --> 02:12:07.240
them out there.

4910
02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:08.430
Seems like you'd have to pay them.

4911
02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:09.211
It seems like,

4912
02:12:09.211 --> 02:12:10.620
especially if you are profiting off of it,

4913
02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:11.513
you would have to pay them.

4914
02:12:11.690 --> 02:12:12.000
Well,

4915
02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:13.770
for some reason Corolla gets away with it.

4916
02:12:14.190 --> 02:12:14.641
They just,

4917
02:12:14.641 --> 02:12:15.091
they just,

4918
02:12:15.091 --> 02:12:15.900
uh,

4919
02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:16.201
you know,

4920
02:12:16.201 --> 02:12:18.300
it's sort of like they're just talking about the movie.

4921
02:12:18.301 --> 02:12:18.960
So,

4922
02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:19.291
you know,

4923
02:12:19.291 --> 02:12:21.120
as long as you're not playing the actual movie,

4924
02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:22.440
I'll find out.

4925
02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:22.651
You know,

4926
02:12:22.651 --> 02:12:25.380
it's like if you wrote a book on it had a lot of quotes from a movie,

4927
02:12:25.381 --> 02:12:26.130
I don't know.

4928
02:12:26.130 --> 02:12:29.760
I don't think you'd have to pay anybody as long as you're saying what movie it's

4929
02:12:29.761 --> 02:12:33.420
from or we could play the movie and have Joe do it like on an ice house

4930
02:12:33.421 --> 02:12:34.254
chronicles,

4931
02:12:35.670 --> 02:12:36.330
I don't get it.

4932
02:12:36.330 --> 02:12:37.061
Why would that be like,

4933
02:12:37.061 --> 02:12:37.894
do it live

4934
02:12:40.260 --> 02:12:40.651
<v 0>still?</v>

4935
02:12:40.651 --> 02:12:42.550
I think the person who's doing it,

4936
02:12:42.590 --> 02:12:43.301
you can see you're still,

4937
02:12:43.301 --> 02:12:45.490
you're opening yourself up because then it could be possibly,

4938
02:12:45.491 --> 02:12:45.731
yeah.

4939
02:12:45.731 --> 02:12:49.060
Would that if he does the icehouse chronicles and,

4940
02:12:49.061 --> 02:12:49.241
uh,

4941
02:12:49.241 --> 02:12:51.880
the people who listened to that also live listen to his show.

4942
02:12:51.881 --> 02:12:53.440
So it's basically like his show,

4943
02:12:53.710 --> 02:12:54.150
you know,

4944
02:12:54.150 --> 02:12:57.130
there's an argument for that to take down notice.

4945
02:12:57.640 --> 02:12:58.090
Yeah.

4946
02:12:58.090 --> 02:13:01.180
Is that what happens is just give you a take down that trial.

4947
02:13:01.390 --> 02:13:02.290
But see the thing is,

4948
02:13:02.291 --> 02:13:02.620
man,

4949
02:13:02.620 --> 02:13:04.720
it's depends on how the laws get changed.

4950
02:13:04.721 --> 02:13:06.310
It depends on who's coming in next.

4951
02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:09.370
It depends on if Republicans are going to be an office with another going to

4952
02:13:09.371 --> 02:13:10.930
tighten down on this kind of shit,

4953
02:13:10.931 --> 02:13:13.360
whether or not they're going to promote lawsuits like this.

4954
02:13:13.390 --> 02:13:14.021
You know what,

4955
02:13:14.021 --> 02:13:16.610
they're going to make legal and what's not legal because he's,

4956
02:13:16.630 --> 02:13:16.931
you know,

4957
02:13:16.931 --> 02:13:18.790
people can sue if they think that they're going to get paid,

4958
02:13:18.791 --> 02:13:19.624
they're going to sue.

4959
02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:21.520
That's suing is a way of generating.

4960
02:13:21.521 --> 02:13:24.040
You might get paid just so that you don't have to pay more.

4961
02:13:24.130 --> 02:13:24.760
Yeah.

4962
02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:25.710
Sometimes people paying,

4963
02:13:25.711 --> 02:13:28.930
I know people that have been sued for things that they never did and they had to

4964
02:13:28.931 --> 02:13:32.220
pay because they didn't want to deal with any more legal

4965
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:36.600
<v 5>trauma takes time away from them and so they had to give up like 25 grand or 30</v>

4966
02:13:36.601 --> 02:13:37.470
grand for nothing.

4967
02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:38.040
Like,

4968
02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:40.860
I know a guy who was in an argument with someone and the guy claimed that he hit

4969
02:13:40.861 --> 02:13:41.011
him,

4970
02:13:41.011 --> 02:13:44.160
he didn't do anything and want to be giving them money just to shut him up.

4971
02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:44.981
You know?

4972
02:13:44.981 --> 02:13:45.691
And once you do that,

4973
02:13:45.691 --> 02:13:46.830
that's the problem is,

4974
02:13:46.860 --> 02:13:47.960
you know then if,

4975
02:13:47.970 --> 02:13:49.590
what if he has friends and he tells everybody,

4976
02:13:49.591 --> 02:13:49.801
Hey,

4977
02:13:49.801 --> 02:13:50.634
you know I fucking,

4978
02:13:50.850 --> 02:13:52.500
I go to this guy into a,

4979
02:13:52.501 --> 02:13:53.790
an argument and then I said to you,

4980
02:13:53.791 --> 02:13:55.410
hit me and I made money off of them.

4981
02:13:55.800 --> 02:13:58.380
Like there's creepy fucks out there that just try to manipulate the legal

4982
02:13:58.381 --> 02:13:58.860
system,

4983
02:13:58.860 --> 02:13:59.693
make cash.

4984
02:14:00.350 --> 02:14:02.150
<v 1>I'm just going to stay inside from now on.</v>

4985
02:14:02.180 --> 02:14:02.991
Do it Doug,

4986
02:14:02.991 --> 02:14:03.350
do it.

4987
02:14:03.350 --> 02:14:04.430
Don't be a pussy and no wheat.

4988
02:14:04.830 --> 02:14:06.740
Don't be gumming up your fucking insides.

4989
02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:09.530
Patent lawyers are kind of like that.

4990
02:14:09.860 --> 02:14:10.693
Sure.

4991
02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:12.110
A patent lawyers,

4992
02:14:12.111 --> 02:14:12.960
patent trolls.

4993
02:14:12.961 --> 02:14:13.794
Patton Oswalt.

4994
02:14:14.030 --> 02:14:14.301
Yeah,

4995
02:14:14.301 --> 02:14:14.601
those,

4996
02:14:14.601 --> 02:14:17.660
those assholes that we're going after podcasts called patent the troll.

4997
02:14:17.690 --> 02:14:17.811
No,

4998
02:14:17.811 --> 02:14:18.530
I love that guy.

4999
02:14:18.530 --> 02:14:19.760
How dare you see coming day,

5000
02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:20.633
but words,

5001
02:14:20.950 --> 02:14:21.470
I don't know.

5002
02:14:21.470 --> 02:14:23.510
He's hard to nail down these days as he fell.

5003
02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:25.040
I spray popular works a lot.

5004
02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:26.420
Do you watch justified?

5005
02:14:26.690 --> 02:14:26.960
No,

5006
02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:27.670
he was on a,

5007
02:14:27.670 --> 02:14:30.380
like a recurring character on the last season was died.

5008
02:14:30.390 --> 02:14:30.560
He,

5009
02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:31.580
it's a great show.

5010
02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:32.061
It's,

5011
02:14:32.061 --> 02:14:32.331
you know,

5012
02:14:32.331 --> 02:14:33.051
Elmore Leonard.

5013
02:14:33.051 --> 02:14:33.890
So it's really like,

5014
02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:34.760
you know,

5015
02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:35.271
tough.

5016
02:14:35.271 --> 02:14:39.350
And so it's based on an anemometer novel novel based on his writings.

5017
02:14:39.351 --> 02:14:41.630
And he wrote a lot of the episodes he passed away recently,

5018
02:14:41.631 --> 02:14:42.464
but uh,

5019
02:14:42.550 --> 02:14:43.140
he,

5020
02:14:43.140 --> 02:14:45.350
he was early involved in the show and it's,

5021
02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:46.070
uh,

5022
02:14:46.070 --> 02:14:46.281
it's,

5023
02:14:46.281 --> 02:14:46.791
I love it.

5024
02:14:46.791 --> 02:14:48.980
It's one of my favorite shows on TV.

5025
02:14:49.010 --> 02:14:50.340
What's his most famous Lamo?

5026
02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:53.940
Probably because of the movie was the most popular movie based on,

5027
02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:55.310
was not probably get shorty.

5028
02:14:55.460 --> 02:14:56.480
Yes.

5029
02:14:57.050 --> 02:14:57.920
Yes.

5030
02:14:58.160 --> 02:14:58.993
Did you ever read that?

5031
02:14:59.420 --> 02:14:59.691
No,

5032
02:14:59.691 --> 02:15:01.400
I've never really read any of his books,

5033
02:15:01.401 --> 02:15:04.220
but the plenty of things that have been adapted from his books,

5034
02:15:04.221 --> 02:15:08.570
especially the ones that he has a finger on a hand in like are really good.

5035
02:15:08.630 --> 02:15:09.081
Like he,

5036
02:15:09.081 --> 02:15:09.740
you know,

5037
02:15:09.740 --> 02:15:12.360
his books I imagine are like screenplays,

5038
02:15:12.380 --> 02:15:12.621
you know,

5039
02:15:12.621 --> 02:15:17.390
and have just lots of clever dialogue and interesting situations and characters.

5040
02:15:17.570 --> 02:15:18.380
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

5041
02:15:18.380 --> 02:15:21.710
We were going over the other day how many different movies,

5042
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:23.660
Stephen King books had been turned into.

5043
02:15:24.270 --> 02:15:24.631
<v 1>Oh,</v>

5044
02:15:24.631 --> 02:15:25.464
I can't wait to Sydney.

5045
02:15:25.530 --> 02:15:26.070
Did you come?

5046
02:15:26.070 --> 02:15:27.060
Did you find a number?

5047
02:15:27.061 --> 02:15:27.894
It looks crazy.

5048
02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:29.580
Number of Stephen King,

5049
02:15:29.590 --> 02:15:30.750
but he wasn't in the pot,

5050
02:15:30.780 --> 02:15:31.613
wasn't on the podcast.

5051
02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:33.450
We must be at least 50.

5052
02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:34.470
Yeah,

5053
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:35.490
there's be in that range.

5054
02:15:35.491 --> 02:15:35.941
There's a lot.

5055
02:15:35.941 --> 02:15:38.080
Plus there's a bunch of mini series for TV included.

5056
02:15:38.100 --> 02:15:39.690
The shining wangle ears.

5057
02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:41.520
It remember it Salem's lot.

5058
02:15:41.550 --> 02:15:42.270
Salem's lot.

5059
02:15:42.270 --> 02:15:42.601
Yeah.

5060
02:15:42.601 --> 02:15:43.590
A lot of a man.

5061
02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:44.520
Uh,

5062
02:15:44.610 --> 02:15:45.840
he might be the baddest motherfucker

5063
02:15:45.850 --> 02:15:47.380
<v 5>grove all time when it comes to fiction.</v>

5064
02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:49.630
I mean he really might be,

5065
02:15:49.750 --> 02:15:53.530
when you stop and think about how good some of his movies were thinner or how

5066
02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:57.340
good some of his books where he had some great fucking fiction books.

5067
02:15:57.520 --> 02:15:58.650
Really Fun.

5068
02:15:58.810 --> 02:16:01.970
<v 1>The shining is a fucking fantastic book.</v>

5069
02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:02.541
Yeah.

5070
02:16:02.541 --> 02:16:03.374
Well that was great.

5071
02:16:03.410 --> 02:16:04.131
That was the funny thing.

5072
02:16:04.131 --> 02:16:04.701
When the shining,

5073
02:16:04.701 --> 02:16:05.540
the movie came out,

5074
02:16:05.541 --> 02:16:07.370
it lovers of the book were really mad about it.

5075
02:16:07.371 --> 02:16:10.880
And then the shining kind of had to take on this life of its own and become

5076
02:16:10.881 --> 02:16:11.121
like,

5077
02:16:11.121 --> 02:16:12.560
it's like a separate classic,

5078
02:16:12.561 --> 02:16:12.831
you know,

5079
02:16:12.831 --> 02:16:15.320
cause it's a classic movie and the book is classic,

5080
02:16:15.321 --> 02:16:15.710
but they,

5081
02:16:15.710 --> 02:16:16.490
they really,

5082
02:16:16.490 --> 02:16:16.791
you know,

5083
02:16:16.791 --> 02:16:17.360
there's not,

5084
02:16:17.360 --> 02:16:20.840
they don't have a lot in common other than a family staying at a hotel over the

5085
02:16:20.841 --> 02:16:21.231
winter,

5086
02:16:21.231 --> 02:16:21.730
you know,

5087
02:16:21.730 --> 02:16:22.750
the transformation was and was

5088
02:16:22.750 --> 02:16:23.583
<v 5>much more,</v>

5089
02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:24.280
um,

5090
02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:26.500
much more slow in the book.

5091
02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:28.660
The transformation of Jack Too.

5092
02:16:28.780 --> 02:16:29.660
Jack Street

5093
02:16:30.190 --> 02:16:34.000
<v 2>crazy looks crazy when they're driving up to the place where he's going to do</v>

5094
02:16:34.001 --> 02:16:34.721
his first interview.

5095
02:16:34.721 --> 02:16:35.201
He's already like,

5096
02:16:35.201 --> 02:16:35.471
hey,

5097
02:16:35.471 --> 02:16:36.304
this is great

5098
02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:38.921
honey.

5099
02:16:38.921 --> 02:16:41.230
I just need to do my work and everything.

5100
02:16:41.410 --> 02:16:42.243
Fine.

5101
02:16:42.370 --> 02:16:42.941
There's a,

5102
02:16:42.941 --> 02:16:44.360
there's a lot of great uh,

5103
02:16:44.530 --> 02:16:45.340
conspiracy.

5104
02:16:45.340 --> 02:16:47.380
There's a movie called room two 37,

5105
02:16:47.710 --> 02:16:52.710
and it's all like shining the movie scholars and Kubrick scholars or you know,

5106
02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:55.480
at least so called they call themselves that.

5107
02:16:55.481 --> 02:16:55.991
But they,

5108
02:16:55.991 --> 02:16:56.824
um,

5109
02:16:56.950 --> 02:17:01.750
it's a whole movie of just talking at length about what all the hidden messages

5110
02:17:01.751 --> 02:17:02.584
in the shining,

5111
02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:03.311
you know,

5112
02:17:03.311 --> 02:17:04.144
cause like,

5113
02:17:04.210 --> 02:17:04.631
cause you know,

5114
02:17:04.631 --> 02:17:08.230
people like to say that Stanley Kubrick is the one who directed the fake fake

5115
02:17:08.231 --> 02:17:09.064
moon landing.

5116
02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:10.870
And in the,

5117
02:17:10.990 --> 02:17:15.820
in the shining little Danny wears a sweater that has a rocket ship on it that

5118
02:17:15.821 --> 02:17:16.900
says USA on it.

5119
02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:21.070
So everybody has jumped to the conclusion that he really did fake the moon

5120
02:17:21.071 --> 02:17:25.180
landing a footage and this was his fun way of a poking,

5121
02:17:25.220 --> 02:17:25.780
admitting,

5122
02:17:25.780 --> 02:17:26.613
admitting to it.

5123
02:17:26.660 --> 02:17:26.811
Well,

5124
02:17:26.811 --> 02:17:27.100
there's,

5125
02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:29.560
as opposed to he's making fun of the fact that people,

5126
02:17:30.340 --> 02:17:30.940
uh,

5127
02:17:30.940 --> 02:17:31.510
you know,

5128
02:17:31.510 --> 02:17:32.950
said that he faked the moon landing,

5129
02:17:32.951 --> 02:17:33.641
which it could be,

5130
02:17:33.641 --> 02:17:34.600
or it could just be,

5131
02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:38.410
it's a cute kid in a cute sweater that happens to have a rocket ship on it.

5132
02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:39.580
There was a bunch of parallels.

5133
02:17:39.581 --> 02:17:40.990
Apparently it wasn't just that one.

5134
02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:41.291
Oh yeah,

5135
02:17:41.291 --> 02:17:41.411
no,

5136
02:17:41.411 --> 02:17:42.280
there's a ton of stuff,

5137
02:17:42.281 --> 02:17:47.281
but it's gets so deep and so ridiculous like patterns in the carpeting and like

5138
02:17:48.460 --> 02:17:52.570
also throughout the movie when they're moving around from room to room in the

5139
02:17:52.571 --> 02:17:53.404
hotel,

5140
02:17:53.500 --> 02:17:57.340
like where they're going in from scene to scene doesn't match up.

5141
02:17:57.341 --> 02:18:00.190
So sometimes if they go down a hallway that's just a long hallway,

5142
02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:02.770
sometimes they head off in the same direction and it just in a kitchen,

5143
02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:03.431
you know,

5144
02:18:03.431 --> 02:18:04.170
like it's the,

5145
02:18:04.170 --> 02:18:05.003
the,

5146
02:18:05.640 --> 02:18:06.473
the um,

5147
02:18:06.910 --> 02:18:07.300
uh,

5148
02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:08.111
architecture,

5149
02:18:08.111 --> 02:18:08.321
you know,

5150
02:18:08.321 --> 02:18:10.760
the way the whole place is laid out is a,

5151
02:18:11.410 --> 02:18:12.161
doesn't make sense.

5152
02:18:12.161 --> 02:18:15.550
But that you could say that probably in a lot of movies because just the way

5153
02:18:15.551 --> 02:18:16.420
movies are shot,

5154
02:18:16.930 --> 02:18:17.291
you know,

5155
02:18:17.291 --> 02:18:19.150
like we'll use one side of the room for one season,

5156
02:18:19.151 --> 02:18:22.420
then we'll pretend the other side of the room somewhere else or whatever.

5157
02:18:22.750 --> 02:18:24.580
So it gets so deep.

5158
02:18:24.581 --> 02:18:26.140
But it's called room two 37.

5159
02:18:26.380 --> 02:18:30.000
And also you never see any of the people talking about these theories though.

5160
02:18:30.060 --> 02:18:34.360
The entire movie is just clips from the shining and then clips from other movies

5161
02:18:34.390 --> 02:18:36.550
that kind of reenact the things he's,

5162
02:18:36.610 --> 02:18:37.090
uh,

5163
02:18:37.090 --> 02:18:37.990
they're describing.

5164
02:18:38.220 --> 02:18:38.371
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

5165
02:18:38.371 --> 02:18:39.840
There's another one that I watched,

5166
02:18:39.870 --> 02:18:40.320
um,

5167
02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:41.820
by a guy named Jay Wiener.

5168
02:18:41.821 --> 02:18:43.380
It's called Kubrick's Odyssey,

5169
02:18:43.890 --> 02:18:46.440
a secrets hidden in the films of Stanley Kubrick,

5170
02:18:46.441 --> 02:18:48.450
part one Kubrick and Apollo.

5171
02:18:48.750 --> 02:18:53.730
And it's all about those connections with the Apollo Moon landings and Kubrick's

5172
02:18:53.731 --> 02:18:54.330
films.

5173
02:18:54.330 --> 02:18:56.070
And he even has,

5174
02:18:56.310 --> 02:18:56.980
uh,

5175
02:18:56.980 --> 02:18:57.330
uh,

5176
02:18:57.330 --> 02:19:02.330
some sort of a claim that the method that Kubrick used was the same method that

5177
02:19:02.521 --> 02:19:03.900
he used on 2001,

5178
02:19:04.260 --> 02:19:06.630
something called front screen projection,

5179
02:19:06.930 --> 02:19:07.231
some,

5180
02:19:07.231 --> 02:19:07.861
some type of,

5181
02:19:07.861 --> 02:19:08.820
something along those lines.

5182
02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:09.690
And uh,

5183
02:19:09.690 --> 02:19:10.231
he,

5184
02:19:10.231 --> 02:19:10.590
uh,

5185
02:19:10.590 --> 02:19:13.410
claims that they used it to a film,

5186
02:19:13.411 --> 02:19:15.660
certain scenes and the moon landings that he can prove it.

5187
02:19:16.980 --> 02:19:17.813
This guy was a,

5188
02:19:17.860 --> 02:19:18.660
he's a a,

5189
02:19:18.660 --> 02:19:22.200
these guys that go like way out like that I can have like,

5190
02:19:22.201 --> 02:19:27.201
and there was a 230 stairs at Jack walked up and he moved over to room two,

5191
02:19:27.411 --> 02:19:27.741
three,

5192
02:19:27.741 --> 02:19:28.100
six,

5193
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:31.610
<v 1>which is exactly the distance between the earth and the moon and hundreds of</v>

5194
02:19:31.610 --> 02:19:32.030
thousands of miles.

5195
02:19:32.030 --> 02:19:32.390
And you're like,

5196
02:19:32.390 --> 02:19:33.230
oh yeah,

5197
02:19:33.530 --> 02:19:35.150
they come up with some really good ones.

5198
02:19:35.240 --> 02:19:37.670
Like there's a poster for ski skiing,

5199
02:19:37.671 --> 02:19:37.941
you know,

5200
02:19:37.941 --> 02:19:39.950
like a advertising skiing on the wall.

5201
02:19:40.190 --> 02:19:44.300
But they say that the skier and the shape of it looks like a minute tar and uh,

5202
02:19:44.570 --> 02:19:45.351
and then they're like,

5203
02:19:45.351 --> 02:19:46.071
and they also say,

5204
02:19:46.071 --> 02:19:46.341
you know,

5205
02:19:46.341 --> 02:19:50.300
and why would there be a poster for skiing if the resort is closed every winter

5206
02:19:50.301 --> 02:19:52.190
because there's too much snow there and they don't,

5207
02:19:52.220 --> 02:19:53.690
the visitors can't get in and out.

5208
02:19:53.830 --> 02:19:54.800
So it's like,

5209
02:19:54.801 --> 02:19:55.071
yeah,

5210
02:19:55.071 --> 02:19:55.910
but they just,

5211
02:19:56.120 --> 02:19:58.520
Stanley Kubrick just put a dumb poster on the wall,

5212
02:19:58.521 --> 02:19:58.761
you know,

5213
02:19:58.761 --> 02:19:59.660
like it's that,

5214
02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:00.531
you know,

5215
02:20:00.531 --> 02:20:01.760
an art director on the set,

5216
02:20:01.790 --> 02:20:05.390
you know anybody on the set just put that poster there cause it was a ugly blank

5217
02:20:05.391 --> 02:20:06.380
wall or something.

5218
02:20:06.410 --> 02:20:07.040
Exactly.

5219
02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:10.640
It's like they think they think way too hard about every little choice that the

5220
02:20:10.641 --> 02:20:15.641
distance between the earth and the moon varies and moves around a little bit to

5221
02:20:15.900 --> 02:20:16.461
stay at two,

5222
02:20:16.461 --> 02:20:16.671
three,

5223
02:20:16.671 --> 02:20:17.081
six.

5224
02:20:17.081 --> 02:20:20.030
Oh there it goes farther and I'm pretty sure the distance between the earth and

5225
02:20:20.031 --> 02:20:20.541
the moon varies.

5226
02:20:20.541 --> 02:20:21.770
Let's look at that distance.

5227
02:20:22.750 --> 02:20:23.350
Did you,

5228
02:20:23.350 --> 02:20:24.920
are you going to see that carry remake?

5229
02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:25.641
Yeah,

5230
02:20:25.641 --> 02:20:27.920
he was just saying that he looks great.

5231
02:20:27.980 --> 02:20:28.520
To me.

5232
02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:29.810
That's a little bit,

5233
02:20:29.811 --> 02:20:30.650
it's sacrilege.

5234
02:20:32.140 --> 02:20:34.700
It doesn't editing the original one,

5235
02:20:34.740 --> 02:20:35.450
you know,

5236
02:20:35.450 --> 02:20:36.230
girls carry,

5237
02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:36.411
no,

5238
02:20:36.411 --> 02:20:38.180
it's going to be more straight forward than the original.

5239
02:20:38.181 --> 02:20:39.740
The original is such a unique movie.

5240
02:20:39.741 --> 02:20:43.180
It's got so many weird Depalma isms in it and um,

5241
02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:45.260
and this new one's just going to be,

5242
02:20:45.261 --> 02:20:47.630
I think it's just going to be as straight forward telling of the,

5243
02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:48.291
you know,

5244
02:20:48.291 --> 02:20:49.580
the exact same story.

5245
02:20:50.180 --> 02:20:50.421
Oh,

5246
02:20:50.421 --> 02:20:52.730
so it's just the same movie.

5247
02:20:53.300 --> 02:20:53.660
Yeah.

5248
02:20:53.660 --> 02:20:54.201
But without,

5249
02:20:54.201 --> 02:20:54.650
you know,

5250
02:20:54.650 --> 02:20:55.610
without diplomas,

5251
02:20:55.640 --> 02:20:56.331
wacky,

5252
02:20:56.331 --> 02:20:56.920
you know,

5253
02:20:56.920 --> 02:20:59.320
<v 4>the marketing for it is fucking awesome.</v>

5254
02:20:59.330 --> 02:21:00.670
You see that video that they,

5255
02:21:00.671 --> 02:21:03.430
a viral video that they release that's going out right now.

5256
02:21:03.431 --> 02:21:04.061
It's crazy.

5257
02:21:04.061 --> 02:21:07.420
When they took a coffee shop and they set it up with,

5258
02:21:07.421 --> 02:21:07.810
uh,

5259
02:21:07.810 --> 02:21:11.530
they pretty much built the whole thing and they had like this track running up

5260
02:21:11.531 --> 02:21:16.120
the side of this wall so this guy can get thrown up and like pushed up and like

5261
02:21:16.121 --> 02:21:18.040
they have a remote control tables.

5262
02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:21.390
And so what they did is they did all this shit and they wouldn't,

5263
02:21:21.391 --> 02:21:23.920
when people are coming in to get coffee,

5264
02:21:24.170 --> 02:21:24.640
uh,

5265
02:21:24.640 --> 02:21:26.170
they just started fucking with people.

5266
02:21:26.290 --> 02:21:27.760
<v 8>This was Carrie did this,</v>

5267
02:21:27.761 --> 02:21:28.740
the movie Carrie.

5268
02:21:28.750 --> 02:21:29.200
Yeah.

5269
02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:31.690
That's so smart and it's really good.

5270
02:21:31.750 --> 02:21:33.460
Like this is probably one of the best pranks.

5271
02:21:33.550 --> 02:21:33.940
And why?

5272
02:21:33.940 --> 02:21:35.370
Like those are all actors around here.

5273
02:21:37.160 --> 02:21:37.993
I'm sorry.

5274
02:21:41.170 --> 02:21:41.440
No,

5275
02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:42.400
she's an actress.

5276
02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:45.940
There's coffee inside of my computer.

5277
02:21:47.020 --> 02:21:47.920
Just get away from me.

5278
02:21:58.090 --> 02:22:01.420
<v 9>I would have felt the set with more of those real freaking out</v>

5279
02:22:04.610 --> 02:22:05.361
automatically.

5280
02:22:05.361 --> 02:22:06.320
I would start laughing.

5281
02:22:06.750 --> 02:22:07.790
He started laughing.

5282
02:22:07.791 --> 02:22:08.151
Yeah.

5283
02:22:08.151 --> 02:22:08.750
I'd be like,

5284
02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:10.070
oh,

5285
02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:10.993
okay.

5286
02:22:11.330 --> 02:22:12.920
<v 8>When thing that he flies on,</v>

5287
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:14.570
it's got a big line on it.

5288
02:22:14.930 --> 02:22:15.111
See,

5289
02:22:15.111 --> 02:22:18.770
I wouldn't have him down five more of those because right now it just looks like

5290
02:22:18.771 --> 02:22:19.700
he's on a track.

5291
02:22:19.701 --> 02:22:19.971
You know,

5292
02:22:19.971 --> 02:22:22.820
it looks like one of those carnival things you hit and then we tried to ring the

5293
02:22:22.821 --> 02:22:23.240
bell.

5294
02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:23.630
Right.

5295
02:22:23.630 --> 02:22:25.070
That's how you feel Brian.

5296
02:22:25.100 --> 02:22:25.933
But that guy,

5297
02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:28.170
<v 9>it would be crazy.</v>

5298
02:22:28.290 --> 02:22:30.330
I like the way they tables all spread out.

5299
02:22:30.331 --> 02:22:32.250
It's like the scariest part actually

5300
02:22:34.290 --> 02:22:35.910
that one to recording and she's like,

5301
02:22:35.911 --> 02:22:36.744
what the fuck?

5302
02:22:37.050 --> 02:22:37.291
Yeah.

5303
02:22:37.291 --> 02:22:38.124
Some of the record.

5304
02:22:38.130 --> 02:22:39.090
Anything these days,

5305
02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:41.431
you know,

5306
02:22:41.431 --> 02:22:41.600
it's,

5307
02:22:41.600 --> 02:22:41.910
it's a,

5308
02:22:41.910 --> 02:22:44.310
it's an interesting book.

5309
02:22:44.880 --> 02:22:45.180
<v 1>Um,</v>

5310
02:22:45.180 --> 02:22:47.620
the book is amazing and it was the big hit for,

5311
02:22:47.650 --> 02:22:48.540
for Stephen King.

5312
02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:51.120
The book was the book that got him out of poverty.

5313
02:22:51.780 --> 02:22:52.350
And uh,

5314
02:22:52.350 --> 02:22:54.030
it's interesting because he had thrown it out.

5315
02:22:54.930 --> 02:22:57.560
He had written some and throwing it out and he decided like,

5316
02:22:57.570 --> 02:22:59.010
he didn't know what it was like to go to the prom.

5317
02:22:59.011 --> 02:23:01.110
He didn't know whether or not the girls would do that.

5318
02:23:01.111 --> 02:23:02.850
And the guy would go to the prom with her.

5319
02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:04.680
He didn't understand the emotions behind it,

5320
02:23:04.681 --> 02:23:06.240
like coming from as a woman.

5321
02:23:06.540 --> 02:23:09.570
And so he was gonna toss it and then his wife pulled it out a trash,

5322
02:23:09.571 --> 02:23:12.510
like he was out of the house and she started reading it and then she said,

5323
02:23:12.511 --> 02:23:13.344
stick with this.

5324
02:23:14.550 --> 02:23:14.940
Wow,

5325
02:23:14.940 --> 02:23:15.451
that's good.

5326
02:23:15.451 --> 02:23:16.620
That's where that my good wife,

5327
02:23:16.650 --> 02:23:17.170
that's what that book,

5328
02:23:17.170 --> 02:23:18.630
and I know his first wife,

5329
02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:19.860
we still wear this first one.

5330
02:23:20.460 --> 02:23:25.460
The distance varies from the earth to the moon by 43,592 kilometers.

5331
02:23:25.890 --> 02:23:26.520
So yeah,

5332
02:23:26.520 --> 02:23:27.540
it varies a lot.

5333
02:23:28.710 --> 02:23:30.420
43,000 kilometers.

5334
02:23:30.421 --> 02:23:33.660
That's like 20 something thousand miles.

5335
02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:35.820
It's a lot of fucking miles dog.

5336
02:23:36.940 --> 02:23:37.410
Yeah.

5337
02:23:37.410 --> 02:23:38.070
So it does.

5338
02:23:38.070 --> 02:23:40.530
Stephen King hasn't had as many adaptations,

5339
02:23:40.531 --> 02:23:42.800
is that thousand kilometers and whatnot.

5340
02:23:42.810 --> 02:23:43.561
What's Brian Doing?

5341
02:23:43.561 --> 02:23:44.370
Hundreds of both.

5342
02:23:44.370 --> 02:23:45.930
So that that number two,

5343
02:23:45.931 --> 02:23:48.270
three six or two three seven the distance of the earth.

5344
02:23:48.271 --> 02:23:48.930
The moon.

5345
02:23:48.930 --> 02:23:49.290
What?

5346
02:23:49.290 --> 02:23:49.920
Oh yeah.

5347
02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:50.753
What are you doing?

5348
02:23:50.850 --> 02:23:53.970
That's 26,700 miles.

5349
02:23:55.620 --> 02:23:56.070
Boom.

5350
02:23:56.070 --> 02:23:56.740
There we go.

5351
02:23:56.740 --> 02:23:57.060
Thanks.

5352
02:23:57.060 --> 02:24:02.060
What is it like a one mile I think is 2.2 or 2.2 kilometers is one mile.

5353
02:24:02.340 --> 02:24:03.330
So a hundred kilometers.

5354
02:24:03.340 --> 02:24:05.430
Just 62 miles an hour I think.

5355
02:24:06.250 --> 02:24:10.350
I think that goes cause they do that with zero to sixties with European cars.

5356
02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:13.350
You know when they tell you the performance numbers they did.

5357
02:24:13.351 --> 02:24:16.740
They break it down to kilometers and kilometers per hour per second.

5358
02:24:18.330 --> 02:24:21.380
The Oh they're too much for you Doug Benson.

5359
02:24:21.850 --> 02:24:22.710
They blow a fuse.

5360
02:24:22.770 --> 02:24:24.150
I think his seven bottles.

5361
02:24:24.990 --> 02:24:26.100
I'm still thinking about,

5362
02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:29.730
I'm thinking about the new version of carry and how I don't,

5363
02:24:29.970 --> 02:24:30.803
you don't want it?

5364
02:24:31.590 --> 02:24:32.510
I don't,

5365
02:24:32.540 --> 02:24:33.021
I hate,

5366
02:24:33.021 --> 02:24:36.360
I hate being against it to be honest with you cause I like the idea of it,

5367
02:24:36.780 --> 02:24:37.800
but it's just like,

5368
02:24:38.100 --> 02:24:39.180
to me it's just going to be,

5369
02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:43.200
I guess I should look at it like a play where you like the play and then you,

5370
02:24:43.410 --> 02:24:46.620
you can see more than like I've seen who's afraid of Virginia Woolf a couple of

5371
02:24:46.621 --> 02:24:50.040
times with different castes and it's like different people emerge as the

5372
02:24:50.041 --> 02:24:53.760
strongest characters and you know that you see different things in the writing

5373
02:24:53.761 --> 02:24:55.230
because of different performances.

5374
02:24:55.590 --> 02:24:59.700
But it just seems like Julianne Moore and that girl Chloe marets or just sort of

5375
02:24:59.701 --> 02:25:03.450
forced to kind of go through the motions of being like the two people in the

5376
02:25:03.451 --> 02:25:04.284
first movie.

5377
02:25:04.620 --> 02:25:05.520
I mean as it was so big,

5378
02:25:05.521 --> 02:25:09.180
she's just a religious zealot is yelling at her all the time and eventually the

5379
02:25:09.181 --> 02:25:13.440
daughter starts getting some cutlery out and making it fly across the room.

5380
02:25:13.441 --> 02:25:14.191
And yeah,

5381
02:25:14.191 --> 02:25:16.710
it's kind of different than like King Kong when they redo King Kong,

5382
02:25:16.770 --> 02:25:21.770
they have to have the Fay Wray character and that's the original Carrie depalma

5383
02:25:22.350 --> 02:25:25.240
had tons of like split screens and like,

5384
02:25:25.270 --> 02:25:25.690
uh,

5385
02:25:25.690 --> 02:25:26.051
you know,

5386
02:25:26.051 --> 02:25:29.680
lots of a wacky stuff that he used to do all the time.

5387
02:25:30.340 --> 02:25:30.591
And it's,

5388
02:25:30.591 --> 02:25:31.750
so it's got a really unique,

5389
02:25:31.751 --> 02:25:32.970
and then sissy spaces,

5390
02:25:33.700 --> 02:25:35.020
this girl in the new one is like,

5391
02:25:35.140 --> 02:25:36.250
she's an outcast.

5392
02:25:36.251 --> 02:25:37.090
She's gorgeous.

5393
02:25:37.091 --> 02:25:38.860
Like she's a cute girl and like,

5394
02:25:38.890 --> 02:25:39.580
you know,

5395
02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:41.140
how messed up is she that she,

5396
02:25:41.170 --> 02:25:42.003
you know,

5397
02:25:42.390 --> 02:25:43.223
uh,

5398
02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:46.210
I assume she has the same incident in the beginning of the movie where she gets

5399
02:25:46.211 --> 02:25:47.560
her period in front of everybody.

5400
02:25:48.430 --> 02:25:49.263
They don't have,

5401
02:25:50.170 --> 02:25:52.340
they don't have a sissy space,

5402
02:25:52.341 --> 02:25:53.860
like type actresses anymore.

5403
02:25:54.180 --> 02:25:54.431
I mean,

5404
02:25:54.431 --> 02:25:55.120
what actress?

5405
02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:55.481
That's what I,

5406
02:25:55.481 --> 02:25:56.530
that's what somebody said to me.

5407
02:25:56.531 --> 02:25:56.801
They're like,

5408
02:25:56.801 --> 02:25:57.511
do you think Sissy space?

5409
02:25:57.511 --> 02:25:58.271
It's ugly.

5410
02:25:58.271 --> 02:25:58.871
And I said,

5411
02:25:58.871 --> 02:25:59.141
no,

5412
02:25:59.141 --> 02:25:59.861
she's not ugly.

5413
02:25:59.861 --> 02:26:04.420
But she's ugly enough that when in these early scenes it's believable.

5414
02:26:04.421 --> 02:26:05.470
And then when she's at the Prom,

5415
02:26:05.471 --> 02:26:07.930
she actually looks pretty greatest American hero.

5416
02:26:07.970 --> 02:26:08.500
Remember that?

5417
02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:08.681
Yeah.

5418
02:26:08.681 --> 02:26:08.861
Yeah.

5419
02:26:08.861 --> 02:26:09.694
William Katt,

5420
02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:12.040
that guy was the first guy that I've ever met.

5421
02:26:12.180 --> 02:26:12.350
Uh,

5422
02:26:12.350 --> 02:26:14.170
that was famous when I was in la.

5423
02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:15.430
He was in front of me at Starbucks and,

5424
02:26:15.431 --> 02:26:15.650
you know,

5425
02:26:15.650 --> 02:26:17.170
gut was he nice?

5426
02:26:17.171 --> 02:26:18.004
Like wow,

5427
02:26:18.970 --> 02:26:20.230
I shouldn't say meet me at my first one.

5428
02:26:20.250 --> 02:26:21.280
Your first sighting.

5429
02:26:21.790 --> 02:26:22.623
My first sighting.

5430
02:26:22.630 --> 02:26:22.841
Yeah.

5431
02:26:22.841 --> 02:26:23.051
See,

5432
02:26:23.051 --> 02:26:24.350
look at they go to the split screens.

5433
02:26:24.351 --> 02:26:24.640
Right.

5434
02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:26.470
I forgot about the split screen shit.

5435
02:26:27.300 --> 02:26:30.700
And it was a look at that crazy hose.

5436
02:26:30.970 --> 02:26:31.870
People getting into host.

5437
02:26:31.871 --> 02:26:36.000
I don't know if that's going to happen in this new one back then it was weird

5438
02:26:36.130 --> 02:26:37.240
fucking movie man.

5439
02:26:37.630 --> 02:26:38.400
Weird movie.

5440
02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:38.591
No,

5441
02:26:38.591 --> 02:26:42.630
he made it really kind of artsy fartsy movie out of a lot of just basically

5442
02:26:42.730 --> 02:26:43.030
yeah.

5443
02:26:43.030 --> 02:26:45.130
Straight forward a book,

5444
02:26:45.131 --> 02:26:45.964
you know.

5445
02:26:46.410 --> 02:26:47.243
Um,

5446
02:26:48.310 --> 02:26:48.581
wow.

5447
02:26:48.581 --> 02:26:49.840
I forgot Travolta was in it.

5448
02:26:50.440 --> 02:26:51.273
Yeah.

5449
02:26:51.820 --> 02:26:53.260
It was a good fucking movie man.

5450
02:26:53.970 --> 02:26:56.080
And especially for the time time it was a,

5451
02:26:56.170 --> 02:26:57.670
or as a big hit and it's like,

5452
02:26:57.700 --> 02:26:59.590
and it's a reference point,

5453
02:26:59.591 --> 02:26:59.891
you know,

5454
02:26:59.891 --> 02:27:01.420
like don't take care to the prom,

5455
02:27:01.421 --> 02:27:01.721
you know,

5456
02:27:01.721 --> 02:27:04.450
like pig's blood being dumped on you.

5457
02:27:04.930 --> 02:27:05.111
Like,

5458
02:27:05.111 --> 02:27:06.630
people make references to it to,

5459
02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:06.911
you know,

5460
02:27:06.911 --> 02:27:07.421
to this day,

5461
02:27:07.421 --> 02:27:09.590
even though the original movie doesn't yeah.

5462
02:27:09.610 --> 02:27:10.870
It doesn't get a lot of play.

5463
02:27:11.230 --> 02:27:11.501
No,

5464
02:27:11.501 --> 02:27:11.951
that's true.

5465
02:27:11.951 --> 02:27:12.530
Yeah.

5466
02:27:12.530 --> 02:27:14.470
When you're talking about a girl going crazy and psycho,

5467
02:27:14.471 --> 02:27:14.870
she goes,

5468
02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:16.570
she'll go care and you don't go Carrie.

5469
02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:17.230
Yeah.

5470
02:27:17.230 --> 02:27:18.063
And uh,

5471
02:27:18.100 --> 02:27:19.240
the book's incredible though.

5472
02:27:19.540 --> 02:27:20.500
It's really good.

5473
02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:20.891
Yeah.

5474
02:27:20.891 --> 02:27:21.551
I was,

5475
02:27:21.551 --> 02:27:22.840
I was super into Stephen King.

5476
02:27:22.841 --> 02:27:26.560
I wrote a letter to Stephen King about how much I didn't like Kubrick's the

5477
02:27:26.561 --> 02:27:28.630
shining and he wrote back,

5478
02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:31.210
typed on a postcard.

5479
02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:34.840
Like he would just sit and type back letters to fans and he wrote back and you

5480
02:27:34.841 --> 02:27:36.040
still have that a very,

5481
02:27:36.041 --> 02:27:36.401
yeah,

5482
02:27:36.401 --> 02:27:38.320
he wrote a very diplomatic response,

5483
02:27:38.321 --> 02:27:39.071
which is just like,

5484
02:27:39.071 --> 02:27:39.311
you know,

5485
02:27:39.311 --> 02:27:39.611
I don't,

5486
02:27:39.611 --> 02:27:42.910
I don't control what happens to my books when they're made into movies,

5487
02:27:43.210 --> 02:27:43.900
but he was,

5488
02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:45.940
it was well known that at the time that came out,

5489
02:27:45.941 --> 02:27:47.110
he thought he hated it.

5490
02:27:47.111 --> 02:27:48.490
Like he was angry about it.

5491
02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:51.710
Well that's why they did that remake where they did it on television.

5492
02:27:51.740 --> 02:27:53.410
They did it much truer to the book.

5493
02:27:53.530 --> 02:27:53.830
Yeah.

5494
02:27:53.830 --> 02:27:56.530
And then still not a very good movie just because of other choices that were

5495
02:27:56.531 --> 02:27:56.741
made.

5496
02:27:56.741 --> 02:27:59.560
Like the kid that got to play the kid was an annoying kid,

5497
02:27:59.561 --> 02:28:00.250
actor,

5498
02:28:00.250 --> 02:28:00.731
you know,

5499
02:28:00.731 --> 02:28:00.971
and,

5500
02:28:00.971 --> 02:28:04.270
and so he wasn't engaging central character.

5501
02:28:04.300 --> 02:28:05.440
Did you like the guy from wings?

5502
02:28:05.470 --> 02:28:06.340
Stephen Weber.

5503
02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:07.150
Yeah,

5504
02:28:07.150 --> 02:28:07.751
he was all right,

5505
02:28:07.751 --> 02:28:08.584
I guess.

5506
02:28:08.620 --> 02:28:09.191
But I just didn't,

5507
02:28:09.191 --> 02:28:09.690
I,

5508
02:28:09.690 --> 02:28:12.880
I haven't liked to single made for TV.

5509
02:28:12.881 --> 02:28:14.770
Stephen King from beginning to end.

5510
02:28:14.771 --> 02:28:16.240
There's parts that are good.

5511
02:28:16.241 --> 02:28:16.721
Like it,

5512
02:28:16.721 --> 02:28:18.700
like the pennywise looked cool.

5513
02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:20.410
It was really scary looking,

5514
02:28:20.411 --> 02:28:22.430
but I thought the movie was too silly.

5515
02:28:22.660 --> 02:28:22.790
<v 3>Well,</v>

5516
02:28:22.790 --> 02:28:23.380
it's also the,

5517
02:28:23.380 --> 02:28:25.820
you're trying to make a movie out of a book,

5518
02:28:25.821 --> 02:28:29.030
but instead you're making like this mini series thing.

5519
02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:29.440
Yeah.

5520
02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:30.620
Which takes many,

5521
02:28:30.620 --> 02:28:31.610
many hours to why get out.

5522
02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:33.420
And a lot of times they lose the,

5523
02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:33.920
the,

5524
02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:36.560
the dynamic energy of a movie.

5525
02:28:36.561 --> 02:28:36.801
You know,

5526
02:28:36.801 --> 02:28:38.510
if you're sitting and watching a movie,

5527
02:28:38.870 --> 02:28:40.400
movies have beginnings,

5528
02:28:40.430 --> 02:28:42.160
middles and ends and you're,

5529
02:28:42.180 --> 02:28:44.420
you take them all in one chunk books,

5530
02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:47.450
you let it sort of unravel in your day.

5531
02:28:47.630 --> 02:28:47.931
You know,

5532
02:28:47.931 --> 02:28:49.140
you'd read when you can,

5533
02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:49.881
you come back to it,

5534
02:28:49.881 --> 02:28:51.440
you get right back into it and it's fine.

5535
02:28:51.610 --> 02:28:52.930
People usually don't watch movies,

5536
02:28:53.010 --> 02:28:53.421
movies,

5537
02:28:53.421 --> 02:28:54.650
one chapter at a time.

5538
02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:55.010
Yeah.

5539
02:28:55.010 --> 02:28:58.790
So when you're watching an hour a week or an hour a day for three days or

5540
02:28:58.791 --> 02:28:59.120
whatever,

5541
02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:01.670
however the fuck they did it where they had it as a mini series,

5542
02:29:01.700 --> 02:29:02.930
it just doesn't work that,

5543
02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:03.050
yeah.

5544
02:29:03.050 --> 02:29:05.630
Like I didn't think the standard mini series was terribly good.

5545
02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:06.823
I didn't see that.

5546
02:29:06.890 --> 02:29:07.723
Who was in that?

5547
02:29:07.970 --> 02:29:08.390
Um,

5548
02:29:08.390 --> 02:29:12.020
I think the main guy was played by a Jamey Sheridan.

5549
02:29:12.190 --> 02:29:13.610
Don't show this because I want to see that movie.

5550
02:29:13.611 --> 02:29:13.941
I don't want,

5551
02:29:13.941 --> 02:29:16.130
I hate watch trailers are the worse these days.

5552
02:29:16.190 --> 02:29:17.690
Like if I'm really excited about moving,

5553
02:29:17.691 --> 02:29:18.441
I'll just not,

5554
02:29:18.441 --> 02:29:19.490
but you're just avoid the trigger.

5555
02:29:19.510 --> 02:29:20.000
Right.

5556
02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.050
The reason I was watching it because I'm so in love with that,

5557
02:29:22.100 --> 02:29:23.060
that girl in that movie,

5558
02:29:23.061 --> 02:29:24.380
she's just beautiful chick.

5559
02:29:24.381 --> 02:29:25.550
So I don't buy that at all.

5560
02:29:25.551 --> 02:29:26.720
The plainness and like,

5561
02:29:27.130 --> 02:29:27.430
yeah.

5562
02:29:27.430 --> 02:29:29.060
I mean they have to change it to that.

5563
02:29:29.061 --> 02:29:31.280
Everybody hates her because she's better than all of them.

5564
02:29:32.510 --> 02:29:33.343
That's so stupid.

5565
02:29:33.730 --> 02:29:34.790
That's what I was going to say about,

5566
02:29:34.820 --> 02:29:35.060
uh,

5567
02:29:35.060 --> 02:29:35.811
when somebody said,

5568
02:29:35.811 --> 02:29:37.910
you don't think Sissy spakes it's basics beautiful.

5569
02:29:37.940 --> 02:29:38.301
It's like,

5570
02:29:38.301 --> 02:29:38.721
well no,

5571
02:29:38.721 --> 02:29:39.650
she's not ugly.

5572
02:29:39.650 --> 02:29:44.510
But she also was not on a cosmopolitan teen when Keri came out.

5573
02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:47.600
She was an actress who was chosen because she could,

5574
02:29:47.840 --> 02:29:50.060
could seem like a religious nut outcast.

5575
02:29:50.320 --> 02:29:50.660
Yeah.

5576
02:29:50.660 --> 02:29:51.830
She's very pale.

5577
02:29:51.831 --> 02:29:55.160
Her eyebrows or this girl girl now is the girl of the moment.

5578
02:29:55.161 --> 02:29:55.611
So they're just,

5579
02:29:55.611 --> 02:29:57.500
well she's got to play Carrie cause she's,

5580
02:29:57.800 --> 02:29:58.071
you know,

5581
02:29:58.071 --> 02:29:58.461
we want,

5582
02:29:58.461 --> 02:30:01.250
we only want to bet on horses that are going to win and she's,

5583
02:30:01.310 --> 02:30:02.990
she's a good actress that people like.

5584
02:30:03.110 --> 02:30:04.940
But the problem is I don't think that works,

5585
02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:05.511
you know?

5586
02:30:05.511 --> 02:30:05.781
I mean,

5587
02:30:05.781 --> 02:30:08.840
I'm not saying that she can't pull it off and maybe she does it awesome.

5588
02:30:08.841 --> 02:30:12.170
But I don't think people go to see movies because of the fucking stars in it.

5589
02:30:12.530 --> 02:30:12.771
You know?

5590
02:30:12.771 --> 02:30:15.200
I don't think people want to see avatar because that Australian dude,

5591
02:30:15.530 --> 02:30:16.790
nobody knows who that guy is.

5592
02:30:16.820 --> 02:30:18.350
Oh absolutely know that he works.

5593
02:30:18.530 --> 02:30:21.620
But they went to see avatar because it was avatar because it was a bad ass

5594
02:30:21.621 --> 02:30:22.160
movie.

5595
02:30:22.160 --> 02:30:23.840
Stars can push something over the hump,

5596
02:30:23.841 --> 02:30:24.051
you know,

5597
02:30:24.051 --> 02:30:24.291
like,

5598
02:30:24.291 --> 02:30:24.920
like,

5599
02:30:24.920 --> 02:30:26.450
like the heat we were talking about earlier.

5600
02:30:26.451 --> 02:30:29.030
If that wasn't Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy,

5601
02:30:29.060 --> 02:30:29.750
it could,

5602
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:31.280
it could easily just not be a thing.

5603
02:30:31.300 --> 02:30:31.520
Right.

5604
02:30:31.520 --> 02:30:32.750
So if it sucks,

5605
02:30:32.900 --> 02:30:33.733
it's okay.

5606
02:30:34.270 --> 02:30:34.640
Well,

5607
02:30:34.640 --> 02:30:35.690
big name actor,

5608
02:30:35.691 --> 02:30:36.350
that's what you're saying.

5609
02:30:36.350 --> 02:30:36.471
Well,

5610
02:30:36.471 --> 02:30:37.370
I'm just saying that they,

5611
02:30:37.371 --> 02:30:41.750
the unfortunate system needs insurance policies all the time.

5612
02:30:41.751 --> 02:30:44.270
So they only want to work with the people that have already made a lot of money,

5613
02:30:44.271 --> 02:30:47.720
but all those people were in a surprise hit at some point and that's why they

5614
02:30:47.721 --> 02:30:49.910
are now bankable stars.

5615
02:30:49.911 --> 02:30:50.181
You know,

5616
02:30:50.181 --> 02:30:52.900
like when they hired Sandra Bullock for speed,

5617
02:30:52.901 --> 02:30:53.170
they,

5618
02:30:53.170 --> 02:30:53.541
you know,

5619
02:30:53.541 --> 02:30:54.081
that was probably,

5620
02:30:54.081 --> 02:30:56.360
they were just looking for a young actress who could,

5621
02:30:56.570 --> 02:30:56.900
you know,

5622
02:30:56.900 --> 02:30:57.471
fill the role.

5623
02:30:57.471 --> 02:31:01.910
Cause I already had a star in Keanu Reeves and then she busted out.

5624
02:31:01.911 --> 02:31:05.090
And it's been a huge thing ever since he just counted the chemistry that they

5625
02:31:05.091 --> 02:31:05.924
had,

5626
02:31:06.380 --> 02:31:07.430
the chemistry that they shared.

5627
02:31:08.090 --> 02:31:08.923
Um,

5628
02:31:09.290 --> 02:31:09.860
she's,

5629
02:31:09.860 --> 02:31:10.311
I mean,

5630
02:31:10.311 --> 02:31:13.340
I thought she was adorable and speed and I saw these and waiting for her to make

5631
02:31:13.341 --> 02:31:14.690
a good movie until gravity.

5632
02:31:14.691 --> 02:31:15.590
It finally happened.

5633
02:31:15.920 --> 02:31:17.480
So these images of Kiana Reeves,

5634
02:31:17.660 --> 02:31:20.110
poor guys apparently gained weight and so like

5635
02:31:20.370 --> 02:31:22.380
<v 5>people are taking photos of him.</v>

5636
02:31:22.570 --> 02:31:24.480
I can't go Keanu Reeves fat.

5637
02:31:24.930 --> 02:31:25.650
No,

5638
02:31:25.650 --> 02:31:26.310
I just don't.

5639
02:31:26.310 --> 02:31:27.400
A couple of weeks ago he looks great.

5640
02:31:28.080 --> 02:31:31.920
Maybe there's a fake FAP key and a got this movie man of Tai Chi that he

5641
02:31:31.921 --> 02:31:33.440
directed where he also,

5642
02:31:33.650 --> 02:31:35.130
he also plays the villain in it.

5643
02:31:35.520 --> 02:31:35.671
Oh,

5644
02:31:35.671 --> 02:31:36.570
it's a fake guy.

5645
02:31:36.650 --> 02:31:37.483
Oh,

5646
02:31:37.920 --> 02:31:38.581
fake fat.

5647
02:31:38.581 --> 02:31:42.870
Keanu fake look like the fat and old on suicide.

5648
02:31:42.871 --> 02:31:45.100
Watch calories get fat to it.

5649
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:46.260
So is it him or not?

5650
02:31:47.460 --> 02:31:48.293
Whoa.

5651
02:31:49.380 --> 02:31:50.840
Well hmm.

5652
02:31:50.910 --> 02:31:51.661
This is weird.

5653
02:31:51.661 --> 02:31:56.100
Canneries is 48 do's loud to get punchy has been alleged,

5654
02:31:56.130 --> 02:31:57.660
which it looks like he's happily doing.

5655
02:31:57.840 --> 02:31:59.490
Judging from these photos at Cannes.

5656
02:32:00.490 --> 02:32:03.260
Maybe he had his shirt off and he's a little listen to this show.

5657
02:32:04.710 --> 02:32:04.980
No,

5658
02:32:04.980 --> 02:32:06.000
he doesn't have a shirt off.

5659
02:32:06.630 --> 02:32:07.111
Fuck.

5660
02:32:07.111 --> 02:32:08.790
That's for a role or something.

5661
02:32:08.820 --> 02:32:10.350
There's no way he looked like that.

5662
02:32:10.351 --> 02:32:12.330
It can work in May of this year.

5663
02:32:12.930 --> 02:32:13.531
No Way.

5664
02:32:13.531 --> 02:32:15.780
Someone is in love with Kiana raise.

5665
02:32:15.780 --> 02:32:16.081
We just,

5666
02:32:16.081 --> 02:32:18.810
how did you buddy Google Keanu Reeves at fantastic fest.

5667
02:32:18.811 --> 02:32:21.960
He was there in front of me doing a Q and a and that's not what he looked like.

5668
02:32:22.110 --> 02:32:23.390
So you think it's Photoshop?

5669
02:32:23.850 --> 02:32:24.810
It's either or.

5670
02:32:24.811 --> 02:32:27.660
He played a fat guy in something and people got pictures of it.

5671
02:32:27.670 --> 02:32:28.503
At what fest?

5672
02:32:29.240 --> 02:32:32.370
I remember the time Matthew mcconaughey went nuts on the beach with some palm

5673
02:32:32.371 --> 02:32:35.940
fronds and was running around and it was on TMZ and stuff that he was whacked

5674
02:32:35.941 --> 02:32:36.091
out of.

5675
02:32:36.091 --> 02:32:37.500
His mind went around on the beach.

5676
02:32:38.220 --> 02:32:38.761
That was,

5677
02:32:38.761 --> 02:32:42.930
he was shooting a film and that was a scene in the film where he did that and

5678
02:32:42.931 --> 02:32:44.490
people just put it out there like,

5679
02:32:44.970 --> 02:32:47.630
or they did it at my other great example is when I'm see,

5680
02:32:47.650 --> 02:32:48.483
look at him.

5681
02:32:49.100 --> 02:32:49.311
Okay,

5682
02:32:49.311 --> 02:32:50.420
so how long ago is this?

5683
02:32:50.440 --> 02:32:52.620
A month ago or two weeks ago.

5684
02:32:52.680 --> 02:32:52.950
Maybe.

5685
02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:55.440
He just went gangster in the last two weeks and got fat as fuck.

5686
02:32:56.850 --> 02:32:57.061
Yeah,

5687
02:32:57.061 --> 02:32:58.290
it looks thin and healthy.

5688
02:32:58.360 --> 02:32:59.010
That's great.

5689
02:32:59.010 --> 02:32:59.340
Yeah.

5690
02:32:59.340 --> 02:33:00.360
So that doesn't make any sense.

5691
02:33:00.480 --> 02:33:01.890
So what does that other one is that,

5692
02:33:01.950 --> 02:33:02.580
is that right?

5693
02:33:02.580 --> 02:33:03.810
Maybe that's not even him.

5694
02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:04.950
I think that's not what it might be.

5695
02:33:04.951 --> 02:33:05.910
A guy that looks like him.

5696
02:33:05.911 --> 02:33:06.401
That's fan.

5697
02:33:06.401 --> 02:33:07.170
Yeah,

5698
02:33:07.170 --> 02:33:07.701
I'm looking at it.

5699
02:33:07.701 --> 02:33:08.700
Let's look at it against

5700
02:33:10.200 --> 02:33:11.580
yeah cause it really is.

5701
02:33:11.670 --> 02:33:16.050
It really does look like it looks I just got fat for a couple of months.

5702
02:33:16.560 --> 02:33:20.100
Yeah but that's hard to do to chop off that weight that quick.

5703
02:33:20.220 --> 02:33:22.050
There's a lot of weight like his neck.

5704
02:33:22.051 --> 02:33:24.960
I mean there's a lot of fighting in his movies and cocaine.

5705
02:33:25.170 --> 02:33:26.190
He looks different though.

5706
02:33:26.191 --> 02:33:28.320
Like his nose looks bigger in the fat one.

5707
02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:31.890
Is that cause his nose got fat I tickets.

5708
02:33:32.370 --> 02:33:34.200
He was either acting as a fat guy.

5709
02:33:34.470 --> 02:33:35.303
Hmm.

5710
02:33:35.460 --> 02:33:37.710
Cause you saw the pictures of mcconaughey is the aids dude.

5711
02:33:37.711 --> 02:33:38.310
Right?

5712
02:33:38.310 --> 02:33:41.370
Well that was when he decided to lose a shitload of weight.

5713
02:33:41.371 --> 02:33:42.210
But it's insane.

5714
02:33:42.830 --> 02:33:45.060
It's like life threatening.

5715
02:33:45.090 --> 02:33:47.730
How might how Theni got well you should never do that.

5716
02:33:47.970 --> 02:33:49.590
Those guys who do that for roles,

5717
02:33:49.650 --> 02:33:50.483
they're crazy.

5718
02:33:50.820 --> 02:33:51.481
I know a,

5719
02:33:51.481 --> 02:33:52.141
what's his face?

5720
02:33:52.141 --> 02:33:52.730
Batman.

5721
02:33:52.730 --> 02:33:53.563
The fuck's his name?

5722
02:33:54.180 --> 02:33:55.013
Christian Bale.

5723
02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:56.310
Bale machinist.

5724
02:33:56.360 --> 02:33:57.061
The machinist.

5725
02:33:57.061 --> 02:33:58.230
It was incredible.

5726
02:33:58.350 --> 02:34:01.590
That might be one of the scariest transformations I've ever seen a person make

5727
02:34:01.591 --> 02:34:02.070
ever.

5728
02:34:02.070 --> 02:34:03.300
Cause he was on death's door,

5729
02:34:04.110 --> 02:34:04.561
like pull,

5730
02:34:04.561 --> 02:34:06.000
pull images over that prime.

5731
02:34:06.090 --> 02:34:08.520
Or if they have a video of Christian Bale in the machinist.

5732
02:34:08.820 --> 02:34:09.180
I've never,

5733
02:34:09.180 --> 02:34:13.320
I mean I think a big deal when rob Deniro Lecan Hayes is just as bad I think.

5734
02:34:13.350 --> 02:34:14.250
Oh I don't think so.

5735
02:34:14.251 --> 02:34:16.640
It's pretty bad is it really?

5736
02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:18.100
I thought this guy was

5737
02:34:18.100 --> 02:34:19.150
<v 0>the worst I've ever seen.</v>

5738
02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:19.970
Mcconaughey.

5739
02:34:19.970 --> 02:34:20.110
Hey,

5740
02:34:20.110 --> 02:34:20.841
he looks like a ball.

5741
02:34:20.841 --> 02:34:22.780
Like I like his neck is so thin.

5742
02:34:22.781 --> 02:34:24.190
Then his head's kind of normal.

5743
02:34:24.191 --> 02:34:25.280
Makani sizes.

5744
02:34:25.460 --> 02:34:26.293
So weird.

5745
02:34:26.410 --> 02:34:29.170
Do you remember when Robert De Niro did it for regent bully gained all that

5746
02:34:29.171 --> 02:34:32.200
weight to play Jake Lamata as an older man and everybody was like,

5747
02:34:32.230 --> 02:34:33.130
this is incredible.

5748
02:34:33.131 --> 02:34:33.701
How did he do that?

5749
02:34:33.701 --> 02:34:34.420
Look at that.

5750
02:34:34.420 --> 02:34:35.830
See if you can find video of it though.

5751
02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:36.730
God Damn.

5752
02:34:36.730 --> 02:34:39.810
Because the video was even more terrifying because he see him walking around and

5753
02:34:39.811 --> 02:34:40.001
you're like,

5754
02:34:40.001 --> 02:34:41.080
Jesus Christ.

5755
02:34:41.260 --> 02:34:42.910
Like that's like Jack Skellington.

5756
02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:44.410
Well that's really him.

5757
02:34:44.710 --> 02:34:46.930
That really is Batman.

5758
02:34:47.800 --> 02:34:48.280
Yeah.

5759
02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:50.790
Well he doesn't remember that guys name and I watched him bail.

5760
02:34:50.990 --> 02:34:52.690
He's super transformative.

5761
02:34:52.691 --> 02:34:52.961
That guy.

5762
02:34:52.961 --> 02:34:54.460
He was amazing in the fighter.

5763
02:34:54.580 --> 02:34:55.240
Yes.

5764
02:34:55.240 --> 02:34:55.691
And he's got,

5765
02:34:55.691 --> 02:34:59.230
it looks like he's got a crazy haircut and this new one American hustle,

5766
02:34:59.710 --> 02:35:01.720
he's got the weird seventies comb over thing.

5767
02:35:01.720 --> 02:35:02.470
Yes,

5768
02:35:02.470 --> 02:35:03.070
yes.

5769
02:35:03.070 --> 02:35:04.420
He was great in the fighter.

5770
02:35:04.421 --> 02:35:05.111
He played,

5771
02:35:05.111 --> 02:35:06.610
I'm Micky ward's cousin,

5772
02:35:07.010 --> 02:35:08.080
a Dicky Eklund,

5773
02:35:08.110 --> 02:35:10.390
the famous boxer from Boston.

5774
02:35:10.391 --> 02:35:12.550
Sanely aggravating personality like that.

5775
02:35:12.551 --> 02:35:13.390
Movies really,

5776
02:35:13.450 --> 02:35:14.261
it's great,

5777
02:35:14.261 --> 02:35:15.280
but it's also like,

5778
02:35:16.120 --> 02:35:16.780
you know,

5779
02:35:16.780 --> 02:35:18.010
almost every scene he is,

5780
02:35:18.100 --> 02:35:18.701
he's in,

5781
02:35:18.701 --> 02:35:19.870
it's just an awkward,

5782
02:35:20.740 --> 02:35:21.573
horrible,

5783
02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:26.920
Catherine was a crack head and he was on that HBO series about a crack.

5784
02:35:26.921 --> 02:35:27.750
And Lynn,

5785
02:35:27.750 --> 02:35:28.451
you know Lynn,

5786
02:35:28.451 --> 02:35:29.770
Massachusetts are,

5787
02:35:29.771 --> 02:35:30.090
uh,

5788
02:35:30.090 --> 02:35:31.030
it was it Lynn Lowell,

5789
02:35:31.180 --> 02:35:31.900
Lowell,

5790
02:35:31.900 --> 02:35:32.960
Massachusetts was a,

5791
02:35:32.961 --> 02:35:35.140
an area was really bad.

5792
02:35:35.270 --> 02:35:37.420
Like crack hit Lowell,

5793
02:35:37.421 --> 02:35:38.201
super bad.

5794
02:35:38.201 --> 02:35:43.050
And the eighties this is the video of him in the machinist.

5795
02:35:43.540 --> 02:35:47.500
So you see him where he's walking around like it's how many days in a row he

5796
02:35:47.501 --> 02:35:48.330
hasn't slept.

5797
02:35:48.330 --> 02:35:49.163
It's like,

5798
02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:52.840
and then to go to all that trouble for something that's not even a particularly

5799
02:35:52.841 --> 02:35:53.674
good movie.

5800
02:35:54.310 --> 02:35:54.611
Well,

5801
02:35:54.611 --> 02:35:56.080
I think he tried to make it good,

5802
02:35:56.081 --> 02:35:56.914
but sure.

5803
02:35:56.980 --> 02:35:57.490
You know,

5804
02:35:57.490 --> 02:36:00.790
how the fuck can you even tell what's going on around you when you're that

5805
02:36:00.791 --> 02:36:01.270
skinny?

5806
02:36:01.270 --> 02:36:02.103
Yeah.

5807
02:36:02.950 --> 02:36:03.311
I mean,

5808
02:36:03.311 --> 02:36:05.320
that dude literally died.

5809
02:36:07.120 --> 02:36:09.710
He got down to about a few days.

5810
02:36:09.720 --> 02:36:09.870
I have

5811
02:36:09.870 --> 02:36:10.980
<v 1>no food from death.</v>

5812
02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:11.700
Yeah.

5813
02:36:11.700 --> 02:36:13.380
I think Chris was that Laurence Fishburne?

5814
02:36:13.381 --> 02:36:14.700
Did he eat all of his food?

5815
02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:16.313
How dare you?

5816
02:36:16.650 --> 02:36:21.650
Christian Bale gained 109 pounds for Batman begins after losing 63 pounds for

5817
02:36:22.261 --> 02:36:23.094
the machinists.

5818
02:36:23.310 --> 02:36:28.310
Bill went from 121 pounds to 230 pounds in six months.

5819
02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:30.150
Oh my God.

5820
02:36:30.270 --> 02:36:32.610
He was 121 pounds and he did this movie.

5821
02:36:32.630 --> 02:36:33.120
Yeah,

5822
02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:34.410
that's insane.

5823
02:36:34.411 --> 02:36:36.270
So by the time the filming began,

5824
02:36:36.271 --> 02:36:39.180
Christian Bale had dropped 190 pounds.

5825
02:36:40.170 --> 02:36:42.600
Oh my God dropped.

5826
02:36:42.601 --> 02:36:42.841
Oh,

5827
02:36:42.841 --> 02:36:44.460
you mean back and forth or no,

5828
02:36:44.461 --> 02:36:46.410
he had been moved 190 pounds.

5829
02:36:46.411 --> 02:36:47.850
He had to drop 290 pounds.

5830
02:36:48.120 --> 02:36:48.953
Right.

5831
02:36:48.990 --> 02:36:51.330
He had dropped to 190 pounds.

5832
02:36:51.331 --> 02:36:51.720
I'm sorry,

5833
02:36:51.720 --> 02:36:52.800
a hundred what?

5834
02:36:53.310 --> 02:36:53.611
It says,

5835
02:36:53.611 --> 02:36:57.870
you're probably heard that Christian bale came to 109 pounds for Batman begins,

5836
02:36:57.871 --> 02:37:02.010
meaning get buffed up for Batman begins after losing 63 pounds for it in the

5837
02:37:02.020 --> 02:37:03.120
Michigan machinists.

5838
02:37:03.210 --> 02:37:03.751
So yeah,

5839
02:37:03.751 --> 02:37:06.940
it's a swing of 190 from his lowest to his house.

5840
02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:08.370
To his full Batman late.

5841
02:37:08.390 --> 02:37:08.580
Yeah.

5842
02:37:08.580 --> 02:37:11.640
That doesn't make any sense because that would mean that he's like 300 fucking

5843
02:37:11.641 --> 02:37:12.474
pounds.

5844
02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:13.560
He was never that big.

5845
02:37:13.950 --> 02:37:15.160
He was a,

5846
02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:19.220
<v 3>well one one 93 is like two 50 yeah.</v>

5847
02:37:19.221 --> 02:37:20.270
He wouldn't be that much.

5848
02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:21.371
He's not that bad.

5849
02:37:21.371 --> 02:37:21.451
Yeah.

5850
02:37:21.451 --> 02:37:22.284
I don't get that.

5851
02:37:22.340 --> 02:37:23.390
That doesn't make any sense.

5852
02:37:23.660 --> 02:37:24.950
Stop reading that source,

5853
02:37:26.030 --> 02:37:26.780
whatever that is.

5854
02:37:26.780 --> 02:37:27.860
That doesn't seem to make sense.

5855
02:37:27.880 --> 02:37:28.070
Yeah.

5856
02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:29.890
Can you pull up a scary movie?

5857
02:37:29.891 --> 02:37:30.591
Matthew mcconaughey?

5858
02:37:30.591 --> 02:37:32.510
It's the movie's called Dallas something.

5859
02:37:32.690 --> 02:37:33.523
There's not magic Mike.

5860
02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:34.873
No.

5861
02:37:36.370 --> 02:37:37.460
I told this story before,

5862
02:37:37.461 --> 02:37:38.000
but I saw it.

5863
02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:38.330
Oh,

5864
02:37:38.330 --> 02:37:39.051
this reminds me.

5865
02:37:39.051 --> 02:37:40.310
I saw that movie with my mother,

5866
02:37:40.340 --> 02:37:45.340
Magic Mike in San Diego that time we were in San Diego for comicon and I just

5867
02:37:47.511 --> 02:37:49.460
saw the first cut of the movie.

5868
02:37:49.461 --> 02:37:53.000
We were making chronic con and both of you guys are really funny in it.

5869
02:37:53.340 --> 02:37:53.770
Wheeling.

5870
02:37:53.770 --> 02:37:54.051
Yeah.

5871
02:37:54.051 --> 02:37:54.530
Yeah.

5872
02:37:54.530 --> 02:37:57.530
Remember when we were in the green room and the guy that runs the club said,

5873
02:37:57.531 --> 02:37:57.711
hey,

5874
02:37:57.711 --> 02:37:59.120
can you meet one of the investors?

5875
02:37:59.121 --> 02:37:59.481
And you're like,

5876
02:37:59.481 --> 02:38:00.290
okay,

5877
02:38:00.290 --> 02:38:03.800
this guy comes in and he's holding like he at one point he's holding a bottle of

5878
02:38:03.801 --> 02:38:07.610
champagne and then he just lets it go and it drops on the floor and crashes

5879
02:38:07.611 --> 02:38:10.550
everywhere and then you're standing right next to him in the movie going,

5880
02:38:10.940 --> 02:38:11.211
yeah,

5881
02:38:11.211 --> 02:38:12.950
normally when you let go of a bottle like that,

5882
02:38:12.951 --> 02:38:14.000
it just floats in the year.

5883
02:38:17.930 --> 02:38:18.950
But there was lots of good stuff.

5884
02:38:18.951 --> 02:38:23.150
Cause Brian Brian was hitting on some girls out on the street in San Diego late

5885
02:38:23.150 --> 02:38:23.983
at night and you were like,

5886
02:38:24.260 --> 02:38:25.700
you did this whole rant about,

5887
02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:26.330
uh,

5888
02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:27.260
when they're barefoot,

5889
02:38:27.261 --> 02:38:30.550
they're at their most vulnerable because if they,

5890
02:38:30.551 --> 02:38:31.010
yeah.

5891
02:38:31.010 --> 02:38:34.550
And also because if they're willing to walk around in glass and Piss and

5892
02:38:34.551 --> 02:38:35.810
everything that's on the ground,

5893
02:38:36.110 --> 02:38:36.890
they're like,

5894
02:38:36.890 --> 02:38:37.400
you know,

5895
02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:38.630
there's no rules anymore.

5896
02:38:38.660 --> 02:38:39.980
You show these girls,

5897
02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:41.240
you see girls,

5898
02:38:41.241 --> 02:38:42.470
but their faces are blurred.

5899
02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:45.800
But there's one that looks like she's taking a shit in the middle of the street

5900
02:38:45.801 --> 02:38:47.450
and that's what gets Brian's attention.

5901
02:38:47.660 --> 02:38:47.991
He's like,

5902
02:38:47.991 --> 02:38:48.121
oh,

5903
02:38:48.121 --> 02:38:49.010
I'll go talk to her.

5904
02:38:49.220 --> 02:38:51.860
And then you start talking about girls holding their shoes.

5905
02:38:51.861 --> 02:38:52.694
They're vulnerable.

5906
02:38:52.730 --> 02:38:57.730
There was so much wrong girl comicon or people got so drunk downtown San Diego,

5907
02:38:57.851 --> 02:38:58.760
it's like that every week.

5908
02:38:58.790 --> 02:38:59.960
What is the deal with San Diego?

5909
02:38:59.961 --> 02:39:01.100
Why is it so wild?

5910
02:39:01.430 --> 02:39:02.690
It's just sixth street.

5911
02:39:02.691 --> 02:39:03.830
It's just that one street.

5912
02:39:03.831 --> 02:39:04.191
It's like,

5913
02:39:04.191 --> 02:39:05.440
same thing with theirs.

5914
02:39:05.470 --> 02:39:07.850
Sixth Street in Austin or you know,

5915
02:39:07.851 --> 02:39:11.150
everywhere has got a street or a neighborhood where there's just so many bars in

5916
02:39:11.151 --> 02:39:11.984
one spot.

5917
02:39:12.290 --> 02:39:13.670
It's also you can walk around.

5918
02:39:13.700 --> 02:39:14.330
Yeah.

5919
02:39:14.330 --> 02:39:14.631
Yeah.

5920
02:39:14.631 --> 02:39:15.141
It's the,

5921
02:39:15.141 --> 02:39:15.860
it's the,

5922
02:39:15.860 --> 02:39:16.693
you know,

5923
02:39:16.820 --> 02:39:17.140
the,

5924
02:39:17.140 --> 02:39:17.450
uh,

5925
02:39:17.450 --> 02:39:22.370
the herds of people moving around and then getting too drunk and then next thing

5926
02:39:22.371 --> 02:39:23.204
you know,

5927
02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:24.160
fists are being thrown.

5928
02:39:24.380 --> 02:39:24.741
Yeah.

5929
02:39:24.741 --> 02:39:28.260
I've seen that more in that area anywhere else.

5930
02:39:28.510 --> 02:39:29.510
So real world,

5931
02:39:29.511 --> 02:39:30.344
the MTV show,

5932
02:39:30.770 --> 02:39:34.670
when they have the kids in downtown San Diego and in downtown Austin and a few

5933
02:39:34.671 --> 02:39:35.504
other places,

5934
02:39:35.660 --> 02:39:36.540
s the,

5935
02:39:37.060 --> 02:39:40.130
everybody's so drunk and there's camera's following these kids around and the

5936
02:39:40.131 --> 02:39:41.660
show hasn't started airing yet.

5937
02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:46.750
So somebody's going to get jealous and angry that these people are on TV and

5938
02:39:47.210 --> 02:39:49.020
start throwing fists there.

5939
02:39:49.021 --> 02:39:52.910
There people on the real world to get arrested in the San Diego and Austin

5940
02:39:52.911 --> 02:39:57.560
additions like there were kind of regular arrests of cast members because they

5941
02:39:57.561 --> 02:40:00.200
get too drunk and get in trouble on those in those,

5942
02:40:00.201 --> 02:40:00.740
uh,

5943
02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:01.640
party neighborhoods.

5944
02:40:02.030 --> 02:40:02.863
I can imagine it.

5945
02:40:02.900 --> 02:40:03.141
I don't,

5946
02:40:03.141 --> 02:40:03.500
you know,

5947
02:40:03.500 --> 02:40:04.080
you can,

5948
02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:06.500
whenever you get people drinking together in big groups,

5949
02:40:06.501 --> 02:40:07.334
you're going to see a fight.

5950
02:40:07.740 --> 02:40:09.770
You're going to something and know Austin version.

5951
02:40:09.771 --> 02:40:14.280
There was this one kid who like got hit in the face like by a guy

5952
02:40:14.310 --> 02:40:14.730
<v 1>like,</v>

5953
02:40:14.730 --> 02:40:15.160
you know,

5954
02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:16.350
he couldn't even see a common,

5955
02:40:16.351 --> 02:40:17.184
the guy just,

5956
02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:18.900
and the guy's face is blurred.

5957
02:40:19.290 --> 02:40:21.050
I think they eventually found him and,

5958
02:40:21.051 --> 02:40:21.450
and,

5959
02:40:21.450 --> 02:40:22.290
and try to him.

5960
02:40:22.291 --> 02:40:24.120
But like on the TV show,

5961
02:40:24.510 --> 02:40:25.500
it looks like he just,

5962
02:40:25.530 --> 02:40:28.320
some guy got away with it cause he didn't stick around to sign a release,

5963
02:40:28.321 --> 02:40:28.800
you know?

5964
02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:29.633
Wow.

5965
02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:30.270
Yeah.

5966
02:40:30.270 --> 02:40:31.103
That's crazy.

5967
02:40:31.230 --> 02:40:34.020
But those girls in the chronic con will be blurred and it's also not,

5968
02:40:34.021 --> 02:40:35.460
the movie's not going to come out for awhile.

5969
02:40:36.030 --> 02:40:37.220
He just showed a picture of you found it.

5970
02:40:37.400 --> 02:40:37.560
Yeah.

5971
02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:38.011
Look at that.

5972
02:40:38.011 --> 02:40:38.844
That's nothing.

5973
02:40:39.040 --> 02:40:39.341
Wait,

5974
02:40:39.341 --> 02:40:40.174
wait.

5975
02:40:40.510 --> 02:40:41.343
Oh,

5976
02:40:42.170 --> 02:40:43.003
that's not,

5977
02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:43.580
no,

5978
02:40:43.580 --> 02:40:44.710
that's not as bad as Christian Bale.

5979
02:40:45.230 --> 02:40:48.120
And then it shows him in the how to lose a guy in 10 days.

5980
02:40:50.190 --> 02:40:50.940
That's just,

5981
02:40:50.940 --> 02:40:53.090
TMZ is greatest hits of Matana.

5982
02:40:53.091 --> 02:40:53.810
Hey Ryan.

5983
02:40:53.810 --> 02:40:54.570
Kelly do it.

5984
02:40:54.570 --> 02:40:55.770
Do not give Brian counts.

5985
02:40:55.771 --> 02:41:00.771
Started on Matthew mcconaughey because he will go into this whole rant about

5986
02:41:00.871 --> 02:41:04.950
acting and being authentic and like he gets like,

5987
02:41:05.010 --> 02:41:07.110
he's not a muck a fan,

5988
02:41:07.380 --> 02:41:08.170
so he gets,

5989
02:41:08.170 --> 02:41:09.630
he's been killing it lately though.

5990
02:41:09.770 --> 02:41:11.550
Democrat Makonnen Hazen been,

5991
02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:12.301
I love it.

5992
02:41:12.301 --> 02:41:13.550
Very versatile lately.

5993
02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:15.540
Super strong opinions on actors.

5994
02:41:16.790 --> 02:41:17.623
It's like,

5995
02:41:18.090 --> 02:41:18.923
okay,

5996
02:41:19.530 --> 02:41:20.100
yeah,

5997
02:41:20.100 --> 02:41:21.090
that's really going on here.

5998
02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:21.810
It gets,

5999
02:41:21.810 --> 02:41:22.081
yeah,

6000
02:41:22.081 --> 02:41:23.190
it kept me of those parts would have,

6001
02:41:23.191 --> 02:41:24.150
you'd like to have done.

6002
02:41:24.590 --> 02:41:25.020
Yeah.

6003
02:41:25.020 --> 02:41:26.430
When one person says I like so and so,

6004
02:41:26.431 --> 02:41:26.970
and that movie,

6005
02:41:26.970 --> 02:41:27.181
Oh,

6006
02:41:27.181 --> 02:41:28.320
she was terrible in that.

6007
02:41:28.470 --> 02:41:28.891
Okay,

6008
02:41:28.891 --> 02:41:30.600
well we both just said a bunch of words.

6009
02:41:30.601 --> 02:41:32.310
Let's go find something to really do.

6010
02:41:32.350 --> 02:41:32.450
Well,

6011
02:41:32.450 --> 02:41:33.090
it's also,

6012
02:41:33.090 --> 02:41:34.650
Brian does a lot of acting,

6013
02:41:34.651 --> 02:41:36.150
so he liked judges activity.

6014
02:41:36.310 --> 02:41:38.070
You can see.

6015
02:41:38.071 --> 02:41:38.880
I looked at act,

6016
02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:40.920
I look at acting completely as an outsider,

6017
02:41:41.070 --> 02:41:45.090
so I see like even if I don't like the type of movie he's in,

6018
02:41:45.150 --> 02:41:46.710
he's definitely can act like,

6019
02:41:46.711 --> 02:41:47.790
how could you say that guy can't act?

6020
02:41:47.790 --> 02:41:48.780
Did you see contact?

6021
02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:50.430
He's fucking great in that movie.

6022
02:41:50.580 --> 02:41:51.420
He's in great note of that.

6023
02:41:51.421 --> 02:41:54.540
What was that movie where he played like a killer killer Joe?

6024
02:41:55.650 --> 02:41:56.251
Was that what it's called?

6025
02:41:56.251 --> 02:41:57.840
That movies intense with a chicken wing.

6026
02:41:57.841 --> 02:41:58.530
Do you see that?

6027
02:41:58.530 --> 02:42:00.060
There was a couple movies like that.

6028
02:42:00.061 --> 02:42:03.330
There was another one where he did a freaking move and killer Joe where he's

6029
02:42:03.331 --> 02:42:03.541
like,

6030
02:42:03.541 --> 02:42:04.830
he's a hired killer,

6031
02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:05.580
but he,

6032
02:42:05.580 --> 02:42:06.361
he does this thing.

6033
02:42:06.361 --> 02:42:09.950
Did Gina Gershon with the chicken wing that's really grabbed,

6034
02:42:09.951 --> 02:42:12.000
when was this pretty recently?

6035
02:42:12.001 --> 02:42:15.390
I saw it three and a half stars at South by southwest last year.

6036
02:42:15.420 --> 02:42:15.540
Oh,

6037
02:42:15.540 --> 02:42:16.830
it's a 2011 movie.

6038
02:42:16.831 --> 02:42:17.760
It's a recent movie.

6039
02:42:17.820 --> 02:42:18.031
Oh,

6040
02:42:18.031 --> 02:42:18.781
I haven't seen that.

6041
02:42:18.781 --> 02:42:19.280
No,

6042
02:42:19.280 --> 02:42:20.011
you should check it out.

6043
02:42:20.011 --> 02:42:21.900
It's really crazy.

6044
02:42:22.120 --> 02:42:22.471
You can,

6045
02:42:22.471 --> 02:42:22.890
you know,

6046
02:42:22.890 --> 02:42:26.400
you can get it onto iTunes or some shit like that out tonight.

6047
02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:27.510
There was a,

6048
02:42:27.511 --> 02:42:28.260
um,

6049
02:42:28.260 --> 02:42:29.490
there was another movie though.

6050
02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:30.001
What's it called?

6051
02:42:30.001 --> 02:42:31.860
Stricken or something like that?

6052
02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:34.080
Matthew mcconahey.

6053
02:42:34.081 --> 02:42:34.801
Serial killer.

6054
02:42:34.801 --> 02:42:35.520
What's,

6055
02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:40.170
there was one in the past where he played some really fucking,

6056
02:42:40.410 --> 02:42:41.243
how do you spell his name?

6057
02:42:43.440 --> 02:42:44.500
That's a tough one kid.

6058
02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:44.910
Yeah.

6059
02:42:44.910 --> 02:42:45.571
That's a tough one.

6060
02:42:45.571 --> 02:42:45.921
Kind of.

6061
02:42:45.921 --> 02:42:46.680
Hey,

6062
02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:47.490
serial killer.

6063
02:42:47.490 --> 02:42:48.790
Serial killing Rocana.

6064
02:42:48.870 --> 02:42:49.890
Hey.

6065
02:42:50.460 --> 02:42:51.293
Yeah.

6066
02:42:51.710 --> 02:42:52.980
What handsome pastor it is.

6067
02:42:53.570 --> 02:42:53.880
Alright,

6068
02:42:53.880 --> 02:42:55.530
let's say frailty.

6069
02:42:55.560 --> 02:42:55.980
Yeah.

6070
02:42:55.980 --> 02:42:56.430
Frill.

6071
02:42:56.430 --> 02:42:56.940
Okay.

6072
02:42:56.940 --> 02:42:58.950
2001 that was crazy man.

6073
02:42:58.980 --> 02:42:59.880
Bill packs then.

6074
02:42:59.910 --> 02:43:00.810
And I don't,

6075
02:43:01.140 --> 02:43:01.820
I haven't seen it long.

6076
02:43:01.820 --> 02:43:05.460
It's got seven to 7.2 out of 10 on rotten tomatoes.

6077
02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:07.290
Have you heard of the movie Bernie?

6078
02:43:07.890 --> 02:43:08.251
Bernie?

6079
02:43:08.251 --> 02:43:08.670
What's that?

6080
02:43:08.670 --> 02:43:11.830
It's Jack Black Plays Bernie and mcconaughey.

6081
02:43:11.840 --> 02:43:12.220
Pele's

6082
02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:13.031
<v 2>like a local,</v>

6083
02:43:13.031 --> 02:43:15.040
a police detective.

6084
02:43:15.180 --> 02:43:15.790
How you spell it?

6085
02:43:15.790 --> 02:43:16.623
Br.

6086
02:43:17.420 --> 02:43:19.320
Bernie Ibr and I,

6087
02:43:19.370 --> 02:43:19.720
and it,

6088
02:43:19.720 --> 02:43:22.450
but it takes place in Austin and it's based on a true story.

6089
02:43:22.630 --> 02:43:26.320
So the movie is filled with people that were really involved in the story and

6090
02:43:26.321 --> 02:43:27.400
knew the real guy,

6091
02:43:27.450 --> 02:43:27.650
uh,

6092
02:43:27.650 --> 02:43:28.720
as themselves.

6093
02:43:29.110 --> 02:43:29.440
Yeah,

6094
02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:29.920
it's cool.

6095
02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:30.640
And it's really,

6096
02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:31.570
it's really well done.

6097
02:43:31.571 --> 02:43:32.500
It's Richard Linklater.

6098
02:43:32.501 --> 02:43:33.790
That guy did dazed and confused.

6099
02:43:34.530 --> 02:43:37.180
Doug Benson come with a strong recommendations.

6100
02:43:37.810 --> 02:43:39.700
I got like two movies to watch now.

6101
02:43:39.730 --> 02:43:40.150
Killer.

6102
02:43:40.150 --> 02:43:41.380
They're both really interesting.

6103
02:43:41.381 --> 02:43:41.951
But you know,

6104
02:43:41.951 --> 02:43:43.170
they may not be here a,

6105
02:43:43.180 --> 02:43:43.690
you know,

6106
02:43:43.690 --> 02:43:44.381
a cup of tea.

6107
02:43:44.381 --> 02:43:46.270
But I like a lot of different kinds of tea.

6108
02:43:46.450 --> 02:43:47.050
Yeah,

6109
02:43:47.050 --> 02:43:48.610
no I know that about you for sure.

6110
02:43:48.611 --> 02:43:49.290
That you like.

6111
02:43:49.290 --> 02:43:50.110
Uh,

6112
02:43:50.110 --> 02:43:53.260
whenever I see you raving about a movie and I always find it interesting cause I

6113
02:43:53.261 --> 02:43:53.800
know you don't,

6114
02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:55.120
you don't see a lot of them.

6115
02:43:55.950 --> 02:43:58.960
And then also don't probably love a lot of them once you do.

6116
02:43:59.620 --> 02:44:01.120
So when you rave about something,

6117
02:44:01.480 --> 02:44:02.170
it's very,

6118
02:44:02.170 --> 02:44:03.003
very passionate.

6119
02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:06.850
I heard you on Kevin and being and talking shit about Riddick they were talking

6120
02:44:06.851 --> 02:44:07.684
about me seeing really,

6121
02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:09.160
it was so bad.

6122
02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:09.851
I,

6123
02:44:09.851 --> 02:44:10.081
yeah,

6124
02:44:10.081 --> 02:44:11.170
I didn't even see the whole thing.

6125
02:44:11.171 --> 02:44:12.200
I just saw a section of it.

6126
02:44:12.201 --> 02:44:12.311
No,

6127
02:44:12.311 --> 02:44:12.581
I know.

6128
02:44:12.581 --> 02:44:13.840
This is just not for me.

6129
02:44:13.841 --> 02:44:15.580
But I enjoyed pitch black.

6130
02:44:15.610 --> 02:44:16.361
I thought pitch black.

6131
02:44:16.361 --> 02:44:16.961
It was really cool.

6132
02:44:16.961 --> 02:44:20.170
That's what I immediately said to Kevin and being as I defended the,

6133
02:44:20.410 --> 02:44:23.620
that it was that that movie wasn't bad and it was good.

6134
02:44:23.621 --> 02:44:27.040
And then the chronic chronicles or read it Riddick was ridiculous.

6135
02:44:27.041 --> 02:44:28.990
And then then the last one,

6136
02:44:28.991 --> 02:44:30.730
it was like they trying to go back to pitch black,

6137
02:44:30.731 --> 02:44:34.570
but now they've kind of stuck because they've got the budget of a bigger movie.

6138
02:44:34.900 --> 02:44:35.471
So they couldn't,

6139
02:44:35.471 --> 02:44:39.040
they didn't really force themselves to be a terribly inventive.

6140
02:44:39.520 --> 02:44:41.620
It's weird how much he's alone so much.

6141
02:44:41.980 --> 02:44:46.980
Like this year is the weirdest year in that Tom Cruise Will Smith Jr uh,

6142
02:44:47.650 --> 02:44:49.450
that guy and there's a fork.

6143
02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:49.601
Oh.

6144
02:44:49.601 --> 02:44:50.800
And then of course Sandra Bullock,

6145
02:44:50.801 --> 02:44:54.850
like all these movies were a big stars are just sort of like a low alone in a

6146
02:44:54.851 --> 02:44:56.830
space or in a futuristic planet.

6147
02:44:57.400 --> 02:44:58.600
And they've all,

6148
02:44:58.630 --> 02:44:58.901
you know,

6149
02:44:58.901 --> 02:44:59.561
until gravity,

6150
02:44:59.561 --> 02:45:00.580
they've all just failed.

6151
02:45:01.500 --> 02:45:02.440
They're all doing terribly.

6152
02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:03.593
It's like one of these,

6153
02:45:03.610 --> 02:45:04.720
they're the star Egos.

6154
02:45:04.721 --> 02:45:05.161
Like I don't,

6155
02:45:05.161 --> 02:45:07.060
there doesn't need to be anybody else in this movie.

6156
02:45:07.150 --> 02:45:09.160
But that's different because at least in those,

6157
02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:11.110
in all these movies that have come out,

6158
02:45:11.111 --> 02:45:13.060
whether it's a Tom cruise movie or the Will Smith movie,

6159
02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:14.710
it's some dystopian future.

6160
02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:15.160
Yeah.

6161
02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:17.900
This is more current event and,

6162
02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:20.080
and the reality of space junk,

6163
02:45:20.470 --> 02:45:20.860
you know,

6164
02:45:20.860 --> 02:45:21.581
entering into,

6165
02:45:21.581 --> 02:45:23.020
I think gravity came from a better,

6166
02:45:23.021 --> 02:45:24.310
I don't think Sandra Bullock was like,

6167
02:45:24.311 --> 02:45:26.500
I need a star vehicle where it's just me,

6168
02:45:26.770 --> 02:45:27.190
but,

6169
02:45:27.190 --> 02:45:28.200
and you know,

6170
02:45:28.201 --> 02:45:30.580
and I don't think Tom Hanks did that about Captain Phillips,

6171
02:45:30.581 --> 02:45:31.360
but it's still,

6172
02:45:31.360 --> 02:45:35.590
it's an interesting ego thing that any actor thinks that they're them alone is

6173
02:45:35.591 --> 02:45:37.900
worth people to just watch an entire movie.

6174
02:45:37.930 --> 02:45:38.111
Well,

6175
02:45:38.111 --> 02:45:39.520
that's the other movie we talked about earlier.

6176
02:45:39.550 --> 02:45:40.180
Um,

6177
02:45:40.180 --> 02:45:40.960
Sam,

6178
02:45:40.960 --> 02:45:41.680
what's his face?

6179
02:45:41.680 --> 02:45:41.891
Yeah,

6180
02:45:41.891 --> 02:45:42.724
Moon Moon,

6181
02:45:42.790 --> 02:45:43.181
Sam.

6182
02:45:43.181 --> 02:45:44.440
But that movie was done from a,

6183
02:45:44.441 --> 02:45:44.801
you know,

6184
02:45:44.801 --> 02:45:47.170
a real place of artistry,

6185
02:45:47.171 --> 02:45:47.561
you know,

6186
02:45:47.561 --> 02:45:50.620
and it was such a interesting premise.

6187
02:45:51.100 --> 02:45:51.790
Yes.

6188
02:45:51.790 --> 02:45:52.070
Yeah.

6189
02:45:52.070 --> 02:45:52.751
That wasn't interesting.

6190
02:45:52.751 --> 02:45:53.471
It wasn't like,

6191
02:45:53.471 --> 02:45:53.831
you know,

6192
02:45:53.831 --> 02:45:54.770
him just saw just,

6193
02:45:54.820 --> 02:45:55.990
it's not show off he,

6194
02:45:55.991 --> 02:45:57.100
or trying to be a move.

6195
02:45:57.130 --> 02:45:57.341
You know,

6196
02:45:57.341 --> 02:45:58.740
the script came before the actor.

6197
02:45:58.750 --> 02:46:01.830
I'm sure Tom Cruise a developed oblivion.

6198
02:46:01.840 --> 02:46:03.910
Like it'll just be me running around on this planet.

6199
02:46:04.690 --> 02:46:05.523
He did.

6200
02:46:05.920 --> 02:46:06.611
I'm sure he did.

6201
02:46:06.611 --> 02:46:06.851
Yeah.

6202
02:46:06.851 --> 02:46:07.120
You know,

6203
02:46:07.120 --> 02:46:07.780
he's,

6204
02:46:07.780 --> 02:46:08.231
he's,

6205
02:46:08.231 --> 02:46:09.064
uh,

6206
02:46:09.260 --> 02:46:10.130
I think that guy works

6207
02:46:10.130 --> 02:46:10.521
<v 3>really,</v>

6208
02:46:10.521 --> 02:46:11.354
really hard.

6209
02:46:11.390 --> 02:46:15.800
Like I admire how hard he works to make the silly movies that we get to see.

6210
02:46:15.830 --> 02:46:17.270
It was a little volcano twice a year.

6211
02:46:17.300 --> 02:46:18.133
No,

6212
02:46:18.170 --> 02:46:18.800
sure.

6213
02:46:18.800 --> 02:46:19.633
I'm pretty sure.

6214
02:46:21.290 --> 02:46:21.770
Is there,

6215
02:46:21.770 --> 02:46:22.820
is there somebody that you would,

6216
02:46:23.170 --> 02:46:24.080
is there a dude you would left?

6217
02:46:24.081 --> 02:46:24.291
Fuck,

6218
02:46:24.291 --> 02:46:25.790
you could just cause you admire him so much.

6219
02:46:25.890 --> 02:46:26.723
Not Anymore.

6220
02:46:26.900 --> 02:46:27.733
What happened

6221
02:46:33.010 --> 02:46:33.380
once?

6222
02:46:33.380 --> 02:46:34.213
Shame on you.

6223
02:46:34.220 --> 02:46:34.700
Yeah.

6224
02:46:34.700 --> 02:46:35.420
I just don't,

6225
02:46:35.420 --> 02:46:35.691
yeah,

6226
02:46:35.691 --> 02:46:37.190
I just don't think I would just be like,

6227
02:46:37.191 --> 02:46:39.550
can't we just get some drinks?

6228
02:46:40.110 --> 02:46:43.160
I have a smoke mad flavors in a Twitter war right now.

6229
02:46:43.310 --> 02:46:44.143
We'll do,

6230
02:46:44.360 --> 02:46:45.670
do you know a guy named Phil?

6231
02:46:45.671 --> 02:46:46.504
He prints?

6232
02:46:46.700 --> 02:46:47.000
No.

6233
02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:48.620
Philly prince one on,

6234
02:46:48.621 --> 02:46:49.160
uh,

6235
02:46:49.160 --> 02:46:49.850
Twitter.

6236
02:46:49.850 --> 02:46:51.830
He's a former odds maker.

6237
02:46:51.831 --> 02:46:52.280
Had,

6238
02:46:52.280 --> 02:46:52.820
I don't know,

6239
02:46:52.820 --> 02:46:53.780
Espn Hoes.

6240
02:46:53.810 --> 02:46:54.920
Fox radio host.

6241
02:46:55.250 --> 02:46:56.010
What's he getting mad at?

6242
02:46:56.010 --> 02:46:56.720
Joyful.

6243
02:46:56.720 --> 02:46:57.171
I don't know,

6244
02:46:57.171 --> 02:46:57.781
but it's,

6245
02:46:57.781 --> 02:47:00.290
it's whole page is just going off on him like,

6246
02:47:00.350 --> 02:47:02.360
well maybe so the guy like you will mention it.

6247
02:47:02.960 --> 02:47:03.560
Yeah.

6248
02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:04.393
Good one.

6249
02:47:04.400 --> 02:47:05.233
Uh,

6250
02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:05.670
yeah,

6251
02:47:05.670 --> 02:47:06.710
he's like going off on him.

6252
02:47:06.711 --> 02:47:10.370
His thing like he got fucked in the ass and prison and doing all this back to

6253
02:47:10.380 --> 02:47:10.910
this guy.

6254
02:47:10.910 --> 02:47:11.980
If Joey wants to talk about it.

6255
02:47:12.100 --> 02:47:13.160
I have Joey talk about it.

6256
02:47:13.430 --> 02:47:17.120
Don't give any guy like that any kind of attention when something like that

6257
02:47:17.121 --> 02:47:17.570
comes up.

6258
02:47:17.570 --> 02:47:20.090
That's someone who's trolling and what they're trying to do is they're trying to

6259
02:47:20.091 --> 02:47:21.310
get attention from guys.

6260
02:47:21.320 --> 02:47:22.101
Got a lot of attention.

6261
02:47:22.101 --> 02:47:22.691
And what'd you do?

6262
02:47:22.691 --> 02:47:23.590
He just gave him a dungeon.

6263
02:47:24.070 --> 02:47:24.290
Fuck.

6264
02:47:24.290 --> 02:47:24.621
Yeah.

6265
02:47:24.621 --> 02:47:25.610
It's hard to,

6266
02:47:25.611 --> 02:47:25.911
I mean,

6267
02:47:25.911 --> 02:47:26.511
in this case,

6268
02:47:26.511 --> 02:47:27.770
Brian could have not done that,

6269
02:47:27.771 --> 02:47:27.941
but,

6270
02:47:27.941 --> 02:47:29.960
and sometimes it's like when it's at you,

6271
02:47:29.961 --> 02:47:30.800
especially,

6272
02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:31.701
you know,

6273
02:47:31.701 --> 02:47:34.250
when someone says something really mean or stupid to me,

6274
02:47:34.251 --> 02:47:35.860
like sometimes I'll retweet it or something.

6275
02:47:35.861 --> 02:47:36.230
Yeah.

6276
02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:37.730
And because I just,

6277
02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:42.260
I get a real charge out of the horrible things at all that some of my fans will

6278
02:47:42.261 --> 02:47:43.310
then say to that person,

6279
02:47:43.700 --> 02:47:43.940
you know?

6280
02:47:43.940 --> 02:47:46.130
And it's fun to see that all the people defending me.

6281
02:47:46.370 --> 02:47:47.810
But at the same time,

6282
02:47:48.300 --> 02:47:48.890
you know,

6283
02:47:48.890 --> 02:47:49.820
people write to me and say,

6284
02:47:49.821 --> 02:47:51.290
you shouldn't feed the trolls.

6285
02:47:51.291 --> 02:47:51.471
You know,

6286
02:47:51.471 --> 02:47:51.950
you shouldn't,

6287
02:47:51.950 --> 02:47:53.600
you're just giving them the attention they want.

6288
02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:54.141
It's like,

6289
02:47:54.141 --> 02:47:54.441
yeah.

6290
02:47:54.441 --> 02:47:55.274
But,

6291
02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:56.233
uh,

6292
02:47:56.750 --> 02:47:57.111
you know,

6293
02:47:57.111 --> 02:48:00.740
I think ignoring it sometimes makes them go on to seek more of,

6294
02:48:01.010 --> 02:48:02.120
more of that attention.

6295
02:48:02.121 --> 02:48:02.400
You know,

6296
02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:03.290
this was not even,

6297
02:48:03.350 --> 02:48:03.531
yeah,

6298
02:48:03.531 --> 02:48:04.910
but this doesn't even have to do with us,

6299
02:48:05.060 --> 02:48:06.560
but it's like he wants to talk about it.

6300
02:48:06.561 --> 02:48:07.490
Let Joey talk about it.

6301
02:48:07.491 --> 02:48:08.450
But if I want to talk to me,

6302
02:48:08.451 --> 02:48:08.710
Yo,

6303
02:48:08.710 --> 02:48:09.980
you want to talk about how great he is.

6304
02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:11.390
But it was funny earlier when you met,

6305
02:48:11.391 --> 02:48:13.400
when we were talking about having the pit bull on the,

6306
02:48:13.401 --> 02:48:16.730
on the plane is it's like you were kind of shrugged your shoulders like,

6307
02:48:16.731 --> 02:48:17.511
well I guess you know,

6308
02:48:17.511 --> 02:48:21.110
the guy really likes his dog or whatever and my feeling is I would hate to sit

6309
02:48:21.111 --> 02:48:21.944
next to them,

6310
02:48:22.250 --> 02:48:24.500
but it's such a lottery that went away.

6311
02:48:24.530 --> 02:48:26.060
When are we going to sit next to him?

6312
02:48:26.090 --> 02:48:27.530
So let the guy have his dog,

6313
02:48:27.531 --> 02:48:28.010
you know,

6314
02:48:28.010 --> 02:48:29.600
like we're not going to have to put up with it.

6315
02:48:29.630 --> 02:48:29.851
Yeah,

6316
02:48:29.851 --> 02:48:30.920
but that's one guy.

6317
02:48:30.921 --> 02:48:33.320
The problem is other people see that and they want to do it.

6318
02:48:33.380 --> 02:48:34.970
There's a reason why you can't have dogs on plants.

6319
02:48:34.971 --> 02:48:35.511
One of them was a,

6320
02:48:35.511 --> 02:48:36.800
people are fucking allergic dogs.

6321
02:48:37.130 --> 02:48:38.810
Some people are deathly allergic to dogs.

6322
02:48:38.960 --> 02:48:39.351
Some people,

6323
02:48:39.351 --> 02:48:40.490
their eyes swell up shot.

6324
02:48:40.491 --> 02:48:40.851
Second of all,

6325
02:48:40.851 --> 02:48:41.661
it's not sanitary.

6326
02:48:41.661 --> 02:48:43.370
Your dog's got a why open ass.

6327
02:48:43.640 --> 02:48:44.690
There's no diaper on it.

6328
02:48:44.691 --> 02:48:45.201
It's not clean.

6329
02:48:45.201 --> 02:48:46.490
They fought like crazy.

6330
02:48:46.491 --> 02:48:48.740
They don't give a shit whether or not people right next to them.

6331
02:48:48.920 --> 02:48:49.760
If they have to pee,

6332
02:48:49.761 --> 02:48:50.594
what are you going to do?

6333
02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:51.590
It's stupid.

6334
02:48:51.830 --> 02:48:52.910
It's a dumb thing.

6335
02:48:53.150 --> 02:48:55.100
If you're going to travel with your fucking dog,

6336
02:48:55.101 --> 02:48:58.010
a dog should be in the luggage compartment like everybody else's dog.

6337
02:48:58.340 --> 02:48:59.420
That's how it's supposed to be.

6338
02:49:00.050 --> 02:49:02.750
But if you're on with somebody that does have their dog,

6339
02:49:02.751 --> 02:49:03.501
cause it's happened,

6340
02:49:03.501 --> 02:49:03.980
right?

6341
02:49:03.980 --> 02:49:04.281
Yeah.

6342
02:49:04.281 --> 02:49:07.530
I've been next to people that had a dog to say all that to them or do you just

6343
02:49:07.531 --> 02:49:08.364
go love dogs?

6344
02:49:08.450 --> 02:49:08.941
<v 5>You just go,</v>

6345
02:49:08.941 --> 02:49:10.830
I'm never going to have to sit next to this person again.

6346
02:49:10.831 --> 02:49:11.790
So what difference does it make?

6347
02:49:12.330 --> 02:49:12.871
Yes.

6348
02:49:12.871 --> 02:49:13.710
But no,

6349
02:49:13.770 --> 02:49:14.640
in the current,

6350
02:49:14.820 --> 02:49:15.870
the current climate,

6351
02:49:15.900 --> 02:49:16.490
you don't,

6352
02:49:16.490 --> 02:49:16.840
you know,

6353
02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:18.780
most likely you're not going to have to deal with that.

6354
02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:20.910
But doesn't it make you feel like Larry David though,

6355
02:49:20.911 --> 02:49:23.250
when you see something like that and like on his show,

6356
02:49:23.251 --> 02:49:26.190
he would consistently call people out on stuff and it would just lead to these

6357
02:49:26.191 --> 02:49:28.470
horrible arguments and these horrible interactions.

6358
02:49:28.710 --> 02:49:28.891
Like,

6359
02:49:28.891 --> 02:49:29.730
don't you feel like,

6360
02:49:29.780 --> 02:49:30.200
you know,

6361
02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:31.890
you just can't police everything.

6362
02:49:32.150 --> 02:49:33.060
She can't police everything.

6363
02:49:33.061 --> 02:49:35.160
But I was at the fucking bookstore and this lady,

6364
02:49:35.290 --> 02:49:36.123
I love headache,

6365
02:49:36.160 --> 02:49:37.920
a giant dog.

6366
02:49:38.010 --> 02:49:40.030
It's like a fucking great Dane and I'm,

6367
02:49:40.031 --> 02:49:43.560
I'm reading a magazine and I feel a dog's nose touch my hand.

6368
02:49:43.740 --> 02:49:47.790
And I looked over and there was a fucking great Dane and I go,

6369
02:49:47.791 --> 02:49:48.570
whoa.

6370
02:49:48.570 --> 02:49:49.171
And she goes,

6371
02:49:49.171 --> 02:49:49.621
don't worry,

6372
02:49:49.621 --> 02:49:50.454
he's friendly.

6373
02:49:50.490 --> 02:49:51.150
And I go,

6374
02:49:51.150 --> 02:49:52.020
why is he here?

6375
02:49:53.070 --> 02:49:53.903
And she goes,

6376
02:49:53.940 --> 02:49:55.050
he's a service dog.

6377
02:49:55.260 --> 02:49:56.490
I go service dog,

6378
02:49:56.491 --> 02:49:57.660
or what does he servicing?

6379
02:49:57.930 --> 02:49:58.141
I go,

6380
02:49:58.141 --> 02:49:58.974
what are you doing?

6381
02:49:59.130 --> 02:49:59.460
Like,

6382
02:49:59.460 --> 02:50:00.060
you know,

6383
02:50:00.060 --> 02:50:04.440
I'm at a fucking bookstore is a 180 pound dog jogs enormous.

6384
02:50:04.620 --> 02:50:05.790
And it's licking my hand.

6385
02:50:05.791 --> 02:50:06.700
Like this lady Ivy,

6386
02:50:06.730 --> 02:50:07.740
she's not in control of it.

6387
02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:08.820
And I love dogs,

6388
02:50:09.060 --> 02:50:10.470
but that's not cool.

6389
02:50:10.530 --> 02:50:12.470
You should have a fucking animal in.

6390
02:50:12.520 --> 02:50:15.660
You can't totally control inside a bookstore.

6391
02:50:15.740 --> 02:50:17.640
It's what she say to the service question.

6392
02:50:17.910 --> 02:50:18.743
She didn't answer me.

6393
02:50:19.380 --> 02:50:20.400
Yeah cause there is no answer.

6394
02:50:20.870 --> 02:50:22.770
She went and filed the paperwork and got it.

6395
02:50:22.771 --> 02:50:23.520
Anyway,

6396
02:50:23.520 --> 02:50:25.350
even we've already discussed this on the podcast.

6397
02:50:25.390 --> 02:50:30.030
Adenoids osmium unfortunately anybody can get one emotional support dogs.

6398
02:50:30.390 --> 02:50:31.650
They're trying to change that law,

6399
02:50:31.860 --> 02:50:34.250
that trying to change it because people are abused the shit out of it.

6400
02:50:34.250 --> 02:50:34.980
Yeah.

6401
02:50:34.980 --> 02:50:35.880
It's weird man.

6402
02:50:35.881 --> 02:50:36.990
People are fucking weird.

6403
02:50:37.020 --> 02:50:40.170
It's weird that anybody would think that that's okay to do.

6404
02:50:40.230 --> 02:50:41.730
This is a lady that goes to my restaurant,

6405
02:50:42.090 --> 02:50:45.360
a restaurant that I go to a near my house and she brings her dog in all the

6406
02:50:45.361 --> 02:50:45.571
time.

6407
02:50:45.571 --> 02:50:47.580
It's a famous lady movie star.

6408
02:50:47.970 --> 02:50:51.600
She comes in with his fucking dog and this dog has this wide open ass just

6409
02:50:51.601 --> 02:50:55.380
sitting there rubbing on the ground where people drop their forks and you know,

6410
02:50:55.381 --> 02:50:56.310
drop your cell phone,

6411
02:50:56.311 --> 02:50:56.940
pick it up,

6412
02:50:56.940 --> 02:50:58.230
get dog shit on your hand.

6413
02:50:58.350 --> 02:50:59.880
Even if it's microscopic amounts.

6414
02:50:59.910 --> 02:51:01.080
It's disgusting.

6415
02:51:01.410 --> 02:51:02.640
It's stupid fucking thing.

6416
02:51:02.641 --> 02:51:05.640
It's farting in there and he's licking its own dick.

6417
02:51:05.790 --> 02:51:06.780
It's ridiculous.

6418
02:51:06.840 --> 02:51:09.570
The I the idea that you should be allowed to bring your fucking dog into a

6419
02:51:09.571 --> 02:51:10.200
restaurant.

6420
02:51:10.200 --> 02:51:11.820
It's Shit's ridiculous.

6421
02:51:13.050 --> 02:51:15.900
Unless you're alone by yourself and your belong mind.

6422
02:51:16.050 --> 02:51:16.883
Fuck you.

6423
02:51:17.810 --> 02:51:18.643
All right.

6424
02:51:19.080 --> 02:51:21.210
Come in because it's an emotional support dog.

6425
02:51:21.240 --> 02:51:22.290
That's nonsense.

6426
02:51:23.350 --> 02:51:24.061
That's a good one.

6427
02:51:24.061 --> 02:51:24.631
That's really,

6428
02:51:24.631 --> 02:51:25.230
uh,

6429
02:51:25.230 --> 02:51:28.260
that's figuring out a way to rig the system.

6430
02:51:28.330 --> 02:51:30.120
[inaudible] hack the American disabilities act.

6431
02:51:30.121 --> 02:51:30.954
That's what they did.

6432
02:51:31.060 --> 02:51:33.090
They cut into the fucking,

6433
02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:33.401
the,

6434
02:51:33.401 --> 02:51:36.720
the laws that are in place to help people and they realize that there's a little

6435
02:51:36.721 --> 02:51:39.390
loophole here and we could fucking bring our dogs everywhere now.

6436
02:51:39.990 --> 02:51:41.010
Twats yeah,

6437
02:51:41.011 --> 02:51:42.690
they bring their poop hole through the loophole.

6438
02:51:42.880 --> 02:51:46.020
Fucking twats anything good to say before we end?

6439
02:51:46.021 --> 02:51:47.010
Can negative like that?

6440
02:51:47.190 --> 02:51:47.581
Oh yeah,

6441
02:51:47.581 --> 02:51:48.720
let's get real positive.

6442
02:51:48.721 --> 02:51:50.150
Has it been three hours already?

6443
02:51:50.190 --> 02:51:50.910
It's over.

6444
02:51:50.910 --> 02:51:51.660
God Damn.

6445
02:51:51.660 --> 02:51:52.061
It's over.

6446
02:51:52.061 --> 02:51:52.920
It goes so fast.

6447
02:51:52.980 --> 02:51:55.020
It does cause you're awesome.

6448
02:51:55.800 --> 02:51:56.930
Is that why you're good at this?

6449
02:51:58.590 --> 02:52:02.220
I listened to her shows drag you and I did a long time ago,

6450
02:52:02.221 --> 02:52:02.491

6451
02:52:02.491 --> 02:52:04.620
I'll just listen to it like it was in the one hundreds.

6452
02:52:04.920 --> 02:52:05.351
I was,

6453
02:52:05.351 --> 02:52:05.680

6454
02:52:05.680 --> 02:52:07.180

6455

02:52:08.561 --> 02:52:10.210

I can't talk about on the air,

6458
02:52:11.051 --> 02:52:12.610
but I've got to talk to podcast related.

6459
02:52:12.611 --> 02:52:13.444
Remind me.

6460
02:52:14.420 --> 02:52:15.253
Um,

6461
02:52:15.630 --> 02:52:17.290
so I started listening to,

6462
02:52:17.320 --> 02:52:18.010
um,

6463
02:52:18.010 --> 02:52:21.250
some just different people's podcasts was just going over the podcast app on my

6464
02:52:21.251 --> 02:52:21.970
phone.

6465
02:52:21.970 --> 02:52:26.970
And then I found one of you and I and Brian from like fucking three or four

6466
02:52:27.461 --> 02:52:27.941
years ago.

6467
02:52:27.941 --> 02:52:29.740
It was like three years ago when we were first starting out.

6468
02:52:29.741 --> 02:52:30.071
And I was like,

6469
02:52:30.071 --> 02:52:30.310
wow,

6470
02:52:30.310 --> 02:52:31.143
let me listen to this.

6471
02:52:31.270 --> 02:52:33.190
I didn't remember half the shit we were talking about.

6472
02:52:33.460 --> 02:52:34.840
We're talking about things in the news.

6473
02:52:34.841 --> 02:52:36.940
It were like a big deal that I don't remember him at all.

6474
02:52:36.941 --> 02:52:37.810
I don't remember that.

6475
02:52:38.260 --> 02:52:38.860
Yeah,

6476
02:52:38.860 --> 02:52:39.693
it's weird.

6477
02:52:39.880 --> 02:52:42.070
It's weird when you go over old podcasts.

6478
02:52:42.100 --> 02:52:45.520
We've done many of these long conversations.

6479
02:52:45.520 --> 02:52:48.070
Like if we had to go through and recap what we talked about today,

6480
02:52:48.071 --> 02:52:48.881
we probably,

6481
02:52:48.881 --> 02:52:49.240
you know,

6482
02:52:49.240 --> 02:52:50.073
would only come up.

6483
02:52:50.230 --> 02:52:51.160
We've missed some things.

6484
02:52:51.161 --> 02:52:53.350
You know what's hilarious when people come up to me and go to,

6485
02:52:53.500 --> 02:52:56.290
what was that story that you talking about in the podcast about there's like a

6486
02:52:56.291 --> 02:52:58.150
Russian guy and he got in trouble.

6487
02:52:58.151 --> 02:52:58.870
I'm like,

6488
02:52:58.870 --> 02:52:59.703
shit,

6489
02:53:00.130 --> 02:53:01.420
your guest is good as mine.

6490
02:53:01.850 --> 02:53:03.580
400 fucking typecast son.

6491
02:53:03.730 --> 02:53:04.030
Which,

6492
02:53:04.030 --> 02:53:05.080
which part of Russia?

6493
02:53:05.410 --> 02:53:05.720
Yeah,

6494
02:53:05.720 --> 02:53:06.553
Jesus.

6495
02:53:06.580 --> 02:53:07.530
Louise's.

6496
02:53:07.770 --> 02:53:08.950
There's also a lot of parts where,

6497
02:53:08.951 --> 02:53:12.520
I don't even remember if this person had been a guest on one of the podcasts

6498
02:53:12.521 --> 02:53:13.510
that I've done before,

6499
02:53:13.670 --> 02:53:14.401
so I go up to them.

6500
02:53:14.401 --> 02:53:14.621
I'm like,

6501
02:53:14.621 --> 02:53:15.454
Shit,

6502
02:53:15.520 --> 02:53:17.710
how do I know this person does this person on the pockets?

6503
02:53:17.711 --> 02:53:21.220
I'm like googling the person's name and death squad just to see if they come up.

6504
02:53:21.550 --> 02:53:22.120
Sure enough.

6505
02:53:22.120 --> 02:53:22.870
Most of the time it's like,

6506
02:53:22.870 --> 02:53:23.171
oh yeah,

6507
02:53:23.171 --> 02:53:25.900
he's a member of pointless or something.

6508
02:53:25.900 --> 02:53:26.091
Yeah,

6509
02:53:26.091 --> 02:53:26.331
yeah,

6510
02:53:26.331 --> 02:53:27.130
yeah.

6511
02:53:27.130 --> 02:53:27.820
Well,

6512
02:53:27.820 --> 02:53:29.050
we went over that number two,

6513
02:53:29.051 --> 02:53:30.460
there's that Dunbar's number.

6514
02:53:30.461 --> 02:53:35.461
You can only keep 150 sort of friendships in your head after you get over one 50

6515
02:53:35.651 --> 02:53:36.220
you're just like,

6516
02:53:36.220 --> 02:53:37.270
it's like there's no room,

6517
02:53:37.271 --> 02:53:38.320
there's no hard drive space.

6518
02:53:38.620 --> 02:53:39.730
Your hard drive is filled up.

6519
02:53:39.731 --> 02:53:41.710
And so you said those are the names you forget.

6520
02:53:41.830 --> 02:53:44.950
Even though there are people you like be happy to know their name.

6521
02:53:45.200 --> 02:53:45.400
Yeah.

6522
02:53:45.400 --> 02:53:46.750
You walk up and you're just like,

6523
02:53:46.751 --> 02:53:48.190
I don't have any fucking idea.

6524
02:53:48.220 --> 02:53:48.911
What you should do.

6525
02:53:48.911 --> 02:53:53.830
Doug Benson is go to Lumosity and learn like a name game you can play.

6526
02:53:53.840 --> 02:53:58.360
They have a motherfucking memory enhancement situation type deal where they hook

6527
02:53:58.361 --> 02:54:01.990
you up with games and if you use while he tell them that,

6528
02:54:01.991 --> 02:54:02.320
uh,

6529
02:54:02.320 --> 02:54:03.490
Joe Rogan sent you,

6530
02:54:03.760 --> 02:54:06.220
it will benefit the podcast of the allegedly.

6531
02:54:06.850 --> 02:54:07.683
They're good.

6532
02:54:07.960 --> 02:54:08.651
We like what they do.

6533
02:54:08.651 --> 02:54:08.781
I,

6534
02:54:08.781 --> 02:54:10.030
I played the games myself.

6535
02:54:10.060 --> 02:54:10.510
It's fine.

6536
02:54:10.510 --> 02:54:12.310
I think it's important to work your brain and uh,

6537
02:54:12.640 --> 02:54:13.181
besides,

6538
02:54:13.181 --> 02:54:13.630
uh,

6539
02:54:13.630 --> 02:54:16.890
doing podcasts and talking about things and doing standup and writing and things

6540
02:54:16.900 --> 02:54:17.220
like that.

6541
02:54:17.220 --> 02:54:17.770
I like,

6542
02:54:17.770 --> 02:54:19.900
I like to use my brain a bunch of different ways.

6543
02:54:19.901 --> 02:54:21.730
I like to play certain games and I think,

6544
02:54:21.731 --> 02:54:21.970
uh,

6545
02:54:21.970 --> 02:54:22.311
the,

6546
02:54:22.311 --> 02:54:24.250
the games they have on Lumosity have a real benefit.

6547
02:54:24.430 --> 02:54:25.060
Tell them that uh,

6548
02:54:25.060 --> 02:54:25.751
Joe Rogan sent.

6549
02:54:25.751 --> 02:54:26.110
Yeah,

6550
02:54:26.110 --> 02:54:26.943

6551
02:54:27.320 --> 02:54:27.940

we back at least one more time this week,

6562
02:54:53.050 --> 02:54:54.010
possibly twice.

6563
02:54:54.220 --> 02:54:55.870
I'm working on some shit son.

6564
02:54:56.050 --> 02:54:57.610
I got irons in the fire,

6565
02:54:57.760 --> 02:54:58.660
keep it moving.

6566
02:54:58.840 --> 02:54:59.181
But uh,

6567
02:54:59.181 --> 02:55:02.200
I want to thank everybody that came out to Ontario Improv this past weekend.

6568
02:55:02.201 --> 02:55:03.770
I had a god damn fence.

6569
02:55:03.860 --> 02:55:04.340
Tastic

6570
02:55:04.340 --> 02:55:04.881
<v 3>fucking shit.</v>

6571
02:55:04.881 --> 02:55:06.980
I'm going to be there a October 16th.

6572
02:55:07.050 --> 02:55:07.491
Exactly.

6573
02:55:07.491 --> 02:55:10.340
I saw they had a promo for Doug Benson.

6574
02:55:10.950 --> 02:55:11.780
I'm been,

6575
02:55:11.780 --> 02:55:12.291
I told,

6576
02:55:12.291 --> 02:55:13.760
I asked them specifically to play.

6577
02:55:13.761 --> 02:55:17.300
I don't like the whole clips before shows of other comedians thing.

6578
02:55:17.301 --> 02:55:18.230
I just think it's just,

6579
02:55:18.231 --> 02:55:18.800
uh,

6580
02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:19.580
you know,

6581
02:55:19.580 --> 02:55:21.320
there's usually not any real connection there.

6582
02:55:21.321 --> 02:55:24.240
Here's another person that tells jokes that you should come pay a lot of money.

6583
02:55:24.241 --> 02:55:24.740
You see?

6584
02:55:24.740 --> 02:55:26.750
So I'm kind of against that whole thing.

6585
02:55:27.060 --> 02:55:27.350
Uh,

6586
02:55:27.350 --> 02:55:28.220
but uh,

6587
02:55:28.280 --> 02:55:29.660
knowing that you were there last weekend,

6588
02:55:29.661 --> 02:55:34.040
I was like made sure that they were playing my clip because I know that,

6589
02:55:34.041 --> 02:55:34.191
uh,

6590
02:55:34.191 --> 02:55:39.191
you know the Joe Rogan fans are nothing if not dedicated.

6591
02:55:39.650 --> 02:55:40.500
They love you dunk bed.

6592
02:55:40.860 --> 02:55:41.220
Yeah,

6593
02:55:41.220 --> 02:55:41.690
I love,

6594
02:55:41.690 --> 02:55:43.070
I love that they come to my shows.

6595
02:55:43.071 --> 02:55:45.830
They love Joey Diaz too and Joey Diaz is performing there as soon.

6596
02:55:45.831 --> 02:55:46.700
Can't love him.

6597
02:55:46.820 --> 02:55:49.000
And for him they're playing the

6598
02:55:49.090 --> 02:55:51.820
<v 1>podcast where it goes off on ranch dressing.</v>

6599
02:55:52.270 --> 02:55:55.300
So the whole blue cheese with wings and go fuck your mother.

6600
02:55:55.301 --> 02:55:55.960
That rant.

6601
02:55:55.960 --> 02:55:58.480
Is that what they play at the beginning when they have,

6602
02:55:58.481 --> 02:55:59.470
instead of his stand up,

6603
02:55:59.471 --> 02:56:02.410
they just play him going off to do more of that smart.

6604
02:56:02.680 --> 02:56:03.470
That's a smart move.

6605
02:56:03.470 --> 02:56:05.620
It's a good way lost if I didn't bring it up.

6606
02:56:05.621 --> 02:56:07.030
Cause he told me that in private once,

6607
02:56:07.031 --> 02:56:09.490
like I heard the original one where we were just like,

6608
02:56:09.500 --> 02:56:09.780
like,

6609
02:56:09.780 --> 02:56:11.040
like Hooters or something and he's,

6610
02:56:11.041 --> 02:56:11.350
he like,

6611
02:56:11.350 --> 02:56:12.340
I fucking ran Trenton like,

6612
02:56:12.370 --> 02:56:13.240
and he went off and was like,

6613
02:56:13.241 --> 02:56:13.961
Holy Shit.

6614
02:56:13.961 --> 02:56:14.794
Ranch dressing.

6615
02:56:14.860 --> 02:56:15.820
It might've been lies,

6616
02:56:15.821 --> 02:56:18.940
but it might've come back again because someone offered him rant again the other

6617
02:56:18.940 --> 02:56:19.270
day.

6618
02:56:19.270 --> 02:56:21.970
We were hanging out again and some guy offered him ranch.

6619
02:56:22.080 --> 02:56:23.560
He would you like ranch with your wings?

6620
02:56:23.561 --> 02:56:24.311
Like a joke?

6621
02:56:24.311 --> 02:56:25.540
Like he thought it was a joke.

6622
02:56:25.570 --> 02:56:26.470
I wonder if it gets that now.

6623
02:56:26.471 --> 02:56:27.580
Like people that know who he is.

6624
02:56:27.790 --> 02:56:30.370
I'm sure they want to hear the rant in person.

6625
02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:32.660
I do not think this particular gentleman was,

6626
02:56:32.661 --> 02:56:33.510
he was trolling,

6627
02:56:33.750 --> 02:56:35.890
I think he has really just offering them ranch with Wayne.

6628
02:56:35.891 --> 02:56:36.101
He's like,

6629
02:56:36.101 --> 02:56:36.201
what?

6630
02:56:36.201 --> 02:56:37.240
What do you got with your wings?

6631
02:56:37.600 --> 02:56:38.291
And the guy was like,

6632
02:56:38.291 --> 02:56:39.400
well I can get you some ranch sir.

6633
02:56:39.430 --> 02:56:39.590
Like,

6634
02:56:39.590 --> 02:56:40.570
he's pretty serious.

6635
02:56:40.620 --> 02:56:41.453
He'll fucking ranch.

6636
02:56:41.470 --> 02:56:42.490
I want no fucking ranch.

6637
02:56:43.150 --> 02:56:43.840
And he's,

6638
02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:45.160
he was a very mild about it.

6639
02:56:45.161 --> 02:56:46.090
He wasn't rude.

6640
02:56:46.140 --> 02:56:47.200
I Hate Asian Pussy.

6641
02:56:48.370 --> 02:56:50.560
I say what you hate.

6642
02:56:50.561 --> 02:56:50.861
And then they,

6643
02:56:50.861 --> 02:56:51.980
people just started giving it to you.

6644
02:56:52.430 --> 02:56:54.880
Nevermind Jesus Christ.

6645
02:56:54.940 --> 02:56:58.150
I can say that October 31st I'm going to be in San Diego,

6646
02:56:58.240 --> 02:56:58.870
uh,

6647
02:56:58.870 --> 02:57:02.050
deaf squad Halloween show with Sam Aaa and Tony Hinchcliffe and a bunch of

6648
02:57:02.051 --> 02:57:02.920
surprise guests.

6649
02:57:03.820 --> 02:57:04.653
Tell the name of the club.

6650
02:57:04.660 --> 02:57:04.721
Oh,

6651
02:57:04.721 --> 02:57:06.100
American comedy show.com.

6652
02:57:07.710 --> 02:57:09.150
<v 3>I'm going to be there too in November,</v>

6653
02:57:09.151 --> 02:57:10.920
I think like the night before thanksgiving.

6654
02:57:10.950 --> 02:57:11.783
Beautiful.

6655
02:57:11.880 --> 02:57:12.391
Um,

6656
02:57:12.391 --> 02:57:13.580
next thing I got to come,

6657
02:57:13.581 --> 02:57:17.010
only plugs I'm going to do are ones that are same place that you guys have been.

6658
02:57:17.100 --> 02:57:17.940
October 18th.

6659
02:57:17.941 --> 02:57:19.140
I'm in Houston at the bar.

6660
02:57:19.141 --> 02:57:22.020
You Music Center with a Beautiful Thompson Gora.

6661
02:57:22.370 --> 02:57:22.740
Uh,

6662
02:57:22.740 --> 02:57:24.930
and then I'll be there in November.

6663
02:57:24.990 --> 02:57:25.750
Houston.

6664
02:57:25.750 --> 02:57:26.583
How are you feeling?

6665
02:57:26.820 --> 02:57:27.390
What are you doing?

6666
02:57:27.390 --> 02:57:27.571
Hey,

6667
02:57:27.571 --> 02:57:29.610
can you give me that driver's name and Info?

6668
02:57:29.790 --> 02:57:31.410
Do you still use the same driver in Houston?

6669
02:57:31.890 --> 02:57:32.670
That guy's great.

6670
02:57:32.670 --> 02:57:33.503
Yeah.

6671
02:57:33.510 --> 02:57:34.290
Okay.

6672
02:57:34.290 --> 02:57:34.711
That's it.

6673
02:57:34.711 --> 02:57:35.544
It's fucking shows over.

6674
02:57:35.550 --> 02:57:35.701
Oh,

6675
02:57:35.701 --> 02:57:36.451
November 1st,

6676
02:57:36.451 --> 02:57:38.040
second and third of the Irvine Improv.

6677
02:57:38.470 --> 02:57:39.020
Um,

6678
02:57:39.020 --> 02:57:40.140
I'll be there in December.

6679
02:57:40.430 --> 02:57:41.730
I've been doing a lot of clubs lately,

6680
02:57:41.731 --> 02:57:42.360
man.

6681
02:57:42.360 --> 02:57:42.671
I mean,

6682
02:57:42.671 --> 02:57:42.900
uh,

6683
02:57:42.900 --> 02:57:44.180
doing like weekends a clubs.

6684
02:57:44.190 --> 02:57:45.360
I kind of stopped doing that for a while.

6685
02:57:45.361 --> 02:57:46.060
You're playing these days.

6686
02:57:46.060 --> 02:57:48.900
They got a lot of these kind of like big clubs that are practically like playing

6687
02:57:48.901 --> 02:57:49.470
a theater.

6688
02:57:49.470 --> 02:57:49.741
Yeah.

6689
02:57:49.741 --> 02:57:54.630
But I really like the size of the Irvine Improv or the Ontario Improv or break.

6690
02:57:54.660 --> 02:57:55.850
That shit's perfect.

6691
02:57:55.880 --> 02:57:56.250
Yeah,

6692
02:57:56.250 --> 02:57:59.070
that's what I'm really enjoying more than anything.

6693
02:57:59.250 --> 02:58:02.280
So like doing these shows in of like a tight

6694
02:58:02.280 --> 02:58:02.670
<v 5>group,</v>

6695
02:58:02.670 --> 02:58:03.390
like a club,

6696
02:58:03.390 --> 02:58:04.080
a real club.

6697
02:58:04.080 --> 02:58:06.350
It feels like a club and a theater like in one year.

6698
02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:08.340
That's very a very good experience.

6699
02:58:08.430 --> 02:58:09.780
The right amount of people.

6700
02:58:09.870 --> 02:58:10.890
I like doing both.

6701
02:58:10.891 --> 02:58:11.820
I like mixing it up,

6702
02:58:11.821 --> 02:58:12.181
but man,

6703
02:58:12.181 --> 02:58:14.250
I'm really enjoying the shit out of doing a lot of clubs.

6704
02:58:14.590 --> 02:58:14.960
Not Fair.

6705
02:58:14.960 --> 02:58:16.440
When people are sitting far away from you,

6706
02:58:16.441 --> 02:58:17.580
it's not really a,

6707
02:58:17.610 --> 02:58:18.090
you know,

6708
02:58:18.090 --> 02:58:19.500
they might as well just be listening to it.

6709
02:58:19.501 --> 02:58:19.890
If you can't,

6710
02:58:19.890 --> 02:58:20.671
if they can't see you,

6711
02:58:20.671 --> 02:58:22.680
you know there's that and it's also you,

6712
02:58:22.710 --> 02:58:23.220
you,

6713
02:58:23.220 --> 02:58:26.040
you also can't totally hear everything that's going on in the room.

6714
02:58:26.070 --> 02:58:29.400
There's a lot of a weirdness when you're in a big room where the people are

6715
02:58:29.401 --> 02:58:30.234
laughing.

6716
02:58:30.530 --> 02:58:32.190
If you can't keep tagging things,

6717
02:58:32.191 --> 02:58:35.520
y'all gotta wait til after it dies down or you can't hear what the guy saying

6718
02:58:35.760 --> 02:58:36.570
like I've been though,

6719
02:58:36.570 --> 02:58:39.930
I saw Louis Black recently and I realized that while I was in the crowd,

6720
02:58:39.931 --> 02:58:40.260
I was like,

6721
02:58:40.260 --> 02:58:40.351
oh,

6722
02:58:40.351 --> 02:58:41.760
I can't understand what the fuck he's saying.

6723
02:58:41.940 --> 02:58:43.740
Like while everyone's laughing hard.

6724
02:58:43.830 --> 02:58:44.420
Yeah.

6725
02:58:44.420 --> 02:58:45.060
All Right,

6726
02:58:45.060 --> 02:58:45.570
folks,

6727
02:58:45.570 --> 02:58:47.430
we love the shit out of yet and we'll see you soon.

6728
02:58:48.780 --> 02:58:49.613
That's it.

6729
02:58:50.030 --> 02:58:50.710
Yeah.

6730
02:58:50.710 --> 02:58:51.160
<v 13>Big Kiss.</v>
