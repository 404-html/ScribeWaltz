<v Speaker 1>my personality,</v>

81
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.320
<v Speaker 1>all developed under duress.</v>

82
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 1>It all developed under a physical combat all the time on a regular basis.</v>

83
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Constant training,</v>

84
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 1>constant fights,</v>

85
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:09.190
<v Speaker 1>constant tournament's that was,</v>

86
00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

87
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 1>that was my life from like the time I was 15 till I was 22 all my formative</v>

88
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:14.740
<v Speaker 1>years was all spent in,</v>

89
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 1>in stress.</v>

90
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>And I remember when I first decided that I wasn't going to fight anymore.</v>

91
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>I was like the first time ever in my life when I was like 22 it's my last</v>

92
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing fights.</v>

93
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>The first time ever where I could relax,</v>

94
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.910
<v Speaker 1>I would always like be nervous.</v>

95
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Like when is the next tournament?</v>

96
00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:29.160
<v Speaker 1>When's the next fight?</v>

97
00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>When's the next thing I got to get in shape?</v>

98
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>I can't be drinking this.</v>

99
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.543
<v Speaker 1>I can't be doing this.</v>

100
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't live my life because I was always worried about getting my ass kicked.</v>

101
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.540
<v Speaker 1>I was always worrying about like,</v>

102
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.280
<v Speaker 1>I have to make sure that I do everything right.</v>

103
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.300
<v Speaker 1>I had to be prepared.</v>

104
00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get fucked up,</v>

105
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.771
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

106
00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:41.340
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

107
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

108
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't the best mindset to go into stand up comedy for,</v>

109
00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:46.321
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

110
00:02:46.321 --> 00:02:48.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like a constant battle because standup comedy,</v>

111
00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:49.194
<v Speaker 1>you got to,</v>

112
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.220
<v Speaker 1>it's totally the opposite.</v>

113
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>You've got to not give a fuck.</v>

114
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.691
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

115
00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:52.290
<v Speaker 1>you gotta,</v>

116
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.220
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be relaxed.</v>

117
00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:56.370
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have fun instead of be tense and ready to go at any moment's</v>

118
00:02:56.371 --> 00:02:56.761
<v Speaker 1>notice.</v>

<v Speaker 1>whatever you sent me,</v>

123
00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work.</v>

124
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.761
<v Speaker 1>One of them doesn't work.</v>

125
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:01.594
<v Speaker 1>The other two do.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Check her emails.</v>

127
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 1>You sent me two things and both of them are like movies that are one second long</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

134
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

135
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.671

139
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:20.261
<v Speaker 1>I was a fighter,</v>

140
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 1>but I was in a different type of hell.</v>

141
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:22.444
<v Speaker 1>I was in my own hall.</v>

142
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>I was putting myself into,</v>

143
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:24.394
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.330

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.200

00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:32.011
<v Speaker 1>eight years later or something like that and how I took that wildness into the</v>

150
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>fucking comic and nobody understood what I was saying until I met you guys at</v>

151
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:36.604
<v Speaker 1>the store.</v>

152
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>I filed the fucking home.</v>

153
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:38.651
<v Speaker 1>I was always,</v>

154
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 1>I used to travel on the road with Dribbble and to all these little road.</v>

155
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:42.120
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

156
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I first met you at the store,</v>

157
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:45.370
<v Speaker 1>everybody was fucking terrified of you.</v>

158
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

159
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 1>I was crazy and I was letting you,</v>

00:04:30.171 --> 00:04:32.140
<v Speaker 1>a large group of people that for whatever reason,</v>

195
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:33.040
<v Speaker 1>they'd be upset at you.</v>

196
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.311
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

197
00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 1>I remember having to defend you,</v>

198

<v Speaker 1>even a dom Arrera,</v>

199
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:36.131
<v Speaker 1>even.</v>

200
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:36.311
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

201
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Merera was hate nine year for everybody.</v>

202
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Every and I don't get,</v>

203
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:39.551
<v Speaker 1>and I loved it.</v>

204
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:41.230
<v Speaker 1>I fucking loved it because that's what I,</v>

205
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

206
00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:44.830
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird that this whole surgery thing really taught me about fear.</v>

207
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.290
<v Speaker 1>My fear has fucking done wonders for me because that's why when I wake up in the</v>

208
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:50.490
<v Speaker 1>molest,</v>

209
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.350
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I stopped him do is grab my fucking cock.</v>

210
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Because for years I was scared.</v>

211
00:04:56.171 --> 00:05:01.171
<v Speaker 1>I'm always insecure that immigrant fucking things shizzle into my fucking mind.</v>

212
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Since the streets in New York City with the White Kid,</v>

213
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.051
<v Speaker 1>the immigrant thing,</v>

214
00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:06.160
<v Speaker 1>not knowing the language,</v>

215
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:07.690
<v Speaker 1>not feeling good enough like everybody else,</v>

216
00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:11.170
<v Speaker 1>not being a fucking American and it sits inside my fucking soul.</v>

217
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.640
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

218
00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:14.290
<v Speaker 1>everything has been ribbon on fear.</v>

219
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Every time I get on stage,</v>

220
00:05:15.711 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Speaker 1>it's like the other night fear was real in Chicago.</v>

221
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.300
<v Speaker 1>I got on stage in between the reefer and whatever was going on and the lights.</v>

222
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Speaker 1>I got fearful man,</v>

223
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.371
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

224
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:25.810
<v Speaker 1>That's normal to be scared.</v>

225
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.100
<v Speaker 1>That's a great emotion,</v>

226
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:28.660
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're a standup comic,</v>

227
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 1>because when go,</v>

228
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 1>the more schedule,</v>

229
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.590
<v Speaker 1>the better you're going to fucking do.</v>

230
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Especially in my case,</v>

231
00:05:33.821 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 1>the more riled up I am.</v>

232
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Two minutes before I go on stage,</v>

233
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.340
<v Speaker 1>the more energy I'm going to give that fucking audience.</v>

234
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>But I've looked at my life and I've seen how much fear I was petrified to go get</v>

235
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:44.680
<v Speaker 1>that fucking needle,</v>

236
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.920
<v Speaker 1>even though I fucking knew nothing was going to happen.</v>

237
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.010
<v Speaker 1>I was going to walk out of there,</v>

238
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.271
<v Speaker 1>but I went in,</v>

239
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 1>I took the needle after I walked out of that and be like,</v>

240
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:54.310
<v Speaker 1>could have fucking killed 10 fucking people with my bare hands because you</v>

241
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 1>overcome one of your biggest fucking fears.</v>

242
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Till this day I get little emails and people,</v>

243
00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

244
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I suffer,</v>

245
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.801
<v Speaker 1>I suffer,</v>

246
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 1>I suffer from a social disorder and I don't know what to do with the answer and</v>

247
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:05.480
<v Speaker 1>taking a fucking pill.</v>

248
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 1>It's checking your fucking confidence and grabbing your balls and walking into a</v>

249
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:09.914
<v Speaker 1>circle and saying,</v>

250
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.581
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

251
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm here.</v>

252
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

253
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 1>my mentality was always go into little mouth of the lion and put a chair down</v>

254
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 1>and sit the fuck down and let the pieces fall where they may.</v>

255
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.310
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not going to live like that,</v>

256
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.263
<v Speaker 1>fuck them more.</v>

257
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.171
<v Speaker 1>I'm at the store too.</v>

258
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:21.741
<v Speaker 1>Fucking nights.</v>

259
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:22.251
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan,</v>

260
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:24.020
<v Speaker 1>the first fucking night Eddie Griffin bumps me.</v>

261
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:25.130
<v Speaker 1>You know how embarrassing it is?</v>

262
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 1>You become a regular on a Sunday,</v>

263
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.600
<v Speaker 1>the first fucking night you let bring 11 people that come see you,</v>

264
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:32.300
<v Speaker 1>your landlord comes and you get bumped by Eddie Griffin.</v>

265
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.890
<v Speaker 1>And the second night I grew up getting,</v>

266
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Steve Greenstein says to me,</v>

267

271
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.401

273
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.130

276
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Steve Greenstein,</v>

277
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember if it was a creepy guy,</v>

278
00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:52.660
<v Speaker 1>older guy hanging out at the comedy store.</v>

279
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 1>He had a violin case.</v>

280
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.190

282
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.861
<v Speaker 1>It's eight o'clock.</v>

283
00:06:57.861 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 1>The main room was packed with the original room BMP because people were scared</v>

284
00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:03.020
<v Speaker 1>to go up there and black knight because they thought they were going to get</v>

285
00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:03.854
<v Speaker 1>fucking mug.</v>

286
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.420
