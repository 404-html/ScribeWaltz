00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>I think it shocked a lot of people.</v>

15
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know what to do with it,</v>

16
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.770
<v Speaker 1>because it was so out there,</v>

18
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:16.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's like it was one of the ultimate stoner movies.</v>

19
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.150

<v Speaker 1>It feels a lot.</v>

158
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I'm saying is,</v>

<v Speaker 1>thanks for bringing it up,</v>

160
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>but this is great to be out and actually getting all this positive feedback</v>

161
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 1>about the movie because I was made to feel like this is word or somebody who,</v>

162
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.850
<v Speaker 1>this is what I know.</v>

163
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 1>You're a victim of a pre-internet review system.</v>

164
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 1>It was a bunch of fogy old douche bags and you know the way people looked at</v>

165
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:29.104
<v Speaker 1>things was,</v>

166
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't just when,</v>

168
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>what year was Freddy got fingered?</v>

169
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>It was 2001 yeah.</v>

170
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck was on the Internet back then?</v>

171
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.901
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

172
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the same as 2010 and the thing that doesn't attend,</v>

173
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.160
<v Speaker 1>you get your reviews from,</v>

174
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:39.671
<v Speaker 1>ain't it cool.</v>

175
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 1>Dot news.com like that kind of shit.</v>

176
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Like I always go to Fandango or something.</v>

177
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 1>I get my reviews online.</v>

178
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 1>I want to use this moment as a,</v>

179
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:47.210
<v Speaker 1>as a real,</v>

180
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a real opportunity for me to actually talk about this for a second.</v>

181
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

182
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.240
<v Speaker 1>I directed this movie,</v>

183
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.040
<v Speaker 1>but he wrote this whole thing.</v>

184
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Everybody freaks out on it.</v>

185
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 1>It's Pre-internet,</v>

186
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

187
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.221
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

188
00:03:57.221 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 1>the other day I went and I looked at a Netflix.</v>

189
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:00.341
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

190
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 1>At the,</v>

191
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>of the reviews of the movies,</v>

192
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:02.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

193
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.050
<v Speaker 1>So I did this just two days ago and I looked at the review as a pretty good</v>

194
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 1>finger.</v>

195
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.010
<v Speaker 1>And the point of making that movie was to kind of like be polarizing,</v>

196
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

197
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 1>It was supposed to be ridiculous.</v>

198
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 1>It was done in a way where I think that 50% of the people who watch it are</v>

199
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>definitely going to hate it more than anything they've ever seen in their entire</v>

200
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

201
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.680
<v Speaker 1>And that was the goal to,</v>

202
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:21.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 1>and the Joe is obviously the other 50% of the people are laughing at the 50% of</v>

204
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:25.121
<v Speaker 1>the people that hate it.</v>

205
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:25.341
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

206
00:04:25.341 --> 00:04:25.551
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

207
00:04:25.551 --> 00:04:26.201
<v Speaker 1>that's the joke,</v>

208
00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:26.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

209
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

210
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 1>I went on Netflix and you're reading the reviews and it's,</v>

211
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.870
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much 50 50 people are giving it either,</v>

212
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

213
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:36.310
<v Speaker 1>a good review or the worst review you've ever read in your life back and forth,</v>

214
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 1>back and forth.</v>

215
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.220
<v Speaker 1>And these people are just arguing with each other about it.</v>

216
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.203
<v Speaker 1>And I'm looking at it.</v>

217
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Here we are 10 years later after I made this thing and looking at these people,</v>

218
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:47.230
<v Speaker 1>having these passionate arguments completely on opposite ends of the spectrum.</v>

219
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.430
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty funny.</v>

220
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 1>So I like that.</v>

221
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Go read the reviews on this sequence.</v>

222
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.511
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

223
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>truly believe that if that movie came out today,</v>

224
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:56.230
<v Speaker 1>it would be an internet phenomenon.</v>

225
00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 1>People would be so into it.</v>

226
00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.370
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a,</v>

227
00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.470
<v Speaker 1>it was a fucking fun,</v>

228
00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

229
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:00.813
<v Speaker 1>Make it three d</v>

230
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
