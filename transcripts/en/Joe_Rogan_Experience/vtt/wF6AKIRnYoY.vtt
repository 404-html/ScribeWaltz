1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I still feel a big,</v>

4
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.450
<v Speaker 1>big difference from these and the clinical trial that we did,</v>

5
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:07.950
<v Speaker 1>the double blind that was with this,</v>

6
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.180
<v Speaker 1>this particular formula,</v>

7
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>but I still think that we should release a fucking hyper version for people are</v>

8
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>savages.</v>

9
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:13.701
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

10
00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 1>you want to get crazy?</v>

11
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't want her own calling crossbones on it.</v>

12
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>If we can't release it,</v>

13
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.760
<v Speaker 1>can I at least get some</v>

14
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.993
<v Speaker 1>combination?</v>

15
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.953
<v Speaker 1>We can get you something.</v>

16
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.261
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

17
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>I think this is just the beginning of this sort of science of a,</v>

18
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:31.740
<v Speaker 1>of nootropics and they're coming up with all sorts of different combinations.</v>

19
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.230
<v Speaker 1>These things Paratha town.</v>

20
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 1>I want that stuff to be like in Olean.</v>

21
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.491
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's America in a nutshell.</v>

26
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's wants to be a lazy fuck that you take a pill and then set your</v>

27
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.293
<v Speaker 1>suits.</v>

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.553
<v Speaker 1>Gotta work for it though.</v>

29
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny though how many God damn movies there are about a dumb person all</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

32
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>like John Travolta when you got hit by lightning.</v>

33
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.990
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] was outside with the polar turning gets struck by lightning and</v>

38
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:03.211
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

39
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:04.044
<v Speaker 1>So like it'd be smarter.</v>

40
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.231
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

41
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 1>you know what does work with some things like people have,</v>

42
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:12.381
<v Speaker 1>like I have a friend and her son got in a motorcycle accident and then he got a</v>

43
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>head injury and became super artistic after the motorcycle injury.</v>

44
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>So we do need to get hit in the head.</v>

46
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Well [inaudible] science,</v>

47
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.113
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>

48
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Sam Kinison got hit and they had a,</v>

49
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>when he was a kid too,</v>

50
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:27.840
<v Speaker 1>he got hit by a truck.</v>

51
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.021

<v Speaker 1>shy kid.</v>

58
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:34.560
<v Speaker 1>And then he got hit by a truck and Sinai.</v>

59
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.710
<v Speaker 1>He became this fucking wild,</v>

60
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.780
<v Speaker 1>impulsive maniac.</v>

61

00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:43.711
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>

66
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>The reactions that a,</v>

67
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 1>that had her injuries have,</v>

68
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:49.740
<v Speaker 1>people have had car accidents and then become gay.</v>

70
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.000

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.353
<v Speaker 1>I might have.</v>

74
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.140
<v Speaker 1>I might have made that at all.</v>

75
00:01:56.141 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

76
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

77
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.721
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>

78
00:01:57.721 --> 00:01:59.320
<v Speaker 1>The head trauma turns it up.</v>

79
00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.761
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

80
00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:00.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

81
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Some guy who was,</v>

82
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>who was gay and just use that as an excuse.</v>

83
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.493
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

84
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not judging it.</v>

85
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Rugby player wakes up gay after a stroke.</v>

86
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.920
<v Speaker 1>He had a stroke and then he woke up and he was gay.</v>

88
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Someone took care of him when he was barely rugby player has a stroke after</v>

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.681
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.701
<v Speaker 1>It's cool.</v>

95
00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:24.001
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

96
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:26.900
<v Speaker 1>You know this is actually earlier but so does not look</v>

97
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.500
<v Speaker 1>like a rugby player either.</v>

98
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.750
<v Speaker 1>But I mean he doesn't even make up an excuse of getting hit in the head to be</v>

99
00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:35.300
<v Speaker 1>game and just whoever your gates.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

102
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Maybe really did have a stroke and woke up gay,</v>

103
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>but he used to look like straight as fuck.</v>

104

110
00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:58.191
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was like 600,000 US dollars because this drug turned him gay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And into a addict.</v>

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.790
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't mind being that girl for a day.</v>

403
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:00.653
<v Speaker 1>This is what I say.</v>

404
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.010
<v Speaker 1>If I was,</v>

405
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:02.401
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

406
00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:05.880
<v Speaker 1>if there is a possibility that you could go into someone's mind,</v>

407
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:06.841
<v Speaker 1>like say this,</v>

408
00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:07.410
<v Speaker 1>say if you,</v>

409
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.980
<v Speaker 1>you and your girlfriend got together and you went into a machine and you swapped</v>

410
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:11.814
<v Speaker 1>positions.</v>

411
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Like she became the girl and you became the guy.</v>

412
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Like you had all your knowledge of life,</v>

413
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.820
<v Speaker 1>but all of a sudden you thought like a girl and you wanted to get fucked and you</v>

414
00:10:20.821 --> 00:10:23.220
<v Speaker 1>want to get fucked by you because she's,</v>

415
00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:24.054
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

416
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.590
<v Speaker 1>and you are her.</v>

417
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.880
<v Speaker 1>So you liked boys and you liked you and like that would be a way that you could</v>

418
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:33.210
<v Speaker 1>be gay but not be gay because you'd be gay for yourself.</v>

419
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.350
<v Speaker 1>So you would switch positions with your girlfriend or,</v>

420
00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.570
<v Speaker 1>or why you have her thoughts and she would be banging you doggy style.</v>

421
00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:39.781
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

422
00:10:39.781 --> 00:10:39.931
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:40.900
<v Speaker 1>this does hurt my servant.</v>

424
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.440
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of annoying.</v>

425
00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:44.280
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't lying.</v>

426
00:10:44.281 --> 00:10:45.114
<v Speaker 1>She could be you.</v>

427
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.580
<v Speaker 1>She can feel what it's like to get head and go,</v>

428
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:47.851
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

429
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:50.400
<v Speaker 1>now I know why you're always trying to get me to do this.</v>

430
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.080
<v Speaker 1>This is pretty awesome.</v>

431
00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:53.770
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

432
00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:54.331
<v Speaker 1>it's odd.</v>

433
00:10:54.331 --> 00:10:56.670
<v Speaker 1>I like it better when I'm looking at it crazy.</v>

434
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.430
<v Speaker 1>I like it better when I'm looking at you doing this.</v>

435
00:10:59.431 --> 00:11:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I never would have imagined that.</v>

436
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Now I know why you're always creeping me out.</v>

437
00:11:02.551 --> 00:11:02.980
<v Speaker 1>They didn't.</v>

438
00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.120
<v Speaker 1>I need to invent this machine just to make the relationship better and make</v>

439
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.000
<v Speaker 1>everyone's relationship.</v>

440
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.780
