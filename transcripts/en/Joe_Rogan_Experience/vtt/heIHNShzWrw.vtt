1
00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.390
Thanks buddy.
Bye there.
We started guns.
We do really good ads again,
man.

2
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:06.603
Listen folks,

3
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.900
I'm a retard because I'm a little tech friend.

4
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.210
My technologically enhanced friend.
Yeah.
I don't know how the fuck to do this.

5
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.510
I'm just winging this shit son.
It's the bath.
Just guessing and flipping cue.

6
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.440
You were able to fade the song out.
Yeah,
I did a good job with that.

7
00:00:23.441 --> 00:00:27.430
Let me make sure that if I switched to this view that we people still here.
It

8
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.340
still here.
Whoa.
That's me.

9
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.350
I'm a retard grom.
He's just done another system.
All retarded person.

10
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.260
I trust me.
I'm,

11
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.120
<v 1>I get an argument with someone in the middle of argument.</v>

12
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.930
They think of what's seven times 40 and I'm like,
I don't fucking know.
I'm,

13
00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:51.100
I'm,
we're upset at each other.
I can't do math.

14
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.590
I fuck you asked me to do man.
What kind of tricks it,

15
00:00:53.591 --> 00:00:57.310
they tried to make me think I'm stupid.
It was like mission accomplished.

16
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.700
I don't know.
There's a lot of numbers.
I'm done with numbers,
dude.

17
00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:02.530
I'm really done with numbers.
Yeah.
Yeah.

18
00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:07.531
I have to really force myself because when I was a kid I just had really bad

19
00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.450
times in math.
I thought it was so boring.

20
00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:13.330
I had a terrible attitude about it and I never had anybody who was like an

21
00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:18.100
enthusiastic math teacher and my teachers would not terrible,
terrible teachers.

22
00:01:18.101 --> 00:01:21.650
They just were bored.
They just were uninspired,
you know?

23
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.500
They weren't really into it.

24
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.500
Like I remember one time there was a documentary on about Lake Erie and it was

25
00:01:27.641 --> 00:01:30.640
just one crazy science professor or in our class science teacher,

26
00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:35.360
I guess Mr. Holman and he was always like late with the facts.
Oh really?
Yeah.

27
00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:39.380
I just always like,
you know some shit that was true like a while ago.
He,

28
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.120
he would not be like kept up to it this,
oh this,
this thing was,

29
00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:46.750
and he just kept saying,
he kind of,
yeah,
it was about Lake Erie.

30
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:47.860
There was like the world's no around.

31
00:01:47.861 --> 00:01:52.810
It's oval there he was insisting that Lake Erie was a dying lake and I said,

32
00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:53.644
really?
Yeah,

33
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.940
well you know a dead lake because Lake Erie really is because it's going to dry

34
00:01:57.941 --> 00:02:02.730
up.
He can know really badly polluted.
Um,
but no life in it.
Yeah.

35
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.400
I think Lake Erie had to make a big comeback but they,

36
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.020
they cleaned it up and this was that.

37
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.800
There was a whole documentary that was on PBS like really recently,

38
00:02:11.801 --> 00:02:14.980
like in the night before and me and another kid in the class,

39
00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:16.620
we're talking about the documentary.
I was like what?

40
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.850
We just saw something on PBS that said it's making its comeback.

41
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.420
Shirley's fisherman and they show the exact some guy who went to school 40 years

42
00:02:25.421 --> 00:02:29.920
ago but he didn't even listen to us.
He dismissed it.

43
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.840
He didn't want to talk about it.

44
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.850
He didn't acknowledge that maybe there was some possibly some new data that he

45
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:40.730
had been like teaching some shit that somebody figured out in 1980 or something

46
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.740
and then this is some new back then if you weren't really like on top of shit

47
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.140
you like really on top of what the fuck is going on in the news.

48
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.580
If you're free balling on stage in front of the class telling people that and

49
00:02:54.581 --> 00:02:58.660
that's why Lake Erie is a dead lake.
And then some kid goes,
no,

50
00:02:58.661 --> 00:02:59.980
it's not dead.
They,
there

51
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.460
<v 2>was a whole documentary on TV,
man.
And he said,
fuck you.
No,</v>

52
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.780
we didn't listen.
He didn't want to even,
he didn't even want to acknowledge it.

53
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.470
Whereas like if you said that to me,
if you said there was a whole dot,

54
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.450
if I was saying,
obviously I'm,
where did you hear that?
I'm not,

55
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:18.100
obviously I'm not a fucking teacher,
but if,
you know,
if,
if,
if you,

56
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.810
for whatever reason we're talking to me about that and you,

57
00:03:21.811 --> 00:03:25.180
you brought up that PBS ran a whole documentary on it,
I would have to go,
Ooh,

58
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:29.500
I didn't see that.
I would have to go,
oh wow,
there's this new stuff.

59
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:31.990
Maybe this one improvement.
So that's good news.

60
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.860
It's good news and science can actually clean up the ocean and the rivers and

61
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:39.280
the lakes as well as faculty.
Surprise to hear it.
Yeah.
It's nice.
Well,

62
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:43.000
it is beautiful that they have made some pretty significant,
um,
uh,

63
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.170
they have had some pretty significant results and cleaning up some types of

64
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.860
spills and they've introduced have,

65
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.050
they've come up with new types of bacteria that actually eat oil and can help

66
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:58.210
clean up places like the Gulf and situations like that.

67
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.080
You know what I heard about that pile of plastic,

68
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:05.440
they always talk about when they say how big is it?
Like twice the size of Texas.

69
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.550
They said that's such a humongously gross exaggeration.

70
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.790
Well it's less than one 100th of the size of Texas real.

71
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:16.210
And they said that that kind of exaggeration discredits the actual problem

72
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:19.720
that's there cause it makes people write off everything.
It's humongous.

73
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.930
But Texas is massive.
Right?

74
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.900
So they're just being like typical liberals.

75
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.460
Anyone wants to like make sure everyone knows about it.
Yeah,

76
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:33.370
well it's like I held my breath for 10 seconds.
Like oh that's a long time.

77
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:34.600
Like someone else would want.
So we like,

78
00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:36.520
I held my breath for five minutes and you're like,
no you didn't.

79
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.360
You went too far.
Well you can do that.
There was a guy,

80
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:44.950
I'm the David Blaine Guy I think holds a world record minutes.
Oh,
more than that.

81
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.450
What?
Yeah,
more than that.
I think he did something crazy like 13 or 14 minutes.

82
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.060
Really?
He,
um,
he held,
he's got the world record.
I'm pretty sure the reason,

83
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.610
I know that sounds crazy.
It's like a train.
It's 13 or 14 minutes.
So stupid.

84
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.370
You don't know where I'm getting this from.
Brian Cowen.
Oh really?

85
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.640
Fucking love Brunch.
And he had a hawk on the shoulder the whole time.

86
00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:07.910
Right counts.
Piece of beautiful person.
I couldn't love that dude.
Um,

87
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.950
it might be true though because David Blaine's David blank column,

88
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.860
magician calling whatever the fuck you want to do.

89
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.260
I will call David Blaine a bad motherfucker.
Okay.

90
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:19.870
Cause I couldn't stand that ice first ones that everybody in the new one or the

91
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:24.550
old one who's the crazy guy that would like hang out in a box and you know,

92
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.980
supply.
No.
Did he,
did he do something like that?

93
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:31.410
Somebody did that.
He doesn't take it.

94
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.990
That's the type of guy that would make the statue of liberty disappear

95
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.463
holding Breck,

96
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.480
somebody's Aruba for fucking however long breath world record.

97
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.110
13 or 14 I mean nuts.
I couldn't do it for 30 seconds.
Yeah,

98
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:51.540
I'm not so good at holding my breath.
You know what Brian and my time are.

99
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.240
We though that was one of the greatest things that anybody's ever said.
Oh,
okay.

100
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:58.160
17 and all my God.

101
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.140
<v 0>17 and a half minutes.
No,
no.
17 minutes.
Four and a half seconds.</v>

102
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.310
Holy Shit.
How long did it for?
Yes.

103
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.780
Oh my God.
This is insane,
man.

104
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.180
How the fuck did he do that?

105
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.150
That that's not just kind of crazy to think of held long like the time is

106
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.580
between like a sitcom scene starting and then they go to commercial.

107
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.730
How many is that?
How many minutes is that?

108
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:30.170
Is that seven minutes or something like that?

109
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.880
Two of those dude plus some.

110
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.770
That's a long time.
Think of like an episode of friends,

111
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.310
like two of those things that held the fucking crazy.
I'm Marcia.
Oh my God.

112
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.610
Well before they go to commercial,
Turner,
Turner.
Think of that.

113
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:51.500
He's held his breath through that whole thing and then some two are those?

114
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.640
Yes.
Well that was just 40 seconds.
That seemed like forever.
Yeah.

115
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:58.840
He's a weird man.
Um,
he,
yeah,

116
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.220
he goes all the way through the first break and the second break.

117
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.050
If that guy was a fighter,
he would be a scary guy.
They've a blend.

118
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.140
You ever see black people react to him?
No.
It's hilarious.
What do they do?

119
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.790
Black people still have a weird thing about magic.
Um,
and they react like,

120
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.170
no,
no.

121
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.010
They push each other and shove and run away because they have weird thing.

122
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:22.580
They can just can't say like it's a trick.
They feel strange about it.

123
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.480
It's hilarious.
Wow.
Lots of very scared of his magic.

124
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.010
That scared the scare of magic in general.
Really.
That's a racist thing to say.

125
00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:33.850
Ours.
Your fear.
We're scared.
Observation.
What?

126
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.070
I grew up with elders teaching me that black people are scared of magic.

127
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.750
I watched,
by the way,
I learned a Jewish,
a horror movie the other day.

128
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.430
What was it?
That girl was pretty,
now this new movie.
The,

129
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:48.980
um,
what the fuck is it called?

130
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.500
The possession or some shit.
Like the box.
Yes.
You saw that.

131
00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.470
Did you realize a small part in it?
Yeah.
It was fucking good.

132
00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:04.420
But about the holding up a fucking evil spirit.
It's a box.

133
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.490
That was a good horror movie,
right?
I mean,
yeah.
I mean it was no,

134
00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:11.060
apocalypse now was a fun horror movie.
I enjoy the shit out of it.

135
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.990
The dude from the watchman that looks like Brad Garrett,

136
00:08:14.991 --> 00:08:18.930
but he's not Brad Garrett.
Here's what I got to start doing.
Yeah,
I know that guy.

137
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.800
Here's what I started doing it and I start going to movies and saying,

138
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.550
this is just supposed to be dumb fun.
That's all this is supposed to be,
right?

139
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.040
Yeah.
Expendables or whatever you call him down for.

140

143
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.390

144
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.830
I'm going to go see 50 shades of gray to just to find out what the fuck is going

145

Right.
It's,

146
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.040
Here's what a not getting our rocks off girl.
Yeah.

147
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.530
Girls want the porn just like we want it,
but theirs is not what we want.

148
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.590
There's a romance porn.
There's a,
there's a different kind of porn.

149
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:02.340
There's a vampire who will risk everything just to be with them.
You know guys?

150
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.610
Yeah,
exactly.
My mom,
you know,
I've had this farm down there,

151
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:10.611
special power of had conversations with a bunch of different people about this.

152
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.520
What every girl's like,
I don't want that kind of left too.
It was like,
well,

153
00:09:13.521 --> 00:09:16.560
you don't get that.
You don't get that kind of love.
That's not real.

154
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.670
There's still van buyers always get off the path.
Isn't that nuts?

155
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.830
Somebody told me this is to,
so it was like,
wait,

156
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:25.590
so that kid has been around someone who told me this,
that guy,

157
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:29.040
he's been around for 2000 years and he's in love with a 16 year old.
Exactly.

158
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:33.920
Those ummy.
Oh,
it was fucking pervert.

159
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.390
Shit.
Thousand year old dude hanging out with 17 year old girl.
That was me.

160
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:43.590
I know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's like ridiculous.
It's so stupid.

161
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.700
It's just stupid idea that he would still be in high school.

162
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.560
He's going to give up his power.
He's got to pretend he's in high school.

163
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.930
[inaudible]
high school.
Well,
you can pretend you're 18 you're out of school.
Yeah.

164
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:59.310
Pretend that you look like you're 25 you can pass it to the street.

165
00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:01.990
You got to show up at school every day like everybody else a little bit.
Greg,

166
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.700
your hair and go to a bar and hang out at night with regular people.

167
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.120
Regular things.
Shave your head stupid.
What?

168
00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.250
They get your references about the count.
Yeah.

169
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:14.850
You don't have to tell people you're 17 you look like you're 25 go.
Just go.

170
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.350
Go leave school.
You can graduate this year.
What nonsense is that?

171
00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:21.120
He's got to keep enrolling in school.

172
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.110
The truant officer are gonna kind of stop a vampire for running around.
Oh,

173
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:30.140
family van part that only eat deer in the fuck are you saying you got nice

174
00:10:30.361 --> 00:10:33.480
people?
Vampires at run around eating deers and those movies,

175
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.610
let me answer your question.
And those movies,

176
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.580
do they already know everything that's being taught in the school?
Yeah.

177
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:43.800
Learned those times though.
The white,
the Maytag guy sit there.

178
00:10:43.801 --> 00:10:47.010
That's like a some sort of a crazy like torture.
Yeah,

179
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:51.060
like Chinese water torture porn or on,
it's no big deal.

180
00:10:51.061 --> 00:10:53.730
But if water keeps tripping on you for a hundred hours,

181
00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:56.910
you might lose your fucking marble.
Like groundhog day.
Yeah.

182
00:10:56.911 --> 00:11:00.180
You might go crazy by the year.
Yeah.
What the fuck?

183
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:02.790
What are you transfer schools every,
every two years?

184
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.510
Fucking vampire that doesn't bite you.
What are you talking about?

185
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.470
I want my cake and eat it too.
I want that kind of love.

186
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.740
I want to be a stay at home mom and have a career.
This is why it sounds better.

187
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.360
That sounds like a crazy while you're not equals I want to fly and be a person.

188
00:11:18.361 --> 00:11:21.300
Well you better get a plane bitch cause you can't do that shit with your body

189
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.720
can't really fly and that's crazy.
How can you want that?

190
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:29.780
What do we want below job to release the release from the,

191
00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:32.730
the,
the,
the junkie of the penis.

192
00:11:32.731 --> 00:11:35.980
The penis that wants to explode squirty stuff out.
Yeah.

193
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:40.140
Those movies were Warner for all of us.
They ruin it for all of us.
What?

194
00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:44.220
Porn movies?
No,
not put the girl porn movies.
The other girl,
but they don't know.

195
00:11:44.221 --> 00:11:47.130
But they're like,
I sort of expect something better now.
Well No,

196
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
they're just responding to a lack of romance.
You know,

197
00:11:51.001 --> 00:11:54.220
there's a lot of people that don't find anybody who's really into them.
You know,

198
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.710
<v 2>it's fucking hard to find someone who just,
well,</v>

199
00:11:56.711 --> 00:12:01.090
you're exactly what they're looking for and they're exactly what you're looking

200
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:05.230
for.
Cause a lot of times it's just one,
one of one of those is there,

201
00:12:05.231 --> 00:12:08.770
like I said to the girl or the gores girls or the guy or you know,

202
00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.330
someone's annoying and whatever the fuck it is,

203
00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.720
it's exactly what anybody is looking for.
And what do you,
that's so not true,

204
00:12:13.721 --> 00:12:17.110
dude.
I know people,
it's rare as fuck thing.
Not even like,

205
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.080
I wish they put their socks away more.
I wish they were a little more,

206
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.810
that's a crazy person worrying about socks.

207
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.680
What are you doing to say crazy example?

208
00:12:26.681 --> 00:12:30.370
He gets to the bottom.
Mr Chef,
she has problem.

209
00:12:30.371 --> 00:12:34.990
He's British trying already to sabotage with clothing.
Nothing.

210
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.930
It has to do with behavior.
It's all closing now.

211
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.170
That sounds like the guy that Donald Duck,

212
00:12:41.171 --> 00:12:44.530
I remember the old cartoon with a Donald Duck like scientists when he was

213
00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:48.340
talking about the road rage that happens with you.
Remember that one and he goes,

214
00:12:48.341 --> 00:12:52.210
does the driver gets in the car and it just turned into this thing?
Yes.
Yeah.

215
00:12:52.211 --> 00:12:55.690
He's like a scientist duck.
A scientist stuck.
That's right.

216
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.750
You sounded just like that.
I haven't thought about that kind of,

217
00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.210
I can never do that voice again.
It's lost.
It's in.

218
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.980
Why you won't be able to reproduce it.

219
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:07.450
I can only do like a couple of voices like confidently and I have to be around

220
00:13:07.451 --> 00:13:09.120
them all the time.
Like Chilean only is,

221
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.760
I'm around Joey Diaz all the time so I can do Joey Diaz easy.

222
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.090
Other ones like that.
I had him for a while and then they're gone.
You know,

223
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:21.940
you know like Arnold Zz,
you could do Arno Dz.
It's Arnold.

224
00:13:21.941 --> 00:13:24.540
He's the only guy you can do with just noises.
You could usually,

225
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:28.220
you know,
it's so dumb,
but like

226
00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.030
I've never seen that not work on stage.
Yeah.
It's so dumb.
It's so dumb.

227
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:38.860
It's a noise,
but it's that guy.
Yeah.
Where's it?
I don't think that's the QC.

228
00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.670
I don't,
can't think of any.
Maybe Stallone.
I guess

229
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.890
this is more like,
there's like a little bit of an annoyance.
Yeah.

230
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:51.100
There's so many movies where he was yelling what you're like,

231
00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:54.550
what the fuck is he on?
Like that for and normal person be like,

232
00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:01.420
and he's like
the most bizarre.

233
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:06.040
Like did you see the remake of a,
of a,
where's the Kona spot here?
No,
not Conan.

234
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:10.010
Where's the sweet spot?
Do wherever you're fucking beautiful face makeup.

235
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:14.670
It's a sweet spot right there.
Total recall?
No,
just out of respect.
Yeah.

236
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.390
I already got Joey Diaz for seeing the new version of the mechanic.

237
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:24.510
Rarely led is almost stabbed me real a Spec for Charles Bronson dog.

238
00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.160
You go to that fucking piece of shit.

239
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.590
That fucking Jason stayed on that little pansy.

240
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.580
He's going to play Charles Bronson's character cock sucker went with,

241
00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:37.360
he went crazy.
That fucking movie.
It was very good.

242
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.970
I bet it was one of the coolest guys.

243
00:14:39.971 --> 00:14:43.420
I love state though and I loved that dude who,
I don't remember his name,

244
00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.540
but he was in,
um,
he was in that movie,

245
00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:51.970
the vampire movie about a Alaska Fan Perry movie.
Oh wait,

246
00:14:51.971 --> 00:14:54.200
it's all night long.
They might last six months,

247
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.620
30 days of light or something like that.
60 days at night,
90 days,
90 days.

248
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:02.810
120 days.
I don't know what the fuck it was.
The vampire or whatever,

249
00:15:02.811 --> 00:15:06.320
the fucking vet.
Somebody on Twitter was screaming at me.
I'm sure.

250
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.300
Ron,
how are you the one who gets to talk,

251
00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:15.760
Charles back as per toasty for six months,
but a,

252
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:20.420
he was a bad ass in that fucking movie that,
that Vamp,
30 days of night.

253
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.930
You got it.
The first guest,
that movie,

254
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.410
I got to find out this dude's name now because he,

255
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.400
he was so fucking good in that movie.

256
00:15:28.401 --> 00:15:33.401
It was chilling because it's such a stupid premise that you're an a vampires.

257
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.160
It's sort of cool.
Vampires would go with this more note,
but these were legit,

258
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.950
I'm sorry.
Hold on a second.
These are legit.
What vampires are legit fan part?

259
00:15:40.951 --> 00:15:42.200
This is one of the last movie,

260
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:47.600
30 days of night where they were fucking terrifying.
Legit vampires.

261
00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.420
They were awesome.
And why couldn't they find those people?

262
00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:53.390
Why can't they go to door to door?
Um,
kept,

263
00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:56.910
they didn't want to come early really into looking at hard.
I mean,
yeah,

264
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.680
they had a hideaway and go from place to place this news.

265
00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.790
How many Houston is homeboy's name?
That's one of them.
He,

266
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.500
this guy played the vampire.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Yeah.

267
00:16:06.501 --> 00:16:08.930
This guy was one of the guys in that movie that was awesome.

268
00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.790
But he wasn't the guy that I was thinking about.

269
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:14.480
There's a full cast and crew.

270
00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:17.990
There's a guy who played like the vampire familiar.
He paid,

271
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.450
played like the familiar scent.
Yeah.

272
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:24.420
The person that was hoping they were going to turn him into a vampire.
A,
yeah.

273
00:16:24.421 --> 00:16:27.140
Yeah.
That guy never works out for him.
Right.
Oh yeah,
it never works out.

274
00:16:27.141 --> 00:16:31.910
That guy always gets chat,
so he's kind of a piece of shit,

275
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:37.040
you know?
There's always something wrong with them,
but he ain't familiar.

276
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.360
But he's such a good weasel.
No,

277
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.180
and in this movie he had like rotten teeth and he was all fucked up looking.

278
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.930
Really?
Yeah,
it was awesome.
He was great.
They didn't allow him to have a,

279
00:16:47.931 --> 00:16:52.160
they always kill those guys.
Yeah,
they did it in the hunger games too.
Oh yeah.

280
00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:53.930
You got to kill those cow to kill him eventually.

281
00:16:53.931 --> 00:16:57.870
I don't let those guys fucking go on.
Ben Foster,
that's his name.
That guy.

282
00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:02.660
Yeah,
he's from Boston.
Holla at your boy.
He's a bad motherfucker.
That,

283
00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:07.130
that dude is a bad motherfucker.
He's keeping an eye on that dude.
As far as like,

284
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.150
like watching a guy that can really pull off someone fucked up in a movie.

285
00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:15.950
Holy Shit.
Is he good?
He sees the familiar,
the familiar.
He was so good in it.

286
00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:17.690
It was like this is silly role.

287
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:22.250
I mean you got to pretend then they couldn't change.
It seems so stupid.

288
00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:27.170
But he did it so creepy and so fucked up that he looked like a guy who had been

289
00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:30.770
so shell shocked before they put him in this prison.

290
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:34.520
He was so shell shocked because he had seen like just vampires,

291
00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:36.440
just gutting people.
Everywhere he went,

292
00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.230
they were going to turn him into a vampire in it and eventually they just

293
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.910
spoiler alert.
Eventually they fucking eat his face and it's pretty intense.

294
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:48.110
But you buy it.
He's his,
his raw acting.

295
00:17:48.111 --> 00:17:50.140
He's the of it all

296
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.220
<v 1>after.
Do they like slow?
They fuck you up man.</v>

297
00:17:53.221 --> 00:17:58.221
These are scary van or ways to do that fucking shit with the animals.

298
00:17:58.321 --> 00:18:00.630
Yeah,
like a wolf would eat your face.

299
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.480
You know wolf would and your face like a panther would eat your food.

300
00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:05.190
It's nice I'm into it.
But other vampire can,

301
00:18:05.191 --> 00:18:08.040
you could just drink a little their blood and you have to drink a little.

302
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.390
Supposedly they all make their own rules.
Now.
Vampires can go outside in the day.

303
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.360
Oh yeah,
blade started with that shit.
Remember that?

304
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:19.380
They put soil screen on that dude on black laid black blade.

305
00:18:19.381 --> 00:18:21.580
They put sunscreen and the other dude on the outside,

306
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:26.160
he could walk with what is the handsome fella doesn't work that much anymore.

307
00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:29.520
It was in that,
oh yeah.
Yeah.
He was in three girls.
Two girls.
A pizza place.

308
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.360
Two girls that go on a pizza place.
Was he in that one too?
Yeah.
Devastatingly.

309
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:38.020
Stephen Dorff.
Is that him?
Yeah.
Oh,
that guy.
That guy was out.
Handsome fellow.

310
00:18:38.021 --> 00:18:42.000
Stephen Dorff and he was one.
It's got a beautiful face,
but anyway,

311
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.780
all he had to do is put this sunscreen on and he was okay.

312
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:49.460
He was protected from the fucking the sun.
Rarely.
That's nonsense.

313
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.890
Vampires couldn't figure that out.
Come on,
man.
Vampires would go outside it.

314
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:58.500
Fucking authors in the spring lasts like 45 minutes.
Come on,
man,

315
00:18:58.501 --> 00:19:00.330
you're going to put some fucking sunscreen on.

316
00:19:00.331 --> 00:19:03.360
You're not going to burst into flames.
You're treating me like I'm an asshole.

317
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.750
Do you know that sunscreen companies just revolted against the America had to

318
00:19:06.751 --> 00:19:08.640
make him put widget stuff on their bottles.

319
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:13.790
Why were they doing just lying about second waterproof SPF was were were ranges

320
00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:18.960
sang.
It's waterproof.
It's paint by the way.
It's paint,
it's paint.

321
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:21.360
You're going to want your fucking head.
It's like,
no you're not.

322
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.400
It's not waterproof.
It,
it'll come off in the water.

323
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.400
Putting words like sport on there to make you think like,

324
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.300
oh I can just have this on for hours and you're like,

325
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.370
you're making people get skin cancer.

326
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:34.520
I developed some real problems with sensitive eyes because of sunscreen really.

327
00:19:34.891 --> 00:19:39.330
Cause I had to use sunscreen so much on fear factor when I did fear factors are

328
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.480
outside all the time.
When I first started doing it,
like I try like a retard.

329
00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:45.600
I didn't wear sunscreen like the first couple of days that I ever worked at.

330
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.480
I was just outside just getting cooked.
Um,

331
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:52.950
I got like really fucking burnt.
So I was like,
all right,
I got to wear sunscreen.

332
00:19:52.951 --> 00:19:56.790
So I was wearing sunscreen like three and four days a week.

333
00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.680
Standing outside while they shit drips in your eyes when whenever you get any

334
00:20:01.681 --> 00:20:06.150
kind of sweat and it's thing and you know,
a lot of times it's,
it's a sweaty day,

335
00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:06.471
you know,

336
00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:10.410
like it's really possible for sh little bit of a the chemical to get you know,

337
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:13.070
moisture and it just drips into the corners of your eyes.

338
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.090
Then it would sting like a motherfucker.

339
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.770
Sometimes I would go on stage at the store and I forgot that I had sunscreen on

340
00:20:19.771 --> 00:20:23.250
my forehead so I would sweat and then while I was on stage sweating,

341
00:20:23.251 --> 00:20:26.160
it would drip into my eyes and it would be horrific man.

342
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.230
It would be like my eyes are getting burned.

343
00:20:28.231 --> 00:20:31.080
Like I was getting chemical burns in my eyes and because of that,

344
00:20:31.081 --> 00:20:32.130
like I've had like problems,

345
00:20:32.131 --> 00:20:35.820
like swimming doesn't feel the same way in the ocean anymore.
It's like much,

346
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.940
yeah,
it's much more painful than it used to be.
Like swimming,

347
00:20:38.941 --> 00:20:42.090
swimming in the ocean.
It's like,
wow,
like this fucking stings.

348
00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:45.480
We're swimming in like freshwater.
It's like no problem at all.
And that to me,

349
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.280
the salt,
the fact that the salts things,
it's like male.

350
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.620
<v 2>It feels like maybe may have been some damage there.</v>

351
00:20:50.621 --> 00:20:53.020
So like also when you're swimming in and it comes up,

352
00:20:53.021 --> 00:20:55.140
then it runs into your face a lot more to your eyes.

353
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.500
What's just the fact that it gets in your eyes,
you know?

354
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.180
So what does it do he now,
what are your eyes like if they weren't staying?

355
00:21:00.181 --> 00:21:03.730
Are they staying?
If I get in the salt water,
which did morsel.
Yeah,

356
00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.880
more so than when I was younger.
Yeah.
I'm,

357
00:21:05.881 --> 00:21:09.010
I'm pretty sure it has something to do with being burned.
A few times it,

358
00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:13.900
it at least three times it was really painful or I got really burned,

359
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.590
like legitimately it hurt.
Oh yeah,
like on stage it's crying.

360
00:21:17.591 --> 00:21:21.900
I'm crying and you don't realize,
man,
that will sting.
Whoa,
I'm a pussy.
No,
no.

361
00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:23.970
The other way.
I mean,
you don't ever react to it.

362
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.660
I was like,
what's up bro?
I got so upset that pussy,
no,
your,

363
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.670
I would expect if you were in high school with me,

364
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:36.630
you would have in one of those kids that came in just hand over a flame.
No,

365
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:40.660
I don't want pain.
I just,
but I,
um,
I've,
I've,

366
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.860
I've been pretty good at shutting it out.
Like,
uh,
like getting tattooed.

367
00:21:44.861 --> 00:21:48.160
You have to shut it out.
It's not that hard,
man.
I almost fainted.

368
00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:52.450
Oh my God really didn't even an hour.
It just pinchy I was with Bella.

369
00:21:52.451 --> 00:21:57.340
Remember Bella Bella Giulia [inaudible] sure.
Yeah.
We went to get him and uh,

370
00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:58.720
she got one and I got one and it was like,

371
00:21:58.721 --> 00:22:03.400
you've got a way harder spot than I do gas.
No Way.
There's no sleeve.

372
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.230
Yeah.
I'm telling you that side area is brutal.

373
00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:09.190
It's just one of the most sensitive areas.

374
00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:11.500
I Dunno why it's supposed to be super sensitive,

375
00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:16.000
especially like the ribs apparently if you get the rep to the ribs because tone

376
00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:20.530
is right underneath the fuck are you feel like rattling your rib cage with pain

377
00:22:20.531 --> 00:22:25.450
just
really right over the bone and you're like,
oh,

378
00:22:25.451 --> 00:22:29.590
Jesus.
The top heard described.
There's a few spots.
When I was getting my uh,

379
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.860
left sleeve,
my rights leave is only like probably like 60% right now.

380
00:22:32.861 --> 00:22:36.480
I've got to go to Aaron del of a dove Ad Guru Tattoo in San Diego.

381
00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.510
Holla at your boy.
I want to finish this.
We saw she won my,
what's it called?

382
00:22:40.511 --> 00:22:45.010
My monk.
What?
It was it monkey.
I have a t shirt from them.
Oh,
that's right.

383
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.580
Funky gone.
That's what it does.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They have a lot of great artists.

384
00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.100
San Diego is such a fucking cool town.
That's,

385
00:22:51.101 --> 00:22:53.380
that's a good place to go and start a cult.

386
00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:56.860
Maybe we should start our colony in San Diego.
It's not too far from La.

387
00:22:56.861 --> 00:22:59.750
If you really had to be here for an hour later in the road.
Whoa.
Crank.

388
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.860
That might've been,
I'm full of Shit.
Fair.
Yeah.

389
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.300
That's a nice place to get laid in.
La Jolla.
Ooh.
Yeah.
How beautiful.

390
00:23:07.301 --> 00:23:11.940
As long as the coach me through the science,
it wasn't me.

391
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:14.860
You're an ignorant or something out there or something.

392
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:16.490
I think the anger was on or I don't,

393
00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:19.090
it was outside of the show was still going on.
Right.

394
00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:21.220
If some girl said something to me like,
Oh,
you were really funny,

395
00:23:21.221 --> 00:23:22.240
and then went outside to smoke,

396
00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:25.500
that's where I was still smoking and you're looking to go get her number.

397
00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:29.110
I was like,
no,
could I have?
You're like,
yes.
I was like,
really?
Yeah.

398
00:23:29.111 --> 00:23:32.440
You were on the hunt and that girl came up and totally made the first move.

399
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:33.570
I couldn't read it.
Yeah,

400
00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.580
and you went on stage and you talked about not having a girlfriend.

401
00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.980
You were like,
all green lights ahead.

402
00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:42.550
You know you were dirty as far as God dammit,

403
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.890
but you killed and that's what's important.

404
00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:49.490
Killed you are the fucking man for whatever it was.
20 minutes you were the man.

405
00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:52.800
She's like,
oh my God.
I'm just thinking about that.
You were like,
Oh,

406
00:23:52.801 --> 00:23:56.660
you guys are showcasing here for warmth.
Yeah,
and go out there.
Yeah,

407
00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.860
go get some sun.
I was so nervous too.
I was like,
okay,
I want to talk to him like,

408
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.673
she was like,
yeah,
sure.

409
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.640
Isn't it weird how you get like more comfortable like meeting New People.

410
00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.030
Is there any experience?
I used to get nervous when I would go to a bank teller.

411
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.040
This is by the way,
when you were what?

412
00:24:16.041 --> 00:24:20.120
Like 17 or 18 when I already fought in martial arts tournaments.

413
00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.190
I didn't,
I mean I got scared of that too,
but I would,
I would be,

414
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:27.650
I wouldn't be tongue tied and nervous when I was going to talk to the teller and

415
00:24:27.651 --> 00:24:32.130
a new person maybe that maybe a person of authority.
I just,

416
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:36.470
I just would get weird talking to people when I went for like long periods of

417
00:24:36.471 --> 00:24:39.750
time.
Just training and not talking to people too much.
I got,

418
00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:44.300
I got like real weird social anxiety shit really for awhile.
Yeah.
Yeah.

419
00:24:44.301 --> 00:24:47.090
I got real weird.
Imagine that now for sure.

420
00:24:47.091 --> 00:24:50.110
But if somebody like introduce you to somebody,
well I was very,
uh,

421
00:24:50.111 --> 00:24:53.820
I mean I was still pretty confident in myself,
you know,

422
00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:57.890
like unreasonably confident in myself because of my martial arts stuff.

423
00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.550
But I was still like really weird with people socially.
Like I would,

424
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:05.450
I would get nervous talking to them.
Anybody.
Yeah.
I mean,
look,

425
00:25:05.451 --> 00:25:09.560
I didn't grow up feeling like,
uh,
the most appreciated person.

426
00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.970
So a lot of times when I was a fourth round,
yeah.
So it was around someone new,

427
00:25:13.971 --> 00:25:16.510
I would like,
think they're going to judge me and Oh,
where,

428
00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.040
you know how long before this guy starts picking on me,
you know,

429
00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:20.240
how long before this person starts,

430
00:25:20.241 --> 00:25:23.180
how long before he finds out that I'm supposed to be cooking on a loser.
Yeah.

431
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.580
You know what I mean?
That's,
and when you feel like that,
you know,

432
00:25:25.581 --> 00:25:27.440
as a young person growing up,
it's like,

433
00:25:27.441 --> 00:25:30.650
it's super easy to have yourself fall into those situations.

434
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:35.420
So I would get like soup.
I could imagine it now.
Like now when I go to the bank,

435
00:25:35.421 --> 00:25:39.260
I look forward to saying hi to the lady and uh,
you know,
I look forward to going,

436
00:25:39.261 --> 00:25:43.270
hello,
how you doing?
Everything go,
what's up?
You know,
I think that there's like,

437
00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.110
like yesterday you got to get a little discussion with people.

438
00:25:45.111 --> 00:25:47.750
I learned that if you can do that,
you know,

439
00:25:47.751 --> 00:25:50.480
if you find someone who really will have a nice little quick little nice

440
00:25:50.481 --> 00:25:52.670
conversation,
you both feel good,

441
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.960
everybody feels good or you can just be that selfish,
senseless asshole.

442
00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:01.370
Just can I help you?
What do you need?
Write it down.
That's not it.

443
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.700
You're a robot,
you know,
just interact with people all day.
You know,

444
00:26:04.701 --> 00:26:09.380
maybe it would be fun if Joey Diaz worked at a fucking post office box place.

445
00:26:09.381 --> 00:26:11.330
You'd be,
it's fun places to call the post office people.

446
00:26:11.331 --> 00:26:14.000
They told me once how to do it like separate stuff and I do it every time.

447
00:26:14.001 --> 00:26:16.000
They'll stop and come over like,
oh you got this shit man.

448
00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.380
You got more used to Everett.
Thank you.
Dot Ireland.
You know,

449
00:26:18.381 --> 00:26:22.970
Eddie Bravo used to work at ups sort boxes.
Like,

450
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.520
like there would be like a,
uh,

451
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:28.400
like he would stand next to these runways and the boxes would come at him and he

452
00:26:28.401 --> 00:26:31.310
would grab the boxes and have to chuck them into like different places that

453
00:26:31.311 --> 00:26:33.380
correspond to different like Laverne and Shirley,

454
00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:35.360
like different area codes or zip codes rather.

455
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:40.130
Is it zip codes or note zip codes is the end of the letter.
Yeah.

456
00:26:40.131 --> 00:26:42.830
So you had to like put them into different places.
Like what'd you say?

457
00:26:42.831 --> 00:26:44.340
Like what show like Laverne and Shirley,

458
00:26:44.341 --> 00:26:46.620
they do that with the bottles where they had to like,
oh,
that's right.

459
00:26:46.621 --> 00:26:49.260
The end to do that with that pat would the brewery,
what was it called?

460
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:55.020
What was it?
No,
no,
it was a fake one,
right?
Shots.
Shots,
brewery.
Schlotzsky's.

461
00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.530
That's a real one.
Fuck isn't man.
I don't know.
I don't remember.

462
00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.590
That was a great show though when we were kids.
I think it's really,

463
00:27:01.591 --> 00:27:04.920
really hard to watch now,
but answer me this,

464
00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.570
what would show is that they're watching?

465
00:27:06.571 --> 00:27:10.530
There's so many good female comedians from that era,

466
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:14.850
like cow Burnett and Laverne and Shirley.

467
00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:19.910
They were like real legit shows that people wanted to watch Mary Tyler Moore.

468
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.960
I think it was maybe because of this I'm going to offer something that will

469
00:27:23.961 --> 00:27:27.540
probably get me in trouble.
Okay.
But,
um,
I think it's because in those days,

470
00:27:27.541 --> 00:27:31.440
Hollywood for the people in charge of choosing hadn't yet said we've got to find

471
00:27:31.441 --> 00:27:32.520
prettier people.

472
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:36.420
The management system hadn't come in and promoted people from within to get
like,

473
00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:38.700
well who do you have to choose from now?
A bunch of people,

474
00:27:38.701 --> 00:27:41.070
they've told us these are who you had to choose from and you don't get like the

475
00:27:41.071 --> 00:27:44.880
people who were just naturally talented to rise through the rice anymore.

476
00:27:44.881 --> 00:27:45.930
If you look at sign live now,

477
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:49.170
most of those people are better looking now than when it started.
You know,

478
00:27:49.171 --> 00:27:52.350
like everything has sort of changed and you're going to get prettier people to

479
00:27:52.351 --> 00:27:53.430
look at,
which is nice,

480
00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.820
but you're also not going to necessarily get the funniest or most talented,

481
00:27:56.821 --> 00:27:59.850
most creative person that way.
Right.
You know?

482
00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.870
And also Carol Burnett allowed everybody else to shine.
Yes.
Yes.

483
00:28:03.871 --> 00:28:07.080
And they had a super talented crew.
Is that thing falling apart on you,
man,

484
00:28:07.081 --> 00:28:09.570
you keep fucking with it.
Now I'm trying to get to the right spot.

485
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:12.890
Don't touch it and it just leave it alone.
Yeah.

486
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.120
Caribbean Nan had a super talented crew.

487
00:28:15.121 --> 00:28:18.330
It's just hard for us to recognize now because if you tried to watch the Carol

488
00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:21.600
Burnett show right now,
I don't know if you'd really truly enjoy it.

489
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.850
I think I should go watch some of those because some of those I can live in

490
00:28:23.851 --> 00:28:27.570
color.
You can't watch it all now.
Well,
like certain shows you cannot walk Bruce,

491
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.310
that Lenny Bruce [inaudible].
That's what you're looking at.
Yeah.

492
00:28:29.311 --> 00:28:32.490
I was hitting on a point to that,
that Lenny Bruce posts that I have on my wall.

493
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:36.120
I'm a look.
I give it up to Lenny Bruce.
I think we all have to.

494
00:28:36.121 --> 00:28:39.510
That was the originator.
That was the first guy.
If it wasn't for that guy,

495
00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.240
it would have taken lots of notes to tends to get to this.

496
00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:46.170
It would have taken him for what you and I do.
That guy is so super important.

497
00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.890
But if you tried to watch his stuff today,
it's,
it's,
it's odd.

498
00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.330
It's very strange.

499
00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:56.790
There's one where he's on stage for over an hour reading legal documents because

500
00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:01.620
the science should know just talking about the points of his case,

501
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.610
he went crazy because he was getting charged with obscenity and so he would go

502
00:29:05.611 --> 00:29:09.840
on stage and read his fucking case.
He was the first one to suffer from that,

503
00:29:09.841 --> 00:29:12.630
from thinking old famous.
He was,
he should be talking about.
Yeah.

504
00:29:12.631 --> 00:29:16.980
He fucking fell apart because of it.
Cause we're,
it was a whole world.
The,
the,

505
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.690
the court cases.
And then on top of that,
the heroin,
you know,
he,
uh,

506
00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.980
he was like severely depressed,
I'm sure because of a lot of it.
I mean,

507
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:28.440
all those guys that got arrested for saying things,
even a two live crew,

508
00:29:28.441 --> 00:29:30.800
we owe them.
We owe them because if it,

509
00:29:30.801 --> 00:29:34.080
if it wasn't for people who broke down the door with obscenity,

510
00:29:34.081 --> 00:29:37.280
even though I don't,
I mean,
put some,
uh,

511
00:29:37.281 --> 00:29:42.050
digging sigma as whole to me.
So it's,
I mean,
look,

512
00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:45.090
<v 1>I love it or hate it.
It's still,
it's a form of art.
Yeah.
But it's like,</v>

513
00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.870
it's this form of art.
It's like,
it's like,
why do you,

514
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:50.170
why do you choose to tell them not to say that?
Yeah.
That's what we believe in.

515
00:29:50.171 --> 00:29:53.020
That they should be allowed to Susan,
who cares what it is?
If they like it,

516
00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:56.840
what's it to you as the,
as long as they're not playing it in your face.
And,

517
00:29:56.841 --> 00:29:59.740
and I don't think she'd be playing Beethoven in everybody's face,
either.

518
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:04.060
The section we bowed out of the Christians a little too much,
a little too much,

519
00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.580
or like,
hey,
how about there's going to be some cursing on television.

520
00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:09.490
So just research what you're going to watch.
And police are kids on your own?

521
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.710
Well,
Florida is so gangster.
We all want this.
Florida's got a leg,

522
00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.930
a lot of really strange laws and uh,
some people like them,

523
00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:21.110
but some people think that they're,
they're really nuts.
And this,

524
00:30:21.111 --> 00:30:25.540
it was like four.
It has like a really large community of conservative people.

525
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.780
So they have some pretty strict laws when it comes to like pornography and

526
00:30:28.781 --> 00:30:32.620
things like that.
Oh really?
Yeah.
So when they have someone like say this guy,

527
00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:36.910
you remember that dude who went,
went to jail for obscenity,
Max Hardcore.

528
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.840
He does like really intense shit.
Like really intense,

529
00:30:40.841 --> 00:30:43.960
like shameful,
horrible things to people.

530
00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:48.790
She's like pissing in her asshole and then they drink it with a straw.
Yeah,

531
00:30:48.791 --> 00:30:52.630
like intense stuff.
Stuff.
Intense,
intense stuff.

532
00:30:52.631 --> 00:30:55.960
Pissing in your mouth and you,
while he's got a hard on somehow or another.

533
00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:59.410
And then he forces her head down and he pisses in her mouth some more and she's

534
00:30:59.411 --> 00:31:02.870
gagging and throwing up pissed.
Yeah.
So what they did with this guys,

535
00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:07.750
they decided to make a case out of him.
So they sent his stuff.
The Florida.

536
00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.770
Yeah.
And then they sent it to some place that has very strict pornography laws.

537
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:14.440
And so that place was like,
okay,

538
00:31:14.441 --> 00:31:16.980
well now we'll prosecute them based on our perception of what,

539
00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.960
what types of different perceptions.
Yeah.
That's where it gets crazy.

540
00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:22.090
And that's Florida who has like,
they didn't,

541
00:31:22.091 --> 00:31:25.060
they run the math where people just go from spot to spot to spot Florida.

542
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.080
It's not mad hot or whatever it was.
It's a oxycontin's.
You could,

543
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:32.050
it'll do you just get a certain amount of every single city.
Yeah.

544
00:31:32.051 --> 00:31:35.860
And they're trying to stop the A or slow the tide on the amount of prescriptions

545
00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:36.790
that they give out.

546
00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.820
But the fact is there's so many people that already have them.

547
00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:41.830
So many people that are addicted to that stuff.

548
00:31:41.831 --> 00:31:44.080
And if they all stopped cold Turkey,
they're all going to die.

549
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:47.590
So you've got to figure out how to get these people off this Zombie drug that

550
00:31:47.591 --> 00:31:51.690
you guys have been making billions off.
Good luck.
Good luck.
You fucking assholes.

551
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.110
You crazy assholes that laid all your money.
Enjoy your yacht.

552
00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:00.850
Even slave to population,
even slave to population with vampire dust.

553
00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:03.720
We've turned people into zombies.
You know what they'll say?
What did they say?
Oh,

554
00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:06.160
sorry.
Well,
um,
I just don't think about it.

555
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:09.040
They're going to stand right beside Mitt Romney.
He said,
we did build it.

556
00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:13.730
We did build it.
You know,
everybody got mad at me because a,

557
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:17.470
I got mad at Obama for that expression that he used where he said,

558
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.410
you didn't build that,
you know,
to,
uh,
you didn't,

559
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.100
you didn't build the infrastructure and was talking about that,
you know,

560
00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.000
the reason why we have,
you know,

561
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:30.760
such a great society that people are able to create jobs and start their own

562
00:32:30.761 --> 00:32:33.730
businesses is because there's this infrastructure and you need to contribute to

563
00:32:33.731 --> 00:32:36.250
that.
And you didn't,
you didn't build that.
You didn't,
you didn't,

564
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:37.420
you didn't build that infrastructure.

565
00:32:37.421 --> 00:32:40.010
And that Mitt Romney that have the businesses,

566
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.180
<v 2>he's saying that you didn't build it on your own.
Yeah.
But you know what?</v>

567
00:32:44.181 --> 00:32:45.710
I got upset about it.
Me and Brian Callen,

568
00:32:45.711 --> 00:32:49.850
we're talking about it and I should clarify because enough people tweeted me and

569
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:53.040
comment about your own screwed.
Yeah.
It's what I,

570
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:55.430
what I don't like about that is because that,

571
00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:00.050
that is a defeatist attitude.
You're telling someone something,

572
00:33:00.051 --> 00:33:01.750
they didn't do it.

573
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:07.210
That's not how a leader should be communicating with people in my really

574
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:12.490
unsubstantial and completely irrefutable,

575
00:33:12.491 --> 00:33:14.590
irrefutable position.
I mean,
to me

576
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:20.060
it's more what do you mean how a leader should act?
Those are,
those are,

577
00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:22.760
those are things in terms that we grew up on,

578
00:33:22.761 --> 00:33:25.910
but like what do you mean hang on his underwear and say whatever he wants.

579
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:31.060
I'm not saying that I don't start it any credibility on this subject,

580
00:33:31.101 --> 00:33:33.350
but I think that when you're talking to a group of people,

581
00:33:33.351 --> 00:33:34.300
this is just my opinion,

582
00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:38.840
can't say that any of you have more times and if you're the leader of 300

583
00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.760
million people and you're talking in negatives,

584
00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.850
then you are putting out negative,
putting out negative energy,

585
00:33:43.851 --> 00:33:45.430
your skulls and people.
You're,

586
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.440
you're in a sense you're saying that someone's wrong when you say you didn't

587
00:33:50.781 --> 00:33:53.700
build that it about Mitt Romney,
but no,
he said that about people,

588
00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:56.480
people that don't think that they should pay more in taxes.

589
00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:59.510
People that don't think they should contribute more,
which I,
by the way,

590
00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:00.363
and even though I'm,

591
00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:05.650
I have a mixture of ideas that I have about what is I about?

592
00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.590
I have a lot of things that I believe that a very liberal as far as like social

593
00:34:09.591 --> 00:34:11.840
issues and a lot of things that I believe that are pretty conservative and

594
00:34:11.841 --> 00:34:14.440
people would be kind of surprised because I just think there's a road,

595
00:34:14.441 --> 00:34:18.260
there's a reality to human nature that a lot of liberal people I think don't

596
00:34:18.261 --> 00:34:20.860
want to,
they don't want to accept they wanna.

597
00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:25.890
They wanna pretend that people are a little less predictable than they actually

598
00:34:26.001 --> 00:34:27.380
are.
Yeah.
You know,

599
00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:31.130
but the she wins are humans react like this,

600
00:34:31.131 --> 00:34:32.540
whatever type of spaces where you are.

601
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:37.070
Until we accept that all these conversations we have are just flavored by

602
00:34:37.071 --> 00:34:40.430
bullshit.
We,
that's why political conversations never work.

603
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:43.220
That's why political speeches never would never see those sides than ever.

604
00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:45.890
They've ever realize that you know when you want different things.

605
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:48.740
When you see a guy like Mitt Romney or a guy like Barack Obama,
who's,

606
00:34:48.741 --> 00:34:49.900
by the way a really good speaker.

607
00:34:49.901 --> 00:34:51.790
He's way better than I would be if I had to do that thing.

608
00:34:51.791 --> 00:34:55.340
I'd get crazy emotional.
I'd probably cry with a bitch cause this was a really,

609
00:34:55.341 --> 00:34:58.340
I had the real responsibility of guiding 300 million people.

610
00:34:58.341 --> 00:34:59.960
He's and he handles it admirably.

611
00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:04.340
I mean it's amazing but they all do it in a fake way.
They'll do it.

612
00:35:04.341 --> 00:35:05.540
What we are,

613
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.740
the type of country that prevails.

614
00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:13.550
We are not the type of country the backs down,

615
00:35:13.551 --> 00:35:18.410
you know it's like you,
you're not talking to me as a,

616
00:35:18.411 --> 00:35:19.870
as a human being and,

617
00:35:19.871 --> 00:35:24.871
and these grandiose ways of using tone and separating speech is to me it's a lot

618
00:35:27.801 --> 00:35:31.600
like standup halls for applause.
Yeah.
You can stand up jokes.

619
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:36.350
You hear them raise their voice at the top because of the message is cause the

620
00:35:36.351 --> 00:35:39.510
way you delivered it.
Yeah.
He,
he used some theatrical type shit.

621
00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:41.790
It's cheap comic doing that.
You're like,
come on,

622
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:45.120
I can't finish your set and go like this.
Go like,
give it up for me.

623
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.360
Some guys do though.
You've seen it.
How gross is that?

624
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.270
Remember there was a one guy that used to come around and would tell the

625
00:35:51.271 --> 00:35:55.390
audience that I,
this always gets a standing ovation.
This is my last bid.

626
00:35:55.391 --> 00:35:56.670
This always gets a standing ovation.

627
00:35:57.150 --> 00:36:00.660
And he would go on to this last bit and then they letting them know at the end

628
00:36:00.661 --> 00:36:03.950
of it he would tell people to stand the fuck up.
Stand the fuck up.
Standing

629
00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:12.670
people are so crazy.
They're show greedy.
They want it.

630
00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:15.690
It's mine.
It's mine.
It's my precious.

631
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:19.350
That's why the Gollum works so well cause everyone was like,
yeah,
I say that

632
00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:29.880
it's become almost a hacky reference in comedy because it works so well because

633
00:36:29.881 --> 00:36:33.690
it's,
it is like,
yeah,
that much desire for something that's the extreme,

634
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.270
the creepy as possible aspect of people.

635
00:36:36.271 --> 00:36:39.570
It's when you're running into them in the midst of an addiction,
green monster.

636
00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:43.020
When you see someone who wants something so bad,

637
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:49.530
you know that,
that,
that thing where I've seen it with coke,

638
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:52.020
I've seen it with people that uh,
that wanted coke.

639
00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:55.170
But they just want to get back to where they were in the first 20 minutes of

640
00:36:55.171 --> 00:36:59.110
their fucking coke trip.
Well,
they're not thinking.
They just know they want it.

641
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.100
They're just,
but it's,
it's weird to see that,

642
00:37:02.101 --> 00:37:06.810
that glassy eyed like locked down on that chemical.

643
00:37:06.811 --> 00:37:10.770
They want that chemical so bad.
I was with Tivo,
uh,
yesterday,

644
00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:13.890
two days ago yesterday and we saw it when it happened.
Man,
it's hot.

645
00:37:13.891 --> 00:37:17.040
Some guy crossing the street,
but he's walking with us sweatpants,

646
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:18.840
no t shirt and socks on,

647
00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:21.960
walking down the Bray up pat crossing Hollywood boulevard.

648
00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.180
And it was like on the other starts where I was like,
keep out.

649
00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.100
What truck is that?
I think meth,
meth.

650
00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:31.920
He to me Kinda mathy below the Mathy side,
Jesus Christ.

651
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:33.570
And I was like,
it seems calm.
He's like,
oh no,

652
00:37:33.571 --> 00:37:34.740
he's just waiting for to get in his word.

653
00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:39.150
That's why I have no respect for cops that decide by the way,

654
00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:40.710
are forced to act.

655
00:37:40.711 --> 00:37:45.480
But decide it's time to read medical marijuana dispensaries go cleaning up the

656
00:37:45.481 --> 00:37:48.700
meth labs.
Yeah.
Fuck.
You know where people are,

657
00:37:48.701 --> 00:37:52.740
what's worse going in and parking their car and paying for it with their credit

658
00:37:52.741 --> 00:37:55.830
card and what's happening.
Yeah.
What's worse?
You assholes,

659
00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:59.160
whoever it is at the top.
I know you're trying to protect your cops,

660
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:04.170
but really come on,
man.
You need to get drones.
And I usually don't say that,

661
00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:07.260
but that's the cops need to deal with the math hung.
Yeah.
Just drones.

662
00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:09.860
What's going to happen with the,
nothing's going to happen with the seat alone.

663
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:12.300
How about weed pays for drones to go after the math,

664
00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:15.420
but the city council stuff for la,
that's not going to pass,
right?
No.

665
00:38:15.421 --> 00:38:17.580
It's not going to pass.
No.
Mayor's never gonna sign off now.

666
00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:21.420
They can go fuck themselves.
The idea is ridiculous.
You all,
any they would lose,

667
00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:25.500
they would lose billions of dollars in revenue,
in taxes.
It's ridiculous.
Those,

668
00:38:25.501 --> 00:38:28.800
those companies are just as much of a legitimate business is someone telling Q

669
00:38:28.801 --> 00:38:31.650
comp?
But here's the problem though.
Yeah.
But I agree with you.

670
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.370
But six out of seven,
um,
uh,
city councilman or whatever said,
yeah,

671
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:38.860
let's get rid of it.
Yeah.
There's,
those guys are bitches.

672
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:43.070
Are they in the pocket of people?
Is that what it is of core?

673
00:38:43.071 --> 00:38:46.510
Is this is a big issue man.
If this could make,
look,

674
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.810
imagine you could wipe out just just for goof.

675
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:54.250
Say That you could wipe out all of the medical marijuana dispensaries in this,

676
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:55.143
in this state.

677
00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:59.620
So the only way a patient could get pot was too illegally grow it.

678
00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:01.990
If that was the case,
people,

679
00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:06.280
people at Grandma's and shit that they would illegally or they would just go to

680
00:39:06.281 --> 00:39:10.090
the pills.
It's very possible you get a lot of deals of pills.
Yeah.

681
00:39:10.091 --> 00:39:11.940
A lot of people take it for pain relief man.

682
00:39:11.941 --> 00:39:15.810
And a lot of people that have had like back injuries will tell you the craziest

683
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.700
shit.
The only story I heard where it's like a story,
evidence,

684
00:39:18.701 --> 00:39:20.140
whatever that word is.
But um,

685
00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:24.850
we were on that Moscow comedy tour that's Shitty wants AAA and all those guys

686
00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.410
and this guy we'll see.
He was like,
no,
he was like,
he's like a a,
an army guys.

687
00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.610
Like I'm not touching that stuff.
We've got a little annoyed.

688
00:39:30.611 --> 00:39:33.490
He smoked around him within two weeks.
He was like,
all right,
let me have some.

689
00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.850
But we always shoved him in the back with a lot with a login and stuff and his

690
00:39:36.851 --> 00:39:39.730
back was like,
fuck,
I'm hurt.
It hurt.
Whatever.
He said like,
dude,

691
00:39:39.731 --> 00:39:43.030
my back feels good.
Yeah,
well it starts smoking and he was like,
this is,

692
00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:46.420
I feel better.
What part of the problem with back pain,

693
00:39:46.421 --> 00:39:49.480
and this has been proven because it's stress related,

694
00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:54.360
that a lot of times when people have like really stressful.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

695
00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.520
Back centrally.
There's a guy,
I think he's,
his name is John Sarno,

696
00:39:57.521 --> 00:40:00.130
I think that's his name.
He's a,
he's a,

697
00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:02.850
I'm a doctor from New York and he's like,

698
00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:06.820
got this idea that I think his name is Sarano.
I should,
I should look this up,

699
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:11.770
but that it's psycho psychosomatic and Eddie Bravo actually found that his back

700
00:40:11.771 --> 00:40:14.650
problems or psychosomatic because like you say,
if he's stressed,

701
00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:18.460
he said that he was just so tense in the way he was thinking and he changed the

702
00:40:18.461 --> 00:40:20.710
way he was thinking.
And when he changed the way he's thinking,

703
00:40:20.711 --> 00:40:24.310
literally his back problems went away.
There's an old fable in the,
in the,

704
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:27.940
in the old testament that somebody,
some guy was trying to help a king.

705
00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:30.820
He couldn't get a shoe off or something and you're like,
armor on.

706
00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:34.690
If a shirt when he couldn't get it off and the king had to like calm him down or

707
00:40:34.691 --> 00:40:38.680
they're the Jew had a calmness kicking down.
And then once that happened,

708
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:42.580
then his swelling went down in his foot and he was able to get the shoe off.
Huh?

709
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.870
Yeah,
you fucked that funny thing.
I fucked it up.
Good man.
Fucked it up.
Good.

710
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:51.880
These,
it's not your fault.
These face you answer.
Oh,

711
00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:54.780
that's clearly the way to do it.
But now how,

712
00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:58.120
just missing an angel.
That's good,
right there is good.

713
00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:04.170
Can you tighten it up right there?
So,
uh,
that Jewish horror movie,
like I said,

714
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:08.020
it's a big box.
Yeah.
Well it's,
I think it's called the possession or so.
Yeah,

715
00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:12.250
that's,
I just came out.
Yeah,
it was wicked stupid.
Yeah,
totally.
Unbelievable.

716
00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.740
Completely retarded.
You like drag me to hell.
I was like this love,

717
00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:20.740
love that child.
And a lot of ways,

718
00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:24.440
I don't know if you've recognized that that time we were in San Jose and,

719
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:27.880
and we're all gonna go see a movie because it's so boring there and it's like

720
00:41:27.881 --> 00:41:30.590
two blocks.
It's okay.
Yup.
Yup.
That's it.
We're all going to the movie.

721
00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.680
And you wouldn't,
Tom was like,
let's,
cause he'd drag me to hell and I was like,

722
00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.130
barf.
Let's

723
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:37.900
<v 1>go see up.
And you guys are like,
bar.
I put all my,
can I drag me to hell?</v>

724
00:41:37.901 --> 00:41:41.210
It was so much better than me and Brian.
I'm like a 14 year old.

725
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:44.930
Me and Brian cried it up.
Balling.
Aw,

726
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.710
that's so sweet.
Yeah.
I don't like getting depressed at the movies and updated,

727
00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.100
depressed me when the old guy was in the house by himself.
I'm like,

728
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:54.350
I don't not want to watch this.
That's gross.

729
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.130
Watching someone right away that first 15 minutes into that you're like,

730
00:41:58.131 --> 00:42:02.430
that's just a beautiful short him with the wife are coming up and then it's

731
00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:06.050
depressing.
It's fuck.
Yeah,
so like with stuff touches me like that.

732
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:10.520
You don't like it.
I used to and I gave up.
I gave,

733
00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:13.230
I gave up on that feeling like I don't need that.
I'm,

734
00:42:13.231 --> 00:42:17.420
I'm trying to manage as much positive thinking in my life as possible.

735
00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:22.400
The last thing I want to do is watch a movie about some guy is fucking shooting

736
00:42:22.401 --> 00:42:27.110
heroin and falling apart and you know someone had accidentally hit someone with

737
00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:28.620
a car because they're dry.
I don't want to see that.

738
00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.370
I don't want to see it and I'm carrying,

739
00:42:31.371 --> 00:42:35.540
I know need to see reality when I go to the fucking movies.
I want the hulk.

740
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:40.570
Really?
I would see me.
Yeah,
I would see it's been back and forth.
What's that?

741
00:42:40.571 --> 00:42:43.960
Not even a back and forth.
A fuck about some depressing.
Yeah.

742
00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:46.910
I'm not going to the movies.
You get depressed.
I don't have time,
man.

743
00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.120
I'm thinking,
well,
I've got a lot of different interests,
you know,

744
00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:51.320
and I'm into like,

745
00:42:51.321 --> 00:42:54.350
I'm really into a lot of different things that I don't get to do a lot like play

746
00:42:54.351 --> 00:42:57.920
pool.
The last thing was do is take some time with them playing pool.

747
00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:02.920
You can feel to watch some movie or they want to make me cry like a bitch about

748
00:43:03.171 --> 00:43:07.130
some shit.
That didn't even really happen.
I'm crying about some fake shit.

749
00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:12.020
Suppose to,
you've got to Ali g movies and stuff like that for sure.
Yeah.
No,
no.

750
00:43:12.021 --> 00:43:14.340
I love comedies.
Don't get me wrong.
Yeah.

751
00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:18.110
I wanted to go see the new Will Ferrell Zach Galifianakis movie,

752
00:43:18.111 --> 00:43:21.140
but it was sold out like a motherfucker.
Really?
Yeah.

753
00:43:21.141 --> 00:43:24.920
We were 20 minutes before too.
I was like,
Oh shit.
I got crazy.

754
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:27.560
I thought I could go see that movie.
That movie is going to be like number one.

755
00:43:27.561 --> 00:43:30.830
Apparently it's fucking when the come out and various just came out,

756
00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:35.600
but I had a bunch of people say that when it went sides.
It's just so ridiculous.

757
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:39.350
It's like from the moment it starts,
he goes,
it's so fucking crazy.

758
00:43:39.351 --> 00:43:42.950
Giggle fest because they're both so stupid.
Funny.
Like will Ferrell.

759
00:43:42.951 --> 00:43:44.550
I've seen him in movies like the,

760
00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:48.260
he's got like scenes in anchorman that is so preposterous.

761
00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:52.630
But when the girl was starting to become famous and he was upset.
Yeah,

762
00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:56.960
I mean it's like he's so,
it's so ridiculous and it's like,
all right.
It's funny.

763
00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:00.650
Every movie that he's in it.
I've never seen a bad will Ferrell movie.

764
00:44:00.651 --> 00:44:02.780
I've never seen a will Ferrell movie.
They didn't make me laugh.

765
00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:06.040
Talladega nights is one of my all time favorite comedy.

766
00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:10.340
That's how black girl rape the welfare because he loses it and then starts

767
00:44:10.341 --> 00:44:14.810
talking Philip Seymour Hoffman or that whatever the guy's name is Leslie Bibb.

768
00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.930
Yeah,
you're fucking other guys.
Like those are my kids now.

769
00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:22.940
She was fighting with respect ex girlfriend in zookeeper.
Oh really?
Yeah,

770
00:44:22.941 --> 00:44:27.860
she was the girl that I was trying to get from Kevin James.
Yeah,

771
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.800
she's really nice.
She's super cool as far as like,

772
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.830
<v 2>you know,
you think about like hanging with actors that act as,</v>

773
00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.200
it'd be like real actory ish.

774
00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:40.320
Leslie Bibb is cool as fuck and she's totally like an old guy.

775
00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:45.090
Do we,
we were on the way to,
she's really funny and she's nice.

776
00:44:45.091 --> 00:44:49.170
She's nice to everybody.
She's nice to the PAS.
She's nice to the makeup lady.

777
00:44:49.171 --> 00:44:52.740
She's in this nice,
she's just nice,
but she's fucking really hilarious.

778
00:44:52.741 --> 00:44:56.820
I don't know how much she would ever want anybody to know of this conversation,

779
00:44:56.821 --> 00:44:59.120
so,
well,
I won't tell you any fault,

780
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:01.560
but she was cracking jokes about something and I was like,

781
00:45:01.561 --> 00:45:04.500
I can't believe this is the chick from Talladega nights.
Yeah.

782
00:45:04.501 --> 00:45:07.700
It was really funny.
She's really fun.
It's the burn money has been,

783
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:10.320
I've been get called another server about Sullivan and son a few times.

784
00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:13.860
Sullivan and son was that stupid show?
It's on TBS.
Oh yeah.

785
00:45:13.861 --> 00:45:18.840
TBS has like a lot of comedies now.
Right.
That's a recent thing,
right?

786
00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:23.660
Is that where it Louis?
No,
he's at Fx,
but his,
his antibiotic.

787
00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:25.870
But uh,
anyway,
I called it at some point,
you know,

788
00:45:25.871 --> 00:45:29.740
you to hold on three times for like one same show.
It's like,
thank you.

789
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:32.160
Callie said something about me.
Yeah.
And he was like,

790
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:36.120
I'd so much rather hang out with a comic than an actor.
Oh yeah.

791
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:39.750
Even if it's just one line,
just I'd rather be,
normally I say that,

792
00:45:39.751 --> 00:45:42.420
but then I'm like saying like this Leslie Bibb check.
Even though she's a,

793
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.220
she's not a comic,
she has a comic.

794
00:45:44.221 --> 00:45:46.320
She might as well be a calm and that's an annoying comics too.

795
00:45:46.321 --> 00:45:49.110
I wouldn't want to hang out with a course.
I'll tell it.
Look,

796
00:45:49.111 --> 00:45:50.760
a lot of people that are actors,

797
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:55.700
the in comedy like Leslie Bibb could easily have been a standout,
you know?

798
00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:00.180
Cool.
Yeah.
The same thing that,
you know,
Chelsea handler can pull off.

799
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:02.850
Leslie Bibb can pull that off to,
you know,
I mean,

800
00:46:02.851 --> 00:46:05.880
I think she's a hand and say some shit,
but I've always thought she was hardcore.

801
00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:07.440
She's funny.
It's not true.

802
00:46:07.441 --> 00:46:10.260
Is the only girl that was talking about being a whore that is really a whore.

803
00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:13.800
She was just like,
she ain't faking it.
She's always been nice to me.

804
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.020
I've always seen her.
She's always been nice to me.

805
00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:19.500
I've never heard anybody say she's an asshole.
You know,
I don't,
I don't,
you know,

806
00:46:19.501 --> 00:46:22.680
I don't know what it's like on her set or anything like that.
But she's,
she was,

807
00:46:22.681 --> 00:46:25.280
so,
she used to come into the store and like,

808
00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:27.670
like Jeff Scott used to get mad about it sometimes,

809
00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:30.970
but it was like a review for a book.
I wrote a blurb for that.
Yeah.

810
00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:32.640
But she would come and sit in their car,

811
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
drink from a flask that go in and open the show and then take off of the night.

812
00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:42.060
She was good.
I remember watching her and then the back of the room going,
wow,

813
00:46:42.061 --> 00:46:46.290
this chick is fucking,
she's hard core.
She's a liquid jet hardcore.

814
00:46:46.291 --> 00:46:48.630
Like she was really living it and she's really good.
I'm not,

815
00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:53.200
am I pretending I'm a whore for the sake of a joke?
She's funny.
She's so,
yeah.
I,

816
00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.990
I think,
you know,
it's a,

817
00:46:55.620 --> 00:47:00.430
it's a way harder road for a chick to make it as a comedian and even talking

818
00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:04.200
about anything than it is for a dude because the dude can get away with having

819
00:47:04.201 --> 00:47:07.360
an opinion about things,
you know,
checks it's harder to,
or they just don't try.

820
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:08.270
Yeah.
Um,

821
00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:12.150
well it's also like you'll listen to a guy on the stage with a conservative

822
00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:14.480
point of view for a little bit.
You know what I mean?

823
00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:17.150
You'll listen for a little bit if the guy is a respectable person.

824
00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:19.070
Even Christopher Hitchens was like pretty,

825
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:23.180
pretty conservative when it came to a lot of a lot of military issues.
Oh yeah.

826
00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:26.760
You know,
and these are obviously very liberal atheist at the same time,

827
00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.800
but if you had a woman that was on stage,

828
00:47:29.801 --> 00:47:32.720
so it was trying to get you to laugh and had opinion,

829
00:47:32.721 --> 00:47:36.550
so completely polar opposite of your opinions as well,

830
00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:37.900
you wouldn't be wanting to hear it.

831
00:47:37.901 --> 00:47:41.170
She couldn't be talking about psychedelics and it's hard.

832
00:47:41.171 --> 00:47:42.270
It's hard to do for them.

833
00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:44.950
But like political opinions are fucking social opinions.

834
00:47:44.951 --> 00:47:49.420
Shut your mouth woman I think
get to choose.

835
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:50.500
That's how guys think.

836
00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:55.000
And I think it's way harder for a check to have a political point of view on of

837
00:47:55.001 --> 00:47:56.680
them become like really like snappy,

838
00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:00.480
like a good dog yelled at too much in the act.
Yeah,

839
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:04.510
they definitely get pushed into big characters more.
It's a been character acts.

840
00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:07.030
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I agree with just like Roseanne did,

841
00:48:07.031 --> 00:48:09.190
just like Phyllis Diller did,
just like all these people did.

842
00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:11.900
It really hasn't stopped.
But Sam was a monster.
Yeah.

843
00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.690
You remember when I'm Roseanne first came out,
man,

844
00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.990
I remember she was the first sheet too annoying for me at first that I ever

845
00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:21.740
really kill.
It's really first chicken saw workout.
Really kill.

846
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:24.760
Oh No.
I don't think I ever saw her alive.

847
00:48:24.761 --> 00:48:28.780
I might've saw her once at the store live and I can't remember,

848
00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:30.540
but I've seen her specials,
you know,

849
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:34.660
senior specialist a bunch of times and I've tweeted back at her think she

850
00:48:34.661 --> 00:48:39.130
admonished me for making a potty joke.
Oh really?
Like a mommy.
Is it as a joke?

851
00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:40.203
I don't think so.

852
00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:43.340
I think she was telling me to concentrate more and important issues.
Oh really?

853
00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:48.340
She was one of the first women that get her say she goes,
well,
the my way,

854
00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:51.760
that's Roseanne Barr Bitch.
But I recognize you're fired every show on her.

855
00:48:51.761 --> 00:48:54.820
She had,
yeah.
Yeah.
You're all fired one at a time.

856
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:59.580
That's a weird thing that happens to people when they become like the star of

857
00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:03.120
the five show.
Yeah,
you can.
You can't tell.
Roseanne would not.

858
00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:06.880
After that second year,
it was like she was one of the biggest people in America.

859
00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:09.880
She was huge and when she had a three way marriage,

860
00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:13.480
her and Tom Arnold [inaudible],
Sandra Bernhardt or that other person.

861
00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:16.720
Is that true?
Something like there was like a three way marriage.
Wow.

862
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:21.040
They're like,
we're marrying her being married.
Maritain nother person.

863
00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:26.480
Oh Wow.
List.
Crazy drag.
How about we all get divorced,

864
00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:30.010
live together.
Let's just make up my mind.
I need this.
Marriage is a sham.

865
00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:32.830
We're bringing another person in here and this is get divorced and hang out

866
00:49:32.831 --> 00:49:37.100
together.
Can we do that three way marriage?
Why don't have a 10 way marriage?

867
00:49:37.101 --> 00:49:40.120
You'd dump.
Fuck that will when you break up,
you can't have any money.

868
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:43.030
How about that?
You don't get any of it.
All of it goes to other people.

869
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:47.920
They can't live off.
Let you make.
Yeah,
you can't.

870
00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:51.640
Could you imagine if you got divorced from nine people and you had to pay them

871
00:49:51.641 --> 00:49:54.370
all?
Me,
me,
me,
me,
me,
me,
me,
me,
me.

872
00:49:54.371 --> 00:49:57.500
Like when you go to Tijuana and those little chiclets kids come up to you and

873
00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:00.880
they'll be like that.
I got it.
The alimony all the time.
Yeah,

874
00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:03.730
I mean you've got to,
you've got to think of how stupid it is.

875
00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:05.910
Like I was having a conversation with somebody about a,

876
00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:09.820
the Oj Simpson case the other day it came up and what they were talking about,

877
00:50:09.821 --> 00:50:14.821
people like getting like super crazy because they have to pay so much in divorce

878
00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:16.600
and we broke it down.
I go,

879
00:50:16.601 --> 00:50:20.470
could you imagine if you had explained that to somebody that if they didn't

880
00:50:20.471 --> 00:50:22.060
understand the system,
he's like,
yeah,

881
00:50:22.061 --> 00:50:26.320
well what happens is you sign this paper and then when you're not together

882
00:50:26.321 --> 00:50:28.340
anymore,
even if they're fucking other people,

883
00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:31.250
you have to keep sending them money from a long time,

884
00:50:31.251 --> 00:50:33.710
for years and years and years and they,
for whatever reason,

885
00:50:33.711 --> 00:50:36.300
never have to get their shit together.
They never have to know.

886
00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:39.650
And everyone's like,
get you what you have to do.
You have to support them.

887
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:44.150
Why crazy?
You know,
I have a friend,
wait,
wait,
was hold on.
Ife,
whose wife?

888
00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:46.190
If she got married to the man that she loves,

889
00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:49.670
she would lose all of her money so she won't marry him.

890
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:54.050
So this guy's like a bum and they lived together and this guy has to pay them

891
00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:56.420
astronomical sums every month.

892
00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:00.500
And the hill like get a credit order or,
or a,
um,

893
00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:02.020
a court order to a,

894
00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:05.390
to prove that she's living with a man and the guy would just move out for two

895
00:51:05.391 --> 00:51:09.110
weeks.
The inspector comes and then he moves back in.
Here's the thing,

896
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:12.890
I understand that if you gave up your life and your career to raise a child for

897
00:51:12.891 --> 00:51:16.060
someone else,
oh no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
He has no kids.

898
00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:20.690
If you just marry someone in what world of equality do you think because you

899
00:51:20.691 --> 00:51:24.800
guys decide to break up,
that one person should pay the other person.
What?

900
00:51:24.801 --> 00:51:28.460
Equality World.
It's what if you get married for more than 12 years.

901
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:32.450
If then you're under five years in California.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

902
00:51:32.451 --> 00:51:37.010
That's what I'm saying.
If you're married for more than 12 years and you,
uh,

903
00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:40.580
you get divorced,
you grow apart a them,
you have to pay them forever

904
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:44.990
because you grew up in separate ways.
I mean,

905
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:49.100
that is one of the girl is not outraged by that.
It's a fucking cunt.

906
00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:52.010
Every one of you,
whenever you want to quality,

907
00:51:52.011 --> 00:51:54.380
just know that that's a rule set and go fuck yourself.

908
00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:57.360
There's no way that's just still be around.
I got to wear that for a second.

909
00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:01.580
I got two words to you right now.
Tom Arnold.
Yeah,
that's hard.

910
00:52:01.581 --> 00:52:04.510
That's our backyard.
That's right.

911
00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:07.390
Guys have run that hustle and Brittany Spears,
dude,

912
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:11.480
he's fat and he drives a Ferrari.
And every guy,

913
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:13.070
every guy who was excited about that,

914
00:52:13.071 --> 00:52:15.510
like black people were excited about Oj getting off.
Well,

915
00:52:15.511 --> 00:52:18.720
we knew this is ridiculous,
but finally one for us that you just went deep,

916
00:52:18.721 --> 00:52:22.850
but 10 son.
It's a ridiculous law.
It's ridiculous.
Yeah,
it's craziness.

917
00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:26.810
It's crazy that you could be separated by years and years and years.

918
00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:29.840
And even the same amount of time that you were actually together.

919
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:33.880
I'll give you a year or together for 12 years and separated for 12 years.
No,
no.

920
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:37.610
In perpetuity.
You kind of keep paying.
We got married where?

921
00:52:37.611 --> 00:52:41.360
18 now I'm 30 and cheat and have to pay forever.
Right?
A man,

922
00:52:41.361 --> 00:52:45.070
she can't find a man who loves her enough to take her away from us.

923
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:47.910
They're tarnished goods because they've already been married for the lawn.

924
00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:51.140
That who would want them?
Well,
it's not.
What the fuck is that?
It's not even that.

925
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:54.590
It's that like she can't trust him.
What?
I'm going to just trust you.

926
00:52:54.591 --> 00:52:57.590
I'm going to marry you and you're going to stick around.
If I lose you,

927
00:52:57.591 --> 00:52:59.330
I lose all this money.
I mean,
she gets a

928
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:04.470
substantial amount of money every year.
Hey,

929
00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:09.800
what the fuck are you talking about?
How much it costs?
How much does she get?

930
00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:14.770
Oh,
nothing.
Just about a million dollars here.

931
00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:16.370
Remember that Chris rock bit.

932
00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.590
It's okay to give him half of your money when you have $2 million.

933
00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:20.180
Try when you are 30,000 yeah.

934
00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:23.540
Can I get about 15,000 even when you have $2 million,

935
00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:25.760
it's like it hurts your soul idea,

936
00:53:25.761 --> 00:53:28.780
but it's so courageous.

937
00:53:28.781 --> 00:53:31.340
Easy that if you write something down on paper another,

938
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:33.660
you have to keep paying them.

939
00:53:33.661 --> 00:53:38.220
Like why can't you live your life like that seems to be kind of strange.

940
00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:40.560
You're requiring,
yeah.

941
00:53:40.561 --> 00:53:44.490
What kind of fucking weird enabling system do we have here?

942
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:46.710
You're not responsible for yourself.

943
00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.560
I'm not going to say they were changing to be adults.

944
00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:54.480
That's what we're trying to be.
I believe you said that.
He said,
I thought myself,

945
00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:57.390
I try to grow as a human.
I try to grow as a human,

946
00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:59.490
but that's what you're trying to be.

947
00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:03.090
Fucking people unable to take care of themselves in any way.
It's ridiculous.

948
00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:05.910
It's ridic.
Well,
the whole idea is we get injured in an accident.

949
00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:10.710
Women want to be protected when they're raising children and to be legal.

950
00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:14.820
Like some guys are douchebags and they don't want to pay for their kids and they

951
00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:18.480
wouldn't want to pay alimony or child support.
I'm not saying that.

952
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:21.300
I'm just saying in cases,
especially with there's no children.

953
00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:25.470
It seems a little weird that you can be separated from someone for,

954
00:54:25.471 --> 00:54:28.380
in my friend's case,
10 flop king.

955
00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:33.900
He's paying a substantial,
let me say it again.

956
00:54:33.901 --> 00:54:38.520
That's substantial amount of money.
My friend is a real,

957
00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:42.750
a real worker.
He works.
He just,
you know,
he's got his own business.
He's like,

958
00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:46.260
I mean this motherfucker puts in some hours.
Alright,
I'm telling too much.

959
00:54:46.261 --> 00:54:50.540
He's also a wizard who lives in a cave and he drives a spaceship.

960
00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.080
It's a fucking,

961
00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:57.080
it's just a sad world when you see people destroyed by weird in an unequal legal

962
00:54:57.661 --> 00:54:59.280
system quite what the fuck is.

963
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.400
That doesn't make any sense to fit that kind of behavior.

964
00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:07.140
It just so crazy to think that someone who you don't want in your life anymore,

965
00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:10.830
it's still your financial responsibilities about the last two years was a living

966
00:55:10.831 --> 00:55:15.150
hell.
Yeah.
That doesn't buy you anything.
Any discounts.
Yeah.
And this is,
you know,

967
00:55:15.151 --> 00:55:17.430
we're talking about grown adults.
I mean,

968
00:55:17.431 --> 00:55:21.000
you would assume that you've done something with your life that's trade worthy

969
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:23.670
haylage or the way the sleep next to each other for the last two years.

970
00:55:23.671 --> 00:55:27.180
It doesn't matter.
You weren't,
yeah,
no bed together.
You know,
you might fucking,

971
00:55:27.181 --> 00:55:28.680
she might insult you and you're at dinner.
I mean,

972
00:55:28.681 --> 00:55:31.290
make up your own horrifying scenario that it could have been.

973
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:34.110
And imagine you have to pay on a person a million a year.

974
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:38.720
It's craziness.
20 bucks.
That's what you got.

975
00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:40.290
What you were able to get out of prison.

976
00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:44.220
The whole idea behind paying people money is fucking crazy.

977
00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:47.010
But the whole idea behind charity is beautiful.

978
00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:51.660
And when people don't get charity from people,
they want to get it from them.

979
00:55:51.661 --> 00:55:52.830
You'll get it.
To me.

980
00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:57.900
And it's a fucking horrible aspect of human nature that people want something

981
00:55:57.930 --> 00:56:01.260
that they don't deserve,
but we all want it after we get it for a while.

982
00:56:01.261 --> 00:56:02.160
We all want it.
Yeah.

983
00:56:02.161 --> 00:56:06.140
You all want to slip and fall and sue after you get put in anything.

984
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:09.230
Even when you start getting spots at the comedy store.
Think now I get them.

985
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:12.120
I deserved them.
Yes.
Yeah.
You gets like this.
Yeah.

986
00:56:12.121 --> 00:56:15.270
It's hard to maintain humility and appreciation.

987
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:17.910
Those are two very hard aspects of the human,

988
00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:22.230
the human experience to really maintain.
And hang on to.
Yeah.

989
00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:25.420
It's hard to be a nice person.
I was talking to this guy in Toronto,

990
00:56:25.421 --> 00:56:28.360
this new comic he was doing me.
If it's off then something like web thing.

991
00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:33.040
Powerful Toronto coming soon.
Massey Hall and you're going to be able to,

992
00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:36.410
I'm also doing shows in Toronto,
but just for laughs to that,
that's,

993
00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:40.720
I would probably be by there to hang out at very least.
At the very least.

994
00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:44.350
So legally we can't say that.
Archerfield we'll be performing.
Yeah,

995
00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:48.490
but you know how the sales would that show?
Oh yeah.

996
00:56:48.491 --> 00:56:51.420
You're going to get all sold out.
Yeah.
It's almost sold out and they all,
we,

997
00:56:51.421 --> 00:56:52.720
you know it's,
it's,
look,

998
00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:56.320
Massey Hall is one of the fucking coolest places on earth.
Have you ever done it?

999
00:56:56.500 --> 00:57:00.370
No Dude.
Like the fucking Beatles did it and shit.
It's like one of those places.

1000
00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:02.590
Oh,
it's insanity.
I'm scared.
I'm scared.

1001
00:57:02.591 --> 00:57:05.570
Just thinking about it now I'm getting tuned up.
Yeah.

1002
00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:08.530
I'm so far enough for that show.
I'm fine enough for this weekend too.

1003
00:57:08.531 --> 00:57:11.980
I'm doing the Lobero theater in Santa Monica or Santa Barbara Rather.

1004
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:16.910
Santa Barbara is a pretty fucking Barbara.
You ever go there?
Uh,

1005
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:19.570
I just went camping near like halfway there too.
I'm telling you.

1006
00:57:19.571 --> 00:57:23.080
It's so nice to go camping.
You gotta do it.
Silly Bitch.
It's so much fun.

1007
00:57:23.081 --> 00:57:26.200
You see fucking animals?
We've got tagged by a skunk.
Yeah,
that's not good.

1008
00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.650
It was that like it's good.
It was sell fine.

1009
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:31.550
It's conscious or not good to only one.

1010
00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:35.860
I had to walk through it with camping.
That's serial killer bait.

1011
00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:38.920
Then you went out into the wild ass wild.

1012
00:57:38.921 --> 00:57:43.921
The wild that you can get to your car in La is not real wild trailer bait or do

1013
00:57:44.171 --> 00:57:47.680
you want to go?
Got to go to Montana sign.
I'm going to go somewhere legit.

1014
00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:51.550
That's too involved.
We want to take mushrooms and drive somewhere.
Hey,

1015
00:57:51.551 --> 00:57:53.800
but I'm telling you that you're just asking to get eaten.

1016
00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:56.740
That's what you can do it.
If you go into one of those creepy,

1017
00:57:56.890 --> 00:58:00.810
creepy semi wooded areas and this family's there.

1018
00:58:02.590 --> 00:58:05.260
Griffith Park is a good place to find it from afar cause he got flights to get a

1019
00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:07.760
blowjob.
Griffith Park is different.

1020
00:58:07.761 --> 00:58:10.420
It's a good place to find a pit that that's what may we all cook,

1021
00:58:10.421 --> 00:58:12.330
the homeless guy.
That's,

1022
00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:15.400
that's the kind of place where you find some shit like that.
You know?

1023
00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:18.820
It's not like the real woods.
It's not like Colorado.

1024
00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:21.880
I like walking through the trails in the Rockies.

1025
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:25.120
It's the closest place where I can get away from everyone.
Yeah,

1026
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:28.660
and that's so much fun sometimes to get away from everybody.

1027
00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:31.120
If I had a houseboat,
I'd take it out.
Sometimes Phuc yen is,

1028
00:58:31.121 --> 00:58:33.280
but the problem is the places you're going,
anybody you run into,

1029
00:58:33.281 --> 00:58:36.130
you're going to have to kill.
You have to kill it.
A hand to hand fight.

1030
00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:37.990
He's going to be trying to take your life,

1031
00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:41.530
get a call back on those holds school 10th planet.

1032
00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:44.380
When my dad taught me about the Israeli army.
Yeah.

1033
00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:47.350
What am I remember kicking the balls to do it?

1034
00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:48.880
I'm so bummed out that you hurt your knees.

1035
00:58:48.881 --> 00:58:51.850
I really loved the fact that you got into Jiu Jitsu and yesterday he got

1036
00:58:51.851 --> 00:58:52.870
proficient at it for a while.

1037
00:58:52.871 --> 00:58:56.920
I remember seeing you get a few taps and I was like,
Holy Shit.
Already happened.

1038
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:01.630
People,
anyone who's thinking of doing it,
it's so invigorating to get that.

1039
00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:05.530
It's like I could sort of the same but way better than what you come back again.

1040
00:59:05.550 --> 00:59:09.570
Well,
why don't you just lift a little weights for a couple of months,
build your,

1041
00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:13.390
your body after a little bit.
I uh,
I'm about to go back now.

1042
00:59:13.391 --> 00:59:17.140
I had a pretty significant back injury where I,
I popped it,

1043
00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:20.830
I miss it sometimes and I tried to,
I tried to keep rolling.
I tried to like,

1044
00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:25.190
like just rolled light and just use technique and I heard it really bad to the

1045
00:59:25.191 --> 00:59:30.040
point where I was getting numbness in my hands.
It was intense.
Yeah,

1046
00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.040
it was intense.

1047
00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:34.220
And then I came back for a little and I got my black belt and then I heard it

1048
00:59:34.221 --> 00:59:38.270
again and I was like,
mother fucker.
I said,
all right,
I can't just rest this.

1049
00:59:38.271 --> 00:59:39.650
I gotta make this thing stronger.

1050
00:59:39.651 --> 00:59:41.830
I should say that because I don't think I got interested in Jujitsu.

1051
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:43.740
I think I got injured from kettlebells.
Soil stayed.

1052
00:59:43.770 --> 00:59:48.140
Anyone doesn't be careful and don't go,
don't bend past a certain level.
Well,

1053
00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:49.101
honestly,

1054
00:59:49.101 --> 00:59:53.570
I think before you even do kettle bells for you because you had been kind of

1055
00:59:53.571 --> 00:59:54.290
sedentary,

1056
00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:57.970
I think it would've been nice a little bit and try and try and be a friend,

1057
00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:00.850
brother.
You know what?
I love it.
You were growing up.

1058
01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:06.200
You could have a started off with perhaps like some body weight squats and some

1059
01:00:06.201 --> 01:00:10.760
pushups and likely he'll conservative sort of a buildup phase because what

1060
01:00:10.761 --> 01:00:15.200
happened to you has happened to people before your break?

1061
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.330
Yeah,
you can.
You can fuck yourself up.

1062
01:00:17.331 --> 01:00:20.630
Kevin Pereira had the exact same problem and told me at some point he's like,

1063
01:00:20.631 --> 01:00:24.080
but honestly,
dude,
you're 36 or 37 it can't.
You can't.
That's,

1064
01:00:24.081 --> 01:00:25.440
that's what's going to happen.
That's calendar.

1065
01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:29.990
The guy that's right before he lifted his shirt and then pounded himself,

1066
01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:34.100
Fox News,
messenger of doom.
It comes to,
if you're,
if you're talking about great,

1067
01:00:34.101 --> 01:00:35.420
your body was,
he would have went that way with,

1068
01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:39.470
he just really loves being talent,
but now he is writing a lot of ways.
I mean,

1069
01:00:39.471 --> 01:00:41.600
when you're older for short,
that shit breaks more.

1070
01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:45.770
Especially if you think of the fact that you're 36 and I've topic being 36,

1071
01:00:45.771 --> 01:00:49.400
you're also like,
you know,
you haven't,
you,

1072
01:00:49.401 --> 01:00:52.460
you haven't been in the best of shape.
So you,
you were,

1073
01:00:52.461 --> 01:00:57.230
you got to that age and on top of it you were like,
like not eating well,

1074
01:00:57.610 --> 01:01:00.190
eating healthy.
I'm going to whole foods.
I want to.

1075
01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.990
Once high stoned drove in there,
I was like,

1076
01:01:02.991 --> 01:01:05.480
let me say it and our salad bar was so fucking good and full of different

1077
01:01:05.481 --> 01:01:06.950
flavors.
Then I'm like,
I can do this.

1078
01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:10.700
It truly makes a different eat healthy and people don't understand.
They don't,

1079
01:01:10.701 --> 01:01:13.430
you don't know what you're depriving yourself out of.
It doesn't mean,

1080
01:01:13.431 --> 01:01:16.970
it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean to be a vegetarian either.
It means,
um,

1081
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.760
it means getting a lot of nutrition.
I,
it's weird though.

1082
01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:22.340
I just did it because it tasted okay.
But after like a month,

1083
01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:26.720
like a solid month of doing it,
like all the time,
um,
like eight,

1084
01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:30.490
nine of those a day,
not a day a week.
Um,

1085
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:34.090
after that I could feel better.
Like I would feel like more in court.

1086
01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:38.510
More energy and like better.
Yeah,
of course.
It's like when you quit smoking too.

1087
01:01:38.511 --> 01:01:40.600
I'm sure it must've been the same sort of a thing.
Get to shine.

1088
01:01:40.601 --> 01:01:42.740
I would like to say that.
Relax.
No like to say that,

1089
01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:46.610
but it just had a real pull back.
Huh?
It's always pulled you a little bit back.

1090
01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.780
I'm,
I'm better off it now.

1091
01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:51.740
The Pot helps cause I get that feeling of smoking something which were relieved

1092
01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:53.780
that that little feeling so,

1093
01:01:53.781 --> 01:01:56.700
but for the longest time after that it always pulled you right.
Oh,

1094
01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.480
you're just always wanting to get on.
And then when you see,

1095
01:01:59.481 --> 01:02:02.000
let me see people smoking like I want,
I want to be part of this.

1096
01:02:02.001 --> 01:02:03.650
I want to be with you guys smoking right now.

1097
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:06.020
It's so weird how it's so different for different people.

1098
01:02:06.021 --> 01:02:09.740
Like some people quit smoking and then they feel like they have so much energy

1099
01:02:09.741 --> 01:02:12.710
and they feel so much better and they feel like they've got out from under a

1100
01:02:12.711 --> 01:02:13.071
rock.

1101
01:02:13.071 --> 01:02:15.560
Like something was weighing them down and then some people will quit and they

1102
01:02:15.561 --> 01:02:18.050
never quite get over that pole and just keep trying.

1103
01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:20.230
I had to accept like you don't have,
I said,

1104
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:22.770
hey though you're powerless over the drug.
Like every time I'm like,

1105
01:02:22.771 --> 01:02:25.500
I'll just have like one or two a day for a week.
It's like,
no,

1106
01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:30.060
I don't have power over this.
It'll be back in half a pack to a pack every day.

1107
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.650
Those Gary,
it's so scary that they made it that way.
Oh yeah.

1108
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:37.860
The addictive stuff isn't what isn't.
What gets you the good feeling.

1109
01:02:37.861 --> 01:02:41.670
He Mitt Romney.
Can we talk about this?
Hey Barack Obama,

1110
01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:44.670
can we talk about this poison that kills a half a million people a year here.

1111
01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:46.980
It kills like something nutty,

1112
01:02:46.981 --> 01:02:51.870
like 5 million worldwide die every year from cigarettes and like,
wow.

1113
01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:55.860
Could you imagine if you came out with some new shit like skin cream there was

1114
01:02:55.861 --> 01:03:00.270
killed,
killed five people were how long before they had pulled that shit off the

1115
01:03:00.271 --> 01:03:04.350
market?
That's a fucking plague.
That's a play to new aids.
It's,
well,

1116
01:03:04.351 --> 01:03:07.140
it's an old days.
It would be so many more people if we didn't have it though.

1117
01:03:07.530 --> 01:03:10.290
Thank God for cigarettes and hey,
it's thinking about cigarettes and aids.

1118
01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:13.840
It only helps us out getting the freeway still.

1119
01:03:13.850 --> 01:03:17.430
The four or five is jammed with all these people.
Drop it off.
I'm cigarettes.

1120
01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.970
There's something sad to me about an old lady smoking cigarettes and I know

1121
01:03:20.971 --> 01:03:22.410
that's stupid and hypocritical,

1122
01:03:22.650 --> 01:03:25.710
but I want to feel like an old lady should have someone in her life who loves

1123
01:03:25.711 --> 01:03:29.370
her enough to get it to quit smoking.
It's like you did it.
You did it.

1124
01:03:29.371 --> 01:03:32.640
You made it again.
Bays.
He got through.

1125
01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:35.790
It was like she survived the hunger games.
There's some women that have that,

1126
01:03:35.791 --> 01:03:39.730
that brassy.
They know you don't want to fuck them.
It's done,
so it's cold.

1127
01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:42.570
You're okay with it.
And so like there,
there are different thing.

1128
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:46.610
It's not like a woman.
They become like this really old thing and we can,
wow.

1129
01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:50.970
I'll tell you what,
when you were my age,
I've been undesirable for 28 years.

1130
01:03:50.971 --> 01:03:53.760
They get accustomed to it.
Yeah.
That must be so sad though,

1131
01:03:53.761 --> 01:03:56.850
for a check because really beautiful chicks are super powerful.

1132
01:03:57.330 --> 01:04:00.030
They have super powers.
You know,

1133
01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:04.260
they go into a room and everybody loves them despite their absolute,
they talk,

1134
01:04:04.261 --> 01:04:06.210
I said this on Twitter,
but I realized it recently.

1135
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.050
It's like the only difference in someone who would look at as a crazy person at

1136
01:04:09.051 --> 01:04:13.140
someone who looks at it as like cute or quirky.
His fuckability.
That's true.

1137
01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.080
That's the only difference.
Oh yeah,
for sure.
Yeah.

1138
01:04:16.081 --> 01:04:19.350
You look back and think about some of the girls that you dated and men too,

1139
01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:22.500
nutty flavor.
Flave what's the same behavior then that he has now,

1140
01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:27.030
but because he was younger and more vibrant.
Oh yeah.
They're like,
oh,
that's okay.

1141
01:04:27.031 --> 01:04:29.520
I guess just a little weird.
Yeah.
If you want to fuck them,

1142
01:04:29.521 --> 01:04:32.970
they become ways or are hanging out with when they can justify their behavior.

1143
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.250
Insane or or terrible.
Well,

1144
01:04:35.251 --> 01:04:38.160
don't you think like a certain point in your life when you meet a person,

1145
01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:42.510
they're just your sex dispenser part of it.
You masturbate with them.
Yeah.

1146
01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:44.600
You masturbate with them like you've,
there's,

1147
01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:46.740
there's people that you have legitimate relationships with.

1148
01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:50.640
There's some people that you just in never click with also sort of boat on any

1149
01:04:50.641 --> 01:04:51.474
level.
They're both.

1150
01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:54.930
So I apologize for girlfriends in my mind that had been like rude to wait staff

1151
01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:58.080
and I later I'm like,
oh,
she likes service done.
Right.
That's all.

1152
01:04:58.081 --> 01:05:02.100
But it's like in your head you'd like come on is an asshole and you're ignoring

1153
01:05:02.101 --> 01:05:06.840
it.
People get,
they grow up with that shit.
That's a problem.
We're so adaptable.

1154
01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:08.520
You know,
if you look at all the different,

1155
01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:11.480
to sort of like crazy cultures and what they can don't,

1156
01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:13.020
don't condone all over the world.

1157
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:17.930
And if you think about how similar human beings are genetically,
like all

1158
01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:20.020
<v 1>the,
where the variation is so small,</v>

1159
01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.180
but yet the behavior patterns are so radically different between like,
you know,

1160
01:05:25.181 --> 01:05:28.900
like what's going on right now in Bahrain,
what's going on right now?
You know,

1161
01:05:28.901 --> 01:05:32.020
and it was amped up hills.
Yeah.

1162
01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:34.360
I mean the same error on earth.

1163
01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:38.140
The apocalypse is going on in one place and another place,
you know,

1164
01:05:38.141 --> 01:05:42.490
you're walking down the street in Bel Air and as manicured lawns and everyone's

1165
01:05:42.491 --> 01:05:46.810
friendly and it smells great flowers everywhere or the chirping,

1166
01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:49.510
you getting your convertible,
you drive down to Starbucks,

1167
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:52.870
he sit there with your feet up on a chair,
every war.
Everything's so great.

1168
01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:58.180
I remember it was you,
me Diaz.
Um,
and I think,

1169
01:05:58.210 --> 01:05:59.950
I think doc,
it might've been with us too.

1170
01:05:59.951 --> 01:06:04.951
It was one of the days after nine 11 before the planes started flying again and

1171
01:06:05.921 --> 01:06:10.210
we were all sitting around like outside of a Starbucks or one of those coffee

1172
01:06:10.211 --> 01:06:11.200
beans or something like that.

1173
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:15.220
And we were sitting around just this talking about how beautiful it was.

1174
01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:18.190
Like how could they be a war right now we're,
we're,
we're,

1175
01:06:18.191 --> 01:06:21.460
we're going where we're sitting right here in southern California.

1176
01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:25.300
That's so far removed.
It was so beautiful.
There was no planes,

1177
01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:27.850
there was no planes flying around because it was nine 11.

1178
01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:32.440
So like you never got to hear anything fly overhead.
And it was like way quieter.

1179
01:06:32.441 --> 01:06:36.700
It was almost like we went back in time for a couple of days.
It was weird,
man.

1180
01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:40.280
You don't realize how often you hear fucking planes,
especially what you live.

1181
01:06:40.281 --> 01:06:42.770
You're anywhere near the airport.
Those fucking things here at all the time.

1182
01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:44.890
Gorgeous.
Yeah.

1183
01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:47.070
That's why whenever you shoot something and it's the sound guy has to be like

1184
01:06:47.071 --> 01:06:49.000
playing and you're like,
oh,
I didn't know all the time.

1185
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:52.240
I'm a wizard of catching that shit.
Sounds like I was going to ruin the shot.

1186
01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:54.880
Yeah.
I'll stop people from doing things on fear factor.
Like hold on,
hold on,

1187
01:06:54.881 --> 01:06:58.150
hold on.
We got playing.
We got to play you to play.
Um,
but yeah,

1188
01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:02.050
that we were sitting around and I remember we were thinking like how could that

1189
01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:03.360
be a war going on somewhere?

1190
01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:08.260
How could there be a place of such complete disarray that planes are flying into

1191
01:07:08.261 --> 01:07:12.250
buildings and thousands of people are dying when you and me and d as it just

1192
01:07:12.251 --> 01:07:15.580
sitting here high as fuck,
drinking coffee and just kicking back,

1193
01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:19.990
looking at the sun,
you know,
and it's perfect weather.
We're,

1194
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.320
we're too connected with the whole world.
Man,
you know,

1195
01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:25.210
sometimes it's like there should be just a village.
Like we're just here now.

1196
01:07:25.211 --> 01:07:27.400
We shouldn't worry about what's happening over there or a different planet or

1197
01:07:27.401 --> 01:07:29.230
different like whatever.
It's like it's not our star system.

1198
01:07:29.231 --> 01:07:30.064
We have to having a good time.

1199
01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:34.390
The problem is then other people form gangs and they take over just like that

1200
01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:38.560
mind movie.
It's almost like,
you know when people say this,
I'm like Americans,
uh,

1201
01:07:38.561 --> 01:07:40.400
those troops are fighting for our freedom.
Yeah,

1202
01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:43.570
they're not but not fighting for our freedom.
But they are.

1203
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:47.330
But they are because someone always throughout history,

1204
01:07:47.331 --> 01:07:49.810
he's become the baddest motherfuckers on the planet.
Someone,

1205
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:53.140
whether it was the Greeks or the Romans or the United States of America,

1206
01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:56.540
somebody had to dictate what the fuck happens.
The,

1207
01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:59.650
there's no one ever done it as well as the US has done it.

1208
01:07:59.710 --> 01:08:03.550
But we've always had to do it and the guy in charge.
And so the argument is,
look,

1209
01:08:03.551 --> 01:08:06.130
if anybody's going to do it,
it should be us.
Cause let me tell you something.

1210
01:08:06.131 --> 01:08:09.010
As far as the rest of the country.
The rest of the world goes.

1211
01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:12.940
We're about as nice as you can get as far as like how we treat our own.

1212
01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:16.340
This is about as nice as we can get,
know this kind of power,

1213
01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:19.850
<v 0>but then you think like we're the only ones you ever dropped the bomb or the</v>

1214
01:08:19.851 --> 01:08:22.160
only ones that ever did that.
We don't trust anybody else with it.

1215
01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:26.000
When the only only person that has a loss on that and we have to,
we're open to,

1216
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:29.940
what's fucked up is that we dropped two bombs.
We dropped the bomb.

1217
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:34.190
They were like,
I quit.
I quit.
I can hear.

1218
01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:38.630
It was like those hacking up comedy clubs.

1219
01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:42.980
Y'All ready for Ari Shaffir kid here.

1220
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:47.370
You here's my new jail.
Y'All good?
He foe.
We shift jokes.

1221
01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.760
I want you to think of this.
Okay,
I'll just do it now.
I don't care.

1222
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:50.551
I'm going to be like,
hey,

1223
01:08:50.551 --> 01:08:52.820
you guys like impressions and you don't have right claps.
I'm going to go.

1224
01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:54.920
No you don't.
No you don't.
Why don't you clap at that?

1225
01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:58.020
You know you don't want them.
You don't like them.
It's a good joke.

1226
01:08:58.021 --> 01:09:01.000
You're telling people what they like.
I love it.
Does it like some fresh air?

1227
01:09:01.050 --> 01:09:03.080
It's no big deal.
Everyone claps.
I'm like,
all right,

1228
01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:05.180
are you like different things?
And then the people,

1229
01:09:05.181 --> 01:09:06.290
there's a man named rich little,

1230
01:09:06.291 --> 01:09:10.370
he made his whole career at a making impressions in the pocket.
1830 Danny Gans,

1231
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:12.830
Danny Gans before he died of pills,
by the way.

1232
01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:15.290
No stress or having to do impressions all day long,

1233
01:09:15.291 --> 01:09:19.820
every day that ate away at his inside of pills,
whatever it was,

1234
01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:22.870
wasn't taking the pills for cause it was an awesome mood all the time.
Oh,

1235
01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.380
it likes it.
And like you said,

1236
01:09:24.381 --> 01:09:27.420
or you can get addicted to those terrible places to do a great bit about debt

1237
01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:32.330
against
[inaudible] in Vegas.

1238
01:09:32.331 --> 01:09:35.210
As soon as he steps on the bus to leave Vegas when it leaves city limits,

1239
01:09:35.211 --> 01:09:37.370
like den against taking the bus away from Vick,
Susan,

1240
01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:40.450
everybody goes back there and spits in his face.
Isn't that funny?

1241
01:09:40.451 --> 01:09:45.451
He'll gans do you have to be like people I have to qualify his success.

1242
01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:49.790
Well,
it's Vegas.
Yeah.
Well,
Rita Rudner too.

1243
01:09:49.791 --> 01:09:53.180
She was one that was kind of struggling a little bit on the road.
Like there's,

1244
01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:54.043
there was a bunch of,

1245
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:58.020
Margaret Smith was in that category of women is like really funny women standup

1246
01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:00.800
comics,
but at a certain point in time that you stopped hearing about them.

1247
01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:03.410
You know Margaret Smith was hilarious.
We went to Vegas.

1248
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:05.210
She was like in the Kinison era.
She didn't,

1249
01:10:05.211 --> 01:10:09.740
but Rudner was from her era and Rudner herbs carved out like a huge career for

1250
01:10:09.741 --> 01:10:13.130
herself in Vegas.
Every time I'm there I see posters and billboards and shit.

1251
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:17.030
She's always liked weird dealer act in Vegas.
Yeah.

1252
01:10:17.031 --> 01:10:20.070
What's also people going to look forward to seeing her again for something

1253
01:10:20.071 --> 01:10:24.050
that's like the comedy scene is shit in Vegas because there's so many great

1254
01:10:24.051 --> 01:10:27.800
shows at all times.
Why don't we go see a local guy?
We're sinking legends.

1255
01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:31.610
There's 10 legends playing at any point right here.
What am I going to see?
Yeah,

1256
01:10:31.611 --> 01:10:35.360
you can go see bill Cosby and if you're local to can get two for ones are comps.

1257
01:10:35.361 --> 01:10:38.480
Yeah.
You can see bill cosmetics and Joe Rogan.
You could sit back and Seinfeld,

1258
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:41.900
whoever you love.
I mean Damn you just put me in with Seinfeld and bill Cosby.

1259
01:10:41.901 --> 01:10:46.490
Holla.
Yeah,
that's right.
Your knuckles.
You can see a lot of good comedy,
man.

1260
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:48.290
We were so looking forward to doing that show.

1261
01:10:50.250 --> 01:10:52.340
I took off weeks for that.
So sad.

1262
01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:56.330
And we wound up in it and we wound up bringing it to the,
uh,
the ice house.

1263
01:10:56.660 --> 01:11:00.300
Can I make an announcement?
That was yeah.
Fucking image.
My CD is coming up

1264
01:11:03.730 --> 01:11:08.450

1275
01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:46.410

1278
01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:56.470
<v 2>Oh,

An evil juice spider.
Yeah.
Going after Hitler.</v>

1279
01:11:56.471 --> 01:12:00.090
Spy Das.
Beautiful Dude.
Um,
but yeah,
but if you've got to my website,

1280
01:12:00.091 --> 01:12:02.990
I'm giving away four tracks.
That might be one of my favorite CD covers a,

1281
01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:03.880
it's pretty sweet,
right?

1282
01:12:04.810 --> 01:12:09.630
I was really thinking if I was a just an a an a nine comedian,

1283
01:12:09.631 --> 01:12:13.140
like a kid who really was in a comedy,
like I was at one point in time,

1284
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:16.590
if I ever found this in the CD aisle,
like at the record store,
but like,

1285
01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:20.370
oh fuck yeah,
I can already,
she fears new shit,

1286
01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:24.660
revenge for the Holocaust.
I would buy that.
Just out of general principles.
Yeah.

1287
01:12:24.710 --> 01:12:28.050
If I knew that that was a standup comic,
I had an uncle that used to do that.

1288
01:12:28.051 --> 01:12:32.040
My uncle Vinny and he would,
uh,
he was from the era of records,

1289
01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:33.660
but he would take it to the record store and he goes,

1290
01:12:33.670 --> 01:12:35.730
I would just be the album mark.
Yeah.

1291
01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.520
He'll buy a record just based on its album art.

1292
01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:41.730
And I've done that before too and made horrendous mistakes,

1293
01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:46.880
especially when it comes to like fantasy or swords and shit.

1294
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:52.680
I like iron maiden.
I can get into some art schools,

1295
01:12:52.681 --> 01:12:54.540
the art to what they think is cool.

1296
01:12:54.541 --> 01:12:56.670
Is there artwork there are working same with grateful dead.

1297
01:12:56.671 --> 01:12:59.700
It's like the art work is way better than this leper iron.

1298
01:12:59.710 --> 01:13:03.580
Is that Monster Wright Edelman a bat out of hell.
Yeah,

1299
01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:07.280
they do that.
I've never seen this is what they do.
They have a few tours,

1300
01:13:07.281 --> 01:13:09.630
shirts for the year.
They will never be produced that art,

1301
01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:11.640
they're done selling that shirt forever.

1302
01:13:11.641 --> 01:13:15.060
After that they have it like a North American tour and it's done.

1303
01:13:15.210 --> 01:13:16.230
That doesn't make sense to me.

1304
01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:20.070
You're a new shirt and so now you have a 2010 shirts.

1305
01:13:20.071 --> 01:13:22.980
Someone else has the 2007 shirt.
You're all at fucking the same festival.

1306
01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:26.900
I get it.
But what if the 2007 shirt is awesome and I want to buy one,
you know,

1307
01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:29.010
and I want to be able to buy the old collectors items.

1308
01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:32.070
I feel like you should just keep selling them that too.

1309
01:13:32.071 --> 01:13:34.410
But I like something about like we were there and you had to be there to get,

1310
01:13:34.411 --> 01:13:37.050
you know,
and I don't like about it.
You artificially control the supply.

1311
01:13:37.051 --> 01:13:37.890
Like you decide.

1312
01:13:37.891 --> 01:13:42.180
There's only rule rural going to release 250 why if a thousand people bought

1313
01:13:42.181 --> 01:13:45.960
himself thousand,
he crazy.
Fuck White.
Creating a mad clan only get it live.

1314
01:13:45.970 --> 01:13:47.060
Like what about the people can say a little,

1315
01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:49.530
if a million people want to buy your crazy fucking hat,

1316
01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:53.070
you're only going to sell 10 hats.
This is a limited edition run of 10 hats.

1317
01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.193
All the hats.

1318
01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:56.080
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1319
01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.030
<v 2>Anyway,
I'm giving away four tracks for free.</v>

1320
01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:01.870
If you go to my website [inaudible] dot com or or you should have your.com just

1321
01:14:01.871 --> 01:14:05.080
go there.
I'm,
I'm honestly really happy with it and I think if you listen to it,

1322
01:14:05.081 --> 01:14:09.430
you'll be a fan.
So [inaudible] why are you pumping your own shit up like that?

1323
01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:11.980
I do like it.
I like it.
Let me do it.
Fuck it helped me out.

1324
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.520
<v 1>Right.
You should fear,
I've known ours you for your fraud a long fucking time.</v>

1325
01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:21.060
And I took Ari on the road of me when Ari was like in that stage of standup

1326
01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:22.083
comedy,

1327
01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:25.020
like you were like a couple of years and how many years in what you do and we

1328
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:28.790
five,
five years,
I was like,
you were there and not you.

1329
01:14:28.810 --> 01:14:30.620
You could have some great nights and you could say,

1330
01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:33.450
but I've watched you rookie mistakes.
Yeah,

1331
01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:37.180
but you made some fucking great moments to the rookie mistakes are fine.

1332
01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.220
It's the,
the,

1333
01:14:38.221 --> 01:14:42.140
the real problem is the lack of the great moments in with the rookie mistakes.

1334
01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:46.450
He would have like hilarious bits and then you would clump one in there.

1335
01:14:46.451 --> 01:14:50.140
But that's everybody.
Does that look like you just were trying to find like,

1336
01:14:50.170 --> 01:14:53.920
you know,
find the foot footer.
It'd be too out there or too little,

1337
01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:56.970
whatever it is.
We feel yourself pushing a bit too hard.

1338
01:14:57.010 --> 01:15:00.820
But I've watched you transform into like a real legit headliner.

1339
01:15:00.821 --> 01:15:05.350
It's been fucking cool,
especially over the last couple of years because of uh,

1340
01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:09.220
doing a lot of podcasts and you know,
do it a lot of internet related stuff.

1341
01:15:09.221 --> 01:15:13.120
You got,
you know,
especially the,
you got really famous for the,
the uh,

1342
01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:18.640
the racist stuff [inaudible] stuff and then you know from that to like,
you know,

1343
01:15:18.641 --> 01:15:20.720
senior stand up,
you know,
like,
and you know,

1344
01:15:20.890 --> 01:15:25.090
you put out no one ever came to see me from that though.
Yeah.
But here or there,

1345
01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.040
but it's all podcast stuff now,
right?

1346
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:29.740
It's all people coming to see you from the podcast and then remembering that

1347
01:15:29.741 --> 01:15:30.520
other stuff.

1348
01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:33.970
I also liked you when you did that stuff and it's people that have come to Vegas

1349
01:15:33.971 --> 01:15:36.760
when we performed the form before too,
that help.
That's the best one.

1350
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:40.270
You and I have done thousands of shows.

1351
01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:44.320
Have you stop and think about all the fucking shows that we did and all the

1352
01:15:44.321 --> 01:15:47.640
different places and all the different Friday nights where we did two shows and

1353
01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:49.270
Saturday nights where we did two shows.

1354
01:15:49.271 --> 01:15:52.700
Then we did a show on Sunday and sometimes we did Thursday too.
Yeah,
yeah.

1355
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:55.290
We did all last started at four day weeks.
Yeah,

1356
01:15:55.670 --> 01:15:57.900
I've watched it got too crazy.

1357
01:15:58.550 --> 01:16:01.540
That's like not a comfortable way to do the road.
When you're doing the road,

1358
01:16:01.541 --> 01:16:03.520
it's four to five days out at a time.
It's like,
yeah,

1359
01:16:03.521 --> 01:16:05.770
me fucking home this home for one day.

1360
01:16:06.130 --> 01:16:10.060
You kind of manage like the uncomfort with the the like what are you getting out

1361
01:16:10.061 --> 01:16:12.130
of it?
I've had to do that,
but then the problem is this.

1362
01:16:12.131 --> 01:16:14.480
It's like I told you I have like three weeks and I'll have like a week off.

1363
01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.430
Then have another three weeks.
I'm like,
I need that week off.
Right,

1364
01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:20.010
but the DC improv calls and you're like,
fuck,
I gotta go there.

1365
01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:23.080
The crazy thing is even the week off,
it's like,
why not go on stage?

1366
01:16:24.450 --> 01:16:25.840
At the comedy store and do it there.

1367
01:16:26.050 --> 01:16:29.710
We have the greatest job in the history of the world and it's not an easy job.

1368
01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:31.810
It's hard to figure out how to get really good at it.

1369
01:16:31.811 --> 01:16:33.460
But once you get good at it then it becomes easy.

1370
01:16:33.461 --> 01:16:36.610
And it's the most rewarding shit of all time.

1371
01:16:36.850 --> 01:16:38.500
We did the ice house this past weekend.

1372
01:16:38.501 --> 01:16:42.220
We did a two shows there and it was fucking sensational.

1373
01:16:42.490 --> 01:16:44.800
Fucking sensational.
Friday and Saturday.

1374
01:16:45.010 --> 01:16:48.190
Friday is always like a little weird because people are tired and we do a late

1375
01:16:48.191 --> 01:16:51.730
show is like a 10 30 show on Friday.
So it doesn't really start til 11.

1376
01:16:51.731 --> 01:16:54.460
And people have been like working all day and then they start drinking.

1377
01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:55.443
It's hard to like,

1378
01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:01.900
it's Saturday was off the fucking chain.
Saturday was amazing,

1379
01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:03.220
you know,
and uh,

1380
01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:07.840
Bob Fisher came on stage and brought up a bottle of champagne and you know,

1381
01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:10.160
it's so cool.
He's a,
that's a long way

1382
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:13.430
<v 0>from having to hide the fact that you were drinking on stage at the Tempe
Improv,</v>

1383
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:15.920
put it in a flask and say it's apple juice.

1384
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.470
And the most ridiculous showing him bring up stage to you.

1385
01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:19.470
Isn't that the Missouri

1386
01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:22.540
<v 1>[inaudible] Shit like literally of all time.
He's had some great shows.</v>

1387
01:17:22.541 --> 01:17:26.070
If I was some great times,
we,
we literally did that.
We,
we

1388
01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:28.660
<v 0>brought a flask on stage if it wouldn't let us drink.</v>

1389
01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:32.590
They said it was a state law or something,
a law because Christians on the place,

1390
01:17:32.591 --> 01:17:35.120
they beat up a lot.
It's so stupid.
And I,
and I had to say

1391
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:37.150
<v 1>the owner,
I said,
listen man,
I go,</v>

1392
01:17:37.151 --> 01:17:40.930
this place is filled with people that want to see us get crazy.
Okay.

1393
01:17:40.931 --> 01:17:45.110
We want to get crazy,
but it's true.
Let's,
I want to do a couple shots.
Yeah.

1394
01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:48.730
Like come on man.
I'm here to start a party.
I'm here to do a standup comedy show.

1395
01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:52.660
I like to have fun.
Let's have some fun.
I know what I'm doing.
Okay.
I'm not sure.

1396
01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:54.360
<v 0>Child,
they wouldn't serve it to the green room.</v>

1397
01:17:54.361 --> 01:17:59.361
And then Red van got a great idea and Rogan's and funded it because yeah.

1398
01:17:59.741 --> 01:18:04.140
Whiskey in a flask and I up on a bunch of bottles,
put in that back corner,

1399
01:18:04.170 --> 01:18:08.010
got fucked up and then we just kept saying,
can I have some more Coca Cola?
Yeah,

1400
01:18:08.011 --> 01:18:11.730
we just got pull lasted on Coca Cola.
They couldn't figure out what was going on.

1401
01:18:12.450 --> 01:18:14.970
Tipping the wage to have 100 bucks for Coca Cola,

1402
01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:19.770
but then the somebody ratted you out.
It was one of the waitresses was a,

1403
01:18:20.370 --> 01:18:21.600
she was a familiar,

1404
01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:29.730
oh my god,
there's alcohol on stage.

1405
01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:38.790
Remember what he said to me on the stage.
Remember when we got there?

1406
01:18:38.910 --> 01:18:41.190
Every tick we got there and we were in the parking lot,

1407
01:18:41.191 --> 01:18:43.530
joint disease already and so I guess he likes things done at you.
Yeah,

1408
01:18:43.531 --> 01:18:45.690
we're in the parking lot a couple minutes early.
We're like,
let's smoke a joint.

1409
01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:47.430
Yeah,
and we'll go in.
Yeah,
yeah.
Start.

1410
01:18:47.431 --> 01:18:50.160
The show will be in a couple minutes to fit.
The music wasn't even on,

1411
01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:52.980
I call it like damn to talk to you.
I was like,
what?
Why?
He goes to fuck.

1412
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:54.870
We had to delay the show for 30 minutes because of you.

1413
01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:58.230
People are standing in the rain and like,
what?
What is rain?
What's minutes?

1414
01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:00.630
What are you talking about?
He would just make shit up.

1415
01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:03.480
It was the first time ever talked back to a club owner.
He goes,
he goes,

1416
01:19:03.481 --> 01:19:04.770
well you're not going on this show.
And I'm like,

1417
01:19:04.850 --> 01:19:07.950
I have damn well going on this show.
This is your only reason I'm here.

1418
01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:12.030
I give a fuck about the money I'm going on this show.
You almost got that loud.

1419
01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:15.430
I didn't get that loud.
I said,
Dan,
I'm going on and then I got super worried or

1420
01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:18.800
<v 1>you've got like really hard but yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

1421
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:21.740
I'm going on and then you can't,
I go to,
you're going on stop it.

1422
01:19:21.741 --> 01:19:22.574
That helps a lot.

1423
01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:27.770
Well at a certain point in time what we would do the way we did when the

1424
01:19:27.771 --> 01:19:30.290
Improv's or like some of the most professionally run clubs in the country,

1425
01:19:30.291 --> 01:19:33.740
but at a certain point in time we would take over the room.
Me The other way.

1426
01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:36.560
Well we took over the room.
Well,
like a lot of clubs you go to,

1427
01:19:36.561 --> 01:19:38.150
like even when calen goes on the road,

1428
01:19:38.151 --> 01:19:40.910
Callen doesn't do it the same way we do it with Cowan does is he goes there and

1429
01:19:40.911 --> 01:19:45.020
they have an opening act in the Middle Act,
that day book and he just shows up.

1430
01:19:45.021 --> 01:19:47.530
He's the headliner.
That way he doesn't have to pay as much for,
you know,

1431
01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:49.810
those people's airfare and all the other shit that I paid for.

1432
01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:53.000
But for me I'm like,
what are you doing?
Like you can't,

1433
01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:56.890
you don't take over the room that way then then then you have to like deal with

1434
01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:57.680
on the show,

1435
01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:00.980
then you're just a part of an act and you're part of a comedy club experience

1436
01:20:00.981 --> 01:20:04.880
that's way more whole fucking night that way.
So we would,
we would do is say,

1437
01:20:04.881 --> 01:20:05.121
listen,

1438
01:20:05.121 --> 01:20:07.590
we're going to provide the opening ag where we're going to provide the Middle

1439
01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:12.450
Act and it's not up to them to say yes or no.
It's like I,
I've got a long,
long,

1440
01:20:12.451 --> 01:20:15.450
long reputation of bringing funny people on the road with me.

1441
01:20:15.451 --> 01:20:17.970
I always bring headliners on the road with me.

1442
01:20:17.971 --> 01:20:21.360
So you know it's going to be a top level act,
so don't worry about that.

1443
01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:24.390
And if it's a matter of whether or not,
you know,
you think my,
my,

1444
01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:26.880
my audience can't handle it.
Well that's not your,

1445
01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:29.790
it's not up to you to decide because you brought the melodic,
yeah,

1446
01:20:29.850 --> 01:20:34.350
I brought some people who you might be 20% of the audience 10% right.

1447
01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:36.690
So happy tried to get,

1448
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:39.450
he tried to get crazy but I was looking just now he can't get crazy.

1449
01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:42.450
We bought the room.
We essentially have a contract.

1450
01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:45.780
Like you can't just break the contract because you decide that a guy is late.

1451
01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:50.250
Like that's crazy.
He's really working for me.
I'm a private contract.
Yeah.
I'm a,

1452
01:20:50.251 --> 01:20:54.350
I'm a subcontractor to this contract.
We don't make me fucking smack you bitch.

1453
01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:56.490
Sit the fuck down.
Crazy asshole.

1454
01:20:56.580 --> 01:21:00.240
He was just a dude who liked to party and he would come to work the next day

1455
01:21:00.241 --> 01:21:04.290
with a headache and he gets fucking grumpy.
His shit when I'm,

1456
01:21:04.291 --> 01:21:06.120
when I made a dude like that,
honestly,
I mean,

1457
01:21:06.121 --> 01:21:09.540
I'd love Danny Maher and I'm not talking about him in particular because I

1458
01:21:09.541 --> 01:21:13.560
really never had a problem with that.
He,
me,
he and I never had a problem.

1459
01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:17.520
We know he was upset at me once because I came into town to do a theater.
Uh,

1460
01:21:17.521 --> 01:21:18.570
and I didn't do his club,

1461
01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:21.600
but the only reason why I did is because it's radio station promoted it.

1462
01:21:21.630 --> 01:21:26.070
Like to me it was like this radio station had played,
um,
my Voodoo Panini song.

1463
01:21:26.071 --> 01:21:29.450
It became like the number one song in Phoenix.
Only a Phoenix.
Yeah.

1464
01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:33.210
So they wanted me to come in and do a show for them.
I couldn't say no.
Nobody.

1465
01:21:33.211 --> 01:21:36.450
It was like 1999.
It's like,
no,
I couldn't say no.

1466
01:21:36.570 --> 01:21:39.920
It's like nobody ever offered to put me in a theater before.
Like,
Holy Shit,

1467
01:21:39.921 --> 01:21:42.540
it's radio station's going to take it.
You like to,
no offense to the other club.

1468
01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:46.350
Sorry.
It's not,
I'm not against you.
Yeah.
Like,
come on,
offer for something,
Dude.

1469
01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:48.660
You know,
recognize.
But,
but when I,

1470
01:21:48.690 --> 01:21:51.420
when I see a dude who gets like snippy and snappy like that,

1471
01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:55.470
I get sad because I know that that's just a person who's chemical system is just

1472
01:21:55.471 --> 01:21:58.550
completely out of fucking watch act.
He's just unhealthy.
How,

1473
01:21:58.630 --> 01:22:02.040
how the fuck could be,
there's no way that guy is healthy.
They're kind of a mess.

1474
01:22:02.130 --> 01:22:06.850
Yeah.
He's,
you know,
his whole system,
it was always tired and you know,

1475
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:09.390
when you see people and you know,
their shit's not flowing well,

1476
01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:13.260
you just really like,
you don't,
you see that now?
Like when you're eating healthy,

1477
01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.780
you see,
you feel how much different your body feels.

1478
01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:18.900
And of course we react the opposite way when you're at the opposite coming on

1479
01:22:18.901 --> 01:22:21.290
the road with you,
probably that,
ah,

1480
01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:23.760
the comedy store and maybe my upbringing were the,

1481
01:22:23.761 --> 01:22:27.480
probably the biggest influences on my,
on my stand up,
those three things.

1482
01:22:27.930 --> 01:22:31.140
Because seeing those big crowds and then being able to temper it with fucking

1483
01:22:31.141 --> 01:22:35.640
shitty eight person rooms at the store,
well,
something happened along the way,
uh,

1484
01:22:35.641 --> 01:22:40.641
within last few years where people started recognizing you and they knew to

1485
01:22:41.911 --> 01:22:45.790
expect you.
Whereas I used to bring you up and the real meatheads would

1486
01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:51.300
bring broken gap,

1487
01:22:51.630 --> 01:22:55.170
the real douchey dudes that I really got rid of almost all of them now,

1488
01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:58.620
but then a couple times just to hear a little,
a little by little,

1489
01:22:58.621 --> 01:23:01.170
a couple people like,
are you going to have tonight?
I was like,
yeah,
really.

1490
01:23:01.171 --> 01:23:03.810
You know me ahead of time.
Yeah,
and I would see it on the forums and shit.

1491
01:23:03.811 --> 01:23:07.390
I hope already comes with them.
Then somewhere along the line it'd be,

1492
01:23:07.391 --> 01:23:11.440
ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome our,
I should fear all excited for it.

1493
01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:16.330
Weird lately man,
the w the Diaz ones that I've been recording everywhere,

1494
01:23:16.331 --> 01:23:19.420
they're trying to top themselves because it's now it's become like some sort of

1495
01:23:19.421 --> 01:23:23.590
a crazy competition because in Denver they went fucking Berserk.

1496
01:23:23.650 --> 01:23:27.550
They went Berzerk Winnipeg in 2010 was the first time I saw that on a large

1497
01:23:27.551 --> 01:23:29.600
scale level because I don't know if you've ever played Winnipeg.

1498
01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:30.453
I never been back.

1499
01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:35.080
It was my favorite show of 2010 it was crazy blood man and that was the only

1500
01:23:35.081 --> 01:23:36.950
place I could do like that back then.
Like I said,

1501
01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:40.720
two or three level place and they went so crazy.
Well it's not,

1502
01:23:40.721 --> 01:23:43.060
but I could tell when I,
right when I walked on they like as you were saying,

1503
01:23:43.061 --> 01:23:45.340
introduction notes.
They were like they start clapping.

1504
01:23:45.670 --> 01:23:48.400
Yeah cause they know who it is.
I just say credits.
Yeah,

1505
01:23:48.401 --> 01:23:50.960
the I was whatever reason man.

1506
01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:55.520
My comedy took off and Co in Canada before it ever did in America.
Like I would,

1507
01:23:55.570 --> 01:23:57.580
I would do way better in theaters and Canada.

1508
01:23:57.581 --> 01:24:00.760
I remember we would do like Calgary,
we'd have to do two shows.

1509
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:04.030
Well I did two shows recently had two shows at that fucking Jack Singer concert

1510
01:24:04.031 --> 01:24:07.150
hall and we did a show where they sold out like an extra,

1511
01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:09.520
I don't know how many seats,
but they had to bring them on stage.

1512
01:24:09.521 --> 01:24:13.180
So we had people on the stage witness,
but it was like there was the,
we,

1513
01:24:13.181 --> 01:24:16.960
they gave us the option of that or those people get refunded and they have to go

1514
01:24:16.961 --> 01:24:17.800
home.
I was like,
fuck,

1515
01:24:18.690 --> 01:24:22.150
I'm just going to be a cool story because these people had like babysitters and

1516
01:24:22.151 --> 01:24:25.390
shit.
I mean,
who knows what kind of music out behind us,

1517
01:24:25.391 --> 01:24:28.240
but then they couldn't do,
they couldn't do that.
It was at least 80 people.
Oh,

1518
01:24:28.241 --> 01:24:30.370
it was a lot of people.
They are just humongous.
We didn't need it all.

1519
01:24:30.910 --> 01:24:31.840
We don't need it all.
They were like,

1520
01:24:31.841 --> 01:24:34.260
give something to them and it was became fodder,
you know,

1521
01:24:34.290 --> 01:24:35.630
it became kind of funny.
Then.
You know,

1522
01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:38.540
you're standing next to someone who's in a chair.
It was just watching you.

1523
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:41.310
Every time I've got a hump out,
you're in some old lady's face or like,

1524
01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:44.110
so sorry about this,
ma'am.
I've got to do this here.

1525
01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:47.230
You're looking at their drink on this delicious.
What is that?
That looks awesome.

1526
01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:51.300
[inaudible] halted.
Oh,
nice interruption yesterday.
Would you like that?

1527
01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:54.110
Not the interruption.
Doug loves movies and uh,

1528
01:24:54.130 --> 01:24:56.740
some guy in the front row was bringing out those purple,
the grape Twizzlers.

1529
01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:59.490
And I was like,
oh.
And he was like,
gave me the sign of like drama.

1530
01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:03.660
I like nodded and he throwing up to me.
It was awesome.
That's awesome.
Yeah,

1531
01:25:03.850 --> 01:25:06.350
it's was flung grape twizzler

1532
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:11.290
people a solid saw a piece of candy.
Yeah,
it's good.
Good invention.

1533
01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:12.490
It doesn't taste anything like grape.

1534
01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:16.540
We were talking about this the other day because I did the podcast that we have.

1535
01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:21.340
Uh,
we've accepted a fake grape taste for grape soda,
grape gum disease,

1536
01:25:21.341 --> 01:25:24.640
anything like a real great,
but when you eat it and go,
oh,
that's great.
Yeah.

1537
01:25:24.670 --> 01:25:28.480
Like you just,
you,
you accept it as being a fake grape,
you know,

1538
01:25:28.481 --> 01:25:33.250
like Cherry Soda Sherry,
unless you're getting some like legit Deli Cherry soda,

1539
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:37.300
Maris Shino Cherry Juice,
Cherry Cherries,

1540
01:25:38.110 --> 01:25:40.870
cherries.
So I was pretty fucking good though,
isn't it?
Cherry coke.

1541
01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:43.600
It's pretty rare.
And if you're really looking at a wreck,

1542
01:25:43.601 --> 01:25:47.110
your fucking immune system and you're eating like a pastrami sandwich with,

1543
01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:50.830
you know,
fucking thousand island dressing slot out the sides of it.

1544
01:25:50.831 --> 01:25:55.120
And you have a cherry coke.
Oh yeah.
Gimme gimme craziness.

1545
01:25:55.121 --> 01:25:57.010
I went and my sugar,
I love it too,
when they're like,

1546
01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:59.770
we don't have the Greenwich when we pour the juice in,
I was like,
yeah.
Oh,

1547
01:25:59.771 --> 01:26:04.100
are the juicy God.
He'd go that deep.
Yeah.
One time at a Denny's.

1548
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:06.790
<v 0>We're all eating there and I asked her for Terry like put the cherry juice and</v>

1549
01:26:06.791 --> 01:26:09.880
she didn't know and she poured the thing out but it was all the peanuts had like

1550
01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:14.360
leaked over in their Sunday area,
the peanuts floating in it.

1551
01:26:14.361 --> 01:26:16.430
And I was ahead of like what is peanuts doing in here?

1552
01:26:16.730 --> 01:26:20.090
And then I realized what it was that she just poured the whole Sunday area thing

1553
01:26:20.091 --> 01:26:23.690
over to get the cherry juice out.
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1554
01:26:23.691 --> 01:26:26.930
That's a little too much sugar free system son.
Now my system,
it's like

1555
01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:34.120
yeah it's so bad for you to drink that much sugar to eat that much sugar show.

1556
01:26:34.121 --> 01:26:36.770
And they like,
I keep reading shit about sugar,
how bad it is.

1557
01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.020
I've got to try to wean off it.
Why does it taste so God damn.

1558
01:26:39.021 --> 01:26:41.690
Cause when I haven't had it in a while cause I ate so much of it when I haven't

1559
01:26:41.691 --> 01:26:45.950
had in awhile I get low blood sugar cause I'm used to it now.
You know what dude?

1560
01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:49.370
You know what you can't fuck with Haagen daas chocolate ice cream ice cream.

1561
01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:50.233
It's delicious.

1562
01:26:50.410 --> 01:26:53.870
It's good if you want invest in a quality ice cream bar or chocolate bar.

1563
01:26:53.871 --> 01:26:56.870
Sometimes when you're like nothing,
let me just get Nestle's.
That's okay,

1564
01:26:56.871 --> 01:27:00.110
but let me go above and beyond.
You're like,
oh,
this is done better.

1565
01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:04.220
He would the hog and I wonder,
it's a dollar extra dark chocolate bar.

1566
01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:06.920
It's dark chocolate on the outside with chocolate on the inside.
Oh,

1567
01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:09.080
you ever go to a real hug and I was a place where they dip it in the chocolate.

1568
01:27:09.081 --> 01:27:13.340
Let it melt right on there for you.
Those are awesome.
Yeah,

1569
01:27:13.370 --> 01:27:14.660
and you don't know,
by the way,

1570
01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:18.050
none of you know what ice cream tastes like unless you smoke pot.

1571
01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:25.490
<v 4>Yes,
it is.
Sunday.
Tastes like pitch.</v>

1572
01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:28.460
You're living in a dream.
You are.

1573
01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:32.030
You're sucking a dick through a roll of toilet paper.

1574
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:35.470
You're not feeling it.
You're not feeling it.
You're not getting the,

1575
01:27:35.670 --> 01:27:37.340
the full experience.

1576
01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.430
<v 0>There is no better.</v>

1577
01:27:38.431 --> 01:27:41.000
Part of my depression then when I had was taking some medications,

1578
01:27:41.010 --> 01:27:42.480
let me have hyper phasia right.

1579
01:27:42.481 --> 01:27:45.060
Would never feel full and we're going to get stoned.
Oh my.

1580
01:27:45.061 --> 01:27:48.300
Not feel full and just for an hour,

1581
01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:53.280
just her up and cream.
Just more and more.
Did you hit the wall?

1582
01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:56.790
It was so.
I only had to tell myself you're done,
but what did you feel your like,

1583
01:27:56.850 --> 01:27:59.800
did you feel like exhausted from all the sugar?
No.

1584
01:28:00.690 --> 01:28:04.380
You would just get a little more weight down to don't eat for three.

1585
01:28:04.381 --> 01:28:07.590
I would eat til there's nothing left to eat.
Oh my God.
It was so good.

1586
01:28:07.591 --> 01:28:11.370
When you get high,
you can finish off anything.
Wow,
dude,

1587
01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:15.210
that seems like dangerous.
Oh yeah,
get so you can't get full to king.

1588
01:28:15.211 --> 01:28:18.990
Your stomach explode.
Can you eat too much?
They warn you.
I have to be like,
okay,

1589
01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:22.200
a plates of Spaghetti.
Probably.
That's enough.
Can you,
can it break?

1590
01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:25.350
I mean your stomach can break,
right?
Do those eater guys,

1591
01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:27.990
those probably Barf Barf.
You throw up.

1592
01:28:28.110 --> 01:28:29.760
I guess it's like drinking a gallon of milk.

1593
01:28:30.210 --> 01:28:32.550
You can't do it because your body would make you throw it up.
Is that true?

1594
01:28:32.670 --> 01:28:35.680
That's this rumor.
Really.
Well,
I guess there's not enough room.
Yeah.

1595
01:28:35.681 --> 01:28:39.170
And you would want to it,
but then imagine if you could drink down.
I'm,

1596
01:28:39.171 --> 01:28:42.020
they'll put your fucking stomach would look like.
It's really crazy.
Yeah.

1597
01:28:42.450 --> 01:28:45.490
I Bet Joey Diaz could drink a gallon of milk we had and me and David Kelly's

1598
01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:48.630
talks that we had mark hatch was going to come in and try to see if it is,

1599
01:28:48.650 --> 01:28:51.240
is a big guy.
I'd be willing to let him know he's not going to do it.

1600
01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:52.700
You don't think he could do it?
He doesn't want to be,

1601
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:55.380
he doesn't want you to human life.
He would not going to make fun of my,

1602
01:28:55.410 --> 01:28:58.140
he would do it.
Yeah,
but if he wanted to do it,

1603
01:28:58.170 --> 01:29:00.870
he could do and I think he couldn't.
You don't think you'd do it?
Nope.

1604
01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:02.070
So a physiological thing,

1605
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.903
<v 1>no one can do it.</v>

1606
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:05.320
It's like you can't eat a piece of white bread or two pieces of white bread.

1607
01:29:05.321 --> 01:29:08.400
If I'm looking at Tim Silvia,
like up giant dude.
I say,
no,

1608
01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:13.290
you don't think you could do,
I even say big Ben Big Ben Rothwell.
Yeah.
Really?

1609
01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:15.930
Yeah.
He couldn't drink it.
You're no Nelson.
Who's the guy with the boy?
Nelson.

1610
01:29:15.931 --> 01:29:18.590
Yeah.
You don't think he could do that?
Next time we see Roy Nelson,

1611
01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.130
let's try to ask him.
Well he'd be fighting.

1612
01:29:20.131 --> 01:29:23.670
I guess we can do it in the middle of that or later.
You can't say,

1613
01:29:23.671 --> 01:29:26.320
hey this is good fight.
Hey,
um,
can you picture to drown them out?

1614
01:29:27.550 --> 01:29:29.430
Just totally blow off the drive and I just,

1615
01:29:29.431 --> 01:29:33.630
you have an hour to the death against Shane carwash and either you're not

1616
01:29:33.631 --> 01:29:36.530
training anymore.
Can we interest you in filming you drinking if,
if,

1617
01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:39.540
if Nelson is out there,
please film that fight.
Listen man,

1618
01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:43.740
I have a podcast and a,
we were regularly number 40 on iTunes.

1619
01:29:44.970 --> 01:29:48.180
I'd be willing to actually put this on line.

1620
01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:51.240
If you would a drink a gallon of milk.
Do you think you can train your calendar?

1621
01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:57.840
I think you have to do it.
Film the whole thing and watch them start barfing wow.

1622
01:29:57.841 --> 01:29:58.950
Well I don't know man.

1623
01:29:58.951 --> 01:30:02.160
You and I should be the ones who talk about that actually because we were there

1624
01:30:02.161 --> 01:30:04.100
for the opie and Anthony.
Big Bird Challenge.

1625
01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:05.930
How much do you think that guy drank?

1626
01:30:05.931 --> 01:30:09.930
Cause he wasn't like the 70 shot double shot.
Just one double shot every,

1627
01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:12.730
every minute.
What's a double shot?
No,

1628
01:30:12.770 --> 01:30:15.510
what is the double shows like that I'm doing?
How many ounces?
I don't know.

1629
01:30:15.511 --> 01:30:16.740
We'd have to find out the exact amounts.

1630
01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:20.580
He drinks 70 something shots of eggnog and got over it.
Yeah,

1631
01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:24.090
I think that's a gallon dude.
Maybe seeing why do you think that?

1632
01:30:24.091 --> 01:30:29.091
Just because I don't count the Times to completely make it simple clue.

1633
01:30:31.410 --> 01:30:36.060
I would just think that if I bought a gallon of Eggnog and I poured 70 people

1634
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:38.280
drinks from it,
I would be shut out of it.

1635
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:42.900
I would be shocked at the economy of this gallon.
Yeah,
you're right.
Yeah,

1636
01:30:42.901 --> 01:30:47.370
he did it.
He did it.
He drank more than a gallon because half a path of Menarche.

1637
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:48.360
Pat From Inaki.

1638
01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:52.680
Cause if you've watched the video of pat from Munafiki hurling and I'm not going

1639
01:30:52.681 --> 01:30:56.610
to play anything for you,
but you were there live with me.
I was their life.

1640
01:30:56.670 --> 01:30:58.890
We were there in those two her.
So it was Norton.

1641
01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:01.980
So as opie and Anthony was red band there to reverend was not there.

1642
01:31:01.981 --> 01:31:05.100
He was not there.
Holy Shit.
Was it crazy?
Oh my goodness.

1643
01:31:05.110 --> 01:31:08.430
The smell and Iraq was there.
They had a kid named Pat Duffy,

1644
01:31:08.490 --> 01:31:09.900
and this is what happened to folks.
They had a,

1645
01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:14.290
they had this nutty eggnog drinking contest and pat from Menarche,

1646
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:17.940
who is a giant of a man,
he's an enormous,
and he was their claws,

1647
01:31:17.941 --> 01:31:20.430
but another giant of a man.
Huge,
enormous guy.

1648
01:31:20.431 --> 01:31:23.150
This a PAF would knock and he's the,
the current champs I,

1649
01:31:23.151 --> 01:31:27.730
he is keeping his fucking crown.
Okay.
By the way,
he's diabetic last two

1650
01:31:28.110 --> 01:31:29.130
<v 5>immediately.</v>

1651
01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:38.670
<v 1>Oh,
he's so crazy by the way,
is by the way.
That's why,
okay.</v>

1652
01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:43.230
Anthony is the most awesome Mr Radio show in the history of radio mean.

1653
01:31:43.330 --> 01:31:46.470
That's just who the fuck else would do that.
Maybe we'll stern would do that too.

1654
01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:51.120
So anyway,
they have this fucking guy,
Pat Boone knocky who was,
you know,
he,

1655
01:31:51.121 --> 01:31:53.400
he can only keep it in a system for a certain amount of time.
He's got,

1656
01:31:53.401 --> 01:31:56.060
otherwise he has to get rid of it.
He's got to die.
Well,

1657
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:59.820
he's got to get rid of it cause he could die like literally from sugar himself.

1658
01:32:00.770 --> 01:32:03.150
Yeah.
He has to give himself a shot of insulin.
So this is,

1659
01:32:03.151 --> 01:32:07.590
I mean a massive amount of shit plant still winning.
He's still,

1660
01:32:07.591 --> 01:32:11.660
I'm in warrior so he um,
he says I'm going to,

1661
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:13.540
I'm going to blow soon,
I'm going to blow soon.

1662
01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:18.310
And then somehow or another I get this crazy idea where I say,

1663
01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:24.060
how about somebody leans over the garbage can and opens their mouth and he

1664
01:32:24.461 --> 01:32:27.670
throws up in your mouth directly into your mouth.
And I'm thinking,

1665
01:32:27.671 --> 01:32:31.270
there's no way anybody,
I'm saying something ridiculous.

1666
01:32:31.271 --> 01:32:34.570
I'm saying something like when like when red bands on the podcast and he says,

1667
01:32:34.571 --> 01:32:37.430
why don't you just eat your own poop?
He doesn't really mean he shouldn't.

1668
01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:40.120
Trying to say something completely ridiculous for funny.
Okay.

1669
01:32:40.121 --> 01:32:43.220
That's what I was trying to do.
Yeah.
I was thinking just for a joke.
Huh?

1670
01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:46.300
Why don't I say you say something as a joke,

1671
01:32:46.301 --> 01:32:51.100
but they take a completely cereal.
This Pat Duffy motherfucker said,
I'm game.

1672
01:32:51.130 --> 01:32:53.500
This guy would do anything that would silence the room.

1673
01:32:53.530 --> 01:32:55.000
He would catch a bullet with his deck.

1674
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:58.570
This dude's memorandum on him saying I game.
It was like a to be like what?

1675
01:32:58.571 --> 01:33:00.180
And then someone said someone's,

1676
01:33:00.230 --> 01:33:03.190
I don't remember if they said why it was happening.
Who named it?
The baby else.

1677
01:33:03.290 --> 01:33:06.190
It might've been,
it might've been if any brands but might've been Vinnie brand.

1678
01:33:06.230 --> 01:33:07.480
It was somebody else was there,

1679
01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:11.410
some other person was there and [inaudible] was there and I'm Burke came in just

1680
01:33:11.411 --> 01:33:13.510
cause he,
he,
he wanted the year before and he said,

1681
01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:15.310
I want to be a part of that one this year.

1682
01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:20.050
Those guys are so like no one will understand if you've ever done like a radio

1683
01:33:20.051 --> 01:33:23.410
show that's been like rigid and stiff and the people are nuts.

1684
01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:27.640
You'll never understand the ONA.
I of them,
I bought a baby bird tree shirt.

1685
01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:31.840
He said fucking only shirts online.
Here's another thing that happened on ONA.

1686
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:36.010
We convinced Stalker Patty,
who's this crazy lady who comes to the studio.

1687
01:33:36.011 --> 01:33:38.530
It was like a 49 year old virgin and she's really nuts too.

1688
01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:43.570
We convinced her that she was on drugs.
We took a,
you're going to take a leak.

1689
01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:46.240
We don't,
we convinced her that,
um,

1690
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:50.660
she had taken a drug that we had put a drug and,
no thanks man.
I'm good.

1691
01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:55.360
And completely psychosomatic started having massive hallucinations.

1692
01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:58.300
So Ari pulls his ball,

1693
01:33:58.301 --> 01:34:02.030
sack out your cock and balls or just your balls a cock cock and balls.

1694
01:34:02.270 --> 01:34:06.290
It could be.
And,
and she was sitting there like,
like we,
we,

1695
01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:09.730
we had a completely convinced with like sound effects and shit that she was just

1696
01:34:09.731 --> 01:34:10.650
tripping or balls,

1697
01:34:11.410 --> 01:34:15.190
put a rabbit Sudan on and run around the room once and then run out.

1698
01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:19.660
Who was that?
I don't remember,
but it was,
that was either Roland or Iraq.

1699
01:34:19.661 --> 01:34:23.110
I was one of those [inaudible] you rock.
It was good fun with a crazy person,

1700
01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:24.850
but what you did to take it to the next level,

1701
01:34:24.851 --> 01:34:26.170
so you pulled your cock and balls out,

1702
01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:29.380
which you probably can never do now because you did this before.
They,
uh,

1703
01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:34.420
got kicked off the air for that Condoleezza Rice thing
for them now.

1704
01:34:34.450 --> 01:34:34.660
Yeah.

1705
01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:38.200
That homeless guy said a lot of crazy shit like you wanted to rape Condoleeza

1706
01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:41.260
Rice and like you guys didn't even say that.
What did he say?

1707
01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:45.130
He said he wants to love her hard.
He wants to love her until she loves it.

1708
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:49.270
Oh really?
Oh well that's in your window for rape.
Possibly.

1709
01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:54.340
I hear girls like that.
They like it if they love it.
I hear it too.

1710
01:34:54.341 --> 01:34:58.510
When they say I love when your heart like that,
but that's not um,

1711
01:34:58.550 --> 01:35:02.090
that's not rape.
Yeah.
Is that what he said for something like that?
Yeah.

1712
01:35:02.091 --> 01:35:05.680
It was just taken out of context.
He said way more fucked up than that.

1713
01:35:05.690 --> 01:35:08.660
I remember it being pretty racy and the queen to,
he was going to hold her down,

1714
01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:13.730
make her love lover.
The Queen,
Queen of England.
He's got hair is what he said.

1715
01:35:13.731 --> 01:35:18.080
Yeah,
I did think that's pretty funny.
Why would they a suspend the show for that?

1716
01:35:18.081 --> 01:35:19.670
That's so sad.
Yeah,
but you gave me a look.

1717
01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:21.200
I was sitting at that cause there wasn't a room you gave me.

1718
01:35:21.230 --> 01:35:24.320
I was sitting on the couch and you get,
she gave me a look and it was like,

1719
01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:26.960
oh my welcome to do things here.
And those guys open.

1720
01:35:26.961 --> 01:35:29.240
Antonio were so cool that I was like,

1721
01:35:29.630 --> 01:35:32.180
cause I knew I was only there hanging out with you,
but I was like,

1722
01:35:32.210 --> 01:35:35.900
I think they're okay if I play here.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And they totally were.

1723
01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:39.650
Oh yeah.
Well they're all,
there's never like a level.
You're not,
that's a good,

1724
01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:42.920
they never do that shit.
Yeah.
That's a real good point.
Like,
Oh,
you're a comic,

1725
01:35:42.921 --> 01:35:44.900
you're finding his cool.
How are you?
Yeah.

1726
01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:47.540
And well that's how some of the best guests come about.
And then they've,

1727
01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:50.240
they've made some of their best kiss guest famous.
You know,

1728
01:35:50.241 --> 01:35:53.720
when I first started going to New York,
I couldn't get on their show man.

1729
01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:57.350
I was in Jersey.
Yeah.
That wasn't known enough.
You know,
I was doing,

1730
01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:01.190
when they already had a show back then they were doing the afternoons.
I know.

1731
01:36:01.191 --> 01:36:05.150
Really I would do a rascals rascal's comedy and I'm in Jersey,

1732
01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:09.950
I forget where it was.
Orange West orange he was doing,
yeah.
West orange and,
um,

1733
01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:11.540
really nice club.
And I,
but I,
you know,

1734
01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:14.210
it was hard to get people to come in back then cause I was a nobody.

1735
01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:17.420
I was like headlining,
but I was on like hardball,
you know what I mean?
Like,
no,

1736
01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:21.740
nobody knew who the fuck I was.
So I would do a show on,
it'd be half empty.
Um,
so,

1737
01:36:21.741 --> 01:36:23.840
but if you got to know being Anthony,
you pack that place.

1738
01:36:23.841 --> 01:36:25.220
Like they would always talk about Jay more.

1739
01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:29.210
Jay Moore did opie and Anthony and he would just pack the fucking club pack he

1740
01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:32.300
just wanted then,
yeah,
it was like,
well,
if I could get their god,

1741
01:36:32.690 --> 01:36:34.970
but I couldn't get on.
I wasn't,
I didn't have enough clout.

1742
01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:39.040
So once I started doing it,
it was like,
ah,
so fun.
You know,
they're,
they're nuts,

1743
01:36:39.050 --> 01:36:41.240
man.
They've done some nutty fucking stunts.

1744
01:36:41.241 --> 01:36:43.730
But this guy leaned over a trash camera,

1745
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:48.200
tilted his head back like he was getting his hair shampooed at a barber pat from

1746
01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:51.410
[inaudible],
300 plus pounds of them.

1747
01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:55.670
This enormous man who has drank,
I believe it was 74 shots.

1748
01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:57.260
And I'm being conservative.

1749
01:36:57.290 --> 01:37:00.140
He beat the last guy that drank a couple more while the other guy got ready,

1750
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:02.570
he beat,
he beat his own record and he was like,
yeah,
that's what he did.

1751
01:37:02.571 --> 01:37:04.990
He wants to be this record.
And it goes,
all right.
It's time.
And then was like,

1752
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.190
all right,
that's about it.
That's all I got.
So I got,

1753
01:37:07.191 --> 01:37:10.520
and so this guy actually did what I suggested,

1754
01:37:10.530 --> 01:37:13.550
just Pat Duffy guy did lean over the barrel because that was the height of fear

1755
01:37:13.551 --> 01:37:16.490
factor.
So this,
it's like a perfect fear factor thing.
Exactly.

1756
01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:22.180
And Pat from would knocky did what can only be described as a comic book throw

1757
01:37:22.881 --> 01:37:24.790
up in this guy's mouth like,

1758
01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:29.960
and nowhere in the world has anyone thrown up on a person the way he did it.

1759
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:33.350
There's no way it's been done as a still picture and it looks like he is

1760
01:37:33.351 --> 01:37:36.860
enveloping.
They've got like a spider breaking down with his fluids.

1761
01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:41.560
Say That Pat Flynn would knock.
He also was a competitive eater or wasn't a,
yeah,

1762
01:37:41.561 --> 01:37:45.530
yeah.
He didn't just win this eggnog challenge.
He's been,

1763
01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:48.410
he's done and stop the career.
Great career,

1764
01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:52.190
career and competitive eating,
where he's been fairly successful.

1765
01:37:52.191 --> 01:37:57.120
He's an extraordinary man when it comes to volume.
So he's got this killing it,

1766
01:37:57.121 --> 01:37:58.920
fucking this,

1767
01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:04.160
this broken fire hydrants spew coming out of his mouth where we're going.

1768
01:38:08.850 --> 01:38:13.350
And I mean,
and it lasts.
It lasts way more than should be real.

1769
01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:15.140
It seems like it's Photoshop.

1770
01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:18.690
If we weren't there and it wasn't from a bunch of different angles and Shitty

1771
01:38:18.691 --> 01:38:19.740
cell phone footage.

1772
01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:23.070
I think our version is that one of us had a cell phone there was recording it,

1773
01:38:23.071 --> 01:38:24.930
but it's,
it's so crazy.

1774
01:38:25.770 --> 01:38:30.180
It's so crazy that the volume is so insane.
It doesn't,

1775
01:38:30.181 --> 01:38:35.130
it's so cartoonish.
It's so comic bookish.
It's just bad.
It's the extra cyst.

1776
01:38:35.131 --> 01:38:38.130
I mean,
it's insane.
And then after we left and there's bars everywhere,

1777
01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:40.290
we were out of the studio 10 minutes later we're like,
hey,

1778
01:38:40.291 --> 01:38:44.550
Ron and fez enjoy this smell and no shit.
And just left it to him.
Yeah.

1779
01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:45.630
In these giant,

1780
01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:50.720
like big garbage pails filled with throw up and it's plastic all over the floor.

1781
01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:52.493
I mean Donk,

1782
01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:55.640
the air control come on and the waft would hit you where you're like,
Ooh,

1783
01:38:55.980 --> 01:39:00.690
it was chaos.
It was pre merger.
They had a lot more freedom back then.

1784
01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:05.880
You know the,
and that was,
that was the regular radio virgin,
right?
Yes.
Yes.

1785
01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:10.440
That was f k Rock,
k Rock in New York.
God,
that was awesome.

1786
01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:14.430
There was so much fun.
And then the rest of the day we would like in bliss,

1787
01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:18.570
like she has to see something fucked up.
Yeah,
we saw something fucked up.

1788
01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:20.140
We were so lucky.
Equivalent.

1789
01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:22.230
I'm realizing it's not when you're talking about the bus room,
cause we were,

1790
01:39:22.231 --> 01:39:26.070
we were happy.
Yeah.
It's the equivalent of when a girl blows you in the morning.

1791
01:39:26.190 --> 01:39:30.390
Whoa.
And the rest of the day you just feel good.
That's pretty hot.
Yeah,
it is.

1792
01:39:30.391 --> 01:39:34.810
It's close to it.
Yeah.
We,
we had achieved this moment of like,

1793
01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:39.420
especially
comedians want to see fucked up things.

1794
01:39:39.690 --> 01:39:41.430
We want to see things at a reduced rate.
After that,

1795
01:39:41.431 --> 01:39:46.050
we had the whole thing with Jamie,
Jamie Masada from the laugh factory,
which is,

1796
01:39:46.051 --> 01:39:50.400
by the way,
dom just,
I did his,
his podcast over there and he goes,

1797
01:39:50.770 --> 01:39:54.780
while Jamie's there,
he goes,
Jamie,
how can we not put Arriann got a following up?

1798
01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:57.270
I put them on.
I'm like,
Dang,
that's cool if you don't,
but no,
you know,

1799
01:39:57.271 --> 01:40:01.980
you don't never hear.
Wow.
But like,
yeah,
but he's like,
okay,
I'll put you on.

1800
01:40:02.010 --> 01:40:05.070
And now he's like actively trying to get me in there.
That's beautiful.

1801
01:40:07.290 --> 01:40:12.000
Really Nice.
I'm going to do that.
Tom's a good guy,
man.
And Dom quits drinking.

1802
01:40:12.150 --> 01:40:17.150
He quit drinking recently and he's experienced like this rejuvenation and the

1803
01:40:17.341 --> 01:40:21.570
way he feels and about stand up comedy.
Yeah.
And doing the podcast a few times.

1804
01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:25.110
Stand up as a,
you know,
a lot of people coming out to see him from the podcast.

1805
01:40:25.111 --> 01:40:28.590
You know,
that they'd come up to him afterwards.
So yeah,
the,
the quitting,

1806
01:40:28.591 --> 01:40:31.560
the drinking things.
Fuck,
I'd have them on.
I probably go giants,
man.
Oh yeah,

1807
01:40:31.561 --> 01:40:35.010
you have mine.
He's a great guy.
He's an interesting dude too.
And Dom Irrera.

1808
01:40:35.011 --> 01:40:38.970
It's like the most honest,
don't give a fuck guy left on earth.

1809
01:40:40.350 --> 01:40:44.620
His famous line that I always quote,
uh,
is,
um,
uh,

1810
01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:49.080
uh,
I wish I was gay just so I could come out of the closet.

1811
01:40:49.230 --> 01:40:50.670
That's how little I give a fuck.

1812
01:40:56.830 --> 01:40:59.290
Anyway.
If you go to my website,
are the great for free tracks.

1813
01:40:59.291 --> 01:41:00.940
Go there and get four free drugs for nothing.

1814
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:04.300
Are you coming with me afterwards here to go see my,
a studio?

1815
01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:07.360
Are you going to sue that?
Let's go see that movie.
One movie.

1816
01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:10.900
The one you were talking about.
Oh,
the Jewish welfare?
No,
the Will Ferrell movie.

1817
01:41:11.050 --> 01:41:13.420
Oh yeah.
I would go see that.
Okay.
Let me,

1818
01:41:13.421 --> 01:41:18.100
I might have to do some baby shit though.
You know,
little girls I might have.

1819
01:41:18.190 --> 01:41:21.480
I might have.
I have to remember whether or not a committed to doing okay.

1820
01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:24.740
Doing okay.
Sometimes I say,
okay,
well go do that later.
I mean,

1821
01:41:24.741 --> 01:41:26.860
I don't remember about it and then my wife has to go,

1822
01:41:26.861 --> 01:41:28.840
you promised you would do that later.
Like they get mad.

1823
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:33.610
You can't disappoint he that shit.
Oh,
that was that.
Yeah,
they get,
they get,

1824
01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:35.410
they get a little shout out cause it means a lot to them.

1825
01:41:35.410 --> 01:41:37.120
That's the thing I'd be so worried about with kids.

1826
01:41:37.121 --> 01:41:40.900
You make an offhanded statement and they take it forever.
It doesn't matter.

1827
01:41:40.901 --> 01:41:44.530
You just,
you just,
you know,
Miss,
make sure that you don't disappoint them.

1828
01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:49.480
It's just,
it's more of a responsibility.
But the,
the reward of it is amazing.

1829
01:41:49.710 --> 01:41:52.240
It's hard to really wrap your head around cause I've been like you before,

1830
01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:54.640
you know,
I've been single and you know,

1831
01:41:54.641 --> 01:41:57.670
and to be like the last thing I want some form of care.
I believe me,

1832
01:41:57.671 --> 01:42:02.440
I was like the voice of that before.
Here's what it's like until you have that.

1833
01:42:02.441 --> 01:42:03.490
Okay.
But here I get that,

1834
01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:06.070
I get that there is a whole different side of it and there are benefits that I

1835
01:42:06.071 --> 01:42:09.010
can understand that and there's negatives that I can or anything like that.
Sure.

1836
01:42:09.011 --> 01:42:13.150
I'm just sort of wrap my head around,
but like,
um,
what was I going to say?
Fuck.

1837
01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:13.660
Oh,

1838
01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:17.650
hit the decision to whether or not you should have a baby should be thought of

1839
01:42:17.651 --> 01:42:21.880
that.
Should we thought up before randomly,
some girl says,
Hey,
I'm pregnant.

1840
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.660
Oh yeah,
you should already be decided.
Can we have a baby now?
Or not?
Not like,

1841
01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:29.170
wow,
maybe we should do this.
That's not the right time to think about it.
Yeah.

1842
01:42:29.171 --> 01:42:34.030
My um,
the,
the two year old was the one that we did on purpose,

1843
01:42:34.130 --> 01:42:34.310
you know,

1844
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:38.440
and it was like planned out and everything and I was happy for the other

1845
01:42:38.441 --> 01:42:40.150
daughter as well.
I mean,
super happy.

1846
01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:43.240
I met him when you told me about it as we were playing pool.
It was crazy,

1847
01:42:43.241 --> 01:42:46.330
but super happy.
But,
but planning for one is kind of a different thing.

1848
01:42:46.331 --> 01:42:49.360
Like you're planning,
how is it different and it sounds so good.

1849
01:42:49.361 --> 01:42:52.450
We're trying to get pregnant.
Like,
you know,
she's trying to get pregnant.
Stupid.

1850
01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:57.070
You're just fucking her.
Right.
You know what didn't we were trying were pregnant.

1851
01:42:57.100 --> 01:42:59.110
No,
you're not.
You're not pregnant.
That's the trade off.
Shut up.

1852
01:42:59.111 --> 01:43:01.060
We have to pay you alimony for fucking 40 years.

1853
01:43:01.061 --> 01:43:03.640
But we get to say we are pregnant.
It's just some bait,
a shit.

1854
01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:05.590
It's just some Beta shit that men fall into.

1855
01:43:05.630 --> 01:43:09.250
Once they get their wives pregnant and they become your testosterone drops.

1856
01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:13.120
It's really scientifically proven.
You mimic their behavior sort of.
Well,

1857
01:43:13.121 --> 01:43:14.020
you become a Nester.

1858
01:43:14.110 --> 01:43:17.380
You know your testosterone drops when you're a year round babies,

1859
01:43:17.381 --> 01:43:20.620
you were on your wife and it's also try to probably try to calm you down to make

1860
01:43:20.621 --> 01:43:23.800
you a little bit more patient.
Nature knows what the fuck is doing.
Am I ever,

1861
01:43:23.810 --> 01:43:28.720
I had a rabbi once in a sixth grade rabbinic a nutcracker.
But anyway,

1862
01:43:28.721 --> 01:43:31.600
he said,
ah,
the reason God makes babies cute so we don't kill them.

1863
01:43:31.930 --> 01:43:35.170
I used to do that in my arms.
I said,
the reason they like,
yeah,
we'll oxytocin.

1864
01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:37.170
It's oxytocin.
It's something that you,

1865
01:43:37.210 --> 01:43:40.130
your brain produces when you see your babies and the suits.

1866
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:44.170
Credibles drawing of love and connection.
This,
this incredible drug.

1867
01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:45.920
It's the same drug that women,
uh,

1868
01:43:45.930 --> 01:43:49.830
that it's released in women when their orgasm and really joking my accident.

1869
01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:52.550
And then it's to keep you from eating when you get really hungry.

1870
01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:56.750
That's the reason why a baby produces oxytocin.
Like when you see them,

1871
01:43:56.751 --> 01:44:00.830
like you literally do that in you a drug.
Yup.
Yeah.
You literally get drugged.

1872
01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:04.500
I mean,
it's all set up.
It's set up so that we keep reading.
It's not a,

1873
01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:09.410
it's not a,
you know,
it's not,
uh,
an accident that when you're around a check,

1874
01:44:09.411 --> 01:44:11.550
your dick gets hard and get all attracted to her.

1875
01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:14.990
Like this girl that has a super powers that you're talking about,

1876
01:44:14.991 --> 01:44:16.730
you're talking about like a beautiful girl was like,

1877
01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:18.810
she just thinks she's got a superpower.

1878
01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:20.770
She can walk into a room and everybody wants to fuck around.

1879
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:24.380
So she's confused and she acts crazy,
but no one cares the little jewelry,

1880
01:44:24.410 --> 01:44:26.840
anything because she's felt like Traci Lords,

1881
01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:30.080
I know there's nothing to alter their chemicals on you or this is new girl

1882
01:44:30.081 --> 01:44:33.230
that's hanging out at the store and she's a comic and everybody,
yeah,

1883
01:44:33.231 --> 01:44:36.410
everyone wants buyer and she's not super gorgeous and she doesn't dress slutty

1884
01:44:36.411 --> 01:44:38.720
already.
She's just dirty.
But yeah,
she's just dirty.

1885
01:44:38.721 --> 01:44:40.820
He said dirty and everybody walks by or,
and it was like,

1886
01:44:40.830 --> 01:44:41.780
who does that girls deal?

1887
01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:46.280
Like I've heard a thousand comics ask and it's just she's exuding something.

1888
01:44:46.281 --> 01:44:48.560
Some chemical.
Yeah.
There's girls that are just sexy man.

1889
01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:50.330
There's girls that are not that good looking,

1890
01:44:50.331 --> 01:44:52.850
but they're fucking give you a or something.
I don't know what it is.

1891
01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:53.713
And by the way,

1892
01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:58.820
Sax with them is always way better sex with a girl who's really pretty but not

1893
01:44:58.821 --> 01:45:00.500
into it and you to someone to be into it.

1894
01:45:00.501 --> 01:45:04.850
It's weird what once the guy's willing to fuck you,
let it all out.

1895
01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:07.540
Don't worry about like ocean,
look at this and that's what I'm talking about.

1896
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:11.660
Let it go.
Let it go,
baby.
We're happier there and if he throws up,
he throws up.

1897
01:45:11.690 --> 01:45:12.800
Exactly.
Ain't Ganna.

1898
01:45:13.370 --> 01:45:17.390
The people used to love those points were really fat guys would fuck girls.

1899
01:45:17.391 --> 01:45:19.760
I remember there was a magazine called sluts and slobs.

1900
01:45:21.690 --> 01:45:25.830
That was what,
like looking at the girl Hako.
Yeah.

1901
01:45:25.950 --> 01:45:27.710
It was one of my favorite all time

1902
01:45:29.470 --> 01:45:31.190
because it was sloppy.

1903
01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:35.510
Who's dudes with like Spaghetti stains on tank tops and shit.

1904
01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:39.860
They were dressed as a slob.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1905
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.540
The whole fantasy was that these dudes were just slinging Mike Blacks.

1906
01:45:44.541 --> 01:45:48.410
When we catch up with my black,
my blacks are fairly handsome man.

1907
01:45:48.411 --> 01:45:52.630
We're talking about like really fucking sweaty guys,
man.

1908
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:58.580
Yes.
Yesterday we've had some good times on the road.
I'm crazy.
Fuck yeah,
dude.

1909
01:45:58.730 --> 01:46:02.770
Well,
the,
the comradery that comes from being a standup comedian,
it's like,
it's,

1910
01:46:02.771 --> 01:46:05.220
it's hard for a lot.
Like we talk about comedy all the time.

1911
01:46:05.250 --> 01:46:08.000
We talk about the art form of comedy and a lot of times people are like,
Ooh,

1912
01:46:08.001 --> 01:46:12.290
good Jews doing will come in to too much.
You got to understand that.

1913
01:46:12.291 --> 01:46:14.930
For us it's like,
it's,
I mean it sounds so stupid,

1914
01:46:14.931 --> 01:46:16.490
but it's almost like a sacred topic.

1915
01:46:16.530 --> 01:46:19.190
But also this things you can get from it too if you're listening through.
Wait,

1916
01:46:19.210 --> 01:46:22.030
Greg Jackson talks about it.
He always asked me questions about stand up.
Yeah.

1917
01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:24.610
He's always like,
so what did you do when you're not doing well?
What do you do?

1918
01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:26.990
He's in [inaudible] games.
Yeah.
But he's like,

1919
01:46:26.991 --> 01:46:30.110
he sees the similarities between what he's trying to train and what we're doing

1920
01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:32.870
and all the arts.
Well,
there's a similarity in truth,

1921
01:46:33.070 --> 01:46:35.120
if you don't hit the right notes and comedy,

1922
01:46:35.121 --> 01:46:37.410
it's clunky and awkward and we're the right steps on this.

1923
01:46:37.411 --> 01:46:40.280
Now we all know that like there's a bid,
the you've done,

1924
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:43.460
everybody's got a bit that if you heard it today you would cringe because you

1925
01:46:43.461 --> 01:46:47.150
know it's clunky.
You got into a bad,
right.
Well that that used to be like,

1926
01:46:47.210 --> 01:46:50.910
like a approach that I would use with,
you know,
martial arts techniques.

1927
01:46:50.911 --> 01:46:55.170
Like I had some bad approaches that I had like when I was a blue belt or green

1928
01:46:55.171 --> 01:46:58.210
belt that I would use an intro right there,
would never use as a black,
they're,

1929
01:46:58.260 --> 01:47:02.760
they're,
they're terrible approach might work with full of mistakes.
Then you get,

1930
01:47:02.770 --> 01:47:06.450
Oh,
you know,
you just attack you,
you go wide open and still you can't do that.

1931
01:47:06.451 --> 01:47:11.010
You have to have faints and you have to have movement that you have to learn

1932
01:47:11.011 --> 01:47:13.620
what a throw a guy off and what doesn't throw a guy off.

1933
01:47:14.010 --> 01:47:18.000
And there's moments when you look back on the,
the beginning jokes,

1934
01:47:20.010 --> 01:47:24.300
just clunky,
dark.
Anyone's listening can relate to that.

1935
01:47:24.301 --> 01:47:27.090
And it's something that they've done where they were bad at something and cause

1936
01:47:27.210 --> 01:47:28.740
if you're not,
you're a bitch.
If you,

1937
01:47:28.830 --> 01:47:31.930
if you've lived your life and never got good at something with the funny thing.

1938
01:47:31.931 --> 01:47:35.910
Yeah,
yeah.
What have you done?
You crazy.
You've missed out on what's a look,

1939
01:47:36.210 --> 01:47:39.090
it's hard to do shit.
It's,
it's difficult and scary,

1940
01:47:39.210 --> 01:47:43.230
but that's what friends are for.
Friends,
cushion,
all that shit.
If you've got,

1941
01:47:43.250 --> 01:47:43.490
you know,

1942
01:47:43.490 --> 01:47:46.500
one of the things that Randy couture said it really kind of a cool thing that he

1943
01:47:46.501 --> 01:47:48.690
said about fighting.
He said that if you,

1944
01:47:48.691 --> 01:47:51.300
if you love your friends and love your family,
they're going to love you.

1945
01:47:51.301 --> 01:47:53.400
If you win and lose,
you don't have to worry about that,

1946
01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:55.680
but that is something that people think about.
Like you,

1947
01:47:55.681 --> 01:47:59.400
you base your worth and your value on winning and it becomes too much of a big

1948
01:47:59.401 --> 01:48:02.850
deal to you becomes like everything becomes your whole life.

1949
01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:06.660
I heard this about kids recently that you shouldn't say good job when I get a

1950
01:48:06.661 --> 01:48:07.560
good grade or something,

1951
01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:11.700
because that is an unintentionally instilling in them that they are only

1952
01:48:11.701 --> 01:48:14.970
successful in your eyes or are good in their eyes when they're winning.

1953
01:48:15.450 --> 01:48:18.940
So when you want to create a team full of pussies or what,
what the fuck are you?

1954
01:48:20.110 --> 01:48:23.470
I'm here in the baby books.
I think those baby books are written by cunts.

1955
01:48:24.290 --> 01:48:27.180
It's possible.
I don't know.
It was crazy.

1956
01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:31.660
Fuck heads who don't know shit about raising.
I'm just talking shit.
It's crazy.

1957
01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:33.600
People like to be reinforced.

1958
01:48:33.601 --> 01:48:38.601
I think positive reinforcement for for jobs was to do his job well.

1959
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:41.640
Tried.
If they're trying hard,
that's what you're supposed to reward.
Nonsense.

1960
01:48:41.670 --> 01:48:45.360
Success.
That sounds like some socialists bullshit.
I went into cup target.

1961
01:48:45.361 --> 01:48:47.820
White liberals designed to slow down the marathon.

1962
01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:51.300
Somebody doesn't want to see a sub three hour marathon,

1963
01:48:51.301 --> 01:48:56.100
whatever mile I was trying to form into my four minute mile and a three hour

1964
01:48:56.101 --> 01:48:59.910
marathon.
I think they all run into three minutes.
Read Paul Ryan character.
No,

1965
01:48:59.911 --> 01:49:03.610
they don't all run like the champions.
I mean,
yeah,
I champion the 22 thirds.

1966
01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:07.500
That's why that Paul Ryan Dude tried to sneak in that he ran a sub three hour

1967
01:49:07.501 --> 01:49:11.220
marathon and they called him on it.
He didn't told no

1968
01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:14.610
more than four hours.
It was documented.

1969
01:49:17.330 --> 01:49:19.560
Are you going to vote this year?
No,
you're not going to.

1970
01:49:19.670 --> 01:49:20.790
I'm thinking of not voting.

1971
01:49:20.791 --> 01:49:23.520
You've said in the past you think it's all ridiculous.
This,
this is the,

1972
01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:25.830
they really believe that.
Then there's no reason to waste your day.

1973
01:49:26.570 --> 01:49:30.960
Then another day with your kids.
I think with the electoral college system,

1974
01:49:30.990 --> 01:49:34.170
it's in place and anybody that's telling me that Obama is better than Mitt

1975
01:49:34.170 --> 01:49:35.880
Romney,
then Mitt Romney,
he's the God damn Holocaust.

1976
01:49:35.881 --> 01:49:38.130
If that's what you're telling me.
If you're telling me that Obama,

1977
01:49:38.610 --> 01:49:39.780
that Mitt Romney is,

1978
01:49:40.010 --> 01:49:42.750
it's going to be worse than Obama and when you think about all the shit that's

1979
01:49:42.751 --> 01:49:45.270
happened in this country to civil liberties over the last couple of years,

1980
01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:46.710
whether people are aware of it or not,

1981
01:49:46.860 --> 01:49:50.230
it's almost like this country is tightening up and getting ready for civil war.

1982
01:49:50.231 --> 01:49:52.900
Like they're getting scared that there's going to be civil unrest.

1983
01:49:52.901 --> 01:49:56.830
So they're putting all these things in the place where they can spy on you and

1984
01:49:56.831 --> 01:50:00.850
all these things in place that are fucking completely unamerican and completely

1985
01:50:00.851 --> 01:50:01.840
unconstitutional.

1986
01:50:01.870 --> 01:50:05.500
And then they went and reread the constitutional rewrote rather the constitution

1987
01:50:05.501 --> 01:50:07.490
they took out thing.
The things that you like.

1988
01:50:07.530 --> 01:50:11.180
Posse comitatus I believe it is the head,
the ability to use the military to,

1989
01:50:11.220 --> 01:50:15.050
to stop civil unrest.
American military.
Yes.

1990
01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:18.520
The American military can now be used to stop civil unrest.

1991
01:50:18.521 --> 01:50:22.570
They can now arrest you for for Shit and they don't have to bring it to trial

1992
01:50:22.571 --> 01:50:24.940
and they can hold you as long as they want and you have no recourse.

1993
01:50:25.330 --> 01:50:28.510
This is all for American stuff so cause no,

1994
01:50:28.511 --> 01:50:30.160
cause someone's going to abuse that power.

1995
01:50:30.180 --> 01:50:33.940
Exactly who it is and they say they will never use it and Obama was like we'll

1996
01:50:33.941 --> 01:50:37.750
never use us.
It does.
Okay.
How about someone that's being born right now?

1997
01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:39.670
It grows up in 40 years to become the president.

1998
01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:41.020
You were saying you'll never use it.

1999
01:50:41.290 --> 01:50:46.290
There's a reason why we had all this shit set up on a long time ago to make sure

2000
01:50:46.421 --> 01:50:48.610
that you didn't involve church and state.

2001
01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:50.570
I think we've got to rewrite the constitution.
Of course we do.

2002
01:50:50.670 --> 01:50:53.100
We write a brand new one cause that stuff that happened to him,
it go,

2003
01:50:53.101 --> 01:50:54.220
it has nothing to do with us.

2004
01:50:54.221 --> 01:50:56.590
He can't have a constitution that was written before the Internet.

2005
01:50:56.620 --> 01:51:00.790
That's nonsense.
The ability for electricity.
Yeah.
Well the,
you know,

2006
01:51:00.910 --> 01:51:05.020
look they had,
they knew the concepts of classic societies.
They knew,

2007
01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:09.340
they knew the concepts of what was,
what was going to cause people to fall apart.

2008
01:51:09.341 --> 01:51:11.320
What's going to cause people to give in to their,

2009
01:51:11.321 --> 01:51:15.550
ed was going to cause people to,
to be corrupt and to,
to,
to go wrong.

2010
01:51:15.670 --> 01:51:18.340
And so they presented all that shit.
They prevented freedom.

2011
01:51:18.341 --> 01:51:20.050
So we just gotta be able to say whatever the fuck you want to say.

2012
01:51:20.050 --> 01:51:23.800
You can't stop people from talking.
You got to let people express themselves.

2013
01:51:23.801 --> 01:51:27.130
You get a lot loud people to protest.
You have to allow people to organize.

2014
01:51:27.131 --> 01:51:28.420
You've got to let them be armed.

2015
01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:31.090
There's all these things they sent in place cause they knew because they know if

2016
01:51:31.091 --> 01:51:32.290
you're going to all your,
we have none,

2017
01:51:32.291 --> 01:51:35.620
you're going to abuse that and that's something that liberal people don't want

2018
01:51:35.621 --> 01:51:36.071
to accept.

2019
01:51:36.071 --> 01:51:39.470
The problem in this world is the gun prop know their problems and all this is

2020
01:51:39.550 --> 01:51:44.470
crazy people.
You have to allow for that.
There will be people you might not,

2021
01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:46.790
but some people will and so then you have to defend yourself.
You have to,

2022
01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.720
if that's it,
another sickness,
higher door.

2023
01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:51.970
It's a sickness and society that we have to address.

2024
01:51:51.971 --> 01:51:55.210
Why are we creating sick people?
Why are we creating crazy people?

2025
01:51:55.211 --> 01:51:59.560
Why are we creating violent people and that can be resolved with time and

2026
01:51:59.561 --> 01:52:04.150
education and some form of action,
some form of social engineering.

2027
01:52:04.150 --> 01:52:08.140
I believe that you're going to be able to at least cut significantly down on the

2028
01:52:08.141 --> 01:52:11.830
amount of constant douchebags that are developed by,
by a civilization.

2029
01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:16.280
I think if we went from being barbarians to people that live in a more civilized

2030
01:52:16.281 --> 01:52:19.510
now,
way more civilized obviously,
right?
It's not even close.

2031
01:52:19.511 --> 01:52:22.330
So if you just extrapolate a hundred years into the future,

2032
01:52:22.331 --> 01:52:25.390
you would assume that things will continue to get easier and easier and easier.

2033
01:52:25.391 --> 01:52:28.870
Yeah,
I got think that eventually we can do,
but you know,

2034
01:52:28.871 --> 01:52:31.660
we're never gonna be able to engineer out greed.

2035
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:33.370
We're never going to be able to engineer out.

2036
01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:36.190
If someone has to complete and total control over an entire city,

2037
01:52:36.370 --> 01:52:39.700
they will do something terrible.
They just,
that's human nature.

2038
01:52:39.701 --> 01:52:42.010
I just say that it's like,
hold on.

2039
01:52:42.011 --> 01:52:44.440
Why would you say you would never do that when so many people have done it?

2040
01:52:44.530 --> 01:52:46.010
You should say,
I'm glad I don't have

2041
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:47.860
<v 2>that power because I probably would abuse it.
Right?</v>

2042
01:52:47.861 --> 01:52:50.900
Because if you look at like what we've done,
you know,
as a human race,

2043
01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:55.940
we're just in a military means or by military means over the last decade,

2044
01:52:56.150 --> 01:52:57.740
how much different is it really?

2045
01:52:57.741 --> 01:53:01.040
Then what happened during the days of the barbarian hordes?
You know,

2046
01:53:01.041 --> 01:53:03.260
the numbers are probably more significant.

2047
01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:05.750
Like it seems more civilized in the surface,

2048
01:53:05.751 --> 01:53:07.670
but they're more effective at killing people.

2049
01:53:07.850 --> 01:53:10.790
They can kill massive numbers of people with like a bunch of people.

2050
01:53:10.791 --> 01:53:13.910
Just died the other day.
I think it was in Yemen where they,
they,

2051
01:53:13.911 --> 01:53:18.830
they shot a bunch of civilians with one of those fucking drones and they just

2052
01:53:18.831 --> 01:53:21.890
killed 14 people,
14 civilians.
I mean,

2053
01:53:21.891 --> 01:53:24.830
women and children and they're getting jacked constantly by these things.

2054
01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:28.670
The whole thing.
There's thousands of people been killed by these drones.
Wow.

2055
01:53:28.730 --> 01:53:29.420
That's,
that's a,

2056
01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:32.090
that's how they want to outlaw up because that just allows for error too easily

2057
01:53:32.091 --> 01:53:36.010
and no one has to like feel it.
Well,
no one's,

2058
01:53:36.230 --> 01:53:39.080
there's no significant voice to outlaw these things.
Really.

2059
01:53:39.081 --> 01:53:42.020
I've heard people say those,
those,
that's one of the things I've heard about,

2060
01:53:42.170 --> 01:53:45.170
but yeah,
not in this country,
man.
You don't hear Mitt Romney saying it.

2061
01:53:45.171 --> 01:53:48.310
We're going to stop.
The drones were going to stop those drone attacks.
No,
no,
no.

2062
01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:49.620
Pick it.
Or people will say,
oh,

2063
01:53:49.650 --> 01:53:54.070
those people don't have a say so you don't have any silly picutre people stoke

2064
01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:58.490
those people.
He said,
do you think,
um,
President Bush,
this is how long it was.

2065
01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:01.880
He goes,
do you think President Bush cares about US protesting the war?
He goes,

2066
01:54:01.881 --> 01:54:06.790
I think he thinks about the protesters,
the way we feel about the WWE Mba.
Like,

2067
01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:11.240
sure,
it's annoying,
but let them feel like they're making a difference.

2068
01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:15.500
Oh my God,
I can't believe you went there was pick her up,
retire from comedy.

2069
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:19.640
Why do you retire?
It wasn't making him happy after awhile.

2070
01:54:19.670 --> 01:54:21.500
He just wasn't making money at it and he was like,

2071
01:54:21.501 --> 01:54:24.770
I got to do something when I'm on a struggle for fucking one 45 spots in the

2072
01:54:24.771 --> 01:54:29.000
store.
A lot of guys get close.
The grind is hard,
man.
The fucking,
the grind.

2073
01:54:29.001 --> 01:54:31.400
When you're especially a grind in la,

2074
01:54:31.850 --> 01:54:33.380
when you're like one of those up and coming comics,

2075
01:54:33.381 --> 01:54:34.610
so you don't even ever like road gigs.

2076
01:54:34.611 --> 01:54:36.350
He can pick up for 50 bucks here and there.

2077
01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:39.460
One time I perform for free for someone.
Yeah,
I should.

2078
01:54:39.970 --> 01:54:42.470
You know how in the running and there's an explosion behind your or tidal wave

2079
01:54:42.471 --> 01:54:46.990
coming at you or like the bridges falling behind you and people behind you were

2080
01:54:46.991 --> 01:54:51.140
falling in,
but you managed to make it off before it completely collapses.

2081
01:54:51.650 --> 01:54:54.800
That's how I view a standup comedy where there's some funny people that just

2082
01:54:54.801 --> 01:54:59.060
didn't get a living enough to get them going and they fell off the bridge.
Yeah.

2083
01:54:59.061 --> 01:55:01.820
I mean it's like anything else.
We all sucked at it at the beginning of just get,

2084
01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:05.870
it's the reason why you can equate standup comedy to martial arts is cause it's

2085
01:55:05.871 --> 01:55:08.570
two things that you have to look at really realistically.

2086
01:55:08.571 --> 01:55:09.710
In order to get better at them,

2087
01:55:10.030 --> 01:55:12.770
you've got to figure out how to fucking make your way through the maze.

2088
01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:15.740
And if it gets to me pregnant early,
it's going to be a lot harder.
Fuck yeah,

2089
01:55:15.741 --> 01:55:17.230
it is.
You know,
you might've quit.

2090
01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:21.110
I almost definitely would have quit if I got somebody pregnant 26 a year end.

2091
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:24.290
But you think you would take you to take some time off?
For sure.

2092
01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:29.150
Who comes back after time off?
Who knows?
Like in a ghoul did really?
Yeah.

2093
01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:33.070
Dana Gould took a long time off.
He was writing for the Simpsons.
Yeah.

2094
01:55:33.170 --> 01:55:36.680
But that it was raising kids too.
I Dunno,
I might've made that up.

2095
01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:40.220
Imagine if he's gay.
I'm just making sure he wasn't going to get a dog.

2096
01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:44.210
I think it does hinder my story teller show.
Really cool.

2097
01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:47.700
<v 0>He was one of those guys that was around,
uh,
in Boston.
He was ahead of me.</v>

2098
01:55:48.090 --> 01:55:49.650
He was like a couple of years ahead of me.

2099
01:55:49.980 --> 01:55:53.390
I don't think he's coming to your professional.
No.
He comes back like a lineup.

2100
01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:55.890
Like Mary Lynn comes back that,
but they,
once they give it up,

2101
01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:59.250
you're never back in it.
Not the same to,
you know,
it's just like dead.

2102
01:55:59.251 --> 01:56:02.430
Your heart's not in it.
You're double.
Your performance isn't as good.
Yeah.

2103
01:56:02.590 --> 01:56:03.720
These once in a month.

2104
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:07.620
The people like us that are like real hardcore standup fanatics,

2105
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:12.510
like we despise people that quit.
You quit and plus he tried to be like,
oh no.

2106
01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:15.570
Well I'm glad you're happy.
You're happy now.
You know,
we're looking at you like

2107
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:19.110
you're giving up the greatest drug in the world.

2108
01:56:19.111 --> 01:56:22.080
It's just he can't take the ride.
The ride is just to bumping you pussy,

2109
01:56:22.081 --> 01:56:24.210
but just like though you're not one of us anymore.
It's where the grant,

2110
01:56:24.211 --> 01:56:27.810
how could you not be one of us along?
Yeah.

2111
01:56:27.811 --> 01:56:31.380
I gotta be careful when I'm around guys like stand up or stand hope rather.
What?

2112
01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:33.090
Cause I wanna start doing mushrooms in front of them.

2113
01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:35.790
You want to start around a guy like that?
You'll just do more,

2114
01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:39.060
do mushrooms and drive home and drive home.
Yeah.
It's a problem.

2115
01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:43.140
That's a problem if you like.
I kind of,
I haven't had the training he has.
Yeah.

2116
01:56:43.141 --> 01:56:44.580
One of our friends,
which we'll go,

2117
01:56:44.581 --> 01:56:47.450
let's say he wrote his name rhymes with Smitty.
Wavo yeah.

2118
01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:53.100
Was on a crazy mushroom dose and he was driving home and the the road in front

2119
01:56:53.101 --> 01:56:57.090
of them turn into flower petals.
Oh my God.

2120
01:56:57.091 --> 01:56:58.380
It's like as he was driving it,

2121
01:56:58.381 --> 01:57:02.460
it's just flowers are flying off of his wheels and flowers were in front of
them.

2122
01:57:03.150 --> 01:57:06.790
Yeah.
Could you imagine it wasn't that bad but just once where his dry.

2123
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:09.650
I thought it was done because I was doing it in someone's apartment.
Um,

2124
01:57:09.730 --> 01:57:10.620
and that was all right.
I'm good.

2125
01:57:10.621 --> 01:57:12.530
I'm going to go home and spend five hours and then I'm driving.

2126
01:57:12.531 --> 01:57:15.570
I was looking at a sign,
but it's like,
that's like that picture behind you.

2127
01:57:15.571 --> 01:57:18.480
It has a lot of colors and it just starts swimming.
When I was at the light,

2128
01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:21.000
like everything started,
then I was like,
oh fuck,
do noon.

2129
01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:26.370
Do I feel like it's too dangerous to drive on?
Oh Fuck,
wait,
I'll do it.

2130
01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:31.230
Mushrooms,
mushrooms are real.
Uh,
it dissipates reality.

2131
01:57:31.620 --> 01:57:33.660
It gets reality to a place where you're like,

2132
01:57:33.661 --> 01:57:36.390
I don't know if you can manage this.
You,
you,

2133
01:57:36.391 --> 01:57:41.160
you might be experiencing something that's absolutely not there at all.
Yeah.

2134
01:57:41.190 --> 01:57:45.250
You could just drive over a fucking cliff.
Think you're on a water ride.
You know,

2135
01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:49.530
you never quite lose reality,
but you sort of get close.

2136
01:57:50.670 --> 01:57:53.340
Like you don't lose where you are.
100% I'm going to cap city,
by the way.

2137
01:57:53.670 --> 01:57:58.440
When are you working there?
Two weeks.
The 14th I think.
September 14th let me see.

2138
01:57:58.590 --> 01:58:02.040
Nice.
So number 14 says that shit,

four days to four days.
The 12th through the 15th.

2141
01:58:10.171 --> 01:58:14.010
Holy Shit Dude.
You're a legit comic.
Now you are,

2142
01:58:14.011 --> 01:58:16.530
you're a legit headline in places.
Now it's religion.

2143
01:58:16.531 --> 01:58:20.580
How many fucking cool man and the Cap City Comedy Club in Austin,
Texas.

2144
01:58:20.581 --> 01:58:24.630
That's legitimate gets man as a standup comedian that and the comedy works in

2145
01:58:24.631 --> 01:58:25.390
Denver.

2146
01:58:25.390 --> 01:58:28.080
Do you want to talk about like the independent clubs that are like super legit

2147
01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:32.820
Yap city.
It's a super legit,
you're there.
You're a rear rear real comic.

2148
01:58:33.330 --> 01:58:37.980
There's five rooms that I put on my like my favorite five rooms for like a long

2149
01:58:37.981 --> 01:58:42.190
time.
Yeah.
Um,
or the comedy store cap city.

2150
01:58:42.730 --> 01:58:43.720
<v 2>Denver comedy works.</v>

2151
01:58:43.810 --> 01:58:47.950
These improv just cause it was my first road rules as far as the vibe as hot

2152
01:58:47.951 --> 01:58:51.070
room and throw Austin might have the best vibe in the history of the universe.

2153
01:58:51.110 --> 01:58:54.520
That's so cool.
That's why we filmed that.
Um,
uh,
what,
what did we call it?

2154
01:58:55.060 --> 01:58:56.530
My butthole video.
Oh yeah.

2155
01:58:56.531 --> 01:58:58.600
When you had a problem going to be called the Juke plan,

2156
01:58:58.601 --> 01:59:03.460
did you chlamydia your booty hole problem?
Um,
in the green?
Are they?

2157
01:59:03.461 --> 01:59:04.930
Yeah,
it's just an awesome,
they're cool.

2158
01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:06.700
They're one of the cities that that gets it.

2159
01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:09.220
They're smart enough to get it but cool enough to be laid back about it.

2160
01:59:09.340 --> 01:59:12.370
But so many fucked up in that club and painted over all the writing and the

2161
01:59:12.371 --> 01:59:15.670
green room asshole decided there was too much writing on the wall.

2162
01:59:15.790 --> 01:59:19.880
You had like two,
two 30 years of history that some,
it was fun.

2163
01:59:20.230 --> 01:59:22.750
It was awesome.
Any body,
some dummy.

2164
01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:24.730
There was people that were dead that wrote on that wall.

2165
01:59:24.731 --> 01:59:29.170
A lot of them including Hedberg.
Ah,
who do pay.
So silly bitch.

2166
01:59:29.230 --> 01:59:32.740
How dare you.
You fuck heads.
That was historic.

2167
01:59:32.770 --> 01:59:35.740
It's not a story cause they Atlanta punchline cause the Atlanta punchline has

2168
01:59:35.741 --> 01:59:38.740
that one thing he says quit trying to be Hicks.

2169
01:59:41.220 --> 01:59:43.360
You know if you're writing on a wall.
So I was going to write something shitty.

2170
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:48.880
So many dudes try to be Higgs hits as far as like influencing comedians.

2171
01:59:49.090 --> 01:59:53.210
Hicks influenced comedians the wrong way more than anybody.
Yeah.

2172
01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:56.410
Kaufman Kaufman was pretty bad.
Yeah.

2173
01:59:56.411 --> 02:00:00.670
But they did not likely to go on stage and like self righteous.

2174
02:00:01.150 --> 02:00:02.830
That's it.
To the crowd.
I didn't do that.

2175
02:00:02.831 --> 02:00:04.450
They didn't think they were better than you because they're trying some

2176
02:00:04.451 --> 02:00:06.550
experimental.
Yeah,
well not only that,

2177
02:00:06.551 --> 02:00:09.860
like some shit they just wrote in Popular Science magazine,
five minutes again,

2178
02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:13.090
they're yelling at the crowd that they don't know it because you're at home

2179
02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:15.280
watching fucking Roseanne

2180
02:00:18.130 --> 02:00:18.970
and then they always do that.

2181
02:00:18.971 --> 02:00:22.310
They always say that a lot of times they'll be like,
oh,
too edgy for you.
Nope.

2182
02:00:23.610 --> 02:00:27.400
No one laughed because it wasn't funny.
Just sucks.
Stupid.
Too Edgy for you.

2183
02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:31.840
How come you didn't fucking dummy jump it and Bob on stage eight times in a row

2184
02:00:31.841 --> 02:00:36.090
on purpose just for the sake of it.
Just get fucked.
Know this.

2185
02:00:36.100 --> 02:00:39.730
That's just as fake is like fake clean comedy.
Yeah,
exactly.

2186
02:00:39.731 --> 02:00:43.810
I have no thoughts about,
yeah,
it's just,
it's in part of it is,
you know,

2187
02:00:43.870 --> 02:00:46.990
sometimes people don't look at themselves that objectively,

2188
02:00:46.991 --> 02:00:50.560
so they don't know that what they're putting out there so stupidly offensively

2189
02:00:50.561 --> 02:00:54.860
dumb.
They don't know.
They didn't even know just to just clunk,

2190
02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:59.020
clunk,
clunk.
It's,
it's,

2191
02:00:59.500 --> 02:01:01.250
it's hard when you watch them and go on stage.
I,

2192
02:01:01.251 --> 02:01:05.140
I worked in Vegas with this guy once.
He was supposed to do like 20 minutes.

2193
02:01:05.290 --> 02:01:07.960
He did 45 45 minutes and it was the,

2194
02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:12.610
or some of the worst fucking comedy I have ever seen in my life.

2195
02:01:12.730 --> 02:01:16.060
It was so bad that by the time I got on stage,
I was like,
there's nothing funny.

2196
02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:19.560
There's nothing.
Nothing is funny.
Oh,
nothing.
Couldn't believe in fun.

2197
02:01:19.930 --> 02:01:23.140
It's like when we have together,
like we do gigs in the ice house,

2198
02:01:23.141 --> 02:01:27.070
especially like if we're on a board mood.
Yeah.
But,
but when we're doing that,

2199
02:01:27.071 --> 02:01:28.900
we're in a good mood.
We're shooting the shit,

2200
02:01:28.901 --> 02:01:31.270
and then we go on stage and you're like,
so many things are funny.
Yeah.

2201
02:01:31.271 --> 02:01:33.220
There's some of the best shows up.
There's funniness everywhere.

2202
02:01:33.790 --> 02:01:35.320
But if you're working with someone who sucks it,

2203
02:01:36.380 --> 02:01:38.860
it's like if you're at a job with someone who's a Douche bag,

2204
02:01:39.150 --> 02:01:40.070
it's difference between being

2205
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:42.910
<v 0>in a job and someone who's fun.
Like if you had to work with Joey Diaz all day,</v>

2206
02:01:42.911 --> 02:01:45.530
he'd be laughing.
I mean,
once a month he'd yell at you,

2207
02:01:45.590 --> 02:01:47.840
but you got to deal with that mostly.
Great.

2208
02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:50.270
He'll yell at me over like fucking nonsense.

2209
02:01:50.430 --> 02:01:51.800
There was the one day that he came in,

2210
02:01:51.801 --> 02:01:55.850
it was fucking screaming about ranch dressing,
fucking branch stretching.

2211
02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:58.880
Somebody gave him ranch.
Well it was just tying me to a tee shirt about,

2212
02:01:58.881 --> 02:02:01.570
he sold like a thousand fucking tee shirts.
It's a,

2213
02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:04.880
it's blue cheese with wings or go fuck your mother was this famous line.

2214
02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:07.850
He just gets so mad about blue cheese,

2215
02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:14.650
blue cheese please.
That kind of guy.
You know like that's the kind of,
you know,

2216
02:02:15.210 --> 02:02:16.760
to be able to hang out with people like that.

2217
02:02:16.761 --> 02:02:19.100
Like this is a lot of people that would never understand a guy like that.

2218
02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:21.930
But for a guy like us,
like a standup,
another standup comic,

2219
02:02:21.931 --> 02:02:25.790
cause like I talk about a buoy in the ocean.
Like it's like you,
you,

2220
02:02:25.791 --> 02:02:29.030
you're gravitated towards him to save.
You mentioned him at Ona.

2221
02:02:29.090 --> 02:02:31.820
I mentioned deals cause I was like,
yeah,
told me this thing wants,
they're like,

2222
02:02:31.870 --> 02:02:35.480
oh yeah,
junk.
How's that?
We haven't seen him in forever.
They're like,

2223
02:02:35.481 --> 02:02:39.740
he's so good at telling stories.
And I'm like,
yeah,
sure.
Fucking is.
He sure is.

2224
02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:40.940
He's an unusual Newman.

2225
02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:45.170
So important to to find those fucking people so hard.

2226
02:02:45.980 --> 02:02:47.990
It's one thing that I've developed a skill for.

2227
02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:51.350
I know how to wrangle people together and not to wrangle a bunch of cool people

2228
02:02:51.351 --> 02:02:54.890
together.
It's hard.
It's hard to find like cool,
interesting people.

2229
02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:59.630
It's hard to like a cream that I've got.
Yeah,
you got a cut all the cons out.

2230
02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:02.420
You got to cut them all out.
It's like pruning a tree.
It's hard.

2231
02:03:02.421 --> 02:03:04.010
The problem is it's hard with them concert,

2232
02:03:04.500 --> 02:03:08.750
like somehow related to the cool people who,
yeah,
that's probably like,
oh,

2233
02:03:08.751 --> 02:03:11.390
that's your best friend or brother or a mess.
And you're like,
oh,

2234
02:03:11.391 --> 02:03:14.810
so he comes with you,
but I don't want him.
I just want you.
And he's like snipey.

2235
02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:19.160
He says snipey Shit,
girlfriends,
shitty parents,
something like that.
Yeah.

2236
02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:21.050
And he was like,
I don't want to hang out with them at all.

2237
02:03:24.650 --> 02:03:29.000
You don't have to do their actual words.
Just there's a balance.
This world,
man,

2238
02:03:29.570 --> 02:03:34.070
people don't realize it.
Those,
those country people does it directly.

2239
02:03:34.110 --> 02:03:37.100
Their consciousness directly proportionate to how happy they just walk away from

2240
02:03:37.101 --> 02:03:41.450
it.
Now I treat them as like wild animals.
Like if there was a dark,
a barking dog,

2241
02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:44.400
I would cross the street before going in front of that yard.
It's just like,

2242
02:03:44.510 --> 02:03:47.660
I'm not going to dismiss them.
Oh,
what the fuck is this?

2243
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:49.070
Do you have any interests?

2244
02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:53.870
I bought a ticket for you of Louis Saint Louis C k doing new stuff tonight.

2245
02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:58.040
Um,
at the comedy store may room.
Ooh,
I might be into doing that.

2246
02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:03.010
I got to see it.
You're going to say we'll get off the podcast.
Okay.

2247
02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:06.930
It's at midnight when she made this like oh wow.
That's pretty lame.
Yeah.

2248
02:04:07.010 --> 02:04:09.350
Why is he doing a show at midnight?
Is doing an early show to Nope,

2249
02:04:09.351 --> 02:04:11.100
just to let you off doors up on 11.
Huh?

2250
02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:12.680
I think it was already showing there and he goes,

2251
02:04:12.681 --> 02:04:15.290
I don't want to blow up so it out late,
so fuck it.
Let's the two legs.

2252
02:04:15.330 --> 02:04:18.320
It's awesome.
New Jokes.
So it's,
it's so cool that he's doing that man.

2253
02:04:18.410 --> 02:04:19.950
And he said,
you can take a week,

2254
02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:24.980
only buy tickets live and I'm with cash so that nobody counterfeits anything.

2255
02:04:26.030 --> 02:04:26.630
Whoa.

2256
02:04:26.630 --> 02:04:30.140
So the door guys have this like stay there and like sell tickets like in the

2257
02:04:30.141 --> 02:04:32.330
cover book.
So nobody counterfeits anything.

2258
02:04:32.450 --> 02:04:36.180
How you guys deal with not counterfeiting?
Scalping.
Oh yeah.

2259
02:04:36.290 --> 02:04:37.440
He's had to deal with that a lot I guess.

2260
02:04:37.441 --> 02:04:39.050
So he's trying to overcome that with the tickets.

2261
02:04:39.051 --> 02:04:41.730
So you have to actually wait in line to buy the tickets?
No,

2262
02:04:41.731 --> 02:04:44.080
just walk up to the booth,
get them over.
That means you're,

2263
02:04:44.110 --> 02:04:46.550
I was going to be aligned.
It was no credit.

2264
02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:49.140
Put it online and there was no more than a 3% line.

2265
02:04:49.590 --> 02:04:51.570
They're just whipping people through.
Really?
Yeah.

2266
02:04:51.810 --> 02:04:54.750
And there's an ATM right on the corner right next to the main road is an ATM

2267
02:04:54.760 --> 02:04:58.800
there paying gold.
I don't know.
It's so weird.
It's like cash.
I was like,

2268
02:04:58.801 --> 02:05:03.330
do I have the cash on me?
I guess.
Sounds like he's going to get robbed.
Yeah.

2269
02:05:03.390 --> 02:05:05.340
What is someone's gangster and then that neighborhood,

2270
02:05:05.370 --> 02:05:09.510
they know there's a lot of cash now son.
You gave up the goods.

2271
02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:14.220
You notice that gangster has become a black guy or it used to be like a Italian.

2272
02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:17.640
Yeah,
gangster.
Yeah.
They took it.
They did another thing.

2273
02:05:17.641 --> 02:05:20.780
They've stolen things besides our wallets.
Whoa.
Alright.

2274
02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:25.680
That was like sounded too hard.
Well,
let's salt in me.

2275
02:05:25.890 --> 02:05:28.440
I did.
This guy wants something good,
but I didn't know the line.

2276
02:05:28.441 --> 02:05:30.180
We're talking about rookie mistakes and stuff,
right?

2277
02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:33.480
I didn't know the line of how you can like be mean,
but say it in a smile.

2278
02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:36.570
I learned a lot from watching don bears.
What do you call these grandmothers?

2279
02:05:36.571 --> 02:05:39.300
Like filthy whores.
But he'd do it with such a smile.

2280
02:05:39.330 --> 02:05:42.390
I don't know how we quite exudes this like I'm clearly joking.

2281
02:05:43.530 --> 02:05:44.790
These old ladies would love it.

2282
02:05:44.791 --> 02:05:47.880
They'd be howling in front of their granddaughter.
It was just great.

2283
02:05:47.881 --> 02:05:50.820
I could always see him do it.
Barris knows how to do it.
Yeah,
well,

2284
02:05:50.821 --> 02:05:53.810
I say experience performing and I would do it sometimes with black people,

2285
02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:55.650
like what's that black people,
but say it in a friendly enough way.

2286
02:05:55.651 --> 02:05:58.020
They was all cool.
I remember this one door guy one time,

2287
02:05:58.210 --> 02:06:02.160
saw this black lady in the front row and goes,
what's up you black bitch?

2288
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:06.900
Oh my God.
Well,
it cleared the room for the entire night for the next five hours.

2289
02:06:06.901 --> 02:06:10.530
Everybody was having weird sets.
Wow.
Yeah.
That can happen man.

2290
02:06:10.531 --> 02:06:13.230
When people can be like a little off cause it's something fucked up.

2291
02:06:13.231 --> 02:06:16.050
Someone says,
yeah.
So some guy came in one time with his girlfriend,

2292
02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:18.470
I was on stage at the store in middle of the show room.

2293
02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:21.450
It's fine to come in lair and uh,
I was like,
Hey,
what's up?
How are you?

2294
02:06:21.451 --> 02:06:24.630
Nice to see with your whore.
And I was like,
and the guy's like,

2295
02:06:24.631 --> 02:06:26.740
what the fuck's your problem?
And I had to like,
damn it,

2296
02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:28.140
now I'm stuck in this thing.
Yeah,

2297
02:06:28.141 --> 02:06:30.810
you're just trying to come up with something funny to say that you didn't get to

2298
02:06:30.970 --> 02:06:35.550
say it wrong.
It's sometimes they come out and you're like,
nope,
that wasn't it.

2299
02:06:35.551 --> 02:06:38.930
That didn't sound,
you know,
especially when you do like what you and I do,

2300
02:06:38.931 --> 02:06:41.610
which is like you go,
you go on stage,
he does a lot of fucking around.

2301
02:06:41.670 --> 02:06:44.490
There's a lot of ad libbing and that's how you come up with new material,

2302
02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:46.320
you know,
to get like the,

2303
02:06:46.321 --> 02:06:49.980
the bridges between subjects like sometimes are different every night,
you know,

2304
02:06:49.981 --> 02:06:53.530
and in doing keeps it loose and sound natural and conversational.
Yeah.

2305
02:06:53.550 --> 02:06:54.810
And sometimes in doing so,

2306
02:06:54.811 --> 02:06:57.410
you also create these like weird improvisational paths.

2307
02:06:57.411 --> 02:06:59.940
Will you go on some completely new angle?
You're like,
oh my God,

2308
02:07:00.090 --> 02:07:03.650
this is the new part to the bit,
this is important.
So yeah,
I,

2309
02:07:03.720 --> 02:07:06.480
it's important to me to be able to fuck around,
but sometimes,
you know,

2310
02:07:06.481 --> 02:07:10.290
especially when you,
you know,
if you have a new subject,

2311
02:07:10.291 --> 02:07:13.860
you're not exactly sure where you go and you just take a stupid kids and you're

2312
02:07:13.861 --> 02:07:17.460
like,
oh no,
like two minutes on a dark path.
And you're like,
oh,

2313
02:07:17.461 --> 02:07:19.910
there's a wolf around here to eat me a wolf,
a board.

2314
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:23.000
I'm on the crowd who just get fucking stuck.
They're

2315
02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:27.000
stuck in a shit topic.

2316
02:07:27.250 --> 02:07:30.000
You ever start a topic and then you're in the middle of it and you want to bail.

2317
02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:32.370
They're like,
no.
Yeah.
And you go,
God,
do I get out of this?

2318
02:07:32.460 --> 02:07:35.560
I told him that the laugh factory the day I do and one of their employees shows,

2319
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:38.620
uh,
I started down a path and I was like,
you know what guys?

2320
02:07:39.220 --> 02:07:42.470
I don't want to do that.
I this whole thing about this,
but I'm going to,

2321
02:07:42.580 --> 02:07:46.540
I'm going to talk about something else.
And I'm like,
all right.
Wow.
That's funny.

2322
02:07:47.230 --> 02:07:50.050
It was already getting laughs he was already doing to mine.
I was just like,
Nah,

2323
02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:54.910
that's funny.
Yeah.
I guess it all depends on your level of enthusiasm.

2324
02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:58.420
I got 12 minutes there and this is a seven minute bit,
so it's like,

2325
02:07:58.450 --> 02:08:01.390
do I want to commit this brooch percentage of this,
this time to this?

2326
02:08:01.420 --> 02:08:05.150
What made you decide to bail on it?
I wanted to work on something else.
Oh.

2327
02:08:05.260 --> 02:08:06.910
And there was like,
I could just do this right now,

2328
02:08:06.911 --> 02:08:09.410
but it'd be just me just doing it right,
right,
right,
right.

2329
02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:12.550
I need to work on this other thing.
You know?
It's pressure where it's like,

2330
02:08:12.850 --> 02:08:15.790
that's my plan.
I needed develop things,
you know?
Right.

2331
02:08:16.850 --> 02:08:18.740
<v 1>Yeah.
That's the,
that's the way to go,
man.</v>

2332
02:08:18.980 --> 02:08:21.950
Do you do spend a lot of time actually writing,
not actually writing.

2333
02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:24.830
All right over like notes,
little notes.

2334
02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:28.730
Get get in front of your computer and get high and just start writing and just

2335
02:08:28.731 --> 02:08:32.240
takes a while and don't try to write jokes.
So he was trying to write,

2336
02:08:32.270 --> 02:08:34.910
just write and just sometimes I write as stand up,

2337
02:08:34.911 --> 02:08:38.960
but sometimes I write as like if someone was reading a book but you,

2338
02:08:38.990 --> 02:08:43.020
there's things that come out and just start writing to start writing and then

2339
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:46.130
we'll see what happens.
Cause these things that come out when you're doing that,

2340
02:08:46.190 --> 02:08:49.000
when you're,
there's things that come out and you put yourself in a place,
right?

2341
02:08:49.100 --> 02:08:50.990
Will you caught it comes out everywhere it comes.

2342
02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:54.110
Like comic comedy will come out when you drive in your car,
you'll have an idea,

2343
02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:55.160
but you have to write it down.

2344
02:08:55.460 --> 02:08:58.220
But when you actually force yourself to sit down and think about things,

2345
02:08:58.221 --> 02:09:02.060
it's not always that it works.
We actually put the time in.
Yeah,

2346
02:09:02.061 --> 02:09:07.040
I got a new bit right now,
man,
that I am so fucking happy with.
Oh my God.

2347
02:09:07.041 --> 02:09:11.870
It's destroying and it's something that I wrote.
I wrote on a plane and I,
and it,

2348
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:13.040
it came to me.

2349
02:09:13.041 --> 02:09:17.390
It's one of the rare moments where it came to me with almost too much stuff.

2350
02:09:17.630 --> 02:09:21.050
There's too many punchlines.
It's just two killer cause it's too much.

2351
02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:24.910
It's is this subject that I am,
I'm really pissed off about.

2352
02:09:25.070 --> 02:09:29.540
And so it's like a 10 minute subject and I just have to keep remembering it

2353
02:09:29.541 --> 02:09:31.340
because it's brand new.
But it's like,

2354
02:09:31.370 --> 02:09:35.930
and there's this one boom and then this one.
Wow.
It's like I've got this new,

2355
02:09:35.931 --> 02:09:38.780
which to me is even more fun because you're excited about it.

2356
02:09:38.781 --> 02:09:39.391
That's why they killed him.

2357
02:09:39.391 --> 02:09:42.640
Oh it's cause like I really feel great but there's no acting in me at all.

2358
02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:47.420
It's all pure emotion.
It's pure emotion and the,
it's,
it's,
it's right.

2359
02:09:47.450 --> 02:09:49.850
It's on something,
something that's got something to it.

2360
02:09:49.890 --> 02:09:52.730
Some instead of clear to me a little bit was when Tom was telling me about

2361
02:09:52.731 --> 02:09:53.170
something,

2362
02:09:53.170 --> 02:09:56.050
<v 0>Bill Byrd told them about writing new material.
Right.
And he was like,</v>

2363
02:09:56.051 --> 02:09:58.360
how do you write that long?
And he broke it down to like five minutes a month,

2364
02:09:58.460 --> 02:10:01.090
which always embarrassed as everybody.
Yeah.
Um,
but then he's like,

2365
02:10:01.091 --> 02:10:02.970
where do you come up with?
It goes,
I don't know.
Stuff like,

2366
02:10:02.980 --> 02:10:05.350
what do you care about?
And you're like,
yeah,
that's it.

2367
02:10:05.770 --> 02:10:08.440
Just what do you care about?
That's all it is.
What's on your mind?

2368
02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:12.520
What's going on?
Traffic?
What's,
what's,
what's,
what do you care about lately?
Yeah.

2369
02:10:12.970 --> 02:10:14.280
The fucking line.
This place

2370
02:10:14.290 --> 02:10:18.210
<v 1>or the bad foods you're supposed to eat or not supposed to eat or just whatever.</v>

2371
02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:22.460
Right.
And you gotta be paying enough attention to attention.
Yeah.

2372
02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:23.670
And that's what's interesting.

2373
02:10:23.671 --> 02:10:27.090
What's interesting is always where if it could just be about the way your sheets

2374
02:10:27.091 --> 02:10:30.350
bunch up on you,
if that's what really makes you angry or happy or whatever,

2375
02:10:30.380 --> 02:10:33.320
then that's what you care about it.
That's okay.
Maybe the song.
Yeah.

2376
02:10:33.321 --> 02:10:34.010
You'd have to be really

2377
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:36.120
<v 2>interesting.
I don't want to be really good.
Those sheets,</v>

2378
02:10:36.380 --> 02:10:38.270
I would way rather hear about competence like Jim Gaffigan,

2379
02:10:38.271 --> 02:10:39.320
we can make bacon funny.

2380
02:10:39.380 --> 02:10:43.400
That's true for like Jim Gaffigan could make sheets funny too.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2381
02:10:43.401 --> 02:10:47.720
No for him,
it's just not for me or for you.
Right.
It wouldn't work,
but yeah.
Yeah.

2382
02:10:47.740 --> 02:10:49.130
It's,
it's what's what,
you know,

2383
02:10:49.131 --> 02:10:51.380
and that's what defines you is makes you interesting or not.

2384
02:10:51.381 --> 02:10:53.840
And it's like what kind of things are used to things that are on my mind.

2385
02:10:54.050 --> 02:10:57.080
That's what I'm talking about.
Standup comedy.
Ari Shaffir,

2386
02:10:57.081 --> 02:11:00.130
Cap City Comedy Club does September what,
what other days?

2387
02:11:00.450 --> 02:11:05.150
It's the 12th through the 15th keep it together,
mother fuckers.

2388
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:08.600
Man.
It's a dark road out there,
ladies and gentlemen,
but we're all on it.

2389
02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:10.490
It's not even dark.
It's actually pretty awesome.

2390
02:11:10.850 --> 02:11:15.140
If you lived in the Annapolis Christi Dallas and somebody who can transport you

2391
02:11:15.141 --> 02:11:18.710
to today and living in a fucking dream.
Oh yeah.
Be totally different.
Right.

2392
02:11:18.730 --> 02:11:21.650
Ice Patches.
Madison,
how about just penicillin?

2393
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:24.770
How about when you have sex with dirty prostitute?
You don't die.

2394
02:11:24.890 --> 02:11:28.100
Wouldn't that be sweet?
That'd be sweet if he just didn't die.
Yeah.

2395
02:11:28.130 --> 02:11:31.770
One day we'll have like you'll catch like gonorrhea and instead of having Chad

2396
02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:33.330
that thing and you just go whatever it,

2397
02:11:33.331 --> 02:11:37.580
I'm just gonna read that they raped the wand over you like star Trek,

2398
02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:40.010
you'll do it.
It'll be an APP on your cell phone.
You stick your,

2399
02:11:40.011 --> 02:11:44.420
your cell phone near deck and an accurate,
it'll zap it.
It's ridiculous.

2400
02:11:44.421 --> 02:11:49.070
We live in the best fucking time ever and everyone's depressed.
Why?

2401
02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:51.590
Because look at our future.
It's fucking Mitt Romney guy.

2402
02:11:51.591 --> 02:11:53.090
He's going to win two white people were angry.

2403
02:11:53.130 --> 02:11:54.980
You think their mom's going to win?
That's fucking,

2404
02:11:54.981 --> 02:11:58.090
that's how the place supposed to play out.
It doesn't matter.
Corporations,

2405
02:11:58.100 --> 02:11:59.600
when no matter who is in place,

2406
02:11:59.601 --> 02:12:03.560
and that's the only reason why gold ridiculous corporations are winning and what

2407
02:12:03.561 --> 02:12:04.191
really matters,

2408
02:12:04.191 --> 02:12:08.200
man is state and local elections and your friends and people you care about us

2409
02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:10.200
and what you do for a living.
You dirty bitch,

2410
02:12:10.240 --> 02:12:12.980
enjoy yourselves because you're not going to make a big difference in the

2411
02:12:12.981 --> 02:12:15.490
fucking way.
Even if he this,
this still just a person,
you,

2412
02:12:15.690 --> 02:12:17.750
you just want to do it and you'll be dead and gone forever,

2413
02:12:17.751 --> 02:12:18.860
so enjoy it while you're here.

2414
02:12:18.890 --> 02:12:23.420
The only way we can make a difference is talking about shit and having a new

2415
02:12:23.421 --> 02:12:26.780
generation of people who don't grow up to become the concept of the people that

2416
02:12:26.781 --> 02:12:29.120
are running this country are.
That's the only way.
It's the only way.

2417
02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:30.770
So by this conversation,

2418
02:12:30.771 --> 02:12:35.750
by this podcast alone influenced the youth or should fear and set them in a good

2419
02:12:35.751 --> 02:12:38.450
direction.
But you also didn't relate to on Yom Kippur.

2420
02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:41.090
Please get my album a revenge for the Holocaust.

2421
02:12:41.860 --> 02:12:43.760
What a perfect time to launch a comedy out,

2422
02:12:43.761 --> 02:12:47.990
but with you as a spider with us started David Juice,

2423
02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:50.200
firefighting Hitler and a,

2424
02:12:50.210 --> 02:12:54.150
that's going to be available on iTunes and already the great.com is his website.

2425
02:12:54.151 --> 02:12:56.670
Seal your website or ours?
The great.com they're both,
they're the same.
Sorry,

2426
02:12:56.671 --> 02:12:59.240
I should go to the same thing.
Yeah,
I like already the great though.
It's cool.

2427
02:12:59.770 --> 02:13:04.700
Also,
I'm sending you for Mp3s,
me,
anybody who goes to my website.

2428
02:13:04.780 --> 02:13:05.540
Oh,
there you go.
Awesome.

2429
02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:08.990
Well go to [inaudible] website are the great.com and get yourself some fucking

2430
02:13:08.991 --> 02:13:12.200
mp3s.
It's some solid Goddamn standup comedy for one of the best the country.

2431
02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:17.270
I've seen him develop from a goddamn hat to a real professional father that got

2432
02:13:17.271 --> 02:13:19.030
along.
No,
no,
I'm happy as a friend though.

2433
02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:21.440
I think it's awesome as far as I asked my rabbis about this.

2434
02:13:21.450 --> 02:13:24.680
Like when you come to Israel and then the people start to get more religious

2435
02:13:24.681 --> 02:13:27.850
than you feel like you've accomplished something and he's like,
yeah,
you,

2436
02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:32.490
he's like,
you help build something.
Well,
I definitely,
I'm happy when I'm around,

2437
02:13:32.530 --> 02:13:35.510
uh,
comedians and I give him advice and they get better,
but they don't,

2438
02:13:35.511 --> 02:13:36.780
and not everybody listens.
You,

2439
02:13:36.810 --> 02:13:39.360
you listen better than anybody that ever took on the road with me.

2440
02:13:39.630 --> 02:13:42.420
If I would tell you,
I'm like,
you got too many words in that man,
you would like,

2441
02:13:42.421 --> 02:13:43.230
you're right.
Fuck.

2442
02:13:43.230 --> 02:13:47.510
And you would just go sharpen it up and think about it and Redo things.
You know,

2443
02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:51.240
people have told me things that I didn't want to hear and some of them I fought

2444
02:13:51.241 --> 02:13:53.760
and some of them I listened to.
Some of them were uncomfortable,

2445
02:13:54.180 --> 02:13:58.410
but ultimately people especially in the beginning can like point things out to

2446
02:13:58.411 --> 02:14:01.140
you.
It's up to you whether or not you can see them and listen.

2447
02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:06.030
Looking down the whole time Mark Madison told me that I used to do that to look

2448
02:14:06.031 --> 02:14:08.070
up.
You're talking to the crowd.
I was like,
Oh yeah.
It helps.

2449
02:14:08.110 --> 02:14:10.200
Just little things like maybe you're right instead of fuck you.

2450
02:14:10.201 --> 02:14:11.250
You don't know what they're talking about.

2451
02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:14.190
I looked down way too much for a long time.
I did it for years.

2452
02:14:14.470 --> 02:14:17.920
Think what if it's not good or bad that you'd do that?
Yeah,
that this,

2453
02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.910
that you were wrong in the past.
What if it's just you can improve?
Yeah,

2454
02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:22.170
just do it like that.

2455
02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:25.650
But you were really good at listening and you were really good at changing to

2456
02:14:25.730 --> 02:14:27.460
taking chances.
You know?
That's why you're,

2457
02:14:27.461 --> 02:14:30.060
you're still producing like constant new material.
This.

2458
02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:33.120
If there's anything that always bugs us about someone that we know.

2459
02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:37.470
It's a guy who's got the same jokes for 10 years on sad.
It's like,
man,

2460
02:14:37.471 --> 02:14:40.380
you don't have anything new to say.
You got to have some new shit,
man.
He's good.

2461
02:14:40.381 --> 02:14:43.710
I've heard that to have some new shit.
You know a case.

2462
02:14:43.711 --> 02:14:46.760
That's the reason I shaved my beard is cause dice was the last straw because I

2463
02:14:46.780 --> 02:14:49.020
shave your beard.
I was like,
why is like for your act?
And I was like,
whoa.

2464
02:14:49.650 --> 02:14:52.190
And then it was like instead of like you're a doofus dice like he always is.

2465
02:14:52.191 --> 02:14:54.120
Right.
I was like,
if Andrew dice clay,

2466
02:14:54.630 --> 02:14:57.480
the legend of Andrew dice clay is telling me this is good for my act,
I'm like,

2467
02:14:57.481 --> 02:14:59.220
hey,
why?
And he goes,

2468
02:14:59.221 --> 02:15:02.430
you're expressive and people can see their expressions and I was like,

2469
02:15:02.670 --> 02:15:06.280
it doesn't make sense,
but I want to stop that you looked like a crazy dirt bag.

2470
02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:10.530
Crazy beard.
And I think that might be worth,
that might be worth more.

2471
02:15:10.531 --> 02:15:13.440
I see my expression,
the whole beard moves.
Yeah.
I don't think of dice.

2472
02:15:13.650 --> 02:15:16.890
I don't think dice gets that.
I wanted to get rid of dirt bag.
Look,

2473
02:15:17.430 --> 02:15:20.360
definitely look younger.
Isn't it weird you look younger though?

2474
02:15:20.370 --> 02:15:22.260
Everybody always says that when you shave your beard,
you look younger,

2475
02:15:22.261 --> 02:15:26.250
but you really do,
for whatever reasons,
more innocent babies are crying.

2476
02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:31.690
Shit's going on.
All Right Ladies and gentlemen,
tomorrow we will uh,

2477
02:15:31.830 --> 02:15:35.460
join freeway,
Ricky Ross,
the real Rick Ross.

2478
02:15:35.790 --> 02:15:38.730
He's joining us again on the podcast.
Tell us a little bit,

2479
02:15:38.731 --> 02:15:42.240
and that's the fake Rick Ross.
Yeah.
You've got the real one.

2480
02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:43.110
We've got the real one.

2481
02:15:43.110 --> 02:15:46.980
The Guy who this guy pretended is pretends to be the guy who went to jail for

2482
02:15:46.981 --> 02:15:47.814
selling cocaine,

2483
02:15:49.050 --> 02:15:53.380
cocaine sales funded the conscious versus the Sandinistas Nicaragua.

2484
02:15:54.160 --> 02:15:57.720
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's how the day,
that's a whole Ollie north thing.

2485
02:15:57.750 --> 02:16:01.410
They were funneling,
they were selling drugs and they raised money for it.

2486
02:16:01.770 --> 02:16:05.160
Like having a bake sale with coke,
with coke.
And they would,

2487
02:16:05.161 --> 02:16:08.880
so they would get the coke,
Bravo America.
Two ways to think outside the box,

2488
02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:14.110
get the coke to the poor communities.
Wow.
And,
uh,
and everybody,
when

2489
02:16:16.850 --> 02:16:18.350
we all go dense,

2490
02:16:18.351 --> 02:16:21.840
and so this guy got out of jail and there's a rapper that's got his name.

2491
02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:24.840
I mean his,
his name is Rick Ross,
and he was freeway Rick Ross.

2492
02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:26.730
He was known as being this huge,
I mean,

2493
02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:29.200
I remember I asking me to killed anybody ever know.

2494
02:16:29.340 --> 02:16:30.730
He never got that disrespectful.

2495
02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:34.510
<v 0>Okay.
I wouldn't do that.
But the guy has been in the,
you know,</v>

2496
02:16:34.511 --> 02:16:39.460
he was in the drug trade for years,
got all over the news.

2497
02:16:39.461 --> 02:16:40.690
I mean it was like a big deal.

2498
02:16:40.691 --> 02:16:44.740
It's like one of those things like when rappers call themselves Capone Capone,

2499
02:16:44.930 --> 02:16:47.350
is he the one that was on Time magazine with like drugs?

2500
02:16:47.500 --> 02:16:49.150
I don't think holding them up,
but that's when the government,

2501
02:16:49.151 --> 02:16:53.350
they'd go back to that guy.
I don't think so.
No,
I don't think that's the case.
Um,

2502
02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:57.190
he was,
uh,
he was trying to stay like as low key as possible now,

2503
02:16:57.370 --> 02:17:01.180
but he got busted.
But,
uh,
the story is just insane.

2504
02:17:01.430 --> 02:17:05.530
He's kind of wrapper that's,
he's out.
He's out in free and this rapper out there,

2505
02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:08.640
his name.
Yeah.
And so he's like trying to sue them.
Just the same name,
like no,

2506
02:17:08.710 --> 02:17:12.040
here's my personality.
Or taking,
yeah.
Well they're not only was even crazier,

2507
02:17:12.070 --> 02:17:16.330
the rapper or used to be a corrections officer.
Oh really?

2508
02:17:17.260 --> 02:17:20.890
He was a prison guard,
which is really nutty.
Wow.
Yeah.

2509
02:17:20.891 --> 02:17:22.880
It's the whole thing is carets it's building.

2510
02:17:22.881 --> 02:17:24.910
His album was like the greatest thing of all time.

2511
02:17:24.940 --> 02:17:27.220
He's on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine.
Look around right there.

2512
02:17:27.221 --> 02:17:29.750
Right behind you.
Look at that rolling stone.
You see that rolling stone?

2513
02:17:30.100 --> 02:17:30.611
That's him.

2514
02:17:30.611 --> 02:17:35.380
Then I bought that rolling stone just for the real Rick Ross cause to talk about

2515
02:17:35.381 --> 02:17:39.010
it.
He's got it.
He's got tattoos of Abraham Lincoln from the dollar bill.

2516
02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:41.770
You have a five and George Bush.
George is blocking him from the one.
Yeah.

2517
02:17:41.771 --> 02:17:45.190
That's a new thing that black dudes are doing.
Is it covering their whole bodies?

2518
02:17:45.910 --> 02:17:49.930
I agree.
Black dudes look better and tats,
but this is a weird goes with the skin.

2519
02:17:49.930 --> 02:17:52.130
Better rapper thing.
When they cover everything and they go,

2520
02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:53.730
they covered their face and they kind of,

2521
02:17:53.731 --> 02:17:57.610
there is the back of his poem all tatted up.
It's got a weed leaf on it,

2522
02:17:57.611 --> 02:18:02.030
but that didn't exist before,
isn't it?
You go back to like the superfly days,

2523
02:18:02.050 --> 02:18:05.590
they have to keep outdoing each other.
I did a joke that never was able to work,

2524
02:18:05.591 --> 02:18:09.310
but it's like every fucking granted mother has a tattoo now.
It's not a big deal.

2525
02:18:09.311 --> 02:18:11.860
So now we're going to have to do is go to the next stage,
which is what?

2526
02:18:11.861 --> 02:18:14.230
The ear things.
You know that your thing,
they push out.
Yeah.

2527
02:18:14.260 --> 02:18:16.600
And so then that's going to become blood today and then we're gonna have to do

2528
02:18:16.601 --> 02:18:18.560
the plates that the African people hadn't had x.

2529
02:18:19.090 --> 02:18:21.200
We're going to see that in our lifetime,
so we're going to have a place.

2530
02:18:21.300 --> 02:18:25.220
So like especially famous dudes to doing a lot of face tattoos.
Yeah.

2531
02:18:25.530 --> 02:18:29.470
A lot of like stars and shit and like I like it.
It's like fuck it.

2532
02:18:29.500 --> 02:18:32.680
I'm not going to have a regular job.
When do got an ice cream cone on his face.

2533
02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:37.060
I remember that.
Who's that guy?
Some rapper.
Yeah.
It's not a white thing.
No.

2534
02:18:37.780 --> 02:18:39.990
Well you could,
you could.
You know you'd be,

2535
02:18:40.110 --> 02:18:43.930
there was a guy or a bodybuilder that I saw at the airport that had a whole face

2536
02:18:43.931 --> 02:18:48.870
tattoo.
He got a Tyson thing,
one of those New Zealand Tyson Tattoo things.

2537
02:18:48.890 --> 02:18:51.130
The grief that you're great joke about it.
It was like,

2538
02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:52.660
if you're going to face that too,

2539
02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:56.740
because you want no interaction with any other human forever or something along

2540
02:18:56.741 --> 02:18:59.560
those lines.
Something along those lines.
Yeah.
It's obvious.

2541
02:18:59.561 --> 02:19:03.520
You want to scare everyone.
You come in contact,
you know?

2542
02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:05.800
Yeah.
It's in a weird,
we like,

2543
02:19:05.830 --> 02:19:08.680
we have certain spots in our body that means certain things.

2544
02:19:08.830 --> 02:19:12.310
If you start tattooing your face,
we've all agreed.
No,
no,

2545
02:19:12.670 --> 02:19:17.350
you get nutty son.
But over here on the wrist,
that's okay.
Oh,
that's nothing.

2546
02:19:17.380 --> 02:19:21.070
That's cute.
The ankle.
It's sweet.
You know the,

2547
02:19:21.071 --> 02:19:25.270
the chain link around the BICEP.
Yeah,
that one.

2548
02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:28.060
You can't get these rooms.
We

2549
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:32.880

Check my website for all of when you leave and when he leaving for the road.

2555
02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:51.320
I've got a wedding this weekend,

2556
02:19:51.321 --> 02:19:54.890
but then the next one is the 12th or the 14th [inaudible] you gone like weeks at

2557
02:19:54.891 --> 02:19:57.210
a time.
Where are you going to do that thing?
Are you going to do it and why?

2558
02:19:57.590 --> 02:20:01.160
I'm doing,
I'm Toronto and then straight to Indianapolis.
That's a 10 day run,

2559
02:20:01.161 --> 02:20:04.190
but the rest of them are all back seats come in right before Toronto.

2560
02:20:04.191 --> 02:20:06.640
Maybe we can,
are you going to be here at at all?
Yeah,
right.

2561
02:20:06.650 --> 02:20:08.960
Unfortunately Toronto days,
three days before that.
So let's do that.

2562
02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:11.420
Let's do another one.
Let's do another podcast because that's right before.

2563
02:20:11.421 --> 02:20:14.820
And by the way,
that's the,
I'll have my studio up and running by then.
Okay.

2564
02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:18.080
At least the beginnings of it.
I,
you know any inputs you got on Twitter?

2565
02:20:18.140 --> 02:20:20.630
Anybody knows anybody who knows anything about building a studio.

2566
02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:24.980
Cause I got a dope ass office space now.
Nice.
Oh,

2567
02:20:25.470 --> 02:20:28.060
it's going to be killer dude.
Maybe that Tuesday after,
after this,

2568
02:20:28.130 --> 02:20:30.160
after punchdrunk.
I can't wait to have like a,

2569
02:20:30.170 --> 02:20:32.480
it's going to be like a raven night social clubs sort of a thing.

2570
02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:34.310
What I'm saying?
What do you mean?
Like just the way he said it.

2571
02:20:34.311 --> 02:20:37.540
Like have loungy places and have beers.
That'll Fred table there.

2572
02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:41.330
I'm a full table,
their couch,
big screen TV.

2573
02:20:41.480 --> 02:20:46.480
I'm going to have it a real cool spot and then I'm going to have the studio like

2574
02:20:46.500 --> 02:20:49.940
were where everybody sits down as comfortable as possible.

2575
02:20:49.940 --> 02:20:51.140
I think we figured it out now.

2576
02:20:51.440 --> 02:20:55.820
I think in doing the Ice House studio and doing this studio and you know doing

2577
02:20:55.821 --> 02:21:00.000
like Dunkin set up and doing my old set up,
we know what you need.
Yeah.

2578
02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:02.780
It's like the way that it brought Todd glass and to tell them how to build

2579
02:21:02.781 --> 02:21:06.770
helium or different clubs.
It's like,
no,
I know what's necessary.
Please trust me.

2580
02:21:06.980 --> 02:21:10.030
I've been through it so I waited till yeah,

2581
02:21:10.050 --> 02:21:14.060
comfort you and you can't have like loungey chairs.
You've got to have officers.

2582
02:21:15.020 --> 02:21:17.930
These are the kinds of chairs and these,
these microphones are real good,

2583
02:21:17.931 --> 02:21:20.600
but the better ones are.
There's a,
there's other ones that I've got here.

2584
02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:22.910
Just fucking,
you know,
this is a little weird.

2585
02:21:23.750 --> 02:21:26.700
It's tough cause its shores or like less directional.
This is a,

2586
02:21:26.701 --> 02:21:28.310
this has too much of a sweet spot.

2587
02:21:28.430 --> 02:21:32.020
And then there's another one that's don imus uses this thing.
I here,

2588
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:34.490
it's a built in sound good.

2589
02:21:34.491 --> 02:21:37.760
I'm gonna try these names and these are the ones that we have the ice house but

2590
02:21:37.761 --> 02:21:41.540
I'm also going to try,
um,
there's ones that I saw on the dawn I,
my show,

2591
02:21:41.541 --> 02:21:42.470
I forget the names of them,

2592
02:21:42.650 --> 02:21:45.950
but they are the supposed to be the best for that kind of shit for radio.

2593
02:21:46.310 --> 02:21:48.260
And you don't have to put a windscreen over.
I'm,

2594
02:21:48.261 --> 02:21:50.420
and maybe you get a clearer sound.

2595
02:21:50.570 --> 02:21:52.550
Some people don't like the windscreen because it's like,

2596
02:21:52.551 --> 02:21:55.400
it gives you a little bit of a filter at sac.
We sounded like Kevin Smith,

2597
02:21:55.610 --> 02:21:58.940
he takes the,
the windscreen when he came over.
He doesn't get that though.
No,

2598
02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:00.650
he knows how to do it.
He knows how to manage it,

2599
02:22:00.651 --> 02:22:03.860
but it just feels like it's really him that way.
Otherwise,
this is like a muted,

2600
02:22:03.890 --> 02:22:07.100
I don't like the headphones sometimes.
Why is that one?
That hurt my ears,

2601
02:22:07.101 --> 02:22:11.390
but I have my glasses on.
So do you hear a difference between this and this?

2602
02:22:11.420 --> 02:22:13.950
Is there a difference?
Yeah,
there's a total difference.
Yeah,

2603
02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.520
that sounds better actually.
It sounds clear.
God dammit.

2604
02:22:16.530 --> 02:22:18.460
These fucking stupid condoms.
You know,

2605
02:22:18.490 --> 02:22:21.110
you've got these Pete Piper pots of pipe or whatever.

2606
02:22:21.120 --> 02:22:24.370
Say something like that with a lot of p's or teasing it.
Peter Piper.

2607
02:22:24.371 --> 02:22:25.204
Impact of pickled.

2608
02:22:26.080 --> 02:22:27.980
<v 0>It sounds better.
It's a little bit hot,
but not mine.</v>

2609
02:22:28.020 --> 02:22:31.110
It sounds like a real person,
right?
Yeah.
The MIC is on stage.

2610
02:22:31.111 --> 02:22:34.100
I don't have windscreens.
Sometimes they do on top of any rights,

2611
02:22:34.110 --> 02:22:38.360
but those aren't good.
Yeah,
this sucks.
It's wearing my windscreens up.

2612
02:22:38.370 --> 02:22:39.920
Maybe I'll try it with Erin told you to get something.

2613
02:22:39.930 --> 02:22:43.260
He probably told you get to the second best thing though.
We held,
held back,

2614
02:22:43.261 --> 02:22:46.650
whatever the first best thing now.
He was very,
very nice about it.

2615
02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:51.810
I want no fire to this.
He was very forthcoming.
Now I saw some,

2616
02:22:51.811 --> 02:22:56.200
I saw him,
I gave him a hug in Burt's on last night at the UCB and Burt said,

2617
02:22:56.210 --> 02:23:00.060
it goes,
if Mark Marin is the nicest person there,
something's wrong.

2618
02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:03.660
There's an attitude going on.
Yeah.
Everybody says that about the UCB.

2619
02:23:04.110 --> 02:23:06.630
I don't go there.
I don't know how much perceived that haven't been there before,

2620
02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:11.220
but I remember reading like,
um,
something somewhere where it was like a forum,

2621
02:23:11.250 --> 02:23:14.250
like a forum blog or something like that,
or forum posts were seeing.
I said,

2622
02:23:14.251 --> 02:23:16.950
why is Joe Rogan at the UCB?
It was like,
Hey,
when you do that once,

2623
02:23:17.250 --> 02:23:20.370
what is it that's so weird?
Like what was Matt put it together.

2624
02:23:20.371 --> 02:23:22.430
It was just like a good show.
That's not what I mean.
I mean,
it's,
it's,

2625
02:23:22.490 --> 02:23:24.330
it's so weird.
There's a type,

2626
02:23:24.390 --> 02:23:27.340
when they know about this type goes here and that's how it goes there and be

2627
02:23:27.341 --> 02:23:30.900
like,
dude,
there's a lot of overlap already.
Stevens is everywhere.
It's so silly.

2628
02:23:31.070 --> 02:23:35.480
It's so silly,
you know?
Yeah.
I think people are surprised.

2629
02:23:35.530 --> 02:23:38.070
Edward's really broken down to me.
Yeah.
I met him.

2630
02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:42.390
I was opening for Pauli do without doing that sketch movie that hurts you.

2631
02:23:42.950 --> 02:23:47.760
Yeah.
Take the condom off after you feel to feel dirty.
That uh,
that um,

2632
02:23:47.820 --> 02:23:52.200
comics natural born calm,
whatever the video was.
Let's hear the condom off.
Yeah.

2633
02:23:52.620 --> 02:23:55.890
And um,
oh that's better.
And you could see where you have to talk into too.

2634
02:23:56.100 --> 02:23:56.933
Fuck these.

2635
02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:00.090
But I saw him and he did the Orlando Improv and the Miami Improv mainstream

2636
02:24:00.091 --> 02:24:02.010
clubs and he was very funny.
Those clubs.

2637
02:24:02.190 --> 02:24:04.590
And then I heard it's going to the UCB on their big alternative night.

2638
02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:06.960
And I was like really performing.
They are,
cause I do it all the time.

2639
02:24:06.990 --> 02:24:09.180
I didn't know where you come from New York,
right.
Been there forever.

2640
02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:10.340
And I'm like,
well what,

2641
02:24:10.340 --> 02:24:12.090
what kind of material do you do it in front of the people?

2642
02:24:12.630 --> 02:24:17.160
And he stopped and he goes,
dude,
crowds is crowds.
It's true.
They don't care.

2643
02:24:18.060 --> 02:24:21.090
And I was like,
whoa.
But you know what?
A lot of people,

2644
02:24:21.091 --> 02:24:25.860
they do get a little elitist if they put them online and stuff.

2645
02:24:25.950 --> 02:24:28.890
Yeah.
But there's also crowd don't know if they figure,
if you're there,

2646
02:24:28.891 --> 02:24:30.810
you're supposed to be there.
And then we're like,
cool,
we'll laugh.

2647
02:24:31.350 --> 02:24:33.540
They don't really give a shit.
Yeah.

2648
02:24:33.541 --> 02:24:36.390
I don't know why anybody would restrict themselves to one time of comedy.

2649
02:24:36.391 --> 02:24:39.780
You know,
I've always been,
um,
a a fan.
I mean,

2650
02:24:39.781 --> 02:24:44.220
I think anybody who knows this podcast knows that I'm a fan of some pretty crazy

2651
02:24:44.221 --> 02:24:48.900
science and extraordinary ideas when it comes to quantum physics and the nature

2652
02:24:48.901 --> 02:24:52.530
of the universe and nature reality.
I like a lot of like pretty heady,

2653
02:24:52.531 --> 02:24:56.940
twisted up deep shit about just the very nature of matter itself.

2654
02:24:57.300 --> 02:25:02.010
But I love stupid comedy.
Yeah,
it's fun.
Yeah,
sure.
It's fun.

2655
02:25:02.340 --> 02:25:05.700
My first,
uh,
Mc week for this guy,
Brett leak.
Do you remember him?

2656
02:25:05.940 --> 02:25:09.510
Apparently I remember the [inaudible] muscular dystrophy and then it got like

2657
02:25:09.511 --> 02:25:13.360
worse and worse.
And he was a killer observational comic.
Oh really?
Oh,

2658
02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:14.550
probably 10,
15 times.

2659
02:25:14.910 --> 02:25:19.020
But he said it was him and then some lady who the relationship comedy in the

2660
02:25:19.021 --> 02:25:23.350
middle and then me being filthy,
I'm,
and he goes,
I like a different kind show.

2661
02:25:23.530 --> 02:25:26.140
Yeah.
So the DC Improv and he goes,
I like three different people's.

2662
02:25:26.141 --> 02:25:29.200
Nobody overlaps.
Yeah,
I agree,
man.
I,
I'm not,

2663
02:25:29.201 --> 02:25:32.500
I'm not into the same kind of comedy all the time.
I like a Mitch Hedberg.

2664
02:25:32.501 --> 02:25:36.580
It was like Wiki clean,
and then I'm like,
yeah,
I guess it was.

2665
02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:40.690
And then I like Joey Diaz talking about clean and I like Joey Diaz talking about

2666
02:25:40.691 --> 02:25:44.500
pinching a foil out of some girl.
That asshole he's bagging or the acid,

2667
02:25:44.501 --> 02:25:48.130
he felt foil at the tip of his dick foil.
So you reached him with his fingers,

2668
02:25:48.131 --> 02:25:50.680
pull it out,
put a desk.
He put his dick back here.

2669
02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:55.630
She's still craziest motherfucker of all time.
Every time I'm with him,

2670
02:25:55.631 --> 02:25:58.600
I just have this big smile.
Like I can't believe this guy is my friend.
He gets,

2671
02:25:58.601 --> 02:26:01.380
you're going,
oh,
this is what Burt said.
He was meeting him for coffee.
Right.

2672
02:26:01.540 --> 02:26:04.000
And he goes,
other people come up,
he takes,
he goes,

2673
02:26:04.060 --> 02:26:07.690
I think he just sits there all day long and like has people come meet him and

2674
02:26:07.691 --> 02:26:08.411
just throughout the day,

2675
02:26:08.411 --> 02:26:11.920
just sit in like an old Italian guy who was drinking coffee.
Bert Kreischer met.

2676
02:26:11.921 --> 02:26:16.600
Who?
Joey Diaz.
Oh,
where in the valley?
Somewhere for fucking knowhow.
Oh,

2677
02:26:16.601 --> 02:26:19.060
that's hilarious.
You know Joe,
he can't sit still for very long.

2678
02:26:19.061 --> 02:26:21.510
He's got shit to do.
Maybe he might've done it for him.

2679
02:26:21.511 --> 02:26:24.790
He takes his phone calls and he fucking not tax.
He didn't text me.
He calls he,

2680
02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:27.010
what'd you doing?
Okay.
The one minute phone calls.
He's a king of,

2681
02:26:27.011 --> 02:26:29.560
he's a legit businessman though,
that you got to think about that now.

2682
02:26:29.561 --> 02:26:32.900
Joey's guy like real money.
He's doing great on the road.
Chummy.

2683
02:26:32.910 --> 02:26:34.510
Joanie is killing them on the road.

2684
02:26:34.820 --> 02:26:38.520
And he convinced me to put my last storyteller show on online.
Yeah,
no,
it goes,

2685
02:26:38.530 --> 02:26:42.700
just put it just $2.
Throw it off.
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.
Or you know,

2686
02:26:42.701 --> 02:26:45.760
seeing him get to number one on iTunes was fucking incredible.

2687
02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:50.770
He sold like 35 40,000 copies of that CD.
Just from self.
Yeah.

2688
02:26:50.800 --> 02:26:53.240
And by the way,
selling these testicle testaments,
he's still,

2689
02:26:53.370 --> 02:26:55.900
he's got other things on our tone where the chart fucking fantastic.

2690
02:26:56.080 --> 02:26:59.770
He doesn't know hour and a half to two hours of story on something every month.

2691
02:26:59.830 --> 02:27:01.690
And they're fucking tremendous and they're great.

2692
02:27:01.691 --> 02:27:04.420
If you're in your car and you're driving to work or something,
Oh God.

2693
02:27:04.570 --> 02:27:08.350
Slap one of those and you'll just have a big stupid smile on your face and half,

2694
02:27:08.510 --> 02:27:12.850
like really deep shit.
Yeah.
He's awesome.
It wasn't.
We're lucky,
man.
We're lucky.

2695
02:27:12.851 --> 02:27:17.440
We know a lot of comedians.
Yeah,
we are for sure.
Where you at this weekend?

2696
02:27:18.220 --> 02:27:22.850
I'm at a wedding.
Oh God.
I'm at the comedy store in the factory.
I'm to hide.

2697

And Massachusetts.

2698
02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:28.310
Somebody made you go to across the country for their stupid fucking Buddhists,

2699

A lot of marijuana.

2701
02:27:35.890 --> 02:27:39.570

well,
absolutely.
They knew it.

2702
02:27:39.610 --> 02:27:42.250
It's casual.
They knew that you were going to be high.
Yeah.

2703
02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:46.090
You're going to have an edible.
Probably not super strong.
I don't want to go.

2704
02:27:46.150 --> 02:27:47.320
I don't want to get bonkers,

2705
02:27:47.321 --> 02:27:49.960
but I want to get social anxiety and I don't want to fuck him.
Yeah.

2706
02:27:49.961 --> 02:27:52.990
How the social anxiety.
No,

I'll have it.
Yeah.

You want to be high enough where it's cute,

if you don't cry when they say they're,
I'm a romantic.

2709
02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:02.590
Even when I'm believing that shit,

2710
02:28:02.620 --> 02:28:05.900
I'm still like some tugs at me when I see it once in your life.

2711

Yeah.
No,

02:31:39.930 --> 02:31:41.760
Yeah.
That's for you.
It should be the,

2770
02:31:42.120 --> 02:31:45.420
who would you say the Italians were the worst of the white version?
Armenians.

2771
02:31:45.421 --> 02:31:47.010
Persians.
I mean,
it's the worst.
The whites.

2772
02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:50.910
I don't think you want to make that in a tee shirt for him.
Fuck you up.

What it should be.

2776
02:32:01.330 --> 02:32:02.880
If you're going to have an arch of here,
t shirt,

2777
02:32:02.940 --> 02:32:06.180
you must've said something fucked up.
You know what people contact us on Twitter.

2778
02:32:06.330 --> 02:32:07.530
Tell us the most fucked up thing.

2779
02:32:07.531 --> 02:32:10.920
Because sometimes people put things like in message board posts in quotes or on

2780
02:32:10.921 --> 02:32:14.000
Twitter.
Like what?
I completely forgot.
I said,
I write people.

2781
02:32:14.010 --> 02:32:16.310
What was the context?
Which is,
what was that about?
We look,

2782
02:32:16.590 --> 02:32:21.060
we appreciate the fuck out of it.
I,
um,
I say this all the time,

2783
02:32:21.061 --> 02:32:23.860
but I only say it because it's 100% true.
I,
the,

2784
02:32:23.910 --> 02:32:28.910
the thing that I am most blown away by is the amount of fucking cool people that

2785
02:32:30.421 --> 02:32:34.890
we meet at these shows.
It's,
it's,
it's amazing.
I,
um,
I don't understand it.

2786
02:32:34.891 --> 02:32:39.330
I don't,
uh,
I don't know how it all happened,
but,
uh,
I do know that a,

2787
02:32:39.331 --> 02:32:43.710
we're truly,
truly thankful and we had a lot of cool people,

2788
02:32:43.860 --> 02:32:46.800
I want to say humbled by it,
but is that is the word.
It's like,
whoa.

2789
02:32:46.801 --> 02:32:50.460
Like these are the,
this w everywhere we go,
everybody says the same thing.

2790
02:32:50.461 --> 02:32:54.480
These are the nicest crowds,
the most generous crowds.
Well,
again,
well in tip.

2791
02:32:54.481 --> 02:32:55.890
Well,
look,
we're,

2792
02:32:55.891 --> 02:32:58.710
we're happy as fuck that we're connecting with you guys like that.

2793
02:32:58.711 --> 02:33:02.340
And then every message that I get where people say,
hey man,
because of you,

2794
02:33:02.341 --> 02:33:05.100
I started drinking Kale shakes in the morning.
I lost 50 pounds.

2795
02:33:05.101 --> 02:33:08.780
I'm working out for the first time.
So I started [inaudible] like your,

2796
02:33:08.830 --> 02:33:12.000
the drive to not change.
And once you overcome like,
oh,
what am I,

2797
02:33:12.060 --> 02:33:13.680
what was that resistor?
Yeah.
What am I resisting?

2798
02:33:13.710 --> 02:33:16.620
And it's also having people in this conversation,

2799
02:33:17.010 --> 02:33:19.920
they tune in and they're a part of it,
even though they're not saying anything.

2800
02:33:19.921 --> 02:33:22.110
They might be saying something in their car.
They're like,
yeah,

2801
02:33:22.140 --> 02:33:25.230
fucking that fucking bitch.
You know that guy's an asshole.

2802
02:33:25.260 --> 02:33:28.600
There's a lot of people live in a town of 2000 and there's cool people there and

2803
02:33:28.620 --> 02:33:31.440
they're tuned into this and say,
oh,
find someone else's out there like this.

2804
02:33:31.470 --> 02:33:34.320
We recognize that this is an important part of your life.

2805
02:33:34.350 --> 02:33:36.810
This fucking show will always remain free.

2806
02:33:37.110 --> 02:33:40.650
This show will always remain completely uncensored.
If I tell you something,

2807
02:33:40.651 --> 02:33:45.180
it's because I believe it.
Even if I'm wrong,
I believe that shit.

2808
02:33:45.420 --> 02:33:49.080
Go to the Lobero theater this Saturday night or this Friday night in Santa

2809
02:33:49.081 --> 02:33:53.340
Barbara Duncan Trussell just add it to the show.
We are so not fucking around.

2810
02:33:53.580 --> 02:33:57.870
That is the Lobero Theater in Sacramento or in Santa Barbara or rather this

2811
02:33:57.871 --> 02:34:00.000
summit's call me.
Who the fuck is calling me?

2812
02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:05.040
Bob Fisher from the icehouse power VI's house.
Um,
so that's it folks.

2813
02:34:05.041 --> 02:34:08.220
We will see you tomorrow from the Ice House.
Ironically,

2814
02:34:08.340 --> 02:34:12.060
with the real Rick Ross on a.com,
use the code name rogue and go from,
by the way,

2815
02:34:12.070 --> 02:34:15.060
you guys,
the way you give back to us is by coming to our shows.
Yeah,
listen,

2816
02:34:15.090 --> 02:34:19.210
we'd love that you can ever go.
And the way though,
quite honestly,

2817
02:34:19.211 --> 02:34:21.490
that's a nice absolute benefit.

2818
02:34:21.491 --> 02:34:24.700
The biggest benefit for t for true is knowing the people are enjoying it.

2819
02:34:24.890 --> 02:34:28.180
You know,
when I run into people even at that,
that don't come to my shows.

2820
02:34:28.181 --> 02:34:30.010
If I run into with the mall or something like that,
and like,
dude,

2821
02:34:30.011 --> 02:34:32.950
I'm a huge podcast fan.
That makes me feel fucking great.
If you,

2822
02:34:32.951 --> 02:34:35.660
if I'm doing something and you're enjoying it,
I'm happy.
That's,

2823
02:34:35.980 --> 02:34:39.430
that's how I believe life should be.
All right.
You fucking freaks.

2824
02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:44.350
This show's over.
These loving mushrooms.
He's love mushrooms.
Go Fuck Yourself.

2825
02:34:44.880 --> 02:34:48.640
Um,
I don't even have any chromatic going out,
right?

2826
02:34:49.390 --> 02:34:51.690
I don't even have any controversial.
Um,
