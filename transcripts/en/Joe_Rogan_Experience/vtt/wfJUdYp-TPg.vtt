1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.120
Five you get less enthusiastic with after it's been a few times.
He'll like,

2
00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:09.120
you're not really.
We're live.
All right.
We're live.
What's up man?

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.120
How are you guys doing this?
Thanks for having me.
My pleasure.

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.440
Sorry for the false starts.
We've been having issues with our equipment.

5
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.610
Good to see though,
man.
What's up?
Good to be here and talk.
Hunter Thompson.

6
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.240
My pleasure.
Um,
so your book free kingdom,

7
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.590
you know,
we live in interesting times right now.

8
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.560
It's kind of a kind of a shit show at every campus in a moment.

9
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.280
About a fist from your face.
Pull that sucker.
There you go.
My hands.

10
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:37.130
Should I put them on you?
Do whatever you want with your hands.

11
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.580
Shoot with this one.
What is all this a,
you got a lot of writing.
Well,

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.110
when I wrote the book,

13
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:46.880
I wanted to make sure my sentence never sounded like Thompson sentences,
right?

14
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.790
So I didn't write out a lot of his sentences.
But this morning before coming on,

15
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.100
I went and got some of my favorite quotes.
I'm just,

16
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.590
I'm out longhand to get a sense of what is a,

17
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.660
what his perspective was when rhythm.
Once again,

18
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.650
didn't he do that with the Great Gatsby?
He like a few times by hand.

19
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:03.120
He like typed it out.
Yeah.

20
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.680
I love that idea that he was trying to find like the rhythm of the words.

21
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.390
That's such a fascinating notion because comedians do that in the early days of

22
00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:14.570
comedy,
like a lot of guys,
um,

23
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.300
in like before they ever start getting on stage themselves,

24
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.420
they'll imitate their favorite comedians.
Bits.

25
00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:24.870
Like they'll do a Richard Pryor bit and they'll do it to their friends and

26
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:25.370
they'll get,

27
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.640
get a sense of the rhythm and the timing and get those laughs from doing a

28
00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:32.730
Richard Pryor bit to their friends and then they get that bug.

29
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.240
It's like part of what infects them.
I mean,
that's the hardest thing to steal.

30
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:39.180
We're not plagiarizing,
but we're trying to understand what decisions they made.

31
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.380
Beautiful work.
Yeah.
I'm sure he wasn't plagiarizing,
but it's,

32
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.660
it's so unfortunate when,
when someone does,
yes.
You know,
when,

33
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.050
when you have someone,

34
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.100
whether it's a hunter or Richard Pryor or anyone who's just got a truly

35
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.660
exceptional and unique mind or someone who doesn't like our president and

36
00:01:57.661 --> 00:02:02.661
decided when he ran in 2016 to plagiarize Richard Nixon's 1968 convention

37
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.070
speeches directly.
Really?
Yeah.

38
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:08.520
That was the headlight and the fucking times it said Nixon's inspiration.

39
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.160
I'm sorry.
Uh,
Trump's inspiration.
Nixon is the one.

40
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:14.910
So the light's about crime and I'm like barbarians at the gate,
crime,

41
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.000
law and order.
Those were all from Nixon's Shitty but successful.

42
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:20.580
1968 a Miami convention speech.

43
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:24.420
And Thompson Thompson knew how effective that that was.
Yeah.

44
00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:29.130
I wonder if he did that on purpose because he was so good in one thing that

45
00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:33.450
Trump is so good.
He's so good at getting the media to talk about him.
And like,

46
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:36.690
one of the best ways to get the media to talk about him was give them something

47
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:39.660
to be angry about that no one else is going to give a fuck about.
He was like,
oh,

48
00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:44.310
well Narnia plagiarize,
but I plagiarize as much better from Nixon.
Right.
So it,

49
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.300
I loved it.
And Melania took some lines from Michelle Obama's speech,
right?
Yeah.

50
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.740
Oh,
if you plagiarize Nixon,
that's okay.
All right.
So freaking done.

51
00:02:52.741 --> 00:02:54.000
The book about Hunters Thompson,
I mean,

52
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:57.330
it's really about taking the fucking emotion of living in this present,

53
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.690
looking back at Thompson's and then trying to write it like a novel to dramatize

54
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:08.420
all of the experiences he went through that are today so applicable to us and

55
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.660
just show his perspective that's so applicable to us today.

56
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.470
What do you got in here,
Jamie,
from New York Times

57
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.180
or the inspiration and Nixon?
I was like,
are you,
you're running on Nixon,

58
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.660
that's what you're running on here.
Some parallels,
you know,
I mean,

59
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.520
do you remember when,
um,

60
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.450
when hunter got together with a Bill Murray and bill's brother and they did that

61
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:34.930
thing where they were trying to get people to a,
Nixon got a bad deal.

62
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.580
We've got to bring them back and people are going along with,
oh yeah,

63
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.490
that's a good,
yeah.
Yeah.
You mean for you?
I remember that.
Yeah.
Like that.

64
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.180
There's a lot of parallels with Trump in that regard.
I mean,

65
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.820
one of my favorite quotes by Thompson is like,
um,
you know,

66
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.870
Richard Nixon is with this Barbie doll family and his Barbie doll wife is like

67
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:57.040
America's answer to um,
you know,

68
00:03:57.041 --> 00:04:01.030
it's America's doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and like,
you know,
he is the Werewolf.

69
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.590
He speaks to the Werewolf in us and Nixon chose to hide that Werewolf his whole

70
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:07.900
career until it finally came out cause he was insane with power.

71
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.130
Trump ran on the werewolf.
He's like,
no,
I'm not gonna hide it.
That's who I am.

72
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.760
That's what I'm going to use to try to get elected.
And like George Wallace did,

73
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:16.960
like other politicians did.

74
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.260
It had resonance and it happened with Trump because of our media environment,

75
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.070
because of the place we live in now to amplify them all the way to the most

76
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:26.140
powerful position in the world,
which is insane.

77
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.530
It would be really fascinating to see if hunter was alive and in his prime.

78
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:33.810
Now how he was,
I think his take on it were very similar to Matt Tie EBS,

79
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.570
you know like Mad Eeb is in my opinion,

80
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.970
our more reasonable,

81
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.260
more put together version of Hunter Thompson because he's more stained

82
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.113
discipline,

83
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.210
long career version of the pathologies like rational and he's there all the
time.

84
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.230
Like the,

85
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.910
I'm sure you've heard the recently uncovered recording of hunter calling in to

86
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:58.690
some company that installed a DVD player and he's fucking screaming and yell at,

87
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.150
it's like 15 minutes and then he like gets lost.

88
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:03.550
I think that's what the fuck and the DVD player doesn't work.

89
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.260
Y'All got y'all my fucking cards.
I mean that was the 90 days are not the best.

90
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:08.381
You know,

91
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:11.710
I think what Toby does is what Thompson did very well on a Thompson was really

92
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:15.050
good at looking at Nixon and saying,
how are you manipulating the way we see you?

93
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.430
You get a version of you out and Toby looks at the way the media gets played.

94
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.490
He looks at the way that an administration manipulates the media and he

95
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.340
dramatizes that while everybody else just gives us the information the

96
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:26.890
administration is giving us.
And that goes back to Thompson with Nixon.

97
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.220
Thomson had space when he worked for rolling stone and he could write about how

98
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.990
Nixon made everybody watched his speeches,

99
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:35.950
the press on a closed circuit television and they made the press just like Trump

100
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.550
off in the corner when the plane arrived,
you know,
being berated by everybody.

101
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.210
It's very similar to what is going on now.
And again,

102
00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:46.180
we see people getting hot takes are we see people doing op eds.

103
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.250
We don't see people dramatize it.

104
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.630
How manipulative these corrupt administrations are.
And were,

105
00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:55.760
and Thompson did that beautifully.
Um,
Toby,
does that be a play?

106
00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.060
Was a Nixon berated by the press?
Is that why he chose to have was,

107
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.710
I mean he was a crook,
so he doesn't want the press to investigate them.
Like he,

108
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:05.270
you know,
he was a crick with San Clemente,

109
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.210
like his loans with Bibi rebozo and all of that.
He was a quick,

110
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:09.980
the way you use the IRS to investigate his,

111
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.010
and if he was a Kirk when he tried to break into the Brookings Institution to

112
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:14.300
destroy and fom evidence,

113
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:17.810
like he didn't want the press around him because he'd committed very serious

114
00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:20.660
crimes.
That I think that's similar to what we see now.
I mean,

115
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.460
as people sit on the show,
no,
no president wants the a journalist,
you know,

116
00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:28.850
digging into their lives specifically because you don't want chubbiness with

117
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:29.271
journalists.

118
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:33.650
But I think Trump and Nixon both knew they had so much to hide that to actually

119
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:36.590
have a journalist like Hunter Thompson who was a good investigative journalist

120
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:40.910
to have my baby around,
that's dangerous for them.
They'll go to jail,

121
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.550
which Nixon should've have Trump perhaps should,

122
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.630
while who knows what's going to happen.
How did you,
uh,

123
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.550
how'd you get involved with a writing this book?
Well,

124
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:53.510
I mean I've always loved on her as Thompson in how did you get exposed to them?

125
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.310
You know,
in,
in,
in,
uh,

126
00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.740
I was 17 years old in a Catholic high school at Bellarmine college preparatory

127
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:03.890
up in San Jose and we had a counterculture,
a writing class.

128
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.650
And so I read some of it in there and then a friend had an audio book,

129
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.430
the fear loathing.

130
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.220
And so I just remember the first time hearing that old audio book of fear and

131
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:12.260
loathing of where somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert.

132
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.950
And then in my twenties I really got into strange rumblings and Ozzie lawn,

133
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.050
which is about a conspiracy within the Los Angeles Police Department regarding

134
00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:24.860
the death of Ruben Salazar.
I'm a prominent journalist and I read that,
I'm like,

135
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:25.723
oh my God,
dude,

136
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.300
this isn't somebody that's just dancing on stage or like performing a road

137
00:07:29.301 --> 00:07:29.990
narrative.

138
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.930
This is an investigative journalist who's going to the most powerful people

139
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.340
exposing things they don't want us to see and in a sense risking his life to do

140
00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:39.850
so because he says in strange room and leaves in Oslo Lawn,

141
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.790
which is in rolling stone in 1970 he says that they're willing to kill Ruben

142
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.190
Salazar who was the most prominent journalist in Los Angeles.

143
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:49.250
You could argue at the time what the fuck is to stop them from killing me.

144
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.560
Hunter Thompson for asking these questions.
Well,

145
00:07:51.561 --> 00:07:55.850
I think that's what a lot of people are saying today with Jamil Shogi.
You know,

146
00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:01.430
Jamal could shogi his death has got a lot of journalists really freaking out.

147
00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:04.700
Like what?
You know,
what am I doing if I'm criticizing world leaders,

148
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.180
talking about international politics,
if this could happen to me,

149
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.950
political violence is effective because it's used to silence you either

150
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.830
opposition or journalists.
And so for me,

151
00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:18.650
writing this book and I tried to dramatize it like a novel,
it's quick.

152
00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:22.130
It's like only 200 2,210 pages and then it's like a hundred pages of notes.

153
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.620
So I like cited every sight,

154
00:08:23.621 --> 00:08:27.140
smell or sound so that somebody that knows Thompson really well,
it can be like,

155
00:08:27.141 --> 00:08:29.390
where the fuck did you get this information right and somebody else can,

156
00:08:29.391 --> 00:08:32.810
if they have questions,
just go back and look.
But long story short for me,

157
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:37.490
the crux of the book was in Chicago in 1968 where a hundred Thompson at a press

158
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:42.350
pass,
he went to the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night.

159
00:08:42.351 --> 00:08:45.590
Mayor Daley gave this order to clear the intersection of Balbo in Michigan

160
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.830
because there was a protest going on.
Five 10,000 people.

161
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.310
Thompson was standing next to the Haymarket in which was on the ground floor

162
00:08:52.311 --> 00:08:52.730
level.

163
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.910
It was a plate glass window he was standing with from the Democratic national

164
00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.880
convention standing with their wives and the cops charged.

165
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.170
They did like a double pinch of formation like Hannibal and like um,

166
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.860
[inaudible] like fucking 100 BC and they split the protesters and half beat.

167
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:09.720
Everybody hit Thompson over the head.

168
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:13.280
He got his motorcycle helmet on just in time so he's not concussed.

169
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.650
He can see everything that's going on and the entire plate glass window behind

170
00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:20.040
him shatters.
Everybody falls in,
cops jump in,

171
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.730
are beating everybody and he's looking around and he's sure that snipers on the

172
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:25.770
roof are gonna open fire at any moment.

173
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:29.930
So he runs to the Blackstone where he staying across the way shows his room key.

174
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.250
It gets beat up by the cops as you're trying to get any,
he goes,
I live here,

175
00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.890
goddammit,
I'm paying $100 a day,
let me get my fucking room.

176
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:39.660
And he barely gets it and he just sits on his bed afterwards and he says they

177
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:44.070
knew I was pressed.
They saw my press pass,
the hit me because I was pressed.

178
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.250
And if that's where we're at right now with journalists,
you know,

179
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.540
political opponents and journalists are being clubbed to keep silent and to not

180
00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:55.110
respond.
Then this is not the democracy.
We know.
Yeah.

181
00:09:55.111 --> 00:10:00.111
His ex wife talked about that as being like one of the only moments where she

182
00:10:00.691 --> 00:10:04.830
saw him cry for two weeks,
tops cried afterwards for two weeks.
He couldn't stop.

183
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:10.050
It was crazy.
It was a,
it was a crazy time,
right?
I mean,

184
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:15.060
that the time is very similar in a lot of ways to what's going on today.

185
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.230
It's just today there's just so much more information and so much more.

186
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.160
People have so much more of an ability to communicate.
Yeah.

187
00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:25.170
And I think it's almost easier to coordinate violence.

188
00:10:25.171 --> 00:10:27.540
I was just talking to the head of the proud boys.
You know,

189
00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:32.370
Gavin McInnes is a group,
um,
um,
Enrique Tario and he's like,

190
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.520
you know,
he's an advocate.
He's saying he's using the language of the left.

191
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:38.700
He's like,
I'm a victim.
I can't buy groceries.
They'd taken my big accounts,

192
00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:42.990
my plant forms.
But when he talks about violence,
he's like,
who the fuck are you?

193
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:45.840
Antifa like I'm,
you know,
you're 120 pounds in wet.

194
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.340
Like we have civil war you're going to lose.

195
00:10:47.341 --> 00:10:50.790
And I was sitting next to him during the podcast and basically what I said was,

196
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:51.871
if we have a civil war,

197
00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:53.790
you're going to be hit by a sniper fire from the fucking roof.

198
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.730
You're not going to be in a fist fight with antifa across the way.

199
00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.600
And I think there's this idea on the right that we can push towards violence and

200
00:11:00.601 --> 00:11:04.860
we can get very close to it with our rhetoric or with our actions,

201
00:11:04.861 --> 00:11:08.070
but that it won't spread.
Like the conflagration won't keep going.
Yeah.

202
00:11:08.071 --> 00:11:09.630
I don't know if that's how I slid to the right.

203
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.100
I mean not with Antifa and the left too,

204
00:11:11.101 --> 00:11:13.980
and that's why I love Thompson was as hard on the left as he was on the right

205
00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:16.570
when he wrote and it was so important for his intelligence as a writer.

206
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.920
But I think just even the left and the right in general for a lot of these

207
00:11:19.921 --> 00:11:22.710
people is just an identity and a gang that they belong to.

208
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.290
And I don't think they really understand violence.
You know,

209
00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:27.930
you want to talk about violence,
talked to a military guy.

210
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.310
You don't talk to someone who really understands what violence actually is and

211
00:11:32.311 --> 00:11:36.030
they don't have this empty rhetoric like these fools do.

212
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.090
Exactly as a lot of these people that are calling for violence like,
no,

213
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.170
you should be calling for comradery and you should be calling for communication.

214
00:11:43.171 --> 00:11:44.400
We should be calling for some way.

215
00:11:44.401 --> 00:11:47.840
We could all work this out where the civilians,
the s,

216
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.820
the civilization that we live in,
that we all,

217
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:54.190
we all can get along together and most people

218
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:58.240
<v 1>don't want to impede you from living your life and doing what you want to do.</v>

219
00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.433
Most people,

220
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.770
the vast majority a hundred times of believed in working within the system.

221
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.690
He know he believed like it might be a fucked up system,

222
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:06.550
but you can still run for sheriff in Aspen and he believe in,

223
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:07.630
once you resort to violence,

224
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.720
that means the conversation has stopped and it disfigures you.

225
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.950
So he cried for two weeks.

226
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.470
That was the most surprising thing for me researching this book and writing it

227
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.940
was to see how much the violence affected him that he experienced at Chicago.

228
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.060
You can speak to someone who's done and then they fighting has been punched in

229
00:12:22.061 --> 00:12:23.710
the face as hard as somebody can punch you.

230
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.310
Most Americans haven't had that and that changes your ability to articulate

231
00:12:27.311 --> 00:12:30.490
something back in that moment.
It means you,
if that's political,

232
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.210
if it's a police officer or a political opponent that uses violence instead of

233
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.820
an argument to respond to you.
We've,

234
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.820
we've left the realm that we recognize and we're not going to be able to

235
00:12:39.821 --> 00:12:42.820
communicate even in the limited way that we're communicating right now at

236
00:12:42.821 --> 00:12:45.070
Thompson knew that.
So that's why after Chicago,

237
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.470
I love that he went back to aspen and he's like,

238
00:12:47.471 --> 00:12:50.920
I'm going around fucking sheriff.
I'm going to do a mayoral campaign and Aspen.

239
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.680
And that was brilliant because it was his way to control his environment,

240
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.830
knowing that Mayor Daley's not listening to his nonviolent protest.

241
00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.740
Richard Nixon is not listening to his nonviolent protest.

242
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:03.460
Thompson needed to find another avenue to try to work within the American system

243
00:13:03.461 --> 00:13:04.400
to make things happen.

244
00:13:04.401 --> 00:13:08.710
And a great contrast is his good friend on Oscar Zeta Acosta.

245
00:13:08.711 --> 00:13:11.950
There's a wonderful PBS documentary at rise and fall of the Brown buffalo by,

246
00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:14.580
I'm Philip Rodriguez,
a great director.
And it's a cost his life,
uh,

247
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:18.460
to Dr. Gonzales based on shore and fellow the,
you know,

248
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.580
Thompson had more advantages than Acosta and Acosta was being perceived by the

249
00:13:21.581 --> 00:13:25.240
LAPD was eventually set up by them and for him working within the system he ran

250
00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:29.890
for sheriff wasn't an option.
The Cobb set him up for a high speed bust,

251
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.270
you know,
like the cops had,

252
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.720
the cops had undercover agents from something called the special operations for

253
00:13:34.721 --> 00:13:37.870
conspiracy,
which is a fucking department in the LAPD at the time.

254
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.520
And they were trying to use those provocateurs to incite violence against the

255
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:43.690
plainclothes please.

256
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.590
So that or the normal clothes police so that lethal violence could be used to

257
00:13:47.591 --> 00:13:50.350
silence us civil rights movement in the Brown bread.

258
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.310
So they used agent provocateurs to make it look like they're a part of the

259
00:13:54.311 --> 00:13:57.080
protest.
Yeah,
there was an age old tactic,
right.

260
00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:58.330
That's how you destroy the civil rights movement.

261
00:13:58.331 --> 00:14:02.200
Because the most effective weapon in silencing civil rights is lethal force.

262
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.840
And you can do that in another country as the u s has done.

263
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:07.210
But the West can't use tactics like my lie,

264
00:14:07.211 --> 00:14:11.560
like Thompson writes about this in the US,
unless you have a provocative reason,

265
00:14:11.561 --> 00:14:14.200
unless somebody that's undercover attacks a cop.

266
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.620
And so the cops then like would happen on August 29th,

267
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.310
1978 during the moratorium riots can just flood east la whoever they want and

268
00:14:21.311 --> 00:14:24.920
they can,
the blue ribbons haulers art's head off with a tear gas gun.
Uh,

269
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.240
yeah,
those are darker days when you couldn't communicate as well.

270
00:14:29.241 --> 00:14:31.840
And then I think that's one of the reasons why a hundred decided to run for

271
00:14:31.841 --> 00:14:36.640
sheriff in Aspen is that he felt like he could control that area.

272
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.970
Like it would have a direct impact on his life.

273
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.600
The local politics have a real impact in your day to day existence,

274
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:47.890
whereas what's going on in Washington for the most parts on affecting you if

275
00:14:47.891 --> 00:14:49.000
you're living in Woody Creek?

276
00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.850
I mean there were people that hadn't Nixon's point of view in Aspen who are
like,

277
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.240
let's develop this valley beyond what it can hold in terms of its environment.

278
00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.370
Let's,
um,

279
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.890
in prison hippies because they are going to take away from our tourists on,

280
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.630
you know,
economy,
you know,
let's,
um,
you know,

281
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.880
not have or not adhere to normal like civil rights laws.
And so Thompson,

282
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.540
you know,
in a participatory democracy,
almost a Jeffersonian democracy,
um,

283
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:16.370
way ran for sheriff by emphasizing personal agency and most of all trying to get

284
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:18.890
up the youth vote.
Like people who had left the political system.

285
00:15:18.891 --> 00:15:19.820
But we're living in Aspen,

286
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.210
a lot of people who like hippies who had fled the cities in the late 1960s and

287
00:15:23.211 --> 00:15:24.680
we're living,
you know,
in,
in the West.

288
00:15:24.681 --> 00:15:27.980
And he got them involved and they should have won the mayor mayoral campaign

289
00:15:27.981 --> 00:15:31.340
with a Joe Edwards that Thompson was the director of that and they lost by like

290
00:15:31.341 --> 00:15:34.550
six votes.
Then when he ran for sheriff,
it cut really bad.

291
00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:38.390
And he talks about this in fairly early on the campaign trail later is that a

292
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.540
few nights before both parties,
the Democrats and the Republicans freaked out.

293
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:44.720
And so the Democrats said,
all right,
we'll kind of throw our weight behind you,

294
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:45.680
the Republican sheriff,

295
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.980
and then you Republicans will throw your weight for county manager behind our

296
00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:52.010
candidate.
And so Thompson and Bluesy by like two or 300 votes.

297
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:56.260
And so in fear and loathing in Las Vegas on the campaign trail in 1972,
he's um,

298
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.930
at the Nixon campaign,
um,
Nixon's giving his acceptance speech at the convention.

299
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.960
Thompson's with the Nixon youth who are about to do a demonstration.

300
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.290
And he says like,
you know,
I'm not a journalist,
you can't kick me out.

301
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:08.690
Like I'm a political observer.
He's like,
have you ever run for office?

302
00:16:08.691 --> 00:16:10.700
And then Nixon guy is like,
no,

303
00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:13.340
have you and Thompson's like sheriff and I would have won.

304
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.200
But the liberal stuck it to me.

305
00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:21.020
<v 2>I love how he shaved his head.
It was long haired opponent.</v>

306
00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:25.280
I mean that was a great,
that debate.
So in the book I recreate that debate a lot.

307
00:16:25.281 --> 00:16:28.010
Like,
cause there's transcripts of it that the beat is brilliant.
It is Thompson.

308
00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.300
<v 1>It's amazing.
The guy's like,
I've only used my gun once in 10 years,</v>

309
00:16:31.301 --> 00:16:33.040
but I like to have it [inaudible].
It's like,
well,

310
00:16:33.041 --> 00:16:35.590
if you've used it once in 10 years,
maybe you don't need it.

311
00:16:35.591 --> 00:16:38.640
We could try not having it.
You know,
in his gun rights,
um,

312
00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.530
views were very complex and changed after Bobby Kennedy's death.

313
00:16:41.531 --> 00:16:45.160
But he was so intelligent on stage with the sheriff who's like,

314
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:46.383
I just want this job.

315
00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:50.540
<v 2>Had like Gulping,
like,
you know,
it couldn't,
this was this cerated by Thompson.</v>

316
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.670
Yeah.
You know,
it's a,
it's a really interesting,
the,

317
00:16:54.671 --> 00:16:58.850
the documentary that follows the campaign and when you get to see him,

318
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.133
you know,

319
00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:04.880
heartfelt phone when he loses and you got a sense of what,

320
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:08.690
that there was real hope back then like that.
If these guys could do that.

321
00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.940
And what's interesting now is,
um,
you know,

322
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:15.890
back in the 70s they really did have a free community and Aspen.

323
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.810
That shit,
it's gone now.

324
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:20.330
I don't know what happened in EHRs have replaced the millionaire.

325
00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:23.840
I was told when I went out to do research place,
man,
you go to Aspen,
he seen it.

326
00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:26.930
He was like $20 million houses and people like,

327
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.040
it's one of the rare places where people still wear fur coats,
you know,

328
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.870
not ironically or fake,
but real fur coat.
Well,
if you wear a fur coat in La,

329
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:39.050
first of all,
it's never hold it off for a fur coat.
But if you did,

330
00:17:39.051 --> 00:17:44.030
you might get fucked up,
like thrown on you.
Some shit could go down.
You know,

331
00:17:44.031 --> 00:17:46.910
like you,
you most likely nothing's going to happen,

332
00:17:46.911 --> 00:17:50.340
but there's a possible chance,
which is really,
because if you wear a leather

333
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:54.150
<v 0>jacket,
you have no problem.
Yeah,
it's weird.
I mean,</v>

334
00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.120
Aspen's weird because a lot of the Thompson's friends like Lauren Jenkins,

335
00:17:57.121 --> 00:18:00.660
a great journalist,
um,
they've moved down to basalt,
they'd say down valley.

336
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:04.140
So I was out there with his,
um,
his son,
Juan Thompson,
is a fantastic writer.

337
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:05.830
He wrote a book called,
um,
um,

338
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.600
stories I tell myself about his relationship with his father in contact with

339
00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:10.530
Juan through email.

340
00:18:10.531 --> 00:18:13.770
He's a really good writer and he's a really honest and brilliant writer.

341
00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.180
He seems like a good dude and he seemed like a really good dude in the Gonzo

342
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:21.240
documentary as well.
That was a great document.
Yeah.

343
00:18:21.241 --> 00:18:26.100
I'm a big fan of kidney.
He,
he always kills it.
I,
um,
I went to the,

344
00:18:26.101 --> 00:18:28.690
uh,
the tavern and woody creek when I wasn't,

345
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:33.300
I felt like if I'm here I gotta go.
I gotta go there.

346
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.470
Yeah.
Was Weird.
It's weird being there,
man.
When did you go?
How long ago was that?

347
00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:41.310
This was a year ago.
You're now where people on bicycles just,
uh,

348
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.240
riding their bikes by the whole time.
It's on this huge bike route now.

349
00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:48.000
It was cold as fuck.
It was the winter.
We were there for a ski trip.

350
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.270
So what did you think of it while it was just cool?
You know,

351
00:18:51.271 --> 00:18:56.250
it's like there's places you go to where you just,
uh,

352
00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.850
you just Kinda,
you know,
I was with my family.
They didn't give a fuck.

353
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:01.350
My kids have no idea who he is.

354
00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.940
The children listen to hear or need to know who he is and children to help my

355
00:19:05.941 --> 00:19:09.690
kids learn eventually,
but they're just eating enchiladas.
You know,
but it's just,

356
00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:11.120
um,
it's uh,

357
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:16.310
to me it represented a big part of who he,

358
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.920
you know,
this is like this is home base.

359
00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.970
He came out to San Francisco and here's a picture of me there.

360
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.240
I think there's a picture of me there on my Instagram.

361
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.690
I was this special place from when he was in San Francisco was like being on the

362
00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:31.524
central nerve.

363
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:36.530
He was there from 64 to 67 and [inaudible] 66 and he saw the first Jefferson

364
00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:39.120
airplane concert right next to the matrix.

365
00:19:39.121 --> 00:19:42.330
He went out every night until like 5:00 AM this is what the hell's angels.

366
00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.390
That's awesome.
Yeah.
I got hammered there to respect

367
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:51.060
quite a few Margarita is here.
He could divide his life up.
Look,
the free power,

368
00:19:51.061 --> 00:19:54.030
if you see in the background that freak power,
um,
the,
the,
yeah,

369
00:19:54.031 --> 00:19:56.050
the sheriff's a campaign symbol,

370
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:59.840
but he moved at Woody Creek and he suddenly had you see it in his,
um,

371
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.670
you see it when you interview people that knew him.
You see it in his letters.

372
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:03.990
He had space again.

373
00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.320
And being in the city was hard for him because he can write beautifully about

374
00:20:07.321 --> 00:20:09.330
the hell's angels,
about the countercultural scene.

375
00:20:09.331 --> 00:20:13.230
He was at war protests and the free speech movement with Mario Savio,

376
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.860
he was there,
but it was burning him up.
You know,
it was using him up.

377
00:20:16.861 --> 00:20:19.260
And I think when you went to Woody Creek,
he learned that all right,

378
00:20:19.261 --> 00:20:21.570
I can take a plane to Chicago,
he kicked my ass kicked,

379
00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.690
but I can come back and if I want to have a drink I can go to that tavern or I

380
00:20:24.691 --> 00:20:27.060
can go to the Jerome Hotel.
And that's a good space.

381
00:20:27.061 --> 00:20:29.730
And I think that was a good space for him.
Yep.
Well I think that's a,

382
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.990
probably a very intelligent move on his behalf.
And a lot of us,

383
00:20:33.991 --> 00:20:37.860
I think that are involved in day to day chaos would probably benefit from

384
00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:39.480
something similar.
I mean,

385
00:20:39.481 --> 00:20:42.030
I just don't think he gets enough credit for his effort.
You know,

386
00:20:42.031 --> 00:20:44.560
one thing I've found when reading the book I interviewed,
um,

387
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:48.700
and if he'd Bob Geiger,
who fair is dedicated to and who was a doctor,

388
00:20:48.701 --> 00:20:51.910
that it was a friend of his in Sonoma and Geiger initially was the one

389
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:52.930
prescribed dexedrine.

390
00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:58.000
And so people think Thompson was just doing acid in writing or whatever and

391
00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:59.520
maybe later as a caricature,

392
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.110
whoever he became that might've been part of his persona.

393
00:21:02.111 --> 00:21:05.950
But when he was reading from the book is from Kennedy's assassination to Nixon's

394
00:21:05.951 --> 00:21:08.890
resignation,
he was working so fucking hard,

395
00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:12.610
like he was working harder than we can ever imagine.
Douglas Brinkley is,
um,

396
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.930
the presidential historian who does his literary estate talks about Thompson

397
00:21:16.931 --> 00:21:18.700
wasn't as fun as he seemed during that time.

398
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.940
He took dexedrine to write and he had a drinking problem.

399
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:25.600
I'm having is some sort of an amphetamine.
It's Adderall,
Adderall,

400
00:21:25.601 --> 00:21:26.830
that's cut differently with salt.

401
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.080
So it's a little bit like you go a little higher and it,

402
00:21:29.081 --> 00:21:31.810
when it comes down it's a little harder.
Well,
Adderall was Oba trawl,

403
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.780
which was an old diet drug and that was repurposed in like 96.

404
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.240
That is a little bit smoother in that sense,

405
00:21:37.241 --> 00:21:40.150
but it's very similar to what a two what Thompson took.

406
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:44.050
He had a great editor named Margaret Harel who was his editor on Hell's angels

407
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.210
and he didn't know she was 27 when he was 29 he thought she was like 55 cause

408
00:21:48.211 --> 00:21:51.880
they would talk on the phone every day to edit the book and he sent her,

409
00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:53.950
she still has the letter.
I've done something events with her.

410
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:57.100
She still has the actual letter.
He sent her a five milligram dexedrine.

411
00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:00.490
He's like,
hey,
it's going to be hard the last 10 pages to edit,

412
00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:04.180
take this and focus.
So she still has it.
This orange,

413
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:09.070
he'll five milligram dexedrine for 40 50 years she's had.
Wow,
that's crazy.

414
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.770
Yeah.
Um,
that gives me,

415
00:22:11.771 --> 00:22:15.130
documentary is a really fantastic,

416
00:22:15.131 --> 00:22:18.910
it's probably one of the best introductions that anybody could have to try to

417
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:23.140
get a grip on.
Why after all these years,

418
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.710
a hundred resonates with so many people.
I mean,

419
00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:30.700
I think that the giving you documentary is brilliantly and perfectly done.

420
00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:34.180
I think the Thompson means something different with Donald Trump as president of

421
00:22:34.181 --> 00:22:38.350
the United States.
To me,
you people could see before given the taught before,

422
00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.470
other like,
um,
brilliant writers sought before.
[inaudible] did.

423
00:22:41.471 --> 00:22:44.290
But when Donald Trump became president of the United States,

424
00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:47.790
it was a lens onto the past I felt like.
And I was uh,

425
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.160
I mean I'm a bitch ass liberal.
Like I was fucking upset.

426
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:55.410
And so one of the ways I dealt with it was to just remove myself to 1968,

427
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.130
1967,
1969.

428
00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.460
And I took the emotion I had and the present and I realized that Thompson is,

429
00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.650
is such a voice right now for people that maybe don't know him,

430
00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.410
only know him through fear and loathing in Las Vegas,
Terry Gilliam's film,

431
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:10.210
I would like freaking do to be a lens that now if they read that they could then

432
00:23:10.211 --> 00:23:14.320
read his work and perhaps you know what his timelessness will come through.

433
00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:15.131
It was more,

434
00:23:15.131 --> 00:23:18.490
it was an attempt to focus that timelessness and that what helped was the

435
00:23:18.491 --> 00:23:20.500
fucking terror of our present.
Yeah.

436
00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:24.250
You can see the definitely see the parallels and in his work,

437
00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:28.870
you know who also a rings true like that is a lot of Bill Hicks stuff on the

438
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:33.610
first Gulf War,
you know,
and,
and Bush as a president and you know,

439
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:38.390
butch,
obviously people today would probably be dying to have bushes president,

440
00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:40.390
you know,
the original Bart,

441
00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.820
he carried his book around for two weeks at least to carry the book.
Well,

442
00:23:42.821 --> 00:23:46.710
Herbert Walker,
the main,
the older Bush who was,
uh,
you know,

443
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:50.480
much more of a reasonable gentlemen,
you know.
Yeah.

444
00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.080
Well that's our discourse today too.

445
00:23:52.081 --> 00:23:55.310
Were there couldn't be anything said reasonably about him when he passed away or

446
00:23:55.311 --> 00:23:59.180
even about his wife.
I mean,
I think it's not,
he's not very favorable right now,

447
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:01.760
but one of the hundred Thompson's main influences was Norman mailer.

448
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.850
And I don't think Norman mailer rights well about women.
You know,
I think that's,

449
00:24:04.851 --> 00:24:07.430
I think Thompson wrote better about women.
Thompson didn't just,

450
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.480
what's the red bubbles him,
but I'm not familiar with.
Well,
Malin,

451
00:24:10.481 --> 00:24:11.390
whenever he writes about a woman,

452
00:24:11.391 --> 00:24:14.840
it's like he's watching the Nixon Nets get off the Nixon airplane.
And he's like,

453
00:24:14.841 --> 00:24:18.310
there were 33 redheads,
like five had long legs like this.
Like it's like,
man,

454
00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.000
like you didn't need to write that fucking passage.

455
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.610
You're writing about power and people more extreme than you.

456
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.850
So I think Miller writes beautifully about men that have more power than him.

457
00:24:25.851 --> 00:24:28.130
And so he writes about 1968 Chicago,

458
00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.820
we're Thompson didn't cause Thompson was beat up and he writes about that moment

459
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.550
of,
um,
we're Thompson's being beat up.
I'm confused.

460
00:24:34.551 --> 00:24:36.620
But what does the criticism of the way he's writing about women?

461
00:24:36.621 --> 00:24:39.860
Just he's describing them physically.
Uh,
the male gaze is that he will,

462
00:24:39.861 --> 00:24:43.130
he stabbed his wife.
He stabbed his wife in the heart.
Did he really?
Yeah.

463
00:24:43.131 --> 00:24:45.590
With the pen knife.
What?
Yeah,
he went to Bellevue.

464
00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.670
He went to Bellevue for 14 days.
It was in 19 six.
That's it.
He missed it.
Yeah.
No,

465
00:24:49.671 --> 00:24:50.770
he went to,
he did a psychiatrist.

466
00:24:50.771 --> 00:24:53.090
A psychiatric evaluation instead of going to jail.
Well,

467
00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:56.630
I think they stayed married,
but yeah.
Well I want a reasonable lady.

468
00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.590
So gender politics later.

469
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:07.160
But I would say that Thompson wrote well better about women because he

470
00:25:07.161 --> 00:25:09.470
understood that running about people with more power than you is really

471
00:25:09.471 --> 00:25:12.050
important.
And when mailer writes about people with more power than him,

472
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.050
when he writes about Mayor Daley beating the shit out of everybody,

473
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:16.820
he writes really beautifully.

474
00:25:16.821 --> 00:25:20.720
And that's somebody that's resonating right now with what Trump's doing.

475
00:25:20.721 --> 00:25:22.190
And with the violence that we're seeing on the right.

476
00:25:22.191 --> 00:25:26.780
And on the left were mailer was sitting with a Pat Buchanan who was Nixon's main

477
00:25:26.781 --> 00:25:28.130
aid.
Um,

478
00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:32.720
and during that moment in Chicago in the Haymarket in shattered and everybody

479
00:25:32.721 --> 00:25:36.320
was beat up and they were looking down from the 17th floor and mailers thinking

480
00:25:36.321 --> 00:25:38.960
like,
well this is what happens if police take over society.

481
00:25:38.961 --> 00:25:42.710
And he writes beautifully about how the police came and split the protesters

482
00:25:42.711 --> 00:25:44.510
because he's so high up writing it.
It's gorgeous.

483
00:25:44.511 --> 00:25:46.250
And you can end would write later.

484
00:25:46.251 --> 00:25:49.790
Like I knew that Nixon was going to be president of the United States because of

485
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:54.080
fucking Hubert Humphrey that cutlass hold ward heeler can't control his own

486
00:25:54.081 --> 00:25:58.700
convention and his own party.
How is he going to be able to run the country?

487
00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.100
And so as soon as Chicago's violence erupted,

488
00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.720
the Nixon campaign knew they'd won the election.
Patty.

489
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:09.020
And it's really interesting because even though a hunter would shit on him,

490
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:12.950
pappy Canon,
they were freshly fan.
No,
they drank,
they drank at the Watergate.

491
00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.220
Like they sat there and went deep like all night.
But he definitely,

492
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:18.440
hunter definitely shit on him.
Oh,
he shit on them hard.

493
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:22.040
That'd be Kinda Shit back on him hard.
The first night they met was at the Nixon.

494
00:26:22.041 --> 00:26:27.041
I'm at the w at the Holiday Inn in 1968 in New Hampshire during Nixon's come

495
00:26:27.431 --> 00:26:31.520
back campaign and Thompson walks in and peck peck,
he can't,
he goes,

496
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.840
who's this damn guy with the damn ski jacket walking through our Goddamn lobby

497
00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.630
and Tufts.
It's like,
I have a press pass,
like I'm here to do this.

498
00:26:38.631 --> 00:26:40.550
And so they like have this big moment.

499
00:26:40.551 --> 00:26:43.180
And then later on that night Thompson goes to a party with,
um,

500
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.670
campaign people and with,
um,
uh,

501
00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:49.350
Heenan and he brings a big bottle of wild Turkey.
And so we can,

502
00:26:49.351 --> 00:26:52.200
as a young journalist at the time he worked at the Saint Louis Post dispatch,

503
00:26:52.201 --> 00:26:55.020
I think he'd gone to the Columbia journalism school is working for Nixon.

504
00:26:55.021 --> 00:26:57.600
This is main policy guy and he looks at Toms.
He's like,

505
00:26:57.601 --> 00:27:00.030
that's the fucking the ski.
Oh you got a bottle of Wa.

506
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:02.370
Oh if you've got a file it old crow,
like no little drink that.

507
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.280
Instead they stayed up all night and they talked about the Vietnam War and

508
00:27:05.281 --> 00:27:06.270
Thompson,
you know,

509
00:27:06.271 --> 00:27:09.570
talked about how it does figures us to be in a foreign war that's unjust and it

510
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:13.710
destroys our democratic ideals to be doing that and became was like containment,

511
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.880
nuclear war.

512
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.400
We're trying to get out of it and they listened to each other until dawn,

513
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.920
like that first night that they met now.

514
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:24.510
What was your idea behind writing this book?
Like what?
What compelled you?

515
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.130
I think we've mistaken Thompson.

516
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.380
I think that we see them more as like a Doonesbury character.

517
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.150
I think people who know him really well don't.

518
00:27:30.151 --> 00:27:34.320
But I think that most people through whatever cultural forces that we've had,

519
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.180
those legacies and boys,

520
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:39.210
because a lot of people don't know the comparison what the Doonesbury.

521
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.030
So I think in the eighties or seventies,
eighties,
nineties,

522
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:45.330
that cartoon Doonesbury by Gary Trudeau,
it became,

523
00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.310
there was a character on it called Uncle Duke.

524
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.850
And Uncle Duke was based on Hunter Thompson and he was kind of an exaggerated

525
00:27:50.851 --> 00:27:55.090
version of Hunter Thompson.
He was a cartoonish version of hunters Thompson.

526
00:27:55.091 --> 00:27:59.550
And I think Terry Gilliam did a wonderful and kind of a tourist job on,

527
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.970
um,
uh,
like a brilliant job on fear and loathing in Las Vegas.

528
00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:05.820
But that's also an exaggerated version of Hunter Thompson.

529
00:28:05.821 --> 00:28:09.000
And we forget today the amount of work a hundred Thompson did,

530
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:10.260
the effort he put out,

531
00:28:10.261 --> 00:28:13.320
we forget that he was a straight journalist where he did the freelance

532
00:28:13.321 --> 00:28:13.741
assignments.

533
00:28:13.741 --> 00:28:16.350
He wrote the straight articles for years to make money for his family.

534
00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.560
And it wasn't until he had his breakthrough with hell's angels that he could

535
00:28:19.561 --> 00:28:22.320
develop the style that we identify with today.

536
00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:26.520
And so it kills me that we identify him more as a clown or like a,
you know,

537
00:28:26.521 --> 00:28:30.690
more as a,
a cartoonish figure as opposed to a very serious political thinker,

538
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:35.610
political activist and serious writer who can give us insight into the fucking

539
00:28:35.611 --> 00:28:39.290
shit show we experience every moment today.
Well,
I think the,

540
00:28:39.291 --> 00:28:41.820
the perception of him is fairly nuanced.

541
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:44.670
I don't think that everybody thinks of him as a cartoon character,

542
00:28:44.671 --> 00:28:47.280
although particularly later on in his life,

543
00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.740
he was relegated to that because he really didn't speak well.
You know,

544
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:54.000
later on his life when he was just,

545
00:28:54.001 --> 00:28:57.900
the drugs had taken over alcohol and the alcohol his son writes about the

546
00:28:57.901 --> 00:29:00.420
alcohol.
One writes so beautifully about the toll.

547
00:29:00.421 --> 00:29:04.380
Alcoholism took on hunter s Thompson.
We couldn't talk anymore.
I mean,

548
00:29:04.381 --> 00:29:08.220
when he was deep into his sixties is our bars of them.
Sarah,

549
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.950
it was so hard to even understand him.

550
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:15.660
There's a awful piece that he did with Conan O'brien or Conan,

551
00:29:15.661 --> 00:29:18.420
went to a woody creek and shotguns,
uh,

552
00:29:18.421 --> 00:29:22.410
off the back porch with him and you could barely understand a fucking word

553
00:29:22.411 --> 00:29:23.160
hunter saying,

554
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.030
that's why I tried to end it with Nixon leaving because it was really sad when

555
00:29:27.031 --> 00:29:30.000
Nixon resigned.
100.
Thompson was at the Connecticut Hilton,

556
00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:33.050
which is a hotel right by the White House.
Any Liebowitz,
um,

557
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.300
the photographer with rolling stone was calling him and saying,

558
00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.810
we need to get to the White House.
Nixon is a leaving,

559
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.250
like he's going to get on the,
and Thompson

560
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:46.900
<v 1>just laid in the grass and he didn't go,
you know,
and that was heartbreaking.</v>

561
00:29:46.901 --> 00:29:49.690
And he didn't end up writing the eight page spread that he needed to.
Instead,

562
00:29:49.691 --> 00:29:53.670
it became,
Annie Liebowitz is photography,
which was a famous and,
um,

563
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.080
in retrospect,
like huge move for her career.

564
00:29:56.081 --> 00:30:00.250
But I think that that pain right there of thinking that he'd spent 10 years,

565
00:30:00.251 --> 00:30:02.810
I mean,
he hated Nixon since the checkers speech,
you know,

566
00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.780
and Nixon was the VP for Eisenhower.

567
00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:09.420
He hated Nixon since 1962 when Nixon lost the California,
um,

568
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:13.870
uh,
uh,
governor ship and said,
you and the press,

569
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.360
you've been giving me the shaft for so long,

570
00:30:16.361 --> 00:30:18.700
like you won't have Dick Nixon to kick around anymore.

571
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.310
Like Thompson had seen that Nixon was somebody who said,

572
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:26.450
I'm just the poor son of a butcher.
I'm just this like very hardworking,
you know,

573
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:30.070
American that represents all of us were be behind that.

574
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:34.240
Like he was a politically,
um,
you know,

575
00:30:34.241 --> 00:30:38.230
ravenous monster who was anticommunist who would go to any extent to win.

576
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.790
And Thompson saw that and Thompson knew that other people saw in,
in 1964,

577
00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.100
the Barry Goldwater convention in San Francisco,

578
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.410
my favorite Lee named arena of all time,
the cow palace.
Um,

579
00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:51.880
Barry Goldwater was going to speak to accept the nomination.

580
00:30:51.881 --> 00:30:54.160
And what happened was Nixon was introducing them.

581
00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:57.670
It was Nixon's way back from the wilderness.
Thompson was a few rows back.

582
00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.190
The first time.
Thompson I think was that close to see him live.

583
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:03.850
And Nixon was like,
you know,
poor son of a butcher.
Don't think about me.

584
00:31:03.851 --> 00:31:07.480
Just think about Barry Goldwater.
Mr Conservative who become Mr President.

585
00:31:07.481 --> 00:31:11.560
And Thompson was like,
fuck everybody here knows he's lying.

586
00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:15.220
What they think that that act of lying is a skill and the way a used car

587
00:31:15.221 --> 00:31:17.170
salesman who lies but can make a lot of money off.

588
00:31:17.171 --> 00:31:21.280
It was skillful the way that Trump by selling steaks to people and then they go

589
00:31:21.281 --> 00:31:22.420
bankrupt and he gets rich.

590
00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:26.260
That's an American skill and Thompson sense that from the start with Nixon.

591
00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:30.130
And so I think he battled against Nixon for a decade,
for a lot of years.

592
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.650
And when Nixon left,
I think he felt spent.

593
00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.980
And so I tried not to focus on the later,
you know,

594
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:38.210
I ended then in [inaudible] 74 because I think it's,

595
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.920
he wrote some beautiful things afterwards,
still

596
00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:41.630
<v 2>aggressively.</v>

597
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:45.240
He definitely had some moments where he decided to not do the assignment that he

598
00:31:45.241 --> 00:31:50.220
was supposed to do.
And it was kinda sad.
Like I'm the Ali foreman fight.

599
00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:54.090
Fucking floated in the pool.
Yeah.
Float in the pool with a Nixon mask on,

600
00:31:54.091 --> 00:31:57.510
flew all the way to Africa and miss one of the greatest sports moments.

601
00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:00.870
It was like six of 'em,
you know,
um,
you know,

602
00:32:00.871 --> 00:32:02.610
the Boston red sox versus the reds.

603
00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:06.330
I think Ali was something different to people then.
I think it's,

604
00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.450
I don't think we have someone like that today.

605
00:32:09.451 --> 00:32:13.800
So it's very difficult for us to understand if people today look at Ali and

606
00:32:13.801 --> 00:32:18.600
they'd go,
oh,
he was a heavyweight boxing champion.
He was way more than that.

607
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:19.580
He was,
uh,

608
00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:24.700
a cultural figure that represented the resistance to the Vietnam War and

609
00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:29.900
represented it with the biggest loss that any public figure it ever shown and

610
00:32:29.971 --> 00:32:34.770
willingly gave up three years of his career in his prime from age 27 to 30.

611
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:39.980
From 1967 from the Cleveland Big Cat Williams.
He

612
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.840
<v 0>didn't fight again for three years.
He didn't train.
He didn't do anything.</v>

613
00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:47.900
They kept him from his career.
Why?
When he was in his prime,

614
00:32:47.901 --> 00:32:49.580
when he was the best heavyweight of all time,

615
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:53.600
and he spoke publicly and often,

616
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.120
and we was fucking hate it all over the country.

617
00:32:56.121 --> 00:32:58.700
But he represented something different.
Like,
uh,

618
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.420
my parents were hippies and when I was a little kid,

619
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:06.660
he lost to Leon Spinks and the rematch was on talent.
Shit.

620
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:12.060
My parents never watched TV and they definitely never watched boxing.
And they,

621
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:16.130
they,
they sat in front of that TV to watch that.
I remember thinking,

622
00:33:16.131 --> 00:33:19.910
I can't believe my parents want to watch a boxing match.
Like this is crazy.

623
00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.950
And I was probably like,
I don't know,

624
00:33:21.951 --> 00:33:24.140
maybe eight or nine years old or something at the time.

625
00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.280
And I just remember thinking,

626
00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.700
I can't believe my parents want to watch a boxing match.

627
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.910
And that's where really when it's sunk into me at a really early age,

628
00:33:31.911 --> 00:33:36.560
that this guy was not just this heavyweight boxer.

629
00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:41.360
He was,
he was,
uh,
a cultural icon.
He was a historical figure.

630
00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.950
He meant he meant a lot.
And to hunter,
he met a lot.
He meant something,

631
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:50.300
something much bigger than just just a boxer.

632
00:33:50.301 --> 00:33:52.940
And so hunter thought he was going to a death sentence.

633
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.290
George Foreman had crushed Joe Frazier.
He crushed everybody.
I mean,

634
00:33:57.291 --> 00:33:59.090
he was so powerful.

635
00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:02.900
George Foreman to this day is one of the all time scariest heavyweights.

636
00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.940
Wall time without a doubt.
He,

637
00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:09.950
he could hit so fucking hard and literally pick guys off their feet.

638
00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:14.930
He hit Joe Frazier and lifted him off his feet with a punch and uh,

639
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:18.830
everybody was convinced that was going to happen to Ali that Ali had been past

640
00:34:18.831 --> 00:34:23.120
its prime.
And look,
just look at what George Foreman had done to Joe Frazier.

641
00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:27.350
What is he going to do to Muhammad Ali and Ali just rope a dope them until he

642
00:34:27.351 --> 00:34:29.900
got tired and then fucked him up in front of the whole world.

643
00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:34.670
This is one of the greatest athletic moments.
I mean we forget that athletes,

644
00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.060
athletes like curt flood,
you know,
they,
they risked.
Who's that weight?

645
00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:42.650
Curt flood was the American baseball player who challenged the reserve clause

646
00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:47.270
cause it baseball.
You weren't allowed to get free agency for another team.

647
00:34:47.271 --> 00:34:48.920
And curt flood was this great player and he was like,

648
00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.530
I'm going to sit out and I'm going to wait.
Athletes like Colin Kaepernick,

649
00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:52.820
they've sacrificed that career.

650
00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:57.040
It's not the same with Muhammad Ali who was like Babe Ruth and Barry bonds and

651
00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:01.100
like any money combined at that one moment.
Right.
But he was risking,

652
00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.150
it's the opposite of Trump.

653
00:35:02.151 --> 00:35:06.800
Trump used his celebrity to become this even more mangled version of himself and

654
00:35:06.801 --> 00:35:07.634
get more power.

655
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:12.680
They use his celebrity to speak for his virtue in his value and his beliefs and

656
00:35:12.681 --> 00:35:15.470
sat like Thomson was really good at understanding what people sacrifice.

657
00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:19.400
But people have to give up the wager,
you know,
between what that act will be,

658
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.490
what the results will be.
They may be later,
but he knew that.

659
00:35:22.491 --> 00:35:26.870
And so his respect for Ali for giving up those years of his prime,

660
00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.650
you know,
was,
was enduring.

661
00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:32.870
He Keep Thompson came back from that fight and he gave his son on one a boxing

662
00:35:32.871 --> 00:35:37.010
gloves,
um,
that,
um,
or we're,
uh,
at least boxing gloves.
Wow.

663
00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.330
Yeah.
It's a very,

664
00:35:39.331 --> 00:35:42.510
very unfortunate that he missed out fight because it would have been fascinating

665
00:35:42.511 --> 00:35:46.470
to hear his take on it.
To me.
I'm sure he would've been so moved.
20 saw Ali win,

666
00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:48.120
but it wasn't,
I mean that's a good point.

667
00:35:48.121 --> 00:35:52.230
It was indicative of I think the stress and the pressure that the last decade of

668
00:35:52.231 --> 00:35:55.110
covering Nixon had taken out on him.
Well,
there's a little bit of that,

669
00:35:55.111 --> 00:35:57.840
but let's be honest,
he was also kind of a fuck up.

670
00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.630
I mean when he was writing for rolling stone and they gave him that,

671
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:04.470
that early fax machine show.
Yeah,
and he would fuck that thing up.

672
00:36:04.471 --> 00:36:06.150
You would unplug it and plug it back in.

673
00:36:06.151 --> 00:36:09.150
He would do it just so he could go to the bar and say,
this thing doesn't work.

674
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:12.060
But that was the end.
I think of his arc where he was still on point.

675
00:36:12.061 --> 00:36:14.520
He was still playing the role of a serious journalist and he would use that

676
00:36:14.521 --> 00:36:17.790
persona as a fuckup and there's letters by yon winter being like,

677
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.720
you cannot turn in your articles three hours before we go to press.

678
00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:24.900
I know you made it.
This doesn't fucking work.

679
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:27.930
And so he was beginning to break down.
Then he was also,

680
00:36:27.931 --> 00:36:31.800
I think on the tail end of his decade of being a journalist who had met every

681
00:36:31.801 --> 00:36:35.340
deadline so that he could fucking feed his family and he could afford how far,

682
00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.580
like there were moments where he wouldn't before he got the,
um,

683
00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:43.050
contract for hell's angels in 1965 he was ready to be like a longshoreman.

684
00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.260
He was going and looking for work in the mornings in San Francisco,
you know,

685
00:36:46.261 --> 00:36:47.520
to try to support his family.

686
00:36:47.521 --> 00:36:50.880
He was willing to give up writing and instead that article blew up and he,

687
00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.570
all these beautiful letters began to arrive at three 19 Parnassus where he lived

688
00:36:54.571 --> 00:36:59.280
at,
um,
at the top of the Haight Ashbury and I'm San Francisco and you know,

689
00:36:59.281 --> 00:37:01.050
that opened up his chance to continue being a writer,

690
00:37:01.051 --> 00:37:03.780
but money was the main motivating factor.

691
00:37:03.781 --> 00:37:06.720
And so I think once money like unfurled,

692
00:37:06.721 --> 00:37:10.800
once alcoholism I think took its toll and once he couldn't walk around anymore

693
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:14.340
attic political camp convention without people just like grabbing his shoulder

694
00:37:14.341 --> 00:37:16.380
and saying,
you're a hunter Thompson.
As that happened,

695
00:37:16.381 --> 00:37:18.210
I think things began to change.
Yeah.

696
00:37:18.211 --> 00:37:20.550
That's one of the things that he talked about that I thought was really

697
00:37:20.551 --> 00:37:24.240
interesting that he became a part of the story.

698
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.990
It wasn't just that he was covering stories,
he couldn't be anonymous anymore.

699
00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:32.550
He was in many cases,
more famous in the people that he was covering.
Yeah.

700
00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.000
You know,
like when he would go to meet Nixon,
all Nikki Nixon,

701
00:37:36.001 --> 00:37:39.150
secret service agents wanted to meet him and they wanted us to get an autograph

702
00:37:39.151 --> 00:37:42.750
from him and shake his hand and it was just too weird.
Everything had got.

703
00:37:42.751 --> 00:37:47.400
And then there's the alcoholism,
alcoholism.
Look it,

704
00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:51.060
it's a depressant.
It wrecks you.
And if you read,
you know,
we,

705
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:55.260
me and Greg Fitzsimmons on a podcast once read off,
uh,

706
00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:00.450
that one journalist who had a detailed hunters daily routine.

707
00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.200
And so we,
we read the daily routine and they put a techno beat to it.

708
00:38:04.201 --> 00:38:07.860
It's fucking hilarious.
That was a bad,
that's a set.
Those are so,

709
00:38:07.861 --> 00:38:10.260
it's so funny because those seem funny,
you know now,

710
00:38:10.261 --> 00:38:14.060
but they're kind of the death knell.
Like,
I mean that,
that daily routine,
um,

711
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:18.090
that was,
um,
the,
the biography hunter,
it was in that and it's just,

712
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.650
it's heartbreaking.
I mean,

713
00:38:19.651 --> 00:38:22.230
we've got to remember that the dedication to fear and loathing in Las Vegas was

714
00:38:22.231 --> 00:38:25.350
he who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain man.

715
00:38:25.351 --> 00:38:28.620
And I think the world was painful for a Hunter Thompson and it was painful to

716
00:38:28.621 --> 00:38:31.250
see powerful people abused the week,
you know,

717
00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:34.560
and like take what they wanted brazenly without being held accountable.

718
00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:36.310
I think it hard to deal with shitty editors

719
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.670
<v 1>who cut half your fucking essay on Nixon or half her story and made it into</v>

720
00:38:39.671 --> 00:38:42.720
something that had nothing to do with the effort that you put out.
You know,

721
00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:44.800
I think it was hard to pay your bills and you know,

722
00:38:44.801 --> 00:38:49.340
live the way that you wanted to live.
And I think a lot of that gets undermined.

723
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.810
I just want people to realize how much effort he put out,

724
00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.270
especially during those years where he was like,
all right,

725
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.210
I want to be a great journalist.
I want to have a voice in our society.

726
00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.340
I want to participate in our national conversation.

727
00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:04.510
My only path towards that is to work harder than everybody else to be at places

728
00:39:04.511 --> 00:39:07.360
when things happen and when they matter.
And he sacrificed a lot for that,

729
00:39:07.361 --> 00:39:10.360
but he was there and he's a voice in a light that we can have in this moment,

730
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.360
which is another troubling moment in American history.
Yeah.

731
00:39:13.361 --> 00:39:15.070
His voice was very unique too,

732
00:39:15.071 --> 00:39:19.750
in that he decided to combine fiction with nonfiction in a very weird,

733
00:39:19.751 --> 00:39:21.340
blurry way.
I think it was.

734
00:39:21.341 --> 00:39:25.600
So one thing I think of is he usually gives you a cue where what he did was he

735
00:39:25.601 --> 00:39:29.920
dramatize,
people didn't dramatize [inaudible] shit up.

736
00:39:29.921 --> 00:39:33.250
He didn't just dramatize.
There's a rumor.
It's doctor,

737
00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:36.910
I didn't say that he did able gate.
I said there was,

738
00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:39.000
this is about Ed Muskie's campaign.
Um,

739
00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:42.790
I said there was a rumor in Milwaukee that he did up again.
I started that rumor.

740
00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.170
Yeah.
I mean,
that's what he says,

741
00:39:44.171 --> 00:39:46.990
but what did he said that on the Dick Cavett show?
Yeah.
Later.

742
00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.540
And I think Matt Taibbi on this show talked about it.

743
00:39:49.541 --> 00:39:53.290
Well where my thing is that,
um,
muskie was already out of the campaign.

744
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:55.480
When that came out,
muskie had already lost.

745
00:39:55.780 --> 00:40:00.400
And so muskie had been a fucking monster and a terrible person on that campaign.

746
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:05.410
And so Thompson use that version of Musky and wrote,
as Toby said,

747
00:40:05.411 --> 00:40:09.160
in a very straight way,
the Ibogaine story.
And so if you had a sense of irony,

748
00:40:09.161 --> 00:40:10.030
you kind of knew,

749
00:40:10.031 --> 00:40:13.000
like you're not really thinking that this is a guy who did able gain.

750
00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.880
So I think there's queues in there for our listening audience.

751
00:40:15.881 --> 00:40:18.960
But what I think is even more,
uh,
you know what,

752
00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:22.420
I think he dramatize the way other people didn't.
He would say,
I look left,

753
00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:25.510
I look up,
I see.
He came down to me and then he said,

754
00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:28.750
people didn't write like that in journalism.
They didn't go step by step.

755
00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.550
And he did.
And that was really important.

756
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:32.740
What I think is more important than the Ibogaine story.

757
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:35.830
So the biggest story in the background is Ed Muskie was the front runner for the

758
00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:40.690
Democratic primary in 1972.
He fucked up his campaign afterwards.

759
00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:43.910
Thompson talked about how he had heard that there are,

760
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.210
there was a rumor that this candidate was doing,
it began,

761
00:40:46.211 --> 00:40:50.840
which is like Iowasca or he said no,
it's not like Iowasca it's not,

762
00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:54.700
no,
it's very different.
So hallucinatory,
it's a self examined Tori.

763
00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:58.000
I was the one who get off,
get off.
Yeah.
Um,

764
00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.620
but he said they brought in a Brazilian,
which yeah,

765
00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:04.360
Ibogaine is not even a Brazilian drugs from Africa,

766
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:08.770
but what I think people don't remember is before that and this affected the

767
00:41:08.771 --> 00:41:12.940
election.
And um,
February of 1972 Thompson was in Florida.

768
00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:14.800
He was on something called the sunshine special.

769
00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:16.960
It was a whistle stop tour that Musky,

770
00:41:16.961 --> 00:41:20.890
the front runner had a good chance to beat Nixon,
pull numbers wise,
um,

771
00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.150
was um,

772
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:27.400
going all the way down the Florida peninsula on to try to win the Florida

773
00:41:27.401 --> 00:41:31.870
primary.
And Thompson was like,
this is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.

774
00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:34.700
Like at every stop Musky give the same shit speech.

775
00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:38.660
It's like somebody should be your president,
namely me.
And it was repeated.

776
00:41:38.661 --> 00:41:41.240
The reporters were like,
fucking,
this is terrible.

777
00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:44.270
Muskie was secluded in the back of the car.
He didn't interact with anybody.

778
00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:45.770
They had his,
um,

779
00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:50.570
political operatives come out and make everybody like sing the song like,
um,

780
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:53.780
about like Musky,
like sunshine in his hands,
the whole world in his hands.

781
00:41:53.781 --> 00:41:58.550
It was terrible.
And so that night Thompson pulled into a Florida town.

782
00:41:58.551 --> 00:42:02.300
It was the second to last stop and he and this young political reporter named

783
00:42:02.301 --> 00:42:07.100
Monte Chitty where I'm going to get a drink at 2:00 AM and this guy walks into

784
00:42:07.101 --> 00:42:11.120
the lobby.
He's like six,
six,
two 50 Peter Sheridan.

785
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:15.550
And he,
um,
he walks in and he,
um,
he says he's looking for the muskie campaign,

786
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.230
all these different things.

787
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:19.640
He ends up going out with them a hundred tops in for a drink and a hundred

788
00:42:19.641 --> 00:42:23.360
Thompson finds out that Peter Sheridan had been a good friend of Jerry Garcia,

789
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:28.370
had hung out with the hell's angels in California,
had been to the Honda,

790
00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:32.450
where can Casey was and was actually a pretty smart guy who was out of his mind

791
00:42:32.451 --> 00:42:35.330
in his mid twenties.
They stayed out and drink all night at the end of the night.

792
00:42:35.331 --> 00:42:37.310
Thompson's like,
so what are you doing tomorrow?
Where you going?

793
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:42.400
And Peter Sharon was like,
well,
I'm going to Miami and thumps.

794
00:42:42.401 --> 00:42:45.320
It's like we are too.
You don't have to hitchhike.
Fuck that.

795
00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:49.360
And so there's a really good journalist.
I'm outlaw.
Um,
it's called,
uh,
um,

796
00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:52.610
journalists by bill McKean,
the tea,
another Thompson biography.

797
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:55.880
It talks about how Thompson took his thumbs and took his press pass,

798
00:42:55.881 --> 00:42:58.370
put it into the elevator,
press the button,

799
00:42:58.371 --> 00:43:02.000
sent the press pass down to the ground floor.
Peter shared in,
got it.

800
00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:06.470
So Peter Sheridan could ride for free on the Sunshine Express Down to Miami the

801
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.920
next day.

802
00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:10.460
So Thompson over sleeps because the fucking muskie campaign doesn't like him.

803
00:43:10.461 --> 00:43:11.240
Anyways,

804
00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.470
instead Peter Sheridan gets on the sunshine express with a Hunter Thompson Press

805
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:19.130
Badge and Peter Sheridan goes on to order 12 martinis and he goes,

806
00:43:19.131 --> 00:43:23.570
give me like a triple gin bucks.
Hold the buck.
And he runs up and down the car.

807
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:27.590
And you know,
Musky has been a really shitty candidate at this point.

808
00:43:27.591 --> 00:43:28.700
He's not been engaging people.

809
00:43:28.701 --> 00:43:32.840
He got in this weird fight with his wife at am a campaign event where they like

810
00:43:32.841 --> 00:43:34.070
put cake in each other's face.

811
00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:36.290
It's been really weird and people aren't reporting on it,

812
00:43:36.291 --> 00:43:38.960
like other reporters aren't saying muskies unstable.

813
00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:40.880
And so Musky at the end of this whistle stop,

814
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:44.450
he spent all his campaign money to go up and down and try to do this whistle

815
00:43:44.451 --> 00:43:48.650
stop tour.
He gives the speech,
the caboose and Jerry Ruben,

816
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:52.850
the antiwar activist who was,
what are the Chicago seven,
um,
and was um,

817
00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:57.680
it has come to heckle him,
is in the crowd and he's saying to mosquito,

818
00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:02.210
so why did you support the Vietnam War in 1968?
Like,
who do you think you are?

819
00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:05.900
And so muskies yelling at Jerry Ruben,
he's saying,
young man,

820
00:44:05.901 --> 00:44:10.280
keep your mouth shut beneath Musky reaching up from the bottom of that caboose.

821
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:15.550
Peter Sheridan is holding a gin bottle and grabbing it muskies leg as Musky

822
00:44:16.251 --> 00:44:19.070
tries to give the speech and then Musky falls back in.

823
00:44:19.071 --> 00:44:22.580
The whole thing ends like the whole press conferences over like women's wear

824
00:44:22.581 --> 00:44:27.581
daily reported this and it came out that Hunter Thompson had had 13 Martinis and

825
00:44:27.651 --> 00:44:31.920
run up and down the train and had interfered with it and Muskie's campaign

826
00:44:31.921 --> 00:44:36.921
really believed that Thompson was working with Donald Segretti and Nixon's um,

827
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:41.670
creep,
um,
Watergate crew to fuck up muskie's campaign.

828
00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:44.040
And that actually changed the course.

829
00:44:44.041 --> 00:44:48.720
It like Thompson help expose how fucked up muskie was as a candidate at that

830
00:44:48.721 --> 00:44:49.230
time.

831
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:52.890
And Thompson had never forgiven Musky for being on the pro Vietnam War Platform

832
00:44:52.891 --> 00:44:54.510
at the 1968 convention.

833
00:44:54.511 --> 00:44:57.210
And so we talk about the implicate aspect of changing the campaign,

834
00:44:57.211 --> 00:45:00.630
but that report and the way that disseminated through media,

835
00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:04.560
the way it was picked up by other newspapers really did help change the people's

836
00:45:04.561 --> 00:45:08.910
perception of Ed Muskie,
big Ed Muskie as a top to call them at the time.

837
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:11.750
<v 2>No,
he,
when he wrote Hell's angels,</v>

838
00:45:11.751 --> 00:45:16.430
he hadn't really totally formulated that sort of Gonzo style of journalism,

839
00:45:16.431 --> 00:45:21.431
but he did have a little bit of fiction mixed in with that and that sort of ran

840
00:45:21.741 --> 00:45:26.330
him a foul of the hell a hell's angels.
They were very upset by that.
Right?

841
00:45:26.331 --> 00:45:30.500
Like he,
he did write some things in there that they claim or not

842
00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:34.830
<v 1>accurate.
I think that when it came to hell's angels,
um,</v>

843
00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:39.670
what Thompson did really well is what Joan Didion did really well.

844
00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:44.760
He took the way the media was portraying somebody and he strip that off and

845
00:45:45.101 --> 00:45:47.860
said,
this is who they actually are.
This is what they're actually doing.

846
00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:51.400
Joan Didion,
when she writes about Jim Morrison and the white album,
she's like,

847
00:45:51.401 --> 00:45:54.370
Jim Morrison was like sex and death in his leather pants was the best thing
ever.

848
00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:57.310
Everybody loves Jim Morrison.
And then in the scene and the white album,

849
00:45:57.311 --> 00:46:00.490
Joan Didion writes about how they sit at a recording studio for two hours and

850
00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:03.940
nobody says anything and they eat eggs out of a paper bag and it's a fucking

851
00:46:03.941 --> 00:46:07.570
nightmare.
Thompson knew that the media was sensationalizing the hell's angels.

852
00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:12.730
He went to them,
um,
on a cold night in San Francisco.
I'm down by the waterfront.

853
00:46:12.731 --> 00:46:16.330
And he said,
hey,
here's a Newsweek article.
Here's a time article.

854
00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:18.430
Here's how everybody's running about you.

855
00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:22.630
All I want to do is write the truth about who you are.
And he did.

856
00:46:22.631 --> 00:46:25.180
And he ended up writing with them.
Um,
and he ended up spending time with them.

857
00:46:25.181 --> 00:46:29.050
I don't think they got as mad at him about the way he portrayed them.

858
00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:34.080
I think they got mad that he began to make money or that he became famous.

859
00:46:34.331 --> 00:46:38.020
Hell's angels sold 500,000 paperback copies.

860
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:40.510
That is almost impossible to imagine today.

861
00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:43.270
500,000 people about copies of a literary book.

862
00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:45.040
And the angels were pissed off about that.

863
00:46:45.041 --> 00:46:48.160
They felt Thompson owed him more money or owed him something for that.

864
00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:52.130
Did he to them at all?
Did he give them any money?
Eddie Barker,
sunny burgers.

865
00:46:52.131 --> 00:46:54.940
So ridiculously buggers said he owed us a keg and he didn't give us a cake.

866
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.060
That's it.
You know,
and the,
the famous story at the end of it is that that is,

867
00:46:58.090 --> 00:46:59.920
I mean really like when they go through it,

868
00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:05.350
he said that he said the Thompson was doing a subjective version of us,

869
00:47:05.351 --> 00:47:08.740
but it was at least close to then the shitty Newsweek and time versions.

870
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:12.520
And so Thompson at the end of,
he'd finished the book,
barely made the deadline.

871
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:16.660
I had to go down to a hotel and Monterey lock himself in step for a hundred

872
00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.780
hours straight and write it in March of [inaudible] 67 to finish it.

873
00:47:19.781 --> 00:47:23.740
So it turns it in,
makes it is um,
advanced deadline in September.
They're like,

874
00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:26.620
here's our author photo and it's Shitty.
And he's like,
fuck this.

875
00:47:26.621 --> 00:47:28.330
So he goes to a hell's angels rally.

876
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:31.450
He know anybody because he hasn't been with them for six or seven months.

877
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.160
He's taking pictures.

878
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:37.360
That's when he got freed up for writing about the hell's angels and he tiny his

879
00:47:37.361 --> 00:47:41.230
friend who later committed suicide after Altima after being involved in the

880
00:47:41.231 --> 00:47:45.280
ultimate security situation.
Tyler rolling stone one where the younger stuff,
yes,

881
00:47:45.281 --> 00:47:48.740
where Meredith hunter was stabbed but tiny.
It was a woman that got stabbed,

882
00:47:48.741 --> 00:47:52.450
a man,
Meredith hunter.
Oh.
Um,
it was a man named Meredith.

883
00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:57.640
It was back in the day where you can name your kid's Meredith,
right?
Like Marion,

884
00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:01.630
Marion's another one.
Right.
Lindsey,

885
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.700
Lindsey.
Some guys were Lindsey to speak.
Gimme one Jamie.

886
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.220
Oh yeah.
But Jamie's normal.
Well,

887
00:48:09.221 --> 00:48:11.830
if there's a lot of January's a future man scene where it's like,

888
00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:16.330
what's his name is like,
my name is Susan in the future mentor named Susan.

889
00:48:16.331 --> 00:48:19.640
I know it's a girl's name and your time.
Um,

890
00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:23.010
but her death is a weird one though.
You must hate your fucking saw in the mail,

891
00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:28.010
but lose an argument with your wife.
But that
I've lost a lot of,

892
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:30.520
but that poor guy was,
um,

893
00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:33.640
but Thompson was there and tiny grabbed him after he was beat up.

894
00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:36.700
There's a guy holding a rock to drop it on.
Thompson with the hell's angels.

895
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:39.700
And tiny was like,
all right,
I know him.
I know the rest of you don't.

896
00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:42.160
And he grabbed him out and tiny.

897
00:48:42.161 --> 00:48:45.790
Was this like enormous hell's angel who had been,
you know,

898
00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:50.770
Thompson Weisberg good at empathetically understanding their flaws and their

899
00:48:50.771 --> 00:48:53.230
perspectives.
He'd never,
I think made excuses for him.

900
00:48:53.231 --> 00:48:57.030
He said that their inherent perspective as fascistic,
he writes that,
you know,

901
00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:00.220
he says they use violence to respond to where they weren't society.

902
00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.960
The idea of total retaliation.

903
00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:06.230
The hell's angels were any offense like looking at you funny or being like due

904
00:49:06.231 --> 00:49:09.160
to drink.
It could be met with everybody beating you up.

905
00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:10.600
Cause they got to determine the,

906
00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:12.550
they got the hell's angels got to determine the offense.

907
00:49:12.551 --> 00:49:17.110
Like that was fascism to Thompson and he wrote beautifully about their reliance

908
00:49:17.111 --> 00:49:19.420
on violence cause he,
they felt the hell's angels.

909
00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:23.050
They'd been left behind by our moderated society.
Like there's technology,

910
00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:24.430
there's all these new jobs.

911
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:27.760
If you came back from the war in 1950 you had a chance in Oakland to have a

912
00:49:27.761 --> 00:49:31.240
middle class life and a beautiful house in work the rest of your days and have a

913
00:49:31.241 --> 00:49:35.110
family that will then go on.
But by 1965,
that was no longer an option.

914
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.150
And the angels were a violent response to that.

915
00:49:37.151 --> 00:49:38.560
Very similar to what we're seeing now.

916
00:49:38.561 --> 00:49:40.000
And so the way he wrote about the hell's angels,

917
00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:43.840
it's very similar to the way that we see violence within groups that are

918
00:49:43.841 --> 00:49:45.970
supporting Trump.
You know,
it's going to lift and the right.

919
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:51.130
Did he ever wind up resolving his differences with the hell's angels?
I think so.

920
00:49:51.131 --> 00:49:54.940
Sunny Margaret healthy angels got fucked.
Like rightly so.
The hell's angels were,

921
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:59.920
you know,
pursued like a mob.
Um,
like a,
like a Mafia group.
People went to jail,

922
00:49:59.921 --> 00:50:01.590
sunny barker went to jail.
Um,

923
00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:06.100
I think they at the end appreciated his representation of them because it was

924
00:50:06.101 --> 00:50:09.490
better than any other ones.
There's no better representation of the house.

925
00:50:09.491 --> 00:50:12.680
Ain't no more sympathetic for sure.
Are just no more accurate.
No more understood.

926
00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:15.550
Yeah,
no more like,
again,
I guess the Thompsons effort,

927
00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:18.640
if you ride for six months with somebody and you're an honest,

928
00:50:18.641 --> 00:50:21.850
like putting up your hands,
you're not trying to fit what you see into a thesis,

929
00:50:21.851 --> 00:50:22.750
you're doing the opposite.

930
00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:26.320
Trying to look at the reality you have in front of you and then form an argument

931
00:50:26.321 --> 00:50:28.700
out of that.
You could hear it.
That's what Thompson's gift was.

932
00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:31.460
And very dangerous too to do that.
I mean,
I mean,

933
00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:33.980
he didn't get beat up taking those photographs,

934
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:37.160
really bad motorcycle accident with his friend on the pack and his friend broke

935
00:50:37.161 --> 00:50:40.130
his leg.
Like it was just,
we're tough.
That's why he left.
He's like,

936
00:50:40.131 --> 00:50:43.180
get the fuck out of San Francisco.
Yeah.
Chris looks amazing.
Like temperatures.

937
00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.830
It's amazing.
It's a,
it's a fire that you're putting your hand on to.

938
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:49.610
How can burnt ash?
He was coming down.
Um,
it was with the mayor of Richmond.

939
00:50:49.611 --> 00:50:53.360
He was coming down as slick road and they had,
um,
hit,
uh,

940
00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:56.930
like something was wet or an oil thing and it went out the back tire.

941
00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:01.760
So Thompson rolled it was fine,
but his friends knee hit,
um,
railroad tracks.

942
00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:06.110
So there's friends need broke really badly.
Um,
it was the mayor,

943
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:10.130
it was the mayor of Richmond and that's continued riding motorcycles though.
I,

944
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:12.650
yeah,
he did.
He would get in accidents at Woody Creek,

945
00:51:12.651 --> 00:51:15.920
but he was pretty careful like,
so I love that scene in Hell's angels.

946
00:51:15.921 --> 00:51:19.850
I don't know if readers,
our listeners know this,
but the edge,
you know,

947
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:23.510
and that's a major part of the book where Thompson's fighting with his wife,

948
00:51:23.511 --> 00:51:24.590
Thompson's finished his book,

949
00:51:24.591 --> 00:51:28.430
but he's breaking down because he's worked so hard to do it.
And so he takes his,

950
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:32.840
um,
Bsa out and he goes,
if you know San Francisco,
he goes out to the park,

951
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:37.370
he hits the Coast highway and he comes down and he's like,

952
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:40.520
I'm so overwhelmed.
Everything is so fucking terrible.

953
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:42.140
He's going as fast as he can.

954
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:45.490
And he talks about how his eyes began to lose moisture.
You,
you know the scene,

955
00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:46.910
it's this beautiful scene.

956
00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:50.570
He's looking for sand pits cause he hit a sandpit near the zoo.
You're fucking.

957
00:51:50.571 --> 00:51:52.910
Dot.
Yeah.
And he gets all the way to Rockaway beach,

958
00:51:52.911 --> 00:51:55.250
which is in like halfway down to Santa Cruz.

959
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:58.940
And he turns around and when he talks about is when he's at a hundred miles per

960
00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:02.180
hour and I think he was near death and he was really overwhelmed.
He says,

961
00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:03.561
you know,
the edge,

962
00:52:03.561 --> 00:52:07.280
the only people that know it are the people that have gone over the rest,

963
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:10.190
the living,
don't have any understanding of that.

964
00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.650
And all we can do is approach it in this way.

965
00:52:12.651 --> 00:52:15.530
And it's this beautiful and it's called midnight and the coast highway,

966
00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:19.130
it was a anthologized and Tom Wolfe,
you know,
and it was just beautiful.

967
00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:22.580
So he comes back and he sits at his desk and so he,

968
00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:24.050
he had a view of the bay bridge,

969
00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:27.170
he could see it's two flashing lights the whole time.

970
00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:30.170
And he had broken the window in a terrible fight with his wife like three weeks

971
00:52:30.171 --> 00:52:31.180
earlier.
Um,

972
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:35.420
and so he sits the broken window and he writes out that scene right away with

973
00:52:35.421 --> 00:52:39.230
his eyes still scoured of voicing the broken window when she wouldn't give him a

974
00:52:39.231 --> 00:52:42.020
gun cause he was on acid and he threw a shoe through the window.
There's three,

975
00:52:42.021 --> 00:52:42.980
there's three versions.

976
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:45.290
So I do it and then I give the three versions of the notes.

977
00:52:45.291 --> 00:52:48.980
So I go with the three versions that I've heard.
Like I heard it from her,

978
00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:54.230
you know,
she wrote,
I really respect sandy like deeply.
She wrote it the um,
uh,

979
00:52:54.231 --> 00:52:57.860
a few years ago she said,
I'm done giving interviews about Ana's Thompson.

980
00:52:57.861 --> 00:52:59.210
That was my life that it was then.

981
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:03.140
She's given so many interviews up to this point.
She says that that exists.

982
00:53:03.141 --> 00:53:07.100
And so I wanted to respect that more than anything and just use the information

983
00:53:07.101 --> 00:53:11.120
that I had or know and let the reader know,
Yo,
here at three other versions,

984
00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:14.960
here's the best version I could make.
Dramatize,
look left,
throw,
do this.

985
00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:18.270
Did you talk to Anita?
Anita has been great.
I had to talk to,

986
00:53:18.271 --> 00:53:21.060
we need a little bit.
The book ended so early that I did,

987
00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:24.980
there's a beautiful art as his second wife for homes and need a Thompson is um,

988
00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:28.740
she runs Al Farm.
She runs kind of his legacy.
She does the Facebook page.

989
00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:31.920
She has a wonderful job on what is our farm today.

990
00:53:31.921 --> 00:53:34.080
Does she still live up there and she's going to make it into a,

991
00:53:34.081 --> 00:53:37.440
like a writer's retreat.
She's doing a one off job,

992
00:53:37.441 --> 00:53:39.810
make it into a writer's retreat and also a,
um,

993
00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:44.760
like a museum and it's taken a while but to honor his legacy as a great

994
00:53:44.761 --> 00:53:47.910
political thinker and writer,
like a great literary light.

995
00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:51.000
But since she didn't meet him until the 90s,

996
00:53:51.001 --> 00:53:55.230
I wanted to focus on the time that I was in.
Um,
and so I,

997
00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:58.870
I think talking to Bob Geiger,
you know,
his friend then was,
was really,

998
00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:01.590
I was really lucky.
I'll go here.
He's in his late eighties,

999
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:04.140
and he was able to go through like,
cause I had,

1000
00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:05.610
I believe if you interview somebody,

1001
00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:07.710
you need to read everything that exists already.

1002
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.660
You need to read everything they've already said.

1003
00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:12.960
You don't want to ask them questions that when I do interview for research that

1004
00:54:12.961 --> 00:54:15.630
they've already supplied answers to them.
So with Bob Geiger,

1005
00:54:15.631 --> 00:54:18.810
I could see the holes or things I didn't know and I was able to sit with him,

1006
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:20.880
talk about throwing a football with Thompson,

1007
00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:23.700
talk about taking the dog to the beach,
like all these other things.

1008
00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:26.790
That's the football thing is an interesting thing cause he was who's obsessed

1009
00:54:26.791 --> 00:54:30.120
with football and that's one thing that he shared in common with Nixon.

1010
00:54:30.121 --> 00:54:35.121
And so when they went one time they were going to the airport and he hits to

1011
00:54:35.431 --> 00:54:39.840
ride with Nixon and Nixon wanted to talk to him about football and he said,

1012
00:54:39.841 --> 00:54:42.540
let's just not talk about politics when we talk about football.

1013
00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:45.810
And so he talks to my favorite,
the whole ride.
It was,

1014
00:54:45.811 --> 00:54:48.420
it was in 1968 Pat Buchanan had helped set it up.

1015
00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:51.630
They did out that week they'd become friends.
And so they come to Thompson,

1016
00:54:51.631 --> 00:54:53.820
they're like,
all right,
the boss is going to take a plane to Florida.

1017
00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:58.920
You can come and talk to him.
And so later Thompson said later,
it was like,

1018
00:54:58.921 --> 00:55:00.330
they told me not to talk about anything but football.

1019
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:04.590
But earlier Thompson said like,
I was just really awkward.
Like this fucking guy.

1020
00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:07.860
They're both in the back bench of a mercury and so it's before secret service.

1021
00:55:07.861 --> 00:55:11.310
So it's just a cop driving and it's like pappy candidate in the front and it's

1022
00:55:11.311 --> 00:55:14.010
Thompson and Nixon and they're right here next to each other.

1023
00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:17.910
And Thompson's like ledge.
You know,
earlier in the night you'd said that,

1024
00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:18.151
you know,

1025
00:55:18.151 --> 00:55:20.760
the Oakland Raiders had a good shot to beat the packers and Superbowl too.

1026
00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:22.590
Can you talk about that?
And he was like,

1027
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:25.920
Dick's is like my good friend Vince Lombardi had told me to watch out for the

1028
00:55:25.921 --> 00:55:29.010
AFL cause they pass and they can be very effective.

1029
00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:33.480
And so Thompson then like remembers that guy.
Um,
um,

1030
00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:35.940
Bob Geiger had been a professional quarterback.

1031
00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:39.630
He had taken Thompson to his first football game and Thompson said NFL is better

1032
00:55:39.631 --> 00:55:42.480
than the AFL and Geiger's like,
shut the fuck up,
let's go to a Raiders game.

1033
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:46.380
And they went and 65 and the Raiders won on this beautiful pass,
Tom Tom Flores,

1034
00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:50.220
like beautiful goal line pass.
And Nixon was saying the same thing.

1035
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:53.820
And so then at that moment,
at that moment Thompson's like,
oh yeah,

1036
00:55:53.821 --> 00:55:57.930
it was the Miami Guy,
uh,
Miller Miller who'd caught the pass in Nixon,

1037
00:55:57.931 --> 00:56:01.890
Gus Thompson and on the knee and Gus,
you're right and goes,
oh,

1038
00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:05.550
what a beautiful moment and tops.
It's just like,
what the fuck is going on?

1039
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.530
So Nixon apparently they were talking about like college draft picks and all

1040
00:56:10.531 --> 00:56:12.540
kinds of crazy shit.
Like Nixon was deep into it.

1041
00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:15.750
It was the only moment Thompson said that he knew Nixon wasn't lying.

1042
00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:18.990
They can talk about football and that in that instance,

1043
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:23.740
it's fascinating when people,
they're so diametrically to each other,

1044
00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:25.120
but they find common ground.

1045
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:28.060
Thompson did a great job of that and I think we've lost it today.
I mean,

1046
00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:30.130
you have to listen to the other side to,
if you,

1047
00:56:30.131 --> 00:56:32.690
if you politically want to beat somebody like flat pappy cannon,

1048
00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:35.590
he wanted defeat his tactics.
If you wanted to feed him,

1049
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:38.230
you need to know how he's thinking and what he's doing.

1050
00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:41.530
It Thompson knew that Makina was listening to the left to defeat them.

1051
00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:46.360
And so Thompson listened to be Keenan.
What led him to move to Colorado.
Oh,

1052
00:56:46.361 --> 00:56:47.980
he was losing his shit and San Francisco,

1053
00:56:47.981 --> 00:56:50.130
it was that night on the fucking motorcycle.
I mean,

1054
00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:54.460
but how did he choose Colorado?
So this is a great story.

1055
00:56:54.461 --> 00:56:59.050
And like the early sixties,
Thompson had had a chance to drive,

1056
00:56:59.130 --> 00:57:01.150
um,
I don't know,
some sort of cargo.

1057
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:05.410
I got friends car out to Colorado on his way to San Francisco in 1960 he ended

1058
00:57:05.411 --> 00:57:08.530
up doing a road trip up and down San Francisco after he passed through Colorado.

1059
00:57:08.531 --> 00:57:12.760
But he stopped in Colorado because he had to drop off a friend's car.

1060
00:57:12.761 --> 00:57:15.250
And there was a woman there,
Peggy Clifford,

1061
00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:20.320
who was a journalist and was his good friend at the,
um,
at the Aspen Daily Times.

1062
00:57:20.321 --> 00:57:25.150
And she was older.
She saw him like after driving 20 hours,
she's like,
Hey,

1063
00:57:25.151 --> 00:57:28.750
come in my house,
hang out.
And she lived right in Aspen and woody creek.

1064
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:33.460
And so then in 1963,
after sandy was pregnant,

1065
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.760
Thompson came back from South America where he was a reporter and did a

1066
00:57:36.761 --> 00:57:40.570
wonderful job like reporting on how democracies were falling apart down there.

1067
00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:44.260
Him and sandy wanted to move west because the national observer was the

1068
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:47.440
newspaper tops worked for.
They wanted to give Thompson,

1069
00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:49.450
I'm a position to be at Western reporter.

1070
00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:53.710
He was thinking of going to San Francisco,
but instead he chose to stop first.

1071
00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:58.870
We're,
Peggy Clifford was stopped in Aspen and Woody Creek.

1072
00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:03.900
And so he was living in an aspen and woody creek from August of 1963 to February

1073
00:58:03.941 --> 00:58:07.990
of 1963 and he was there,
this is where free kingdom begins.

1074
00:58:07.991 --> 00:58:11.260
He was there when John F.
Kennedy was assassinated,

1075
00:58:11.261 --> 00:58:14.630
and he sitting in his living room,
it's,
you know,

1076
00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:16.330
10:00 AM 11:00 AM Pacific time it,

1077
00:58:16.331 --> 00:58:19.270
he gets a knock on the door and it's this rancher named Wayne Vagner,

1078
00:58:19.271 --> 00:58:23.380
which is an old aspen family.
And that ranchers like the president's been shot,

1079
00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:26.650
like,
what's more,
he was,
he's been murdered,
he's dead.
And Thompson just like,

1080
00:58:26.651 --> 00:58:27.484
let's have a Saab.

1081
00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:31.390
Then he begins to fucking swear and then he fucking calms down and he goes

1082
00:58:31.391 --> 00:58:33.040
downtown Woody Creek,

1083
00:58:33.070 --> 00:58:37.630
he goes to aspen and he just gets notes from people what their responses are.

1084
00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:42.940
And so when he then went to San Francisco to become the correspondent for,
um,

1085
00:58:43.110 --> 00:58:44.650
for,
for the magazine that he was working for,

1086
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:48.490
he was having a tough time.

1087
00:58:48.491 --> 00:58:51.430
He was already wanting to flee because he got hell's angels.

1088
00:58:51.431 --> 00:58:53.470
He was able to stay in San Francisco longer,
right.

1089
00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:58.110
Report on them up in 1966 67.
He was like,
this city is not a good place from,

1090
00:58:58.140 --> 00:58:59.530
he has a great quote about like,

1091
00:58:59.531 --> 00:59:02.110
what would have happened if he stayed in San Francisco from 67.

1092
00:59:02.111 --> 00:59:03.520
[inaudible] he's like,
no,
I would have burned up.

1093
00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:07.030
Like I would have been emulated right there.
And so when it was time to leave,

1094
00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:10.300
he thought again of Woody Creek and of Aspen,

1095
00:59:10.301 --> 00:59:12.820
which was so different than than it is now.
And um,

1096
00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:16.750
that was the place that he decided to move and rent for a little while at first.

1097
00:59:16.751 --> 00:59:21.540
But then because of the success of Hell's angels,
he was able to buy Alpharma.
Um,

1098
00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:25.310
Aspen's very different.
But Woody Creek is not that much different.

1099
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:29.290
Woody Creek is still pretty great though.
The Song Woody Creek are great.
Yeah,

1100
00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:30.830
there's a great,
there's a place called the temporary.

1101
00:59:30.831 --> 00:59:34.490
They did an event with Juan Thompson and I like did a reading at it and like a

1102
00:59:34.491 --> 00:59:37.100
lot of Thompson's friends were there.
So I'm like,
I'm some fucking young.

1103
00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:41.240
I didn't know Thompson like I'm an interloper,
you know,
like I'm out there.

1104
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:44.720
And it was really great to talk to everybody that knew him and to go through it.

1105
00:59:44.721 --> 00:59:45.554
And that's why I,

1106
00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:49.430
that's why this book almost killed me cause I did a note for every sound,

1107
00:59:49.431 --> 00:59:54.230
smell our sight or comment,
like if I wrote and then at the moment Thompson felt,

1108
00:59:54.231 --> 00:59:56.840
what the fuck am I doing here?
I had the quote where he said,

1109
00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:59.330
I looked around then and I felt what the fuck am I doing here?

1110
00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:01.190
And I had that in the notes so people could see it.

1111
01:00:01.191 --> 01:00:04.520
And it was because I wanted those people that knew him well and respected him

1112
01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:08.870
and trusted him to not think that I was in any way trying anything but to make

1113
01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:11.420
good art off of his life and who he was trying to respond to.

1114
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:15.700
My fucking view of Trump right now and my love of his work in this moment.
Um,

1115
01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:17.540
why,
why do you say it almost killed you?

1116
01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:23.560
It's not possible to write a narrative and then also site every detail of a

1117
01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:24.231
narrative.

1118
01:00:24.231 --> 01:00:29.231
So each day I would spend nine hours researching and outlining with citations.

1119
01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:32.900
I wanted to read it like a novel and I want it to be like,
you know,

1120
01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:36.890
and at that moment I felt like I in the machine oil from the bay was coming off.

1121
01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:41.690
I wanted to read it vividly.
I knew that I had to support all of that.

1122
01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:46.180
And so I would spend eight or nine hours every day just on the pure,
um,

1123
01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:47.480
arrangement and research.

1124
01:00:47.481 --> 01:00:49.940
And then for the next six or seven hours or eight hours,

1125
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:53.900
I would write the narrative and then I'd sleep for five or six hours.
You know,

1126
01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:56.660
I get up and I would do it again.
And I did this for four or five months,

1127
01:00:56.750 --> 01:01:00.410
you know,
after I was deeply into it.
And I,
I don't think that's sustainable.

1128
01:01:00.411 --> 01:01:04.070
I think it's better in retrospect to go and report somewhere,
you know,

1129
01:01:04.071 --> 01:01:06.230
to like go and be at the middle of Congress and take notes,

1130
01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:10.670
but to try to write something with a dramatize nature that I think Thompson

1131
01:01:10.671 --> 01:01:13.070
wrote well and having my pros and saw nothing like his,
you know,

1132
01:01:13.071 --> 01:01:15.410
I wanted my pros to sound nothing like the way he wrote,

1133
01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:20.680
but then to also have almost as many pages of notes showing my work,

1134
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:24.830
you know,
like showing the math that went behind it.
So if I'm wrong,
I'm wrong,

1135
01:01:24.831 --> 01:01:28.190
but at least you can see it.
I think that was morally correct,

1136
01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:31.820
but I think that was too much effort when it comes to just because you were

1137
01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:33.530
trying to do it in a short period of time.

1138
01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:38.090
Did you have a crazy deadline or something?
Yes,
but I also,
I had a year and so,

1139
01:01:38.350 --> 01:01:42.620
you know,
and I had a family and I had a,
uh,
um,
a professor,
like I,
I just,

1140
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:46.940
I'd never,
when it came to writing,
had to do both those things,

1141
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:50.930
which was to try to write it in it in a novelistic way.

1142
01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:55.370
But then to also make sure that any question the reader would have,
but like,

1143
01:01:55.371 --> 01:01:59.510
why did you think that the dinner was at 5:00 PM?
You know,
or like,
you know,
why,

1144
01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:03.770
why did you think the sun was coming up in this way at this moment to make sure,

1145
01:02:03.771 --> 01:02:04.790
because out of respect,

1146
01:02:04.791 --> 01:02:07.100
because with Thompson talked about was people making money off.
I'm like,

1147
01:02:07.101 --> 01:02:08.750
Doonesbury yeah.
You know,

1148
01:02:08.751 --> 01:02:11.420
like that's what he talked about was people trying to make money on phone.

1149
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:15.110
And if I was gonna have this book,
it could have,
it couldn't be in that space.

1150
01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:18.740
Didn't he have a lawsuit against Gary Trudeau?
He thought about it.
I think.

1151
01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:20.000
I don't he ever did it.
He talked

1152
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.240
<v 0>about it publicly.
I think it was just well done.
He became that guy.</v>

1153
01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:28.020
Unfortunately,
that's what's really weird,
become a caricature of ourselves.

1154
01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:32.800
It's really scary.
Do you know,
um,
well it,
it's,

1155
01:02:32.810 --> 01:02:37.200
what's weird about it is that he kind of knew that it was happening.

1156
01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:42.440
Like there's that famous interview where he's talking to that British guy who,

1157
01:02:43.651 --> 01:02:48.060
uh,
did a documentary about him breakfast with hunter maybe or,
no,
but yeah.

1158
01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:52.470
One of them,
one of them,
but he's,
he's rolling a joint,
uh,

1159
01:02:52.471 --> 01:02:55.890
on the grass somewhere with that Las Vegas visor on and he's,
you know,

1160
01:02:55.891 --> 01:03:00.891
talking about how he's really become this caricature and it would be actually be

1161
01:03:02.101 --> 01:03:04.380
better if he wasn't alive anymore,
you know,

1162
01:03:04.450 --> 01:03:07.050
then it's breaking up with his wife during that.
It was really sad.

1163
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.870
There's a scene in that where he hides where he's at like a parking lot.

1164
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:12.700
He doesn't want people to see him and he's standing against the wall and people

1165
01:03:12.701 --> 01:03:13.860
are like,
come on,
we've got to go.
He's like,

1166
01:03:13.861 --> 01:03:17.640
I just don't want anybody to see me right now.
It was really sad and I,

1167
01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:21.090
I tried to take that tragedy too and he wrote great things afterwards.

1168
01:03:21.091 --> 01:03:22.800
He was a great friend to people at first.

1169
01:03:22.801 --> 01:03:26.280
Like Ron Wyden had this wonderful poet from Louisville was a dear friend of his,

1170
01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:27.720
like,
um,
all through his life.

1171
01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:31.920
But the tragedy of how much effort he put out to if we want to write about
Trump,

1172
01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:35.190
if you want to go after like Tybee did about the financial institution,

1173
01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:40.110
the way Thompson did it was to kind of wager time later for time now.

1174
01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:42.750
And he talks about that.
He says,
you mean by that chemical speed?

1175
01:03:42.751 --> 01:03:46.260
He says doing dexedrine being an alcoholic instead of changing his life and his

1176
01:03:46.261 --> 01:03:47.310
rhythms.
He said,

1177
01:03:47.311 --> 01:03:51.690
I'm wagering time later for time now I'm using up energy are things that I might

1178
01:03:51.691 --> 01:03:54.480
have by burning the candle so brightly at this instant.

1179
01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:57.420
Cause I believe I need to go after these moments and I later,

1180
01:03:57.421 --> 01:03:59.610
I'm not going to have it.
But I'm making that gamble.

1181
01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.850
I'm putting the card down right now.
And I think that's terrifying.

1182
01:04:02.851 --> 01:04:06.570
And I also think that he gave us brilliant writing over one of the most

1183
01:04:06.571 --> 01:04:08.700
remarkable spans in American history because of it.

1184
01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:11.400
That's a weird tradition in journalism,
right?

1185
01:04:11.401 --> 01:04:15.400
To destroy your body while creating your art.
And,
um,
I think there's a,

1186
01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:17.790
according to my friends who are journalists,

1187
01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:22.110
there's a big problem with Adderall today and there's a lot of people that are

1188
01:04:22.111 --> 01:04:24.380
using it to write and,
um,

1189
01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:28.830
it's fucking speed and you know,
you get addicted.
I mean,

1190
01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:32.220
Adderall makes everything in front of you closer.
Have you done it?
Yeah.

1191
01:04:32.221 --> 01:04:35.010
So my first book was called hyper.
I'm a personal history of Adhd,

1192
01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.980
so it was not being medicated as a child.
You were medicated as a child,

1193
01:04:37.981 --> 01:04:39.390
like having pills forced down my throat,

1194
01:04:39.391 --> 01:04:43.630
like all sold six when I took Ritalin for the first time I had,

1195
01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:48.390
I had a suicidal moment and like six years old was the first time you were six

1196
01:04:48.391 --> 01:04:50.880
you wanted to commit suicide?
I held like a butter knife to my wrist.

1197
01:04:50.881 --> 01:04:53.340
I don't remember it.
But yeah,
I kind of remember it,
but yeah.

1198
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:54.360
And it was on Ritalin,

1199
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:57.450
which I've taken now as an adult and I always feel startled when I'm on it.

1200
01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.770
If I ever take Ritalin now,
why do I like,
well,

1201
01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:03.750
I take it to write like this world is incredibly painful,
so I take Adderall now.

1202
01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.290
Um,
and I,
I take it to how often you take it every day.

1203
01:05:07.291 --> 01:05:10.440
I take like 30 milligrams a day really?
And I,
I take it too,

1204
01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:15.450
I take it to go into a library and this is what David Wallace wells was talking

1205
01:05:15.451 --> 01:05:18.010
about I think like two days ago on the show us.
How

1206
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.980
<v 1>do you read really shitty academic articles where you need the information from</v>

1207
01:05:20.981 --> 01:05:25.360
them?
I'm not good at that.
I'm not good at even making like a car reservation,

1208
01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:26.680
you know,
like a car rental reservation.

1209
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:29.890
And so this world's going to be painful no matter what.

1210
01:05:29.891 --> 01:05:33.820
But there's a functionality that um,
Adderall allows and it's always a wager.

1211
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:37.930
What Thompson writes about is whenever something is given something else's lost,

1212
01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.600
you never get anything for free in this world.

1213
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:43.510
Thompson understood that better than anybody.
So with him,
with Dexedrine,

1214
01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.120
I'm not going to say Thompson was hyperactive,
I'm not going to go into that.

1215
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:50.710
But text Adriene like Geiger was like,
Yo,
you're breaking down.

1216
01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:53.620
Like you're 26.
You have a wife,
you have a very small child.

1217
01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:57.820
You're writing right now.
You want to have your career go forward,

1218
01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:01.030
you're not doing well.
And Geiger was like,
I'm a doctor.

1219
01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:03.880
I had gone through med school,
you know,
I'd bid it,
I,

1220
01:06:03.881 --> 01:06:07.600
I'd been overwhelmed like you Gaga ran every morning,
you know,
he did,

1221
01:06:07.601 --> 01:06:11.710
he did other things,
but he,
he took Dex to train.
So I gave it to Thomson.

1222
01:06:11.711 --> 01:06:16.180
And for that small period of time it helped.
I mean for me it's like I,

1223
01:06:16.610 --> 01:06:19.780
I,
I'm not a good researcher and maybe I would be now,

1224
01:06:19.781 --> 01:06:22.870
but the only way I can write about something like hunter s Thompson where I

1225
01:06:22.871 --> 01:06:25.210
didn't know him,
I have no experience with him,

1226
01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:30.460
is to read everything that he's ever written or been written about him and then

1227
01:06:30.461 --> 01:06:33.670
go out and interview people.
And so effort is my only path forward.

1228
01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:37.270
And what Adderall helps for me is to take the pain away of that effort,

1229
01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.530
but it doesn't take it away.

1230
01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:41.470
It shifts it around to other aspects and other parts of life.

1231
01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:43.270
And I think Thompson when he wrote,

1232
01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:46.900
he who makes a piece of himself escapes the pain or gets rid of the pain of

1233
01:06:46.901 --> 01:06:50.890
being a man.
We don't listen to that.
Like,
he was like,
this effort is hard.

1234
01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:52.960
He's like,
I'm struggling with this effort.

1235
01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.280
I'm trying to make these beautiful things.

1236
01:06:54.850 --> 01:06:59.520
I always think of James Salter fiction writer Aspin um,
um,

1237
01:06:59.590 --> 01:07:03.670
resident wrote beautiful novels.
He wrote his whole life till he was 90.

1238
01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:05.230
His last novel was at 87.

1239
01:07:05.231 --> 01:07:08.950
He wrote a memoir at 76 about being a fighter pilot among other things in the

1240
01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:13.330
Korean War lyric.
Literary he did it his whole life.
He didn't,

1241
01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:17.170
he didn't burn out for a small period of time.
He's the Antonym to Thompson,

1242
01:07:17.171 --> 01:07:21.060
I think when it comes to effort and literary work.
Right.
Um,

1243
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:25.060
do,
do you just take it for work?
Yeah,

1244
01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:28.380
I mean you don't have like an issue that you need to take it for my,

1245
01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:32.740
I mean we will,
um,
I think that will,

1246
01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.860
whenever we have something like chemical speed,

1247
01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:38.440
whenever we have something like alcohol,
um,

1248
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:41.800
whenever we have something that's not like marijuana or at least marijuana cuts

1249
01:07:41.830 --> 01:07:43.390
your mania,
you know,

1250
01:07:43.391 --> 01:07:47.980
like whenever we have something else like alcohol or at all,

1251
01:07:47.981 --> 01:07:52.981
we need to ask the question as it is taking the pain away and being productive

1252
01:07:54.911 --> 01:07:55.744
through those.

1253
01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:59.950
Actually hastening your own doom and I think with alcohol is very clear.
It is.

1254
01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:04.270
Think with Adderall is more complex.
I think if you do an amount of time release,

1255
01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:05.163
you can make it work.

1256
01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:08.830
How many Americans do that out of the percent that are prescribed,
you know,

1257
01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:13.960
I don't know,
10%,
20%,
like it's dangerous.
How often do you take time off?

1258
01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:16.070
I'd say

1259
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:20.060
<v 0>maybe one or two weeks,
uh,
of,
uh,</v>

1260
01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:23.420
every three or four months.
And when you do that,

1261
01:08:23.421 --> 01:08:27.200
do you feel weird now I just watch movies.
Like I just don't do anything.

1262
01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:31.130
It doesn't,
I don't have any productivity.
I don't,
I don't produce.

1263
01:08:31.490 --> 01:08:33.380
So the only way you produce is on speed.

1264
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:35.870
The only way I produce the way I want you right now is on speed.

1265
01:08:35.871 --> 01:08:38.170
I didn't start taking it till 2010.
Two.

1266
01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:42.800
It's crazy that we're talking about this because there's so many people like
you.

1267
01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:47.210
It's um,
it's so common how much of the work that we enjoy today,

1268
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:50.360
especially literary work is written by people.

1269
01:08:50.361 --> 01:08:53.510
Journalistic work is written by people that are on speed.
That's not new.

1270
01:08:53.511 --> 01:08:56.960
I mean that's what Thompson and burrows and southern like this has been.

1271
01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:00.410
I believe that our American society,
the situation I'm in,

1272
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:03.770
I have created a situation where I have too much work and it's my fault.

1273
01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:08.180
I should not be trying to be a professor and also co report it communist and

1274
01:09:08.181 --> 01:09:11.120
also at George Mason in the um,
creative writing program,
you know,

1275
01:09:11.121 --> 01:09:15.290
and also then be hosting like people coming out and also then like be trying to

1276
01:09:15.291 --> 01:09:18.560
research something that might be my next thing that's too much in the way

1277
01:09:18.561 --> 01:09:22.340
Thompson saw dexedrine was that he could make reality match his effort.

1278
01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:25.340
So there was no longer the limit.
It was the American dream idea.

1279
01:09:25.341 --> 01:09:27.170
If you just put out enough effort,
you'll get it.

1280
01:09:27.171 --> 01:09:29.150
And that's why I think he's so brilliantly understood.

1281
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:32.960
The toxicity of the American dream is that the effort is what the story is.

1282
01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:36.740
You just because you have a path with the effort to be rich,
to be successful,

1283
01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.890
that doesn't mean that's a good thing.
That's what we'll actually dismantle you.

1284
01:09:40.190 --> 01:09:43.160
Yeah.
It's putting it out.
And I think we forget that.
Do you,

1285
01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:48.880
one of the things about hunter that's really intoxicating is that his sort of

1286
01:09:49.611 --> 01:09:54.611
self destructive path becomes romantic when you read it and you get involved in

1287
01:09:55.311 --> 01:09:58.790
his work and you kind of mimic it,
you know,
it's,
uh,

1288
01:09:59.030 --> 01:10:00.710
that's the greatest fallacy I think.

1289
01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:04.910
I think what he was trying to say with self destruction was that this was an

1290
01:10:04.911 --> 01:10:09.220
incredible threat to our American democracy.
Now,
I don't mean,
I mean,
I mean his,

1291
01:10:09.221 --> 01:10:12.290
no romanticism tilling his,
well,
I mean,

1292
01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:16.520
the romantic aspect of it was that his work was fantastic.

1293
01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:20.840
I mean window was still,
it wasn't,
it was fantastic till it was,
it wasn't,

1294
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:25.100
I mean he understood he didn't flood in the failure it was,
but he lived in with,

1295
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:27.290
he spent much more time within the,

1296
01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:31.760
the consequences of that bingeing then he did within the success of the bingeing

1297
01:10:32.150 --> 01:10:35.300
and that I think he knew that it has letters.

1298
01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:38.930
It's really beautiful and heartbreaking.
And in his writing too,

1299
01:10:38.931 --> 01:10:42.290
I mean I think that's what's been missed about him is there's no romanticism and

1300
01:10:42.291 --> 01:10:44.600
self destruction right towards the end.

1301
01:10:44.601 --> 01:10:48.530
He definitely lost his productivity and Yon Warner talked about that and the

1302
01:10:48.531 --> 01:10:52.400
Alex give me documentary,
just sticky fingers was a great,
the document,
uh,

1303
01:10:52.410 --> 01:10:56.840
the new book on the New Book on Yon Winner has great moments of Thompson in the

1304
01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.750
70s just being kind of lost.
Yeah.
You know,
and I think,

1305
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:04.100
I think we got to remember that we have an incredible times in American history.

1306
01:11:04.101 --> 01:11:07.450
We have times that are going to burn brightly and it's up to each rider to

1307
01:11:07.451 --> 01:11:10.430
decide how they'd like to burn next to it.
And if you're going to burn brightly,

1308
01:11:10.431 --> 01:11:12.140
they may not have other times.

1309
01:11:12.141 --> 01:11:15.780
And that's I think an American thing where you can wager that bright flame,

1310
01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.790
which means you may have nothing left afterwards.

1311
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:22.530
But Thompson knew that he may have to live in that kind of afterlife at Wa.

1312
01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:26.250
One Thompson writes about it so beautifully and the stories I tell myself,

1313
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:30.350
there's some footage of him when he was writing for,

1314
01:11:30.351 --> 01:11:34.530
I forget what newspaper somewhat was it somewhere in the Pacific northwest.

1315
01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:39.510
What,
what do is you're writing for?
Who is the author of playing off the rail?

1316
01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:44.490
Google,
uh,
playing off the rail.
There's a guy who was a journalist,

1317
01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:48.930
but year,
do you think it was David Mccumber?
Yes.
David McCumber.

1318
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:52.350
Dave and Macomber employed hunter for a while when David was,
um,

1319
01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:54.870
I forget what publication he was working for,

1320
01:11:54.871 --> 01:11:58.210
but there's some footage of them community communicating together and you know,

1321
01:11:58.211 --> 01:12:00.390
it was trying to get,
Hunter Has San Francisco,

1322
01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:05.280
was it San Francisco and hunters out of his fucking mind.
I mean,
it was younger.

1323
01:12:05.370 --> 01:12:07.680
You mean he wasn't even that old,
but he was just wracked.

1324
01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:12.000
He just couldn't communicate.
He couldn't talk.
And uh,
you know,
he made a beat.

1325
01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:15.180
He makes the beast have you escape the pain of articulation.

1326
01:12:15.181 --> 01:12:17.580
You escape the pain of saying this is what's wrong.

1327
01:12:17.581 --> 01:12:19.890
And American Society for him to say the way he did,

1328
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:24.010
one of his great essays is from 1964 is by going to Hemingway's,
um,

1329
01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:28.210
Ketchum Idaho on grave and Hemingway's house.
And it,

1330
01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:32.070
it's gorgeous because it talks about Hemingway was a good writer,

1331
01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:36.210
one of the best writers when he was writing about an up period.

1332
01:12:36.211 --> 01:12:39.540
He understood the 1940 [inaudible] 1930s when there was a firmness to the

1333
01:12:39.541 --> 01:12:41.490
reality that he could articulate.

1334
01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:44.130
One of the writers goals is to get the pattern to chaos,

1335
01:12:44.190 --> 01:12:45.350
is to give an articulation to cast.

1336
01:12:45.351 --> 01:12:50.130
But what happens in the 1960s when the chaos has multiplying repeatedly somebody

1337
01:12:50.131 --> 01:12:52.290
like Hemingway becomes a literal relic.

1338
01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:56.070
Like his narrative no longer fits into the present that he's in.

1339
01:12:56.310 --> 01:13:00.130
And Thompson saw Hemingway's decline and he wrote about Hemingway's,
um,

1340
01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.040
suicide by me,

1341
01:13:02.041 --> 01:13:06.360
by his narrative doesn't fit Hemingway's idea of what America was and what a man

1342
01:13:06.361 --> 01:13:10.770
should be fit perfectly with what I think the twenties to forties when we

1343
01:13:10.771 --> 01:13:11.311
experienced.

1344
01:13:11.311 --> 01:13:14.940
But I think in the early 1960s with our social upheaval of civil rights,
of,
um,

1345
01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:18.930
you know,
political upheaval,
Hemingway,
it was confusing to him.
It didn't,

1346
01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.190
it didn't fit anymore.

1347
01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:23.520
Like his way of operating no longer articulated the present.

1348
01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:27.900
And so Hemingway's last act was to take away his ability to say anything at all.

1349
01:13:27.930 --> 01:13:31.050
That was his only,
the last thing he ever said was to say,

1350
01:13:31.051 --> 01:13:32.520
I'm not going to say anything anymore.

1351
01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:35.250
Was the suicide that Hemingway committed and Thompson wrote about that

1352
01:13:35.730 --> 01:13:39.510
gorgeously?
Yeah.
When,
when I was young,

1353
01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.000
when he wound up killing himself,
owes,

1354
01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:46.800
it was almost unsurprising,
you know,

1355
01:13:46.801 --> 01:13:51.120
when,
when I read that he had died,
I remember going,
Oh man,

1356
01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:56.340
well,
I guess,
yeah.
You know what I mean?
I mean,

1357
01:13:56.341 --> 01:13:59.550
it's like you knew that he was deteriorating rapidly.

1358
01:13:59.551 --> 01:14:04.410
You knew that he had really bad hips.
He had had hip replacement surgery,
um,

1359
01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.810
the Ralph stepping leg.
Yeah.

1360
01:14:06.811 --> 01:14:11.811
Ralph Steadman had drawn this very crazy image of him with the

1361
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:15.970
<v 2>artificial hip and yeah,
it looked like pain.
You know what I mean?</v>

1362
01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:20.290
<v 1>But I think that it's not my place to even deal with that because Juan</v>

1363
01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:23.680
Thompson's book writes about that moment or one Thompson was in the house and

1364
01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:27.700
that's,
that's,
that's his and one writes beautifully about the stakes of it,

1365
01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:31.830
how painful it was to the people that loved him,
everything about it.
Um,

1366
01:14:31.831 --> 01:14:35.800
and how that,
even if that's a logical outcome at that's not,
no,
it needed it.

1367
01:14:35.801 --> 01:14:38.170
So it's interesting,
I would say read stories.

1368
01:14:38.171 --> 01:14:42.610
I tell myself that moment is so honestly and brilliantly written by Warren.

1369
01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:44.850
<v 2>No,
I'm sure.
Boat Bama.
Oh,</v>

1370
01:14:44.851 --> 01:14:49.450
I was getting at is that at the time of his death,
you know,

1371
01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:52.500
he was in to sort of a,

1372
01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:58.750
<v 1>he was deteriorating so badly.
He was wearing diapers.
His,</v>

1373
01:14:58.751 --> 01:15:01.900
his entire cause of his alcoholism has ability to control.
His bladder was gone.

1374
01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:06.220
And so one gave this wonderful speech at George Mason when he came out and he's

1375
01:15:06.221 --> 01:15:07.600
like,
how do you write honestly about your father?

1376
01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:10.770
And he asked the question of like,
should I include this detail?
And he was like,

1377
01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:13.000
if my father was alive,
I couldn't include that.

1378
01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:16.450
But that's why I chose in a sense to write my book where my father was dead

1379
01:15:16.451 --> 01:15:18.850
because I think my father would want me to write honestly,

1380
01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:21.940
but also not want me to include that if he was still alive.

1381
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.820
And so he included that detail and he talked about that,

1382
01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:27.640
how the struggle to include that detail,

1383
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:30.100
which I think brilliantly articulate what you're saying,

1384
01:15:30.101 --> 01:15:33.070
which is the deterioration in the sadness of it.

1385
01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:36.730
And I mean we have finite amounts of energy or effort.
We really do.

1386
01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.680
We have to take care of ourselves.
And if we don't,

1387
01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:42.270
we will pay that price at some point.
We're going to pay it anyways.

1388
01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:46.270
We're all headed to the same place whether we want to or not,
you know?

1389
01:15:46.271 --> 01:15:51.271
And so I think hunter's a really terrifying and beautiful example of one wager

1390
01:15:51.971 --> 01:15:55.180
of chips that were made for the 1960 [inaudible] and 1970s.

1391
01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:58.330
And I think the best way to honor that is to,
you know,

1392
01:15:58.331 --> 01:16:03.331
apply the brilliance that he forged in carved to the situation we have right now

1393
01:16:03.821 --> 01:16:06.540
with corruption,
Donald Trump,
um,
uh,

1394
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:09.310
of an attack on American democracy where American democracy is basically,

1395
01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:14.050
it's like what early says democracy is a train and we arrive at the station

1396
01:16:14.051 --> 01:16:14.830
would get off,

1397
01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:17.740
like they'd be basically used the ladder to get to the attic and now Trump's

1398
01:16:17.741 --> 01:16:20.920
pulling up the ladder.
And I think Thompson would understand that really,

1399
01:16:20.921 --> 01:16:24.880
really well.
And I think reading him now,
whether you know him or not,
helps you,

1400
01:16:24.881 --> 01:16:28.090
and that's why I wrote free kingdom was so that it can be a lens on his,

1401
01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:30.380
his work going back or just on this president right now.
No,
they'll

1402
01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.650
<v 2>be regardless of Trump.</v>

1403
01:16:31.651 --> 01:16:36.650
I think what he really represents is a brilliant historical time capsule.
And He,

1404
01:16:36.930 --> 01:16:40.620
he sort of captures that time period,

1405
01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:45.420
that upheaval pre-internet where the world was in chaos.
Like no one else.

1406
01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:47.080
He,
he,

1407
01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:51.450
he encapsulated this very strange moment in history,

1408
01:16:51.451 --> 01:16:53.880
which I don't think is nearly as strange as the moment we're going through right

1409
01:16:53.881 --> 01:16:57.440
now.
I think this is probably the most trained moment ever.
Yeah.
But he,

1410
01:16:57.441 --> 01:16:59.730
he nailed it and he nailed it in a very,

1411
01:16:59.731 --> 01:17:03.770
very unique way that still today I mean to oil.

1412
01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:07.320
That was another thing I want to ask you about.
Well why did him and Tom Wolfe,

1413
01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:12.620
like Tom Wolfe got some of his tapes from some of the,

1414
01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:17.240
was it the Honda,
the hell's angels,
Palisade,
just parties and um,

1415
01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:22.130
some crazy orgy that was going on.
And he gave him the tapes to this,

1416
01:17:22.131 --> 01:17:23.480
like what was all that about?

1417
01:17:23.530 --> 01:17:26.230
<v 1>So when Thomson was covering the hell's angels,
um,</v>

1418
01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:32.170
they believed the Carter culture at the left in the 1960,
65,

1419
01:17:32.171 --> 01:17:35.110
66.
We're talking about Kenkey Z,
we're talking about the antiwar movement,

1420
01:17:35.111 --> 01:17:36.640
the free speech movement with Mario Savio.

1421
01:17:37.090 --> 01:17:38.650
They believe the hell's angels were on their side.

1422
01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:42.820
They were fellow countercultural lists that are also outside of the ballgame.

1423
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.920
And so key,
the and Thompson were having a drink after being on the cake.

1424
01:17:47.921 --> 01:17:52.540
Qed,
or like some local TV show in San Francisco.
And [inaudible] background is,

1425
01:17:52.810 --> 01:17:55.000
he was a wrestler at Oregon.
He grew up on a dairy farm.

1426
01:17:55.090 --> 01:17:58.300
He'd come down to Stanford to write for what is now the Stegner fellowship.

1427
01:17:58.301 --> 01:18:00.100
But back then was the graduate program at Stanford.

1428
01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:03.160
He had moved up to La Honda on the success of his first book.

1429
01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:06.810
One flew over the cuckoo's nest and had just written another beautiful book.
Um,

1430
01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:10.810
and so Thompson was like,
yeah,
I'm ready about the hell's angels.
And he was like,

1431
01:18:10.930 --> 01:18:14.680
Yo,
I or I'd like to meet them.
Tom's was like,
okay.

1432
01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:17.860
And so Thompson knew how dangerous the hell's angels were at war,

1433
01:18:17.890 --> 01:18:21.040
or I think people either romanticize them or exaggerated there danger,

1434
01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:23.290
but he's like,
okay,
I'll set them up.
And He,
you know,

1435
01:18:23.291 --> 01:18:26.800
he contacted the chapter with Keasy.
So on August 7th,

1436
01:18:26.801 --> 01:18:31.750
I think of 1965,
like the hell's angels came to La Honda.

1437
01:18:32.170 --> 01:18:35.890
Alan Ginsburg was there with Keasy.
Um,
Alpert was there.

1438
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:37.720
You know who that like all of the,

1439
01:18:37.721 --> 01:18:40.930
all the Stanford intellectuals were there and they made a huge banner that says

1440
01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:44.080
the Merry Pranksters,
welcome the hell's angels.

1441
01:18:44.890 --> 01:18:47.620
And Thompson rolled up with the,
this isn't,

1442
01:18:47.650 --> 01:18:50.770
this isn't the given you documentary Thompson rolled up with his family.
Um,

1443
01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:54.420
one was a child,
a baby in the backseat San.

1444
01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:58.030
He was in the front seat and he pulled up.
And what Thompson saw was Ken Keyes,

1445
01:18:58.031 --> 01:19:02.080
he giving acid in red cups,
like Red k cups to the hell's angels.

1446
01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:04.150
Thompson was like,
well,
we're getting the fuck out of here.

1447
01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.390
And so he grabs his wife and his son,
they go to San Clemente,

1448
01:19:07.391 --> 01:19:09.370
which is on the other side.
They have like a big picnic.

1449
01:19:09.670 --> 01:19:11.320
And on the way back they're like,
well,
let's just check it out.

1450
01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:12.940
Let's see what it's like.

1451
01:19:13.390 --> 01:19:16.000
And they kind of pull it and he's driving this old like roadster.

1452
01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:20.140
They pull in and everybody's watching on a giant trampoline screen,

1453
01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:24.040
like the five hour stream of consciousness footage from the merry pranksters

1454
01:19:24.041 --> 01:19:28.480
trip across the,
um,
across the u s which is what Tom offered about and comes,

1455
01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:29.051
it's like,
all right,

1456
01:19:29.051 --> 01:19:32.770
they're not eating each other skulls like we can hang out a little bit.

1457
01:19:33.190 --> 01:19:37.030
So they hung out and it was interesting how acid pacified the angels instead of

1458
01:19:37.031 --> 01:19:40.000
made them violent.
And that's what acid,
you know,
of course that's what acid is,

1459
01:19:40.001 --> 01:19:44.470
but they spent the night hanging out there.
Thompson was writing.
So He's like,

1460
01:19:44.471 --> 01:19:46.570
I'm not going to do drugs.
He's like,
I'll have a few drinks.

1461
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:49.900
He's taking notes for his,
his book and later on in the night,

1462
01:19:50.590 --> 01:19:54.250
him and Alan Ginsburg,
and this is something I cut out of the book,
are like,

1463
01:19:54.251 --> 01:19:55.270
let's go get some beer.

1464
01:19:55.271 --> 01:19:59.650
And so the cops are sticking out the property and Ginsburg and Thompson and get

1465
01:19:59.651 --> 01:20:02.650
pulled over by the cops.
Thompson stubborn.
He's talking to the cops.

1466
01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:07.740
He gets a ticket because his red lens for his taillight is cracked.

1467
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.150
And he's like,
come on dude,
that's turn a box.
Like,
I can't,
I'm a journalist.

1468
01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:14.550
The cops are like,
why are you writing about them?

1469
01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.060
And they're talking about like people being taken away to jail and kids were,

1470
01:20:18.061 --> 01:20:22.780
goes wasn't what's in what's in Redwood City,
man.
Tableau,

1471
01:20:22.781 --> 01:20:24.720
he goes,
it's called a jail Allen.

1472
01:20:25.050 --> 01:20:27.150
And that goes back to talking to the cops and all of this.

1473
01:20:27.150 --> 01:20:30.420
And Thompson was friends with Ginsberg and so they go back into the party.

1474
01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:34.830
Thompson realizes that Neal Cassidy,
who's blackout drunk,

1475
01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:38.430
who is Dean Moriarty and on the road by Jack Kerouac,

1476
01:20:38.431 --> 01:20:42.120
that's the character on who it was based.
His two or three girlfriends,

1477
01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:46.380
one of them is having an orgy with the hell's angels at this cabin off to the

1478
01:20:46.381 --> 01:20:50.760
side and Thompson sees it and he describes it in two ways when he writes about

1479
01:20:50.761 --> 01:20:51.780
it,
but he did audio nuts.

1480
01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:57.560
So he did audio notes of step by step and he describes to us like just horrific

1481
01:20:58.861 --> 01:21:02.880
where she's barely awake.
I'm like,
she's,
she's catatonic.

1482
01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:07.050
And they bring in Neal Cassady to hook up with her too.
It's horrific.

1483
01:21:07.051 --> 01:21:08.580
And He articulates this horror.

1484
01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:11.250
I had a friend who is a good feminist writer lakes who's dear to me.
She's like,

1485
01:21:11.251 --> 01:21:14.580
didn't have any,
you wrote about a fucking white guy,
like whatever.
She's like,

1486
01:21:14.581 --> 01:21:17.730
he did most of it.
Right.
She's like,
you excused Thompson in that moment.

1487
01:21:17.731 --> 01:21:20.980
You should have just let it stand and write about it in the book instead of try

1488
01:21:20.981 --> 01:21:24.510
to talk about how upset he was saying it.
Thomson was really upset.

1489
01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:26.100
So why did she say that?

1490
01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:30.870
It doesn't make any sense because I think she thought that I was making the

1491
01:21:30.871 --> 01:21:34.050
experience less authentic by trying to qualify it for our current times.

1492
01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:38.040
But why would that be the case when you were just expressing?
Explain?
No,

1493
01:21:38.041 --> 01:21:40.390
I should've just little Thompson.
No,

1494
01:21:41.150 --> 01:21:46.080
I think I should have let him stand more instead of showing or amplifying his

1495
01:21:46.081 --> 01:21:47.220
emotion too much.

1496
01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:52.410
But you're saying this based on her criticism or all personal opinion?
No,

1497
01:21:52.411 --> 01:21:53.670
I think that he was really upset,

1498
01:21:53.671 --> 01:21:57.990
but I think him being really upset is secondary to whatever she was
experiencing.

1499
01:21:58.020 --> 01:21:59.940
Right,
but you're writing about him?
Yes.

1500
01:21:59.970 --> 01:22:03.210
So I stand by it like I thought about that.
What I wrote it.
I stand by it,

1501
01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:07.440
but what was,
what does her criticism again that by amplifying his upsetness,

1502
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:11.400
by like showing how upset he was,
that that's too much of an excuse for him.

1503
01:22:11.401 --> 01:22:12.920
Just just write it where he was.

1504
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.290
She didn't think he should have done stepped in and said,
no,
no,
no,
no,

1505
01:22:16.291 --> 01:22:18.690
nothing like that.
She was on point.
She thought I shouldn't.

1506
01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:23.490
She felt the effort on my part to try to explain his upsetness instead of just

1507
01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:26.490
having him be upset with one sentence and then go on.

1508
01:22:26.491 --> 01:22:27.540
She thought it was overriding.

1509
01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:32.340
I thought it was a fair criticism where I overwrote it,
but long story short,

1510
01:22:32.341 --> 01:22:35.370
Thompson goes back and he goes to Keasy and he goes,

1511
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:37.650
this is one of the worst things I've ever seen and this is in the documentary,

1512
01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:41.430
but he says the case then why would,
why would it be that you were overriding it?

1513
01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:45.070
That doesn't seem like you overrode it.
I always worry.
I'm over writing it.

1514
01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:45.953
One of my great,

1515
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:49.080
it's one of my great fears is that if someone sees something like that,

1516
01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:52.590
I think it's important that you accurately relay the emotions that they

1517
01:22:52.591 --> 01:22:54.990
experience when they're watching a horrific event.
I mean,

1518
01:22:54.991 --> 01:22:56.550
he did describe it as horrific,

1519
01:22:56.580 --> 01:23:01.020
but how much of it is my cultural perception of this moment that I'm giving too

1520
01:23:01.021 --> 01:23:04.170
much to Thomson and how much of it was what he act accurately experience,

1521
01:23:04.230 --> 01:23:05.100
but he's talked about.

1522
01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:08.380
So I think just giving his words instead of saying a little bit,
you know,

1523
01:23:08.381 --> 01:23:10.630
going okay.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1524
01:23:10.631 --> 01:23:13.540
And so when he goes back and he on his notes that night,

1525
01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:16.060
these are the notes he gave to Ken Casey.
I'm sorry,
these are the notes.
Tom.

1526
01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:19.870
Tom Wolfe.
He says it just gave him the recordings.
No,

1527
01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:22.120
I don't think there were actual recordings.
No,
I don't.

1528
01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:24.280
I think that is what Tom Wolfe said.
No,

1529
01:23:24.281 --> 01:23:27.260
that's what one of the documentaries said.
Tom Wolfe said he gave me the record,

1530
01:23:27.490 --> 01:23:31.570
the notes of it.
So maybe be the notes of what happened.
And Tom Wolfe,

1531
01:23:31.571 --> 01:23:32.440
I know what those notes are.

1532
01:23:32.441 --> 01:23:36.850
Use those notes to recreate that scene in electric koolaid acid test.

1533
01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:40.990
Um,
and so this is why we talk about truth later in life.
Thompson,

1534
01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:44.800
some biographies might've said that he actually recorded the event.
He didn't,

1535
01:23:44.801 --> 01:23:49.120
he went back and he took these long audio notes of like shadow and light and the

1536
01:23:49.121 --> 01:23:52.450
whore that he saw it.
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.
He took the audio notes,

1537
01:23:52.451 --> 01:23:55.590
the recordings.
He made the recording.
Yes,
yes.
And then he gave us a tumble often.

1538
01:23:55.591 --> 01:23:56.980
Tom Wolfe.
Exactly.

1539
01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:59.410
But some people have said that he put the tape recorder in the room.

1540
01:24:00.270 --> 01:24:01.103
That's not what I meant.

1541
01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.740
I meant he gave him the recordings and they're beautiful.
They're terrifying.

1542
01:24:05.741 --> 01:24:10.120
But it's about like violence and shadow and light and horror.
You know,

1543
01:24:10.121 --> 01:24:11.290
it's a horrific,

1544
01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:14.680
it's a horrific scene that says Thompson's brilliance at that age.

1545
01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:16.210
He could in an audio note,

1546
01:24:16.570 --> 01:24:20.640
get the fucking images and details that he needs to express the,
that,

1547
01:24:20.670 --> 01:24:25.150
the nature of that incident.
And so Tom Wolfe use those to create it himself.

1548
01:24:25.151 --> 01:24:29.050
But 10 Thompson recreated it to art,
wrote about it in Hell's angels,

1549
01:24:29.770 --> 01:24:31.180
but in a more distant way than wolfed it,

1550
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:34.900
which is crazy cause he was actually there.
It's fucking crazy,
dude.

1551
01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.570
That was the first time Thompson never took acid because he was so upset.

1552
01:24:37.571 --> 01:24:40.150
He went to Keasy and he's like,
fuck it,
I'm not a journalist anymore.

1553
01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:42.490
That's so horrific.
What I saw.
Fuck it.

1554
01:24:42.770 --> 01:24:46.750
I had friends that had told him that he's a personality where if he did acid to

1555
01:24:46.751 --> 01:24:48.160
go to the bottom of the well for him,
you know,

1556
01:24:48.161 --> 01:24:51.970
this would be a really horrific thing.
And so he's like,
I don't care anymore.

1557
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:55.720
And instead he just walked around and like,
was that piece like,

1558
01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:58.960
it's always funny when someone tells you how you're going to recycle a drug.

1559
01:24:59.470 --> 01:25:02.680
Relax,
right?
Cause you forget you're going to react to it.

1560
01:25:02.681 --> 01:25:03.514
How you're gonna react to it.

1561
01:25:03.790 --> 01:25:06.760
What was it like for you when you finally finish this?
When you,

1562
01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:10.630
when you put the last page down and you knew you were done.
Um,

1563
01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:14.380
I know that you like me,
uh,
share.
Uh,

1564
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:19.350
we have an adoration for this guy.
That's,
uh,
you mean he's one of my,
uh,

1565
01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:21.370
for sure.
Personal heroes.

1566
01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:25.150
I mean the last image I wrote was,
um,

1567
01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:28.420
one of the most people think Thompson's Thompson writes his something he didn't

1568
01:25:28.421 --> 01:25:32.740
actually see was with Nixon's helicopter.
He saw it on,
on TV,

1569
01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:35.560
left the White House lawn.
What happens is that,
you know,

1570
01:25:35.561 --> 01:25:37.630
giant helicopter with the white top and the blue,

1571
01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:41.920
it's wheels lose their pressure so the wheels are flattened at the bottom.

1572
01:25:42.130 --> 01:25:43.930
But as the rotors begin to bring it up,

1573
01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.630
they become a long good wheels that's still touch the ground.

1574
01:25:46.930 --> 01:25:49.820
Thompson wrote that image and I've always loved that image.
Um,

1575
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:54.080
so I was writing that in a sense when I was at Seapak it,

1576
01:25:54.081 --> 01:25:58.840
I'm 2018 last year and I was walking out just after I wrote that.

1577
01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:02.020
And pence,
this helicopter was on the lawn right there.

1578
01:26:02.230 --> 01:26:05.600
It was lifting off and I saw the wheels along it just like that.

1579
01:26:05.601 --> 01:26:10.070
And I just had so much respect for Thompson's ability as we talk about fiction

1580
01:26:10.071 --> 01:26:13.880
as a narrative writer detail that instant,
you know,

1581
01:26:13.881 --> 01:26:17.690
and to detail the way that that along gated and went to have that be the emotion

1582
01:26:17.691 --> 01:26:21.340
of Nixon finally departing.
And so I felt,
you know,

1583
01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:24.040
I felt I gave it,
you know,

1584
01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:26.090
I throw as hard as I could if there are as many pictures as I could,

1585
01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:28.460
I threw for as long as I can,
you know,

1586
01:26:28.461 --> 01:26:32.510
and I hope that everybody knows it's my version of Thompson and then it's a

1587
01:26:32.511 --> 01:26:35.630
version of Thompson written through the Lens of Donald Trump.

1588
01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:39.980
But hopefully that it's through the effort and through the detail of version

1589
01:26:39.981 --> 01:26:44.030
that might bring more people to Thompson while also at the same time for Thomson

1590
01:26:44.031 --> 01:26:48.590
fans,
um,
you know,
being something that they can respect and engage.

1591
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:51.980
