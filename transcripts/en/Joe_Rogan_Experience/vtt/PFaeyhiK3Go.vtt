51
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.503
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.970
<v Speaker 1>It's on the way to palm springs.</v>

53
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:46.160
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of up in the house,</v>

54
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.013
<v Speaker 1>in the mountains,</v>

55
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.661
<v Speaker 1>more of a mountain.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

59
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>because he told me about the house and uh,</v>

60
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.973
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

61
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.590
<v Speaker 1>like the idea that I could fit a regular pool table in there.</v>

62
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it all the high born like three or four houses.</v>

63
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>I've never had one that had the room that would accommodate up,</v>

64
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.710
<v Speaker 1>want to have by nine.</v>

65
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.010

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

69
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.983
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>

70
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.153
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

71
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

72
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.140

73
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:35.650
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

74
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things I liked about this office.</v>

75
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.703
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

76
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I was excited about what this office is,</v>

77
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.180
<v Speaker 1>I knew there was space for a table.</v>

78
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.580
<v Speaker 1>I resisted for a while.</v>

79
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

80
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.841
<v Speaker 1>Get it.</v>

81
00:03:50.841 --> 00:03:54.260
<v Speaker 1>I'll just be fucking playing all the time and I wasted,</v>

82
00:03:54.261 --> 00:03:56.780
<v Speaker 1>my life hasn't really been,</v>

83
00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.470
<v Speaker 1>this is a great table of practice on the pocket.</v>

84
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.313
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

85
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.890
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

86
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:01.520
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy it.</v>

87
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it's changed my game a little.</v>

88
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Do be running out like crazy on your diamond.</v>

89
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Well I saw also feel like I'm hitting balls a lot more gently.</v>

91
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.140
<v Speaker 1>I notice that some of the shots you good job making the,</v>

92
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 1>it was just um,</v>

93
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>it requires more of you because they're so tight.</v>

94
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.770
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't sure if that would be good or if it'd be annoying after awhile,</v>

95
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.010
<v Speaker 1>but I definitely think it's good.</v>

96
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.333
<v Speaker 1>Go Buddy.</v>

97
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

98
00:04:39.861 --> 00:04:43.760
<v Speaker 1>It just requires acquires you to concentrate more.</v>

99
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.901
<v Speaker 1>Is it pockets?</v>

100
00:04:44.901 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 1>You're stuck.</v>

101
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.113
<v Speaker 1>Rude.</v>

102
00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.540
<v Speaker 1>We've got to make the right choices too.</v>

103
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

104
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.440
<v Speaker 1>How do you plan on 10 ball?</v>

105
00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Do you play the back house?</v>

106
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.281
<v Speaker 1>We get 10 ball.</v>

107
00:05:37.281 --> 00:05:38.210
<v Speaker 1>That's not supposed to count.</v>

108
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.510
<v Speaker 1>I think it's supposed to be called pocket.</v>

109
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Where did this play goes?</v>

110
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Goes through.</v>

111
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:44.463
<v Speaker 1>I like slot.</v>

112
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.463
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

113
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.650
<v Speaker 1>I think like 10 ball.</v>

114
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.200
<v Speaker 1>I got to show you the shot that this guy,</v>

115
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.980
<v Speaker 1>he showed me something and I didn't hear it.</v>

116
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.320
<v Speaker 1>CJ,</v>

117
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.530
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

118
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.750
<v Speaker 1>They talk about it for a long time,</v>

119
00:05:56.751 --> 00:05:57.930
<v Speaker 1>but I've tried it and it's,</v>

120
00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 1>it's so bizarre to me.</v>

121
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.093
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you.</v>

122
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.983
<v Speaker 1>I just</v>

123
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.503
<v Speaker 1>get</v>

124
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.900
<v Speaker 1>such a nice job.</v>

125
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.840
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the coolest things about is the fact that you're trying to</v>

126
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:28.841
<v Speaker 1>control just a couple revolutions out a ball like that little bit off.</v>

127
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes the game so insane.</v>

128
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:31.643
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

129
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.800
<v Speaker 1>If you were just a little bit further than that,</v>

130
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.380
<v Speaker 1>it was a perfect shot.</v>

131
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Reckless.</v>

132
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.690
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to look this year,</v>

133
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:56.383
<v Speaker 1>did street,</v>

134

<v Speaker 1>do you know what Max,</v>

135
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.660
<v Speaker 1>I believe?</v>

136
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.493
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

137
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.560
<v Speaker 1>The guy that'd be a good guy to get instructions from</v>

138
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:21.703
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

139
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.053
<v Speaker 1>Helped me a lot.</v>

140
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Get a lot of knowledge.</v>

141
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

142
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.780
<v Speaker 1>his fundamentals are so perfect.</v>

143
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

144
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.120
<v Speaker 1>The way he holds a cue,</v>

145
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.150
<v Speaker 1>he describes it as the reputation,</v>

146
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:35.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

147
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 1>the reputation,</v>

148
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.043
<v Speaker 1>but he says,</v>

149
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:40.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

150
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.170
<v Speaker 1>the same amount of time between shots.</v>
