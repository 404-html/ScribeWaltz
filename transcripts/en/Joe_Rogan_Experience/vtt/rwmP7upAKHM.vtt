6
00:00:08.651 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>the w the world fought over salt for ages and amazing to think about it today.</v>

7
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>People were forced to work in salt mines and died in them.</v>

8
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>That was like as huge punishment for ages.</v>

9
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:19.290
<v Speaker 1>And there's a mountain in,</v>

10
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.183
<v Speaker 1>is it Germany?</v>

11
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>There's a mountain of salt.</v>

12
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.921
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

13
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:24.270
<v Speaker 1>It's been redeeming audit yet.</v>

14
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.460
<v Speaker 1>There's a book called salt and it's very good.</v>

15
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Will you look up the book called Salt?</v>

16
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:29.111
<v Speaker 1>The guy who wrote it,</v>

17
00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:32.390
<v Speaker 1>that and neighbor reducing just because of the world's need for salt.</v>

18
00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:32.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:32.741
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

20
00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:32.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 1>they dug it all down.</v>

22
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.060
<v Speaker 1>There's two mountains,</v>

23
00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>one in South America,</v>

24
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.980
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the other.</v>

25
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:40.720
<v Speaker 1>And Mexico's it in Potosi and uh,</v>

26
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>and there it has salt,</v>

27
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:42.870
<v Speaker 1>a world history.</v>

28
00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:46.170
<v Speaker 1>You really like it now because he breaks it down and he shows you the salt mines</v>

29
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.180
<v Speaker 1>and there's pictures of the Salt Mountain and uh,</v>

30
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>and it is unfucking believable.</v>

31
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.091
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

32
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>we were talking earlier today,</v>

33
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.940
<v Speaker 1>we were talking earlier today about not having a smartphone would a big leap.</v>

34
00:00:56.941 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>That would be to go back to a flip phone,</v>

35
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>but look at the fuck people fought over salt.</v>

36
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>That is so alien and spices,</v>

37
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:05.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

38
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.080
<v Speaker 1>The reason why Columbus was coming there,</v>

39
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:12.081
<v Speaker 1>it is that the reason why a Columbus was a mountain of salt w w came and when I</v>

40
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 1>always talk about Columbus and even bloody show that it,</v>

41
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.361
<v Speaker 1>even Magellan,</v>

42
00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>and when he went around the world,</v>

43
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.880
<v Speaker 1>he sent five ships.</v>

44
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.541
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

45
00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 1>they lost all of them.</v>

46
00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:21.270
<v Speaker 1>They finally came back with one three years later,</v>

47
00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:21.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

48
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Three years later,</v>

49
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.170
<v Speaker 1>but crappy ship with 18 guys sail back in.</v>

50
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.651
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

51
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:27.030
<v Speaker 1>it all been underwritten by,</v>

52
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.243
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.670
<v Speaker 1>businessmen from Germany,</v>

54
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.001
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

55
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Who underwrote Magellan's voyage.</v>

56
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.430
<v Speaker 1>There was enough spice in that ship to pay for the whole trip.</v>

57
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.600
<v Speaker 1>A three year trip and losing 300 guys in five ships or whatever,</v>

58
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>four ships.</v>

59
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

60
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.990
<v Speaker 1>There was it because they brought back what,</v>

61
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:43.220
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

62
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.401
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

63
00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:44.610
<v Speaker 1>don't know what they wanted on that one.</v>

64
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Nutmeg or whatever it was.</v>

65
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.070
<v Speaker 1>And they had to go all the way around the world to on would east indies,</v>

66
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>no electricity.</v>

67
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.040
<v Speaker 1>But she see that was the difference was Magellan was going to prove you could go</v>

68
00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>

69
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.473
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

70
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Cause usually they went around India and the horn and so that's how valuable it</v>

71
00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:03.301
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

72
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:04.230
<v Speaker 1>And that's why,</v>

73
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.880
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>

75
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

76
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Portugal and Spain were such giant powers that because spice,</v>

77
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.590
<v Speaker 1>and then when span took over the new world,</v>

78
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>there was a mountains of gold,</v>

79
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.020
<v Speaker 1>one in South American,</v>

80
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:17.130
<v Speaker 1>one amount of silver,</v>

81
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:21.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean a mountain silver that they made the Indians and killed them all.</v>

82
00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Doing it.</v>

83
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Dig Out and all the gold and silver in Asia is still in circulation,</v>

84
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:30.210
<v Speaker 1>is like Spanish gold dug out of the new world.</v>

85
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.250
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

86
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.630
<v Speaker 1>It was a literal mountain.</v>

87
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Two of them,</v>

88
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 1>one in South America and one in Mexico.</v>

89
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Ted's still credible,</v>

90
00:02:37.141 --> 00:02:37.974
<v Speaker 1>a mountain,</v>

91
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 1>the real problem and things,</v>

93
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.870
<v Speaker 1>even the term social justice warrior is that there are aggressive,</v>

94
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.081
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

95
00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:48.040
<v Speaker 1>the thing about social justice.</v>

96
00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:49.290
<v Speaker 1>So it's like what do you,</v>

97
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:49.651
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

98
00:02:49.651 --> 00:02:50.760
<v Speaker 1>what do you really want?</v>

99
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.140
<v Speaker 1>You want peace?</v>

100
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.951
<v Speaker 1>Guess where it,</v>

101
00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:55.710
<v Speaker 1>guess what the worst way to get pieces being an asshole.</v>

102
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

103
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

104
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Being an asshole will almost that kind of antisocial.</v>

105
00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.201
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

106
00:02:59.201 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>There's a sense in</v>

107
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.380
<v Speaker 2>a lot of ways cause they're like,</v>

108
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 2>like they're about doxing people and aggressively pursuing actions against them,</v>

109
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 2>trying to get people fired because they don't share their ideology.</v>

110
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 2>The weirdest road testing.</v>

111
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.281
<v Speaker 2>Totally agree.</v>

112
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 2>Like the weirdest thing to me.</v>

113
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 2>And I think like people have started to becoming more like,</v>

114
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 2>I've certainly become more aggressive just dealing with their shit,</v>

115
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.511
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

116
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 2>Like become less aggressive believe it or not about them.</v>

117
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.681
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

118
00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:23.514
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

119
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to fight with that kind of shit at all because I think it's just</v>

120
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 2>creates a dust cloud of confused cause it's counterproductive and it's totally</v>

121
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:32.074
<v Speaker 2>counterproductive.</v>

122
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.750
<v Speaker 2>And I share their beliefs on a lot of things.</v>

123
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 2>I just don't,</v>

124
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't share their methodology.</v>

125
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't share the,</v>

126
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.380
<v Speaker 2>the aggressive tactics and I just think that what they're doing is like an</v>

127
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 2>insanely short sided.</v>

128
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 2>They think that their Malcolm x or something,</v>

129
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 2>they think that they're like trying to fight the system by screaming,</v>

130
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:51.191
<v Speaker 2>yelling,</v>

131
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 2>fuck capitalism.</v>

132
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 2>And it's Kinda like the people who are born like after the 60s,</v>

133
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:57.200
<v Speaker 2>like they were born after the party you,</v>

134
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

135
00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 2>and then you could tell that it kind of pissed about it.</v>

136
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 2>My friend,</v>

137
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.960
<v Speaker 2>my friend Andy Sarabia and I were talking about this and uh,</v>

138
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

139
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.770
<v Speaker 2>we were talking a lot about like how basically they target you.</v>

140
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.161
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

141
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:09.311
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

142
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 2>so there are two gay guys who like had Ted Cruz over just like chat with him,</v>

143
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

144
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Because he's like running for president,</v>

145
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

146
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

147
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.630
<v Speaker 2>And these guys were targeted by all of these like gay social justice warrior</v>

148
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:20.280
<v Speaker 2>types being like,</v>

149
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.771
<v Speaker 2>just for talk,</v>

150
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:22.570
<v Speaker 2>just for talking to them like you're mainstreaming,</v>

151
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 2>his auntie gave you.</v>

152
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

153
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.030
<v Speaker 2>how are we supposed to persuade people of our views if we can't even like talk</v>

154
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:28.450
<v Speaker 2>to them</v>

155
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.900
<v Speaker 3>to all of this creeping in.</v>

156
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.840
<v Speaker 3>And there's a concept of moral luck,</v>

157
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:35.020
<v Speaker 3>which is due to the philosopher Thomas Nagel,</v>

158
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:35.261
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

159
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:36.700
<v Speaker 3>who's done a lot of interesting work,</v>

160
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

161
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.710
<v Speaker 3>half of which I really agree with.</v>

162
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:39.820
<v Speaker 3>And some of it I don't,</v>

163
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:44.821
<v Speaker 3>but the concept of moral luck is that it does seem unfair that there are many</v>

164
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:51.121
<v Speaker 3>situations in which people create immense harms doing stuff that you and I have</v>

165
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 3>gotten away with.</v>

166
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

167
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.591
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

168
00:04:56.591 --> 00:04:56.951
<v Speaker 3>they're not,</v>

169
00:04:56.951 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 3>they're not worse people than we are.</v>

170
00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.231
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

171
00:04:59.231 --> 00:04:59.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

172
00:04:59.441 --> 00:04:59.711
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

173
00:04:59.711 --> 00:04:59.891
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

174
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:00.191
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

175
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:03.700
<v Speaker 3>you and I have both driven when we shouldn't have driven,</v>

176
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:03.971
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

177
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 3>we had one beer,</v>

178
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:07.450
<v Speaker 3>too many or there were there things that we did,</v>

179
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:08.020
<v Speaker 3>or you're,</v>

180
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.471
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at,</v>

181
00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:09.430
<v Speaker 3>you look at a text,</v>

182
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:10.331
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

183
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:10.661
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

184
00:05:10.661 --> 00:05:12.340
<v Speaker 3>you should never look at your phone when you're driving,</v>

185
00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:12.720
<v Speaker 3>but you decide,</v>

186
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

187
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm expecting a text.</v>

188
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.190
<v Speaker 3>And you look,</v>

189
00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:19.240
<v Speaker 3>and there are people who are looking at that text right now and just,</v>

190
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

191
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 3>killing some child in the crosswalk,</v>

192
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.821
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

193
00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:24.740
<v Speaker 3>And their lives are going to be ruined and you know,</v>

194
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.670
<v Speaker 3>they're going to go to prison and they're exactly like you and me.</v>

195
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.001
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

196
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:28.330
<v Speaker 3>So there's a,</v>

197
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.780
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

198
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.640
<v Speaker 3>there's an aspect of luck here,</v>

199
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.270
<v Speaker 3>but that the luck actually propagates backward into the kind of brain you have,</v>

200
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:39.010
<v Speaker 3>the kind of upbringing you had,</v>

201
00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:40.090
<v Speaker 3>the kind of parents you had,</v>

202
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:40.421
<v Speaker 3>the kind of,</v>

203
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:40.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

204
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:44.590
<v Speaker 3>the fact that you got hit in the head as hard as you did or didn't and no one</v>

205
00:05:44.591 --> 00:05:45.371
<v Speaker 3>has made themselves.</v>

206
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:46.204
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

207
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.110
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

208
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little bit more,</v>

209
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm less judgmental about some of these things given my view of freewill,</v>

210
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.073
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not,</v>

211
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.380
<v Speaker 3>it's not that I'm not interested in making the interventions that would make a</v>

212
00:05:57.381 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 3>difference in whatever we could have done to have gotten him to behave</v>

213
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 3>differently.</v>

214
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 3>We should have done whatever we should need to do now to him to make society</v>

215
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 3>better and to make him better and to get restitution for the woman.</v>

216
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 3>What we should do.</v>

217
00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:10.251
<v Speaker 3>All that.</v>

218
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:14.870
<v Speaker 3>And so this doesn't tail locking up certain dangerous people and it doesn't</v>

219
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:15.704
<v Speaker 3>tail.</v>

220
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.903
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

221
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.361
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

222
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 3>we have to keep,</v>

223
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 3>keep ourselves safe from people who are going to reliably act badly.</v>

224
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.371
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

225
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:23.204
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

226
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.010
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know where he falls on that spectrum,</v>

227
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:26.120
<v Speaker 3>but it's just,</v>

228
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

229
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

230
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 3>the difference between the feeling you get when you hear,</v>

231
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:31.701
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

232
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 3>it was brain damage.</v>

233
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 3>I sort of have that feeling about everything.</v>

234
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.501
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

235
00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:36.750
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

236
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.990
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

237
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.641
<v Speaker 3>if we,</v>

238
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:38.900
<v Speaker 3>if he gets a brain scan,</v>

239
00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:40.640
<v Speaker 3>if he goes to trial now he gets a brain scan and we,</v>

240
00:06:40.641 --> 00:06:44.480
<v Speaker 3>and we find that his brain is just massively damaged and all the right areas</v>

241
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.910
<v Speaker 3>that would have eroded his impulse control.</v>

242
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:47.901
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

243
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 3>That would seem to let him off the hook a little bit.</v>

244
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:50.300
<v Speaker 3>It would,</v>

245
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.660
<v Speaker 3>he would,</v>

246
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.340
<v Speaker 3>he would look like someone who is unlucky more than he would look like a bad</v>

247
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:56.174
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

248
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

249
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.390
<v Speaker 3>And I sort of see bad people as unlucky to,</v>

250
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.940
<v Speaker 3>I recognize that there are certain people who are quite classically bad people.</v>

251
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:05.960
<v Speaker 3>There are psychopaths who you,</v>

252
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.480
<v Speaker 3>not only can you not rely on them,</v>

253
00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:08.631
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

254
00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:11.540
<v Speaker 3>you can rely on them to be bad actors,</v>

255
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:11.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

256
00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:11.951
<v Speaker 3>so you,</v>

257
00:07:11.951 --> 00:07:12.091
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

258
00:07:12.091 --> 00:07:12.924
<v Speaker 3>you have to,</v>

259
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.020
<v Speaker 3>you have to be in a posture of,</v>

260
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.820
<v Speaker 3>of self defense with respect to these people.</v>

261
00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:17.460
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

262
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.293
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

263
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.560
<v Speaker 3>I do view them as an unlucky on</v>

264
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:21.520
<v Speaker 4>some fundamental level.</v>

265
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.850
<v Speaker 4>It's the idea that you're going to arrive at some point or that you're going to</v>

266
00:07:24.851 --> 00:07:28.690
<v Speaker 4>land in this destination that is called success or happiness.</v>

267
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.160
<v Speaker 4>And when you get to our age,</v>

268
00:07:30.161 --> 00:07:30.931
<v Speaker 4>you realize that.</v>

269
00:07:30.931 --> 00:07:31.764
<v Speaker 4>And that's just,</v>

270
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:32.680
<v Speaker 4>that's an illusion,</v>

271
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.220
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

272
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.060
<v Speaker 4>It just continues.</v>

273
00:07:34.061 --> 00:07:35.290
<v Speaker 4>And you start to think about,</v>

274
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:35.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

275
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:36.970
<v Speaker 4>what your life means.</v>

276
00:07:36.971 --> 00:07:39.370
<v Speaker 4>What do you stand for and what is your legacy?</v>

277
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

278
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.140
<v Speaker 4>it's like we're approaching 50.</v>

279
00:07:41.141 --> 00:07:41.501
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

280
00:07:41.501 --> 00:07:43.300
<v Speaker 4>what do you know if I die today?</v>

281
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.501
<v Speaker 4>What was,</v>

282
00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:44.711
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

283
00:07:44.711 --> 00:07:45.190
<v Speaker 4>what did I,</v>

284
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.900
<v Speaker 4>what did I leave in my wake?</v>

285
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:47.171
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

286
00:07:47.171 --> 00:07:47.711
<v Speaker 2>even that,</v>

287
00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:48.190
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

288
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.680
<v Speaker 2>the bottom line is whatever you leave,</v>

289
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.370
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to matter because it's going to matter to some people that you</v>

290
00:07:54.371 --> 00:07:56.050
<v Speaker 2>know and they're going to leave too.</v>

291
00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's going to leave.</v>

292
00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.710
<v Speaker 2>But are you enjoying this?</v>

293
00:07:59.711 --> 00:08:00.910
<v Speaker 2>Are you enjoying the moment?</v>

294
00:08:00.911 --> 00:08:02.920
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's working towards this like ultimate,</v>

295
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.050
<v Speaker 2>like the retirement years,</v>

296
00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:06.140
<v Speaker 2>the golden years,</v>

297
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.560
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking almost dead when those years.</v>

298
00:08:08.561 --> 00:08:08.880
<v Speaker 2>Cotton,</v>

299
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.730
<v Speaker 2>like those little,</v>

300
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.360
<v Speaker 2>you see those people like holding hands and walking along,</v>

301
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.690
<v Speaker 2>they barely can walk.</v>

302
00:08:13.691 --> 00:08:14.524
<v Speaker 2>Their knees hurt,</v>

303
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.610
<v Speaker 2>they're all fucked up.</v>

304
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.500
<v Speaker 2>Like that's not what you work for.</v>

305
00:08:17.501 --> 00:08:21.340
<v Speaker 2>You don't work towards this ultimate point where you don't do anything anymore</v>

306
00:08:21.341 --> 00:08:22.270
<v Speaker 2>and that's ridiculous.</v>

307
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.430
<v Speaker 2>The way you should work towards is doing what you enjoy doing right now and</v>

308
00:08:27.431 --> 00:08:32.260
<v Speaker 2>enjoying your life right now and join your friends right now and join whatever</v>

309
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:33.850
<v Speaker 2>hobbies you like to pursue.</v>

310
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Whatever,</v>

311
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:34.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

312
00:08:34.991 --> 00:08:39.940
<v Speaker 2>love affairs and friendships and all that stuff is what life is,</v>

313
00:08:39.941 --> 00:08:42.670
<v Speaker 2>is life is the moment being in the moment.</v>

314
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.770
<v Speaker 2>And we somehow have turned it into this,</v>

315
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.640
<v Speaker 2>this weird like journey to have a very specific point,</v>

316
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.620
<v Speaker 2>specific points of high school graduation,</v>

317
00:08:53.621 --> 00:08:55.300
<v Speaker 2>college graduation,</v>

318
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.790
<v Speaker 2>but good job marriage,</v>

319
00:08:56.791 --> 00:08:57.624
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>

320
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.400
<v Speaker 2>we have all these like milestones that are supposed to impart happiness in this</v>

321
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:03.240
<v Speaker 2>race and they,</v>

322
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.411
<v Speaker 2>they're not real.</v>

323
00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 2>They're social constructs and we've,</v>

324
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:11.060
<v Speaker 2>we've created these social constructs and we've fed into them and pass them down</v>

325
00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:13.830
<v Speaker 2>from generation to generation without anybody stepping back and going,</v>

326
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.983
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

327
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.470
<v Speaker 2>who set this up?</v>

328
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:17.610
<v Speaker 2>Who set up,</v>

329
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.960
<v Speaker 2>who set up graduate school?</v>

330
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Who said it?</v>

331
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.513
<v Speaker 2>Who set up,</v>

332
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.110
<v Speaker 2>who set up common core?</v>

333
00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Who?</v>

334
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.120
<v Speaker 2>Who are these people like Hawaii?</v>

335
00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:24.954
<v Speaker 2>Why is,</v>

336
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 2>why is it this way?</v>

337
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:26.820
<v Speaker 2>What does it,</v>

338
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.820
<v Speaker 2>we're just biological organisms trying to have as much happiness and good</v>

339
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:34.380
<v Speaker 2>feeling while we're here as we can.</v>

340
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:44.330
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
