1
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:06.590
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're alive.</v>

3
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.850
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like that.</v>

4
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.340
<v Speaker 2>So thank you for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome.</v>

5
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.810
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Total pleasure.</v>

6
00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:14.240
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Happy to be in La are you?</v>

7
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.190
<v Speaker 2>I am always New York's could right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

8
00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

9
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like June ish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like an addictive relationship,</v>

10
00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:23.690
<v Speaker 2>but most of us would rather be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

11
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.830
<v Speaker 2>New York is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

12
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

13
00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:27.164
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

14
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.433
<v Speaker 2>you're a psychiatrist and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think that there was ample work </v>

15
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.463
<v Speaker 2>in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the environment that New York </v>

16
00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:37.820
<v Speaker 2>provides people stacked on top of each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

17
00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:40.190
<v Speaker 2>like that beep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beep Hong Kong.</v>

18
00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:41.024
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you all that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just assume all that stress </v>

19
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.910
<v Speaker 2>leads to a lot of people with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

20
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.860
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you're a fisherman,</v>

21
00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:50.120
<v Speaker 2>you want to live near a river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

22
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's fetishized in New York too,</v>

23
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.353
<v Speaker 2>to have a psychiatrist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of almost expected that you </v>

24
00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:56.510
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

25
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.290
<v Speaker 2>So not only is there like ample supply </v>
<v Speaker 2>and demand,</v>

26
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.730
<v Speaker 2>but then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

27
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.270
<v Speaker 2>it's a thing you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.761
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

29
00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:05.840
<v Speaker 2>what's that about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you explain that?</v>

30
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.090
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

31
00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 2>Woody Allen level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

32
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:11.054
<v Speaker 2>Like sort of embracing your shadow and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's something refreshing about </v>

33
00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:14.714
<v Speaker 2>it because we don't pretend to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're deeply not okay in New </v>

34
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.600
<v Speaker 2>York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chronically bullied someone.</v>

35
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in general anywhere.</v>

36
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.690
<v Speaker 2>Is there a spot like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

37
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got it nailed.</v>

38
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's this term actually in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical literature,</v>

39
00:01:27.981 --> 00:01:28.814
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>called Paleo deficit disorder and it </v>

40
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:34.730
<v Speaker 2>just refers to like how far have you </v>
<v Speaker 2>strayed from the path in your lifestyle?</v>

41
00:01:34.731 --> 00:01:37.280
<v Speaker 2>Like basic stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>greenspace movement,</v>

42
00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:38.114
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>

43
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.320
<v Speaker 2>And I would imagine that if you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>more of those components intact,</v>

44
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.840
<v Speaker 2>you're probably a bit more okay than if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're living,</v>

45
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.063
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

46
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.053
<v Speaker 2>In midtown Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Seattle in the summer to me is a </v>

47
00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:55.940
<v Speaker 2>really good place because it's so green </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's so pretty.</v>

48
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.450
<v Speaker 2>And the ocean's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're getting some good air and then</v>

49
00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:01.250
<v Speaker 2>you're getting sun cause it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>summer.</v>

50
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:04.190
<v Speaker 2>So you don't have to seasonal depression</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that goes on.</v>

51
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean I imagine they're doing better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing it,</v>

52
00:02:06.821 --> 00:02:07.970
<v Speaker 2>they've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never know.</v>

53
00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:09.560
<v Speaker 2>I've heard it's like crazy beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

54
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.030
<v Speaker 2>it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>

55
00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:11.864
<v Speaker 2>But those winners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get to you after the 30th day </v>

56
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:16.010
<v Speaker 2>around and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

57
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.950
<v Speaker 2>this is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how much water do you need?</v>

58
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big winter complainer and I have been my</v>

59
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:23.054
<v Speaker 2>whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I complain 10 months of the year of </v>

60
00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:26.084
<v Speaker 2>what it's like to live in the northeast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But recently I've been playing around </v>

61
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:32.750
<v Speaker 2>with the idea that there's actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>something cool about like,</v>

62
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of cyclical living.</v>

63
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.483
<v Speaker 2>It's almost just like if you embrace it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's something just like </v>

64
00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:45.641
<v Speaker 2>everything did and miserable for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>period of time and then it blooms.</v>

65
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.180
<v Speaker 2>You're getting to experience like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>rebirth and then it,</v>

66
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flourishes and then it dies again.</v>

67
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.040
<v Speaker 2>But there's another perspective on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually being,</v>

68
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you work with it,</v>

69
00:02:57.201 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 2>it's sorta like a woman who's on birth </v>
<v Speaker 2>control</v>

70
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 3>has no idea that there's any point to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

71
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cycle of energy over the course of the</v>

72
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 3>month range.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She sort of thinks is that,</v>

73
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 3>that's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's a way you can wrap your mind</v>

74
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:12.540
<v Speaker 3>around it where you work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

75
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 3>So like if you're on birth control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have no menstrual cycle,</v>

76
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're just like,</v>

77
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 3>you're like a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like a flat line the whole month.</v>

78
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 3>But there's actually something really </v>
<v Speaker 3>empowering if you understand how to work</v>

79
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 3>with your energy shifts because </v>
<v Speaker 3>naturally like a woman's natural men,</v>

80
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 3>I know this is really what you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be talking about,</v>

81
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's salient to me.</v>

82
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 3>So I do want to hear like I figured this</v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

83
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm 39 I was on birth control for 12 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

84
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:39.664
<v Speaker 3>so I never knew what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it meant to have like a menstrual </v>

85
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:44.500
<v Speaker 3>cycle until very recently.</v>

86
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 3>Cause then I had two kids breastfeeding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a couple of decades into my life,</v>

87
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:48.844
<v Speaker 3>I'm just figuring this out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you have like totally different </v>

88
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:51.874
<v Speaker 3>kinds of energy over the course of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>month and you have to know how to work </v>

89
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:55.384
<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a kind of energy that you </v>

90
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 3>want to go out and socialize or you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to stay in and work or you want to sleep</v>

91
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:03.700
<v Speaker 3>more or less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't know how to ride that,</v>

92
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 3>then you could be sort of taken off </v>
<v Speaker 3>guard by it.</v>

93
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.653
<v Speaker 3>But if you know how to work with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so much more powerful than just </v>

94
00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 3>having this like artificial hijacking of</v>
<v Speaker 3>your endocrine system.</v>

95
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.103
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's like some sort of analogy to </v>

96
00:04:16.431 --> 00:04:17.264
<v Speaker 4>be drawn between the cycles of nature </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the cycles of your body month to </v>

97
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.943
<v Speaker 4>month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

98
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.780
<v Speaker 4>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have never considered that.</v>

99
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:24.763
<v Speaker 4>I never even thought about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have thought about birth control </v>

100
00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:27.734
<v Speaker 4>before about how crazy it is that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>give a woman a hormone that convinces </v>

101
00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:35.330
<v Speaker 4>her body that she's perpetually pregnant</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that a giant percentage of women are</v>

102
00:04:35.331 --> 00:04:39.470
<v Speaker 4>on it for convenience or even from other</v>
<v Speaker 4>medical issues like skin issues.</v>

103
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.180
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

104
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.841
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

105
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always been a feminist,</v>

106
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even when I was younger and very much</v>

107
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 3>asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I identified as a feminist and I was one</v>

108
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 3>of those people who thought that birth </v>
<v Speaker 3>control was like a female entitlement.</v>

109
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 3>Like how dare you not make this free and</v>
<v Speaker 3>widely available.</v>

110
00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.293
<v Speaker 3>But as I began to research more about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and more about how it's in many ways </v>

111
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 3>like the ultimate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

112
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:04.984
<v Speaker 3>not to sound too inflammatory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the ultimate tool for oppression of </v>

113
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.993
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the modern woman now I find it </v>

114
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.870
<v Speaker 3>incredible that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

115
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.170
<v Speaker 3>there were still taking it because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>seems like a good idea,</v>

116
00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:18.004
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who wants to deal with your annoying </v>

117
00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:20.290
<v Speaker 3>menstrual cycle?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who wants to get pregnant,</v>

118
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 3>who wants to have endometriosis or </v>
<v Speaker 3>polycystic ovary,</v>

119
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.513
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who wants to have acne or like hair </v>

120
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:30.340
<v Speaker 3>growing in weird places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's the magic pill illusion.</v>

121
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.370
<v Speaker 3>There's no free lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's never going to be something that</v>

122
00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:37.090
<v Speaker 3>just fixes it for you and you just waltz</v>
<v Speaker 3>off into the sunset.</v>

123
00:05:37.091 --> 00:05:40.600
<v Speaker 3>There's always a cost and the cost is so</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more vast,</v>

124
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:41.434
<v Speaker 3>like ranging from literally death all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way to just like subtle alterations </v>

125
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:48.430
<v Speaker 3>in your personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like the fear Moans,</v>

126
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.290
<v Speaker 3>you secrete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

127
00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:53.410
<v Speaker 3>and there there was just a million woman</v>
<v Speaker 3>study,</v>

128
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.313
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Scandinavia that showed about the </v>

129
00:05:55.841 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 3>vast increase in antidepressant</v>

130
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.850
<v Speaker 2>prescribing for teenagers who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>prescribed birth control.</v>

131
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:02.684
<v Speaker 2>So it's the beginning of sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a gateway drug sometimes for </v>

132
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.290
<v Speaker 2>psych meds to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend who,</v>

133
00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:10.124
<v Speaker 2>one of his good friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his daughter died from some </v>

134
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 2>complications with taking birth control </v>
<v Speaker 2>pills and smoking cigarettes.</v>

135
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulmonary embolism,</v>

136
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:19.274
<v Speaker 2>probably smoking cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently along with the birth control </v>

137
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:25.520
<v Speaker 2>pills are extremely dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so many do it of course.</v>

138
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 2>And you don't even have to have that </v>
<v Speaker 2>additional risk factor,</v>

139
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause birth control,</v>

140
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the pill or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the Nuva ring by itself has that,</v>

141
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:34.844
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm contacted often by parents of girls </v>

142
00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 2>who have died from pulmonary embolism </v>
<v Speaker 2>who've now become like activists in this</v>

143
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 2>realm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because of birth control pills.</v>

144
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

145
00:06:44.491 --> 00:06:45.324
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a known mechanism and it's a </v>

146
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 2>known risk factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think that's not being suppressed</v>

147
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:50.564
<v Speaker 2>or hidden.</v>

148
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:51.523
<v Speaker 2>It's just that we're sort of in trained </v>
<v Speaker 2>to dismiss the risks as we attached to </v>

149
00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:56.774
<v Speaker 2>the promise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we sort of like collude and ignoring </v>

150
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 2>that potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

151
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.453
<v Speaker 2>That's so interesting because most </v>
<v Speaker 2>people when they think about the birth </v>

152
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:04.994
<v Speaker 2>control pill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think about it as something that </v>

153
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:07.440
<v Speaker 2>liberated women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

154
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:08.683
<v Speaker 2>They can control whether or not they got</v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnant and they were allowed for the </v>

155
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:12.884
<v Speaker 2>first time to have careers and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they wanted to because they </v>

156
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:17.990
<v Speaker 2>didn't have to worry about being </v>
<v Speaker 2>trapped.</v>

157
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.030
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a story,</v>

158
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.300
<v Speaker 2>but that's the biological free lunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

159
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:24.134
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's isn't there also a lot of </v>

160
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Ryan was on here at Dr Chris Ryan,</v>

161
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:28.814
<v Speaker 2>the author of sex at dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was on here and he was talking about </v>

162
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:36.830
<v Speaker 2>how women can look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you smell the clothes of other men,</v>

163
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.280
<v Speaker 2>you can literally tell the men that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are attracted to,</v>

164
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.323
<v Speaker 2>you would be biologically compatible </v>
<v Speaker 2>with those men and that when they did </v>

165
00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:46.670
<v Speaker 2>these same studies on women who are on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the birth control pill,</v>

166
00:07:46.671 --> 00:07:47.960
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't smell the difference.</v>

167
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.520
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called the t shirt study.</v>

168
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:50.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that work?</v>

169
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:52.310
<v Speaker 2>Could you explain that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

170
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.233
<v Speaker 2>essentially the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the premise of pharmaceutical medicine </v>

171
00:07:56.391 --> 00:07:57.224
<v Speaker 2>is that you can just pull like one </v>
<v Speaker 2>little thread of the spider web and </v>

172
00:08:00.921 --> 00:08:01.754
<v Speaker 2>leave the rest of it intact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everything else is going to be </v>

173
00:08:03.521 --> 00:08:05.960
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're only working on this one area.</v>

174
00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:09.050
<v Speaker 2>So with birth control for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea is we're just,</v>

175
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking over the management of your sex </v>

176
00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:14.360
<v Speaker 2>hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the rest of your body is going to be</v>

177
00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 2>totally unaffected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course as we learn more about how</v>

178
00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:22.580
<v Speaker 2>all of these systems are totally an </v>
<v Speaker 2>inextricably interconnected,</v>

179
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.640
<v Speaker 2>we have a better understanding of how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

180
00:08:25.641 --> 00:08:26.474
<v Speaker 2>when you interfere with sex hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also potentially have other effects </v>

181
00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:32.130
<v Speaker 2>including,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

182
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.650
<v Speaker 2>raising things called binding Globulin </v>
<v Speaker 2>is including inflammatory response.</v>

183
00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:39.380
<v Speaker 2>You're depleting a number of nutrients </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're having,</v>

184
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's possible that we,</v>

185
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.053
<v Speaker 2>we haven't even begun to look through </v>
<v Speaker 2>the keyhole of the effects on brain and </v>

186
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:47.653
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of neuropeptides and these arenas </v>

187
00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:53.300
<v Speaker 2>where we don't have any idea what </v>
<v Speaker 2>pheromonal secretion is about.</v>

188
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.340
<v Speaker 2>Like we just have to defer the </v>
<v Speaker 2>probability</v>

189
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 3>that our bodies are more complex than </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've.</v>

190
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:04.620
<v Speaker 3>Right and like began to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your biology is meant to guide you.</v>

191
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.740
<v Speaker 3>It's meant to empower you and it's meant</v>
<v Speaker 3>to create a sense of vitality.</v>

192
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:14.460
<v Speaker 3>If you can inhabit your body and be in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>truce with it.</v>

193
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:15.653
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mindset of birth control is I'm just </v>

194
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:19.170
<v Speaker 3>going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

195
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.690
<v Speaker 3>take this over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to some manage this.</v>

196
00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:22.813
<v Speaker 3>And so who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe even it's a top down like mindset </v>

197
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.600
<v Speaker 3>thing that begins to sort of divorce you</v>
<v Speaker 3>from your sensibilities.</v>

198
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.270
<v Speaker 3>We don't really know is the point that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>

199
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.910
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be a common answer I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think I have to give you is that we,</v>

200
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.650
<v Speaker 3>we don't really know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

201
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.050
<v Speaker 3>it does make sense that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

202
00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:43.680
<v Speaker 3>the subtle nature of your biology that </v>
<v Speaker 3>involves,</v>

203
00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:44.514
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of guiding your human interactions </v>

204
00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:49.590
<v Speaker 3>and particularly sex related </v>
<v Speaker 3>interactions is going to be derailed.</v>

205
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low libido is one of,</v>

206
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.670
<v Speaker 3>ironically the most common,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

207
00:09:53.671 --> 00:09:56.460
<v Speaker 3>disclosed side effects of birth control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're,</v>

208
00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.860
<v Speaker 3>you're taking it so that you can have </v>
<v Speaker 3>unprotected sex.</v>

209
00:09:58.861 --> 00:10:01.540
<v Speaker 3>We don't feel like having sex ultimately</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyways.</v>

210
00:10:01.541 --> 00:10:04.350
<v Speaker 3>So it's not even really that well </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought out,</v>

211
00:10:04.351 --> 00:10:06.540
<v Speaker 3>I think by most of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very bizarre.</v>

212
00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:10.470
<v Speaker 3>But what other alternatives are there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're a woman and you want to</v>

213
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:13.050
<v Speaker 3>have control of whether or not you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>pregnant,</v>

214
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.840
<v Speaker 3>there's not a whole lot of options other</v>
<v Speaker 3>than weird ones like Iud,</v>

215
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.840
<v Speaker 3>which seemed real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

216
00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:22.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean there is some of my patients use </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's called a copper iud.</v>

217
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.183
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny cause I had one put in and </v>

218
00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:26.754
<v Speaker 3>two and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it costs like $700 and two and a half </v>

219
00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:28.854
<v Speaker 3>weeks later I had it taken out because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>just felt weird about having like a </v>

220
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.020
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical metal and mind.</v>

221
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:35.670
<v Speaker 3>And my body was about like a tracking </v>
<v Speaker 3>device.</v>

222
00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:37.790
<v Speaker 3>It felt like feel it and there are no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

223
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.630
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not really a thing.</v>

224
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.430
<v Speaker 3>It's just like psychologically it felt </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>

225
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.010
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use something called a daisy,</v>

226
00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:46.800
<v Speaker 3>which is like this highly calibrated </v>
<v Speaker 3>thermometer.</v>

227
00:10:46.801 --> 00:10:48.300
<v Speaker 3>I need track your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

228
00:10:48.301 --> 00:10:50.430
<v Speaker 3>cause you have six fertile days a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This isn't,</v>

229
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:51.383
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some major sacrifice you have to </v>

230
00:10:53.521 --> 00:10:54.354
<v Speaker 3>make in order to learn how your cycle </v>
<v Speaker 3>works and then you get the benefits of </v>

231
00:10:57.931 --> 00:11:02.430
<v Speaker 3>being in your hormonal millia you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's not,</v>

232
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.250
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that complicated,</v>

233
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.770
<v Speaker 3>but there's a learning curve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

234
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:08.613
<v Speaker 3>requires like learning how to be a woman</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also sharing the onus because you </v>

235
00:11:13.101 --> 00:11:13.934
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all of these side effects had been </v>

236
00:11:14.401 --> 00:11:15.480
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

237
00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:16.314
<v Speaker 3>there was like a male birth control </v>
<v Speaker 3>study that was just terminated because </v>

238
00:11:18.871 --> 00:11:22.050
<v Speaker 3>of how many side effects like the men </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't want to deal with.</v>

239
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:22.883
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's such this socio cultural </v>

240
00:11:23.911 --> 00:11:24.744
<v Speaker 3>double standard around this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if we're talking about six days a </v>

241
00:11:26.731 --> 00:11:27.564
<v Speaker 3>month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like have we collaborate and try and </v>

242
00:11:28.681 --> 00:11:29.870
<v Speaker 3>figure something out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

243
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.713
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't involve a risk of death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps this daisy thing just monitors </v>

244
00:11:34.651 --> 00:11:37.230
<v Speaker 3>or temperature and tells you exactly </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on.</v>

245
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.093
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a little more sophisticated </v>

246
00:11:39.001 --> 00:11:39.834
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It actually has the efficacy like above </v>

247
00:11:41.071 --> 00:11:44.460
<v Speaker 3>99% efficacy if you listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the,</v>

248
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>room for human error,</v>

249
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.393
<v Speaker 3>but it basically just tells you like </v>
<v Speaker 3>have sex now if you want to conceive or </v>

250
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:54.250
<v Speaker 3>if you don't then don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a little like a light's green,</v>

251
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.050
<v Speaker 2>red or yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

252
00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.190
<v Speaker 2>how many women are on birth control?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had to guess nationwide?</v>

253
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

254
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.090
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the stat off hand.</v>

255
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:08.163
<v Speaker 2>Upwards of like 10 million I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's a growing number of people </v>

256
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:15.320
<v Speaker 2>taking some sort of substance that </v>
<v Speaker 2>alters the,</v>

257
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:17.920
<v Speaker 2>the very nature of who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

258
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:18.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

259
00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:19.294
<v Speaker 2>my interest in it really came from </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the psychiatric side effects </v>

260
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.470
<v Speaker 2>because I'm very interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>medications that have potential,</v>

261
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.353
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gateway effects around psychiatric meds </v>

262
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.540
<v Speaker 2>that we aren't informing women have </v>
<v Speaker 2>before they start the prescription.</v>

263
00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:35.560
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

264
00:12:35.561 --> 00:12:37.990
<v Speaker 2>whether it's like acid blocking </v>
<v Speaker 2>medications,</v>

265
00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:39.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or antibiotics,</v>

266
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

267
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:41.853
<v Speaker 2>birth control of vaccines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things have known a psycho </v>

268
00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:47.650
<v Speaker 2>biological effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know that,</v>

269
00:12:47.651 --> 00:12:48.484
<v Speaker 2>then you'll never connect the dots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you end up in the polypharmacy </v>

270
00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:52.084
<v Speaker 2>realm where you're taking multiple meds </v>
<v Speaker 2>without ever knowing where the dominoes </v>

271
00:12:55.751 --> 00:12:57.010
<v Speaker 2>like started to fall.</v>

272
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.310
<v Speaker 2>I remember there was a commercial they </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to have,</v>

273
00:13:00.311 --> 00:13:01.144
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they're still there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was for a psychiatric medication </v>

274
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:05.853
<v Speaker 2>that you take who's an antidepressant </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you are depressed from </v>

275
00:13:08.861 --> 00:13:12.280
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I'm talking about?</v>

276
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.920
<v Speaker 2>I think you've probably talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>abilify.</v>

277
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:19.150
<v Speaker 2>It was actually the number one </v>
<v Speaker 2>prescription in America recently.</v>

278
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an anti psychotic,</v>

279
00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.980
<v Speaker 2>you read the side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Whoa,</v>

280
00:13:23.981 --> 00:13:25.900
<v Speaker 2>slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is this?</v>

281
00:13:25.901 --> 00:13:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Like psychotic thoughts and death and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

282
00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.453
<v Speaker 2>bleeding and right and if what you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking that had similar side effects </v>

283
00:13:33.491 --> 00:13:36.010
<v Speaker 2>isn't working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can just layer this on.</v>

284
00:13:36.011 --> 00:13:38.200
<v Speaker 2>It's very common practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare.</v>

285
00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:42.310
<v Speaker 2>I would say actually for people to be on</v>
<v Speaker 2>just one psychiatric med.</v>

286
00:13:42.311 --> 00:13:46.180
<v Speaker 2>It's almost an industry standard to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking upwards of,</v>

287
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:47.320
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

288
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:48.760
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

289
00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:51.670
<v Speaker 2>sometimes even five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of the patients I work with come to</v>

290
00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:54.190
<v Speaker 2>me on a cocktail of like five medics.</v>

291
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.740
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

292
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're chasing something for like years,</v>

293
00:13:58.481 --> 00:13:59.314
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're never really gonna feel </v>

294
00:14:01.721 --> 00:14:02.554
<v Speaker 2>yourself the way you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I've found is really </v>

295
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.480
<v Speaker 2>what we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

296
00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:10.330
<v Speaker 2>like we just want to feel comfortable in</v>
<v Speaker 2>her own skin.</v>

297
00:14:10.331 --> 00:14:12.900
<v Speaker 2>We just want to feel ourselves like in </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact,</v>

298
00:14:12.901 --> 00:14:14.030
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

299
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:14.913
<v Speaker 2>be her or him or be rich are beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just want to feel cool being who we </v>

300
00:14:18.491 --> 00:14:20.110
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're never going to,</v>

301
00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:21.783
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very unlikely you'd feel that </v>

302
00:14:23.081 --> 00:14:23.914
<v Speaker 2>way while on a medication that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness altering effects and a </v>

303
00:14:28.871 --> 00:14:29.704
<v Speaker 2>slew of side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you're going to be chasing that </v>

304
00:14:31.451 --> 00:14:33.340
<v Speaker 2>with other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the promise of other meds,</v>

305
00:14:33.341 --> 00:14:34.174
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a stimulant because you're a paxil is </v>

306
00:14:35.861 --> 00:14:36.694
<v Speaker 2>making you tired and then you need a </v>
<v Speaker 2>benzodiazepine because you can't sleep </v>

307
00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:42.340
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're sort of depressed again.</v>

308
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.590
<v Speaker 2>And so you have another antidepressant </v>
<v Speaker 2>layered on.</v>

309
00:14:44.591 --> 00:14:46.990
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a fad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

310
00:14:46.991 --> 00:14:48.060
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

311
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:52.880
<v Speaker 2>bipolar to medication that you could try</v>
<v Speaker 2>out like lamictal or abilify.</v>

312
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.193
<v Speaker 2>And so this is sort of the culturally </v>
<v Speaker 2>sanctioned approach to mental health </v>

313
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.560
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

314
00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.413
<v Speaker 2>So how does the doctor know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like say if you think they put you on </v>

315
00:15:04.281 --> 00:15:08.000
<v Speaker 2>some zoloft or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not to pick on Zoloft,</v>

316
00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:09.440
<v Speaker 2>but then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>

317
00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:10.274
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not really totally doing it </v>

318
00:15:11.991 --> 00:15:12.800
<v Speaker 2>for Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

319
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.690
<v Speaker 2>we're thinking about stack and abilify </v>
<v Speaker 2>in with the Zoloft and I think that just</v>

320
00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:19.220
<v Speaker 2>might be the ticket to your happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

321
00:15:19.221 --> 00:15:20.054
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

322
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's important to remember,</v>

323
00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:25.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like particularly in psychiatry,</v>

324
00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:30.220
<v Speaker 2>there's no objective testing measure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a broken arm like,</v>

325
00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see you have a broken arm.</v>

326
00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.100
<v Speaker 2>We're going to put your arm in a cast </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the broken arm.</v>

327
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.310
<v Speaker 2>You can get an x ray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

328
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:35.901
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Improve.</v>

329
00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:36.900
<v Speaker 2>They have a broken arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

330
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:38.600
<v Speaker 2>In psychiatry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no blood test.</v>

331
00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:40.370
<v Speaker 2>There's no eeg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

332
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scan of any kind.</v>

333
00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:44.990
<v Speaker 2>It's a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes as short as 10 minutes.</v>

334
00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.140
<v Speaker 2>If I came into your office and my office</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a little different,</v>

335
00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:51.570
<v Speaker 2>but just say if you were a regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychiatrist and I'm like,</v>

336
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.270
<v Speaker 2>ah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno Kelly.</v>

337
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't keep it together.</v>

338
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.560
<v Speaker 2>What do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do I take?</v>

339
00:15:57.561 --> 00:15:58.394
<v Speaker 2>Could you just start someone off on like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a low dose of something and see if it </v>

340
00:16:00.951 --> 00:16:03.620
<v Speaker 2>helps and they come back and a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks like how does it work?</v>

341
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like an art form.</v>

342
00:16:06.021 --> 00:16:06.854
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have your personal favorite </v>
<v Speaker 2>medications that you feel comfortable </v>

343
00:16:09.891 --> 00:16:12.560
<v Speaker 2>prescribing so you're more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prescribe them.</v>

344
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:14.230
<v Speaker 2>But then also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is also,</v>

345
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.313
<v Speaker 2>you know in the literature itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a patient comes in asking for a </v>

346
00:16:18.471 --> 00:16:19.304
<v Speaker 2>particular medication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you 49% I think it was like of </v>

347
00:16:23.871 --> 00:16:24.704
<v Speaker 2>prescriptions that are written are </v>
<v Speaker 2>written because of specific patient </v>

348
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:27.410
<v Speaker 2>requests.</v>

349
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.900
<v Speaker 2>So like where are people getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

350
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.063
<v Speaker 2>They're getting these ideas from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that we are one of three countries </v>

351
00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:36.920
<v Speaker 2>in the world that allows for direct to </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumer advertising.</v>

352
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:38.450
<v Speaker 2>North Korea and Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

353
00:16:38.451 --> 00:16:40.100
<v Speaker 2>it's surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's surprising.</v>

354
00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.560
<v Speaker 2>Brazil and New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

355
00:16:42.561 --> 00:16:44.600
<v Speaker 2>That is surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird,</v>

356
00:16:44.601 --> 00:16:45.434
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It confuses the hell out of me when I </v>

357
00:16:46.971 --> 00:16:47.804
<v Speaker 2>watch those commercials and those like </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful piano music playing and </v>

358
00:16:50.481 --> 00:16:54.140
<v Speaker 2>there's cartoon flowers are smiling and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody was brainwashed.</v>

359
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:58.360
<v Speaker 2>What are they selling me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they know it works.</v>

360
00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:03.580
<v Speaker 2>Ask Your doctor multibillionaires are </v>
<v Speaker 2>put into those commercials.</v>

361
00:17:03.681 --> 00:17:04.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for good reason.</v>

362
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:05.773
<v Speaker 2>So there's no real like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not like a blood test or </v>

363
00:17:09.291 --> 00:17:10.970
<v Speaker 2>something they give you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>

364
00:17:10.971 --> 00:17:13.460
<v Speaker 2>I think this is going to be the ticket </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>

365
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:15.441
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

366
00:17:15.441 --> 00:17:17.150
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very impressionistic.</v>

367
00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.980
<v Speaker 2>And that's sort of the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

368
00:17:18.981 --> 00:17:23.960
<v Speaker 2>the diagnostic and statistical manual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the DSM is sort of the dictionary,</v>

369
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:25.490
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in psychiatry.</v>

370
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:26.323
<v Speaker 2>And like in the 50s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like 150 pages and now it's 886 </v>

371
00:17:32.091 --> 00:17:32.924
<v Speaker 2>pages and it's grown in volume largely </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the consensus decisions of a </v>

372
00:17:39.411 --> 00:17:42.200
<v Speaker 2>bunch of older white men sitting around </v>
<v Speaker 2>a table.</v>

373
00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:47.030
<v Speaker 2>You say the bane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

374
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost all of them have industry ties.</v>

375
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:50.483
<v Speaker 2>And this is out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't like a conspiracy theory on </v>

376
00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:57.390
<v Speaker 2>my mom was a nurse and she was always </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling me that,</v>

377
00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

378
00:17:58.531 --> 00:17:59.364
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get taken out on these really nice </v>

379
00:18:00.301 --> 00:18:01.134
<v Speaker 2>dinners by these pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies to take it to a real nice </v>

380
00:18:03.421 --> 00:18:04.254
<v Speaker 2>restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buy steak and champagne potato and </v>

381
00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:08.820
<v Speaker 2>everybody could have a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

382
00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:13.330
<v Speaker 2>they would be so willing to be like very</v>
<v Speaker 2>complimentary of this medication.</v>

383
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.193
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a girl took this and it really </v>

384
00:18:15.241 --> 00:18:18.280
<v Speaker 2>helped her a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you doctor Kinesin and I'm like,</v>

385
00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:19.123
<v Speaker 2>I was in that generation to where I got </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken out to five star restaurants in </v>

386
00:18:23.731 --> 00:18:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan all the time.</v>

387
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:25.403
<v Speaker 2>It's by you stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels really good because you're </v>

388
00:18:27.151 --> 00:18:29.670
<v Speaker 2>making like 20 grand a year working your</v>
<v Speaker 2>ass off.</v>

389
00:18:29.671 --> 00:18:33.030
<v Speaker 2>And so when someone takes you to a fancy</v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant with your friends,</v>

390
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.930
<v Speaker 2>but you could convince yourself that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not actually going to,</v>

391
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:37.833
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're an intellectual and you're </v>

392
00:18:38.341 --> 00:18:39.174
<v Speaker 2>gonna make your own decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But all of the data suggest otherwise </v>

393
00:18:41.971 --> 00:18:46.110
<v Speaker 2>that you are unduly influenced by that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of courtship behavior.</v>

394
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.180
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

395
00:18:48.181 --> 00:18:49.890
<v Speaker 2>So we have this like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

396
00:18:49.891 --> 00:18:50.724
<v Speaker 2>sort of collusion on the part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor and the patients to support </v>

397
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.060
<v Speaker 2>industry interests over any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any sort of,</v>

398
00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.633
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shred of a scientific or evidence based </v>

399
00:19:00.451 --> 00:19:01.284
<v Speaker 2>process for really diagnosing someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when we're talking about </v>

400
00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:05.184
<v Speaker 2>something that is so subjective where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like a broken arm or a like a </v>

401
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.990
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a broken arm.</v>

402
00:19:09.991 --> 00:19:12.840
<v Speaker 2>Like I know what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to set your arm in a cast.</v>

403
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're feeling down,</v>

404
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.670
<v Speaker 2>hey man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

405
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.920
<v Speaker 2>They even ask you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does this,</v>

406
00:19:19.921 --> 00:19:20.754
<v Speaker 2>this does a normal cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I guess like someone who's really </v>

407
00:19:22.951 --> 00:19:23.784
<v Speaker 2>good wood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is your diet and your sleep </v>

408
00:19:26.851 --> 00:19:27.684
<v Speaker 2>patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a consideration before they </v>

409
00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:32.100
<v Speaker 2>prescribe medication medication?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

410
00:19:32.101 --> 00:19:33.270
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

411
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:34.283
<v Speaker 2>most sorta turncoat doctors like me will</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you that we have one hour of </v>

412
00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:43.860
<v Speaker 2>nutrition education in all of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>medical school and residency training.</v>

413
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:44.703
<v Speaker 2>One keeping you a turncoat or you like </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered like a rat bad person in the </v>

414
00:19:48.851 --> 00:19:49.684
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not welcome in the highly calls </v>

415
00:19:51.211 --> 00:19:52.120
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I lost,</v>

416
00:19:52.121 --> 00:19:55.370
<v Speaker 2>saw my faculty positions and yeah.</v>

417
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:03.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I guess the kind of science that</v>

418
00:20:03.601 --> 00:20:06.330
<v Speaker 2>I bring to the table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not my own,</v>

419
00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:07.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any original ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

420
00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:08.913
<v Speaker 2>I am really good I think at curating </v>
<v Speaker 2>information and collecting it and </v>

421
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.410
<v Speaker 2>synthesizing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>presenting it,</v>

422
00:20:13.411 --> 00:20:14.244
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I have to shine a light on is </v>

423
00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:18.630
<v Speaker 2>very inconvenient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

424
00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:23.810
<v Speaker 2>science for industry interest but also </v>
<v Speaker 2>for conventional practice because,</v>

425
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.223
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't prescribe medication anymore </v>

426
00:20:27.121 --> 00:20:29.800
<v Speaker 2>under any circumstances ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

427
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:34.850
<v Speaker 2>but I do have an entire practice devoted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to taking people off of medication.</v>

428
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.083
<v Speaker 2>So I have sort of my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a lot based on lifestyle </v>

429
00:20:40.141 --> 00:20:41.490
<v Speaker 2>changes you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

430
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:42.893
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have your methodology as an</v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative to prescribing and you're </v>

431
00:20:46.771 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 2>going to what a</v>

432
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.450
<v Speaker 3>lot of the science says that condemns </v>
<v Speaker 3>the pharmaceutical approach,</v>

433
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.300
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do instead?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just invested $200,000</v>

434
00:20:55.301 --> 00:20:56.740
<v Speaker 3>of debt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blood,</v>

435
00:20:56.741 --> 00:20:57.610
<v Speaker 3>sweat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and tears,</v>

436
00:20:57.611 --> 00:21:00.150
<v Speaker 3>indentured servitude for like a decade </v>
<v Speaker 3>of your training.</v>

437
00:21:00.151 --> 00:21:01.930
<v Speaker 3>You're just going to give that up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

438
00:21:01.931 --> 00:21:02.764
<v Speaker 3>So it's a lot to expect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The average psychiatrist who </v>

439
00:21:05.531 --> 00:21:07.270
<v Speaker 3>acknowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

440
00:21:07.271 --> 00:21:11.020
<v Speaker 3>anything beyond what's called like </v>
<v Speaker 3>consensus medicine.</v>

441
00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:14.860
<v Speaker 3>It's called that because it doesn't even</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a connection to the evidence.</v>

442
00:21:14.861 --> 00:21:15.694
<v Speaker 3>It's not evidence based.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just they all agree on it and </v>

443
00:21:17.981 --> 00:21:19.660
<v Speaker 3>they're just going to keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

444
00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.360
<v Speaker 5>So this consensus medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like in psychiatry,</v>

445
00:21:22.361 --> 00:21:26.710
<v Speaker 5>there's kind of like this understanding </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you don't criticize the system that</v>

446
00:21:26.711 --> 00:21:29.440
<v Speaker 5>everybody's operating under.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just work within that system.</v>

447
00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you bother?</v>

448
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:31.953
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause just going to get you to be </v>

449
00:21:33.311 --> 00:21:37.390
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable for you is going to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>you in trouble and there's no incentive.</v>

450
00:21:37.391 --> 00:21:38.224
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I read more science than probably </v>

451
00:21:39.761 --> 00:21:40.594
<v Speaker 3>all my conventional colleagues put </v>
<v Speaker 3>together because I have a lot of </v>

452
00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:45.730
<v Speaker 3>incentive to do so because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>practicing outside of the,</v>

453
00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gold standard so to speak.</v>

454
00:21:48.611 --> 00:21:52.240
<v Speaker 3>So when you're in the fold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would you bother reading science?</v>

455
00:21:52.241 --> 00:21:54.820
<v Speaker 3>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just do what you are taught to do.</v>

456
00:21:54.821 --> 00:21:56.170
<v Speaker 3>Don't question it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

457
00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.420
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

458
00:21:58.570 --> 00:21:59.403
<v Speaker 3>the reason that lifestyle is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>presented as a relevant factor in </v>

459
00:22:05.081 --> 00:22:10.081
<v Speaker 3>conventional medicine is because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>flies in the face of the whole model,</v>

460
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.253
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the model is still a gene based </v>

461
00:22:12.881 --> 00:22:15.460
<v Speaker 3>model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still are born with it.</v>

462
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:17.770
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like coddling the victim.</v>

463
00:22:17.771 --> 00:22:19.240
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing you can do about it.</v>

464
00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.073
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you better just be a good boy and take </v>

465
00:22:22.031 --> 00:22:25.960
<v Speaker 3>your medication is the only thing you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can do because diet doesn't matter,</v>

466
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:27.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you're,</v>

467
00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huffing fumes through your window.</v>

468
00:22:30.011 --> 00:22:30.844
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter whether you're eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>six cans of tuna day and mercury </v>

469
00:22:33.671 --> 00:22:34.630
<v Speaker 3>poisoning yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does it,</v>

470
00:22:34.631 --> 00:22:38.500
<v Speaker 3>none of that matters really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's like of minor interest,</v>

471
00:22:38.501 --> 00:22:43.420
<v Speaker 3>but the real problem is your inborn </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetic chemical imbalance,</v>

472
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if that is the premise,</v>

473
00:22:45.671 --> 00:22:46.504
<v Speaker 3>and it's not just in psychiatry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in all of medicine is gene based </v>

474
00:22:49.271 --> 00:22:50.104
<v Speaker 3>determinism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freeze Pharma to offer the only </v>

475
00:22:53.081 --> 00:22:57.040
<v Speaker 3>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it actually validates people on some</v>

476
00:22:57.041 --> 00:22:59.140
<v Speaker 3>level as the victim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

477
00:22:59.141 --> 00:23:02.410
<v Speaker 3>So like a lot of people want to feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>weirdly,</v>

478
00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:04.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

479
00:23:04.781 --> 00:23:07.300
<v Speaker 3>like their own victimization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels comfortable.</v>

480
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:08.483
<v Speaker 5>And even though there's science that </v>
<v Speaker 5>supports that having a healthy nutrient </v>

481
00:23:12.071 --> 00:23:12.904
<v Speaker 5>dense diet allows your body to produce </v>
<v Speaker 5>the all the healthy hormones and </v>

482
00:23:17.921 --> 00:23:20.320
<v Speaker 5>chemicals and neurotransmitters and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>of that.</v>

483
00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.840
<v Speaker 5>And then along with exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which also increases,</v>

484
00:23:22.841 --> 00:23:23.674
<v Speaker 5>it is having,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there were studies also that show that </v>

485
00:23:25.631 --> 00:23:28.630
<v Speaker 5>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>regular aerobics exercise in particular,</v>

486
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:29.763
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it does as much to treat depression as </v>

487
00:23:32.531 --> 00:23:33.370
<v Speaker 5>ssrs</v>

488
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.593
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more actually because the efficacy of </v>

489
00:23:36.651 --> 00:23:39.740
<v Speaker 3>most antidepressants is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>embarrassing.</v>

490
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:40.790
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

491
00:23:40.791 --> 00:23:44.660
<v Speaker 3>to be frank because if you really dig </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the literature,</v>

492
00:23:44.661 --> 00:23:47.240
<v Speaker 3>it's what you think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

493
00:23:47.241 --> 00:23:49.640
<v Speaker 3>in terms of really being a viable </v>
<v Speaker 3>treatment option,</v>

494
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:54.590
<v Speaker 3>so many of these natural alternatives </v>
<v Speaker 3>like far out pace,</v>

495
00:23:54.591 --> 00:23:57.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean things even like herbs like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tumeric or acupuncture,</v>

496
00:23:57.861 --> 00:23:59.120
<v Speaker 3>Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

497
00:23:59.121 --> 00:24:01.700
<v Speaker 3>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's just a single intervention.</v>

498
00:24:01.701 --> 00:24:04.520
<v Speaker 3>So there's nothing miraculous about my </v>
<v Speaker 3>approach.</v>

499
00:24:04.521 --> 00:24:05.354
<v Speaker 3>It's basically just putting all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things together at once for like a </v>

500
00:24:08.061 --> 00:24:08.894
<v Speaker 3>synergistic effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can send your body and mind is </v>

501
00:24:11.511 --> 00:24:13.520
<v Speaker 3>like a signal of safety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

502
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:16.550
<v Speaker 3>And it works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

503
00:24:16.551 --> 00:24:17.384
<v Speaker 3>So if you're just doing one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things in isolation and even one of </v>

504
00:24:20.031 --> 00:24:23.630
<v Speaker 3>those things is more effective than you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

505
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.493
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really comes down to the mindset </v>

506
00:24:26.211 --> 00:24:27.044
<v Speaker 3>because if you wanted an a pill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be challenging for you to </v>

507
00:24:30.081 --> 00:24:32.990
<v Speaker 3>get results through effort or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavioral.</v>

508
00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.453
<v Speaker 3>So the mindset piece has become a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>focus for me as being maybe the most </v>

509
00:24:37.311 --> 00:24:42.311
<v Speaker 3>important determinant of what's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be an effective intervention piece.</v>

510
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.823
<v Speaker 3>Meaning meaning what you believe like </v>
<v Speaker 3>about health and if you want to believe </v>

511
00:24:49.371 --> 00:24:50.204
<v Speaker 3>that you're broken and that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chemicals aren't necessary to manage </v>

512
00:24:53.811 --> 00:24:55.560
<v Speaker 3>your scary body.</v>

513
00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.530
<v Speaker 5>I've changed a lot of smart people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>believe that.</v>

514
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:59.210
<v Speaker 5>I have a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's a scientist,</v>

515
00:24:59.211 --> 00:25:00.044
<v Speaker 5>she's very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's on antidepressants and if you </v>

516
00:25:01.341 --> 00:25:02.174
<v Speaker 5>talked to her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she will argue to the death and these </v>

517
00:25:03.831 --> 00:25:06.710
<v Speaker 5>are critical for her life and that she </v>
<v Speaker 5>needs him.</v>

518
00:25:06.711 --> 00:25:07.544
<v Speaker 5>And she has some sort of a brain </v>
<v Speaker 5>imbalance and it's no different than </v>

519
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:12.150
<v Speaker 5>having you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some other organ in your body.</v>

520
00:25:12.151 --> 00:25:14.540
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't function properly and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>need medication for that.</v>

521
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:15.403
<v Speaker 5>We've been told,</v>

522
00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.740
<v Speaker 3>I was told that and I believe that for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

523
00:25:17.741 --> 00:25:19.810
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the analogy is often,</v>

524
00:25:19.811 --> 00:25:22.750
<v Speaker 3>well it's like insulin to a diabetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing.</v>

525
00:25:22.751 --> 00:25:27.700
<v Speaker 3>And the more you challenge that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>stigmatizing mental illness and how dare</v>

526
00:25:27.701 --> 00:25:28.211
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

527
00:25:28.211 --> 00:25:30.460
<v Speaker 3>I've been accused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

528
00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:35.490
<v Speaker 3>I've been accused of shaming women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is of course the last,</v>

529
00:25:36.521 --> 00:25:38.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all I care about is,</v>

530
00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:42.700
<v Speaker 3>is empowering women around their health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally I wake up every single day and</v>

531
00:25:42.701 --> 00:25:45.760
<v Speaker 3>devote my life to that purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the last thing I have any intention</v>

532
00:25:45.761 --> 00:25:47.780
<v Speaker 3>of doing is shaming anyone who's made </v>
<v Speaker 3>this decision.</v>

533
00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:48.813
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just whenever something make </v>

534
00:25:49.201 --> 00:25:50.870
<v Speaker 5>someone uncomfortable with their </v>
<v Speaker 5>choices,</v>

535
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.810
<v Speaker 5>they immediately want to turn someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>else into a,</v>

536
00:25:53.811 --> 00:25:56.180
<v Speaker 5>an aggressor or someone who is </v>
<v Speaker 5>victimizing them.</v>

537
00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.351
<v Speaker 5>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

538
00:25:57.351 --> 00:26:01.390
<v Speaker 5>this woman that I'm friends with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's unfortunate because I feel like,</v>

539
00:26:01.391 --> 00:26:02.690
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if she exercised,</v>

540
00:26:02.691 --> 00:26:05.090
<v Speaker 5>at least she would know that she doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>exercise.</v>

541
00:26:05.091 --> 00:26:05.924
<v Speaker 5>So if you don't exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you don't really know if that would </v>

542
00:26:07.821 --> 00:26:08.654
<v Speaker 5>help.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

543
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:10.063
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I hate to be that guy because I </v>

544
00:26:11.811 --> 00:26:12.990
<v Speaker 5>already am,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

545
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.020
<v Speaker 5>like that proselytizing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to work out.</v>

546
00:26:15.021 --> 00:26:16.550
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's fucking annoying.</v>

547
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.930
<v Speaker 5>It's like the crossfit person or the </v>
<v Speaker 5>proselytizing Vegan or whatever,</v>

548
00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:25.610
<v Speaker 5>a new cult member.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just want to talk forever about it.</v>

549
00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.310
<v Speaker 5>Still never going to convince someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>why people to hate you.</v>

550
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.990
<v Speaker 5>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's like the,</v>

551
00:26:29.991 --> 00:26:31.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you bring a horse to water thing,</v>

552
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:32.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't,</v>

553
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:36.200
<v Speaker 5>can't make it happen of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there is more.</v>

554
00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:37.043
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

555
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:38.610
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

556
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.300
<v Speaker 3>then I think ever before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people are ready and once they have</v>

557
00:26:42.301 --> 00:26:44.060
<v Speaker 3>the information it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

558
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.570
<v Speaker 3>usually like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they just transferred.</v>

559
00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:46.573
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these conversations are happening now </v>

560
00:26:47.451 --> 00:26:49.340
<v Speaker 4>more and more with people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

561
00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:52.130
<v Speaker 4>where they're starting to look at like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

562
00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.590
<v Speaker 4>what is it in my life that's causing me </v>
<v Speaker 4>stress?</v>

563
00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:55.603
<v Speaker 4>What is it in my life that is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>depleting my sleep patterns or my </v>

564
00:27:00.051 --> 00:27:00.884
<v Speaker 4>health?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have I ever gotten my blood test done </v>

565
00:27:02.691 --> 00:27:04.430
<v Speaker 4>and find out where my nutrient levels </v>
<v Speaker 4>are?</v>

566
00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:06.290
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

567
00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:11.291
<v Speaker 4>and everybody's nutrient needs are very </v>
<v Speaker 4>different biologically.</v>

568
00:27:11.361 --> 00:27:13.730
<v Speaker 4>People like people are going to respond </v>
<v Speaker 4>differently to drugs.</v>

569
00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.650
<v Speaker 4>People are gonna respond differently to </v>
<v Speaker 4>food.</v>

570
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.903
<v Speaker 4>It's just we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we come from different parts of the </v>

571
00:27:18.021 --> 00:27:19.700
<v Speaker 4>world and some people need different </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

572
00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.673
<v Speaker 3>And this is being called like an of one </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine and meaning like meaning the </v>

573
00:27:24.251 --> 00:27:27.760
<v Speaker 3>number of people in a study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like the phrases and of one medicine,</v>

574
00:27:27.761 --> 00:27:29.830
<v Speaker 3>because we're beginning to understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly what you're saying,</v>

575
00:27:29.831 --> 00:27:32.650
<v Speaker 3>which is that it's you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is your thing.</v>

576
00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.860
<v Speaker 3>This is your journey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is very specific to you,</v>

577
00:27:35.861 --> 00:27:36.880
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

578
00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:39.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your depression let's say,</v>

579
00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:42.700
<v Speaker 3>could be because you have a b,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 deficiency.</v>

580
00:27:42.701 --> 00:27:44.800
<v Speaker 3>It could be because you have low thyroid</v>
<v Speaker 3>function.</v>

581
00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.020
<v Speaker 3>It could be because you're taking birth </v>
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

582
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:50.830
<v Speaker 3>It could be because you know your dog </v>
<v Speaker 3>died.</v>

583
00:27:50.831 --> 00:27:53.410
<v Speaker 3>It could be because you have a shitty </v>
<v Speaker 3>job that you hate.</v>

584
00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.510
<v Speaker 3>It could be because your marriage has to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

585
00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:59.230
<v Speaker 3>And it could be because you're ready for</v>
<v Speaker 3>some psycho spiritual emergence,</v>

586
00:27:59.231 --> 00:28:00.064
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you are the only one who really </v>

587
00:28:02.171 --> 00:28:03.004
<v Speaker 3>knows and who really can figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we on the conventional side of </v>

588
00:28:07.271 --> 00:28:09.430
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seek to depersonalize it.</v>

589
00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.660
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not you,</v>

590
00:28:10.661 --> 00:28:11.494
<v Speaker 3>it has nothing to do with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a chemical process that's </v>

591
00:28:13.571 --> 00:28:17.460
<v Speaker 3>unfolding and you need this one size </v>
<v Speaker 3>fits all intervention.</v>

592
00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:20.070
<v Speaker 4>It's very disingenuous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also a super common.</v>

593
00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:25.170
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that weird that that everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's the access to the data is</v>

594
00:28:25.171 --> 00:28:27.480
<v Speaker 4>there for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's there for psychiatrists as well.</v>

595
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.930
<v Speaker 4>Like they would know the efficiency or </v>
<v Speaker 4>the effectiveness rather of exercise.</v>

596
00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.240
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

597
00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.073
<v Speaker 3>But that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really coming down to like almost </v>

598
00:28:35.661 --> 00:28:39.350
<v Speaker 3>religious level belief systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like either you believe,</v>

599
00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.630
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I used to ps.</v>

600
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:45.230
<v Speaker 3>Either you believe that we're sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>machines,</v>

601
00:28:45.231 --> 00:28:46.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like as Alan Watts would say,</v>

602
00:28:46.491 --> 00:28:49.970
<v Speaker 3>we're like flesh robots on a dead rock </v>
<v Speaker 3>floating in the middle of nowhere.</v>

603
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
<v Speaker 3>So everything is purposeless and random </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just bad luck and bad genes.</v>

604
00:28:55.431 --> 00:28:56.264
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the other shoe could fall at </v>

605
00:28:57.951 --> 00:28:58.784
<v Speaker 3>any moment and life is just the hustle </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're just trying to survive and </v>

606
00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.390
<v Speaker 3>you got to avail yourself of real </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine,</v>

607
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:06.463
<v Speaker 3>which is pharmaceutical medicines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only legit option and you just got </v>

608
00:29:09.501 --> 00:29:10.334
<v Speaker 3>to do it and you know what you want some</v>
<v Speaker 3>credit for even having the courage to </v>

609
00:29:12.501 --> 00:29:14.480
<v Speaker 3>actually take the steps to take your </v>
<v Speaker 3>meds.</v>

610
00:29:14.481 --> 00:29:16.520
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's one mindset.</v>

611
00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:20.120
<v Speaker 3>And then the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is I believe growing,</v>

612
00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:24.770
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we have no idea what we're doing</v>

613
00:29:24.771 --> 00:29:25.670
<v Speaker 3>scientifically.</v>

614
00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:27.710
<v Speaker 3>And we're just looking through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>keyhole.</v>

615
00:29:27.711 --> 00:29:28.544
<v Speaker 3>And Science is a process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a destination where the </v>

616
00:29:31.371 --> 00:29:33.050
<v Speaker 3>science is settled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My favorite phrase,</v>

617
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:36.200
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the body itself has this,</v>

618
00:29:36.201 --> 00:29:37.034
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chiropractors call it vitalism like has </v>

619
00:29:38.301 --> 00:29:43.301
<v Speaker 3>this innate wisdom and it doesn't make </v>
<v Speaker 3>mistakes.</v>

620
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.320
<v Speaker 3>Like it doesn't mess up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every single thing your body is doing is</v>

621
00:29:47.321 --> 00:29:50.710
<v Speaker 3>in wise response to a perceived,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

622
00:29:50.711 --> 00:29:51.670
<v Speaker 3>stimulus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

623
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.910
<v Speaker 3>And Diseases of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer,</v>

624
00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:56.140
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

625
00:29:56.141 --> 00:29:58.900
<v Speaker 3>It would include without exception,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without an,</v>

626
00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:01.530
<v Speaker 3>I could explain what I mean by that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

627
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.051
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

628
00:30:02.051 --> 00:30:06.100
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if I have an ache or a pain or I,</v>

629
00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:09.730
<v Speaker 3>my hair's falling out or I have a tumor </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing out of the side of my body,</v>

630
00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:15.910
<v Speaker 3>my first response it's possible could be</v>
<v Speaker 3>curiosity.</v>

631
00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:18.910
<v Speaker 3>Like it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this about,</v>

632
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where am I off?</v>

633
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:22.863
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because in like indigenous cultures for </v>

634
00:30:23.981 --> 00:30:24.814
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>illness is not like something that your </v>

635
00:30:27.491 --> 00:30:28.660
<v Speaker 3>body is doing.</v>

636
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.250
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

637
00:30:30.251 --> 00:30:34.030
<v Speaker 3>sort of manifestation of things out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>balance with you and your soul,</v>

638
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.073
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you and the relationships in your </v>

639
00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:39.340
<v Speaker 3>life with you and nature and maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 3>collective itself.</v>

640
00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:40.503
<v Speaker 3>So it's this expression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's this physical manifestation of </v>

641
00:30:42.581 --> 00:30:43.414
<v Speaker 3>something much deeper that has roots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And until you understand what those </v>

642
00:30:46.571 --> 00:30:48.940
<v Speaker 3>roots are for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you won't resolve it.</v>

643
00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:49.863
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Serious errors like birth defects and </v>

644
00:30:51.401 --> 00:30:52.234
<v Speaker 3>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not like a wise response to </v>

645
00:30:54.371 --> 00:30:55.151
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

646
00:30:55.151 --> 00:30:57.700
<v Speaker 3>It's an error.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good question.</v>

647
00:30:57.701 --> 00:30:58.534
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

648
00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.373
<v Speaker 3>the sort of like congenital question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're just like born without a </v>

649
00:31:03.401 --> 00:31:04.234
<v Speaker 3>leg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could take it to the extent </v>

650
00:31:06.431 --> 00:31:07.450
<v Speaker 3>where you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

651
00:31:07.451 --> 00:31:10.930
<v Speaker 3>so what drove the birth defect?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether it was some sort of,</v>

652
00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:11.891
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

653
00:31:11.891 --> 00:31:15.100
<v Speaker 3>so let's back up a second because Epi </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetics,</v>

654
00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:15.963
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the word de jure for beyond or above </v>

655
00:31:20.171 --> 00:31:22.390
<v Speaker 3>actually technically jeans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

656
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:23.223
<v Speaker 3>So there's the genes are interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but perhaps as insignificant as like 1% </v>

657
00:31:27.221 --> 00:31:28.870
<v Speaker 3>of what makes us sick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

658
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.780
<v Speaker 3>Or well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we never studied what makes us well it's</v>

659
00:31:31.781 --> 00:31:32.614
<v Speaker 3>like a total black box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But epigenetics is like how does the </v>

660
00:31:35.681 --> 00:31:37.660
<v Speaker 3>environment impact our genes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

661
00:31:37.661 --> 00:31:40.240
<v Speaker 3>So you could argue that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>congenital,</v>

662
00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:41.283
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of malformations and things like </v>

663
00:31:42.311 --> 00:31:43.144
<v Speaker 3>that because this was an area of study </v>
<v Speaker 3>for me when I was prescribing to </v>

664
00:31:45.161 --> 00:31:46.960
<v Speaker 3>pregnant women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which believe it or not,</v>

665
00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:51.670
<v Speaker 3>was my specialty prescribing psychiatric</v>
<v Speaker 3>meds to two pregnant women.</v>

666
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.903
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it is a risk in response to that </v>

667
00:31:55.541 --> 00:31:56.374
<v Speaker 3>exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's the body's method of adapting </v>

668
00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:04.150
<v Speaker 3>to an exposure or is it just an error?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone's born without a leg,</v>

669
00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:05.253
<v Speaker 3>what kind of adaptation is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like so just some sort of a </v>

670
00:32:07.811 --> 00:32:08.860
<v Speaker 3>genetic error.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

671
00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:11.770
<v Speaker 3>it depends how you want to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

672
00:32:11.771 --> 00:32:12.604
<v Speaker 3>to me there are no errors because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>body is responding to a perceived </v>

673
00:32:15.881 --> 00:32:18.670
<v Speaker 3>stimulus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now if you throw a lot of toxicity,</v>

674
00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:20.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the way of your body,</v>

675
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:23.980
<v Speaker 3>there may be a limit to which a can or </v>
<v Speaker 3>will accommodate.</v>

676
00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:25.293
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause like something confusing for me </v>

677
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.440
<v Speaker 3>was at one point I was reflecting on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that,</v>

678
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:30.303
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've had all of these environmental </v>

679
00:32:31.871 --> 00:32:34.210
<v Speaker 3>exposures for like about a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred and 50 years.</v>

680
00:32:34.211 --> 00:32:36.970
<v Speaker 3>Like since the industrial revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

681
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.090
<v Speaker 3>So we like live totally different lives </v>
<v Speaker 3>now is all</v>

682
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:40.943
<v Speaker 2>these toxic exposures that we sit all </v>
<v Speaker 2>day and we don't sleep and we have </v>

683
00:32:43.881 --> 00:32:48.200
<v Speaker 2>Monsanto and all the rest pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 2>for like the past 100 years or so.</v>

684
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:53.060
<v Speaker 2>We can adapt like my body is adapting </v>
<v Speaker 2>within the hours that were,</v>

685
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:54.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging out.</v>

686
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:58.700
<v Speaker 2>So why would it not have adapted over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the past 100 years?</v>

687
00:32:58.701 --> 00:32:59.534
<v Speaker 2>And like a Paleo argument is like we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolves the same way for 95% of our </v>

688
00:33:05.541 --> 00:33:06.374
<v Speaker 2>evolution and in now we just haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken enough time to evolve to catch up </v>

689
00:33:11.931 --> 00:33:14.420
<v Speaker 2>with today's modern influences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

690
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:15.763
<v Speaker 2>But I actually think we're not meant to </v>
<v Speaker 2>accommodate this and we will self </v>

691
00:33:19.281 --> 00:33:21.860
<v Speaker 2>extinguish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if we don't course correct,</v>

692
00:33:21.861 --> 00:33:22.694
<v Speaker 2>which I have faith we will do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're not meant to adapt to this </v>

693
00:33:25.161 --> 00:33:28.570
<v Speaker 2>kind of lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

694
00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.680
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chemicals,</v>

695
00:33:30.681 --> 00:33:33.410
<v Speaker 2>you know of people if we don't course </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct,</v>

696
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.850
<v Speaker 2>I think we will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's pretty much like,</v>

697
00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:41.660
<v Speaker 2>I think even though we could </v>
<v Speaker 2>biologically adapt,</v>

698
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.823
<v Speaker 2>I think we won't because there is like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cosmic intelligence that is holding us </v>

699
00:33:48.111 --> 00:33:53.111
<v Speaker 2>accountable to a certain level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>respect for this human organism.</v>

700
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:56.060
<v Speaker 2>A certain level of respect for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>privilege of being alive.</v>

701
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:58.700
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way we're living today,</v>

702
00:33:58.701 --> 00:34:03.050
<v Speaker 2>just like trashing ourselves and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trashing this planet is in,</v>

703
00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:05.810
<v Speaker 2>is a violation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I dunno,</v>

704
00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.860
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a subtle point,</v>

705
00:34:06.861 --> 00:34:09.500
<v Speaker 2>but I think the point is we're not going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to adapt,</v>

706
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:11.270
<v Speaker 2>so don't wait for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

707
00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:13.730
<v Speaker 2>and we're just going to get sicker and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sicker and sicker and die and,</v>

708
00:34:13.731 --> 00:34:17.000
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps that is the most intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>

709
00:34:17.001 --> 00:34:18.830
<v Speaker 2>Doom and gloom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

710
00:34:18.831 --> 00:34:23.831
<v Speaker 2>I said it's going to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember the sacrifice for productivity,</v>

711
00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.093
<v Speaker 2>the daily sacrifice for productivity </v>
<v Speaker 2>that comes at the expense of health and </v>

712
00:34:27.861 --> 00:34:30.650
<v Speaker 2>happiness is the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

713
00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:32.493
<v Speaker 2>that's what a lot of people deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They deal with having bills and like as </v>

714
00:34:36.081 --> 00:34:36.914
<v Speaker 2>you were pointing about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pointing out about exorbitant medical </v>

715
00:34:39.111 --> 00:34:39.870
<v Speaker 2>bills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

716
00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:40.703
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many people that are in the medical </v>

717
00:34:41.541 --> 00:34:42.374
<v Speaker 2>industry start their practice or start </v>
<v Speaker 2>practicing being a doctor of </v>

718
00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:49.100
<v Speaker 2>professional doctor with a quarter </v>
<v Speaker 2>million dollar debt.</v>

719
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:50.720
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is crazy.</v>

720
00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:53.550
<v Speaker 2>It's so much money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy.</v>

721
00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:54.703
<v Speaker 2>It's so what a terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's almost mandatory for any </v>

722
00:34:59.781 --> 00:35:00.830
<v Speaker 2>civilization?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

723
00:35:00.831 --> 00:35:01.664
<v Speaker 2>you need health care for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to be able to take care of </v>

724
00:35:02.931 --> 00:35:04.370
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got an idea.</v>

725
00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:05.473
<v Speaker 2>Let's take those people that you need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make these critical decisions to save </v>

726
00:35:07.911 --> 00:35:08.744
<v Speaker 2>your life and let's fuck them over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's saddle those people up with crazy </v>

727
00:35:12.891 --> 00:35:15.420
<v Speaker 2>debt and leave them trapped in a world </v>
<v Speaker 2>of stress.</v>

728
00:35:15.421 --> 00:35:18.050
<v Speaker 2>And I got an even better idea when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going through the residency.</v>

729
00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.580
<v Speaker 2>Let's not let them sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

730
00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.073
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keeping caffeinated sugar and work and </v>

731
00:35:23.061 --> 00:35:24.110
<v Speaker 2>give them pills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give them,</v>

732
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:26.450
<v Speaker 2>giving them amphetamines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

733
00:35:26.451 --> 00:35:28.370
<v Speaker 2>give him adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need a prescription,</v>

734
00:35:28.371 --> 00:35:30.500
<v Speaker 2>sally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you tired Sally?</v>

735
00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:33.470
<v Speaker 2>I got a little pick me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called adderall sweetie.</v>

736
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:35.510
<v Speaker 2>It's not your fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got Adhd,</v>

737
00:35:35.511 --> 00:35:37.670
<v Speaker 2>d s t u P</v>

738
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:41.400
<v Speaker 5>qrs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's how it's like a hazing.</v>

739
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.520
<v Speaker 5>It's a hazing process,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not unlike the military.</v>

740
00:35:44.521 --> 00:35:45.271
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

741
00:35:45.271 --> 00:35:47.670
<v Speaker 5>so that you remain loyal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

742
00:35:47.671 --> 00:35:50.520
<v Speaker 5>that's obviously one perspective on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is what I'm saying,</v>

743
00:35:50.521 --> 00:35:52.470
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I was $200,000</v>

744
00:35:52.471 --> 00:35:53.304
<v Speaker 5>in debt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It took a lot for me to just like jump </v>

745
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.560
<v Speaker 5>ship and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

746
00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:56.420
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

747
00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.290
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>invested that and I'm just going to walk</v>

748
00:35:58.291 --> 00:36:00.240
<v Speaker 5>away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most people,</v>

749
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:02.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are not in a position to do that.</v>

750
00:36:02.641 --> 00:36:04.390
<v Speaker 5>And perhaps that's part of the design.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno.</v>

751
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:06.030
<v Speaker 5>Well I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if it's not designed,</v>

752
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:06.893
<v Speaker 5>it's a very efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 5>efficient survival mechanism for the </v>

753
00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:10.190
<v Speaker 5>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

754
00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:11.043
<v Speaker 5>it just seems like one of the worst ways</v>
<v Speaker 5>for someone to start a career in taking </v>

755
00:36:15.181 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 5>care of people's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be all fucked up themselves,</v>

756
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:20.740
<v Speaker 5>but they need to be broken down in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>way to stay in line.</v>

757
00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:22.830
<v Speaker 5>And that's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just basic,</v>

758
00:36:22.831 --> 00:36:23.664
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of hierarchical systems work this </v>

759
00:36:26.401 --> 00:36:27.234
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is no conspiracy or is it people </v>

760
00:36:29.791 --> 00:36:30.624
<v Speaker 5>just taking advantage of this need and </v>
<v Speaker 5>being greedy and just charging </v>

761
00:36:35.161 --> 00:36:35.994
<v Speaker 5>exorbitant amounts of money and having </v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing subsidized by the </v>

762
00:36:38.911 --> 00:36:40.890
<v Speaker 5>government.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that could be expensive.</v>

763
00:36:40.891 --> 00:36:41.724
<v Speaker 5>And then the whole thing is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And also here's the big one that a lot </v>

764
00:36:44.461 --> 00:36:45.990
<v Speaker 5>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe if you're a kid,</v>

765
00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:51.020
<v Speaker 5>you're not aware of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your student loans you til you're dead.</v>

766
00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.750
<v Speaker 5>You cannot get out of those fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you can get out.</v>

767
00:36:54.751 --> 00:36:56.400
<v Speaker 5>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could buy Ferrari,</v>

768
00:36:56.401 --> 00:36:59.100
<v Speaker 5>you could be stupid and buy a Ferrari </v>
<v Speaker 5>and go God damn it,</v>

769
00:36:59.101 --> 00:36:59.934
<v Speaker 5>I can't afford this car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you go bankrupt and they will allow </v>

770
00:37:03.151 --> 00:37:04.460
<v Speaker 5>you to go bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

771
00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:05.910
<v Speaker 5>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That can happen.</v>

772
00:37:05.911 --> 00:37:08.040
<v Speaker 5>You can have a business,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make terrible decisions,</v>

773
00:37:08.041 --> 00:37:08.874
<v Speaker 5>lose all your money would go bankrupt </v>
<v Speaker 5>and literally be absolved of your debt </v>

774
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:14.400
<v Speaker 5>except your student loans.</v>

775
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.720
<v Speaker 5>That shit is into your DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They keep you,</v>

776
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:21.510
<v Speaker 5>you have to pay that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to,</v>

777
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:22.583
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so nuts how much money it is when </v>

778
00:37:25.561 --> 00:37:30.561
<v Speaker 5>you find out what the student loan </v>
<v Speaker 5>industry is in this country and how much</v>

779
00:37:30.601 --> 00:37:32.760
<v Speaker 5>money children go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

780
00:37:32.761 --> 00:37:34.470
<v Speaker 5>you're a fucking child when you're 18 </v>
<v Speaker 5>years old,</v>

781
00:37:34.471 --> 00:37:35.304
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you make some ridiculous decision to </v>

782
00:37:36.901 --> 00:37:37.734
<v Speaker 5>go to some school and you get some grant</v>
<v Speaker 5>or you get some sort of scholarship and </v>

783
00:37:41.131 --> 00:37:41.964
<v Speaker 5>then the rest of it you're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>loans or whatever the hell your </v>

784
00:37:44.191 --> 00:37:45.024
<v Speaker 5>situation is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you get out of four years and </v>

785
00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:50.880
<v Speaker 5>then you go and do your masters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You go and do some graduate work.</v>

786
00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.410
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're funds,</v>

787
00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:54.960
<v Speaker 5>you're fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're so broke.</v>

788
00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:57.000
<v Speaker 5>And then if you get out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are the odds?</v>

789
00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:59.310
<v Speaker 5>You even get a job in your field.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

790
00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.473
<v Speaker 5>you have to scramble to try to make some</v>
<v Speaker 5>money and then you have this never </v>

791
00:38:03.811 --> 00:38:08.811
<v Speaker 5>ending pool of debt that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>suck a little bit out of every month.</v>

792
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:13.350
<v Speaker 5>It's like living for the oasis on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>horizon,</v>

793
00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.570
<v Speaker 5>but that's what we do in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

794
00:38:15.571 --> 00:38:18.180
<v Speaker 5>We just are constantly waiting for it to</v>
<v Speaker 5>feel okay.</v>

795
00:38:18.181 --> 00:38:20.070
<v Speaker 5>Constantly waiting to until we get </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

796
00:38:20.071 --> 00:38:22.980
<v Speaker 5>We're not getting there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that free education,</v>

797
00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:23.883
<v Speaker 5>if it would be possible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it is possible to do it without </v>

798
00:38:26.521 --> 00:38:29.280
<v Speaker 5>ruining the educational system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it's not already ruined,</v>

799
00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:30.533
<v Speaker 5>if it is possible to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'd be like one of the best things we </v>

800
00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:33.624
<v Speaker 5>could ever do for young people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just keep them from being saddled down </v>

801
00:38:37.211 --> 00:38:40.630
<v Speaker 5>with some bullshit that you have to keep</v>
<v Speaker 5>with you for the rest of your life.</v>

802
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:43.210
<v Speaker 5>Say you like are handicapped out the </v>
<v Speaker 5>gate.</v>

803
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:45.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy and it also,</v>

804
00:38:45.461 --> 00:38:46.294
<v Speaker 5>it inhibits any risk taking it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have any chance like to </v>

805
00:38:50.171 --> 00:38:52.870
<v Speaker 5>jump ship and try something new.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe you're doing something,</v>

806
00:38:52.871 --> 00:38:55.060
<v Speaker 5>but all the while you have this idea of </v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

807
00:38:55.061 --> 00:38:57.130
<v Speaker 5>I thank think this is really what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be doing.</v>

808
00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:59.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm always thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to take a chance,</v>

809
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.273
<v Speaker 5>but I have this fucking debt and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>only way to really pay this debt off is </v>

810
00:39:02.741 --> 00:39:04.780
<v Speaker 5>if I enter into this same,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

811
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:05.783
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a really important point because </v>

812
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:10.480
<v Speaker 5>if you sort of look across dimensions </v>
<v Speaker 5>culturally,</v>

813
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:15.130
<v Speaker 5>they're all geared towards supporting a </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain kind of mindset and mentality,</v>

814
00:39:15.131 --> 00:39:17.230
<v Speaker 5>which is productivity oriented,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

815
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:20.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>capitalism and consumer supportive.</v>

816
00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:21.490
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in terms of that,</v>

817
00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:24.010
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of financial apparatus.</v>

818
00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:27.310
<v Speaker 5>And so the things and elements,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

819
00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.260
<v Speaker 5>like Graham Hancock has talked about </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

820
00:39:29.261 --> 00:39:31.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the elements that are convenient to that</v>

821
00:39:31.451 --> 00:39:32.284
<v Speaker 5>paradigm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>including psychiatric meds and even </v>

822
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:34.263
<v Speaker 5>alcohol on some level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like these more sort of suppressive </v>

823
00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:40.690
<v Speaker 5>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>suppressive tools are sanctioned.</v>

824
00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:43.990
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the things that would encourage risk</v>

825
00:39:43.991 --> 00:39:46.540
<v Speaker 5>taking and courage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>creative expression and courage,</v>

826
00:39:46.541 --> 00:39:47.374
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of consciousness expansion are </v>

827
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:51.470
<v Speaker 5>demonized her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

828
00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.730
<v Speaker 5>rendered illegal because they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>inconvenient to the paradigm,</v>

829
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:55.480
<v Speaker 5>I guess.</v>

830
00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.313
<v Speaker 5>But honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a victim of circumstance </v>

831
00:39:58.061 --> 00:39:59.130
<v Speaker 5>more than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I,</v>

832
00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.970
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not necessarily,</v>

833
00:40:00.971 --> 00:40:05.710
<v Speaker 5>I believe that when the psychedelic act </v>
<v Speaker 5>of 1970 was put into play,</v>

834
00:40:05.711 --> 00:40:06.544
<v Speaker 5>it was clearly put it into play because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they were trying to arrest people that </v>

835
00:40:10.091 --> 00:40:12.400
<v Speaker 5>were in the civil rights movement and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the antiwar movement.</v>

836
00:40:12.401 --> 00:40:13.234
<v Speaker 5>That's been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's been proven that there was a </v>

837
00:40:14.171 --> 00:40:15.004
<v Speaker 5>collusion and that what they were trying</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do was make it so that they could go </v>

838
00:40:18.371 --> 00:40:21.520
<v Speaker 5>after these people in the civil rights </v>
<v Speaker 5>movement go after these people that were</v>

839
00:40:21.521 --> 00:40:25.660
<v Speaker 5>in the antiwar movement and they would </v>
<v Speaker 5>catch them for drugs and arrest them and</v>

840
00:40:25.661 --> 00:40:30.070
<v Speaker 5>they would cripple these movements.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is all like documented,</v>

841
00:40:30.071 --> 00:40:34.450
<v Speaker 5>real clear by the Nixon administration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The reason why they passed that sweeping</v>

842
00:40:34.451 --> 00:40:35.284
<v Speaker 5>psychedelics act of 1970 which covered a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of stuff that's not even </v>

843
00:40:37.931 --> 00:40:38.800
<v Speaker 5>psychoactive.</v>

844
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.000
<v Speaker 5>They didn't even know what they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing.</v>

845
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:43.960
<v Speaker 5>And they miss some of the big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They missed like five methoxy DMT,</v>

846
00:40:43.961 --> 00:40:45.760
<v Speaker 5>which is more than most potent </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychedelic drugs.</v>

847
00:40:45.761 --> 00:40:46.594
<v Speaker 5>Don't demand just a few years ago used </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be able to buy that shit online from </v>

848
00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:52.810
<v Speaker 5>a chemical companies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would give you like a jug of it.</v>

849
00:40:52.811 --> 00:40:53.644
<v Speaker 5>They could get a whole city high for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>month and you could go buy it with a </v>

850
00:40:56.891 --> 00:40:59.440
<v Speaker 5>credit card.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not that I know of anybody who did it.</v>

851
00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:00.603
<v Speaker 5>And I certainly didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I definitely still still don't have </v>

852
00:41:01.931 --> 00:41:03.520
<v Speaker 5>any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if I did,</v>

853
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.650
<v Speaker 5>it's not even illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what's crazy.</v>

854
00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:10.680
<v Speaker 5>It's like they made stuff that was like </v>
<v Speaker 5>a normal part of human use for thousands</v>

855
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.750
<v Speaker 5>and thousands of years that made it </v>
<v Speaker 5>highly illegal.</v>

856
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:14.703
<v Speaker 5>And they did it at a time when they were</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to break down these people that </v>

857
00:41:19.361 --> 00:41:21.430
<v Speaker 5>we're trying to change society.</v>

858
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:24.250
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that was 1970 but along the way,</v>

859
00:41:24.251 --> 00:41:29.251
<v Speaker 5>I think what's really happened is it </v>
<v Speaker 5>became a matter of financial risk.</v>

860
00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:30.603
<v Speaker 5>Like marijuana is a big one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like financial risk of the </v>

861
00:41:33.111 --> 00:41:33.944
<v Speaker 5>pharmaceutical drug companies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they found out that there's so many </v>

862
00:41:36.711 --> 00:41:38.360
<v Speaker 5>different things that marijuana get </v>
<v Speaker 5>help,</v>

863
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:43.630
<v Speaker 5>whether it is a people's appetite or </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain arthritic conditions,</v>

864
00:41:44.871 --> 00:41:47.160
<v Speaker 5>or you can go down the list,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

865
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:48.263
<v Speaker 5>kids with epilepsy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a huge factor on children with </v>

866
00:41:51.441 --> 00:41:53.210
<v Speaker 5>autism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially edible marijuana,</v>

867
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:54.223
<v Speaker 5>all these different things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these different things that it </v>

868
00:41:55.371 --> 00:41:56.204
<v Speaker 5>treats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If that was made legal and people </v>

869
00:41:57.981 --> 00:42:01.610
<v Speaker 5>started turning to that and exercise and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'll a holistic approach,</v>

870
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:02.743
<v Speaker 5>it would cost the pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 5>companies literally billions of dollars </v>

871
00:42:05.631 --> 00:42:08.450
<v Speaker 5>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think that's the big conspiracy.</v>

872
00:42:08.451 --> 00:42:13.160
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not really a paradigm consciousness</v>

873
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.250
<v Speaker 5>sort of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As much as it's a financial thing.</v>

874
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:19.040
<v Speaker 5>I don't think the people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>totally related,</v>

875
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:20.803
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>suppressing it or even aware of the </v>

876
00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:23.670
<v Speaker 5>effects.</v>

877
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:24.371
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

878
00:42:24.371 --> 00:42:27.910
<v Speaker 2>I would just part of the master puppet </v>
<v Speaker 2>string puller.</v>

879
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:29.203
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like this organism that's just </v>

880
00:42:30.761 --> 00:42:33.130
<v Speaker 2>moved only in one direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

881
00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.140
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Money toward,</v>

882
00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:34.993
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The same reason why also involved in </v>

883
00:42:37.001 --> 00:42:37.834
<v Speaker 5>trying to keep these drugs illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have prison guard unions because </v>

884
00:42:41.101 --> 00:42:44.640
<v Speaker 5>they want to keep their money coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you have police unions?</v>

885
00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:45.593
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a lot of that where you </v>
<v Speaker 5>find lobbying by these unlikely groups </v>

886
00:42:48.931 --> 00:42:50.160
<v Speaker 5>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand why,</v>

887
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:51.420
<v Speaker 5>and then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

888
00:42:51.421 --> 00:42:52.750
<v Speaker 5>they just want to make more money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

889
00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.080
<v Speaker 5>Like they're more than willing to lock </v>
<v Speaker 5>people up.</v>

890
00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:56.123
<v Speaker 5>They're more than willing to demonize </v>
<v Speaker 5>helpful things that grow naturally and </v>

891
00:42:59.161 --> 00:43:02.850
<v Speaker 5>have virtually no negative effects in </v>
<v Speaker 5>terms of like your health,</v>

892
00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:04.530
<v Speaker 5>things like marijuana.</v>

893
00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:05.670
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

894
00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.350
<v Speaker 2>that's why I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

895
00:43:07.351 --> 00:43:08.184
<v Speaker 2>when I speak about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I used to be really in like </v>

896
00:43:10.291 --> 00:43:12.360
<v Speaker 2>warrior mode on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

897
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:13.560
<v Speaker 2>topic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

898
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:14.401
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

899
00:43:14.401 --> 00:43:15.890
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by warrior?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought,</v>

900
00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:16.740
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've,</v>

901
00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once I woke up,</v>

902
00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:19.710
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was almost 10 years ago.</v>

903
00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.230
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever use Hashtag woke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you have a right to and no.</v>

904
00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:23.183
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

905
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.820
<v Speaker 5>Should I know it's a joke with the kids </v>
<v Speaker 5>today.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Hashtag woke or Hashtag woke AAF.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm old.</v>

907
00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:32.270
<v Speaker 5>I'm old too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

908
00:43:32.271 --> 00:43:33.660
<v Speaker 5>Half that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Woke as fuck.</v>

909
00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.321
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thanks.</v>

910
00:43:34.321 --> 00:43:38.640
<v Speaker 5>I got that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a quick study.</v>

911
00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:39.713
<v Speaker 5>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you became aware of what I became </v>

912
00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:42.633
<v Speaker 5>aware,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was pissed.</v>

913
00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.580
<v Speaker 5>What was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was it a gradual process?</v>

914
00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:45.443
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

915
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:47.020
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I um,</v>

916
00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:49.960
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got like sick,</v>

917
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:51.070
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

918
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:51.983
<v Speaker 2>wasn't very dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my big sob story is that I was </v>

919
00:43:53.561 --> 00:43:55.420
<v Speaker 2>diagnosed with my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my first health condition,</v>

920
00:43:55.421 --> 00:43:58.300
<v Speaker 2>which is an autoimmune disorder after my</v>
<v Speaker 2>first pregnancy.</v>

921
00:43:58.301 --> 00:43:59.330
<v Speaker 2>Hashimoto's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

922
00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I have the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

923
00:44:00.281 --> 00:44:01.114
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

924
00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

925
00:44:02.381 --> 00:44:05.080
<v Speaker 2>My Dad and my brother do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mom has it also,</v>

926
00:44:05.081 --> 00:44:05.914
<v Speaker 2>I would just like not as common in men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but probably because nobody's looking </v>

927
00:44:08.261 --> 00:44:09.790
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

928
00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:11.163
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was diagnosed with that and I just </v>

929
00:44:12.851 --> 00:44:13.684
<v Speaker 2>had this intuitive sense that I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to go to a conventional doctor </v>

930
00:44:15.791 --> 00:44:19.200
<v Speaker 2>even though I had never ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

931
00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.370
<v Speaker 2>done anything but dismiss alternative </v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine.</v>

932
00:44:21.371 --> 00:44:24.340
<v Speaker 2>Like I was hard core into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical model,</v>

933
00:44:24.341 --> 00:44:27.220
<v Speaker 2>very into science it from that </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

934
00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>

935
00:44:28.511 --> 00:44:29.344
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I knew that all they had to offer </v>

936
00:44:30.761 --> 00:44:31.800
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

937
00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:32.430
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

938
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:34.620
<v Speaker 5>had enough patients that never felt well</v>
<v Speaker 5>on it.</v>

939
00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.030
<v Speaker 5>And so it's weird stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

940
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:37.883
<v Speaker 5>Stuff for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I switched to armour thyroid </v>

941
00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:40.693
<v Speaker 5>and a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's one reason why I got pissed at </v>

942
00:44:41.791 --> 00:44:44.190
<v Speaker 5>doctor drew when doctor drew was giving </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

943
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:45.300
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

944
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:46.253
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he was talking about Hillary </v>

945
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:51.390
<v Speaker 5>Clinton and all of her health issues and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was going over her prescription,</v>

946
00:44:51.391 --> 00:44:52.224
<v Speaker 5>he was mocking the fact that she was on </v>
<v Speaker 5>armour thyroid and he was saying that </v>

947
00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:56.220
<v Speaker 5>that's old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's an old way of treating him.</v>

948
00:44:56.221 --> 00:44:58.080
<v Speaker 5>Like he doesn't know what the fuck he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about.</v>

949
00:44:58.770 --> 00:44:59.603
<v Speaker 5>He's absolutely wrong because I went </v>
<v Speaker 5>through a bunch of different stuff and </v>

950
00:45:01.831 --> 00:45:03.330
<v Speaker 5>then when I took armor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thyroid,</v>

951
00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:05.790
<v Speaker 5>all of the symptoms went away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gone.</v>

952
00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:06.683
<v Speaker 5>And that's what the data shows that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people feel subjectively better on t </v>

953
00:45:08.671 --> 00:45:09.630
<v Speaker 5>three containing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

954
00:45:09.631 --> 00:45:11.730
<v Speaker 5>We'll explain what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It comes from pig thyroid.</v>

955
00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:12.693
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a glandular and he's not wrong </v>

956
00:45:14.941 --> 00:45:17.510
<v Speaker 5>because it is an old fashioned medicine </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong there.</v>

957
00:45:17.511 --> 00:45:18.344
<v Speaker 5>It's ineffective though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was talking about how outdated it is </v>

958
00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:23.190
<v Speaker 5>and that subject at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People feel better on it.</v>

959
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:25.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I took that for something similar,</v>

960
00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:28.920
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>called nature throid for a while.</v>

961
00:45:28.921 --> 00:45:33.210
<v Speaker 5>But I went to a naturopath because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is so funny that I did that,</v>

962
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at that time it sounds like a hippie.</v>

963
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:38.760
<v Speaker 5>Did you go to a place with like macrame </v>
<v Speaker 5>and stuff?</v>

964
00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.180
<v Speaker 5>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really good friends.</v>

965
00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.660
<v Speaker 5>Do you have any friends?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very friendly.</v>

966
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.550
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's friendly.</v>

967
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:44.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did she smell like,</v>

968
00:45:44.411 --> 00:45:45.990
<v Speaker 5>but truly or incense?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

969
00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:46.590
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she did.</v>

970
00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:48.390
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was good.</v>

971
00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:49.980
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's it felt right.</v>

972
00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:51.990
<v Speaker 5>Even that really struggling wrong at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>moment.</v>

973
00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:54.080
<v Speaker 3>No I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

974
00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:55.023
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put it into remission in the space of </v>

975
00:45:57.341 --> 00:46:00.550
<v Speaker 3>like a year in my antibodies were like </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the high two thousands,</v>

976
00:46:00.551 --> 00:46:04.750
<v Speaker 3>my Tsh was like 20 and I had to do to </v>
<v Speaker 3>put it in remission.</v>

977
00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:07.030
<v Speaker 3>So the same things I do with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>patients.</v>

978
00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:08.103
<v Speaker 3>So I initially just changed my diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So initially I just very simply at her </v>

979
00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.790
<v Speaker 3>recommendation and I'm Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up Italian,</v>

980
00:46:15.791 --> 00:46:20.791
<v Speaker 3>my mom's from Italy and I ate cheese and</v>
<v Speaker 3>bread of some variety,</v>

981
00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:25.600
<v Speaker 3>like five times a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally for my whole life.</v>

982
00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:26.710
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the two things,</v>

983
00:46:26.711 --> 00:46:28.720
<v Speaker 3>of course she asked me to take out where</v>
<v Speaker 3>gluten and dairy,</v>

984
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:30.200
<v Speaker 3>dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So has it been,</v>

985
00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:33.580
<v Speaker 3>it was a very amazing transition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

986
00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:34.900
<v Speaker 3>my early,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when was that?</v>

987
00:46:34.901 --> 00:46:38.320
<v Speaker 3>I started like pooping every day and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hadn't ever done that in my whole life.</v>

988
00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:40.060
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

989
00:46:40.061 --> 00:46:42.880
<v Speaker 3>These things that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I was like,</v>

990
00:46:42.881 --> 00:46:44.110
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she must be on to something.</v>

991
00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.980
<v Speaker 3>And then later I layered in other</v>

992
00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:47.800
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

993
00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.780
<v Speaker 5>Well you eating a lot of vegetables at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the time.</v>

994
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:52.103
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was more about what I took </v>

995
00:46:53.731 --> 00:46:56.850
<v Speaker 3>out then at that point then like what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>put in.</v>

996
00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:01.230
<v Speaker 3>But when I saw the change on paper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

997
00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.120
<v Speaker 3>this is not even supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

998
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.193
<v Speaker 3>This is literally not even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not even taught that this is </v>

999
00:47:06.151 --> 00:47:07.800
<v Speaker 3>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let alone that it has anything.</v>

1000
00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:08.963
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're putting autoimmune conditions </v>

1001
00:47:09.661 --> 00:47:11.700
<v Speaker 3>into remission,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has anything to do with diet.</v>

1002
00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:12.723
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I was really indignant and I've </v>

1003
00:47:14.781 --> 00:47:18.020
<v Speaker 3>always been a science nut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always spent Saturday,</v>

1004
00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:20.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a good four hours every Saturday on</v>

1005
00:47:20.061 --> 00:47:22.130
<v Speaker 3>pub med.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course I'm looking at different stuff</v>

1006
00:47:22.131 --> 00:47:24.620
<v Speaker 3>over time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I went to pub med and I was like,</v>

1007
00:47:24.621 --> 00:47:25.454
<v Speaker 3>what else did I learn?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like on an obsessive rampage </v>

1008
00:47:28.251 --> 00:47:29.084
<v Speaker 3>for like a good couple of years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when I just turned over every </v>

1009
00:47:33.041 --> 00:47:34.150
<v Speaker 3>stone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everything,</v>

1010
00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:35.013
<v Speaker 3>every sacred cow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether all these meds we were talking </v>

1011
00:47:38.051 --> 00:47:38.884
<v Speaker 3>about like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>statens or acid blockers are </v>

1012
00:47:41.141 --> 00:47:42.130
<v Speaker 3>antibiotics.</v>

1013
00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:43.173
<v Speaker 3>I then I got onto psych meds and then I </v>
<v Speaker 3>started to look at the science </v>

1014
00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:50.440
<v Speaker 3>supporting a very different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective on,</v>

1015
00:47:50.441 --> 00:47:51.274
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this interconnected model and the gut </v>

1016
00:47:52.211 --> 00:47:53.044
<v Speaker 3>microbiome and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of the impact of belief on our </v>

1017
00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:58.053
<v Speaker 3>biology that we can sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>reprogram our hardware with our </v>

1018
00:48:01.691 --> 00:48:02.524
<v Speaker 3>software,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like we're the only species </v>

1019
00:48:03.851 --> 00:48:05.800
<v Speaker 3>that can really do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1020
00:48:05.801 --> 00:48:08.440
<v Speaker 3>that we can literally change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1021
00:48:08.441 --> 00:48:10.000
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1022
00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:14.890
<v Speaker 3>but also interacts with your body and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you change your body.</v>

1023
00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:18.670
<v Speaker 3>You literally change your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what did you do to do that?</v>

1024
00:48:18.671 --> 00:48:22.990
<v Speaker 3>Like what methods?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was very reluctant to meditate.</v>

1025
00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:25.930
<v Speaker 3>I was an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my whole like a belligerent,</v>

1026
00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of like Dawkins level,</v>

1027
00:48:28.481 --> 00:48:29.920
<v Speaker 3>atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1028
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:33.070
<v Speaker 3>my whole life because I was a science </v>
<v Speaker 3>worshiper and I was like,</v>

1029
00:48:33.071 --> 00:48:34.030
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1030
00:48:34.031 --> 00:48:34.864
<v Speaker 3>spirituality and religion is for weak </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who like need to believe in some </v>

1031
00:48:38.621 --> 00:48:40.910
<v Speaker 3>fairytale to make them feel better about</v>

1032
00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:44.430
<v Speaker 5>typical New Yorker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>New York liberal coming at Ya,</v>

1033
00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.980
<v Speaker 5>New York liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scientists.</v>

1034
00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:48.430
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1035
00:48:48.431 --> 00:48:49.450
<v Speaker 3>it's scientism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1036
00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:52.510
<v Speaker 3>It literally is the Church of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of science.</v>

1037
00:48:52.511 --> 00:48:54.040
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1038
00:48:54.041 --> 00:48:56.320
<v Speaker 3>when I had this crisis of faith,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

1039
00:48:56.321 --> 00:49:01.150
<v Speaker 3>like I was lost for a long time because </v>
<v Speaker 3>science had sort of,</v>

1040
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:03.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or what I believed has sort of failed me</v>

1041
00:49:03.641 --> 00:49:08.641
<v Speaker 3>in some ways and then I didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the readiness to start</v>

1042
00:49:09.731 --> 00:49:10.564
<v Speaker 3>meditating or find out what you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were talking about when it comes </v>

1043
00:49:13.581 --> 00:49:16.120
<v Speaker 3>to spirituality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although I followed the literature,</v>

1044
00:49:16.121 --> 00:49:19.780
<v Speaker 3>so like I read the literature on </v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation and epigenetic expression for</v>

1045
00:49:19.781 --> 00:49:22.360
<v Speaker 3>years and years and years and I used to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell my patients to do it,</v>

1046
00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:28.320
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't do it and hold you back </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I liked feeling stressed out.</v>

1047
00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:32.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you don't do something,</v>

1048
00:49:32.051 --> 00:49:34.420
<v Speaker 3>you're not doing it because you like </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually being sick.</v>

1049
00:49:34.421 --> 00:49:37.180
<v Speaker 3>You like how you're feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're invested in it.</v>

1050
00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:40.210
<v Speaker 5>Is it that you like or that your </v>
<v Speaker 5>addictive familiar in that?</v>

1051
00:49:40.211 --> 00:49:41.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's comfortable</v>

1052
00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:42.753
<v Speaker 3>and the unknown for some of my patients,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the meditation piece is the last part </v>

1053
00:49:46.211 --> 00:49:47.044
<v Speaker 3>because they know it's going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>game changer and they're not ready for </v>

1054
00:49:48.971 --> 00:49:50.950
<v Speaker 3>everything to just be totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>reconfigured.</v>

1055
00:49:50.951 --> 00:49:52.830
<v Speaker 3>They're not ready for that level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation.</v>

1056
00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:54.013
<v Speaker 5>What they say too about sometimes people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are addicted to cigarettes that </v>

1057
00:49:56.981 --> 00:50:00.250
<v Speaker 5>you're almost addicted to the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're doing something bad or yourself.</v>

1058
00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:02.800
<v Speaker 5>You're addicted to that rush of being </v>
<v Speaker 5>naughty.</v>

1059
00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:04.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1060
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:06.260
<v Speaker 5>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1061
00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:07.790
<v Speaker 5>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It confirms,</v>

1062
00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:11.200
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some like self loathing hook too because</v>

1063
00:50:11.201 --> 00:50:11.861
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck it.</v>

1064
00:50:11.861 --> 00:50:13.240
<v Speaker 5>I'm alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who gives a shit?</v>

1065
00:50:13.241 --> 00:50:15.130
<v Speaker 5>This is all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not the future.</v>

1066
00:50:15.131 --> 00:50:17.740
<v Speaker 5>Fuck the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trialists settle now.</v>

1067
00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:19.203
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like so many fucking smart people smoke </v>

1068
00:50:20.381 --> 00:50:25.360
<v Speaker 5>cigarettes and it's so confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're making a deal to slowly</v>

1069
00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.070
<v Speaker 5>pay to poison.</v>

1070
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.010
<v Speaker 2>You'll like throwing a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money in the pot every month.</v>

1071
00:50:31.011 --> 00:50:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Guarantee you guaranteeing that 20 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>down a line,</v>

1072
00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:36.170
<v Speaker 2>30 years down the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however long it takes,</v>

1073
00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:37.123
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some bolt is going to come off the </v>

1074
00:50:38.931 --> 00:50:41.420
<v Speaker 2>machinery and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Mike,</v>

1075
00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.940
<v Speaker 2>you got a tumor in your lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>

1076
00:50:43.941 --> 00:50:45.800
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have to cut one of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things out of your chest.</v>

1077
00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:49.730
<v Speaker 2>You can get by on one lung buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what we got to do though.</v>

1078
00:50:49.731 --> 00:50:51.130
<v Speaker 2>We got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to start eating papayas.</v>

1079
00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:54.170
<v Speaker 2>Like what sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why am I even alive?</v>

1080
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all do stuff like that.</v>

1081
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:58.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not always trained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we recognize,</v>

1082
00:50:58.611 --> 00:50:59.031
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1083
00:50:59.031 --> 00:51:01.550
<v Speaker 2>we do because we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1084
00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:06.350
<v Speaker 2>we're invested in reflecting a felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrongness,</v>

1085
00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:08.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would call it felt wrong.</v>

1086
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Like we feel deep inside something is </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

1087
00:51:11.211 --> 00:51:12.710
<v Speaker 2>wrong with us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong with society,</v>

1088
00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:13.220
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1089
00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Something's missing and then we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to pretend that everything is okay.</v>

1090
00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:19.280
<v Speaker 2>So we self medicate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1091
00:51:19.281 --> 00:51:22.670
<v Speaker 2>right there with you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs or cigarettes or you know,</v>

1092
00:51:22.671 --> 00:51:23.504
<v Speaker 2>workaholism or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex addiction or we're all sort of in </v>

1093
00:51:27.081 --> 00:51:29.120
<v Speaker 2>this place not wanting to acknowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a reason,</v>

1094
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:31.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of my favorite quotes is this,</v>

1095
00:51:31.491 --> 00:51:32.324
<v Speaker 2>like Christian Murti quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's no measure of health to be </v>

1096
00:51:35.121 --> 00:51:37.880
<v Speaker 2>well adapted to a profoundly sick </v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

1097
00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:39.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1098
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:41.390
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really low.</v>

1099
00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:43.220
<v Speaker 2>I love New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the best.</v>

1100
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:45.830
<v Speaker 2>I love the traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like.</v>

1101
00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:46.641
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1102
00:51:46.641 --> 00:51:47.930
<v Speaker 2>you're a sick person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1103
00:51:47.931 --> 00:51:50.510
<v Speaker 2>Nigga is wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally love it.</v>

1104
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:52.760
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong some home.</v>

1105
00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:54.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a weird,</v>

1106
00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.253
<v Speaker 4>one of my very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very best friends is just addicted to </v>

1107
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:59.570
<v Speaker 4>York.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1108
00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:01.510
<v Speaker 4>And it's like loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's been there forever.</v>

1109
00:52:01.511 --> 00:52:03.460
<v Speaker 4>He's like an abusive relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Loves the city.</v>

1110
00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:05.390
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he loves the energy.</v>

1111
00:52:05.391 --> 00:52:09.040
<v Speaker 4>He likes to all the cars and traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1112
00:52:09.041 --> 00:52:10.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is,</v>

1113
00:52:10.121 --> 00:52:10.954
<v Speaker 4>but he's healthy like fairly like </v>
<v Speaker 4>physically he's got a few issues but </v>

1114
00:52:14.501 --> 00:52:15.334
<v Speaker 4>like mentally</v>

1115
00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.210
<v Speaker 2>very healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's unusual.</v>

1116
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:20.640
<v Speaker 2>Look like just one thing sorted out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a smart guy.</v>

1117
00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:21.693
<v Speaker 2>It's problematic.</v>

1118
00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:24.270
<v Speaker 4>He just loves the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is.</v>

1119
00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:26.610
<v Speaker 4>Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know</v>

1120
00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.620
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you've,</v>

1121
00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:32.310
<v Speaker 2>if you think about what the messaging is</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the top down we were talking about,</v>

1122
00:52:32.311 --> 00:52:36.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the messaging is keep it together.</v>

1123
00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Punch the clock on Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

1124
00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:45.300
<v Speaker 2>sorted out right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're supposed to be like fine,</v>

1125
00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.070
<v Speaker 2>be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1126
00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:51.580
<v Speaker 2>But many of us don't feel fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No like range,</v>

1127
00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:54.930
<v Speaker 2>a huge range of not fineness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying when I say like a</v>

1128
00:52:54.931 --> 00:52:58.350
<v Speaker 2>felt wrongness and that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy,</v>

1129
00:52:58.560 --> 00:52:59.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sense that.</v>

1130
00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:03.550
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of artists I would say are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>canaries in the coal mine,</v>

1131
00:53:03.551 --> 00:53:05.580
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're the ones who feel,</v>

1132
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:06.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1133
00:53:06.851 --> 00:53:08.280
<v Speaker 2>the collective wound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1134
00:53:08.281 --> 00:53:11.160
<v Speaker 2>if you want to call it that more than we</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

1135
00:53:11.161 --> 00:53:12.750
<v Speaker 2>they're sensitive in ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1136
00:53:12.751 --> 00:53:16.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to put you in my category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more of an artist than I am.</v>

1137
00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:17.393
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I sort of look at yourself as an </v>

1138
00:53:19.501 --> 00:53:19.980
<v Speaker 2>artist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1139
00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:20.813
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely not.</v>

1140
00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:22.133
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting actually because most </v>

1141
00:53:23.281 --> 00:53:27.330
<v Speaker 2>of my patients are real or they become </v>
<v Speaker 2>after I get them off meds.</v>

1142
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:28.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1143
00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:29.400
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1144
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.233
<v Speaker 2>So they weren't artists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get them off meds and all of a </v>

1145
00:53:31.921 --> 00:53:32.754
<v Speaker 2>sudden they start like composing music </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something or making paintings are </v>

1146
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:39.180
<v Speaker 2>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say find some repressed expression,</v>

1147
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:40.770
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1148
00:53:40.771 --> 00:53:42.600
<v Speaker 2>But if you also look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1149
00:53:42.601 --> 00:53:43.434
<v Speaker 2>like I just wrote an article recently </v>
<v Speaker 2>that tied in Chris Cornell and his </v>

1150
00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:50.430
<v Speaker 2>hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1151
00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:51.900
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bothered me.</v>

1152
00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:53.940
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

1153
00:53:53.941 --> 00:53:55.500
<v Speaker 2>it's not an isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1154
00:53:55.501 --> 00:53:56.880
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the details.</v>

1155
00:53:56.881 --> 00:53:59.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I said she likes the smell a rat.</v>

1156
00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:00.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just say what his wife believes </v>

1157
00:54:01.341 --> 00:54:02.280
<v Speaker 2>that they sent his wife.</v>

1158
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:07.460
<v Speaker 2>He took too many antidepressants or anti</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety medications,</v>

1159
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:13.040
<v Speaker 2>but wasn't there like some rumor about </v>
<v Speaker 2>him having a relapse?</v>

1160
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:17.940
<v Speaker 2>Was there a rumor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rumor that there was like track marks,</v>

1161
00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:19.290
<v Speaker 2>fresh track marks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>CV,</v>

1162
00:54:19.291 --> 00:54:20.124
<v Speaker 2>find anything on that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the hell would anybody know that </v>

1163
00:54:21.541 --> 00:54:22.374
<v Speaker 2>that seems like some shit that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>just start making up the annual listen </v>

1164
00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:26.370
<v Speaker 2>and I could be accused of doing the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

1165
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.233
<v Speaker 2>even commenting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his wife who is married to him was </v>

1166
00:54:30.031 --> 00:54:32.790
<v Speaker 2>the one that said that she believed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when she talked to him on the phone</v>

1167
00:54:32.791 --> 00:54:36.510
<v Speaker 2>that he had taken too much of his anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety medication and it'd be one thing</v>

1168
00:54:36.511 --> 00:54:37.231
<v Speaker 2>to just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1169
00:54:37.231 --> 00:54:38.064
<v Speaker 2>she's like a grieving widow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there wasn't like a very indicting </v>

1170
00:54:41.191 --> 00:54:42.024
<v Speaker 2>body of evidence that unequivocally like</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally two new studies just came out </v>

1171
00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:50.480
<v Speaker 2>this week that unequivocally implicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>benzodiazepines in homicide and suicide.</v>

1172
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:53.333
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you are the very important finish </v>

1173
00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:55.824
<v Speaker 2>study demonstrated that benzodiazepines </v>
<v Speaker 2>are led to like a 223% increase risk of </v>

1174
00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.040
<v Speaker 2>committing homicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

1175
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:05.740
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1176
00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:06.623
<v Speaker 2>along with the antidepressants and </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually other psychotropics including </v>

1177
00:55:08.911 --> 00:55:10.740
<v Speaker 2>stimulants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1178
00:55:10.741 --> 00:55:11.574
<v Speaker 2>all of these medications have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>linked to an increase in suicide as </v>

1179
00:55:14.101 --> 00:55:14.934
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I hear about a school shooting </v>

1180
00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:19.620
<v Speaker 2>or I hear about the German wings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1181
00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:22.370
<v Speaker 2>plane crash wings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Guy Lubick like who,</v>

1182
00:55:22.371 --> 00:55:24.660
<v Speaker 2>who took down the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the German wings plane,</v>

1183
00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:28.410
<v Speaker 2>he suicided with a whole plane of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and crashed the plane.</v>

1184
00:55:28.411 --> 00:55:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Like when I hear about these mass </v>
<v Speaker 2>murder,</v>

1185
00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.240
<v Speaker 2>like menace to society kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations,</v>

1186
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:39.300
<v Speaker 2>my first thought is what psych meds were</v>
<v Speaker 2>they on?</v>

1187
00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:40.463
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my training basically conditioned me to </v>

1188
00:55:44.011 --> 00:55:45.750
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well they're mentally ill.</v>

1189
00:55:45.751 --> 00:55:46.584
<v Speaker 2>So obviously they're taking psych meds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like saying umbrellas cause the </v>

1190
00:55:49.831 --> 00:55:50.664
<v Speaker 2>rain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1191
00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:53.640
<v Speaker 2>That's not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Causation.</v>

1192
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:54.930
<v Speaker 2>Correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1193
00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:56.183
<v Speaker 2>But actually there's a massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>suppressed body of literature that </v>

1194
00:56:00.391 --> 00:56:02.820
<v Speaker 2>implicates these medications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of them.</v>

1195
00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:05.610
<v Speaker 2>And we know why we think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1196
00:56:05.611 --> 00:56:06.444
<v Speaker 2>So we think that it has to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way you metabolize some people </v>

1197
00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.750
<v Speaker 2>metabolize these medications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

1198
00:56:12.790 --> 00:56:15.510
<v Speaker 2>you might be born with a genetic variant</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your liver,</v>

1199
00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:16.553
<v Speaker 2>then makes it so that you buy design,</v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolize medications differently than </v>

1200
00:56:21.301 --> 00:56:22.200
<v Speaker 2>someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1201
00:56:22.201 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 2>So you can enter into a state of</v>

1202
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:28.510
<v Speaker 3>what's called auto intoxication more </v>
<v Speaker 3>easily than someone else,</v>

1203
00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:29.373
<v Speaker 3>even sometimes in a couple of doses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you develop what's called Aca </v>

1204
00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:36.070
<v Speaker 3>Athenia induced impulsivity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>impulsivity,</v>

1205
00:56:36.071 --> 00:56:36.904
<v Speaker 3>which is like ack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Athena is like this feeling like you </v>

1206
00:56:38.471 --> 00:56:42.220
<v Speaker 3>just want to crawl under your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you seem really chill.</v>

1207
00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:45.370
<v Speaker 3>It's really creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like horror movie level.</v>

1208
00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:50.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fucking boil over.</v>

1209
00:56:50.381 --> 00:56:52.720
<v Speaker 3>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a,</v>

1210
00:56:52.721 --> 00:56:53.554
<v Speaker 3>I spoke in July in London.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did this like workshop and this guy </v>

1211
00:56:57.281 --> 00:57:00.100
<v Speaker 3>contacted me named David Carmichael and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

1212
00:57:00.101 --> 00:57:04.150
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to meet you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>followed your work and I want us to tell</v>

1213
00:57:04.151 --> 00:57:06.010
<v Speaker 3>you about my story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1214
00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:10.330
<v Speaker 3>I had known about this paper of which he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was one of 11,</v>

1215
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:12.280
<v Speaker 3>10 or 11 subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1216
00:57:12.281 --> 00:57:13.114
<v Speaker 3>by these authors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lucier and karate was from 2011 older </v>

1217
00:57:15.611 --> 00:57:20.170
<v Speaker 3>paper where they took all these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who had committed like heinous acts,</v>

1218
00:57:20.171 --> 00:57:21.004
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1219
00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:22.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>murdered their therapists,</v>

1220
00:57:22.631 --> 00:57:23.464
<v Speaker 3>are killed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their child or themselves jumped in </v>

1221
00:57:25.451 --> 00:57:26.800
<v Speaker 3>front of a train or whatever.</v>

1222
00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:32.250
<v Speaker 3>And they were prescribed antidepressants</v>
<v Speaker 3>for totally run of the mill stress.</v>

1223
00:57:32.261 --> 00:57:35.500
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like work stress or a dog dying,</v>

1224
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:39.760
<v Speaker 3>not because they had like severe mental </v>
<v Speaker 3>illness and we're suicidal,</v>

1225
00:57:39.761 --> 00:57:41.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people were not suicidal.</v>

1226
00:57:41.591 --> 00:57:42.424
<v Speaker 3>They were not homicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were normal citizens and they went </v>

1227
00:57:45.401 --> 00:57:46.234
<v Speaker 3>on to do this crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what they found was when they </v>

1228
00:57:49.121 --> 00:57:51.490
<v Speaker 3>analyze each of these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1229
00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:52.660
<v Speaker 3>victims,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perpetrators,</v>

1230
00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:54.230
<v Speaker 3>everyone to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1231
00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:55.113
<v Speaker 3>they found,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all had these liver variants that </v>

1232
00:57:56.651 --> 00:58:01.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about so that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically poisoned by medication,</v>

1233
00:58:01.181 --> 00:58:02.014
<v Speaker 3>but before they were poisoned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were put into this altered state </v>

1234
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:08.350
<v Speaker 3>where they did impulsive leave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>violent things.</v>

1235
00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:09.184
<v Speaker 3>So this guy basically gets on the stage </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I was speaking and he talks about </v>

1236
00:58:13.361 --> 00:58:16.490
<v Speaker 3>how he was prescribed Paxil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1237
00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:19.000
<v Speaker 3>because he works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think as an accountant.</v>

1238
00:58:19.050 --> 00:58:19.883
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was prescribed it for work </v>

1239
00:58:20.981 --> 00:58:21.700
<v Speaker 3>related stress.</v>

1240
00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:24.010
<v Speaker 3>Like it was just like taking on too much</v>
<v Speaker 3>stress at work.</v>

1241
00:58:24.011 --> 00:58:24.844
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he remembers feeling like his mind </v>

1242
00:58:31.031 --> 00:58:32.920
<v Speaker 3>like slip away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he began,</v>

1243
00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:36.340
<v Speaker 3>you entered this realm of like psychosis</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially.</v>

1244
00:58:36.341 --> 00:58:37.720
<v Speaker 3>And he started to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1245
00:58:37.721 --> 00:58:39.400
<v Speaker 3>to develop all of these paranoid </v>
<v Speaker 3>beliefs.</v>

1246
00:58:39.401 --> 00:58:41.590
<v Speaker 3>But he looked and people told him like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1247
00:58:41.591 --> 00:58:43.840
<v Speaker 3>you're getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so glad you're feeling better.</v>

1248
00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:48.040
<v Speaker 3>Long Story Short,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he strangled his 11 year old son dead.</v>

1249
00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:52.540
<v Speaker 3>And that's before or after you met him </v>
<v Speaker 3>after,</v>

1250
00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:57.250
<v Speaker 3>this was actually years ago and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>not jailed at him and he was telling you</v>

1251
00:58:57.251 --> 00:58:59.620
<v Speaker 3>about all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then after that he killed his kid.</v>

1252
00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:00.483
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he killed his son before we met years </v>

1253
00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:04.000
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he wanted,</v>

1254
00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:05.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to share,</v>

1255
00:59:05.610 --> 00:59:06.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>

1256
00:59:06.441 --> 00:59:08.950
<v Speaker 3>the audience of doctors I was speaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>to like,</v>

1257
00:59:08.951 --> 00:59:11.810
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Russian based on this medicated,</v>

1258
00:59:11.830 --> 00:59:12.663
<v Speaker 3>which is rare actually believe it or not</v>
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of times these people are </v>

1259
00:59:15.011 --> 00:59:15.490
<v Speaker 3>jailed.</v>

1260
00:59:15.490 --> 00:59:17.230
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1261
00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:20.320
<v Speaker 3>punishing the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>punishing the victim so to speak.</v>

1262
00:59:20.321 --> 00:59:25.190
<v Speaker 3>But that's sort of the issue that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>an important issue.</v>

1263
00:59:25.191 --> 00:59:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause your friend.</v>

1264
00:59:26.391 --> 00:59:27.230
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1265
00:59:27.231 --> 00:59:30.260
<v Speaker 3>So let's say some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is in line with their consciousness</v>

1266
00:59:30.261 --> 00:59:31.094
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to not have any curiosity about why </v>

1267
00:59:34.041 --> 00:59:34.874
<v Speaker 3>they're having symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not want to see what they can do in </v>

1268
00:59:37.041 --> 00:59:39.890
<v Speaker 3>terms of optimizing their lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like not their deal.</v>

1269
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:40.610
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1270
00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:43.670
<v Speaker 3>So they want to take a medication and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to suppress their symptoms and</v>

1271
00:59:43.671 --> 00:59:44.990
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hope it works out.</v>

1272
00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.450
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what people do.</v>

1273
00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:49.100
<v Speaker 3>This should be a free country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1274
00:59:49.101 --> 00:59:52.040
<v Speaker 3>You do what you want to do and practice </v>
<v Speaker 3>the medicine that makes sense to you.</v>

1275
00:59:52.790 --> 00:59:56.300
<v Speaker 3>But the sort of like chink in the armor </v>
<v Speaker 3>is perhaps this issue,</v>

1276
00:59:56.510 --> 01:00:00.200
<v Speaker 3>which is that we don't really have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good way of identifying,</v>

1277
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:02.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Russian roulette.</v>

1278
01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:06.250
<v Speaker 3>We don't have a good way of identifying </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to be David Carmichael,</v>

1279
01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:07.700
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1280
01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:09.470
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1281
01:00:09.471 --> 01:00:12.140
<v Speaker 3>it's one thing to kill yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>impulsively,</v>

1282
01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:13.370
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1283
01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.320
<v Speaker 3>those school shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1284
01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:19.580
<v Speaker 3>have without an exception,</v>
<v Speaker 3>been committed by,</v>

1285
01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.553
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are kids who are recently </v>

1286
01:00:23.541 --> 01:00:25.100
<v Speaker 3>medicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1287
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:28.140
<v Speaker 5>just as a public health issue or coming </v>
<v Speaker 5>off psych meds.</v>

1288
01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.390
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The changes.</v>

1289
01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:31.663
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If not 100% is really crazy that that's </v>

1290
01:00:33.891 --> 01:00:35.120
<v Speaker 5>tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when you bring that up,</v>

1291
01:00:35.121 --> 01:00:37.850
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people call you a gun rights apologist.</v>

1292
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:40.190
<v Speaker 5>Well you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're distorting the issue,</v>

1293
01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:43.430
<v Speaker 5>you're turning it to a psych meds issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When it's a gun issue.</v>

1294
01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:46.520
<v Speaker 5>If these people don't have guns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can't commit these crimes.</v>

1295
01:00:46.521 --> 01:00:51.340
<v Speaker 5>Like that to me is a very bizarre way of</v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at like the one science,</v>

1296
01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:53.280
<v Speaker 5>which is why would they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

1297
01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:57.140
<v Speaker 5>it's what you were talking about before </v>
<v Speaker 5>where psychiatrists aren't talking about</v>

1298
01:00:57.141 --> 01:00:58.130
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

1299
01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:03.220
<v Speaker 5>this is such a taboo subject that by the</v>
<v Speaker 5>time it gets to the average educated and</v>

1300
01:01:05.001 --> 01:01:09.110
<v Speaker 5>informed person who for the most part it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was probably liberal and you know,</v>

1301
01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:10.003
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1302
01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:11.143
<v Speaker 5>cause we're talking about people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to get rid of guns with what </v>

1303
01:01:13.581 --> 01:01:14.414
<v Speaker 5>they're seeing is only the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not seeing the mindset behind </v>

1304
01:01:17.511 --> 01:01:20.390
<v Speaker 5>the ability to do something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is relevant context.</v>

1305
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:21.463
<v Speaker 5>This liver issue that you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about is this testable and nobody tests </v>

1306
01:01:26.931 --> 01:01:27.710
<v Speaker 5>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Jesus.</v>

1307
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:30.190
<v Speaker 5>Clearly apart from functional medicine </v>
<v Speaker 5>doctors</v>

1308
01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.730
<v Speaker 3>perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part,</v>

1309
01:01:31.731 --> 01:01:34.580
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to be the one starting</v>
<v Speaker 3>patients on psychiatric meds.</v>

1310
01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.910
<v Speaker 3>Most psych meds are started by primary </v>
<v Speaker 3>care doctors after 10 minutes.</v>

1311
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:38.803
<v Speaker 5>And there's a scientific consensus that </v>
<v Speaker 5>this issue exists that this with this </v>

1312
01:01:41.721 --> 01:01:44.150
<v Speaker 5>liver issue that if you take these </v>
<v Speaker 5>medications,</v>

1313
01:01:44.151 --> 01:01:48.740
<v Speaker 5>it can turn turn you into this or take </v>
<v Speaker 5>you to the psychotic state.</v>

1314
01:01:48.741 --> 01:01:49.700
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

1315
01:01:49.701 --> 01:01:50.534
<v Speaker 5>And you would be surprised how much </v>
<v Speaker 5>scientific acknowledgement there is of </v>

1316
01:01:53.121 --> 01:01:53.871
<v Speaker 5>such quality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

1317
01:01:53.871 --> 01:01:54.704
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or</v>

1318
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:57.470
<v Speaker 3>it's called Eq Athenia induced </v>
<v Speaker 3>impulsivity.</v>

1319
01:01:57.471 --> 01:01:59.060
<v Speaker 3>Achalasia is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1320
01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:00.013
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the symptom neurologic symptom that's </v>

1321
01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:02.443
<v Speaker 3>induced by the impaired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's thought to be impaired metabolism </v>

1322
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:09.350
<v Speaker 3>on the liver level of these medications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1323
01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:12.350
<v Speaker 3>so this is not like a theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a theory.</v>

1324
01:02:12.351 --> 01:02:13.290
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1325
01:02:13.850 --> 01:02:16.160
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>

1326
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:18.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1327
01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:20.520
<v Speaker 3>in the literature there's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>called antidepressant,</v>

1328
01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:22.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tacky phylaxis,</v>

1329
01:02:22.021 --> 01:02:22.854
<v Speaker 3>which is the acknowledgement in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific literature that like a good </v>

1330
01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:30.390
<v Speaker 3>30% of the time they just stopped having</v>
<v Speaker 3>an effect.</v>

1331
01:02:30.391 --> 01:02:31.510
<v Speaker 3>Like stop working.</v>

1332
01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing that people that I know</v>

1333
01:02:33.561 --> 01:02:35.720
<v Speaker 4>that have taken the most sad that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>doctor will tell you,</v>

1334
01:02:35.721 --> 01:02:37.670
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is going to work for a little while</v>

1335
01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.190
<v Speaker 4>and then it's not going to work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just hope you don't like.</v>

1336
01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:45.950
<v Speaker 4>Well my friend who got on them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and actually I have two friends that got</v>

1337
01:02:45.951 --> 01:02:46.784
<v Speaker 4>a great benefit from getting on ssrs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had a great benefit and they both </v>

1338
01:02:50.601 --> 01:02:52.340
<v Speaker 4>eventually got off of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

1339
01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:55.170
<v Speaker 4>They got on them and then their life </v>
<v Speaker 4>improved.</v>

1340
01:02:55.180 --> 01:03:00.180
<v Speaker 4>They improve the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the just the overall existence that they</v>

1341
01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:02.810
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they improve their job,</v>

1342
01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:04.750
<v Speaker 4>they improve their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just their state,</v>

1343
01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.950
<v Speaker 4>their status in life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship stuff.</v>

1344
01:03:06.951 --> 01:03:10.520
<v Speaker 4>All these different things improved and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then they slowly wean themselves off and</v>

1345
01:03:10.521 --> 01:03:13.700
<v Speaker 4>now they don't need them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But both of my friends that were on them</v>

1346
01:03:13.701 --> 01:03:16.850
<v Speaker 4>say that it was a great benefit of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get on them.</v>

1347
01:03:18.110 --> 01:03:21.620
<v Speaker 3>So that's a rare story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say it's a pretty rare story.</v>

1348
01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:22.483
<v Speaker 3>Now you could argue that I have a skewed</v>
<v Speaker 3>exposure to the population because I </v>

1349
01:03:25.071 --> 01:03:25.904
<v Speaker 3>only see the people who've been on 10 20</v>
<v Speaker 3>years and want to desperately get off </v>

1350
01:03:28.751 --> 01:03:29.780
<v Speaker 3>and can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1351
01:03:30.050 --> 01:03:34.130
<v Speaker 3>but I am again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this public health issue aside,</v>

1352
01:03:34.131 --> 01:03:35.090
<v Speaker 3>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1353
01:03:35.091 --> 01:03:35.924
<v Speaker 3>these medications could be inducing </v>
<v Speaker 3>impulsive violence at random and like </v>

1354
01:03:39.981 --> 01:03:42.770
<v Speaker 3>perhaps we should at least be talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this as a society,</v>

1355
01:03:42.850 --> 01:03:43.683
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1356
01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:46.310
<v Speaker 3>That issue aside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1357
01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:48.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a crusader for informed consent.</v>

1358
01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:49.993
<v Speaker 3>I believe that you just should know all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the options and all of the available </v>

1359
01:03:54.231 --> 01:03:56.510
<v Speaker 3>science and then you make your own damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision,</v>

1360
01:03:56.511 --> 01:03:58.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>With your free will.</v>

1361
01:03:58.191 --> 01:03:59.024
<v Speaker 3>You do what's right for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what matches your level of </v>

1362
01:04:00.801 --> 01:04:01.850
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1363
01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:07.240
<v Speaker 3>Because the problem is that most people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are not taken off of meds.</v>

1364
01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they are maintained for longterm,</v>

1365
01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:16.780
<v Speaker 3>even though all of the longterm science </v>
<v Speaker 3>suggest that people do worse longterm on</v>

1366
01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:21.230
<v Speaker 3>all categories of psychiatric beds than </v>
<v Speaker 3>if they were never medicated.</v>

1367
01:04:21.231 --> 01:04:23.990
<v Speaker 3>And this includes this anti psychotics </v>
<v Speaker 3>for schizophrenia,</v>

1368
01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:25.430
<v Speaker 3>all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of them.</v>

1369
01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:27.620
<v Speaker 3>And the person who exposed this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

1370
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:29.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of blew the whistle on this issue.</v>

1371
01:04:29.810 --> 01:04:33.830
<v Speaker 3>His book changed my life and made me put</v>
<v Speaker 3>down my prescription pad is um,</v>

1372
01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:34.693
<v Speaker 3>Robert Whittaker who's an investigative </v>
<v Speaker 3>journalist and he wrote a book called </v>

1373
01:04:37.581 --> 01:04:40.220
<v Speaker 3>Anatomy of an epidemic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've read it,</v>

1374
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:42.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it came out and I was ready to read</v>

1375
01:04:42.771 --> 01:04:43.604
<v Speaker 3>it because and receive it cause I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>had this health experience in my own </v>

1376
01:04:46.701 --> 01:04:47.534
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I read it and basically what he says </v>

1377
01:04:49.311 --> 01:04:50.061
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1378
01:04:50.061 --> 01:04:53.150
<v Speaker 3>so we have escalating rates of </v>
<v Speaker 3>treatment,</v>

1379
01:04:53.151 --> 01:04:54.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like more and more people,</v>

1380
01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:55.843
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>16% of the American population is on </v>

1381
01:04:57.291 --> 01:04:58.124
<v Speaker 3>these meds.</v>

1382
01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:00.350
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good on a lot of your friends,</v>

1383
01:05:00.351 --> 01:05:05.351
<v Speaker 3>my friends and with more treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't we have less disability?</v>

1384
01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.630
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like shouldn't people be more functional</v>

1385
01:05:08.631 --> 01:05:09.464
<v Speaker 3>and less sick?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we find is that the reverse is </v>

1386
01:05:12.741 --> 01:05:13.371
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1387
01:05:13.371 --> 01:05:16.130
<v Speaker 3>that we have more disability with more </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicating.</v>

1388
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:20.380
<v Speaker 3>So his book goes through all of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies.</v>

1389
01:05:20.381 --> 01:05:23.770
<v Speaker 3>I never heard about one of them in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>ivy league training.</v>

1390
01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:27.100
<v Speaker 3>All of these studies that are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>industry funded,</v>

1391
01:05:27.370 --> 01:05:28.203
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because we know that the pharmaceutical </v>

1392
01:05:29.141 --> 01:05:31.900
<v Speaker 3>industry is four times more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 3>publish something.</v>

1393
01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:33.043
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it's positive then when it's not </v>

1394
01:05:34.391 --> 01:05:35.224
<v Speaker 3>and they can publish whatever they want </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not publish whatever they don't </v>

1395
01:05:37.031 --> 01:05:37.721
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1396
01:05:37.721 --> 01:05:40.540
<v Speaker 3>So they are in charge of their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>policing,</v>

1397
01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:43.960
<v Speaker 3>which is the Fox guarding the hen house </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a situation.</v>

1398
01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:45.393
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so these were all non industry funded </v>

1399
01:05:47.561 --> 01:05:52.360
<v Speaker 3>studies and the story they tell is quite</v>
<v Speaker 3>different than what you might imagine.</v>

1400
01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:54.370
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like almost shocking,</v>

1401
01:05:54.371 --> 01:05:56.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That you have schizophrenia,</v>

1402
01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:58.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously you need to take meds,</v>

1403
01:05:59.170 --> 01:05:59.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1404
01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:00.753
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what if like doing something is not </v>

1405
01:06:02.471 --> 01:06:05.320
<v Speaker 3>as good as doing nothing according to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the published literature,</v>

1406
01:06:05.321 --> 01:06:05.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1407
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:06.463
<v Speaker 4>So doing nothing is better according to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the published literature then doing </v>

1408
01:06:09.891 --> 01:06:13.810
<v Speaker 4>something than doing medications.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So taking medication for site,</v>

1409
01:06:13.850 --> 01:06:16.010
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a psychotic disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

1410
01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:17.810
<v Speaker 4>what are the odds that it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>work?</v>

1411
01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:19.373
<v Speaker 3>So when we're looking at the data that </v>
<v Speaker 3>suggests that it's effective to take an </v>

1412
01:06:23.821 --> 01:06:27.540
<v Speaker 3>anti psychotic there without exception </v>
<v Speaker 3>short term studies.</v>

1413
01:06:27.541 --> 01:06:29.340
<v Speaker 3>So six to eight weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

1414
01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.233
<v Speaker 3>But people are taking these medications </v>
<v Speaker 3>for months to years and they lose their </v>

1415
01:06:34.411 --> 01:06:35.244
<v Speaker 3>efficiency over time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where their effectiveness or dating </v>

1416
01:06:37.231 --> 01:06:39.240
<v Speaker 3>effects usually upfront.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not the same as us.</v>

1417
01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:41.190
<v Speaker 3>The sorrows in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1418
01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.113
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the story is similar because if we look </v>

1419
01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:49.890
<v Speaker 3>at our outcomes and long term like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like do you have a job?</v>

1420
01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you have a friend network you like,</v>

1421
01:06:52.830 --> 01:06:53.663
<v Speaker 3>are you a functional member of society?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we look at those parameters in the </v>

1422
01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.940
<v Speaker 3>longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people do worse.</v>

1423
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:02.040
<v Speaker 3>And that's his argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1424
01:07:02.041 --> 01:07:02.874
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why we have more and more of the </v>

1425
01:07:03.931 --> 01:07:04.764
<v Speaker 3>population literally getting checks from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government because they cannot </v>

1426
01:07:07.231 --> 01:07:10.860
<v Speaker 3>function in society even though they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicated to the hilt,</v>

1427
01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're fully treated,</v>

1428
01:07:12.571 --> 01:07:13.404
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>

1429
01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.690
<v Speaker 3>And he makes this argument for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Benzodiazepines,</v>

1430
01:07:15.691 --> 01:07:18.110
<v Speaker 3>for stimulants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you look into the literature,</v>

1431
01:07:18.130 --> 01:07:18.963
<v Speaker 3>you understand that all that's happening</v>
<v Speaker 3>is you're forcing an adaptation on the </v>

1432
01:07:24.001 --> 01:07:25.740
<v Speaker 3>part of the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a chemical,</v>

1433
01:07:25.741 --> 01:07:29.490
<v Speaker 3>it is not fixing anything and just like </v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol.</v>

1434
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.940
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some people love alcohols.</v>

1435
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.820
<v Speaker 3>For some people it's very relaxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1436
01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:38.430
<v Speaker 3>Some people hate it and it's terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it makes them sick.</v>

1437
01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:39.863
<v Speaker 3>So just like any other chemical </v>
<v Speaker 3>substance with unpredictably </v>

1438
01:07:42.781 --> 01:07:47.781
<v Speaker 3>psychoactive effects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it may be adaptive for a given period of</v>

1439
01:07:48.031 --> 01:07:48.864
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we know through the alcohol analogy </v>

1440
01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:51.990
<v Speaker 3>that there's no free lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1441
01:07:51.991 --> 01:07:53.640
<v Speaker 3>So even if it's adaptive in the short </v>
<v Speaker 3>term,</v>

1442
01:07:53.641 --> 01:07:57.570
<v Speaker 3>your body adapts habituates you become </v>
<v Speaker 3>potentially dependent,</v>

1443
01:07:57.571 --> 01:08:00.030
<v Speaker 3>although that's a more complex </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

1444
01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:05.540
<v Speaker 3>You know what drives that dependency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the longterm is known to us like the</v>

1445
01:08:06.511 --> 01:08:10.830
<v Speaker 3>long term picture of like chronic use of</v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol for let's say social anxiety.</v>

1446
01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:11.663
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't look pretty if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>just stop drinking 15 years down the </v>

1447
01:08:13.681 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 3>line after you've been drinking every </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1448
01:08:16.011 --> 01:08:16.844
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we've been told to think of psych </v>

1449
01:08:17.541 --> 01:08:18.374
<v Speaker 3>meds differently and when I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say is we shouldn't be right because </v>

1450
01:08:22.191 --> 01:08:26.090
<v Speaker 3>they are just chemicals having chemical </v>
<v Speaker 3>effects that your body is adapting to.</v>

1451
01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.420
<v Speaker 3>So obviously that chemical effect is not</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to endure that.</v>

1452
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:32.420
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not going to last.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's going to be a cost.</v>

1453
01:08:32.690 --> 01:08:37.190
<v Speaker 3>So one of the major pieces of informed </v>
<v Speaker 3>consent I would like to see foregrounded</v>

1454
01:08:37.191 --> 01:08:38.024
<v Speaker 3>for people is it may be nearly </v>
<v Speaker 3>physically impossible for you to come </v>

1455
01:08:43.431 --> 01:08:47.240
<v Speaker 3>off of this medication after several </v>
<v Speaker 3>years of use.</v>

1456
01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:48.890
<v Speaker 3>Are you cool with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1457
01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:49.724
<v Speaker 3>Like are you physically impossible and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all you have to do is google like </v>

1458
01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:59.030
<v Speaker 3>antidepressant withdrawal or </v>
<v Speaker 3>benzodiazepine withdrawal,</v>

1459
01:08:59.031 --> 01:09:01.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause we're keeping people on these meds</v>

1460
01:09:01.251 --> 01:09:01.650
<v Speaker 3>longterm.</v>

1461
01:09:01.650 --> 01:09:04.640
<v Speaker 3>Cause of course we're not fixing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>root cause of the problem,</v>

1462
01:09:04.641 --> 01:09:05.474
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you have glass in your </v>

1463
01:09:06.501 --> 01:09:08.570
<v Speaker 3>foot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not taking the glass out.</v>

1464
01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:12.050
<v Speaker 3>We're just like putting a bandaid on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving you a tylenol and being like,</v>

1465
01:09:12.051 --> 01:09:13.820
<v Speaker 3>okay get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1466
01:09:13.821 --> 01:09:16.610
<v Speaker 3>so we're not fixing the problem so to </v>
<v Speaker 3>speak.</v>

1467
01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:20.690
<v Speaker 3>So we're masking it and there's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>

1468
01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:21.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of it's going to,</v>

1469
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:23.263
<v Speaker 3>it's like a whack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like is this going to keep manifesting </v>

1470
01:09:25.101 --> 01:09:25.934
<v Speaker 3>in other ways?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people are kept on these meds </v>

1471
01:09:28.431 --> 01:09:32.540
<v Speaker 3>longterm and then coming off them is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've come to the conclusion that they're</v>

1472
01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:35.000
<v Speaker 3>more habit forming than any chemicals on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the planet.</v>

1473
01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:37.610
<v Speaker 3>Crack Oxi content,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

1474
01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:38.780
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do not.</v>

1475
01:09:38.781 --> 01:09:42.320
<v Speaker 3>Hold a candle to how hard it can be to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come off of psych meds.</v>

1476
01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:43.813
<v Speaker 3>All you need to do is ask someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your friends are very rare examples </v>

1477
01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:46.753
<v Speaker 3>because there are millions of people on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Internet right now trying to help </v>

1478
01:09:49.011 --> 01:09:54.011
<v Speaker 3>each other like survive the process of </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming physically survive,</v>

1479
01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:56.390
<v Speaker 3>let alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1480
01:09:56.391 --> 01:09:59.060
<v Speaker 3>psycho spiritually survive the process </v>
<v Speaker 3>of coming off of meds.</v>

1481
01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:00.860
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I focus on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1482
01:10:00.861 --> 01:10:02.870
<v Speaker 3>in my day to day practice now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1483
01:10:02.871 --> 01:10:06.620
<v Speaker 3>Are there certain meds that are more </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult to come off than others?</v>

1484
01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:08.413
<v Speaker 3>I would say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although I've seen exceptions to that </v>

1485
01:10:11.001 --> 01:10:11.751
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1486
01:10:11.751 --> 01:10:12.584
<v Speaker 3>I would say that there are certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants that are notoriously </v>

1487
01:10:15.591 --> 01:10:17.090
<v Speaker 3>challenging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1488
01:10:17.091 --> 01:10:20.300
<v Speaker 3>meds like Paxil or affects her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then Prozac,</v>

1489
01:10:20.301 --> 01:10:21.134
<v Speaker 3>which is supposed to be like have this </v>
<v Speaker 3>long half life and be easy to come off </v>

1490
01:10:23.571 --> 01:10:24.404
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I have patients who develop what </v>

1491
01:10:26.031 --> 01:10:26.864
<v Speaker 3>looks like aids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they get so sick in such </v>

1492
01:10:29.661 --> 01:10:34.580
<v Speaker 3>complicated ways that no one believes </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and then they think that they're,</v>

1493
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:36.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you must have ms or you must have,</v>

1494
01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:38.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mano or you must have,</v>

1495
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:39.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some new diagnosis.</v>

1496
01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:43.280
<v Speaker 3>And in the literature since 2014 has </v>
<v Speaker 3>told us,</v>

1497
01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:45.070
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a withdrawal is,</v>

1498
01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:45.913
<v Speaker 3>is a complicated protracted withdrawal </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is worse than any other meds out </v>

1499
01:10:50.691 --> 01:10:51.350
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1500
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:54.260
<v Speaker 3>And so if you knew that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might be like,</v>

1501
01:10:54.261 --> 01:10:55.700
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what are my other options?</v>

1502
01:10:55.701 --> 01:10:57.830
<v Speaker 3>Do I have other options?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1503
01:10:57.831 --> 01:10:58.664
<v Speaker 3>since I put down my prescription,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have many years now of experience of </v>

1504
01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.173
<v Speaker 3>treating all manner of bipolar disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suicidality and psychosis without </v>

1505
01:11:07.101 --> 01:11:07.934
<v Speaker 3>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And let me tell you like the outcomes </v>

1506
01:11:09.501 --> 01:11:10.334
<v Speaker 3>that I get today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't have fantasized about when I </v>

1507
01:11:13.171 --> 01:11:14.004
<v Speaker 3>was prescribing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know that this was </v>

1508
01:11:15.301 --> 01:11:16.134
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you know that these outcomes are </v>

1509
01:11:17.971 --> 01:11:18.804
<v Speaker 3>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then maybe you would consider a </v>

1510
01:11:20.761 --> 01:11:24.150
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you have to know it's possible.</v>

1511
01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.450
<v Speaker 5>That's informed consent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Best case scenario.</v>

1512
01:11:26.451 --> 01:11:30.140
<v Speaker 5>When you were prescribing and d,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what did it ever feel like?</v>

1513
01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:31.860
<v Speaker 5>Like what I mean did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did,</v>

1514
01:11:31.861 --> 01:11:35.840
<v Speaker 5>did it ever get to the point where you </v>
<v Speaker 5>were wondering like,</v>

1515
01:11:36.130 --> 01:11:38.600
<v Speaker 5>the none of none of these people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>really getting better.</v>

1516
01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:39.643
<v Speaker 5>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're improving in certain ways where </v>

1517
01:11:41.361 --> 01:11:42.194
<v Speaker 5>they're not getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to the goal of getting </v>

1518
01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:46.430
<v Speaker 5>them totally better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was your goal?</v>

1519
01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:51.320
<v Speaker 5>Management Management.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the idea is you have an issue.</v>

1520
01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:52.243
<v Speaker 5>This issue has never gone away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's just throw a wet blanket on the </v>

1521
01:11:54.151 --> 01:11:54.984
<v Speaker 5>soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1522
01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:56.000
<v Speaker 5>See if we could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1523
01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:56.893
<v Speaker 5>hold down the fire.</v>

1524
01:11:56.970 --> 01:11:58.200
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know what,</v>

1525
01:11:58.201 --> 01:11:59.340
<v Speaker 3>I have a lot of compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1526
01:11:59.390 --> 01:12:01.200
<v Speaker 3>many of my friends are conventional </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychiatrist,</v>

1527
01:12:01.201 --> 01:12:02.034
<v Speaker 3>so I have compassion for people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the trenches practicing conventional </v>

1528
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:08.520
<v Speaker 3>approaches because I thought I was doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1529
01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:09.533
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was prescribing I thought I was </v>

1530
01:12:10.921 --> 01:12:12.360
<v Speaker 3>doing good things for these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1531
01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:13.560
<v Speaker 5>These friends,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1532
01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:15.910
<v Speaker 5>how do they feel about what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>now?</v>

1533
01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:18.810
<v Speaker 3>They sort of like tolerate me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1534
01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:20.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny because,</v>

1535
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:23.460
<v Speaker 3>because I have this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you want to call it,</v>

1536
01:12:23.461 --> 01:12:25.410
<v Speaker 3>like scientific advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning like,</v>

1537
01:12:25.411 --> 01:12:27.150
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know more of the literature,</v>

1538
01:12:27.151 --> 01:12:27.984
<v Speaker 3>I've read more of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've obsessive Lee devoted my life to </v>

1539
01:12:30.811 --> 01:12:33.750
<v Speaker 3>this subject.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know sort of not to fuck with me on</v>

1540
01:12:33.751 --> 01:12:34.650
<v Speaker 3>some level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1541
01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:37.440
<v Speaker 3>so I have respect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1542
01:12:37.441 --> 01:12:40.890
<v Speaker 3>but they also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like my thing that I do over here,</v>

1543
01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.940
<v Speaker 3>we have a business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my business given pills.</v>

1544
01:12:44.941 --> 01:12:47.760
<v Speaker 3>Crazy people like leave me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1545
01:12:47.761 --> 01:12:49.860
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I share an office,</v>

1546
01:12:49.861 --> 01:12:51.240
<v Speaker 3>one of my best friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1547
01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:54.510
<v Speaker 3>he rents from my office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1548
01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:57.900
<v Speaker 3>with all the Buddhas everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

1549
01:12:57.901 --> 01:12:59.280
<v Speaker 3>he's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's more conscious about it.</v>

1550
01:12:59.281 --> 01:12:59.821
<v Speaker 3>Then the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

1551
01:12:59.821 --> 01:13:01.470
<v Speaker 3>he works in forensics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1552
01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:02.333
<v Speaker 3>which means that he works to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>identify where people in the legal </v>

1553
01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:09.750
<v Speaker 3>system are being medicated necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>or unnecessarily.</v>

1554
01:13:09.751 --> 01:13:10.501
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1555
01:13:10.501 --> 01:13:11.334
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>specializations within the guild of </v>

1556
01:13:13.711 --> 01:13:16.410
<v Speaker 3>psychiatry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a many tentacled animal.</v>

1557
01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:17.323
<v Speaker 5>So when you say management,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like did you ever take someone from </v>

1558
01:13:20.301 --> 01:13:21.134
<v Speaker 5>being like a real mess and bring them </v>
<v Speaker 5>off the ledge and then their life </v>

1559
01:13:24.801 --> 01:13:25.634
<v Speaker 5>improved?</v>

1560
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:27.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1561
01:13:27.610 --> 01:13:29.590
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the good summary of,</v>

1562
01:13:29.591 --> 01:13:30.424
<v Speaker 3>of what I do today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I see the sickest people that no one </v>

1563
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:35.320
<v Speaker 3>can help because they've gotten to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>end of the road.</v>

1564
01:13:35.321 --> 01:13:37.420
<v Speaker 3>So they've done electroconvulsive </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy,</v>

1565
01:13:37.421 --> 01:13:39.670
<v Speaker 3>they're on six medications,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been hospitalized,</v>

1566
01:13:39.671 --> 01:13:42.850
<v Speaker 3>even in state facilities there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1567
01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:45.370
<v Speaker 3>at the end of their rope because they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not well.</v>

1568
01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:48.760
<v Speaker 3>And even conventional psychiatry has </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing left to offer them.</v>

1569
01:13:48.761 --> 01:13:49.840
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1570
01:13:49.841 --> 01:13:50.501
<v Speaker 3>people think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1571
01:13:50.501 --> 01:13:52.960
<v Speaker 3>I treat the worried well like some upper</v>
<v Speaker 3>east side,</v>

1572
01:13:53.290 --> 01:13:54.123
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman who's having an affair and she's </v>

1573
01:13:55.281 --> 01:13:57.280
<v Speaker 3>stressed out or whatever it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the worried well,</v>

1574
01:13:57.310 --> 01:13:58.420
<v Speaker 3>the worried well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1575
01:13:58.990 --> 01:14:00.130
<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1576
01:14:00.131 --> 01:14:00.964
<v Speaker 3>it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my patients are very sick and you </v>

1577
01:14:03.881 --> 01:14:07.660
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have an online version of what I do in</v>

1578
01:14:07.661 --> 01:14:10.990
<v Speaker 3>the office and the outcomes there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>even wilder,</v>

1579
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:11.973
<v Speaker 3>the ones in my office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can even do this totally on your </v>

1580
01:14:14.291 --> 01:14:15.730
<v Speaker 3>own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like some Voodoo,</v>

1581
01:14:15.731 --> 01:14:17.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm working on Madison Avenue in New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York,</v>

1582
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:20.740
<v Speaker 3>but like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay so one of my,</v>

1583
01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:24.610
<v Speaker 3>so I've started to video interview these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people as social proof and like it's all</v>

1584
01:14:24.611 --> 01:14:25.444
<v Speaker 3>about my website and you can see what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to say about it because why </v>

1585
01:14:27.611 --> 01:14:30.820
<v Speaker 3>would you believe me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause it sounds crazy what I'm saying.</v>

1586
01:14:30.821 --> 01:14:31.654
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

1587
01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:33.910
<v Speaker 4>so say I come to you and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1588
01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:37.680
<v Speaker 4>I've got real problems across all Tommy </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brown,</v>

1589
01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:39.910
<v Speaker 4>super bummed out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't keep it together.</v>

1590
01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:44.980
<v Speaker 3>99 problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this I'll tell you about a woman,</v>

1591
01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:46.420
<v Speaker 3>allie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1592
01:14:47.170 --> 01:14:48.850
<v Speaker 3>so she a real name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1593
01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:51.280
<v Speaker 3>she's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's on my website and a video.</v>

1594
01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:52.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That she's done.</v>

1595
01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:55.840
<v Speaker 3>She is an intrepid woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's an incredible,</v>

1596
01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:57.430
<v Speaker 3>some beloved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1597
01:14:57.670 --> 01:15:00.340
<v Speaker 3>I've never said that about a person </v>
<v Speaker 3>during trepid.</v>

1598
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:03.230
<v Speaker 3>She is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the point I'm ultimately going to</v>

1599
01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:08.240
<v Speaker 3>make is that this process of moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the fire of your mental illness,</v>

1600
01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:14.410
<v Speaker 3>which I don't believe in mental illness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but moving through the fire.</v>

1601
01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you believe?</v>

1602
01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:20.350
<v Speaker 3>I believe that we are by design as </v>
<v Speaker 3>humans.</v>

1603
01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:21.470
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1604
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:26.000
<v Speaker 3>You know that we feel things intensely </v>
<v Speaker 3>and some people have experiences,</v>

1605
01:15:26.001 --> 01:15:27.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in other cultural settings,</v>

1606
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:30.980
<v Speaker 3>some of the early experiences as what we</v>
<v Speaker 3>would label schizophrenia.</v>

1607
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:32.323
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is an elder that is assigned to </v>

1608
01:15:33.381 --> 01:15:34.214
<v Speaker 3>you to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to shepherd you through your psycho </v>

1609
01:15:35.841 --> 01:15:37.730
<v Speaker 3>spiritual emergence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1610
01:15:37.731 --> 01:15:38.564
<v Speaker 3>we just don't have a cultural context </v>
<v Speaker 3>for anything other than full and total </v>

1611
01:15:41.421 --> 01:15:42.254
<v Speaker 3>complacency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>full and total adaptation to this sick </v>

1612
01:15:45.071 --> 01:15:45.920
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1613
01:15:45.921 --> 01:15:46.660
<v Speaker 3>So just</v>

1614
01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:47.493
<v Speaker 4>godless of environmental influences and </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever genetic problems you might </v>

1615
01:15:52.751 --> 01:15:53.584
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people can have something really wrong </v>

1616
01:15:55.631 --> 01:15:56.710
<v Speaker 4>with their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1617
01:15:57.690 --> 01:16:00.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't ever think it's really wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>when it gets really wrong,</v>

1618
01:16:00.511 --> 01:16:03.020
<v Speaker 3>is under the influence of Psych meds </v>
<v Speaker 3>always.</v>

1619
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:05.480
<v Speaker 3>So there's very few exceptions.</v>

1620
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:06.423
<v Speaker 4>If someone's experiencing psychotic </v>
<v Speaker 4>breaks and they don't get put on psych </v>

1621
01:16:09.041 --> 01:16:09.874
<v Speaker 4>medication,</v>

1622
01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:11.353
<v Speaker 3>does it go away?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what the longterm data I </v>

1623
01:16:13.181 --> 01:16:15.130
<v Speaker 3>was describing for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

1624
01:16:15.190 --> 01:16:16.023
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have turned what might've been a </v>

1625
01:16:17.261 --> 01:16:18.094
<v Speaker 3>single episode experience that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly supported for totally </v>

1626
01:16:22.690 --> 01:16:25.210
<v Speaker 3>completely resolves and you get back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

1627
01:16:25.570 --> 01:16:28.360
<v Speaker 3>which is what used to happen even in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>early 19 hundreds,</v>

1628
01:16:28.361 --> 01:16:31.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we documented the natural history,</v>

1629
01:16:31.301 --> 01:16:32.920
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of these illnesses,</v>

1630
01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:35.980
<v Speaker 3>we would see that they would go away on </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own within a year,</v>

1631
01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:36.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>80% of it.</v>

1632
01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:39.040
<v Speaker 4>So when they would come up out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>nowhere,</v>

1633
01:16:39.041 --> 01:16:41.020
<v Speaker 4>they would go away out of nowhere as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

1634
01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:41.953
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>

1635
01:16:42.050 --> 01:16:45.130
<v Speaker 3>And we've turned them how many people </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about Aussies,</v>

1636
01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:46.360
<v Speaker 3>sorry to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like what,</v>

1637
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:49.490
<v Speaker 3>how big is this study?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how many people are being many,</v>

1638
01:16:49.491 --> 01:16:51.530
<v Speaker 3>many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is where whittaker is like,</v>

1639
01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:53.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my knight in shining armor,</v>

1640
01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:55.880
<v Speaker 3>Robert Winter Guard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's cataloged all of this data.</v>

1641
01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:57.173
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a robust amount of data and </v>

1642
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.190
<v Speaker 3>importantly it wasn't paid for by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>industry.</v>

1643
01:17:01.610 --> 01:17:04.660
<v Speaker 3>So that's an important bias to control </v>
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>

1644
01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:05.513
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if someone comes to you and they're </v>

1645
01:17:07.041 --> 01:17:08.600
<v Speaker 3>psychotic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1646
01:17:08.601 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 3>so something to tell you about Allie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1647
01:17:10.170 --> 01:17:11.150
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1648
01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:14.390
<v Speaker 3>and her video is on my website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is all you know,</v>

1649
01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:18.410
<v Speaker 3>fully with her consent that I share it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she came to me end of her rope.</v>

1650
01:17:18.411 --> 01:17:23.411
<v Speaker 3>She came with her husband from Kansas to</v>
<v Speaker 3>my office and she was actively,</v>

1651
01:17:25.130 --> 01:17:26.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in an episode.</v>

1652
01:17:26.511 --> 01:17:27.380
<v Speaker 3>What are her episodes?</v>

1653
01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:28.213
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her episodes are three days before her </v>

1654
01:17:29.991 --> 01:17:34.400
<v Speaker 3>period for years she would develop </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychotic symptoms,</v>

1655
01:17:34.401 --> 01:17:35.234
<v Speaker 3>become totally paranoid and delusional </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the extent that at one point she was </v>

1656
01:17:38.511 --> 01:17:39.344
<v Speaker 3>digging a hole in her face trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>at like a thread she thought was in </v>

1657
01:17:42.831 --> 01:17:44.210
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She committed,</v>

1658
01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:46.820
<v Speaker 3>attempted to commit suicide multiple </v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

1659
01:17:46.821 --> 01:17:47.654
<v Speaker 3>She had been on at least seven different</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychiatric medications in and out of </v>

1660
01:17:50.991 --> 01:17:51.824
<v Speaker 3>hospitals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a laundry list of diagnoses like </v>

1661
01:17:54.891 --> 01:17:58.040
<v Speaker 3>this literally including bipolar </v>
<v Speaker 3>disorder with psychotic features,</v>

1662
01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:00.620
<v Speaker 3>premenstrual dysphoric disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1663
01:18:00.621 --> 01:18:03.740
<v Speaker 3>all manner of dating back from like </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating disorders.</v>

1664
01:18:03.741 --> 01:18:06.320
<v Speaker 3>In her earlier history she'd been </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the ringer.</v>

1665
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:07.183
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she was like a professional psych </v>

1666
01:18:08.061 --> 01:18:12.290
<v Speaker 3>patient and I was the last stop before </v>
<v Speaker 3>an inpatient facility.</v>

1667
01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:15.050
<v Speaker 3>Basically like institutionalization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1668
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:21.370
<v Speaker 3>I told her this is how it's going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I have like a very heavy hand upfront</v>

1669
01:18:22.161 --> 01:18:24.500
<v Speaker 3>and I can be a hard ass for sure.</v>

1670
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:27.860
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's in service of passing the baton</v>

1671
01:18:28.010 --> 01:18:31.610
<v Speaker 3>to these women because I don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>longterm patients.</v>

1672
01:18:31.611 --> 01:18:33.730
<v Speaker 3>Like there's an intense window and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1673
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:35.083
<v Speaker 3>they're done with me right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once they're through the birth canal so </v>

1674
01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:38.504
<v Speaker 3>to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1675
01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:42.200
<v Speaker 3>So what I asked her to do is follow a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very strict diet,</v>

1676
01:18:42.201 --> 01:18:45.530
<v Speaker 3>no cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none like zero bullshit.</v>

1677
01:18:45.770 --> 01:18:47.180
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's the Diet?</v>

1678
01:18:47.610 --> 01:18:48.443
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the template for the Diet that I </v>

1679
01:18:51.801 --> 01:18:54.980
<v Speaker 3>recommend is based not only on like my </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal experience,</v>

1680
01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:58.400
<v Speaker 3>but also on my work with my mentor Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nicholas Gonzalez,</v>

1681
01:18:58.401 --> 01:19:02.180
<v Speaker 3>who was the most best figure in modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine.</v>

1682
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:07.510
<v Speaker 3>He passed suddenly in 2015 but he for 27</v>
<v Speaker 3>years treated terminal cancer,</v>

1683
01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:11.030
<v Speaker 3>metastatic like no hope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer,</v>

1684
01:19:11.031 --> 01:19:12.390
<v Speaker 3>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1685
01:19:12.410 --> 01:19:14.990
<v Speaker 3>neurodegenerative illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lyme disease,</v>

1686
01:19:15.230 --> 01:19:16.063
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diabetes all with a 100% holistic </v>

1687
01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.490
<v Speaker 3>approach that was based on three </v>
<v Speaker 3>pillars,</v>

1688
01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:25.580
<v Speaker 3>a personalized diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like one of 10 diets,</v>

1689
01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:27.530
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee enemas.</v>

1690
01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:28.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know that?</v>

1691
01:19:28.911 --> 01:19:30.830
<v Speaker 3>If you heard of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1692
01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:34.250
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's like in the Zeitgeists like </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are hearing about coffee enemas.</v>

1693
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:36.020
<v Speaker 3>Coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1694
01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:36.854
<v Speaker 3>I know it's only necessary because we </v>
<v Speaker 3>live in like a pretty toxic world at </v>

1695
01:19:41.001 --> 01:19:44.060
<v Speaker 3>this point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what happens is the caffeine,</v>

1696
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:46.520
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're sticking this little tube like</v>

1697
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:47.383
<v Speaker 3>12 inches of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually I know and it seems totally </v>

1698
01:19:51.231 --> 01:19:52.670
<v Speaker 3>crazy and weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you do it all yourself.</v>

1699
01:19:52.671 --> 01:19:54.890
<v Speaker 3>You don't go somewhere to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like that.</v>

1700
01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:58.130
<v Speaker 3>And you're hitting this like it's called</v>
<v Speaker 3>a flexor.</v>

1701
01:19:58.131 --> 01:19:58.964
<v Speaker 3>You're hitting this point right here </v>
<v Speaker 3>where your intestines come across and </v>

1702
01:20:01.581 --> 01:20:03.050
<v Speaker 3>then down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1703
01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:08.290
<v Speaker 3>And right there is a nerve bundle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That reflex is to your,</v>

1704
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:10.260
<v Speaker 3>it's called a parasympathetic nerve </v>
<v Speaker 3>bundle.</v>

1705
01:20:10.261 --> 01:20:11.094
<v Speaker 3>It reflexes to your liver and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically helps your liver to dump </v>

1706
01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:16.860
<v Speaker 3>toxicants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>

1707
01:20:16.861 --> 01:20:19.540
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a supercharging of your livers</v>

1708
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:21.600
<v Speaker 3>ability to detox you.</v>

1709
01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:22.673
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coffee in there because the caffeine </v>

1710
01:20:24.451 --> 01:20:25.284
<v Speaker 3>stimulates that nerve bundle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's basically like jacking up your </v>

1711
01:20:27.751 --> 01:20:28.584
<v Speaker 3>liver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It cause we don't know how to detox </v>

1712
01:20:30.271 --> 01:20:31.104
<v Speaker 3>better than our own body does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your liver is charged with that </v>

1713
01:20:32.971 --> 01:20:36.150
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you can help your liver do it,</v>

1714
01:20:36.570 --> 01:20:38.190
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1715
01:20:38.191 --> 01:20:39.024
<v Speaker 3>and this is most relevant in cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like radical cancer treatments because </v>

1716
01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:44.153
<v Speaker 3>when the tumors are breaking down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to flush that waste or you'll </v>

1717
01:20:48.091 --> 01:20:48.924
<v Speaker 3>die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like literally it's called Tumor Lysis </v>

1718
01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:52.170
<v Speaker 3>Syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1719
01:20:52.171 --> 01:20:55.770
<v Speaker 3>some early pioneers discover that coffee</v>
<v Speaker 3>enemas are critical,</v>

1720
01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:59.790
<v Speaker 3>like literally life or death critical </v>
<v Speaker 3>for helping you flush those wastes.</v>

1721
01:20:59.791 --> 01:21:00.624
<v Speaker 3>So I learned about them from the master </v>
<v Speaker 3>and since using them in my practice </v>

1722
01:21:05.731 --> 01:21:06.564
<v Speaker 3>completely changed my practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like a med taper that would take two </v>

1723
01:21:08.911 --> 01:21:13.380
<v Speaker 3>to three years now takes me like six </v>
<v Speaker 3>months was a given patient and,</v>

1724
01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:14.071
<v Speaker 3>and Allie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1725
01:21:14.071 --> 01:21:18.030
<v Speaker 3>so allie started doing coffee enemas </v>
<v Speaker 3>twice a day.</v>

1726
01:21:18.330 --> 01:21:21.390
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the dietary template is,</v>

1727
01:21:21.690 --> 01:21:25.560
<v Speaker 3>is a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say it's like totally,</v>

1728
01:21:25.561 --> 01:21:27.270
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1729
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:28.590
<v Speaker 3>people think healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1730
01:21:28.591 --> 01:21:31.200
<v Speaker 3>And they think like Vegan or they think </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetarian or they think,</v>

1731
01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tons of green juice or whatever.</v>

1732
01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:34.403
<v Speaker 3>And I noticed early on that as long as </v>
<v Speaker 3>my patients say to fair amount of red </v>

1733
01:21:36.541 --> 01:21:38.160
<v Speaker 3>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got better.</v>

1734
01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:42.270
<v Speaker 3>And I used to be like an ethical </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetarian when I was eating like cheese</v>

1735
01:21:42.271 --> 01:21:47.271
<v Speaker 3>doodles and Pepsi basically and so it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was very confusing to me that you know,</v>

1736
01:21:47.671 --> 01:21:48.504
<v Speaker 3>red meat could be a healthy part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone's lifestyle or you know anything </v>

1737
01:21:51.901 --> 01:21:54.480
<v Speaker 3>I could ever wrap my mind around </v>
<v Speaker 3>recommending.</v>

1738
01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:59.960
<v Speaker 3>But over the past 10 years and now with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the understanding of Nick's metric,</v>

1739
01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:01.553
<v Speaker 3>you know where there are some people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>do require red meat to balance their </v>

1740
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:06.800
<v Speaker 3>nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essential</v>

1741
01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:08.713
<v Speaker 5>actual requirement or is this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can this be mitigated through like a </v>

1742
01:22:13.611 --> 01:22:16.340
<v Speaker 5>very smart and conscious vegetarian </v>
<v Speaker 5>diet?</v>

1743
01:22:16.341 --> 01:22:17.174
<v Speaker 5>Like if you're really careful about your</v>
<v Speaker 5>nutrients and making sure they get the </v>

1744
01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:21.993
<v Speaker 5>essential fatty acids and making sure </v>
<v Speaker 5>you get the essential amino acids and a </v>

1745
01:22:24.711 --> 01:22:27.350
<v Speaker 5>really balanced profile of vegetable </v>
<v Speaker 5>protein.</v>

1746
01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:28.733
<v Speaker 3>It's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately my goal in this month is to </v>

1747
01:22:32.521 --> 01:22:34.000
<v Speaker 3>clear the slate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1748
01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:34.883
<v Speaker 3>Of all the stuff that's like yanking on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain and your immune system and </v>

1749
01:22:38.701 --> 01:22:42.480
<v Speaker 3>driving inflammation so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>begin to sense what you need.</v>

1750
01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:44.250
<v Speaker 5>Has He,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have you ever had anybody that attempted</v>

1751
01:22:44.251 --> 01:22:48.160
<v Speaker 5>to do it was so like hemp protein or pea</v>
<v Speaker 5>protein or a vegetable based proteins</v>

1752
01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:49.830
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am going for gold.</v>

1753
01:22:49.831 --> 01:22:50.664
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm interested in like massive </v>

1754
01:22:52.411 --> 01:22:54.150
<v Speaker 3>transformation for people and not just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1755
01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:55.013
<v Speaker 3>oh I guess I feel a little better so I </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't even see a new patient if they're </v>

1756
01:22:58.021 --> 01:23:01.680
<v Speaker 3>not willing to at least try for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>month to eat red meat.</v>

1757
01:23:01.890 --> 01:23:02.723
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>

1758
01:23:03.730 --> 01:23:06.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm still a little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's all just like what you've</v>

1759
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:06.963
<v Speaker 3>experienced for working with patients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you ever experienced a single </v>

1760
01:23:09.911 --> 01:23:14.110
<v Speaker 3>patient that tried to do it correctly </v>
<v Speaker 3>through vegetable protein,</v>

1761
01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:16.180
<v Speaker 3>the job at mount,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try it.</v>

1762
01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:18.670
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying like,</v>

1763
01:23:18.850 --> 01:23:19.683
<v Speaker 3>but I do have this online program where </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are people who get well on and </v>

1764
01:23:23.801 --> 01:23:28.770
<v Speaker 3>they stick to a vegetarian diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's apparently possible turn it when</v>

1765
01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:29.613
<v Speaker 3>she can get eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know in his model there were no </v>

1766
01:23:32.651 --> 01:23:37.240
<v Speaker 3>vegan diets and it's based on the work </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Weston price.</v>

1767
01:23:37.241 --> 01:23:39.550
<v Speaker 3>You know he is Weston price.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1768
01:23:39.551 --> 01:23:40.384
<v Speaker 3>He's like a dentist in the 19 hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 3>who like went around the world with his </v>

1769
01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:43.984
<v Speaker 3>wife and studied all of these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who like indigenous people all </v>

1770
01:23:47.681 --> 01:23:50.350
<v Speaker 3>over like Eskimos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Himalayan,</v>

1771
01:23:50.351 --> 01:23:52.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>folks,</v>

1772
01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:52.953
<v Speaker 3>Mexican folks in South American and </v>
<v Speaker 3>studied the healthy indigenous </v>

1773
01:23:57.101 --> 01:24:00.220
<v Speaker 3>populations that we're not eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>industrialized food.</v>

1774
01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:01.293
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what he found was they all eight </v>

1775
01:24:02.561 --> 01:24:05.110
<v Speaker 3>different stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there isn't like a diet,</v>

1776
01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:07.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how do you know,</v>

1777
01:24:07.870 --> 01:24:09.640
<v Speaker 3>what is your version?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1778
01:24:09.641 --> 01:24:12.760
<v Speaker 3>So like an Eskimo doesn't eat coconuts </v>
<v Speaker 3>and like a mess.</v>

1779
01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:15.040
<v Speaker 3>I warrior doesn't eat whale blubber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

1780
01:24:15.041 --> 01:24:18.310
<v Speaker 3>how do you know what's your version?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The truth is only,</v>

1781
01:24:18.311 --> 01:24:19.144
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like our signals are so distorted </v>

1782
01:24:21.341 --> 01:24:23.320
<v Speaker 3>and suppress that we can't figure it </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1783
01:24:24.010 --> 01:24:29.010
<v Speaker 3>But you'll begin to like clear the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like lower the white noise enough if you</v>

1784
01:24:29.741 --> 01:24:31.960
<v Speaker 3>have this month long experience of </v>
<v Speaker 3>detox.</v>

1785
01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:34.270
<v Speaker 3>So I asked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked for daily meditation,</v>

1786
01:24:34.271 --> 01:24:35.630
<v Speaker 3>three minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1787
01:24:36.250 --> 01:24:38.020
<v Speaker 3>I told you I'm going to Kundalini </v>
<v Speaker 3>zealot.</v>

1788
01:24:38.021 --> 01:24:41.070
<v Speaker 3>So I asked for people to do that before </v>
<v Speaker 3>the podcast.</v>

1789
01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:42.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1790
01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:43.700
<v Speaker 3>They didn't hear me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1791
01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:44.830
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

1792
01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:49.060
<v Speaker 3>I came to Kundalini Yoga basically out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of sheer desperation at a very difficult</v>

1793
01:24:49.061 --> 01:24:52.510
<v Speaker 3>time in my life after my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>largely after my mentor died.</v>

1794
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:57.010
<v Speaker 3>And it totally changed my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like rewired my nervous system,</v>

1795
01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:57.993
<v Speaker 3>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally where now nothing stresses me </v>

1796
01:25:00.671 --> 01:25:01.750
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you have someone,</v>

1797
01:25:01.751 --> 01:25:02.584
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously not a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you have someone that comes to </v>

1798
01:25:07.961 --> 01:25:08.794
<v Speaker 3>that does not want to eat meat but wants</v>
<v Speaker 3>to try this out and wants to try this </v>

1799
01:25:12.251 --> 01:25:13.630
<v Speaker 3>out with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1800
01:25:13.631 --> 01:25:15.910
<v Speaker 3>it's really just the science of </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrition.</v>

1801
01:25:15.911 --> 01:25:16.744
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can eat a vegan diet and be healthy </v>

1802
01:25:18.461 --> 01:25:20.470
<v Speaker 3>as long as you do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1803
01:25:20.471 --> 01:25:21.304
<v Speaker 3>so his model is that there are different</v>
<v Speaker 3>kinds of people and different kinds of </v>

1804
01:25:25.541 --> 01:25:28.180
<v Speaker 3>people and I can explain a little more </v>
<v Speaker 3>require,</v>

1805
01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:31.210
<v Speaker 3>require for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for their health,</v>

1806
01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:36.480
<v Speaker 3>certain dietary compliments and what are</v>
<v Speaker 3>called the parasympathetic dominance.</v>

1807
01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:39.093
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is more like the Eskimos require </v>

1808
01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:42.573
<v Speaker 3>red meat to be healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You will not only never be fully </v>

1809
01:25:45.821 --> 01:25:46.654
<v Speaker 3>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you're at risk for developing </v>

1810
01:25:48.230 --> 01:25:49.063
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the illnesses that parasympathetic </v>

1811
01:25:50.471 --> 01:25:53.500
<v Speaker 3>dominance develop like leukemia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lymphoma,</v>

1812
01:25:53.770 --> 01:25:55.340
<v Speaker 3>hypothyroidism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1813
01:25:55.490 --> 01:25:57.700
<v Speaker 3>chemical sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chronic fatigue,</v>

1814
01:25:57.850 --> 01:25:58.690
<v Speaker 3>depression.</v>

1815
01:25:59.110 --> 01:26:01.390
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So many,</v>

1816
01:26:01.391 --> 01:26:01.841
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

1817
01:26:01.841 --> 01:26:02.540
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

1818
01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:03.373
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>former vegetarians converted from </v>

1819
01:26:05.541 --> 01:26:08.450
<v Speaker 3>vegetarianism because they felt </v>
<v Speaker 3>depressed,</v>

1820
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:11.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So while that's true,</v>

1821
01:26:11.810 --> 01:26:16.810
<v Speaker 3>on the other side of the spectrum are </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sympathetic dominance who don't need</v>

1822
01:26:16.851 --> 01:26:21.851
<v Speaker 3>to eat red meat and who do really well </v>
<v Speaker 3>on like a full force like plants,</v>

1823
01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:24.170
<v Speaker 3>grains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1824
01:26:24.171 --> 01:26:25.004
<v Speaker 3>even a high carb diet and they feel well</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's when they eat too much red </v>

1825
01:26:29.001 --> 01:26:29.834
<v Speaker 3>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly industrial red meat that </v>

1826
01:26:31.521 --> 01:26:33.800
<v Speaker 3>they developed solid tumors like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1827
01:26:33.801 --> 01:26:37.070
<v Speaker 3>breast cancer or pancreatic cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>colon cancer as this is a very common,</v>

1828
01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:37.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1829
01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:38.553
<v Speaker 5>so essentially when you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly indigenous populations and </v>

1830
01:26:41.891 --> 01:26:42.724
<v Speaker 5>people that have a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a very strong gene pool to comes from </v>

1831
01:26:44.771 --> 01:26:45.604
<v Speaker 5>one very strong area in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the Eskimos or like people that </v>

1832
01:26:48.491 --> 01:26:51.160
<v Speaker 5>live in the Pacific northwest or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

1833
01:26:51.690 --> 01:26:53.920
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not Pacific northwest,</v>

1834
01:26:53.921 --> 01:26:55.990
<v Speaker 5>but you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Alaskan people,</v>

1835
01:26:56.530 --> 01:26:57.363
<v Speaker 5>there's people that live on like </v>
<v Speaker 5>pneumonia vac and all these different </v>

1836
01:26:59.951 --> 01:27:00.784
<v Speaker 5>islands that have eaten seal for </v>
<v Speaker 5>hundreds and hundreds of years and have </v>

1837
01:27:04.181 --> 01:27:06.180
<v Speaker 5>very little access to vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1838
01:27:06.250 --> 01:27:07.350
<v Speaker 5>And meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're healthy,</v>

1839
01:27:07.630 --> 01:27:10.180
<v Speaker 5>super low instances of cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1840
01:27:10.210 --> 01:27:11.043
<v Speaker 5>So is it just because their bodies have </v>
<v Speaker 5>adapted and evolved for those </v>

1841
01:27:14.531 --> 01:27:16.630
<v Speaker 5>requirements with the environment?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

1842
01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:18.850
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly what your body like.</v>

1843
01:27:18.851 --> 01:27:19.684
<v Speaker 5>Say if you came from Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would have a very different </v>

1844
01:27:21.821 --> 01:27:23.870
<v Speaker 5>nutritional requirement then that person</v>
<v Speaker 5>was right.</v>

1845
01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:24.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1846
01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:24.893
<v Speaker 3>And you will never be fully vital or </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy on the wrong version of the </v>

1847
01:27:28.921 --> 01:27:29.220
<v Speaker 3>Diet.</v>

1848
01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:30.390
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just all science.</v>

1849
01:27:30.391 --> 01:27:32.340
<v Speaker 5>Or is this an anecdotal guests?</v>

1850
01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:35.200
<v Speaker 3>So when it comes to nutrition based </v>
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>

1851
01:27:35.410 --> 01:27:37.450
<v Speaker 3>there ain't none.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just none.</v>

1852
01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:38.553
<v Speaker 3>Because the idea of nutrition research </v>
<v Speaker 3>is like taking one nutrient out of the </v>

1853
01:27:41.621 --> 01:27:44.110
<v Speaker 3>context of the person out of the context</v>
<v Speaker 3>of their life,</v>

1854
01:27:44.111 --> 01:27:46.420
<v Speaker 3>out of the context of their cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1855
01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:48.850
<v Speaker 3>his surroundings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how we treat.</v>

1856
01:27:48.851 --> 01:27:50.180
<v Speaker 3>We treat it like a pharmaceutical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

1857
01:27:50.190 --> 01:27:52.510
<v Speaker 3>we look at single nutrient out of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1858
01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:56.050
<v Speaker 3>a whole compliment of information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we just don't,</v>

1859
01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:57.093
<v Speaker 3>I tried learning about nutrition that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way and I drove myself crazy because I </v>

1860
01:28:00.131 --> 01:28:01.840
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell do I tell my patients eat?</v>

1861
01:28:01.841 --> 01:28:03.760
<v Speaker 3>I can't find any science to support </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1862
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.720
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I looked for outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Nick Gonzales is,</v>

1863
01:28:07.721 --> 01:28:11.440
<v Speaker 3>outcomes are unprecedented in medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>

1864
01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:12.513
<v Speaker 3>Literally like 34 year terminal </v>
<v Speaker 3>pancreatic cancer survivor you how long </v>

1865
01:28:15.431 --> 01:28:17.680
<v Speaker 3>you have to live when you're diagnosed </v>
<v Speaker 3>with pancreatic cancer,</v>

1866
01:28:17.850 --> 01:28:21.290
<v Speaker 3>like three to six months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any of those here's</v>

1867
01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:25.490
<v Speaker 5>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he's actually taking meds and uh,</v>

1868
01:28:25.730 --> 01:28:28.700
<v Speaker 5>that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very amazing,</v>

1869
01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:30.500
<v Speaker 5>they still eat sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This fucker.</v>

1870
01:28:32.770 --> 01:28:34.610
<v Speaker 5>He's doing his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gummy bears and shit.</v>

1871
01:28:34.830 --> 01:28:36.470
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you know Rob Wolf?</v>

1872
01:28:36.471 --> 01:28:37.580
<v Speaker 5>Do you know Rob Walters?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1873
01:28:37.581 --> 01:28:38.780
<v Speaker 5>not personally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know his work.</v>

1874
01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:39.673
<v Speaker 5>Rob's a really interesting guy and one </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the things that he does that's kind </v>

1875
01:28:41.601 --> 01:28:46.601
<v Speaker 5>of a fascinating is on his instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He and his wife will do these tests.</v>

1876
01:28:46.970 --> 01:28:51.080
<v Speaker 5>They'll um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll do carbohydrate absorption tasks</v>

1877
01:28:51.081 --> 01:28:55.190
<v Speaker 5>and Ketosis a tests and they'll both eat</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same things,</v>

1878
01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:58.760
<v Speaker 5>but he'll test her and then test him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the results vary widely.</v>

1879
01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:00.450
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His,</v>

1880
01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 5>his reaction is</v>

1881
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:02.993
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just jokes around about how poor his </v>

1882
01:29:04.231 --> 01:29:07.230
<v Speaker 2>genetics are and how about how robust </v>
<v Speaker 2>his wife's genetics are.</v>

1883
01:29:07.231 --> 01:29:09.690
<v Speaker 2>Apparently like nothing can knock </v>
<v Speaker 2>craddick ketosis.</v>

1884
01:29:09.691 --> 01:29:13.080
<v Speaker 2>She can eat like crazy amounts of food </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then like a couple hours later she's</v>

1885
01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:17.070
<v Speaker 2>like back on baseline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas his buyers all are like his body</v>

1886
01:29:17.071 --> 01:29:18.510
<v Speaker 2>just goes off the tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1887
01:29:18.511 --> 01:29:19.920
<v Speaker 2>he's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1888
01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:21.900
<v Speaker 2>So his um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>studies though,</v>

1889
01:29:21.901 --> 01:29:23.580
<v Speaker 2>and it's a little tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although you know,</v>

1890
01:29:23.670 --> 01:29:25.680
<v Speaker 2>they're very small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just him and his wife.</v>

1891
01:29:25.681 --> 01:29:26.514
<v Speaker 2>They're really fascinating to see how </v>
<v Speaker 2>two people who are in the exact same </v>

1892
01:29:30.271 --> 01:29:31.800
<v Speaker 2>household,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same environment,</v>

1893
01:29:32.010 --> 01:29:32.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one's male,</v>

1894
01:29:32.881 --> 01:29:33.714
<v Speaker 2>one's female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also just different genetic and </v>

1895
01:29:34.861 --> 01:29:39.240
<v Speaker 2>backgrounds and how wildly they vary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

1896
01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:40.860
<v Speaker 2>so what do you do with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1897
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:41.701
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1898
01:29:41.701 --> 01:29:44.010
<v Speaker 2>How do you know who you are in medicine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1899
01:29:44.011 --> 01:29:44.844
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the truth is that you have an </v>

1900
01:29:46.681 --> 01:29:48.300
<v Speaker 2>intuitive compass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1901
01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:49.133
<v Speaker 2>Especially with food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are going to want to eat the diet </v>

1902
01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:54.510
<v Speaker 2>that is going to make you well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>candy and ice cream.</v>

1903
01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:56.670
<v Speaker 2>It's intuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

1904
01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you actually like take this break and</v>

1905
01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:02.913
<v Speaker 2>detox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak from all those addictive </v>

1906
01:30:03.871 --> 01:30:06.840
<v Speaker 2>foods and you have this shift in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>

1907
01:30:06.841 --> 01:30:07.674
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be with the wrong cause </v>

1908
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:14.280
<v Speaker 2>Tiramisu after you have like a nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>dinner and you see that on the menu,</v>

1909
01:30:14.281 --> 01:30:15.061
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

1910
01:30:15.061 --> 01:30:16.470
<v Speaker 2>roll it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do this.</v>

1911
01:30:16.471 --> 01:30:20.160
<v Speaker 2>Get that cream with the photo on the top</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

1912
01:30:20.850 --> 01:30:22.020
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gross.</v>

1913
01:30:22.021 --> 01:30:23.480
<v Speaker 2>So we should've never liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1914
01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:27.090
<v Speaker 2>I quit coffee like nine years ago and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now I'm one of those ladies.</v>

1915
01:30:28.110 --> 01:30:31.740
<v Speaker 2>What about the chocolate ice cream?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that okay?</v>

1916
01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:35.190
<v Speaker 2>Nothing doesn't do anything for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you're like some sort of an android</v>

1917
01:30:35.191 --> 01:30:38.630
<v Speaker 2>then what's wrong with you here is into </v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>

1918
01:30:38.631 --> 01:30:39.464
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it starts to like deep condition and </v>

1919
01:30:42.441 --> 01:30:44.940
<v Speaker 2>then if you like really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really feel like something like that,</v>

1920
01:30:45.150 --> 01:30:45.931
<v Speaker 2>then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1921
01:30:45.931 --> 01:30:48.330
<v Speaker 2>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what am I like?</v>

1922
01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:51.390
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck is up?</v>

1923
01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:54.353
<v Speaker 2>Shit is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you ever had like an ice cream </v>

1924
01:30:56.041 --> 01:30:57.720
<v Speaker 2>Sundae,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whipped cream.</v>

1925
01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:02.040
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was born,</v>

1926
01:31:02.041 --> 01:31:06.480
<v Speaker 2>went to friendly's like on the regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I got the happy ending.</v>

1927
01:31:06.481 --> 01:31:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Can you believe it was called that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sunday?</v>

1928
01:31:09.650 --> 01:31:10.483
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fries and a grilled cheese I </v>

1929
01:31:12.181 --> 01:31:13.480
<v Speaker 2>used to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sounds good.</v>

1930
01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:17.790
<v Speaker 2>Through my training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I trained at Bellevue in New York and at</v>

1931
01:31:17.791 --> 01:31:18.624
<v Speaker 2>the gift store they used to know me so </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd have twizzlers and dark </v>

1932
01:31:21.061 --> 01:31:24.030
<v Speaker 2>chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>milky way waiting for me every day,</v>

1933
01:31:24.350 --> 01:31:27.630
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like an addict,</v>

1934
01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:32.460
<v Speaker 2>you know by any definition and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolve that,</v>

1935
01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:35.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then out what actually your meant to</v>

1936
01:31:35.791 --> 01:31:36.624
<v Speaker 2>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause Nicco we said you will eat the </v>

1937
01:31:38.401 --> 01:31:40.950
<v Speaker 2>food that you're meant to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll want it,</v>

1938
01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:42.720
<v Speaker 2>but you have to sort of get your brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the way.</v>

1939
01:31:42.721 --> 01:31:44.250
<v Speaker 2>So if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1940
01:31:44.251 --> 01:31:45.084
<v Speaker 2>all of these nutrition gurus in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>head telling you like red meat's going </v>

1941
01:31:48.121 --> 01:31:50.850
<v Speaker 2>to kill you and give you a heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're gonna not want it.</v>

1942
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:55.620
<v Speaker 2>That's why I demand the openness as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>criteria,</v>

1943
01:31:55.621 --> 01:31:56.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1944
01:31:56.151 --> 01:31:57.670
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to participate with me anyway,</v>

1945
01:31:57.690 --> 01:32:00.160
<v Speaker 2>the clinical setting because then like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't</v>

1946
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:00.993
<v Speaker 3>tell you how many of my patients were </v>
<v Speaker 3>former vegans and now they're totally </v>

1947
01:32:03.821 --> 01:32:04.331
<v Speaker 3>thriving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1948
01:32:04.331 --> 01:32:05.590
<v Speaker 3>So let me finish telling you about </v>
<v Speaker 3>alley,</v>

1949
01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:06.960
<v Speaker 3>which I didn't finish line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1950
01:32:07.150 --> 01:32:09.700
<v Speaker 3>So that's basically what she did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1951
01:32:09.701 --> 01:32:14.350
<v Speaker 3>She was off all meds except for as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as needed Klonopin,</v>

1952
01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:15.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she met me.</v>

1953
01:32:15.911 --> 01:32:18.250
<v Speaker 3>So she had already done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does Klonopin do?</v>

1954
01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:21.190
<v Speaker 3>It's like Adavan like the one we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about with Chris Cornell.</v>

1955
01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:23.920
<v Speaker 3>It's an antianxiety medicine like Xanax </v>
<v Speaker 3>or valium.</v>

1956
01:32:23.921 --> 01:32:25.580
<v Speaker 3>If you've heard of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1957
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:29.490
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the most challenging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1958
01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:33.680
<v Speaker 3>to get off of in the long term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that why wouldn't it be longterm?</v>

1959
01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:38.700
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the confusing part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why would you just voluntarily stop</v>

1960
01:32:39.010 --> 01:32:42.790
<v Speaker 3>taking something that makes you feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>chilled out when you're feeling anxious?</v>

1961
01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:43.624
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what if your anxiety is because you </v>

1962
01:32:46.331 --> 01:32:47.164
<v Speaker 3>have unstable blood sugar and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>having this like fight or flight </v>

1963
01:32:48.970 --> 01:32:51.160
<v Speaker 3>explosion every hour and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1964
01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:51.993
<v Speaker 3>If you're not resolving that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's like putting a bandaid on a </v>

1965
01:32:54.491 --> 01:32:56.140
<v Speaker 3>piece of glass in your foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1966
01:32:56.141 --> 01:32:56.974
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why don't you just fix it and then </v>

1967
01:32:58.121 --> 01:33:01.030
<v Speaker 3>you won't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you make them eat a certain amount of</v>

1968
01:33:01.031 --> 01:33:04.450
<v Speaker 3>red meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do limit the portions to know there's no</v>

1969
01:33:04.451 --> 01:33:06.370
<v Speaker 3>calorie counting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no portion anything.</v>

1970
01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:10.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you are initiating yourself into</v>

1971
01:33:10.151 --> 01:33:12.070
<v Speaker 3>the process of determining what's best </v>
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

1972
01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:13.143
<v Speaker 3>So the whole point of this month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this like military month that I impose </v>

1973
01:33:16.601 --> 01:33:21.601
<v Speaker 3>on people is that it's like an </v>
<v Speaker 3>initiation to your own self.</v>

1974
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:25.180
<v Speaker 3>So the stuff you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's the meditation,</v>

1975
01:33:25.181 --> 01:33:26.014
<v Speaker 3>enemas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>detoxing your products and stuff like </v>

1976
01:33:28.001 --> 01:33:28.834
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basic,</v>

1977
01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:31.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>functional medicine stuff or the Diet is</v>

1978
01:33:31.841 --> 01:33:34.900
<v Speaker 3>all in your control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why you can do this without me,</v>

1979
01:33:34.930 --> 01:33:37.570
<v Speaker 3>which has been the best like evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've ever,</v>

1980
01:33:37.950 --> 01:33:38.783
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never even dreamed that was totally </v>

1981
01:33:40.121 --> 01:33:40.540
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

1982
01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:41.373
<v Speaker 3>And now I'm super pumped about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the last thing I want it to be </v>

1983
01:33:43.961 --> 01:33:45.160
<v Speaker 3>as like about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1984
01:33:45.161 --> 01:33:48.280
<v Speaker 3>the Kelly Brogan effect or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this at all what I'm interested in.</v>

1985
01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:49.631
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

1986
01:33:49.631 --> 01:33:52.870
<v Speaker 3>so you do all this yourself though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>besides road meat.</v>

1987
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:55.030
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically food.</v>

1988
01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:55.953
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're eating animal food like </v>

1989
01:33:58.930 --> 01:33:59.711
<v Speaker 3>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1990
01:33:59.711 --> 01:34:02.200
<v Speaker 3>but listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because tell me this isn't food.</v>

1991
01:34:02.370 --> 01:34:04.330
<v Speaker 3>It's animal food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including,</v>

1992
01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:05.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any kinds of meat,</v>

1993
01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:07.300
<v Speaker 3>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eggs,</v>

1994
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:09.130
<v Speaker 3>whole eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just the way it's,</v>

1995
01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:10.593
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any kind of vegetables except for white </v>

1996
01:34:13.031 --> 01:34:14.470
<v Speaker 3>potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll explain why.</v>

1997
01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:16.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any kinds of fruit,</v>

1998
01:34:17.450 --> 01:34:19.970
<v Speaker 3>nuts and seed seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>natural salts,</v>

1999
01:34:19.971 --> 01:34:22.000
<v Speaker 3>as much as you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tons of filtered water,</v>

2000
01:34:22.001 --> 01:34:25.090
<v Speaker 3>that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then natural fats,</v>

2001
01:34:25.091 --> 01:34:27.730
<v Speaker 3>so like ghee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is clarified butter,</v>

2002
01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:28.990
<v Speaker 3>coconut oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>olive oil,</v>

2003
01:34:28.991 --> 01:34:30.970
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's food.</v>

2004
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:32.343
<v Speaker 3>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you're taking out is a little more </v>

2005
01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:36.033
<v Speaker 3>challenging for some people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're taking out all this is just </v>

2006
01:34:38.621 --> 01:34:41.410
<v Speaker 3>for the month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets so much easier in the future.</v>

2007
01:34:41.411 --> 01:34:44.410
<v Speaker 3>But you're saying it all grains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all beans,</v>

2008
01:34:45.130 --> 01:34:45.963
<v Speaker 3>all dairy and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the ice cream is going and then all </v>

2009
01:34:49.721 --> 01:34:52.570
<v Speaker 3>refined sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like honey and maple syrup are fine.</v>

2010
01:34:53.470 --> 01:34:55.480
<v Speaker 3>And then coffee and alcohol.</v>

2011
01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:00.890
<v Speaker 3>But listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were really desperate,</v>

2012
01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:02.610
<v Speaker 3>you might think about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2013
01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:05.420
<v Speaker 3>And it can be challenging for the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>like week.</v>

2014
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:06.583
<v Speaker 3>And then you start to see the dividends </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you want to just have one month in </v>

2015
01:35:10.101 --> 01:35:12.590
<v Speaker 3>your adult life where you just see </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's up.</v>

2016
01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:16.700
<v Speaker 3>When you control for these variables </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's worth it because then you know what</v>

2017
01:35:16.701 --> 01:35:20.570
<v Speaker 3>the sort of relationships are between </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and your personal,</v>

2018
01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:22.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>biology and these,</v>

2019
01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:24.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>elements of your nutrition.</v>

2020
01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:25.393
<v Speaker 4>So what's the general reaction when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>get someone to get rid of processed </v>

2021
01:35:27.471 --> 01:35:29.150
<v Speaker 4>sugars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cut out the grains,</v>

2022
01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:30.253
<v Speaker 4>cut out the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the non science dairy and just eat </v>

2023
01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:34.730
<v Speaker 4>regular healthy food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the,</v>

2024
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:35.860
<v Speaker 4>what's a normal range</v>

2025
01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:37.493
<v Speaker 3>that sometimes you feel worse depending </v>
<v Speaker 3>on how much of this stuff you were </v>

2026
01:35:40.291 --> 01:35:42.480
<v Speaker 3>eating?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can literally go through like a mini</v>

2027
01:35:42.481 --> 01:35:45.300
<v Speaker 3>withdrawal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like headache,</v>

2028
01:35:45.450 --> 01:35:47.790
<v Speaker 3>fluid symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fatigue,</v>

2029
01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:48.653
<v Speaker 3>irritability,</v>

2030
01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:50.720
<v Speaker 4>the Keto flu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2031
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:52.550
<v Speaker 3>Heartflow yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or Paleo.</v>

2032
01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:53.753
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that can be real from the coffee to </v>

2033
01:35:56.731 --> 01:36:00.270
<v Speaker 3>obviously anyone has ever tried to quit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like a couple days and then you</v>

2034
01:36:00.271 --> 01:36:01.104
<v Speaker 3>move through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when normally starts to happen </v>

2035
01:36:02.791 --> 01:36:05.220
<v Speaker 3>is you start to like sort of feel the </v>
<v Speaker 3>clearing.</v>

2036
01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:07.830
<v Speaker 3>Your energy is better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your sleep is better.</v>

2037
01:36:08.010 --> 01:36:08.843
<v Speaker 3>One of the most interesting things is </v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people tell me that they sleep </v>

2038
01:36:10.891 --> 01:36:11.724
<v Speaker 3>better when they eat more red meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you would never make that </v>

2039
01:36:13.891 --> 01:36:14.730
<v Speaker 3>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2040
01:36:14.770 --> 01:36:17.040
<v Speaker 3>Sounds crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't mention this.</v>

2041
01:36:17.041 --> 01:36:19.920
<v Speaker 3>I hope it goes without saying that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like massive,</v>

2042
01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:23.220
<v Speaker 3>like millet and focus on organic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sourcing.</v>

2043
01:36:23.250 --> 01:36:26.660
<v Speaker 3>Like I would tell people never to touch </v>
<v Speaker 3>an animal food if they don't know,</v>

2044
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:29.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was consciously raised.</v>

2045
01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:30.510
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a caveat.</v>

2046
01:36:30.511 --> 01:36:32.550
<v Speaker 3>Important caveat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm,</v>

2047
01:36:32.730 --> 01:36:36.330
<v Speaker 3>so sleep gets better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the like ravenous hunger,</v>

2048
01:36:36.510 --> 01:36:37.343
<v Speaker 3>like I have patients who can't even go </v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as we've been talking without </v>

2049
01:36:39.691 --> 01:36:41.850
<v Speaker 3>like having a snack or they get hangry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2050
01:36:41.850 --> 01:36:44.340
<v Speaker 3>Like they got like irritable light </v>
<v Speaker 3>headed,</v>

2051
01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:46.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of racing heart.</v>

2052
01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:48.631
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much.</v>

2053
01:36:48.631 --> 01:36:49.560
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is it,</v>

2054
01:36:49.561 --> 01:36:50.394
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're just eating convenience </v>

2055
01:36:52.021 --> 01:36:54.030
<v Speaker 3>food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's a natural response.</v>

2056
01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:57.300
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then sometimes as much more radical.</v>

2057
01:36:57.301 --> 01:37:02.301
<v Speaker 3>So like in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in alleys case within two cycles,</v>

2058
01:37:03.390 --> 01:37:04.223
<v Speaker 3>she was completely symptom free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she went from grossly psychotic and </v>

2059
01:37:09.521 --> 01:37:12.220
<v Speaker 3>suicidal to not only totally symptom </v>
<v Speaker 3>free,</v>

2060
01:37:12.221 --> 01:37:15.370
<v Speaker 3>but now she's like moved through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is moving through,</v>

2061
01:37:15.371 --> 01:37:19.660
<v Speaker 3>I would say a process of awakening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a spiritual shift,</v>

2062
01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:21.640
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's like,</v>

2063
01:37:21.850 --> 01:37:24.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good Braun says like the,</v>

2064
01:37:24.241 --> 01:37:25.074
<v Speaker 3>the wound is where the light enters and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we don't have that consciousness as </v>

2065
01:37:27.461 --> 01:37:31.510
<v Speaker 3>a society because we think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering the wound is where the light,</v>

2066
01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:34.660
<v Speaker 3>it means that grief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pain,</v>

2067
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:35.703
<v Speaker 3>suffering is where you grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's where the real experience of </v>

2068
01:37:40.691 --> 01:37:44.290
<v Speaker 3>being human and where the real contact </v>
<v Speaker 3>with who you are.</v>

2069
01:37:45.010 --> 01:37:45.491
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2070
01:37:45.491 --> 01:37:47.980
<v Speaker 3>so this is true even for something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iowasca,</v>

2071
01:37:47.981 --> 01:37:49.750
<v Speaker 3>like why would anyone ever do something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that?</v>

2072
01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:53.110
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the point is through that experience</v>

2073
01:37:53.111 --> 01:37:56.460
<v Speaker 3>of humbling surrender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you meet yourself,</v>

2074
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.863
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we don't have a consciousness for </v>

2075
01:37:58.231 --> 01:37:59.940
<v Speaker 3>that in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2076
01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:03.990
<v Speaker 3>crying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like literally tears is a symptom in the</v>

2077
01:38:03.991 --> 01:38:05.250
<v Speaker 3>DSM.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2078
01:38:05.251 --> 01:38:09.120
<v Speaker 3>so it's literally a pathological symptom</v>
<v Speaker 3>to cry.</v>

2079
01:38:09.210 --> 01:38:13.950
<v Speaker 3>That is the most basic evidence of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity is that we cry.</v>

2080
01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:16.440
<v Speaker 3>And if we are living in a culture that </v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

2081
01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:20.070
<v Speaker 3>you're sick when you're crying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop doing that.</v>

2082
01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:23.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take this so that you can stop feeling.</v>

2083
01:38:24.270 --> 01:38:26.160
<v Speaker 3>We have a bigger problem on our hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2084
01:38:26.161 --> 01:38:29.940
<v Speaker 3>So I know I can't just sit in my Madison</v>
<v Speaker 3>Avenue Office taking people off of meds.</v>

2085
01:38:29.941 --> 01:38:31.110
<v Speaker 3>And think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2086
01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:32.153
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm changing the world that this is a </v>

2087
01:38:33.511 --> 01:38:38.511
<v Speaker 3>systemic cultural issue that we make no </v>
<v Speaker 3>room for things to fall apart.</v>

2088
01:38:39.090 --> 01:38:42.480
<v Speaker 3>We make no room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that with the Dsm five.</v>

2089
01:38:42.481 --> 01:38:43.314
<v Speaker 3>So like the latest Dsm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they took out something called the </v>

2090
01:38:46.141 --> 01:38:50.790
<v Speaker 3>bereavement clause from the depression </v>
<v Speaker 3>diagnostic category.</v>

2091
01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:54.480
<v Speaker 3>And that means that if you meet criteria</v>
<v Speaker 3>for depression,</v>

2092
01:38:54.481 --> 01:38:57.240
<v Speaker 3>which is what you would imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2093
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:59.370
<v Speaker 3>what the changes in sleep changes in </v>
<v Speaker 3>appetite,</v>

2094
01:38:59.371 --> 01:39:01.080
<v Speaker 3>low mood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poor concentration,</v>

2095
01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopelessness.</v>

2096
01:39:02.850 --> 01:39:05.940
<v Speaker 3>If you meet that criteria it for two </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>

2097
01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:10.440
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter if your kid just died </v>
<v Speaker 3>or your wife,</v>

2098
01:39:10.710 --> 01:39:13.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or like your dad.</v>

2099
01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:15.960
<v Speaker 3>So that's bereavement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2100
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:19.140
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're still a candidate for treatment</v>

2101
01:39:19.330 --> 01:39:23.080
<v Speaker 5>or if you got fired or a few experience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>natural disaster doesn't matter.</v>

2102
01:39:23.110 --> 01:39:25.870
<v Speaker 5>Or if you lost your house in a fire,</v>

2103
01:39:25.950 --> 01:39:27.030
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

2104
01:39:27.210 --> 01:39:29.220
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So some people saw that as like,</v>

2105
01:39:29.221 --> 01:39:30.054
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really a last straw of pathologizing </v>

2106
01:39:32.821 --> 01:39:34.710
<v Speaker 3>normal human experience.</v>

2107
01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:36.013
<v Speaker 5>So there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the issues with these </v>

2108
01:39:37.191 --> 01:39:38.024
<v Speaker 5>disassociative sort of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>chemicals that people get put on cause </v>

2109
01:39:41.181 --> 01:39:42.014
<v Speaker 5>that's like one of the ways to describe </v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people's reaction to ssrs and </v>

2110
01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:48.020
<v Speaker 5>antidepressants is a dis associative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2111
01:39:48.290 --> 01:39:50.210
<v Speaker 5>They have a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can,</v>

2112
01:39:50.211 --> 01:39:51.800
<v Speaker 5>anything can happen in their okay with </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2113
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:53.180
<v Speaker 5>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No worries,</v>

2114
01:39:53.181 --> 01:39:54.014
<v Speaker 5>no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they don't get these highs and lows </v>

2115
01:39:55.850 --> 01:39:56.683
<v Speaker 5>and so because they don't get the lows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't get the rebound and get the </v>

2116
01:39:59.241 --> 01:40:03.830
<v Speaker 5>highs and then also find themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>understand themselves so they can manage</v>

2117
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.903
<v Speaker 5>how low the lows get through the mind </v>
<v Speaker 5>and through your just living in the </v>

2118
01:40:10.521 --> 01:40:12.420
<v Speaker 5>moment and understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2119
01:40:12.530 --> 01:40:13.363
<v Speaker 5>Understanding that there's a just a </v>
<v Speaker 5>natural process of life and you've been </v>

2120
01:40:15.411 --> 01:40:17.660
<v Speaker 5>through it before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So instead of taking a pill,</v>

2121
01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:18.740
<v Speaker 5>just suck it up</v>

2122
01:40:19.010 --> 01:40:21.590
<v Speaker 3>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we don't write like in,</v>

2123
01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.290
<v Speaker 3>in in tribal cultures like men are </v>
<v Speaker 3>initiated,</v>

2124
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2125
01:40:24.890 --> 01:40:26.180
<v Speaker 5>Oh I've got a video,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll show you,</v>

2126
01:40:27.150 --> 01:40:27.983
<v Speaker 5>say really tooth yanked out or you going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to like survive in the wild for can </v>

2127
01:40:32.301 --> 01:40:34.310
<v Speaker 5>circumcision video if you really want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>get crazy,</v>

2128
01:40:34.350 --> 01:40:35.540
<v Speaker 5>my guess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2129
01:40:35.550 --> 01:40:37.400
<v Speaker 5>One wells,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2130
01:40:37.670 --> 01:40:40.280
<v Speaker 5>so we think of ourselves as being lucky </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

2131
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:44.990
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to do that though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I sure I'm not taking responsibility for</v>

2132
01:40:44.991 --> 01:40:48.080
<v Speaker 5>what's in his video as being in any way </v>
<v Speaker 5>related to what I'm talking about.</v>

2133
01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:50.240
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely not,</v>

2134
01:40:51.650 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 5>you wouldn't approve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's</v>

2135
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:56.500
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we were just like,</v>

2136
01:40:56.830 --> 01:41:01.630
<v Speaker 3>we just bb our way through life because </v>
<v Speaker 3>no one is teaching us how to,</v>

2137
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.823
<v Speaker 3>to confront our deepest fears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You like explore the shadow realms and </v>

2138
01:41:08.051 --> 01:41:11.050
<v Speaker 3>integrated into our own power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2139
01:41:11.051 --> 01:41:13.600
<v Speaker 3>We have no understanding of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We make fun of that.</v>

2140
01:41:13.601 --> 01:41:16.390
<v Speaker 3>We think it's like woo weirdness that </v>
<v Speaker 3>like other cultures can,</v>

2141
01:41:16.590 --> 01:41:19.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do in their little tropical islands.</v>

2142
01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:24.840
<v Speaker 3>But what I have found is that taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>people off of Psych meds,</v>

2143
01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:26.313
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow is seeming to serve as like an </v>

2144
01:41:29.861 --> 01:41:33.550
<v Speaker 3>initiation process for like thousands </v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

2145
01:41:33.970 --> 01:41:35.320
<v Speaker 3>So interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2146
01:41:35.321 --> 01:41:36.154
<v Speaker 3>like that you took it because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought it was a good idea and it's so </v>

2147
01:41:38.951 --> 01:41:39.784
<v Speaker 3>challenging to come off it and forces </v>
<v Speaker 3>you to confront a lot of elements of </v>

2148
01:41:43.271 --> 01:41:44.104
<v Speaker 3>your consciousness live differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It forces you to work with your body </v>

2149
01:41:46.871 --> 01:41:47.704
<v Speaker 3>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It forces you to begin to look at why </v>

2150
01:41:49.361 --> 01:41:52.510
<v Speaker 3>you went on them in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a whole nother layer of</v>

2151
01:41:52.511 --> 01:41:53.344
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's being really physically disabling </v>

2152
01:41:54.571 --> 01:41:55.404
<v Speaker 3>in some cases to come off these meds and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really brings you to your knees </v>

2153
01:41:58.841 --> 01:41:59.674
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so a lot of what I think of myself </v>

2154
01:42:01.481 --> 01:42:04.630
<v Speaker 3>as doing is just like a holding space </v>
<v Speaker 3>for that process to happen.</v>

2155
01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:06.333
<v Speaker 3>And then once it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they move through into this like </v>

2156
01:42:09.371 --> 01:42:10.204
<v Speaker 3>awakened stay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the vast majority of my patients </v>

2157
01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:16.210
<v Speaker 3>and you know online course completers go</v>
<v Speaker 3>on to become healers.</v>

2158
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:19.690
<v Speaker 3>Why else would that happen if they will?</v>

2159
01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:22.580
<v Speaker 4>People crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why you're turned to healers,</v>

2160
01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:23.933
<v Speaker 4>but surely a massive blow back from just</v>
<v Speaker 4>conventional psychiatric medicine </v>

2161
01:42:32.101 --> 01:42:34.590
<v Speaker 4>practitioners who are looking at what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're saying and like,</v>

2162
01:42:34.610 --> 01:42:38.250
<v Speaker 4>so you're telling someone all they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do is just stop eating sugar and they</v>

2163
01:42:38.251 --> 01:42:40.680
<v Speaker 4>won't be psychotic anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking crazy.</v>

2164
01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:43.080
<v Speaker 4>I know you're not saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm,</v>

2165
01:42:43.081 --> 01:42:43.914
<v Speaker 4>I'm boiling it down to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying that you took this woman </v>

2166
01:42:46.050 --> 01:42:46.883
<v Speaker 4>and you took her off of processed foods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you made her eat healthy vegetables and </v>

2167
01:42:50.761 --> 01:42:51.594
<v Speaker 4>meat and eggs and healthy fats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coconut oil and avocado oil and detox </v>

2168
01:42:55.951 --> 01:42:59.190
<v Speaker 4>and medication and all the inflammation </v>
<v Speaker 4>went away.</v>

2169
01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:01.550
<v Speaker 4>The problem of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2170
01:43:01.551 --> 01:43:06.551
<v Speaker 4>the insulin spikes and all the blood </v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar spikes that goes away and then the</v>

2171
01:43:06.751 --> 01:43:10.080
<v Speaker 4>body somehow or another comes back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a baseline.</v>

2172
01:43:10.130 --> 01:43:11.510
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2173
01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:14.180
<v Speaker 3>in the New England Journal of Medicine </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently,</v>

2174
01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:16.190
<v Speaker 3>there was a case report,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2175
01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:17.053
<v Speaker 3>37 year old woman who was so psychotic </v>
<v Speaker 3>that her family took out a restraining </v>

2176
01:43:21.351 --> 01:43:22.400
<v Speaker 3>order on her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2177
01:43:22.401 --> 01:43:23.390
<v Speaker 3>Paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>delusional,</v>

2178
01:43:23.391 --> 01:43:24.224
<v Speaker 3>totally psychotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was treated with risperdal and </v>

2179
01:43:26.481 --> 01:43:27.314
<v Speaker 3>Zoloft and anti psychotic and an </v>
<v Speaker 3>antidepressant which did nothing a year </v>

2180
01:43:30.771 --> 01:43:31.604
<v Speaker 3>of this nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Later she was finally diagnosed with </v>

2181
01:43:34.371 --> 01:43:35.790
<v Speaker 3>gluten sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2182
01:43:35.791 --> 01:43:37.070
<v Speaker 3>so wheat sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2183
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:39.680
<v Speaker 3>They put her on a three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is in the hospital.</v>

2184
01:43:39.681 --> 01:43:43.130
<v Speaker 3>This is not like in some quacks office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know in,</v>

2185
01:43:43.131 --> 01:43:44.600
<v Speaker 3>in boulder they,</v>

2186
01:43:44.890 --> 01:43:47.040
<v Speaker 4>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>After bulldog.</v>

2187
01:43:47.650 --> 01:43:49.300
<v Speaker 4>It's one spot though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a spot.</v>

2188
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:51.070
<v Speaker 4>And Sedona,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an incident.</v>

2189
01:43:51.110 --> 01:43:52.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm going actually</v>

2190
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:54.380
<v Speaker 3>next week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't wait to check it out.</v>

2191
01:43:55.190 --> 01:43:56.120
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2192
01:43:56.121 --> 01:43:59.090
<v Speaker 3>So in three months on this strict gluten</v>
<v Speaker 3>free diet,</v>

2193
01:43:59.150 --> 01:44:02.030
<v Speaker 3>she was totally normal again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2194
01:44:02.090 --> 01:44:07.090
<v Speaker 3>So this is not like a wellness fad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are real route drivers,</v>

2195
01:44:07.490 --> 01:44:09.200
<v Speaker 3>but we don't know what it is for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2196
01:44:09.201 --> 01:44:11.540
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be physiologic where it's like,</v>

2197
01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:13.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a similar story about a lifelong</v>

2198
01:44:13.701 --> 01:44:15.830
<v Speaker 3>vegetarian woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is in the published literature,</v>

2199
01:44:16.150 --> 01:44:18.800
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who became psychotically depressed,</v>

2200
01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:23.910
<v Speaker 3>was admitted for Catatonia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Catatonia is like the worst diagnosis in</v>

2201
01:44:25.130 --> 01:44:25.963
<v Speaker 3>psychiatry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2202
01:44:26.630 --> 01:44:30.440
<v Speaker 3>She's basically unresponsive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was so mentally ill.</v>

2203
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:31.303
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They treated her with electric shock </v>

2204
01:44:33.111 --> 01:44:36.620
<v Speaker 3>therapy because the antipsychotics and </v>
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants,</v>

2205
01:44:36.621 --> 01:44:37.730
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they used didn't work.</v>

2206
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.820
<v Speaker 3>Finally she gets transferred to announce</v>
<v Speaker 3>that hospital cause they were like,</v>

2207
01:44:40.821 --> 01:44:41.654
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know what to do with this </v>

2208
01:44:41.811 --> 01:44:44.480
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They check her b 12 level and it's like,</v>

2209
01:44:44.930 --> 01:44:46.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tanked.</v>

2210
01:44:46.850 --> 01:44:48.830
<v Speaker 3>They give her a couple of b 12 </v>
<v Speaker 3>injections.</v>

2211
01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:52.130
<v Speaker 3>And not only is she better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's better than she's been in like</v>

2212
01:44:52.131 --> 01:44:52.964
<v Speaker 3>14 years from a couple of b 12.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so my point is that for her it was </v>

2213
01:44:57.210 --> 01:44:58.730
<v Speaker 3>b12.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For her it was week.</v>

2214
01:44:58.731 --> 01:45:00.290
<v Speaker 3>For someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be blood sugar,</v>

2215
01:45:00.291 --> 01:45:02.180
<v Speaker 3>instability for someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thyroid,</v>

2216
01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:03.253
<v Speaker 3>autoimmune thyroid can make you crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can make you suicidal according to the </v>

2217
01:45:08.061 --> 01:45:09.350
<v Speaker 3>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a theory,</v>

2218
01:45:09.351 --> 01:45:10.184
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever had anybody that you put on </v>

2219
01:45:10.911 --> 01:45:14.740
<v Speaker 3>this diet and they didn't respond,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they stayed psychotic or whatever.</v>

2220
01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:16.693
<v Speaker 3>Here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a long time because I screened for </v>

2221
01:45:21.681 --> 01:45:23.240
<v Speaker 3>readiness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2222
01:45:23.241 --> 01:45:27.860
<v Speaker 3>So I screened for a mindset and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're talking about earlier because</v>

2223
01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:28.723
<v Speaker 3>if you're ready and you believe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd like a whole radical next chapter </v>

2224
01:45:32.871 --> 01:45:35.910
<v Speaker 3>of your life is like forthcoming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I,</v>

2225
01:45:36.050 --> 01:45:38.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm just part of the ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2226
01:45:39.410 --> 01:45:42.920
<v Speaker 3>And it's like using the placebo effect </v>
<v Speaker 3>even,</v>

2227
01:45:43.130 --> 01:45:44.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2228
01:45:44.001 --> 01:45:44.834
<v Speaker 3>I'm very interested in science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is a belief that if you don't </v>

2229
01:45:49.461 --> 01:45:52.760
<v Speaker 3>believe that this is going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything for you and you're a skeptic,</v>

2230
01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:55.070
<v Speaker 3>it won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It won't.</v>

2231
01:45:55.130 --> 01:45:59.210
<v Speaker 3>And I can show you all the science in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world and it won't work for you.</v>

2232
01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:02.510
<v Speaker 3>But the physiological changes of </v>
<v Speaker 3>adjusting your diet,</v>

2233
01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:03.530
<v Speaker 3>those are real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2234
01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:06.890
<v Speaker 3>So like why won't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But your beliefs can even override that.</v>

2235
01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:08.360
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's true.</v>

2236
01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:10.700
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll tell you about another study.</v>

2237
01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:11.743
<v Speaker 3>So these are people like your friends </v>
<v Speaker 3>and millions of others who think they </v>

2238
01:46:15.561 --> 01:46:18.290
<v Speaker 3>are treated to remission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think medication really helped them.</v>

2239
01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:20.090
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>With PROZAC.</v>

2240
01:46:20.450 --> 01:46:21.350
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're like,</v>

2241
01:46:21.351 --> 01:46:22.760
<v Speaker 3>well on Prozac,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2242
01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:23.773
<v Speaker 3>so they're put in this study 12 week </v>
<v Speaker 3>study and they get to either stay with </v>

2243
01:46:27.381 --> 01:46:28.214
<v Speaker 3>their same dose of Prozac that helped </v>
<v Speaker 3>them or they get crossed over to the </v>

2244
01:46:32.361 --> 01:46:34.460
<v Speaker 3>placebo arm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sugar pill arm,</v>

2245
01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:37.370
<v Speaker 3>and they don't know which is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

2246
01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:38.593
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happened interestingly in that </v>

2247
01:46:40.191 --> 01:46:43.070
<v Speaker 3>study is that the time they were crossed</v>
<v Speaker 3>over or not,</v>

2248
01:46:43.670 --> 01:46:44.503
<v Speaker 3>they both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both groups became statistically </v>

2249
01:46:47.781 --> 01:46:49.590
<v Speaker 3>significantly depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2250
01:46:49.591 --> 01:46:52.080
<v Speaker 3>So like Mary takes her 40 milligrams on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tuesday,</v>

2251
01:46:52.290 --> 01:46:56.790
<v Speaker 3>enters the study is still taking her 40 </v>
<v Speaker 3>milligrams like next Thursday.</v>

2252
01:46:56.791 --> 01:46:57.624
<v Speaker 3>But now all of a sudden she's acutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>depressed just because of the </v>

2253
01:46:59.341 --> 01:47:02.160
<v Speaker 3>possibility that she might have gotten </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sugar pill.</v>

2254
01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:03.173
<v Speaker 3>That's called the no cbo effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the no cbo effect is the impact of </v>

2255
01:47:06.991 --> 01:47:07.824
<v Speaker 3>fear or negative beliefs that limit your</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to respond to a given </v>

2256
01:47:11.341 --> 01:47:13.350
<v Speaker 3>intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>

2257
01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:18.450
<v Speaker 3>It's more important than anything we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually doing is what you believe</v>

2258
01:47:19.340 --> 01:47:20.173
<v Speaker 5>convinces you that Krispy Kreme donuts </v>
<v Speaker 5>and could fix you literally might be </v>

2259
01:47:27.001 --> 01:47:27.834
<v Speaker 5>some truth to that.</v>

2260
01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:29.060
<v Speaker 3>There could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2261
01:47:29.061 --> 01:47:29.894
<v Speaker 3>and I will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have Kuwait on some level like </v>

2262
01:47:31.531 --> 01:47:32.364
<v Speaker 3>psych meds with Krispy Kreme donuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there are some people who are going </v>

2263
01:47:34.401 --> 01:47:35.460
<v Speaker 3>to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2264
01:47:35.461 --> 01:47:36.810
<v Speaker 3>that really helped me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2265
01:47:36.811 --> 01:47:38.880
<v Speaker 3>so this Guy Irving Kirsch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2266
01:47:38.910 --> 01:47:42.600
<v Speaker 3>He's a psychologist who's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's like a placebo effect expert.</v>

2267
01:47:42.601 --> 01:47:43.434
<v Speaker 3>Arguably what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he identified was that when you </v>

2268
01:47:46.171 --> 01:47:49.470
<v Speaker 3>control for what's called the active </v>
<v Speaker 3>placebo effect,</v>

2269
01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:53.100
<v Speaker 3>which is what happens when you feel the </v>
<v Speaker 3>side effects,</v>

2270
01:47:53.101 --> 01:47:53.934
<v Speaker 3>you've been warned about of a given </v>
<v Speaker 3>medication and then you feel the </v>

2271
01:47:58.591 --> 01:48:01.620
<v Speaker 3>medication is working and then it </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually works,</v>

2272
01:48:01.770 --> 01:48:02.603
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you control for the active </v>

2273
01:48:04.230 --> 01:48:08.130
<v Speaker 3>placebo effect by giving people in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a trial,</v>

2274
01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:09.390
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2275
01:48:09.391 --> 01:48:12.290
<v Speaker 3>antidepressant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then also a medication like atrazine</v>

2276
01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:14.820
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that has very similar side effects,</v>

2277
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:16.680
<v Speaker 3>dry mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>headache,</v>

2278
01:48:16.681 --> 01:48:17.670
<v Speaker 3>constipation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of thing.</v>

2279
01:48:18.330 --> 01:48:19.163
<v Speaker 3>There's no difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what he showed is that there is no </v>

2280
01:48:21.931 --> 01:48:22.764
<v Speaker 3>statistically significant effect of </v>
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants above and beyond </v>

2281
01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:27.600
<v Speaker 3>placebo.</v>

2282
01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:31.440
<v Speaker 3>And that the reason that people believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're working and they are right,</v>

2283
01:48:31.441 --> 01:48:36.441
<v Speaker 3>so they believe it and then they do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they feel a shift.</v>

2284
01:48:36.570 --> 01:48:40.680
<v Speaker 3>They feel a change and they've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>educated by commercials and their doctor</v>

2285
01:48:40.690 --> 01:48:44.070
<v Speaker 3>maybe about these side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they start to say,</v>

2286
01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:48.480
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my chemical imbalances being adjusted.</v>

2287
01:48:48.490 --> 01:48:49.950
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>

2288
01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:52.350
<v Speaker 3>it's subtle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is not just in psychiatry.</v>

2289
01:48:52.351 --> 01:48:55.980
<v Speaker 3>It's really relevant to psychiatry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's true in surgery.</v>

2290
01:48:56.220 --> 01:48:57.053
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do sham operations in orthopedics </v>

2291
01:48:58.771 --> 01:49:00.720
<v Speaker 3>and it's true in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in even,</v>

2292
01:49:00.721 --> 01:49:02.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2293
01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:03.780
<v Speaker 3>pain management,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2294
01:49:03.781 --> 01:49:07.840
<v Speaker 3>that the placebo effect is so real and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like you're being fooled.</v>

2295
01:49:07.841 --> 01:49:08.581
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2296
01:49:08.581 --> 01:49:10.260
<v Speaker 3>like in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my training,</v>

2297
01:49:10.261 --> 01:49:12.120
<v Speaker 3>I was taught to dismiss the placebo </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>

2298
01:49:12.121 --> 01:49:14.430
<v Speaker 3>Like some nuisance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to control for it,</v>

2299
01:49:14.431 --> 01:49:15.810
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we could,</v>

2300
01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:18.450
<v Speaker 3>Bruce Lipton said this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if we could harness this,</v>

2301
01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:22.140
<v Speaker 3>we would have a side effect free </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine for everyone,</v>

2302
01:49:22.410 --> 01:49:24.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't study it.</v>

2303
01:49:24.031 --> 01:49:24.864
<v Speaker 3>We don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we just assume it's like people </v>

2304
01:49:27.451 --> 01:49:28.650
<v Speaker 3>being tricked or something,</v>

2305
01:49:28.690 --> 01:49:30.950
<v Speaker 5>they go onto placebo effects.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fairly Limited.</v>

2306
01:49:30.951 --> 01:49:31.910
<v Speaker 5>Like nothing really truly</v>

2307
01:49:32.170 --> 01:49:33.520
<v Speaker 3>miraculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

2308
01:49:33.550 --> 01:49:34.383
<v Speaker 3>It's about 30%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's exactly the efficacy of </v>

2309
01:49:37.571 --> 01:49:39.790
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is around 30%.</v>

2310
01:49:41.410 --> 01:49:46.410
<v Speaker 5>So there was a study once that was done </v>
<v Speaker 5>on some,</v>

2311
01:49:47.710 --> 01:49:48.543
<v Speaker 5>a kid</v>

2312
01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:52.610
<v Speaker 4>who had some horrible war disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2313
01:49:52.630 --> 01:49:53.463
<v Speaker 4>where they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was incurable and it was like </v>

2314
01:49:55.121 --> 01:49:57.490
<v Speaker 4>spreading all over their body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>over their arm,</v>

2315
01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:58.593
<v Speaker 4>do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this study?</v>

2316
01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:04.380
<v Speaker 4>And they gave this kid some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>placebo and it completely cleared it up.</v>

2317
01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:07.700
<v Speaker 4>And that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should know that.</v>

2318
01:50:07.870 --> 01:50:10.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when they found out that it was</v>

2319
01:50:10.361 --> 01:50:11.194
<v Speaker 4>a placebo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it became a problem and I think it </v>

2320
01:50:12.341 --> 01:50:13.610
<v Speaker 4>came back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2321
01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:14.440
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2322
01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:15.273
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that there's something going on </v>

2323
01:50:17.921 --> 01:50:19.840
<v Speaker 4>with the mind and the body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2324
01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:22.420
<v Speaker 4>And that's what the placebo effect is </v>
<v Speaker 4>demonstrating.</v>

2325
01:50:22.510 --> 01:50:25.500
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this is unharnessed and this is uh,</v>

2326
01:50:25.570 --> 01:50:26.403
<v Speaker 4>untrained and this is very different </v>
<v Speaker 4>than what's going on with the mind with </v>

2327
01:50:29.321 --> 01:50:30.154
<v Speaker 4>meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is harnessed and trained and </v>

2328
01:50:32.201 --> 01:50:37.201
<v Speaker 4>focused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So your thought is that this mine factor</v>

2329
01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:40.590
<v Speaker 4>is not just an inconvenience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not just a,</v>

2330
01:50:40.591 --> 01:50:41.424
<v Speaker 4>a variable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but maybe one of the most crucial </v>

2331
01:50:43.271 --> 01:50:45.310
<v Speaker 4>aspects to overall health,</v>

2332
01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:48.230
<v Speaker 2>if not the most crucial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2333
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:49.303
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conventional medicine is interested in </v>

2334
01:50:50.601 --> 01:50:51.434
<v Speaker 2>this to some extent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now noticing that what people believe </v>

2335
01:50:54.861 --> 01:50:57.740
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll lose less blood in surgery if you</v>

2336
01:50:57.741 --> 01:51:01.400
<v Speaker 2>visualize losing less blood and surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that actually happens.</v>

2337
01:51:01.401 --> 01:51:05.300
<v Speaker 2>How can you control the physiologic </v>
<v Speaker 2>activity of your body?</v>

2338
01:51:05.301 --> 01:51:06.890
<v Speaker 2>But you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>

2339
01:51:06.891 --> 01:51:09.170
<v Speaker 2>Like we have soft proof that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2340
01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:10.033
<v Speaker 2>it's a study on power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did they convince them that they're </v>

2341
01:51:12.321 --> 01:51:13.730
<v Speaker 2>gonna lose last broad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They met it.</v>

2342
01:51:13.731 --> 01:51:16.850
<v Speaker 2>They visualize it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they meditate on it and visualize losing</v>

2343
01:51:16.851 --> 01:51:17.684
<v Speaker 2>less blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have one group that says you're </v>

2344
01:51:19.431 --> 01:51:23.840
<v Speaker 2>going to do a visualization where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like visualize your body letting go</v>

2345
01:51:23.841 --> 01:51:26.120
<v Speaker 2>of less blood after the surgery or </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the surgery.</v>

2346
01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:27.133
<v Speaker 2>And then the other group does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does their thing know if you have one </v>

2347
01:51:28.941 --> 01:51:29.691
<v Speaker 2>group you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2348
01:51:29.691 --> 01:51:31.670
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna Spray like a fountain.</v>

2349
01:51:32.010 --> 01:51:32.843
<v Speaker 2>He'll look a broken fire hydrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to just big gush over the </v>

2350
01:51:35.601 --> 01:51:37.540
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be a sprinkler.</v>

2351
01:51:37.610 --> 01:51:39.290
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should conduct this study.</v>

2352
01:51:39.291 --> 01:51:40.124
<v Speaker 2>That would be fascinating to see if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>no CBO affects would have it probably </v>

2353
01:51:43.641 --> 01:51:45.350
<v Speaker 2>would they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably what?</v>

2354
01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:45.651
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2355
01:51:45.651 --> 01:51:46.484
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine there's probably a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could mind fuck someone into some </v>

2356
01:51:49.801 --> 01:51:51.080
<v Speaker 2>terrible state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2357
01:51:51.330 --> 01:51:52.163
<v Speaker 2>That so you know where we see this is in</v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer diagnosis is called medical </v>

2358
01:51:55.071 --> 01:51:56.540
<v Speaker 2>hexing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That you know,</v>

2359
01:51:56.541 --> 01:51:59.110
<v Speaker 2>when you are diagnosed with cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your risk of your,</v>

2360
01:51:59.111 --> 01:52:00.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the completion of suicide,</v>

2361
01:52:00.801 --> 01:52:05.801
<v Speaker 2>but also other accidents and your health</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically declines simply because of the</v>

2362
01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:08.600
<v Speaker 2>diagnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why it's considered to be,</v>

2363
01:52:08.601 --> 01:52:10.880
<v Speaker 2>it's like bone pointing or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's Voodoo.</v>

2364
01:52:10.881 --> 01:52:11.714
<v Speaker 2>It's what we've always known that like </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone could put a hex on you and if </v>

2365
01:52:13.791 --> 01:52:15.500
<v Speaker 2>you know that a hex is on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

2366
01:52:15.501 --> 01:52:17.150
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a God damn hex on me.</v>

2367
01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:21.560
<v Speaker 2>That's when you start believing it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it could really cause a huge issue.</v>

2368
01:52:21.620 --> 01:52:23.060
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I,</v>

2369
01:52:23.061 --> 01:52:23.894
<v Speaker 2>it has become clear to me is real and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to think about it that way </v>

2370
01:52:26.541 --> 01:52:28.850
<v Speaker 2>because we think medicine is science and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2371
01:52:29.090 --> 01:52:30.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2372
01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:31.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of impenetrable.</v>

2373
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Well you know the hallowed halls of </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>

2374
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:36.380
<v Speaker 2>but it's a religion just like anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

2375
01:52:36.381 --> 01:52:37.161
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nick and Saul is,</v>

2376
01:52:37.161 --> 01:52:37.994
<v Speaker 2>my mentor said it's the last really </v>
<v Speaker 2>unrecognized religion on the planet is </v>

2377
01:52:41.691 --> 01:52:42.524
<v Speaker 2>medicine and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have special language and we were </v>

2378
01:52:44.301 --> 01:52:46.280
<v Speaker 2>costumes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's initiatory</v>

2379
01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:47.840
<v Speaker 3>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about the hazing process</v>

2380
01:52:48.730 --> 01:52:49.563
<v Speaker 5>real in a lot of aspects like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>medicine involved in treating a </v>

2381
01:52:53.531 --> 01:52:55.690
<v Speaker 5>bacterial infection,</v>
<v Speaker 5>antibiotics,</v>

2382
01:52:56.070 --> 01:52:58.570
<v Speaker 5>medicine involved in healing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a broken arm.</v>

2383
01:52:58.870 --> 01:52:59.411
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

2384
01:52:59.411 --> 01:53:00.244
<v Speaker 5>there's real stuff there too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Next is a whole nother conversation for </v>

2385
01:53:03.971 --> 01:53:05.920
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Emergency medicine.</v>

2386
01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:06.911
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

2387
01:53:06.911 --> 01:53:09.040
<v Speaker 5>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get hit by a bus,</v>

2388
01:53:09.041 --> 01:53:09.874
<v Speaker 5>don't like bring me to my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't pronounce my natural path in her </v>

2389
01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:15.680
<v Speaker 5>is going to love it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2390
01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:17.920
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just go changing my body,</v>

2391
01:53:18.260 --> 01:53:19.870
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for emergencies</v>

2392
01:53:19.870 --> 01:53:22.420
<v Speaker 3>sees that's what conventional medicine </v>
<v Speaker 3>is really designed for.</v>

2393
01:53:22.421 --> 01:53:25.900
<v Speaker 3>We only ran into trouble when we started</v>
<v Speaker 3>extrapolating from acute,</v>

2394
01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:27.153
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>setting medicine into the outpatient </v>

2395
01:53:29.051 --> 01:53:29.540
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2396
01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:32.570
<v Speaker 5>Well also the denial of the aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 5>nutrition.</v>

2397
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:35.450
<v Speaker 5>I did denial the influence of nutrition </v>
<v Speaker 5>like this,</v>

2398
01:53:35.451 --> 01:53:36.284
<v Speaker 5>this idea of the only concentrating on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the medicine and not concentrating on </v>

2399
01:53:39.381 --> 01:53:40.214
<v Speaker 5>what we know to be viable alternatives </v>
<v Speaker 5>and things that can make your body </v>

2400
01:53:43.701 --> 01:53:46.280
<v Speaker 5>healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like not taking that into account seems,</v>

2401
01:53:46.730 --> 01:53:49.970
<v Speaker 5>it seems almost insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like you're going to fix a car.</v>

2402
01:53:49.971 --> 01:53:50.804
<v Speaker 5>Like I hear a banging,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just gonna inflate these fucking </v>

2403
01:53:52.221 --> 01:53:53.510
<v Speaker 5>tires and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2404
01:53:53.650 --> 01:53:54.590
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what about the engine?</v>

2405
01:53:54.591 --> 01:53:57.050
<v Speaker 5>There's a banging in the engine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Should I fix the engine?</v>

2406
01:53:57.051 --> 01:53:57.571
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2407
01:53:57.571 --> 01:53:58.190
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2408
01:53:58.190 --> 01:54:01.030
<v Speaker 5>I just turn off the alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like let's just turn the AC on.</v>

2409
01:54:01.031 --> 01:54:01.864
<v Speaker 5>Like it's almost like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's certain aspects they're looking </v>

2410
01:54:04.731 --> 01:54:09.731
<v Speaker 5>at the aspects of medication and because</v>
<v Speaker 5>of all the aforementioned variables,</v>

2411
01:54:11.211 --> 01:54:14.390
<v Speaker 5>like student loans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the consensus of your peers,</v>

2412
01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:15.493
<v Speaker 5>everybody is in this sort of group </v>
<v Speaker 5>together is all the unspoken word that </v>

2413
01:54:19.131 --> 01:54:20.960
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to criticize the </v>
<v Speaker 5>establishment.</v>

2414
01:54:21.290 --> 01:54:22.820
<v Speaker 5>And you can't really do that because if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you do,</v>

2415
01:54:22.821 --> 01:54:25.790
<v Speaker 5>you're out of a job and all your money </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you spend on God.</v>

2416
01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:29.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

2417
01:54:29.370 --> 01:54:34.370
<v Speaker 3>it's important to remember that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical industry is a business,</v>

2418
01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:36.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>

2419
01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:39.020
<v Speaker 3>when you forget that and you think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're in it to protect your wellbeing,</v>

2420
01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:39.873
<v Speaker 3>help us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

2421
01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:43.830
<v Speaker 3>If you forget that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is easy to do,</v>

2422
01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:45.393
<v Speaker 3>especially because they work with </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctors and we think of doctors says </v>

2423
01:54:49.081 --> 01:54:50.110
<v Speaker 3>priests sale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2424
01:54:50.730 --> 01:54:52.650
<v Speaker 3>If you forget that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can get into trouble.</v>

2425
01:54:52.710 --> 01:54:53.543
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you take their word for </v>

2426
01:54:55.771 --> 01:54:59.080
<v Speaker 3>something you perhaps should be doing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>broader investigation on.</v>

2427
01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:02.040
<v Speaker 3>But if you remember that it's a business</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's very lucrative,</v>

2428
01:55:02.041 --> 01:55:03.180
<v Speaker 3>successful business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2429
01:55:03.181 --> 01:55:04.014
<v Speaker 3>it's the business model of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you'll look with some </v>

2430
01:55:07.561 --> 01:55:11.550
<v Speaker 3>circumspection upon their claims and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their approach.</v>

2431
01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:13.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but our education as doctors is,</v>

2432
01:55:13.890 --> 01:55:17.550
<v Speaker 3>is totally through the lens of </v>
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical model.</v>

2433
01:55:17.551 --> 01:55:18.384
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regulatory agencies famously like the </v>

2434
01:55:20.611 --> 01:55:23.010
<v Speaker 3>FDA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>CDC and industry.</v>

2435
01:55:23.010 --> 01:55:25.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like a revolving door literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2436
01:55:25.711 --> 01:55:28.920
<v Speaker 3>and this is totally available </v>
<v Speaker 3>information on the Internet that they're</v>

2437
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:29.783
<v Speaker 3>all the same people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we really do have the Fox guarding </v>

2438
01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:34.860
<v Speaker 3>the hen house and that's where we get </v>
<v Speaker 3>into trouble.</v>

2439
01:55:34.861 --> 01:55:35.694
<v Speaker 3>If we don't have transparency around uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a true regulatory body that is not </v>

2440
01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 3>fiscally invested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're have a problem,</v>

2441
01:55:44.101 --> 01:55:44.934
<v Speaker 3>especially for presenting this as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>only legitimate course of action for a </v>

2442
01:55:47.851 --> 01:55:49.290
<v Speaker 3>sick patient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2443
01:55:49.291 --> 01:55:50.124
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you can actually as a parent have </v>

2444
01:55:51.931 --> 01:55:55.890
<v Speaker 3>your children taken away from you if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't participate in the model.</v>

2445
01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:57.073
<v Speaker 5>Have there ever been any serious </v>
<v Speaker 5>suggestions that we remove this whole </v>

2446
01:55:59.661 --> 01:56:04.130
<v Speaker 5>ask your doctor commercial aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 5>medicine?</v>

2447
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:05.580
<v Speaker 5>Like it just seems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to my knowledge,</v>

2448
01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:09.230
<v Speaker 5>it seems so crazy that we know how </v>
<v Speaker 5>influential commercials are,</v>

2449
01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:10.093
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there are so influential and </v>

2450
01:56:11.541 --> 01:56:13.280
<v Speaker 5>these are not just fact based </v>
<v Speaker 5>commercials.</v>

2451
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:15.410
<v Speaker 5>They've got cheery music.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go on,</v>

2452
01:56:15.411 --> 01:56:17.510
<v Speaker 5>there's sunshine and butterflies and </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

2453
01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:20.060
<v Speaker 5>And then it just makes you feel like </v>
<v Speaker 5>super happy.</v>

2454
01:56:20.061 --> 01:56:22.370
<v Speaker 5>Like I want to be like these people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're smiling all the time.</v>

2455
01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:26.540
<v Speaker 5>Totally conditioning crazy that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they can do that for drugs.</v>

2456
01:56:26.630 --> 01:56:27.390
<v Speaker 5>But you could argue,</v>

2457
01:56:27.390 --> 01:56:30.840
<v Speaker 3>you write that you're just empowering </v>
<v Speaker 3>patients with knowledge,</v>

2458
01:56:30.930 --> 01:56:31.621
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2459
01:56:31.621 --> 01:56:33.480
<v Speaker 3>to help themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2460
01:56:33.510 --> 01:56:35.970
<v Speaker 3>Like that's why we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're allowing the commercials.</v>

2461
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:37.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause it's your doctor.</v>

2462
01:56:37.421 --> 01:56:40.910
<v Speaker 5>If abilify is going to keep you from </v>
<v Speaker 5>jumping off a bridge or make you do it,</v>

2463
01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:41.833
<v Speaker 5>ask your doctor like had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you said abilify was at one point in </v>

2464
01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:46.460
<v Speaker 5>time?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The most prescribed.</v>

2465
01:56:46.550 --> 01:56:47.383
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Recently it was the number one </v>

2466
01:56:47.901 --> 01:56:49.820
<v Speaker 3>prescription,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was two years ago.</v>

2467
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:51.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>synthroids always up there.</v>

2468
01:56:52.370 --> 01:56:53.900
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2469
01:56:53.901 --> 01:56:56.250
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because it's it,</v>

2470
01:56:56.290 --> 01:56:57.123
<v Speaker 3>there's these trends I guess these </v>
<v Speaker 3>stylistic trends in prescribing that of </v>

2471
01:57:01.341 --> 01:57:02.174
<v Speaker 3>course have no evidence based.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in psychiatry we're really </v>

2472
01:57:04.581 --> 01:57:07.010
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable to that because there isn't a</v>
<v Speaker 3>clear,</v>

2473
01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:08.233
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a to B in terms of presenting symptoms </v>

2474
01:57:10.131 --> 01:57:13.040
<v Speaker 3>and medication recommendation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of a free for all,</v>

2475
01:57:13.041 --> 01:57:15.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can pile on as many or as few as you</v>

2476
01:57:15.861 --> 01:57:16.694
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there are algorithms but they're </v>

2477
01:57:18.561 --> 01:57:19.550
<v Speaker 3>very loose.</v>

2478
01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:20.453
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're trying to say scientology's </v>

2479
01:57:21.210 --> 01:57:23.730
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who said that?</v>

2480
01:57:24.450 --> 01:57:25.860
<v Speaker 5>That's kind of what you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

2481
01:57:26.190 --> 01:57:26.821
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2482
01:57:26.821 --> 01:57:30.640
<v Speaker 5>aren't they like Super Anti Scientology?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember when Tom Cruise was on,</v>

2483
01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:33.690
<v Speaker 5>what's his face?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's that dude's name?</v>

2484
01:57:34.350 --> 01:57:36.330
<v Speaker 5>The Dude's name?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Good Morning America guy.</v>

2485
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:39.830
<v Speaker 5>He nail our Matt Lauer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Matt,</v>

2486
01:57:40.690 --> 01:57:41.523
<v Speaker 5>you're Glib.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Matt.</v>

2487
01:57:41.530 --> 01:57:42.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's been on out,</v>

2488
01:57:42.210 --> 01:57:44.190
<v Speaker 5>but an oprah who was one who was in </v>
<v Speaker 5>love.</v>

2489
01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:45.293
<v Speaker 5>He jumped off hand couch and he was in </v>
<v Speaker 5>love like no straight man who's ever </v>

2490
01:57:48.211 --> 01:57:53.211
<v Speaker 5>lived on the face of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's his love.</v>

2491
01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:57.960
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but back then I was into it.</v>

2492
01:57:58.270 --> 01:57:59.700
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but no,</v>

2493
01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:00.593
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he was saying that on the Good </v>

2494
01:58:03.001 --> 01:58:03.834
<v Speaker 5>Morning America show with Matt Lauer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was essentially just saying what </v>

2495
01:58:06.571 --> 01:58:10.530
<v Speaker 5>scientology has always said.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you go down sunset or Hollywood,</v>

2496
01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:13.960
<v Speaker 5>where's the psychiatry kills center?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2497
01:58:13.961 --> 01:58:14.860
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2498
01:58:14.980 --> 01:58:15.813
<v Speaker 5>I think it's on sunset.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's some part of Hollywood people </v>

2499
01:58:19.571 --> 01:58:22.370
<v Speaker 5>with like electro shock helmets on like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

2500
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:24.910
<v Speaker 5>like it's like psychiatry kills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2501
01:58:24.911 --> 01:58:26.950
<v Speaker 5>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a fucking scientology center.</v>

2502
01:58:27.310 --> 01:58:28.330
<v Speaker 5>If you go in there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

2503
01:58:28.331 --> 01:58:29.164
<v Speaker 5>you don't need scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need to hold onto these cans that </v>

2504
01:58:31.871 --> 01:58:34.510
<v Speaker 5>are attached to the meter and we got to </v>
<v Speaker 5>find out what's ticking,</v>

2505
01:58:35.110 --> 01:58:35.943
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they start manipulating your </v>

2506
01:58:37.601 --> 01:58:40.510
<v Speaker 5>beliefs and that in turn helps you feel </v>
<v Speaker 5>better.</v>

2507
01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:42.430
<v Speaker 5>So there some sort of a correlation</v>

2508
01:58:42.430 --> 01:58:44.350
<v Speaker 4>between the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2509
01:58:44.380 --> 01:58:45.160
<v Speaker 4>getting out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2510
01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:45.993
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a way like they're almost like not </v>

2511
01:58:47.350 --> 01:58:49.210
<v Speaker 4>totally misguided in their efforts.</v>

2512
01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:50.331
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2513
01:58:50.331 --> 01:58:52.870
<v Speaker 3>And I would say an important difference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2514
01:58:52.880 --> 01:58:55.100
<v Speaker 3>in my perspective perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>

2515
01:58:55.101 --> 01:58:57.240
<v Speaker 3>is that I believe in like individually</v>

2516
01:58:57.880 --> 01:58:58.713
<v Speaker 4>also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not asking for 10% of all their </v>

2517
01:58:59.821 --> 01:59:04.050
<v Speaker 4>income and you don't require two and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>half hours of study every night.</v>

2518
01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:04.903
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2519
01:59:05.220 --> 01:59:05.731
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2520
01:59:05.731 --> 01:59:07.410
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So hopefully more differences than that,</v>

2521
01:59:07.650 --> 01:59:08.490
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

2522
01:59:08.491 --> 01:59:09.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2523
01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:14.250
<v Speaker 3>if you're a subsuming someone into a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say cult culture.</v>

2524
01:59:14.251 --> 01:59:15.150
<v Speaker 3>How about a culture?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2525
01:59:15.151 --> 01:59:15.984
<v Speaker 3>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just pause before you say the chair </v>

2526
01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:20.070
<v Speaker 3>called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2527
01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:23.970
<v Speaker 3>Then you're just transferring </v>
<v Speaker 3>dependence,</v>

2528
01:59:23.971 --> 01:59:25.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from one model to the next.</v>

2529
01:59:25.950 --> 01:59:26.783
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of my bag is to really become </v>

2530
01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:30.263
<v Speaker 3>people back there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their power through a methodology </v>

2531
01:59:32.011 --> 01:59:33.150
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2532
01:59:33.151 --> 01:59:34.380
<v Speaker 3>their own alone</v>

2533
01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:39.040
<v Speaker 4>that highlights why that stuff works for</v>
<v Speaker 4>people and why a lot of different things</v>

2534
01:59:39.041 --> 01:59:39.874
<v Speaker 4>work for people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of different kinds of religions </v>

2535
01:59:40.991 --> 01:59:41.824
<v Speaker 4>and unfortunately a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 4>cults and a lot of different ideologies </v>

2536
01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:46.960
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of different mindsets do work </v>
<v Speaker 4>for people.</v>

2537
01:59:46.961 --> 01:59:49.660
<v Speaker 4>Even fucking crossfit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a great article that I've read</v>

2538
01:59:49.661 --> 01:59:53.050
<v Speaker 4>about equating crossfit to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2539
01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:56.140
<v Speaker 4>the fact that people do not have these </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious groups,</v>

2540
01:59:56.141 --> 01:59:56.974
<v Speaker 4>they don't have these social bonding </v>
<v Speaker 4>groups because they're not going to </v>

2541
01:59:58.661 --> 01:59:59.494
<v Speaker 4>church anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now they're going to this gym and </v>

2542
02:00:00.670 --> 02:00:03.220
<v Speaker 4>they'll like a lot of them literally </v>
<v Speaker 4>call the gym church.</v>

2543
02:00:03.490 --> 02:00:04.360
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2544
02:00:04.650 --> 02:00:08.730
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard of the rat park studies </v>
<v Speaker 3>rat park rat?</v>

2545
02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:11.790
<v Speaker 3>Like the rodent?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does which studies on what?</v>

2546
02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:12.893
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are these Canadian studies that </v>

2547
02:00:15.181 --> 02:00:17.730
<v Speaker 3>basically looked at the addictive model </v>
<v Speaker 3>of cocaine,</v>

2548
02:00:17.731 --> 02:00:19.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like you put,</v>

2549
02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:20.393
<v Speaker 3>we know right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you put a rat in a cage by </v>

2550
02:00:22.741 --> 02:00:25.680
<v Speaker 3>itself and you give it the choice of </v>
<v Speaker 3>water or cook or cocaine,</v>

2551
02:00:25.820 --> 02:00:27.720
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to drink the cocaine until it</v>

2552
02:00:27.721 --> 02:00:28.770
<v Speaker 3>dies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2553
02:00:28.771 --> 02:00:29.361
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least,</v>

2554
02:00:29.361 --> 02:00:30.191
<v Speaker 3>but then these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2555
02:00:30.191 --> 02:00:32.040
<v Speaker 3>So then these researchers were basically</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2556
02:00:32.220 --> 02:00:32.851
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold on a minute.</v>

2557
02:00:32.851 --> 02:00:35.010
<v Speaker 3>That's like totally a natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment for right to be.</v>

2558
02:00:35.011 --> 02:00:35.844
<v Speaker 3>And so if we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if we like put it in rat heaven </v>

2559
02:00:38.191 --> 02:00:39.024
<v Speaker 3>where it can like have sex with the rats</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hang out and have like a community </v>

2560
02:00:42.241 --> 02:00:44.640
<v Speaker 3>and there's things to play with and </v>
<v Speaker 3>little wheels and whatever.</v>

2561
02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:45.990
<v Speaker 3>Then what happens?</v>

2562
02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:50.070
<v Speaker 3>And if you give them cocaine or water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't touch the cocaine and you can</v>

2563
02:00:50.071 --> 02:00:54.570
<v Speaker 3>even addict them in isolation and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>will voluntarily detox in Rad Heaven,</v>

2564
02:00:54.770 --> 02:00:55.870
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2565
02:00:56.230 --> 02:00:57.450
<v Speaker 3>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2566
02:00:57.630 --> 02:01:01.860
<v Speaker 3>It means that we fundamentally need </v>
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

2567
02:01:01.890 --> 02:01:02.723
<v Speaker 3>Like we need each other like it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we don't have that as a part of the </v>

2568
02:01:06.841 --> 02:01:08.790
<v Speaker 3>fabric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We live in boxes.</v>

2569
02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:12.090
<v Speaker 3>We don't know our neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we don't have communities anymore.</v>

2570
02:01:12.540 --> 02:01:15.810
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so any time we have the opportunity,</v>

2571
02:01:15.811 --> 02:01:19.890
<v Speaker 3>whether through aa or crossfit to to </v>
<v Speaker 3>plug into a community,</v>

2572
02:01:19.891 --> 02:01:24.650
<v Speaker 3>we fixed something inside ourselves so </v>
<v Speaker 3>we have less of a vulnerability to,</v>

2573
02:01:24.651 --> 02:01:26.610
<v Speaker 3>to abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2574
02:01:26.611 --> 02:01:30.270
<v Speaker 3>the effects of a substance like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in her,</v>

2575
02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:31.313
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have the rat park studies so </v>

2576
02:01:32.641 --> 02:01:33.474
<v Speaker 4>important because so many people will </v>
<v Speaker 4>cite that as evidenced that cocaine is </v>

2577
02:01:36.601 --> 02:01:39.620
<v Speaker 4>so incredibly addictive when they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they find out about this,</v>

2578
02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 4>because</v>

2579
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:42.780
<v Speaker 5>this is a different variation on that </v>
<v Speaker 5>study and they,</v>

2580
02:01:42.781 --> 02:01:43.250
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2581
02:01:43.250 --> 02:01:44.090
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2582
02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:46.230
<v Speaker 5>well I'm in a rat park.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2583
02:01:46.370 --> 02:01:49.340
<v Speaker 5>The context matters me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're kind of in a rat park every day.</v>

2584
02:01:49.341 --> 02:01:52.670
<v Speaker 5>If you're in a cubicle environment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in your car in traffic,</v>

2585
02:01:52.671 --> 02:01:54.740
<v Speaker 5>or you're on the bus and no one's </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking to anybody,</v>

2586
02:01:54.820 --> 02:01:55.653
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in your little cubicle by </v>

2587
02:01:56.421 --> 02:01:57.400
<v Speaker 5>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2588
02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:59.270
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then there's shared suffering that's</v>

2589
02:01:59.271 --> 02:02:01.970
<v Speaker 5>coming from things like crossfit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have these,</v>

2590
02:02:01.990 --> 02:02:03.890
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these moments are you bonding together.</v>

2591
02:02:03.891 --> 02:02:04.790
<v Speaker 5>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you guys are,</v>

2592
02:02:04.791 --> 02:02:06.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in the trenches,</v>

2593
02:02:06.170 --> 02:02:07.040
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2594
02:02:07.250 --> 02:02:08.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something,</v>

2595
02:02:09.110 --> 02:02:12.530
<v Speaker 5>there's something to yoga class like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that people get all sot nom nom.</v>

2596
02:02:12.531 --> 02:02:14.990
<v Speaker 5>I stay on you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a lot of that.</v>

2597
02:02:15.050 --> 02:02:17.690
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of struggles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard.</v>

2598
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:19.190
<v Speaker 5>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2599
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:20.263
<v Speaker 5>yoga is really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's part of what's good about it </v>

2600
02:02:22.431 --> 02:02:25.100
<v Speaker 5>is that we need,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we need hard things.</v>

2601
02:02:25.550 --> 02:02:26.383
<v Speaker 5>I think your body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're just constantly nerfed and </v>

2602
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:30.103
<v Speaker 5>everything's soft and everything's a f a</v>
<v Speaker 5>free ride and there's no ops or downs </v>

2603
02:02:33.651 --> 02:02:36.290
<v Speaker 5>and everything's middle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what is that?</v>

2604
02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:38.360
<v Speaker 5>That's not a human,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not live.</v>

2605
02:02:38.990 --> 02:02:39.823
<v Speaker 5>It's not what you're designed for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like when you're having a difficult </v>

2606
02:02:42.951 --> 02:02:45.140
<v Speaker 5>window in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2607
02:02:45.141 --> 02:02:47.570
<v Speaker 5>and maybe you know why,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you had a loss.</v>

2608
02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:51.260
<v Speaker 5>I mean you don't know why and things are</v>
<v Speaker 5>just off,</v>

2609
02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:52.393
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like either you have a consciousness </v>

2610
02:02:53.991 --> 02:02:56.480
<v Speaker 5>that says there's something here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2611
02:02:56.481 --> 02:02:58.280
<v Speaker 5>there's something to this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's some meaning to this.</v>

2612
02:02:58.281 --> 02:03:00.800
<v Speaker 5>I got to look deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to pay attention to things.</v>

2613
02:03:00.801 --> 02:03:03.170
<v Speaker 5>I got to rebalance in different,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to up my game,</v>

2614
02:03:03.171 --> 02:03:04.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>self care.</v>

2615
02:03:04.970 --> 02:03:06.830
<v Speaker 5>Or you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this sucks.</v>

2616
02:03:06.831 --> 02:03:07.664
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to feel this way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there are thousands of prescribers </v>

2617
02:03:10.371 --> 02:03:12.350
<v Speaker 5>like happy to open their door to you.</v>

2618
02:03:12.710 --> 02:03:14.930
<v Speaker 5>So that is really the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2619
02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:15.973
<v Speaker 5>The real problem is that there's so many</v>
<v Speaker 5>different options other than what's </v>

2620
02:03:18.021 --> 02:03:18.854
<v Speaker 5>going to make you healthy and there's so</v>
<v Speaker 5>many different ways to just numb this </v>

2621
02:03:22.401 --> 02:03:24.780
<v Speaker 5>whole experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just numb it all down.</v>

2622
02:03:25.100 --> 02:03:27.290
<v Speaker 5>Like let's put some ice on a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be fine.</v>

2623
02:03:27.590 --> 02:03:29.750
<v Speaker 5>Let's numb this whole thing down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2624
02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:33.080
<v Speaker 5>I have been of the opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially over the last few years,</v>

2625
02:03:33.081 --> 02:03:36.920
<v Speaker 5>I've really focused on this heavily and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I've talked about it maybe too much,</v>

2626
02:03:37.310 --> 02:03:38.143
<v Speaker 5>but I think people need to struggle in </v>
<v Speaker 5>order to appreciate how nice things are </v>

2627
02:03:44.450 --> 02:03:49.070
<v Speaker 5>and also to mitigate the effects of </v>
<v Speaker 5>actual bad things that happen to you.</v>

2628
02:03:49.190 --> 02:03:52.400
<v Speaker 5>If you can do difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hard things on a daily basis,</v>

2629
02:03:52.401 --> 02:03:54.350
<v Speaker 5>on a regular basis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2630
02:03:54.351 --> 02:03:58.250
<v Speaker 5>whatever your schedule allows for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But whether it's martial arts or whether</v>

2631
02:03:58.251 --> 02:04:00.680
<v Speaker 5>it's yoga or whether it difficult </v>
<v Speaker 5>struggle,</v>

2632
02:04:00.740 --> 02:04:02.810
<v Speaker 5>physical struggles where you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>test yourself.</v>

2633
02:04:02.830 --> 02:04:04.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have to pull through.</v>

2634
02:04:04.011 --> 02:04:06.980
<v Speaker 5>You have to have discipline and resolve </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's hard to do.</v>

2635
02:04:07.190 --> 02:04:08.023
<v Speaker 5>When you get through that you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you develop that muscle and that </v>

2636
02:04:11.271 --> 02:04:14.120
<v Speaker 5>understanding of struggle and believe it</v>
<v Speaker 5>or not,</v>

2637
02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:15.770
<v Speaker 5>this is where it's going to seem really </v>
<v Speaker 5>weird.</v>

2638
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:16.663
<v Speaker 5>The struggle that you get in a yoga </v>
<v Speaker 5>class is so much harder than the </v>

2639
02:04:19.971 --> 02:04:24.430
<v Speaker 5>struggle that you'll ever experience </v>
<v Speaker 5>outside of that make any sense.</v>

2640
02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:24.741
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2641
02:04:24.741 --> 02:04:26.780
<v Speaker 5>you're going to work out like this is </v>
<v Speaker 5>just like,</v>

2642
02:04:26.900 --> 02:04:28.310
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not spin class,</v>

2643
02:04:28.311 --> 02:04:29.144
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is something like very intense and </v>

2644
02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:35.960
<v Speaker 5>not that spin class I'm all about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So second spin are too,</v>

2645
02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's a</v>

2646
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:40.260
<v Speaker 2>bad example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I should say is it's not like going</v>

2647
02:04:40.261 --> 02:04:41.094
<v Speaker 2>to the gym and doing like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a simple round of like calisthenics or </v>

2648
02:04:44.421 --> 02:04:48.540
<v Speaker 2>exercise or your discomfort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real serious discomfort,</v>

2649
02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:49.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where you want to quit,</v>

2650
02:04:49.890 --> 02:04:51.540
<v Speaker 2>you want to stop and you have to push </v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

2651
02:04:51.810 --> 02:04:55.740
<v Speaker 2>And that intense focus on difficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

2652
02:04:56.010 --> 02:04:59.430
<v Speaker 2>it makes life more bearable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes more enjoyable.</v>

2653
02:04:59.790 --> 02:05:02.220
<v Speaker 2>My awakening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

2654
02:05:02.250 --> 02:05:05.550
<v Speaker 2>began when I gave birth for the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

2655
02:05:05.790 --> 02:05:06.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2656
02:05:06.900 --> 02:05:10.350
<v Speaker 2>And I had a natural birth and she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a bathtub.</v>

2657
02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:11.193
<v Speaker 2>Did you get crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the second time I did a birthing </v>

2658
02:05:12.721 --> 02:05:14.430
<v Speaker 2>center the first time and second time I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had a home birth.</v>

2659
02:05:14.660 --> 02:05:16.700
<v Speaker 2>Why'd you do that though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if there was anything wrong?</v>

2660
02:05:16.701 --> 02:05:19.080
<v Speaker 2>I need to get to the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2661
02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:22.080
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because my first birth </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was still in the matrix,</v>

2662
02:05:22.081 --> 02:05:22.914
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I was still eating Mcdonald's </v>

2663
02:05:24.451 --> 02:05:25.284
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prescribing and you liked that kid less </v>

2664
02:05:27.541 --> 02:05:28.374
<v Speaker 2>than the second code.</v>

2665
02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:31.470
<v Speaker 2>You have the matrix baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally.</v>

2666
02:05:31.471 --> 02:05:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Then it meanwhile she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say age.</v>

2667
02:05:34.050 --> 02:05:35.790
<v Speaker 2>She had to compensate for all my dark </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>

2668
02:05:36.180 --> 02:05:37.013
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I actually had a natural birth </v>

2669
02:05:39.180 --> 02:05:43.920
<v Speaker 2>because of the science because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like in this real like no,</v>

2670
02:05:43.921 --> 02:05:46.650
<v Speaker 2>it all place in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2671
02:05:46.670 --> 02:05:47.820
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not,</v>

2672
02:05:47.821 --> 02:05:52.821
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to move past that but I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>this ob at the time and I was like,</v>

2673
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:55.830
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't know what she's talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

2674
02:05:56.190 --> 02:05:59.520
<v Speaker 2>And I researched like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does the evidence show ob?</v>

2675
02:05:59.521 --> 02:06:00.354
<v Speaker 2>It's actually like psychiatry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only about 30% of obstetrical practices </v>

2676
02:06:03.301 --> 02:06:05.430
<v Speaker 2>are evidence based and the rest is </v>
<v Speaker 2>consensus.</v>

2677
02:06:05.670 --> 02:06:06.503
<v Speaker 2>Like the rest is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just doing it because they're </v>

2678
02:06:07.501 --> 02:06:10.380
<v Speaker 2>doing it like the cords wrapped around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the baby.</v>

2679
02:06:10.850 --> 02:06:11.880
<v Speaker 2>Dang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if nothing,</v>

2680
02:06:11.881 --> 02:06:12.714
<v Speaker 2>we've been doing this since the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of time and if you died since </v>

2681
02:06:15.091 --> 02:06:17.070
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of time because of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

2682
02:06:17.070 --> 02:06:20.610
<v Speaker 2>So we actually have a home birth versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>hospital birth data,</v>

2683
02:06:20.850 --> 02:06:23.270
<v Speaker 2>which it should be totally unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2684
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:27.080
<v Speaker 2>But we actually have it at this point to</v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstrate that that's like patent.</v>

2685
02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:29.070
<v Speaker 2>It's fear mongering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like patently false.</v>

2686
02:06:29.071 --> 02:06:31.170
<v Speaker 2>People do get choked by a biblical </v>
<v Speaker 2>courts,</v>

2687
02:06:31.171 --> 02:06:33.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2688
02:06:33.300 --> 02:06:35.340
<v Speaker 2>Certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything is possible.</v>

2689
02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:38.660
<v Speaker 2>Of course that's going down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the truth is that when you,</v>

2690
02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:42.480
<v Speaker 2>when you researched the interventions </v>
<v Speaker 2>you will find,</v>

2691
02:06:42.540 --> 02:06:43.373
<v Speaker 2>so I had a natural birth because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>research that I did on the </v>

2692
02:06:46.231 --> 02:06:48.210
<v Speaker 2>interventions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like fetal monitoring,</v>

2693
02:06:48.211 --> 02:06:49.260
<v Speaker 2>a PCR,</v>
<v Speaker 2>atomy,</v>

2694
02:06:49.590 --> 02:06:52.570
<v Speaker 2>even ultrasound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let alone csection,</v>

2695
02:06:53.450 --> 02:06:55.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics during delivery,</v>

2696
02:06:55.171 --> 02:06:56.004
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I found was that there wasn't </v>

2697
02:06:57.301 --> 02:06:58.134
<v Speaker 2>science to support them and actually the</v>
<v Speaker 2>science suggests that they should be </v>

2698
02:06:59.851 --> 02:07:00.684
<v Speaker 2>abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I was left with was the code of </v>

2699
02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:06.060
<v Speaker 2>silence with Josh should be abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These interventions.</v>

2700
02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:07.740
<v Speaker 2>C-Sections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2701
02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:08.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the consensus,</v>

2702
02:07:08.851 --> 02:07:10.780
<v Speaker 2>even the WHO,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2703
02:07:10.830 --> 02:07:11.663
<v Speaker 2>which is part of the machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even even the WHO says they should </v>

2704
02:07:14.521 --> 02:07:16.530
<v Speaker 2>be less than 10%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2705
02:07:16.531 --> 02:07:19.050
<v Speaker 2>they're over in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are upwards of almost,</v>

2706
02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:21.100
<v Speaker 2>almost 40% of births.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Birds.</v>

2707
02:07:21.730 --> 02:07:25.290
<v Speaker 2>Are they doing that to save the vaginas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing it because they don't want</v>

2708
02:07:25.291 --> 02:07:27.660
<v Speaker 2>to feel bad feelings and they don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to feel pain.</v>

2709
02:07:27.930 --> 02:07:28.763
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard women like specifically say </v>

2710
02:07:31.441 --> 02:07:35.470
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to get stretched out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's a big yes,</v>

2711
02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:36.160
<v Speaker 2>certainly.</v>

2712
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:37.360
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think that's a huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivator.</v>

2713
02:07:37.361 --> 02:07:38.194
<v Speaker 3>I think people are really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women have been made to feel afraid of </v>

2714
02:07:40.841 --> 02:07:41.674
<v Speaker 3>their own bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the birth control thing we were </v>

2715
02:07:42.761 --> 02:07:43.594
<v Speaker 3>talking about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you think of your body as a total </v>

2716
02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:47.590
<v Speaker 3>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2717
02:07:47.591 --> 02:07:51.100
<v Speaker 3>that's dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is gonna fuck up at any given time.</v>

2718
02:07:51.101 --> 02:07:52.150
<v Speaker 3>And you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2719
02:07:52.151 --> 02:07:54.850
<v Speaker 3>wish you had listened to your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2720
02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:57.250
<v Speaker 3>doctor who's a man and he's never had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>baby.</v>

2721
02:07:57.730 --> 02:08:01.750
<v Speaker 3>Then you could obviously be led down </v>
<v Speaker 3>this path that says,</v>

2722
02:08:01.930 --> 02:08:02.763
<v Speaker 3>let me manage your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know better science knows better how </v>

2723
02:08:05.111 --> 02:08:06.850
<v Speaker 3>to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body,</v>

2724
02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:08.950
<v Speaker 3>it messes up all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2725
02:08:09.100 --> 02:08:11.650
<v Speaker 3>So that's the mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in that mentality,</v>

2726
02:08:11.890 --> 02:08:12.723
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you're robbed of this </v>

2727
02:08:14.591 --> 02:08:15.424
<v Speaker 3>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like psychedelic level opportunity to </v>

2728
02:08:19.900 --> 02:08:22.840
<v Speaker 3>have a transformation of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

2729
02:08:23.020 --> 02:08:26.800
<v Speaker 3>Because it is hard and it is scary and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it breaks your mind.</v>

2730
02:08:26.890 --> 02:08:31.890
<v Speaker 3>My mind broke on that day broke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's never been recovered because it</v>

2731
02:08:33.281 --> 02:08:37.390
<v Speaker 3>was literally so intense that my mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>was telling me,</v>

2732
02:08:37.391 --> 02:08:38.230
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna die,</v>

2733
02:08:38.231 --> 02:08:39.190
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna die.</v>

2734
02:08:40.030 --> 02:08:41.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's more,</v>

2735
02:08:42.190 --> 02:08:44.470
<v Speaker 3>more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not pain that you've ever,</v>

2736
02:08:44.770 --> 02:08:49.770
<v Speaker 3>you would recognize because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's purposeful pain.</v>

2737
02:08:49.901 --> 02:08:51.850
<v Speaker 3>It's not just a signal of something </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>

2738
02:08:52.510 --> 02:08:53.230
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

2739
02:08:53.230 --> 02:08:54.063
<v Speaker 3>it's a sensation that is a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>process of moving a human being through </v>

2740
02:08:59.230 --> 02:09:01.030
<v Speaker 3>an out of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not,</v>

2741
02:09:01.031 --> 02:09:02.290
<v Speaker 3>we call it pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2742
02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:04.240
<v Speaker 3>midwives don't call it pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>

2743
02:09:04.270 --> 02:09:06.550
<v Speaker 3>It's not pleasure either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just another thing.</v>

2744
02:09:07.030 --> 02:09:08.900
<v Speaker 3>It's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So screaming,</v>

2745
02:09:10.750 --> 02:09:13.150
<v Speaker 3>because when you're in that intense </v>
<v Speaker 3>portal,</v>

2746
02:09:13.151 --> 02:09:14.350
<v Speaker 3>you moan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the,</v>

2747
02:09:14.351 --> 02:09:16.660
<v Speaker 3>there are these primal sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We make,</v>

2748
02:09:16.900 --> 02:09:17.733
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we're making love or when we're </v>

2749
02:09:18.701 --> 02:09:20.140
<v Speaker 3>experiencing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2750
02:09:20.141 --> 02:09:23.140
<v Speaker 3>fear when we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're really in it,</v>

2751
02:09:23.170 --> 02:09:25.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we make those kinds of sounds and,</v>

2752
02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:27.700
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there is a lot of fear.</v>

2753
02:09:28.030 --> 02:09:30.730
<v Speaker 3>But ultimately if you don't succumb to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2754
02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:32.890
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it breaks and you see,</v>

2755
02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:35.530
<v Speaker 3>oh that was trying to tell me I couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>do this and look,</v>

2756
02:09:35.531 --> 02:09:36.270
<v Speaker 3>I just did it.</v>

2757
02:09:36.270 --> 02:09:37.103
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever think that if you could meet</v>
<v Speaker 5>your old self that your old self bilic </v>

2758
02:09:42.630 --> 02:09:45.150
<v Speaker 5>listen to this crazy bitch?</v>
<v Speaker 5>100%.</v>

2759
02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:50.460
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't even have hung out with me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like talk to me at a bar.</v>

2760
02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:52.440
<v Speaker 5>Coon lenient placebos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

2761
02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:53.700
<v Speaker 5>What do you want me to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eat eggs.</v>

2762
02:09:53.730 --> 02:09:57.340
<v Speaker 5>The Fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This girl is crazy pills.</v>

2763
02:09:57.650 --> 02:09:59.040
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you need pills?</v>

2764
02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:00.113
<v Speaker 5>You're delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about healers and </v>

2765
02:10:02.611 --> 02:10:03.444
<v Speaker 5>holistic medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would have been the eye roll all </v>

2766
02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:08.370
<v Speaker 5>total.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's hilarious.</v>

2767
02:10:08.371 --> 02:10:09.320
<v Speaker 5>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2768
02:10:09.420 --> 02:10:11.320
<v Speaker 5>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2769
02:10:11.670 --> 02:10:12.503
<v Speaker 3>reconcile that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I feel myself like I feel 100% </v>

2770
02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:18.263
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>

2771
02:10:18.340 --> 02:10:19.173
<v Speaker 5>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's there's zero self conscious aspect </v>

2772
02:10:21.311 --> 02:10:22.144
<v Speaker 5>of it where you do recognize that there </v>
<v Speaker 5>are certain science based practitioners </v>

2773
02:10:25.481 --> 02:10:27.100
<v Speaker 5>that will be like rolling their eyes at </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

2774
02:10:27.130 --> 02:10:27.880
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't care.</v>

2775
02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:28.950
<v Speaker 5>You don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't</v>

2776
02:10:28.950 --> 02:10:30.450
<v Speaker 3>care about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was interesting,</v>

2777
02:10:30.451 --> 02:10:31.284
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I published this book last year in </v>

2778
02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:33.853
<v Speaker 3>March,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what's it called again and mind of </v>

2779
02:10:34.701 --> 02:10:35.534
<v Speaker 3>your own and I published it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really weird experience because </v>

2780
02:10:39.140 --> 02:10:40.000
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2781
02:10:40.001 --> 02:10:42.440
<v Speaker 3>I was total newbie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never written a book before,</v>

2782
02:10:42.441 --> 02:10:43.274
<v Speaker 3>whatever and out the gate I got like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this very generous advance from a </v>

2783
02:10:46.761 --> 02:10:47.594
<v Speaker 3>mainstream publisher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which shocked me and then it comes time </v>

2784
02:10:51.051 --> 02:10:54.830
<v Speaker 3>to publish it and they can't get me on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>single,</v>

2785
02:10:55.450 --> 02:10:56.283
<v Speaker 3>you know the today show Doctor Oz 60 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes and they're used to waltzing </v>

2786
02:11:00.261 --> 02:11:01.094
<v Speaker 3>their authors who they give these large </v>
<v Speaker 3>advances to like write onto these </v>

2787
02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:05.900
<v Speaker 3>platforms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2788
02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:09.470
<v Speaker 3>Mainstream media platforms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told them is not going to work with me</v>

2789
02:11:09.471 --> 02:11:11.180
<v Speaker 3>like you haven't worked with someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>like me before.</v>

2790
02:11:11.181 --> 02:11:12.500
<v Speaker 3>Trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to work out.</v>

2791
02:11:12.650 --> 02:11:15.050
<v Speaker 3>These are all Pharma funded outlets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even NPR,</v>

2792
02:11:15.051 --> 02:11:16.370
<v Speaker 3>pbs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all are.</v>

2793
02:11:16.610 --> 02:11:17.710
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2794
02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:19.100
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have to come up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>something else.</v>

2795
02:11:19.101 --> 02:11:23.930
<v Speaker 3>And ultimately they didn't listen and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they started to Baz when I,</v>

2796
02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:26.330
<v Speaker 3>a month before launch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have a single interview,</v>

2797
02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:31.280
<v Speaker 3>they'd never had that happen before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it was cool because alt media,</v>

2798
02:11:31.490 --> 02:11:32.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>

2799
02:11:32.421 --> 02:11:36.350
<v Speaker 3>I just called on a bunch of my friends </v>
<v Speaker 3>and colleagues and we,</v>

2800
02:11:36.550 --> 02:11:39.140
<v Speaker 3>it was like top 20 on Amazon within the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first week.</v>

2801
02:11:39.141 --> 02:11:42.260
<v Speaker 3>And that's like the power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like mainstream media is totally dead.</v>

2802
02:11:42.261 --> 02:11:43.094
<v Speaker 3>And I have tell you that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was so quiet for like the whole </v>

2803
02:11:47.870 --> 02:11:49.850
<v Speaker 3>year afterward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you Google my book,</v>

2804
02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:50.713
<v Speaker 3>there is not a negative review of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like very controversial text on the </v>

2805
02:11:54.771 --> 02:11:56.600
<v Speaker 3>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very weird.</v>

2806
02:11:56.690 --> 02:12:01.690
<v Speaker 3>Because we have trolls on our site every</v>
<v Speaker 3>single day on facebook for example.</v>

2807
02:12:01.731 --> 02:12:02.870
<v Speaker 3>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter,</v>

2808
02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:03.733
<v Speaker 3>even instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like part of the deal of being an </v>

2809
02:12:05.511 --> 02:12:06.344
<v Speaker 3>activist is that you deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>astroturfing and you deal with that </v>

2810
02:12:08.151 --> 02:12:09.290
<v Speaker 3>whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2811
02:12:09.291 --> 02:12:10.850
<v Speaker 3>sort of strew turfing.</v>

2812
02:12:11.060 --> 02:12:11.751
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2813
02:12:11.751 --> 02:12:13.370
<v Speaker 3>you should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is um,</v>

2814
02:12:13.940 --> 02:12:18.140
<v Speaker 3>an amazing ted talk that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch by Sharyl attkisson who's like a,</v>

2815
02:12:18.230 --> 02:12:20.380
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a turncoat journalist,</v>

2816
02:12:20.381 --> 02:12:21.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she used to be an anchor,</v>

2817
02:12:21.651 --> 02:12:22.484
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so she has this Ted talk on </v>

2818
02:12:23.841 --> 02:12:25.940
<v Speaker 3>astroturfing and she basically breaks it</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

2819
02:12:25.941 --> 02:12:28.340
<v Speaker 3>Astroturfing is like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the word,</v>

2820
02:12:28.341 --> 02:12:31.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because it's like a fake grassroots</v>

2821
02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:33.530
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on social media,</v>

2822
02:12:34.010 --> 02:12:34.843
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's paid industry paid bots </v>

2823
02:12:38.931 --> 02:12:43.931
<v Speaker 3>basically who generate the impression </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there is an opinion anti anyone who</v>

2824
02:12:46.671 --> 02:12:49.100
<v Speaker 3>threatens the establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2825
02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:50.173
<v Speaker 3>And then they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are people who like organically </v>

2826
02:12:53.301 --> 02:12:56.140
<v Speaker 3>glom onto that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they create this,</v>

2827
02:12:56.420 --> 02:12:57.171
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2828
02:12:57.171 --> 02:13:00.020
<v Speaker 3>so they'll come on my site by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands.</v>

2829
02:13:00.050 --> 02:13:00.883
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it immediately after a comment is </v>

2830
02:13:03.051 --> 02:13:04.970
<v Speaker 3>written,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you quack,</v>

2831
02:13:04.971 --> 02:13:05.804
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where did you get that fake medical </v>

2832
02:13:06.951 --> 02:13:08.690
<v Speaker 3>degree?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're killing people.</v>

2833
02:13:08.690 --> 02:13:11.600
<v Speaker 3>You should be ashamed of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're reckless and yeah,</v>

2834
02:13:11.601 --> 02:13:12.434
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they almost always call me it's </v>

2835
02:13:13.651 --> 02:13:15.680
<v Speaker 3>water account.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like almost always part of it.</v>

2836
02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:19.310
<v Speaker 3>That's how you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there'll be like 500 likes within 10</v>

2837
02:13:19.311 --> 02:13:20.144
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like one of the indications that </v>

2838
02:13:22.101 --> 02:13:24.050
<v Speaker 3>it's a troll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2839
02:13:24.051 --> 02:13:24.884
<v Speaker 3>So like there'd be a face on the note </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's a troll and not just people </v>

2840
02:13:27.321 --> 02:13:29.750
<v Speaker 3>resonating with this idea that the hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>quarks,</v>

2841
02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:32.130
<v Speaker 3>cause I don't have that many people on </v>
<v Speaker 3>my facebook page so that that would ever</v>

2842
02:13:32.131 --> 02:13:33.580
<v Speaker 3>be a metric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2843
02:13:34.810 --> 02:13:35.643
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not even like probably </v>

2844
02:13:37.861 --> 02:13:41.450
<v Speaker 3>algorithmically possible that it would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be an organic phenomenon.</v>

2845
02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:42.353
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that thing recently?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie brought it up yesterday about </v>

2846
02:13:44.071 --> 02:13:44.904
<v Speaker 4>Donald Trump that turns out that he just</v>
<v Speaker 4>had millions of bots follow him on </v>

2847
02:13:49.471 --> 02:13:50.304
<v Speaker 4>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just letting I know where it's like </v>

2848
02:13:52.770 --> 02:13:55.350
<v Speaker 4>something like 4 million bots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2849
02:13:55.530 --> 02:13:57.600
<v Speaker 4>Just joined on and everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2850
02:13:57.601 --> 02:13:59.250
<v Speaker 4>what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened here?</v>

2851
02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:00.810
<v Speaker 4>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are fake accounts.</v>

2852
02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:02.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a thing that's,</v>

2853
02:14:02.641 --> 02:14:03.474
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not surprising that part of the </v>

2854
02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:07.113
<v Speaker 4>data that they can manipulate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is half of president trump's </v>

2855
02:14:09.271 --> 02:14:11.070
<v Speaker 4>twitter followers are bots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2856
02:14:11.071 --> 02:14:13.440
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is so crazy.</v>

2857
02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:14.513
<v Speaker 3>So you generate the impression that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a grassroots energy and that </v>

2858
02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:19.500
<v Speaker 3>it's actually not real.</v>

2859
02:14:19.580 --> 02:14:22.790
<v Speaker 4>He picked up 3 million twitter followers</v>
<v Speaker 4>in recent days,</v>

2860
02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:25.970
<v Speaker 4>most of which appear to be recently </v>
<v Speaker 4>created twitter bots,</v>

2861
02:14:25.971 --> 02:14:26.804
<v Speaker 4>screenwriter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>John Nivon pointed out Tuesday morning </v>

2862
02:14:28.731 --> 02:14:31.730
<v Speaker 4>that trump's account saw a big spike in </v>
<v Speaker 4>followers over the weekend.</v>

2863
02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:34.880
<v Speaker 4>Most of them newly created accounts </v>
<v Speaker 4>without photos or tweets,</v>

2864
02:14:34.910 --> 02:14:35.743
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tells Herald Times signs of twitter </v>

2865
02:14:37.131 --> 02:14:38.900
<v Speaker 4>bots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

2866
02:14:38.901 --> 02:14:42.980
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that is something that they're doing.</v>

2867
02:14:42.981 --> 02:14:43.814
<v Speaker 4>They're making it an active campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sort of boast up is a public appeal and </v>

2868
02:14:48.210 --> 02:14:49.043
<v Speaker 4>is</v>

2869
02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:50.400
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in that case,</v>

2870
02:14:50.401 --> 02:14:52.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know specifically,</v>

2871
02:14:52.141 --> 02:14:55.440
<v Speaker 3>but in that case it would be to generate</v>
<v Speaker 3>the impression that it's grass roots.</v>

2872
02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:56.191
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it's not.</v>

2873
02:14:56.191 --> 02:14:58.010
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's called astroturfing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2874
02:14:58.030 --> 02:14:59.530
<v Speaker 3>it's fake grassroots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>

2875
02:14:59.560 --> 02:15:00.151
<v Speaker 3>Got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2876
02:15:00.151 --> 02:15:00.984
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I have all that energy in my daily </v>

2877
02:15:03.451 --> 02:15:04.284
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't have a single negative </v>

2878
02:15:05.221 --> 02:15:07.440
<v Speaker 3>review of this book in like a year left </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the weird,</v>

2879
02:15:07.490 --> 02:15:08.323
<v Speaker 3>nope.</v>

2880
02:15:08.840 --> 02:15:11.450
<v Speaker 4>Says it's false.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why this is mostly false.</v>

2881
02:15:11.860 --> 02:15:12.693
<v Speaker 4>Since president trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like other twitter users with large </v>

2882
02:15:14.691 --> 02:15:15.524
<v Speaker 4>following has a large number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>followers that appear to be bots or </v>

2883
02:15:19.311 --> 02:15:23.500
<v Speaker 4>inauthentic automated user profiles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's false?</v>

2884
02:15:23.501 --> 02:15:24.334
<v Speaker 4>Trump did not receive an influx of 5 </v>
<v Speaker 4>million new twitter followers in three </v>

2885
02:15:28.631 --> 02:15:30.070
<v Speaker 4>days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2886
02:15:30.250 --> 02:15:31.860
<v Speaker 4>so stops questioning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2887
02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:34.570
<v Speaker 4>How many did I thought they said 3 </v>
<v Speaker 4>million.</v>

2888
02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:39.250
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it says as of May 1st it had 28.5</v>

2889
02:15:39.251 --> 02:15:41.800
<v Speaker 7>so it couldn't have gone up that fast </v>
<v Speaker 7>over the month.</v>

2890
02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:43.600
<v Speaker 7>Cause it's Atlanta one and a half </v>
<v Speaker 7>million gain.</v>

2891
02:15:43.660 --> 02:15:45.280
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2892
02:15:45.870 --> 02:15:48.960
<v Speaker 4>that's not even not abnormal for someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>with that many millions.</v>

2893
02:15:48.990 --> 02:15:50.160
<v Speaker 4>He is 28 million.</v>

2894
02:15:52.150 --> 02:15:52.791
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could go away.</v>

2895
02:15:52.791 --> 02:15:54.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The story just got weirder,</v>

2896
02:15:54.231 --> 02:15:55.580
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2897
02:15:56.840 --> 02:15:57.950
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

2898
02:15:58.280 --> 02:16:00.150
<v Speaker 4>According to the image archive images,</v>
<v Speaker 4>twins,</v>

2899
02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:02.450
<v Speaker 4>twitter page rumors of a surgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Farmers were great.</v>

2900
02:16:02.451 --> 02:16:04.220
<v Speaker 4>Really exaggerated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2901
02:16:04.380 --> 02:16:05.450
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2902
02:16:05.510 --> 02:16:07.490
<v Speaker 4>that's fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2903
02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:10.070
<v Speaker 4>it's what he's talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kinda jumped on the fake story,</v>

2904
02:16:10.071 --> 02:16:10.730
<v Speaker 4>Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2905
02:16:10.730 --> 02:16:12.860
<v Speaker 4>But I'm sure there's a ton of bots </v>
<v Speaker 4>following him.</v>

2906
02:16:12.861 --> 02:16:14.750
<v Speaker 4>I know there's a ton of bots following </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

2907
02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:16.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get them all the time.</v>

2908
02:16:16.311 --> 02:16:19.820
<v Speaker 4>These women that are fake women that </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to talk about sex.</v>

2909
02:16:20.050 --> 02:16:23.180
<v Speaker 4>I come to come chat with me about sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come sex me up.</v>

2910
02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:26.240
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all like the worst broken English.</v>

2911
02:16:26.510 --> 02:16:28.670
<v Speaker 4>Like it's time to tried to have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation with them.</v>

2912
02:16:28.671 --> 02:16:29.610
<v Speaker 4>And that worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who?</v>

2913
02:16:29.690 --> 02:16:30.040
<v Speaker 4>Who</v>

2914
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:30.970
<v Speaker 5>explained it to it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2915
02:16:30.971 --> 02:16:33.490
<v Speaker 5>I tried to dm them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't ignore me.</v>

2916
02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:38.640
<v Speaker 5>Who tried to explain that to us that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they use intentionally?</v>

2917
02:16:39.670 --> 02:16:40.503
<v Speaker 5>Was it malice?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was it Michael Miles that they used </v>

2918
02:16:43.301 --> 02:16:47.590
<v Speaker 5>intentionally shitty language so that if</v>
<v Speaker 5>you follow them,</v>

2919
02:16:47.591 --> 02:16:48.424
<v Speaker 5>like they're poor grammar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of like alerts them to suspicious </v>

2920
02:16:51.461 --> 02:16:55.840
<v Speaker 5>people so that suspicious people don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>interact with them but dumb people.</v>

2921
02:16:55.930 --> 02:16:56.763
<v Speaker 5>So they are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're a honeypot that creates this </v>

2922
02:16:58.990 --> 02:16:59.823
<v Speaker 5>environment that stupid people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>attracted to it because they can't see </v>

2923
02:17:02.171 --> 02:17:04.420
<v Speaker 5>that grammatical errors because they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>dumb.</v>

2924
02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:05.433
<v Speaker 5>And so it makes it more effective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So these Nigerian scammers apparently </v>

2925
02:17:08.950 --> 02:17:09.783
<v Speaker 5>purposely use bad grammar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they're more than capable of using </v>

2926
02:17:13.061 --> 02:17:13.894
<v Speaker 5>good English,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they use the shitty grammar so that </v>

2927
02:17:15.581 --> 02:17:18.400
<v Speaker 5>the people that they do get are just </v>
<v Speaker 5>really dumb.</v>

2928
02:17:18.460 --> 02:17:22.240
<v Speaker 5>They're not trying to snag like I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to sell you the Ivy Leaguers.</v>

2929
02:17:22.270 --> 02:17:24.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well anybody who's got a discerning idea</v>

2930
02:17:24.731 --> 02:17:25.840
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

2931
02:17:25.841 --> 02:17:27.150
<v Speaker 5>this may or may not be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not,</v>

2932
02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:28.023
<v Speaker 5>they're not trying to get that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're trying to get the gullible and </v>

2933
02:17:30.101 --> 02:17:31.420
<v Speaker 5>there's plenty of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2934
02:17:31.421 --> 02:17:32.920
<v Speaker 5>why,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why go fishing for sharks?</v>

2935
02:17:32.921 --> 02:17:34.680
<v Speaker 5>We can catch guppies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2936
02:17:34.690 --> 02:17:35.523
<v Speaker 5>and get nets fully guppies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They came to that in a way through the </v>

2937
02:17:37.271 --> 02:17:38.104
<v Speaker 5>net.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's this easy pickins still be able to </v>

2938
02:17:40.031 --> 02:17:41.530
<v Speaker 5>talk and try to catch a whale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

2939
02:17:41.531 --> 02:17:43.210
<v Speaker 5>that's too much work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2940
02:17:43.330 --> 02:17:45.070
<v Speaker 5>it's really interesting though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2941
02:17:45.071 --> 02:17:47.680
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if that is how sophisticated they</v>

2942
02:17:47.681 --> 02:17:49.840
<v Speaker 5>truly are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of fascinating.</v>

2943
02:17:50.490 --> 02:17:52.840
<v Speaker 5>But when sort of know this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you can interpret it.</v>

2944
02:17:53.010 --> 02:17:54.820
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just helps to be aware of it.</v>

2945
02:17:55.090 --> 02:17:55.923
<v Speaker 5>It would be a big,</v>
<v Speaker 5>big deal if we found out that </v>

2946
02:17:59.261 --> 02:18:00.094
<v Speaker 5>pharmaceutical companies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're actively engaging in the use of </v>

2947
02:18:02.771 --> 02:18:04.480
<v Speaker 5>these bots to attack people like you.</v>

2948
02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:05.553
<v Speaker 5>Like if you had someone like wikileaks </v>
<v Speaker 5>on your side to like dug into this shit </v>

2949
02:18:08.620 --> 02:18:09.453
<v Speaker 5>and you know Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some whistleblower from the </v>

2950
02:18:10.901 --> 02:18:15.700
<v Speaker 5>pharmaceutical industry that cares and </v>
<v Speaker 5>release that stuff,</v>

2951
02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:16.743
<v Speaker 5>that'd be pretty giant where I have some</v>
<v Speaker 5>colleagues working on that really don't </v>

2952
02:18:20.081 --> 02:18:23.050
<v Speaker 5>tell people now they're going to try to </v>
<v Speaker 5>cover their tracks.</v>

2953
02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:25.450
<v Speaker 5>They'll never know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2954
02:18:25.451 --> 02:18:27.370
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the truth is that I don't think it's</v>

2955
02:18:27.371 --> 02:18:31.790
<v Speaker 5>going to require that because I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>people are waking up just by sheer,</v>

2956
02:18:31.791 --> 02:18:33.760
<v Speaker 5>it's like I synergy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like people are waking up,</v>

2957
02:18:33.790 --> 02:18:34.623
<v Speaker 5>they are calling bullshit on a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the heavy handed claims of the </v>

2958
02:18:38.441 --> 02:18:39.274
<v Speaker 5>pharmaceutical industry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know that doctors aren't helping </v>

2959
02:18:40.871 --> 02:18:42.030
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2960
02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:42.873
<v Speaker 5>they know that the conventional model </v>
<v Speaker 5>has very limited ability to help them </v>

2961
02:18:46.361 --> 02:18:48.490
<v Speaker 5>and or they've tried it and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>worked.</v>

2962
02:18:48.700 --> 02:18:49.533
<v Speaker 5>So people are waking up and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 5>in more recent time I've focused my </v>

2963
02:18:52.361 --> 02:18:56.800
<v Speaker 5>energy not on fighting the sis like some</v>
<v Speaker 5>David and Goliath situation,</v>

2964
02:18:57.160 --> 02:18:57.993
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just focusing on making sure people </v>

2965
02:19:00.251 --> 02:19:03.910
<v Speaker 5>know like what's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like bucky fuller quote,</v>

2966
02:19:03.911 --> 02:19:06.340
<v Speaker 5>like you don't fight the existing </v>
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>

2967
02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:06.891
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2968
02:19:06.891 --> 02:19:09.790
<v Speaker 5>you create one that makes the existing </v>
<v Speaker 5>system obsolete.</v>

2969
02:19:09.820 --> 02:19:11.500
<v Speaker 5>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who made this quote,</v>

2970
02:19:11.501 --> 02:19:13.240
<v Speaker 5>but it's a wonderful one in this regard </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2971
02:19:13.320 --> 02:19:14.153
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>before diagnosing yourself with </v>

2972
02:19:15.521 --> 02:19:16.354
<v Speaker 5>depression first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make sure you're not surrounded by </v>

2973
02:19:17.711 --> 02:19:20.400
<v Speaker 5>assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who's quote is,</v>

2974
02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:23.920
<v Speaker 5>it's a great quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>great quote.</v>

2975
02:19:24.250 --> 02:19:25.300
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2976
02:19:25.301 --> 02:19:27.740
<v Speaker 5>and also you might have a shitty life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2977
02:19:27.741 --> 02:19:28.070
<v Speaker 5>you might</v>

2978
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:30.250
<v Speaker 4>be bummed out because you're working all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the time and a job,</v>

2979
02:19:30.251 --> 02:19:31.084
<v Speaker 4>it's uninspiring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might be bummed out because he got </v>

2980
02:19:32.241 --> 02:19:34.640
<v Speaker 4>an abusive spouse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might be bummed out because you live</v>

2981
02:19:34.641 --> 02:19:37.580
<v Speaker 4>in a crime infested neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might be bummed out for,</v>

2982
02:19:37.581 --> 02:19:39.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might have some environmental issues</v>

2983
02:19:39.861 --> 02:19:43.010
<v Speaker 4>that are causing health problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot going on.</v>

2984
02:19:43.130 --> 02:19:48.130
<v Speaker 4>You might work in a job that gets you </v>
<v Speaker 4>exposed to toxic fumes or chemicals or,</v>

2985
02:19:49.110 --> 02:19:50.540
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of variables.</v>

2986
02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:55.600
<v Speaker 4>We were in a medical system that blames </v>
<v Speaker 4>your biology.</v>

2987
02:19:56.810 --> 02:19:57.530
<v Speaker 8>That's it.</v>

2988
02:19:57.530 --> 02:19:59.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just blames your biology.</v>

2989
02:19:59.541 --> 02:20:00.374
<v Speaker 4>So if it says it's convenient and </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it suits the paradigm that's in </v>

2990
02:20:03.111 --> 02:20:03.944
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>

2991
02:20:05.220 --> 02:20:06.090
<v Speaker 8>that's exactly right.</v>

2992
02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:10.780
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it should be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people,</v>

2993
02:20:11.150 --> 02:20:13.000
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ascribe it to Freud.</v>

2994
02:20:13.270 --> 02:20:15.100
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this a quote,</v>

2995
02:20:15.101 --> 02:20:15.934
<v Speaker 4>investigator.com,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he says that it actually should go to </v>

2996
02:20:18.341 --> 02:20:20.680
<v Speaker 4>this twitter account,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a twitter account,</v>

2997
02:20:21.070 --> 02:20:25.030
<v Speaker 4>which twitter account,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Debbie hope should be credited with the,</v>

2998
02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:26.920
<v Speaker 4>it says Debbie wizard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2999
02:20:27.760 --> 02:20:29.110
<v Speaker 4>whoever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she nailed it.</v>

3000
02:20:29.570 --> 02:20:33.520
<v Speaker 4>Did she nail it and attributed to Freud?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a kind of a clever move.</v>

3001
02:20:33.521 --> 02:20:36.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't want the attention version.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3002
02:20:36.491 --> 02:20:39.280
<v Speaker 4>really awesome and attributed to some </v>
<v Speaker 4>dead dude who was a genius.</v>

3003
02:20:39.370 --> 02:20:40.203
<v Speaker 4>I found the site before they kind kinda </v>
<v Speaker 4>like do the telephone game with quotes </v>

3004
02:20:42.881 --> 02:20:44.770
<v Speaker 4>and sort of like this is what people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>

3005
02:20:44.771 --> 02:20:45.604
<v Speaker 4>And then they go through like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the iterations of how it's been </v>

3006
02:20:47.831 --> 02:20:48.664
<v Speaker 4>translated out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember that one Greg Giraldo </v>

3007
02:20:50.951 --> 02:20:51.784
<v Speaker 4>joke that got attributed to me online </v>
<v Speaker 4>and people have photos of me with Greg </v>

3008
02:20:55.541 --> 02:20:57.760
<v Speaker 4>draw those quote and something that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>never said.</v>

3009
02:20:57.840 --> 02:21:01.120
<v Speaker 4>It's absolutely not mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know whose it was.</v>

3010
02:21:01.121 --> 02:21:02.440
<v Speaker 4>And then someone had to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's great girl.</v>

3011
02:21:02.470 --> 02:21:04.990
<v Speaker 4>Geraldo's and then people say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are you stealing greg?</v>

3012
02:21:04.991 --> 02:21:07.540
<v Speaker 4>Geraldo shut my making memes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3013
02:21:07.541 --> 02:21:09.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody else did that,</v>

3014
02:21:09.370 --> 02:21:12.130
<v Speaker 4>but I put it on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not mine.</v>

3015
02:21:12.160 --> 02:21:14.830
<v Speaker 4>I think I might've put it on instagram </v>
<v Speaker 4>too long time ago,</v>

3016
02:21:14.831 --> 02:21:16.750
<v Speaker 4>but it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like I kept getting them.</v>

3017
02:21:16.780 --> 02:21:20.050
<v Speaker 4>Or you get them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These memes come in waves.</v>

3018
02:21:20.530 --> 02:21:23.620
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get ones that I did say I get those in</v>

3019
02:21:23.621 --> 02:21:24.454
<v Speaker 4>waves too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get these pictures of me with like </v>

3020
02:21:26.741 --> 02:21:29.590
<v Speaker 4>weird quotes that I'd said names are </v>
<v Speaker 4>very powerful.</v>

3021
02:21:29.591 --> 02:21:30.424
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Video is even more powerful though </v>

3022
02:21:31.691 --> 02:21:32.524
<v Speaker 4>because I think people have come to this</v>
<v Speaker 4>conclusion that they can't trust </v>

3023
02:21:34.991 --> 02:21:36.580
<v Speaker 4>anything anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Names are funny.</v>

3024
02:21:36.820 --> 02:21:40.240
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like good solid shame.</v>

3025
02:21:40.390 --> 02:21:41.223
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the things that was so </v>
<v Speaker 4>egregious about that fat Jewish guy and </v>

3026
02:21:43.710 --> 02:21:44.543
<v Speaker 4>said he was stealing these brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas and it made him look brilliant </v>

3027
02:21:47.380 --> 02:21:48.213
<v Speaker 4>when really he's just sort of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>aggregator of other people's awesome </v>

3028
02:21:50.441 --> 02:21:55.030
<v Speaker 4>ideas without giving them credit and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>just got on this plagiarism loophole and</v>

3029
02:21:55.031 --> 02:21:55.990
<v Speaker 4>everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

3030
02:21:56.500 --> 02:21:57.333
<v Speaker 4>And now he's got this weird thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>he does where he says that he puts up </v>

3031
02:22:00.401 --> 02:22:01.234
<v Speaker 4>the meme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He writes his own quote and then just </v>

3032
02:22:03.581 --> 02:22:06.670
<v Speaker 4>puts the originators name at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3033
02:22:06.700 --> 02:22:09.070
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't even say originally created </v>
<v Speaker 4>by,</v>

3034
02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:10.113
<v Speaker 4>he just puts their name and that's like </v>
<v Speaker 4>attribute and credit and some sort of a </v>

3035
02:22:13.541 --> 02:22:14.374
<v Speaker 4>weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's super slimy like what's going on </v>

3036
02:22:17.921 --> 02:22:20.410
<v Speaker 4>now with like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the problem is like some,</v>

3037
02:22:20.411 --> 02:22:22.540
<v Speaker 4>it'll send you something and I have real</v>
<v Speaker 4>issue with this.</v>

3038
02:22:22.541 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 4>Like someone sends me something that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>hilarious and I want to it on instagram.</v>

3039
02:22:26.030 --> 02:22:26.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

3040
02:22:26.730 --> 02:22:28.290
<v Speaker 5>made it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can I just put it up?</v>

3041
02:22:28.590 --> 02:22:30.360
<v Speaker 5>Like what do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do I say,</v>

3042
02:22:30.361 --> 02:22:31.680
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who the fuck made this.</v>

3043
02:22:31.830 --> 02:22:34.380
<v Speaker 5>Let me know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then put it up and then people go,</v>

3044
02:22:34.381 --> 02:22:35.760
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just see what Joe Rogan said.</v>

3045
02:22:35.761 --> 02:22:37.380
<v Speaker 5>There's Hilariously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't say it.</v>

3046
02:22:37.500 --> 02:22:38.333
<v Speaker 5>It matters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm big into attribution because it </v>

3047
02:22:39.691 --> 02:22:42.490
<v Speaker 5>makes it like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like I have company around me,</v>

3048
02:22:42.500 --> 02:22:43.010
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3049
02:22:43.010 --> 02:22:45.600
<v Speaker 5>it's also people turn into a business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3050
02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:49.810
<v Speaker 5>Like the meme business is a business and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they have sponsored posts,</v>

3051
02:22:50.040 --> 02:22:55.020
<v Speaker 5>sponsored instagram posts and sponsored </v>
<v Speaker 5>tweets and they make a lot of money.</v>

3052
02:22:55.021 --> 02:22:55.854
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a lot of money to be made </v>
<v Speaker 5>and people were getting these </v>

3053
02:22:57.271 --> 02:22:58.104
<v Speaker 5>development deals to do television shows</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all sorts of other things based on </v>

3054
02:23:01.591 --> 02:23:04.410
<v Speaker 5>the content of other people's ideas that</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just aggregating.</v>

3055
02:23:04.500 --> 02:23:05.340
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3056
02:23:05.340 --> 02:23:08.700
<v Speaker 5>Well it's just a weird loophole and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you were doing it with music,</v>

3057
02:23:08.701 --> 02:23:09.534
<v Speaker 5>like say if you just wanted to take </v>
<v Speaker 5>rifts that you thought were really </v>

3058
02:23:12.031 --> 02:23:15.060
<v Speaker 5>awesome and put them on your music page,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people will go,</v>

3059
02:23:15.061 --> 02:23:16.380
<v Speaker 5>well fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't do that.</v>

3060
02:23:16.381 --> 02:23:18.090
<v Speaker 5>This is my stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I created this,</v>

3061
02:23:18.450 --> 02:23:19.283
<v Speaker 5>but we that signature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you're putting watermarks on </v>

3062
02:23:21.361 --> 02:23:22.194
<v Speaker 5>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that signature is not necessarily </v>

3063
02:23:23.701 --> 02:23:25.100
<v Speaker 5>available with mediums.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3064
02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:27.330
<v Speaker 5>Cause they're that powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3065
02:23:27.690 --> 02:23:29.580
<v Speaker 5>And if even if you do put a watermark,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what they do,</v>

3066
02:23:29.790 --> 02:23:30.623
<v Speaker 5>they just find the original photo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put their own quote over it and just </v>

3067
02:23:33.691 --> 02:23:34.524
<v Speaker 5>don't attribute anything to you because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't want you to have the </v>

3068
02:23:36.481 --> 02:23:38.730
<v Speaker 5>watermark on their page.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's sneaky.</v>

3069
02:23:39.480 --> 02:23:42.390
<v Speaker 5>It's like some weird copyright loophole </v>
<v Speaker 5>that exists now.</v>

3070
02:23:43.270 --> 02:23:44.103
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one knows exactly what to do about </v>

3071
02:23:45.271 --> 02:23:46.104
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need some ambulance chasing lawyers </v>

3072
02:23:47.341 --> 02:23:48.650
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>

3073
02:23:48.690 --> 02:23:50.520
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ambulance chambers chasers,</v>

3074
02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:51.593
<v Speaker 5>so what blow back have you experienced </v>
<v Speaker 5>other than this influx of trolls and </v>

3075
02:23:58.651 --> 02:24:01.860
<v Speaker 5>people there is that for a whole year?</v>
<v Speaker 5>None.</v>

3076
02:24:01.890 --> 02:24:02.723
<v Speaker 5>Like I took out a large life insurance </v>
<v Speaker 5>policy when I published my book </v>

3077
02:24:06.601 --> 02:24:10.200
<v Speaker 5>expecting like pretty serious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could word you were going to die.</v>

3078
02:24:11.130 --> 02:24:13.410
<v Speaker 5>It's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have colleagues.</v>

3079
02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:14.393
<v Speaker 5>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what college did you have that have </v>

3080
02:24:15.901 --> 02:24:16.734
<v Speaker 5>died?</v>

3081
02:24:19.080 --> 02:24:19.291
<v Speaker 5>My,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3082
02:24:19.291 --> 02:24:20.124
<v Speaker 5>leave that mystery hangar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's you think people have been </v>

3083
02:24:23.041 --> 02:24:26.190
<v Speaker 5>killed because they've criticized </v>
<v Speaker 5>pharmaceutical companies.</v>

3084
02:24:27.150 --> 02:24:27.983
<v Speaker 5>You just have to know that it's the most</v>
<v Speaker 5>powerful industry in the public eye </v>

3085
02:24:32.341 --> 02:24:33.900
<v Speaker 5>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's intense though.</v>

3086
02:24:33.901 --> 02:24:37.590
<v Speaker 5>What you just said like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have colleagues that you believe may</v>

3087
02:24:37.591 --> 02:24:39.180
<v Speaker 5>have been killing me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to talk about it.</v>

3088
02:24:39.181 --> 02:24:43.170
<v Speaker 5>Obviously he'd clamp right up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to shut me up.</v>

3089
02:24:43.650 --> 02:24:45.720
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you really believe that.</v>

3090
02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:50.010
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is was like focus on this layman,</v>

3091
02:24:50.070 --> 02:24:51.640
<v Speaker 5>but I do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're lying.</v>

3092
02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:54.750
<v Speaker 5>It's powerful narrative habit that it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>a possible narrative.</v>

3093
02:24:54.790 --> 02:24:57.270
<v Speaker 5>They might silence you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in the,</v>

3094
02:24:57.271 --> 02:24:58.104
<v Speaker 5>in the realm of independent journalism </v>
<v Speaker 5>and media where some random Schmo like </v>

3095
02:25:03.721 --> 02:25:06.690
<v Speaker 5>me can actually have influence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially,</v>

3096
02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:07.553
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I am credentialed in a way that </v>

3097
02:25:09.361 --> 02:25:10.194
<v Speaker 5>people might pay attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right then why would they not want to </v>

3098
02:25:13.860 --> 02:25:14.693
<v Speaker 5>quiet me?</v>

3099
02:25:14.850 --> 02:25:15.331
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3100
02:25:15.331 --> 02:25:17.760
<v Speaker 5>they put labels on cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one gives a shit.</v>

3101
02:25:17.940 --> 02:25:19.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3102
02:25:19.231 --> 02:25:23.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if what you're saying is </v>
<v Speaker 5>worth killing somebody over who,</v>

3103
02:25:23.350 --> 02:25:24.131
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm still here,</v>

3104
02:25:24.131 --> 02:25:25.270
<v Speaker 5>so apparently not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3105
02:25:25.540 --> 02:25:26.373
<v Speaker 5>And what will know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It means like all those whistle blowers </v>

3106
02:25:28.121 --> 02:25:29.650
<v Speaker 5>when it came to his cigarettes and </v>
<v Speaker 5>cancer,</v>

3107
02:25:29.651 --> 02:25:30.484
<v Speaker 5>those who gives a shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's people there make more money from </v>

3108
02:25:32.231 --> 02:25:34.090
<v Speaker 5>cigarettes now than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Less people smoke.</v>

3109
02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:36.910
<v Speaker 5>So they just charge more for cigarettes </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they make more than ever.</v>

3110
02:25:36.970 --> 02:25:39.790
<v Speaker 5>They make more now for cigarettes and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they have in the last 15 years.</v>

3111
02:25:40.590 --> 02:25:41.011
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3112
02:25:41.011 --> 02:25:41.771
<v Speaker 3>I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3113
02:25:41.771 --> 02:25:43.530
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's true that just because,</v>

3114
02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:45.750
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

3115
02:25:45.751 --> 02:25:48.860
<v Speaker 3>like I'm not just trying to scare people</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of taking meds and trying to help.</v>

3116
02:25:48.890 --> 02:25:49.723
<v Speaker 3>Also showing that you can totally shed </v>
<v Speaker 3>your chronic illnesses completely </v>

3117
02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:56.033
<v Speaker 3>forever macho forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that you can have longterm shedding </v>

3118
02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:02.610
<v Speaker 3>of your chronic ells is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That to me is a more threatening element</v>

3119
02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:03.713
<v Speaker 3>of what I have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then just like these pills are </v>

3120
02:26:05.281 --> 02:26:06.240
<v Speaker 3>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't take them.</v>

3121
02:26:06.241 --> 02:26:07.074
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying you might have been told </v>

3122
02:26:09.331 --> 02:26:11.460
<v Speaker 3>you're broken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have a mental illness for life,</v>

3123
02:26:11.610 --> 02:26:12.930
<v Speaker 3>but in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3124
02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:15.460
<v Speaker 3>like I have a woman who completed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3125
02:26:15.570 --> 02:26:16.403
<v Speaker 3>my online program had such bad migraine </v>
<v Speaker 3>headaches that she had to be on Ivy </v>

3126
02:26:19.651 --> 02:26:20.484
<v Speaker 3>Treatments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was treated by the top neurologist </v>

3127
02:26:21.571 --> 02:26:24.500
<v Speaker 3>at emory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was on multiple pharmaceuticals.</v>

3128
02:26:24.501 --> 02:26:26.550
<v Speaker 3>She was bedbound for two years.</v>

3129
02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:29.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she completed my program,</v>

3130
02:26:29.611 --> 02:26:31.320
<v Speaker 3>which we talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not rocket science.</v>

3131
02:26:31.321 --> 02:26:33.750
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's totally symptom free.</v>

3132
02:26:34.260 --> 02:26:35.093
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3133
02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:36.960
<v Speaker 3>So that's pretty threatening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

3134
02:26:36.961 --> 02:26:38.430
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to show you that in fact,</v>

3135
02:26:38.580 --> 02:26:39.413
<v Speaker 3>what you're told is a permanent problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just have to deal with and live </v>

3136
02:26:42.601 --> 02:26:43.434
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with pharmaceutical medicine could be </v>

3137
02:26:44.671 --> 02:26:47.370
<v Speaker 3>completely dissolved as a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>threatening concept.</v>

3138
02:26:47.371 --> 02:26:48.204
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean many functional medicine doctors </v>

3139
02:26:50.341 --> 02:26:52.170
<v Speaker 3>and holistic healers are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

3140
02:26:52.340 --> 02:26:53.173
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>working to create awareness of this </v>

3141
02:26:54.721 --> 02:26:57.000
<v Speaker 3>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But regardless,</v>

3142
02:26:57.030 --> 02:26:59.010
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty weird that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3143
02:26:59.011 --> 02:26:59.844
<v Speaker 3>the book made the New York Times list </v>
<v Speaker 3>strangely and there wasn't a mention of </v>

3144
02:27:04.261 --> 02:27:07.980
<v Speaker 3>it in mainstream media for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not once.</v>

3145
02:27:08.110 --> 02:27:10.570
<v Speaker 5>Like nobody wanted you to have to have </v>
<v Speaker 5>you on their show.</v>

3146
02:27:10.660 --> 02:27:13.210
<v Speaker 5>This is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a negative review,</v>

3147
02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:15.560
<v Speaker 3>like not a single mention in mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 3>media.</v>

3148
02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:16.473
<v Speaker 5>So the negative review is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the problem with that is that you could </v>

3149
02:27:17.801 --> 02:27:21.490
<v Speaker 5>refute the negative reviews and also </v>
<v Speaker 5>cause tension attention on it.</v>

3150
02:27:21.890 --> 02:27:24.280
<v Speaker 5>Now let's see what her response is </v>
<v Speaker 5>decided to ignore me,</v>

3151
02:27:24.281 --> 02:27:26.350
<v Speaker 5>which I was totally cool with because I </v>
<v Speaker 5>had a very chill year.</v>

3152
02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:29.560
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm your life insurance policy.</v>

3153
02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:30.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

3154
02:27:30.770 --> 02:27:31.550
<v Speaker 5>Just,</v>

3155
02:27:31.550 --> 02:27:32.510
<v Speaker 3>just waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3156
02:27:32.610 --> 02:27:34.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get my couple million to my kids.</v>

3157
02:27:34.591 --> 02:27:38.850
<v Speaker 3>But it's changing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even in the past month or so,</v>

3158
02:27:38.970 --> 02:27:39.803
<v Speaker 3>there's been like a more of a targeted </v>
<v Speaker 3>effort and a couple of allure and cosmo </v>

3159
02:27:44.971 --> 02:27:49.210
<v Speaker 3>and couple of mainstream outlets have </v>
<v Speaker 3>begun to um,</v>

3160
02:27:49.260 --> 02:27:51.120
<v Speaker 3>suggest that I am in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3161
02:27:51.121 --> 02:27:54.480
<v Speaker 3>a dangerous reckless person who shames </v>
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>

3162
02:27:54.840 --> 02:27:55.351
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

3163
02:27:55.351 --> 02:27:56.184
<v Speaker 3>who take meds.</v>

3164
02:27:56.410 --> 02:27:58.180
<v Speaker 5>They've said this in articles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3165
02:27:58.181 --> 02:27:59.014
<v Speaker 5>I mean you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3166
02:27:59.250 --> 02:28:01.530
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to give it the claims quick</v>

3167
02:28:01.550 --> 02:28:02.383
<v Speaker 5>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not funny that like if you give </v>

3168
02:28:03.601 --> 02:28:08.601
<v Speaker 5>advice that is based on actual studies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>actual medicine,</v>

3169
02:28:09.180 --> 02:28:10.890
<v Speaker 5>give advice about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3170
02:28:10.891 --> 02:28:11.221
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

3171
02:28:11.221 --> 02:28:12.054
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's not a good idea that you take</v>
<v Speaker 5>these crazy medications where we don't </v>

3172
02:28:14.371 --> 02:28:15.204
<v Speaker 5>exactly know why you're taking them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't know exactly if these are the </v>

3173
02:28:17.041 --> 02:28:19.740
<v Speaker 5>right medications for you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the testing them on you literally as you</v>

3174
02:28:19.741 --> 02:28:21.980
<v Speaker 5>go along that you're shaming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm</v>

3175
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:23.270
<v Speaker 3>not even saying maybe it's not a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>

3176
02:28:23.420 --> 02:28:24.253
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what the science says that you </v>

3177
02:28:25.401 --> 02:28:27.980
<v Speaker 3>might not have been told and here's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's additionally possible.</v>

3178
02:28:27.981 --> 02:28:29.570
<v Speaker 3>You should just at least know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3179
02:28:29.571 --> 02:28:31.280
<v Speaker 3>and here's the social proof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3180
02:28:31.281 --> 02:28:32.114
<v Speaker 3>interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm publishing for case reports as we </v>

3181
02:28:33.561 --> 02:28:35.930
<v Speaker 3>speak in the peer reviewed index medical</v>
<v Speaker 3>literature.</v>

3182
02:28:36.290 --> 02:28:37.123
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is not like some random blog I </v>

3183
02:28:40.611 --> 02:28:41.444
<v Speaker 3>wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3184
02:28:41.540 --> 02:28:44.120
<v Speaker 3>So just know that that's possible and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then make your decision.</v>

3185
02:28:44.121 --> 02:28:44.954
<v Speaker 3>And guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're on meds and this sounds </v>

3186
02:28:46.820 --> 02:28:49.040
<v Speaker 3>interesting to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'm showing you you,</v>

3187
02:28:49.041 --> 02:28:51.910
<v Speaker 3>there's a path to a new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3188
02:28:51.920 --> 02:28:53.600
<v Speaker 3>approach that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3189
02:28:53.630 --> 02:28:57.500
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But actually it hits even given airwaves</v>

3190
02:28:57.501 --> 02:29:00.980
<v Speaker 3>cause it's just sort of ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I do believe a lot of initiated with</v>

3191
02:29:00.981 --> 02:29:04.100
<v Speaker 3>astroturfing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm being called an ablest.</v>

3192
02:29:04.530 --> 02:29:06.830
<v Speaker 4>Never heard that word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never heard that word before.</v>

3193
02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:08.820
<v Speaker 4>Hundred folds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the new ones that kids are using.</v>

3194
02:29:08.821 --> 02:29:11.100
<v Speaker 4>All these little snowflakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good to know of it.</v>

3195
02:29:11.230 --> 02:29:11.940
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3196
02:29:11.940 --> 02:29:15.370
<v Speaker 3>so I'm shaming people who can't do what </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm able to do,</v>

3197
02:29:15.371 --> 02:29:16.450
<v Speaker 3>including have a home birth.</v>

3198
02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:21.340
<v Speaker 4>But this has been around for a while to </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of,</v>

3199
02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:26.120
<v Speaker 4>I know you're a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not as bad.</v>

3200
02:29:26.660 --> 02:29:29.210
<v Speaker 4>White woman privilege is not real it </v>
<v Speaker 4>Israel.</v>

3201
02:29:29.211 --> 02:29:30.680
<v Speaker 4>No it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it certainly is.</v>

3202
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:34.310
<v Speaker 4>It certainly is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you guys have a struggle with that a</v>

3203
02:29:34.311 --> 02:29:35.480
<v Speaker 4>bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps.</v>

3204
02:29:35.980 --> 02:29:37.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm a conqueror.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a man.</v>

3205
02:29:37.401 --> 02:29:40.130
<v Speaker 4>Terrible person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Done are things throughout history.</v>

3206
02:29:40.280 --> 02:29:42.710
<v Speaker 4>Clearly all men are responsible for all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the horrible stuff.</v>

3207
02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:45.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Able,</v>

3208
02:29:45.290 --> 02:29:48.140
<v Speaker 4>this is a wonderful term.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's too easy to survive is not enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>difficulty out there.</v>

3215
02:30:01.911 --> 02:30:06.440
<v Speaker 4>People go looking for insults and </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking for things that are off.</v>

3216
02:30:06.590 --> 02:30:07.423
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There there's a constant searching for </v>

3217
02:30:09.921 --> 02:30:10.754
<v Speaker 4>outrage.</v>

3218
02:30:10.970 --> 02:30:13.620
<v Speaker 4>This quest for recreational outrage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3219
02:30:13.621 --> 02:30:16.190
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people find things to be appalled at</v>

3220
02:30:16.191 --> 02:30:18.200
<v Speaker 4>and then attack them and go nuts over </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3221
02:30:18.201 --> 02:30:19.880
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very strange time.</v>

3222
02:30:20.270 --> 02:30:20.900
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3223
02:30:20.900 --> 02:30:23.240
<v Speaker 4>I think it's beautiful though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's all,</v>

3224
02:30:23.241 --> 02:30:24.770
<v Speaker 4>it's all really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we're,</v>

3225
02:30:24.771 --> 02:30:28.160
<v Speaker 4>we're coming to grips with how </v>
<v Speaker 4>preposterous we are and we're,</v>

3226
02:30:28.161 --> 02:30:32.150
<v Speaker 4>we're doing so in the middle of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>embroiled battles over ideologies,</v>

3227
02:30:32.151 --> 02:30:34.580
<v Speaker 4>over cultural expression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3228
02:30:34.581 --> 02:30:35.414
<v Speaker 4>there's some girls in Portland that had </v>
<v Speaker 4>taken a rash of shit because they're </v>

3229
02:30:38.661 --> 02:30:40.820
<v Speaker 4>selling burritos and they're white.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

3230
02:30:40.860 --> 02:30:41.693
<v Speaker 4>they made a burrito truck and people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>going crazy and trying to shut them </v>

3231
02:30:44.361 --> 02:30:45.194
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shut them down because they're not </v>

3232
02:30:47.210 --> 02:30:51.230
<v Speaker 4>Mexican and they're selling burritos </v>
<v Speaker 4>like they're not,</v>

3233
02:30:51.640 --> 02:30:53.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not pretending.</v>

3234
02:30:53.301 --> 02:30:54.134
<v Speaker 4>They're not like putting shoe Polish on </v>
<v Speaker 4>and pretending and that put in brown </v>

3235
02:30:56.691 --> 02:30:57.524
<v Speaker 4>face on there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just fucking selling burritos like it's </v>

3236
02:31:00.291 --> 02:31:03.990
<v Speaker 4>so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Its critics close.</v>

3237
02:31:04.010 --> 02:31:07.010
<v Speaker 4>White Women's Portland Burrito stand for</v>
<v Speaker 4>cultural theft.</v>

3238
02:31:07.011 --> 02:31:09.860
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their burritos assholes.</v>

3239
02:31:10.820 --> 02:31:13.070
<v Speaker 4>Mexicans don't even eat burritos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes they do.</v>

3240
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:15.740
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a Mexican expert.</v>

3241
02:31:15.770 --> 02:31:19.770
<v Speaker 4>Burrito's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've eaten Burrito's in Mexico food.</v>

3242
02:31:20.490 --> 02:31:24.150
<v Speaker 5>I have had a real chicken burrito in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Mexico and was quite delicious.</v>

3243
02:31:24.180 --> 02:31:25.560
<v Speaker 5>I love Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's done a lot of it.</v>

3244
02:31:25.610 --> 02:31:29.340
<v Speaker 5>I just don't understand why anybody </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinks that there's something wrong with</v>

3245
02:31:29.341 --> 02:31:32.070
<v Speaker 5>learning a style of cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3246
02:31:32.250 --> 02:31:34.350
<v Speaker 5>I think if you have cultural </v>
<v Speaker 5>appropriation,</v>

3247
02:31:34.351 --> 02:31:35.184
<v Speaker 5>if you have like a person who's </v>
<v Speaker 5>pretending they're from Laos and they </v>

3248
02:31:38.791 --> 02:31:41.580
<v Speaker 5>start talking with a fake accent and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

3249
02:31:41.750 --> 02:31:42.780
<v Speaker 5>and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

3250
02:31:42.960 --> 02:31:44.910
<v Speaker 5>you're full fucking Cleveland.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not even,</v>

3251
02:31:45.270 --> 02:31:46.103
<v Speaker 5>you're not even of Laos to scent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you do a 23 and me on you and you </v>

3252
02:31:48.931 --> 02:31:50.730
<v Speaker 5>find out like your family is from </v>
<v Speaker 5>Finland.</v>

3253
02:31:50.731 --> 02:31:52.360
<v Speaker 5>Like the fuck is wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3254
02:31:52.430 --> 02:31:54.930
<v Speaker 5>but there are people that do that and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that is crazy.</v>

3255
02:31:54.960 --> 02:31:57.120
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's just deceptive.</v>

3256
02:31:57.390 --> 02:32:00.120
<v Speaker 5>This is not deceptive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it someone who likes making Burritos,</v>

3257
02:32:00.121 --> 02:32:00.954
<v Speaker 5>they're making burritos and then these </v>
<v Speaker 5>goofy white kids are fucking closing </v>

3258
02:32:03.541 --> 02:32:04.374
<v Speaker 5>them down.</v>

3259
02:32:04.440 --> 02:32:07.260
<v Speaker 5>And that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cultural appropriation.</v>

3260
02:32:07.261 --> 02:32:10.800
<v Speaker 5>Heroes just shouting out from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rooftop that you're wrong,</v>

3261
02:32:11.130 --> 02:32:12.570
<v Speaker 5>you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you said,</v>

3262
02:32:12.571 --> 02:32:14.610
<v Speaker 5>we're just always looking for who to </v>
<v Speaker 5>blame,</v>

3263
02:32:14.611 --> 02:32:17.670
<v Speaker 5>who to be mad at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who to make sort of the,</v>

3264
02:32:17.671 --> 02:32:21.420
<v Speaker 5>the persecutor of our felt wrongness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's that same issue.</v>

3265
02:32:21.540 --> 02:32:22.520
<v Speaker 5>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3266
02:32:22.860 --> 02:32:23.693
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is a weird,</v>

3267
02:32:23.850 --> 02:32:26.100
<v Speaker 5>it is a weird time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the trouble is,</v>

3268
02:32:26.250 --> 02:32:27.083
<v Speaker 5>you know that the more that we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this infighting is like in some ways a </v>

3269
02:32:32.821 --> 02:32:33.654
<v Speaker 5>distraction from the greater issues that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are sure government overreach and these </v>

3270
02:32:38.041 --> 02:32:38.874
<v Speaker 5>greater issues that are allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>unfold while we're busy calling each </v>

3271
02:32:40.981 --> 02:32:41.814
<v Speaker 5>other names and you're doing it on </v>
<v Speaker 5>twitter and the government's literally </v>

3272
02:32:43.951 --> 02:32:46.770
<v Speaker 5>reading your emails while you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>it and you're like,</v>

3273
02:32:46.800 --> 02:32:47.633
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we have to worry about this burrito </v>

3274
02:32:48.241 --> 02:32:50.490
<v Speaker 5>stand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think you're finding it salsa?</v>

3275
02:32:50.910 --> 02:32:52.170
<v Speaker 5>You can't have tortillas.</v>

3276
02:32:52.470 --> 02:32:53.303
<v Speaker 5>You're not from here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what is wrong with people that </v>

3277
02:32:57.361 --> 02:32:59.070
<v Speaker 5>never existed before?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like whatever.</v>

3278
02:32:59.250 --> 02:33:01.050
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's what's fascinating.</v>

3279
02:33:01.170 --> 02:33:02.003
<v Speaker 5>It only works if the people that you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>supposedly culturally stealing from our </v>

3280
02:33:06.751 --> 02:33:07.584
<v Speaker 5>brown.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you tried cooking French food </v>

3281
02:33:10.411 --> 02:33:12.630
<v Speaker 5>and you're not a French to send,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody gives a shit.</v>

3282
02:33:13.020 --> 02:33:13.853
<v Speaker 5>You could cook Italian food all day long</v>
<v Speaker 5>and no one cares about copd cultural </v>

3283
02:33:17.221 --> 02:33:18.054
<v Speaker 5>appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you could be a white woman from </v>

3284
02:33:20.011 --> 02:33:20.844
<v Speaker 5>Switzerland who lives in New Jersey and </v>
<v Speaker 5>runs an Italian restaurant and no one </v>

3285
02:33:25.021 --> 02:33:26.700
<v Speaker 5>cares.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They won't care.</v>

3286
02:33:26.790 --> 02:33:27.623
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>arguably they haven't been like </v>

3287
02:33:28.291 --> 02:33:29.124
<v Speaker 5>oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess in the same way where at one </v>

3288
02:33:31.141 --> 02:33:33.440
<v Speaker 5>point in time we just got through it and</v>
<v Speaker 5>techniques.</v>

3289
02:33:33.510 --> 02:33:35.070
<v Speaker 5>It's Mexican,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it mean for real.</v>

3290
02:33:35.071 --> 02:33:35.904
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's literally the path of </v>
<v Speaker 5>boxing in America was it was Jewish </v>

3291
02:33:39.301 --> 02:33:40.590
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Italians,</v>

3292
02:33:40.591 --> 02:33:42.480
<v Speaker 5>Irish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was the suppressed people,</v>

3293
02:33:42.481 --> 02:33:43.314
<v Speaker 5>black folks.</v>

3294
02:33:43.440 --> 02:33:44.273
<v Speaker 5>It was always the people that were the </v>
<v Speaker 5>most economically suppressed that rose </v>

3295
02:33:48.181 --> 02:33:49.014
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they were also like my </v>

3296
02:33:49.801 --> 02:33:53.940
<v Speaker 5>grandparents came from Italy and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>experienced horrible racism back then,</v>

3297
02:33:53.941 --> 02:33:58.140
<v Speaker 5>back in the early 19 hundreds but by the</v>
<v Speaker 5>time they integrate into society,</v>

3298
02:33:58.141 --> 02:34:02.550
<v Speaker 5>like being Italian isn't even thought of</v>
<v Speaker 5>as being not white anymore.</v>

3299
02:34:02.950 --> 02:34:06.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when my grandparents were kids,</v>

3300
02:34:06.001 --> 02:34:07.980
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like being Mexican,</v>

3301
02:34:08.250 --> 02:34:09.083
<v Speaker 5>I was the same kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like you were treated like </v>

3302
02:34:10.890 --> 02:34:13.510
<v Speaker 5>someone from somewhere else that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't want here,</v>

3303
02:34:13.970 --> 02:34:14.803
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they called them Guinea waps and all </v>

3304
02:34:15.931 --> 02:34:17.250
<v Speaker 5>these crazy slangs</v>

3305
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:20.140
<v Speaker 4>horrible expressions that don't even </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean anything anymore.</v>

3306
02:34:20.170 --> 02:34:21.003
<v Speaker 4>Right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so ineffective now and our hope is </v>

3307
02:34:22.721 --> 02:34:25.870
<v Speaker 4>right that one day it's going to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that with Mexicans the same way.</v>

3308
02:34:25.871 --> 02:34:29.050
<v Speaker 4>It's like you can't really mock someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>from being from Holland.</v>

3309
02:34:29.051 --> 02:34:30.400
<v Speaker 4>No one gives a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can say,</v>

3310
02:34:30.401 --> 02:34:31.450
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're from Holland.</v>

3311
02:34:31.451 --> 02:34:32.530
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3312
02:34:32.770 --> 02:34:34.900
<v Speaker 4>like it's not about Quito though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like does that,</v>

3313
02:34:35.220 --> 02:34:36.053
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They call it as themselves Guido's like </v>

3314
02:34:39.230 --> 02:34:40.660
<v Speaker 4>family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They call themselves Guido.</v>

3315
02:34:40.870 --> 02:34:41.703
<v Speaker 4>They'll call themselves guineas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll call themselves and it's like </v>

3316
02:34:43.961 --> 02:34:47.410
<v Speaker 4>almost like a term of endearment and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's power.</v>

3317
02:34:47.411 --> 02:34:49.270
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's totally lost its power because it's</v>

3318
02:34:49.271 --> 02:34:52.480
<v Speaker 4>culturally acceptable to be Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then one day,</v>

3319
02:34:52.510 --> 02:34:53.343
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the idea that these girls are </v>

3320
02:34:54.551 --> 02:34:56.920
<v Speaker 4>stealing from Mexicans where it's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

3321
02:34:56.921 --> 02:34:58.030
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>there's a salad burritos folks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just food.</v>

3323
02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:02.200
<v Speaker 4>It's just a certain way of preparing it.</v>

3324
02:35:02.620 --> 02:35:03.453
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like they're pretending we </v>

3325
02:35:04.091 --> 02:35:06.700
<v Speaker 4>event this and no one else did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a wrap.</v>

3326
02:35:06.970 --> 02:35:09.760
<v Speaker 4>Like the people who make wraps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those should be slapped.</v>

3327
02:35:09.761 --> 02:35:12.010
<v Speaker 4>That's not how rap motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a burrito.</v>

3328
02:35:12.310 --> 02:35:14.860
<v Speaker 4>You're making a Shitty Burrito and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're calling it a wrap.</v>

3329
02:35:15.070 --> 02:35:16.340
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gluten free.</v>

3330
02:35:16.360 --> 02:35:19.390
<v Speaker 4>Those are the real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are the problem people.</v>

3331
02:35:19.391 --> 02:35:22.120
<v Speaker 4>They're calling it wraps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's looks like a Tortilla.</v>

3332
02:35:22.121 --> 02:35:22.561
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3333
02:35:22.561 --> 02:35:25.310
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no rap.</v>

3334
02:35:25.470 --> 02:35:26.710
<v Speaker 4>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did they call,</v>

3335
02:35:26.711 --> 02:35:29.590
<v Speaker 4>did they call a rapid tour in?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say it's a Tortilla.</v>

3336
02:35:30.660 --> 02:35:32.530
<v Speaker 4>What do they call that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Outside of a rap,</v>

3337
02:35:33.070 --> 02:35:34.540
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you come up,</v>

3338
02:35:34.550 --> 02:35:36.850
<v Speaker 4>Dang.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally coopting right.</v>

3339
02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:37.713
<v Speaker 4>That's the real theft is raps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't even taste like if those </v>

3340
02:35:40.091 --> 02:35:41.830
<v Speaker 4>girls were just selling wraps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody be like,</v>

3341
02:35:41.831 --> 02:35:42.431
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's cool.</v>

3342
02:35:42.431 --> 02:35:45.250
<v Speaker 4>It's just a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just mislabeled it.</v>

3343
02:35:45.270 --> 02:35:47.530
<v Speaker 4>As long as you don't have a Mexican flag</v>
<v Speaker 4>anywhere.</v>

3344
02:35:47.630 --> 02:35:49.720
<v Speaker 4>And he like a cartoon of a Chili Pepper.</v>

3345
02:35:53.820 --> 02:35:54.480
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3346
02:35:54.480 --> 02:35:56.610
<v Speaker 4>I really feel like this goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

3347
02:35:56.611 --> 02:35:59.950
<v Speaker 4>it's a stretch granted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I really feel like this goes back to</v>

3348
02:35:59.951 --> 02:36:03.040
<v Speaker 4>what we're talking about is that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>need difficulty in their life.</v>

3349
02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:04.113
<v Speaker 4>They really do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that way they don't seek out </v>

3350
02:36:05.720 --> 02:36:07.750
<v Speaker 4>difficulty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3351
02:36:07.751 --> 02:36:08.620
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>

3352
02:36:08.650 --> 02:36:09.483
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's one of the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 4>why you're getting a lot of this from </v>

3353
02:36:11.450 --> 02:36:15.610
<v Speaker 4>these college kids where their tuition </v>
<v Speaker 4>is being paid for their,</v>

3354
02:36:15.640 --> 02:36:16.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>

3355
02:36:16.540 --> 02:36:19.300
<v Speaker 4>they don't have jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not competing in the real world.</v>

3356
02:36:19.420 --> 02:36:20.253
<v Speaker 4>They're just operating on ideologies and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're being taught by these </v>

3357
02:36:23.321 --> 02:36:24.154
<v Speaker 4>knuckleheads that are just trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>keep their tenure and they're trying to </v>

3358
02:36:26.771 --> 02:36:27.604
<v Speaker 4>spread the same sort of ideology that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they had when they were in college and </v>

3359
02:36:30.431 --> 02:36:33.730
<v Speaker 4>they never really entered into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>workforce in a lot of examples.</v>

3360
02:36:33.731 --> 02:36:37.210
<v Speaker 4>A lot of these people went from academia</v>
<v Speaker 4>to teaching,</v>

3361
02:36:37.270 --> 02:36:37.720
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3362
02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:38.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right in there,</v>

3363
02:36:38.861 --> 02:36:41.380
<v Speaker 4>just embedded into the system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really know,</v>

3364
02:36:42.310 --> 02:36:45.040
<v Speaker 4>hey Ho these racist teachers have got to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

3365
02:36:45.310 --> 02:36:47.050
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just people are going crazy today.</v>

3366
02:36:47.260 --> 02:36:49.390
<v Speaker 4>And I think a lot of it has to do at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same thing.</v>

3367
02:36:49.391 --> 02:36:52.300
<v Speaker 4>I think it's this new found ability to </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate,</v>

3368
02:36:52.301 --> 02:36:55.120
<v Speaker 4>which is fantastic and it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have its hiccups and is going to be some</v>

3369
02:36:55.121 --> 02:36:59.080
<v Speaker 4>issues and he's going to be some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some real coopting of the system,</v>

3370
02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:02.050
<v Speaker 4>like what you're experiencing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>trolls attacking an idea.</v>

3371
02:37:02.380 --> 02:37:03.213
<v Speaker 4>But overall those ideas are spreading in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a way that's unprecedented and </v>

3372
02:37:07.541 --> 02:37:08.374
<v Speaker 4>impossible just a few decades ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like your ideas spreading the way they </v>

3373
02:37:12.341 --> 02:37:15.070
<v Speaker 4>have where I hear about them and now you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

3374
02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:16.040
<v Speaker 4>you and I sit down and</v>

3375
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:16.873
<v Speaker 5>talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Millions of people are going to hear </v>

3376
02:37:17.871 --> 02:37:21.380
<v Speaker 5>this conversation and this and this is </v>
<v Speaker 5>unprecedented.</v>

3377
02:37:21.410 --> 02:37:23.360
<v Speaker 5>Like this has never been available </v>
<v Speaker 5>before.</v>

3378
02:37:23.660 --> 02:37:24.493
<v Speaker 5>So all the bad stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got to take it with all the good </v>

3379
02:37:26.421 --> 02:37:30.470
<v Speaker 5>stuff and it's dark 100% yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like what you expressing,</v>

3380
02:37:30.471 --> 02:37:34.220
<v Speaker 5>what you're trying to get out to people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is all this,</v>

3381
02:37:34.250 --> 02:37:37.400
<v Speaker 5>all new stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like no one was saying this 20 years ago</v>

3382
02:37:38.090 --> 02:37:41.000
<v Speaker 5>because we were all asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's matrix talk.</v>

3383
02:37:41.001 --> 02:37:43.070
<v Speaker 5>This is more hippy talk that you would </v>
<v Speaker 5>hate 20 years ago.</v>

3384
02:37:43.650 --> 02:37:44.720
<v Speaker 5>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

3385
02:37:44.721 --> 02:37:46.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm so crazy when I'm older.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's why it's,</v>

3386
02:37:46.830 --> 02:37:50.900
<v Speaker 5>it is a cool time because it sorta like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the democratization of information where</v>

3387
02:37:50.901 --> 02:37:55.250
<v Speaker 5>if if you want to learn about other </v>
<v Speaker 5>perspectives on anything,</v>

3388
02:37:55.670 --> 02:37:57.050
<v Speaker 5>you look it up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3389
02:37:57.051 --> 02:37:57.884
<v Speaker 5>and then you make your own decision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it is a time where you have the </v>

3390
02:38:00.890 --> 02:38:05.510
<v Speaker 5>potential to be an individual in ways </v>
<v Speaker 5>that were not honored in,</v>

3391
02:38:05.511 --> 02:38:07.220
<v Speaker 5>in more conformist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3392
02:38:07.221 --> 02:38:09.080
<v Speaker 5>controlled media environment.</v>

3393
02:38:09.110 --> 02:38:09.943
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the trouble is that many people are </v>

3394
02:38:10.701 --> 02:38:12.200
<v Speaker 5>still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3395
02:38:13.010 --> 02:38:16.650
<v Speaker 5>still believe that mainstream media is </v>
<v Speaker 5>telling them the truth,</v>

3396
02:38:16.651 --> 02:38:17.031
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3397
02:38:17.031 --> 02:38:19.440
<v Speaker 5>that deconditioning is very challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3398
02:38:19.860 --> 02:38:21.650
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a real problem.</v>

3399
02:38:21.651 --> 02:38:24.500
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think even though like the trump stuff</v>

3400
02:38:24.501 --> 02:38:27.200
<v Speaker 5>with all this fake news talk is so </v>
<v Speaker 5>detrimental,</v>

3401
02:38:27.590 --> 02:38:30.530
<v Speaker 5>ultimately it is like you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

3402
02:38:30.531 --> 02:38:31.364
<v Speaker 5>even if they realize this guy's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>knucklehead and he's wrong about a lot </v>

3403
02:38:33.471 --> 02:38:34.304
<v Speaker 5>of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're gonna,</v>

3404
02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:35.273
<v Speaker 5>they're at least challenging these ideas</v>
<v Speaker 5>that these networks are only giving you </v>

3405
02:38:39.771 --> 02:38:40.970
<v Speaker 5>the news.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3406
02:38:41.180 --> 02:38:45.800
<v Speaker 5>Fox News is a Goddamn sexual assault </v>
<v Speaker 5>paradise over there.</v>

3407
02:38:45.801 --> 02:38:46.370
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>

3408
02:38:46.370 --> 02:38:49.940
<v Speaker 5>these guys just keep getting kicked out </v>
<v Speaker 5>of Fox News over and over again.</v>

3409
02:38:49.970 --> 02:38:50.803
<v Speaker 5>There's all these sexual harassment </v>
<v Speaker 5>allegations and people are resigning </v>

3410
02:38:54.201 --> 02:38:55.190
<v Speaker 5>left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3411
02:38:55.340 --> 02:38:57.200
<v Speaker 5>Well because of all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it makes you go,</v>

3412
02:38:57.230 --> 02:38:58.730
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3413
02:38:58.731 --> 02:38:59.780
<v Speaker 5>these guys are creeps.</v>

3414
02:38:59.810 --> 02:39:00.643
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a lot of creeps even there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when Brian Williams got busted </v>

3415
02:39:03.291 --> 02:39:04.124
<v Speaker 5>lying and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh that news guys just like another </v>

3416
02:39:06.561 --> 02:39:08.630
<v Speaker 5>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just make shit up.</v>

3417
02:39:08.830 --> 02:39:09.663
<v Speaker 5>Like just because he's saying the real </v>
<v Speaker 5>news sometimes doesn't mean everything </v>

3418
02:39:13.431 --> 02:39:16.370
<v Speaker 5>he says is true and there's no way to </v>
<v Speaker 5>filter it.</v>

3419
02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:17.393
<v Speaker 5>So everybody has to question things now </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a way that you never questioned </v>

3420
02:39:20.091 --> 02:39:20.924
<v Speaker 5>during the Walter cronkite era.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know when people were giving the </v>

3421
02:39:23.151 --> 02:39:25.400
<v Speaker 5>news back when Ted Koppel was on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>air,</v>

3422
02:39:25.720 --> 02:39:27.890
<v Speaker 5>you weren't quite like Ted Koppel full </v>
<v Speaker 5>of Shit.</v>

3423
02:39:28.040 --> 02:39:29.870
<v Speaker 5>Like no one was saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3424
02:39:30.860 --> 02:39:31.693
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But Brian Williams is clearly full of </v>

3425
02:39:33.771 --> 02:39:34.604
<v Speaker 5>shit at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why it's weirder now to follow </v>

3426
02:39:36.681 --> 02:39:40.070
<v Speaker 5>mainstream media because if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying that like,</v>

3427
02:39:40.120 --> 02:39:40.953
<v Speaker 5>how are you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you have so much allegiance to </v>

3428
02:39:44.001 --> 02:39:45.980
<v Speaker 5>the machine that you would never </v>
<v Speaker 5>question it?</v>

3429
02:39:46.040 --> 02:39:47.780
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to me that's surprising.</v>

3430
02:39:48.070 --> 02:39:48.903
<v Speaker 5>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that machine is the only vehicle for </v>

3431
02:39:50.841 --> 02:39:51.674
<v Speaker 5>these pharmaceutical companies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have to sandwich those commercials </v>

3432
02:39:54.231 --> 02:39:55.430
<v Speaker 5>in between,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3433
02:39:56.210 --> 02:39:57.043
<v Speaker 5>whatever show you're watching,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's know three 60 whatever the fuck </v>

3434
02:39:59.451 --> 02:40:00.284
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This guy's every 10 minutes and they </v>

3435

<v Speaker 2>what do you hope to really get into </v>

3517
02:44:01.031 --> 02:44:01.864
<v Speaker 2>people's heads with this book and with </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this information and what you've </v>

3518
02:44:05.261 --> 02:44:08.650
<v Speaker 2>gone on in your journey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had to like sum it up?</v>

3519
02:44:11.230 --> 02:44:14.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like when you know better,</v>

3520
02:44:14.321 --> 02:44:16.270
<v Speaker 2>you do better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a Maya angelou quote.</v>

3521
02:44:16.271 --> 02:44:18.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of my favorite quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great quote.</v>

3522
02:44:18.460 --> 02:44:22.150
<v Speaker 2>It is because there's no shaming in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is as good as the fake freud quote.</v>

3523
02:44:23.270 --> 02:44:24.430
<v Speaker 2>When you know better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do better.</v>

3524
02:44:24.431 --> 02:44:28.050
<v Speaker 2>It's really good when Fred said the word</v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole and it um,</v>

3525
02:44:28.570 --> 02:44:32.320
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so with this information,</v>

3526
02:44:33.100 --> 02:44:37.240
<v Speaker 2>is there something in you that's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>excited about it or that says like,</v>

3527
02:44:37.360 --> 02:44:37.901
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3528
02:44:37.901 --> 02:44:40.660
<v Speaker 2>there's something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if there is,</v>

3529
02:44:40.690 --> 02:44:43.180
<v Speaker 2>then you should know what's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3530
02:44:43.181 --> 02:44:44.014
<v Speaker 2>Because if you know it's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you will naturally move towards </v>

3531
02:44:46.451 --> 02:44:49.360
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the transformations that I have seen</v>

3532
02:44:49.361 --> 02:44:50.194
<v Speaker 2>and continue to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like I could cry thinking about </v>

3533
02:44:51.851 --> 02:44:52.684
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so deeply inspirational because </v>

3534
02:44:54.701 --> 02:44:57.790
<v Speaker 2>it's a kind of human experience that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>so redemptive.</v>

3535
02:44:57.790 --> 02:44:58.623
<v Speaker 2>It's like a real reclamation that is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible through the pharmaceutical </v>

3536
02:45:01.901 --> 02:45:02.734
<v Speaker 2>model in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to tell you a quick story about </v>

3537
02:45:04.691 --> 02:45:07.060
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics cause you brought this up </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier.</v>

3538
02:45:07.510 --> 02:45:09.010
<v Speaker 2>So I went to India recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3539
02:45:10.060 --> 02:45:14.860
<v Speaker 2>And I bought some antibiotics when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>got back and we never take,</v>

3540
02:45:14.890 --> 02:45:16.180
<v Speaker 2>I would never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't take any farms.</v>

3541
02:45:16.570 --> 02:45:19.960
<v Speaker 2>You don't take antibiotics ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if you've got an infection?</v>

3542
02:45:19.961 --> 02:45:20.794
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've got staff then I'll tell you </v>

3543
02:45:21.461 --> 02:45:22.960
<v Speaker 2>exactly what would happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3544
02:45:22.990 --> 02:45:25.630
<v Speaker 2>So I went to India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought my little kit with me.</v>

3545
02:45:25.631 --> 02:45:27.280
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Knowing that there's like,</v>

3546
02:45:27.540 --> 02:45:28.373
<v Speaker 2>and honestly like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in germ theory in the </v>

3547
02:45:31.601 --> 02:45:34.540
<v Speaker 2>classical sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know and neither should anyone.</v>

3548
02:45:34.541 --> 02:45:37.330
<v Speaker 2>Germ theory is like if you're exposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bad bug,</v>

3549
02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:39.220
<v Speaker 2>then you get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3550
02:45:39.221 --> 02:45:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Exposure equals infection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3551
02:45:41.980 --> 02:45:45.580
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pester himself on his deathbed said that</v>

3552
02:45:45.581 --> 02:45:47.690
<v Speaker 2>it was the terrain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the bug.</v>

3553
02:45:47.690 --> 02:45:50.380
<v Speaker 2>So what's the terrain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The terrain is the context.</v>

3554
02:45:50.381 --> 02:45:54.420
<v Speaker 2>The terrain is your body in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle and you know,</v>

3555
02:45:54.421 --> 02:45:58.300
<v Speaker 2>in your existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that seems to be more relevant.</v>

3556
02:45:58.301 --> 02:46:00.400
<v Speaker 2>And then the discovery of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>microbiome,</v>

3557
02:46:00.401 --> 02:46:01.234
<v Speaker 2>like this inner ecology has totally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to go back to the drawing board </v>

3558
02:46:04.150 --> 02:46:07.440
<v Speaker 2>completely in medicine because we didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that before.</v>

3559
02:46:07.441 --> 02:46:09.070
<v Speaker 2>We soon as the discovery of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>microbiome.</v>

3560
02:46:09.110 --> 02:46:12.170
<v Speaker 2>It's about like 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years and 20 years.</v>

3561
02:46:12.171 --> 02:46:16.400
<v Speaker 2>We've the science of probiotics and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3562
02:46:16.410 --> 02:46:20.170
<v Speaker 2>and understanding the importance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consuming fermented foods and,</v>

3563
02:46:20.990 --> 02:46:21.823
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super infections through antibiotic </v>

3564
02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:24.433
<v Speaker 2>overuse and the fact that you can't ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out from under this idea of just </v>

3565
02:46:27.471 --> 02:46:30.290
<v Speaker 2>killing the bad bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work.</v>

3566
02:46:30.291 --> 02:46:31.124
<v Speaker 2>And so the more you sanitize and you use</v>
<v Speaker 2>bleach and alcohol and prl and all that </v>

3567
02:46:34.221 --> 02:46:35.054
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're actually distorting things and </v>

3568
02:46:36.681 --> 02:46:37.514
<v Speaker 2>you're making it more likely for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>to develop what are called nosocomial </v>

3569
02:46:41.181 --> 02:46:44.360
<v Speaker 2>illnesses or infections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is hospital induced infections,</v>

3570
02:46:44.361 --> 02:46:44.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3571
02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:45.433
<v Speaker 2>This is the hospital as a sick </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment in part because we have a </v>

3572
02:46:47.301 --> 02:46:51.740
<v Speaker 2>wrong idea about how biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>ecosystems work.</v>

3573
02:46:51.770 --> 02:46:54.530
<v Speaker 2>There's no bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything works together.</v>

3574
02:46:54.531 --> 02:46:56.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like a metaphor for life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

3575
02:46:56.151 --> 02:46:58.040
<v Speaker 2>there aren't really any bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all,</v>

3576
02:46:58.460 --> 02:46:59.293
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is sort of part of the polarity of life </v>

3577
02:47:01.910 --> 02:47:03.860
<v Speaker 2>we need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need bad to know where good,</v>

3578
02:47:03.861 --> 02:47:06.860
<v Speaker 2>like it's that ancient philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

3579
02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:10.910
<v Speaker 2>so we go to India and I bring bentonite </v>
<v Speaker 2>clay,</v>

3580
02:47:10.911 --> 02:47:13.970
<v Speaker 2>I bring colloidal silver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bring a bunch of little silver.</v>

3581
02:47:14.060 --> 02:47:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that as a real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the stuff that you like.</v>

3582
02:47:17.151 --> 02:47:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Do you use like a little electrodes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3583
02:47:19.440 --> 02:47:21.060
<v Speaker 2>stick the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the water,</v>

3584
02:47:21.090 --> 02:47:21.923
<v Speaker 2>the stick to that or you just rely on </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to make that forward in a </v>

3585
02:47:25.041 --> 02:47:27.710
<v Speaker 2>responsible way then that turned some </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude glue?</v>

3586
02:47:27.711 --> 02:47:28.544
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3587
02:47:28.750 --> 02:47:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can do that if you ask the wrong,</v>

3588
02:47:32.570 --> 02:47:36.040
<v Speaker 2>if you're using large particles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an Avatar lady,</v>

3589
02:47:36.050 --> 02:47:37.020
<v Speaker 2>you're having a good work.</v>

3590
02:47:37.090 --> 02:47:37.923
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would undermine my </v>

3591
02:47:38.601 --> 02:47:40.480
<v Speaker 2>credibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know freaky.</v>

3592
02:47:40.930 --> 02:47:44.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm super healthy but I'm blue is fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>that poor guy.</v>

3593
02:47:44.891 --> 02:47:46.170
<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh,</v>

3594
02:47:47.010 --> 02:47:49.310
<v Speaker 2>that's a reversible apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3595
02:47:49.311 --> 02:47:50.144
<v Speaker 2>That's not what we're going for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why as a diy it may not be the </v>

3596
02:47:53.631 --> 02:47:56.390
<v Speaker 2>best idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So does colonial silver,</v>

3597
02:47:56.391 --> 02:47:58.090
<v Speaker 2>what's the benefits of cool?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3598
02:47:58.130 --> 02:47:58.963
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like herbal [inaudible] like </v>

3599
02:48:00.380 --> 02:48:02.300
<v Speaker 2>botanical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3600
02:48:02.301 --> 02:48:05.390
<v Speaker 2>sort of like antimicrobials if you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to call them that.</v>

3601
02:48:06.410 --> 02:48:07.243
<v Speaker 2>They don't kill stuff there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they have like a rebalancing </v>

3602
02:48:10.851 --> 02:48:11.750
<v Speaker 2>effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there,</v>

3603
02:48:11.930 --> 02:48:13.820
<v Speaker 2>you know for like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3604
02:48:13.821 --> 02:48:14.654
<v Speaker 2>CBO,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is small intestinal bacterial </v>

3605
02:48:15.531 --> 02:48:16.364
<v Speaker 2>overgrowth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a thing people are struggling </v>

3606
02:48:18.051 --> 02:48:20.090
<v Speaker 2>with that a lot of functional medicine </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctors treat.</v>

3607
02:48:20.350 --> 02:48:21.183
<v Speaker 2>There is randomized trial looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics versus herbal botanicals </v>

3608
02:48:24.650 --> 02:48:26.720
<v Speaker 2>showing herbal botanicals are as </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective.</v>

3609
02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:29.870
<v Speaker 2>So why would you ever bother with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>risks of antibiotics,</v>

3610
02:48:29.871 --> 02:48:31.040
<v Speaker 2>which are legion?</v>

3611
02:48:31.040 --> 02:48:34.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're massive risks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Botanicals are specifically,</v>

3612
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:37.250
<v Speaker 2>especially things like oil of Oregano </v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

3613
02:48:37.251 --> 02:48:39.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of the better studied </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones,</v>

3614
02:48:39.681 --> 02:48:41.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grapefruit seed extract there,</v>

3615
02:48:41.930 --> 02:48:44.240
<v Speaker 2>Pau d'arco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole number of them.</v>

3616
02:48:44.241 --> 02:48:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Golden Seal like in Asia that have these</v>
<v Speaker 2>properties and a lot of supplements just</v>

3617
02:48:48.981 --> 02:48:51.200
<v Speaker 2>sort of put them all together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3618
02:48:51.290 --> 02:48:53.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm making this story too long.</v>

3619
02:48:53.331 --> 02:48:55.070
<v Speaker 2>So I go to India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bring all this stuff right.</v>

3620
02:48:55.310 --> 02:48:56.143
<v Speaker 2>And one of the women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a Kundalini trip and one of </v>

3621
02:48:57.801 --> 02:48:58.634
<v Speaker 2>the women gets really sick like Cru,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like projectile vomiting and like </v>

3622
02:49:02.991 --> 02:49:05.330
<v Speaker 2>screaming in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like bad scene.</v>

3623
02:49:05.690 --> 02:49:07.890
<v Speaker 2>I left right before you got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming in pain.</v>

3624
02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:10.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought she was just puking.</v>

3625
02:49:10.530 --> 02:49:11.660
<v Speaker 3>I know it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

3626
02:49:11.661 --> 02:49:12.950
<v Speaker 3>she was super sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3627
02:49:12.951 --> 02:49:16.520
<v Speaker 3>And even the Indian dude who was sorta </v>
<v Speaker 3>like our chaperone in a way,</v>

3628
02:49:16.521 --> 02:49:19.310
<v Speaker 3>like a friend of the woman who led the </v>
<v Speaker 3>led the trip was like,</v>

3629
02:49:19.311 --> 02:49:20.144
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got to bring her to the hospital </v>

3630
02:49:21.261 --> 02:49:21.770
<v Speaker 3>hospital.</v>

3631
02:49:21.770 --> 02:49:22.670
<v Speaker 4>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3632
02:49:22.671 --> 02:49:23.840
<v Speaker 4>I've got to give her clue silver.</v>

3633
02:49:23.910 --> 02:49:25.650
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gimme 12 hours,</v>

3634
02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:26.940
<v Speaker 3>just really cute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked him in the eyes,</v>

3635
02:49:26.941 --> 02:49:27.774
<v Speaker 3>it's like gave me 12 hours and I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>her well enough to know that she would </v>

3636
02:49:32.431 --> 02:49:34.890
<v Speaker 3>be down for this approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3637
02:49:35.250 --> 02:49:37.500
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she was not afraid,</v>

3638
02:49:37.770 --> 02:49:39.690
<v Speaker 3>important detail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's not afraid.</v>

3639
02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:40.673
<v Speaker 3>She was super uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she wasn't like freaking out and </v>

3640
02:49:42.781 --> 02:49:43.261
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

3641
02:49:43.261 --> 02:49:44.490
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3642
02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:46.980
<v Speaker 3>She just thought she was sick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is true.</v>

3643
02:49:47.310 --> 02:49:51.660
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in 12 hours she was completely,</v>

3644
02:49:51.661 --> 02:49:53.520
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were in the car for a two hour trip,</v>

3645
02:49:53.521 --> 02:49:56.010
<v Speaker 3>going to like another part of northern </v>
<v Speaker 3>India.</v>

3646
02:49:56.190 --> 02:50:00.630
<v Speaker 3>And how did you cure or treat her?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She may very well have done it herself.</v>

3647
02:50:00.631 --> 02:50:01.464
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the ritual of these supplements and </v>

3648
02:50:02.791 --> 02:50:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Bentonite Clay and whatever could have </v>
<v Speaker 3>just been an accessory.</v>

3649
02:50:05.431 --> 02:50:06.360
<v Speaker 3>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows.</v>

3650
02:50:06.361 --> 02:50:09.210
<v Speaker 3>The truth is that if she had taken </v>
<v Speaker 3>antibiotics,</v>

3651
02:50:09.211 --> 02:50:12.780
<v Speaker 3>which she never did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if she had taken them reflexively,</v>

3652
02:50:13.140 --> 02:50:14.910
<v Speaker 3>she probably would have been sick </v>
<v Speaker 3>longer.</v>

3653
02:50:15.420 --> 02:50:17.190
<v Speaker 3>And she then ultimately when she got </v>
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

3654
02:50:17.191 --> 02:50:19.680
<v Speaker 3>what have attributed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the end of antibiotics.</v>

3655
02:50:19.681 --> 02:50:19.970
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

3656
02:50:19.970 --> 02:50:20.803
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she never would have had the </v>

3657
02:50:21.601 --> 02:50:24.090
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to just see what her body's </v>
<v Speaker 3>capable of.</v>

3658
02:50:24.750 --> 02:50:25.583
<v Speaker 3>So we make these assumptions about </v>
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceuticals in the absence of any </v>

3659
02:50:29.251 --> 02:50:30.084
<v Speaker 3>baseline evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>information or even experience to help </v>

3660
02:50:33.631 --> 02:50:35.640
<v Speaker 3>us understand what our bodies are </v>
<v Speaker 3>capable of.</v>

3661
02:50:35.730 --> 02:50:39.720
<v Speaker 4>But what if someone catches one of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>antibiotic resistant,</v>

3662
02:50:39.750 --> 02:50:41.010
<v Speaker 4>very aggressive</v>

3663
02:50:41.510 --> 02:50:45.710
<v Speaker 3>strains like Marissa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3664
02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:46.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

3665
02:50:46.940 --> 02:50:50.120
<v Speaker 3>so my partner has a website called green</v>
<v Speaker 3>med info comm,</v>

3666
02:50:50.121 --> 02:50:51.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it called?</v>

3667
02:50:51.050 --> 02:50:53.900
<v Speaker 3>Green Med info.green</v>
<v Speaker 3>Med info.com</v>

3668
02:50:53.920 --> 02:50:57.770
<v Speaker 3>and he catalogs all of the data from Pub</v>
<v Speaker 3>med.gov</v>

3669
02:50:58.070 --> 02:51:02.390
<v Speaker 3>on these natural substances evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>that shows that something like garlic,</v>

3670
02:51:02.930 --> 02:51:03.763
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause there's a study he put up on on </v>

3671
02:51:05.230 --> 02:51:09.860
<v Speaker 3>and I think it was like garlic and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>honey or something you would laugh at,</v>

3672
02:51:09.861 --> 02:51:10.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3673
02:51:10.170 --> 02:51:12.000
<v Speaker 4>Doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rhonda Patrick went through this and she</v>

3674
02:51:12.001 --> 02:51:13.610
<v Speaker 4>talked about on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she had a,</v>

3675
02:51:13.630 --> 02:51:17.700
<v Speaker 4>an persistent staph infection that would</v>
<v Speaker 4>not go away and treat.</v>

3676
02:51:17.701 --> 02:51:20.600
<v Speaker 4>She treated it with garlic and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3677
02:51:20.620 --> 02:51:23.910
<v Speaker 4>in a topical form and it cured it when </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing else would.</v>

3678
02:51:23.911 --> 02:51:24.744
<v Speaker 4>And she had gone through this host of </v>
<v Speaker 4>antibiotics that really wrecked her gut </v>

3679
02:51:28.021 --> 02:51:31.260
<v Speaker 4>biome and she was really fucked up for </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a year because of it.</v>

3680
02:51:31.500 --> 02:51:34.350
<v Speaker 4>And she treated with a topical </v>
<v Speaker 4>application of garlic,</v>

3681
02:51:34.590 --> 02:51:35.430
<v Speaker 4>which is crazy.</v>

3682
02:51:35.550 --> 02:51:38.520
<v Speaker 3>And it sounds crazy until you actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>learned that there's,</v>

3683
02:51:38.550 --> 02:51:41.160
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't know that there's actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>science to support that.</v>

3684
02:51:41.580 --> 02:51:44.430
<v Speaker 3>So there's a ton of science to support </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural medicine.</v>

3685
02:51:44.431 --> 02:51:45.264
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who funds these studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy that they're even done </v>

3686
02:51:47.161 --> 02:51:49.740
<v Speaker 3>because there certainly isn't Pharma </v>
<v Speaker 3>money behind them,</v>

3687
02:51:49.950 --> 02:51:51.990
<v Speaker 3>but they are done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you know about them,</v>

3688
02:51:51.991 --> 02:51:54.240
<v Speaker 3>it might help you to make an informed </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision.</v>

3689
02:51:54.690 --> 02:51:57.300
<v Speaker 3>But this is reflexive assumption that </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3690
02:51:57.301 --> 02:51:58.134
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical medicine is the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>legit choice if it gets bad enough is </v>

3691
02:52:01.711 --> 02:52:03.480
<v Speaker 3>conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all I'm saying.</v>

3692
02:52:03.481 --> 02:52:06.010
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a conditioned assumption.</v>

3693
02:52:06.220 --> 02:52:08.830
<v Speaker 3>And if you have an experience that </v>
<v Speaker 3>defies that,</v>

3694
02:52:09.340 --> 02:52:11.650
<v Speaker 3>then you'll make different decisions for</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself in the future.</v>

3695
02:52:11.651 --> 02:52:12.484
<v Speaker 3>But you have to have like that woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>will probably make different decisions </v>

3696
02:52:15.221 --> 02:52:16.054
<v Speaker 3>for herself in the future because now </v>
<v Speaker 3>she trusts her body like just a little </v>

3697
02:52:18.551 --> 02:52:19.900
<v Speaker 3>bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3698
02:52:19.901 --> 02:52:24.280
<v Speaker 3>she's that much less afraid of all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the horror stories.</v>

3699
02:52:24.281 --> 02:52:28.750
<v Speaker 3>The fearmongering is the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>marketing device,</v>

3700
02:52:29.170 --> 02:52:30.003
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>employed by the industry is scaring you </v>

3701
02:52:32.411 --> 02:52:34.570
<v Speaker 3>into what if you don't do it.</v>

3702
02:52:35.350 --> 02:52:36.183
<v Speaker 4>Bunch of people that like when they do </v>
<v Speaker 4>catch Murcia or something like that and </v>

3703
02:52:39.611 --> 02:52:44.611
<v Speaker 4>then get devastated like the right move </v>
<v Speaker 4>is to get on an IV antibiotic.</v>

3704
02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:47.580
<v Speaker 4>Like is isn't that sometimes</v>

3705
02:52:47.800 --> 02:52:50.760
<v Speaker 3>you just told me a story where that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not true.</v>

3706
02:52:51.130 --> 02:52:53.520
<v Speaker 3>What told you a story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3707
02:52:53.521 --> 02:52:54.354
<v Speaker 3>so then what is one but it's one and she</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a topical issue but if it's one in </v>

3708
02:53:00.001 --> 02:53:03.300
<v Speaker 3>you're the one then that's important </v>
<v Speaker 3>information for yourself.</v>

3709
02:53:03.320 --> 02:53:05.070
<v Speaker 3>It certainly is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean antibiotics</v>

3710
02:53:05.320 --> 02:53:06.153
<v Speaker 4>but I mean don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't they serve a purpose in some </v>

3711
02:53:07.781 --> 02:53:09.550
<v Speaker 4>functions sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3712
02:53:09.790 --> 02:53:11.620
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to throw the baby out </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the bath water,</v>

3713
02:53:11.621 --> 02:53:12.311
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3714
02:53:12.311 --> 02:53:15.280
<v Speaker 4>if someone has some rapid aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 4>infection,</v>

3715
02:53:15.281 --> 02:53:16.480
<v Speaker 4>a bacterial infection,</v>

3716
02:53:17.560 --> 02:53:21.820
<v Speaker 3>if we only used antibiotics for true </v>
<v Speaker 3>life or death emergencies,</v>

3717
02:53:22.030 --> 02:53:25.630
<v Speaker 3>we would have a very different situation</v>
<v Speaker 3>on our hands than what we have now,</v>

3718
02:53:26.050 --> 02:53:28.270
<v Speaker 3>which is a combination of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3719
02:53:28.271 --> 02:53:30.640
<v Speaker 3>devastating our ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3720
02:53:30.641 --> 02:53:31.474
<v Speaker 3>making people gravely ill because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have very serious and totally </v>

3721
02:53:34.481 --> 02:53:38.320
<v Speaker 3>unpredictable side effects including </v>
<v Speaker 3>longterm neurologic side effects.</v>

3722
02:53:38.680 --> 02:53:40.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3723
02:53:40.270 --> 02:53:41.260
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3724
02:53:41.560 --> 02:53:42.393
<v Speaker 3>what's even going on with our livestock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we are in a mess with our worship </v>

3725
02:53:46.120 --> 02:53:47.630
<v Speaker 3>of this idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

3726
02:53:47.650 --> 02:53:50.230
<v Speaker 3>and you know what antibiotic means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means against life.</v>

3727
02:53:50.231 --> 02:53:53.830
<v Speaker 3>Like literally there's something wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>headed about that mentality.</v>

3728
02:53:53.831 --> 02:53:56.020
<v Speaker 3>And so it comes back to philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3729
02:53:56.140 --> 02:53:58.090
<v Speaker 3>if you want to believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in war,</v>

3730
02:53:58.300 --> 02:53:59.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to war against your body,</v>

3731
02:53:59.891 --> 02:54:00.724
<v Speaker 3>you want to war against and blame all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bad people who do all this bad </v>

3732
02:54:03.191 --> 02:54:06.190
<v Speaker 3>things and you want to lock them up in </v>
<v Speaker 3>prisons and you want to hate the,</v>

3733
02:54:06.460 --> 02:54:08.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3734
02:54:08.591 --> 02:54:10.910
<v Speaker 3>Arabs and terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if that's fair,</v>

3735
02:54:11.610 --> 02:54:12.443
<v Speaker 3>but if that's your general vibe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's gonna make sense to take </v>

3736
02:54:15.731 --> 02:54:17.380
<v Speaker 3>medications like that for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3737
02:54:17.381 --> 02:54:18.160
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3738
02:54:18.160 --> 02:54:22.210
<v Speaker 3>have plenty of colleagues and myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a different philosophy.</v>

3739
02:54:22.211 --> 02:54:25.570
<v Speaker 3>So that's why it comes down to it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>

3740
02:54:25.660 --> 02:54:26.493
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really comes down to your belief </v>

3741
02:54:27.071 --> 02:54:27.904
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

3742
02:54:27.910 --> 02:54:28.743
<v Speaker 4>So your philosophy is improve the health</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the gut biome taken natural </v>

3743
02:54:33.071 --> 02:54:35.350
<v Speaker 4>antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things like garlic,</v>

3744
02:54:35.351 --> 02:54:37.890
<v Speaker 4>things like Oregano oil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that are nature.</v>

3745
02:54:37.890 --> 02:54:38.723
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

3746
02:54:38.850 --> 02:54:40.710
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get back to the continuum.</v>

3747
02:54:40.711 --> 02:54:41.940
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3748
02:54:41.941 --> 02:54:46.440
<v Speaker 3>there's this notion that there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a path where meant to walk,</v>

3749
02:54:46.441 --> 02:54:49.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we sort of follow our,</v>

3750
02:54:49.921 --> 02:54:54.360
<v Speaker 3>what our ancestors sort of set us up for</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we've strayed from it big time.</v>

3751
02:54:54.361 --> 02:54:57.420
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're in some ways being reminded,</v>

3752
02:54:57.421 --> 02:54:58.254
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we can't go too much farther </v>

3753
02:54:59.700 --> 02:55:02.370
<v Speaker 3>without like struggling pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously.</v>

3754
02:55:02.490 --> 02:55:04.040
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the big</v>

3755
02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:05.930
<v Speaker 2>points that you just made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really huge,</v>

3756
02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:10.960
<v Speaker 2>is that if we only used antibiotics when</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary in life or death situations,</v>

3757
02:55:11.420 --> 02:55:14.510
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't have the issues that we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now with livestock,</v>

3758
02:55:14.511 --> 02:55:15.344
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with people's House and the people take </v>

3759
02:55:16.881 --> 02:55:17.714
<v Speaker 2>z packs like it's going out of style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they take them out to take </v>

3760
02:55:19.701 --> 02:55:20.534
<v Speaker 2>tylenol for a headache.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know so many people that take </v>

3761
02:55:22.701 --> 02:55:24.890
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just throw him down.</v>

3762
02:55:25.140 --> 02:55:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel so much better.</v>

3763
02:55:26.071 --> 02:55:26.904
<v Speaker 2>I took a z pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you might feel better because you </v>

3764
02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:29.673
<v Speaker 2>going to feel better anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the z pack he just threw on top of </v>

3765
02:55:32.001 --> 02:55:35.510
<v Speaker 2>the mix and decided that that was what </v>
<v Speaker 2>was taking you over the top.</v>

3766
02:55:35.720 --> 02:55:36.441
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

3767
02:55:36.441 --> 02:55:39.170
<v Speaker 2>it's like in the water supply now is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>z packs,</v>

3768
02:55:39.350 --> 02:55:42.110
<v Speaker 2>but it's like microscopic levels that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't really,</v>

3769
02:55:42.290 --> 02:55:44.060
<v Speaker 2>they're not psychoactive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3770
02:55:44.090 --> 02:55:44.670
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

3771
02:55:44.670 --> 02:55:47.540
<v Speaker 2>There was just this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was just something I put on social</v>

3772
02:55:47.541 --> 02:55:48.374
<v Speaker 2>media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like studying fish that are </v>

3773
02:55:51.231 --> 02:55:56.231
<v Speaker 2>exposed to antidepressant water and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>became like more aggressive.</v>

3774
02:55:57.470 --> 02:55:58.990
<v Speaker 2>Something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3775
02:55:59.180 --> 02:56:00.013
<v Speaker 2>fish aren't made happier by but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is that antidepressants </v>

3776
02:56:02.511 --> 02:56:03.344
<v Speaker 2>are just in the water supply now to </v>
<v Speaker 2>products apparently in dosages relevant </v>

3777
02:56:07.101 --> 02:56:09.800
<v Speaker 2>to the clinical expression of fish </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

3778
02:56:09.801 --> 02:56:12.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Jesus Christ.</v>

3779
02:56:12.600 --> 02:56:14.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no free lunch.</v>

3780
02:56:14.511 --> 02:56:16.100
<v Speaker 2>There's no free lunch with Pharma I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

3781
02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:19.220
<v Speaker 2>But if you're in a fishing that's good </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you want fish to be aggressive.</v>

3782
02:56:19.330 --> 02:56:22.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe they don't want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give a fuck what they want.</v>

3783
02:56:22.311 --> 02:56:23.144
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to eat chill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen one fisher just eating </v>

3784
02:56:27.891 --> 02:56:30.320
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mostly other fish are a bunch of goddamn</v>

3785
02:56:30.380 --> 02:56:32.030
<v Speaker 2>cannibals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them.</v>

3786
02:56:32.630 --> 02:56:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3787
02:56:35.090 --> 02:56:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Silly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>silly thoughts.</v>

3788
02:56:36.740 --> 02:56:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for indulging in those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

3789
02:56:38.420 --> 02:56:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and thanks for coming on here.</v>

3790
02:56:39.921 --> 02:56:41.480
<v Speaker 2>I really appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just sent three hours.</v>

3791
02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:42.840
<v Speaker 2>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3792
02:56:43.580 --> 02:56:44.413
<v Speaker 2>Quite an attention span.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you do not need to add or all you're </v>

3793
02:56:46.431 --> 02:56:50.630
<v Speaker 2>doing just I'm scared of that or all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd had two cups of coffee though,</v>

3794
02:56:50.810 --> 02:56:54.470
<v Speaker 2>but if I had adderall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want to try one day,</v>

3795
02:56:54.950 --> 02:56:55.783
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrified of it and Canadian study </v>

3796
02:56:57.531 --> 02:57:00.440
<v Speaker 2>just came out that if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take a stimulant,</v>

3797
02:57:00.441 --> 02:57:04.700
<v Speaker 2>you're 13 times more likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>prescribed and it's a psychotic and four</v>

3798
02:57:04.701 --> 02:57:06.920
<v Speaker 2>times more likely to be prescribed </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canadian.</v>

3799
02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:08.033
<v Speaker 2>Like regular people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's totally different kind of </v>

3800
02:57:09.351 --> 02:57:10.550
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very important.</v>

3801
02:57:10.730 --> 02:57:14.780
<v Speaker 2>Super important to confounding variables</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the woods.</v>

3802
02:57:15.080 --> 02:57:17.180
<v Speaker 2>They're forest folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3803
02:57:19.010 --> 02:57:21.290
<v Speaker 2>All right Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one more time to tell people.</v>

3804
02:57:21.650 --> 02:57:23.420
<v Speaker 2>What does the name of your book where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get it?</v>

3805
02:57:23.780 --> 02:57:27.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you're going to get a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive and negative stay offline for a</v>

3806
02:57:27.740 --> 02:57:28.573
<v Speaker 2>couple of days.</v>

3807
02:57:28.800 --> 02:57:32.630
<v Speaker 2>Just I do have your back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just telling you I don't want,</v>

3808
02:57:32.870 --> 02:57:35.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to get hit with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trolls.</v>

3809
02:57:35.930 --> 02:57:36.763
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

3810
02:57:37.490 --> 02:57:39.020
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important.</v>

3811
02:57:39.080 --> 02:57:41.930
<v Speaker 2>It's my disclaimer that I'm not here to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell anyone what to do,</v>

3812
02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:45.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just about informed consent.</v>

3813
02:57:45.320 --> 02:57:46.153
<v Speaker 2>And if you know all the information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want it to continue making your </v>

3814
02:57:47.601 --> 02:57:48.434
<v Speaker 2>choice do you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do believe people are entitled to </v>

3815
02:57:51.080 --> 02:57:53.900
<v Speaker 2>all of the Information and I didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it when I was prescribing,</v>

3816
02:57:53.901 --> 02:57:55.810
<v Speaker 2>so I carry that charge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

<v Speaker 2>own and,</v>
