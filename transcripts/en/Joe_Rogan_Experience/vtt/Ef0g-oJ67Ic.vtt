00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.220
<v Speaker 1>I've been baking bread lately.</v>

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

4
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Sour dough bread.</v>

5
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.341
<v Speaker 1>Sourdough bread.</v>

6
00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:09.210
<v Speaker 1>It's very good for you.</v>

7
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:09.691
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

8
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Has Gluten though.</v>

9
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Natural process.</v>

11
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 1>But sour dough bread apparently has way less gluten than regular bread.</v>

12
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

13
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

14
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Cause my wife can eat that mechanic.</v>

16
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.780
<v Speaker 1>The other brand really.</v>

17
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.341
<v Speaker 1>It's a cool thing.</v>

18
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:24.390
<v Speaker 1>It just takes the,</v>

19
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.950
<v Speaker 1>you just take flour and water.</v>

20
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:26.940
<v Speaker 1>You need a starter,</v>

21
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>which is culture.</v>

22
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

23
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.091
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

24
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:34.200
<v Speaker 1>You just start with a flour and water and the natural yeast that comes from</v>

25
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:38.370
<v Speaker 1>around us in the environment goes in and starts eating that.</v>

26
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

27
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 1>And it becomes a living thing and people have starters that have like a hundred</v>

28
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.500
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>

29
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.090
<v Speaker 1>You take,</v>

30
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 1>you take a couple ounces off and you always maintain a little and feed it like a</v>

31
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:49.284
<v Speaker 1>living thing.</v>

32
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like a bowl of flour and water.</v>

33
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

34
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.660
<v Speaker 1>you'll see it start to bubble when you feed it more flour and water east to</v>

35
00:00:55.661 --> 00:00:56.110
<v Speaker 1>seating it.</v>

36
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.630
<v Speaker 1>It's the coolest.</v>

38
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

39
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>So it's in your refrigerator.</v>

40
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:01.030
<v Speaker 1>Like what's in my fridge?</v>

41
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Like a little little a mason jar.</v>

42
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

43
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.370
<v Speaker 1>And then you scoop it out,</v>

44
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.030
<v Speaker 1>you just take a little chunk of it in the feed it and it expands,</v>

45
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 1>and then you take some of that and make bread out of it.</v>

46
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>That is fucking nuts.</v>

47
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.943
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty,</v>

48
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

49
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.210
<v Speaker 1>So never would have been into this if I didn't hear that concept.</v>

50
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:20.850
<v Speaker 1>And now I can't stop baking bread,</v>

51
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:22.320
<v Speaker 1>like Little Red Riding Hood.</v>

52
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Who gave you the idea to do this?</v>

53
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:27.180
<v Speaker 1>This writer friend of mine,</v>

54
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>he's been doing it for a long time and he said,</v>

55
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:29.580
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

56
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>you just have sourdough bread and the kids love it and wow.</v>

57
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>I just started doing it and uh,</v>

58
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.540
<v Speaker 1>I just got hooked on it.</v>

59
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.770
<v Speaker 1>What do you buy your starter?</v>

60
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 1>You don't buy it.</v>

61
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.200
<v Speaker 1>You can just start it.</v>

62
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.733
<v Speaker 1>Make a starter,</v>

63
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 1>make a starter.</v>

64
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.231
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

65
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:43.950
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>

66
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.210
<v Speaker 1>You just take some flour and water and put it out on the,</v>

67
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.770
<v Speaker 1>on the counter.</v>

68
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.490
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

69
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's measurements and stuff,</v>

71
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.513
<v Speaker 1>but that's it.</v>

72
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.200
<v Speaker 1>And then the natural yeast,</v>

73
00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:57.150
<v Speaker 1>there's east around us just floating around.</v>

74
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 1>That explains a lot of things.</v>

75
00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

76
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.110
<v Speaker 1>And it goes into,</v>

77
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>it goes into the,</v>

78
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:03.564
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

79
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.880
<v Speaker 1>into the concoction and as you'll see,</v>

80
00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>it starts to bubble and get lighter and you feed it some more and it gets</v>

81
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:09.150
<v Speaker 1>bigger.</v>

82
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.360
<v Speaker 1>When you say feed it like for you,</v>

83
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.573
<v Speaker 1>cause it's sweet.</v>

84
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.833
<v Speaker 1>It's like a yeast,</v>

85
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.490
<v Speaker 1>a little like a little community,</v>

86
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.280
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

87
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Feeding it equal parts.</v>

88
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.330
<v Speaker 1>A flour and water.</v>

89
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

90
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.483
<v Speaker 1>And it eats it.</v>

91
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>And now it's like this living thing in the house who has a star that's a hundred</v>

92
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.140
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>

93
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>I went to buy a Dutch oven,</v>

94
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>which is like a pot that you can bake.</v>

95
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.050
<v Speaker 1>You put the bread in and this old guy was like,</v>

96
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.183
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

97
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Even the guy who Williamson,</v>

98
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.411
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

99
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:38.460
<v Speaker 1>six foot lanky.</v>

100
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.320
<v Speaker 1>What do you need it for?</v>

101
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.333
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

102
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make some bread.</v>

103
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

104
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 1>I've been making bread for a long time.</v>

105
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.093
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

106
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be making sourdough bread.</v>

107
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.633
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

108
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I got my start.</v>

109
00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Or where are you getting your starter?</v>

110
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.311
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

111
00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:53.401
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

112
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:58.401
<v Speaker 1>a friend of mine has the Bray a starter and my daughter Labrea what's the of</v>

113
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>starter?</v>

114
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.761
<v Speaker 1>That one.</v>

115
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Is that all the Bray libray of bakery bread,</v>

116
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>you get the yeast off of the skin of grapes.</v>

117
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.370
<v Speaker 1>So there's a process where you take grapes and you put it in like cheesecloth</v>

118
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>and you just let the,</v>

119
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>the yeast come off of all,</v>

120
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>all grapes have yeast in the skin,</v>

121
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 1>eating on the skin of the grapes and that drips off.</v>

122
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 1>And then you put it into the basic starting with the flour and water.</v>

123
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:24.540
<v Speaker 1>So it has real sweeter,</v>

124
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 1>brave say chain.</v>

125
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.843
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it would be like?</v>

126
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:28.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

127
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:28.541
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

128
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>you'll see them there are actual bakery and now they're like in Ralph's and</v>

129
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 1>everything that's all over.</v>

130
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>

131
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.960
<v Speaker 1>and like the places San Francisco that have big sourdough,</v>

132
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.101
<v Speaker 1>that it all,</v>

133
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>it's maintains the same started that they've always had.</v>

134
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>So this guy said,</v>

135
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

136
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>so I told him where I was getting my stuff.</v>

137
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>My daughter made one as a gift and then this other guy gave me a piece,</v>

138
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>he said his starter came from Jackson Hole,</v>

139
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Wyoming and he got it from a friend of his,</v>

140
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 1>and it's over a hundred years old.</v>

141
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 1>People have been passing it on to cowboy starter,</v>

142
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 1>cowboy starter.</v>

143
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.051
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

144
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:09.730
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot of minors in San Francisco and all that during the gold rush.</v>

145
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.800
<v Speaker 1>They were creating bred that way.</v>

146
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 1>That's where it started.</v>

147
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.660
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

148
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.493
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

149
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

150
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:20.971
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how old the yeast organisms get before they die and do they die?</v>

151
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.700
<v Speaker 2>They probably reproduce and yeah,</v>

152
00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 2>it's a good question.</v>

153
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because basically like I have it on my counter nab and feeding it</v>

154
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:31.630
<v Speaker 2>for the last day.</v>

155
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.470
<v Speaker 2>So now,</v>

156
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.730
<v Speaker 2>so now it's kind of bubbly,</v>

157
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.713
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

158
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Glue and it's kind of bubbly.</v>

159
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.960
<v Speaker 1>So I'll scoop out four ounces of that,</v>

160
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.130
<v Speaker 1>make bread out of it,</v>

161
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.790
<v Speaker 1>and then take one ounce of that,</v>

162
00:04:43.791 --> 00:04:44.930
<v Speaker 1>put it back in the jar,</v>

163
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.730
<v Speaker 1>feed it a little and put it in the fridge.</v>

164
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.470
<v Speaker 2>So what's the process?</v>

165
00:04:48.471 --> 00:04:50.660
<v Speaker 2>So if you took four ounces out and made bread with it,</v>

166
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.560
<v Speaker 2>what do you do with that?</v>

167
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:52.603
<v Speaker 2>The starter?</v>

168
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

169
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.670
<v Speaker 1>you basically take a lot of flour.</v>

170
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.110
<v Speaker 1>You take like 28,</v>

171
00:04:58.111 --> 00:05:00.690
<v Speaker 1>this is to make two of them two loaves.</v>

172
00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:01.530
<v Speaker 1>You Take uh,</v>

173
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

174
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.210
<v Speaker 1>28 ounces of all purpose flour or wheat flour,</v>

175
00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:07.050
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to use.</v>

176
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:08.910
<v Speaker 1>You put that in with a little salt.</v>

177
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Then you take your starter,</v>

178
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.440
<v Speaker 1>you take the four ounces and an 18 ounces of water,</v>

179
00:05:13.441 --> 00:05:14.101
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of water,</v>

180
00:05:14.101 --> 00:05:14.871
<v Speaker 1>and you make it into a cloud,</v>

181
00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:15.704
<v Speaker 1>a mixture,</v>

182
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.150
<v Speaker 1>and then you dump that into the flour and salt that's in your mixer and it just</v>

183
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.360
<v Speaker 1>makes it into dough and then it just rises naturally.</v>

184
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Bold it a couple of times,</v>

185
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.450
<v Speaker 1>put it into a ball,</v>

186
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.590
<v Speaker 1>into the Dutch oven after a couple hours and then you've got bread.</v>

187
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.590
<v Speaker 2>It's that simple.</v>

188
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.453
<v Speaker 2>It's that simple.</v>

189
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.220
<v Speaker 2>How long before you start growing your own wheat and smashing up with a rock?</v>

190
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

191
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm headed that way.</v>

192
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 2>That is the guy who,</v>

193
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.800
<v Speaker 2>who I bought the Dutch oven from is like,</v>

194
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.780
<v Speaker 2>I really like seed breads</v>

195
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:49.870
<v Speaker 2>and then I looked it up.</v>

196
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.490
<v Speaker 2>That's like crazy.</v>

197
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.560
<v Speaker 1>12 different seeds from different places and you mash them up.</v>

198
00:05:55.561 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean then then you're getting a job</v>

199
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.993
<v Speaker 2>at Williams Sonoma.</v>

200
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.900
<v Speaker 2>I went to the Museum of natural history and they had a,</v>

201
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 2>an Egyptian mummy display.</v>

202
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 2>Really fucking cool.</v>

203
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:07.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

204
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.480
<v Speaker 2>but one of the interesting things was by the time Egyptian people were older,</v>

205
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

206
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 2>they didn't leave that live that long,</v>

207
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:13.671
<v Speaker 2>but if they did,</v>

208
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:17.360
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have any teeth left because the way they made bread,</v>

209
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.950
<v Speaker 2>they ground it up.</v>

210
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.370
<v Speaker 2>They ground up their own flour and it left sand in the bread.</v>

211
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:24.523
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

212
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.423
<v Speaker 2>Rose.</v>

213
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.460
<v Speaker 2>So their bread was all you were eating sand wear away,</v>

214
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.630
<v Speaker 2>your teeth had,</v>

215
00:06:31.631 --> 00:06:32.030
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>

216
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.230
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were going to say sugar,</v>

217
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.640
<v Speaker 2>no sand.</v>

218
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:35.723
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

219
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.030
<v Speaker 2>wear your teeth down.</v>

220
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:39.620
<v Speaker 2>Line the down nerves.</v>

221
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 2>And they had all these methods that they were trying to concoct to save teeth,</v>

222
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:49.991
<v Speaker 2>like wooden caps that they would put on chew on that instead of chewing with</v>

223
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.390
<v Speaker 2>whatever nerve endings were left in your face,</v>

224
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 2>just so you could eat more sand breads.</v>

225
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 2>Sandy bread,</v>

226
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.920
<v Speaker 2>it's fucked up.</v>

227
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 2>It is a kind of a trippy thing that you just put some flour and water and this</v>

228
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:07.691
<v Speaker 2>yeast comes from the environment and now you've got this amazing tasting bread</v>

229
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:10.010
<v Speaker 2>that the family can't stop eating.</v>

230
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:10.880
<v Speaker 2>The kids writing it.</v>

231
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:11.640
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

232
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 2>especially,</v>

233
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.060
<v Speaker 2>butter's been around for forever,</v>

234
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.980
<v Speaker 2>right out of the oven when it's hot,</v>

235
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.870
<v Speaker 2>we're eating bread like crazy.</v>

236
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're talking about like eating sugar and all that flat,</v>

237
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:24.650
<v Speaker 2>we just can't stop.</v>

238
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:25.160
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

239
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 2>We're all going to be fun.</v>

240
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm going the other way.</v>

241
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:27.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm not eating any of it.</v>

242
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.540
<v Speaker 2>At least for 60 days,</v>

243
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:29.901
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>

244
00:07:29.901 --> 00:07:30.734
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel,</v>

245
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel mentally that clear.</v>

246
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:35.050
<v Speaker 2>Have you?</v>

247
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Making some life choices.</v>

248
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:37.304
<v Speaker 2>Big Regret.</v>

249
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.890
<v Speaker 2>I told you I woke up at seven this morning like,</v>

250
00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:40.101
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

251
00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 2>I gotta do a show tonight and the players,</v>

252
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:42.590
<v Speaker 2>that's the brand.</v>

253
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:44.630
<v Speaker 2>It is the is man the bread.</v>

254
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.370
<v Speaker 2>It's making me lazy you down.</v>

255
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.020
<v Speaker 2>It's just so weird,</v>

256
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.160
<v Speaker 2>so weird that you could just like put it out there and the natural yeast grows.</v>

257
00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:56.180
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>

258
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.200
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I,</v>

259
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.950
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

260
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:01.130
<v Speaker 2>I wish someone had asked me where does east come from?</v>

261
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.050
<v Speaker 2>Cause I never considered it before.</v>

262
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:06.560
<v Speaker 2>I would have been like a fucking what is it?</v>

263
00:08:06.561 --> 00:08:07.100
<v Speaker 2>A plant.</v>

264
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.000
<v Speaker 2>What is our,</v>

265
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:08.811
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

266
00:08:08.811 --> 00:08:09.740
<v Speaker 2>And then there's like,</v>

267
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:10.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

268
00:08:10.071 --> 00:08:12.980
<v Speaker 2>cause you can buy a yeast that just make regular bread and you throw it in there</v>

269
00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:13.814
<v Speaker 2>and it eats.</v>

270
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

271
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.950
<v Speaker 2>The Flower Toman maintains 122 year old sourdough starter.</v>

272
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

273
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:19.760
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

274
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.150
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

275
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.670
<v Speaker 2>There was a woman on line who's this?</v>

276
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Radical feminists who made sourdough bread out of her pussy east.</v>

277
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:29.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

278
00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:30.030
<v Speaker 2>Go find that one Jamie.</v>

279
00:08:30.031 --> 00:08:31.310
<v Speaker 2>And couldn't keep their hands off it.</v>

280
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:31.701
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

281
00:08:31.701 --> 00:08:33.440
<v Speaker 2>it was fucking flying off the shelves.</v>

282
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

283
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted about it,</v>

284
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:37.550
<v Speaker 2>but it was quite a while ago.</v>

285
00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Probably never find it,</v>

286
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.310
<v Speaker 2>but I was like good for her.</v>

287
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.241
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>

288
00:08:41.241 --> 00:08:42.170
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you.</v>

289
00:08:42.171 --> 00:08:43.550
<v Speaker 2>It's really a weird thing.</v>

290
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.121
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

291
00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:45.830
<v Speaker 2>who I haven't done it would never be baking bread.</v>

292
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

293
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:47.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm like hooked on it.</v>

294
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

295
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:49.490
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

296
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.780
<v Speaker 2>A woman who made sourdough bread using yeast from her vagina just ate the bread</v>

297
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.493
<v Speaker 2>thrown.</v>

298
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.353
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

299
00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.313
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't cheat.</v>

300
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

301
00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.393
<v Speaker 2>I would eat</v>

302
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:01.843
<v Speaker 2>my own column.</v>

303
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:04.953
<v Speaker 2>Donut</v>

304
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 2>gross.</v>

305
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.700
<v Speaker 2>Why is it so gross when I eat it?</v>

306
00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:14.460
<v Speaker 2>But when my wife swells that it's all gravy.</v>

307
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 2>That's a good relationship.</v>

308
00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:18.783
<v Speaker 2>Life is built.</v>

309
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:19.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

310
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a compromise.</v>

311
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:21.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

312
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 2>So I'm baking bread and getting fat.</v>

313
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 2>Bread's good.</v>

314
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.393
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

315
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.653
<v Speaker 2>Bread's good.</v>

316
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.370
<v Speaker 2>It's not good for you Tom.</v>

317
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:29.671
<v Speaker 2>Papa.</v>

318
00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:30.210
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

319
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.980
<v Speaker 2>We started a resurgence.</v>

320
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

321

<v Speaker 2>you brought bread.</v>

322
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:34.290
<v Speaker 2>You son of a bitch.</v>

323
00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:35.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

324
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.110
<v Speaker 2>it's wrapped in a cloth.</v>

325
00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

326
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:38.030
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

327
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.400
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

328
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.530
<v Speaker 2>like he's some old timey baker character through.</v>

329
00:09:41.531 --> 00:09:43.730
<v Speaker 2>It feels like the only thing I'm bummed out about us.</v>

330
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.750
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a basket to bring it in.</v>

331
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Did you make that?</v>

332
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.110
<v Speaker 2>This is a sour dough.</v>

333
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.680
<v Speaker 2>This is a sourdough bread from Tom Papa that made it into New York Times.</v>

334
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:53.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

335
00:09:53.311 --> 00:09:55.810

336
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:56.490
<v Speaker 2>can I smell it?</v>

337
00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.323
<v Speaker 2>Talks about it.</v>

338
00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:57.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

339
00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.420

340
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:02.120
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

342
00:10:05.161 --> 00:10:05.460
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

343
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.360
<v Speaker 2>like a real bakery?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

350
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.600
<v Speaker 2>that's ancient sourdough.</v>

351
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.991
<v Speaker 2>Tom,</v>

352
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:16.411

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.940
<v Speaker 2>it looks like we're off the Diet today.</v>

357
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Today I was at the lowest weight.</v>

358
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.020
<v Speaker 2>I've been in like years,</v>

359
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.820
<v Speaker 2>so really one 90 this morning.</v>

360
00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:27.843
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

361
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:28.171
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

362
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:28.801

00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:29.634
<v Speaker 2>How tall are you?</v>

364
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:29.971
<v Speaker 2>Five.</v>

365
00:10:29.971 --> 00:10:30.480
<v Speaker 2>Eight.</v>

366
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.313
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

367
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:32.461
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

368
00:10:32.461 --> 00:10:33.294
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

369
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that this bread,</v>

370
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.720
<v Speaker 2>this is sourdough bread.</v>

371
00:10:36.721 --> 00:10:39.870
<v Speaker 2>You digest it as a lower glycaemic supposedly.</v>

372
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly.</v>

373
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:42.660
<v Speaker 2>Allegedly.</v>

374
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.171
<v Speaker 2>I'm in though,</v>

375
00:10:43.171 --> 00:10:43.441
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

376
00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:44.250
<v Speaker 2>Just slice it up.</v>

377
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.083
<v Speaker 2>Put It on this.</v>

378
00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:47.090
<v Speaker 2>This is a couple of days off.</v>

379
00:10:47.091 --> 00:10:47.960
<v Speaker 2>So granted this,</v>

380
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:48.751
<v Speaker 2>this table,</v>

381
00:10:48.751 --> 00:10:49.620
<v Speaker 2>it actually be good.</v>

382
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.330
<v Speaker 2>Like it'll make it cooler.</v>

383
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.790
<v Speaker 2>So he just cut it like it's a cutting board.</v>

384
00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:54.420
<v Speaker 2>Don't be shy.</v>

385
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.253
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

386
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.160
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>

387
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is how bread was made originally.</v>

388
00:10:58.381 --> 00:11:01.620
<v Speaker 2>This is an ancient Egypt up thousand years ago.</v>

389
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.491
<v Speaker 2>Ancient Egypt.</v>

390
00:11:02.491 --> 00:11:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that in ancient Egypt,</v>

391
00:11:03.721 --> 00:11:04.531
<v Speaker 2>when they made bread,</v>

392
00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:09.060
<v Speaker 2>they ground their flour on like mortar and pestle.</v>

393
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.890
<v Speaker 2>But they were really shitty and so they'd get a lot of sand in the flower.</v>

394
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:17.100
<v Speaker 2>So the people in ancient Egypt all had fucked up teeth,</v>

395
00:11:17.101 --> 00:11:18.930
<v Speaker 2>like worn down to the nerves</v>

396
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.770
<v Speaker 2>cause they were chewing sand,</v>

397
00:11:22.771 --> 00:11:23.604
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

398
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.890
<v Speaker 2>So the inside of their body was like a fucking,</v>

399
00:11:25.891 --> 00:11:26.850
<v Speaker 2>what are those things called?</v>

400
00:11:26.851 --> 00:11:27.510
<v Speaker 2>And Birds.</v>

401
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:28.251
<v Speaker 2>What does that called?</v>

402
00:11:28.251 --> 00:11:29.050
<v Speaker 2>Like a,</v>

403
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:29.883
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

404
00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:30.660
<v Speaker 2>like uh,</v>

405
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.291
<v Speaker 2>what is that thing?</v>

406
00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:32.280
<v Speaker 2>That thing that they do?</v>

407
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.870
<v Speaker 2>The crop where your,</v>

408
00:11:33.871 --> 00:11:34.041
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

409
00:11:34.041 --> 00:11:34.500
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

410
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.400
<v Speaker 2>your gizzard.</v>

411
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

412
00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:36.813
<v Speaker 2>You have your</v>

413
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.620
<v Speaker 2>fucking rocks in there and you chew up your food.</v>

414
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

415
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
<v Speaker 2>Which is apparently one of the reasons why they made ledge shot illegal in</v>

416
00:11:48.241 --> 00:11:48.871
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

417
00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:53.440
<v Speaker 2>Cause like if people do like shooting clays or if they shoot things and those</v>

418
00:11:53.441 --> 00:11:54.400
<v Speaker 2>little lead pellets</v>

419
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 1>from shotguns,</v>

420
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.760
<v Speaker 1>birds will actually eat those.</v>

421
00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

422
00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.390
<v Speaker 1>And it goes in there.</v>

423
00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.350
<v Speaker 1>They're gizzard and they use it to,</v>

424
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:03.184
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

425
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.390
<v Speaker 1>to grind things up,</v>

426
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:05.710
<v Speaker 1>but then they get lead poisoning.</v>

427
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.690
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing with the California condor.</v>

428
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

429
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:08.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

430
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:11.500
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why a California condors,</v>

431
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.693
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

432
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:17.340
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why they made led illegal for ammunition in California is</v>

433
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.910
<v Speaker 1>because of California condors.</v>

434
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Cause they wouldn't hear it dumped fucks.</v>

435
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.900
<v Speaker 1>So eating pellets,</v>

436
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.510
<v Speaker 1>not a rock.</v>

437
00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:26.800
<v Speaker 1>You stupid fuck condor.</v>

438
00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:27.610
<v Speaker 1>They look dumb.</v>

439
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:28.421
<v Speaker 1>They have Damas far.</v>

440
00:12:28.421 --> 00:12:28.960
<v Speaker 1>They really do.</v>

441
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.793
<v Speaker 1>But we need them.</v>

442
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.850
<v Speaker 1>This should they toasted.</v>

443
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.060
<v Speaker 1>Toasted would really be the thing that would get you way to tie right now.</v>

444
00:12:34.061 --> 00:12:34.301

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.070
<v Speaker 1>this is made with three ingredients.</v>

459
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:00.611
<v Speaker 1>Flour,</v>

460

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

464
00:13:03.131 --> 00:13:05.920
<v Speaker 1>from your sourdough starter bread,</v>

465
00:13:05.921 --> 00:13:06.790
<v Speaker 1>like the healthy,</v>

466
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.780
<v Speaker 1>like whole wheat bread,</v>

467

<v Speaker 1>you just get it.</v>

468
00:13:08.291 --> 00:13:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Ralph's or whatever.</v>

469
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.720
<v Speaker 1>32 ingredients.</v>

470
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:12.910
<v Speaker 1>32.</v>

471
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.350
<v Speaker 1>This is pure.</v>

472
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:19.210
<v Speaker 1>And is that just because it preserved preserved preservatives and flavors and</v>

473
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:20.143
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

474
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.520
<v Speaker 1>people get so mad when they eat.</v>

475
00:13:21.521 --> 00:13:22.354
<v Speaker 1>On a microphone.</v>

476
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.051
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

477
00:13:23.051 --> 00:13:24.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's so good.</v>

478
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Normally folks,</v>

479
00:13:25.331 --> 00:13:28.750
<v Speaker 1>I would never do this to you and I'm only doing this to you because Tom Papa</v>

480
00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.200
<v Speaker 1>brought some breaded and I'm going to break my diet for a few hours.</v>

481
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.570
<v Speaker 1>The sour dough flavor,</v>

482
00:13:34.571 --> 00:13:36.490
<v Speaker 1>like that little after flavor and the top of your mouth.</v>

483
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:40.060
<v Speaker 1>It's an that's a bacteria that's lactobacillius or something like that.</v>

484
00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:40.700
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

485
00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

486
00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.013
<v Speaker 1>this is really good.</v>

487
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:43.630
<v Speaker 1>You're in a excellent bread guy.</v>

488
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:44.471
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty cool.</v>

489
00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:46.060
<v Speaker 1>Standup comedy thing doesn't pan out.</v>

490
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.313
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

491
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:51.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to just go into it after doing your podcast and then talking about it</v>

492
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:52.960
<v Speaker 1>on my podcast,</v>

493
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.090
<v Speaker 1>it just kind of erupted.</v>

494
00:13:55.091 --> 00:14:00.091
<v Speaker 1>People were just so interested in just this pure making something small and</v>

495
00:14:00.251 --> 00:14:01.084
<v Speaker 1>simple and,</v>

496
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.433
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

497
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.550
<v Speaker 1>I think I told you when I saw you at the comedy store,</v>

498
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.501
<v Speaker 1>there's like,</v>

499
00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:05.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

500
00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:06.360
<v Speaker 1>you have some,</v>

501
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:11.360
<v Speaker 1>you have some real man listeners like dudes who look like they're going to call</v>

502
00:14:12.131 --> 00:14:14.200
<v Speaker 1>you for like advice on a truck and they're like,</v>

503
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:15.940
<v Speaker 1>I can't get my starter right.</v>

504
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.960
<v Speaker 1>It's about,</v>

505
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:19.483
<v Speaker 1>there's some like,</v>

506
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.430
<v Speaker 1>and people would start sending me pictures of,</v>

507
00:14:21.431 --> 00:14:24.280
<v Speaker 1>there's bread and pictures of their sourdough and then this guy from the New</v>

508
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:24.571
<v Speaker 1>York Times,</v>

509
00:14:24.571 --> 00:14:25.211
<v Speaker 1>Sam Sifton,</v>

510
00:14:25.211 --> 00:14:25.960
<v Speaker 1>the editor,</v>

511
00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.670
<v Speaker 1>it was doing an article on it.</v>

512
00:14:27.671 --> 00:14:31.210
<v Speaker 1>So he contacted me and that was part of this sour dough.</v>

513
00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.650
<v Speaker 1>This whole thing about people keep their sourdough starter like a pet.</v>

514
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.610
<v Speaker 1>So it was kind of like this revival of this little method.</v>

515
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.790
<v Speaker 1>So ended up in this article in the New York Times.</v>

516
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

517
00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:44.223
<v Speaker 1>Read it.</v>

518
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.580
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of people send me articles about starters to yeah,</v>

519
00:14:48.581 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 1>like people in England that have 150 year old and all this crazy</v>

520
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.090
<v Speaker 2>shit weird.</v>

521
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.450
<v Speaker 2>It's so good that I had never even heard about it until you brought it up.</v>

522
00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:57.830
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

523
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:01.550
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea either until a month before that I had the,</v>

524
00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.000
<v Speaker 2>I was under the impression and knows with zero research,</v>

525
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.530
<v Speaker 2>just my head,</v>

526
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:07.430
<v Speaker 2>this is how you make bread.</v>

527
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.150
<v Speaker 2>I thought you'd take flour and water and eggs and yeast.</v>

528
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:11.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

529
00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:13.910
<v Speaker 2>You add yeast for Easton and that's all I thought.</v>

530
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:14.301
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

531
00:15:14.301 --> 00:15:15.620
<v Speaker 2>I never knew that you had like</v>

532
00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:21.140
<v Speaker 2>they could take flour and mix it with water and then you get yeast out of the</v>

533
00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:21.800
<v Speaker 2>air.</v>

534
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

535
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:23.390
<v Speaker 2>When you told me that and I was like,</v>

536
00:15:23.391 --> 00:15:23.811
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

537
00:15:23.811 --> 00:15:24.740
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out of here.</v>

538
00:15:24.741 --> 00:15:25.610
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

539
00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Just floating around us all the time,</v>

540
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:27.681
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

541
00:15:27.681 --> 00:15:27.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

542
00:15:27.831 --> 00:15:29.950
<v Speaker 2>that's what the case with nitrogen [inaudible].</v>

543
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:30.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

544
00:15:30.831 --> 00:15:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Like the reason why there's so many people on this planet,</v>

545
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.360
<v Speaker 2>and this is from a radio lab podcast that highlighted,</v>

546
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.850
<v Speaker 2>I think it was called the bad show,</v>

547
00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:42.250
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

548
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:47.580
<v Speaker 2>the radio lab podcast was highlighting how sometimes really bad people do really</v>

549
00:15:48.351 --> 00:15:50.030
<v Speaker 2>good things or really good.</v>

550
00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:54.020
<v Speaker 2>It's sometimes it's difficult to differentiate between someone who's bad or good</v>

551
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:55.400
<v Speaker 2>because what they've done is so amazing.</v>

552
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:56.030
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

553
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.863
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

554
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.250
<v Speaker 2>this is a guy named Fritz harbor,</v>

555
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.120
<v Speaker 2>and Fritz Haber was a scientist in Germany,</v>

556
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:06.620
<v Speaker 2>and what harbor did was he figured out a way to extract nitrogen from the air</v>

557
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:10.400
<v Speaker 2>because apparently our air is mostly nitrogen.</v>
