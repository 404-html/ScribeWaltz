00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.390
<v Speaker 1>the thing that nobody ever does,</v>

7
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>he went out on top undefeated with all the money after having fought all</v>

8
00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:16.984
<v Speaker 1>challengers.</v>

9
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean he might've fought pack out late,</v>

10
00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:21.340
<v Speaker 1>but you can't deny that he fought all challengers.</v>

11
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.570
<v Speaker 2>Who gives a fuck w I mean the 50 things seems to be a,</v>

12
00:00:26.571 --> 00:00:28.210
<v Speaker 2>an issue or not an issue.</v>

13
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.230
<v Speaker 2>40 to 50 now whether or not he wants to break the record,</v>

14
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:32.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

15
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:33.670
<v Speaker 2>well how much of that is,</v>

16
00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:33.921
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

17
00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:35.740
<v Speaker 2>is the ego that's going to last for,</v>

18
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's still pretty young,</v>

19
00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:37.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

20
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

21
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

22
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.930
<v Speaker 1>I think he's 36 if I had to guess,</v>

23
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.580
<v Speaker 1>but he's in really good shape.</v>

24
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean he takes care of himself really well.</v>

25
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.610
<v Speaker 1>He's like notoriously disciplined about workouts and he'll even go out at night,</v>

26
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.111
<v Speaker 1>go to a nightclub,</v>

27
00:00:53.111 --> 00:00:53.944
<v Speaker 1>drink water,</v>

28
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.610
<v Speaker 1>and then work out at two o'clock in the morning cause he has his own gym and his</v>

29
00:00:57.611 --> 00:00:58.241
<v Speaker 1>own thing.</v>

30
00:00:58.241 --> 00:00:58.810
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

31
00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:59.710
<v Speaker 1>he works hard.</v>

32
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.520
<v Speaker 1>You don't get that good on just talent.</v>

33
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.271
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

34
00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:08.050
<v Speaker 1>you get that good on talent and discipline and hard fucking work.</v>

35
00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:10.270
<v Speaker 1>There's just no way around it and smart.</v>

36
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.410
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be smart too.</v>

37
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.310
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be sneaky.</v>

38
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.420
<v Speaker 1>You've gotta be clever.</v>

39
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.131
<v Speaker 2>Do you see,</v>

40
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:14.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

41
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.110
<v Speaker 2>who he is training right now for a fight?</v>

42
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

43
00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>He's a trained soldier.</v>

44
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:18.504
<v Speaker 1>Boy.</v>

45
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Soulja boy is really going to fight Chris Brown.</v>

46
00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:24.794
<v Speaker 1>Is that real?</v>

47
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean it doesn't seem like it,</v>

48
00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:29.560
<v Speaker 2>but it's been talked about for a few days now.</v>

49
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.390
<v Speaker 2>Apparently it's going to be on paper view,</v>

50
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

51
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.760
<v Speaker 2>in fighting over a girl.</v>

52
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

53
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you right now,</v>

54
00:01:36.311 --> 00:01:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Chris Brown's going to fuck him up probably.</v>

55
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

56
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>That's an angry dude.</v>

57
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.861
<v Speaker 1>But see,</v>

58
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>that dude is on the left with the red.</v>

59
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.410
<v Speaker 1>That's a real angry dude.</v>

60
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>The other dude,</v>

61
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 1>I just do not think he is as angry</v>

62
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.530
<v Speaker 2>but ever known was man.</v>

63
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.850
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen either of them in person,</v>

64
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.861
<v Speaker 1>any one of them.</v>

65
00:01:55.861 --> 00:02:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Soulja boy's been hide some sick boxing skills and just pretending this</v>

66
00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>whole time.</v>

67
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.793
<v Speaker 1>I doubt it.</v>

68
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.141
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

69
00:02:02.141 --> 00:02:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I feel like Chris Brown is probably punched a lot more people,</v>

70
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.510
<v Speaker 1>don't you think?</v>

72
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

73
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:08.620
<v Speaker 1>All,</v>

74
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:11.050
<v Speaker 1>wife beating girl beating jokes aside.</v>

76
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.730
<v Speaker 1>He's definitely seems like a dude who is much more likely to punch people.</v>

77
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:17.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

78
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.110
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

79
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe more likely to,</v>

80
00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:22.580
<v Speaker 2>but I couldn't really see mo neither either of them getting in like a street</v>

81
00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:23.151
<v Speaker 2>fighter or anything.</v>

82
00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:26.810
<v Speaker 2>They've been pretty famous for most of their life and pretending to,</v>

83
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.980
<v Speaker 2>hmm.</v>

84
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.813
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

85
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.200
<v Speaker 2>Since they're in their teens,</v>

86
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.833
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

87
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.123
<v Speaker 2>two guys,</v>

88
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.791
<v Speaker 2>shit happens.</v>

89
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:37.250
<v Speaker 2>So I mean they might have thrown some darn down once or twice.</v>

90
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.671
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

91
00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:37.821
<v Speaker 1>Bill,</v>

92
00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:38.660
<v Speaker 1>here's another thing.</v>

93
00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Here's another reason why I say Chris Brown.</v>

94
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Chris Brown's a real fucking dancer.</v>

95
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:43.940
<v Speaker 1>He ever see that guy move?</v>

96
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

97
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.931
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

98
00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:46.700
<v Speaker 1>He could do some crazy shit.</v>

99
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.010
<v Speaker 1>He's really good in basketball.</v>

100
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Really good in basketball.</v>

101
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

102
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.230
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be a blood bath.</v>

103
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.953
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong.</v>

104
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.203
<v Speaker 1>What'd you buy it?</v>

105
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.493
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

106
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

107
00:02:58.161 --> 00:02:59.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll fucking buy it.</v>

108
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

109
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>And if a soldier boy fucks him up,</v>

110
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.901
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

111
00:03:02.901 --> 00:03:03.734
<v Speaker 1>I'll apologize.</v>

112
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 2>Have A,</v>

113
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.460
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to think about this.</v>

114
00:03:05.461 --> 00:03:06.750
<v Speaker 2>Hasn't there been other things?</v>

115
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.081
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

116
00:03:07.081 --> 00:03:09.540
<v Speaker 2>I know you were supposedly supposed to fight Wesley snipes,</v>

117
00:03:09.541 --> 00:03:12.180
<v Speaker 2>but like wasn't there other things like this ever happened?</v>

118
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.280
<v Speaker 1>I have a whole celebrity boxing show.</v>

119
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.510
<v Speaker 2>I remember that happened a couple.</v>

120
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

121
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

122
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Danny Bonaduce fought screech.</v>

123
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

124
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.480
<v Speaker 2>he fucked up a couple of people.</v>

125
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.510
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I was younger there was supposed to be a big event where</v>

126
00:03:24.511 --> 00:03:28.110
<v Speaker 2>Shaquille O'Neal was supposed to go one on one on paper view with this other big</v>

127
00:03:28.111 --> 00:03:29.490
<v Speaker 2>player named a camouflage one.</v>

128
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.050
<v Speaker 2>You're going to box not box.</v>

129
00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:33.390
<v Speaker 2>They were going to come play basketball one on one for me in dollars,</v>

130
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.710
<v Speaker 2>but it never ended up happening.</v>

131
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why and when went away,</v>

132
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.440
<v Speaker 2>but I was just kind of wondering in my head like,</v>

133
00:03:40.441 --> 00:03:41.410
<v Speaker 2>I feel like this has happened.</v>

134
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.440
<v Speaker 2>I've heard things like this coming up and have like,</v>

135
00:03:43.441 --> 00:03:44.340
<v Speaker 2>or at least been announced,</v>

136
00:03:44.341 --> 00:03:45.570
<v Speaker 2>but they're just kind of fizzle out.</v>

137
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.621
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>

138
00:03:46.621 --> 00:03:47.190
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

139
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean people have done crazy shit.</v>

140
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.050
<v Speaker 1>This just seems like a really,</v>

141
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.200
<v Speaker 1>really nutty one and they're fighting over a girl.</v>

142
00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.750
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

143
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen any evidence of soldier boy,</v>

144
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:01.160
<v Speaker 1>his athleticism.</v>

145
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.003
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

146
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.200
<v Speaker 1>somebody put up a video of him working out.</v>

147
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.870
