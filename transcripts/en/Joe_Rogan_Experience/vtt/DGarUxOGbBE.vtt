1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.480
I that my theory is always,
it's probably not scientifically based whatsoever,

2
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:06.900
but my theory has always been that the things that are really hard to catch,

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.570
those are the ones that ever be like better for you and tastier,
tastier,

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.330
better for you.
You know?
It's like fish.
Fish are fucking really hard to catch.

5
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.080
Really good for you.
You know dear,
really hard to catch.
Really good for you.

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.940
Big Fat like those Japanese fucking,
what are those?

7
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.390
What do they call those?
Coby beef cows.
Those fucking cows.

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.640
They're not running from anybody.
You know what I'm saying?

9
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.550
That's why it's terrible for you.
Terrible.

10
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.520
We're such assholes.

11
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.110
We've tricked animals to get like so obese that they're like on the verge of

12
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:45.111
death because they're just packing fat everywhere in all their muscle tissue.

13
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.760
What about
fuck was

14
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.860
done,
dude,
June.
That's so stupid.

15
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.530
Birds or constellation gentlemen,

16
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.420
100% of all birds that have ever lived are cunts.
They don't give a fuck about,

17
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:03.260
you know,
birds care about you.
They don't even care about,

18
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.200
they don't care about shit.

19
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:06.720
They look cute when they have little babies and they're swimming together.

20
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:09.900
But the reality is you're going to eat them anyway.
Why is it okay to eat them?

21
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:12.960
It's not okay to overfeed them.
It's a really quick process.

22
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:15.800
I've watched them do it.
It literally only takes a couple seconds.
Yeah.

23
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.110
With the tube.
Yeah.
They take the goose,
they put the tube into its mouth,

24
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:21.450
they hold it there,
and then they pour the grain down its stomach.

25
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.990
It's not in pain.
It only takes a couple seconds.
And then after that's over,

26
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:29.790
the things just running around.
I mean it's like how is that bad?

27
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.380
But the way they farm pigs.
That's okay.
Yeah.

28
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.790
You know why though?
It's a gamble.
It's a winnable.
It's a winnable,

29
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.220
a topic for animal people because the people that are like,

30
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.980
because of what grime is like a kind of,
it's a,
it's a delicacy.
So it's,
uh,

31
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.080
it's not considered something that,
it's not like they're like,

32
00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:56.240
we're going to try to take stakes out of the market.
It's something that is,

33
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.520
it's for it.
See if it's an elitist choice.

34
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.090
Most people don't need any,

35
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.250
I mean the great majority of people don't even know what Fulbright is.

36
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.300
So they go out and go,
this is totally inhumane way to make this,

37
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.140
they put it on a ballot and they get enough momentum behind it where they can

38
00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:16.890
win it.
Yeah.
I've,
I've seen the argument and uh,
you know,

39
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:20.970
I'm certainly not one for animal cruelty,
but it's not,
you know,

40
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.360
it might be bad if it was a person that you were doing that too.
Yeah,
absolutely.

41
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.770
But you would never allow any of this shit they do to chickens for a human

42
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.370
[inaudible] know humans are a level live like that stacked on top of each other

43
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:33.300
and their own shit.

44
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.830
And I mean the way they're doing chickens and pigs with these fucking cages

45
00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:42.030
where they can't even move and veal.
Well that's all.
Okay.
That's all.
Okay.

46
00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:44.850
But that's not where this country duck

47
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.520
duck stuff,
that fucking grain right down.
It's stupid mouth.

48
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.440
I'm getting the giving of your delicious liver.

49
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.600
I'm getting a gun just to shoot these birds outside of

50
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.100
beautiful birds at that.
They're building a nest on our house.
And

51
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.700
<v 1>they churn every morning and I wake up to this wonderful bird song and it</v>

52
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:06.850
enrages my husband and I was like,
let's get the gone.

53
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.440
I think it's beautiful.
I love I,
but I have crows and those,

54
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.660
those are concerns.
I don't,

55
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.130
I don't hate bird chirping.
I don't like it.
At the hour,

56
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.540
one time I left a steak,
I had a steak and I forgot to defrost it and I figured,

57
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.560
well,
the probably the best way to defrost it,
sit it outside in the sun,

58
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.480
right on my cattle.
That's a good idea.
So
with the wrapping on,

59
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:38.710
his fucking Kentucky Crow was coming down there and pecking at my steak.
No Shit.

60
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.890
Yeah,

61
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.190
he ate like a little chunk of it before I figured out what he was doing for a

62
00:03:43.191 --> 00:03:47.500
song.
I mean,
I only turned my back for like a minute.
That assholes watching.

63
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.530
They watch what you're doing,

64
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.900
did look to see if there's anything that you're doing that that could benefit

65
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:57.130
them.
The birds don't really like you,
man.
The hunts.
You've had a pet bird.

66
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.870
It's a one way relationship.
It's moody.
It's in a mood to fucking shit on you.

67
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.990
You let them on your shoulder,
they take a shit on.
You

68
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.260
fucked up the dinosaurs.
They really are the last of the dinosaurs.

69
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.280
Bunnies are bad pets too.
I always thought because they just shit all the time.

70
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.730
But then lately,
yeah,
with Eddie and a couple of the people,
I'm like,
wow,

71
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:25.010
these seem like rabbits.

72
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:26.950
They're really affectionate.

73
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.370
They just want to cuddle with you and your pet them and they just snuggle up

74
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:33.970
with you.
That's cool.
Yeah,
it's cool.
They're sweet.
They're sweet little up,

75
00:04:33.971 --> 00:04:36.130
but they're also delicious and when push comes to shove,

76
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.460
the apocalypse is coming.
They got to go.
I've had rhabdo or I like that too.

77
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.560
I like rabbit.
Yeah.
I had an a Moroccan restaurant in the valley once

78
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.830
where we had in our old,
pretty delicious when we lived in the Rampart division.

79
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.500
What do the neighbors had?
A rooster
she called animal protection.

80
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.200
Every single fuck would allow you to have a rooster that's an asshole.

81
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.110
Pat To him on a chain.

82
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.410
It was on a chain running through the streets and fucking [inaudible].

83
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.980
This was an El Salvadorian neighborhood.

84
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.020
Family could see it off our balcony.
Is it an apartment building or a house?

85
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.750
It's an apartment apartment,

86
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.280
so they thought they could have a god damn rooster and an apartment.

87
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.310
There was a lot of neighbors who had to be losing their fucking minds like,

88
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.481
oh my God,

89
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:45.481
we were the ones that like call somebody for this shit is crazy.

90
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:48.760
Bitch thinks she's going to get away with having a rooster in her backyard and

91
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:51.940
the neighborhood is 100% El Salvador and they're just cool with that.

92
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:55.330
I think so this is just like the village back home,

93
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.160
like it's no different snitching,
you know?
You're not supposed

94
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.560
<v 2>to snitch on your neighbors,
you know what I mean?
Wow.
Yeah.
Well,</v>

95
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:03.980
so they just want,
they want to,
they want to get out of El Salvador,

96
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:06.140
but they want to be like Elsa for sure.

97
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.400
The whole neighborhood is completely like,
what is it?
Yeah,
I guess it's just,

98
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.450
yeah,
they had a lot of gunshots.

99
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.450
He used to hear gunshots nightly,
daily.
Sometimes

100
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.530
I was jerking off in the living room one time.

101
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.360
Her bullet came through the window?
No,

102
00:06:27.361 --> 00:06:31.790
but it was like two in the afternoon and I'm like just sitting on the couch,

103
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.160
Dick and my laptop open and I hear a fucking gunshot.

104
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.300
But it sounds like somebody on the balcony,

105
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.270
you know when it's not like a distant,
it's two in the afternoon,

106
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:43.730
like signs out New Year,
you know?
And you're like,
whoa,

107
00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:48.140
like jump through the laptop and jump on the floor.
Oh Geez.
Like just dig out.

108
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.990
And I called Jose,
the guy that building manager and I go,
dude,
did you hear that?

109
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.700
And I,
he goes,
and I'm like,
the gunshot.
Did you hear that?
He goes,
no,

110
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:02.000
I'm in the garage.
And I go,
all right man.

111
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.000
I thought I heard a gunshot really loudly.
And he was like,

112
00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:07.190
I didn't hear anything.
I hang up the phone.

113
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:10.560
And like two minutes later the phone when he was like,
Hey Tom,
it's Jose.
Yeah,

114
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.250
some guy just got killed out on sixth street.
And I'm like,
oh.

115
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:16.340
So that's what that was.
It was all blocked off.

116
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.240
Some guy had gone up to a guy on sixth street,

117
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.830
like two in the afternoon,

118
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.570
shot him with a three 57 right in the chest,

119
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.550
one shot and then like put his hands up.
He got arrested.
Whoa.

120
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:36.620
Yeah.
And that was middle of the day.
Yeah.
Some people don't like each other.

121
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.550
You know,
people who don't get along.
It's a hateful,

122
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.990
what a terrible way to be able to end it too.

123
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.060
You can't just get away from that person.

124
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:48.730
They put holes in them and to die on shitty sixth street in the Shipper Hood

125
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.800
neighborhood is that we had the ice cream truck in front of the house and then

126
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.330
in the same loop.
Yeah.
But it wasn't even,

127
00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.470
but it wasn't even the traditional who had like a little El Salvadorian flavor.

128
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:05.360
Yeah.
Some extra horns and whistles in it.
Yeah.
It was fun.
It was,

129
00:08:05.361 --> 00:08:10.361
it was not a fun Alverado did you guys feel really uncomfortable decision?

130
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.830
It was my fault cause I was living in silver lake and I went on vacation.

131
00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:19.580
I came back and my house had been infested with rats.
Whoa.

132
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.300
There's rat shit everywhere.
I had a grapefruit,
I left out,
it was half eaten.

133
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.820
Whoa.
I was like,
I gotta get the fuck Outta here,
man.

134
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.120
So this is the first place I could find like the quickest place I could find.

135
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.110
And it was relatively safe,
but it was,
it was a two year disaster.

136
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.920
Why too lazy broke.
Sometimes it's cheap.

137
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:42.800
I don't know.
I got used to it and then we were like,

138
00:08:42.801 --> 00:08:44.510
we gotta get the Fuck Outta here.
Like wow.

139
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.630
And the other thing was every night we also,
we're a block,

140
00:08:47.631 --> 00:08:49.430
I don't know if you remember at this point,

141
00:08:49.431 --> 00:08:54.080
it would be almost two years ago on sixth street.
Just a couple blocks from,

142
00:08:54.081 --> 00:08:56.460
we were as where this El Salvadorian

143
00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:01.140
<v 1>guy was crossing the street drunk and he pulled out a knife and he was wheeling</v>

144
00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:05.010
around and the cops shot him 13 or 14 times.
Right?
Whoa.

145
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.720
So they killed him and then the whole neighborhood rioted and they walked up to

146
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:12.690
the Rampart Division police station.
There was riots on the streets.

147
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.710
We got on the roof of our building and there was like there was,

148
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.700
because it was nightly that we would see helicopters,
we would get the line,

149
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:24.300
the light shot show,
which shine through our window like every night.

150
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.160
But this night there was,

151
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.120
we counted like 11 and they were just in a swarm above us,

152
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:35.121
like a swarm of bees just during the riot thing and that's what that was like a

153
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.270
couple of weeks.
We were like,
all right,

154
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:39.900
we're definitely going with this shit man.
Wow.
Yeah.
This is too crazy.

155
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.780
So we left that neighborhood.
She's there was a lot of gang fights.

156
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.390
18th street gang.
Ms 13 yeah.
Tag on our wall.
Like our building.

157
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.610
Everybody lives in venison on the corner,

158
00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.870
whereas daughter plays in the little playground area.
Three kids got shot.

159
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:59.190
Yeah.
You know,
one day you're there and someone pulls out a gun.

160
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:03.880
You know that I can happen.
People die in a cross fire.
Shit happens.

161
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.710
What a crazy ass neighborhood to live in.
Dude.

162
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.610
Venice apparently has a lot of that.
Huh?
Fucking Burbank.
I buy wizard.

163
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.920
You don't happen.
When I lived in the valley one time my neighbor got murdered

164
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.750
and he got rid of the front yard at night.

165
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:26.710
Shotgun shot seven times.
Oh my God.
Which means they like reload it and said,

166
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:30.840
oh my God.
And uh,
I was the only one that didn't hear it like everybody.

167
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.170
Nor do I know dude.
I,
cause I was,

168
00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.510
and I remember my buddy truck came over me and he puts his hand on my chest.

169
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.200
He's like,
Tommy.
And I was like,
Holy Shit Man.
You hear that shit?
And I'm like,

170
00:10:43.201 --> 00:10:47.100
clearly not no fucking asleep when you yelled at me.
He was like,

171
00:10:47.101 --> 00:10:49.560
there was a lot of shots right there.
And this wasn't a bad neighborhood,

172
00:10:49.561 --> 00:10:52.740
real loud.
Sozo,
just someone really hated someone.
Well,

173
00:10:52.741 --> 00:10:56.490
it turns out kind of a kind of,
when it came out that he was,
he was dealing like,

174
00:10:56.491 --> 00:10:59.790
I guess who's dealing with some pretty major weight.

175
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.790
So this was like a retaliation.
It was something so drug related,

176
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.720
but they never got the guys that got them.
Wow.

177
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.680
They blast him on his front fucking yard and they never got the guys that got

178
00:11:10.681 --> 00:11:11.730
him.
Holy Shit.

179
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.230
I wonder how much they actually catch as far as murders go.

180
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.390
How will you know what I think about it a lot when you walk around,
when you,

181
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.330
when you hear the percentage of unsolved homicides,

182
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.570
how many times a day you cross paths with like a a murderer.
It has to happen.

183
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:28.730
I don't trust them.

184
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:33.270
They say that the one way that's like the most difficult to catch someone as if

185
00:11:33.271 --> 00:11:36.840
they just crew it.
Just do something random like walking somewhere,

186
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.570
shoot someone and kill them and then leave.
Like those are really,

187
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.050
I mean that's why everyone's pushing for surveillance and surveillance.

188
00:11:43.051 --> 00:11:45.890
That's the best way to catch people.
The biggest,
best way to get away with it.

189
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.960
I'll get a random killing killings.

190
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:51.180
Not like someone who you obviously have already been pissed off at.

191
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:55.800
They see when the random ones happen.
It's not much they can do.

192
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.210
There's still a high percent.

193
00:11:57.211 --> 00:11:59.740
I think there's a high percentage of unsolved murders,
man.

194
00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:03.460
I know the cases where there's like,
yeah,
we just didn't get it.

195
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:07.510
That guy got away with it.
Yeah.
You don't have the evidence or sometimes,

196
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:10.300
a lot of times now it's these understaffed,
you know,

197
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.760
at least in the u s understaffed.
Uh,
please,
state departments don't have the,

198
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.200
they have too many murders for how much,

199
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:21.010
how many cops they can put down to solve crimes,
you know?
Right.

200
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.170
You have your murder rate keeps going up.
You go to like,
uh,

201
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:28.390
you've seen the murder rate in like Venezuela?
No,
no,
no shit dude.

202
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:31.180
Like a Caracas,
Venezuela has,
I think our,

203
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:36.790
our murder capitol always fluctuates between like Orleans,

204
00:12:36.791 --> 00:12:40.960
Baltimore,
Detroit.
You know,
sometimes you used to be like La,
New York,

205
00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:43.350
Miami gets in there,
you know these,
they end the,

206
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:48.130
you're talking about in the 200 to 400 kind of fluctuation of murders.

207
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:53.380
And you take a city like a Caracas.
Venezuela has a over a thousand.
Wow.

208
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.440
So you're talking about over four times the murders that happen in New Orleans.

209
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.330
And then you pick about how many,

210
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.380
like how many people you need a numbers game to solve though that many murder.

211
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.730
Like do you just show up and you're just like,
oh,

212
00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.600
this is a man saying we had 27 on the other side of town.

213
00:13:09.601 --> 00:13:10.510
I don't know if we're going to get to them.

214
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.730
I don't give a shit about you and Venezuela either.

215
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.600
There's a lot of Mexican cities have ridiculously high,

216
00:13:16.601 --> 00:13:21.190
like Monterey has really high fucking murder rate.
Then unsolvable.

217
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.890
It's not solvable.
Why can't it just a part of life?

218
00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:25.900
Murder is just a part of life.
You're not going to get to it.

219
00:13:25.901 --> 00:13:30.880
All the other things.
That's crazy that that's going on in 2012 you know,

220
00:13:30.881 --> 00:13:34.900
because we have this sort of distorted perception of safety.
Oh it's,

221
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.190
<v 3>I don't trust when people are like,
like strangers.</v>

222
00:13:38.191 --> 00:13:41.520
Like this week I was in Cleveland and the manager of the club was like,
Oh,

223
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.730
me take you to the market in Cleveland.
I was like,
no,
I don't know man.

224
00:13:44.731 --> 00:13:48.160
I don't know you.
Yeah.

225
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.750
It talks about like is this guy on the level?
Like,
I don't trust anybody.

226
00:13:51.751 --> 00:13:54.330
You're right.
You're right to not.
Yeah,
but then you have never know.

227
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.250
You asked me like,
is he going to kill me?

228
00:13:56.251 --> 00:13:58.920
Is you're going to come at me and I was like,
I don't think so.
Well,

229
00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:02.790
I grew up in la,
man.
Yeah.
I'm street savvy.
I don't leave windows open at night.

230
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:07.440
Yeah.
Yeah.
She's real trust.
Anyway.
You should fear more.
Should be.
Yeah.

231
00:14:07.441 --> 00:14:11.640
If you grow up in La,
yeah.
Tonight's the night.

232
00:14:11.641 --> 00:14:15.410
You remember the name Richard Ramirez as a child,
you should,

233
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.240
he couldn't sleep with your window open because like I was going to come in and

234
00:14:18.241 --> 00:14:23.190
steal you and like,
fuck that.
Oh,
my dad didn't give a fuck.
My Dad is Hungarian.

235
00:14:23.191 --> 00:14:25.950
Like,
he's like,
I don't give a fuck.
Fuck Richard Ramirez.

236
00:14:25.951 --> 00:14:29.400
I killed that cock soccer trophy.
All right,
man.

237
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.250
But he liked to listen to the police scanner to my dad

238
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.480
<v 1>and like figure out what crime was going on.
That's hilarious.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

239
00:14:36.481 --> 00:14:38.610
Richard Ramirez was a scary guy.
You know a lot of women.

240
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.460
<v 3>Mary that day or there.
Yeah,
he's married.</v>

241
00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.820
<v 1>Yeah.
Good for him.
Yeah.
I hope that she works out.
Yeah.</v>

242
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.360
That's a terrifying dude.
Yeah.
He did some horrible things to me.
He was caught.

243
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:53.660
He was caught by citizens.
That's crazy.
How did he catch him?

244
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:57.670
He was leaving the scene.
He had tried to murder somebody or he may be,

245
00:14:57.671 --> 00:15:02.671
he did murder one of the people and he was I getting to his car and people

246
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.490
tackled him.
He was,
he was tackled by everyday people.
Whoa.

247
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.100
Because this picture was all over the news at that point.
Like this was like,

248
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:10.963
oh my God.

249
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.690
Imagine how horrifying that would feel to see that guy in your neighborhood

250
00:15:14.691 --> 00:15:18.160
after his picture had been all over the news and the areas right there.
Yeah.

251
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:24.200
That,
that uh,
wow.
And held him down.
I didn't,
they beat him to death.

252
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.250
That's a good question.
Really good question.
I haven't read the story in a while,

253
00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.870
but I'm pretty sure it would have beat him to death.

254
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.850
I don't even think I would have thought twice about it.
Probably.
I,

255
00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:36.130
I would've got a gun in his hand too,
but I,

256
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.120
I would've beat that guy to death for sure.

257
00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.420
I don't think you get in trouble for it.
Right.
I don't care.

258
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.190
It's a real piece of shit like that.
I would say I lost my mind.

259
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:48.200
I want a temporary and Santa Fe
and I would,
I would go temporary and saying,

260
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:51.980
could you imagine if maybe if perhaps he killed somebody,
you know,

261
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.780
or you were worried he was going to kill somebody.
You know,

262
00:15:53.781 --> 00:15:55.730
like you were thinking about him killing your mom or something like that.

263
00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:57.440
They'll have fucking crazy you can get.

264
00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.230
Have you ever thought somebody was going to kill you at any point in your life?

265
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:02.330
No.
Yes.

266
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:06.130
There was a time when I was like a stupid teenager and I was high and I take it,

267
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.553
you know,

268
00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.540
there's somebody that was driving me was on acid when I was like a teenager.

269
00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:18.680
If you look at serial killers,
that's the creepiest thing ever.

270
00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.040
The creepiest thing ever was people that just decide they get a kick out of

271
00:16:22.041 --> 00:16:25.730
killing people,
so they'll look to try to find people to kill,
get a rush on.

272
00:16:25.731 --> 00:16:28.430
It could just be in the wrong place at the wrong time and run into one of those

273
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.810
motherfuckers that's,
you know,
and,
and there's no,
you know,

274
00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:36.650
there's no rationale to like why they want to kill certain people or just have a

275
00:16:36.651 --> 00:16:41.600
thing for certain people didn't like brunettes.
Sapper net broke his heart.

276
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.320
So all the girls who got were Burnett.
You know,

277
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:50.380
I have met a lot of dudes that I don't think were serial killers,

278
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.990
but I think developed a hate for women,

279
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.440
like a real hate over years and years of rejection.

280
00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.150
Egos can't handle it.

281
00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:02.300
And they decide that there's something wrong with that person because there

282
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.570
you're constantly associating that person with negative feelings.

283
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:10.160
You know what I mean?
Like they always associate women with being rejected,

284
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.880
being humiliated.
It was being mocked and laughed at.
And it does.

285
00:17:13.881 --> 00:17:17.630
So they associate them with pain and their meager brains just starting to able

286
00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:20.780
to,
to realize that that's just a person.
That person doesn't owe you shit,

287
00:17:20.781 --> 00:17:23.590
and you're really not that attractive and why we would,

288
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.820
why would she want to fuck you,
asshole.
You know,

289
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.310
just think about what you're offering her,
you know,

290
00:17:28.311 --> 00:17:29.690
I don't know how you could fix that,

291
00:17:29.691 --> 00:17:32.000
but that's what you need to concentrate on instead of concentrating on what

292
00:17:32.001 --> 00:17:35.360
people like,
you know,
getting angry at people for not liking you.

293
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.750
And that gets to be a weird thing morphs into a bigger thing too.

294
00:17:38.751 --> 00:17:41.480
Cause they had to just get to sit on it and think about it.

295
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:45.410
So it becomes like a bigger picture thing for them.
They're like all women.

296
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:50.460
I felt that before I've walked into like radio,
like radio stations

297
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.910
<v 3>and the assumption is maybe they've seen photographs of me and they're like,
oh,</v>

298
00:17:53.911 --> 00:17:55.710
she's going to be a conti blonde.

299
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.670
And I also sometimes I sense it like the assumption is that I'll be a dick to

300
00:17:59.671 --> 00:18:03.720
them.
And I'm like,
no way.
I'm not saying that I'm like the hottest,
but you know,

301
00:18:03.721 --> 00:18:06.510
I think the assumption is if you're somewhat attractive girl,

302
00:18:06.511 --> 00:18:09.660
you're going to be a douche bag.
I know Ra didn't really like girls

303
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:15.360
or I your fear,
he and I ended up podcast.
He came over and uh,

304
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:16.620
I just sensed the heat.

305
00:18:16.621 --> 00:18:20.790
He has that thing with some girls or he thinks that like we hate him,

306
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.800
but yeah,
we hashed it out.
The handsome fella,
but he,

307
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.890
he gets really attractive girls,
comedian,
but

308
00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:37.210
he's
going to have to deal with a certain amount of rejection.
Yeah.

309
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.330
But I mean he's cold.
What do you mean though that he does,

310
00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.570
that's what it was.
That he doesn't like women.
Yeah.

311
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:49.080
I think that he did have some rejection.
Yes,
absolutely.

312
00:18:49.081 --> 00:18:50.910
Cause he's had his heart smashed I think,

313
00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:55.680
but he'd go looking broads and uh,
yeah.
I mean when he came over,

314
00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.980
it's based on what,

315
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.200
how many women or you're interacting with and where are you at in your life

316
00:19:01.201 --> 00:19:02.370
while you're interacting with them.

317
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.430
Sometimes the relationship means more than it should to you because you're,

318
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.460
you don't have a whole lot of shit going on outside of it.

319
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.930
You know what I mean?
Like my feelings on relationships are always,

320
00:19:15.931 --> 00:19:18.810
if someone doesn't want to be with me anymore,
I don't want them to be with me.

321
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.960
Yeah.
And that's cool.
And the gang and you know,

322
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.720
good luck with whatever you're on too.
But what did,

323
00:19:24.721 --> 00:19:28.740
what did I already say though?
Oh No,
cause I brought it up.
I was like,

324
00:19:28.741 --> 00:19:32.850
I have this,
I feel this unspoken animosity that you have towards me,

325
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:36.480
like over the years.
Cause I had,
and I thought,
you know,
maybe I'm projecting,

326
00:19:36.481 --> 00:19:41.400
maybe that's my bullshit that I'm projecting on him.
And a,
and I was like,

327
00:19:41.401 --> 00:19:44.790
I just sense that you don't like girls,
like you hate women and that,

328
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.550
and he's like,
you know,
maybe a little bit your road,
cause I can't,

329
00:19:47.551 --> 00:19:51.330
I came up with the comedy store and I was rolling with those boys.
I mean,

330
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:55.690
so I think he had a little bit of the comedy store like David.
None.

331
00:19:55.691 --> 00:19:59.700
No on you not,
you know.
Yeah.
Like those boys,
they're kind of shitty.

332
00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.970
And I think the assumption he had is that if you're a cute girl,

333
00:20:02.971 --> 00:20:06.830
that you get ahead and comedy faster,
which I don't know if it's true,
maybe not.

334
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.630
You recognize it and you know what?

335
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:15.900
Real quality will always shine anyway.
It doesn't matter if someone's,
uh,

336
00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.570
you know,
if someone's getting through just because they're cute,

337
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:22.800
there's their quality of their work is going to be exposed and you can't go

338
00:20:22.801 --> 00:20:25.470
forever.
What's good is good.

339
00:20:25.471 --> 00:20:28.290
And if someone gets a little advantage because they're hot,
good for them,

340
00:20:28.291 --> 00:20:29.790
they get it.
They got a lucky break.

341
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.240
And since when is show business ameritocracy one fucking thing that's all hate

342
00:20:35.351 --> 00:20:36.840
or bullshit.
That's all that is.

343
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:40.050
All that stuff is just hate or bullshit worrying about other people getting

344
00:20:40.051 --> 00:20:42.660
ahead.
It's so dumb.
It's the dumbest stuff that,

345
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:47.320
that Comedians and entertainers and I'm sure folks in all sorts of walks life,

346
00:20:47.321 --> 00:20:48.100
entertainment

347
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.060
<v 0>themselves with.</v>

348
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:53.650
They left their mind go into these unfixable little circles where you,
you know,

349
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:58.240
you look at someone else's success if somehow or another that's like bad for

350
00:20:58.241 --> 00:21:01.350
you.
Yeah.
Like it hurt you,
you know,
you make,

351
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:05.380
you feel like inadequate or whatever.
You know,
you,
you should look at that,

352
00:21:05.381 --> 00:21:08.950
whatever it is and use all that shit and be inspired.

353
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:09.821
That's what you should do it.

354
00:21:09.821 --> 00:21:13.420
You should say this is even if someone you fucking hate is doing well,

355
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.240
he should say,
Whoa,
this makes me want to work hard.

356
00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:19.870
This makes me want to push this.
It makes me want to get ahead,
use it,

357
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.920
use it as inspiration.
But don't ever let yourself get to that.

358
00:21:23.921 --> 00:21:27.320
Who the fuck dude is fucking guys?
No,
you fucking socks would've,

359
00:21:27.321 --> 00:21:30.610
oh me can't get to that state of mind cause that's a negative.

360
00:21:30.611 --> 00:21:34.570
Just as a shit sloshy no progress.

361
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:39.580
Wishy washy state of mind.
It's a bitch.
It's a bitch state of mind.
You know,

362
00:21:39.581 --> 00:21:43.030
and we've all done it.
I did it a bunch when I was,
when I first started out,

363
00:21:43.031 --> 00:21:47.180
you know,
and we're doing what it was.
I was too competitive,
you know,

364
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.420
getting involved in like open mic nights.

365
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.660
Like everyone was like competitive about like who did well,

366
00:21:52.661 --> 00:21:55.570
who did and it was just a part,
we didn't know what the fuck we're doing.

367
00:21:55.571 --> 00:21:57.580
You know,
we're open miker it's,
we don't know what we're doing.

368
00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.420
But I think there was,
there's a little something to,
you know,

369
00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:06.640
to being competitive with like your peers.
But it should never be negative.

370
00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:11.670
You got to keep it from being something where it's like a consuming thing where

371
00:22:11.951 --> 00:22:15.880
it like gets you just you.
When I see people and I've,
I've seen it,

372
00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:20.380
I've seen it firsthand like recently comics that we're talking about a comic

373
00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:24.100
that was successful and they were talking shit about him and I,
and I was,

374
00:22:24.101 --> 00:22:27.200
I was listening to them talking shit about them and I can see the,

375
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:31.870
<v 2>it didn't matter what they were saying,
they were basically being,</v>

376
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:38.400
you know,
it's that state that state,
that debt.

377
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:41.850
It doesn't matter what words are coming out.
That's a shitty state of mind.

378
00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:45.900
You know,
you can't say,
if the guy's doing well,

379
00:22:45.901 --> 00:22:48.990
that means someone's liking him.
All right.
And you might,
you know,

380
00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.140
not like certain aspects of his work,
but it's,

381
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:56.310
it was a really bug you that much or is what's really bugging you.

382
00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:01.050
The fact that this guy is doing something,
doing enough with your own.

383
00:23:01.051 --> 00:23:01.740
Exactly.

384
00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:06.020
That's usually what it is when you're like something's wrong with you man.
Yeah.

385
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:07.613
Judging them on

386
00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.720
<v 0>know.
I mean,
look,
there's going to be stuff you like and stuff you don't like.</v>

387
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.250
There's always going to be that and it like,

388
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:13.760
I went to see that cabin in the woods.

389
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:18.250
<v 2>Oh,
loved it.
I knew you would love it.
Stupid as fuck.
Ridiculous movie.</v>

390
00:23:18.251 --> 00:23:22.930
Had a great drop his movies.
He sits by me sometimes like I'm on board,

391
00:23:22.931 --> 00:23:26.170
but most of the time I'm like really surprised your rotten tomatoes gave it a

392
00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:30.670
91% okay.
91 yeah.
And Eddie's like towards fuck movie.

393
00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.021
Oh my God.

394
00:23:32.021 --> 00:23:35.770
I enjoyed the shit out of it and he describes it is like fucking porn coming out

395
00:23:35.771 --> 00:23:38.140
of his mouth slowly.
They have Brian's like too.

396
00:23:38.141 --> 00:23:40.770
This might be your favorite movie was even where Wilson,

397
00:23:40.771 --> 00:23:44.470
I know people get jacked by where,
what is it?
That's why I left.

398
00:23:44.471 --> 00:23:48.350
That's why I went to bathroom.
It's a crazy hybrid,

399
00:23:48.351 --> 00:23:53.240
weird fucking movie.
It's kind of silly.
Like there's,
it's almost like,
yes,

400
00:23:53.241 --> 00:23:56.090
yes.
But there's almost aspects of it where you could consider it a comedy.

401
00:23:56.091 --> 00:23:58.850
Like I see what Eddie was saying.
It was totally over the top,

402
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:02.390
but really fucking fun.
Really Fun.

403
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:07.190
Stupid Ass fucking horror movie with a massive twist.

404
00:24:07.191 --> 00:24:10.880
The twist I won't get into,
but uh,
I enjoyed the shit out of it.

405
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.550
I enjoyed the show about man.
Yeah.
Yeah man.

406
00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:18.320
I'm not in the movies till to like have it mimic real life and have things be

407
00:24:18.321 --> 00:24:23.140
completely random and unpredictable.
I guess what?
I have a real life.
Okay.
Yeah.

408
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.350
I'm going to the movies.
I want to see monsters.
Okay.

409
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:30.380
I want to see explosions and aliens and Ufo shows are a fucking bummer.

410
00:24:30.381 --> 00:24:35.240
Movies when you see the trailer,
when we were like,
no,

411
00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:39.440
I don't want to see that silent movie.
Yeah.
Movie can suck.
It

412
00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:46.623
<v 4>know</v>

413
00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:52.380
I don't need any more art.

414
00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:57.500
<v 2>I don't know.
It was,
it
was like,
what is it?</v>

415
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.300
Cancer.
And then I shot my son

416
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:07.810
is amazing and I'm like,
no,
it's not a,
it's not pressing bummed out.

417
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.200
I'm not anything getting bummed out.
This is supposed to be entertainment for me.

418
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:14.410
These motherfuckers take themselves so seriously and just cause you can depict

419
00:25:14.411 --> 00:25:18.810
something depressing and it depresses me.
It doesn't mean it's good.
Yeah.
Okay.

420
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:21.920
And did,
you did a really good job of making something fucking depressing.
Yeah,

421
00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.520
that's not good.
Could you do,

422
00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:28.150
were like if comedy had so much leeway and we get depressing stand up,

423
00:25:28.151 --> 00:25:30.550
I guess a lot of standup would be kind of depressing.

424
00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.510
It would be the most depressing shit in the world of comics just were like,

425
00:25:34.511 --> 00:25:36.250
I'm going to share it.
They told the truth like,

426
00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:41.410
I'm going to share this file with no jokes.
Ready?
Yeah.
Ooh,

427
00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.800
yeah.
Shit.
That negative,

428
00:25:44.801 --> 00:25:48.160
that negative shit you're talking about where like comics going like fuck that.

429
00:25:48.161 --> 00:25:50.740
You know where you see that a lot is when you do the road,

430
00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.340
you run into other comics on the road who are,

431
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.700
and a lot of times they'll start with like,
I used to live in La and you're like,

432
00:25:57.701 --> 00:26:01.010
oh yeah,
fuck that place man.
You're like,
yeah,
you're,

433
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.840
it goes right open up.
And then they do the whole like,
you know,

434
00:26:04.841 --> 00:26:05.860
it's all bullshit.

435
00:26:05.861 --> 00:26:08.080
And I just realized like it doesn't even matter if you're any good at it.

436
00:26:08.081 --> 00:26:10.000
And I'm like,
no,
I think it does matter if you're good at it.

437
00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:12.070
I think that helps a lot and they're,
you know,

438
00:26:12.071 --> 00:26:15.550
they give you the whole speech or like it's all shit and that's why I left.

439
00:26:15.551 --> 00:26:20.240
I used to do it,
but no,
I like it here in fucking podunk,
Iowa.
Yeah.

440
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.660
Yeah.
Good man.
I think you're here.
You're going to run shit in this town.

441
00:26:23.661 --> 00:26:27.400
Have no time.
So just stay here.
The worse.
Then as the night goes on,

442
00:26:27.401 --> 00:26:32.401
he starts drinking and gets even more bitter and towards the end the La guy

443
00:26:34.001 --> 00:26:38.830
yells,
hey guys,
here,
we should let him talk.
He's yellow guy.

444
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:43.060
When I moved down here,
my uncle goes,
I used to live in La.
I hated,

445
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.010
and I was like,
oh.
And like so like when he said goodbye,
it was just like,
yeah,

446
00:26:47.011 --> 00:26:48.900
by the way,
I used to live there.
It fucking sucks.

447
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:53.670
That was just for his good bye message.
Wow.
I love when people tell me

448
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:59.850
it's my favorite.
I'm like,
that's cool.
Then I love it.
They're like,

449
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:02.010
I enjoyed myself.
I've never even been here.

450
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.920
Always has a lot of bullshit,

451
00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:09.060
but it's got a lot of great stuff.
I love my neighborhood.

452
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.600
There's a lot of great stuff and I learned about the comedy clubs.
I mean,

453
00:27:12.601 --> 00:27:16.650
where is it that you have a city that has the Pasadena Ice House was only 20

454
00:27:16.651 --> 00:27:19.980
minutes away.
Okay.
You got right there on Melrose,
you got the Improv,

455
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.600
one of the greatest clubs in the country get to laugh,

456
00:27:21.601 --> 00:27:25.500
stop or the laugh factory rather.
And the comic store all in one.

457
00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.010
You got her Mosa.
Yeah,
and you've got Hermosa beach comedy and Magic Club.

458
00:27:29.011 --> 00:27:33.960
That's another
that way it's pretty fucked.

459
00:27:33.961 --> 00:27:36.690
No La in general,
just,
you know,

460
00:27:36.691 --> 00:27:39.660
it it besides the gangs and all that crap,

461
00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:41.970
but just the fact that there's a lot of drugs out here,

462
00:27:41.971 --> 00:27:46.400
there's a lot of fucking fast cars.
There's a lot of people making it.
Yeah.

463
00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:49.550
The seasons out here,
it just seems like everything.

464
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:56.060
I see it all the time though.
Like I see like,
oh,

465
00:27:56.061 --> 00:27:59.390
I'll be on sunset at three in the morning and suddenly like a Ferrari goes down

466
00:27:59.391 --> 00:28:01.910
the street going like 200 and you're like,
really?
You just blew like,

467
00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.560
like three red lights right there.
That's crazy.

468
00:28:04.561 --> 00:28:07.120
This is for the shitty part of the city.
Oh,
these fast,

469
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.910
real problem with the city is Lamborghinis.

470
00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:16.250
I'm just saying in general that there is a,
it's not like normal,

471
00:28:16.251 --> 00:28:18.150
the people out here in the entertainment business,

472
00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.660
they're in a certain kind of field of jobs,

473
00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.150
different thinking than say a normal city where you have a little bit of

474
00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.900
everything.
You know,
you have a little bit of people that are bankers,
farmers,

475
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:33.730
you know,
like it's,
it's definitely crazy.
I mean I see shit all the time.

476
00:28:33.731 --> 00:28:37.090
Then I'm like,
if my mom saw that,
that would be crazy if my mom just saw that.

477
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:41.350
Yeah,
I agree with you.
And to a certain extent,

478
00:28:41.351 --> 00:28:43.750
but it's also the circles you run in.
I mean you're,

479
00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.630
you're running around and going to these crazy parties and hanging out with

480
00:28:46.631 --> 00:28:51.220
these weird people like your UAB at a karaoke bar across the street from NBC

481
00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:57.160
in Burbank and Burbank.
That's odd.
But that didn't happen though.
But you know,

482
00:28:57.161 --> 00:28:58.600
whenever there's a bar it's the,

483
00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:02.080
you run into the possibility that someone might try to rob people coming out of

484
00:29:02.081 --> 00:29:06.040
the bar cause people were drunk and when drunk people come out of a bar and you

485
00:29:06.041 --> 00:29:10.600
rob,
I'm like,
what the fuck are the cops going to do about that?
You know,

486
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:13.720
the cops are going to,
what is your perception going to be like,

487
00:29:13.721 --> 00:29:14.950
what is the story going to be like?

488
00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.050
Did you really remember what the guy looked like?
You know what I mean?

489
00:29:17.051 --> 00:29:19.450
If you're hammered,
right?
The cops are talking to and you're like,
yeah,

490
00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.320
I think the guy fucking pruning man,

491
00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:27.310
where's my money man?
The cops gotta be like,

492
00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:32.390
all right sir.
Um,
okay.
You say it was black.
Yeah.
Come on.

493
00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.480
Good luck with that.
That's the perfect guy to rob.

494
00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:37.980
So it might not have necessarily been that Burbank is dangerous.

495
00:29:37.981 --> 00:29:40.990
It might have been so many targeted that bar people do shit.

496
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:41.980
You are right though that

497
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.390
<v 1>like when you're on the road is bad.
So I should be like,</v>

498
00:29:43.391 --> 00:29:45.040
if you spend like four or five days,

499
00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:47.860
you go out kind of more of the third and fourth day and you're like,

500
00:29:47.861 --> 00:29:52.300
this is a different speed.
Like a smaller city,
you know?
This is way different.

501
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:55.060
Yeah.
Well when I lived in Colorado and then I came back to here,

502
00:29:55.061 --> 00:29:57.520
I noticed a huge difference in the way people drive.

503
00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:02.800
You know people drive 50% faster here.
Everywhere.
Yeah.
It was fast cars,

504
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:03.634
man.
Yeah.

505
00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:08.080
Did they cut a lot of people off and they don't use blinkers as much and it's

506
00:30:08.081 --> 00:30:10.220
like way less courteous I feel.

507
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:15.220
I still feel like a south Florida holds tha tha tha tha tha trophy on that one.

508
00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:21.900
There's nothing like it as you go down 95 it just,

509
00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.940
you hit a lot of debt and then once you get to like northern Dade county are

510
00:30:24.941 --> 00:30:28.750
like,
Holy Shit Dude.
I did the Fort Lauderdale Improv this weekend.

511
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:33.400
What a fucking great club.
Yeah,
that's great.
Club.
What a fun time.

512
00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:37.480
I guess I did it last night.
No night before last.
What's the night before?

513
00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:42.120
I can't remember what day it is.
Fort Lauderdale was fucking amazing.
Yeah,

514
00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:47.050
it was amazing.
Great crowds.
It's a good room that they're wild and crazy people.

515
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:51.160
Yeah,
they're crazy people.
I feel like you have to turn it up.

516
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:54.670
That's how tired I am.
I forgot about yesterday for a half a second.
I know.

517
00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:59.980
It's ridiculous.
One Lauderdale's nuts,
man.
It's a wild place,
man.

518
00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:03.860
They fucking party hard down there.
Fort Lauderdale I think.
I think all of that,

519
00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.350
Florida is all about,
you know,

520
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:09.490
you go down there and you realize that if you go actually into Miami that you

521
00:31:09.491 --> 00:31:09.930
can,

522
00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:14.930
you can go to places that close at five and that open at 5:30 AM for the after

523
00:31:16.451 --> 00:31:18.190
party and it's not that right.

524
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.890
So they clean up for half hour and then they just go to another place.

525
00:31:20.891 --> 00:31:23.800
By the time you get there,
that shit to open and that's,
you know,
you can go,

526
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:27.430
you can party until noon.
Cheese,
break it down.

527
00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:31.140
There's no other like what to go on and on.
Yeah.

528
00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:35.530
You can fucking all kinds of crayons there in Miami.
Oh,

529
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:38.270
well when I was in Fort Lauderdale I,

530
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.140
I asked him what time is the last call and they said,

531
00:31:41.141 --> 00:31:45.010
it's 5:00 AM 5:00 AM 5:00 AM and I'm like,
that's because of cocaine,

532
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.530
cocaine.
I changed that law and Shit.
Does it make sense?

533
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:55.390
Everywhere else is like to New York it's like four and they're like,

534
00:31:55.391 --> 00:31:59.820
no,
five five.
How about an extra hour to move product

535
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:05.110
cocaine belt?
Well you got to think people are buying coke.

536
00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:09.520
That's the hours they're going to be buying coke.
There's two to five hours.

537
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:14.260
Exactly.
Let's keep the,
let's keep the party girl.

538
00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:15.940
It's not a 3:00 PM purchase when you

539
00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.380
get back to the gym that I should get them to a bump

540
00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.130
and that you think about it or actually I should do it.

541
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.980
We should do some coke right now.
God,

542
00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.990
so many people that did a lot of coke early on in their life,

543
00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:36.600
they have big problems when they get older,
their,
their,

544
00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:42.000
their neurological system.
Like Richard Pryor had a big problem and Mitzi shore,

545
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:45.530
I dunno if she really did a lot of,
I should probably not say,
I don't know.

546
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:50.000
That's rumor.
I know a bunch of different people besides that that have had like,

547
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:52.880
like real serious issues with their body.

548
00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:57.830
I always had a bit worry about because I just had a fear of that.
You know,

549
00:32:57.831 --> 00:33:01.310
sometimes the scare tactic works.
Like when I saw the,
like there'd be like,

550
00:33:01.311 --> 00:33:02.420
you know,
you can do it,
do cocaine.

551
00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.840
One time we get a heart attack and somehow it got into my brain when I was young

552
00:33:05.841 --> 00:33:08.980
enough where I was totally scared to try it.
It's just too expensive,
man.

553
00:33:08.981 --> 00:33:11.570
I like every time I did it,
I used,
I used to be like,
fuck,

554
00:33:11.571 --> 00:33:14.720
that was like an intender game,
you know?
Like that,
that's,

555
00:33:14.721 --> 00:33:17.660
that was a lot of money.
That was half my paycheck.

556
00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:23.460
Is it that you do it?
Never done that now I'm scared of it.
Scared.
Yeah.
You know,

557
00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:27.440
I grew up in a lot of kids did crystal,
that was like the crystal math.
Oh yeah,

558
00:33:27.441 --> 00:33:32.030
we talked about this.
Yeah.
I don't know.
It's so groaty but you know,

559
00:33:32.031 --> 00:33:33.920
you can always tell when someone was a tweaker.

560
00:33:33.921 --> 00:33:38.330
Like I've had some ex tweaker bosses who like they can't handle more than one

561
00:33:38.331 --> 00:33:41.510
thing at a time.
Like is they get out of it?

562
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:46.600
Nothing.
I'm,
I'm fascinated by the insight,

563
00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:51.000
the mind really fast.
So what he's saying this,
I'm really getting excited.
Okay.

564
00:33:51.001 --> 00:33:54.110
I used to work retail like on Melrose at some shitty clothing store.

565
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:58.220
It was called no problem.
That's when you're sweeping up Puerto Rican,

566
00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:00.793
Puerto Rican guy.

567
00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:04.790
And I remember how this boss who like if somebody came in the door and she had

568
00:34:04.791 --> 00:34:07.100
to ring somebody up at the register at the same time,

569
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:11.630
it was like a total meltdown.
Like her brain couldn't process two things at once.

570
00:34:11.631 --> 00:34:15.200
And I know she was a tweaker and the past and you can just see them,

571
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:18.230
like my step sisters kind of like that too.
She used to do math,

572
00:34:18.231 --> 00:34:23.210
so she's all like,
Ooh.
Like they just tell by the face that gaunt,

573
00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.930
they always have the like,
like there's like the,
yeah,

574
00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.820
some of the teeth have offset,
you know,

575
00:34:28.821 --> 00:34:32.720
like that some of them replaced and it's like a look,
they're twitchy.

576
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.410
They picked it too many times.
Just to get the scabs,
you know,

577
00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:39.050
like they used to be this tweaker that used to hang around the pool hall that I

578
00:34:39.051 --> 00:34:40.890
used to go to and uh,

579
00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:44.480
I don't want to say her name because she might still be alive and if she's still

580
00:34:44.481 --> 00:34:46.550
alive,
she probably listens to this podcast.

581
00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:50.960
So let's just call her ex.
Okay.
That's her name.

582
00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:55.580
And she was a,
no,
call it x.
So it wasn't anybody's ex,

583
00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:57.420
she was every,

584
00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:01.310
I mean I never saw a single guide that was,

585
00:35:01.311 --> 00:35:03.590
I mean she wasn't particularly ugly,

586
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:09.160
but she was so cracked out all the time that it was just really odd to be around

587
00:35:12.351 --> 00:35:12.441
her.

588
00:35:12.441 --> 00:35:16.910
It's like you were around someone who was going through a dream and she would

589
00:35:16.911 --> 00:35:20.270
like play pool by herself,
like stair guys,
the eyes.

590
00:35:20.271 --> 00:35:24.500
And she was crazy and we all like,
she became like almost sort of family there.

591
00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:29.360
She was there so often that,
you know,
she would like Sorta Kinda hit on guys.

592
00:35:29.361 --> 00:35:32.450
But she was so crazy.
Like nobody wanted to have anything to do with her.

593
00:35:32.451 --> 00:35:34.100
I mean she was completely insane,

594
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:37.530
but she became like almost like RL crackhead mascot

595
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:41.210
<v 0>all the time.
It should come in.
Yeah,</v>

596
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:44.910
she would come in and play pool and I even think she got a job cleaning up at

597
00:35:44.911 --> 00:35:47.010
one point in time.
They gave her like some hours.

598
00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:50.610
You guys used to take turns on her like when you got really drunk in the alley.

599
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:54.060
It's crazy.
As pool hall,
people are desperate,

600
00:35:54.061 --> 00:35:58.140
especially 24 hour gambling pool hall places,
which is this place was,

601
00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:03.350
nobody fucked her.
Nobody Dude,
pretty bad.
It was bad.
But she was a,

602
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:05.040
she was a sweetheart of a person.

603
00:36:05.041 --> 00:36:08.700
I didn't ever communicate with her enough to go,
hey,
like what are you doing?

604
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:12.490
Like what?
What's going on?
What are you doing?
Crank,
you know,
you're doing,

605
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:17.520
what is it?
You know,
I didn't,
I never got to that conversation,
but man,
she was,

606
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:20.310
she would have these weird moments where she would like,

607
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:22.250
you think maybe you're not go to dinner,

608
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:29.670
don't start dinner and just talk on,
I can't,
I can't go to dinner.

609
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:33.330
I have a girlfriend.
I can't go to dinner with anybody else but her,
well,
okay,

610
00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.490
should we go over it like play pool and like stare at you?

611
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.940
She was really like a character in a movie.
I remember me and my friend,

612
00:36:41.941 --> 00:36:43.410
me and my friend Johnny B,
we're sitting there,

613
00:36:43.411 --> 00:36:46.260
we're watching her once and she was giving us like crazy googly eyes while she

614
00:36:46.261 --> 00:36:47.850
was knocking balls around the table.

615
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.670
She would play pool for like 20 minutes at a time and then like bring the balls

616
00:36:50.671 --> 00:36:53.130
back.
So while she's doing this,
she's playing,

617
00:36:53.131 --> 00:36:55.950
doing googly eyes and Johnny looks at me and my friend Johnny was like,

618
00:36:55.951 --> 00:36:59.700
this is really streetwise kid.
He goes,
Yo dog.
He goes,

619
00:36:59.701 --> 00:37:03.420
you put her in a movie and people would say it's too over the top.

620
00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:08.100
They go,
you gotta cut that CAC to back.
Nobody's going to believe this character.

621
00:37:08.101 --> 00:37:12.150
Some fucking crazy bitch comes in all meth out and starts shooting balls around

622
00:37:12.151 --> 00:37:15.450
giving people googly eyes and she would put like a leg up in the air,
what?

623
00:37:15.451 --> 00:37:18.270
She would make a shot and try and be like a ballerina or something.

624
00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:23.100
She was completely cranked out.
It was really fascinating because she wasn't,

625
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:27.990
she wasn't that old,
you know?
She was like,
I believe she was probably 30 ish,

626
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:32.980
somewhere in our thirties just
drugs though.
Yeah.

627
00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:38.340
It seemed like there might've been some crazy mixed in with the drugs too,

628
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.070
but it seems like there was a little bit of self medicate or going on.

629
00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.420
I liked it.
There's always with,

630
00:37:42.421 --> 00:37:46.230
with that type of person with a crazy and or drug person,
there's,
there's a,

631
00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:51.150
a real line between like you being around them and being amused and then backing

632
00:37:51.151 --> 00:37:52.920
off because you're kind of scared of them,
you know?

633
00:37:52.921 --> 00:37:57.560
Even if they're not scary and not like physically imposing,
right?
Like it's,
it's,

634
00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:02.430
it's so big and so crazy what they do that you have fear on some level of like

635
00:38:02.431 --> 00:38:06.390
how weird and crazy they get.
Right,
right.
Like if it's a little bit less,

636
00:38:06.391 --> 00:38:08.940
you're like,
oh,
this is funny.
Like he's just kind of fucked up right now.

637
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:12.100
But then it goes over that line and you're like,
this is terrifying.
You know,

638
00:38:12.101 --> 00:38:15.450
when they're there kind of,
this is too much.
Yeah.
Well,

639
00:38:15.451 --> 00:38:17.940
you wonder what their perception of reality is.
Like.
Well,

640
00:38:17.941 --> 00:38:19.590
they're not the good control themselves.

641
00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:22.990
That's somebody that could randomly killed somebody usually,
you know,

642
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:26.280
if you oh yeah,
yeah.

643
00:38:26.281 --> 00:38:28.230
If someone's fucking completely mapped out,

644
00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:31.260
how much did they even know about what they're actually doing?
A lot of it,

645
00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:32.430
like if you just watched cops,

646
00:38:32.431 --> 00:38:36.130
he see that that episode all the time where they're like in la La

647
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.990
<v 1>land,
they would believe and do anything.</v>

648
00:38:37.991 --> 00:38:40.810
They think Abraham Lincoln's chasing them,
you know,
it's uh,

649
00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:42.880
it was a stay up for days.

650
00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:47.560
Like you don't sleep on Matt and methods isn't a Methodist kind of like a speed,

651
00:38:47.561 --> 00:38:51.700
right?
It's made of like battery acid and like sue deaf friend,

652
00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:55.950
like we stopped selling.
It's pre-comm crayons,

653
00:38:56.430 --> 00:39:00.130
rainbows,
speed effect.
But it doesn't give you a visual effect.
Right?

654
00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.301
It gives you,

655
00:39:01.301 --> 00:39:06.250
it totally impairs your judgment on top of like spiking you through the roof

656
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:10.870
like you have in your brain.
You know,
what stops you from doing certain things?

657
00:39:10.871 --> 00:39:13.930
Your,
your ability to make a judgment on like,

658
00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.110
I shouldn't drive 150 down this road,
you know,

659
00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:21.610
because of the dangers that apply.
All that goes out.
That's why they,
they,

660
00:39:21.611 --> 00:39:23.770
you know,
if you seen like I survived,

661
00:39:23.771 --> 00:39:28.210
the woman was like kidnapped and these people that were messed out just stabbing

662
00:39:28.211 --> 00:39:32.410
her and cutting or slicing and they came back and they hit her with a call and

663
00:39:32.411 --> 00:39:36.730
set her on fire.
Oh my God.
And when they,

664
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:37.870
when they arrested them,
you know,

665
00:39:37.871 --> 00:39:39.700
they were all tweaked out and later on they were all like,

666
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:44.290
I didn't know that we did all that shit.
She's crazy.

667
00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:48.580
That's why you should do cocaine and
the drug.

668
00:39:48.581 --> 00:39:51.070
It's a grownup drug if you can afford.
It

669
00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:54.400
<v 0>seems like some people just want to escape reality.</v>

670
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:57.240
I mean you to beat a person in this day and age,

671
00:39:57.241 --> 00:39:59.440
it's still wants to try math for the first time.

672
00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:02.590
You must fucking hate your reality.

673
00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:07.030
Your reality must suck so bad at the idea of being horribly addicted to one of

674
00:40:07.031 --> 00:40:09.930
the worst drugs ever created.
It doesn't even faze you.
Yeah.
You're like,

675
00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:12.580
I'm going to try it.
But at least heroines came up with some,

676
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:16.420
I mean it had been connected by,
there's some great musicians,
you know,

677
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:18.250
I mean Kurt Cobain,

678
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:22.420
I ended a discussion with some friends about a Hendrick's cause I always say

679
00:40:22.421 --> 00:40:25.120
that Hendricks did heroin and they were always known as acid,

680
00:40:25.121 --> 00:40:27.010
but it turns out he actually got arrested for heroin.

681
00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.690
You got arrested in Toronto for heroin.

682
00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:32.600
So he definitely had some use of heroin is definitely a correlation between

683
00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:34.100
heroin and good music.
Yeah,
I mean I don't,

684
00:40:34.101 --> 00:40:35.920
I don't want to say that that was his number one thing,

685
00:40:35.921 --> 00:40:39.580
but I mean the Hendricks obviously was really an asset as well and obviously a

686
00:40:39.581 --> 00:40:41.050
fucking musical genius.

687
00:40:41.051 --> 00:40:45.370
There was just some shit that some dude can tune into that,
you know,

688
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:49.370
the average person can't and he could just,
he could just nail it,
you know,

689
00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:53.260
I don't think,
I think he would have been fucking amazing if he did nothing.

690
00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:55.810
He just drank water and fucking grapefruits.

691
00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:02.020
But heroin is a influence.
Many,
many of them and musician underground,

692
00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:07.030
Lou Reed,
right.
To had a song about heroin.
Right?
Hairy.

693
00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:08.110
Scary to listen to though.

694
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:13.260
I think it was a big part of a lot of musicians experiences because it was,

695
00:41:13.351 --> 00:41:18.010
it's such a sensual type of experience.
Like the idea behind it is that it's so,

696
00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:22.720
it's so sensitive and raw.
The experience of this blissful energy that the,

697
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:25.600
the opiates provide that you know,
you,

698
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:30.640
that you can embrace like the pure sound of music and see it.

699
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:34.190
And I can see the appeal more of getting like the appeal

700
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.020
<v 1>being that like it's this great,
you know,
it's a great painkiller.</v>

701
00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:41.420
It takes you to this la La land.
Like it's there,
you can romanticize that drug.

702
00:41:41.421 --> 00:41:45.230
But like to start crystal magic measure like I want to eat rocks,
man,

703
00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:50.270
I want to chew on.
That's Kinda like what you're saying you want to do.
You know

704
00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:57.170
you have crazy energy but it's unfocused energy.
Cause I think with math,

705
00:41:57.171 --> 00:41:59.060
like you,
I don't know,
can you do stuff?

706
00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:03.100
People do stuff when the Nobel prize on Meth,

707
00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.230
I think what he said about judgment,

708
00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:13.430
I think your judgment is really involved in every single aspect of what you do.

709
00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:17.640
And when you're doing a drug that fucks or judge what happened.
What'd he say?
No,

710
00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:22.310
no,
I was just thinking like what?
I mean Hendricks could focus on heroin.
Well,

711
00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.460
I don't think it was,
I don't think it was using heroin that much.

712
00:42:25.461 --> 00:42:27.170
Like why it was just more acid.
Well,

713
00:42:27.171 --> 00:42:29.960
they said that one of the things you just do is put acid in his headband.

714
00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.620
Pores open up while I was on stage,

715
00:42:33.621 --> 00:42:37.180
it would drip into his skin and yeah,

716
00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:42.290
I don't know if that's urban limits can't function on.

717
00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:45.520
So like someone,
something someone really annoying would tell you.
Yeah,

718
00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:50.360
that's true because well,
someone threw a no hitter on acid.
That's right.

719
00:42:50.361 --> 00:42:52.720
It was that,
forget

720
00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:59.810
the partied all day.
And then my friend was like,
you got to play a gay man.

721
00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:02.723
Uh,

722
00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:07.490
Jealous Doc Ellis.
Yeah.

723
00:43:07.491 --> 00:43:11.840
You threw a no hitter while on acid.
I at the comedy store,

724
00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:18.200
that story,
they did a really good job of the animating that online.

725
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:23.330
They did a Dr. Ellis thing.
I saw that.
Yeah.
Was that for somebody?

726
00:43:23.331 --> 00:43:26.090
I think somebody he told that story,
I forget.
I don't know who he told it to,

727
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:30.110
but the,
they did a,
you know,
an animation to the story.
That's awesome.

728
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:34.010
Really good.
I could see how it could go.
Right.
Well,
I've never done acid.

729
00:43:34.011 --> 00:43:34.980
I should say that right off the bat.

730
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:39.770
I've only done the only psych of dogs I've ever done.
DMT,
mushrooms,

731
00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:43.810
ecstasy,
which isn't really a saga dog.
Right.
I've done the Ama.

732
00:43:43.811 --> 00:43:47.780
Nita was scary mushroom and the other kinds of Psilocybin,
but no,
uh,

733
00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.180
no acid and no one I've ever trusted had it.

734
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:54.620
It's always been like someone,
you know,
if it came up,

735
00:43:54.621 --> 00:43:57.410
it was someone who just had this weird glint in their eye and I was like,

736
00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:03.170
no,
it's too complicated and it's too illegal.

737
00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.030
It's really difficult to make.

738
00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.860
So if you're making it like you're out there on the fringes,
son.

739
00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:12.110
So people just got busted recently,
some school somewhere,
some kids were,

740
00:44:12.111 --> 00:44:15.620
or a producing acid and they busted them.

741
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:18.930
I wouldn't do acid again.
I've done it probably over a hundred times,

742
00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:20.110
a hundred times.

743
00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:25.790
It's probably way over 127 it didn't know it.

744
00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:29.810
It's something I don't want to do it like I can't believe I do mushrooms now,

745
00:44:29.811 --> 00:44:33.330
but now I consider,
I'd never really considered mushrooms bad and,
but uh,

746
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:34.990
mushrooms teach me shit man.

747
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:38.130
Every time I've done mushrooms I just have a new revelation,

748
00:44:38.131 --> 00:44:41.940
a new insight and things.
The problem with acid,
it's just,

749
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:46.350
it's too much of a commitment.
Like mushrooms,
you won't do another five hours.

750
00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:48.930
What's that?
You won't do mushrooms anymore?
No,
I will.
I just,

751
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:52.440
lately I've just more scared of the mushrooms that have been going around.

752
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:57.240
I think that they're not the right kind of different kind.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

753
00:44:57.241 --> 00:45:00.760
Probably just scared of the mushrooms that are going around based on what it's,

754
00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:05.880
it's just,
I don't trust,
I don't trust mushrooms as much as I trust.

755
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:08.220
Well,
it's kind of the same.
Along the same lines,

756
00:45:08.221 --> 00:45:09.180
like where are you getting this from?

757
00:45:09.181 --> 00:45:10.770
You guys from someone willing to stick their neck

758
00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.940
<v 0>gun,
sell something illegally.
Yeah.
Which is often case,</v>

759
00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:18.080
but apparently there's some sort of a loophole and truffles are not illegal.

760
00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:22.730
Like you can get like silicide but truffles,
gold,
Google that Shit folks,

761
00:45:22.731 --> 00:45:25.250
don't listen to me.
I don't want to be a purveyor of any,

762
00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:29.950
I've never heard of truffle scheduled one scheduled one for his shit.
No,

763
00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:34.820
no.
I think that that doc Ellis was taking other drugs in conjunction with,

764
00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:36.133
uh,

765
00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:40.760
cause I've taken a lot of acid and I don't know,

766
00:45:40.761 --> 00:45:43.910
like I didn't even know where I was.
Like there are times you're like,

767
00:45:43.911 --> 00:45:46.240
where am I in a convenience store?
Where am I?
And it can be,

768
00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:51.890
people even know that people react differently on it.
Right.
And some people,

769
00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:55.240
<v 1>I was just like mushrooms for the most part.
It's either,</v>

770
00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:58.600
it could be all visuals or it could be speedy.

771
00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:02.800
Sometimes you're just in for pool players.
The thing,
there's,

772
00:46:02.801 --> 00:46:07.030
there's always been two things and fet amines and if you can handle

773
00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:12.450
<v 0>heroin and the guys who would do heroin have no nerves.</v>

774
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:15.690
They had no nerves,
they wouldn't,
they wouldn't feel any nervousness.

775
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.230
So the gamble for like ridiculous amounts of money and just you never miss,

776
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:21.630
there was a dude,
his name was water dog,

777
00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:25.860
that was his nickname or buffalo bill depending on who you at night.

778
00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.900
And he would,
uh,
he would always come and they would make a day,

779
00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:30.450
they would make a game,
they'd figure it out,

780
00:46:30.451 --> 00:46:33.030
how much they're going to bet and it was always a lot of money cause he was like

781
00:46:33.031 --> 00:46:35.760
a,
a top level local player.

782
00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:39.990
And then he would go to the bathroom and he would shoot up and he would come

783
00:46:39.991 --> 00:46:44.640
back and he would sit on a stool and he would sit on this bar stool like this,

784
00:46:44.641 --> 00:46:45.474
just like this.

785
00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:53.080
I mean I'm not bullshitting his hands like a t rex and just sit there for like a

786
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.550
half an hour.
Just,
just bull lasted on heroin.

787
00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:00.300
And then he would get off and then he would screw is Q together and he wouldn't

788
00:47:00.301 --> 00:47:04.380
miss a fucking ball.
He was a monster.
They played on this table.

789
00:47:04.381 --> 00:47:08.610
There's a gambling table that they had and a regular pool tables pockets or five

790
00:47:08.611 --> 00:47:09.090
inches.

791
00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:12.960
They're like these big sloppy open pockets where you don't have to hit a ball

792
00:47:12.961 --> 00:47:17.760
absolutely perfectly.
They had these under four inches.
There was under four,

793
00:47:17.761 --> 00:47:21.300
it was like three and three quarter inches.
It was fucking ridiculous.

794
00:47:21.301 --> 00:47:25.770
Like the ball barely fit through the hole and this mother fucker was just firing

795
00:47:25.771 --> 00:47:29.040
things in.
He wouldn't miss.
He couldn't miss.
It was incredible.

796
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.760
He did it wasn't nervous about,
they were betting it.

797
00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:35.890
There were many thousands of dollars.
It was like maybe $10,000,
$10,000 each.

798
00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:36.131
It was,

799
00:47:36.131 --> 00:47:40.270
it was at a very high bet cause the guy who is doing it with was a race car or

800
00:47:40.271 --> 00:47:44.230
as a um,
a horse jockey.
One of the,
like the,

801
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:46.660
they had a different kinds of like carts,

802
00:47:46.661 --> 00:47:50.290
like horses would pull a carts with the fuck are those things?

803
00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:52.780
Yeah.
W I don't know.

804
00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:58.160
It's like a type of racing where like horses actually pulling like a cart

805
00:47:58.541 --> 00:47:59.170
behind.

806
00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:03.370
It's not just the horse running and the guy on top of it and he was just a crazy

807
00:48:03.371 --> 00:48:04.330
gambler and he would,

808
00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:08.170
he would play this fucking guy and he would get so bummed out because he knew he

809
00:48:08.171 --> 00:48:11.290
couldn't,
the guy couldn't miss cause he's on heroin,
he's on the shit.

810
00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.110
And so they said,
look,
I'm the mother Fucker,
you can't mess on the shit.

811
00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.260
I would be complaining but he wouldn't even care that he was complaining.

812
00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:18.430
So it was kind of slack,

813
00:48:18.431 --> 00:48:22.270
jaw look and just the balls would just fire into the hole.

814
00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:25.840
Would they get into the heroin because they knew it would help the nerves.

815
00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.890
Like is that where they would even get into it?
They're degenerates,
you know,

816
00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:32.290
who knows?
You know,
most of those guys,
they were looking to party at all times,

817
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:34.720
pool players.
There was some of the wildest human beings,

818
00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:39.930
people that have actually made a commitment to trying to make their entire

819
00:48:40.121 --> 00:48:45.121
living off of tricking people to gamble with them but don't play as good as

820
00:48:45.251 --> 00:48:48.010
them.
And then,
and then betting all your money on that.

821
00:48:48.011 --> 00:48:51.820
And like those people are nuts in poker there.
They're nuts.

822
00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:55.180
There's a good percentage of them that are nuts.
I mean a lot of them aren't.

823
00:48:55.181 --> 00:48:58.420
A lot of them are like really cool and smart people that are just in love with

824
00:48:58.421 --> 00:49:00.790
pool and that's all they want to do.
The tournament guys,

825
00:49:00.791 --> 00:49:02.830
you know the guys that travel from tournament to tournament,

826
00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:06.730
you know even the best ones of them are the gamblers,
the best tournament guys.

827
00:49:06.731 --> 00:49:09.130
The guys like this kid named Shane van Boning,
who's,

828
00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:12.280
who's deaf and when he plays he shuts his hearing aid off

829
00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:16.990
and he goes into his own little world and he doesn't give a fuck.

830
00:49:16.991 --> 00:49:21.210
He doesn't hear Shit.
He just,
he just plays.
That's so cool.
Yeah,

831
00:49:21.211 --> 00:49:23.670
it does everything on feel.
No hearing.
You know,

832
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:26.800
it's kind of fascinating to the point where people have actually accused him of

833
00:49:26.801 --> 00:49:29.560
having an advantage and one guy was playing him,

834
00:49:29.561 --> 00:49:33.190
this guy Earl Strickland actually stuffed his ears with cotton and then put big

835
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:37.420
like,
like,
yeah,
aviator headsets on.

836
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:38.883
Like someone who would

837
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:44.650
work at the the fucking towers and flight guys.
That's what he would wear.

838
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:49.900
Yeah.
And he would play pool with that on it's hilarious fucking character.

839
00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:54.970
Yeah.
I can't hear either.
Athol Skytap shoots headphones on,
man.

840
00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:59.710
Ridiculous with stuffing in his ears.
He's crazy.
He's,
but he's brilliant,

841
00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:03.220
brilliant and crazy at the same time.
These pool players,
it's a,

842
00:50:03.221 --> 00:50:07.720
that's a nutty life.
So you know,
when you asked who,

843
00:50:07.721 --> 00:50:10.780
what came first,
the heroin or the pool,
it was all together.

844
00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.500
They're all hanging out at these 24 hour pool places.

845
00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:18.460
They were the most fun I had ever had as a kid growing up.

846
00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:20.710
What city was this in that you were in?
White Plains,

847
00:50:20.711 --> 00:50:25.600
New York executive billiards.
24 hours a day.
We have the keys.
My friend owned it.

848
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:28.970
My friend guy was the owner of the place,
so we were always there.

849
00:50:28.971 --> 00:50:31.260
So guy would like keep it open and we would,
you know,

850
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:33.590
we would lock the door and we would all play by ourselves.

851
00:50:33.591 --> 00:50:36.560
We had people in their gambling and playing by themselves late at night.

852
00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:38.990
It was just such a clubhouse.
And I had,

853
00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:42.410
I don't want to say [inaudible] girlfriend,
but she was,

854
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:47.030
she was a little on the negative side and we,
we'd had problems because of that.

855
00:50:47.031 --> 00:50:50.870
I just,
I,
I,
you know,
and she didn't mean to be,
she's not a bad person at all.

856
00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.970
It's just sort of the way she grew up,
you know,

857
00:50:52.971 --> 00:50:57.740
she had a hard life and when we were,
uh,
interacting,

858
00:50:57.770 --> 00:51:02.060
if,
if she would like bum me out or if like I just couldn't wait to get the fuck

859
00:51:02.061 --> 00:51:03.980
away from her and get back to that pool hall.

860
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:05.960
Why new shit crazy shit was going on.

861
00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:10.170
I knew there was two dudes who had their gambling on roaches,

862
00:51:10.171 --> 00:51:14.050
see which Roche could get to the corner first,
you know,
and it was like yelling,

863
00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:17.990
man,
Yo,
you can't coach the Roach Bro.
You can't coach.
It was like everything was,

864
00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:19.670
it was,
everything was always fun.

865
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:23.510
It was a bunch of men and there was very little violence and all the years that

866
00:51:23.511 --> 00:51:27.440
I was there I saw like a couple,
like little minor little altercations,

867
00:51:27.441 --> 00:51:30.590
nothing serious at all,
but it was always fun.

868
00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:33.890
It always go there and it was a bunch of men who really didn't want to grow up.

869
00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:36.470
You know,
and my friend Max,
I believe who was a professional,

870
00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.110
he said that there was at one point in time in this country,

871
00:51:39.111 --> 00:51:42.950
there was a bachelor class of men that never wanted to get married.

872
00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:46.400
They just didn't want to do it.
And a lot of those guys would go to pool halls.

873
00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:50.330
And that's one of the reasons why pool halls got such a bad reputation is that

874
00:51:50.331 --> 00:51:53.390
you know everybody else in his mind,
and you know,
Max is really nice guy.

875
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:56.210
He's very easy going guy.
But in his mind he's like,
why?

876
00:51:56.270 --> 00:52:01.270
Why is there this desire to get people to enforce or to live some other form of

877
00:52:02.721 --> 00:52:06.230
life that he doesn't want to live if he doesn't want to get married is when I

878
00:52:06.231 --> 00:52:08.750
have to have children.
Why can't you just let them hang out at the pool hall?

879
00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:12.500
But they were,
you know,
always be considered degenerates because of that.

880
00:52:12.501 --> 00:52:13.670
Because of that desire.

881
00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:16.580
You would always be assumed that if you wanted to be someplace where you're

882
00:52:16.581 --> 00:52:18.050
playing pool at four o'clock in the morning,

883
00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:21.080
terrible things were afoot right now.

884
00:52:21.081 --> 00:52:23.520
Usually they were right doing bad thing,

885
00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:27.680
but the reason is because the people that are willing to be up at four o'clock

886
00:52:27.681 --> 00:52:29.390
in the morning,
hanging out all night at this pool hall,

887
00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:33.350
or the same people who are not going to listen to whatever anybody tells him to

888
00:52:33.351 --> 00:52:35.420
and they're gonna want to try to do whatever they want to do,

889
00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:40.210
whatever they want to do is just gamble all day.
They should,
I mean,
what do you,

890
00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:43.670
why stop them?
You know,
lungs in are robbing anybody.

891
00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:45.770
As long as we're not doing anything illegal.

892
00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:49.970
There was a shockingly small amount of criminals and all the time that I hung

893
00:52:49.971 --> 00:52:52.820
out at these pool halls,
you would think there's like way more criminals,

894
00:52:52.821 --> 00:52:57.470
way more crime.
Very little because of the late in the boozing and the drugs.

895
00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:01.490
No,
it wasn't even that.
It's like there wasn't really that many bad guys there.

896
00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:04.310
It was like these guys all wanted to do what they wanted to do.
Exactly.

897
00:53:04.311 --> 00:53:07.670
It was all like,
I remember there's this one dude,
it was really fascinating.

898
00:53:07.671 --> 00:53:12.610
He learned how to play chess in his head and prison and um,

899
00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:13.640
he could like,

900
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:17.480
you could sit down with a chessboard and he could either tell you the moves and

901
00:53:17.481 --> 00:53:19.220
you would watch your move and he would tell,
you know,

902
00:53:19.221 --> 00:53:21.200
he would never move a piece.
We just tell you what the moves are.

903
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:25.560
Or he could do it all in his head.
Like you have a board in your head.

904
00:53:25.561 --> 00:53:28.530
I have a chess board in my hand and I say pawn to the step.

905
00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:32.730
And then you have to keep account of where all your pieces are while you're

906
00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:34.620
doing this and you have to eat it by the way.

907
00:53:34.621 --> 00:53:39.060
And you have to agree with the other person has to agree upon is at this spot,

908
00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:40.890
right.
You know,
you,
you have to like,

909
00:53:40.891 --> 00:53:44.990
you can't without actually without no chess board,
no chest.
Yes.

910
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:47.400
These guys are brilliant.
So this isn't a dumb guy.

911
00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:51.750
This was the guy that just didn't want to do certain things in life.

912
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:56.520
He was gambling once and it was late at night.
It was like after midnight.
And uh,

913
00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:59.910
he goes,
uh,
he,
he looked at his watch,
then they,
you know,

914
00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:01.980
they're going to play another set and he goes,
you want to play another set?

915
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:06.540
He goes,
I've been thinking about getting a fucking divorce lately.

916
00:54:06.541 --> 00:54:10.840
So yes,
yes,
I do.
And he wound up getting a divorce.

917
00:54:10.841 --> 00:54:15.090
So he decided right there that he doesn't want anybody to tell him to come home

918
00:54:15.091 --> 00:54:18.390
after midnight,
you know,
and he's like,
shut the fuck up.
I want to play pool.

919
00:54:18.391 --> 00:54:21.780
I'm playing pool.
You know,
he was a brilliant dude.
He,

920
00:54:21.781 --> 00:54:24.930
there was a kid who was a local kid who was a,
an actual chess champion,

921
00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:28.410
really young kid.
And he would,
it was learning,
just learning how to play pool.

922
00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:31.950
But at chess he was like a super wizard and him and his guy would sit in a

923
00:54:31.951 --> 00:54:34.860
corner and they would,
uh,
exchange back and forth.
They would,
uh,

924
00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:38.840
they would go over their moves together.
Amazing.
Amazing Watch.

925
00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:40.440
That'd be funny.

926
00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:43.080
They have like little picnic blank and they're both sitting there with like a

927
00:54:43.081 --> 00:54:46.050
little picnic basket,
just like laying on their side,
looking at each other,

928
00:54:46.051 --> 00:54:51.010
doing mine chats with the tender.
The wind slowly blows there,
I'm sure hair.

929
00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:54.720
I'm sure there's couples that do that and they think it's sexy.
Yeah,

930
00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:58.670
I think it's excellent.
He,
he learned that in prison.
Yup.
Wow.
Yeah.

931
00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:01.870
I knew a lot of prisoners are a lot of felons rather that,

932
00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:05.130
that I knew a lot of pain.
There was very little crime there I saw.

933
00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:09.810
But I knew a lot of people who had done a lot in the past.
One Dude,

934
00:55:09.811 --> 00:55:14.550
his name was international sal and international sal rest his heart rest.

935
00:55:14.551 --> 00:55:19.230
His soul rather,
uh,
died a few years ago.
And He,
um,
when he was younger,

936
00:55:19.231 --> 00:55:22.430
when he used to do is he was one of the first guys he was,
he was a,

937
00:55:22.450 --> 00:55:26.400
he was a gem of a human.
It was a gem of a human.
And for the,
the,

938
00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.680
the first days of American Express cards,

939
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:33.950
he figured out how to copy and the American Express card from the papers that

940
00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:36.630
would,
uh,
you know,
they would be left behind.

941
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:38.670
We need to make our evangelists carbon slip.

942
00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:43.820
So they would make an a complete copy of your card and then use it and buy

943
00:55:43.861 --> 00:55:47.130
things and run up and shit like that.

944
00:55:47.131 --> 00:55:50.670
And he was notorious gambling loser.

945
00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:53.610
He just could not win.
He could not win.

946
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:56.670
And he would wait at the pool hall and they would come by and they would bring

947
00:55:56.671 --> 00:56:01.620
him thousands of dollars and he would go and blow it all playing pool.

948
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:04.140
Like the guy who was,
I was talking about earlier about the heroin guy.
That's,

949
00:56:04.141 --> 00:56:06.960
this guy's is George the Greek.
And George,
the Greek would always talk,

950
00:56:06.961 --> 00:56:08.160
that fucking guy can't win.

951
00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:11.940
That guy can't fucking when I'm telling Ya I don't give a fuck of it's an inch

952
00:56:11.941 --> 00:56:16.440
from the hole.
You bet on the other cock sucker,
you bet on.
And he would,
uh,

953
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:17.930
he would always,
you know,

954
00:56:17.931 --> 00:56:22.680
just sit there and analyze this international sal character.
And he goes,

955
00:56:22.681 --> 00:56:26.140
well let me you some of this motherfucker,
he lost a million a month,

956
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:29.750
lost a million a month.
Whether that's true.
Yeah.

957
00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:32.440
Who the fuck knows who the fuck knows how much he really lost?

958
00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:36.310
But apparently he lost an incredible amount of money playing Paul.
Yeah.

959
00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:39.160
And the people like,
you know,
just just robbed him.

960
00:56:39.161 --> 00:56:40.210
They would just rob him constantly.

961
00:56:40.211 --> 00:56:42.610
So then he went to jail and then he came back out and went legit.

962
00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:44.890
And when I met him he was legit.
So when I met him,

963
00:56:44.891 --> 00:56:48.880
it was all just the stories of international style.
But it was fascinating.

964
00:56:48.881 --> 00:56:53.881
He would sit down and tell you what it was like Internet for the fucking

965
00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:58.510
degenerate name mean.
It's for like a gambler or like a mobster.

966
00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:00.940
I'm cold.
Stope Brian.

967
00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:04.480
I got to speak to him like a couple of years before he died.

968
00:57:04.481 --> 00:57:05.530
I called up the pool hall,

969
00:57:05.531 --> 00:57:09.580
wants to say hi to everybody and he was still alive and I said hi to him.

970
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.950
I used to like the guys like hanging out and talk to them.

971
00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.390
Tell me old criminal stories.

972
00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:17.770
Cause when I met him he was already probably like sixties he was probably

973
00:57:17.771 --> 00:57:22.420
already,
yeah,
I met a lot of crazy motherfuckers.
Enough place.

974
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:25.690
Whenever you're in certain sort of an alternate environment like that where you

975
00:57:25.691 --> 00:57:28.870
know any clubs.
Yeah,
comedy clubs.
Exactly.
Perfect.

976
00:57:28.871 --> 00:57:33.790
Exactly parallel between people like that and kind of for sure and boxing gyms

977
00:57:33.791 --> 00:57:37.750
to boxing gyms to anything where you're doing something that's like a completely

978
00:57:37.751 --> 00:57:39.040
outside of the norm.

979
00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:41.950
Some of the funniest people I've ever met in my life had been fighters,

980
00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:46.360
guys and fight gyms because there's so ridiculous,
you know,

981
00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:50.410
first of all a lot of them were fuck like Tate Tate used to say some funny shit

982
00:57:50.411 --> 00:57:54.550
man.
He was always saying some pretty funny shit cause he's a God damn savage.

983
00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:56.700
Yeah.
It was a former mixed martial arts fighter.

984
00:57:56.710 --> 00:58:00.880
Big fucking giant Caveman Viking dude.
Stinky,
stinky.

985
00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:06.670
It's a brutal,
yeah.
Protein bars and shit.
No,

986
00:58:06.671 --> 00:58:08.440
he's a big dude.
You gotta gotta eat a lot.

987
00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:12.880
The digestive tract can only handle so much protein.
Blows it out the phone,

988
00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:15.130
just toxic gas.
But you know,

989
00:58:15.131 --> 00:58:19.480
fighters have like a certain sense of humor that's like much like comics do.

990
00:58:19.481 --> 00:58:21.340
Like where it's like that dark,

991
00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:24.820
they're willing to go where other people aren't willing to go.
Sense of humor,

992
00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:25.121
you know,

993
00:58:25.121 --> 00:58:27.930
pointing out something that everybody might be thinking but not everybody's

994
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:31.750
saying and don't really think before they say it kind of.
She's very impulsive.

995
00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:35.470
Yeah.
Well you have to almost be to try to do that in the first place.

996
00:58:35.471 --> 00:58:38.580
Cause it's such a crazy thing to decide to do with your body.
You know,

997
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:43.360
the physical torture,
you know,
to put yourself out there to get beaten.

998
00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.360
There's a little bit of that too.
But this,
you know,
the,

999
00:58:46.361 --> 00:58:49.780
just the impulsiveness of,
you know,
just getting involved in it.

1000
00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:54.900
Some for some people it's actually a slow thing and they slowly get into it and

1001
00:58:55.061 --> 00:58:57.480
get into martial arts and eventually want to be a fighter.
But some,

1002
00:58:57.481 --> 00:58:59.800
some people just fucking right away when a fight,

1003
00:58:59.801 --> 00:59:01.630
there's just a wild impulsiveness to them.

1004
00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:05.410
I've seen cage fights where guys had like literally a week's training.

1005
00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:07.990
They had never done anything and they were fighting and they were,

1006
00:59:07.991 --> 00:59:11.380
they had a week's trading and they just fucking go wild on each other and shit

1007
00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:14.640
and swaying and craziness.
And no one really knew how to fight annuities.

1008
00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:19.090
It's essentially a street fight with a few rules that show we saw was it taboo,

1009
00:59:19.091 --> 00:59:22.130
whether it's a place in Australia where a guy has a circus

1010
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:27.000
<v 5>tent and he has like fighters,
fighters.
Yeah.
Yes you did.</v>

1011
00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:30.040
Oh,
okay,
please keep going.
And so,

1012
00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:34.010
so you go going to the circus tents in Australia and the drunks and people off

1013
00:59:34.011 --> 00:59:37.790
the street come in and he says you with one a with a fighter,
you know,

1014
00:59:37.791 --> 00:59:41.480
and you can use it like a professional fighter.
Yeah.
That's so deep.
And it's,

1015
00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:45.230
but at the same time kind of awesome and serves a function like if you're just

1016
00:59:45.231 --> 00:59:48.510
some angry drunk 18 year old boy who wants a fight,
okay,

1017
00:59:48.550 --> 00:59:52.210
<v 2>well go over there instead of beating.
I don't have like,
it's not like a,
uh,</v>

1018
00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:55.720
a Cain Velasquez steps in there.
Like this dude might kill you.
Right.

1019
00:59:55.930 --> 00:59:59.970
It's like they're the people that have their boxing,
right.

1020
01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.580
The boxers that are what they are is they're,
they're not,

1021
01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:07.560
they're not championship level boxers,
but it's all,
there's active friends.
Yeah.

1022
01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.540
And it's,
it's just backing.

1023
01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:13.180
You throw on gloves and if you throw somebody that knows how to box,
just,

1024
01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:15.190
you know,
it has a few years of boxing,

1025
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:18.670
knows how to move and jab and actually box versus a guy who's like,

1026
01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:21.820
I'm fucking crazy.
And you're just like,
here's gloves and go at it.

1027
01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:26.620
That dude with the boxing skills is just going to pick up on a clinic and that's

1028
01:00:26.621 --> 01:00:29.710
what they do.
And everyone's drinking.
It's like a fun,
right?
They don't like,

1029
01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.110
but what if,
what if some guys are ringer?
What was it?

1030
01:00:32.111 --> 01:00:36.160
Some Kimbo slice type character.
Yeah.
Man.
Fucking knocked out to this by the way.

1031
01:00:36.161 --> 01:00:38.550
Somebody,
anybody can get in,
right?
Yeah.

1032
01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:40.830
If you go to somebody who was at the leading either,

1033
01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:44.920
like we used to have those here.
That's,
this is 2012 man.
I'm like,
dude,

1034
01:00:44.921 --> 01:00:47.930
we just saw this.
It's not like some shit.

1035
01:00:47.931 --> 01:00:52.430
I'm talking about the 60s on right now.
Fucking love Australia Dude.
It's awesome.

1036
01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:55.320
Love it.
And we met Tommy and I had a great time there.
That's great.

1037
01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:00.190
Nice soup on so much.
We talked about it.
Uh,
what was that?

1038
01:01:00.191 --> 01:01:01.720
The Ice House chronical.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1039
01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:05.110
Tommy and I went and then we were there with Eddie Bravo and we went to see that

1040
01:01:05.111 --> 01:01:08.830
stupid Leonardo Dicaprio movie Shiela,
who was crazy.

1041
01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:12.120
It's a lot of people liked.
And I say I liked it.
That fucking love.

1042
01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:16.660
That movie sucks.
Shutter island?
No shutter island.

1043
01:01:16.690 --> 01:01:20.620
I love sugar.
I thought there was pretty good.

1044
01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:25.150
You hold on [inaudible] island for the,
for the twist and you're like,
oh.

1045
01:01:25.151 --> 01:01:29.620
So he is crazy.
Like the thing that we kept considering the whole time,
right?

1046
01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.730
Like he's great.
Maybe he's not crazy,
right.
May is crazy.
And then they go,
yeah,

1047
01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:38.440
he was great.
It didn't make sense to me that you're showing me this,
you know,

1048
01:01:38.441 --> 01:01:43.420
you're showing me from his perspective first and then from an outside one more

1049
01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:46.480
movie.
Yeah,
well there's a better version of it I guess.

1050
01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:49.090
Meanwhile I'm like cabin in the woods.
Awesome.

1051
01:01:51.810 --> 01:01:55.990
Yeah.
So we got,
we were,
but it was,
it was,
we didn't like it.
Me and Eddie and Tom,

1052
01:01:55.991 --> 01:01:58.320
we were all in agreement.
This is like,
it was,
it was a field.

1053
01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:03.130
It felt like we got tricked a trek.
Absolutely.
So we decided to get hammered.

1054
01:02:03.370 --> 01:02:07.720
So we went to some local bar and just went crazy.
Yeah,
we went fucking crazy.

1055
01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:10.230
We had just landed.
So our body clocks.
Yeah,

1056
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:14.830
we were a day off and we just started buying drinks for everybody.

1057
01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:17.260
There was like hundreds of people.
I don't know how much,

1058
01:02:17.290 --> 01:02:20.010
I literally spent thousands of dollars.
I don't know

1059
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:24.330
<v 0>how many people,
but it was,
I wanted,
I wanted like,</v>

1060
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:27.640
I don't know what I mean,
we just had a couple of shots in the idea.

1061
01:02:27.641 --> 01:02:30.320
It came across to just fucking,
I could buy drinks for everybody.

1062
01:02:30.350 --> 01:02:32.490
They just buy a bunch of fucking people drink.

1063
01:02:32.491 --> 01:02:34.860
So I just started pointing to people.
Do you want to drink man?
Dude?

1064
01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:38.300
Gimme a high five.
What do you want to be that the comedy store every weekend?

1065
01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:39.490
Back in the day almost.
Well,

1066
01:02:39.491 --> 01:02:42.480
I would buy the whole crowd a drink if I kicked somebody out.

1067
01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:45.770
That was my move I had to do almost every day.
Yeah.
Well,
because it was always,

1068
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:50.670
there was always at least once a month,
you would get like a crazy heckler,

1069
01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:53.400
like someone who you just couldn't deal with.
You'd be like,
come on man,

1070
01:02:53.401 --> 01:02:55.800
you can't keep talking on this show is going on.
This shit is,

1071
01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:57.810
it's annoying to all the other people around you.

1072
01:02:57.810 --> 01:03:00.900
And they all started cheering and they go,
look bro,
I want you to enjoy the show.

1073
01:03:00.901 --> 01:03:04.050
I want you to enjoy show.
We got to stop yelling shit out.
Okay.

1074
01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:07.260
And then they'd yell shit out again.
All right,
fuck this.
You gotta go.

1075
01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:10.080
And then when it got to that point,
I'm like,
I'm sorry dude,
but you got to go.

1076
01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.530
And then when the people would leave,
I would say,
look,

1077
01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:15.600
and that felt creepy light,
right?
It felt like,
like daddy came home,

1078
01:03:15.601 --> 01:03:20.040
yelled at mom,
I go,
I don't want,
I don't want anything uncomfortable.

1079
01:03:20.041 --> 01:03:23.970
So my,
my custom is when I kick someone out,

1080
01:03:23.971 --> 01:03:26.600
I buy everyone else to drink.
And so everybody goes,
Yay.
I go,

1081
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:29.310
I want us to have fun.
I didn't,
I don't want to have to deal with that,

1082
01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:33.060
but I have,
it's my job.
Unfortunately,
when there's someone like that,

1083
01:03:33.061 --> 01:03:36.450
you have to deal with them because it's interrupting the show for the other

1084
01:03:36.451 --> 01:03:37.140
people.

1085
01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:39.990
It's fucking with the performance and there's nothing you can do about it other

1086
01:03:39.991 --> 01:03:41.420
than address it.
You have to address it.

1087
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:44.100
Some people don't consider that aspect of it the most too,

1088
01:03:44.101 --> 01:03:48.630
is that a lot of times people think that that person's just bothering you and

1089
01:03:48.631 --> 01:03:51.870
they're not even considering the fact that maybe in that section where that

1090
01:03:51.871 --> 01:03:56.100
asshole keeps yelling shit out,
there are 25 people around him who are like,

1091
01:03:56.130 --> 01:03:59.460
I wish somebody would get rid of this motherfucker cause he's ruining my

1092
01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:02.070
experience.
And there was a couple of those in Florida,

1093
01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:06.000
there was a several kick outs in Florida.
One of them was a cop.

1094
01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:10.080
Turns out the check was outside and they,
they,
they put her hands on,

1095
01:04:10.081 --> 01:04:13.320
I should pull a badge out on the guy.
Wow.
Yeah.
Actually get your hands off me.

1096
01:04:13.321 --> 01:04:16.950
And this batch was,
she got kicked out for being hammered and she was a cop,

1097
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.920
but there was,
um,
there was several people that got kicked out.

1098
01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:21.780
One of is a table that wouldn't shut the fuck up.

1099
01:04:21.781 --> 01:04:26.520
So the neighbor table slammed his hand on the table and said,
shut the fuck up.

1100
01:04:26.521 --> 01:04:31.050
And then the guy got up and he was enormous,
huge mistake.
I mean,

1101
01:04:31.051 --> 01:04:33.480
the guy didn't do anything,
but holy Shit,
what I'm talking about,

1102
01:04:33.481 --> 01:04:36.360
this is like a literally a football player,
like a 300 pound football player.

1103
01:04:36.361 --> 01:04:40.500
I was like,
Holy Fuck,
that guy's big.
And he's pointing down at them and I'm like,

1104
01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:45.330
oh,
please,
Lord.
No,
not a fucking bench clearing brawl.
So I asked him,
I said,
sir,

1105
01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:48.780
what's going on,
sir?
Can you tell me what's going on?
Sorry.
And I hear a lot of,

1106
01:04:48.781 --> 01:04:52.620
fuck you,
you fucking touch where to buy it.
So,
and I'm like,
sir,
what happened?

1107
01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:56.610
Were you enjoying the show before all this when it happened?
And this lady goes,

1108
01:04:56.611 --> 01:04:59.310
before these fucking assholes had a slap down on our table.

1109
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.560
So they take her husband out and I go,
ma'am,
I go,

1110
01:05:01.561 --> 01:05:03.060
we're going to need you to calm down or you're gonna stay,

1111
01:05:03.061 --> 01:05:04.350
you're going to stay and they're going to arrest him.

1112
01:05:04.351 --> 01:05:06.070
Is that what's going to go on?
Like what's going on?

1113
01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:09.660
Other other just going to kick him out and they just kicked him out and then she

1114
01:05:09.661 --> 01:05:11.670
said,
you know,
you know they were fucking slap but I'm in it.

1115
01:05:11.790 --> 01:05:12.990
And then the table goes,

1116
01:05:12.991 --> 01:05:15.570
yeah we slept at your table cause you wouldn't shut the fuck up.

1117
01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:18.970
And everybody went,
yeah,
that's the whole place.
So cheering,

1118
01:05:18.971 --> 01:05:23.860
you know for this guy.
Wow.
Like those,
I don't know.
And I asked her,
I go,

1119
01:05:23.861 --> 01:05:27.400
have you ever done mushrooms?
And then I go,
you probably haven't done mushrooms.

1120
01:05:27.401 --> 01:05:29.650
Right?
I go,
cause if you did,
you feel terrible about this,

1121
01:05:29.651 --> 01:05:34.090
you'd realize like you're just being real negative.
Selfish.
This is just creepy.

1122
01:05:34.091 --> 01:05:36.430
You want to talk and you're mad.
I go,

1123
01:05:36.431 --> 01:05:40.900
you should feel horrible that you were so talkative that people had a slap their

1124
01:05:40.901 --> 01:05:44.440
hand on your table because you're interrupting.
They're fun.
Yeah,
they're eating.

1125
01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:46.150
They're good time.
With your squawking.

1126
01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.060
And then she gave me the finger and I said,
well,

1127
01:05:49.061 --> 01:05:53.900
that's really bad Karma right there.
I go,
what you're doing right Karma.
I'm like,

1128
01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:57.310
you're spreading the wrong kind of energy and that's the wrong signal.

1129
01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:02.440
It's not nice.
Yeah.
It was just one of those things where you just,
you're,
you're,

1130
01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:05.280
you're gonna run into a certain percentage of those people are going to happen.

1131
01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:09.280
Yeah.
Part of the,
it's fun though.
It's part of what everybody got out of it.

1132
01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:12.100
No one had got hurt.
People got drunk,
people got kicked out.

1133
01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:13.390
But at the end of the day though,

1134
01:06:13.391 --> 01:06:17.200
the rest of the audience had a great fucking time that that was one of the

1135
01:06:17.201 --> 01:06:20.470
nuttiest shows ever.
The one where the lady and the Gaga kicked out.
Yeah.

1136
01:06:20.471 --> 01:06:23.200
I've seen some wild ones.
I saw,

1137
01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:28.140
<v 3>uh,
a guy in the audience one time punch another guy.
Yeah.</v>

1138
01:06:28.170 --> 01:06:32.360
I've seen a brawl brawl or to your show.
Like in the shower.

1139
01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:37.320
Yeah,
I've seen,
I've seen it a couple times.
As soon guys get get in fights,

1140
01:06:37.790 --> 01:06:40.410
it's almost always someone talking.
I saw a guy who almost died the punch,

1141
01:06:40.411 --> 01:06:44.720
the guy punched him because they told him to shut up.
Oh yeah.
Always.
Yeah.

1142
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:47.850
Always shut the fuck up man.
Where you stop talking out loud.

1143
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:51.810
I love the punk rockness of standup.
Like it's the only,

1144
01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:55.680
it's the only farm entertainment where the audience is allowed to take,

1145
01:06:55.770 --> 01:06:56.161
first of all,

1146
01:06:56.161 --> 01:07:00.450
like eat Nachos and drink and shit and then like yell at you like what other,

1147
01:07:00.451 --> 01:07:04.290
like in the theater,
like if we were proper performers,
that could never happen.

1148
01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:07.820
Like if we weren't just stage actors and shit like to place,

1149
01:07:08.310 --> 01:07:13.020
you can't yell at people.
No,
I know.
Gets so bananas.
It's not accepted.

1150
01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.780
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's not hate this play man.
Yeah.

1151
01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:24.120
<v 0>Did you see the youtube video of the guy who's doing this performance art piece</v>

1152
01:07:24.121 --> 01:07:28.530
in New York and there was a big Christian contingent in the audience?
No.
CNS,

1153
01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:34.200
I forget the dude's name.
I should probably youtube it or something like that.
Um,

1154
01:07:34.770 --> 01:07:36.710
Christians walk out on,
I don't know what a,

1155
01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.930
I don't even know how I would youtube it.
I don't even know what the fuck.

1156
01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:42.680
How would it find it?
Yeah,
if you could find it.
Brian,
this,
uh,

1157
01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:46.230
Christians walk out on live performance,

1158
01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:49.790
so they poured water on his notes.
He was doing a bit and uh,

1159
01:07:49.791 --> 01:07:51.810
in the bit he was like,
there's,

1160
01:07:52.290 --> 01:07:57.290
it's something to do with if you were having sex with Paris Hilton,

1161
01:07:58.470 --> 01:08:01.320
like in the moment you'd be saying you'd be fucking,
I go,
wow,

1162
01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:03.150
I can't believe I'm fucking Paris Hilton.

1163
01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:06.240
And then Paris Hilton would be thinking,

1164
01:08:06.270 --> 01:08:09.600
I can't believe I'm fucking Paris Hilton at the same time.
It was really,

1165
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:14.220
it was kind of fun.
Right?
And this guy gets up and then they all get up.

1166
01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:16.970
There's like 80 people were there from Christian group and they start pouring

1167
01:08:16.971 --> 01:08:20.900
water on his nose.
They look,
and these were his original notes and this is,

1168
01:08:20.901 --> 01:08:23.660
he doesn't have anything typed out.
He has it all.

1169
01:08:23.661 --> 01:08:27.800
His whole show written down on these notes and Skype poured water on it and it,

1170
01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:28.281
you know,

1171
01:08:28.281 --> 01:08:31.880
it's like they were pissed and storming out of there because they thought that

1172
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.200
somehow none of this was,
uh,
how is this effect?
I don't know.

1173
01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:38.800
They tried to grab as big Paris Hilton fans?
No,

1174
01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:41.120
I just think that it was the idea of them.

1175
01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:43.010
Someone talking about fucking in front of them.

1176
01:08:43.190 --> 01:08:45.950
They're a bunch of creepy Weirdos.
It's really basically what it is.

1177
01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:50.720
The whole idea of these Christian groups and you know,

1178
01:08:50.721 --> 01:08:53.750
you're going to go up and pour water on someone's notes and you're going to be

1179
01:08:53.751 --> 01:08:57.500
upset at them for their words.
You stupid.
Fuck.
That's Antichristian you dummy.

1180
01:08:57.630 --> 01:09:02.060
That's absolutely the antithesis of what you're supposed to be doing.

1181
01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.560
I heard people,
yeah,
people,
yeah.

1182
01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:06.140
People get upset about stuff when they yell at you.

1183
01:09:06.141 --> 01:09:09.640
I love when they're just so upset about a certain topic or joking.

1184
01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:12.080
Like I remember with you one time,
I dunno,

1185
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:16.790
it's just on your last special with the baby.
Uh,

1186
01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:18.410
which one?
The baby,

1187
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:24.390
which bit was that?
The kids getting below the,
like if there's,

1188
01:09:24.391 --> 01:09:27.290
if I walked in on a little,
uh,
no,
I,
you know,
I never,

1189
01:09:27.291 --> 01:09:30.170
that's never been on any specialty on this one.
I don't know.

1190
01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:33.590
I haven't been doing it or when people think that bit might might've passed,

1191
01:09:33.591 --> 01:09:37.030
it's time.
I mean that,
I mean sometimes I have bits of just pass their time,

1192
01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:40.670
but people will get upset.
You know,
they get out of there like a,
how dare you?

1193
01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:43.220
That's enough.
That's a five year old boy or whatever.
You know what?

1194
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:45.480
I'm going to do it that way,
man.
I'm gonna use that bit as like a,

1195
01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:49.690
a fucking a bonus extra.
I always liked it.

1196
01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:55.300
You know what it did?
I didn't,
uh,
I didn't do it well in Ohio to the special,

1197
01:09:55.301 --> 01:09:59.960
it just like something was off and I decided to like go out.
Yeah,
yeah,

1198
01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:03.950
yeah.
People get it when I like write about a topic,
right.

1199
01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:08.990
To say like I talk about some guy that's fucking a dolphin.

1200
01:10:08.991 --> 01:10:11.690
He was on the Howard stern show and he was having sex with this dolphin

1201
01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.990
regularly.
I know.
I didn't fucking make it up.

1202
01:10:14.991 --> 01:10:19.680
I'm just reporting it and people are like,
oh no.
Oh No.
It's like,
really,

1203
01:10:19.730 --> 01:10:22.710
you don't think in the world that this exists is a grownup top.

1204
01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:26.030
They know it's just right now they don't you,

1205
01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:29.780
you haven't really quite gotten your full stride as far as like people

1206
01:10:29.781 --> 01:10:33.140
recognizing how funny you are and having like your own crowd.

1207
01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:36.470
I'm sure your podcast has changed a lot of it,
right?
It's helped.

1208
01:10:36.471 --> 01:10:38.330
It's definitely helped.
And by the way,
folks,

1209
01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:42.680
the podcast is called your mom's house.
Why?
Why,

1210
01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:44.330
why is it called your mom's house?
Oh,

1211
01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.080
we're obsessed with that whole phenomenon of calling each other.
Mom was like,

1212
01:10:48.081 --> 01:10:51.450
what's the worst thing you could call your spouse is like mommy.
Right.

1213
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:55.250
And we started doing it like an o seven or eight and it just stuck.
And

1214
01:10:57.770 --> 01:11:00.020
I'm going out to the store.
I'll be back.
Mommy.

1215
01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:03.110
Just stupid to say like Philly.

1216
01:11:03.710 --> 01:11:07.190
And then I always thought that your mom jokes were dumb.

1217
01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:11.870
So I thought it fucking six juvenile juvenile,
the whole show's juvenile.

1218
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:14.730
So just to say your mom's house,
it's like,
where are you going?

1219
01:11:14.731 --> 01:11:17.190
I'm going to your mom's house.
You still need to say it's dumb.

1220
01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:21.420
But that's what amuses me is that it's silly.
Well,
you guys are both very silly.

1221
01:11:21.421 --> 01:11:25.060
You're my favorite married couple that are comedians because you're the only one

1222
01:11:25.061 --> 01:11:29.910
that are still together.
Everybody else.
I know they dropped like flies.

1223
01:11:29.970 --> 01:11:34.770
Yeah.
Oh my gosh.
Yeah they can.
Any others?
Well you know,

1224
01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.030
I'm trying to think.
Well there's,

1225
01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:40.330
in our business you guys want some more of this or not baby powder.
Yeah.

1226
01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:42.780
There's a,
in our business there's,

1227
01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:46.440
you know there's a lot of us are fucked in the head,
right?
Yeah,
for sure.

1228
01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:48.300
I mean this job is,

1229
01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:52.680
it's almost a given that there's going to be a certain amount of,

1230
01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:56.010
you're fucked in the head.
Yeah.
If you want to become a comedian for sure.

1231
01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:59.250
And so then to find someone who's got the right kind of fucked in your head that

1232
01:11:59.251 --> 01:12:03.360
the ashes with your kind of fucked up.
It's all about,
yeah,
that's what it is.

1233
01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:07.060
Right.
That's a completely is the best way to break it down.
Yeah.

1234
01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:10.830
But it's all like fucked in the head.
People think is bad,
but it's not bad.

1235
01:12:10.890 --> 01:12:13.620
My eye,
if it wasn't for all of my fucked in the heads,

1236
01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:15.860
I wouldn't have never gotten anywhere.
That's right.

1237
01:12:15.861 --> 01:12:20.861
Cause most of my impulses are to do things that were fucking completely risky,

1238
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:26.040
really fucking terrible future success ratio.
You know,
really no chance.

1239
01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:29.280
You've got to fucking get by.
You know,
if you had a kid and he said,
Hey Dad,

1240
01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:33.990
hey dad,
I'm thinking about being a standup people.
Oh fuck yeah.
Oh Jesus.

1241
01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:38.100
Don't do that.
Actually,
if it wasn't funny.
Ah,
that exactly.

1242
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:41.460
That's how my mom treated it when I told her I was going to do it.
Oh,

1243
01:12:41.461 --> 01:12:45.790
I dropped out of law school.
Oh to be a comic after two weeks.
Imagine that.

1244
01:12:45.791 --> 01:12:49.020
And my parents are immigrants who escaped from Hungary to come here.
So,

1245
01:12:49.050 --> 01:12:52.940
oh my God.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

1246
01:12:53.010 --> 01:12:57.030
But it is that we met like we talk about that,
like who else would,
uh,
tolerate,

1247
01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:01.080
tolerate what you say,
you know?
Yeah.
Because,
uh,
um,
you know,

1248
01:13:01.081 --> 01:13:03.450
were very inappropriate by yeah.
Normal people.

1249
01:13:03.451 --> 01:13:07.110
Whatever standards outside of comedy world.
Yeah.
W you know,

1250
01:13:07.111 --> 01:13:10.480
I was talking with Amy Schumer about this.
We're,
we're,
we're sitting down and uh,

1251
01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:13.900
she,
she said something about her,
her mom,
like what,

1252
01:13:13.901 --> 01:13:15.120
what her mom was made or something.

1253
01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:19.290
And some somehow or another I got to asking her whether or not her mom was a

1254
01:13:19.291 --> 01:13:22.230
comment or say said you waiting room.
I was a cut.
And I was like,

1255
01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:25.630
it's so funny that you know with Comedians you can do that.
Yeah.

1256
01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:29.310
My mom is a cunt.
Right.
You know,
you could say that.

1257
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:32.550
But if you send that to like a lot of regular people,
like fuck you man,

1258
01:13:32.551 --> 01:13:36.510
that's my mom bro.
That's not cool.
You know,
we say that to each other.

1259
01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:38.340
That's the dude.
What's his name?
Uh,

1260
01:13:38.410 --> 01:13:41.570
his name is Mike Daisy audience protest.

1261
01:13:41.571 --> 01:13:45.360
I want you to feel bad ass Brian is how did you not win the shorty award dude?

1262
01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:49.080
Cause it's not real want doing here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Play.
It's kind of interesting.

1263
01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:52.510
<v 6>You can never fully be in that moment because you're thinking about what that</v>

1264
01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:54.640
moment signifies.
And Paris Hilton,

1265
01:13:55.150 --> 01:13:59.200
Paris Hilton thinking Paris Hilton is thinking,
Oh my God,
Oh my God,

1266
01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:00.790
I'm Paris Hilton.

1267
01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:07.140
<v 0>That was the punchline that I had already given away.</v>

1268
01:14:08.730 --> 01:14:12.140
Now they get up and so he's sitting there,
he's got this change space.

1269
01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:15.400
<v 2>Um,
I think it's like 40 people or something like that.</v>

1270
01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:19.060
It was like the first time it show had sold out and now he doesn't know what's

1271
01:14:19.061 --> 01:14:19.960
going on.
He's sitting there,

1272
01:14:19.961 --> 01:14:23.410
they're getting up and then one guy takes his water and he just starts pouring

1273
01:14:23.411 --> 01:14:24.244
it on the notes.

1274
01:14:24.490 --> 01:14:28.420
So Christian life and then he shoved the water bottle in Mike's Class.

1275
01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:35.440
Wow.
Yeah.
He just got up and fuck with them

1276
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:42.130
and they said they're leaving because of the language.
That's the producer.

1277
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:43.833
What do you want to do?

1278
01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:50.950
And so he's tries to talk to them.

1279
01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:55.970
He gets up and he like,
he's the,
all these people were filing out just yet.

1280
01:14:56.150 --> 01:14:57.410
<v 6>Any of you people are leaving,</v>

1281
01:14:57.411 --> 01:15:01.130
want to stay and talk about this or do you own or run out like power?
Huh?

1282
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:09.180
You really don't even want to hear what the thoughts that he came to my show to

1283
01:15:09.181 --> 01:15:11.120
see or do you want to walk out like powers?

1284
01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:14.950
Cause I can refrain from using language when talking to you,

1285
01:15:14.951 --> 01:15:19.570
but I'd like you to use the English language to talk to me.
Insulted my show.

1286
01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:23.660
You poured water on my art.
You messed up my things here.
Are you all,

1287
01:15:23.661 --> 01:15:27.480
do you all intend to just walk out of here?
Okay.
Hey Man,

1288
01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:30.880
you here to be an adult.
Would you like to stay and talk about that?

1289
01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:44.450
<v 2>Okay,
so then he gets back and he kinda like,
he takes it really well.</v>

1290
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:47.690
He comes back and sits down and then joking around about it.

1291
01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:54.550
<v 6>All right.
Are you guys leaving?
Is there anyone that would like to speak to what</v>

1292
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:05.410
ma'am,
please pick a message back to your people.
People find,

1293
01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:09.420
know what you're going to see before you see it.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Yes.

1294
01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:19.110
Get off work those days.
Day.

1295
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:21.360
I can't believe none of you.

1296
01:16:21.630 --> 01:16:24.180
None of you would have the guts to stay here and talk to me.

1297
01:16:24.570 --> 01:16:27.420
<v 2>That guy does.
The sound guy is why</v>

1298
01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:31.010
<v 6>you with this route?
Oh,
well.
Oh,
okay.</v>

1299
01:16:31.011 --> 01:16:32.660
Well we don't have to live with what we were talking about

1300
01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:35.860
<v 2>by the way.
The point is like,
just like your shows,
a lot of people,</v>

1301
01:16:35.861 --> 01:16:40.470
they don't know exactly what you're doing.
They're coming to a comedy show.
Yeah.

1302
01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:43.000
Whatever's there.
We wouldn't do that to a movie.

1303
01:16:43.001 --> 01:16:45.280
You don't want what's playing at the movie theater?
I don't care.
Oh,

1304
01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:49.930
I pay money and two drinks and everything.
Households would,
yeah.
Yeah.

1305
01:16:50.050 --> 01:16:52.620
Assholes would.
They would yell out at the movie theater to,
yeah.

1306
01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:58.510
Think about when they go to comedy is when they assume that the show and the

1307
01:16:58.511 --> 01:17:01.360
comedy should be like presented to what?

1308
01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:03.770
Like when they think that should be reticent to their tastes.
Yeah.

1309
01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:06.590
Otherwise when they're like,
yeah,
but I'm,
I'm not into this.
I,

1310
01:17:06.591 --> 01:17:08.350
it's like this isn't,
this isn't for you.

1311
01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:11.600
I had a lady yell out next subject once of the car,

1312
01:17:13.010 --> 01:17:16.610
next subject.
She,
I think she's even said drop it.
Next subject.

1313
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:22.410
I've had that when they go like move it along,
get past this.
It was my,

1314
01:17:22.411 --> 01:17:25.970
my cloning Jesus bit.
There was a company called,

1315
01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:28.760
I forget what it was.
It was,

1316
01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:32.390
it turned out to be parody and what they were though.
Oh,

1317
01:17:32.391 --> 01:17:34.670
the second coming project.
That's what the idea was.

1318
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:37.880
The idea was they're going to take genetic material off of the shroud of Turin

1319
01:17:37.881 --> 01:17:41.780
and they were going to use it to clone Jesus and then my joke was like that

1320
01:17:41.781 --> 01:17:45.920
stuff first of all is not a hundred percent accurate.

1321
01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.960
Like they look Dolly the sheep,

1322
01:17:47.961 --> 01:17:51.260
they had to clone a bunch of dollars before they got one that would live.
I go,

1323
01:17:51.261 --> 01:17:56.261
what if the clone Jesus and he comes back retarded when it happens and I go to

1324
01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:01.040
what do you,
what do you want it?
It's your call.
I go,
I say,
we follow them.

1325
01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:02.030
It could be a test,

1326
01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:07.380
it feels like a test to me and then like [inaudible] water and the wine.

1327
01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:12.550
He would turn dark shit and the cookies
and then I,

1328
01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:14.290
I had this been,

1329
01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:18.170
I was in the middle of doing it and this is fucking check just goes,

1330
01:18:18.710 --> 01:18:22.100
she just goes next subject,
next subject.

1331
01:18:22.670 --> 01:18:23.960
But people feel like if you're,

1332
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:26.180
especially if you're saying something about religion,

1333
01:18:26.181 --> 01:18:29.000
which even though to the rational person,

1334
01:18:29.001 --> 01:18:34.001
it really is kind of silly to be connected inexorably to some ideology who's

1335
01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:38.180
ringing.
It's probably the most unprofessional person in the red.

1336
01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:42.410
It's probably me then
I thought it was Tommy.

1337
01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:44.390
Why am I so unprofessional?

1338
01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:49.790
Hey,
so I got a new game for you guys to play.

1339
01:18:50.890 --> 01:18:55.710
I tried who not flush the toilet as long as possible.
So you have to,

1340
01:18:55.730 --> 01:18:59.140
you have to stack your shit on hers.
Vice versa,
like

1341
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:05.000
flush in Seattle.
Just try it and see how,
see if you can go three days.
That's,

1342
01:19:05.001 --> 01:19:08.630
that's my cutoff.
How wins after one?
I'm sorry about that.

1343
01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:11.510
My apologies for the songwriting.
What the hell were we talking about?

1344
01:19:11.511 --> 01:19:15.440
I shut the other phone off dinner.
Hopefully you're talking about Oh,
next bit.

1345
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:19.250
Yeah.
It's just uh,
you know,
especially what I was saying,

1346
01:19:19.251 --> 01:19:22.970
cause when it's a religious thing like people like feel it really feel like this

1347
01:19:22.971 --> 01:19:27.740
is something you are not allowed to talk about.
This is,
this is my religion.

1348
01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:30.920
It's funny when they say that you shouldn't talk about politics or religion.

1349
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:34.010
Those are the two things you should avoid.
Well those are the only,

1350
01:19:34.011 --> 01:19:36.500
there's only a couple left for me to find out if you're crazy.

1351
01:19:36.650 --> 01:19:39.770
What do you think about ghosts?
You know,
you ever see a Ufo?

1352
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:42.470
There's only a couple more things I have left for me to find out what you're

1353
01:19:42.471 --> 01:19:46.670
fucking crazy,
you know,
have to get to politics or as soon as you go,
well,

1354
01:19:46.671 --> 01:19:49.250
you know,
I've always been Republican.
I'm going to stick with the party.

1355
01:19:49.251 --> 01:19:52.190
I think the party line is absolutely right and sometimes we go a little off

1356
01:19:52.191 --> 01:19:56.780
track.
Oh,
you crazy ass over.
It's all.
So if I can't talk politics with that guy,

1357
01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:59.810
we went to talk big foot,
we're going to talk Sasquatch.

1358
01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:04.750
People get really fucking mad man.
They feel like they're,

1359
01:20:04.751 --> 01:20:08.220
they're allowed to get mad too.
It's not like they disagree with you on,

1360
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:11.290
they take pride in getting mad about it.
Sure.
Yeah.
Well it's righteous.
Yeah.

1361
01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:14.890
Righteous.
And even to the point of,
you know,

1362
01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:18.430
finding an excuse to commit violence.
Yeah.

1363
01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:23.660
I mean that guy only poured water on the,
uh,
the notes.
How close,
you know,

1364
01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:26.580
you pour water on some dude's notes and they're going to fucking throw a water

1365
01:20:26.581 --> 01:20:29.650
bottle at you and you might hit them and they might hit,
you know,

1366
01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.800
it might turn into some physical altercation.

1367
01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:34.310
You can't pour water on someone's fucking,
no,

1368
01:20:34.311 --> 01:20:37.530
it's cause you don't like what they're saying.
That's a complete douchebag move.

1369
01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:38.670
Unless the guy,

1370
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:42.600
his notes are all a bunch of lies about you or something and you're mad.

1371
01:20:42.601 --> 01:20:45.390
But if it's about Paris Hilton and you fucking Weirdo,

1372
01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:47.250
that's what you're picking your battles right there.

1373
01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:49.680
So this was not like a protest to go to this show.

1374
01:20:49.681 --> 01:20:52.920
This was actually a group that went to a show and we're like,
we don't like this.

1375
01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:58.300
He says that he says the f word and then these grownups can't handle what Fascia

1376
01:20:58.471 --> 01:21:01.800
is he on Broadway or some shit?
I don't know.
It's in New York.
I Dunno.

1377
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:05.550
It's in New York.
That's so nuts,
man.
It's fascinating.

1378
01:21:05.551 --> 01:21:07.200
I don't want to hear the f word.

1379
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:11.250
The way he handled it was really interesting too.
You know,
it was,

1380
01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:15.030
he was much more offended than I think a comedian would be in the same
situation.

1381
01:21:15.090 --> 01:21:16.110
Yeah.
You know,

1382
01:21:16.111 --> 01:21:20.010
it's like they came to his show and they fucked up his whole thing,
you know?

1383
01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:23.620
Yeah.
We're just used to being where she used to be fucked for the car.

1384
01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:27.120
It's like Friday,
late show.
Let's do it.
Oh God.
Sorry.

1385
01:21:27.121 --> 01:21:31.680
Late shows always the most brutal,
right?
Yeah.
Was hammered.
Everyone's tired.
Yeah.

1386
01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:33.810
And you don't go when they get,
you don't go when they're leaving,

1387
01:21:33.811 --> 01:21:37.220
you don't go like,
does anyone want to stay in?
Discuss this?
You're just like,

1388
01:21:37.230 --> 01:21:40.840
get the fuck Outta here.
You piece of shit.
Oh,

1389
01:21:41.490 --> 01:21:45.480
Jesus Christ.
Oh fuck yourself.
Those are brutal shows.

1390
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:49.290
How about the late show?
Saturday when you have to do three.

1391
01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:54.600
I gave up on those.
The moment I could.
I remember those.
I get those calls.

1392
01:21:54.690 --> 01:21:58.410
No third show on Saturday.
No,
no.
Third trouble.
Last time you were here.

1393
01:21:58.411 --> 01:22:01.750
We do a third.
It was pretty successful.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
For you.

1394
01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:05.700
Not for my fucking soul.
For my soul.

1395
01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:12.510
How many people are asleep at those shows?
Like literally asleep,
sitting there

1396
01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:17.860
drunk to the point of just complete and coherent.

1397
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:21.210
You're doing that third show was a brand to feel like this.

1398
01:22:21.211 --> 01:22:24.140
We're a 15 minute show.
This wouldn't be that bad because they're,

1399
01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:28.400
they're still into it.
And then that,
that all sudden the headline spots brewed,

1400
01:22:28.401 --> 01:22:32.010
right?
The road starts to turn and sometimes you'll see a feature,

1401
01:22:32.011 --> 01:22:36.030
have a great set,
and then you get up there and you're like 10,

1402
01:22:36.031 --> 01:22:37.980
15 minutes and you're like,
this shit is starting to change.

1403
01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:43.080
[inaudible]

1404
01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:48.000
matches the amount of shots that have important.
That room

1405
01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:51.240
you should cut short.

1406
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:56.270
I would say do like a 45 minutes or 40 minutes if you've got to do a midnight

1407
01:22:56.401 --> 01:22:59.190
show.
Those fucking chose the good thing about it,

1408
01:22:59.191 --> 01:23:03.810
like Ari Shapiro and I were talking about,
um,
the,
uh,
opening spot at a,
like,

1409
01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:06.070
one of the things that makes you really powerful is

1410
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:09.040
<v 0>doing an opening spot where you have to go on first.</v>

1411
01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:12.700
The crowd's not warmed up at all and you go on doing that.
It's like,

1412
01:23:12.730 --> 01:23:16.780
it makes you really fucking focus and lock in quickly.
You can't,

1413
01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:21.400
you can't just coast on the energy that's already been on stage before you and

1414
01:23:21.670 --> 01:23:25.120
when to when people do well,
you know,
and they're gone before you,

1415
01:23:25.121 --> 01:23:29.000
you or you can just ride their energy.
Just go up there and coast.
But the,

1416
01:23:29.150 --> 01:23:33.190
but the open gate,
yeah.
Really Strengthens your act.
You know,

1417
01:23:33.191 --> 01:23:36.070
like I remember I watched you do it a bunch of times when we went on the road

1418
01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:39.190
and you know,
I could see you like setting up right away.

1419
01:23:39.191 --> 01:23:43.060
You want to make sure that you come out of the gates strong and confident.

1420
01:23:43.061 --> 01:23:46.530
He hit them with some good shit right away.
And then,
yeah.
It's like,

1421
01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:50.150
it's a tricky little first moment.
The first moment they see you up there.
Yeah.

1422
01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:54.970
How's this going to go?
It's so important though to do it.

1423
01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:58.120
Like to try to do it right right away.

1424
01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:02.040
Get them on board immediately and then you get your own wave.
Yes.

1425
01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:04.690
It's super strong for your,
for your act.
Totally.

1426
01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:08.560
You really learn how to develop like weapons,
like an opening weapon.

1427
01:24:08.970 --> 01:24:13.010
No know this one's going to fucking check Martin a deck.
That's why I love black

1428
01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:16.420
<v 5>Guardian says like,
and I did Cleveland and there's so many black people.</v>

1429
01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:19.670
<v 0>I love that there might,</v>

1430
01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:23.720
<v 5>they're my favorite because if they smell your fear,
you're fucked.</v>

1431
01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:27.980
If they even sense for a minute that you hesitate or that you're afraid of them,

1432
01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:32.090
like the whole energy shifts.
But if they like you and they see let you,

1433
01:24:32.091 --> 01:24:35.330
don't give a fuck about what they think of you.
You're,
you're good.

1434
01:24:35.890 --> 01:24:37.690
<v 0>I did a lot of black clubs in Boston,</v>

1435
01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:42.640
did a lot of shit and Matt a pan and there was a,
a dude who,
uh,
booked.

1436
01:24:42.641 --> 01:24:44.670
He's really good clubs.
There were really good closet.

1437
01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:48.900
It was all black crowds and it paid better than the white shows.
It was great.

1438
01:24:49.690 --> 01:24:53.560
It was fascinating,
man watching him.
One guy couldn't do his room because he had,

1439
01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:58.000
uh,
uh,
uh,
strict censorship policy,
very strict.

1440
01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:01.390
He would like give the comics,
uh,
uh,
speech before the show.
It was hilarious.

1441
01:25:01.391 --> 01:25:05.980
My friend John worked,
dangles,
no mother fuckers know mother fuckers.

1442
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:10.360
He goes,
no bitch.
Okay,
that's a lady.
And he goes,
you don't say,

1443
01:25:10.361 --> 01:25:11.620
Oh that bitch had a big ass.

1444
01:25:11.621 --> 01:25:15.640
You said that woman had a wide behind coaching.

1445
01:25:15.641 --> 01:25:18.490
He actually said that you don't see that girl had a big ass.

1446
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:24.030
She had a wide behind and they made people do you know like a really clean

1447
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:28.990
censored comedy but like it was one of the best rooms.

1448
01:25:29.170 --> 01:25:31.780
It was one of the roads where I wish that I did clean comedy.

1449
01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:36.940
You could fucking crush that Rome like they were.
They laughed hard.

1450
01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:41.170
It was a one of the first times I ever saw Reggie McFadden to Reggie McFadden

1451
01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:44.560
who is one of those guys that I never understood why Reginald McFadden never

1452
01:25:44.770 --> 01:25:46.420
became fucking huge.

1453
01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:51.720
The regimen and then I knew from like 1998 1991 I was convinced that that kid

1454
01:25:53.201 --> 01:25:56.860
was going to be like one of the top standup comedians in the country and one of

1455
01:25:56.890 --> 01:26:00.370
the places I saw him was that the champagne comedy club.

1456
01:26:00.910 --> 01:26:04.340
No motherfuckers know fuckers.
You can't say bitch,

1457
01:26:04.341 --> 01:26:07.440
that's a lady as a lady you don't say the bitch had a why.

1458
01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:10.670
That bitch had a big ass shit a wide behind.
Yeah.

1459
01:26:10.671 --> 01:26:13.500
You have to say that he had very strict rules.
God,

1460
01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:17.610
thank God I didn't have to be a clean comic these days.
Like it's brutal.

1461
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:19.160
Well,
you know,

1462
01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:22.370
what people don't understand is that everybody sort of got the idea that clean

1463
01:26:22.371 --> 01:26:25.620
comedy was smart comedy because of television.
You know,

1464
01:26:25.730 --> 01:26:29.930
the only reason why you had to have things clean on television,

1465
01:26:29.931 --> 01:26:34.280
it's because you didn't want to offend the advertisers.
It's really simple.

1466
01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:37.790
So everybody basically became a bitch to the advertisers.

1467
01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:41.090
The advertisers don't you want you to talking about overthrowing the government.

1468
01:26:41.091 --> 01:26:42.770
That's what they censored.
Hicks is shit.

1469
01:26:42.771 --> 01:26:46.000
When Ben Hicks was on CBS and Kitson Boom,

1470
01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:51.020
can't show smoking weed.
You can't show a lot of things.
You know,
advertisers,

1471
01:26:51.021 --> 01:26:54.680
they want,
they want to be able to sell to the most amount of people possible.

1472
01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:59.180
Well then there's no artistic integrity or you know,
the right to opinion.

1473
01:26:59.181 --> 01:27:03.620
All that stuff's out the window when you're selling shit.
So they,
you know,

1474
01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:07.790
it's interesting that kind of explains why TV sets are still sort of middle of

1475
01:27:07.791 --> 01:27:12.320
the road.
Sure.
In terms of the sensor,
the shit out of your set.
You know,

1476
01:27:12.321 --> 01:27:17.321
there's very few like really edgy topics you could get away with if you know

1477
01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:18.680
you're doing a Letterman said,

1478
01:27:18.681 --> 01:27:21.200
are you doing within that scene on that's not where it's for what it's for.

1479
01:27:21.201 --> 01:27:22.790
You know,
it's a,
it's,
it is what it is,

1480
01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:25.550
but I don't think it's a more clever way of doing comedy.

1481
01:27:25.570 --> 01:27:27.380
I've always found that it's,
you know,

1482
01:27:27.381 --> 01:27:32.240
to put shackles on yourself as a writing exercise.
I absolutely agree with.

1483
01:27:32.241 --> 01:27:33.680
I think I like to do that.

1484
01:27:33.681 --> 01:27:36.500
That's one of the things I like about Twitter is the hundred and 40 character

1485
01:27:36.501 --> 01:27:40.400
limit.
I think,
you know,
I think it actually helps my writing like little zingers,

1486
01:27:40.401 --> 01:27:44.150
you know,
a little quick lines.
But I think to,
to try to put like,

1487
01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:46.910
you know,
it's,
it's uh,

1488
01:27:47.690 --> 01:27:52.690
it's hard to figure out how to do comedy and do it like the most with the most

1489
01:27:54.471 --> 01:27:56.750
effective way with the least amount of extra words.

1490
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:59.740
Like you ever watch a guy talk on stage and he'd go,
this is like,

1491
01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:02.660
get to the fucking write.
The jokes are really funny,

1492
01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:05.960
but the setup is like too clunky.
There's too much words there,

1493
01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:10.400
but then you watch a guy like Joey Diaz and one of the art form that is Joey is

1494
01:28:10.401 --> 01:28:14.450
Joe uses the least amount of words possible for the most impact.
Like he's a,

1495
01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:18.860
he's brilliant at that.
Yeah,
it's a great way.
That's a great formula period.

1496
01:28:18.861 --> 01:28:21.440
Like the thing that I see people like younger comics,

1497
01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:23.120
I think screw grew up with the most,

1498
01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:28.250
is not saying they don't have a clear view of what their point is.

1499
01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:32.540
In other words,
they have their jokes,
right?
They,
they,
they,
if they make,

1500
01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:35.930
if you make the setup and the point that you're making upfront,
clear,

1501
01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:40.130
your joke will be more effective about it,
but they talk around their point.

1502
01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:43.850
The premise,
the premise is like,
you're like,
I think you're saying this,

1503
01:28:44.150 --> 01:28:46.580
and they have a joke and they're like,
oh,
I wonder why that joke doesn't go.

1504
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:51.750
Part of it is listening to your recordings.
I should fucking news.

1505
01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:56.090
Everybody does.
Yeah,
but you got to do it.
Do you have an iPhone?

1506
01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:59.600
Do you have that voice notes?
Thanking your record.
Do you record your sets?

1507
01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:03.010
Done it once or twice but it fucking amazing.
I know I have to

1508
01:29:05.190 --> 01:29:06.000
do all the time.

1509
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.170
I'll listen to it all the time and it helps me a lot because if I take like a

1510
01:29:10.170 --> 01:29:13.120
week off I'll just listen to like four or five sets in a row and it's like I'm

1511
01:29:13.121 --> 01:29:17.900
right,
I'm right back in groove.
Crazy that a week off a month.

1512
01:29:18.090 --> 01:29:20.160
I don't like taking,
I don't like taking a week off.

1513
01:29:20.610 --> 01:29:22.860
I like to do at least one set a week,
you know,

1514
01:29:22.861 --> 01:29:25.770
to warm like if I'm in the warm up stages but like,

1515
01:29:25.771 --> 01:29:27.450
because I'm doing this thing in Atlanta,

1516
01:29:27.451 --> 01:29:31.590
I did you know Fort Lauderdale for a week and then I was here for a week and

1517
01:29:31.591 --> 01:29:34.140
then before that we were in Louisville for a week.
So it was like to

1518
01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:39.600
get in comedy shape,
you know,
you get,
you get used up,
banging it out,

1519
01:29:39.630 --> 01:29:43.260
paying it up and yeah,
I don't like taking a week off.
I've took,

1520
01:29:43.261 --> 01:29:46.350
I took it a more than a month off before.
It's weird.

1521
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:52.050
I've ever taken off in 10 years is about just under a month.

1522
01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:55.850
Yeah.
People don't understand.
It's like you,
you,
there's a,

1523
01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:59.820
a certain amount of a conditioning that's necessary to be a comedian.

1524
01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:04.170
It's like a certain amount of getting used to it and doing it all the time.

1525
01:30:04.171 --> 01:30:07.140
Like it almost like you're like,
like you know,
like radiation,

1526
01:30:07.170 --> 01:30:09.590
you've got to fucking build up a tolerance for it or something.
Yeah.

1527
01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:14.880
Which is a terrible analogy cause you can't build up a tolerance for radiation.

1528
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:19.530
I don't know what it is.
Very momentum based,
carry that momentum.

1529
01:30:19.531 --> 01:30:22.750
If you're doing it a lot and you go through things,

1530
01:30:23.150 --> 01:30:26.810
he wouldn't have been doing it.
If you do weeks off and you go try to do so,

1531
01:30:26.811 --> 01:30:30.630
you're like,
that was fucking all when we work together,
we did that um,

1532
01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:32.670
maximum comedy thing and Phoenix,

1533
01:30:32.671 --> 01:30:36.840
the first time we worked together and me and Charlie Murphy and John Heffron had

1534
01:30:36.841 --> 01:30:41.100
been doing these dates all over the country.
We did like 22 shows in a row.

1535
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:42.900
So we were just on fire.

1536
01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:46.290
And so what a great feeling then is when you're doing that many sets and you

1537
01:30:46.291 --> 01:30:48.510
just,
you just go out there and fucking level it.

1538
01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:54.690
So like you know exactly your beats and you and you figured out that you can add

1539
01:30:54.691 --> 01:30:56.970
something here and change something.
That was,

1540
01:30:57.030 --> 01:31:01.290
that was a fun time and that's where I realized what size balls Charlie Murphy

1541
01:31:01.291 --> 01:31:04.440
has.
Charlie Murphy has gigantic balls,

1542
01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:08.880
literally like big put on our foreheads and take pictures.

1543
01:31:08.910 --> 01:31:12.360
Hold them hostage.
No,
he,
he would,
he was like headlining duty.

1544
01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:15.360
Don't even been doing comedy for like two years.
It's crazy.

1545
01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:18.450
He was headlining and doing an hour and he'd only been doing comedy for two

1546
01:31:18.451 --> 01:31:21.450
years.
He has massive balls.
That guy,

1547
01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:23.880
he just basically took an opportunity.

1548
01:31:24.030 --> 01:31:26.970
He got on the Chappelle show who's basically an active before that took that

1549
01:31:26.971 --> 01:31:27.780
opportunity,

1550
01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:30.810
started doing these little things where he would host things and then people

1551
01:31:30.811 --> 01:31:33.150
started giving them money to headline and next thing you know he's a fucking

1552
01:31:33.151 --> 01:31:36.090
professional comedian and now he's headline and all over the world.
Yeah,

1553
01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:38.910
it's crazy.
I mean that's,
that's balls.
I mean,

1554
01:31:38.911 --> 01:31:43.780
he's in his forties when that all happened.
That's why I was starting.

1555
01:31:43.781 --> 01:31:45.940
And you're going to manage how bananas.

1556
01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:48.810
I fucking loved hanging out with him though.
He's a great guy.

1557
01:31:49.050 --> 01:31:51.480
Loved hanging out with him on the road.
I remember how much fun Charlie was.

1558
01:31:53.130 --> 01:31:56.760
Charlie Murphy enrich.
I went to,
I went to dinner with them one of those nights.

1559
01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:58.800
Oh yeah.
He took me to dinner.
It couldn't have been nicer.

1560
01:31:58.801 --> 01:32:02.940
He had be pissing my pants.
The stories talking about it.

1561
01:32:02.941 --> 01:32:06.880
That was a fucking hanging out with Mike Tyson and Oh yeah,

1562
01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:10.150
that story that he told on the podcast about the lion.

1563
01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:12.760
Did you ever hear that story told Stan someone animate that shit?

1564
01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:16.960
I feel like so many animated the story and the line.
He also told me some,

1565
01:32:16.961 --> 01:32:21.010
but maybe I'm getting confused story about like somebody disrespected him in

1566
01:32:21.011 --> 01:32:24.880
front of his dad and he had this,
like,
he got so enraged,
but he,

1567
01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:28.390
the way he told the story I,
you weren't like,
wow,
this is serious shit.

1568
01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:32.560
I was just like fucking crying,
laughing about how upset he got.
You know,

1569
01:32:32.890 --> 01:32:36.540
he's just,
he's naturally,
there's a reason those,
those,
uh,
real hot,

1570
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:40.780
true Hollywood stories are so fun.
He's his,
his way of telling a story.
It's just,

1571
01:32:40.781 --> 01:32:45.310
you know what I mean?
Diction and the cadence and the way he paints a picture.

1572
01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:49.510
That dude's just naturally,
it's the Joe Rogan experience.
Mike Tyson.
Youtube.

1573
01:32:49.630 --> 01:32:53.590
This is a,
just go to a,
he was on our podcast.
We talked about it,
dude.

1574
01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:57.460
So if you go to,
um,
go to the Joe Rogan experience,
Mike Tyson,

1575
01:32:57.620 --> 01:33:02.090
he talks about Mike and visited like Tyson's over his house and it's,

1576
01:33:02.290 --> 01:33:06.550
and some of the animated it.
Oh,
that's cool.
Yeah.
That's great diction.
Yeah,

1577
01:33:06.551 --> 01:33:09.430
he does.
I seen Mike come rent.
Yeah.

1578
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:13.330
Mike is really weird because like,
we didn't know him at all.

1579
01:33:13.331 --> 01:33:14.920
And then next thing you know,
a month,

1580
01:33:14.921 --> 01:33:17.890
every single day we're hanging out with him.
Couldn't have been better.

1581
01:33:18.110 --> 01:33:22.380
A different city that was exhausted.
It was great.
That's awesome.
Yeah.

1582
01:33:22.450 --> 01:33:24.650
It was the most confusing time ever though.
Like,
yeah,

1583
01:33:24.651 --> 01:33:27.870
we didn't know where we were.
We would wake up,
we had nowhere were,
were

1584
01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:33.760
buses and shit or what,
we were supposed to have a tour bus with a tour bus,

1585
01:33:33.761 --> 01:33:38.390
ripped us off the scanner.
They scammed us.
There was a,

1586
01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:41.890
they had an address and we drove to where the address was and it was literally

1587
01:33:41.891 --> 01:33:46.870
an abandoned lot.
They scan,
they scammed.
Susman yeah.
See this is it,

1588
01:33:46.871 --> 01:33:50.350
but this just the animation where he's talking about Mike Tyson.

1589
01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:55.330
Yeah.
If you could find that folks,
if you're interested in it,
it's uh,
I'll,

1590
01:33:55.331 --> 01:33:58.630
I'll tweet it later too when I told you to ask him because that was another

1591
01:33:58.710 --> 01:33:59.543
story.

1592
01:34:03.770 --> 01:34:04.720
Like Johnny Gill,

1593
01:34:04.721 --> 01:34:09.721
he's like Johnny Gill and done it feels like I could fuck up Oscar de la Hoya.

1594
01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:11.620
He's like,
I'm gonna tell.
Ask Her that shit.

1595
01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:18.040
Yeah.
Charlie's an old school karate guy.

1596
01:34:19.090 --> 01:34:21.870
Charlie Murphy was a old school karate guy.
He was,

1597
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:24.460
he was doing karate from the time he was a young kid.

1598
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:28.640
So me and him had like a lot of karate stories and martial arts story.

1599
01:34:28.641 --> 01:34:32.260
She's a huge,
like martial arts.
You're fishing Otto,
he sees you.
He'll go,

1600
01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:37.390
he knows everybody.
That was something about fighting.
You know,
it's funny,

1601
01:34:37.391 --> 01:34:40.510
like when somebody who says like,
I could whip that guy's ass,

1602
01:34:40.511 --> 01:34:43.510
and you're talking about like a professional fighter is like,
oh,
it's so,

1603
01:34:43.690 --> 01:34:47.210
it's a horrible thing to watch.
But I've heard it.
I've heard it come out of,
uh,

1604
01:34:47.211 --> 01:34:50.740
of many,
uh,
guy's mouth and many of them talking about bro it off.

1605
01:34:50.741 --> 01:34:54.820
Those are the months I,
you something.
Uriah Faber,
he fights at 135 pounds.

1606
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:58.640
And if you're like some regular dude and you're six foot three and you weigh 230

1607
01:34:58.641 --> 01:35:03.290
pounds,
that little dude's gonna fuck you up.
He's gonna fuck you up.

1608
01:35:03.291 --> 01:35:05.380
He's going to be doing things to you that you don't even know when he's done

1609
01:35:05.381 --> 01:35:08.720
before he's doing him.
And it'll be too late.
And if he gets a hold of your neck,

1610
01:35:08.721 --> 01:35:12.310
you're going to sleep.
It doesn't matter if you weighed 300 pounds,
if you're IFA,

1611
01:35:12.311 --> 01:35:15.770
favor can get a real gay teen around your neck,
night,
night,
night,
night,

1612
01:35:15.771 --> 01:35:19.280
you go sleep.
It doesn't,
it's not that hard to cut off the blood to the brain.

1613
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.730
You know,

1614
01:35:19.730 --> 01:35:23.080
you just pinch those arteries together and if you have a good grip and you're

1615
01:35:23.081 --> 01:35:23.601
right,
it does.

1616
01:35:23.601 --> 01:35:27.830
If he can hang on and keep that guy from prying them off or just 15 seconds,

1617
01:35:27.831 --> 01:35:32.570
I bet he can do to there.
I bet he puts,
I got asleep.
You know there's,

1618
01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:35.750
there's a lot of dudes out there that are professional fighters and I bet they

1619
01:35:35.751 --> 01:35:38.960
get disrespected occasionally,
occasionally by dummies,

1620
01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:41.480
but for the most part I think people are pretty cool about it.

1621
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:42.530
Well the thing was the,
the,

1622
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:46.340
the whole reason that we were talking about that with that story about Johnny

1623
01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:50.600
Gill and Oscar de la Hoya was because people would say it about Oscar Moore

1624
01:35:50.601 --> 01:35:52.580
because he had the pretty boy image.
It's like,
yeah,

1625
01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:57.470
that pretty boy could fuck you up dude.
Manny Pacquiao man,
I met Manny Pacquiao.

1626
01:35:57.471 --> 01:36:01.550
He's like this tiny guy.
He's like real super sweet and friendly.
Mainly pack.

1627
01:36:01.551 --> 01:36:04.490
Yeah,
we'll fuck you man.
Totally.
Now.

1628
01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:06.530
And it would happen faster than you could get your hands up.

1629
01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:10.510
Like it wouldn't be over before you position yourself for your first part.

1630
01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:14.780
Well he Margarito he broke both his eye sockets

1631
01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:20.700
so fast,
so strong and just heal that you'd go to surgery.
He had a,

1632
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:24.230
he had an artificial implants.
Yes.
But one of his lenses,

1633
01:36:24.231 --> 01:36:27.080
one of his lens is apparently got damaged in the fight to his eye,

1634
01:36:27.081 --> 01:36:28.580
completely swole up.

1635
01:36:28.970 --> 01:36:33.470
One of them was just really fucked up and the apparently just Manny Pacquiao

1636
01:36:33.471 --> 01:36:37.040
just tuned his face up.
And what's really crazy is like earlier in the fight,

1637
01:36:37.041 --> 01:36:39.740
like he was telling me [inaudible] corner man,
he's got no power.

1638
01:36:39.741 --> 01:36:40.574
It's got no power.

1639
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:44.330
I don't know if Manny like baited him in like maybe Manny played pitty pat with

1640
01:36:44.331 --> 01:36:46.700
his face a little bit and then started landing some bombs on him.

1641
01:36:46.701 --> 01:36:49.810
But he is dealing with a guy,
you know this,

1642
01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:53.120
that level that Manny pack yell level.
Floyd Mayweather level.

1643
01:36:53.210 --> 01:36:55.880
There's their masters one really?
Well,

1644
01:36:55.881 --> 01:37:00.800
mark has super elite masters of,
of boxing.
Yeah.
And it's so fun to watch.

1645
01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:05.770
It's so funny.
I've been going to this boxing gym and there's this junior,
uh,

1646
01:37:05.810 --> 01:37:08.100
Olympian who does his sparring there.

1647
01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:11.000
And then I'm sitting there after like a,

1648
01:37:11.090 --> 01:37:15.290
basically like a class in the sparring is going on and the rotating people in

1649
01:37:15.291 --> 01:37:18.740
and they sat in this kid who's really fucking movies land and stuff.

1650
01:37:18.741 --> 01:37:21.560
He's getting hit too,
but I'm like,
I'm like,
this kid is good.
And they're like,

1651
01:37:21.561 --> 01:37:24.920
yeah,
he's been doing it for eight years.
And I was like,
well how old is he?

1652
01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:28.160
And like he just turned 15 and I was like,
that can't kill me.

1653
01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:32.330
Sophomore in high school could kill me,
you know,

1654
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:36.980
he just watching them move and he just had their fearless when there that hold

1655
01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:39.920
it.
There was a kid that used to come to our Jujitsu school and his dad used to

1656
01:37:39.921 --> 01:37:41.420
bring him in when he was in high school.
He was like,

1657
01:37:41.690 --> 01:37:44.090
he was sort of being like sort of partially homeschooled,

1658
01:37:44.091 --> 01:37:45.710
partially tutored by different people,

1659
01:37:45.711 --> 01:37:48.590
but his dad was like real attentive and his dad would bring him in to high

1660
01:37:48.591 --> 01:37:51.980
school and this kid was an assassin.
It was an assassin.

1661
01:37:51.981 --> 01:37:56.880
He was 15 years old and I was a grown man and outweighed him by like 50 pounds.

1662
01:37:56.910 --> 01:38:00.960
And when we would go out and I'd have to watch my fucking ps and qs because that

1663
01:38:00.961 --> 01:38:03.720
kid was looking to put me to sleep or we would go to war,

1664
01:38:04.570 --> 01:38:08.010
I would have to rescope rascal,
you know Russell,
a little rascals.

1665
01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:12.210
Fucking get a grip on them.
Yeah.
It's a scary 10 year old's man.
They got no,

1666
01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:15.770
and that's what he was into.
He was into Jujitsu.
I mean he was an,

1667
01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:18.300
he's amazing at it now.
I mean he was into Jujitsu.

1668
01:38:18.301 --> 01:38:19.860
He was into choking the shit out of people.

1669
01:38:19.861 --> 01:38:21.390
That's what he was concentrating all his time on.

1670
01:38:21.391 --> 01:38:25.290
You know when you're a kid too and you find one thing that you're really fucking

1671
01:38:25.291 --> 01:38:27.450
good at and that feeling of being really good at something,

1672
01:38:27.451 --> 01:38:30.370
it's so fucking nice for kids.
Especially,
I don't know.
I mean,

1673
01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:33.390
I don't know if it goes both.
I'm sure it does go both ways,

1674
01:38:33.391 --> 01:38:37.200
but especially I think when you're a 15 year old boy and you're looking for
that,

1675
01:38:37.290 --> 01:38:39.090
oh yeah.
Direction and approval.

1676
01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:42.580
And you find an activity that you get told you're good at,
you know,

1677
01:38:42.581 --> 01:38:46.940
and for sure you focus on that.
It's also when you do something and you,
you,

1678
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:50.130
it's hard to do and then you do it,
you go,
oh,
I did that.

1679
01:38:50.630 --> 01:38:54.410
I went through something that I had doubts.
It was hard to do,
but it did it.
Yeah,

1680
01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:58.140
I could probably do something else.
Like it gives you this feeling that you can,

1681
01:38:58.170 --> 01:39:01.890
you know,
just attempt things and a conversation.
I mean,
I occasionally,

1682
01:39:01.891 --> 01:39:04.020
I think about like what it would be like to own a restaurant.

1683
01:39:04.050 --> 01:39:07.260
Not that I want to own a restaurant.
I absolutely don't,
but you know,

1684
01:39:07.261 --> 01:39:08.510
and I watched like,
uh,

1685
01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:11.730
one of these TV shows on restaurants like Anthony Bourdain show or something

1686
01:39:11.731 --> 01:39:14.750
like that.
When you deal with these guys who are working 16 hours a day,

1687
01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:18.840
preparation of food and then the going to the market and gathering up all the

1688
01:39:18.841 --> 01:39:22.410
ingredients for creating the menus and it is their life.
And you know,

1689
01:39:22.411 --> 01:39:25.440
when you stop and you think about it,
like,
could you do that?
You know,
would you,

1690
01:39:25.650 --> 01:39:28.260
do you think you could,
you know,
the amount of fucking,

1691
01:39:28.410 --> 01:39:31.350
I'm absolutely positive I could do it if I was so obsessed.

1692
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:33.510
I was obsessed in that way to do it,

1693
01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:38.520
but everybody's got their own little whatever the fuck it is.
Yeah.
Hopefully,

1694
01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:39.900
I don't know if everybody does it here.

1695
01:39:39.901 --> 01:39:44.520
Some people don't have to put so much time and energy into stand up comedian,

1696
01:39:44.521 --> 01:39:45.480
but that's because we love it.

1697
01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:50.610
Like you're always thinking about for sure and material and this and that with

1698
01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:54.390
food.
Do you ever do things like on purpose hoping that it will be funny,

1699
01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:58.410
like go go places like okay this I bought probably get some material out of
this.

1700
01:39:58.411 --> 01:40:02.580
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Totally right.
Yeah.
Well the longer you do it to you,

1701
01:40:02.581 --> 01:40:04.650
the more you feel like,
you know,

1702
01:40:04.710 --> 01:40:08.670
if I try this thing right now and again it doesn't work out like it's okay.

1703
01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:12.540
I know how to get back on the horse right here.
So like you take more risk.

1704
01:40:12.541 --> 01:40:14.790
I think the longer you've been doing it,
right?
Like,
I,

1705
01:40:14.791 --> 01:40:18.390
I feel like if I bring up some shit right now in this fucking failed horribly

1706
01:40:18.391 --> 01:40:21.630
because I don't know what jokes I'm going to say.
I'm going to see what happens.

1707
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:25.410
I could still recover from this show.
He just be like,
oh,

1708
01:40:25.411 --> 01:40:27.350
that was some weird shit that didn't work out fine.

1709
01:40:28.650 --> 01:40:30.820
And then sometimes you get a good joke out of it though,
you know,

1710
01:40:31.050 --> 01:40:35.310
just by trying it.
But I wouldn't have tried that five years ago.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1711
01:40:35.311 --> 01:40:39.150
Sometimes I'll go down dark roads on stage just to see where my fucking head

1712
01:40:39.151 --> 01:40:41.650
pulls me out.
Like if,
if it might be maybe some way,

1713
01:40:41.651 --> 01:40:44.220
there's a way that I can rescue myself,
you know?

1714
01:40:44.221 --> 01:40:47.160
But in life I definitely have done a bunch of things.

1715
01:40:47.161 --> 01:40:49.560
Like when I moved to Colorado,
one of the things I was thinking,
I was like,
damn,

1716
01:40:49.561 --> 01:40:53.940
I want to get a lot of material out of this.
You know,
those 100% I did,
but I did

1717
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:58.630
<v 1>the wrong way.
But you know,
it's still,
it was,
um,
you know,
like a,</v>

1718
01:40:58.631 --> 01:41:02.200
an exercise and doing something to,
so like I'm putting my,

1719
01:41:02.201 --> 01:41:05.590
a new special out filming it next Friday.
So I'm thinking,
man,

1720
01:41:05.591 --> 01:41:06.424
I'm going to have to,

1721
01:41:06.610 --> 01:41:09.880
I'm going to have to do some fucking serious writing over the next couple
months.

1722
01:41:10.290 --> 01:41:13.900
Tomorrow.
It's Friday.
Friday.
Yeah,
that's right.
Oh,
I taste the next Harry.
Well,

1723
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:18.250
yeah,
the one that's coming up next.
Yeah,
next Friday.
This Friday.
This right?

1724
01:41:18.290 --> 01:41:21.460
It was,
yeah.
No,
you're right.
Really?
I shouldn't say next Friday,

1725
01:41:21.550 --> 01:41:25.610
but I mean we're living in the morning.
Yeah.
Tomorrow we leave tomorrow.
I,
oh,

1726
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:30.820
that's really exciting.
It's really exciting.
Them I'm fired up Tabernacle,
right?

1727
01:41:30.821 --> 01:41:31.240
Yeah.

1728
01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:33.700
I'm fired up too to do it in Atlanta because I haven't been in Atlanta forever.

1729
01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:37.390
It's been a long time.
Yeah,
it's perfect because it's all new shit.

1730
01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:40.750
All this stuff that I did before.
I mean,
it's from my talking monkeys on space,

1731
01:41:41.110 --> 01:41:44.860
so this is a completely new hour and a half,
so I'm fucking fired up.
That's Rad,

1732
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:49.690
man.
I'm so excited.
Atlanta start great fucking food too.

1733
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:51.910
I want to take a bite out of peach where we're down there.

1734
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.650
What are you talking about girls?
No.
Yeah,
look at them.
Sexy,
sultry,

1735
01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:59.350
cuddly.
Right at peaches down there.

1736
01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:02.700
What was it like working with Brian at death squad?
Ah,

1737
01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:07.300
this man child before me,
right Brian?

1738
01:42:07.930 --> 01:42:09.340
What is going on in your head?

1739
01:42:09.341 --> 01:42:12.550
I always think about that when my husband is a different kind of a dude.

1740
01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:17.440
It's a numbers game dude.
He's a different kind of dude.

1741
01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:22.270
You got to accept that there's this too.
And also there's Brian.

1742
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:25.430
<v 2>Yeah,
I miss you guys.</v>

1743
01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:30.380
It's one of the very few podcasts that I still listened to and I even still,

1744
01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:32.890
I haven't listened to every single one a year.

1745
01:42:32.930 --> 01:42:35.720
Are you guys still enjoying doing the podcast to,
do you like it now?

1746
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:38.660
Like doing it from home or are you realizing,
oh shit,
it's a lot of work.

1747
01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:42.530
It's both.
It's both.
But to a edit it yourself.

1748
01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:47.980
I mean look for somebody who's not like into having or you know,

1749
01:42:48.090 --> 01:42:51.200
knowing what they're doing.
It was a,
a task,

1750
01:42:51.230 --> 01:42:54.020
like it was harder than I thought just to figure it out.

1751
01:42:54.021 --> 01:42:58.280
But if figured it out after the first one we put up,
it's a disaster.
Disaster.

1752
01:42:58.340 --> 01:43:02.390
And then,
but then you know by the next one I was so happy by the way.

1753
01:43:02.391 --> 01:43:05.340
I was just fucking,
just wrong.
Yeah,
totally.

1754
01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:08.790
So a fucker.
Just kidding.

1755
01:43:08.791 --> 01:43:10.870
I know there were people there were like,

1756
01:43:10.871 --> 01:43:13.040
there was plenty of those tweets shouldn't have left bro.

1757
01:43:14.670 --> 01:43:18.250
We're not friends or some people think that it was like we don't like each
other.

1758
01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:20.940
So your last episode of Desk Squad was kind of funny cause we,

1759
01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:23.690
I kind of jokingly,
it was acting like really like bitch,

1760
01:43:23.691 --> 01:43:27.920
do you know what people also thought was serious when you were like,

1761
01:43:27.970 --> 01:43:31.960
<v 1>you know,
maybe this is the will end up on the show like desk,</v>

1762
01:43:31.961 --> 01:43:33.450
what might end up on TV?
And I was like,
yeah,

1763
01:43:33.530 --> 01:43:37.250
<v 2>hold on.
We don't want to leave yet.
They were like,</v>

1764
01:43:37.251 --> 01:43:38.920
you showed your true colors when you

1765
01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:43.040
were in talks right now with Hbo.
Just so you know,

1766
01:43:43.310 --> 01:43:46.910
we had our second meeting today.
We were just kidding.
No,

1767
01:43:46.911 --> 01:43:51.680
we want to stay serious.
When I said we want to play now,
like,
and they're like,

1768
01:43:51.681 --> 01:43:52.070
you should

1769
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:53.750
<v 1>like it shows what kind of person you are.</v>

1770
01:43:53.751 --> 01:43:58.360
When you said you wanted to say true colors
now,

1771
01:43:58.370 --> 01:44:00.050
but I figured it out.
I figured out,

1772
01:44:00.051 --> 01:44:03.150
I think she had the audio I should say I haven't figured out the video videos.

1773
01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:03.620
Right.

1774
01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:08.620
The audio we figured out and it is actually we can do when we still work,

1775
01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:10.880
but we can do two a week.

1776
01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:15.770
We've tried to do that as often as we can to a week and um,
yeah,

1777
01:44:15.771 --> 01:44:18.550
I mean we do it all.
We have a little like a room that has the,

1778
01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:22.700
the board and Mike's and uh,
cameras that aren't hooked up yet.
That's good.

1779
01:44:22.770 --> 01:44:27.340
Is it working or like a team to do it because it works for schedules.

1780
01:44:27.341 --> 01:44:30.480
If we're both home for like 48 hours,
we can,
we can,

1781
01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:36.340
it's easier to walk to our second room than to try to schedule something so

1782
01:44:36.411 --> 01:44:38.300
that,
that part was true.
It works out.

1783
01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:42.350
Your podcast is one of the very few that actually is a husband and wife that's

1784
01:44:42.351 --> 01:44:45.980
actually listened bubble I that formula.
It never really works for me.

1785
01:44:45.981 --> 01:44:48.380
There's a couple here and there that kind of are okay,

1786
01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:51.500
but for the most part when I hear that a husband and wife,

1787
01:44:51.501 --> 01:44:55.640
I just want to fucking shoot myself.
It is true.
That's a good point.

1788
01:44:55.641 --> 01:45:00.410
That's nice of you because you're very comfortable people.
You're very fun

1789
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:08.680
because it's like listening to a couple.
It's not like where you guys,
uh,
you're,

1790
01:45:08.681 --> 01:45:12.530
you're a couple but you,
you don't fucking like PDA ourselves,

1791
01:45:13.050 --> 01:45:17.090
so you're cool.
You're both cool.
You actually are really good friends.
You know,

1792
01:45:17.091 --> 01:45:19.300
there's a lot of people that the only reason why they're together,

1793
01:45:19.301 --> 01:45:20.390
it's just weird male,

1794
01:45:20.391 --> 01:45:24.620
female sort of thing going on where they have nothing in common right now seem

1795
01:45:24.621 --> 01:45:26.690
to talk about.
The conversations are all stunted.

1796
01:45:26.970 --> 01:45:29.790
You guys are like clearly obviously like,
I wish I had that.

1797
01:45:31.390 --> 01:45:34.580
I think about that a lot when you know,
not to sound Corny,

1798
01:45:34.581 --> 01:45:36.980
but if he and I go to dinner and there's that table next to you that's

1799
01:45:36.981 --> 01:45:38.060
completely silent,

1800
01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:44.870
why don't you marry somebody you can't fucking talk to him cause this all goes

1801
01:45:44.871 --> 01:45:48.860
the looks and your body turns to dog shit and all you have at the end of the day

1802
01:45:48.861 --> 01:45:53.850
is a mind with another mind.
Right?
That you liked talking to him.

1803
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:57.190
Yeah.
You got to pick someone that always blew me away when the,

1804
01:45:57.220 --> 01:46:01.220
when the front like a lot of guy friends that have wood date for a long time and

1805
01:46:01.221 --> 01:46:05.380
or marry somebody that they didn't have like good converse,

1806
01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:09.500
like intellectually stimulating conversation and you're like you fucking talk to

1807
01:46:09.501 --> 01:46:12.890
that adult all the time.
Well they don't care.

1808
01:46:14.210 --> 01:46:16.230
That's where I'll get my pussy.
Okay Great.

1809
01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:18.140
Take care of the kids and now I go to work.

1810
01:46:18.650 --> 01:46:22.060
There's a lot of people that just take that your whole,

1811
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:25.610
I've had friends that were in horrible relationships and then all sudden they'll

1812
01:46:25.611 --> 01:46:28.040
come and tell you that they're thinking about proposing,

1813
01:46:28.041 --> 01:46:32.300
like she stuck around fix just by a pet instead.

1814
01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:35.860
Yeah,
yeah,
you're right.
You're right.
Yeah.

1815
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:38.600
Especially the ones that are fucking at each other's throats.
And he's like,

1816
01:46:38.601 --> 01:46:39.021
no man.

1817
01:46:39.021 --> 01:46:42.200
I'm just thinking maybe if we just weren't on a different level of commitment,

1818
01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:44.450
like maybe this wouldn't be,
what are you talking about?

1819
01:46:44.780 --> 01:46:46.510
She's a crazy bitch and you're crazy for me.

1820
01:46:46.511 --> 01:46:49.090
Whether you crazy asshole or crazy ass hole.

1821
01:46:50.610 --> 01:46:53.550
<v 2>And there's a lot of what the reason why people do that.</v>

1822
01:46:53.551 --> 01:46:57.240
People like to get absorbed in relationships to distract them from the shitbag

1823
01:46:57.270 --> 01:46:58.980
lives.
Absolutely love it.

1824
01:46:59.010 --> 01:47:01.980
They love doing it or distract them from their real issues.

1825
01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:04.200
You don't have to address the real,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1826
01:47:04.201 --> 01:47:07.920
If you're over eating or over smoking or you over this year over the battery,

1827
01:47:07.921 --> 01:47:11.180
over gambling or over masturbating,
whatever the fuck it is.
Yeah.
You know,

1828
01:47:11.190 --> 01:47:12.300
and just fucking,

1829
01:47:12.330 --> 01:47:14.900
you'll be in the middle of it and texting with folklore or you hook them.

1830
01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:19.740
You to me back
I show is also,

1831
01:47:19.741 --> 01:47:21.780
you know,
the thing is we have a profile.
I mean,

1832
01:47:21.781 --> 01:47:24.120
you know this better than anybody,
Brian Ha that it's uh,

1833
01:47:24.510 --> 01:47:26.160
it was like a profoundly silly show.

1834
01:47:27.870 --> 01:47:30.150
It's so silly and we have a similar sensibility.

1835
01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:33.690
So like it probably wouldn't work if like the shit that made me laugh,

1836
01:47:34.050 --> 01:47:37.170
it didn't make her laugh or vice.
Right,
right.
We're able to,

1837
01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:41.490
one of my favorite talk about that you guys did lately as far as just totally

1838
01:47:41.491 --> 01:47:45.430
interrupted you.
Go ahead.
I was your dad.
Yeah.

1839
01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:50.840
Where he wiped a booger on an elevator and just,

1840
01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:57.240
it was great.
Oh,
that's so nasty.

1841
01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:00.540
Top Dog.
That's what happens when I got,

1842
01:48:00.541 --> 01:48:05.541
doesn't give a fuck about [inaudible].

1843
01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:10.140
He also,
it's been one of those,
you know,

1844
01:48:10.141 --> 01:48:13.590
like Dads have their dad bits like there,
you know what I mean?

1845
01:48:13.591 --> 01:48:17.370
Like one of his bits.
Boogers.
No,
it's like talking about it.
Like it's a,

1846
01:48:17.371 --> 01:48:20.910
it's a like it's one of his bits for as long as I can remember.

1847
01:48:20.911 --> 01:48:24.240
It's been like you get an elevator with them.
People say that not,

1848
01:48:24.241 --> 01:48:27.920
do you know what I like to do?
I like to put a booger on the elephant,

1849
01:48:27.930 --> 01:48:29.300
the lobby button because,

1850
01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:32.400
and then I know everybody's touching it but he doesn't do it.

1851
01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:36.900
We got an elevator and the first time in my whole life he goes,
hey,
watch this.

1852
01:48:37.030 --> 01:48:40.770
And he goes up,
he digs,
went out and I was like,
what the fuck?

1853
01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:43.170
And I looked at him like that and he was like,
oh sorry buddy.

1854
01:48:46.590 --> 01:48:48.320
Sorry Buddy.
Yeah,

1855
01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:54.880
he has audio of him telling their mom what the dad did and the mom just like,

1856
01:48:56.610 --> 01:48:58.020
that's like normal for her.

1857
01:48:58.021 --> 01:49:02.440
It's like she's always just seems like such a nice broken,

1858
01:49:04.570 --> 01:49:06.030
she has zero tolerance,

1859
01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:11.360
zero zero for like a lack of class at anything grows like gross shit does not

1860
01:49:12.571 --> 01:49:13.290
make her laugh.

1861
01:49:13.290 --> 01:49:18.290
So I like to tell her gross shit to hear her because she gets so upset about it.

1862
01:49:18.970 --> 01:49:22.800
I can't even bear to hear it.
And it just brings me to tears.

1863
01:49:23.670 --> 01:49:28.330
The whole show is me just like crying,
laughing at a lot.

1864
01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:32.690
You like you're his family water than yours.
Yeah,

1865
01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:38.460
that's great.
Like his sister will yell from the room

1866
01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:48.010
but in

1867
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:51.270
<v 1>mind either,
by the way,
going to fucking do with that at all.
Um,</v>

1868
01:49:51.670 --> 01:49:55.440
but we've been talking a lot lately about our neighbor.
Yeah.

1869
01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:59.680
Maybe you can help us.
Okay.
No roosters.
Nope,

1870
01:50:00.130 --> 01:50:03.220
there's no work's different neighborhood.
So now,
all right.

1871
01:50:03.250 --> 01:50:07.240
So what happened was we rented a place that there's,
there's our place,

1872
01:50:07.241 --> 01:50:09.810
which is a two bedroom and then,
uh,

1873
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:13.030
the owner owns the unit next to it,

1874
01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:18.070
but doesn't live there and like lives in La in a different part of town and
goes,

1875
01:50:18.071 --> 01:50:21.160
well yeah,
that's my unit for like,
um,

1876
01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:26.020
like once a year I have family come in for like a week and then sometimes like

1877
01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:29.860
maybe once a year I'll stay there if I'm doing business on this side of town.

1878
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:33.490
Right.
I'm crashed somewhere or some shit like that.
And so that was,

1879
01:50:33.491 --> 01:50:35.710
I mean it wasn't like part of the deal,
but it was,
she was just like,

1880
01:50:35.711 --> 01:50:38.410
that's just what it is.
Right.
So we're like,
all right.

1881
01:50:38.650 --> 01:50:40.360
So it was Kinda nice cause you have no neighbor,

1882
01:50:40.361 --> 01:50:41.980
we don't even know what it's like to have that neighbor.

1883
01:50:42.370 --> 01:50:45.700
And then like in the fall,
one day I'm,

1884
01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:48.590
I'm in our second room,
which has a,

1885
01:50:48.890 --> 01:50:53.770
a connection like event and I feel heat coming in and I'm like,
ah,
shit,

1886
01:50:53.771 --> 01:50:55.450
that's from the other unit.
And I go,

1887
01:50:55.451 --> 01:50:59.500
it's weird that there's heat coming from the unit next door.
Right.

1888
01:50:59.501 --> 01:51:04.300
Cause blowing into our unit.
So I go and I knock and then it's this,
uh,
ladies,

1889
01:51:04.301 --> 01:51:05.740
like I'm like,
oh who are you?
And she's like,

1890
01:51:05.770 --> 01:51:09.850
oh I just moved in here and I was like,
you moved in?
She was like,
yeah,

1891
01:51:10.270 --> 01:51:11.670
I go like permanently.
She's like,
Nah,

1892
01:51:11.671 --> 01:51:15.110
I'm just going to be like looking for a place.
Um,
but you know,

1893
01:51:15.130 --> 01:51:17.860
I'm staying here cause I'm friends with the owners.
And I was like,
Oh okay.

1894
01:51:17.861 --> 01:51:19.080
I was like,
how long you think you're gonna stay?

1895
01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:23.350
She was like probably for awhile.
It was like great,
like how long?
She was like,

1896
01:51:23.351 --> 01:51:27.740
this is probably for a long time.
I was like fuck.
And then she asked,

1897
01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:30.350
asked if she could park in our driveway and all that shit.

1898
01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:34.690
She could use our Internet connection.
This is on the first meeting like,

1899
01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:38.500
Whoa,
can I use your internet?
Yeah.
She was like,

1900
01:51:38.510 --> 01:51:40.840
you need to get your password and I could throw it like a few bucks.
I was like,

1901
01:51:41.890 --> 01:51:45.860
Whoa,
that's not going to work.
What did she say?
And she was like,
okay.

1902
01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:47.920
And I was like,
yes,
that is not going to work.
She's like,

1903
01:51:47.921 --> 01:51:51.700
you think I could park in the driveway behind your car and I'll leave like my

1904
01:51:51.701 --> 01:51:56.140
phone number like on a card car and then whenever you fucking serious so she can

1905
01:51:56.141 --> 01:51:59.290
lock us with her shitty car.
She sounds like a hippie.
Yeah,

1906
01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:03.790
that sounds like that's exactly the type of mentality that I had to deal with a

1907
01:52:03.791 --> 01:52:08.070
lot in boulder.
You really always need this.
Always need.

1908
01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:10.300
Can I get that from you man?
I wouldn't think.

1909
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:12.430
I mean I've been broke as shit and I borrowed,

1910
01:52:12.431 --> 01:52:14.530
we ever had on had the balls to be like,

1911
01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:16.550
you think I could tap into your Internet management?
Yeah.

1912
01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:20.440
There's some shameless hippies.
Yeah,
no you can't do that.

1913
01:52:21.130 --> 01:52:24.820
And so now help me man.
You know who knows what the fuck they're doing?

1914
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:30.030
Downloaded some fucking terrorist handbook that gets on your Ip and a fucking

1915
01:52:30.551 --> 01:52:33.370
police come and break down your door and you've got to prove that this asshole

1916
01:52:33.371 --> 01:52:35.920
was the one that was downloading the shit.
Absolutely.

1917
01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:39.460
So now that you have to really worry about that too,
you start to hear her,

1918
01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:43.090
why we,
we're hearing her and then just in general,

1919
01:52:43.870 --> 01:52:45.920
it's a smelling,
smelling dirty food.

1920
01:52:45.921 --> 01:52:49.640
You smell her shit food and you're like fucking,
I don't know.

1921
01:52:49.641 --> 01:52:53.150
Oniony something in the morning and I don't even like to eat in the morning.

1922
01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:57.750
So yeah,
it smell like beefy on uni.
Shit was great.

1923
01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:01.640
Sounds like inspirational.
Yeah.

1924
01:53:01.850 --> 01:53:06.410
And then the capper is in the middle of the night,
like at two in the morning.

1925
01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:08.790
Later.
Yeah.
Later then yeah.
You here

1926
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:12.500
just in groups of threes,

1927
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:13.783
<v 7>Huh?</v>

1928
01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:18.590
<v 1>Which is getting nailed.
Yes.
She is not even like a late night fucking,</v>

1929
01:53:18.591 --> 01:53:21.190
it's like a four in the morning.
Could yeah.
Yeah.

1930
01:53:22.030 --> 01:53:23.990
Sounds like she knows a guy like me

1931
01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:30.730
even at Dixon and listening to it.
You're the morning guy.
No,
no.

1932
01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:34.190
It's crazy being silly.
When I was 20,
I was,
yeah,

1933
01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:38.180
whenever you can get in four in the morning,
she answers her phone.

1934
01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:41.270
Has Christina been gone once and you started hearing her and have sex and you

1935
01:53:41.271 --> 01:53:44.930
start masturbating with your ear to the wall?
No,
actually.
Have you ever done it?

1936
01:53:44.990 --> 01:53:48.130
No.
I've done that in hotel hotels.
Yeah.
But um,

1937
01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:53.650
when you're home and you have that much resentment built up,
I don't think,
yeah.

1938
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:56.870
You know this dot coming

1939
01:54:02.660 --> 01:54:04.140
to that don't have a sample that

1940
01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:08.000
we try to give it back.

1941
01:54:08.020 --> 01:54:10.840
Have you ever dated a girl that was so loud you wanted her to shut the fuck up?

1942
01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:14.030
You're like,
you're distracting the shit out of me.
Do you ever had a yeah,

1943
01:54:14.750 --> 01:54:17.600
I've had a loud but I don't think about like so distracting.

1944
01:54:17.630 --> 01:54:21.290
I love hearing this stuff.
I want you do you well?
Yeah.
Cause I went on,

1945
01:54:21.291 --> 01:54:25.190
I never asked him that question.
So yeah,
there was many,

1946
01:54:25.191 --> 01:54:29.090
many years in the past.
I was probably like my early twenties.

1947
01:54:29.450 --> 01:54:34.450
There was this girl that I dated for a very short period of time who would,

1948
01:54:34.730 --> 01:54:36.290
you know,
she would come to visit me.

1949
01:54:36.291 --> 01:54:39.530
Like if I was on the road doing stand up and uh,
you know,

1950
01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:42.860
and back then it was like always the shittiest cheapest motel is the fucking

1951
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:44.390
nastiest beds.

1952
01:54:44.670 --> 01:54:46.790
When you think about some of the places that you've stayed when you're working

1953
01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:51.540
in the row.
Oh,
right.
How were alive Carlos?
This checkup,
like,

1954
01:54:51.890 --> 01:54:55.930
oh fuck.
It was,

1955
01:54:56.290 --> 01:55:00.730
it would be so ridiculous and so over the top and be like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa,

1956
01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:04.520
Whoa,
whoa.
And it was always,
and it was just,

1957
01:55:04.700 --> 01:55:06.920
she was just like ready to ramp it up.

1958
01:55:06.921 --> 01:55:09.280
The moment you stuck it in the moment you start going out.
Yeah.

1959
01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:14.420
She didn't even build to it.
It was like she was lap the overkill.
Ah,

1960
01:55:14.421 --> 01:55:18.150
there you go.
Crazy Latin bitch.
She would go off like a bottle rocket.

1961
01:55:20.170 --> 01:55:23.180
The moment you staycations just start screaming,

1962
01:55:25.230 --> 01:55:29.960
hey,
hey,
hey,
this is so theatrical.
Yeah.
Did you believe it?

1963
01:55:29.961 --> 01:55:34.961
Like fucking 22 years old or whatever the hell that was definitely 22 and she

1964
01:55:36.201 --> 01:55:39.260
was the worst one and in all my history can I can just get a little,

1965
01:55:39.261 --> 01:55:41.660
it was like pleases you got to stop.
I was like trying to be polite.

1966
01:55:41.661 --> 01:55:44.010
Like there's other people that are staying here.
This is late at night.

1967
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:45.330
Like this is a small hotel.

1968
01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:50.100
Well this was fascinating.
He said,

1969
01:55:50.101 --> 01:55:53.970
I read recently that one of the things they say about a woman who was moaning

1970
01:55:53.971 --> 01:55:58.971
and screaming really loudly during sex is that it's not exactly just pleasure

1971
01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:04.440
and that actually what she's doing and she's alerting other men that may be

1972
01:56:04.441 --> 01:56:08.430
better suitors to come and fuck her.

1973
01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:17.370
No one's going to hear outside this house.

1974
01:56:19.940 --> 01:56:22.750
So that's an interesting little,

1975
01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:26.860
a little a possibility they could make it better.

1976
01:56:26.930 --> 01:56:30.680
Make you really think about the screamers now what makes sense?
You know,

1977
01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:33.440
I mean it totally makes sense.
Like if you weren't,
if you're,

1978
01:56:33.490 --> 01:56:35.880
I guess if you're more secure in the relationship as well,

1979
01:56:36.090 --> 01:56:38.680
you also have calmed down.
You probably did.

1980
01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:42.030
The sex isn't quite as crazy cause you're doing it all the time.

1981
01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:44.790
You used to each other.
You can still have good sex for a long period of time,

1982
01:56:44.791 --> 01:56:47.960
but you've got to have some marijuana or some why salt.

1983
01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:54.120
Yeah,
that's great.
Oh of that.

1984
01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:57.290
But like hanging out with some Puerto Ricans for a week.
Right.

1985
01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:03.100
Crazy.
Screaming like that.

1986
01:57:10.060 --> 01:57:11.320
You never know.

1987
01:57:11.900 --> 01:57:15.840
You never know if it's real and they're taking a big chance and going that hard.

1988
01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:27.630
Does that put you off?
Have you ever had someone say

1989
01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:33.110
fucker can't really isn't a cons.

1990
01:57:33.810 --> 01:57:36.090
What is it that slit that Gash?

1991
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:39.690
She was completely crazy though.
She,

1992
01:57:39.691 --> 01:57:43.890
this is where it's good to have good friends because she came to a comedy club

1993
01:57:43.891 --> 01:57:47.270
to see me and they'll also,
my friends came and my friends were with,
you know,

1994
01:57:47.271 --> 01:57:47.640
like I,

1995
01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:52.260
I brought her over to them and she gave my friend or number and then she goes to

1996
01:57:52.261 --> 01:57:53.980
the bathroom.
My friend calls it.
Oh man,
that girl.

1997
01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.910
Just gave me her fucking phone number.
Wow.
I'm like,
wow,

1998
01:57:56.911 --> 01:57:59.970
you crazy hooker like she was,
she was so crazy.

1999
01:57:59.971 --> 01:58:04.290
She was willing to take one of my friends and just give him and hope that she

2000
01:58:04.291 --> 01:58:06.720
could sneak away and it just started banging everybody that I know.

2001
01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:07.960
Like on the sneak tip,

2002
01:58:10.410 --> 01:58:13.180
there's some tardy girls out there.
There's some dirty girls.

2003
01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:19.830
I mean,
this girl I fucked the first time I met her,
she was completely insane.

2004
01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:23.250
What the girl,
this girl was incredible.
She was insane.

2005
01:58:23.850 --> 01:58:27.210
I was 21 I was 21 and she was completely crazy,

2006
01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:30.270
but I didn't realize how crazy she was until she gave up the phone number to my

2007
01:58:30.271 --> 01:58:33.180
friend and then not really.
She would just do that to anybody.
She could.

2008
01:58:34.150 --> 01:58:37.320
You could just all here still strapped for that or no.
Oh God no.
That was,
yeah,

2009
01:58:37.321 --> 01:58:39.870
I noticed that.
Yeah.
I got to get rid of her.
Yeah,
she was too creepy.

2010
01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:42.160
It was just like,
it's not just doing

2011
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:45.600
<v 0>that.
It's like the idea that like they're sneaking around behind your back and</v>

2012
01:58:45.770 --> 01:58:49.420
that's,
it's a weird side and that's why it's good to have good friends.

2013
01:58:49.450 --> 01:58:52.720
Cause my friend came out to me right away and say,
Yo Dude,
that fucking bitch,

2014
01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:53.620
you know when you're in the bathroom,

2015
01:58:53.621 --> 01:58:56.500
that bitch gave me her number and he shows it to me and he hands it to me.

2016
01:58:56.950 --> 01:59:00.350
I'm like,
wow.
Like you wouldn't tell you though,
right?
Some guys wouldn't.

2017
01:59:00.570 --> 01:59:02.350
There's guys wouldn't.
Yeah,
I had a friend,

2018
01:59:02.530 --> 01:59:05.380
we had a real problem with them cause he was always banging all of our friends,

2019
01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:08.560
uh,
ex ex girlfriends,
he would immediately,
it was back in Boston.

2020
01:59:08.561 --> 01:59:10.060
It was immediately as soon as you would break up,

2021
01:59:10.061 --> 01:59:12.860
he would fucking immediately be just magically you.

2022
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:14.380
I think it was by her work the other day.

2023
01:59:14.381 --> 01:59:17.110
She seems like she's taking the break up.
Well what do you mean?

2024
01:59:17.111 --> 01:59:18.490
She seems like she's taking the big up.
Well,

2025
01:59:18.491 --> 01:59:20.440
what the fuck are you talking to her for?
Hey man,

2026
01:59:20.441 --> 01:59:23.540
you know Shane Snow Bird game and she's well on the market now.
Like what?

2027
01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:28.240
Like you,
you're moving in.
You're my friend.
She happens to me.
It was,

2028
01:59:28.241 --> 01:59:31.480
this was a bad one though.
This was a,
my friend Jimmy and Kevin.

2029
01:59:31.481 --> 01:59:33.910
I don't want to say last name.
See the fucking names have been changed.

2030
01:59:34.210 --> 01:59:37.060
Save the innocent.
They stopped being buddies because of that.
Of course.

2031
01:59:37.061 --> 01:59:39.240
It's just going to keep hitting buttons after that.
That's not cool.

2032
01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:42.670
Can't trust that dude.
That's interest.
Creepy.
Can't trust it.

2033
01:59:45.190 --> 01:59:49.840
So where are you guys at next?
What's,
what's next?
Chicago.

2034
01:59:50.350 --> 01:59:54.940
The 19th through 22nd Schaumburg.
Oh,
you're doing that Improv.

2035
01:59:54.941 --> 01:59:59.540
That's a great,
celebrating my 40th birthday there.
That's a great place.
Yeah,

2036
01:59:59.770 --> 02:00:04.040
it's a good club.
There's not really that much in Chicago.
It's hard to find.
Uh,

2037
02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:06.780
you know,
there's xannies in Chicago and then there's a,

2038
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:09.130
there's the Zinis in Vernon hills,
right?
Isn't there?

2039
02:00:09.190 --> 02:00:13.060
One last thing I heard a new one just opened up.

2040
02:00:13.570 --> 02:00:17.980
Chicago used to have a great comedy scene.
I remember.
Yeah.
That's a second city,

2041
02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:21.850
right?
Home base.
Second city.
Yeah.
It's a good comedy town.
Yeah.

2042
02:00:21.851 --> 02:00:23.860
There was a few guys wasn't there.
One of the,
one,

2043
02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:28.510
one of the guys from the Rodney Dangerfield special.
He gave he uh,

2044
02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:32.980
he got on um,
one of the Rodney specials and he was a Chicago guy.
Really?

2045
02:00:33.010 --> 02:00:36.640
I don't know.
I'm trying to remember.
He know he was,
he would like,

2046
02:00:36.670 --> 02:00:40.280
it would say something and say that that's a tip from your uncle Earl.

2047
02:00:40.930 --> 02:00:45.770
Or like a little catch phrase.
Forget his fucking name though.
God dammit.

2048
02:00:45.940 --> 02:00:49.420
I'm sure someone on Twitter will alert me to this.
I feel like they always do.

2049
02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:52.780
Twitter is the best for that.
It is.
They told me the Matthew Connor.

2050
02:00:52.781 --> 02:00:54.460
Hey wasn't that dragon movie?
I was right.

2051
02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:56.880
Even though I couldn't imagine it being in that drawing and moving and he had
it,

2052
02:00:56.881 --> 02:00:59.800
but I remember he was like a bad ass.
He had fucking tribal tattoos and shit.

2053
02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:02.890
It was a dragon.
Jacker yeah,

2054
02:01:04.750 --> 02:01:09.310
I'm a,
I'm going to Vancouver this week.
Ooh,
I'm mix.
Oh,
that place is awesome.

2055
02:01:09.370 --> 02:01:10.440
So this,
uh,

2056
02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:13.950
Thursday through Saturday when you're working with local guys up there.
Yup.
Yup.

2057
02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:16.660
How often do you guys work on your own together rather together?

2058
02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:19.960
It seems like you should be able to put something together because of your

2059
02:01:19.961 --> 02:01:24.100
podcasts.
We've done it.
We just did a,
we did Ontario last month.

2060
02:01:24.580 --> 02:01:28.450
That was great.
That was a good deal.
Probably out there for a weekend.
Fantastic.

2061
02:01:29.050 --> 02:01:31.000
So yeah,
we would probably do some more.
We're actually,

2062
02:01:31.001 --> 02:01:36.001
we're doing the podcast live for the first time at a club at the John Lovitz

2063
02:01:36.020 --> 02:01:40.790
club.
May 23rd.
Yeah,
I've done,
um,
I've done a couple of live,

2064
02:01:40.820 --> 02:01:42.090
it's a,
it's a weird dynamic.

2065
02:01:42.091 --> 02:01:44.310
Do you feel like you have to get to the jokes real quick?
Yeah.

2066
02:01:44.311 --> 02:01:45.530
She was looking at large audience,

2067
02:01:45.650 --> 02:01:47.610
like if we were doing this in front of a large audience to,

2068
02:01:47.611 --> 02:01:51.760
it'd be boring as fuck.
I don't know.
It'd be weird,
right?
This is good man.

2069
02:01:51.780 --> 02:01:54.680
Senior year when you at the gym or it's good when you're on the,
on the road,

2070
02:01:54.681 --> 02:01:57.620
but I don't know if this is like live audience fogger I would feel like I have

2071
02:01:57.621 --> 02:02:01.040
to do stand up,
you know?
I don't know.
I mean the first time,

2072
02:02:01.041 --> 02:02:03.920
so hopefully we get a good turnout.
We could have,
you know,

2073
02:02:04.110 --> 02:02:08.870
we'll stick to I think a limited time.
To me,
I wasn't a fan of the live one.

2074
02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:13.520
It just seemed like we were almost trying to put on a half fake conversation

2075
02:02:13.521 --> 02:02:17.150
just to be more entertaining for lot of people looking at us.
Yeah,
I agree.
Yeah.

2076
02:02:17.151 --> 02:02:18.530
Well we did it with Jimmy Norton,

2077
02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:22.130
which was fun because Jimmy was just fell right into it perfectly and was

2078
02:02:22.220 --> 02:02:24.700
killing.
He was really funny and you know,

2079
02:02:24.710 --> 02:02:27.740
on purpose funny and really going for the joke.
But yeah,

2080
02:02:27.741 --> 02:02:32.330
it became almost like stand up.
Yeah.
It gets weird.
It does get weird.
Yeah.

2081
02:02:32.450 --> 02:02:35.810
It's not this,
this weird sort of intimate conversation and different,

2082
02:02:35.940 --> 02:02:39.650
it's totally different town.
Do you guys have a lot of people from your,
um,

2083
02:02:39.740 --> 02:02:41.810
that listen to your podcasts that are coming into your shows?

2084
02:02:44.150 --> 02:02:48.020
We talk about how much we like so awesome when,
because sometimes you know,

2085
02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:50.300
like sometimes obviously they have no idea who you are.

2086
02:02:50.570 --> 02:02:53.990
Sometimes they've seen you do standup on TV.
You're like,
oh,
I saw your,
you know,

2087
02:02:53.991 --> 02:02:58.130
your special or I saw you on Conan or whatever.
So it was something and then,

2088
02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:01.440
but then it was something different about,
they're like,
um,
they,

2089
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:05.690
they say I'm a mommy to us,
you know,
we're like,
I love the podcast.
That's fun.

2090
02:03:05.691 --> 02:03:08.840
And then it,
you just feel like,
oh,
this person actually knows me.
Yeah.

2091
02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:14.780
That's super cool.
Yeah.
Call her on board.
I can talk about Dolphin fucking yeah,

2092
02:03:17.570 --> 02:03:22.130
it's way more fun.
Yeah,
it's,
it's way cooler.
We're done.

2093
02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:25.670
And I'm doing a,
Oh,
I just added a Peoria for next week.

2094
02:03:25.671 --> 02:03:28.590
So if anybody's in Peoria,
Illinois,
I'm doing the Jukebox,

2095
02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.400
we need to create a website,
Brian.

2096
02:03:32.020 --> 02:03:36.080
But eventually what we need to do is incorporate all of us in all of our

2097
02:03:36.081 --> 02:03:40.820
podcasts into one website where there's like tiles.
You know what I mean?

2098
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:45.320
Like everybody that works sort of affiliated with like Dunkin and Joey and you

2099
02:03:45.321 --> 02:03:47.930
guys and are there really should be one,

2100
02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:50.900
just make it one of your links on your website.
It's,
yeah,
but it would,

2101
02:03:50.901 --> 02:03:55.170
wouldn't it be cool if there was like one portal,
you know,
where we could all,

2102
02:03:56.220 --> 02:03:58.950
no,
no,
no.
Just the ones that were all friends with,
you know,

2103
02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:01.780
people could like listen to click and listen or they could see where you're at

2104
02:04:01.790 --> 02:04:02.541
and have it.

2105
02:04:02.541 --> 02:04:06.830
I mean that would be like the best way to really get a gang of people to come to

2106
02:04:06.831 --> 02:04:11.210
all of our podcasts is to have like a portal,
you know,
or Ari's podcasts,

2107
02:04:11.420 --> 02:04:14.450
Dunkin's podcasts and each one has like a little square,

2108
02:04:16.410 --> 02:04:17.810
you'd know,
you know,

2109
02:04:17.811 --> 02:04:22.610
it already subscribed and then was going to think about it,
you know?

2110
02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:23.271
Well,
no,

2111
02:04:23.271 --> 02:04:26.750
not necessarily because we don't really talk about Dunkin's podcast that much,

2112
02:04:26.780 --> 02:04:27.830
nor do we talk about ours.

2113
02:04:27.930 --> 02:04:31.400
Like you can miss several podcasts in a row where we didn't talk about it,

2114
02:04:31.401 --> 02:04:32.570
you wouldn't even know it existed.

2115
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:35.840
But if it was all clearly laid out and we had like a,
a website,

2116
02:04:35.841 --> 02:04:38.130
whether it was tiles and you know,

2117
02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:43.140
and that way that would be a real way of everybody promoting everybody with,

2118
02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:46.170
you know,
no intention other than keeping like,
you know what I mean?

2119
02:04:46.171 --> 02:04:47.760
There's no financial intentions at all.

2120
02:04:47.761 --> 02:04:52.320
It's all just about keeping this one group connected and helping people.

2121
02:04:52.321 --> 02:04:56.700
It's good idea.
Right.
Awesome.
Yeah,
we should totally do that.
If you like Ari,

2122
02:04:56.701 --> 02:05:01.410
you're probably will like us or edited.
It'll pump everybody up.
Yeah,
that's,

2123
02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:05.040
that's what we need to do next.
That's the next step.
That's the next level.

2124
02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:07.590
We need to have like a podcast community,
you know,

2125
02:05:07.591 --> 02:05:11.160
of all podcasts that we appreciate and like share their,
you know,

2126
02:05:11.161 --> 02:05:14.150
like the idea of a channel like like death squad.
Like that's,

2127
02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:15.450
that's one way to do it too.

2128
02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:19.170
But also the way to do it is to just make sure that everybody is connected to

2129
02:05:19.171 --> 02:05:24.171
like minded folks or other cool people are the ones that you might think are

2130
02:05:24.241 --> 02:05:26.490
interesting and,
and then then you know,

2131
02:05:26.850 --> 02:05:30.690
have it all like a one stop shop where they know if they go to this,

2132
02:05:30.691 --> 02:05:32.460
this is all the people that are cool with each other.

2133
02:05:32.461 --> 02:05:34.810
The soil got a whole group of people that are all friends with each other.

2134
02:05:34.850 --> 02:05:36.380
Like each other.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2135
02:05:36.570 --> 02:05:39.030
Well you're getting your website redesign is to make it a link page on that.

2136
02:05:39.050 --> 02:05:41.190
Yeah.
I think I'm going to do something along those lines.

2137
02:05:41.190 --> 02:05:45.690
I'm also going to make a website specifically designed for the podcast.

2138
02:05:45.691 --> 02:05:48.450
So there'll be two websites and be like my regular website and then they'll be a

2139
02:05:48.451 --> 02:05:52.740
podcast specifically designed podcast network or a website rather.

2140
02:05:52.741 --> 02:05:55.860
And that's where I think we need to come up with some sort of a link to a

2141
02:05:55.861 --> 02:05:59.400
network and maybe we all put the link on our site and then that link will go to

2142
02:05:59.401 --> 02:06:02.560
one website.
Why are you doing so many web websites?

2143
02:06:02.860 --> 02:06:04.310
So why are you breaking it up?
Yeah,

2144
02:06:04.650 --> 02:06:08.040
well it's not really broken up will be a section on my website.

2145
02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:12.150
But if you go to it and it'll go to one that like when you go to that section,

2146
02:06:12.151 --> 02:06:15.510
it'll be laid out like a whole site just for the podcast.

2147
02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:19.380
Each one will have a description of each podcast and who was the guest and how

2148
02:06:19.381 --> 02:06:23.100
long it was and when it took place.
Do you,
so do you know what percent is there?

2149
02:06:23.101 --> 02:06:27.630
Even like it's gotta be a small percentage of your fans that come to shows that

2150
02:06:27.631 --> 02:06:31.540
don't listen to the podcast.
It's almost nonexistent now.

2151
02:06:32.340 --> 02:06:36.750
We were in Chicago.
Chicago was giant fucking theater sold out.
And I go,

2152
02:06:36.751 --> 02:06:39.510
how many guys listen to the podcast?
They went,
fucking ape shit.

2153
02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:42.810
They went ape shit.
It was crazy.
It was beautiful.

2154
02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:46.950
One of the coolest crowds I've ever had in my entire time of doing standup.

2155
02:06:47.190 --> 02:06:49.560
It's never been cooling now.
It was cool man.
You know?

2156
02:06:49.561 --> 02:06:51.150
And even if only one person's crazy,

2157
02:06:51.151 --> 02:06:54.120
it's like we just get rid of them real quick and then it becomes entertaining.

2158
02:06:54.121 --> 02:06:56.910
You know,
this crowd has been amazing.
It started when,
I think when I,

2159
02:06:57.090 --> 02:07:00.050
when I did Ann Arbor with you a few years ago.
Yeah,
I,

2160
02:07:00.090 --> 02:07:05.090
that was before we had a podcast and I'd done yours a few times and you were,

2161
02:07:06.180 --> 02:07:08.550
you were asking me like how many guys listen to the podcast?

2162
02:07:08.580 --> 02:07:12.600
And in my mind it was gonna be like three tables,
right?
That's what I thought.

2163
02:07:12.601 --> 02:07:16.050
I'd be like,
oh,
these are all fans,
but does they don't listen to the podcast.

2164
02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:19.290
I thought it'd be like,
oh,
that's that fringe element to it.

2165
02:07:19.730 --> 02:07:24.330
And that fucking club went bananas.
Not only that,
then you ask like,

2166
02:07:24.331 --> 02:07:28.920
who here knows Joey Diaz and fucking dude people in Florida,

2167
02:07:28.921 --> 02:07:33.760
we're calling out for me to tell Joey Diaz stories.
So crazy.
Yeah.
He's so,

2168
02:07:33.950 --> 02:07:35.490
he's so lovable.
Yeah.

2169
02:07:35.770 --> 02:07:40.090
He's such a lovable human cartoon type thing and just so lucky to have in your

2170
02:07:40.091 --> 02:07:42.790
life,
you know,
it's such a fun guy to be around.
We have them.

2171
02:07:42.791 --> 02:07:46.630
We're having them on next week.
Oh,
that's awesome.
Yeah.
But yeah,
you right there.

2172
02:07:46.631 --> 02:07:49.990
That was when the podcast first started to kick in and I was like somewhere,

2173
02:07:50.050 --> 02:07:52.480
whoops.
That was somewhere around two years ago.
Right,
right.

2174
02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:54.790
Was right after we had started that.
But there's,

2175
02:07:54.910 --> 02:07:59.860
I just bumped myself in the face.
What the fuck am I feel
so stupid.

2176
02:08:00.530 --> 02:08:04.450
But um,
um,
that was,
uh,
yeah,
that was that,
that was definitely the beginning.

2177
02:08:04.451 --> 02:08:07.600
But now it's like complete the transformation,
the crowds.

2178
02:08:07.780 --> 02:08:12.600
I for your factor crowds,
the vogue theater with you in Vancouver and places.

2179
02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:16.600
The guy was like,
there was more tickets like that.
We sold for this.

2180
02:08:16.601 --> 02:08:21.250
Then even any music venue show ever,
and they pack that place.
That was nuts.

2181
02:08:21.310 --> 02:08:25.510
It was really fun.
It's really fun.
Yeah.
Um,
it's,
it's like,

2182
02:08:25.511 --> 02:08:28.240
it's definitely different now.
The shows are,
they're way different,

2183
02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:29.530
but it's also a,

2184
02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:33.280
I feel like more of a responsibility to like really produce good shit too.

2185
02:08:33.460 --> 02:08:33.761
You know?

2186
02:08:33.761 --> 02:08:37.090
I really feel like these aren't just people that are coming to see the shell.

2187
02:08:37.090 --> 02:08:39.340
Like I,
I like,
I liked them,
you know,
they're like,

2188
02:08:39.341 --> 02:08:42.100
what we're doing that since it's a different sort of a connection.

2189
02:08:42.101 --> 02:08:46.310
So I feel like hugely responsible to like write good shit and produce good shit.

2190
02:08:46.311 --> 02:08:49.780
Like that's why I'm excited to have this special come out now as opposed to like

2191
02:08:49.781 --> 02:08:52.450
maybe a year ago when I could have put it out.
But you know,
when,
uh,

2192
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:54.530
when you have a bed man,
it's like a Samurai sword.

2193
02:08:54.531 --> 02:08:58.970
Do you fucking Ben Map laid and hammer it down and sharpen it up and,
you know,

2194
02:08:58.971 --> 02:09:02.680
and as time goes on you'll edit some lines out and add some to it.

2195
02:09:02.690 --> 02:09:06.740
And then somewhere along the line it reaches its perfect form.
You know,

2196
02:09:07.060 --> 02:09:08.520
I think when you,
uh,

2197
02:09:08.550 --> 02:09:12.040
when you can use that sword to cut heads off after a couple of weeks,

2198
02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:13.930
but it might not be the same sword,

2199
02:09:13.970 --> 02:09:17.230
the delicate instrument of destruction that you'll have after two years when

2200
02:09:17.231 --> 02:09:21.040
it's your closing bit.
Yeah,
absolutely.

2201
02:09:21.070 --> 02:09:23.470
Is there a better feeling than coming up with a new bit and having a crush?

2202
02:09:24.130 --> 02:09:27.160
I wonder,
I wonder cause I have this new bit and I'm like,
I have like,

2203
02:09:27.340 --> 02:09:29.830
it's like my little toy.
Like you can't wait to use it.

2204
02:09:29.900 --> 02:09:32.310
It's exciting then that like I use it and then I'm like,
damn,

2205
02:09:32.470 --> 02:09:36.010
okay now let's play with their old toys.
Toys,

2206
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:40.150
do toys a Munster right now.
I love the fact that too,

2207
02:09:40.151 --> 02:09:44.290
as you get older and more experience and more education and more information and

2208
02:09:44.291 --> 02:09:48.160
you had and better as a comedian that every time you come up with new shit it's

2209
02:09:48.161 --> 02:09:49.780
like better new shit.
You know,

2210
02:09:49.781 --> 02:09:53.740
it's scary to abandon everything but once you do and then you come up with a

2211
02:09:53.741 --> 02:09:56.800
whole,
like Ari had a real good point.
Like he was saying that,
you know,

2212
02:09:56.801 --> 02:10:01.540
if you worked on a bit and decided to like work on that bit for five or 10

2213
02:10:01.541 --> 02:10:05.890
years,
you know that all that energy you could have used on that bit,

2214
02:10:05.950 --> 02:10:06.580
you could have,

2215
02:10:06.580 --> 02:10:10.270
you could have like abandoned it two years ago and then worked on the a new bit

2216
02:10:10.450 --> 02:10:11.800
for another two years and then you know,

2217
02:10:11.801 --> 02:10:15.890
in a completely abandoned it and started all new and all that creativity would

2218
02:10:15.891 --> 02:10:19.120
have gone into something completely new and different.
And it's totally true,

2219
02:10:19.121 --> 02:10:22.330
right?
Yeah.
So there's like a line that you have to cross.
Like when is it,

2220
02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:27.130
is it was a year for a new act as two years I think.

2221
02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:28.960
I think a year,

2222
02:10:28.961 --> 02:10:33.500
if you start always turning over stuff after a year you actually lose something.

2223
02:10:33.620 --> 02:10:35.090
I think a year you have to be,

2224
02:10:35.810 --> 02:10:40.520
if you're like talking about just abandoning everything stuff every 12 months.

2225
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:44.780
I mean just from experience of watching standup,
right.

2226
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:49.870
I feel like it gets better in that 16 to 24 month frame where you can do like re

2227
02:10:50.011 --> 02:10:53.520
like I get super tight,
you know?
Yeah.
Well,
I'm definitely,

2228
02:10:53.521 --> 02:10:56.480
and we've all gone through that experience of recording something and then the

2229
02:10:56.480 --> 02:10:57.710
next week you have like a new tagline on,

2230
02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:03.780
Oh Mitch Hedberg actually re did a bit on the second album because he didn't

2231
02:11:04.521 --> 02:11:07.400
have the tagline and set it on the album that he was doing that.

2232
02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:12.060
Here's the new pot.
Yeah,
yeah.

2233
02:11:12.270 --> 02:11:15.710
That's tempting when you've actually record the bit then maybe you should throw

2234
02:11:15.711 --> 02:11:17.320
it out because you've recorded it.
Yeah.

2235
02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:20.350
Why hold on to something that you can't use.
The,

2236
02:11:21.140 --> 02:11:22.730
I talked to [inaudible] about this and he was,

2237
02:11:22.731 --> 02:11:24.890
and he and I are sort of an agreement about this.
Like yeah,

2238
02:11:24.891 --> 02:11:28.320
you got to have all new shit,
but you also have to do well you can't,

2239
02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:31.160
you can't have a bad show and if you're tanking it with all your new stuff,

2240
02:11:31.161 --> 02:11:34.190
it might be time to bust out some shit that really works and just pull this

2241
02:11:34.191 --> 02:11:37.220
bitch out of the fire.
Sure.
It's,
you have to find that.

2242
02:11:37.250 --> 02:11:41.120
When is that time like some guys like I think Louis CK pretty much just to it

2243
02:11:41.121 --> 02:11:44.030
out and when he does new stuff he just does only new stuff.

2244
02:11:44.380 --> 02:11:46.190
You know like Chris Rock,
you should do that too.

2245
02:11:46.190 --> 02:11:49.610
I remember he used to come into the store and he would just be only new stuff

2246
02:11:49.670 --> 02:11:52.760
and you know,
and not be concerned whatsoever about it not going well.

2247
02:11:52.761 --> 02:11:55.610
It's trying to make it go well,
but if it doesn't,
he's sticking to it.

2248
02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:58.560
He's not going to pull out some old shit out of his bag.
Yeah,

2249
02:11:58.670 --> 02:12:01.480
but that's the way you you build.
That's one way.

2250
02:12:01.550 --> 02:12:04.970
That's certainly a way some guys like to sandwich it in between other bits,

2251
02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:05.241
you know,

2252
02:12:05.241 --> 02:12:09.380
and then slowly develop like them as new chunks instead of like kind of feel

2253
02:12:09.381 --> 02:12:13.760
like you get,
I get like a kind of energy out of opening with new stuff.

2254
02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:19.030
Yeah,
risk.
But there's a,
there's a bigger lane,

2255
02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:26.570
real seeker.
That's exciting.
You have to be a comedian,
right?

2256
02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:29.000
Oh,

2257
02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:34.000
you have to be completely willing to not have comfort financially,

2258
02:12:34.550 --> 02:12:38.120
emotionally,
sometimes physically.
But if it works out,

2259
02:12:39.130 --> 02:12:40.070
it works out.
Scott,

2260
02:12:40.140 --> 02:12:43.340
it's such a much better way of life to doing something you don't want to do.

2261
02:12:44.150 --> 02:12:45.920
That's the big curse of this society.

2262
02:12:45.921 --> 02:12:50.090
The big curse of the society is so fucking complicated that a great many of us

2263
02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:54.410
has to have to do some shit that sucks in order to keep the society rolling.

2264
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:57.780
So that's why there's all these jobs that suck and then people have to do those

2265
02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:00.920
fucking jobs.
It's just no way around it.
They have to get done.

2266
02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:03.440
And so someone's doing it and then the society is set up there.

2267
02:13:03.441 --> 02:13:06.710
It's really hard to get ahead and he'd just scrounging and scratch and trying to

2268
02:13:06.711 --> 02:13:08.990
take these jobs.
It's suck.
And then by the end of the week,

2269
02:13:08.991 --> 02:13:12.050
your God damn exhausted.
And that's how most people are living their life.

2270
02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:15.200
It's amazing.
It's really amazing when you stop and think about it.

2271
02:13:15.410 --> 02:13:19.700
And I wonder how long society can really sustain itself once people get hip to

2272
02:13:19.701 --> 02:13:22.280
that.
Because once people get hip to that,
I mean,
what are we going to do?

2273
02:13:22.281 --> 02:13:24.770
We're gonna invent robots,
do all the jobs that suck.
It was going to.

2274
02:13:25.070 --> 02:13:26.540
Those jobs have to get done right.

2275
02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:31.040
Unless we completely restructured the whole foundations of our society.

2276
02:13:31.300 --> 02:13:32.910
Crappy jobs are going to have to be there.

2277
02:13:32.911 --> 02:13:35.760
I don't think there's ever going to have to worry about that because too many

2278
02:13:35.761 --> 02:13:40.080
people just revel in their misery and I know they're miserable.

2279
02:13:40.230 --> 02:13:43.350
They don't know shit programming.
It's a lot of it.

2280
02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:48.560
The human mind adapts incredibly well to its environment and adapts to incest

2281
02:13:49.141 --> 02:13:53.010
and violence and all those things and treats them as the norm and that's what

2282
02:13:53.011 --> 02:13:56.750
happens in every bad neighborhood all across the world.
You know,
these,
the,

2283
02:13:56.751 --> 02:14:01.170
the level of happiness is not often dictated by what their environment is like.

2284
02:14:01.470 --> 02:14:04.470
You know,
sometimes it's just they can get dinged,
get used to anything.
You know,

2285
02:14:04.471 --> 02:14:08.250
people can get used to it.
Yeah.
There's a weird who also know they're miserable.

2286
02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:12.120
Yeah.
What they don't know is it there they could make choices to get out of that

2287
02:14:12.121 --> 02:14:15.180
misery.
Yeah.
They don't act on it.
Well,
the real,
the issue,

2288
02:14:15.181 --> 02:14:18.600
obviously it's kids that are in those environments that they don't have a choice

2289
02:14:18.601 --> 02:14:21.660
and didn't,
didn't fuck up to get there,
you know,

2290
02:14:21.690 --> 02:14:26.160
but to be in a shit situation,
it's never good for the mind.

2291
02:14:26.220 --> 02:14:28.530
It's never good for your relaxation,

2292
02:14:28.531 --> 02:14:31.470
your ability to sit back and no thing

2293
02:14:31.690 --> 02:14:33.390
<v 5>I gotta tell you,
even when we lived in,</v>

2294
02:14:33.391 --> 02:14:38.080
in that terrible neighborhood for two years,
it took an emotional toll on me.

2295
02:14:38.130 --> 02:14:39.580
Yeah.
I was like,
God,

2296
02:14:39.581 --> 02:14:43.960
imagine if I grew up in this neighborhood and this is all I saw and I never knew

2297
02:14:43.961 --> 02:14:47.410
that there was a neighborhood just three miles away then I was going to move to.

2298
02:14:47.411 --> 02:14:49.870
That would change my outlook on everything,

2299
02:14:49.871 --> 02:14:54.400
but it motivated us to work so much harder and get the fuck out.
That's right.

2300
02:14:55.670 --> 02:14:57.640
That it did that.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2301
02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:59.430
<v 0>Just fall into the misery of it.</v>

2302
02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:02.310
One of the things that I liked most about living in Colorado was that there was

2303
02:15:02.311 --> 02:15:03.330
very few people up there,

2304
02:15:03.331 --> 02:15:07.660
so I didn't feel like I was being inundated by other people's personalities.

2305
02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:11.070
And when you're in a bad neighborhood,
you're inundated by,

2306
02:15:11.071 --> 02:15:13.020
it seems like hippy bullshit,

2307
02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:16.060
but I believe that if you're in an area where a lot of crimes going on,

2308
02:15:16.090 --> 02:15:19.100
a lot of negative shit is going on.
You can feel it in the air.
Absolutely.

2309
02:15:19.170 --> 02:15:20.460
You almost can feel it in the end.

2310
02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:23.700
I would love to see like studies on plants that grow up around

2311
02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:27.400
<v 5>violent areas.
You know,
if they're like all fucked up and shaky and</v>

2312
02:15:29.380 --> 02:15:33.940
nervous wreck plan pants plans just always gunshots around here.
But it's true.

2313
02:15:33.941 --> 02:15:35.200
You are a product of your environment.

2314
02:15:35.201 --> 02:15:37.780
Like I was remembering last night in second grade,

2315
02:15:37.781 --> 02:15:41.220
I hung out with this girl Megan and she was a straight a student or third grades

2316
02:15:41.740 --> 02:15:44.920
and my grades went up for the first time in my life.

2317
02:15:44.921 --> 02:15:48.060
Like I was getting straight A's because I was hanging out with this nerdy girl

2318
02:15:48.610 --> 02:15:52.270
who was really into studies and then the minute we stop being friends,

2319
02:15:52.271 --> 02:15:56.770
I went back to being my normal slacker ceased.
Wow,
that's amazing.

2320
02:15:57.240 --> 02:15:59.500
Yeah.
There is something to that fucked.
Yeah.

2321
02:15:59.501 --> 02:16:03.520
That was hanging out with comics too,
that are funnier than you and proliferate,

2322
02:16:04.140 --> 02:16:04.740
proliferate

2323
02:16:04.740 --> 02:16:05.990
<v 0>to a certain guys like bill burr.</v>

2324
02:16:05.991 --> 02:16:08.750
He's always real prolific and whenever I see him do a bunch of new shit,

2325
02:16:08.751 --> 02:16:11.210
I get excited.
I don't want to go.
Right.
Yeah.
Chappelle wouldn't.

2326
02:16:11.211 --> 02:16:14.300
One of them was seeing him do sets is pretty rare to catch him these days.

2327
02:16:14.301 --> 02:16:18.280
But yeah,
I always get excited.
Want to go home and write?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2328
02:16:18.290 --> 02:16:20.430
We feed off each other for sure.
No doubt.

2329
02:16:20.450 --> 02:16:22.070
But that's one of the beautiful things about La.

2330
02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:24.230
Think about how many good comics are here.
Oh yeah.

2331
02:16:24.300 --> 02:16:28.160
I like to sell a whole podcast network idea that I had me can't do that in any

2332
02:16:28.161 --> 02:16:32.620
other place.
We that many cool people,
Joey,
Ari,
Dunkin,
you guys,
all,

2333
02:16:32.621 --> 02:16:35.590
everyone is connected.
Red,
Bam,
everyone's connected.

2334
02:16:35.980 --> 02:16:38.440
You know Brett Fitzsimmons so I mean if you put,

2335
02:16:38.441 --> 02:16:42.370
if you put up like how many great podcasts emanate from this one area,

2336
02:16:42.371 --> 02:16:44.430
it's pretty much incredible.
It's a lot.
Yeah.

2337
02:16:44.470 --> 02:16:46.060
I mean there's not a lot of spots in the country.

2338
02:16:46.061 --> 02:16:50.030
We could start like a whole network of podcasts that are,
you know,

2339
02:16:50.050 --> 02:16:53.420
as established as the ones that we have here in la.
It's incredible how,

2340
02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:58.450
how that has taken over as such a dominating force in entertainment and it's

2341
02:16:58.451 --> 02:17:02.370
going to keep growing.
Well,
it's free,
right?
Yeah.
And it's really good people.

2342
02:17:02.380 --> 02:17:07.380
I listen to it over turning on a television or over watching a movie.

2343
02:17:07.660 --> 02:17:09.940
Well,
it's really good to get shit done.
You know,

2344
02:17:09.941 --> 02:17:11.320
like if you're cleaning up your office,

2345
02:17:11.321 --> 02:17:13.990
I love listening to podcasts when I'm cleaning up my office or something with,

2346
02:17:14.050 --> 02:17:19.030
obviously I do a lot of cleaning,
you know,
I have too much shit in here.

2347
02:17:19.031 --> 02:17:23.280
I need to get rid of some of it.
But the,
you know,
the,
the idea that it's in,

2348
02:17:23.370 --> 02:17:26.560
in a lot of people's ears when they're at the gym and they're pushing themselves

2349
02:17:26.561 --> 02:17:28.030
through their workouts and stuff.
I mean,

2350
02:17:28.330 --> 02:17:31.420
I think that's one of the coolest aspects about this form of entertainment.

2351
02:17:31.421 --> 02:17:32.160
It's like it,

2352
02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:36.300
it's the form of entertainment that makes doing other shit more interesting and

2353
02:17:36.310 --> 02:17:39.190
do it while you're on long drives.
You do it while you're on a commute.

2354
02:17:39.220 --> 02:17:42.750
It is the best.
Yeah.
Airplanes.
It's fun time and you know,

2355
02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:44.800
and if you get three or four good ones,
man,

2356
02:17:44.801 --> 02:17:47.270
the whole flight to Australia has done,
you know?
Yeah.

2357
02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:49.890
He just plugged those bitches on kickback,
you know,

2358
02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:52.360
have a glass of wine and join in man.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2359
02:17:52.510 --> 02:17:55.390
Maybe if it was time to correctly take an edible when you're at the airport,

2360
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.920
right as you pull up,

2361
02:17:56.921 --> 02:17:59.770
you don't want anything on you folks don't is don't fly dirty.
No flat.

2362
02:17:59.790 --> 02:18:03.760
So don't be scared of flying with an edible life changing damn experience

2363
02:18:04.540 --> 02:18:05.870
<v 5>about podcasting too,</v>

2364
02:18:05.871 --> 02:18:10.100
is that I feel like it hearkens back to the time of radio and when people had to

2365
02:18:10.101 --> 02:18:15.101
just sit and listen and listen to long stories and that that doesn't exist on

2366
02:18:15.621 --> 02:18:16.550
television anymore.

2367
02:18:16.551 --> 02:18:20.780
Everything's cut so fast and everything is information so quick that now it's

2368
02:18:20.781 --> 02:18:24.290
like we're going back and I love that idea that you can just sit and listen to

2369
02:18:24.291 --> 02:18:28.820
like a three hour thing.
Yeah.
What also gives hawking,
yeah,
that's natural.

2370
02:18:29.060 --> 02:18:32.840
Natural,
yeah.
Yeah.
Not This hyper inflammation.

2371
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:35.330
Seven minutes tonight show or you're sitting,
yeah,

2372
02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:40.280
<v 0>down on the couch talking about your or television or zoo.
Half second edits,</v>

2373
02:18:40.310 --> 02:18:42.430
but boom,
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.
Yeah.

2374
02:18:42.540 --> 02:18:42.721
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

2375
02:18:42.721 --> 02:18:45.690
and then they tell you coming up next you're going to see this scene and then

2376
02:18:45.691 --> 02:18:48.360
you come back from commercial.
You're going to see this scene right now,

2377
02:18:48.361 --> 02:18:50.640
and then they show you the scene and they're like,
yeah,
man,
I get it.

2378
02:18:50.641 --> 02:18:51.474
I fucking got it.

2379
02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:56.080
<v 0>I can process information.
If we had a producer of the show and they were like,</v>

2380
02:18:56.081 --> 02:18:58.930
well,
this is some of the things we're going to do to take it to the next level.

2381
02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:01.810
Okay,
we got it.
We got to edit it.
There's a lot of downtime,

2382
02:19:02.410 --> 02:19:03.580
two minutes where you're twittering,

2383
02:19:03.740 --> 02:19:07.290
you're twittering on this fucking podcast for two minutes.
Sure.
You know?
Oh,

2384
02:19:07.390 --> 02:19:10.100
sorry.
Oh,
that's actually what I,

2385
02:19:10.110 --> 02:19:13.060
that's part of the beautiful thing about it is like when you hear you talk,

2386
02:19:13.090 --> 02:19:16.660
you get to really know you.
When you hear you talk,
you get to really know you.

2387
02:19:16.661 --> 02:19:19.090
It's not a sound bite.
It's a long conversation.

2388
02:19:19.330 --> 02:19:22.780
I noticed that like with a lot of foreign films,

2389
02:19:22.781 --> 02:19:27.590
sometimes you'll have longer shot,
they won't edit,
right.
Cut.
And you're like,

2390
02:19:27.591 --> 02:19:29.720
yeah,
but that's actually a very,

2391
02:19:29.721 --> 02:19:32.270
like if a guy's making breakfast or pouring coffee,

2392
02:19:32.630 --> 02:19:37.160
they'll let the shot go of him running it and the coffee pouring and then him

2393
02:19:37.161 --> 02:19:38.780
pouring it in and stirring it and you're like,

2394
02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:41.110
but that's not like that guys really making coffee.
Right?

2395
02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:45.400
Like so it's not fucking 15 customers they get,
but that's,

2396
02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:49.670
you're watching like real life kind of develop right then.
Right.
You can fall,

2397
02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:50.810
you sink into it more.

2398
02:19:50.990 --> 02:19:55.580
But American style of editing TV or film is always,

2399
02:19:55.581 --> 02:19:59.810
what don't I need to let a shot lasts too long.
Music,
video style.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2400
02:19:59.811 --> 02:20:00.590
That's the way things are.

2401
02:20:00.590 --> 02:20:05.170
You say that is making people dumb or making people impatient?
Impatient.

2402
02:20:06.340 --> 02:20:11.050
<v 5>I believe it's first for instance,
on Facebook,
like not like it's all binary.</v>

2403
02:20:11.051 --> 02:20:13.600
Zero one coke,
Pepsi.
Yes.
No.

2404
02:20:13.810 --> 02:20:17.440
You know how limiting that is to human thought?
I mean,
I don't even,

2405
02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:20.350
I don't even know people that,
I don't read books right now.

2406
02:20:20.980 --> 02:20:24.350
I mean maybe one in the last month,
but like,
uh,

2407
02:20:24.351 --> 02:20:26.740
it just limits the way we see the world.

2408
02:20:26.890 --> 02:20:31.180
Just generation only grows up knowing I like this though,
are epic fail.

2409
02:20:31.270 --> 02:20:35.590
That should makes me bananas.
Oh really?
And that was a fail.

2410
02:20:35.591 --> 02:20:39.130
Like some guy tried something and didn't succeed and we're all going to shit on

2411
02:20:39.131 --> 02:20:39.640
that.
Yeah.

2412
02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:42.960
<v 0>It's also the door.
We encourage people to be like,
that sucks.
Yeah.</v>

2413
02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:45.630
Was fucking suck.
Well,
the culture of that song,

2414
02:20:45.660 --> 02:20:49.830
and then there's youtube comments.
Oh yeah.

2415
02:20:50.230 --> 02:20:51.930
Repercussions.
You're completely anonymous.

2416
02:20:51.931 --> 02:20:56.520
So you're allowed to say things that you would never say with any real,
you know,

2417
02:20:56.521 --> 02:21:01.010
a person in front of you because it's such a cool thing to do.
The Harvard,

2418
02:21:01.011 --> 02:21:05.280
but they're assholes.
They're shitty about it.
They're racist.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
No,

2419
02:21:05.340 --> 02:21:08.850
they're,
they're misogynistic or homophobic.
Yeah.
It brings out,

2420
02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:13.400
well that's normal,
but that's the,
that's come see anonymous.
Yeah.

2421
02:21:14.710 --> 02:21:18.660
It's a weird thing where we developed a way to communicate with people.
That is,

2422
02:21:18.700 --> 02:21:22.110
it's,
it's,
there's no interaction.
There's no exchange.

2423
02:21:22.230 --> 02:21:24.810
You're allowed to throw the information out there,
like a bomb,

2424
02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:27.090
like you lava bomb.
Over a building.

2425
02:21:27.120 --> 02:21:29.920
Your message board is a perfect example of that.
Like,

2426
02:21:29.940 --> 02:21:33.870
like if I was just talking to you and guys in a room and then some guy came up

2427
02:21:33.871 --> 02:21:38.640
and it's like,
you know,
you're just annoying.
I think your face sucks.
Yeah.

2428
02:21:38.641 --> 02:21:42.150
Even not just come up or something.
My conversation people don't understand.

2429
02:21:42.151 --> 02:21:44.660
When I kicked him out of band and they say,
yeah,
I can't believe you Lord,

2430
02:21:44.700 --> 02:21:47.250
you want censorship?
I don't want to ship.
This is what it is.

2431
02:21:47.430 --> 02:21:48.630
This is a house party.
My,

2432
02:21:48.631 --> 02:21:51.660
my website is an Internet House party and anybody can join.

2433
02:21:51.870 --> 02:21:54.990
But when you're a cunt,
when you create problems and negative energy,

2434
02:21:54.991 --> 02:21:57.210
when you don't know how to cook,
even if you have a criticism or something,

2435
02:21:57.211 --> 02:22:00.360
there's a lot of people that have had very valid criticisms and those helped me.

2436
02:22:00.361 --> 02:22:01.410
I really think they do.

2437
02:22:01.680 --> 02:22:05.410
I think valid criticisms on the podcast or stand up or even my you,

2438
02:22:05.411 --> 02:22:08.640
Emma May commentary anything I think.
I don't think anyone's ever perfect.

2439
02:22:08.641 --> 02:22:09.540
And I think a lot of times,

2440
02:22:09.541 --> 02:22:13.500
especially when you're doing as much on the fly ad libbing stuff,

2441
02:22:13.501 --> 02:22:17.400
as I'm doing 99% of my living,
I make completely add living.

2442
02:22:17.580 --> 02:22:18.151
That's what I'm doing.

2443
02:22:18.151 --> 02:22:20.850
I'm going to make mistakes and I'm going to make mistakes and I'm doing standup

2444
02:22:20.851 --> 02:22:22.620
comedy or commentary for the UFC.

2445
02:22:22.830 --> 02:22:25.560
I'm going to make mistakes and I'm doing a stand up.
It's just a of life.

2446
02:22:25.561 --> 02:22:29.190
So I appreciate criticism and I,
I understand that,

2447
02:22:29.191 --> 02:22:33.180
like when I'm doing something,
oftentimes it's completely unplanned out.

2448
02:22:33.181 --> 02:22:36.150
Like this exact sentence that I'm saying right now.
Completely unplanned down.

2449
02:22:36.180 --> 02:22:37.260
Yeah.
So when you know,

2450
02:22:37.261 --> 02:22:40.980
people like will nitpick and criticized the hidden meaning behind each fucking

2451
02:22:40.981 --> 02:22:45.210
word or each,
each word you chose or way you went with the conversation,

2452
02:22:45.211 --> 02:22:47.850
it's like,
God damn,
we just settle the fuck down.

2453
02:22:48.140 --> 02:22:52.180
It's like you give people too much of an opportunity to be cunty.
Yes.
You know,

2454
02:22:52.181 --> 02:22:53.430
the Neal Brennan podcast,

2455
02:22:53.680 --> 02:22:56.670
some guy was saying that I was yelling down kneel because I didn't agree with

2456
02:22:56.671 --> 02:22:59.190
his,
his,
his,
uh,
his statements.
I was like,

2457
02:22:59.490 --> 02:23:02.190
what the fuck podcast did you listen to?

2458
02:23:02.340 --> 02:23:04.020
We had a podcast where we all had fun together.

2459
02:23:04.050 --> 02:23:05.760
There was no disagreement whatsoever,

2460
02:23:05.940 --> 02:23:09.360
but people will break this shit down to make it some just,

2461
02:23:09.420 --> 02:23:12.300
they will just nitpick on only the negative aspects of it.

2462
02:23:12.301 --> 02:23:15.480
And it's always people that are fucking miserable.

2463
02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:19.730
I also think like each one of these episodes,
and I getting into exact numbers,

2464
02:23:19.731 --> 02:23:23.490
there's just say hundreds of thousands of people listen to this and you,

2465
02:23:23.491 --> 02:23:25.890
you might hear,
I have hundreds of thousands of people.

2466
02:23:25.891 --> 02:23:29.500
You might hear like 20 people and that's true.
Bottom of the barrel knit,

2467
02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:31.830
most negative cat,
they have a million cats.

2468
02:23:31.831 --> 02:23:35.550
They're fucking his ass holes in general.
And if you focus on those drawings,

2469
02:23:35.770 --> 02:23:39.930
not the 490 million other people,
uh,
then you're,

2470
02:23:39.931 --> 02:23:42.090
you're going to go drive yourself crazy.
That's a good point.

2471
02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:46.200
But I firmly believed that you can't be too self congratulatory and I think you

2472
02:23:46.201 --> 02:23:51.180
have to address any possible valid criticisms.
So when I read negative shit,

2473
02:23:51.181 --> 02:23:53.460
I have to take an assessment.
I have to go,
okay,

2474
02:23:53.490 --> 02:23:55.890
I gotta look at this subjectively that I do that.
Did I do that?

2475
02:23:55.920 --> 02:23:59.340
Because I know when I've done something wrong,
I made mistakes.
I know what I do.

2476
02:23:59.820 --> 02:24:02.520
Did I do that?
And then if you don't,
then you have to go,
why?
Well,

2477
02:24:02.550 --> 02:24:04.690
then you gotta look at the motivation of this person and you know,

2478
02:24:04.810 --> 02:24:08.580
and try to figure out like,
wait,
why did you look at this whole thing?
So skewed?

2479
02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:13.500
And that's the driving you crazy program talking about it's important to out

2480
02:24:13.501 --> 02:24:15.200
those people.
It's important to out those people.

2481
02:24:15.240 --> 02:24:18.090
Set the tone for the rest of the board.
You let those people know that,
look,

2482
02:24:18.091 --> 02:24:20.790
this is what's going on here.
This is just conti negative behavior.

2483
02:24:20.791 --> 02:24:24.780
It's not necessary.
Let's communicate like,
yeah,
let's communicate.

2484
02:24:24.780 --> 02:24:28.530
Like we're at my house,
right?
We're at a house party.
Let's be polite.
You know,

2485
02:24:28.650 --> 02:24:31.230
look,
if we're at a house party and someone comes up to me and start saying,

2486
02:24:31.231 --> 02:24:32.400
you know,
um,
you know,
hey,

2487
02:24:32.401 --> 02:24:36.060
the Mormon faith is a true faith and Joseph Smith as well.
Okay,

2488
02:24:36.090 --> 02:24:38.280
let's have a polite conversation about this.
You know,

2489
02:24:38.430 --> 02:24:42.540
let's politely talk about you.
Tell me why you,
you know,
pretend like you are my,

2490
02:24:42.570 --> 02:24:46.590
my wife's husband and wife's friend's husband.
You know what I mean?

2491
02:24:46.650 --> 02:24:49.680
Like you're a guy.
I have to be nice to all right.
Yeah.
Tell me,

2492
02:24:49.681 --> 02:24:50.800
tell me what the fuck you think.

2493
02:24:50.801 --> 02:24:53.700
And hopefully we can get through this without anybody raising their voice.

2494
02:24:54.110 --> 02:24:58.800
You know,
but on the Internet,
it's right away.
You fucking frog it right away.

2495
02:24:58.920 --> 02:25:02.430
Retard.
Go back to school.
Fail

2496
02:25:05.270 --> 02:25:06.270
you so dumb.

2497
02:25:06.510 --> 02:25:11.380
<v 5>Die.
It kills me because like when I was growing up here in the valley,
I,</v>

2498
02:25:11.430 --> 02:25:15.540
you know,
if you said some shit to someone,
he got fucking smacked.

2499
02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:19.140
I used to fight with black girls cause I will say shit.
Whoa.
Yeah.

2500
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:23.670
But you know what?
I learned what not to fucking say shit to me because

2501
02:25:25.850 --> 02:25:29.020
<v 0>you fight with leg checks and they fucking tell you what's up.
And guess what?</v>

2502
02:25:29.050 --> 02:25:31.570
I don't,
I don't write awful things on the Internet to Pete.

2503
02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:34.330
How often do you go on world star Hip Hop?
What's that?

2504
02:25:34.331 --> 02:25:37.140
I don't even know what that is.
No,
it isn't.

2505
02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:40.900
Go on world star hip hop.com you would cease and desist all fucking with black

2506
02:25:40.901 --> 02:25:43.690
girls immediately cause nobody leaves a beaten on.
Another

2507
02:25:47.100 --> 02:25:49.090
recent one,
we're over a Twitter beef.

2508
02:25:49.091 --> 02:25:53.580
If you just Google [inaudible] roll star hip hop.com Twitter beat sent it to me,

2509
02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:55.211
Brian,
Brian,

2510
02:25:55.211 --> 02:25:57.610
I'll pull it up if you want to pull it up right and pull it up on youtube or the

2511
02:25:57.611 --> 02:26:01.810
best fighters to world star hip hop is that on the iPad but work on the IPAD.

2512
02:26:03.710 --> 02:26:07.390
Just this chick beat the fuck out of this girl and went right away to the old

2513
02:26:07.391 --> 02:26:10.120
school pride head stomps.
She was head stomping her.

2514
02:26:10.270 --> 02:26:13.780
She got her down ragdoll to the ground and stomped her in the head immediately.

2515
02:26:13.781 --> 02:26:17.230
Like our killer threw bombs that are like really vicious bombs.

2516
02:26:17.231 --> 02:26:20.790
Punches and stops.
There's some real bruises.
Name fighters,

2517
02:26:20.820 --> 02:26:25.210
I mean on on Worldstar there's some like there's some street like knockouts

2518
02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:29.200
where you see the head hit the concrete and like a lot of them and then they

2519
02:26:29.201 --> 02:26:33.130
start kicking him in the head.
Woman down.
I didn't get it that bad.

2520
02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:34.073
I just got punched.

2521
02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:39.440
World Star hip hop is easily the worst example of humanity available on the

2522
02:26:39.820 --> 02:26:41.080
outside of snuff films.

2523
02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:43.630
Cause some of those people might have died and if they didn't die,

2524
02:26:43.631 --> 02:26:44.840
a piece of them died.
That's,

2525
02:26:44.870 --> 02:26:47.200
there's one guy that got knocked out where they just kept kicking him in the

2526
02:26:47.201 --> 02:26:49.690
head while he was unconscious.
It was,
it's so hard to watch.

2527
02:26:50.020 --> 02:26:52.390
That guy is forever fucked.
There's no,

2528
02:26:52.391 --> 02:26:56.110
there's no question in my mind that that damage that he got that day to his

2529
02:26:56.111 --> 02:26:57.370
brain is irreparable.

2530
02:26:57.400 --> 02:27:02.400
He got hit by punts soccer kicks to the head while he's unconscious.

2531
02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:04.750
People just running over and punching him in the face.

2532
02:27:04.810 --> 02:27:07.240
So he's getting just concussion after concussion.

2533
02:27:07.390 --> 02:27:10.750
His brain is just swashing inside his skull for sure.

2534
02:27:10.930 --> 02:27:13.290
He's going to be fucked up for months.
You know,

2535
02:27:13.300 --> 02:27:14.690
it's the one in Baltimore where they,

2536
02:27:14.780 --> 02:27:19.780
they knocked him out and then they start to close off the sound of his head

2537
02:27:21.041 --> 02:27:24.820
falling onto the concrete was the unconscious when he gets knocked out by the

2538
02:27:24.821 --> 02:27:26.040
punch.
Oh,

2539
02:27:27.380 --> 02:27:32.380
I got a bunch of tweets from cops in Baltimore because Neil Neal Brennan and I

2540
02:27:32.861 --> 02:27:34.330
were talking about it.
Neil was saying,
well,

2541
02:27:34.331 --> 02:27:38.350
it's like I'm sort of a mob mentality that takes on,
and I said,
well,

2542
02:27:38.351 --> 02:27:42.490
I totally agreed there are certain extent,
although I agree to a certain extent,

2543
02:27:42.491 --> 02:27:44.470
the mob mentality is real and it does happen sometimes.

2544
02:27:44.470 --> 02:27:45.850
I don't think that's what was going on there.

2545
02:27:46.060 --> 02:27:48.610
I think that was a drunk guy that was around a bunch of criminals,
man.

2546
02:27:48.611 --> 02:27:51.330
And they're just used to that.
And this,
these guys from Baltimore,

2547
02:27:51.350 --> 02:27:54.350
these cops from Baltimore tweeted me and a bunch of them were telling me like,

2548
02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:56.140
like read this,
check out that you know.

2549
02:27:56.141 --> 02:27:58.630
And other people tweeted me about the same issue.

2550
02:27:58.810 --> 02:28:02.490
Like probably like Baltimore's got a crazy fucking crime.
Yeah,

2551
02:28:03.070 --> 02:28:04.060
it's always at the top.

2552
02:28:04.061 --> 02:28:07.330
One cop said he's just shocked at the amount of crime he sees every day.

2553
02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:09.280
Charm city they call it.

2554
02:28:09.430 --> 02:28:12.340
But you would think like Baltimore sounds like a bunch of white people that live

2555
02:28:12.341 --> 02:28:15.830
by the water and eat crabs,
you know,
Maryland,

2556
02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:22.340
Washington,
DC.
I think that would be the best.
And you their logo,
their logo.

2557
02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:28.060
Detroit de Trois.
DC's only about a half an hour away from a Baltimore,

2558
02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:32.650
right,
man.
Yeah.
I don't think it's any of those bro.
Rough city.
What's it called?

2559
02:28:32.660 --> 02:28:36.140
What would this search words or you just said Worldstar hip hop.
No,

2560
02:28:36.141 --> 02:28:40.010
not girl fight.
Worldstar hip hop.
Twitter beef.
Twitter beef.
Yeah,

2561
02:28:40.011 --> 02:28:40.641
just Twitter beef.

2562
02:28:40.641 --> 02:28:43.790
Cause I think there's not a lot that fall under the category of Twitter beef.

2563
02:28:44.200 --> 02:28:46.720
You know this girl shut up this girl's house and said we're going to fight.

2564
02:28:46.730 --> 02:28:49.280
And while the other person was a filming and she pulled her out of her house and

2565
02:28:49.281 --> 02:28:54.281
it is violently beat the fuck out of her girl on girl fighting is crazy to me.

2566
02:28:55.160 --> 02:28:57.440
They have comprehension.
That's Jennifer Hudson,
bro.

2567
02:28:58.810 --> 02:29:03.650
Well it's Worldstar hip hop Twitter beef.
Just Google those words.

2568
02:29:03.651 --> 02:29:06.810
Worldstar hip hop Twitter feeds.
Look here,
I'll do it real quick.
Or Old.

2569
02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:10.880
Even Oprah Winfrey gets people like hatefully emailing her.

2570
02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:14.360
Like I watched the Oprah soul series.
Yeah,
she talks about it.
She's like,

2571
02:29:14.361 --> 02:29:16.040
people send me things like

2572
02:29:17.570 --> 02:29:22.520
trying to like help the world,
man.
I mean you agree with it.

2573
02:29:22.521 --> 02:29:26.830
Like don't hate mail Oprah Winfrey.
Nope.
That's not it.
The people hit the shit.

2574
02:29:26.850 --> 02:29:30.580
Hated her a long time girls cause she's successful to the course.
Yeah.

2575
02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:33.810
People hate everything.
People hate the Beatles.
You're mocking.

2576
02:29:33.860 --> 02:29:37.920
Watch on youtube under Beatles videos.
Yeah.
She's not like this is fake.

2577
02:29:38.210 --> 02:29:42.050
It is Twitter be home invasion right here,
bro.
Here's right here.

2578
02:29:42.380 --> 02:29:45.620
Worldstar hip hop.com and the it says home,

2579
02:29:45.650 --> 02:29:50.450
just look up home invasion girl gets tore up on our own doorstep over Twitter.

2580
02:29:50.451 --> 02:29:55.040
Beef.
Just look for home invasion.
Home invasion,

2581
02:29:55.041 --> 02:29:59.630
Twitter beef on world star hip hop.
Clean this out on this end,
right?

2582
02:29:59.660 --> 02:30:02.420
Yeah.
That's when you release the Crackin of shame.
You don't want that.

2583
02:30:03.800 --> 02:30:04.910
You don't want that.
You maybe you do.

2584
02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:07.910
Apparently there's a video where a girl puts one of those upper and then the guy

2585
02:30:07.911 --> 02:30:12.320
flux.
The flashlight
wasn't really your idea.

2586
02:30:12.970 --> 02:30:14.210
Well,
by the way,
Brian,

2587
02:30:14.240 --> 02:30:17.360
I don't think you're the first person and second that in her ass hauled.

2588
02:30:17.361 --> 02:30:21.110
Why not her vagina hall?
Well because they're assholes more pliable.
Gotcha.

2589
02:30:21.140 --> 02:30:24.740
There's a lot of girls that have giant dumpers and I can take large objects up

2590
02:30:24.741 --> 02:30:27.140
there.
That's a really great,
you know,

2591
02:30:27.141 --> 02:30:30.140
give a guy a really distorted perception reality.
If he's into that Shit,

2592
02:30:30.141 --> 02:30:33.920
you know?
Yeah.
We could put this inside.
I don't like anything in my butthole.

2593
02:30:34.270 --> 02:30:37.820
Really Nice.
Nice,
nice way to announce it on the podcast.

2594
02:30:40.970 --> 02:30:43.580
A couple of I like to share.
Well,
it's important to share,

2595
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:46.460
especially with the world,
just like this.
Uh,
you know,

2596
02:30:46.490 --> 02:30:49.700
this lady has the right to stick a flashlight up or bottle and you can know that

2597
02:30:49.701 --> 02:30:53.030
someone can do that.
You should also know,
watch this girl beat the fuck.

2598
02:30:53.090 --> 02:30:56.480
Can you go full screen on that?
Yeah.
Watch this girl.

2599
02:30:56.481 --> 02:30:57.920
She shows up at this girl's house.

2600
02:30:59.080 --> 02:30:59.913
<v 6>Okay.</v>

It's coming up real soon.</v>

2602
02:31:03.010 --> 02:31:04.970
<v 6>Oh.
Oh Shit.
Okay.</v>

2603
02:31:06.670 --> 02:31:09.850
And I'm thinking everybody I put my people,
you're,
you're talking about,

2604
02:31:12.210 --> 02:31:13.590
<v 0>she just pulls her out of the house.</v>

2605
02:31:17.570 --> 02:31:19.730
<v 8>Ooh.
That's how happens.</v>

2606
02:31:21.090 --> 02:31:24.810
<v 9>How filing stations.
Oh,</v>

2607
02:31:30.990 --> 02:31:34.650
she's beating the fuck out.
Let's go stomping on her head ticket her in the hand.

2608
02:31:35.750 --> 02:31:36.820
Pull the hair.

2609
02:31:39.710 --> 02:31:42.810
She's holding her down the stairs by her hair.
So scary.

2610
02:31:45.220 --> 02:31:49.780
<v 0>Talk about that.
Whoa.
That's been a tee shirt that I talk about that.</v>

2611
02:31:51.300 --> 02:31:55.970
Yeah.
See that's what can happen on Twitter.
Don't talk shit to black girls.

2612
02:31:56.100 --> 02:32:00.010
Oh,
for sure.
Yeah.
Did you hear a guy got,
he got arrested in a,

2613
02:32:00.011 --> 02:32:04.810
in England for a saying something on Twitter.
Have you heard about this?
No.
Yeah.

2614
02:32:04.811 --> 02:32:08.320
Let me find this because it's fucking crazy.
And it was on stand hopes Twitter.

2615
02:32:09.270 --> 02:32:12.160
Yeah.
The dude's name is Ali [inaudible] or another.
Let me find it real quick.

2616
02:32:12.161 --> 02:32:14.890
Let me go through my Twitter,
but it's,
it's fucking crazy shit.

2617
02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:19.870
Apparently he was a fucking with their government over there.
Here it is.
Um,

2618
02:32:19.900 --> 02:32:24.190
the guy was arrested and convicted.
The guy's name is Sir Ali,
Sir Underscore Ali,

2619
02:32:24.250 --> 02:32:25.240
underscore c,

2620
02:32:25.630 --> 02:32:30.630
and he got arrested and convicted for Saint [inaudible] on his Twitter and I'm

2621
02:32:32.591 --> 02:32:36.220
not bullshitting.
And um,
this is what's it's about some federal,

2622
02:32:36.221 --> 02:32:41.221
some section one 27 of the Communications Act of 2003 is what they got him on.

2623
02:32:41.230 --> 02:32:42.520
And this is all the guy wrote ready,

2624
02:32:42.820 --> 02:32:47.820
which con lives in a house like this period answers on a postcard to Bexley

2625
02:32:50.350 --> 02:32:52.990
Council.
So I guess it's the Bexley counselor that he was having a problem with.

2626
02:32:53.140 --> 02:32:54.040
So that's all he said.

2627
02:32:54.190 --> 02:32:59.080
Which con lives in a house like this answers on a postcard to Bexley council and

2628
02:32:59.081 --> 02:33:02.590
that's like,
that was the Hashtag Bexley Council.
And then here's another one,

2629
02:33:02.591 --> 02:33:03.424
another tweet.

2630
02:33:03.970 --> 02:33:08.260
It's silly posting a picture of a house on Twitter without an address that will

2631
02:33:08.261 --> 02:33:12.880
come later.
Piece fit.
Please feel free to post actual shit.

2632
02:33:13.660 --> 02:33:15.490
Okay.
What that means,
I don't know,

2633
02:33:15.491 --> 02:33:20.260
but it sounds like he put a photograph of a counselor's home.

2634
02:33:20.500 --> 02:33:24.730
Yeah.
Okay.
Melvin Seymour,
he put a photograph of this guy's home.
Okay.

2635
02:33:24.731 --> 02:33:26.620
Now to go ahead attack.
Well that's,

2636
02:33:26.710 --> 02:33:29.980
that changes everything because that's first of all,
that's creepy as fuck.
Yeah.

2637
02:33:30.010 --> 02:33:32.410
Did he put this guy's picture and he took a photo of it,

2638
02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:36.100
but that they got him for using the word cunt is what's fascinating that they

2639
02:33:36.101 --> 02:33:39.940
didn't get him for taking that picture.
What's up?
Apparently has legal.
Yes.

2640
02:33:40.090 --> 02:33:41.820
Oh yeah.
For,
for calling.

2641
02:33:41.840 --> 02:33:46.540
For saying cut our for calling upon the government guy.
I Dunno.
Sandwich.

2642
02:33:46.770 --> 02:33:49.300
Which con lives there.
Oh boy.
Yeah.

2643
02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:52.090
Well Khan does a lot less offensive in the UK.

2644
02:33:52.370 --> 02:33:56.830
Like you can call people like every other word.
It's not a thing.
Yeah,
exactly.

2645
02:33:56.920 --> 02:33:58.300
So we really should've been,

2646
02:33:58.390 --> 02:34:01.120
they should've got pissed at him for taking a picture of that guy's house,

2647
02:34:01.121 --> 02:34:05.110
but I guess they couldn't do it.
He got arrested for this.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.

2648
02:34:05.111 --> 02:34:07.750
Apparently.
Of course Stan hope took up the fight.

2649
02:34:08.620 --> 02:34:11.140
Did you see Stan hope the thing that was going on with him and that lady in

2650
02:34:11.340 --> 02:34:16.180
England?
No,
he didn't say,
oh it was great.
There was,
it was.
Yes.
Yes.

2651
02:34:16.181 --> 02:34:19.900
I did read something.
This where he was doing shows over there guys horribly ill.

2652
02:34:19.930 --> 02:34:22.720
Okay.
And this woman wrote this thing about how,
and this is the same.

2653
02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:26.050
This guy does not have the right to die and that it's not his choice to decide

2654
02:34:26.051 --> 02:34:26.620
when to die.

2655
02:34:26.620 --> 02:34:31.060
So Stan hope comes on and not only does he like go after her and he goes off on

2656
02:34:31.061 --> 02:34:34.630
Twitter and says,
guess congratulations.
You made it into the act.
You know,

2657
02:34:34.631 --> 02:34:37.510
he's saying all this shit on Twitter and then he,
he,

2658
02:34:37.540 --> 02:34:41.530
he hopes that she gets a fetid cyst on her ovaries,
like all kinds of crazy.

2659
02:34:41.531 --> 02:34:46.090
That's right.
He's out of his mind.
So,
um,
so then she like writes some hole,

2660
02:34:46.091 --> 02:34:48.490
like really crazy,
dumb,

2661
02:34:48.580 --> 02:34:53.140
terribly written article about him and comparing him to some other horrible

2662
02:34:53.141 --> 02:34:55.540
people in the world.
And you know,

2663
02:34:55.541 --> 02:34:59.380
what she doesn't address is the fact that she had written an article just a

2664
02:34:59.380 --> 02:35:03.220
couple of years ago appraising a mother for taking her child's life.
You know,

2665
02:35:03.221 --> 02:35:07.780
when the child was desk,
deathly ill and suffering and was going to die.

2666
02:35:07.840 --> 02:35:10.030
And so she's a hypocrite in her own writing.

2667
02:35:10.320 --> 02:35:14.200
She does designing a counter accountable for words.
It's just verbal diarrhea.

2668
02:35:14.201 --> 02:35:14.440
She,

2669
02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:17.260
one of those dumb people that writes things down and tries to make some sort of

2670
02:35:17.261 --> 02:35:20.950
a point because our job is to write an article and Doug found her conclusions to

2671
02:35:20.951 --> 02:35:23.770
be illogical,
idiotic and offensive.

2672
02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:26.500
So he know his in his way.
You know,

2673
02:35:26.501 --> 02:35:31.440
you asked for fucking injuries to her body and pussy problems and I mean but

2674
02:35:31.441 --> 02:35:34.900
that's,
he's a fucking standup comedian so she went off and you know she was,

2675
02:35:34.901 --> 02:35:35.111
you know,

2676
02:35:35.111 --> 02:35:38.020
trying to get them arrested and had them investigate him and all sorts of

2677
02:35:38.021 --> 02:35:39.610
different shit.
But you know,

2678
02:35:39.940 --> 02:35:44.410
he didn't really do anything wrong and the whole thing is hilarious and the

2679
02:35:44.411 --> 02:35:48.190
whole thing only probably made Doug an even bigger hero in the UK cause she's a

2680
02:35:48.191 --> 02:35:50.410
moron if you read the shit that she wrote,

2681
02:35:50.411 --> 02:35:53.980
she's such a fucking eight while in England,
right?
Cause yeah,
while in England,

2682
02:35:54.490 --> 02:35:57.610
which is crazy when you think about how lenient they are cause an America

2683
02:35:57.611 --> 02:36:00.220
awesome kids had to do is saying that we're going to come down and destroy

2684
02:36:00.221 --> 02:36:04.420
America and d let Marilyn Monroe's bones and they said that on Twitter and so

2685
02:36:04.450 --> 02:36:05.920
they were coming to party.
Okay.

2686
02:36:06.080 --> 02:36:09.430
And the fucking people at the TSA or whatever the hell it is.

2687
02:36:09.431 --> 02:36:12.580
What does it say at the Tsa?
Homeland Security and security.
Yeah.

2688
02:36:12.581 --> 02:36:14.080
They sent them back,
they arrested them,

2689
02:36:14.081 --> 02:36:15.610
they interrogated him and sent him back home.

2690
02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:17.530
They looked in their shit for shovels.

2691
02:36:17.710 --> 02:36:19.360
They thought they were really going to like,

2692
02:36:19.361 --> 02:36:24.010
they're going to bring shovels with them.
Fucking dummies,
silly pitches.

2693
02:36:25.750 --> 02:36:27.820
They sound like fun people.
I want them over here.

2694
02:36:28.170 --> 02:36:30.120
They say that come coming over here to destroy America.

2695
02:36:30.270 --> 02:36:34.900
Take up Marilyn Monroe's bones.
That's fucking photo.
Yeah,

2696
02:36:34.901 --> 02:36:37.060
that sounds like some people,
you know,

2697
02:36:37.061 --> 02:36:38.590
we could have a fucking good time with them.

2698
02:36:38.930 --> 02:36:41.920
Who sound like some people that are coming here to have fun to fuck do you don't

2699
02:36:41.921 --> 02:36:43.360
think they're really going to destroy America?

2700
02:36:43.361 --> 02:36:46.960
What al Qaeda could do it but some 24 year old couple of one's going to pull it

2701
02:36:46.961 --> 02:36:51.280
off.
Stop Trump kids straight out of college bitch.

2702
02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:52.790
Ticketless Tommy,

2703
02:36:53.120 --> 02:36:56.740
remember that article you sent me about that woman in the UK who claims that

2704
02:36:56.741 --> 02:37:01.270
she's too beautiful.
That's fine.
I think that's subtle satire.

2705
02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:06.100
If I had to guess it played like,
I mean you could read obviously like that,

2706
02:37:06.101 --> 02:37:08.380
but the fact that there were all these followups,

2707
02:37:08.770 --> 02:37:10.750
I mean it's either a well orchestrated,

2708
02:37:11.220 --> 02:37:15.860
a crazy bitch hopes or it's a crazy bitch bullet.
Little balls seemed crazy,
man.

2709
02:37:15.890 --> 02:37:16.130
I think

2710
02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:18.590
<v 3>the writer had a little bit of tongue in cheek while he's writing it cause he</v>

2711
02:37:18.591 --> 02:37:21.650
kind of knew that she was really a six.
So as he's putting that picture out,

2712
02:37:22.250 --> 02:37:26.690
she wasn't really attractive.
But she wasn't,
she wasn't ugly.
Yes,
I think so.
Yeah.

2713
02:37:26.860 --> 02:37:31.220
It was just a bit of windy city heat.
It also felt like it.

2714
02:37:31.221 --> 02:37:34.400
But the best was that like everybody who was critical of her,

2715
02:37:34.401 --> 02:37:37.100
it played into her ridiculous laugh.
She was like,

2716
02:37:37.101 --> 02:37:41.870
see all the haters came out cause I'm so hot.
Okay dear.

2717
02:37:41.871 --> 02:37:44.040
Are a lot of haters out there.
How do we fix it,
Christina?

2718
02:37:44.430 --> 02:37:45.620
Why don't we get rid of them?
How do we,

2719
02:37:45.621 --> 02:37:49.350
how do we bring them up and raise up the heaters?
Is it possible therapy?

2720
02:37:49.580 --> 02:37:53.780
We'd therapies get out for real psychotherapy.
Does that stuff work?

2721
02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:56.320
Because I a lot of people that I know that have been in it so that it doesn't,

2722
02:37:56.321 --> 02:38:00.520
it doesn't change my life for real and doing it for two years,
two years,

2723
02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:04.790
it's improved my ice to have,
it'd be riddled with anxiety and depression really.

2724
02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:08.120
You know as golf when I was 14 I was suicidal,

2725
02:38:08.121 --> 02:38:12.680
I was crazy and I was depressed for years and I two years in psychotherapy and

2726
02:38:12.681 --> 02:38:15.050
I'm like infinitely better.
That's amazing.

2727
02:38:15.140 --> 02:38:17.700
You're the best success story I've ever heard from it.
Well,

2728
02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:19.850
have a great psychotherapist if anyone wants.

2729
02:38:19.970 --> 02:38:24.050
I have too many friends that keep going to a therapist and keep continuing with

2730
02:38:24.051 --> 02:38:27.890
the same fuck ups and it's so confusing to me if you're not seeing progress,

2731
02:38:27.891 --> 02:38:31.940
like I know people that go to the same person for like 10 years and are the same

2732
02:38:31.970 --> 02:38:33.200
going around in circles.

2733
02:38:33.350 --> 02:38:36.470
You need to find somebody that can really get to the root of your bullshit.

2734
02:38:37.150 --> 02:38:40.490
And then I believe undo that bull shit.
Lucky first time with this.

2735
02:38:40.491 --> 02:38:43.730
This is the first counselor and some other guy that was wearing like white

2736
02:38:43.731 --> 02:38:47.810
velcro shoes and mommy jeans and I was like,
Yo,

2737
02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:51.770
you can't even dress yourself like you can't fucking counsel me on my life.

2738
02:38:51.770 --> 02:38:56.240
So I had dumped him.
What's odd about this broadly?
She changed my life.

2739
02:38:56.530 --> 02:39:00.480
I'll never really caught on for shoes.
Did it?
It's great for little kids.
Yeah.

2740
02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:02.970
Kangaroos,
little velcro pouch.

2741
02:39:02.971 --> 02:39:07.790
It's weird in that it's very useful.
It's very useful.
But it's just so douchey.

2742
02:39:08.090 --> 02:39:11.940
There's something dorky about Velcro for whatever reason.
Real lame man.
Yeah.

2743
02:39:11.990 --> 02:39:16.040
It never caught on.
Why is mostly white shutters,
right?
No,

2744
02:39:16.041 --> 02:39:18.130
but I'm saying like it's not there like you,

2745
02:39:18.260 --> 02:39:21.410
most of the sneakers we buy of laces.
I saw it the other day.

2746
02:39:21.411 --> 02:39:24.320
I think the problem with velcro though is is after a couple of weeks they're

2747
02:39:24.321 --> 02:39:25.670
getting shit in the velcro,

2748
02:39:25.671 --> 02:39:28.790
like cotton and stuff like that and they start being annoying.

2749
02:39:28.940 --> 02:39:33.050
We're like nail pass.
You just get new shoelaces.
Right.
And lose their sticky.

2750
02:39:33.130 --> 02:39:34.610
Yeah,
that's true.

2751
02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:36.830
But they should be able to replace that shit like you're a place shoelaces.

2752
02:39:37.220 --> 02:39:39.110
But then you'd have to go somewhere and do it.
That's annoying.

2753
02:39:39.150 --> 02:39:43.250
That's a new sentence.
That stupid.
I like vans right now.
Slip Ons,

2754
02:39:43.900 --> 02:39:47.450
no laces.
No.
Do you have them in like the cheap trick?
Black and white.

2755
02:39:47.490 --> 02:39:52.120
Checkerboard two died to lady.
I'm a lady.

2756
02:39:54.180 --> 02:39:57.410
I'm already crossing the line as a female comic.

2757
02:39:57.411 --> 02:40:01.800
So I try to keep it somewhat family feel like as a female comic.
Well,

2758
02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:02.713
I've always felt,

2759
02:40:03.110 --> 02:40:06.680
tell me if I'm right that it's harder because you have less people want to hear

2760
02:40:06.681 --> 02:40:08.790
you talk.
No one wants to hear me talk less.

2761
02:40:08.810 --> 02:40:11.360
People want to take your opinion seriously because you're a woman.

2762
02:40:11.361 --> 02:40:14.760
So if you get on stage,
do you start talking about politics immediately?

2763
02:40:14.761 --> 02:40:18.150
You're running uphill battle for you.
Talk about sex.
You're a whore for sure.

2764
02:40:18.450 --> 02:40:21.630
Do you look a look at other comics guy comics and go God,
they get a Gig,

2765
02:40:21.660 --> 02:40:26.100
get away with so much.
I do.
But I also grew up admiring male comedians.

2766
02:40:26.101 --> 02:40:29.220
Like I really loved watching Bill Hicks and,

2767
02:40:29.330 --> 02:40:33.360
and a lot of dudes.
But um,
yes,
you're right.
Absolutely.

2768
02:40:33.480 --> 02:40:37.410
Society doesn't privilege intelligence and women.
You should just be hot.

2769
02:40:37.620 --> 02:40:40.650
So that's,
that's the message you get growing up.
Just don't read books.

2770
02:40:40.651 --> 02:40:44.400
Just be Ha.
Um,
so you're up against that.
You know,

2771
02:40:44.401 --> 02:40:49.120
I actually tried to channel masculine energy when I go up there.
I do.

2772
02:40:49.250 --> 02:40:52.770
I always have this image of me putting my deck on the crowd.

2773
02:40:54.050 --> 02:40:57.810
Yeah.
I swear to God with your counselor.
Yeah.

2774
02:40:57.811 --> 02:41:00.510
But I don't want to fuck with how I do stand up,
you know what I mean?

2775
02:41:00.511 --> 02:41:04.470
Like does he like approve of this?
Lay the deck on the crowd method?
Um,

2776
02:41:04.530 --> 02:41:06.870
I guess cause it works for me in that like there's,
you know,

2777
02:41:06.871 --> 02:41:08.160
different parts of your personality.

2778
02:41:08.161 --> 02:41:12.060
I'm not that way at home with my husband and a woman with my husband.
Right.

2779
02:41:12.061 --> 02:41:14.610
Like I,
I like being a feminine,

2780
02:41:15.030 --> 02:41:19.150
but on stage I just fucking do like a masculine,

2781
02:41:19.700 --> 02:41:24.130
it's a masculine art form.
You can't read.
No,

2782
02:41:24.150 --> 02:41:28.650
it's as funny
as funny.
It's a different kind of funny.

2783
02:41:30.570 --> 02:41:34.930
Okay.
Here's a very funny feminine.
Very funny,
very funny,

2784
02:41:35.210 --> 02:41:40.140
very clever writing.
Very Feminine.
Feminine based.
That's true.
Well,

2785
02:41:40.141 --> 02:41:44.790
here's my theory on this.
Okay.
Society wants women to be agreeable,

2786
02:41:45.390 --> 02:41:47.850
to say the right thing and to make everybody feel comfortable.

2787
02:41:48.180 --> 02:41:52.380
What's funny about that?
Fucking nothing.
I'm a man.

2788
02:41:57.890 --> 02:42:01.550
Why female comedy sometimes fails because if you're,

2789
02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:04.740
if you're playing into that norm,
that social norm,
then you're like,

2790
02:42:04.741 --> 02:42:09.030
well this just agrees with what would be get the right to vote.

2791
02:42:10.110 --> 02:42:14.970
Um,
I would say the suffragettes.

2792
02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:21.300
I know in 1974 a woman couldn't have a credit card unless her husband or her

2793
02:42:21.301 --> 02:42:26.200
father allowed it.
And that was in 1974.
19

2794
02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:31.500
1313 they could vote.
Yeah.
1930.

2795
02:42:31.501 --> 02:42:34.950
I know that they couldn't run the Boston marathon until they

2796
02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:38.250
run marathons.

2797
02:42:41.110 --> 02:42:44.190
That was just not that long ago.
Yeah,
it's weird,
right?
It's weird.

2798
02:42:44.270 --> 02:42:49.040
The women's right to vote is literally a hundred years old.
Yes.

2799
02:42:49.080 --> 02:42:53.700
Where do we need to invest in time machine?
So that's crazy.
That's really crazy.

2800
02:42:54.270 --> 02:42:57.840
That's hard to believe what you were saying about having opinions.

2801
02:42:58.020 --> 02:43:01.800
Actually people don't expect me to have them,
so when I do,
then they're like,

2802
02:43:01.801 --> 02:43:06.180
whoa,
whoa,
you little girl.
I can get away with saying crazy foul shit.

2803
02:43:06.570 --> 02:43:10.350
And then I like look at her.
Isn't she cute with her opinions or thoughts?

2804
02:43:10.351 --> 02:43:11.890
You know,
so it can,
to my advantage,

2805
02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:15.790
I can say shit that dude's can't sometimes really,

2806
02:43:17.550 --> 02:43:20.320
I won't threaten or challenge.
Like for instance,

2807
02:43:20.321 --> 02:43:24.360
like let's say you said something I've,
I don't know.
I don't know.

2808
02:43:24.361 --> 02:43:28.410
It's a good example or something you mean?
Yeah.
I can tell a guy,
oh,

2809
02:43:28.450 --> 02:43:31.870
fucking shit down your throat if you do not shut the fuck up.
Right,
right.

2810
02:43:31.900 --> 02:43:34.240
I see what you're saying.
He's not going to hit feel threatened.
Right.

2811
02:43:34.270 --> 02:43:36.790
He'll be like,
oh,
that's so cute.
If you were to say that,

2812
02:43:36.791 --> 02:43:38.140
that guy might stand out and be like,
really?

2813
02:43:38.141 --> 02:43:42.170
Joe Rogan Buku and then you guys will say,
Oh look,
I use my full name.
Yeah,

2814
02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:46.060
that's true.
You would do it in,
there's a lot of funny in it,

2815
02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:49.260
but Bobby Lee could do it too.
I could do it,
but yeah,
you can do it too.

2816
02:43:49.770 --> 02:43:53.140
Just have to be not be physical.
Three years old.
Yes.
Yeah.

2817
02:43:53.330 --> 02:43:57.780
Let me poopies down your throat.
Yeah,
I'd say 11 I don't think he said,

2818
02:43:57.781 --> 02:44:00.670
well I think he's a brilliant 11 guys.

2819
02:44:00.730 --> 02:44:02.900
Start driving people so don't scare Brian.

2820
02:44:04.650 --> 02:44:08.390
All these Lamborghini's or they're just putting in death's door.

2821
02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:10.230
100 downsized.

2822
02:44:10.650 --> 02:44:15.540
You guys totally blow like five lights in a row and zoom zoom.

2823
02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:21.140
That's happening every day
for Lamborghini Avengers.

2824
02:44:21.141 --> 02:44:25.590
They come flying in.
So cute.

2825
02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:29.110
What do you like to eat?
What's your favorite food?
God is pizza or hot dogs.

2826
02:44:29.380 --> 02:44:33.420
Steak in pizza.
Chicken nuggets.
You think it needs into childish shoes?

2827
02:44:33.430 --> 02:44:36.220
That is stuff that you'd get at Chuckie cheese.

2828
02:44:37.710 --> 02:44:39.550
Hot dogs up there sliced up for me.

2829
02:44:40.210 --> 02:44:40.841
<v 1>Lick stick a lot.</v>

2830
02:44:40.841 --> 02:44:44.710
There's actually this steak house in Burbank that it just went to called the

2831
02:44:44.711 --> 02:44:46.390
smokehouse.
I don't know if you've heard of it.

2832
02:44:46.391 --> 02:44:49.360
It's right across the street from Warner brothers.
Good.
I know where it is.

2833
02:44:49.420 --> 02:44:52.500
It's been there for 65 years ago.
A story,

2834
02:44:52.570 --> 02:44:56.680
a smokehouse and the story is about like how Bob hope used to go there and have

2835
02:44:56.770 --> 02:45:00.130
blah blah blah and it's all this shit happens and I ordered a steak and I swear

2836
02:45:00.131 --> 02:45:04.360
to God they fit.
They pan fried it like it was a 30 to $30 steak,

2837
02:45:04.361 --> 02:45:09.040
but they just put it in a pan.
Yeah.
Have you ever had that where it feels like,

2838
02:45:09.070 --> 02:45:12.950
all right,
this is [inaudible] and why some people prefer doing it on a,
um,

2839
02:45:13.090 --> 02:45:17.200
a pan actually,
like,
um,
Alton was that guy's name.
Alton eats,

2840
02:45:17.230 --> 02:45:20.250
you know what I'm talking about,
right?
Is that a seventies thing or something?
No,

2841
02:45:20.260 --> 02:45:24.070
no,
no.
The apparently some people,
there's different ways of cooking steak.

2842
02:45:24.071 --> 02:45:27.160
Obviously one of them is cooking it on an infrared grill or,

2843
02:45:27.270 --> 02:45:31.000
or cold grill or a a gas grill.
Right.
You do it that way,

2844
02:45:31.001 --> 02:45:34.810
but some people believe that the best way is to sear it on a cast iron pan and

2845
02:45:34.811 --> 02:45:37.900
that you cook it on a skillet and then you put that skillet in the oven.

2846
02:45:37.901 --> 02:45:40.960
He finished it off in the oven.
I've done it that way before.
I don't like it.

2847
02:45:40.990 --> 02:45:44.230
Yeah.
I don't like it as much as I like it over over coal,

2848
02:45:44.390 --> 02:45:48.010
like over your hardwood charcoal,
it kind of pisses me off.
I felt like,
wow,

2849
02:45:48.011 --> 02:45:51.820
I just spent $30 on a good piece of meat.
That was a porter porter house.
Right.

2850
02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:55.480
And that shit tastes like fucking norms.
Not nothing against the Norris,

2851
02:45:55.490 --> 02:45:57.760
but like a $5 steak.
Really?
Yeah.

2852
02:45:57.761 --> 02:46:02.380
That's what I felt in nothing against norms and your $5 shit all over north $5

2853
02:46:02.381 --> 02:46:06.620
steak norms is thanks for five bucks.
How can I even do this shit?

2854
02:46:07.270 --> 02:46:10.000
It's amazing.
What does

2855
02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.740
<v 0>that look like before [inaudible] Joe Rogan.</v>

2856
02:46:14.880 --> 02:46:17.600
Taylor steakhouse.
Where's that?
That's old school.

2857
02:46:17.601 --> 02:46:20.690
It's from like the fifties it's on eighth street or like a,

2858
02:46:20.750 --> 02:46:24.050
it's like you could tell it was there before the neighborhood was there.

2859
02:46:24.051 --> 02:46:28.970
Kind of a Musso and Frank's ever been there.
That's old time place.
Amazing.

2860
02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:35.000
Amazing.
Good steak.
Make me angry.
Sad.
All right.
This podcast,

2861
02:46:35.090 --> 02:46:38.520
what's fucking call it over.
