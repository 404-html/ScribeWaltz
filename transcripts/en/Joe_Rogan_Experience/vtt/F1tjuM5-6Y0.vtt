00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Is this static?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hearing just in the headphones.</v>

2
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.040
<v Speaker 1>You heard something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:08.874
<v Speaker 1>but it's gone now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think live and work and we're lying </v>

4
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.563
<v Speaker 1>for happy motherfucking new year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember when we used to think that the </v>

5
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:19.980
<v Speaker 1>world's going to end?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:23.610
<v Speaker 1>I used to think that the world was gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>end and even have the license plate.</v>

7
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>I did a 2012 license plate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was convinced I was like those Mayans,</v>

8
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:30.114
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew it.</v>

9
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

10
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>The computer thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the Y Two k?</v>

11
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that too.</v>

12
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stayed home for y two k paranoid.</v>

13
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.810
<v Speaker 1>I was to the clock rolled over planes </v>
<v Speaker 1>falling from the sky.</v>

14
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's worried about the whole grid</v>

15
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:46.620
<v Speaker 1>shutting down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

16
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:47.454
<v Speaker 1>And they wouldn't be able to get it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>for months and people would run out of </v>

17
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:50.514
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to art bell a lot back </v>

18
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:53.004
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

19
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.413
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheers.</v>

20
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.253
<v Speaker 1>Cheers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] New Year.</v>

21
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Happy eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight years of episodes.</v>

22
00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.543
<v Speaker 1>Eight years of episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2018 2018 doesn't sound like a real </v>

23
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those numbers.</v>

24
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:08.830
<v Speaker 1>You say it and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

25
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.053
<v Speaker 1>I guess I guess you're right like 2018 </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like way too close to 2020 which </v>

26
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:17.460
<v Speaker 1>is like space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the future.</v>

27
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like a movie you don't like alien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what was,</v>

28
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.103
<v Speaker 1>when you watched the first alien one </v>
<v Speaker 1>with sigourney weaver from the late </v>

29
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.610
<v Speaker 1>seventies it was like 1979 what do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think the timeline was supposed to be?</v>

30
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.453
<v Speaker 1>It's probably 2001 you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause there's like a lot of movies like </v>

31
00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:40.740
<v Speaker 1>I think blade runner was something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>2017 or something like that.</v>

32
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>I want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember,</v>

33
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:45.170
<v Speaker 1>but I want to say blade runner was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>2030 or so.</v>

34
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:48.360
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that there was all the flying </v>
<v Speaker 1>cars and shit.</v>

35
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Remember weren't there flying cars or am</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thinking of Fifth Element?</v>

36
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.351
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

37
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:53.184
<v Speaker 1>there was flying cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I remember the car is going </v>

38
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:55.254
<v Speaker 1>through like the cool billboards and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and I think I confused my Scifi </v>

39
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:01.014
<v Speaker 1>movies a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like old ones played renters 2018 2019 </v>

40
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.020
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

41
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 1>That's a year from now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's wow.</v>

42
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.710
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shows how slow it actually is.</v>

43
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Technology thinks it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think it's fast.</v>

44
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Speaker 1>It shows how bad movie writers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>guessing.</v>

45
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it shows anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

46
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.290
<v Speaker 1>I think the guy who's been the best at </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicting shit was like wasn't hg wells</v>

47
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.030
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like hg wells,</v>

48
00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:30.864
<v Speaker 1>the science fiction author from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was from the 18 hundreds hg </v>

49
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>wells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he predicted a lot of shit.</v>

50
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple articles about all this</v>

51
00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>stuff you predicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

52
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.083
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The many futuristic predictions of Hg </v>

53
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:46.920
<v Speaker 1>wells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It came true.</v>

54
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.210
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what we got here.</v>

55
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.070
<v Speaker 1>What did he do or 150 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phones,</v>

56
00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:57.450
<v Speaker 1>email and television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that real in men like gods?</v>

57
00:02:57.451 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>In 1923 wells invites</v>

58
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 2>readers to a futuristic utopia that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially earth.</v>

59
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 2>After thousands of years of progress in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this alternate reality,</v>

60
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.133
<v Speaker 2>people communicate exclusively with </v>
<v Speaker 2>wireless systems that employ a kind of </v>

61
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 2>commingling of voicemail and email like </v>
<v Speaker 2>properties.</v>

62
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.263
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for an utopia except by previous </v>

63
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:21.904
<v Speaker 2>arrangement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People do not talk together on the </v>

64
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 2>telephone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He writes,</v>

65
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.990
<v Speaker 2>a message is sent to the station of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>district in which the recipient is known</v>

66
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:32.614
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there it waits until he chooses to </v>

67
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:38.700
<v Speaker 2>tap his accumulated messages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

68
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.990
<v Speaker 2>And any that one wishes to repeat can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>repeated.</v>

69
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 2>Then he talks back to the senders in </v>
<v Speaker 2>dispatches.</v>

70
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 2>Any other messages he wishes</v>

71
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.670
<v Speaker 1>the transmission is wireless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

72
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.380
<v Speaker 1>What I'd like to know if he did drugs </v>
<v Speaker 1>back then,</v>

73
00:03:58.381 --> 00:04:00.810
<v Speaker 1>like if he was doing mushrooms and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

74
00:04:00.811 --> 00:04:01.830
<v Speaker 1>I want to know.</v>

75
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 2>He also imagined forms of true </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertainment.</v>

76
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.383
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says in when the sleeper wakes from </v>

77
00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:09.934
<v Speaker 2>1899,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the protagonist rouses from two </v>

78
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:13.264
<v Speaker 2>centuries of slumber to a dystopian </v>
<v Speaker 2>London in which citizens used wondrous </v>

79
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.880
<v Speaker 2>forms of technology like the audio book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Air,</v>

80
00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 2>plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and television,</v>

81
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.230
<v Speaker 2>yet suffers systematic oppression and </v>
<v Speaker 2>social injustice.</v>

82
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 2>What in the fuck</v>

83
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.240
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck hg wells lasers to?</v>

84
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.230
<v Speaker 1>How's he so good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably mushrooms.</v>

85
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.613
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll think of something that hasn't </v>

86
00:04:42.661 --> 00:04:46.010
<v Speaker 1>been invented in a hundred years now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you invent like me?</v>

87
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

88
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.310
<v Speaker 1>here's our problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

89
00:04:50.311 --> 00:04:55.311
<v Speaker 1>I think it's almost impossible once you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know something exists to imagine a world</v>

90
00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:56.184
<v Speaker 1>in which it didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you and I are unique because we're </v>

91
00:04:59.221 --> 00:05:02.490
<v Speaker 1>old as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm older as fucker than you.</v>

92
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.950
<v Speaker 1>But we remember when there was no </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet.</v>

93
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.593
<v Speaker 1>I think we're the last of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are going to remember what life is </v>

94
00:05:10.231 --> 00:05:13.170
<v Speaker 1>like when there's no internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.633
<v Speaker 1>And what's next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the thing that hasn't been </v>

96
00:05:15.871 --> 00:05:19.140
<v Speaker 1>invented that we'll remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw the first stuff like vr.</v>

97
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having glasses always being well I think</v>

98
00:05:22.771 --> 00:05:23.010
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

99
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.843
<v Speaker 2>magic leap shit that you know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've seen that new headset that they </v>

100
00:05:26.461 --> 00:05:27.294
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are saying they're going to eventually </v>

101
00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:29.394
<v Speaker 2>wind up selling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have like a hip pack and you wear </v>

102
00:05:30.991 --> 00:05:31.830
<v Speaker 2>these goggles.</v>

103
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.600
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems like step one to me.</v>

104
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Apple is putting all their money in ar </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of Vr for that reason.</v>

105
00:05:40.911 --> 00:05:41.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what this is,</v>

106
00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:45.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This looks like blade runner.</v>

107
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that movie's not so far off the </v>

108
00:05:48.801 --> 00:05:50.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

112
00:05:54.651 --> 00:05:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the preview for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much,</v>

113
00:05:56.811 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>this is exact same thing as right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is the Microsoft one.</v>

114
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 1>What does the differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>magic leap movie.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

117
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:09.560

<v Speaker 1>Magic leap is the one that's in Florida.</v>

118
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:10.394
<v Speaker 1>They went way away from everybody else </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that they're not getting their </v>

119
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.133
<v Speaker 1>knology compromised by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these are the ones where they had </v>

120
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:20.060
<v Speaker 1>that little a dancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dances on your hand.</v>

121
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

122
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 1>So this is the really intense lifelike </v>
<v Speaker 1>augmented reality.</v>

123
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knew what it was going to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

124
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.093
<v Speaker 1>They thought any prototype had a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant backpack on and they finally got </v>

125
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:32.114
<v Speaker 1>it down to this little pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the first time we're actually </v>

126
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:36.140
<v Speaker 1>seeing with this also might not be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>final version.</v>

127
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 1>It could be smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be a little bigger.</v>

128
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looks cool.</v>

129
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 1>It looks very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like Superhero.</v>

130
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>

131
00:06:45.431 --> 00:06:48.170
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so obvious that you're wearing it.</v>

132
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.853
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need to get rid of that part and </v>

133
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:52.094
<v Speaker 1>integrate it into the headset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like this hip part like </v>

134
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.430
<v Speaker 1>batteries plus to wear it in public at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least this,</v>

135
00:06:56.431 --> 00:06:58.790
<v Speaker 1>this is probably like a home work type </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

136
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.910
<v Speaker 1>like wherever you'd use a personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>

137
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we're looking at the seed of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a future thing that's going to eat us.</v>

138
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like that.</v>

139
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.150
<v Speaker 1>That is exactly how it starts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The electronics cling to the outside and</v>

140
00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:18.584
<v Speaker 1>become inseparable and then slowly they </v>
<v Speaker 1>work their way into the organism itself </v>

141
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.323
<v Speaker 1>to the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The organism will accept symbiosis as </v>

142
00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:28.580
<v Speaker 1>long as the electronics stay on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside,</v>

143
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.193
<v Speaker 1>but if it goes inside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if the only way you use your cell </v>

144
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:35.190
<v Speaker 1>phone was a stick it in your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

145
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.053
<v Speaker 1>There's the only way it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a new cell phone and it works </v>

146
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.393
<v Speaker 1>all you have to just stick it in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass and then just carry it around with </v>

147
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:44.960
<v Speaker 1>you and you make calls with your mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a flip.</v>

148
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would say,</v>

149
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:47.084
<v Speaker 1>no way we can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as long as the electronics from the </v>

150
00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:51.790
<v Speaker 1>outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

151
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.180
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to give you a helmet.</v>

152
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.430
<v Speaker 1>You get to the electronics going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>right into your eyes.</v>

153
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.930
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna see some shit that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

154
00:07:56.931 --> 00:07:57.764
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

155
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.780
<v Speaker 1>where bolt clothing's a tech is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

156
00:08:00.781 --> 00:08:01.614
<v Speaker 1>Like there's even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Levi's and Microsoft or google </v>

157
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.560
<v Speaker 1>teamed up and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to do at jacket,</v>

158
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.753
<v Speaker 1>like a tech Jagger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just look at your jacket and read </v>

159
00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:10.004
<v Speaker 1>text and stuff off the sleeve and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine having a like a shirt and going </v>

160
00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:15.890
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today I want a purple shirt today.</v>

161
00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:16.724
<v Speaker 1>I went to blue shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you're getting text messages pop up </v>

162
00:08:18.861 --> 00:08:21.110
<v Speaker 1>on your shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or if there's a lost child,</v>

163
00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:23.030
<v Speaker 1>the child's face is on everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>shirt.</v>

164
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.893
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think wearable clothings going to be </v>

165
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.000
<v Speaker 1>pretty big sin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

166
00:08:29.001 --> 00:08:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you could like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could get your arm,</v>

167
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:37.070
<v Speaker 1>like it actually could open up like </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it looks like a screen.</v>

168
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where if we can get that good where </v>

169
00:08:40.011 --> 00:08:40.844
<v Speaker 1>there's no benefit like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nobody wants a cell phone with a </v>

170
00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:44.330
<v Speaker 1>shitty screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

171
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.260
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

172
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.333
<v Speaker 1>Because like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that like the big debate now they </v>

173
00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:51.530
<v Speaker 1>all look amazing to me because I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>blind.</v>

174
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.633
<v Speaker 1>Barely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See.</v>

175
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I look at like the x</v>

176
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.400
<v Speaker 2>versus the Google Pixel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two xl versus they all look really good.</v>

177
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more like brightness now to me it's</v>

178
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:04.681
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

179
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:05.640
<v Speaker 3>this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems brighter.</v>

180
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.220
<v Speaker 3>I guess they all look really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all look amazing.</v>

181
00:09:08.221 --> 00:09:09.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're really nitpick and which is</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

182
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:10.833
<v Speaker 3>Just shows you how good things are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But could you ever reproduce that on </v>

183
00:09:12.541 --> 00:09:13.890
<v Speaker 3>your sleeve?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

184
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 3>they already have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>

185
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.570
<v Speaker 3>Well like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the technology is not 100% there,</v>

186
00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:21.030
<v Speaker 3>but they already have bendable lcds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

187
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:21.864
<v Speaker 3>And like stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is having it feel like </v>

188
00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:27.000
<v Speaker 3>clothing and of like this big chunk </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's on your shirt,</v>

189
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.660
<v Speaker 3>like these things you see at the mall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I like,</v>

190
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:31.610
<v Speaker 3>I had this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

191
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.460
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to Gino speed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd about this and the idea of having a</v>

192
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:36.294
<v Speaker 3>hat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine the hat where you can have any </v>

193
00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:40.590
<v Speaker 3>logo you want under your hat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could change at any day.</v>

194
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.340
<v Speaker 3>And then you can also have it so it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just moves or something.</v>

195
00:09:44.341 --> 00:09:47.550
<v Speaker 3>Like if it's the Nike swoosh you see </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the smoke coming out of the,</v>

196
00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how cool would that be just,</v>

197
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:50.723
<v Speaker 3>and it's weird that we don't see that as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a normal thing yet cause it seems like </v>

198
00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:56.730
<v Speaker 3>that's already there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could do that hat right now.</v>

199
00:09:56.731 --> 00:10:00.000
<v Speaker 3>Probably have a little three g </v>
<v Speaker 3>connection so you can download things on</v>

200
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:00.271
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

201
00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:02.670
<v Speaker 3>using the little thing on the top of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hat.</v>

202
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah you probably could button,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably could.</v>

203
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.913
<v Speaker 2>I mean what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that you can imagine in the </v>

204
00:10:09.751 --> 00:10:12.720
<v Speaker 2>future is probably going to be possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like anything,</v>

205
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.943
<v Speaker 2>anything you could imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's are going to be a </v>

206
00:10:16.501 --> 00:10:17.334
<v Speaker 2>time in our lifetime we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're change is going to happen as </v>

207
00:10:21.391 --> 00:10:22.800
<v Speaker 2>quickly as it's happening now.</v>

208
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.030
<v Speaker 3>What about shoes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where,</v>

209
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.060
<v Speaker 3>where you could just have like instead </v>
<v Speaker 3>of walking your shoes,</v>

210
00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:32.510
<v Speaker 3>just roll in Aleks like kind of lied </v>
<v Speaker 3>along wide.</v>

211
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:33.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well isn't that</v>

212
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.150
<v Speaker 2>WHO's always goofing around about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens?</v>

213
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.920
<v Speaker 2>The aliens are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what we imagined as us in the future.</v>

214
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.340
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's what they really are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that they're time travelers.</v>

215
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:45.803
<v Speaker 2>Cause if he had to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you go back and look at ancient </v>

216
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.833
<v Speaker 2>like Australia pithy gets you ever see </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a depiction of Australia pivotus </v>

217
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.113
<v Speaker 2>it's like this weird sorta half human </v>
<v Speaker 2>monkey things like one of the first </v>

218
00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:01.104
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you go back and look at that and </v>

219
00:11:03.421 --> 00:11:06.810
<v Speaker 2>then you look at a regular person today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that may be,</v>

220
00:11:06.811 --> 00:11:09.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes a spin class and you know,</v>

221
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.670
<v Speaker 2>go see if they go to the one where he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing up,</v>

222
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.690
<v Speaker 2>there's some pictures of what they think</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have looked like.</v>

223
00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:19.270
<v Speaker 3>It's weird because there is people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>look kind of like these people.</v>

224
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:20.283
<v Speaker 3>You sure?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

225
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Some people that are pretty hairy too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they think there's,</v>

226
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.860
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people too.</v>

227
00:11:26.861 --> 00:11:27.694
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that we forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a bunch of different kinds of </v>

228
00:11:29.681 --> 00:11:30.514
<v Speaker 2>people that died off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea is all these people write </v>

229
00:11:34.691 --> 00:11:38.200
<v Speaker 2>all these different kinds of little </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

230
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:43.180
<v Speaker 2>They eventually evolve to be human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

231
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.760
<v Speaker 2>If they stay alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get to a point.</v>

232
00:11:45.761 --> 00:11:46.594
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens if you pass the human </v>

233
00:11:47.651 --> 00:11:49.930
<v Speaker 2>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you just stop at human?</v>

234
00:11:49.931 --> 00:11:52.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you could stop it human </v>
<v Speaker 2>when this is not perfect.</v>

235
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.240
<v Speaker 2>This is not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is better.</v>

236
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.440
<v Speaker 2>It's better than it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

237
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.440
<v Speaker 2>killing each other with rocks in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trees.</v>

238
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.660
<v Speaker 2>It's better than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's definitely,</v>

239
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.553
<v Speaker 2>we're getting better at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's obvious we're getting better at </v>

240
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:09.460
<v Speaker 2>being people collectively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like where does it go?</v>

241
00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:10.294
<v Speaker 2>Does it go to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just move everything with our brains </v>

242
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:13.144
<v Speaker 2>and our heads or that big robot and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck up the environment so bad that we </v>

243
00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:18.910
<v Speaker 2>need sunglasses permanently on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>

244
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.730
<v Speaker 2>And that's what those alien,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the black eyes.</v>

245
00:12:20.731 --> 00:12:22.720
<v Speaker 2>So we just fixed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just give you a fake lens.</v>

246
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.980
<v Speaker 2>Your skin's like bulletproof and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>move everything into your brain.</v>

247
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Nobody needs a mouth anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No sex organs.</v>

248
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.113
<v Speaker 2>It got too complicated gender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the year like this is the </v>

249
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:35.254
<v Speaker 2>machines confused us and got us to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>point where they could deliver orgasms </v>

250
00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:44.740
<v Speaker 2>through like little little injections in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back of your brain.</v>

251
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.023
<v Speaker 2>You just give way more intense orgasms </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you would ever get jerking off or </v>

252
00:12:49.421 --> 00:12:52.540
<v Speaker 2>having sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so everybody just stopped having sex</v>

253
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.630
<v Speaker 2>and you're our dicks and vaginas just </v>
<v Speaker 2>shy.</v>

254
00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:57.213
<v Speaker 2>They just sealed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We figured out food to the point where </v>

255
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:04.890
<v Speaker 2>now there's no more waste,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so no one has has to shit.</v>

256
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:08.280
<v Speaker 2>We just nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's perfect balance.</v>

257
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.740
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever overweight.</v>

258
00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:10.893
<v Speaker 4>It's how they have sex and demolition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put those headsets on and sit </v>

259
00:13:13.311 --> 00:13:14.690
<v Speaker 4>across from each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

260
00:13:14.691 --> 00:13:18.620
<v Speaker 4>They had their feet in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not water.</v>

261
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.750
<v Speaker 4>It looks like water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

262
00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:23.840
<v Speaker 4>It's where they'd girl drips into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so strange.</v>

263
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.130
<v Speaker 4>That's how they had sex.</v>

264
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.050
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably going to be better.</v>

265
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.980
<v Speaker 2>We gave it this physical thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We gave it a shot.</v>

266
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:31.650
<v Speaker 2>It's too costly.</v>

267
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.840
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did the food thing makes the most sense?</v>

268
00:13:33.841 --> 00:13:34.674
<v Speaker 4>Because we are probably going to run out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of food in having like the future of </v>

269
00:13:37.471 --> 00:13:38.304
<v Speaker 4>food is going to be really weird where </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just going to be like almost like </v>

270
00:13:40.381 --> 00:13:41.850
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a break.</v>

271
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.190
<v Speaker 4>Like I vitamin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well there's my steak,</v>

272
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.413
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

273
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:46.990
<v Speaker 2>yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

274
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:48.970
<v Speaker 2>The future of food.</v>

275
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:50.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

276
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Like when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

277
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.123
<v Speaker 2>there was some article it real recent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I think maybe even today that was </v>

278
00:13:56.791 --> 00:13:58.260
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

279
00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.753
<v Speaker 2>their progress and synthetic meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be able to just make meat and </v>

280
00:14:03.241 --> 00:14:06.600
<v Speaker 2>laboratory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is rule.</v>

281
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.340
<v Speaker 2>That's a game changer.</v>

282
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.300
<v Speaker 4>Don't they already have it where you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>buy it.</v>

283
00:14:10.301 --> 00:14:11.134
<v Speaker 4>Now I feel like I was gonna bring this </v>
<v Speaker 4>up the other day when you talked about </v>

284
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:15.790
<v Speaker 4>fat Burger has the impossible burger.</v>

285
00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's some plant based meat.</v>

286
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:19.423
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

287
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.110
<v Speaker 2>but that's dinner lab mate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

288
00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:21.944
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

289
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.830
<v Speaker 2>That's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've had those for a while.</v>

290
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:26.283
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are Vegan who used to like </v>

291
00:14:29.241 --> 00:14:31.700
<v Speaker 2>cheeseburgers apparently say that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

292
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:32.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That you could,</v>

293
00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.250
<v Speaker 2>you can literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

294
00:14:34.251 --> 00:14:36.740
<v Speaker 2>they've looked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's some smart people out there.</v>

295
00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:37.663
<v Speaker 2>They figured out a way to make things </v>
<v Speaker 2>taste different than what they really </v>

296
00:14:39.411 --> 00:14:40.244
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of Vegan cheeses and </v>

297
00:14:42.651 --> 00:14:46.640
<v Speaker 2>shit that are really good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what I'm talking about.</v>

298
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:47.503
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about lab created meet </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual meat that somehow or another </v>

299
00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:52.994
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have some cloning process or </v>

300
00:14:54.081 --> 00:14:54.840
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

301
00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.673
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw something about the other day and </v>

302
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.760
<v Speaker 4>they're pretty much there if not </v>
<v Speaker 4>completed with it.</v>

303
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:01.683
<v Speaker 6>I Dunno.</v>

304
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.530
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they can do that,</v>

305
00:15:04.531 --> 00:15:06.450
<v Speaker 4>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it tastes the same,</v>

306
00:15:06.451 --> 00:15:08.060
<v Speaker 4>I would go with lab created me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

307
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.610
<v Speaker 2>lab created meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably better for you.</v>

308
00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.240
<v Speaker 2>Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

309
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:21.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm just imagining like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm imagining power outage</v>

310
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:27.720
<v Speaker 2>warehouse filled with lab created meat </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck in the pipes.</v>

311
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:30.423
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

312
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.460
<v Speaker 4>do you think the expiration date is on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lab created meat forever?</v>

313
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:35.563
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just engineer it with the right </v>

314
00:15:36.471 --> 00:15:39.080
<v Speaker 4>bacteria so I could stay on the shelf </v>
<v Speaker 4>and definitely,</v>

315
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:40.423
<v Speaker 4>I remember making a mistake that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first time that grocery store I had </v>

316
00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:45.470
<v Speaker 4>these things called the complete meals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck it's called,</v>

317
00:15:45.471 --> 00:15:49.400
<v Speaker 4>but there's like meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a biscuits and gravy but not in the</v>

318
00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:51.020
<v Speaker 4>cold section.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not In the hot section.</v>

319
00:15:51.021 --> 00:15:51.854
<v Speaker 4>And you barely had to heat it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just kind of ready to go meals </v>

320
00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:55.443
<v Speaker 4>and my friend ate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think we both got sick as fuck </v>

321
00:15:56.991 --> 00:15:57.860
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So disgusting.</v>

322
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.600
<v Speaker 4>But I mean they're still out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was seven years ago.</v>

323
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.310
<v Speaker 4>It's like those little meals for kids </v>
<v Speaker 4>that aren't really food.</v>

324
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.470
<v Speaker 4>What's his little lunchables?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lunchables.</v>

325
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.620

<v Speaker 4>That's not even food.</v>

326
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just go off the reservation and get a </v>

350
00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:07.950
<v Speaker 2>fucking cake pop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

351
00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're really,</v>

352
00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.860
<v Speaker 2>they're selling sugar just as much as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're selling coffee,</v>

353
00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.590
<v Speaker 2>which is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you had the Bantam bagels,</v>

354
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:20.580
<v Speaker 2>the Bagel balls or they're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're amazing.</v>

355
00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.253
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to like their chocolate </v>

356
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:28.160
<v Speaker 2>croissants but then I found um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coffee beans,</v>

357
00:17:28.711 --> 00:17:31.320
<v Speaker 2>chocolate croissants to be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>delectable.</v>

358
00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.520
<v Speaker 2>So if I was going to go off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to the coffee bean.</v>

359
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.820
<v Speaker 4>Don't mess with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

360
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.470
<v Speaker 4>don't mess with starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just got it.</v>

361
00:17:39.471 --> 00:17:42.060
<v Speaker 4>You have a relationship at starbucks?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just right next door.</v>

362
00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.153
<v Speaker 4>Every time I get a coffee bean though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you get used to certain tastes of </v>

363
00:17:46.351 --> 00:17:48.540
<v Speaker 4>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if the coffee is better,</v>

364
00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.493
<v Speaker 4>it's really to go like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not an ice coffee in my head in </v>

365
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:53.220
<v Speaker 4>ice coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>starbucks,</v>

366
00:17:53.221 --> 00:17:55.470
<v Speaker 4>iced coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is just like some other bullshit.</v>

367
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.940
<v Speaker 4>Like I went to Denny's the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe the best coffee I've had in a long</v>

368
00:17:59.941 --> 00:18:03.210
<v Speaker 4>time and you can't buy that anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to go to denny's.</v>

369
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't sell you denny's coffin.</v>

370
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:07.560
<v Speaker 4>I was looking for a k cup for it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

371
00:18:07.561 --> 00:18:09.410
<v Speaker 4>they look correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cups speaking</v>

372
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.423
<v Speaker 1>Denny's is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably like the biggest </v>

373
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.830
<v Speaker 1>breakfast chain ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

374
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be,</v>

375
00:18:18.061 --> 00:18:20.220
<v Speaker 1>it's like I hop and Dennis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the two</v>

376
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.090
<v Speaker 1>you could have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like a standard you like,</v>

377
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.270
<v Speaker 1>there's a balance between how delicious </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

378
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.553
<v Speaker 1>how cheap it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be real careful with that </v>

379
00:18:30.121 --> 00:18:31.260
<v Speaker 1>balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

380
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.350
<v Speaker 1>like it's a different concept than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular restaurant,</v>

381
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:38.310
<v Speaker 1>like a regular restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is a regular restaurant,</v>

382
00:18:38.311 --> 00:18:38.941
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

383
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:42.270
<v Speaker 1>I hops a fucking regular restaurant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Burger there the other day,</v>

384
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.740
<v Speaker 1>but even if you eat there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>

385
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.310
<v Speaker 1>even if you eat healthy there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

386
00:18:45.311 --> 00:18:46.860
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up with die off.</v>

387
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because everything is so delicious.</v>

388
00:18:49.351 --> 00:18:53.040
<v Speaker 1>You look at it whipped cream on top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and a menu and those marriage,</v>

389
00:18:53.041 --> 00:18:55.680
<v Speaker 1>she know cherries and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus,</v>

390
00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.880
<v Speaker 1>this is at Ihub.</v>

391
00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.533
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you have that row of syrup </v>

392
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.450
<v Speaker 4>already on your table.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I want to add blueberry taste to</v>

393
00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:03.860
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

394
00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:07.490
<v Speaker 1>If you're gonna just go off ihops the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spot to go off,</v>

395
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.413
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story.</v>

396
00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:09.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

397
00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.213
<v Speaker 1>South Carolina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man hilariously cooks himself breakfast </v>

398
00:19:12.381 --> 00:19:16.520
<v Speaker 1>at Waffle House while employees sleeps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

399
00:19:16.521 --> 00:19:18.160
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

400
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.840
<v Speaker 1>he's taking pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guys just asleep in the corner.</v>

401
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is hilarious.</v>

402
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.910
<v Speaker 1>That is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

403
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:28.783
<v Speaker 1>Is that illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could those guys get in trouble for </v>

404
00:19:30.561 --> 00:19:30.940
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

405
00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.490
<v Speaker 4>Maine taking the pictures and </v>
<v Speaker 4>incriminating yourself?</v>

406
00:19:33.491 --> 00:19:35.800
<v Speaker 4>Probably not the smartest move and </v>
<v Speaker 4>putting them online,</v>

407
00:19:35.801 --> 00:19:39.790
<v Speaker 4>but probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>

408
00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.140
<v Speaker 4>It's like a no harm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no foul kind of thing.</v>

409
00:19:41.141 --> 00:19:42.370
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No harm,</v>

410
00:19:42.371 --> 00:19:44.110
<v Speaker 4>no foul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got hurt in this situation.</v>

411
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.240
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if he put money down now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said he came back.</v>

412
00:19:46.241 --> 00:19:48.310
<v Speaker 4>It says he came back the next day and </v>
<v Speaker 4>gave a $5 tip.</v>

413
00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:51.070
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

414
00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:56.690
<v Speaker 4>One employee working whole waffle house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if,</v>

415
00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:59.480
<v Speaker 4>what if like 10 people walk in?</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 people walking.</v>

416
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.480
<v Speaker 4>That seems weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That seems ridiculous.</v>

417
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.200
<v Speaker 1>I hate waffle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Waffle houses are amazing.</v>

418
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:09.060
<v Speaker 1>You like Raphael good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

419
00:20:09.061 --> 00:20:09.894
<v Speaker 1>If you're on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like three o'clock in the morning </v>

420
00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.230
<v Speaker 1>until like the greatest things that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever existed.</v>

421
00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:15.693
<v Speaker 1>If you're on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like let's pick up some weird spot in </v>

422
00:20:18.821 --> 00:20:21.550
<v Speaker 1>South Carolina or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly where this was.</v>

423
00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:22.960
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's Columbia?</v>

424
00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Less Cold Sea Jesus that was just out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

425
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess</v>

426
00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.790
<v Speaker 4>all the waffle house's in Ohio are like </v>
<v Speaker 4>connected to strip clubs.</v>

427
00:20:31.791 --> 00:20:35.120
<v Speaker 4>So I always considered it being like </v>
<v Speaker 4>gross food because yeah,</v>

428
00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:36.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

429
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

430
00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:40.470
<v Speaker 1>we probably been about 10 of those on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the road.</v>

431
00:20:40.471 --> 00:20:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always like a good option.</v>

432
00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.600
<v Speaker 1>It's also 24 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

433
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

434
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.720
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it gets weird.</v>

435
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Waffle houses get weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>3:00</v>

436
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:59.500
<v Speaker 1>AM New Year's Eve waffle house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All it takes is one crazy person to walk</v>

437
00:21:00.381 --> 00:21:03.280
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guy Fieri era.</v>

438
00:21:03.281 --> 00:21:06.250
<v Speaker 1>I just had to close his restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say that with Glee.</v>

439
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Why do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

440
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I just called Miss Ohio native.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to,</v>

441
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.870
<v Speaker 1>you've got to support your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

442
00:21:16.871 --> 00:21:19.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that that went fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

443
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:22.080
<v Speaker 1>all die theory is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

444
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.440
<v Speaker 1>he's a funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

445
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:25.180
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

446
00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.700
<v Speaker 1>I like how he wearing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like people that wear their sunglasses</v>

447
00:21:27.701 --> 00:21:29.920
<v Speaker 1>backwards on their neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you don't want,</v>

448
00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:32.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't get with him is why so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people get rick a guest.</v>

449
00:21:32.951 --> 00:21:36.520
<v Speaker 1>They don't like that he spikes his hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

450
00:21:36.521 --> 00:21:39.010
<v Speaker 1>what is it that they don't like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just an easy target.</v>

451
00:21:39.011 --> 00:21:42.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he seems nice.</v>

452
00:21:42.881 --> 00:21:44.260
<v Speaker 1>I met him once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was nice.</v>

453
00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if he likes to wear his </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair like that.</v>

454
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like a don king thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I mad at Don King?</v>

455
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:51.670
<v Speaker 1>He can't change his look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's known for it.</v>

456
00:21:51.671 --> 00:21:52.504
<v Speaker 1>Is it racist as a white guy with blonde </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair spikes his hair up and people just </v>

457
00:21:55.511 --> 00:21:57.630
<v Speaker 1>automatically assume you're a Douche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that racist?</v>

458
00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.473
<v Speaker 1>Like a nickelback thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people don't really hate that </v>

459
00:22:00.181 --> 00:22:01.810
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they probably did a little bit,</v>

460
00:22:01.811 --> 00:22:03.770
<v Speaker 1>but I wear my hair like that sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

461
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Billy Corgan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he was trolling or not.</v>

462
00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he was,</v>

463
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:08.733
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking to me about how good he </v>

464
00:22:10.571 --> 00:22:11.710
<v Speaker 1>thinks nickelback is.</v>

465
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:12.893
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

466
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.340
<v Speaker 1>I think nickelback has some fuck good </v>
<v Speaker 1>songs.</v>

467
00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:17.503
<v Speaker 1>I do what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the first day of the main prompt </v>

468
00:22:20.061 --> 00:22:23.270
<v Speaker 1>people had little man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listen,</v>

469
00:22:23.271 --> 00:22:27.440
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy the way that a rock star song </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds.</v>

470
00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.350
<v Speaker 1>I know that's sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a song that's been covered,</v>

471
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:31.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's,</v>

472
00:22:31.341 --> 00:22:35.480
<v Speaker 1>that style of song has been covered a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few times.</v>

473
00:22:35.481 --> 00:22:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I liked that one.</v>

474
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:41.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean I like the Cypress Hill one </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

475
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to be a rock star,</v>

476
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing.</v>

477
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.510
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

478
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.113
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a style of song of </v>

479
00:22:55.121 --> 00:22:58.060
<v Speaker 1>like describing what it's the lifestyle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a rock star.</v>

480
00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:59.123
<v Speaker 1>So the only problem with the nickelback </v>
<v Speaker 1>song is that it had been done before </v>

481
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:02.913
<v Speaker 1>because if it hadn't been done before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did a really job covering that </v>

482
00:23:06.671 --> 00:23:09.430
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like their,</v>

483
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:12.070
<v Speaker 1>their take on it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was good.</v>

484
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.790
<v Speaker 1>It was very polished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe too polished for some people.</v>

485
00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.560
<v Speaker 1>We like Shit Ra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like to hear that Janis Joplin growl,</v>

486
00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:21.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like to heat here,</v>

487
00:23:21.911 --> 00:23:25.720
<v Speaker 1>amy winehouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something we like about that raw</v>

488
00:23:25.721 --> 00:23:29.410
<v Speaker 1>shit to so remind us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remind us.</v>

489
00:23:29.411 --> 00:23:31.810
<v Speaker 1>You're just like us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

490
00:23:31.811 --> 00:23:32.644
<v Speaker 1>I think some musicians have with </v>
<v Speaker 1>nickelback there sort of considered at </v>

491
00:23:35.441 --> 00:23:36.274
<v Speaker 1>least they were and what's called like </v>
<v Speaker 1>an end the box type of bandwidth for </v>

492
00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:40.930
<v Speaker 1>recording purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I They Canadian.</v>

493
00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

494
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:43.990
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is,</v>

495
00:23:43.991 --> 00:23:45.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadians are so nice.</v>

496
00:23:45.771 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 1>You don't</v>

497
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.840
<v Speaker 2>believe him did this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would record,</v>

498
00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:49.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

499
00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:50.230
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

500
00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:52.600
<v Speaker 4>affects on their sounds on their guitar </v>
<v Speaker 4>for instance.</v>

501
00:23:52.601 --> 00:23:53.890
<v Speaker 4>No distortion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no delay.</v>

502
00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.310
<v Speaker 4>They'd record literally putting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>guitar right into this board,</v>

503
00:23:57.311 --> 00:23:58.144
<v Speaker 4>kind of in it record this real weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>electronic sound that you could </v>

504
00:24:00.701 --> 00:24:02.650
<v Speaker 4>manipulate completely in pro tools </v>
<v Speaker 4>later,</v>

505
00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.053
<v Speaker 4>changing everything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were like one of the first bands </v>

506
00:24:06.581 --> 00:24:08.050
<v Speaker 4>that got popular doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

507
00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:11.500
<v Speaker 4>And so that's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure traditional musicians had a big</v>

508
00:24:11.501 --> 00:24:12.334
<v Speaker 4>problem with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't nickelback the band that like </v>

509
00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.300
<v Speaker 4>every single one of their songs sound </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly the same.</v>

510
00:24:16.301 --> 00:24:17.134
<v Speaker 4>Like whiny</v>

511
00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:21.990
<v Speaker 2>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not whiny.</v>

512
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:22.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

513
00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.810
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say whiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say it's poppy.</v>

514
00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:30.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like very good pop music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we'll try and be nice here.</v>

515
00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a lot of their songs,</v>

516
00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:37.103
<v Speaker 2>but I'm trying to be nice here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I understand if people would get </v>

517
00:24:39.661 --> 00:24:42.270
<v Speaker 2>upset that it's not their style in </v>
<v Speaker 2>music,</v>

518
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's people that like like real level.</v>

519
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:49.650
<v Speaker 2>They'll play something for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to play the Beatles like</v>

520
00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:50.820
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

521
00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:51.653
<v Speaker 2>lucy in the sky with diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He put on some headphones and listen to </v>

522
00:24:54.121 --> 00:24:55.260
<v Speaker 2>a loose smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a joint,</v>

523
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:56.543
<v Speaker 2>put on some headphones and listen to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>song that was created by the first wave </v>

524
00:25:04.271 --> 00:25:05.104
<v Speaker 2>of British superstars that came to </v>
<v Speaker 2>America and they're on acid and the </v>

525
00:25:10.391 --> 00:25:13.750
<v Speaker 2>saying about lucy in the sky with </v>
<v Speaker 2>diamonds and it's,</v>

530
00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.040
<v Speaker 4>Just thinking I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to think about this for a second.</v>

531
00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:36.203
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

532
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:42.430

<v Speaker 2>imagine what it was like back then.</v>

533
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:45.713
<v Speaker 2>Imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine being in like 1960 whatever the </v>

534
00:25:50.101 --> 00:25:51.720
<v Speaker 2>fuck it was when all this was going on.</v>

535
00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:59.120

<v Speaker 4>It takes forever.</v>

536
00:25:59.121 --> 00:26:01.610
<v Speaker 4>I thought I was going crazy after my two</v>
<v Speaker 4>stone.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't know how to say the word.</v>

539
00:26:05.121 --> 00:26:06.890
<v Speaker 4>Dear dire maker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you say it?</v>

540
00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:08.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a bad ass song.</v>

541
00:26:08.661 --> 00:26:09.290
<v Speaker 4>I forgot.</v>

542
00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:11.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many good songs.</v>

543
00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.850
<v Speaker 2>There's so many good songs now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the thing.</v>

544
00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:20.060
<v Speaker 2>The songs are better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're better than nickelback.</v>

545
00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

546
00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.950
<v Speaker 2>It's not mold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nick or backs not bad saw that.</v>

547
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.823
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to compare Jimi Hendrix to </v>

548
00:26:27.051 --> 00:26:27.884
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the world's going to suck a </v>

549
00:26:29.511 --> 00:26:30.890
<v Speaker 2>fat deck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

550
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.370
<v Speaker 2>there was a guy that knew how to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>better than everybody else.</v>

551
00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:35.523
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean Eric Clapton wasn't an </v>

552
00:26:38.301 --> 00:26:42.500
<v Speaker 2>amazing guitarist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means everybody always looks at Jimmy</v>

553
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.000
<v Speaker 2>Hendrix in a better way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For whatever reason,</v>

554
00:26:45.001 --> 00:26:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>

555
00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:47.283
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's people that would see </v>

556
00:26:48.241 --> 00:26:52.100
<v Speaker 2>it the opposite way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean nickelback socks.</v>

557
00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.690
<v Speaker 2>They've gotten your man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

558
00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:00.150
<v Speaker 2>Like they just word the Beatles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

559
00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.093
<v Speaker 2>but that's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's a different category </v>

560
00:27:02.671 --> 00:27:03.481
<v Speaker 2>between like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

561
00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:05.820
<v Speaker 2>they Beatles led Zeppelin and Nicole </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vac,</v>

562
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:07.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there is,</v>

563
00:27:07.411 --> 00:27:10.110
<v Speaker 2>but maybe we should just relax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

564
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:10.973
<v Speaker 2>I'll take two smash mouseover I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying maybe we should just relax like </v>

565
00:27:14.311 --> 00:27:16.590
<v Speaker 2>about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're picking,</v>

566
00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.200
<v Speaker 2>we're looking for tribal enemies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't exist,</v>

567
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because you like to eat,</v>

568
00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.660
<v Speaker 2>you know falafels and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

569
00:27:24.661 --> 00:27:26.670
<v Speaker 2>like extra ketchup on your fries and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

<v Speaker 2>take naps.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who cares?</v>

573
00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:34.043
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my perspective in 2018 I think </v>

574
00:27:36.031 --> 00:27:39.480
<v Speaker 2>the more we can relax that we will have </v>
<v Speaker 2>less conflict,</v>

575
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:40.583
<v Speaker 2>interpersonal conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which often fuels extra personal </v>

576
00:27:43.651 --> 00:27:47.880
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 2018 and let it go.</v>

577
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:54.010
<v Speaker 2>You can like nickelback I told somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I like Ellie King and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>she's bad ass x isn't her whole album is</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad ass.</v>

583
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:09.390
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

584
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:11.010
<v Speaker 2>what does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that album called,</v>

585
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:11.993
<v Speaker 2>do you call it an album anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it used to be a c it was an </v>

586
00:28:14.041 --> 00:28:17.040
<v Speaker 2>album and then you were an old man if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were calling it an album,</v>

587
00:28:17.041 --> 00:28:17.874
<v Speaker 2>it's a cd Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it stopped being a CD and it </v>

588
00:28:19.921 --> 00:28:22.110
<v Speaker 2>became an album again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I download it.</v>

589
00:28:22.111 --> 00:28:24.930
<v Speaker 2>I just say I downloaded it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you say?</v>

590
00:28:24.931 --> 00:28:26.930
<v Speaker 2>Do you say you say it's an outlet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Call it CD.</v>

591
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.350
<v Speaker 2>I still say CTA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

592
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I do album.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

593
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:34.200
<v Speaker 2>do you remember when people would mock </v>
<v Speaker 2>you if you said album?</v>

594
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.700
<v Speaker 2>Cause they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mean cd?</v>

595
00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.580
<v Speaker 2>It's his cd now called the CD.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

596
00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:39.121
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

597
00:28:39.121 --> 00:28:39.954
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like a phase where people got </v>

598
00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:42.923
<v Speaker 2>conti about the distinctions between cds</v>
<v Speaker 2>and albums and then all of a sudden </v>

599
00:28:46.801 --> 00:28:50.250
<v Speaker 2>vinyl made a little comeback during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>CD era,</v>

600
00:28:50.251 --> 00:28:52.830
<v Speaker 2>people decided that vinyl was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would you describe a Jamie?</v>

601
00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:54.960
<v Speaker 2>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the difference between the sound?</v>

602
00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:55.853
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's warmer.</v>

603
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.170
<v Speaker 2>It's got a nice warm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you always say warmer.</v>

604
00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:01.120
<v Speaker 2>That eight out vinyl is huge now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So big.</v>

605
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:02.543
<v Speaker 2>Like I went to a vinyl store the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>day that was like being in a record </v>

606
00:29:05.041 --> 00:29:07.290
<v Speaker 2>store in the 70s like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was all vinyl.</v>

607
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.850
<v Speaker 2>What people are digging it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

608
00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:09.240
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

609
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.073
<v Speaker 2>they get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a tactile relationship with the </v>

610
00:29:12.301 --> 00:29:15.150
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what Henry Rollins was explaining</v>

611
00:29:15.151 --> 00:29:17.580
<v Speaker 2>it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way he describes it,</v>

612
00:29:17.581 --> 00:29:18.414
<v Speaker 2>it's really intoxicating because he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>such an an an addict to that kind of </v>

613
00:29:22.291 --> 00:29:23.124
<v Speaker 2>music and he has a whole set up in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>house where these crazy speakers that </v>

614
00:29:27.091 --> 00:29:30.990
<v Speaker 2>are like stupid expensive and he has </v>
<v Speaker 2>this amazing record collection and he'll</v>

615
00:29:30.991 --> 00:29:34.740
<v Speaker 2>just sit there and play his records and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he does a radio show,</v>

616
00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:36.300
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's once a week.</v>

617
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.133
<v Speaker 2>Is it once a week?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does a radio show once a week where </v>

618
00:29:40.591 --> 00:29:44.050
<v Speaker 2>he picks the songs and he plays the </v>
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>

619
00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:49.120
<v Speaker 2>It's all his selections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it on Kr kcrw.</v>

<v Speaker 2>speakers,</v>

622
00:29:55.001 --> 00:29:55.834
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at these things and he stands in </v>

623
00:29:57.671 --> 00:30:00.920
<v Speaker 2>front of these things and I really </v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoyed talking to him,</v>

624
00:30:00.921 --> 00:30:04.090
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's an uniquely unusual person.</v>

625
00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:09.510
<v Speaker 2>I always thought he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am going to be completely honest.</v>

626
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:14.170
<v Speaker 2>When he was a young guy and he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

627
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.420
<v Speaker 2>beavis and butthead thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liar.</v>

628
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:20.110
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why it Beavis and butthead?</v>

629
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.520
<v Speaker 2>It was hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

630
00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:26.110
<v Speaker 2>He had an amazing song called Ama Liar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen rollins?</v>

631
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:27.783
<v Speaker 2>You don't know that song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like one of his breakout hit </v>

632
00:30:29.441 --> 00:30:32.740
<v Speaker 2>songs as a connected with that and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was super jacked.</v>

633
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.110
<v Speaker 2>That was in his full on power lifting </v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

634
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:39.910
<v Speaker 2>And I remember seeing him go at this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like way too intense.</v>

635
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:42.430
<v Speaker 2>How is this a fucking cigarette?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A band.</v>

636
00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:43.443
<v Speaker 2>That guy looks like he wants to rip your</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking head clean off your body and </v>

637
00:30:48.161 --> 00:30:50.170
<v Speaker 2>just pull your guts through your neck </v>
<v Speaker 2>hole.</v>

638
00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:55.120
<v Speaker 2>He looked so crazy scary and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could never figure it out.</v>

639
00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:57.310
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so weird that this guy is,</v>

640
00:30:57.311 --> 00:30:59.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot a singer.</v>

641
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.033
<v Speaker 2>In my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a singer had to be a certain type of </v>

642
00:31:01.541 --> 00:31:02.374
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to be a Jon Bon Jovi or they </v>

643
00:31:04.691 --> 00:31:06.390
<v Speaker 2>had to be Robert Plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had it,</v>

644
00:31:06.391 --> 00:31:07.224
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a style that you could be a </v>

645
00:31:07.811 --> 00:31:11.450
<v Speaker 2>singer and he was just completely new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird thing.</v>

646
00:31:11.451 --> 00:31:14.830
<v Speaker 2>This jacked up power are covered in </v>
<v Speaker 2>tattoos.</v>

647

<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

648
00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:17.853
<v Speaker 2>But when you meet him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe it's cause I'm meeting him </v>

649
00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.620
<v Speaker 2>later in his life when he's mellowed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>matured,</v>

650
00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:27.160
<v Speaker 2>but he is one of the most fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys I've ever talked to.</v>

651
00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:30.760
<v Speaker 2>One of the most absolutely unique </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals.</v>

652
00:31:30.761 --> 00:31:31.660
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I never met one at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy is obsessed with productivity </v>

654
00:31:36.971 --> 00:31:40.490
<v Speaker 2>and work and creating obsessed with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His writing,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he writes for like a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>publications,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It doesn't know where the fuck he is.</v>

660
00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.253
<v Speaker 2>Just puts himself in these weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions and some of them like super </v>

661
00:31:59.591 --> 00:32:02.500
<v Speaker 2>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating guy,</v>

662
00:32:02.501 --> 00:32:04.570
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never met a guy like him.</v>

663
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.550
<v Speaker 2>I heard him on our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's podcast,</v>

664
00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:09.470
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the main um,</v>

665
00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:11.163
<v Speaker 2>podcast that he did that really like </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking blew my mind was him describing </v>

666
00:32:15.341 --> 00:32:18.460
<v Speaker 2>all this travel that he does on Ari show</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you know,</v>

667
00:32:18.461 --> 00:32:19.870
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a travel nut too.</v>

668
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:22.240
<v Speaker 2>So the two of them together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like wow.</v>

669
00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:24.693
<v Speaker 2>I think he probably was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspirations or at least help fuel the </v>

670
00:32:28.061 --> 00:32:30.970
<v Speaker 2>inspiration that Ari had when he already</v>
<v Speaker 2>took off for like four months.</v>

671
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:36.070
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know he was on Ari's podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good catch for Ari.</v>

672
00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.650
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing episode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe they were in Edinburgh.</v>

673
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:41.143
<v Speaker 2>I believe they were there for the fringe</v>
<v Speaker 2>festival in Edinburgh and I think that </v>

674
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.360
<v Speaker 2>our was performing and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

697
00:33:48.561 --> 00:33:50.960
<v Speaker 2>always said about Ari.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like people who just go for it,</v>

698
00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Ra should fear just goes for it.</v>

699
00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:56.270
<v Speaker 2>It takes you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes away for like four months.</v>

700
00:33:56.271 --> 00:33:59.120
<v Speaker 2>He just vanishes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes forward with how he does comedy.</v>

701
00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna go do comedy in China,</v>

702
00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just goes for it.</v>

703
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.670
<v Speaker 2>It'd be funny if when he vanishes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he actually has another life that he</v>

704
00:34:07.671 --> 00:34:08.504
<v Speaker 2>doesn't tell anybody about family kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the husband didn't he have an entire </v>

705
00:34:14.031 --> 00:34:14.864
<v Speaker 2>nother life when you guys did a podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and Ari did Salvia on your </v>

706
00:34:20.571 --> 00:34:24.260
<v Speaker 2>podcast and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way he described it,</v>

707
00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.140
<v Speaker 2>his like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not conflating these,</v>

708
00:34:27.141 --> 00:34:28.010
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

709
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.800
<v Speaker 2>am I confusing this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is when it was the same.</v>

710
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:31.873
<v Speaker 2>He did it on your podcast and then this </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the Salvia trip where he said that </v>

711
00:34:36.141 --> 00:34:36.974
<v Speaker 2>he lived like a whole life for like </v>
<v Speaker 2>three months and there was something </v>

712
00:34:39.291 --> 00:34:41.360
<v Speaker 2>with water in a bus or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

713
00:34:41.361 --> 00:34:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was he,</v>

714
00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:44.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's described it somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

715
00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:46.403
<v Speaker 2>a Reddit Ama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he felt like he had lived a </v>

716
00:34:51.621 --> 00:34:56.621
<v Speaker 2>whole life like for months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a whole different life for months.</v>

717
00:34:57.081 --> 00:34:59.840
<v Speaker 2>And then came back from that trip.</v>

718
00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.330
<v Speaker 2>Like it just happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He realized,</v>

719
00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:02.811
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

720
00:35:02.811 --> 00:35:07.010
<v Speaker 2>I just took Salvia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really got rid of Salvia fast,</v>

721
00:35:07.011 --> 00:35:09.110
<v Speaker 2>didn't they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember when that was legal,</v>

722
00:35:09.111 --> 00:35:12.080
<v Speaker 2>you'd just buy it online and then two </v>
<v Speaker 2>within like a year,</v>

723
00:35:12.081 --> 00:35:12.914
<v Speaker 2>they just kind of took care of Salvia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is little distinction legally for </v>

724
00:35:16.941 --> 00:35:17.774
<v Speaker 2>Salvia now it's the scheduling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went fast on that legal marijuana </v>

725
00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:21.943
<v Speaker 2>but lip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amen.</v>

726
00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.640
<v Speaker 2>But Dude Salvias Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger than marijuana.</v>

727
00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:27.360
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what people didn't know you.</v>

728
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:30.920
<v Speaker 2>People were going to their pot dealers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they trying to,</v>

729
00:35:30.921 --> 00:35:32.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get some good weed.</v>

730
00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Why you want to have a good experience?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Salvia used to be for sale at head shops</v>

731
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:42.540
<v Speaker 2>everywhere and it was one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bolo out of your fucking mind.</v>

732
00:35:42.541 --> 00:35:45.570
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelics you could ever encounter </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

733
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.250
<v Speaker 2>You still buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to buy it.</v>

734
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.950
<v Speaker 2>Careful Times 80 concentrated 20 x right</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

735
00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.830
<v Speaker 2>one 20 eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheese.</v>

736
00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.620
<v Speaker 2>It's even stronger now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

737
00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.560
<v Speaker 2>I bet it's not legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should.</v>

738
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:05.120
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if it shows what states they </v>
<v Speaker 2>will ship to or if you try to buy it.</v>

739
00:36:05.121 --> 00:36:06.090
<v Speaker 2>It tells you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

740
00:36:06.091 --> 00:36:09.840
<v Speaker 2>this is a legal and illegal in most </v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of the world and here's the,</v>

741
00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:12.210
<v Speaker 2>here's the big problem with all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

742
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:16.770
<v Speaker 2>I think all these things could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>handled way better than they have been.</v>

743
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:22.090
<v Speaker 2>So people are going buck wild with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's mushrooms or whether it's a</v>

744
00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:27.110
<v Speaker 2>lsd or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People left these important compounds in</v>

745
00:36:28.081 --> 00:36:28.914
<v Speaker 2>the hands of people that were willing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take them illegally and that's where </v>

746
00:36:31.771 --> 00:36:36.480
<v Speaker 2>most of our data's coming from because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't do any tests on anything.</v>

747
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.880
<v Speaker 2>Everything was just scheduled one </v>
<v Speaker 2>schedule one.</v>

748
00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:40.883
<v Speaker 2>But the people that tested it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people willing to take </v>

749
00:36:44.281 --> 00:36:47.190
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of people did with just white</v>

750
00:36:47.191 --> 00:36:47.550
<v Speaker 2>knuckle.</v>

751
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:52.080
<v Speaker 2>That shit to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me included at various times in my life,</v>

752
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.200
<v Speaker 2>he tried to bring me mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd white knuckle myself to death.</v>

753
00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:58.560
<v Speaker 2>So it was the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only sampling size that we have from</v>

754
00:36:58.561 --> 00:37:01.530
<v Speaker 2>the benefits that people that were wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to do it.</v>

755
00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.290
<v Speaker 2>Like what if we had actual scientists </v>
<v Speaker 2>studying the shit go,</v>

756
00:37:04.291 --> 00:37:05.124
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we took the stuff and like low </v>

757
00:37:06.271 --> 00:37:08.220
<v Speaker 2>doses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could evolve quicker.</v>

758
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:09.143
<v Speaker 2>Like this really might be something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There might be something legitimate to </v>

759
00:37:12.271 --> 00:37:13.104
<v Speaker 2>the idea that stoned ape theory is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans discovered psilocybin mushrooms </v>

760
00:37:16.561 --> 00:37:17.394
<v Speaker 2>and that's why the brain grew like </v>
<v Speaker 2>double its size over a period of 2 </v>

761
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.600
<v Speaker 2>million years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the theory,</v>

762
00:37:21.601 --> 00:37:22.434
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

763
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Mushrooms could have totally been in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that mix with all the other stuff too.</v>

764
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:27.263
<v Speaker 2>All the other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The throwing arm hunting is a film on </v>

765
00:37:30.511 --> 00:37:33.210
<v Speaker 2>the naughty show podcasts for an old </v>
<v Speaker 2>death squad studio.</v>

766
00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:35.003
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it said what happened was I took a hit </v>

767
00:37:36.451 --> 00:37:39.600
<v Speaker 2>of Salvia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't quite take a big enough hit</v>

768
00:37:39.601 --> 00:37:40.434
<v Speaker 2>or I didn't hold it long enough so it </v>
<v Speaker 2>took me right to the edge of </v>

769
00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:45.960
<v Speaker 2>disappearing into my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't quote it,</v>

770
00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.390
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't quite get me through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>barrier.</v>

771
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:49.913
<v Speaker 2>So I took another hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This time the hit was as big as I could </v>

772
00:37:52.321 --> 00:37:53.154
<v Speaker 2>possibly muster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was massive and I held it for a </v>

773
00:37:55.681 --> 00:37:59.340
<v Speaker 2>really long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That hit alone would have been enough to</v>

774
00:37:59.341 --> 00:38:00.174
<v Speaker 2>make me obliterate my consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that hit coupled with the one from </v>

775
00:38:04.801 --> 00:38:08.370
<v Speaker 2>before that all that got me almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

776
00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:09.293
<v Speaker 2>put me in another place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in a lake in the backyard of my </v>

777
00:38:12.091 --> 00:38:15.630
<v Speaker 2>childhood home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't me swimming there.</v>

778
00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:20.280
<v Speaker 2>I was a new being who lived underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took me a little bit of time to learn</v>

779
00:38:20.281 --> 00:38:24.570
<v Speaker 2>how to breathe water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I learned and I was there for a</v>

780
00:38:24.571 --> 00:38:29.571
<v Speaker 2>while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like months at least I estimate I</v>

781
00:38:29.881 --> 00:38:33.060
<v Speaker 2>was there anywhere from four months to </v>
<v Speaker 2>two years.</v>

782
00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.560
<v Speaker 2>I made friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a life</v>

783
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.590
<v Speaker 7>all underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 7>At some point,</v>

784
00:38:38.591 --> 00:38:41.020
<v Speaker 7>my new life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I saw Sam Aaa at the store,</v>

785
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:44.470
<v Speaker 7>at the shore of the lake,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I swam up to him to investigate.</v>

786
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:49.210
<v Speaker 7>Pratt says he was just sitting in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>chair across from me.</v>

787
00:38:49.211 --> 00:38:51.940
<v Speaker 7>In reality,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's when they started pulling me back</v>

788
00:38:51.941 --> 00:38:52.774
<v Speaker 7>into this existence,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but what they didn't know was that I </v>

789
00:38:56.351 --> 00:38:57.184
<v Speaker 7>couldn't breathe air anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've forgotten how after breathing </v>

790
00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:00.904
<v Speaker 7>underwater for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had to relearn the experience of </v>

791
00:39:03.671 --> 00:39:06.770
<v Speaker 7>breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They says,</v>

792
00:39:06.771 --> 00:39:07.760
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that was a good trip.</v>

793
00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:08.893
<v Speaker 7>It looked Talus if you watch the video.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But what's important to understand is </v>

794
00:39:11.751 --> 00:39:15.350
<v Speaker 7>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that the hellish part was not me wanting</v>

795
00:39:15.351 --> 00:39:17.630
<v Speaker 7>to leave my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 7>family and life and the lake.</v>

796
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:20.450
<v Speaker 7>It was just adjusting back to this </v>
<v Speaker 7>reality that hurt.</v>

797
00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:21.853
<v Speaker 7>But the months or years I was living </v>
<v Speaker 7>there with some of the most beautiful </v>

798
00:39:25.101 --> 00:39:28.890
<v Speaker 7>and peaceful of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh Shit.</v>

799
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:31.680
<v Speaker 7>Ours brain broke.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know now.</v>

800
00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:32.573
<v Speaker 7>Now I should look at the video and </v>
<v Speaker 7>imagine that he lived there for four </v>

801
00:39:35.041 --> 00:39:36.440
<v Speaker 7>years.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's totally different when he say,</v>

802
00:39:36.441 --> 00:39:38.460
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I feel bad for getting them into drugs.</v>

803
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:40.603
<v Speaker 7>Look here now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Here's what the four years he went </v>

804
00:39:42.061 --> 00:39:44.220
<v Speaker 7>through,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're allowed to play audio.</v>

805
00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:49.880
<v Speaker 1>The smuggling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still holding.</v>

806
00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.810
<v Speaker 1>He's sleeping or dead.</v>

807
00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:53.323
<v Speaker 7>So this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a video that we're watching that all </v>

808
00:39:55.161 --> 00:39:56.800
<v Speaker 7>took place in Brian's apartment.</v>

809
00:39:56.950 --> 00:40:01.950
<v Speaker 1>I think he's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody give me is fucking funny.</v>

810
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

811
00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:07.510
<v Speaker 7>You had to shush people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

812
00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:10.340
<v Speaker 7>it's like he was chairman heart.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't want him to freak out.</v>

813
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:12.380
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Good call.</v>

814
00:40:12.381 --> 00:40:13.041
<v Speaker 7>See,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm Tripoli.</v>

815
00:40:13.041 --> 00:40:14.900
<v Speaker 7>Shut your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who else was there?</v>

816
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:16.130
<v Speaker 7>Triple anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Aaa.</v>

817
00:40:16.131 --> 00:40:17.560
<v Speaker 7>Jason Teebo,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Alison</v>

818
00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.350
<v Speaker 1>and Maddie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kirsch maybe.</v>

819
00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a great time to trip people staring</v>

820
00:40:22.631 --> 00:40:23.464
<v Speaker 1>at you talking mad shit while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>blown out of your mind into another </v>

821
00:40:26.321 --> 00:40:31.321
<v Speaker 1>dimension grab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

822
00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:40.050
<v Speaker 7>Tell us this long.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I think probably people,</v>

823
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:40.933
<v Speaker 7>because this is all right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can find this is something you got </v>

824
00:40:41.971 --> 00:40:43.440
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It only works visually,</v>

825
00:40:43.441 --> 00:40:45.660
<v Speaker 7>but if you see it visually,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's fascinating.</v>

826
00:40:45.661 --> 00:40:49.530
<v Speaker 7>So it's a Ari Shaffir on Salvia and it's</v>
<v Speaker 7>on Brian's.</v>

827
00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:52.920
<v Speaker 7>Is it on yours or it's on it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So on red bands,</v>

828
00:40:52.921 --> 00:40:57.921
<v Speaker 7>a youtube page,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Ari Shaffir on Salvia Salvias wide every</v>

829
00:40:58.290 --> 00:40:59.123
<v Speaker 7>quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Ari Salvia is why it never did dmt </v>

830
00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:03.780
<v Speaker 7>because I had too many like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

831
00:41:03.781 --> 00:41:04.614
<v Speaker 7>I'm too old for this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I might break my brain moments that I'm </v>

832
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:07.240
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't need to do anymore.</v>

833
00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:08.243
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's,</v>

834
00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.680
<v Speaker 7>there's some weird weird drugs out </v>
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>

835
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.200
<v Speaker 7>Re we're really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>really weird ones.</v>

836
00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:14.633
<v Speaker 7>And part of the problem with like legal </v>
<v Speaker 7>definitions for what what is and isn't </v>

837
00:41:18.781 --> 00:41:19.920
<v Speaker 7>legal,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's like gets,</v>

838
00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:20.933
<v Speaker 7>it gets kind of weird and blurry.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like there was some stuff called five </v>

839
00:41:23.881 --> 00:41:27.120
<v Speaker 7>Meo dimethyltryptamine,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is the most potent form of,</v>

840
00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:32.460
<v Speaker 7>of DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And up until like the year 2000 and like</v>

841
00:41:32.461 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 7>you'd be able to order it online.</v>

842
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.260
<v Speaker 2>They would just send it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's illegal.</v>

843
00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Just says not for human consumption were</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

844
00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:42.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you're doing with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here it is pure and you'd be able to</v>

845
00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:43.423
<v Speaker 2>get enough to blast yourself in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe every day of your life until </v>

846
00:41:47.241 --> 00:41:50.300
<v Speaker 2>you're dead for like 50 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>

847
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.553
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the wild west because people </v>

848
00:41:53.721 --> 00:41:54.554
<v Speaker 2>didn't know what it was yet because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>had made a distinction that n n </v>

849
00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:58.443
<v Speaker 2>dimethyltryptamine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the one that gives you all the </v>

850
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:05.090
<v Speaker 2>visual hallucinations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that was more illegal.</v>

851
00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.830
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the moment.</v>

852
00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:11.190
<v Speaker 2>That was a schedule one drug that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they had listed five methoxy diamond</v>

853
00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:14.150
<v Speaker 2>field trip to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was in this weird state of limbo.</v>

854
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.820
<v Speaker 2>Salvia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just missed it.</v>

855
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.670
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That stuff the fuck outta here.</v>

856
00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:20.930
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it's Smith.</v>

857
00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:21.763
<v Speaker 2>Steagall did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is probably a shitload of those in </v>

858
00:42:22.971 --> 00:42:23.804
<v Speaker 2>the Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's probably a shit load of things </v>

859
00:42:25.221 --> 00:42:27.560
<v Speaker 2>that are not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never been discovered.</v>

860
00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.433
<v Speaker 2>Nini eat some fruit and you fucking go </v>
<v Speaker 2>blast off into the center of the </v>

861
00:42:30.951 --> 00:42:32.240
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>

862
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:35.000
<v Speaker 2>I bet that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet if we could allow,</v>

863
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:38.660
<v Speaker 2>if we all decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

864
00:42:38.661 --> 00:42:39.770
<v Speaker 2>we're going to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

865
00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:44.830
<v Speaker 2>let's have humans live everywhere except</v>
<v Speaker 2>one really big spot.</v>

866
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.470
<v Speaker 2>No people can live at this one really </v>
<v Speaker 2>big spot.</v>

867
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:53.590
<v Speaker 2>We got to manage like other kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ecosystems in a more hands off sort of a</v>

868
00:42:54.321 --> 00:42:55.154
<v Speaker 2>way because we're just so d like </v>
<v Speaker 2>separate like the Congo and places like </v>

869
00:42:57.771 --> 00:42:58.604
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if there was like one country where </v>

870
00:43:00.021 --> 00:43:01.520
<v Speaker 2>everybody agreed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

871
00:43:01.521 --> 00:43:04.280
<v Speaker 2>let's just leave this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave this spot alone.</v>

872
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.770
<v Speaker 2>No one go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see what happens.</v>

873
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Let's see how nature evolves while we </v>
<v Speaker 2>observe it with modern methods.</v>

874
00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:16.190
<v Speaker 2>Just like step back for a few hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>years just as a human project.</v>

875
00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:18.320
<v Speaker 2>Let's see what kind of shit grows in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

876
00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:21.860
<v Speaker 2>If you just leave it alone because we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fucking snippy.</v>

877
00:43:21.861 --> 00:43:24.140
<v Speaker 2>Snippy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me get in there and let me dig.</v>

878
00:43:24.141 --> 00:43:26.510
<v Speaker 2>Let me fucking cut these down and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>plant new ones.</v>

879
00:43:26.511 --> 00:43:28.610
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about it bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm to plant new ones.</v>

880
00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this,</v>

881
00:43:29.931 --> 00:43:31.910
<v Speaker 2>I cut down the forest and put some new </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones on.</v>

882
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:36.530
<v Speaker 2>Not Saying that I'm not hypocritical </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting here in front of a wood desk,</v>

883
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:38.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying don't do it,</v>

884
00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:39.873
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

885
00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:42.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean think of how weird that is.</v>

886
00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:46.830
<v Speaker 2>If we could just leave all that shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>alone,</v>

887
00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:47.843
<v Speaker 2>who knows what kind of weird symbiotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships we could have had with </v>

888
00:43:50.701 --> 00:43:51.534
<v Speaker 2>plants that might have easily been how </v>
<v Speaker 2>they came up with Iowasca in the first </v>

889
00:43:56.461 --> 00:43:57.294
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It probably eating a bunch of weird </v>

890
00:43:59.041 --> 00:43:59.874
<v Speaker 2>fucking plants and all those plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking with all those other </v>

891
00:44:02.341 --> 00:44:03.990
<v Speaker 2>plants and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

892
00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:04.883
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know where we can get just shit </v>

893
00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:07.733
<v Speaker 2>bumping way quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to get these monkey people to to </v>

894
00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:15.300
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to eat these mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 2>and turn it to regular people.</v>

895
00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.530
<v Speaker 2>Imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if that's really what it was all</v>

896
00:44:19.531 --> 00:44:20.364
<v Speaker 2>long just grasses and leaves </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicating to us through some </v>

897
00:44:24.391 --> 00:44:29.391
<v Speaker 2>nonverbal language and and giving us </v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea of how to do certain things</v>

898
00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:31.200
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

899
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.033
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these things are all just designed </v>

900
00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:33.774
<v Speaker 2>to get us to eat the mushrooms we eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mushrooms get to the point where we </v>

901
00:44:36.601 --> 00:44:37.434
<v Speaker 2>accelerate to the point we have enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain power and enough people combined </v>

902
00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:45.060
<v Speaker 2>interacting with each other and sharing </v>
<v Speaker 2>information that we can build artificial</v>

903
00:44:45.061 --> 00:44:48.480
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that becomes the new thing.</v>

904
00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:54.750
<v Speaker 2>Or along the way we become the aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've figured out how to use that crispr</v>

905
00:44:54.751 --> 00:44:58.170
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crispr technology.</v>

906
00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:01.110
<v Speaker 2>You know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's some new thing.</v>

907
00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:03.150
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought up on the podcast a lot,</v>

908
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.310
<v Speaker 2>so if you've heard it before I </v>
<v Speaker 2>apologize,</v>

909
00:45:05.311 --> 00:45:06.144
<v Speaker 2>but it's some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to butcher the definition </v>

910
00:45:07.891 --> 00:45:09.870
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's some sort of a genetic,</v>

911
00:45:09.871 --> 00:45:10.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

912
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:11.783
<v Speaker 2>altering system that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're creating a gene changing system </v>

913
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:20.520
<v Speaker 2>where they can do things to the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>body potentially,</v>

914
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:21.883
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they can alter genetics that can </v>

915
00:45:23.221 --> 00:45:24.054
<v Speaker 2>alter DNA.</v>

916
00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:29.610
<v Speaker 2>It's very complicated and I'm doing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible job describing it would,</v>

917
00:45:29.611 --> 00:45:32.100
<v Speaker 2>it has essentially let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a dumb person like me,</v>

918
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:37.740
<v Speaker 2>really super smart people have figured </v>
<v Speaker 2>out a way to change biology.</v>

919
00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:43.010
<v Speaker 2>They might be able to turn genes on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>off like for autism for Alzheimer's,</v>

920
00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:48.860
<v Speaker 2>like weird weird genes that create birth</v>
<v Speaker 2>defects or various illnesses that we've,</v>

921
00:45:49.821 --> 00:45:51.660
<v Speaker 2>we've been able to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>target.</v>

922
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:55.590
<v Speaker 2>They might that we identify whether they</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be able to target those things.</v>

923
00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.140
<v Speaker 2>They will shut things off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn things on.</v>

924
00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:04.650
<v Speaker 2>And I think there was an article really </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently saying that the original crispr</v>

925
00:46:04.651 --> 00:46:05.484
<v Speaker 2>is now even out of date and the new one </v>
<v Speaker 2>is far superior there did just getting </v>

926
00:46:09.391 --> 00:46:10.650
<v Speaker 2>better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to,</v>

927
00:46:10.651 --> 00:46:13.570
<v Speaker 2>they shot some shit into some dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

928
00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:16.350
<v Speaker 2>there was a guy who had a disease and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

929
00:46:16.351 --> 00:46:18.390
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was an incurable disease.</v>

930
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:22.020
<v Speaker 2>He was the first human recipient of </v>
<v Speaker 2>crispr technology.</v>

931
00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:25.440
<v Speaker 2>That's like seeing it as science fiction</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

932
00:46:25.441 --> 00:46:26.274
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hear about the first guy that gave </v>

933
00:46:27.481 --> 00:46:30.240
<v Speaker 2>it a chance to Chris or Christopher and </v>
<v Speaker 2>2.0</v>

934
00:46:30.241 --> 00:46:31.074
<v Speaker 2>is here and it's way more precise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you could find the article about </v>

935
00:46:34.411 --> 00:46:39.180
<v Speaker 2>the guy that was the first human </v>
<v Speaker 2>recipient for crisper.</v>

936
00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Why is it spelled like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

937
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:44.340
<v Speaker 2>like a 14 year old emo kid wrote in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>basement.</v>

938
00:46:44.341 --> 00:46:49.170
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no e it's a CRI s p r I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think they wanted it to be catchy.</v>

939
00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.510
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's also,</v>

940
00:46:51.511 --> 00:46:53.580
<v Speaker 2>what is that an acronym?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an acronym,</v>

941
00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:54.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

942
00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.210
<v Speaker 2>I always fuck up acronym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other one,</v>

943
00:46:57.211 --> 00:46:59.490
<v Speaker 2>like what's the dea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an acronym.</v>

944
00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:00.773
<v Speaker 2>That's an acronym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was an acronym when you </v>

945
00:47:02.431 --> 00:47:04.950
<v Speaker 2>said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what it could become as a</v>

946
00:47:04.951 --> 00:47:05.970
<v Speaker 2>word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

947
00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it meant yes.</v>

948
00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>NASA,</v>

949
00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:12.510
<v Speaker 2>like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>NASA,</v>

950
00:47:12.511 --> 00:47:15.540
<v Speaker 2>you don't say the n Asa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

951
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:19.110
<v Speaker 2>So what's the difference when those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think NASA isn't,</v>

952
00:47:19.111 --> 00:47:23.160
<v Speaker 2>is that I'm so dumb now that it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird,</v>

953
00:47:23.161 --> 00:47:25.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge and an abbreviated form of the</v>

954
00:47:25.351 --> 00:47:28.920
<v Speaker 2>initial letters of other words and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pronounced as a word,</v>

955
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:29.913
<v Speaker 2>as a word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

956
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.890
<v Speaker 2>So NASA would be an acronym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was right.</v>

957
00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.800
<v Speaker 2>I was dumb as I thought that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>drag,</v>

958
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:37.950
<v Speaker 2>I was super nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>

959
00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:40.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been insecure about,</v>

960
00:47:40.271 --> 00:47:42.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of things like that.</v>

961
00:47:42.101 --> 00:47:44.410
<v Speaker 2>You're probably should know like what an</v>
<v Speaker 2>acronym is.</v>

962
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:45.650
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

963
00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:47.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that any of that shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

964
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:48.043
<v Speaker 4>How do you even remember it was talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about something I saw or was your mind </v>

965
00:47:49.721 --> 00:47:54.050
<v Speaker 4>is more that I saw him planners to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>weekend or is it just came on Netflix.</v>

966
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:55.023
<v Speaker 4>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's this island that only birds can </v>

967
00:47:57.291 --> 00:48:02.291
<v Speaker 4>get onto and honest island is a tree </v>
<v Speaker 4>that has the seeds that um,</v>

968
00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.840
<v Speaker 4>are sticky seeds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they get stuck onto the birds.</v>

969
00:48:05.841 --> 00:48:07.850
<v Speaker 4>And when the birds travel from island to</v>
<v Speaker 4>island,</v>

970
00:48:07.851 --> 00:48:08.684
<v Speaker 4>they kind of drop them off or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But also the seeds can kind of trap the </v>

971
00:48:12.651 --> 00:48:15.230
<v Speaker 4>birds there and they can end up now just</v>
<v Speaker 4>had right there.</v>

972
00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:18.520
<v Speaker 4>They can get die because they can't get </v>
<v Speaker 4>too many of them get stuck in the birth,</v>

973
00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:19.354
<v Speaker 4>gets stuck and then they end up falling </v>
<v Speaker 4>onto the ground and then get absorbed </v>

974
00:48:21.501 --> 00:48:25.010
<v Speaker 4>into the ground and eating the plants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sort of eat them,</v>

975
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.860
<v Speaker 4>if you will.</v>

976
00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

977
00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:29.980
<v Speaker 2>it's kinda crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

978
00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:31.610
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>

979
00:48:31.611 --> 00:48:32.444
<v Speaker 2>is that coincidence is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just like dumb luck evolution I </v>

980
00:48:35.091 --> 00:48:35.930
<v Speaker 2>suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

981
00:48:35.931 --> 00:48:37.370
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

982
00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:41.390
<v Speaker 2>it's dead birds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe evolution is like a word that's so</v>

983
00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:42.500
<v Speaker 2>under fire.</v>

984
00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:43.790
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

985
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:47.120
<v Speaker 2>With the a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is because the,</v>

986
00:48:47.121 --> 00:48:52.070
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ramifications of it that it's,</v>

987
00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:54.740
<v Speaker 2>that we're not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not even going to be,</v>

988
00:48:54.741 --> 00:48:56.380
<v Speaker 2>the final thing is going to be something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

989
00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:57.273
<v Speaker 4>where did Darren does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how he found out about Darwin's </v>

990
00:48:59.621 --> 00:49:02.080
<v Speaker 4>Galapagos Islands where he went the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first time.</v>

991
00:49:02.081 --> 00:49:05.170
<v Speaker 4>Imagine going in there for the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>time and see and all sorts of crazy,</v>

992
00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.050
<v Speaker 2>you know what's really fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have gone there and they go there</v>

993
00:49:09.051 --> 00:49:09.884
<v Speaker 2>with shit in their shoes and seeds from </v>
<v Speaker 2>their shoes get into the Galapagos </v>

994
00:49:13.101 --> 00:49:13.934
<v Speaker 2>islands and non native plants start </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing and they identify that it comes </v>

995
00:49:16.731 --> 00:49:17.564
<v Speaker 2>from literally from people like walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>through fields near their house and </v>

996
00:49:20.901 --> 00:49:21.734
<v Speaker 2>wherever the fuck they live and then go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Galapagos and walking around and </v>

997
00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:26.443
<v Speaker 2>that island is so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been so isolated that it's as like </v>

998
00:49:28.911 --> 00:49:29.744
<v Speaker 2>delicate immune system that they have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>monitor and just the cracking or shoe </v>

999
00:49:33.591 --> 00:49:35.420
<v Speaker 2>could have a seat in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1000
00:49:35.421 --> 00:49:37.130
<v Speaker 2>Do you know there's a lot of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>islands.</v>

1001
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:38.023
<v Speaker 2>I heard the craziest story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a story about goats that these </v>

1002
00:49:42.291 --> 00:49:45.010
<v Speaker 2>pirates was it pirates?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1003
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:48.560
<v Speaker 2>I might've made that part up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these old sailors,</v>

1004
00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:53.030
<v Speaker 2>these old sailors used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1005
00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:54.763
<v Speaker 2>used to bring goats to islands and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would let the goats off so the goats </v>

1006
00:49:57.891 --> 00:50:01.430
<v Speaker 2>could populate the island and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have things to eat when they would</v>

1007
00:50:01.431 --> 00:50:02.000
<v Speaker 2>come back.</v>

1008
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:02.833
<v Speaker 2>Cause goats eat everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goats are savage goats in the sailors </v>

1009
00:50:06.291 --> 00:50:08.810
<v Speaker 2>diet during the golden age of piracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1010
00:50:08.811 --> 00:50:11.030
<v Speaker 2>I didn't make it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1011
00:50:11.031 --> 00:50:14.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm so paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So paranoid being stupid funny though,</v>

1012
00:50:14.271 --> 00:50:15.110
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's true.</v>

1013
00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:16.640
<v Speaker 2>So they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1014
00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.010
<v Speaker 2>show up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would put these goats,</v>

1015
00:50:19.011 --> 00:50:19.844
<v Speaker 2>they would bring boatloads of goats and </v>
<v Speaker 2>does leave them on an island and they </v>

1016
00:50:22.941 --> 00:50:24.710
<v Speaker 2>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next time we're around this area,</v>

1017
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:27.440
<v Speaker 2>we got food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go to these stupid goats.</v>

1018
00:50:27.441 --> 00:50:29.180
<v Speaker 2>They eat everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They eat everything.</v>

1019
00:50:29.181 --> 00:50:30.050
<v Speaker 2>But that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1020
00:50:30.051 --> 00:50:34.250
<v Speaker 2>They eat fucking everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They devastate ecosystems.</v>

1021
00:50:34.251 --> 00:50:36.830
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend who had goats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had goats.</v>

1022
00:50:36.831 --> 00:50:39.380
<v Speaker 2>He has this really sweet ranch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he had goats.</v>

1023
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:39.901
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1024
00:50:39.901 --> 00:50:40.734
<v Speaker 2>I'll just have goats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll trim up the lawn and it'd be </v>

1025
00:50:42.021 --> 00:50:43.460
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the fuck they do,</v>

1026
00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:45.830
<v Speaker 2>they eat everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

1029
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:49.910
<v Speaker 2>They eat that and they need everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else too.</v>

1030
00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:53.120
<v Speaker 2>They roses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they eat all your vegetables.</v>

1031
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:55.040
<v Speaker 2>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not a tree that's growing.</v>

1032
00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.220
<v Speaker 2>They're eating everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just go through a hillside.</v>

1033
00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.050
<v Speaker 2>People use them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have like,</v>

1034
00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:01.213
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like services where companies have </v>

1035
00:51:03.231 --> 00:51:04.064
<v Speaker 2>trained goats and they bring them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your farm or wherever the fuck you want </v>

1036
00:51:06.891 --> 00:51:09.740
<v Speaker 2>to just let these goats Lou.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just like eats everything.</v>

<v Speaker 2>just keep going.</v>

1039

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:16.593
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they had a problem with these goats </v>

1041
00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:23.270
<v Speaker 2>on one of these pristine islands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's too many of them.</v>

1042
00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:24.373
<v Speaker 2>So what they did is they took one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and they put a collar on them so </v>

1043
00:51:29.481 --> 00:51:34.180
<v Speaker 2>they could always locate them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They captured him and I think they,</v>

1044
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:36.440
<v Speaker 2>they snipped him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gave him a little,</v>

1045
00:51:36.441 --> 00:51:38.240
<v Speaker 2>a vasectomy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he couldn't make any more goats.</v>

1046
00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:41.750
<v Speaker 2>And then goats always flocked to other </v>
<v Speaker 2>goats.</v>

1047
00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:44.540
<v Speaker 2>So what they would do is this one guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the collar,</v>

1048
00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:46.910
<v Speaker 2>they would use him to locate the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>goats.</v>

1049
00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:48.500
<v Speaker 2>Then they would gun them all down from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sky,</v>

1050
00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:52.350
<v Speaker 2>so they would fly over and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up there.</v>

1051
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:53.203
<v Speaker 2>There we found him tucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that that gun down all these </v>

1052
00:51:54.621 --> 00:51:58.100
<v Speaker 2>fucking vegetable eating goats at it </v>
<v Speaker 2>invaded this island.</v>

1053
00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a crazy podcast,</v>

1054
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:02.563
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to remember the name of it </v>

1055
00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:08.810
<v Speaker 2>was on radio lab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which isn't even a sponsor,</v>

1056
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:13.870
<v Speaker 2>but I bring it up three times a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Galapagos just called Galapagos.</v>

1057
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it is about that very island is about</v>

1058
00:52:17.121 --> 00:52:17.954
<v Speaker 2>Galapagos and it's about these goats </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they just decided at a certain </v>

1059
00:52:20.961 --> 00:52:21.794
<v Speaker 2>point in time with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to control the populations of </v>

1060
00:52:23.361 --> 00:52:26.030
<v Speaker 2>them or they're going to devastate </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>

1061
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:28.970
<v Speaker 2>There's a massive imbalance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody fucked up.</v>

1062
00:52:28.971 --> 00:52:31.190
<v Speaker 2>They brought goats to a place where </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no predators,</v>

1063
00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:33.950
<v Speaker 2>like goats are supposed to be around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like lions and shit.</v>

1064
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:35.323
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not supposed to be just by </v>

1065
00:52:35.721 --> 00:52:38.540
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just eating everything and going off.</v>

1066
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:40.330
<v Speaker 2>It'd be fun to watch him do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1067
00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:42.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be fun.</v>

1068
00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.840
<v Speaker 3>Jihirah right about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Utuber what he's going through.</v>

1069
00:52:45.841 --> 00:52:46.674
<v Speaker 3>Logan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul.</v>

1070
00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:48.600
<v Speaker 3>I did read that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1071
00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:49.583
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he films someone who had committed </v>

1072
00:52:50.821 --> 00:52:53.280
<v Speaker 3>suicide in Japan and he put it on his </v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube channel.</v>

1073
00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:53.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There,</v>

1074
00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:58.200
<v Speaker 3>I guess there's this forest at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bottom of a volcano or something and</v>

1075
00:52:58.201 --> 00:52:59.034
<v Speaker 3>it called suicide for her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>its nickname suicide forest because </v>

1076
00:53:00.751 --> 00:53:02.520
<v Speaker 3>everyone just goes there to commit </v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide.</v>

1077
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:07.650
<v Speaker 3>And he was going there supposedly to </v>
<v Speaker 3>film how it's haunted and then they find</v>

1078
00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:10.740
<v Speaker 3>a body and it's pretty gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How He,</v>

1079
00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:14.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the video was a,</v>

1080
00:53:14.521 --> 00:53:17.280
<v Speaker 3>he kind of joked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He used humor.</v>

1081
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:21.420
<v Speaker 3>Jamie told me that the thumbnail had him</v>
<v Speaker 3>like posing with the guy,</v>

1082
00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:22.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the background and,</v>

1083
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:25.020
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1084
00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:25.883
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1085
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:29.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know he's a youtube guy.</v>

1086
00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:30.173
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's doing stuff that he thinks is </v>

1087
00:53:31.711 --> 00:53:33.660
<v Speaker 2>interesting and provocative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1088
00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:37.150
<v Speaker 2>and for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1089
00:53:37.151 --> 00:53:37.984
<v Speaker 2>the dialogue that I had read was </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to the likes of that he had </v>

1090
00:53:42.091 --> 00:53:44.100
<v Speaker 2>done it to bring a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll apologize for it,</v>

1091
00:53:44.101 --> 00:53:47.760
<v Speaker 2>which seemed obviously felt terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the way people viewed it,</v>

1092
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:49.930
<v Speaker 2>but that he said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1093
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:52.920
<v Speaker 2>how did he describe it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1094
00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:55.253
<v Speaker 2>he was trying to bring some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thought he was going to bring some </v>

1095
00:53:57.301 --> 00:54:00.390
<v Speaker 2>sort of an awareness to suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like a clunky,</v>

1096
00:54:00.391 --> 00:54:03.270
<v Speaker 2>he just didn't do it right and prayed </v>
<v Speaker 2>the respect that it deserved.</v>

1097
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:04.373
<v Speaker 2>He realized that he fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's basically saying he's trying to do </v>

1098
00:54:06.361 --> 00:54:08.160
<v Speaker 2>something and you fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1099
00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:09.953
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1100
00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:12.570
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just found out that he's not the same.</v>

1101
00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.500
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a Jake Paul and it look and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul,</v>

1102
00:54:15.501 --> 00:54:17.370
<v Speaker 3>I thought they were the same person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why blood?</v>

1103
00:54:17.371 --> 00:54:18.100
<v Speaker 3>Why is everyone okay,</v>

1104
00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:18.933
<v Speaker 2>matt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what anyone's mad at him </v>

1105
00:54:19.931 --> 00:54:22.630
<v Speaker 2>for the mad at him because he showed you</v>
<v Speaker 2>something you didn't want to see.</v>

1106
00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:23.310
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

1107
00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:25.170
<v Speaker 3>Because the video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he kind of like,</v>

1108
00:54:25.171 --> 00:54:26.250
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at his hands,</v>

1109
00:54:26.251 --> 00:54:30.600
<v Speaker 3>they're blue and oh and like kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he kind of was very poor taste.</v>

1110
00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:32.850
<v Speaker 3>He also advertised it like the day </v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

1111
00:54:32.851 --> 00:54:33.684
<v Speaker 3>like I had this crazy sick video you </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys are going to freak out about and </v>

1112
00:54:35.971 --> 00:54:36.840
<v Speaker 3>you should have like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1113
00:54:36.841 --> 00:54:39.810
<v Speaker 3>so he got a chance to look at it and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>still approved it and then released it.</v>

1114
00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:40.663
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he made a thumbnail where it </v>

1115
00:54:41.791 --> 00:54:45.000
<v Speaker 3>looked like he posed for like photos </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a guy in the background.</v>

1116
00:54:45.001 --> 00:54:45.900
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1117
00:54:45.901 --> 00:54:46.734
<v Speaker 3>this was a person and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're like laughing right next to </v>

1118
00:54:49.421 --> 00:54:50.460
<v Speaker 3>this body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1119
00:54:50.461 --> 00:54:51.294
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1120
00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:53.910
<v Speaker 2>but I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that disturbs the shit out of us.</v>

1121
00:54:53.911 --> 00:54:55.520
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like making,</v>

1122
00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:58.230
<v Speaker 2>like joking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could joke around,</v>

1123
00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:00.810
<v Speaker 2>but he can't joke around near a dead </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

1124
00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:03.130
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide's not funny,</v>

1125
00:55:03.131 --> 00:55:05.410
<v Speaker 3>so it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the guy died,</v>

1126
00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:07.290
<v Speaker 3>like natural causes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's laughing.</v>

1127
00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.060
<v Speaker 2>The suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the laughing at him,</v>

1128
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:11.340
<v Speaker 2>joking around near the guy who committed</v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide.</v>

1129
00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you should do it.</v>

1130
00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:14.580
<v Speaker 2>You definitely shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see it.</v>

1131
00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:17.520
<v Speaker 2>But it's Kinda funny that we like </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide,</v>

1132
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:19.500
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just respectful bro.</v>

1133
00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:24.120
<v Speaker 2>But he didn't really do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just showed up and this guy was dead,</v>

1134
00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:25.253
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying he should make fun of </v>

1135
00:55:25.931 --> 00:55:26.820
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We definitely shouldn't,</v>

1136
00:55:26.821 --> 00:55:27.654
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird the outrage that we have for </v>

1137
00:55:29.521 --> 00:55:30.190
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1138
00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:31.023
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he made a shit load of money </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I've got 7 million viewers and </v>

1139
00:55:33.111 --> 00:55:35.200
<v Speaker 3>you made money off it as suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1140
00:55:35.201 --> 00:55:36.690
<v Speaker 3>And you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're talking about it,</v>

1141
00:55:36.691 --> 00:55:37.580
<v Speaker 3>we're helping them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1142
00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:38.443
<v Speaker 3>the video got pulled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I guess I've got re uploaded a few </v>

1143
00:55:39.971 --> 00:55:40.804
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just made a second apology today </v>

1144
00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:46.120
<v Speaker 3>because the first apology a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people said was very insensitive,</v>

1145
00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:47.560
<v Speaker 2>defending him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>

1146
00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:49.140
<v Speaker 2>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just exploring.</v>

1147
00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:49.993
<v Speaker 2>I look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I try to look at things from </v>

1148
00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:54.190
<v Speaker 2>as many perspective as her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ken,</v>

1149
00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:55.840
<v Speaker 2>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1150
00:55:55.841 --> 00:56:00.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that you ever want to make</v>

1151
00:56:00.491 --> 00:56:01.870
<v Speaker 2>fun of someone dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1152
00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're right there and you're,</v>

1153
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:06.570
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're taking videos and you know,</v>

1154
00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:08.800
<v Speaker 2>it was a dead body hanging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a terrible idea.</v>

1155
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:10.340
<v Speaker 3>Now of 20.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was 20 years ago.</v>

1156
00:56:10.341 --> 00:56:11.950
<v Speaker 3>It'd be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably probably,</v>

1157
00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:13.670
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most horrific,</v>

1158
00:56:13.671 --> 00:56:13.900
<v Speaker 3>terrific</v>

1159
00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:14.733
<v Speaker 2>video or a photograph or other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that a I ever saw about the </v>

1160
00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.760
<v Speaker 2>civil rights movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this photo of a,</v>

1161
00:56:21.830 --> 00:56:23.740
<v Speaker 2>all these weird white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like</v>

1162
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:28.260
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's kids.</v>

1163
00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:31.050
<v Speaker 1>I remember counting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might've made that up,</v>

1164
00:56:31.051 --> 00:56:31.884
<v Speaker 1>but I remember these people standing </v>
<v Speaker 1>there while there was this black guy </v>

1165
00:56:35.791 --> 00:56:38.310
<v Speaker 1>hanging from a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might've been more than one black guy</v>

1166
00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:41.340
<v Speaker 1>and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those photos.</v>

1167
00:56:41.341 --> 00:56:42.200
<v Speaker 1>It just make you go,</v>

1168
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:43.790
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

1169
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:46.233
<v Speaker 1>It's holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're one of the most disturbing </v>

1170
00:56:49.001 --> 00:56:50.530
<v Speaker 1>photos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a right there.</v>

1171
00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Like look at that photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1172
00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:53.350
<v Speaker 1>that is the exact photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>

1174
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:57.710
<v Speaker 1>We see a pirate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The must have been something went wrong.</v>

1175
00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Photo actually says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh get,</v>

1176
00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:03.250
<v Speaker 1>that's the real one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the real one.</v>

1177
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the real one.</v>

1178
00:57:05.171 --> 00:57:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Now I remember God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my memory's starting to suck.</v>

1179
00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:10.390
<v Speaker 1>The guy pointing up that looks like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler.</v>

1180
00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:12.850
<v Speaker 1>But those look like white guys too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

1181
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.841
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

00:57:13.841 --> 00:57:15.310
<v Speaker 1>That's round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it.</v>

1183
00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:18.130
<v Speaker 1>The guy on the left that's just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>

1184
00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:21.513
<v Speaker 1>There's something super disturbing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes with those old school press hats </v>

1185
00:57:24.161 --> 00:57:26.710
<v Speaker 1>on staring up at bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging from ropes.</v>

1186
00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't that long ago.</v>

1187
00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:34.350
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

1188
00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:37.333
<v Speaker 1>that's what's horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was less than a hundred years </v>

1189
00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:42.650
<v Speaker 1>ago and it still happened probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1190
00:57:42.651 --> 00:57:43.484
<v Speaker 1>What year was that?</v>

1191
00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:44.843
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1192
00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:48.400
<v Speaker 1>but by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that way,</v>

1193
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:53.430
<v Speaker 1>1930 1930 holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that way was like accepted in 1930</v>

1194
00:57:57.370 --> 00:57:58.203
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>

1195
00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:02.510
<v Speaker 1>All this sun new stuff like this magic </v>
<v Speaker 1>leap,</v>

1196
00:58:02.511 --> 00:58:03.344
<v Speaker 1>these headsets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different things that we're </v>

1197
00:58:04.491 --> 00:58:07.520
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're gonna.</v>

1198
00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:10.250
<v Speaker 1>I think we're in the middle of this so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

1199
00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:14.780
<v Speaker 1>it's not registering is how fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous it is and how insane it is.</v>

1200
00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:15.883
<v Speaker 1>I think we're just so caught up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frothy waves of how crazy all this new </v>

1201
00:58:19.551 --> 00:58:20.384
<v Speaker 1>shit is that we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not really paying attention </v>

1202
00:58:23.331 --> 00:58:25.730
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1203
00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:29.420
<v Speaker 1>this is happening way quicker than I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was going to.</v>

1204
00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:36.450
<v Speaker 1>We went flying cars by now though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's going to be robots.</v>

1205
00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:37.523
<v Speaker 1>Those Boston dynamic backflip in </v>
<v Speaker 1>gymnastics robot's going to win the </v>

1206
00:58:40.741 --> 00:58:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Olympics because other than proven they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do it.</v>

1207
00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Is there any benefit in a robot being </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to do a backflip?</v>

1208
00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:48.173
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you imagine those no benefit just </v>

1209
00:58:51.301 --> 00:58:52.650
<v Speaker 1>to look cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to check.</v>

1210
00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:53.593
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1211
00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:58.380
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if I'm the first robot</v>

1212
00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:02.880
<v Speaker 1>enters into the Olympics and then people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are like,</v>

1213
00:59:02.881 --> 00:59:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1214
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:04.690
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1215
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:05.543
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he just,</v>

1216
00:59:05.610 --> 00:59:08.010
<v Speaker 1>we gave him all the strengths of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular person.</v>

1217
00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:09.780
<v Speaker 1>100% no more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no less,</v>

1218
00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:11.903
<v Speaker 1>and he has feelings too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let them in there and don't be a </v>

1219
00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:16.860
<v Speaker 1>robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phobic goes back to my one question.</v>

1220
00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:19.460
<v Speaker 1>What gender are the robots or the AI?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Females.</v>

1221
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1222
00:59:21.501 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 1>you know what it</v>

1223
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:22.611
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

1224
00:59:22.611 --> 00:59:25.760
<v Speaker 2>they're the first neutral gender people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's so much happier.</v>

1225
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:29.030
<v Speaker 2>There's neutral gender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody cares about gender.</v>

1226
00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:31.160
<v Speaker 2>Just be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all they care about.</v>

1227
00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:32.870
<v Speaker 2>There's no boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl.</v>

1228
00:59:32.871 --> 00:59:35.330
<v Speaker 2>They figured out a way to get past that </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that crispr shit.</v>

1229
00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:36.973
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

1230
00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:39.880
<v Speaker 1>We seen that new sex robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should get that for the stadium.</v>

1231
00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:43.280
<v Speaker 1>All right Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can order it now,</v>

1232
00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:47.190
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want the first models man </v>
<v Speaker 1>funnier that way.</v>

1233
00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:50.230
<v Speaker 1>One of them sharper image besides things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and breaks your desks.</v>

1234
00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:52.273
<v Speaker 1>They don't break you discs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it'd be funny to have the first </v>

1235
00:59:53.871 --> 00:59:57.170
<v Speaker 1>version now had early version before </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have massage chairs.</v>

1236
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:58.263
<v Speaker 1>They just have this actually asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might've had massage chairs at the </v>

1237
00:59:59.991 --> 01:00:00.824
<v Speaker 1>same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they had this thing that you would </v>

1238
01:00:03.021 --> 01:00:03.854
<v Speaker 1>grab a hold of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had like handles on the side and it </v>

1239
01:00:05.631 --> 01:00:07.850
<v Speaker 1>did like Shiatsu remember that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1240
01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:11.510
<v Speaker 1>like little like little metal knuckles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would dig in your neck.</v>

1241
01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is amazing.</v>

1242
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:15.320
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was doing,</v>

1243
01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:16.410
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is this,</v>

1244
01:00:16.770 --> 01:00:17.603
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna someone's gonna get hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>like some little old lady and you've </v>

1245
01:00:22.551 --> 01:00:24.230
<v Speaker 1>forced that fucking thing on their neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1246
01:00:24.231 --> 01:00:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be careful with this thing.</v>

1247
01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:27.460
<v Speaker 1>This thing's got some kicks</v>

1248
01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.473
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best thing I ever found for that </v>

1249
01:00:33.461 --> 01:00:34.294
<v Speaker 2>kind of shit is a time massage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever go get a time massage to stand </v>

1250
01:00:37.481 --> 01:00:39.910
<v Speaker 2>on you and stretch you out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the shit.</v>

1251
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's better than any machine.</v>

1252
01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:44.260
<v Speaker 2>There's something about a person just </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>

1253
01:00:44.261 --> 01:00:48.100
<v Speaker 2>Like getting in there with their elbow </v>
<v Speaker 2>is so much better than any machine.</v>

1254
01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:49.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this little girl I go to and she </v>

1255
01:00:51.291 --> 01:00:52.124
<v Speaker 1>has like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the handles where she holds onto </v>

1256
01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:55.580
<v Speaker 1>and it's just digging her knee and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

1257
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:57.800
<v Speaker 1>And I always say medium and it hurts </v>
<v Speaker 1>like hell.</v>

1258
01:00:57.801 --> 01:01:00.080
<v Speaker 1>I can't even imagine the hard one.</v>

1259
01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:06.180
<v Speaker 2>Ties have so many things nailed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can figure it out.</v>

1260
01:01:06.491 --> 01:01:08.870
<v Speaker 2>The best form of kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1261
01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:11.290
<v Speaker 2>Thai boxing changed everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

1262
01:01:11.291 --> 01:01:16.291
<v Speaker 2>This one small place figured out the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it was the kick people's legs.</v>

1263
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.400
<v Speaker 2>And you know how they figured it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

1264
01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:19.383
<v Speaker 2>Gambling,</v>

1265
01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:24.980
<v Speaker 2>gambling made it profitable to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights all the time because people loved</v>

1266
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.450
<v Speaker 2>gamble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they'd have all these people fighting</v>

1267
01:01:27.451 --> 01:01:28.284
<v Speaker 2>and ties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They even altered their style to </v>

1268
01:01:29.971 --> 01:01:30.804
<v Speaker 2>accommodate the gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the first round they would go real </v>

1269
01:01:34.111 --> 01:01:37.620
<v Speaker 2>slow because they wanted everybody to </v>
<v Speaker 2>place their bets.</v>

1270
01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:38.723
<v Speaker 2>So Pete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would just take it slow and </v>

1271
01:01:39.511 --> 01:01:42.870
<v Speaker 2>everybody knew the fight didn't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>begin to the second of the third round,</v>

1272
01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:44.003
<v Speaker 2>so it wasn't like American fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you'd have like a Mike Tyson who </v>

1273
01:01:46.930 --> 01:01:50.400

1276
01:01:55.801 --> 01:01:56.634
<v Speaker 2>first three rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three minutes of the fight is Michael </v>

<v Speaker 2>retired heavyweight champions,</v>

1289
01:02:37.591 --> 01:02:38.424
<v Speaker 2>there was a trend that existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know where someone would retire and </v>

1290
01:02:42.841 --> 01:02:44.550
<v Speaker 2>then they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1291
01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:47.250
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't keep their form.</v>

1292
01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:49.410
<v Speaker 2>They would get heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that happened with Mike.</v>

1293
01:02:49.411 --> 01:02:51.960
<v Speaker 2>He got like very heavy look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>49 year old,</v>

1294

<v Speaker 2>you realize he like,</v>

1298
01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.390

1302
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:25.800

<v Speaker 2>If I was the guy holding the camera,</v>

1303
01:03:25.801 --> 01:03:26.670
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop it.</v>

1304
01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:29.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1305
01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:32.190
<v Speaker 2>we've got to straighten this whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>out before you start hitting hard.</v>

1306
01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:37.380
<v Speaker 2>You gotta you gotta move all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This might be just a personal trainer,</v>

1307
01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:38.243
<v Speaker 2>not a boxing person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm looking in the background and I </v>

1308
01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:44.520
<v Speaker 2>feel like I see boxing and stuff on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wall.</v>

1309
01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:48.720
<v Speaker 2>They pray that played that video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Young Mike Tyson with custom motto.</v>

1310
01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:49.613
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to change the way you feel about </v>

1311
01:03:51.271 --> 01:03:52.104
<v Speaker 2>physics.</v>

1312
01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:57.690
<v Speaker 2>Custom motto was old and dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a really old guy,</v>

1313
01:03:57.691 --> 01:03:58.524
<v Speaker 2>but he had just this deep knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology and boxing and he trained </v>

1314
01:04:02.401 --> 01:04:03.234
<v Speaker 2>this unbelievably fast and powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>talented kid who had massive hunger for </v>

1315
01:04:07.801 --> 01:04:10.710
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole story of Mike Tyson,</v>

1316
01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:15.240
<v Speaker 2>a lot is wrapped up in the story of </v>
<v Speaker 2>custom auto who had been around forever,</v>

1317
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:19.070
<v Speaker 2>and this is his last and greatest pupil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Mike [inaudible],</v>

1318
01:04:19.110 --> 01:04:19.943
<v Speaker 2>Mike knew it while it was happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the time he won the heavyweight </v>

1319
01:04:21.871 --> 01:04:24.240
<v Speaker 2>championship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>custom mono had already died.</v>

1320
01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:28.500
<v Speaker 2>But he dedicated it all to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was nobody like him.</v>

1321
01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.610
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like,</v>

1322
01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:30.930
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1323
01:04:30.931 --> 01:04:31.764
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he never fought Ali and he never </v>

1324
01:04:32.791 --> 01:04:34.140
<v Speaker 2>fought these guys that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1325
01:04:34.141 --> 01:04:36.360
<v Speaker 2>his era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people weren't as good.</v>

1326
01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:38.760
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

1327
01:04:38.790 --> 01:04:43.270
<v Speaker 2>but everybody in his era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fucked up all of them up until spanx,</v>

1328
01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:46.620
<v Speaker 2>or excuse me until I'm a bust the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hendrix.</v>

1329
01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.430
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1330
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:48.121
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buster,</v>

1331
01:04:48.121 --> 01:04:50.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buster was the first one to beat him,</v>

1332
01:04:50.161 --> 01:04:51.480
<v Speaker 2>but I meant uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holyfield.</v>

1333
01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:53.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how fucked up I am.</v>

1334
01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:54.473
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hendrix,</v>

1335
01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:58.870
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to remember what the fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>was when holy field,</v>

1336
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat Tyson,</v>

1337
01:05:00.631 --> 01:05:04.080
<v Speaker 2>those two fights in a row like that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was big.</v>

1338
01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:07.680
<v Speaker 2>And when Tyson bid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his ear like that was big.</v>

1339
01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.970
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was like,</v>

1340
01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:12.390
<v Speaker 2>when you realize like he's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not the same guy he was.</v>

1341
01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:14.850
<v Speaker 2>We both lived in Columbus when buster </v>
<v Speaker 2>douglas knocked him out,</v>

1342
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.590
<v Speaker 2>that was a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he became the big,</v>

1343
01:05:17.591 --> 01:05:18.190
<v Speaker 2>big fucking</v>

1344
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:19.300
<v Speaker 4>hero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one knew who he was really.</v>

1345
01:05:19.301 --> 01:05:22.060
<v Speaker 4>I feel like when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then he was supposed to take over at</v>

1346
01:05:22.061 --> 01:05:24.790
<v Speaker 4>the east side of the city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was gonna to change everything,</v>

1347
01:05:24.791 --> 01:05:27.520
<v Speaker 4>have a big giant boxing gym and never </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

1348
01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:30.690
<v Speaker 2>We know the story of Buster Douglas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an amazing story.</v>

1349
01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:34.110
<v Speaker 2>His mom died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his mom died when he was in training for</v>

1350
01:05:34.111 --> 01:05:35.020
<v Speaker 2>the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

1351
01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:39.270
<v Speaker 2>And all of his life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had kind of been really talented as a</v>

1352
01:05:39.271 --> 01:05:40.104
<v Speaker 2>boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hadn't really completely dedicated </v>

1353
01:05:41.611 --> 01:05:44.100
<v Speaker 2>himself to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when his mom died,</v>

1354
01:05:44.101 --> 01:05:49.101
<v Speaker 2>he went completely insane in the gym in </v>
<v Speaker 2>preparation for Tyson.</v>

1355
01:05:51.690 --> 01:05:52.523
<v Speaker 2>And then when it came out that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like two people that had the </v>

1356
01:05:55.891 --> 01:05:59.400
<v Speaker 2>exact opposite things happen to them for</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyson.</v>

1357
01:05:59.610 --> 01:06:02.460
<v Speaker 2>He had just been smashed and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>for so long,</v>

1358
01:06:02.461 --> 01:06:05.450
<v Speaker 2>he was so good and so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would win fights for the,</v>

1359
01:06:05.451 --> 01:06:06.284
<v Speaker 2>you could even start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would just be a matter of whether or </v>

1360
01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:10.260
<v Speaker 2>not you are going to make it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first round.</v>

1361
01:06:10.261 --> 01:06:13.920
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes he's just smashing people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for Buster Douglas is like,</v>

1362
01:06:13.921 --> 01:06:18.450
<v Speaker 2>he had some good fights and some bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights and it just wasn't,</v>

1363
01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:20.730
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't completely consistent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was talented.</v>

1364
01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:22.313
<v Speaker 2>But then when his mom died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was right when the time when Tyson </v>

1365
01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:26.250
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1366
01:06:26.251 --> 01:06:31.251
<v Speaker 2>just overconfident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a 46 to one underdog I think.</v>

1367
01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:35.880
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was marketed as Tyson is back fight,</v>

1368
01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.200
<v Speaker 2>which I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1369
01:06:37.201 --> 01:06:39.150
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyson is back.</v>

1370
01:06:40.050 --> 01:06:41.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1371
01:06:41.551 --> 01:06:42.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were the odds,</v>

1372
01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:44.213
<v Speaker 2>because I think it was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>craziest odds of someone who want to </v>

1373
01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:52.140
<v Speaker 2>fight 42 to one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says 42 to one is a law.</v>

1374
01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:57.630
<v Speaker 2>That means you have to be a total sucker</v>
<v Speaker 2>to bet on Buster Douglas.</v>

1375
01:06:57.631 --> 01:06:59.010
<v Speaker 2>But I'll take your money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stupid.</v>

1376
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1377
01:06:59.491 --> 01:07:02.550
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you $4,200</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you give me a hundred you know,</v>

1378
01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:05.310
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're so confident that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyson's going to beat them.</v>

1379
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:08.910
<v Speaker 2>They're willing to bet 42 times whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to put up.</v>

1380
01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:12.090
<v Speaker 2>That to me is always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think bets.</v>

1381
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:15.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm not telling you what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think bet she'd be like,</v>

1382
01:07:16.890 --> 01:07:18.360
<v Speaker 2>I think actually I,</v>

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1407
01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people were a little worried </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the over under for Holly Holm.</v>

1408
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:17.023
<v Speaker 1>Cyborg fight being only one and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think was the over under real or we </v>

1409
01:08:19.911 --> 01:08:21.830
<v Speaker 1>thought it probably was going to go away</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>

1410
01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.220
<v Speaker 1>That's a probably a gambling thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1411
01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Is that it has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it has to do with the,</v>

1412
01:08:27.230 --> 01:08:28.063
<v Speaker 1>where the money sits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

01:22:13.050 --> 01:22:15.240
<v Speaker 1>That's the real weirdness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1732
01:22:15.241 --> 01:22:19.350
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be some and more so with </v>
<v Speaker 1>these fucking assholes on their phones.</v>

1733
01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:22.470
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been seeing some drifters.</v>

1734
01:22:22.770 --> 01:22:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Some people drift in lanes and texting </v>
<v Speaker 1>while they're driving.</v>

1735
01:22:25.951 --> 01:22:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's common.</v>

1736
01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:30.053
<v Speaker 2>But take that away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's remarkable how rarely we slam </v>

1737
01:22:33.391 --> 01:22:35.100
<v Speaker 2>into each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's remarkable.</v>

1738
01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:37.620
<v Speaker 2>You can go years without a car accident </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're careful.</v>

1739
01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:39.000
<v Speaker 2>Years and years and years.</v>

1740
01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:40.553
<v Speaker 6>Fuck man.</v>

1741
01:22:42.890 --> 01:22:44.430
<v Speaker 2>Can I say in this city?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1742
01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:47.640
<v Speaker 2>some remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know they happen.</v>

1743
01:22:48.450 --> 01:22:49.283
<v Speaker 2>They definitely happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way right now they can tell </v>

1744
01:22:52.111 --> 01:22:55.950
<v Speaker 2>exactly what you were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just know what happened.</v>

1745
01:22:57.030 --> 01:23:02.010
<v Speaker 2>But if there's a way that they can put </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those scent,</v>

1746
01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:02.873
<v Speaker 2>you know how they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't they have onstar now and a lot of </v>

1747
01:23:04.441 --> 01:23:05.274
<v Speaker 2>cars you buy him like from the factory </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have that onstar thing where </v>

1748
01:23:08.811 --> 01:23:11.110
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could actually like have comp calls,</v>

1749
01:23:11.170 --> 01:23:15.580
<v Speaker 2>like make phone calls with the whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is on the other line.</v>

1750
01:23:15.610 --> 01:23:16.443
<v Speaker 2>Like you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey can you book me a reservation at </v>

1751
01:23:17.861 --> 01:23:18.694
<v Speaker 2>restaurant?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're also monitoring how fast </v>

1752
01:23:21.071 --> 01:23:21.904
<v Speaker 2>your car's going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're monitoring like certain certain </v>

1753
01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:27.243
<v Speaker 2>metrics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain things they could figure out </v>

1754
01:23:28.601 --> 01:23:30.820
<v Speaker 2>like what happened when you were causing</v>
<v Speaker 2>an accident?</v>

1755
01:23:30.821 --> 01:23:32.490
<v Speaker 2>Where'd you go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where'd you drive to?</v>

1756
01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:37.890
<v Speaker 2>Like if they could track you and GPS and</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a certain point in time they're going</v>

1757
01:23:37.891 --> 01:23:39.160
<v Speaker 2>to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can't we just film him?</v>

1758
01:23:40.490 --> 01:23:42.730
<v Speaker 2>This is going to film you all the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside your car.</v>

1759
01:23:42.731 --> 01:23:44.830
<v Speaker 2>And like if you want to drive a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cadillac,</v>

1760
01:23:44.831 --> 01:23:46.150
<v Speaker 2>don't have any fucking orgies in it</v>

1761
01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:47.553
<v Speaker 1>cause it's great cause we have to film </v>
<v Speaker 1>you because otherwise we're never going </v>

1762
01:23:50.301 --> 01:23:52.640
<v Speaker 1>to know what the fuck you did to cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>his car accident.</v>

1763
01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:55.490
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to get sued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultima bail is the ultimate bill has the</v>

1764
01:23:55.491 --> 01:23:56.324
<v Speaker 1>camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if you're doing the lane </v>

1765
01:23:57.771 --> 01:23:58.604
<v Speaker 1>departure setting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it detects if you're not paying </v>

1766
01:24:00.861 --> 01:24:04.670
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then by tracking your face,</v>

1767
01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:07.280
<v Speaker 1>so there's a camera and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>oldsmobiles now.</v>

1768
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's sort of like the iphone x or</v>

1769
01:24:10.251 --> 01:24:12.410
<v Speaker 1>10 right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sees your face,</v>

1770
01:24:12.510 --> 01:24:13.343
<v Speaker 1>recognize your face to open up your a </v>
<v Speaker 1>password and it works pretty fucking </v>

1771
01:24:16.161 --> 01:24:17.660
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not perfect,</v>

1772
01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:18.553
<v Speaker 1>but it's like whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot better than I thought it was </v>

1773
01:24:20.001 --> 01:24:23.540
<v Speaker 1>going to be a lot smoother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this phone when I couldn't find my</v>

1774
01:24:23.541 --> 01:24:24.374
<v Speaker 1>glasses and I found them the other day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have a beard now and add a </v>

1775
01:24:26.991 --> 01:24:28.850
<v Speaker 1>stocking hat on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still unlocks it.</v>

1776
01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:31.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like how the hell does it go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through all those things.</v>

1777
01:24:31.730 --> 01:24:35.120
<v Speaker 1>What would change if someone gained or </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost weight?</v>

1778
01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Would anything change?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1779
01:24:37.341 --> 01:24:40.160
<v Speaker 1>I think the texts like how far your eyes</v>
<v Speaker 1>are a part,</v>

1780
01:24:40.161 --> 01:24:41.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like little things like that.</v>

1781
01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:42.643
<v Speaker 1>Like I think my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's weird is I have a Amazon Echo in </v>

1782
01:24:46.431 --> 01:24:49.300
<v Speaker 1>my next to my bed now cause it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best alarm clock average.</v>

1783
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Like it's one of those things where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>go like Alexa,</v>

1784
01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:53.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1785
01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:55.400
<v Speaker 1>but it has a camera on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1786
01:24:55.401 --> 01:24:56.840
<v Speaker 1>It's watching them for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1787
01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is watching your your whole life.</v>

1788
01:24:59.850 --> 01:25:00.683
<v Speaker 1>I'm like keep an eye on me Alexa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you beat off Alexa makes a </v>

1789
01:25:03.891 --> 01:25:06.710
<v Speaker 1>checkmark right next to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is weird though.</v>

1790
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Like we'll be just sleeping all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>night and Alexa will just be like,</v>

1791
01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:11.840
<v Speaker 1>I can't understand what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1792
01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.160
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I didn't say anything.</v>

1793
01:25:13.610 --> 01:25:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Luxembourg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll just start coming to life.</v>

1794
01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:19.610
<v Speaker 1>She's starting to wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's becoming more woke.</v>

1795
01:25:19.611 --> 01:25:24.611
<v Speaker 1>To me the best is if you go Alexa rap </v>
<v Speaker 1>and does this wrap,</v>

1796
01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:28.640
<v Speaker 1>it's could do a wrap and it's a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>rap.</v>

1797
01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking before the podcast,</v>

1798
01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:32.010
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1799
01:25:32.090 --> 01:25:32.923
<v Speaker 1>it's a good rap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking before the podcast is </v>

1800
01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:39.290
<v Speaker 1>there was something about an apple </v>
<v Speaker 1>buying Netflix when Jesus,</v>

1801
01:25:39.291 --> 01:25:40.124
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about a company that </v>

1802
01:25:40.881 --> 01:25:41.714
<v Speaker 1>gets that big?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you feel about like any </v>

1803
01:25:43.521 --> 01:25:45.680
<v Speaker 1>company that does a buys up everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1804
01:25:45.681 --> 01:25:46.850
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disney,</v>

1805
01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Disney bought up star wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

1806
01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:51.113
<v Speaker 1>They buy out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't they just buy the other movie </v>

1807
01:25:52.641 --> 01:25:53.970
<v Speaker 1>studio owns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1808
01:25:54.170 --> 01:25:56.800
<v Speaker 1>the avengers or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pmr.</v>

1809
01:25:57.070 --> 01:25:57.903
<v Speaker 1>Paramont I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there were a lot of </v>

1810
01:25:59.451 --> 01:26:02.840
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$52 billion to buy 21st century.</v>

1811
01:26:03.490 --> 01:26:04.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now like the Marvel Universe is </v>

1812
01:26:06.381 --> 01:26:09.500
<v Speaker 1>complete I think now is it bad?</v>

1813
01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:12.990
<v Speaker 2>Is it bad to have giant companies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people would say yes.</v>

1814
01:26:12.991 --> 01:26:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about a giant company?</v>

1815
01:26:14.551 --> 01:26:17.520
<v Speaker 2>Like Google seems to be a pretty God </v>
<v Speaker 2>damn good company.</v>

1816
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Like as far as like the way they treat </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1817
01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:25.260
<v Speaker 2>it's supposed to be like pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than that James Damore memo thing,</v>

1818
01:26:25.261 --> 01:26:28.740
<v Speaker 2>that the thing that went out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember that that whole,</v>

1819
01:26:28.741 --> 01:26:29.574
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the guy was talking about why </v>

1820
01:26:30.691 --> 01:26:33.150
<v Speaker 2>there aren't women in tech and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>would encourage them.</v>

1821
01:26:33.151 --> 01:26:35.730
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people said he was sexist </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it got crazy and I was like,</v>

1822
01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:37.920
<v Speaker 2>then I had to read it like a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>times ago.</v>

1823
01:26:38.670 --> 01:26:41.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like one or two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be misconstrued as being sexist</v>

1824
01:26:41.521 --> 01:26:44.550
<v Speaker 2>because of the term neuroticism and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he believes,</v>

1825
01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:49.020
<v Speaker 2>I believe he uses the term neurotic but </v>
<v Speaker 2>really super duper controversial fucking</v>

1826
01:26:49.021 --> 01:26:52.050
<v Speaker 2>thing and although I don't agree with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1827
01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:54.420
<v Speaker 2>Google firing the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of get it.</v>

1828
01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:57.480
<v Speaker 2>I get where they are just to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>calm everyone's nerves.</v>

1829
01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:59.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with that at all,</v>

1830
01:26:59.370 --> 01:27:02.190
<v Speaker 2>but I understand why they as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporation would think that way,</v>

1831
01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:06.180
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part I seem to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like what they're doing.</v>

1832
01:27:06.210 --> 01:27:09.420
<v Speaker 2>Like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're buying up all these robotics and</v>

1833
01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:13.560
<v Speaker 2>these different corporations that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating the google.</v>

1834
01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Didn't Google buy up Boston</v>

1835
01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:16.800
<v Speaker 1>dynamics already sold it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1836
01:27:16.801 --> 01:27:18.540
<v Speaker 1>they sold it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They bought it and then sold it.</v>

1837
01:27:18.541 --> 01:27:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Still all the secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1838
01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:21.053
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's what they do because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't hear about the sale when they </v>

1839
01:27:22.681 --> 01:27:23.880
<v Speaker 1>get rid of something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1840
01:27:24.330 --> 01:27:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Purchase requisite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1841
01:27:25.291 --> 01:27:28.520
<v Speaker 1>You sell it and then you make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't sign some sort of uh,</v>

1842
01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:29.813
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>noncompete clause and could have often </v>

1843
01:27:31.081 --> 01:27:33.570
<v Speaker 1>done it to buy a purse and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>might've been someone working there they</v>

1844
01:27:33.571 --> 01:27:35.280
<v Speaker 1>wanted to have on their team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they just,</v>

1845
01:27:35.310 --> 01:27:36.143
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well by your whole company now you work </v>

1846
01:27:36.961 --> 01:27:37.990
<v Speaker 1>for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1847
01:27:38.370 --> 01:27:41.550
<v Speaker 1>that's some fucking game of thrones type</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit with silicone.</v>

1848
01:27:41.970 --> 01:27:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Disney was smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dubai,</v>

1849
01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Hulu because they just pulled all their </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff off and Netflix,</v>

1850
01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:48.053
<v Speaker 1>all Disney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Disney often flood and now </v>

1851
01:27:50.671 --> 01:27:51.960
<v Speaker 1>they're just going to put it all on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hulu,</v>

1852
01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:54.810
<v Speaker 1>which is awesome cause I left Hulu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing,</v>

1853
01:27:54.850 --> 01:27:56.620
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like is that,</v>

1854
01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:57.513
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it possible to be as big as Google </v>

1855
01:28:00.490 --> 01:28:03.380
<v Speaker 2>and not be scary?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1856
01:28:03.390 --> 01:28:06.080
<v Speaker 2>And when something gets so big that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>controls so much,</v>

1857
01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:08.870
<v Speaker 2>people like tend to just immediately get</v>
<v Speaker 2>wary.</v>

1858
01:28:08.871 --> 01:28:11.360
<v Speaker 2>Like whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is the whole market,</v>

1859
01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.273
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's only one way you can get the </v>

1860
01:28:14.271 --> 01:28:17.960
<v Speaker 2>Internet for verizon was the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet provider on planet earth,</v>

1861
01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.131
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd be like,</v>

1862
01:28:19.131 --> 01:28:21.470
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just you,</v>

1863
01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:25.760
<v Speaker 2>just you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if that's that because it's too big,</v>

1864
01:28:25.761 --> 01:28:27.050
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Controls too much.</v>

1865
01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:32.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like what's the level we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with apple,</v>

1866
01:28:32.910 --> 01:28:34.790
<v Speaker 1>with apple?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the company also,</v>

1867
01:28:34.791 --> 01:28:35.511
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1868
01:28:35.511 --> 01:28:38.150
<v Speaker 1>like I think a lot of people trust </v>
<v Speaker 1>Google and apple.</v>

1869
01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Apple put the nets over the buildings </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the people were jumping and did the</v>

1870
01:28:40.761 --> 01:28:43.190
<v Speaker 1>right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't think with the batteries they</v>

1871
01:28:43.191 --> 01:28:44.024
<v Speaker 1>did the response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to see that battery thing is </v>

1872
01:28:46.371 --> 01:28:47.670
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to talk about that.</v>

1873
01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:51.590
<v Speaker 1>How many years ago did we start talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about who called?</v>

1874
01:28:51.930 --> 01:28:52.763
<v Speaker 1>You called it in like whatever the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>year of the fucking knew it was when </v>

1875
01:28:57.111 --> 01:28:58.640
<v Speaker 1>they had a new iphone and then the new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1876
01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:01.860
<v Speaker 1>new new iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as the new new iphone came out,</v>

1877
01:29:01.861 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

1878
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:02.813
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what these mother fuckers are </v>

1879
01:29:03.511 --> 01:29:04.344
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1880
01:29:04.450 --> 01:29:05.283
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I get their excuse and it wasn't </v>

1881
01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:06.790
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1882
01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:09.340
<v Speaker 2>to lock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might've been like two I phones and I</v>

1883
01:29:09.341 --> 01:29:10.900
<v Speaker 2>want to be honest about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

1884
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:14.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I remember there was a time that you</v>

1885
01:29:14.291 --> 01:29:15.940
<v Speaker 2>called it first way before everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

1886
01:29:15.941 --> 01:29:18.160
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian's all paranoid about technology.</v>

1887
01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:22.850
<v Speaker 3>I understand their excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I get what they're saying.</v>

1888
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.863
<v Speaker 3>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the batteries are going to start </v>

1889
01:29:25.401 --> 01:29:26.520
<v Speaker 3>failing because it's,</v>

1890
01:29:26.610 --> 01:29:30.120
<v Speaker 2>you can't have the is all fucked up in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>battery.</v>

1891
01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:31.313
<v Speaker 2>But to deny that they know that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>throttling down of performance of the </v>

1892
01:29:35.101 --> 01:29:38.670
<v Speaker 2>phone's not going to influence people </v>
<v Speaker 2>into deciding,</v>

1893
01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:41.160
<v Speaker 2>deciding to buy a new phone is </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>

1894
01:29:41.161 --> 01:29:41.741
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>

1895
01:29:41.741 --> 01:29:44.140
<v Speaker 2>You are literally disabling the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

1896
01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:47.580
<v Speaker 2>and you're not doing your customer </v>
<v Speaker 2>service base.</v>

1897
01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:51.240
<v Speaker 2>You're not doing them a service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you were,</v>

1898
01:29:51.241 --> 01:29:54.360
<v Speaker 2>if you really cared about them getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best stuff all the time,</v>

1899
01:29:54.361 --> 01:29:57.180
<v Speaker 2>what you would do is he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1900
01:29:57.780 --> 01:30:00.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these batteries are going to get older.</v>

1901
01:30:00.481 --> 01:30:01.314
<v Speaker 2>If you want to continue your phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a new battery to reasonable rate </v>

1902
01:30:04.350 --> 01:30:08.220
<v Speaker 2>other wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to throttle down the performance</v>

1903
01:30:08.221 --> 01:30:10.710
<v Speaker 2>of your phone so that you can get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>day's use out of it.</v>

1904
01:30:11.490 --> 01:30:14.700
<v Speaker 2>But that can be avoided by simply </v>
<v Speaker 2>swapping out the battery.</v>

1905
01:30:15.330 --> 01:30:17.610
<v Speaker 2>So this is what happens when your phone </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets to be a year old yet</v>

1906
01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:19.900
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's sort of disingenuous.</v>

1907
01:30:19.901 --> 01:30:21.580
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the batteries were so expensive.</v>

1908
01:30:21.581 --> 01:30:23.550
<v Speaker 3>Now I think they got them down to $29</v>

1909
01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:27.690
<v Speaker 2>but that's just in response to getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this situation right now.</v>

1910
01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:32.300
<v Speaker 2>I think they make amazing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This iphone 10 x,</v>

1911
01:30:32.301 --> 01:30:34.650
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck they want to call it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

1912
01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:35.653
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy that there's a company that </v>

1913
01:30:36.621 --> 01:30:39.050
<v Speaker 2>makes something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to make some mistakes.</v>

1914
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:42.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who approved that mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a mistake.</v>

1915
01:30:42.651 --> 01:30:45.830
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the stuff they make is,</v>

1916
01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:47.083
<v Speaker 2>it's someone's got to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be like the Brian and </v>

1917
01:30:49.221 --> 01:30:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Joe Corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1918
01:30:50.530 --> 01:30:51.363
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you need something with massive </v>

1919
01:30:53.721 --> 01:30:54.554
<v Speaker 2>resources and a ton of shit fuck ton of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to be able to put together the </v>

1920
01:30:58.311 --> 01:30:59.144
<v Speaker 2>cash to make an iphone 10 I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to hire a lot of fucking people </v>

1921
01:31:04.401 --> 01:31:05.234
<v Speaker 2>to make this thing right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a higher wizards and sorcerers </v>

1922
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.903
<v Speaker 2>and God damn silicone geniuses and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people know how to get lithium ion </v>

1923
01:31:16.551 --> 01:31:20.360
<v Speaker 2>batteries thinner than your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>fingernail in these things.</v>

1924
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Nothing in your fingernail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right at the end of that,</v>

1925
01:31:22.281 --> 01:31:23.450
<v Speaker 2>a finger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's like,</v>

1926
01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:24.460
<v Speaker 2>how thick is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1927
01:31:24.461 --> 01:31:26.570
<v Speaker 2>it can't be that thick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shit has a case on it.</v>

1928
01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:30.380
<v Speaker 2>Like how thin is a a battery and a cell </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone?</v>

1929
01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:35.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a pretty thin like paper chip or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>potato chip rather like a flat potato.</v>

1930
01:31:37.101 --> 01:31:38.990
<v Speaker 2>If you ever could flatten out a potato </v>
<v Speaker 2>chip,</v>

1931
01:31:40.290 --> 01:31:41.820
<v Speaker 3>it's a little thicker than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>

1932
01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:43.553
<v Speaker 3>What's crazy though is that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the the phone before this iphone seven </v>

1933
01:31:46.410 --> 01:31:49.530
<v Speaker 3>plus s whatever the fuck it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we owe debt,</v>

1934
01:31:49.950 --> 01:31:52.200
<v Speaker 3>when I download the new operating system</v>
<v Speaker 3>on it,</v>

1935
01:31:52.201 --> 01:31:53.880
<v Speaker 3>it was crashy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was buggy.</v>

1936
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:56.730
<v Speaker 3>It fucked up all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then when I got the iphone x,</v>

1937
01:31:56.731 --> 01:31:58.980
<v Speaker 3>the same operating system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it worked way better.</v>

1938
01:31:59.230 --> 01:32:02.290
<v Speaker 3>So that's like not anything to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the battery,</v>

1939
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:03.303
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just because they build an </v>

1940
01:32:04.091 --> 01:32:04.924
<v Speaker 3>operating system around this processor </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this screen and all the components </v>

1941
01:32:08.141 --> 01:32:11.080
<v Speaker 3>on this and then they're emulating it </v>
<v Speaker 3>for all the other phones,</v>

1942
01:32:11.081 --> 01:32:12.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever they're doing.</v>

1943
01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:14.140
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like</v>

1944
01:32:14.250 --> 01:32:16.530
<v Speaker 2>the only way to be truly awesome at </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1945
01:32:16.531 --> 01:32:21.531
<v Speaker 2>That's just to be greedy too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they got to have like,</v>

1946
01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:23.820
<v Speaker 2>we'll get a fuel this motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1947
01:32:23.850 --> 01:32:24.451
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

1948
01:32:24.451 --> 01:32:25.780
<v Speaker 2>this is projected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1949
01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:28.110
<v Speaker 2>sales and we can get that up to about </v>
<v Speaker 2>20%.</v>

1950
01:32:28.111 --> 01:32:28.944
<v Speaker 2>And this is how we're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have the dark secret meetings </v>

1951
01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:34.890
<v Speaker 2>where they can just add candles?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went into the fucking basement.</v>

1952
01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:36.540
<v Speaker 2>Nicole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're to slow down the old phones.</v>

1953
01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:38.700
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do it.</v>

1954
01:32:38.701 --> 01:32:39.534
<v Speaker 2>Mark watching for technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've always worked for technology and </v>

1955
01:32:43.171 --> 01:32:45.300
<v Speaker 2>we can't slow down the fucking phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1956

<v Speaker 2>of falls apart,</v>

1982
01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:45.710
<v Speaker 2>but then it bounces back strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very funny again now.</v>

1983

<v Speaker 3>you know Carl pink pig crow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pinkerton.</v>

1988
01:33:57.830 --> 01:34:00.370

<v Speaker 3>Supposedly two things.</v>

1989
01:34:00.371 --> 01:34:03.880
<v Speaker 3>I am two different episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talks about something that they stole</v>

1990
01:34:03.881 --> 01:34:06.880
<v Speaker 3>in Black Mirror and ou,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is weird.</v>

1991
01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:08.140
<v Speaker 3>It was in the news today.</v>

1992
01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:09.880
<v Speaker 2>Um hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1993
01:34:09.881 --> 01:34:12.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the specifics are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't want to comment,</v>

1994
01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:13.263
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things that black </v>

1995
01:34:16.271 --> 01:34:18.460
<v Speaker 2>mirror did his subjects that I talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about too,</v>

1996
01:34:18.461 --> 01:34:19.294
<v Speaker 2>but it was just because a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>were talking about potential future </v>

1997
01:34:22.301 --> 01:34:23.134
<v Speaker 2>technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this video game thing where they </v>

1998
01:34:25.091 --> 01:34:25.924
<v Speaker 2>put something in the back of your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Matrix and plug you into some </v>

1999
01:34:28.511 --> 01:34:31.420
<v Speaker 2>artificial experience that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>indistinguishable.</v>

2000
01:34:31.630 --> 01:34:32.463
<v Speaker 2>That's what those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about that a hundred times </v>

2001
01:34:34.090 --> 01:34:35.740
<v Speaker 2>just from being high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2002
01:34:35.741 --> 01:34:36.574
<v Speaker 2>and thinking about what are they going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to do next that's crazier </v>

2003
01:34:39.131 --> 01:34:42.610
<v Speaker 2>than a Duncan trussell when he had that </v>
<v Speaker 2>htc vive,</v>

2004
01:34:43.170 --> 01:34:45.050

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2011
01:34:56.050 --> 01:34:56.883

<v Speaker 2>figure out what's next or are they </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2072
01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:40.580
<v Speaker 2>But people that go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2073
01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:44.700
<v Speaker 2>the New York Times is fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they've been around for so long.</v>

2074
01:37:44.701 --> 01:37:47.070
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how much important shit they</v>
<v Speaker 2>put out?</v>

2075
01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:49.440
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to just dismiss them </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you love trump,</v>

2076
01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:50.910
<v Speaker 2>is that you're really willing to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2077
01:37:51.570 --> 01:37:52.403
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's as crazy as anything I've ever </v>

2078
01:37:53.461 --> 01:37:54.930
<v Speaker 2>heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>

2079
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Like they can't be exonerated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2080
01:37:57.790 --> 01:37:58.623
<v Speaker 2>they can be exonerated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can't be exempt from not being </v>

2081
01:38:01.681 --> 01:38:04.020
<v Speaker 2>called out by printing something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

2082
01:38:04.170 --> 01:38:05.003
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone should be held up the same </v>

2083
01:38:06.031 --> 01:38:08.260
<v Speaker 2>standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't appreciate what the,</v>

2084
01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:11.370
<v Speaker 2>The New York Times has done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems crazy to me.</v>

2085
01:38:12.090 --> 01:38:14.790
<v Speaker 2>It's just they're really important.</v>

2086
01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:19.740
<v Speaker 4>Could you see all the trump like global </v>
<v Speaker 4>warming tweets?</v>

2087
01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:22.010
<v Speaker 4>Like he doesn't really understand global</v>
<v Speaker 4>warming.</v>

2088
01:38:22.011 --> 01:38:25.650
<v Speaker 4>He's trolling scientist wake up freezing</v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

2089
01:38:25.651 --> 01:38:28.230
<v Speaker 4>Global warming's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's 70 and he's,</v>

2090
01:38:28.410 --> 01:38:31.230
<v Speaker 4>he's trolling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2091
01:38:31.231 --> 01:38:31.951
<v Speaker 4>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2092
01:38:31.951 --> 01:38:33.840
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish the whole thing was a trawl.</v>

2093
01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:36.060
<v Speaker 4>That'd be so fucking know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's trolling about that though.</v>

2094
01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:37.143
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just doesn't want anybody fucking </v>

2095
01:38:37.601 --> 01:38:39.850
<v Speaker 2>with them and he feels like a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream media,</v>

2096
01:38:39.851 --> 01:38:42.820
<v Speaker 2>they fuck with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he fires back and then it becomes</v>

2097
01:38:42.821 --> 01:38:46.270
<v Speaker 2>this weird thing where all the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are on his side started like they,</v>

2098
01:38:46.271 --> 01:38:47.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pick people,</v>

2099
01:38:47.411 --> 01:38:49.990
<v Speaker 2>pick sides man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like fake news food news.</v>

2100
01:38:49.991 --> 01:38:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2101
01:38:52.211 --> 01:38:53.410
<v Speaker 2>it's The New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

2102
01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:57.160
<v Speaker 2>It's the one of the best news sources </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever have.</v>

2103
01:38:57.161 --> 01:38:57.851
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

2104
01:38:57.851 --> 01:39:01.210
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>100% you know why they're run by people.</v>

2105
01:39:01.690 --> 01:39:02.523
<v Speaker 2>People fuck up everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a place where they go where </v>

2106
01:39:04.871 --> 01:39:07.960
<v Speaker 2>they don't fuck up every fucking place a</v>
<v Speaker 2>person goes.</v>

2107
01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:11.290
<v Speaker 2>They fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fuck up in Harvard,</v>

2108
01:39:11.410 --> 01:39:12.243
<v Speaker 2>they fuck up in mit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just fuck up way less than most of </v>

2109
01:39:16.301 --> 01:39:18.280
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's still just people.</v>

2110
01:39:19.390 --> 01:39:20.020
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2111
01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:20.853
<v Speaker 2>Since W it's weird time right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're weird time right now as far as </v>

2112
01:39:24.471 --> 01:39:26.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way people are looking at things,</v>

2113
01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:28.813
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2114
01:39:30.650 --> 01:39:33.590
<v Speaker 2>just seems everything's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems very exaggerated.</v>

2115
01:39:34.830 --> 01:39:39.830
<v Speaker 2>A group preparing for something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're screaming baby war North Korea,</v>

2116
01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:42.890
<v Speaker 2>North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the other thing,</v>

2117
01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:43.753
<v Speaker 2>North Korea just made a speech recently </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they were actually open to high </v>

2118
01:39:47.241 --> 01:39:49.120
<v Speaker 2>level talks and there were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

2119
01:39:49.121 --> 01:39:49.954
<v Speaker 2>there are more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was way more passive and less </v>

2120
01:39:51.531 --> 01:39:53.480
<v Speaker 2>threatening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2121
01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:54.553
<v Speaker 2>And people like this crazy motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 2>might realize trump is a crazy </v>

2122
01:39:57.741 --> 01:39:58.574
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who actually runs the u s and unlike </v>

2123
01:40:01.131 --> 01:40:05.780
<v Speaker 2>Obama who would probably never consider </v>
<v Speaker 2>a attacking North Korea,</v>

2124
01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:07.460
<v Speaker 2>he's looking at trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2125
01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:10.220
<v Speaker 2>this dude is 70.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2126
01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:13.430
<v Speaker 2>he's old as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been a gangster his whole life.</v>

2127
01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:14.293
<v Speaker 2>And now he just took over the country </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he left the military guys do </v>

2128
01:40:16.881 --> 01:40:17.714
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck they want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think there's a high </v>

2129
01:40:20.271 --> 01:40:24.500
<v Speaker 2>possibility that some of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>spaceships from Nevada might come out of</v>

2130
01:40:24.501 --> 01:40:25.334
<v Speaker 2>a hole in the ground and go rocketing </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards North Korea in 20 minutes and </v>

2131
01:40:29.181 --> 01:40:32.390
<v Speaker 2>let loose some crazy new bombs that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't even heard of yet.</v>

2132
01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:34.040
<v Speaker 2>That's entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows it.</v>

2133
01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:40.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to think there's any </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit to our current situation.</v>

2134
01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:42.623
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we offer just cut off all their with a </v>

2135
01:40:43.921 --> 01:40:45.390
<v Speaker 4>gas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2136
01:40:45.450 --> 01:40:47.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some serious sanctions,</v>

2137
01:40:47.101 --> 01:40:50.260
<v Speaker 4>so that might be why he's telling you </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>

2138
01:40:50.850 --> 01:40:52.650
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's actually probably more logical.</v>

2139
01:40:52.710 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm doing more of</v>

2140
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:54.813
<v Speaker 1>the comic book thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like people don't want to piss </v>

2141
01:40:58.031 --> 01:40:59.230
<v Speaker 1>trump off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>

2142
01:40:59.350 --> 01:41:01.100
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2143
01:41:02.430 --> 01:41:04.360
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2144
01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:06.520
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely nuttier than the regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2145
01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:09.010
<v Speaker 1>He's definitely not nothing other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the regular dude that's in the job.</v>

2146
01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:10.393
<v Speaker 3>I thought we were getting an attack the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other day when that space x launch </v>

2147
01:41:12.231 --> 01:41:13.220
<v Speaker 3>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that was,</v>

2148
01:41:14.350 --> 01:41:16.100
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone at starbucks,</v>

2149
01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:17.053
<v Speaker 3>I said starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone at starbucks started running </v>

2150
01:41:18.651 --> 01:41:19.550
<v Speaker 3>out and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

2151
01:41:19.551 --> 01:41:20.810
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like is there a bomb?</v>

2152
01:41:20.811 --> 01:41:21.644
<v Speaker 3>Like I was kind of freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then everyone's like staring at the sky </v>

2153
01:41:23.541 --> 01:41:24.374
<v Speaker 3>so I run out and first I thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>an alien because I that pulsating smoke </v>

2154
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:31.303
<v Speaker 3>that was happening on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'd never seen anything like that </v>

2155
01:41:34.011 --> 01:41:35.090
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

2156
01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:36.193
<v Speaker 3>wait my eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen that before because it </v>

2157
01:41:38.091 --> 01:41:39.650
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looked like a big whale.</v>

2158
01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:42.410
<v Speaker 3>Then there was like a.in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the middle of it that was pulsating,</v>

2159
01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:45.670
<v Speaker 3>like smoke rings almost and it just </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked foreign.</v>

2160
01:41:45.710 --> 01:41:47.480
<v Speaker 3>It looked like an alien,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then everyone's like,</v>

2161
01:41:47.481 --> 01:41:48.530
<v Speaker 3>is that Korea?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2162
01:41:48.531 --> 01:41:52.760
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even think about North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like is that headed downtown?</v>

2163
01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:53.720
<v Speaker 3>I saw one of those ones</v>

2164
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:54.663
<v Speaker 1>melrose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a a launch at Edwards air force </v>

2165
01:41:56.321 --> 01:41:57.154
<v Speaker 1>base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They launched something like some </v>

2166
01:41:57.791 --> 01:41:59.350
<v Speaker 1>missile test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2167
01:41:59.351 --> 01:42:00.184
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw this thing shooting across the </v>

2168
01:42:01.241 --> 01:42:03.010
<v Speaker 1>sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are pulling their cars over.</v>

2169
01:42:03.210 --> 01:42:06.670
<v Speaker 1>This is a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they did it like right at dusk,</v>

2170
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:08.530
<v Speaker 1>right as the sun was setting and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>

2171
01:42:08.531 --> 01:42:10.180
<v Speaker 1>I think they thought they'd get away </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

2172
01:42:10.181 --> 01:42:11.890
<v Speaker 1>They could sneak it in there before we </v>
<v Speaker 1>could see it.</v>

2173
01:42:12.430 --> 01:42:14.510
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird that they do that.</v>

2174
01:42:14.511 --> 01:42:15.344
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a lot of car accidents </v>
<v Speaker 3>when that happened because everyone </v>

2175
01:42:17.511 --> 01:42:18.380
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

2176
01:42:18.381 --> 01:42:20.720
<v Speaker 3>Where are we getting attack?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird that they don't like,</v>

2177
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:24.380
<v Speaker 3>you know how your phone goes off if </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pablo gets kidnapped by his Stepdad,</v>

2178
01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:26.860
<v Speaker 3>you know you have that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the android,</v>

2179
01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:28.610
<v Speaker 3>but they want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2180
01:42:28.611 --> 01:42:31.370
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be a big rocket launch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

2181
01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:33.630
<v Speaker 3>what does this the one from last week?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

2182
01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:36.950
<v Speaker 3>look at their dish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is crazy.</v>

2183
01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2184
01:42:40.931 --> 01:42:43.030
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

2185
01:42:43.050 --> 01:42:45.530
<v Speaker 1>it's going around the earth and off </v>
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

2195
01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Has there ever been a god?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like Tony Stark.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You think he's sending his car away so </v>

<v Speaker 1>What if your calculations are off?</v>

2203
01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:27.573
<v Speaker 1>What if your calculations are off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know sometimes people were </v>

2204
01:43:29.681 --> 01:43:30.514
<v Speaker 1>saying they get up the Tesla and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>door handle doesn't open up </v>

2205
01:43:32.321 --> 01:43:35.020
<v Speaker 1>automatically and then you don't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a door handle like,</v>

2206
01:43:35.021 --> 01:43:35.854
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if that happens when you're up </v>

<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

2209
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:44.920
<v Speaker 1>We never had a super genius that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to just hand the keys to</v>

2210
01:43:44.921 --> 01:43:46.900
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if he is the Bitcoin guy too?</v>

2211
01:43:46.901 --> 01:43:49.560
<v Speaker 1>That some people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people think he created bitcoin.</v>

2212
01:43:49.570 --> 01:43:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

2213
01:43:50.650 --> 01:43:53.630
<v Speaker 1>I have to ask Mr Antonopoulos if he </v>
<v Speaker 1>agrees with that.</v>

2214
01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why don't you?</v>

2215
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:57.103
<v Speaker 1>Because that would be too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could have been done a two crazy </v>

<v Speaker 1>He's dating Johnny Depp's acts.</v>

2218
01:44:02.661 --> 01:44:04.500
<v Speaker 1>He can't be too close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Broke up with her bro.</v>

2221
01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:10.070
<v Speaker 1>that's right dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta think</v>

2222
01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:11.513
<v Speaker 2>that there's levels to everything and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they might be even levels in the super </v>

2223
01:44:15.691 --> 01:44:18.600
<v Speaker 2>genius category and he's in some weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>new,</v>

2224
01:44:18.601 --> 01:44:23.250
<v Speaker 2>crazy ultra productive level of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>super genius category.</v>

2225
01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:25.860
<v Speaker 2>Did he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he powered what,</v>

2226
01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:28.770
<v Speaker 2>what part of New Zealand was at or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that with that gigantic,</v>

2227
01:44:28.771 --> 01:44:30.630
<v Speaker 2>was it Australia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was Australia.</v>

2228
01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:31.613
<v Speaker 2>He made some sort of a bet where he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would install some mega battery complex </v>

2229
01:44:37.290 --> 01:44:39.180
<v Speaker 2>in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I remembering this right?</v>

2230
01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:44.850
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it worked perfectly in record time.</v>

2231
01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:46.613
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tesla built a giant battery to fight </v>

2232
01:44:47.761 --> 01:44:48.594
<v Speaker 2>power outages in Australia and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>already working and it worked in like </v>

2233
01:44:51.751 --> 01:44:52.584
<v Speaker 2>milliseconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the power went down and it kicked </v>

2234
01:44:55.081 --> 01:45:00.081
<v Speaker 2>on in milliseconds only last three years</v>
<v Speaker 2>before it starts at 0.14</v>

2235
01:45:00.841 --> 01:45:03.360
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

2236
01:45:04.050 --> 01:45:04.883
<v Speaker 2>After a major plant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Loy Yang sang a station in the </v>

2237
01:45:08.701 --> 01:45:12.120
<v Speaker 2>neighboring state of Victoria suffered a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden drop in output.</v>

2238
01:45:12.210 --> 01:45:17.210
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It kicked in just 0.14</v>

2239
01:45:17.371 --> 01:45:20.910
<v Speaker 2>seconds after the thing went out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's where he started.</v>

2350

<v Speaker 1>love it.</v>

2353
01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:28.533
<v Speaker 1>And I'm obviously the crazy history with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nelson Mandela and apartheid and how </v>

2354
01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:37.550
<v Speaker 1>recent that was to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I always think of a,</v>

2355
01:50:37.610 --> 01:50:41.350
<v Speaker 1>that sugar man movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I think of South Africa now,</v>

2356
01:50:42.130 --> 01:50:42.963
<v Speaker 1>I always think of district nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't it look like district nine </v>

<v Speaker 1>district nine was the movie with the </v>

2360
01:50:51.491 --> 01:50:53.740

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2361
01:50:53.770 --> 01:50:54.850
<v Speaker 1>they weren't robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What were they?</v>

2363
01:50:57.940 --> 01:51:00.400

<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing of both.</v>

2364
01:51:00.401 --> 01:51:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like some sort of tech alien.</v>

2365
01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:02.973
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They did,</v>

2531
01:58:45.130 --> 01:58:45.963
<v Speaker 1>they got in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they took them off the poster and </v>

2532
01:58:47.231 --> 01:58:48.064
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're not on any of the </v>

2533
01:58:49.481 --> 01:58:50.314
<v Speaker 1>posters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they're like main </v>

2534
01:58:50.861 --> 01:58:52.600
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortunate.</v>

2535
01:58:52.630 --> 01:58:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sucks.</v>

2536
01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:56.230
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why people like Deanwood,</v>

2537
01:58:56.290 --> 01:58:58.010
<v Speaker 1>they're little too raw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need like a,</v>

2538
01:58:58.011 --> 01:59:00.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a slick talking manager and we're doing,</v>

2539
01:59:00.540 --> 01:59:02.230
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're dealing with artists here.</v>

2540
01:59:02.231 --> 01:59:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately they don't really mean what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they say.</v>

2541
01:59:04.390 --> 01:59:06.790
<v Speaker 1>It's just the same explosive nature that</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives inside.</v>

2542
01:59:06.791 --> 01:59:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Then let some create such amazing music </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're a fan of and I'm a fan off.</v>

2543
01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:11.553
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it gets haywire and he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like to come in and apologize for </v>

2544
01:59:14.801 --> 01:59:15.634
<v Speaker 1>bitch slapping you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you to suck his dick was all </v>

2545
01:59:20.651 --> 01:59:21.920
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2546
01:59:21.921 --> 01:59:23.440
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they didn't even market it.</v>

2547
01:59:23.441 --> 01:59:25.720
<v Speaker 1>That dmt word was in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2548
01:59:26.110 --> 01:59:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems like a mistake.</v>

2549
01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:30.580
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you don't like money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who knows?</v>

2550
01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what they're really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2551
01:59:32.231 --> 01:59:33.370
<v Speaker 1>that would be the big bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2552
01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:36.430
<v Speaker 1>You meet him in their dicks mean and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hung out with them.</v>

2553
01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:39.970
<v Speaker 1>It really smelled like armpits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's armpits though?</v>

2554
01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:41.233
<v Speaker 1>Some people's armpits smell lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that one year you took </v>

2555
01:59:44.090 --> 01:59:45.850
<v Speaker 1>deodorant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a whole year.</v>

2556
01:59:46.700 --> 01:59:49.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like a week to seem like it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause like Ari's DMT trip.</v>

2557
01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:56.080
<v Speaker 1>I remember what the e three and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just making waves of smell.</v>

2558
01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:59.340
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't not wear deodorant.</v>

2559
01:59:59.410 --> 02:00:02.500
<v Speaker 1>I tried for a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

2560
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:04.263
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it interesting too that we've all </v>
<v Speaker 1>just accepted that we have to put </v>

2561
02:00:07.601 --> 02:00:08.434
<v Speaker 1>chemicals on certain parts of our body </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order not to smell after you've been </v>

2562
02:00:12.461 --> 02:00:15.130
<v Speaker 1>moving around for too long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird man.</v>

2563
02:00:16.210 --> 02:00:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Like have you ever shave your armpits </v>
<v Speaker 1>once by mistake?</v>

2564
02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:21.213
<v Speaker 1>Bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much of a effect it must </v>

2565
02:00:23.231 --> 02:00:25.870
<v Speaker 1>have some effect on what your armpits </v>
<v Speaker 1>smell like.</v>

2566
02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:27.370
<v Speaker 1>How's too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2567
02:00:27.610 --> 02:00:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2568
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:35.740
<v Speaker 1>But you can't do it unless you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're a bodybuilder.</v>

2569
02:00:35.890 --> 02:00:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Like there's things you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if my chest itches,</v>

2570
02:00:38.171 --> 02:00:39.004
<v Speaker 1>I'll shave my chest and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm embarrassed to say it but I'll do </v>

2571
02:00:41.561 --> 02:00:42.394
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if it gets itchy after a </v>

2572
02:00:43.471 --> 02:00:45.130
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't fuck with my armpits bro.</v>

2573
02:00:46.420 --> 02:00:48.040
<v Speaker 1>That's vain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys.</v>

2574
02:00:48.130 --> 02:00:48.963
<v Speaker 1>Shaved their arms that don't have like </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like carrot top or someone </v>

2575
02:00:52.271 --> 02:00:54.130
<v Speaker 1>saying he shaves his arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2576
02:00:54.131 --> 02:00:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Does it cause he likes the hate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>

2577
02:00:55.930 --> 02:00:56.763
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carrot top used to be a super </v>

2578
02:00:57.581 --> 02:00:59.830
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilder Jack Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember him.</v>

2579
02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:02.230
<v Speaker 1>I think he said he'd just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did at one time when he was a swimmer</v>

2580
02:01:02.231 --> 02:01:03.910
<v Speaker 1>and he just liked to feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like fuck,</v>

2581
02:01:04.510 --> 02:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>slippery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slippery through that pool slipping.</v>

2582
02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Sliding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I oil up,</v>

2583
02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:16.540
<v Speaker 1>oil up for I swim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's not buff anymore.</v>

2584
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:18.760
<v Speaker 1>He's back to normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he's still buff.</v>

2585
02:01:19.060 --> 02:01:22.630
<v Speaker 1>He's just not a giant bodybuilder guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creepy buff.</v>

2586
02:01:22.780 --> 02:01:23.613
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk for him cause I </v>

2587
02:01:25.871 --> 02:01:28.960
<v Speaker 1>don't know him but I know Dunkin did </v>
<v Speaker 1>something with him a long time ago.</v>

2588
02:01:28.961 --> 02:01:31.210
<v Speaker 1>They did a pilot for some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality show.</v>

2589
02:01:31.410 --> 02:01:34.930
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2590
02:01:35.620 --> 02:01:36.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the carrot top.</v>

2591
02:01:36.671 --> 02:01:37.504
<v Speaker 1>It is Jackie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jackie just and that's like a normal </v>

2592
02:01:39.210 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>karyotype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2593
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.060
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's more,</v>

2594
02:01:41.061 --> 02:01:44.570
<v Speaker 7>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>now he's like more like looks fit.</v>

2595
02:01:44.750 --> 02:01:45.950
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That Kathy Green.</v>

2596
02:01:45.951 --> 02:01:46.784
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But like back then he looked like super </v>

2597
02:01:49.370 --> 02:01:50.203
<v Speaker 7>duper jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like his shoulders were popping out </v>

2598
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:55.640
<v Speaker 7>unnaturally wide.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like it didn't even make sense.</v>

2599
02:01:55.641 --> 02:01:58.400
<v Speaker 7>Like right there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2600
02:01:58.700 --> 02:02:01.440
<v Speaker 7>he went off the deep end.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It looked like he had me mean.</v>

2601
02:02:01.441 --> 02:02:03.530
<v Speaker 7>He's so big.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who knows what the fuck he was doing,</v>

2602
02:02:03.590 --> 02:02:06.800
<v Speaker 7>what he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A lot of shit that's shorter.</v>

2603
02:02:06.801 --> 02:02:07.290
<v Speaker 7>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>

2604
02:02:07.290 --> 02:02:08.690
<v Speaker 7>it looks like an implants.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2605
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:10.140
<v Speaker 7>It could be,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2606
02:02:10.490 --> 02:02:14.420
<v Speaker 7>something called synthol that um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some bodybuilders,</v>

2607
02:02:14.450 --> 02:02:15.860
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>engage in and what it does,</v>

2608
02:02:15.861 --> 02:02:16.694
<v Speaker 7>they think it helps them balance out </v>
<v Speaker 7>areas of their body that aren't big </v>

2609
02:02:20.031 --> 02:02:20.864
<v Speaker 7>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's real weird cause there's a ton </v>

2610
02:02:24.831 --> 02:02:26.270
<v Speaker 7>of videos of people taking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2611
02:02:26.271 --> 02:02:30.170
<v Speaker 7>the videos he's putting synthol in their</v>
<v Speaker 7>muscles and dancing around.</v>

2612
02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:33.140
<v Speaker 7>That's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's just him looking buff.</v>

2613
02:02:33.410 --> 02:02:36.200
<v Speaker 7>That doesn't look anything nearly as </v>
<v Speaker 7>bad.</v>

2614
02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:40.000
<v Speaker 7>We're looking at a carrot top where he </v>
<v Speaker 7>can see his dick route.</v>

2615
02:02:40.850 --> 02:02:42.870
<v Speaker 7>It goes to the photo,</v>
<v Speaker 7>goes all the way down as well.</v>

2616
02:02:42.930 --> 02:02:43.763
<v Speaker 7>I call what I call it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's my name and Amy Cook always </v>

2617
02:02:46.341 --> 02:02:50.180
<v Speaker 7>posting guys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Exactly what I,</v>

2618
02:02:50.181 --> 02:02:53.210
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>describe that look to people where a man</v>

2619
02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:57.110
<v Speaker 7>has his underwear at the very base of </v>
<v Speaker 7>his cock.</v>

2620
02:02:57.111 --> 02:02:59.330
<v Speaker 7>That's your Dick Route.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a beautiful term.</v>

2621
02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:01.510
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Thank you.</v>

2622
02:03:02.150 --> 02:03:02.990
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>by the way,</v>

2623
02:03:02.991 --> 02:03:05.810
<v Speaker 7>I demand 100% credit for Dick rude </v>
<v Speaker 7>tickers.</v>

2624
02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:06.673
<v Speaker 7>I created it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I was trying to figure out how to </v>

2625
02:03:08.931 --> 02:03:11.870
<v Speaker 7>describe what was uncomfortable about </v>
<v Speaker 7>those kinds of pictures.</v>

2626
02:03:11.890 --> 02:03:15.530
<v Speaker 7>And it's like you're trying so hard and </v>
<v Speaker 7>like that's Dick Route.</v>

2627
02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:17.520
<v Speaker 7>That's Dick route all the way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Carrot top.</v>

2628
02:03:17.770 --> 02:03:20.330
<v Speaker 7>Take any dignity Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It looks like case a thong on.</v>

2629
02:03:20.331 --> 02:03:24.590
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't even look like it shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 7>be possible with the laws of gravity.</v>

2630
02:03:25.010 --> 02:03:27.530
<v Speaker 7>It looks like that things should fall </v>
<v Speaker 7>down your ankles.</v>

2631
02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:29.773
<v Speaker 7>Freckled boners she'd come rocketing at </v>
<v Speaker 7>the screen like a three d shark in jaws </v>

2632
02:03:34.161 --> 02:03:39.161
<v Speaker 7>three d three but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's just jacked.</v>

2633
02:03:39.621 --> 02:03:41.330
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's just a guy who wants everybody suck</v>

2634
02:03:41.331 --> 02:03:42.164
<v Speaker 7>his deck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just like letting you know it's right </v>

2635
02:03:43.551 --> 02:03:45.230
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right there.</v>

2636
02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:48.320
<v Speaker 7>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I mean,</v>

2637
02:03:48.321 --> 02:03:49.640
<v Speaker 7>but he's just jack,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that makes sense.</v>

2638
02:03:49.641 --> 02:03:53.270
<v Speaker 7>But what does it make sense as the s the</v>
<v Speaker 7>people would stick the oil in their arms</v>

2639
02:03:53.271 --> 02:03:54.104
<v Speaker 7>and they would create like water </v>
<v Speaker 7>balloons where their muscles should be </v>

2640
02:03:57.290 --> 02:04:01.190
<v Speaker 7>and they would dance around and there's </v>
<v Speaker 7>one video of a guy like throwing punches</v>

2641
02:04:01.191 --> 02:04:03.440
<v Speaker 7>in the air with these water balloons for</v>
<v Speaker 7>arms.</v>

2642

2656
02:04:42.961 --> 02:04:46.350
<v Speaker 1>even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the thing about this young man is,</v>

2657
02:04:46.351 --> 02:04:48.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what he is is an abuser look at him </v>

<v Speaker 3>cupping or doing that thing where they,</v>

2687
02:06:07.470 --> 02:06:08.303
<v Speaker 3>they like picture a little and then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>put these glasses and they pretty much </v>

2688
02:06:12.871 --> 02:06:13.704
<v Speaker 3>suck the bad blood out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I walk in and there's just blood </v>

2689
02:06:16.591 --> 02:06:18.160
<v Speaker 3>everywhere and towels and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2690
02:06:18.161 --> 02:06:19.410
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and shit like that.</v>

2691
02:06:20.370 --> 02:06:21.780
<v Speaker 3>What is it supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to.</v>

2692
02:06:21.781 --> 02:06:23.010
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2693
02:06:23.011 --> 02:06:26.670
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to some accelerate blood </v>
<v Speaker 3>flow to the area,</v>

2694
02:06:26.671 --> 02:06:28.350
<v Speaker 3>like polls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tissue,</v>

2695
02:06:28.351 --> 02:06:30.840
<v Speaker 3>the skin away from it and accelerates </v>
<v Speaker 3>blood flow.</v>

2696
02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:33.570
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes the blood comes out as gel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is weird.</v>

2697
02:06:33.571 --> 02:06:35.790
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's what,</v>

2698
02:06:35.800 --> 02:06:39.120
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know his lot it cause I posted </v>
<v Speaker 3>a video of it while they were doing it.</v>

2699
02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:41.640
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people are saying that cuppings</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad for you.</v>

2700
02:06:41.641 --> 02:06:43.440
<v Speaker 3>And then I did research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is,</v>

2701
02:06:43.441 --> 02:06:45.240
<v Speaker 3>if it goes bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes bad.</v>

2702
02:06:45.241 --> 02:06:48.330
<v Speaker 3>It leaves permanent damage if they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they don't do it right.</v>

2703
02:06:48.331 --> 02:06:49.890
<v Speaker 3>And really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2704
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:50.743
<v Speaker 3>if there's some photos that are pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>disturbing where like pretty much just </v>

2705
02:06:54.091 --> 02:06:57.030
<v Speaker 3>holes in people's backs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>completely wrong.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Scroll down,</v>

2720
02:07:27.101 --> 02:07:28.000
<v Speaker 1>scroll down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scroll down.</v>

2721
02:07:28.030 --> 02:07:31.240
<v Speaker 1>That one to the right in the middle with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the orange and the blue,</v>

2722
02:07:31.390 --> 02:07:33.310
<v Speaker 1>the right all the way to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

2723
02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:36.010
<v Speaker 1>the other right edge of the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to the</v>

2724
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:37.330
<v Speaker 7>edge of the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dot Guy.</v>

2725
02:07:37.390 --> 02:07:38.350
<v Speaker 7>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2726
02:07:38.420 --> 02:07:43.420
<v Speaker 7>cause he's got horns.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh this is a water buffalo horn to being</v>

2727
02:07:45.371 --> 02:07:48.220
<v Speaker 7>used for it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they're just using buffalo horn.</v>

2728
02:07:48.230 --> 02:07:49.270
<v Speaker 7>Says Cups.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2729
02:07:49.271 --> 02:07:52.570
<v Speaker 7>what copping with buffalo horns.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Look,</v>

2730
02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:54.220
<v Speaker 7>Rogan does.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So Yo Bro,</v>

2731
02:07:54.340 --> 02:07:58.030
<v Speaker 7>I do that based on my balls,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my nig route.</v>

2732
02:07:58.750 --> 02:08:02.740
<v Speaker 7>What made sense to me is that you would </v>
<v Speaker 7>kind of like create damage,</v>

2733
02:08:02.770 --> 02:08:07.660
<v Speaker 7>which is while that blood exists and </v>
<v Speaker 7>that maybe that it'd be like almost like</v>

2734
02:08:07.661 --> 02:08:08.494
<v Speaker 7>a prp sort of a thing where all that </v>
<v Speaker 7>extra blood that you've created from </v>

2735
02:08:11.831 --> 02:08:16.410
<v Speaker 7>that area would go and help the blood </v>
<v Speaker 7>flow to the part that's injured and they</v>

2736
02:08:16.411 --> 02:08:19.360
<v Speaker 7>accelerate healing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He never know man,</v>

2737
02:08:19.361 --> 02:08:20.194
<v Speaker 7>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can't say that people that are in </v>

2738
02:08:21.641 --> 02:08:22.474
<v Speaker 7>the Olympics don't ever do anything </v>
<v Speaker 7>stupid cause they definitely would do </v>

2739
02:08:25.061 --> 02:08:25.894
<v Speaker 7>something stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Someone can talk to him in and doing a </v>

2740
02:08:27.251 --> 02:08:30.520
<v Speaker 7>bunch of shit if he,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if sometimes like the psychological edge</v>

2741
02:08:30.521 --> 02:08:33.010
<v Speaker 7>and believing that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's going to work really good,</v>

2742
02:08:33.130 --> 02:08:35.380
<v Speaker 7>we'll be just enough to get a few people</v>
<v Speaker 7>to do it.</v>

2743
02:08:36.670 --> 02:08:37.503
<v Speaker 7>But this has been around for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This has been around long enough where </v>

2744
02:08:39.701 --> 02:08:42.400
<v Speaker 7>people are going like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know there's like really significant</v>

2745
02:08:42.401 --> 02:08:47.401
<v Speaker 7>benefits things real.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They really do it that way.</v>

2746
02:08:48.670 --> 02:08:50.650
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's almost like traditional for I guess</v>

2747
02:08:50.651 --> 02:08:53.410
<v Speaker 7>Korean culture because I mean they were </v>
<v Speaker 7>just doing it like it was nothing.</v>

2748
02:08:53.411 --> 02:08:55.510
<v Speaker 7>I had a family dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's crazy.</v>

2749
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:58.210
<v Speaker 7>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But maybe that works,</v>

2750
02:08:58.650 --> 02:08:59.483
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean the only way you find out of </v>

2751
02:09:01.091 --> 02:09:01.924
<v Speaker 7>stuff like this works,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is like a really unconventional </v>

2752
02:09:03.881 --> 02:09:05.290
<v Speaker 7>therapy is you've got to try it.</v>

2753
02:09:07.390 --> 02:09:08.223
<v Speaker 7>If all those super genius type guys that</v>
<v Speaker 7>are training these Olympic athletes and </v>

2754
02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:16.630
<v Speaker 7>getting them to peak performance and </v>
<v Speaker 7>what could potentially be worth millions</v>

2755
02:09:16.630 --> 02:09:18.400
<v Speaker 7>and millions of dollars in sponsorship </v>
<v Speaker 7>money if they win the gold medal,</v>

2756
02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:19.353
<v Speaker 7>if they're having these people get all </v>
<v Speaker 7>cupped up is probably something to it </v>

2757
02:09:21.970 --> 02:09:25.180
<v Speaker 7>kept up right in this day and age.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's like acupuncture.</v>

2758
02:09:25.181 --> 02:09:27.970
<v Speaker 7>I feel like I don't know enough to know </v>
<v Speaker 7>if that's accurate or not.</v>

2759
02:09:27.971 --> 02:09:28.804
<v Speaker 7>It seems like it is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Some people believe in it a lot cause </v>

2760
02:09:31.241 --> 02:09:32.920
<v Speaker 7>they pay a lot of money for it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do it all the time.</v>

2761
02:09:33.310 --> 02:09:34.210
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for sure.</v>

2762
02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:35.113
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a lot of people do believe in </v>

2763
02:09:35.621 --> 02:09:36.454
<v Speaker 7>acupuncture,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but copping seems to me to be like more </v>

2764
02:09:38.681 --> 02:09:39.514
<v Speaker 7>next level.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like you're pulling the skin away </v>

2765
02:09:41.111 --> 02:09:41.944
<v Speaker 7>from the area to the point where it </v>
<v Speaker 7>bleeds and turns into the big ass </v>

2766
02:09:44.351 --> 02:09:45.184
<v Speaker 7>bruise.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They have this giant circle red spot </v>

2767
02:09:47.860 --> 02:09:51.920
<v Speaker 7>where the increased blood flow hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 7>been filtered out of the body.</v>

2768
02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:52.753
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you got some weird shit happened </v>

2769
02:09:53.611 --> 02:09:54.820
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That ain't normal thing.</v>

2770
02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:57.850
<v Speaker 7>You got a big circle bruise on your </v>
<v Speaker 7>back,</v>

2771
02:09:57.851 --> 02:09:59.590
<v Speaker 7>right where you're hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2772
02:09:59.591 --> 02:10:00.424
<v Speaker 7>I see what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're making it all bleed in there so </v>

2773
02:10:01.691 --> 02:10:04.090
<v Speaker 7>it flows everything out of there and </v>
<v Speaker 7>heals it up quicker.</v>

2774
02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:06.370
<v Speaker 7>It kind of makes sense to a dummy like </v>
<v Speaker 7>me,</v>

2775
02:10:06.700 --> 02:10:07.533
<v Speaker 7>like I don't know anything about how the</v>
<v Speaker 7>actual body functions in terms of like </v>

2776
02:10:10.001 --> 02:10:12.580
<v Speaker 7>how things heal and whether or not it </v>
<v Speaker 7>would accelerate or not,</v>

2777
02:10:12.581 --> 02:10:15.270
<v Speaker 7>but that Michael Phelps guys doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2778
02:10:15.460 --> 02:10:17.980
<v Speaker 7>When I asked him how has it feel </v>
<v Speaker 7>afterwards,</v>

2779
02:10:17.981 --> 02:10:22.570
<v Speaker 7>he says it took a refreshing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I feel way energetic now and relaxed.</v>

2780
02:10:23.190 --> 02:10:24.023
<v Speaker 7>Well it's like people that wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 7>deny the benefits of cryotherapy before </v>

2781
02:10:27.671 --> 02:10:28.504
<v Speaker 7>like some papers came out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of people poopooing and </v>

2782
02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:34.730
<v Speaker 7>partly for good reason.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's cause a lot of the people that were</v>

2783
02:10:34.731 --> 02:10:38.600
<v Speaker 7>running these cryotherapy sites got </v>
<v Speaker 7>overzealous in their claims.</v>

2784
02:10:38.990 --> 02:10:39.823
<v Speaker 7>They got real overzealous in their </v>
<v Speaker 7>claims of like how much weight you can </v>

2785
02:10:43.911 --> 02:10:45.860
<v Speaker 7>lose,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how much better you can look,</v>

2786
02:10:45.861 --> 02:10:46.694
<v Speaker 7>all these different things that may or </v>
<v Speaker 7>may not be true when it comes to throw </v>

2787
02:10:49.690 --> 02:10:51.680
<v Speaker 7>cryotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>especially in the way they described it,</v>

2788
02:10:51.681 --> 02:10:55.700
<v Speaker 7>but what can't be denied is the way it </v>
<v Speaker 7>makes you feel.</v>

2789
02:10:56.150 --> 02:11:00.020
<v Speaker 7>It makes you feel fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You do three minutes.</v>

2790
02:11:00.021 --> 02:11:02.990
<v Speaker 7>And while that was crappy prior therapy </v>
<v Speaker 7>places you come out of there like,</v>

2791
02:11:02.991 --> 02:11:03.824
<v Speaker 7>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 7>everybody I know that's tried has been </v>

2792
02:11:05.091 --> 02:11:06.350
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whoa.</v>

2793
02:11:06.590 --> 02:11:08.330
<v Speaker 7>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll give a lot for that.</v>

2794
02:11:08.331 --> 02:11:09.980
<v Speaker 7>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like that was good,</v>

2795
02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:12.193
<v Speaker 7>but everybody's right to be suspicious </v>
<v Speaker 7>because the part before the world was </v>

2796
02:11:14.901 --> 02:11:16.510
<v Speaker 7>annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There was like a lot I like,</v>

2797
02:11:16.511 --> 02:11:18.670
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like in [inaudible] college in your skin</v>

2798
02:11:18.671 --> 02:11:19.504
<v Speaker 7>and it's like a virtual face lift and </v>
<v Speaker 7>like there's a lot of people are </v>

2799
02:11:21.831 --> 02:11:24.470
<v Speaker 7>claiming some night,</v>
<v Speaker 7>where's this?</v>

2800
02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:25.880
<v Speaker 7>You gotta you gotta be able to prove </v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

2801
02:11:25.881 --> 02:11:28.520
<v Speaker 7>but they can prove anti inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 7>markers in the blood.</v>

2802
02:11:28.521 --> 02:11:29.810
<v Speaker 7>They can prove all these like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2803
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:31.470
<v Speaker 7>hormones and these,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2804
02:11:32.100 --> 02:11:35.200
<v Speaker 7>neurochemicals that your brain can,</v>
<v Speaker 7>can make when you're a,</v>

2805
02:11:35.210 --> 02:11:38.930
<v Speaker 7>you're in that tank when a cryotherapy </v>
<v Speaker 7>chamber rather,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll definitely do it.</v>

2809
02:11:52.061 --> 02:11:52.894
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today I don't,</v>

2810

<v Speaker 1>I had a milkshake last night and I have </v>

2813
02:11:58.050 --> 02:12:00.020
<v Speaker 1>two minutes in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woke up at six in the morning.</v>

2814
02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:01.153

<v Speaker 1>ruse to get me to get you into the </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's all crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Filter ozone and UV light filters.</v>

2830
02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:48.600
<v Speaker 1>One Micron field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was explaining it all to me.</v>

2831
02:12:48.630 --> 02:12:50.630
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds good.</v>

2832
02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:55.130
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like you did good shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm too fucking dumb.</v>

2833
02:12:55.250 --> 02:12:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Plus I can't pay attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

2834
02:12:56.930 --> 02:12:57.830
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2835
02:12:58.160 --> 02:12:59.930
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel when people keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing up bitcoin.</v>

2836
02:12:59.990 --> 02:13:01.700
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me know.</v>

2837
02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Let me know when you get this sorted </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2838
02:13:03.111 --> 02:13:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Because I watched a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2839
02:13:04.881 --> 02:13:07.940
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't follow the bitcoin show.</v>

2840
02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:09.111
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2841
02:13:09.111 --> 02:13:11.660
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we got those bitcoins,</v>

2842
02:13:11.940 --> 02:13:12.620
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

2843
02:13:12.620 --> 02:13:14.900
<v Speaker 1>when he gave us bitcoin's a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

2844
02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:16.260
<v Speaker 1>who gave us a bit of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2845
02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Andrea plus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2846
02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:23.060
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to open up my wallet or</v>
<v Speaker 1>find my password to that wallet.</v>

2847
02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:24.290
<v Speaker 1>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2848
02:13:24.291 --> 02:13:25.124
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never be able to get that bit coin </v>

2849
02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:27.073
<v Speaker 1>he gave him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it was only at the </v>

2850
02:13:28.260 --> 02:13:30.050
<v Speaker 1>University of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let it be a statistical anomaly.</v>

2851
02:13:30.230 --> 02:13:33.180
<v Speaker 1>It's probably worth of dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions,</v>

2852
02:13:33.180 --> 02:13:34.013
<v Speaker 1>billions for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you get in and get out and </v>

2853
02:13:35.191 --> 02:13:39.930
<v Speaker 1>people are accusing people of pump and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumps and there's subterfuge.</v>

2854
02:13:40.350 --> 02:13:41.183
<v Speaker 1>Subterfuge is taken into consideration </v>
<v Speaker 1>of some of the highs and the lows </v>

2855
02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:44.670
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

2856
02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Just like everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2857
02:13:47.250 --> 02:13:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Like big corporations taking over shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like these,</v>

2858
02:13:51.061 --> 02:13:53.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these patterns are not normal.</v>

2859
02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:54.720
<v Speaker 1>They're normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see them coming.</v>

2860
02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:57.470
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to have something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bitcoin,</v>

2861
02:13:57.471 --> 02:13:59.730
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have people for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone's going to be,</v>

2862
02:13:59.731 --> 02:14:00.564
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

2863
02:14:00.900 --> 02:14:02.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking thief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now with Bitcoin,</v>

2864
02:14:03.420 --> 02:14:06.090
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin would be super cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more deception.</v>

2865
02:14:06.180 --> 02:14:08.260
<v Speaker 1>This is about the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's resolution,</v>

2866
02:14:08.350 --> 02:14:11.220
<v Speaker 1>it's about resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is about the children.</v>

2867
02:14:11.940 --> 02:14:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Now anybody's a scam artist is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a scam artist and anything they can,</v>

2868
02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:20.600
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a re a fake religion or </v>

<v Speaker 1>terms of like how technology and people </v>

<v Speaker 4>like having a robot couldn't be your </v>

2880
02:14:57.131 --> 02:14:58.960
<v Speaker 4>home base.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like computer.</v>

2881
02:14:59.890 --> 02:15:00.723
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno like these Alexis and I'll like </v>

2882
02:15:02.530 --> 02:15:06.580
<v Speaker 4>apple's about to release Thurs and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Google has released Thurs and</v>

2883
02:15:06.930 --> 02:15:10.670
<v Speaker 1>I seen the autonomous robots that </v>
<v Speaker 1>monitor parking lots now.</v>

2884
02:15:11.180 --> 02:15:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted it I think yesterday,</v>

2885
02:15:16.100 --> 02:15:16.933
<v Speaker 1>but definitely robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to give up our security and </v>

2886
02:15:20.031 --> 02:15:21.890
<v Speaker 1>all our privacy at the same time.</v>

2887
02:15:22.460 --> 02:15:23.293
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

2888
02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:26.700
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be fine because the robot</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be watching us.</v>

2889
02:15:26.820 --> 02:15:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Keep an eye on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot.</v>

2890
02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:31.530
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be zero privacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>

2891
02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:33.450
<v Speaker 1>It's real close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's already there.</v>

2892
02:15:33.660 --> 02:15:36.270
<v Speaker 1>But I mean real close to not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular zero privacy,</v>

2893
02:15:36.271 --> 02:15:38.940
<v Speaker 1>but like no one ever has a moment alone </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

2894
02:15:39.450 --> 02:15:42.260
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it will slowly erode.</v>

2895
02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Then you'd go into the mountains in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>put cell phone towers out there and then</v>

2896
02:15:45.301 --> 02:15:47.910
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the technology is,</v>

2897
02:15:47.911 --> 02:15:48.744
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to know where everyone is </v>

2898
02:15:51.121 --> 02:15:54.120
<v Speaker 1>at any moment and we're going to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to know each other.</v>

2899
02:15:58.190 --> 02:15:58.910
<v Speaker 1>What do you got Jamie?</v>

2900
02:15:58.910 --> 02:16:01.790
<v Speaker 4>I was looking up for the thing I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw,</v>

2901
02:16:01.791 --> 02:16:03.200
<v Speaker 4>and it wasn't on your twitter feed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>

2902
02:16:03.201 --> 02:16:05.840
<v Speaker 4>I saw a video of like autonomous parking</v>
<v Speaker 4>robots,</v>

2903
02:16:05.850 --> 02:16:08.600
<v Speaker 4>building cars in and out of spots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't put it on twitter.</v>

2904
02:16:08.630 --> 02:16:09.463
<v Speaker 4>I thought it did</v>

2905
02:16:09.510 --> 02:16:10.710
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2906
02:16:10.740 --> 02:16:11.780
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2907
02:16:12.670 --> 02:16:14.220
<v Speaker 1>a comp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate.</v>

2908
02:16:14.221 --> 02:16:15.930
<v Speaker 1>I retweeted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what it does though.</v>

2909
02:16:15.990 --> 02:16:17.880
<v Speaker 1>I think I retweeted somebody else </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

2910
02:16:18.210 --> 02:16:19.043
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is happening or something like </v>

2911
02:16:19.951 --> 02:16:22.140
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's probably not that clear.</v>

2912
02:16:22.380 --> 02:16:27.210
<v Speaker 1>One of the more recent tweets tapping </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Brian,</v>

2913
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:29.710
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be flying around us </v>
<v Speaker 1>monitoring us.</v>

2914
02:16:29.740 --> 02:16:30.100
<v Speaker 1>You saw that</v>

2915
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:32.020
<v Speaker 7>one robot,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it was in San Francisco.</v>

2916
02:16:32.470 --> 02:16:34.150
<v Speaker 7>Beat up homeless people or something </v>
<v Speaker 7>like that.</v>

2917
02:16:34.210 --> 02:16:35.420
<v Speaker 7>Good move.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2918
02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:37.840
<v Speaker 7>And stuff like that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's going to be a big pull back.</v>

2919
02:16:38.270 --> 02:16:39.410
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Robots.</v>

2920
02:16:39.430 --> 02:16:40.263
<v Speaker 7>Fucking homes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We need robots picking on the </v>

2921
02:16:41.921 --> 02:16:44.320
<v Speaker 7>downtrodden.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's good move.</v>

2922
02:16:44.590 --> 02:16:46.330
<v Speaker 7>Let them know you post.</v>
<v Speaker 7>These are on your way out.</v>

2923
02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:47.313
<v Speaker 7>The robots are here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean that literally is like the first </v>

2924
02:16:50.111 --> 02:16:53.230
<v Speaker 7>wave of immigrants from the silicone </v>
<v Speaker 7>world.</v>

2925
02:16:53.530 --> 02:16:56.830
<v Speaker 7>Robots at fuck with homeless people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The first,</v>

2926
02:16:57.100 --> 02:16:59.410
<v Speaker 7>the first invaders tripping them and </v>
<v Speaker 7>stuff.</v>

2927
02:17:00.010 --> 02:17:00.843
<v Speaker 7>I robot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The thing about I robot as you'd watch </v>

2928
02:17:03.581 --> 02:17:06.070
<v Speaker 7>it and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was made just at the right time.</v>

2929
02:17:06.430 --> 02:17:08.680
<v Speaker 7>It was made where you didn't think it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>ever possible.</v>

2930
02:17:09.010 --> 02:17:11.020
<v Speaker 7>It's made at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well this is pretty cool.</v>

2931
02:17:11.050 --> 02:17:12.400
<v Speaker 7>Like yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The future.</v>

2932
02:17:12.460 --> 02:17:13.660
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I could see it being real.</v>

2933
02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:15.033
<v Speaker 7>But you didn't think it was really </v>
<v Speaker 7>possible and now you watch I robot and </v>

2934
02:17:17.621 --> 02:17:18.790
<v Speaker 7>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

2935
02:17:18.791 --> 02:17:19.840
<v Speaker 7>it's inevitable.</v>

2936
02:17:19.990 --> 02:17:20.823
<v Speaker 7>That's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That thing that does the robot thing w </v>

2937
02:17:23.740 --> 02:17:26.320
<v Speaker 7>pretends to be a person and looks real </v>
<v Speaker 7>freaky.</v>

2938
02:17:26.321 --> 02:17:29.950
<v Speaker 7>That's easily doable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Or we set machinima.</v>

2939
02:17:30.200 --> 02:17:31.960
<v Speaker 7>What's that one?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's it.</v>

2940
02:17:31.961 --> 02:17:32.794
<v Speaker 7>Security robots are using two w uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>are being used to ward off San </v>

2941
02:17:36.010 --> 02:17:39.120
<v Speaker 7>Francisco's homeless population.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the drug.</v>

2942
02:17:39.130 --> 02:17:40.360
<v Speaker 7>What's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who makes that thing?</v>

2943
02:17:41.220 --> 02:17:43.840
<v Speaker 7>Say they retired it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2944
02:17:43.841 --> 02:17:46.600
<v Speaker 7>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a whole company that makes those</v>

2945
02:17:46.601 --> 02:17:51.040
<v Speaker 7>things and has them like wandering </v>
<v Speaker 7>around parking lots and I'm man,</v>

2946
02:17:51.041 --> 02:17:55.300
<v Speaker 7>I hope I retweeted it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I tried to um,</v>

2947
02:17:55.510 --> 02:17:58.030
<v Speaker 7>somebody sent it to me and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

2948
02:17:58.060 --> 02:17:58.893
<v Speaker 7>that's how it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They just have these things wandering </v>

2949
02:18:00.311 --> 02:18:01.480
<v Speaker 7>around,</v>
<v Speaker 7>recording everything.</v>

2950
02:18:01.481 --> 02:18:04.390
<v Speaker 7>So everybody's responsible for any car </v>
<v Speaker 7>accident.</v>

2951
02:18:04.420 --> 02:18:07.840
<v Speaker 7>Anything that ever happens if it hears </v>
<v Speaker 7>is someone's screaming rape.</v>

2952
02:18:07.870 --> 02:18:08.703
<v Speaker 7>If it hears someone's screening police </v>
<v Speaker 7>and immediately goes to the scene and </v>

2953
02:18:11.201 --> 02:18:12.034
<v Speaker 7>films,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's no worries about its own </v>

2954
02:18:12.911 --> 02:18:13.630
<v Speaker 7>mortality.</v>

2955
02:18:13.630 --> 02:18:14.463
<v Speaker 7>It's streaming in real time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It gets to record all altercations </v>

2956
02:18:17.261 --> 02:18:20.260
<v Speaker 7>between people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Eventually hotels agree.</v>

2957
02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:24.130
<v Speaker 7>As long as this is password secure and </v>
<v Speaker 7>encrypted,</v>

2958
02:18:24.370 --> 02:18:25.203
<v Speaker 7>they allowed to have the fire detector </v>
<v Speaker 7>and the corner double as a video camera </v>

2959
02:18:29.531 --> 02:18:31.150
<v Speaker 7>that records everything in the room at </v>
<v Speaker 7>all times.</v>

2960
02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:33.760
<v Speaker 7>What's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2961
02:18:33.820 --> 02:18:34.653
<v Speaker 7>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just got to get used to people watching </v>

2962
02:18:36.191 --> 02:18:37.024
<v Speaker 7>your fuck and ready.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I took the sticker off my webcam on my </v>

2963
02:18:41.441 --> 02:18:45.400
<v Speaker 7>laptop a long time jet go joe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They can watch me all I want.</v>

2964
02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:50.470
<v Speaker 7>I don't know why I'm more nervous about </v>
<v Speaker 7>this in 2018 this is what silly.</v>

2965
02:18:50.471 --> 02:18:51.304
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's become accelerated like I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm more nervous every year when it </v>

2966
02:18:54.521 --> 02:18:56.850
<v Speaker 7>comes to technology because I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 7>nervous in a,</v>

2967
02:18:56.860 --> 02:19:00.280
<v Speaker 7>in a way that I think it's totally 100% </v>
<v Speaker 7>negative but nervous in the way.</v>

2968
02:19:00.281 --> 02:19:03.490
<v Speaker 7>Like it just seems to me that we might </v>
<v Speaker 7>be in the middle of something and not be</v>

2969
02:19:03.491 --> 02:19:07.570
<v Speaker 7>paying attention like it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that it's happening so fucking fast that</v>

2970
02:19:07.571 --> 02:19:08.404
<v Speaker 7>we're caught up in it and it's just wild</v>
<v Speaker 7>wave of change and I'm just trying to </v>

2971
02:19:12.611 --> 02:19:13.444
<v Speaker 7>make sense of it while it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But then there's something about like </v>

2972
02:19:15.401 --> 02:19:16.234
<v Speaker 7>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like I used to think that saying like </v>

2973
02:19:19.451 --> 02:19:23.200
<v Speaker 7>the year 2017 2000 it's a stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who cares what year it is?</v>

2974
02:19:23.201 --> 02:19:25.300
<v Speaker 7>It's all just now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But no,</v>

2975
02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:27.950
<v Speaker 7>there's like a way we feel about it </v>
<v Speaker 7>differently.</v>

2976
02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:28.611
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2977
02:19:28.611 --> 02:19:31.520
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking 2018 dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2978
02:19:31.521 --> 02:19:33.800
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have a feeling about you </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2979
02:19:34.100 --> 02:19:35.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're very,</v>

2980
02:19:36.170 --> 02:19:40.250
<v Speaker 2>very far ahead in this game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

2981
02:19:40.310 --> 02:19:43.070
<v Speaker 2>this is the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>2018 that's a crazy number.</v>

2982
02:19:43.820 --> 02:19:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Hey Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 1979 nope,</v>

2983
02:19:45.350 --> 02:19:49.520
<v Speaker 2>it's 2018 whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So weird.</v>

2984
02:19:52.130 --> 02:19:54.200
<v Speaker 2>And when does this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2985
02:19:55.040 --> 02:19:55.873
<v Speaker 2>if you had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much longer does the human race </v>

2986
02:19:59.541 --> 02:20:00.740
<v Speaker 2>have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six months.</v>

2987
02:20:02.740 --> 02:20:05.090
<v Speaker 2>It seems like if you really had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess,</v>

2988
02:20:05.091 --> 02:20:06.710
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to be here forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2989
02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:10.100
<v Speaker 2>So we're not going to be here a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand years from now or 200,000</v>

2990
02:20:10.101 --> 02:20:11.330
<v Speaker 2>years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just not,</v>

2991
02:20:12.300 --> 02:20:14.610
<v Speaker 4>I started listening to the audio book of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sapiens.</v>

2992
02:20:14.720 --> 02:20:15.553
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

2993
02:20:15.570 --> 02:20:19.200
<v Speaker 4>I feel like that's what it's getting to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That question you're asking is the first</v>

2994
02:20:19.290 --> 02:20:20.123
<v Speaker 4>couple chapters are leading up to like </v>
<v Speaker 4>he says it over and over again like </v>

2995
02:20:22.350 --> 02:20:23.183
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe 2000 is what it's saying that the </v>

2996
02:20:25.531 --> 02:20:29.850
<v Speaker 4>human race won't be or human beings </v>
<v Speaker 4>won't be what we are today.</v>

2997
02:20:29.880 --> 02:20:33.570
<v Speaker 4>We'll be another evolution of whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is.</v>

2998
02:20:33.571 --> 02:20:35.060
<v Speaker 4>Because off of Australia Pickett.</v>

2999
02:20:35.250 --> 02:20:36.083
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to pick the guests </v>

3000
02:20:36.920 --> 02:20:39.710
<v Speaker 2>Australia pithiness see if you find any </v>
<v Speaker 2>good pictures of that thing.</v>

3001
02:20:39.740 --> 02:20:43.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is what they think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that that that's what started</v>

3002
02:20:43.681 --> 02:20:44.514
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was when it was like fairly </v>

3003
02:20:45.441 --> 02:20:47.030
<v Speaker 2>distinctly human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna.</v>

3004
02:20:47.300 --> 02:20:49.320
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to go to some new thing.</v>

3005
02:20:50.900 --> 02:20:52.730
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that thing.</v>

3006
02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:53.953
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's so close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what like a walking upright </v>

3007
02:20:57.231 --> 02:21:02.120
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzee and then that got smarter and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that got smarter and things kept going.</v>

3008
02:21:02.510 --> 02:21:04.250
<v Speaker 2>But the thing that really fucks you up </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

3009
02:21:04.251 --> 02:21:05.084
<v Speaker 2>it's not that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Australia Pythius was less than </v>

3010
02:21:08.361 --> 02:21:09.560
<v Speaker 2>2 million years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3011
02:21:10.160 --> 02:21:13.970
<v Speaker 2>It sounds right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a modern homo sapiens,</v>

3012
02:21:13.971 --> 02:21:18.971
<v Speaker 2>which I think they think are somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the neighborhood of 300 to 500,000</v>

3013
02:21:19.911 --> 02:21:22.490
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They keep moving it around a little bit.</v>

3014
02:21:22.491 --> 02:21:23.324
<v Speaker 2>When they find some new dead guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find some new bones and they're </v>

3015
02:21:26.451 --> 02:21:27.111
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3016
02:21:27.111 --> 02:21:27.944
<v Speaker 2>this one's older.</v>

3017
02:21:28.670 --> 02:21:29.503
<v Speaker 2>They got to the iconic guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say they're in the </v>

3018
02:21:32.121 --> 02:21:34.250
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood of 300,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ain't shit,</v>

3019
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:35.720
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That ain't shit.</v>

3020
02:21:35.750 --> 02:21:38.630
<v Speaker 2>That just happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's when they really started.</v>

3021
02:21:38.631 --> 02:21:41.990
<v Speaker 2>That just happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking about 300,000</v>

3022
02:21:41.991 --> 02:21:44.000
<v Speaker 2>years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uber.</v>

3023
02:21:44.210 --> 02:21:46.400
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be made out of gas.</v>

3024
02:21:46.401 --> 02:21:48.620
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be like those fires that </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't petroleum.</v>

3025
02:21:48.820 --> 02:21:52.580
<v Speaker 2>You won't be able to see us are </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent to be all pervasive.</v>

3026
02:21:52.581 --> 02:21:53.414
<v Speaker 2>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll have a one operating system that </v>

3027
02:21:55.581 --> 02:21:58.040
<v Speaker 2>we share with mother earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll plug it into,</v>

3028
02:21:58.041 --> 02:22:00.710
<v Speaker 2>our brains will plug into the ground and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

3029
02:22:00.770 --> 02:22:04.190
<v Speaker 2>we'll become divine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

3030
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:05.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3031
02:22:05.780 --> 02:22:07.520
<v Speaker 2>No one's here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I am.</v>

3032
02:22:07.980 --> 02:22:09.470
<v Speaker 2>Like let him go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go to him.</v>

3033
02:22:09.471 --> 02:22:10.870
<v Speaker 2>He'll come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3034
02:22:11.080 --> 02:22:13.540
<v Speaker 4>I always wonder what they thought about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this 200 years ago.</v>

3035
02:22:13.541 --> 02:22:16.960
<v Speaker 4>150 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they thought are we,</v>

3036
02:22:17.020 --> 02:22:19.630
<v Speaker 4>I feel like they thought that the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>is going to end too back then.</v>

3037
02:22:19.770 --> 02:22:20.603
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's always daughters away from an </v>

3038
02:22:22.091 --> 02:22:22.480
<v Speaker 4>ending.</v>

3039
02:22:22.480 --> 02:22:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean anytime,</v>

3040
02:22:23.561 --> 02:22:25.650
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially back when there was media,</v>

3041
02:22:25.710 --> 02:22:26.130
<v Speaker 2>anytime</v>

3042
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:28.590
<v Speaker 7>anything catastrophic happened in your </v>
<v Speaker 7>area,</v>

3043
02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:30.360
<v Speaker 7>you thought that was going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 7>end.</v>

3044
02:22:31.480 --> 02:22:32.000
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3045
02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.980
<v Speaker 7>And the moon was made as cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

3046
02:22:36.090 --> 02:22:40.500
<v Speaker 7>it's really weird how recent that was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what's weird.</v>

3047
02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:42.900
<v Speaker 7>When you just think about hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 7>thousands of years,</v>

3048
02:22:42.901 --> 02:22:47.310
<v Speaker 7>it seems like a long ass time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's not.</v>

3049
02:22:47.311 --> 02:22:50.700
<v Speaker 7>When you talk,</v>
<v Speaker 7>talk about the shape of human beings and</v>

3050
02:22:50.701 --> 02:22:53.400
<v Speaker 7>what what's happened in that amount of </v>
<v Speaker 7>time,</v>

3051
02:22:53.430 --> 02:22:57.480
<v Speaker 7>especially in the last few hundred or </v>
<v Speaker 7>few thousand years,</v>

3052
02:22:57.870 --> 02:22:58.703
<v Speaker 7>just all you need is sick.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you want to like really impress the </v>

3053
02:23:00.091 --> 02:23:01.650
<v Speaker 7>shit out of people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>give me 10,000</v>

3054
02:23:01.651 --> 02:23:03.180
<v Speaker 7>years,</v>
<v Speaker 7>10,000</v>

3055
02:23:03.181 --> 02:23:04.530
<v Speaker 7>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 7>10,000</v>

3056
02:23:04.531 --> 02:23:05.370
<v Speaker 7>years now you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wow,</v>

3057
02:23:06.120 --> 02:23:08.670
<v Speaker 7>you'd freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's no other time in history.</v>

3058
02:23:08.671 --> 02:23:11.160
<v Speaker 7>That would be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like every other time in history,</v>

3059
02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:12.330
<v Speaker 7>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>years would be like,</v>

3060
02:23:12.340 --> 02:23:13.173
<v Speaker 7>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They figured out how to make cooler </v>

3061
02:23:14.071 --> 02:23:14.970
<v Speaker 7>houses.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

3062
02:23:14.971 --> 02:23:16.590
<v Speaker 7>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's riding an elephant.</v>

3063
02:23:16.591 --> 02:23:18.060
<v Speaker 7>How do you figure that out?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

3064
02:23:18.061 --> 02:23:18.894
<v Speaker 7>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all that bone is way better than my bow </v>

3065
02:23:20.131 --> 02:23:21.810
<v Speaker 7>and Arrow every 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>years,</v>

3066
02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:23.940
<v Speaker 7>no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then all of a sudden,</v>

3067
02:23:23.941 --> 02:23:27.480
<v Speaker 7>one 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>year period and you have everything,</v>

3068
02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:30.960
<v Speaker 7>you got the pyramids,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you got space travel,</v>

3069
02:23:30.990 --> 02:23:34.680
<v Speaker 7>you've got the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you've got video photography,</v>

3070
02:23:35.220 --> 02:23:36.420
<v Speaker 7>three d printers.</v>

3071
02:23:36.690 --> 02:23:38.220
<v Speaker 4>Every time you say something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

3072
02:23:38.550 --> 02:23:39.870
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pops in my head,</v>

3073
02:23:39.871 --> 02:23:40.704
<v Speaker 4>the end of gangs in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which shows that montage of the hundred </v>

3074
02:23:43.950 --> 02:23:46.000
<v Speaker 4>years or so of New York changing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nice.</v>

3075
02:23:46.020 --> 02:23:46.853
<v Speaker 4>Thinking about how that's only a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 4>years in New York changed from this </v>

3076
02:23:49.981 --> 02:23:50.814
<v Speaker 4>crazy nothingness even though it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>really big then to like tons of </v>

3077
02:23:54.991 --> 02:23:57.690
<v Speaker 4>skyscrapers and bridges and all of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>it is today.</v>

3078
02:23:58.140 --> 02:24:00.360
<v Speaker 4>And it wasn't any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything close to that back then.</v>

3079
02:24:00.361 --> 02:24:02.760
<v Speaker 4>And that's like what a hundred years?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're talking about 10,000</v>

3080
02:24:03.170 --> 02:24:05.400
<v Speaker 4>but that's so much more time compared to</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hundred.</v>

3081
02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:07.930
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's an amazing montage.</v>

3082
02:24:08.900 --> 02:24:10.370
<v Speaker 7>Timelapse,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what would you call that?</v>

3083
02:24:10.371 --> 02:24:11.890
<v Speaker 7>That's time lapse.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Look at that.</v>

3084
02:24:11.891 --> 02:24:12.790
<v Speaker 7>That's incredible.</v>

3085
02:24:13.650 --> 02:24:14.180
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3086
02:24:14.180 --> 02:24:15.013
<v Speaker 7>New York City's a freak out man and even</v>
<v Speaker 7>more crazy look at that keeps going and </v>

3087
02:24:18.620 --> 02:24:20.240
<v Speaker 7>that's even bigger now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

3088
02:24:20.241 --> 02:24:22.810
<v Speaker 7>And towers aren't there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3089
02:24:22.811 --> 02:24:25.900
<v Speaker 7>In New York City is a genuine freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Unless you've been,</v>

3090
02:24:25.930 --> 02:24:26.763
<v Speaker 7>you should go.</v>

3091
02:24:28.030 --> 02:24:28.900
<v Speaker 7>If you've been in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you get it.</v>

3092
02:24:28.901 --> 02:24:29.291
<v Speaker 7>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

3093
02:24:29.291 --> 02:24:31.450
<v Speaker 7>it's not so love gone,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but if you haven't been,</v>

3094
02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:34.210
<v Speaker 7>it's a paradigm shifter because you </v>
<v Speaker 7>realize that it's possible.</v>

3095
02:24:34.420 --> 02:24:36.610
<v Speaker 7>It's such a big city.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've been a lot of big cities,</v>

3096
02:24:36.910 --> 02:24:37.743
<v Speaker 7>but New York City is so crazy and it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>the way it's constructed that you go </v>

3097
02:24:41.531 --> 02:24:42.364
<v Speaker 7>there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have like a different feel about </v>

3098
02:24:43.331 --> 02:24:43.811
<v Speaker 7>you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're like,</v>

3099
02:24:43.811 --> 02:24:44.644
<v Speaker 7>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>

3100
02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:46.450
<v Speaker 7>We're in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is,</v>

3101
02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:48.670
<v Speaker 7>this is different.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It is different.</v>

3102
02:24:48.850 --> 02:24:51.610
<v Speaker 7>These buildings are fucking giant.</v>
<v Speaker 7>These people are everywhere.</v>

3103
02:24:51.611 --> 02:24:52.810
<v Speaker 7>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is,</v>

3104
02:24:53.380 --> 02:24:55.510
<v Speaker 7>this is a different,</v>
<v Speaker 7>completely different feeling</v>

3105
02:24:57.820 --> 02:24:59.590
<v Speaker 7>and different people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3106
02:24:59.710 --> 02:25:00.543
<v Speaker 7>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the people are straddled down by the </v>

3107
02:25:03.911 --> 02:25:04.744
<v Speaker 7>echoes of the emigrants that were their </v>
<v Speaker 7>great grandparents and their </v>

3108
02:25:07.901 --> 02:25:08.734
<v Speaker 7>grandparents and their struggle that </v>
<v Speaker 7>they had to get from Europe over to </v>

3109
02:25:13.511 --> 02:25:14.344
<v Speaker 7>America.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is my thought because this is my </v>

3110
02:25:15.311 --> 02:25:16.480
<v Speaker 7>own family.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm talking about.</v>

3111
02:25:16.780 --> 02:25:17.820
<v Speaker 7>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3112
02:25:17.890 --> 02:25:20.740
<v Speaker 7>a lot of the Italian immigrants with my </v>
<v Speaker 7>grandfather,</v>

3113
02:25:21.460 --> 02:25:22.293
<v Speaker 7>he came over when was boy and his family</v>
<v Speaker 7>and a on both my mom's and my dad's </v>

3114
02:25:26.531 --> 02:25:28.300
<v Speaker 7>side.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They all came over from Europe,</v>

3115
02:25:28.420 --> 02:25:32.020
<v Speaker 7>from either from Ireland or from Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And they were all like really aggressive</v>

3116
02:25:32.021 --> 02:25:33.820
<v Speaker 7>risk taking people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

3117
02:25:34.810 --> 02:25:37.330
<v Speaker 7>And those are the people that built that</v>
<v Speaker 7>whole area,</v>

3118
02:25:37.690 --> 02:25:38.523
<v Speaker 7>which is just all you think about like </v>
<v Speaker 7>what a crazy accomplishment it is to </v>

3119
02:25:43.601 --> 02:25:48.601
<v Speaker 7>build this gigantic city from all these </v>
<v Speaker 7>immigrants that came over from Europe,</v>

3120
02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:49.473
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>from 1700 whatever it is on just </v>

3121
02:25:51.300 --> 02:25:53.060
<v Speaker 7>construct and all these incredible </v>
<v Speaker 7>buildings.</v>

3122
02:25:53.590 --> 02:25:55.990
<v Speaker 7>So very,</v>
<v Speaker 7>very bizarre accomplishment.</v>

3123
02:25:56.650 --> 02:25:58.740
<v Speaker 7>But that same kind of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3124
02:25:59.000 --> 02:25:59.833
<v Speaker 7>that brought those people over there in </v>
<v Speaker 7>the first place would create like a lot </v>

3125
02:26:02.471 --> 02:26:05.200
<v Speaker 7>of interpersonal conflict and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 7>aggression.</v>

3126
02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:07.780
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if New York's totally </v>
<v Speaker 7>gotten past that.</v>

3127
02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:10.300
<v Speaker 7>I think they have more now than ever </v>
<v Speaker 7>before.</v>

3128
02:26:10.330 --> 02:26:11.163
<v Speaker 7>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was reading something about the crime </v>

3129
02:26:12.221 --> 02:26:14.620
<v Speaker 7>rate that New York's crime rate is </v>
<v Speaker 7>lowest.</v>

3130
02:26:14.621 --> 02:26:15.970
<v Speaker 7>It's been in a long ass time.</v>

3131
02:26:17.380 --> 02:26:19.090
<v Speaker 3>I think we're at the highest right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3132
02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:19.953
<v Speaker 3>La Is he making this sub?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I just saw something the </v>

3133
02:26:22.571 --> 02:26:25.780
<v Speaker 3>other day where if I had more homicides </v>
<v Speaker 3>this year,</v>

3134
02:26:25.781 --> 02:26:28.780
<v Speaker 3>then recent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fall asleep.</v>

3135
02:26:28.840 --> 02:26:31.060
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to remember.</v>

3136
02:26:31.061 --> 02:26:32.590
<v Speaker 3>I think I saw something that was close </v>
<v Speaker 3>to that,</v>

3137
02:26:32.591 --> 02:26:35.030
<v Speaker 3>but I thought the murder rate was down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but violent crime was up here.</v>

3138
02:26:35.420 --> 02:26:37.060
<v Speaker 3>Let me just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a police chase.</v>

3139
02:26:37.090 --> 02:26:41.200
<v Speaker 3>More pimps lapse in ever three police </v>
<v Speaker 3>chases is a day on the TV.</v>

3140
02:26:41.201 --> 02:26:42.460
<v Speaker 3>It's like ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How</v>

3141
02:26:43.140 --> 02:26:44.730
<v Speaker 7>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3142
02:26:44.830 --> 02:26:45.663
<v Speaker 7>A police chase their fucking terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 7>cause you don't want the cops just let </v>

3143
02:26:47.671 --> 02:26:51.240
<v Speaker 7>someone run away or you don't want the </v>
<v Speaker 7>cops to slam into you or they're chasing</v>

3144
02:26:51.241 --> 02:26:53.370
<v Speaker 7>some guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know close.</v>

3145
02:26:53.640 --> 02:26:54.473
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Crime rates in New York City reached </v>

3146
02:26:55.651 --> 02:26:59.040
<v Speaker 7>record lows as a article about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The blasio.</v>

3147
02:26:59.041 --> 02:26:59.874
<v Speaker 7>That's the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

3148
02:27:01.720 --> 02:27:03.900
<v Speaker 7>It's just if you don't know that that's </v>
<v Speaker 7>possible.</v>

3149
02:27:04.380 --> 02:27:05.213
<v Speaker 7>Going there and seeing that it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>possible and then realize that its home </v>

3150
02:27:07.981 --> 02:27:08.814
<v Speaker 7>within a hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's where it's mind boggling or 200 </v>

3151
02:27:12.391 --> 02:27:15.660
<v Speaker 7>years or whatever in New York Syndrome </v>
<v Speaker 7>has been around for in totality.</v>

3152
02:27:17.150 --> 02:27:17.710
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3153
02:27:17.710 --> 02:27:18.543
<v Speaker 7>What is the world we're experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 7>right now going to be like in a hundred </v>

3154
02:27:21.850 --> 02:27:23.020
<v Speaker 7>years?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean are</v>

3155
02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:24.950
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3156
02:27:24.950 --> 02:27:25.783
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it almost seems to me like there's no </v>

3157
02:27:27.241 --> 02:27:28.074
<v Speaker 7>way we're going to be able to guess.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you look at how quick that </v>

3158
02:27:29.251 --> 02:27:30.084
<v Speaker 7>accelerated and use that as a pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like that kind of happened all across </v>

3159
02:27:33.001 --> 02:27:34.380
<v Speaker 7>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We Chicago,</v>

3160
02:27:34.410 --> 02:27:36.360
<v Speaker 7>La,</v>
<v Speaker 7>San Francisco,</v>

3161
02:27:36.361 --> 02:27:38.310
<v Speaker 7>they all were nothing and then </v>
<v Speaker 7>everything,</v>

3162
02:27:38.430 --> 02:27:39.070
<v Speaker 7>you know</v>

3163
02:27:39.070 --> 02:27:42.040
<v Speaker 3>say New York won't be here in a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>years because of the water rising up.</v>

3164
02:27:42.041 --> 02:27:43.660
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be crazy.</v>

3165
02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:45.310
<v Speaker 3>Fuck fuck.</v>

3166
02:27:46.180 --> 02:27:47.013
<v Speaker 7>Well we have a water crisis and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 7>parts of the country just got to suck </v>

3167
02:27:48.821 --> 02:27:53.020
<v Speaker 7>the water out of the ocean and use it to</v>
<v Speaker 7>spray all these dry ass bushes.</v>

3168
02:27:53.021 --> 02:27:53.854
<v Speaker 7>So we stop the fires.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yo mother thinking I'm always thinking </v>

3169
02:27:57.460 --> 02:28:00.670
<v Speaker 7>suck the water out of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Stop.</v>

3170
02:28:00.910 --> 02:28:01.743
<v Speaker 7>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>stop making new houses for a while and </v>

3171
02:28:03.731 --> 02:28:06.490
<v Speaker 7>start concentrating on sucking the water</v>
<v Speaker 7>out of the ocean to put out the fire.</v>

3172
02:28:06.670 --> 02:28:08.050
<v Speaker 7>Just water.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All those trees.</v>

3173
02:28:08.550 --> 02:28:11.140
<v Speaker 3>Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suck out the water out of the air.</v>

3174
02:28:11.380 --> 02:28:14.980
<v Speaker 3>Like he could just get a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>humidifiers and then spray the water.</v>

3175
02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:15.873
<v Speaker 3>That's not good because then people </v>
<v Speaker 3>would dry out and then the botox goes </v>

3176
02:28:18.581 --> 02:28:19.900
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I think.</v>

3177
02:28:20.190 --> 02:28:22.040
<v Speaker 7>They got to figure out how to the salt </v>
<v Speaker 7>out of the water.</v>

3178
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:23.450
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>They know how to do it,</v>

3179
02:28:23.451 --> 02:28:27.500
<v Speaker 7>but you can't just take ocean water and </v>
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible] like spray it on your lawn.</v>

3180
02:28:27.710 --> 02:28:29.630
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Kill Your fucking lawn.</v>

3181
02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:31.870
<v Speaker 7>Well on it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know about that.</v>

3182
02:28:31.871 --> 02:28:33.320
<v Speaker 7>It's fake lawn.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

3183
02:28:33.470 --> 02:28:34.303
<v Speaker 7>Then nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean if if you have crops in your </v>

3184
02:28:36.531 --> 02:28:37.364
<v Speaker 7>backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 7>say say if you're growing tomatoes and </v>

3185
02:28:39.591 --> 02:28:43.370
<v Speaker 7>you decide to water it with ocean water,</v>
<v Speaker 7>would that be a bad idea?</v>

3186
02:28:43.371 --> 02:28:44.110
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>

3187
02:28:44.110 --> 02:28:46.090
<v Speaker 3>it would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Assault would be terrible for it,</v>

3188
02:28:46.200 --> 02:28:47.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

3189
02:28:47.500 --> 02:28:48.333
<v Speaker 3>It would just assault would stay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would kill anything else or just see </v>

3190
02:28:49.991 --> 02:28:50.620
<v Speaker 3>red.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3191
02:28:50.620 --> 02:28:52.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's exactly what rest </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

3192
02:28:52.151 --> 02:28:52.984
<v Speaker 3>but it turn into some sort of fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical compound that isn't grass well </v>

3193
02:28:57.610 --> 02:28:58.443
<v Speaker 3>hard water.</v>

3194
02:28:58.560 --> 02:28:59.393
<v Speaker 7>It kind of poison it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It'd be a higher salt content than the </v>

3195
02:29:01.591 --> 02:29:03.390
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the plant wants to exist on.</v>

3196
02:29:03.980 --> 02:29:04.813
<v Speaker 7>And I think that would be the case with </v>
<v Speaker 7>a lot of stuff that doesn't live in the </v>

3197
02:29:07.411 --> 02:29:08.250
<v Speaker 7>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

3198
02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:11.280
<v Speaker 7>So you'd have to figure out a way to get</v>
<v Speaker 7>that salt out.</v>

3199
02:29:11.430 --> 02:29:14.220
<v Speaker 7>But once you did that water be super </v>
<v Speaker 7>valuable.</v>

3200
02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:17.130
<v Speaker 7>Like we're always low on water just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and we have too much of it now.</v>

3201
02:29:17.220 --> 02:29:22.220
<v Speaker 7>It starts sucking out of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just use our own need to like we have a,</v>

3202
02:29:23.460 --> 02:29:26.400
<v Speaker 7>a crazy need to use stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3203
02:29:26.580 --> 02:29:31.260
<v Speaker 7>a constant need.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We have a constant need for consumption.</v>

3204
02:29:31.380 --> 02:29:33.480
<v Speaker 7>So let's consume the water in the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>suck it out.</v>

3205
02:29:33.510 --> 02:29:34.250
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3206
02:29:34.250 --> 02:29:35.083
<v Speaker 3>they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just very expensive and it's like </v>

3207
02:29:36.811 --> 02:29:37.644
<v Speaker 3>they do it in San Diego.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a salt water plant or </v>

3208
02:29:38.941 --> 02:29:40.080
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

3209
02:29:40.081 --> 02:29:41.250
<v Speaker 3>we just got to get better at that.</v>

3210
02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:43.310
<v Speaker 7>Better process for it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3211
02:29:43.311 --> 02:29:46.490
<v Speaker 7>See everybody is concentrating.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All the money is in robot fuck doll.</v>

3212
02:29:46.491 --> 02:29:48.290
<v Speaker 7>So not spending any time working on this</v>
<v Speaker 7>water</v>

3213
02:29:48.450 --> 02:29:50.230
<v Speaker 3>problem must get on top of that,</v>

3214
02:29:52.790 --> 02:29:53.930
<v Speaker 7>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You got to figure this out,</v>

3215
02:29:53.940 --> 02:29:54.773
<v Speaker 7>Ilan.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It can be done and cancer to cancer </v>

3216
02:29:58.251 --> 02:30:02.060
<v Speaker 7>first.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think cancer can be severely medicated</v>

3217
02:30:02.061 --> 02:30:02.894
<v Speaker 7>in some circumstances by diet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I think that's the thing to </v>

3218
02:30:06.081 --> 02:30:08.960
<v Speaker 7>concentrate on first before a pill.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Brian,</v>

3219
02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.880
<v Speaker 7>that's probably crispr.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Crispr.</v>

3220
02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:14.690
<v Speaker 7>Imagine if there was a way you could </v>
<v Speaker 7>just eat shit all day and be jacked.</v>

<v Speaker 3>John.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we do that kill Tony Show and </v>

3226

<v Speaker 3>Jeremiah Watkins and Tony Hinchcliffe </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of copied like,</v>

3227
02:30:30.471 --> 02:30:32.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the Toms digger formula,</v>

3228
02:30:32.360 --> 02:30:35.990
<v Speaker 3>but backwards to see how much weight </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can gain in a month.</v>

3229
02:30:36.200 --> 02:30:41.200
<v Speaker 3>Tony did the like working out and trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to gain muscle weight,</v>

3230
02:30:41.770 --> 02:30:44.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where Jeremiah just ate like shit for 30</v>

3231
02:30:44.241 --> 02:30:49.241
<v Speaker 3>days and gain 30 pounds in 30 days where</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tony only gained 2.5</v>

3232
02:30:50.391 --> 02:30:51.380
<v Speaker 3>pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was.</v>

3233
02:30:51.550 --> 02:30:53.770
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was just over three pounds.</v>

3234
02:30:54.340 --> 02:30:55.390
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3235
02:30:55.510 --> 02:30:58.960
<v Speaker 7>30 pounds to Tony Hinchcliffe who gained</v>
<v Speaker 7>just over three pounds.</v>

3236
02:30:58.990 --> 02:30:59.823
<v Speaker 7>Jeremiah one nugget.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The hose killed Tony Show and keep his </v>

3237
02:31:01.241 --> 02:31:02.074
<v Speaker 7>hair.</v>

3238
02:31:02.200 --> 02:31:03.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bullshit was in the bed though.</v>

3239
02:31:03.790 --> 02:31:04.623
<v Speaker 3>And one of the most funniest nights I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>had in a long time was you calling out </v>

3240
02:31:08.591 --> 02:31:12.760
<v Speaker 3>Tony about how it's not fair if Jeremiah</v>
<v Speaker 3>loss,</v>

3241
02:31:12.761 --> 02:31:14.140
<v Speaker 3>he had to shave his head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3242
02:31:14.141 --> 02:31:14.900
<v Speaker 3>this is what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

3243
02:31:14.900 --> 02:31:18.300
<v Speaker 7>why this is not an even bet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you guys should both be betting the</v>

3244
02:31:18.301 --> 02:31:20.970
<v Speaker 7>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like if Jeremiah wins,</v>

3245
02:31:21.450 --> 02:31:25.170
<v Speaker 7>all he does is get to sit down in a seat</v>
<v Speaker 7>for like a day.</v>

3246
02:31:25.530 --> 02:31:27.390
<v Speaker 7>He gets a hosted,</v>
<v Speaker 7>an episode of the podcast,</v>

3247
02:31:27.391 --> 02:31:29.250
<v Speaker 7>he gets to sit in a seat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So everybody knows it's funny,</v>

3248
02:31:29.550 --> 02:31:34.550
<v Speaker 7>but if he won or if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he has to shave his fucking head.</v>

3249
02:31:35.670 --> 02:31:36.503
<v Speaker 7>Like that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And Jeremiah has nice long hair where </v>

3250
02:31:39.081 --> 02:31:41.820
<v Speaker 7>Tony has really short hair would have </v>
<v Speaker 7>grown back in like a day.</v>

3251
02:31:42.350 --> 02:31:43.183
<v Speaker 7>Jeremiah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>his hair seems like kind of a part of </v>

3252
02:31:44.581 --> 02:31:47.040
<v Speaker 7>who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like just get silly hair.</v>

3253
02:31:47.070 --> 02:31:49.680
<v Speaker 7>It's just big silly fella.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

3254
02:31:49.681 --> 02:31:51.240
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he likes his haircut.</v>

3255
02:31:52.330 --> 02:31:53.163
<v Speaker 7>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he was willing to do it and I told </v>

3256
02:31:55.141 --> 02:31:55.621
<v Speaker 7>Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

3257
02:31:55.621 --> 02:31:56.311
<v Speaker 7>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I go,</v>

3258
02:31:56.311 --> 02:31:57.091
<v Speaker 7>look dude,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you got to,</v>

3259
02:31:57.091 --> 02:31:58.410
<v Speaker 7>you guys have to have the same bet.</v>

3260
02:31:58.620 --> 02:31:59.730
<v Speaker 7>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why are you scared to shave your head?</v>

3261
02:31:59.731 --> 02:32:00.840
<v Speaker 7>It'd be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I go,</v>

3262
02:32:00.841 --> 02:32:01.860
<v Speaker 7>how about this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>How about even better?</v>

3263
02:32:01.861 --> 02:32:04.590
<v Speaker 7>You don't have to shave your head.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have to wear lipstick on stage for a</v>

3264
02:32:04.590 --> 02:32:05.460
<v Speaker 7>year.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tony said that.</v>

3265
02:32:05.870 --> 02:32:08.580
<v Speaker 7>What did it Tony Bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're like,</v>

3266
02:32:08.581 --> 02:32:10.650
<v Speaker 7>hey joe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Joe was my joke.</v>

3267
02:32:11.370 --> 02:32:13.680
<v Speaker 7>You don't remember what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I said it.</v>

3268
02:32:13.681 --> 02:32:15.790
<v Speaker 7>And then after I was trying to force him</v>
<v Speaker 7>into doing,</v>

3269
02:32:15.810 --> 02:32:16.740
<v Speaker 7>cause he didn't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I go,</v>

3270
02:32:16.741 --> 02:32:17.574
<v Speaker 7>you know what's fucked up?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was Tony's idea and I just threw him </v>

3271
02:32:20.071 --> 02:32:21.090
<v Speaker 7>under the bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

3272
02:32:21.091 --> 02:32:22.560
<v Speaker 7>I don't know why you want to wear </v>
<v Speaker 7>lipstick,</v>

3273
02:32:22.561 --> 02:32:23.700
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is weird.</v>

3274
02:32:23.760 --> 02:32:25.180
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That he really did.</v>

3275
02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:26.840
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

3276
02:32:26.850 --> 02:32:27.361
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

3277
02:32:27.361 --> 02:32:30.090
<v Speaker 7>Do you remember I was saying that </v>
<v Speaker 7>everybody was dying laughing.</v>

3278
02:32:30.570 --> 02:32:31.403
<v Speaker 7>The reason why everybody was dying </v>
<v Speaker 7>laughing because they knew I was just </v>

3279
02:32:32.731 --> 02:32:33.420
<v Speaker 7>fucking with them.</v>

3280
02:32:33.420 --> 02:32:34.710
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was his idea,</v>

3281
02:32:34.711 --> 02:32:38.040
<v Speaker 7>which was so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3282
02:32:38.041 --> 02:32:38.874
<v Speaker 7>but the idea was you would have to go on</v>
<v Speaker 7>stage and then once you're on stage you </v>

3283
02:32:41.101 --> 02:32:43.920
<v Speaker 7>have to put lipstick on or we would </v>
<v Speaker 7>decide that you,</v>

3284
02:32:43.921 --> 02:32:46.110
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>had to have it on when you walked out to</v>

3285
02:32:46.111 --> 02:32:48.900
<v Speaker 7>the crowd either or.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We didn't decide.</v>

3286
02:32:48.901 --> 02:32:50.970
<v Speaker 7>And then you could take it off after 15 </v>
<v Speaker 7>minutes.</v>

3287
02:32:51.150 --> 02:32:55.110
<v Speaker 7>So if you were doing like a headline of </v>
<v Speaker 7>set somewhere and he'd do an an hour for</v>

3288
02:32:55.111 --> 02:32:56.820
<v Speaker 7>the first 15 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're wearing makeup.</v>

3289
02:32:57.230 --> 02:32:58.260
<v Speaker 7>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but here,</v>

3290
02:32:58.290 --> 02:32:59.123
<v Speaker 7>the thing about that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the thing about that beautiful red </v>

3291
02:33:01.021 --> 02:33:06.021
<v Speaker 7>lipstick is that it would make you </v>
<v Speaker 7>concentrate on a joke about why the fuck</v>

3292
02:33:07.021 --> 02:33:10.080
<v Speaker 7>you were willing to make a bat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How you lost the bat,</v>

3293
02:33:10.470 --> 02:33:12.450
<v Speaker 7>what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then rationalize,</v>

3294
02:33:12.480 --> 02:33:14.460
<v Speaker 7>rationalize away about nothing wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How come?</v>

3295
02:33:14.461 --> 02:33:16.740
<v Speaker 7>Chapsticks okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but lipstick gain,</v>

3296
02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:18.800
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how come girls get the word lipstick,</v>

3297
02:33:18.810 --> 02:33:19.530
<v Speaker 7>Bro?</v>

3298
02:33:19.530 --> 02:33:22.020
<v Speaker 7>What the fuck are we doing man?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like what is this?</v>

3299
02:33:22.740 --> 02:33:25.200
<v Speaker 7>Dad had been so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If he had to wear lipstick for a year,</v>

3300
02:33:25.320 --> 02:33:28.340
<v Speaker 7>it would have been hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He wouldn't,</v>

3301
02:33:28.341 --> 02:33:29.670
<v Speaker 7>it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I told them I would do it too.</v>

3302
02:33:30.540 --> 02:33:31.373
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You got home?</v>

3303
02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:32.280
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I said I'd do it.</v>

3304
02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:33.240
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I'll do it too.</v>

3305
02:33:33.300 --> 02:33:34.260
<v Speaker 7>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We'll all do it together.</v>

3306
02:33:34.470 --> 02:33:36.470
<v Speaker 7>Don't be scared.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Take it back.</v>

3307
02:33:36.930 --> 02:33:39.300
<v Speaker 7>It's not a hard bed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's funny.</v>

3308
02:33:40.170 --> 02:33:41.003
<v Speaker 7>You'd have to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you'd have to like have the lipstick </v>

3309
02:33:42.570 --> 02:33:45.390
<v Speaker 7>years photos where every time we were on</v>
<v Speaker 7>stage and just what you have,</v>

3310
02:33:45.391 --> 02:33:46.224
<v Speaker 7>you have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like a package of wet wipes with you </v>

3311
02:33:48.810 --> 02:33:53.280
<v Speaker 7>bring on stage and a dry white towel and</v>
<v Speaker 7>everybody knows you got 15 minutes,</v>

3312
02:33:53.290 --> 02:33:55.920
<v Speaker 7>lipstick time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You might grow to like it,</v>

3313
02:33:56.610 --> 02:33:58.410
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he might start getting her nails did and</v>

3314
02:33:58.411 --> 02:33:59.244
<v Speaker 7>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You definitely could come up with bits </v>

3315
02:34:01.711 --> 02:34:02.544
<v Speaker 7>from it.</v>

3316
02:34:02.820 --> 02:34:05.300
<v Speaker 7>It could be possible and it would be fun</v>
<v Speaker 7>for people to,</v>

3317
02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:09.840
<v Speaker 7>to like go along with Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Can't handle that.</v>

3318
02:34:10.640 --> 02:34:12.780
<v Speaker 7>Johnny scared.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I feel like he's scared.</v>

3319
02:34:12.781 --> 02:34:13.614
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it should at least shave his </v>

3320
02:34:14.551 --> 02:34:17.040
<v Speaker 7>head.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He should've shaved his head.</v>

3321
02:34:17.290 --> 02:34:20.440
<v Speaker 7>He should've had a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Obviously he has way more beautiful hair</v>

3322
02:34:20.441 --> 02:34:21.730
<v Speaker 7>than I do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

3323
02:34:21.731 --> 02:34:22.564
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I feel like if I had good hair and </v>

3324
02:34:24.431 --> 02:34:26.500
<v Speaker 7>shave it off cause I knew it would come </v>
<v Speaker 7>back.</v>

3325
02:34:26.530 --> 02:34:28.390
<v Speaker 7>It's super shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tony has super shirts.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Izzard.</v>

3328
02:34:35.770 --> 02:34:36.603
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>living as a woman now somebody told me </v>

3329
02:34:39.281 --> 02:34:40.630
<v Speaker 7>that I really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Mom,</v>

3331
02:34:42.100 --> 02:34:42.933
<v Speaker 7>not necessarily living as a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's still looks like as Eddie has her </v>

3332
02:34:45.531 --> 02:34:48.130
<v Speaker 7>dress with lipstick and a dress.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I Dunno.</v>

02:34:48.910 --> 02:34:52.360
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Eddie Izzard we'll have my respect for,</v>

3334
02:34:53.020 --> 02:34:56.110
<v Speaker 7>for all his days because Eddie Izzard,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3335
02:34:56.410 --> 02:35:01.410
<v Speaker 7>ran a marathon a day with no training </v>
<v Speaker 7>all around Ireland.</v>

3336
02:35:04.330 --> 02:35:05.740
<v Speaker 7>Do you know about that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dude?</v>

3337
02:35:06.110 --> 02:35:08.080
<v Speaker 7>He didn't even prepare for it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

3338
02:35:08.170 --> 02:35:10.120
<v Speaker 7>He didn't even prepare for it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He just finished him.</v>

3339
02:35:10.270 --> 02:35:11.830
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he did it all.</v>

3340
02:35:11.890 --> 02:35:15.130
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He wrote up marathon a day for like four</v>

3341
02:35:15.131 --> 02:35:16.600
<v Speaker 7>weeks or something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

3342
02:35:16.601 --> 02:35:20.080
<v Speaker 7>Wasn't it dude,</v>
<v Speaker 7>his feet were literally falling apart.</v>

3343
02:35:20.470 --> 02:35:24.040
<v Speaker 7>Like they would show them cleaning up </v>
<v Speaker 7>his feet and taking care of his skin.</v>

3344
02:35:24.041 --> 02:35:26.170
<v Speaker 7>It was just torn to pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 7>mad.</v>

3345
02:35:26.860 --> 02:35:31.860
<v Speaker 7>It was just straight,</v>
<v Speaker 7>raw mental toughness and a resolve that,</v>

3346
02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:34.240
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you think about him,</v>

3347
02:35:34.241 --> 02:35:37.630
<v Speaker 7>you think about him as a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a funny guy,</v>

3348
02:35:37.631 --> 02:35:38.464
<v Speaker 7>a thoughtful guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and he had that odd thing that he was </v>

3349
02:35:40.331 --> 02:35:43.780
<v Speaker 7>doing where he was wearing women's </v>
<v Speaker 7>clothes and all that stuff.</v>

3350
02:35:44.050 --> 02:35:46.360
<v Speaker 7>27 marathons in 27 days.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3351
02:35:46.361 --> 02:35:47.194
<v Speaker 7>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't really know what that guy's </v>

3352
02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:53.440
<v Speaker 7>about until you watch this documentary </v>
<v Speaker 7>that you could watch online.</v>

3353
02:35:54.010 --> 02:35:55.660
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what does it,</v>

3354
02:35:55.730 --> 02:35:57.760
<v Speaker 7>is there a name for it where people can </v>
<v Speaker 7>search it?</v>

3355
02:35:58.510 --> 02:35:59.470
<v Speaker 7>It's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

3356
02:36:00.250 --> 02:36:02.710
<v Speaker 7>You'll find it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

3357
02:36:03.820 --> 02:36:05.680
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what he did was,</v>

3358
02:36:05.740 --> 02:36:06.573
<v Speaker 7>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't even remember what the charity </v>

3359
02:36:07.241 --> 02:36:08.620
<v Speaker 7>was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you remember what the charity was?</v>

3360
02:36:09.870 --> 02:36:12.970
<v Speaker 7>Was some sort of a charity?</v>
<v Speaker 7>If he did the 27 marathons,</v>

3361
02:36:13.690 --> 02:36:15.970
<v Speaker 7>I think he only took a couple of days </v>
<v Speaker 7>off,</v>

3362
02:36:16.460 --> 02:36:17.293
<v Speaker 7>like they're here and there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There were days where he literally </v>

3363
02:36:18.821 --> 02:36:19.870
<v Speaker 7>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>couldn't walk.</v>

3364
02:36:19.940 --> 02:36:20.773
<v Speaker 7>He like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he had to,</v>

3365
02:36:20.990 --> 02:36:23.650
<v Speaker 7>I feel like he did this twice to Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 7>Christ.</v>

3366
02:36:23.740 --> 02:36:26.410
<v Speaker 7>This says he did 43 marathons in 51 </v>
<v Speaker 7>days.</v>

3367
02:36:26.470 --> 02:36:28.440
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh my.</v>

3368
02:36:28.630 --> 02:36:31.480
<v Speaker 7>That might be the new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He did it again.</v>

3369
02:36:32.050 --> 02:36:32.883
<v Speaker 7>I bet it was a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Man Doesn't show 43 marathons in 51 </v>

3370
02:36:36.281 --> 02:36:37.420
<v Speaker 7>days.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

3371
02:36:37.421 --> 02:36:38.254
<v Speaker 7>So he did it before.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He did less and then he came back and </v>

3372
02:36:40.781 --> 02:36:41.850
<v Speaker 7>did it again.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

3373
02:36:42.040 --> 02:36:43.600
<v Speaker 7>Somebody told me about it a few years </v>
<v Speaker 7>ago,</v>

3374
02:36:43.601 --> 02:36:44.434
<v Speaker 7>but it was after the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't know he's done it twice kinds </v>

3375
02:36:47.230 --> 02:36:48.850
<v Speaker 7>of fucking animal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy.</v>

3376
02:36:49.060 --> 02:36:50.320
<v Speaker 7>He's an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3377
02:36:50.321 --> 02:36:52.630
<v Speaker 7>that's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But then I read something,</v>

3378
02:36:52.660 --> 02:36:54.820
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>unrelated.</v>

3379
02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:56.280
<v Speaker 7>I read something that he,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3380
02:36:56.500 --> 02:36:59.530
<v Speaker 7>was living as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that might not be real.</v>

3381
02:37:00.110 --> 02:37:02.230
<v Speaker 7>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He might just feel like we're in a dress</v>

3382
02:37:02.231 --> 02:37:03.760
<v Speaker 7>that day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He said he answered,</v>

3383
02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:06.700
<v Speaker 7>you run 53 marathons,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whatever the fuck he did.</v>

3384
02:37:06.701 --> 02:37:07.720
<v Speaker 7>You can do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dude.</v>

3385
02:37:07.740 --> 02:37:12.550
<v Speaker 7>Maybe his dick fell off this in 2016 and</v>
<v Speaker 7>then the first one was in 2009.</v>

3386
02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:13.151
<v Speaker 7>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>

3387
02:37:13.151 --> 02:37:15.920
<v Speaker 7>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because the 2009 one I think I found out</v>

3388
02:37:15.921 --> 02:37:16.340
<v Speaker 7>about</v>

3389
02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:18.950
<v Speaker 2>around 2012 or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember watching it,</v>

3390
02:37:18.951 --> 02:37:19.784
<v Speaker 2>thinking that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a kind of mental toughness that </v>

3391
02:37:26.001 --> 02:37:29.570
<v Speaker 2>very few people have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I have it to run that many</v>

3392
02:37:29.571 --> 02:37:30.404
<v Speaker 2>marathons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how many days you might have to </v>

3393
02:37:32.690 --> 02:37:36.680
<v Speaker 2>force yourself into that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the last day,</v>

3394
02:37:36.830 --> 02:37:39.890
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3395
02:37:39.950 --> 02:37:42.500
<v Speaker 2>He ran a double marathon on the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

3396
02:37:42.590 --> 02:37:45.530
<v Speaker 2>So that was the toughest day of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

3397
02:37:45.531 --> 02:37:46.364
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I've had to take off to go to the </v>

3398
02:37:47.301 --> 02:37:49.130
<v Speaker 2>hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we had to make up one.</v>

3399
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:50.023
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had to go to the hospital to get his </v>

3400
02:37:51.470 --> 02:37:52.303
<v Speaker 2>kidneys checked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on day 27 I ran my 26 and my 27th </v>

3401
02:37:55.941 --> 02:37:59.030
<v Speaker 2>marathon double marathon on the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

3402
02:37:59.031 --> 02:38:01.670
<v Speaker 2>So that was the toughest day of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

3403
02:38:01.671 --> 02:38:03.410
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is not a regular person.</v>

3404
02:38:03.560 --> 02:38:07.010
<v Speaker 2>A guy who is not like a Cam Haynes type </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who's in shape,</v>

3405
02:38:07.011 --> 02:38:10.160
<v Speaker 2>who could just do like campaigns can run</v>
<v Speaker 2>a marathon a day and it's not hard.</v>

3406
02:38:10.490 --> 02:38:11.323
<v Speaker 2>Like if he no bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he wanted to go and do 27 marathons </v>

3407
02:38:14.541 --> 02:38:15.770
<v Speaker 2>in 27 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd be like,</v>

3408
02:38:15.771 --> 02:38:16.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done that already.</v>

3409
02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:19.040
<v Speaker 2>He could just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can go do that.</v>

3410
02:38:19.190 --> 02:38:22.550
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Eddie Izzard was not,</v>

3411
02:38:22.970 --> 02:38:25.880
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't planning for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He liked,</v>

3412
02:38:25.881 --> 02:38:29.390
<v Speaker 2>he didn't get in shape before he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless he did the second time,</v>

3413
02:38:29.870 --> 02:38:33.410
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong about the second time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first time he did it,</v>

3414
02:38:33.890 --> 02:38:34.723
<v Speaker 2>he didn't get in shape for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to see him run in those 27 </v>

3415
02:38:37.641 --> 02:38:39.440
<v Speaker 2>marathons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

3416
02:38:39.620 --> 02:38:42.740
<v Speaker 2>it's all just mental toughness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just forced his body to keep moving.</v>

3417
02:38:43.130 --> 02:38:45.560
<v Speaker 2>What does it say here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going into politics and 20,</v>

3418
02:38:45.561 --> 02:38:46.341
<v Speaker 2>20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

3419
02:38:46.341 --> 02:38:47.390
<v Speaker 2>King of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Izzard,</v>

3420
02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:48.673
<v Speaker 2>he maybe he's the first print </v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender president if he decided to </v>

3421
02:38:52.611 --> 02:38:56.810
<v Speaker 2>go for it to be born here and we fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>that well,</v>

3422
02:38:56.811 --> 02:38:57.644
<v Speaker 2>president of where they live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also did all these marathons in South </v>

3423
02:39:01.070 --> 02:39:03.980
<v Speaker 2>Africa where the weather was a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>hotter than it wouldn't be.</v>

3424
02:39:04.370 --> 02:39:07.760
<v Speaker 2>And listen to Dan were music duck and </v>
<v Speaker 2>crocodiles.</v>

3425
02:39:09.700 --> 02:39:10.533
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3426
02:39:11.190 --> 02:39:14.490
<v Speaker 2>So he's going to go into a um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3427
02:39:14.500 --> 02:39:15.540
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his reasoning here,</v>

3428
02:39:15.541 --> 02:39:16.770
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I pulled that up.</v>

3429
02:39:17.100 --> 02:39:17.933
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's doing these races just to get </v>

3430
02:39:20.881 --> 02:39:22.800
<v Speaker 2>people to pay attention to the messages </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind.</v>

3431
02:39:22.801 --> 02:39:24.840
<v Speaker 2>He's not really into racing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

3432
02:39:25.640 --> 02:39:26.473
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3433
02:39:29.230 --> 02:39:32.770
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a very thoughtful guy and,</v>

3434
02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:33.633
<v Speaker 2>but what impressed me the most is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like the words that he strings </v>

3435
02:39:36.731 --> 02:39:39.340
<v Speaker 2>together and how he says things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is always impressive,</v>

3436
02:39:39.910 --> 02:39:43.720
<v Speaker 2>but someone who can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that is not normal.</v>

3437
02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:47.290
<v Speaker 2>That's extraordinary because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

3438
02:39:48.070 --> 02:39:51.190
<v Speaker 2>it would be extraordinary for someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's in great shape,</v>

3439
02:39:51.700 --> 02:39:55.240
<v Speaker 2>like a person who is like a um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3440
02:39:55.241 --> 02:39:57.850
<v Speaker 2>world class like that Courtney Dole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walter Lady,</v>

3441
02:39:57.851 --> 02:40:02.620
<v Speaker 2>if she ran 27 marathons in 27 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would still be remarkably impressive.</v>

3442
02:40:02.650 --> 02:40:03.483
<v Speaker 2>It is just the amount of time that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to spend running every day for 27 </v>

3443
02:40:07.451 --> 02:40:09.010
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit is impressive.</v>

3444
02:40:10.030 --> 02:40:11.140
<v Speaker 2>That's just impressive.</v>

3445
02:40:13.800 --> 02:40:14.633
<v Speaker 5>But</v>

3446
02:40:14.840 --> 02:40:19.550
<v Speaker 7>to do it when you're just a guy who's a </v>
<v Speaker 7>comic and did not even in shape,</v>

3447
02:40:19.610 --> 02:40:21.590
<v Speaker 7>he wasn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he wasn't even thin.</v>

3448
02:40:21.650 --> 02:40:23.600
<v Speaker 7>You have like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like a bit of a belly,</v>

3449
02:40:24.990 --> 02:40:26.990
<v Speaker 7>but he wasn't lean by any stretch of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>imagination.</v>

3450
02:40:26.991 --> 02:40:29.490
<v Speaker 7>It didn't look like a runner.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Does he still do comedy?</v>

3451
02:40:30.030 --> 02:40:30.863
<v Speaker 7>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I feel like I haven't seen or heard </v>

3452
02:40:33.151 --> 02:40:34.840
<v Speaker 7>about him in a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think we'll,</v>

3453
02:40:34.920 --> 02:40:35.753
<v Speaker 7>we're guilty over here of not paying </v>
<v Speaker 7>attention to what happens in comedy </v>

3454
02:40:37.640 --> 02:40:39.020
<v Speaker 7>anywhere else in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3455
02:40:39.021 --> 02:40:39.854
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had somebody has to like beat me over </v>

3456
02:40:40.681 --> 02:40:41.514
<v Speaker 7>the head with somebody that's really </v>
<v Speaker 7>funny from somewhere else for me to pay </v>

3457
02:40:42.871 --> 02:40:43.704
<v Speaker 7>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just saw that they have roast battle </v>

3458
02:40:45.391 --> 02:40:47.750
<v Speaker 7>now and in UK.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Here he goes,</v>

3459
02:40:47.910 --> 02:40:51.450
<v Speaker 7>Eddie izzard believe me tour.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not that it matters,</v>

3460
02:40:51.451 --> 02:40:53.430
<v Speaker 7>but find out if he's a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She in French.</v>

3461
02:40:53.940 --> 02:40:56.730
<v Speaker 7>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Of course he's a genius.</v>

3462
02:40:56.760 --> 02:40:59.790
<v Speaker 7>Fuck guys doing shows in French.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The show was in French.</v>

3463
02:40:59.791 --> 02:41:01.020
<v Speaker 7>Just shows in French.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's sows.</v>

3464
02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:02.633
<v Speaker 7>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm gonna go there with those Google </v>

3465
02:41:04.440 --> 02:41:05.273
<v Speaker 7>Pixel headsets.</v>

3466
02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:08.400
<v Speaker 7>It's all he stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3467
02:41:08.401 --> 02:41:09.210
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>

3468
02:41:09.210 --> 02:41:10.340
<v Speaker 7>that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3469
02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:13.380
<v Speaker 7>originally I got the idea of us being </v>
<v Speaker 7>able to communicate with plants.</v>

3470
02:41:13.740 --> 02:41:17.090
<v Speaker 7>I figured this is step one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Step one is the Google Pixel earbuds.</v>

3471
02:41:17.091 --> 02:41:17.924
<v Speaker 7>It let you listen to someone speak </v>
<v Speaker 7>Spanish and real time translate it to </v>

3472
02:41:19.981 --> 02:41:22.650
<v Speaker 7>English.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Step two is they figure out some sort of</v>

3473
02:41:22.651 --> 02:41:23.484
<v Speaker 7>a universal code that the plant world is</v>
<v Speaker 7>willing to accept and we start </v>

3474
02:41:26.551 --> 02:41:28.530
<v Speaker 7>communicating back and forth to the </v>
<v Speaker 7>plant world.</v>

3475
02:41:28.710 --> 02:41:30.960
<v Speaker 7>Step three,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they develop a headset,</v>

3476
02:41:30.961 --> 02:41:33.810
<v Speaker 7>some sort of a neural interface with a </v>
<v Speaker 7>human being.</v>

3477
02:41:33.811 --> 02:41:34.644
<v Speaker 7>When they put this thing on and you go </v>
<v Speaker 7>out into the forest and you communicate </v>

3478
02:41:36.691 --> 02:41:39.060
<v Speaker 7>with the trees,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's frequency.</v>

3479
02:41:39.120 --> 02:41:42.040
<v Speaker 7>I say that hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why Not Joe?</v>

3480
02:41:42.150 --> 02:41:45.120
<v Speaker 7>I have to do is get them to obviously </v>
<v Speaker 7>communicating with themselves.</v>

3481
02:41:45.510 --> 02:41:47.610
<v Speaker 7>There's some form of communication </v>
<v Speaker 7>between plants.</v>

3482
02:41:47.611 --> 02:41:50.340
<v Speaker 7>This has been proven cause a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 7>weird shit they do.</v>

3483
02:41:50.340 --> 02:41:53.940
<v Speaker 7>Like they changed the way they taste </v>
<v Speaker 7>based on whether or not they hear things</v>

3484
02:41:53.941 --> 02:41:54.774
<v Speaker 7>going on in the distance that he or </v>
<v Speaker 7>someone eating them in the distance and </v>

3485
02:41:57.331 --> 02:41:58.164
<v Speaker 7>they'll change the way they taste.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They catch things down wind like the </v>

3486
02:42:00.601 --> 02:42:01.434
<v Speaker 7>smell of them getting consumed by </v>
<v Speaker 7>another animal will change the way they </v>

3487
02:42:04.081 --> 02:42:05.940
<v Speaker 7>test.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like that was the case.</v>

3488
02:42:05.941 --> 02:42:06.630
<v Speaker 7>What the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3489
02:42:06.630 --> 02:42:07.463
<v Speaker 7>Keisha Bush and giraffes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they found that giraffes that we're </v>

3490
02:42:10.381 --> 02:42:12.630
<v Speaker 7>eating these Acacia Bushes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3491
02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:15.210
<v Speaker 7>upwind.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Upwind when it's downwind,</v>

3492
02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:16.290
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>down upwind.</v>

3493
02:42:16.500 --> 02:42:17.333
<v Speaker 7>When they would eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the smell of them consuming them would </v>

3494
02:42:20.131 --> 02:42:24.600
<v Speaker 7>come down when and it would change the </v>
<v Speaker 7>flavor profile of all these other trees.</v>

3495
02:42:24.810 --> 02:42:27.900
<v Speaker 7>They would turn nasty tasting to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 7>the giraffes from eating them.</v>

3496
02:42:28.030 --> 02:42:30.420
<v Speaker 7>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's crazy dude.</v>

3497
02:42:30.540 --> 02:42:31.373
<v Speaker 7>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then they figured out that they could </v>

3498
02:42:32.461 --> 02:42:33.294
<v Speaker 7>play the sound of caterpillars munching </v>
<v Speaker 7>leaves right next to the tree and it </v>

3499
02:42:39.061 --> 02:42:41.550
<v Speaker 7>would have the same effect.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

3500
02:42:41.970 --> 02:42:42.840
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

3501
02:42:44.070 --> 02:42:44.903
<v Speaker 7>somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they know what it sounds like when </v>

3502
02:42:46.351 --> 02:42:48.510
<v Speaker 7>they're eating.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if they try everything like</v>

3503
02:42:48.511 --> 02:42:53.340
<v Speaker 7>we're going to have sex with this tree </v>
<v Speaker 7>and just see what happens or vertical.</v>

3504
02:42:53.341 --> 02:42:54.174
<v Speaker 7>The tree vegans are super not happy </v>
<v Speaker 7>about plants being alive and thinking </v>

3505
02:42:57.730 --> 02:42:59.310
<v Speaker 7>you bring it up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they get so triggered.</v>

3506
02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:00.433
<v Speaker 7>It is one of the most triggering things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>His plant intelligence research they </v>

3507
02:43:03.571 --> 02:43:05.670
<v Speaker 7>cause they want to claim moral </v>
<v Speaker 7>superiority.</v>

3508
02:43:05.970 --> 02:43:07.320
<v Speaker 7>They want to claim that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know La,</v>

3509
02:43:07.321 --> 02:43:07.771
<v Speaker 7>la,</v>
<v Speaker 7>la,</v>

3510
02:43:07.771 --> 02:43:08.604
<v Speaker 7>I can't hear the plant.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's that cabbage is screaming when </v>

3511
02:43:11.171 --> 02:43:14.500
<v Speaker 7>you pull it out of the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you fuck screaming for its family.</v>

3512
02:43:14.501 --> 02:43:19.501
<v Speaker 7>The interconnectedness with the mycelium</v>
<v Speaker 7>and the soil just beautiful.</v>

3513
02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:21.490
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

3514
02:43:21.610 --> 02:43:22.443
<v Speaker 7>but I think what's going to fix veganism</v>
<v Speaker 7>honestly is that a robot meet that that </v>

3515
02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:30.790
<v Speaker 7>artificial lab created meat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was going to fix it.</v>

3516
02:43:31.150 --> 02:43:31.983
<v Speaker 7>People are gonna realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yo all just healthier this way he body </v>

3517
02:43:34.450 --> 02:43:36.400
<v Speaker 7>has more vitality.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's going to be extinct,</v>

3518
02:43:37.180 --> 02:43:39.310
<v Speaker 7>veganism is going to be extinct in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>future.</v>

3519
02:43:39.580 --> 02:43:41.920
<v Speaker 7>As soon as they come up with super </v>
<v Speaker 7>ethical meat,</v>

3520
02:43:42.070 --> 02:43:44.790
<v Speaker 7>there's going to be no reason for it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everybody's going to go watch too.</v>

3521
02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:46.330
<v Speaker 7>And I feel so much better when I eat </v>
<v Speaker 7>steak.</v>

3522
02:43:47.860 --> 02:43:52.860
<v Speaker 7>It's just fuck like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

3523
02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:56.590
<v Speaker 7>there's obviously a reason why we're </v>
<v Speaker 7>having all this debate.</v>

3524
02:43:56.591 --> 02:43:58.570
<v Speaker 7>It's not like it's crystal clear one way</v>
<v Speaker 7>or another.</v>

3525
02:43:58.600 --> 02:44:01.360
<v Speaker 7>It's like it's not good that an animal </v>
<v Speaker 7>die so that you'll live.</v>

3526
02:44:01.390 --> 02:44:03.040
<v Speaker 7>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That doesn't feel good,</v>

3527
02:44:03.280 --> 02:44:05.260
<v Speaker 7>but it's not good if they get over </v>
<v Speaker 7>populated either.</v>

3528
02:44:05.740 --> 02:44:06.940
<v Speaker 7>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's not good either.</v>

3529
02:44:07.510 --> 02:44:08.343
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was what I was reading this thing </v>

3530
02:44:08.801 --> 02:44:09.640
<v Speaker 7>about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3531
02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:12.610
<v Speaker 7>there's an animal called an hour dad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like a sheep.</v>

3532
02:44:13.570 --> 02:44:15.310
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>

3533
02:44:15.311 --> 02:44:16.144
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>imported them to Texas a long time ago </v>

3534
02:44:19.301 --> 02:44:22.750
<v Speaker 7>and they don't taste good to eat </v>
<v Speaker 7>apparently.</v>

3535
02:44:23.110 --> 02:44:24.970
<v Speaker 7>Or maybe a lot of people were eating in </v>
<v Speaker 7>the wrong way.</v>

3536
02:44:25.270 --> 02:44:27.460
<v Speaker 7>So because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they don't hunt them a lot.</v>

3537
02:44:27.850 --> 02:44:28.683
<v Speaker 7>Or if they do hunt them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's not like the same way they hunt </v>

3538
02:44:29.861 --> 02:44:33.640
<v Speaker 7>whitetail deer or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And they live in these like difficult to</v>

3539
02:44:33.641 --> 02:44:36.250
<v Speaker 7>get to remote parts of like West Texas </v>
<v Speaker 7>and shit.</v>

3540
02:44:36.610 --> 02:44:37.443
<v Speaker 7>And so then some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the ranchers have taken to like firing </v>

3541
02:44:41.560 --> 02:44:43.570
<v Speaker 7>guns out of helicopters to get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 7>him.</v>

3542
02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:48.230
<v Speaker 7>Like this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you have animals that you're,</v>

3543
02:44:48.231 --> 02:44:51.800
<v Speaker 7>you're hunting with helicopters that you</v>
<v Speaker 7>brought over here from another place,</v>

3544
02:44:52.100 --> 02:44:54.920
<v Speaker 7>but they look like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just like they're cool looking man.</v>

3545
02:44:55.190 --> 02:44:56.990
<v Speaker 7>They look like some sort of a star wars </v>
<v Speaker 7>type</v>

3546
02:44:58.630 --> 02:45:01.000
<v Speaker 7>goat creature,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sheep creature.</v>

3547
02:45:01.030 --> 02:45:04.990
<v Speaker 7>They have the amazing horns.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There was enormous horns,</v>

3548
02:45:05.140 --> 02:45:07.720
<v Speaker 7>but apparently they just can't figure </v>
<v Speaker 7>out a way to make them taste good.</v>

3549
02:45:08.260 --> 02:45:10.480
<v Speaker 7>This is from everybody that I know </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's tried to eat them,</v>

3550
02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:12.190
<v Speaker 7>give it to an Asian now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>figure it out.</v>

3551
02:45:12.940 --> 02:45:13.773
<v Speaker 7>It's probably a good call.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wonder if there must be somebody that </v>

3552
02:45:15.941 --> 02:45:17.650
<v Speaker 7>thinks they taste good and knows the </v>
<v Speaker 7>dude,</v>

3553
02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:19.360
<v Speaker 7>but pull up a picture of an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dad,</v>

3554
02:45:19.361 --> 02:45:20.194
<v Speaker 7>sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

3555
02:45:20.950 --> 02:45:22.620
<v Speaker 7>will you look for,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I haven't.</v>

3556
02:45:22.621 --> 02:45:24.280
<v Speaker 7>I'll Wafi sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3557
02:45:24.281 --> 02:45:24.761
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

3558
02:45:24.761 --> 02:45:28.210
<v Speaker 7>it's called Aoudad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're like one of the few animals that</v>

3559
02:45:28.211 --> 02:45:30.280
<v Speaker 7>are like universally thought to tastes </v>
<v Speaker 7>like shit.</v>

3560
02:45:30.460 --> 02:45:32.020
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>From people that hunt them,</v>

3561
02:45:32.021 --> 02:45:34.120
<v Speaker 7>but they're here and they have to </v>
<v Speaker 7>control their population.</v>

3562
02:45:34.121 --> 02:45:37.120
<v Speaker 7>So what do you do about them?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What do you do about wild pigs?</v>

3563
02:45:37.121 --> 02:45:40.150
<v Speaker 7>We did do about animals to get to the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>unless you want to let predators loose.</v>

3564
02:45:40.180 --> 02:45:42.130
<v Speaker 7>That's it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That picture.</v>

3565
02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:43.300
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a stone sheep.</v>

3566
02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:44.111
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm,</v>

3567
02:45:44.111 --> 02:45:45.610
<v Speaker 7>it's our dad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

3568
02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:51.720
<v Speaker 7>how'd you spell it out of you a dad?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I only have a picture of those fuckers.</v>

3569
02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:55.270
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Aoudad Hunt Texas,</v>

3570
02:45:55.750 --> 02:45:58.450
<v Speaker 7>but type in that because they're very </v>
<v Speaker 7>popular to hunting in Texas,</v>

3571
02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:02.890
<v Speaker 7>but I don't think a lot of people will.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Our debt hunt Texas.</v>

3572
02:46:03.530 --> 02:46:07.390
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>those are um,</v>

3573
02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:09.980
<v Speaker 7>dear.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's not the same thing about</v>

3574
02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:11.090
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you spell that?</v>

3575
02:46:11.091 --> 02:46:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Our Dad word out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of these things are the Aoudad.</v>

3576
02:46:14.210 --> 02:46:16.130
<v Speaker 1>How would that is like big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thick,</v>

3577
02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:17.113
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horns say it to Siri and see what she </v>

3578
02:46:20.690 --> 02:46:22.430
<v Speaker 1>comes up with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3579
02:46:22.610 --> 02:46:24.950
<v Speaker 1>either way I'll find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3580
02:46:25.690 --> 02:46:27.710
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you do with all the,</v>

3581
02:46:27.890 --> 02:46:31.610
<v Speaker 1>if we did figure out a way to never have</v>
<v Speaker 1>an animal suffer again,</v>

3582
02:46:31.611 --> 02:46:32.444
<v Speaker 1>but we could all eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you do with all the animals </v>

3583
02:46:34.341 --> 02:46:36.740
<v Speaker 1>that existed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a giant dilemma.</v>

3584
02:46:37.250 --> 02:46:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Like how many people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3585
02:46:38.721 --> 02:46:40.130
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all well and good,</v>

3586
02:46:40.131 --> 02:46:43.100
<v Speaker 1>but I want a cow that just got killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a real cow.</v>

3587
02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:45.860
<v Speaker 1>It's really alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me think and feel better.</v>

3588
02:46:47.480 --> 02:46:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Would have to add.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that it?</v>

3589
02:46:49.780 --> 02:46:50.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the closest.</v>

3590
02:46:50.631 --> 02:46:51.464
<v Speaker 1>Some else [inaudible] that's some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of feral sheep all Parra that's weird </v>

3591
02:46:55.541 --> 02:46:56.690
<v Speaker 1>that they don't have Alad Dad.</v>

3592
02:46:57.410 --> 02:47:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Maybe try a different spelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aoudad sheep hunt Texas.</v>

3593
02:47:03.620 --> 02:47:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3594
02:47:06.690 --> 02:47:09.170
<v Speaker 1>the delicate balance of like prey and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Predator.</v>

3595
02:47:09.171 --> 02:47:10.004
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you manage that if you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain populations of these animals </v>

3596
02:47:13.851 --> 02:47:15.800
<v Speaker 1>just running loose?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody sent me a video.</v>

3597
02:47:15.860 --> 02:47:17.320
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just took the word off.</v>

3598
02:47:17.321 --> 02:47:19.850
<v Speaker 1>It just that she texted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go back to that last one you had.</v>

3599
02:47:19.940 --> 02:47:21.620
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

3600
02:47:21.710 --> 02:47:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Look at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the devil.</v>

3601
02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those horns.</v>

3602
02:47:25.310 --> 02:47:26.990
<v Speaker 1>That's like some sate and shit from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Damien.</v>

3603
02:47:28.310 --> 02:47:30.100
<v Speaker 1>It's weird that meat is not just meet </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3604
02:47:30.101 --> 02:47:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Like he can't just like take that leg </v>
<v Speaker 1>off and eat it.</v>

3605
02:47:33.530 --> 02:47:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely different.</v>

3606
02:47:35.361 --> 02:47:36.194
<v Speaker 1>Some people say a goat is delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it really depends upon the </v>

3607
02:47:39.651 --> 02:47:41.570
<v Speaker 1>diet of the goat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some goats,</v>

3608
02:47:41.630 --> 02:47:45.050
<v Speaker 1>they eat weird shit and they taste </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible and some,</v>

3609
02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:46.610
<v Speaker 1>some goats they eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3610
02:47:46.611 --> 02:47:48.380
<v Speaker 1>mmm delicious plants and you eat them.</v>

3611
02:47:48.380 --> 02:47:50.420
<v Speaker 1>And I bet it tastes as good as anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're ever going to eat.</v>

3612
02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:51.553
<v Speaker 1>It really did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It varies so much between the people </v>

3613
02:47:53.241 --> 02:47:55.730
<v Speaker 1>that say it tastes amazing versus the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that say it tastes terrible.</v>

3614
02:47:55.790 --> 02:47:56.623
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfect example of one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that looks like something from </v>

3615
02:47:58.371 --> 02:47:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Star Wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3616
02:47:59.590 --> 02:48:03.740
<v Speaker 1>you could say that it's crazy looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what would you do?</v>

3617
02:48:03.860 --> 02:48:04.693
<v Speaker 1>So if we did figure out a way to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of our meat come out of a </v>

3618
02:48:08.631 --> 02:48:10.520
<v Speaker 1>laboratory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so nothing has to die.</v>

3619
02:48:11.570 --> 02:48:14.220
<v Speaker 1>What do we do about all the animals?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zoo Zoo.</v>

3620
02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:17.750
<v Speaker 1>That's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's even crazier.</v>

3621
02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Like did not have a ranch instead of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>zoo animal island do.</v>

3622
02:48:23.211 --> 02:48:24.770
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the island we were talking about.</v>

3623
02:48:25.010 --> 02:48:25.843
<v Speaker 1>We ship all the animals to like some </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant like New Zealand and make a deal </v>

3624
02:48:29.381 --> 02:48:30.980
<v Speaker 1>with New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to bring home with lions,</v>

3625
02:48:30.981 --> 02:48:31.814
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with no predators to net deck </v>

3626
02:48:33.950 --> 02:48:35.060
<v Speaker 1>drastic park basically.</v>

3627
02:48:35.090 --> 02:48:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3628
02:48:36.500 --> 02:48:39.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to bring over predators to,</v>

3629
02:48:39.650 --> 02:48:40.483
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to create a wild ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a fully wild ecosystem and just </v>

3630
02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:45.913
<v Speaker 1>everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people by the year 2099 </v>

3631
02:48:48.350 --> 02:48:49.183
<v Speaker 1>that we have occupied every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretch of the world and everything </v>

3632
02:48:53.541 --> 02:48:56.090
<v Speaker 1>looks like New York City except one </v>
<v Speaker 1>continent,</v>

3633
02:48:56.091 --> 02:48:57.860
<v Speaker 1>which is like central park for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

3634
02:48:58.130 --> 02:49:03.130
<v Speaker 1>So the world is now one enormous city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've maintained like the Amazon,</v>

3635
02:49:03.470 --> 02:49:05.240
<v Speaker 1>the Amazon rain forest is what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>cherish.</v>

3636
02:49:05.241 --> 02:49:06.680
<v Speaker 1>That's our last connection to mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

3637
02:49:06.681 --> 02:49:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Before we slip in to some symbiotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with computers,</v>

3638
02:49:11.420 --> 02:49:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Don,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don,</v>

3639
02:49:12.120 --> 02:49:12.953
<v Speaker 1>Don,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're allowed to visit this island in </v>

3640
02:49:14.701 --> 02:49:16.200
<v Speaker 1>little hamster ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

3641
02:49:16.290 --> 02:49:17.490
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like Jurassic Park,</v>

3642
02:49:18.090 --> 02:49:20.040
<v Speaker 1>this could be real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be real.</v>

3643
02:49:20.041 --> 02:49:22.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean this literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds crazy,</v>

3644
02:49:22.470 --> 02:49:24.600
<v Speaker 1>but if you're talking about 500 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>from now,</v>

3645
02:49:24.660 --> 02:49:25.493
<v Speaker 1>we literally could have occupied every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single part of the earth except for one </v>

3646
02:49:29.581 --> 02:49:29.850
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

3647
02:49:29.850 --> 02:49:32.160
<v Speaker 1>We literally could make some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>

3648
02:49:32.610 --> 02:49:34.020
<v Speaker 1>They'll like when nobody goes to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon,</v>

3649
02:49:34.470 --> 02:49:35.880
<v Speaker 1>thinks you'd be a great science fiction </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

3650
02:49:35.910 --> 02:49:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Feel free to steal it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steal it,</v>

3651
02:49:37.650 --> 02:49:38.483
<v Speaker 1>dark mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we need to start building </v>

3652
02:49:39.421 --> 02:49:43.520
<v Speaker 1>underwater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>underwater cities that she imagined.</v>

3653
02:49:43.530 --> 02:49:46.170
<v Speaker 1>You're underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see a little crack in the wall and</v>

3654
02:49:46.260 --> 02:49:48.630
<v Speaker 1>you're coming home and you're on edibles</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're so tired,</v>

3655
02:49:48.631 --> 02:49:52.080
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be at work at three </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours and you look and you see a little,</v>

3656
02:49:52.230 --> 02:49:54.570
<v Speaker 1>just a small crack in the world and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

3657
02:49:54.571 --> 02:49:58.290
<v Speaker 1>do I talk about this crack I taught?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just a flaw in the glass.</v>

3658
02:49:58.310 --> 02:50:00.480
<v Speaker 1>It just looks like a crack and then as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3659
02:50:00.481 --> 02:50:02.400
<v Speaker 1>as you're going back home at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your shift,</v>

3660
02:50:02.430 --> 02:50:04.440
<v Speaker 1>it looks just a little bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

3661
02:50:04.441 --> 02:50:08.040
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather did this and the Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I trust underwater cracks.</v>

3662
02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Marlon going in a tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mars,</v>

3663
02:50:10.740 --> 02:50:11.573
<v Speaker 1>just the feeling of all the walls </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploding instantaneously and billions </v>

3664
02:50:18.180 --> 02:50:23.160
<v Speaker 1>of gallons of ocean water crushing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>very existence instantaneously.</v>

3665

3667
02:50:28.620 --> 02:50:32.160
<v Speaker 1>hundred feet deep around you crushing </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

3668
02:50:32.370 --> 02:50:36.420
<v Speaker 1>As soon as that crack gets big enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm freaking me out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

3674
02:50:47.141 --> 02:50:52.141
<v Speaker 1>It was a fun rog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great for Little Kids Finding Nemo.</v>

3675
02:50:52.470 --> 02:50:55.290
<v Speaker 1>You go out in the little submarine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a little show they do for you.</v>

3676
02:50:55.320 --> 02:50:57.630
<v Speaker 1>It's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's about as good as it gets.</v>

3677
02:50:58.800 --> 02:50:59.633
<v Speaker 1>How about that one lady who was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reporter who went in the guy submarine </v>

3678
02:51:02.700 --> 02:51:05.970
<v Speaker 1>and he killed her and chopped her up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitate at her like,</v>

3679
02:51:05.971 --> 02:51:06.804
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck he imagine if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lady and you go out there and you're </v>

3680
02:51:10.141 --> 02:51:10.974
<v Speaker 1>looking to do a story about a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>made his own submarine and then </v>

3681
02:51:13.681 --> 02:51:14.514
<v Speaker 1>somewhere along the line he kills you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and chops you up and throws in the </v>

3682
02:51:17.821 --> 02:51:18.090
<v Speaker 1>ocean.</v>

3683
02:51:18.090 --> 02:51:18.923
<v Speaker 1>You got to think like when you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to visit interview a guy who made a </v>

3684
02:51:20.921 --> 02:51:21.754
<v Speaker 1>submarine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way this guy's gonna chop me </v>

3685
02:51:22.471 --> 02:51:24.540
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to happen.</v>

3686
02:51:24.690 --> 02:51:27.750
<v Speaker 1>He knows that everybody knows I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to visit him.</v>

3687
02:51:28.200 --> 02:51:30.960
<v Speaker 1>I kinda believe his excuse a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I,</v>

3688
02:51:31.290 --> 02:51:34.470
<v Speaker 1>you know that where the hatch just </v>
<v Speaker 1>closed on her head.</v>

3689
02:51:34.560 --> 02:51:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're supposed to tell people that,</v>

3690
02:51:36.620 --> 02:51:37.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to chop her up and throw </v>

3691
02:51:38.040 --> 02:51:40.100
<v Speaker 1>in the ocean and pretend nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to them.</v>

3692
02:51:40.430 --> 02:51:41.263
<v Speaker 1>Did you just tell everybody who's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific accident and you feel terrible </v>

3693
02:51:44.191 --> 02:51:49.191
<v Speaker 1>and you get punished and fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor lady.</v>

3694
02:51:49.530 --> 02:51:50.363
<v Speaker 1>11 days to think about it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had 11 days sort of reading it right </v>

3695
02:51:54.151 --> 02:51:56.240
<v Speaker 1>now as you guys were saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3696
02:51:56.280 --> 02:51:59.040
<v Speaker 1>her for her torso is found 11 days </v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

3697
02:51:59.370 --> 02:52:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Well first he said she died of carbon </v>
<v Speaker 1>monoxide poisoning.</v>

3698
02:52:03.270 --> 02:52:05.950
<v Speaker 1>It previously had said the thing hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

3699
02:52:05.951 --> 02:52:08.200
<v Speaker 1>hit her head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was 150 pound hatch door.</v>

3700
02:52:08.290 --> 02:52:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

3701
02:52:09.910 --> 02:52:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Did you imagine that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

3702
02:52:12.670 --> 02:52:13.503
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hatch door hitting your head makes </v>

3703
02:52:15.341 --> 02:52:17.200
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But either way,</v>

3704
02:52:17.201 --> 02:52:20.170
<v Speaker 1>fuck submarines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do Fuck submarines.</v>

3705
02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:21.463
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any desire to go bungee </v>

3706
02:52:23.171 --> 02:52:24.220
<v Speaker 1>jumping?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

3707
02:52:24.250 --> 02:52:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm scared of heights.</v>

3708
02:52:25.930 --> 02:52:28.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't want any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck all that right.</v>

3709
02:52:28.390 --> 02:52:30.430
<v Speaker 1>The squirrel suit doesn't sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly.</v>

3710
02:52:30.480 --> 02:52:31.690
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds kind of fun.</v>

3711
02:52:31.720 --> 02:52:33.310
<v Speaker 1>You did the squirrel so I wouldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3712
02:52:33.311 --> 02:52:34.760
<v Speaker 1>It sounds fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flashy.</v>

3713
02:52:34.761 --> 02:52:35.594
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3714
02:52:35.650 --> 02:52:40.480
<v Speaker 1>let me know when you can do that so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can prepare for your absence forever.</v>

3715
02:52:41.250 --> 02:52:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Going to be anytime soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life insurance policy on the stump.</v>

3716
02:52:44.471 --> 02:52:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Fucking call you to clock in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

3717
02:52:46.450 --> 02:52:48.670
<v Speaker 1>I'll lit up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to get you to jump off the Alps.</v>

3718
02:52:48.700 --> 02:52:50.350
<v Speaker 1>But if he ever gets a suit with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>jets on it,</v>

3719
02:52:50.410 --> 02:52:51.190
<v Speaker 1>I might be.</v>

3720
02:52:51.190 --> 02:52:52.023
<v Speaker 1>What if that goes wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if that's like the tesla door </v>

3721
02:52:53.561 --> 02:52:56.140
<v Speaker 1>handles it one open up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So come on man,</v>

3722
02:52:56.470 --> 02:52:58.720
<v Speaker 1>don't do it man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to parasail anymore?</v>

3723
02:52:59.590 --> 02:53:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hang gliding is,</v>

3724
02:53:01.751 --> 02:53:02.584
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of people like getting shot </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in a hang glider 300 feet and just a </v>

3725
02:53:05.441 --> 02:53:06.274
<v Speaker 1>little like spout of air that they can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>control and you're fucked on that phone </v>

3726
02:53:09.730 --> 02:53:11.830
<v Speaker 1>call that we're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3727
02:53:12.280 --> 02:53:13.113
<v Speaker 1>This is all that for thrills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for wild thrills and God dammit we're </v>

3728
02:53:18.401 --> 02:53:19.234
<v Speaker 1>going to have flying cars though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's no the thing they're looking </v>

3729
02:53:21.191 --> 02:53:22.024
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that are </v>

3730
02:53:22.481 --> 02:53:24.610
<v Speaker 1>seriously considering flying cars right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

3731
02:53:24.790 --> 02:53:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a matter of time before </v>
<v Speaker 1>they locked that down.</v>

3732
02:53:26.860 --> 02:53:27.693
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be automated </v>
<v Speaker 1>pilots or mean driverless cars first in </v>

3733
02:53:31.601 --> 02:53:33.160
<v Speaker 1>that technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then flying,</v>

3734
02:53:33.161 --> 02:53:33.994
<v Speaker 1>I think you're totally right and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have the same sort of </v>

3735
02:53:35.621 --> 02:53:39.580
<v Speaker 1>like lane departure warnings and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that like keeps cars from crashing</v>

3736
02:53:39.581 --> 02:53:40.414
<v Speaker 1>into each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the correct and that people are just </v>

3737
02:53:41.861 --> 02:53:42.341
<v Speaker 1>going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3738
02:53:42.341 --> 02:53:43.174
<v Speaker 1>as long as they're autonomous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually makes it more efficient to </v>

3739
02:53:45.551 --> 02:53:48.550
<v Speaker 1>use the entire three d space and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the,</v>

3740
02:53:48.850 --> 02:53:51.760

<v Speaker 1>roads.</v>
