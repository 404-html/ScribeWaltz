00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how big this Paris like,</v>

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.370
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait to see this video.</v>

3
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:07.170
<v Speaker 1>You're going to shit your pants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it goes.</v>

4
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Go fullscreen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

5
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not going full screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here you go.</v>

6
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>You're going to shit your pants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Swedish man.</v>

7
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.963
<v Speaker 1>So this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sees it in the woods and he starts </v>

8
00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:19.170
<v Speaker 1>running up to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the volume buddy,</v>

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>it's all wintery wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No sound.</v>

10
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.620
<v Speaker 1>It was definitely sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to hear the sound because the guy</v>

11
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 1>screams at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

12
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 1>We got to figure out how it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

13
00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:32.250
<v Speaker 1>I never saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never even thought that would work.</v>

14
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.860
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's definitely got sound?</v>

15
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>So let's figure it out because you got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hear it because the guy goes,</v>

16
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put his arms out to the side.</v>

17
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's running at him,</v>

18
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.650
<v Speaker 1>like running at him and he was able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>scare it.</v>

19
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.890
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he reels back like he's scared.</v>

20
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Well he went for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:57.020
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look bad.</v>

22
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

23
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.363
<v Speaker 1>look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how big he is and look how much </v>

24
00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 1>bigger that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like four times,</v>

25
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>five times bigger than him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

26
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes me freak out.</v>

27
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.130
<v Speaker 1>If he had turned and Ronnie would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been eating.</v>

28
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

29
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.853
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing ran at him like it was dinner </v>

30
00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was that close to a bear.</v>

31
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>Where in Alaska and Denali.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

32
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.210
<v Speaker 1>A grizzly.</v>

33
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the big ass grizzly.</v>

34
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.163
<v Speaker 1>We woke up in the morning and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were in back country for a couple of </v>

35
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:31.720
<v Speaker 1>weeks just hiking and walking around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

36
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.353
<v Speaker 1>we got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we woke up and we were making her </v>

37
00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:39.840
<v Speaker 1>breakfast and we look up on a ridge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this big ass bear.</v>

38
00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:41.580
<v Speaker 1>This is September,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like late,</v>

39
00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:42.414
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they were getting ready to </v>

40
00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:48.171
<v Speaker 1>hibernate and he's walking down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridge and as we're packing up and uh,</v>

41
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up the Ridge is actually where we were </v>

42
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>cleaning our dishes and doing all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

43
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:54.264
<v Speaker 1>And now we're back at camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're breaking down to hike out and we </v>

44
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 1>see this thing go walking down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just dumb asses.</v>

45
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>We're so lucky we didn't get eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Guy,</v>

46
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.553
<v Speaker 1>we pack up and we just start walking in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same direction that the bear was </v>

48
00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:09.060
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

49
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to be going.</v>

50
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.160
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably,</v>

51
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:13.920
<v Speaker 1>he's beaten us there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're walking through these,</v>

52
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.970
<v Speaker 1>these reads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these bamboo kind of little reads,</v>

53
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:21.750
<v Speaker 1>but there were only like six feet high </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's like eight of us,</v>

54
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.793
<v Speaker 1>maybe six of us and we're walking with </v>
<v Speaker 1>our packs on and you just hear and you </v>

55
00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:35.241
<v Speaker 1>see the reeds separating slowly though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's not coming fast.</v>

56
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

57
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.170
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see that it's the bear and you know,</v>

58
00:02:43.171 --> 00:02:44.004
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to do with that guy did </v>
<v Speaker 1>put your arms up or at least freeze and </v>

59
00:02:46.741 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>don't see everyone in the group took </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

60
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.890
<v Speaker 1>That's the one thing I ran all my frozen</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the pose.</v>

61
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.183
<v Speaker 1>Me and my one friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're not supposed to do the we </v>

62
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.723
<v Speaker 1>run at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in and they take off with their </v>

63
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>backpacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the bear,</v>

64
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:06.844
<v Speaker 1>thankfully just by a stroke of luck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing was so fat and tired and the </v>

65
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 1>end of September he just wanted to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>down low,</v>

66
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 1>gets some more berries and take a </v>
<v Speaker 1>snooze.</v>

67
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Was not interested in us at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just so lucky.</v>

68
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:21.484
<v Speaker 1>So lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I swear to God it was for me to the </v>

69
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.430
<v Speaker 1>end of this table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Well when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're gathering berries,</v>

71
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.353
<v Speaker 1>that's when your safest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get in their head that that's what </v>

72
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>they want to eat and they eat a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bearings.</v>

73
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>He did not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was not interested to fuck all that.</v>

74
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:38.070
<v Speaker 1>So close animals.</v>

75
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean I love the the there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's cool,</v>

76
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>but God dammit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they scare the shit out of me.</v>

77
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.303
<v Speaker 1>It was a video of these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're hanging out by this river and </v>

78
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 1>they have like a little lawn chair and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this bear is enormous.</v>

79
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Crazy bear just walks up and sits down </v>
<v Speaker 1>next to them.</v>

80
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that one Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Close encounter with grit.</v>

81
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Grizzly bear casually walks up to people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just had to talk to them.</v>

82
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:04.781
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

83
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the bar just gets up and leaves.</v>

84
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.470
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like a school bus.</v>

85
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like a minivan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always describe it like a minivan.</v>

86
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Did you find one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just sat next to his chair.</v>

92
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.600
<v Speaker 1>He just pulls up to his chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A beautiful animal.</v>

93
00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:26.730
<v Speaker 1>They'll look at that thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Can't do shit because you don't want to </v>

96
00:04:34.231 --> 00:04:35.480
<v Speaker 1>provoke it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

97
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.500
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You definitely don't want to back up.</v>

98
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.390

100
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as you don't hit it doesn't </v>

101
00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:45.090
<v Speaker 1>think you're a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really dumb,</v>

102

<v Speaker 1>they're simple.</v>

109
00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 1>They're predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:01.110
<v Speaker 1>they get in their head like what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do.</v>

117
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:20.621
