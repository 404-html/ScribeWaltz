00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak pitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:03.241
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:07.890
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that I think that we've historically had this really weird</v>

4
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:09.030
<v Speaker 1>approach to medicine,</v>

5
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:14.031
<v Speaker 1>which I think is kind of a secondary effect of thinking scientifically.</v>

6
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.030
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

7
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.710
<v Speaker 1>obviously I,</v>

9
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>my background is in neuroscience.</v>

10
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:23.361
<v Speaker 1>I worked as a scientist for many years and I am very much a scientific thinker</v>

11
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>and I'm all about the scientific method.</v>

12
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>But I think that we sometimes are at fault when we're a little bit too</v>

13
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>reductionistic and our views.</v>

14
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 1>And so if you look at the history of modern medicine,</v>

15
00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>of signing a evidence based medicine,</v>

16
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>what ends up happening is that we look at a problem and we try to fix the</v>

17
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:43.971
<v Speaker 1>problem and we look at it as if you can somehow cut that piece of the person's</v>

18
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>physiology completely out of them,</v>

19
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>solve it,</v>

20
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.100
<v Speaker 1>and then put it right back in.</v>

21
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't have any effect on anything else in their bodies.</v>

22
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

23
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>you look at medication,</v>

24
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

25
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.063
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

27
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>any form of pharmaceutical,</v>

28
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>they all have side effects.</v>

29
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 1>If you think about what a side effect is,</v>

30
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

31
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>it comes down to how medication works.</v>

32
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Medicine is a molecule.</v>

33
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.070
<v Speaker 1>It's some sort of molecule that fits in a receptors somewhere in your body.</v>

34
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that you want it to have really high efficacy.</v>

35
00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:19.341
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that I'm somebody who has a problem with um,</v>

36
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.080
<v Speaker 1>blood pressure for example,</v>

37
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 1>or actually let's just jump into depression because I've been talking about this</v>

38
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:26.560
<v Speaker 1>a lot lately around um,</v>

39
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.421
<v Speaker 1>Robin Williams.</v>

40
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I had Paul Gil Martin on my podcast just last week to talk about that.</v>

41
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:35.070
<v Speaker 1>He hosts the mental illness happy hour podcast and has really great insights</v>

42
00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:35.904
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

43
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

44
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.051
<v Speaker 1>mental illness.</v>

45
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:41.160
<v Speaker 1>And I of course publicly have dealt with depression most of my life.</v>

46
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:42.480
<v Speaker 1>I take medication every day.</v>

47
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I go to therapy every week.</v>

48
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.723
<v Speaker 1>I'm very open about it.</v>

49
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.680
<v Speaker 1>For a lot of people,</v>

50
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.491
<v Speaker 1>they would look at you,</v>

51
00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>especially people that don't have any issues with depression,</v>

52
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>obviously very intelligent,</v>

53
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:52.290
<v Speaker 1>beautiful young.</v>

54
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Why would you be depressed,</v>

55
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.500
<v Speaker 1>tripping over themselves,</v>

56
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 1>trying to date you,</v>

57
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.031
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

58
00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:57.400
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

59
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.920
<v Speaker 1>you're obviously very successful in pursuing intellectual pursuits.</v>

60
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Why would you be depressed?</v>

61
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.193
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

62
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.071
<v Speaker 1>Why we're getting,</v>

63
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people don't understand the differences between depression and sadness</v>

64
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.580
<v Speaker 1>and they don't understand that depression is a biological illness.</v>

65
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.870
<v Speaker 1>They don't think of it and they also don't think of it in terms of like people</v>

66
00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:16.890
<v Speaker 1>look at it in terms of like,</v>

67
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:17.011
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

68
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:18.270
<v Speaker 1>you've got all these sums,</v>

69
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.470
<v Speaker 1>these numbers.</v>

70
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.711
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

71
00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>there's all stack on that.</v>

72
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Almost Ken can make it worse for certain people.</v>

73
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:24.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

74
00:02:24.031 --> 00:02:25.380
<v Speaker 1>you look at somebody like Robin Williams,</v>

75
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:26.790
<v Speaker 1>he had so much going for him,</v>

76
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:27.031
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

77
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:27.661
<v Speaker 1>He was famous,</v>

78
00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 1>he was loved.</v>

79
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.011
<v Speaker 1>He had all this money.</v>

80
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:29.940
<v Speaker 1>How could he be depressed?</v>

81
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:31.800
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have the problems that you are.</v>

82
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>I have and you know what?</v>

83
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Then you have this extra layer of guilt.</v>

84
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.670
<v Speaker 1>You have this extra layer of shame,</v>

85
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:41.910
<v Speaker 1>this extra layer of why the fuck am I still depressed?</v>

86
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.830
<v Speaker 1>No matter how much success I get,</v>

87
00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:44.940
<v Speaker 1>no matter how much money I make,</v>

88
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.520
<v Speaker 1>no matter how much people write me letters and say that they love me and</v>

89
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.373
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

90
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>I can't seem to to beat this feeling inside of me,</v>

91
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:58.290
<v Speaker 1>this constellation of symptoms because it's not coming from that.</v>

92
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>It's coming from your brain and is it,</v>

93
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

94
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't suffer from depression,</v>

95
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>but I have had many friends who do and um,</v>

96
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I have always wondered what it's because it seems to be that when you go to a</v>

97
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>doctor and they start treating it,</v>

98
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.480
<v Speaker 1>whether they treat it with medication or they try to adjust your diet and in</v>

99
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 1>prescribed exercise first,</v>

100
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.140
<v Speaker 1>that there's no like one simple fix and everybody's completely different and</v>

101
00:03:22.491 --> 00:03:22.990
<v Speaker 1>people get,</v>

102
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 1>people get upset about that because I think it goes back to to kind of what I</v>

103
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 1>was talking about before,</v>

104
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:30.650
<v Speaker 1>which is a meandering way to,</v>

105
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.121
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

106
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:33.100
<v Speaker 1>so again,</v>

107
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>to go back to this idea of a drug,</v>

108
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.681
<v Speaker 1>you take a drug,</v>

109
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:37.060
<v Speaker 1>let's say I take an antidepressant.</v>

110
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 1>My antidepressant specifically is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor,</v>

111
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:43.260
<v Speaker 1>an Ssri that's called [inaudible].</v>

112
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the off brand.</v>

113
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Alexa,</v>

114
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

115
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.043
<v Speaker 1>is the brand name.</v>

116
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I take that it binds to my serotonin receptors in my brain and it allows me to</v>

117
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:59.341
<v Speaker 1>dump more serotonin into the synapse that the gap between two brain cells so</v>

118
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 1>that I always have more available.</v>

119
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.940
<v Speaker 1>It basically tells my brain that I need more serotonin.</v>

120
00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 1>So I make more serotonin available to myself.</v>

121
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.341
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

122
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:07.570
<v Speaker 1>it's a re uptake inhibitor.</v>

123
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.501
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

124
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

125
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.641
<v Speaker 1>or sorry,</v>

126
00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:11.270
<v Speaker 1>it keeps more serotonin in,</v>

127
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>in the gap instead of sucking it back into the cell.</v>

128
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 1>So I always have more available to me now it's a molecule,</v>

129
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 1>it's got a shape just like anything out there.</v>

130
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:22.000
<v Speaker 1>It has geometry,</v>

131
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 1>so it binds to this specific receptor in the brain because it got a similar</v>

132
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:26.614
<v Speaker 1>shape to that.</v>

133
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.680
<v Speaker 1>There are other things in your body that are similarly shaped.</v>

134
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>And so what ends up happening is when you take a drug,</v>

135
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.080
<v Speaker 1>the specificity of the drug is only based on whether or not the key fits in a</v>

136
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 1>locked somewhere in your body.</v>

137
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 1>But let's say that you had hundreds of thousands,</v>

138
00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>millions of locks available to you and one key and you started going through,</v>

139
00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 1>you'd be able to stick that in a bunch of locks.</v>

140
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:48.251
<v Speaker 1>Some of them,</v>

141
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:49.450
<v Speaker 1>it might even turn,</v>

142
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:50.050
<v Speaker 1>but it would,</v>

143
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 1>it would fit in the lock of multiple locks hanging on that wall.</v>

144
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>So what ends up happening is I take this drug,</v>

145
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.510
<v Speaker 1>it binds in my brain.</v>

146
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.460
<v Speaker 1>It does what it's supposed to do in my brain,</v>

147
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 1>but it also may be does other shit like makes me really fucking tired or it</v>

148
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:07.060
<v Speaker 1>makes it so I don't want to have sex as often.</v>

149
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a side effect.</v>

150
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.860
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that you have a side effect is because there's other parts of</v>

151
00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:14.380
<v Speaker 1>your body that the drug binds to.</v>

152
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing with medicine.</v>

153
00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Like you were saying,</v>

154
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.780
<v Speaker 1>you operate on somebody whose heart,</v>

155
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.690
<v Speaker 1>the heart is connected to other things.</v>

156
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.320
<v Speaker 1>It's it,</v>

157
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.590
<v Speaker 1>it's the source of blood flow throughout your body.</v>

158
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.960
<v Speaker 1>It is connected to hormone levels.</v>

159
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:32.440
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of things that can happen when you put somebody on her under</v>

160
00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:33.101
<v Speaker 1>anesthesia,</v>

161
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 1>when you cut them open,</v>

162
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:35.950
<v Speaker 1>when you uh,</v>

163
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:36.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

164
00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:36.641
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

165
00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:40.180
<v Speaker 1>you cause an immune response and inflammatory response there,</v>

166
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 1>your body is a holistic thing.</v>

167
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.360
<v Speaker 1>And so when you start jacking with certain things,</v>

168
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 1>other things are going to happen.</v>

169
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.490
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean you should throw the baby out with the bath water.</v>

170
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.700
<v Speaker 1>But medicine is a risk benefit analysis always.</v>

171
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:55.990
<v Speaker 1>How do they find the,</v>

172
00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that they find the right medication by experimentation that they</v>

173
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 1>try it.</v>

174
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.770
<v Speaker 1>And is that just because it's,</v>

175
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.810
<v Speaker 1>cause we don't have any tests.</v>

176
00:06:03.811 --> 00:06:04.644
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

177
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 1>you can't go up as a doctor.</v>

178
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:07.851
<v Speaker 1>You can't come to me,</v>

179
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 1>stick a needle in my spinal cord,</v>

180
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.910
<v Speaker 1>take out my cerebral spinal fluid and measure how much their tone in I have in</v>

181
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

182
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:15.223
<v Speaker 1>I wish you could.</v>

183
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could take some sort of a blood test or I could,</v>

184
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.003
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 1>p and a cop and then you could analyze that p and say you're low on Saratonin.</v>

186
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:24.800
<v Speaker 1>You need an Ssri.</v>

187
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 1>That would be what works for you.</v>

188
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Because other people's depression comes from problems with dopamine,</v>

189
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.410
<v Speaker 1>comes from problems with norepinephrine or some combination thereof.</v>

190
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 1>But there's no test for it.</v>

191
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 1>It fucking sucks.</v>

192
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 1>There's no test for it.</v>

193
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:40.100
<v Speaker 1>And so what ends up happening is you have to play a musical chairs.</v>

194
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 1>You try a drug,</v>

195
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.660
<v Speaker 1>maybe it does.</v>

196
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 1>The first drug I tried for aunt,</v>

197
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

198
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.230
<v Speaker 1>when I decided to finally go on antidepressants,</v>

199
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.870
<v Speaker 1>fucked me up so bad.</v>

200
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.741
<v Speaker 1>I took an s,</v>

201
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:49.011
<v Speaker 1>n,</v>

202
00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:49.731
<v Speaker 1>d r I,</v>

203
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:51.860
<v Speaker 1>a selective serotonin norepinephrine,</v>

204
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 1>dopamine reuptake inhibitor.</v>

205
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.770
<v Speaker 1>I was so fucking depressed,</v>

206
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:57.650
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't function and we decided let's throw the book at it.</v>

207
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.170
<v Speaker 1>Let's take the drug of all drugs,</v>

208
00:07:00.171 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>the monster drug that does everything and I couldn't sleep for a week.</v>

209
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I was on straight up crank,</v>

210
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.750
<v Speaker 1>like on crystal lot done.</v>

211
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.080
<v Speaker 1>I quit smoking.</v>

212
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.071
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

213
00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:10.521
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

214
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:11.271
<v Speaker 1>I quit smoking.</v>

215
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:11.901
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

216
00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 1>That's when I quit smoking.</v>

217
00:07:12.921 --> 00:07:13.820
<v Speaker 1>That's an important point.</v>

218
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Terrible for your body.</v>

219
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Horrible.</v>

220
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Did you do anything to try to naturally stimulate your body to produce more</v>

221
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:24.440
<v Speaker 1>serotonin?</v>

222
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Did you try a lot of exercise?</v>

223
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Did you adjust your diet but you didn't quit smoking?</v>

224
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:30.951
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

225
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:35.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean ultimately got on the drugs only on the drug for a week.</v>

226
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.370
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as I got off the drug again,</v>

227
00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 1>I immediately wanted to smoke again.</v>

228
00:07:39.171 --> 00:07:41.180
<v Speaker 1>But at that point I'd pushed through it and I said,</v>

229
00:07:41.181 --> 00:07:41.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

230
00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:42.314
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

231
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:43.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm at my lowest.</v>

232
00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:44.870
<v Speaker 1>I was at my lowest point I've ever been at.</v>

233
00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:45.171
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

234
00:07:45.171 --> 00:07:46.250
<v Speaker 1>fuck it can't get any worse.</v>

235
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:46.701
<v Speaker 1>And I did.</v>

236
00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:47.390
<v Speaker 1>I quit smoking.</v>

237
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.830
<v Speaker 1>The thing about depression that is fascinating to me is that there are some</v>

238
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:56.831
<v Speaker 1>correlations between how do are you happy with what you choose to do with your</v>

239
00:07:58.911 --> 00:07:59.744
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

240
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.850
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who was,</v>

241
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.800
<v Speaker 1>he was on like some serious</v>

242
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.680
<v Speaker 1>and they changed his life.</v>

243
00:08:06.681 --> 00:08:07.311
<v Speaker 1>They got him,</v>

244
00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:07.640
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

245
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.590
<v Speaker 1>he quit his business,</v>

246
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:09.570
<v Speaker 1>he quit his job,</v>

247
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.760
<v Speaker 1>brother started his own business,</v>

248
00:08:10.761 --> 00:08:11.930
<v Speaker 1>got involved in relationship,</v>

249
00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:14.060
<v Speaker 1>and then once he got to a really good place,</v>

250
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:17.180
<v Speaker 1>he slowly weaned himself off the antidepressants and now he's great.</v>

251
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

252
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.080
<v Speaker 1>and that happens to a lot of people and so I think that there's different,</v>

253
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.320
<v Speaker 1>what we have to understand too is of course all psychiatric disorders or</v>

254
00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:25.400
<v Speaker 1>spectrum disorders,</v>

255
00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:25.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

256
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.520
<v Speaker 1>There's really extreme examples and there's barely any examples.</v>

257
00:08:28.521 --> 00:08:31.640
<v Speaker 1>And if anybody who's ever taken a psych course or who studied,</v>

258
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:32.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

259
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.740
<v Speaker 1>if you were a psych major in college,</v>

260
00:08:33.741 --> 00:08:35.570
<v Speaker 1>you know that as you've studied the DSM four,</v>

261
00:08:35.571 --> 00:08:36.050
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

262
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:40.010
<v Speaker 1>it's called the diagnostic and statistical manual that they use in psychiatry</v>

263
00:08:40.011 --> 00:08:40.844
<v Speaker 1>and psychology.</v>

264
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.700
<v Speaker 1>It's basically the big Bible of all the things you can be diagnosed with.</v>

265
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:44.691
<v Speaker 1>The more you study it,</v>

266
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:45.171
<v Speaker 1>the more you're like,</v>

267
00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:45.800
<v Speaker 1>I have that.</v>

268
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:45.921
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

269
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:46.401
<v Speaker 1>I have that.</v>

270
00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:46.491
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

271
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:47.780
<v Speaker 1>I totally fucking have that.</v>

272
00:08:47.781 --> 00:08:50.360
<v Speaker 1>And you realize everybody has,</v>

273
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.120
<v Speaker 1>everybody can convince themselves that they have these,</v>

274
00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:54.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like web MD,</v>

275
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:55.321
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

276
00:08:55.321 --> 00:08:58.410
<v Speaker 1>So it's only once it is sufficient,</v>

277
00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.333
<v Speaker 1>Lee,</v>

278
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.420
<v Speaker 1>detrimental to your life that it affects your relationships,</v>

279
00:09:02.421 --> 00:09:03.690
<v Speaker 1>it affects your ability to work,</v>

280
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:04.560
<v Speaker 1>it affects your health,</v>

281
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:05.550
<v Speaker 1>whatever the case may be.</v>

282
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.320
<v Speaker 1>And usually within the DSM,</v>

283
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:10.050
<v Speaker 1>there maybe like eight things and it's like you have to have five out of these</v>

284
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:10.884
<v Speaker 1>eight things.</v>

285
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.660
<v Speaker 1>And so anybody can read it and go,</v>

286
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:12.961
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

287
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:14.970
<v Speaker 1>I felt depression before.</v>

288
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:18.600
<v Speaker 1>But what they don't realize is there is a difference between depression and</v>

289
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:19.733
<v Speaker 1>sadness.</v>

290
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.590
<v Speaker 1>There's also a difference between parody depression.</v>

291
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:26.130
<v Speaker 1>So depression that lasts years,</v>

292
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:26.993
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>

293
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:31.380
<v Speaker 1>and the type of depression that people get that's directly linked to life</v>

294
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:32.160
<v Speaker 1>events.</v>

295
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's your dog dies,</v>

296
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:34.531
<v Speaker 1>you look well,</v>

297
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:35.040
<v Speaker 1>a big one,</v>

298
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.120
<v Speaker 1>you lose your freaking job.</v>

299
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Like we've seen so many documentaries lately about this.</v>

300
00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:39.630
<v Speaker 1>As the economy took a downturn,</v>

301
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:42.750
<v Speaker 1>people lose their job and then they end up committing suicide because they</v>

302
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:42.991
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>

303
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:45.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like this cascade of awfulness.</v>

304
00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:47.250
<v Speaker 1>That's a really common one.</v>

305
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:47.701
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

306
00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:48.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

307
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.290
<v Speaker 1>family member dies,</v>

308
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:53.520
<v Speaker 1>you have a stillborn or you have an abortion or you how you have a baby,</v>

309
00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:54.301
<v Speaker 1>a healthy baby.</v>

310
00:09:54.301 --> 00:09:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Postpartum depression is incredibly common and in that case that's much more</v>

311
00:09:58.741 --> 00:10:00.480
<v Speaker 1>common that people can take meds,</v>

312
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.690
<v Speaker 1>they can do all these things and once they get back to where they were before</v>

313
00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:05.040
<v Speaker 1>that horrible life event,</v>

314
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.010
<v Speaker 1>they're okay to get off off the meds.</v>

315
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Some people are able to get their depression managed without medication</v>

316
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:15.450
<v Speaker 1>perfectly well.</v>

317
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Some people aren't.</v>

318
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Is the different reactions of different people have two different medication?</v>

319
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Is it because their depression has a different source or is it just a</v>

320
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.750
<v Speaker 1>biodiversity?</v>

321
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.480
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more of a biodiversity thing than a source thing.</v>

322
00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean as sources,</v>

323
00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:31.951
<v Speaker 1>hard to say.</v>

324
00:10:31.951 --> 00:10:34.870
<v Speaker 1>So depression is both when you think about it.</v>

325
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

326
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.420
<v Speaker 1>brain and mind are the same thing.</v>

327
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Most modern neuroscientists say that brain and mind are two sides of the same</v>

328
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:40.441
<v Speaker 1>coin.</v>

329
00:10:40.441 --> 00:10:42.720
<v Speaker 1>That mind is just an emergent property of brain.</v>

330
00:10:42.721 --> 00:10:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's a dualist anymore.</v>

331
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.400
<v Speaker 1>They don't think that you can like heal the mind.</v>

332
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:50.040
<v Speaker 1>And it has no effect on the brain because it's the same fucking thing.</v>

333
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:50.641
<v Speaker 1>So there are,</v>

334
00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:50.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

335
00:10:50.851 --> 00:10:54.920
<v Speaker 1>some people's depression comes from the fact that their dopamine levels are,</v>

336
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.550
<v Speaker 1>are not healthy or they're norepinephrine levels are not healthy or whatever the</v>

337
00:10:59.551 --> 00:11:00.180
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

338
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.740
<v Speaker 1>But I think the common view of depression now is that there's some sort of</v>

339
00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:09.741
<v Speaker 1>biological difference in your brain and oftentimes that's either caused or it</v>

340
00:11:10.111 --> 00:11:15.111
<v Speaker 1>develops out of childhood or early life experiences where you know,</v>

341
00:11:18.091 --> 00:11:21.510
<v Speaker 1>you have some sort of trauma or you have some sort of um,</v>

342
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:22.711
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

343
00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:23.341
<v Speaker 1>You have some sort of,</v>

344
00:11:23.341 --> 00:11:23.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

345
00:11:23.671 --> 00:11:24.870
<v Speaker 1>interaction with family,</v>

346
00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:25.830
<v Speaker 1>whatever the case may be.</v>

347
00:11:25.831 --> 00:11:26.760
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't have to be,</v>

348
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:27.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

349
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.440
<v Speaker 1>you were molested as a child.</v>

350
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.590
<v Speaker 1>It can literally just be like you didn't feel,</v>

351
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:32.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

352
00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.710
<v Speaker 1>loved or whatever the case may be.</v>

353
00:11:34.711 --> 00:11:39.711
<v Speaker 1>And you've got this brain difference combined with this emotional experience and</v>

354
00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:43.771
<v Speaker 1>what ends up happening.</v>

355
00:11:43.771 --> 00:11:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're very young,</v>

356
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:45.990
<v Speaker 1>you're brain is very plastic.</v>

357
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:46.980
<v Speaker 1>So when you're very young,</v>

358
00:11:46.981 --> 00:11:49.950
<v Speaker 1>you're learning skills that are going to last you the rest of your life and</v>

359
00:11:49.951 --> 00:11:52.050
<v Speaker 1>you're actually building your brain architecture,</v>

360
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:56.170
<v Speaker 1>certain neurons connecting and disconnecting and reconnecting and pruning out</v>

361
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:56.680
<v Speaker 1>the tree.</v>

362
00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.340
<v Speaker 1>The beautiful tree that is all of the cells in your brain is getting pruned when</v>

363
00:12:00.341 --> 00:12:03.970
<v Speaker 1>you're young and if you're depressed when you're young and you're experiencing</v>

364
00:12:03.971 --> 00:12:05.170
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of things when you're young,</v>

365
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.070
<v Speaker 1>you're going to prune a tree that's prone to depression as you age because</v>

366
00:12:09.071 --> 00:12:12.700
<v Speaker 1>you're going to keep reinforcing those neuronal connections.</v>

367
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 1>That's why therapy is so important.</v>

368
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Meds in and of themselves are never going to get you in a place where your</v>

369
00:12:19.931 --> 00:12:21.580
<v Speaker 1>depression has really well managed.</v>

370
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.990
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get you in a place where therapy is going to be working better for</v>

371
00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:26.770
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

372
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Meds are going to be an immediate and necessary interventional strategy so that</v>

373
00:12:31.481 --> 00:12:35.140
<v Speaker 1>you're not crying or you're not trying to kill yourself or you're not.</v>

374
00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Whatever your symptoms of so you can actually fucking get out of bed to work on</v>

375
00:12:39.401 --> 00:12:40.234
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

376
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.100
<v Speaker 1>That's what meds are there for me.</v>

377
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:42.190
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>

378
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Meds keep me from staying in bed all day.</v>

379
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.120
<v Speaker 1>That's a variable though.</v>

380
00:12:46.121 --> 00:12:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Finding the right counselor has got to be incredibly difficult.</v>

381
00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:49.420
<v Speaker 1>It's tough.</v>

382
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like I always liken it to the women who are listening to the podcast.</v>

383
00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:55.720
<v Speaker 1>I liken it unto when you were first deciding to go on birth control,</v>

384
00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.920
<v Speaker 1>a lot of women will go um,</v>

385
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.420
<v Speaker 1>to their gynecologist when they're 15,</v>

386
00:13:01.421 --> 00:13:01.781
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>

387
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:02.471
<v Speaker 1>17 and say,</v>

388
00:13:02.471 --> 00:13:04.240
<v Speaker 1>I want to go on birth control and they'll give them Ortho,</v>

389
00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:05.230
<v Speaker 1>try cycling or whatever,</v>

390
00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:05.800
<v Speaker 1>the pill,</v>

391
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.790
<v Speaker 1>the regular old pill,</v>

392
00:13:06.791 --> 00:13:07.624
<v Speaker 1>and they'll be fine.</v>

393
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.780
<v Speaker 1>A lot of women will take the pill the first time and it'll make them really</v>

394
00:13:10.781 --> 00:13:11.410
<v Speaker 1>sick.</v>

395
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Like every time they take the pill,</v>

396
00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:16.150
<v Speaker 1>it makes them want to throw up or it gives them cramps or something's weird</v>

397
00:13:16.151 --> 00:13:16.581
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

398
00:13:16.581 --> 00:13:17.620
<v Speaker 1>It affects us and they go,</v>

399
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:17.801
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

400
00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:19.060
<v Speaker 1>of this drug doesn't work for me and go,</v>

401
00:13:19.061 --> 00:13:19.451
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck,</v>

402
00:13:19.451 --> 00:13:19.691
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

403
00:13:19.691 --> 00:13:22.750
<v Speaker 1>let's try one with lower levels of estrogen or progesterone or let's try the</v>

404
00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:24.340
<v Speaker 1>ring or the Depo Provera shot,</v>

405
00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:26.110
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you need an Iud.</v>

406
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:27.731
<v Speaker 1>I was like that.</v>

407
00:13:27.731 --> 00:13:29.620
<v Speaker 1>It took me multiple times to find the right drug.</v>

408
00:13:29.621 --> 00:13:31.180
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's the same thing with therapy.</v>

409
00:13:31.181 --> 00:13:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the same thing with psychiatric medicines.</v>

410
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:33.791
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

411
00:13:33.791 --> 00:13:35.050
<v Speaker 1>we're not monolithic,</v>

412
00:13:35.051 --> 00:13:37.540
<v Speaker 1>so the same combination isn't gonna work for everybody.</v>

413
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.380
<v Speaker 1>And the truth is if that makes you afraid of modern medicine or if it makes you</v>

414
00:13:41.381 --> 00:13:44.020
<v Speaker 1>think that psychiatry is Wu or something like that,</v>

415
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:49.350
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing as cancer in many ways,</v>

416
00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:50.590
<v Speaker 1>there's so many parallels.</v>

417
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Cancer's not one disease.</v>

418
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a spectrum of diseases.</v>

419
00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:58.150
<v Speaker 1>If I got diagnosed with breast cancer and you got diagnosed with breast cancer</v>

420
00:13:58.151 --> 00:14:01.150
<v Speaker 1>and we both went in with our diagnosis the same day,</v>

421
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.180
<v Speaker 1>our oncologist would give us different treatments because we would have</v>

422
00:14:04.181 --> 00:14:05.440
<v Speaker 1>different genetic markers.</v>

423
00:14:05.441 --> 00:14:08.260
<v Speaker 1>We would respond differently to different types of chemotherapy.</v>

424
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Chemotherapy,</v>

425
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.960
<v Speaker 1>it means chemical therapy.</v>

426
00:14:10.961 --> 00:14:15.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a really big umbrella term for all the different kinds of cancer treatments</v>

427
00:14:15.011 --> 00:14:15.880
<v Speaker 1>that are available.</v>

428
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you would get more radiation,</v>

429
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:19.780
<v Speaker 1>maybe I would need surgery,</v>

430
00:14:19.781 --> 00:14:23.560
<v Speaker 1>but your metastasis would make it so that surgery wasn't a viable option.</v>

431
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:24.110
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

432
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:25.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a spectrum.</v>

433
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Disease and psychiatric illness or the same way.</v>

434
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:30.820
<v Speaker 1>The variable though of the counselor has to be kind of weird.</v>

435
00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:31.741
<v Speaker 1>It is weird.</v>

436
00:14:31.741 --> 00:14:35.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird find someone that you can confide in whole heartedly and it takes</v>

437
00:14:35.921 --> 00:14:38.620
<v Speaker 1>time a really long time finding the correct sex.</v>

438
00:14:38.621 --> 00:14:38.891
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

439
00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not as some men do better with women counselors.</v>

440
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.200
<v Speaker 1>I have a male counselor,</v>

441
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.153
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

442
00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:46.120
<v Speaker 1>like I would never,</v>

443
00:14:46.121 --> 00:14:46.511
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>

444
00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:50.650
<v Speaker 1>I have a male therapist but I have a female gynecologists like I would never in</v>

445
00:14:50.651 --> 00:14:55.070
<v Speaker 1>a million let a dude like puts speculums and me and like dig around in my</v>

446
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:55.910
<v Speaker 1>cervix.</v>

447
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.000
<v Speaker 1>But I'm totally comfortable with a male therapist.</v>

448
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.370
<v Speaker 1>When did the depression started?</v>

449
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:01.783
<v Speaker 1>When I was child.</v>

450
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:03.920
<v Speaker 1>So you were dealing with it your whole life?</v>

451
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:04.580
<v Speaker 1>My whole life.</v>

452
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.413
<v Speaker 1>Oh completely.</v>

453
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Some of those years,</v>

454
00:15:06.741 --> 00:15:08.720
<v Speaker 1>like when I was dating bill or when I would be moving,</v>

455
00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:11.690
<v Speaker 1>those were some of the worst years because it was so stressful cause he didn't</v>

456
00:15:11.691 --> 00:15:14.200
<v Speaker 1>have friends and because I was unmedical I was unmedicated then.</v>

457
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:14.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

458
00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:17.480
<v Speaker 1>I didn't start taking medication until about three years ago.</v>

459
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Really got 27.</v>

460
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Did you try other methods you try?</v>

461
00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:22.870
<v Speaker 1>I didn't try.</v>

462
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:24.610
<v Speaker 1>I tried some things and I,</v>

463
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:26.270
<v Speaker 1>I've been in therapy my whole life.</v>

464
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.990
<v Speaker 1>My parents first put me in therapy when they first started to decide that they</v>

465
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.420
<v Speaker 1>were thinking about getting a divorce and I was a young man.</v>

466
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:33.590
<v Speaker 1>I was maybe six or seven.</v>

467
00:15:33.591 --> 00:15:35.210
<v Speaker 1>So from the time I remember,</v>

468
00:15:35.211 --> 00:15:39.500
<v Speaker 1>I've understood the therapeutic process and they always really promoted that in</v>

469
00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:39.621
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

470
00:15:39.621 --> 00:15:42.680
<v Speaker 1>So then even after the divorce and remarriage is and all of that,</v>

471
00:15:42.681 --> 00:15:43.900
<v Speaker 1>I started doing the,</v>

472
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.010
<v Speaker 1>the therapy thing on my own.</v>

473
00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Then when I went to college and I was very much on my own,</v>

474
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:49.670
<v Speaker 1>I went to college when I was 16 by the way,</v>

475
00:15:49.671 --> 00:15:51.830
<v Speaker 1>and lived on my own at 60 I was fucking weird.</v>

476
00:15:51.831 --> 00:15:52.490
<v Speaker 1>K Yeah,</v>

477
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.241
<v Speaker 1>so I was a little,</v>

478
00:15:53.241 --> 00:15:53.901
<v Speaker 1>I'm an adult,</v>

479
00:15:53.901 --> 00:15:54.734
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't.</v>

480
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.221
<v Speaker 1>I did that.</v>

481
00:15:55.221 --> 00:15:55.821
<v Speaker 1>I went to therapy.</v>

482
00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:56.930
<v Speaker 1>I did all those things by myself,</v>

483
00:15:56.931 --> 00:15:58.640
<v Speaker 1>but I always had this mental block.</v>

484
00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.050
<v Speaker 1>I always had this like,</v>

485
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:00.561
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

486
00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:01.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't need meds.</v>

487
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Meds means you're really crazy.</v>

488
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Meds means you really don't have control.</v>

489
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:11.240
<v Speaker 1>And not until I kind of hit a very bad rock bottom a few,</v>

490
00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:13.730
<v Speaker 1>maybe three years ago did I finally say,</v>

491
00:16:13.731 --> 00:16:14.121
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

492
00:16:14.121 --> 00:16:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

493
00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:15.403
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

494
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.510
<v Speaker 1>I think I actually have to do this.</v>

495
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be good for me.</v>

496
00:16:18.861 --> 00:16:22.430
<v Speaker 1>And then it was the same experience that I've heard over and over and over from</v>

497
00:16:22.431 --> 00:16:25.850
<v Speaker 1>people where finally they get on the meds that are right for them and they</v>

498
00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:29.480
<v Speaker 1>calibrate to their dosage and maybe they've been on it for about two months and</v>

499
00:16:29.481 --> 00:16:30.740
<v Speaker 1>they just have this epiphany of like,</v>

500
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.200
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck did I wait so long?</v>

501
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I could have felt like this my whole life.</v>

502
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.940
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck was I thinking?</v>

503
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Because you're so societaly.</v>

504
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:45.860
<v Speaker 1>We're so resistant to looking at mental illness the same way we look at physical</v>

505
00:16:45.861 --> 00:16:46.694
<v Speaker 1>illness.</v>

506
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:47.511
<v Speaker 1>We're so,</v>

507
00:16:47.511 --> 00:16:48.590
<v Speaker 1>it's so easy.</v>

508
00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Paul Gil Martin just made this point when he was on my podcast last week.</v>

509
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.680
<v Speaker 1>If you went up to somebody with diabetes type one diabetes and you were like,</v>

510
00:16:57.681 --> 00:16:58.550
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck dude?</v>

511
00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just think more positively so that your pancreas makes insulin?</v>

512
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Like what's wrong with you?</v>

513
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you just make more insulin?</v>

514
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:08.271
<v Speaker 1>It's like they'd be like,</v>

515
00:17:08.271 --> 00:17:09.440
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

516
00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.420
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing with depression.</v>

517
00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.190
<v Speaker 1>People put the onus on you.</v>

518
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.113
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

519
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.370
<v Speaker 1>they look at it like it's a disease of will,</v>

520
00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:17.510
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

521
00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:17.901
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

522
00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:22.901
<v Speaker 1>it's a biological illness and that's just very hard for people to understand.</v>

523
00:17:23.661 --> 00:17:26.810
<v Speaker 1>And so what you end up doing is carrying around a lot of guilt and shame and a</v>

524
00:17:26.811 --> 00:17:27.441
<v Speaker 1>lot of feelings.</v>

525
00:17:27.441 --> 00:17:27.591
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

526
00:17:27.591 --> 00:17:28.341
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good enough.</v>

527
00:17:28.341 --> 00:17:31.490
<v Speaker 1>I can't will myself out of this if I just think more positively.</v>

528
00:17:31.491 --> 00:17:32.600
<v Speaker 1>It's not about that.</v>

529
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.130
<v Speaker 1>And I did that for years.</v>

530
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.293
<v Speaker 1>Years.</v>

531
00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.260
<v Speaker 1>You just deal with it.</v>

532
00:17:36.261 --> 00:17:37.220
<v Speaker 1>And I destroyed,</v>

533
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.580
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

534
00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:38.990
<v Speaker 1>so many relationships.</v>

535
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:42.050
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine.</v>

536
00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine being trapped in that scenario,</v>

537
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.450
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also very sensitive to the</v>

538
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.830
<v Speaker 2>variables that different people go through with their bodies.</v>

539
00:17:52.831 --> 00:17:54.090
<v Speaker 2>I have hypothyroidism,</v>

540
00:17:54.091 --> 00:17:55.770
<v Speaker 2>I have to take thyroid medication.</v>

541
00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:56.581
<v Speaker 2>It runs in my family.</v>

542
00:17:56.581 --> 00:17:57.420
<v Speaker 2>My mother has it grown.</v>

543
00:17:57.421 --> 00:17:58.200
<v Speaker 2>Has it too.</v>

544
00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:58.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

545
00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.310
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

546
00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.690
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

547
00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.170
<v Speaker 2>I know I should get headaches,</v>

548
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:03.720
<v Speaker 2>these weird headaches at the end of the day where I was like,</v>

549
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:04.200
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

550
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:04.891
<v Speaker 2>so fuck.</v>

551
00:18:04.891 --> 00:18:06.990
<v Speaker 2>Like I could fall asleep and it wasn't like,</v>

552
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.520
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like I was like,</v>

553
00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:09.354
<v Speaker 2>now I,</v>

554
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:10.291
<v Speaker 2>I get tired,</v>

555
00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:10.921
<v Speaker 2>I go to sleep.</v>

556
00:18:10.921 --> 00:18:15.360
<v Speaker 2>But it was like I could fall asleep just watching TV and be out for like eight</v>

557
00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:15.691
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

558
00:18:15.691 --> 00:18:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Like it didn't make any sense.</v>

559
00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:17.850
<v Speaker 2>It was like a weird tired,</v>

560
00:18:17.851 --> 00:18:19.200
<v Speaker 2>like I was in pain.</v>

561
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.981
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

562
00:18:19.981 --> 00:18:20.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

563
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:21.510
<v Speaker 2>and I get these weird headaches.</v>

564
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.940
<v Speaker 2>And then once I finally got on medication,</v>

565
00:18:23.941 --> 00:18:24.271
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

566
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:25.104
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

567
00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

568
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:26.171
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

569
00:18:26.171 --> 00:18:26.470
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

570
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.681
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

571
00:18:26.681 --> 00:18:27.514
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

572
00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.040
<v Speaker 1>this is what other people feel like,</v>

573
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

574
00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.310
<v Speaker 1>Like I thought I was normal because that's another thing.</v>

575
00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:35.680
<v Speaker 1>There's such a stigma in this country,</v>

576
00:18:35.681 --> 00:18:36.970
<v Speaker 1>not just about mental illness,</v>

577
00:18:36.971 --> 00:18:41.470
<v Speaker 1>but about any sort of illness where people can't openly freely talk about it.</v>

578
00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.440
<v Speaker 1>So you end up living in this weird bubble where you don't really,</v>

579
00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.190
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

580
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:48.850
<v Speaker 1>I know people that have mental illness that didn't even realize they had mental</v>

581
00:18:48.851 --> 00:18:52.600
<v Speaker 1>illness until they finally had a conversation with a doctor about it and they</v>

582
00:18:52.601 --> 00:18:52.900
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>

583
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:53.111
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

584
00:18:53.111 --> 00:18:54.160
<v Speaker 1>this isn't normal.</v>

585
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Like not everybody doesn't hear voices or everybody does it.</v>

586
00:18:57.461 --> 00:18:57.791
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

587
00:18:57.791 --> 00:18:58.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

588
00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.390
<v Speaker 1>because you're so afraid to talk to somebody about it.</v>

589
00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.920
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

590
00:19:02.921 --> 00:19:07.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a really important part of this.</v>

591
00:19:07.181 --> 00:19:09.730
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just getting past the stigma.</v>

592
00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.740
<v Speaker 1>That's why when something like this with Robin Williams,</v>

593
00:19:11.741 --> 00:19:14.140
<v Speaker 1>which is so fucking depressing happens,</v>

594
00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.200
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people rally around it and they say,</v>

595
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:17.471
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

596
00:19:17.471 --> 00:19:20.590
<v Speaker 1>maybe we can use this as a teaching moment because this guy,</v>

597
00:19:20.591 --> 00:19:23.440
<v Speaker 1>no matter how good his life was,</v>

598
00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:28.890
<v Speaker 1>he had this thing that he ultimately couldn't kick and it wasn't his fault.</v>

599
00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.770
<v Speaker 1>It just is that way sometimes and hey,</v>

600
00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.150
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have it too.</v>

601
00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:38.770
<v Speaker 1>I think in some ways it's good when high functioning people come out and talk</v>

602
00:19:38.771 --> 00:19:42.730
<v Speaker 1>about their illnesses because then people who are actually experiencing things</v>

603
00:19:42.731 --> 00:19:44.410
<v Speaker 1>like loss of employment,</v>

604
00:19:44.411 --> 00:19:45.191
<v Speaker 1>loss of a loved one,</v>

605
00:19:45.191 --> 00:19:45.940
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

606
00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.480
<v Speaker 1>or who have had a bad go of it for other reasons or like even you,</v>

607
00:19:49.481 --> 00:19:50.500
<v Speaker 1>like you had said before,</v>

608
00:19:50.501 --> 00:19:51.490
<v Speaker 1>like even you,</v>

609
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.020
<v Speaker 1>but you're pretty or,</v>

610
00:19:53.021 --> 00:19:54.790
<v Speaker 1>but you're successful and you're whatever.</v>

611
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.511
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

612
00:19:55.511 --> 00:19:56.500
<v Speaker 1>if you could have that,</v>

613
00:19:56.501 --> 00:19:57.850
<v Speaker 1>then of course,</v>

614
00:19:57.851 --> 00:19:59.440
<v Speaker 1>it's not weird that I have,</v>

615
00:19:59.470 --> 00:19:59.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

616
00:19:59.891 --> 00:20:04.360
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a good thing for people to be able to see that they're not alone</v>

617
00:20:04.361 --> 00:20:05.194
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

618
00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:14.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
