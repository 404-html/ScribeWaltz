49
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:05.681
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was killed myself.</v>

51
00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:10.980
<v Speaker 2>My back is all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was telling a calendar,</v>

52
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.770
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was a cashew shaped and jumping</v>

53
00:02:14.771 --> 00:02:15.940
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

54
00:02:15.941 --> 00:02:18.040
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I cracked my,</v>

55
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.140
<v Speaker 2>my whole back when you were in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>airline seat constantly and you're just</v>

56
00:02:23.141 --> 00:02:26.320
<v Speaker 2>constantly all stressed out and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep is all fucked up.</v>

57
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.500
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got cast in another show.</v>

58
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.990
<v Speaker 2>I got the fuck out of there and I gave</v>
<v Speaker 2>already all my things.</v>

59
00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:33.070
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But already has,</v>

60
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.350
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no fish,</v>

61
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.550
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he is financial freedom because</v>

62
00:02:39.551 --> 00:02:40.690
<v Speaker 2>he's got a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

63
00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:43.150
<v Speaker 2>the show on comedy central,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a great podcast,</v>

64
00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:48.151
<v Speaker 2>he's got all kinds of shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he also has this attitude that</v>

65
00:02:48.851 --> 00:02:53.290
<v Speaker 2>allows him to do something like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't have those three things</v>

66
00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:54.460
<v Speaker 2>I needed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Financial Freedom.</v>

67
00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:56.650
<v Speaker 2>I got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I have these three dependents.</v>

68
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 2>I have two dogs and have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the attitude,</v>

69
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 2>like if I'm not working nonstop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel crazy.</v>

70
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 2>You should tell people what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about because a lot of people</v>

71
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 2>that are tuning into this podcast</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably don't realize that our Ari,</v>

72
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 2>our good friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>checked out of civilization for three</v>

73
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:15.520

<v Speaker 2>he's rocking a flip phone.</v>

76
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 2>He won't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have any APPS,</v>

77

<v Speaker 2>he has no smartphone,</v>

79
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 2>but then he just decides to go away and</v>
<v Speaker 2>check out.</v>

80
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.260
<v Speaker 2>He'd no one's communicated with them.</v>

<v Speaker 2>need to tell him about shit.</v>

153
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.190
<v Speaker 2>If you guys don't know what we're</v>

154
00:06:58.191 --> 00:07:00.950
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They made this video room that was just</v>

155
00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:03.950
<v Speaker 2>a room in the back behind the kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

156
00:07:03.951 --> 00:07:08.030
<v Speaker 2>the comics love hanging out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's create a special little backbar</v>

157
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.770
<v Speaker 2>just for the comedians and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>

158
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get to have conversations in there.</v>

159
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.520
<v Speaker 2>And you had some weird thing somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>told me the other night when I was in</v>

<v Speaker 2>To do that,</v>

165
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.690
<v Speaker 2>but if it's a private bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

166
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.200
<v Speaker 2>like you're not even supposed to be back</v>
<v Speaker 2>there unless you're a comic or a friend</v>

167
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 2>of a calmer.</v>

<v Speaker 2>sometimes just gets overwhelming.</v>

172
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:49.970
<v Speaker 2>And then also I want to have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation with you or any of my</v>

173
00:07:49.971 --> 00:07:53.930
<v Speaker 2>friends are real one normal conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can talk at length with</v>

174
00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:57.260
<v Speaker 2>somebody and you can't do that and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems like you're getting interrupted</v>

271
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:51.000
<v Speaker 3>of people who are living in their homes</v>
<v Speaker 3>with their parents until they're 30 and</v>

<v Speaker 2>Drew talk about this on a howard stern</v>
<v Speaker 2>ramp up show and he was saying like,</v>

281
00:12:10.361 --> 00:12:12.690
<v Speaker 2>kids don't have grit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grit,</v>

282
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:14.583
<v Speaker 2>grit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

283
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.360
<v Speaker 2>associate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr drew with grit.</v>

284
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:16.961
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're Just,</v>

285
00:12:16.961 --> 00:12:20.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows about a hustle,</v>

286
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.840
<v Speaker 2>hustle and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my kids are coddled,</v>

287
00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:27.340
<v Speaker 2>but he thinks the only thing is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>educational system pushing education,</v>

288
00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:30.490
<v Speaker 2>make somebody work their ass off if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have that inner drive.</v>

289
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.820
<v Speaker 2>And the reason like getting with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was world,</v>

290
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 2>so if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see a therapist,</v>

291
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:39.610
<v Speaker 2>I probably should because they got a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on,</v>

292
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:44.940
<v Speaker 2>but fucking my mom was cleaning houses</v>
<v Speaker 2>and making $6 an hour.</v>

293
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.270
<v Speaker 2>My dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>teamster,</v>

294
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:54.420
<v Speaker 2>warehouse foreman and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were poor growing up,</v>

295
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.910
<v Speaker 2>lower middle class and then went to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

296
00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.940
<v Speaker 2>He sent me to school in san francisco</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all these rich kids as well as in</v>

297
00:13:00.941 --> 00:13:05.941
<v Speaker 2>all these rich houses and houses in</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who know san francisco is pacific</v>

298
00:13:06.041 --> 00:13:09.700
<v Speaker 2>heights is really nice and sold it now</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like fucking $12,000,000 houses.</v>

299
00:13:09.701 --> 00:13:12.520
<v Speaker 2>And that's where we were hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Parents would have abandoned them on the</v>

300
00:13:12.521 --> 00:13:16.120
<v Speaker 2>weekends and we'd have run of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking houses.</v>

301
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my buddy broke a $25,000 vase and</v>

302
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.730
<v Speaker 2>sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get the fuck outta here.</v>

303
00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.990
<v Speaker 2>We'll pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were in all these.</v>

304
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.180
<v Speaker 2>I was like smoking some guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cubans on sitting in his chair.</v>

305
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.920

<v Speaker 2>who shouldn't be all of these places.</v>

306
00:13:32.921 --> 00:13:37.921
<v Speaker 2>But I think that's what lit a fire under</v>
<v Speaker 2>my aunts because I'm working for the.</v>

<v Speaker 2>they found each other for a reason</v>

329
00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.880
<v Speaker 2>because they both have that attitude and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was there and then I was supposed</v>

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.160
<v Speaker 2>like the opener with a great place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I lived.</v>

334
00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:08.610
<v Speaker 2>I had a wet bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember?</v>

<v Speaker 2>hair,</v>

338

<v Speaker 2>huge hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no work done at all.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows what you're doing.</v>

452
00:20:05.191 --> 00:20:06.750
<v Speaker 3>Fucking angel dust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>

453
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:08.980
<v Speaker 3>Talking about a niche audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

454
00:20:08.981 --> 00:20:10.210
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

456
00:20:12.751 --> 00:20:16.020

<v Speaker 3>one of those things when you're 10,</v>

457
00:20:16.021 --> 00:20:18.780

<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

460
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.630
<v Speaker 3>arguably dana gould should have been a</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge superstar as a stand up comedian</v>

461
00:20:27.631 --> 00:20:30.330
<v Speaker 3>using a san francisco guy who was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fun time in that house.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Not good at all.</v>

495
00:22:06.071 --> 00:22:09.370
<v Speaker 2>If somebody starts becoming super</v>
<v Speaker 2>popular and then the other person is</v>

496
00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:09.910
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.430
<v Speaker 2>what do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I present that kirsch do like jump</v>

00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:17.200
<v Speaker 2>out now or find other work and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>also been a difficult thing with me.</v>

499
00:22:17.201 --> 00:22:19.120
<v Speaker 2>So back to what we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

500
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:23.500
<v Speaker 2>so now I leave this parent's family</v>
<v Speaker 2>business and I come to la,</v>

<v Speaker 2>have a business or you work somewhere,</v>

641
00:28:54.001 --> 00:28:57.960
<v Speaker 2>cross section of people who love stand</v>
<v Speaker 2>up or you know,</v>

645
00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.900
<v Speaker 2>And then it's a weird cross section,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a daily show people and then sitcom</v>

646
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.530
<v Speaker 2>people and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

647
00:29:07.531 --> 00:29:09.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like this weird crowd coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

648
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.020
<v Speaker 2>and then it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's people like comedy.</v>

649
00:29:13.021 --> 00:29:17.960
<v Speaker 2>It said stan hope bit people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people came here to see me and,</v>

650
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.530
<v Speaker 2>and when many people came here to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>

651
00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

652
00:29:24.571 --> 00:29:27.840
<v Speaker 2>music isn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for me to do a corporate gig and</v>

653
00:29:27.841 --> 00:29:30.340
<v Speaker 2>pay get paid double gazillion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

654
00:29:30.341 --> 00:29:34.500
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of money is fucking tempting</v>
<v Speaker 2>to switch over to that side.</v>

655
00:29:34.501 --> 00:29:36.900
<v Speaker 2>So I could see why people do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what jay leno did.</v>

656
00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:40.860
<v Speaker 2>You just get paid 250 grand and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>why he doesn't put out any content.</v>

657
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:41.661
<v Speaker 2>Jay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

658
00:29:41.661 --> 00:29:43.420
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't have the same act he has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

659
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:46.990
<v Speaker 2>he has no body of Work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he had a showtime special that he</v>

660
00:29:46.991 --> 00:29:51.991
<v Speaker 2>did that I saw in the nineties and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty sure other than his tonight show</v>

661
00:29:52.061 --> 00:29:53.740
<v Speaker 2>monologues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course has numerous.</v>

662
00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.450
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the last stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he ever put out as far as like a,</v>

663
00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.790
<v Speaker 2>like a full act?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talk to him about it.</v>

664
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's kind of weird philosophy about it.</v>

665
00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:08.100
<v Speaker 2>I did random,</v>
<v Speaker 2>randomly got a phone call to present him</v>

666
00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:13.420

<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to say yes because it's</v>

806
00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:14.100
<v Speaker 2>Don't think this is like the cleanest</v>
<v Speaker 2>time for comedy as far as like,</v>

807
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:17.190
<v Speaker 2>you're still hear little stories pop up</v>
<v Speaker 2>here and there,</v>

808
00:37:17.191 --> 00:37:21.470
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's also now it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>subjective and there's lunch.</v>

809
00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:22.620
<v Speaker 2>So much standup.</v>

810
00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.080
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking like I have this hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>special coming out,</v>

811
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:30.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this weekend on showtime and I think</v>

812
00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:34.200
<v Speaker 2>talking to somebody about it and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a special coming out like every fucking</v>

813
00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:35.110
<v Speaker 2>two days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

814
00:37:35.111 --> 00:37:39.900
<v Speaker 2>they're not that special anymore or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a great time for content.</v>

815
00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Like if you want to see comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you go on netflix or showtime or</v>

816
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:48.160
<v Speaker 2>cso or any of these different providers</v>
<v Speaker 2>to cecil.</v>

817
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:52.530
<v Speaker 2>If I could stand then stand up special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I watched the and mentioned it as</v>

818
00:37:52.531 --> 00:37:55.330
<v Speaker 2>they go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The doug stan hope special on.</v>

819
00:37:55.490 --> 00:38:00.240
<v Speaker 2>So if you have not seen this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like is one of the best things</v>

820
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:05.550
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I walked in to the comedy club and</v>

821
00:38:05.551 --> 00:38:10.551
<v Speaker 2>he saw punchline for the very first time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I saw arch barker onstage kill just,</v>

822
00:38:12.001 --> 00:38:13.950
<v Speaker 2>he's a great comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just fucking murdered.</v>

823
00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:18.970
<v Speaker 2>And I had the same feeling that when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>watched that doug stanhope special,</v>

824
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:20.760
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And it's like next level shit that I</v>

827
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:32.300
<v Speaker 2>hope people can really appreciate the</v>
<v Speaker 2>call backs and the intricacies of this</v>

828
00:38:32.641 --> 00:38:36.280
<v Speaker 2>Whole thing and the story in somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's on something and saying</v>

829
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.800
<v Speaker 3>something like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But doug did two of them in his</v>

830
00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:41.530
<v Speaker 3>hometown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did them bolt in bisbee,</v>

831
00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:42.311
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

832
00:38:42.311 --> 00:38:46.520
<v Speaker 3>This is the one that was shot in bisbee</v>
<v Speaker 3>by a head again.</v>

833
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.570
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just.</v>

834
00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:51.420
<v Speaker 3>I love the fact that he's doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we talked about it a couple of</v>

835
00:38:51.421 --> 00:38:54.880
<v Speaker 3>years ago is I can park in my town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got to fucking see these people</v>

836
00:38:54.881 --> 00:38:57.730
<v Speaker 3>at the safe way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then apparently he just said,</v>

837
00:38:57.731 --> 00:38:59.050
<v Speaker 3>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why not?</v>

838
00:38:59.051 --> 00:39:02.860
<v Speaker 3>Why can't I do it in my town?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then eventually his town stopped</v>

839
00:39:02.861 --> 00:39:05.380
<v Speaker 3>being the talent was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as a bunch of people who moved there</v>

840
00:39:05.381 --> 00:39:07.600
<v Speaker 3>because they know doug lives there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh dude.</v>

841
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:09.370
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a real estate mogul.</v>

842
00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.880
<v Speaker 3>He bought everY house that comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all like $30,000.</v>

843
00:39:12.881 --> 00:39:15.010
<v Speaker 3>He just buys it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just buying houses.</v>

844
00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:17.860
<v Speaker 3>So he owns like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you want six or seven houses in</v>

845
00:39:17.861 --> 00:39:20.590
<v Speaker 3>town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is with jack reacher novel where</v>

846
00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:23.300
<v Speaker 3>he's going to own the town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good time.</v>

847
00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:25.210
<v Speaker 3>Fuck dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I got divorced,</v>

848
00:39:25.211 --> 00:39:27.630
<v Speaker 3>I thought I'd seriously consider moving</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

849
00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.740
<v Speaker 3>There's already a house I'm looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a cave.</v>

850
00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:33.240
<v Speaker 3>No way to indicate when it's Built into</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cake.</v>

851
00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.113
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

852
00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.750
<v Speaker 3>Now I can't buy it because people know</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll show up at my door.</v>

853
00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.020
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

854
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:43.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many people move to bit.</v>

855
00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.360
<v Speaker 3>He used to give out his address and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come into my superbowl party.</v>

856
00:39:46.361 --> 00:39:50.260
<v Speaker 3>So people would come from all over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world to his fucKing superbowl party.</v>

857
00:39:50.261 --> 00:39:53.200
<v Speaker 3>And it was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be 500 people that he didn't know</v>

858
00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.910
<v Speaker 3>at his house for a superbowl party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he stopped doing that.</v>

859
00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.970
<v Speaker 3>He rescinded the invitation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what me and bert were talking</v>

860
00:40:00.971 --> 00:40:05.971
<v Speaker 3>about is doing a thing called a caravan</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy tour and getting a bunch of rvs</v>

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:11.880
<v Speaker 3>and our trucks and trailers and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>going a bunch of guys because also</v>

862
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.800
<v Speaker 3>sudden it's like just a special kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>comic.</v>

863
00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:16.180
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're one of those comics.</v>

864
00:40:16.181 --> 00:40:19.750
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have give kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a family of life,</v>

865
00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.920
<v Speaker 3>you have stuff outside of standup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

866
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:25.780
<v Speaker 3>sake to get those guys together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And bert is one of those,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they all have that in common,</v>

870
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:38.020

<v Speaker 3>That's like I would have shit on youtube</v>

1161
00:53:59.281 --> 00:54:01.050
<v Speaker 3>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially in New York,</v>

1162
00:54:01.051 --> 00:54:01.950
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1163
00:54:01.951 --> 00:54:06.600
<v Speaker 3>you fucking whore in New York anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't do two or three minutes of</v>

1164
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:09.930
<v Speaker 3>what's going on in the room and what</v>
<v Speaker 3>just happened,</v>

1165
00:54:09.931 --> 00:54:12.480
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have his shitty set like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's I would.</v>

1166
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:14.190
<v Speaker 3>That's what I learned right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to Be like,</v>

1167
00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:16.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>start of hugging,</v>

1168
00:54:16.321 --> 00:54:21.270
<v Speaker 3>hold everyone's attention and just start</v>
<v Speaker 3>launching into material to comment on</v>

1169
00:54:21.271 --> 00:54:23.700
<v Speaker 3>what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what that is from.</v>

1170
00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:25.560
<v Speaker 3>I noticed that too when I lived in New</v>
<v Speaker 3>York,</v>

1171
00:54:25.561 --> 00:54:28.620
<v Speaker 3>I was like this because the crowds are</v>
<v Speaker 3>small and the stage is small.</v>

1172
00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:31.470
<v Speaker 3>It's way more intimate experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the belly room,</v>

1173
00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:34.050
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The belly room is a totally different</v>

1174
00:54:34.051 --> 00:54:36.510
<v Speaker 3>experience in the or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a totally different experience</v>

1175
00:54:36.511 --> 00:54:39.000
<v Speaker 3>in the main room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the beautiful things about</v>

1176
00:54:39.001 --> 00:54:41.760
<v Speaker 3>doing the hat trick of the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do all three rooms in a night,</v>

1177
00:54:41.761 --> 00:54:45.360
<v Speaker 3>you get to feel the different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the belly room is so much more</v>

1178
00:54:45.361 --> 00:54:48.480
<v Speaker 3>intimate and so much more intense</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's only 70 people in the</v>

1179
00:54:48.481 --> 00:54:51.700
<v Speaker 3>room and they're jammed in there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're right in front of you.</v>

1180
00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:54.530
<v Speaker 3>And that's like in New York room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm doing that.</v>

1181
00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.840
<v Speaker 3>That show on showtime about standup</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy.</v>

1182
00:54:57.841 --> 00:55:00.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm dying up here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get to meet that guy in the back.</v>

1183
00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:03.930
<v Speaker 3>That's helping me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's making that show.</v>

1184
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:08.070
<v Speaker 3>And we were talking about the belly room</v>
<v Speaker 3>and interviewing people about that just</v>

1185
00:55:08.071 --> 00:55:09.510
<v Speaker 3>to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that used to be,</v>

1186
00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:12.270
<v Speaker 3>it was called a billy room because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was for women.</v>

1187
00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:15.660
<v Speaker 3>And then like at pregnant women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1188
00:55:15.661 --> 00:55:19.290
<v Speaker 3>like a womb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mitsui literally thought of it as a</v>

1189
00:55:19.291 --> 00:55:20.300
<v Speaker 3>comedy womb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1190
00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:23.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they used to put overflow.</v>

1191
00:55:23.341 --> 00:55:26.220
<v Speaker 3>So if richard pryor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody huge was in the main room,</v>

1192
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:30.200
<v Speaker 3>they put all the overflow up in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>belly room and then a comic would be on</v>

1193
00:55:30.201 --> 00:55:33.450
<v Speaker 3>stage and they'd come in if like a table</v>
<v Speaker 3>opened up,</v>

1194
00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:38.480
<v Speaker 3>they'd go mid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mid act thompson party for like you,</v>

1195
00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:40.460
<v Speaker 3>you're doing stand up onstage.</v>

1196
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:44.160
<v Speaker 3>And the waItress would come in and go at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thompson's here and then the</v>

1197
00:55:44.161 --> 00:55:46.980
<v Speaker 3>thompson's ever sitting in the front and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just get up and walk out and go to</v>

1198
00:55:46.981 --> 00:55:50.430
<v Speaker 3>see richard pryor</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that place,</v>

1199
00:55:50.431 --> 00:55:52.620
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I worked on that with erik</v>

1200
00:55:52.621 --> 00:55:57.621
<v Speaker 3>griffin so I didn't really know him that</v>
<v Speaker 3>well before and hilarious just fucking</v>

1201
00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:02.750
<v Speaker 3>fucks with people nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so of course he was the guy that said</v>

1202
00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:04.590
<v Speaker 3>that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's a great dude.</v>

1203
00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:06.660
<v Speaker 3>He's a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not doing it because he's an</v>

1204
00:56:06.661 --> 00:56:07.830
<v Speaker 3>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just being silly.</v>

1205
00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:08.990
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was trying to tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>brendan.</v>

1206
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.710
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't hit me hard bro.</v>

1207
00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.750
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what we do.</v>

1208
00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:15.270
<v Speaker 3>You like brendan's new to this whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

1209
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:17.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he started out doing podcasts.</v>

1210
00:56:17.341 --> 00:56:20.220
<v Speaker 3>He's a funnY guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he started doing these live</v>

1211
00:56:20.221 --> 00:56:25.060
<v Speaker 3>podcasts with cal and then they would do</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of like a little sketch,</v>

1212
00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:26.950
<v Speaker 3>like a comedy routine.</v>

1213
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:31.290
<v Speaker 3>and then he would do a few minutes on</v>
<v Speaker 3>his own just doing like kind of standup,</v>

1214
00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:32.890
<v Speaker 3>like telling his story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's funny.</v>

1215
00:56:32.891 --> 00:56:37.180
<v Speaker 3>He says he has some funny ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now he's doing sets like on a regular</v>

1216
00:56:37.181 --> 00:56:41.380
<v Speaker 3>basis and then he's doing sets in front</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people don't know which is the right</v>

1217
00:56:41.381 --> 00:56:42.340
<v Speaker 3>way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

1218
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:45.850
<v Speaker 3>The bad things that people do is they</v>
<v Speaker 3>only do their own crowd over and over</v>

1219
00:56:45.851 --> 00:56:47.770
<v Speaker 3>and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not smart.</v>

1220
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:50.400
<v Speaker 3>You got to go out and do those shows</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was trying to.</v>

1221
00:56:50.401 --> 00:56:52.540
<v Speaker 3>Like when you start doing standup</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy,</v>

1222
00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:56.740
<v Speaker 3>you invite all your friends out and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes you three sets to figure out,</v>

1223
00:56:56.741 --> 00:56:59.250
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I better stop inviting my friends that</v>

1224
00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:02.710
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well and not only that,</v>

1225
00:57:02.711 --> 00:57:04.870
<v Speaker 3>but if you invite your friends out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're a significant part of the</v>

1226
00:57:04.871 --> 00:57:06.220
<v Speaker 3>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've already seen your jokes.</v>

1227
00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:07.001
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1228
00:57:07.001 --> 00:57:09.370
<v Speaker 3>It's just goes bad right away and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and if I can do that and it just makes</v>

<v Speaker 2>comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lose every single person in the</v>

1443
01:07:04.961 --> 01:07:06.220
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's A standard thing.</v>

1444
01:07:06.221 --> 01:07:07.001
<v Speaker 2>They do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

1445
01:07:07.001 --> 01:07:10.660
<v Speaker 2>So I just went with it and what they do</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the night to wrap up,</v>

1446
01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:14.140
<v Speaker 2>there's just a big push in the night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get some extra dollars in</v>

1447
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:16.270
<v Speaker 2>our coffers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believe it was happening.</v>

1448
01:07:16.271 --> 01:07:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I was shocked at the time and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>owner comes up like I was serious.</v>

1449
01:07:19.811 --> 01:07:21.280
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy shit.</v>

1450
01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:23.950
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we sold out of jello shots.</v>

1451
01:07:23.951 --> 01:07:25.930
<v Speaker 2>You were amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was unbelievable.</v>

1452
01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:29.740
<v Speaker 2>And then I walk into the next night</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's got more jello shots?</v>

1453
01:07:29.741 --> 01:07:33.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean the kitchen is filled with them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those jello shots come out.</v>

1454
01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:35.880
<v Speaker 2>And I don't say a thing.</v>

1455
01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:41.640
<v Speaker 2>Siri.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought we were a business together.</v>

1456
01:07:42.310 --> 01:07:45.670
<v Speaker 2>We had a good thing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know this because he</v>

1457
01:07:45.671 --> 01:07:47.440
<v Speaker 2>didn't mention he didn't mention the</v>
<v Speaker 2>jello shots.</v>

1458
01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:49.330
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1459
01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:50.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

1460
01:07:50.621 --> 01:07:54.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you could tell by really</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate the fucking jello shots like I go.</v>

1461
01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:57.280
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was horrible.</v>

1462
01:07:57.281 --> 01:07:58.780
<v Speaker 2>You should not be selling them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1463
01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.400
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did he say?</v>

1464
01:08:01.450 --> 01:08:06.100
<v Speaker 2>It was just to teach you a lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a fucking sell any jello shots now.</v>

1465
01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:07.210
<v Speaker 2>You weren't pushing them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1466
01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:08.080
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1467
01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:12.070
<v Speaker 2>so he just had a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he should probably explained that</v>

1468
01:08:12.071 --> 01:08:13.110
<v Speaker 2>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1469
01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:14.950
<v Speaker 2>on the first night and then he would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have got it,</v>

1470
01:08:14.951 --> 01:08:16.250
<v Speaker 2>but he probably still would have sold</v>
<v Speaker 2>them anyway.</v>

1471
01:08:16.810 --> 01:08:19.750
<v Speaker 2>He made money and he was a nice guy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was nice,</v>

1472
01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.080
<v Speaker 2>like it was just like it.</v>

1473
01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:23.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I can't.</v>

1474
01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:27.260
<v Speaker 2>It's hard for me to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1475
01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:30.890
<v Speaker 2>if you have people coming out that know</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and you're going out to see</v>

1476
01:08:30.891 --> 01:08:35.891
<v Speaker 2>something in you like collectively or</v>
<v Speaker 2>group of people that love an individual</v>

1477
01:08:36.471 --> 01:08:38.420
<v Speaker 2>comic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great place to be.</v>

1478
01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:41.780
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're up there winning over 60</v>

1479
01:08:41.781 --> 01:08:44.980
<v Speaker 2>percent of the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not good,</v>

1480
01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.220
<v Speaker 2>but rather just go hang out at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>store.</v>

1481
01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:49.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good to do the road though because</v>

1482
01:08:49.821 --> 01:08:52.790
<v Speaker 2>like you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like every time you do a set in</v>

1483
01:08:52.791 --> 01:08:55.130
<v Speaker 2>a new place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got a new experience,</v>

1484
01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:56.660
<v Speaker 2>a new vibe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new feel,</v>

1485
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:58.480
<v Speaker 2>new crowds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New I like.</v>

1486
01:08:58.510 --> 01:09:01.370
<v Speaker 2>I think places also have like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different personality.</v>

1487
01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:05.840
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel like portland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oregon has a different personality than</v>

1488
01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:08.090
<v Speaker 2>a lot of places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you go up to portland and feels</v>

1489
01:09:08.091 --> 01:09:10.310
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the audience feels different and then</v>

1490
01:09:10.311 --> 01:09:13.340
<v Speaker 2>you go to austin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas different feeling like a little</v>

1491
01:09:13.341 --> 01:09:13.730
<v Speaker 2>lighter.</v>

1492
01:09:13.730 --> 01:09:16.010
<v Speaker 2>They're little lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little more fun.</v>

1493
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:18.710
<v Speaker 2>It's more silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like doing shows in Canada,</v>

1494
01:09:19.310 --> 01:09:21.920
<v Speaker 2>in toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the best sets I've ever had my</v>

1495
01:09:21.921 --> 01:09:23.210
<v Speaker 2>entire fucking life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Toronto,</v>

1496
01:09:23.211 --> 01:09:27.440
<v Speaker 2>vancouver is fun for me to go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canadians are just great audiences.</v>

1497
01:09:27.441 --> 01:09:29.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is to just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's loose.</v>

1498
01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:32.830
<v Speaker 2>They're not uptight about 20 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>less douchebags.</v>

1499
01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1500
01:09:33.830 --> 01:09:36.760

<v Speaker 2>They have 20 percent less douche bags</v>

1501
01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:39.740

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.530
<v Speaker 2>I took.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freddy soto gave me an ambien who was an</v>

1714
01:20:00.531 --> 01:20:02.620
<v Speaker 2>ambien,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately to the men,</v>

1715
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:04.900
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had to be sleep apnea.</v>

1716
01:20:05.630 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 2>That yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fat and sIck,</v>

1717
01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:09.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs</v>

1718
01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:11.740
<v Speaker 3>and sleep apnea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Parents,</v>

1719
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:14.130
<v Speaker 3>a lethal combination because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel yourself choking.</v>

1720
01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:17.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gave me an ambien.</v>

1721
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:19.230
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we moved.</v>

1722
01:20:19.530 --> 01:20:24.450
<v Speaker 3>I took it as like I needed to take a nap</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was all wound up.</v>

1723
01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:28.020
<v Speaker 3>I slept for five hours straight in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>middle of the day and I was like,</v>

1724
01:20:28.021 --> 01:20:30.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm never fucking taken that again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1725
01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:34.260
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took this adderall and just felt all</v>

1726
01:20:34.261 --> 01:20:37.850
<v Speaker 3>fucked up and just never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1727
01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:40.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't think my body don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

1728
01:20:40.951 --> 01:20:42.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do anything.</v>

1729
01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:46.680
<v Speaker 3>I was getting really tired during the</v>
<v Speaker 3>day and I remember you told me to take</v>

1730
01:20:46.681 --> 01:20:51.630
<v Speaker 3>some vitamin d and so we started taking</v>
<v Speaker 3>a multivitamin and that really helps me</v>

1731
01:20:51.690 --> 01:20:53.910
<v Speaker 3>and I take a lot of b 12.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That helps.</v>

1732
01:20:54.170 --> 01:20:57.840
<v Speaker 3>And it would also help you in a big way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut out all the bread and sugar and</v>

1733
01:20:57.870 --> 01:21:01.500
<v Speaker 3>carbs and all that stuff because then</v>
<v Speaker 3>the insulin spikes,</v>

1734
01:21:01.501 --> 01:21:04.600
<v Speaker 3>you're not getting these big spikes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a big reason why people crash</v>

1735
01:21:04.601 --> 01:21:05.434
<v Speaker 3>the other day.</v>

1736
01:21:05.450 --> 01:21:07.200
<v Speaker 3>It's bread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bread,</v>

1737
01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:08.850
<v Speaker 3>pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>

1738
01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:12.720
<v Speaker 3>Like your body goes too far and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>body has to process that and you get</v>

1739
01:21:12.721 --> 01:21:15.330
<v Speaker 3>this big slump is soon as you cut all</v>
<v Speaker 3>that out.</v>

1740
01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:18.900
<v Speaker 3>You experience a much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even much more even flow of energy</v>

1741
01:21:18.901 --> 01:21:19.790
<v Speaker 3>through the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1742
01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:24.360
<v Speaker 3>So if I could just learn to um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do like that.</v>

1743
01:21:24.361 --> 01:21:26.400
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm again,</v>

1744
01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:31.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm such a glutton man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A bread when the kids were,</v>

1745
01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:36.540
<v Speaker 3>my wife has making,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gives you a fresh loaves of this artist</v>

1746
01:21:36.541 --> 01:21:39.690
<v Speaker 3>and bread that she has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then steve may bring peanut butter and</v>

1747
01:21:39.691 --> 01:21:42.450
<v Speaker 3>jelly and it seems like I just like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>scavenger.</v>

1748
01:21:42.451 --> 01:21:44.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm a family goat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'll just cross</v>

1749
01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:50.160
<v Speaker 3>out all the kids leave behind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's stuff dealing with</v>

1750
01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:53.900
<v Speaker 3>ordering food for myself at a restaurant</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I know that everyone's going to</v>

1751
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:58.620
<v Speaker 3>leave half their shit or all order</v>
<v Speaker 3>myself a full entree and then somebody</v>

1752
01:21:58.621 --> 01:22:01.950
<v Speaker 3>will have half a chicken parmigiana or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something over on it because my son and</v>

1753
01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:04.830
<v Speaker 3>daughter and system ordering off the</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid's menu.</v>

1754
01:22:05.130 --> 01:22:07.770
<v Speaker 3>And so now I got somebody eating a full</v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken parmesan,</v>

1755
01:22:07.771 --> 01:22:10.560
<v Speaker 3>but they'll only eat half of it and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to let that go to waste.</v>

1756
01:22:10.561 --> 01:22:13.620
<v Speaker 3>And so I'll start digging into that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's pasta.</v>

1757
01:22:13.621 --> 01:22:15.780
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me just try one of those raviolis</v>

1758
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:18.330
<v Speaker 3>and then all of a sudden I eat like</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking three dinners.</v>

1759
01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:22.800
<v Speaker 3>So I weigh more than i ever have weighed</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my entire life right now.</v>

1760
01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:24.450
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One 93,</v>

1761
01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:25.500
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10.</v>

1762
01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:26.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1763
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.960
<v Speaker 3>I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to the gym on a regular basis and I</v>

1764
01:22:30.961 --> 01:22:32.940
<v Speaker 3>left and said like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1765
01:22:32.941 --> 01:22:35.800
<v Speaker 3>I fucking 193 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1766
01:22:35.801 --> 01:22:38.340
<v Speaker 3>it's the pasta and bread man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you just cut all that stuff out,</v>

1767
01:22:38.341 --> 01:22:39.940
<v Speaker 3>you'll drop a shitload of weight right</v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

1768
01:22:39.941 --> 01:22:41.970
<v Speaker 3>I could be in the family goat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'll help.</v>

1769
01:22:42.330 --> 01:22:45.180
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the things when we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about that I think is kind of</v>

1770
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:46.760
<v Speaker 3>reporting like when you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1771
01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:49.980
<v Speaker 3>immigration and bad apples and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1772
01:22:50.190 --> 01:22:52.410
<v Speaker 3>I look at immigration that same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at gun control,</v>

1773
01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:56.010
<v Speaker 3>like most people that have guns are laW</v>
<v Speaker 3>abiding citizens.</v>

1774
01:22:56.011 --> 01:22:57.780
<v Speaker 3>And it's not going to be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The vast,</v>

1775
01:22:57.781 --> 01:23:00.810
<v Speaker 3>vast majority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's the same case with</v>

1776
01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:04.050
<v Speaker 3>immigration and the same case with</v>
<v Speaker 3>people coming to America,</v>

1777
01:23:04.051 --> 01:23:06.160
<v Speaker 3>even illegally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to do Better.</v>

1778
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.690
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're coming here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not coming here because they</v>

1779
01:23:07.691 --> 01:23:11.800
<v Speaker 2>want to start crying and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of them are coming here because</v>

1780
01:23:11.801 --> 01:23:14.770
<v Speaker 2>they want opportunities with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally agree.</v>

1781
01:23:14.771 --> 01:23:17.610
<v Speaker 2>I want a shotgun so badly when I needed</v>
<v Speaker 2>a double barrel.</v>

1782
01:23:17.611 --> 01:23:21.240
<v Speaker 2>Like I want a shotgun and uM,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've shot a lot of guns should,</v>

1783
01:23:21.250 --> 01:23:24.310
<v Speaker 2>especially with the daily show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done chuck jones for the daily</v>

<v Speaker 5>clear room and defend yourself.</v>

1787

<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>people can write like only bad things</v>

1877
01:27:34.851 --> 01:27:38.990
<v Speaker 2>have happened with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know a district is responsible gun</v>

1878
01:27:38.991 --> 01:27:40.800
<v Speaker 2>owners.</v>

1879
01:27:40.801 --> 01:27:44.360
<v Speaker 2>at columbine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at all these people getting</v>

1880
01:27:44.361 --> 01:27:48.470
<v Speaker 2>shot up everywhere and seeing the hook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't want that to happen.</v>

1881
01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:50.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't want my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was walking away.</v>

1882
01:27:50.601 --> 01:27:52.670
<v Speaker 2>I was safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put your guns in a safe.</v>

1883
01:27:52.850 --> 01:27:57.380
<v Speaker 2>Why do you need an ak 47?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you don't need an ak 47.</v>

1884
01:27:58.410 --> 01:28:00.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying to have all the handgun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is like,</v>

1885
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:02.810
<v Speaker 2>who should be able to decide who gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>what.</v>

1886
01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:05.090
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1887
01:28:05.150 --> 01:28:08.120
<v Speaker 2>And what about silencers to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1888
01:28:08.210 --> 01:28:10.070
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in europe,</v>

1889
01:28:10.190 --> 01:28:15.190
<v Speaker 2>silencers are thought of as a polite</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing because we're over in America</v>

1890
01:28:15.651 --> 01:28:16.850
<v Speaker 2>worried about shooting people.</v>

1891
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:19.040
<v Speaker 2>They're worrying about noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like if you have a,</v>

1892
01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.070
<v Speaker 2>what they call suppressor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that suppressor,</v>

1893
01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:23.540
<v Speaker 2>like if you're hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would hunt with a suppressor on</v>

1894
01:28:23.541 --> 01:28:25.010
<v Speaker 2>because you don't want to blow your</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking ears.</v>

1895
01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll put the links out to these two</v>

1896
01:28:27.111 --> 01:28:30.860
<v Speaker 2>pieces that I did a daily show spots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do the one.</v>

1897
01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:33.980
<v Speaker 2>If you go to my thing that twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1898
01:28:33.981 --> 01:28:34.814
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1899
01:28:35.210 --> 01:28:36.620
<v Speaker 2>I'll put it on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll send them to you.</v>

1900
01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:39.260
<v Speaker 2>That when I drove a tank and fired all</v>
<v Speaker 2>those guns.</v>

1901
01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:43.370
<v Speaker 2>And then I did a silencer piece as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy was saying he wanted to</v>

1902
01:28:43.371 --> 01:28:48.371
<v Speaker 2>protect kids ears with the silencers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what Donald Trump is saying.</v>

1903
01:28:49.281 --> 01:28:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm worried.</v>

1904
01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:53.360
<v Speaker 2>the reality is though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is true,</v>

1905
01:28:53.361 --> 01:28:57.950
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of friends that are hunters</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shot guns as kids and they're</v>

1906
01:28:57.951 --> 01:29:00.050
<v Speaker 2>fucked up now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're ears are a mess.</v>

1907
01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:02.370
<v Speaker 2>They the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should,</v>

1908
01:29:02.730 --> 01:29:05.130
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't when they were younger</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they didn't know any better.</v>

1909
01:29:05.190 --> 01:29:08.900
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 years ago people didn't know that you</v>

1910
01:29:08.901 --> 01:29:10.620
<v Speaker 3>were going to do permanent damage to</v>
<v Speaker 3>your ears.</v>

1911
01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:11.520
<v Speaker 3>They didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't need.</v>

1912
01:29:11.530 --> 01:29:13.890
<v Speaker 3>Never heard about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like these people just shotguns,</v>

1913
01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:18.930
<v Speaker 3>but I think also the uNfortunate reality</v>
<v Speaker 3>now is that you Could have somebody</v>

1914
01:29:18.931 --> 01:29:23.880
<v Speaker 3>walking around undetected shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting people in a college and you</v>

1915
01:29:23.881 --> 01:29:28.500
<v Speaker 3>could call it why I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on kcrw and walking around the</v>

1916
01:29:28.501 --> 01:29:32.100
<v Speaker 3>Santa monica campus and I really did</v>
<v Speaker 3>think I'm like,</v>

1917
01:29:32.101 --> 01:29:35.180
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's the shooter Coast water?</v>

1918
01:29:35.181 --> 01:29:38.260
<v Speaker 3>And then it shouldn't be a thought that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1919
01:29:38.370 --> 01:29:39.480
<v Speaker 3>it shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1920
01:29:39.481 --> 01:29:42.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a mental health issue when</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like the only person that's</v>

1921
01:29:42.991 --> 01:29:44.790
<v Speaker 3>capable of doing that as a person who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>sick.</v>

1922
01:29:44.850 --> 01:29:45.661
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1923
01:29:45.661 --> 01:29:49.440
<v Speaker 3>and that's the other thing that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>come up when you're talking about mass</v>

1924
01:29:49.441 --> 01:29:52.530
<v Speaker 3>shootings is whenever you hear about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the news,</v>

1925
01:29:52.531 --> 01:29:56.010
<v Speaker 3>nobody makes the correlation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the inescapable correlation between</v>

1926
01:29:56.011 --> 01:30:01.011
<v Speaker 3>psychoactive drugs and mass shootings</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's a lot of fucking mass</v>

1927
01:30:01.231 --> 01:30:03.660
<v Speaker 3>shooters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like almost all of them that are either</v>

1928
01:30:03.661 --> 01:30:08.661
<v Speaker 3>on pharmaceutical drugs like ssri</v>
<v Speaker 3>disassociative drugs or they're getting</v>

1929
01:30:09.091 --> 01:30:11.250
<v Speaker 3>off of um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti psychotic drugs.</v>

1930
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:14.490
<v Speaker 3>There's what can be done is you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no common ground.</v>

1931
01:30:14.491 --> 01:30:17.550
<v Speaker 3>We started having people make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We live in this country where you should</v>

1932
01:30:17.551 --> 01:30:22.551
<v Speaker 3>be able to do whatever you want and hAve</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want.</v>

1933
01:30:22.651 --> 01:30:26.430
<v Speaker 3>But then who gets to decide who gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>crushed in what guns?</v>

1934
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:30.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas has sort of taken the idea that</v>

1935
01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:34.260
<v Speaker 3>just everyBody has a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a well armed society is a polite</v>

1936
01:30:34.261 --> 01:30:35.350
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1937
01:30:35.370 --> 01:30:39.270
<v Speaker 3>my ron white all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then teachers should have guns in</v>

1938
01:30:39.271 --> 01:30:41.010
<v Speaker 3>the classroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And bulletproof helmets,</v>

1939
01:30:41.490 --> 01:30:43.710
<v Speaker 3>full vests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>

1940
01:30:43.950 --> 01:30:45.690
<v Speaker 3>ak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>47 is right there,</v>

1941
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:46.830
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put down the truck.</v>

1942
01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:50.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sucks yet.</v>

1943
01:30:51.130 --> 01:30:52.500
<v Speaker 3>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no easy solution.</v>

1944
01:30:52.570 --> 01:30:54.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it just,</v>

1945
01:30:55.090 --> 01:30:57.000
<v Speaker 3>every time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those things happens,</v>

1946
01:30:57.001 --> 01:31:00.240
<v Speaker 3>everybody buckles down and wants to take</v>
<v Speaker 3>away guns and try to figure out</v>

1947
01:31:00.241 --> 01:31:04.080
<v Speaker 3>legislation and I just feel like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>root of the problem is not the tools</v>

1948
01:31:04.081 --> 01:31:04.870
<v Speaker 3>that people are using.</v>

1949
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:07.020
<v Speaker 3>It's the fact that someone's willing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>use those tools,</v>

1950
01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:08.700
<v Speaker 3>the fact that someone is willing to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1951
01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:13.230
<v Speaker 3>the fact that those guns are more</v>
<v Speaker 3>accessible is a genuine issue.</v>

1952
01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:16.440
<v Speaker 3>But I think we can all agree that no one</v>
<v Speaker 3>came for the guns.</v>

1953
01:31:16.570 --> 01:31:17.760
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obama,</v>

1954
01:31:17.761 --> 01:31:20.110
<v Speaker 3>every single obama's coming for the guns</v>
<v Speaker 3>will.</v>

1955
01:31:20.111 --> 01:31:22.020
<v Speaker 3>Do you know why he knows deanna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1956
01:31:22.250 --> 01:31:24.810
<v Speaker 3>Because the nra is too strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lobbies too strong,</v>

1957
01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:27.390
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've spent a shitload of money and</v>

1958
01:31:27.391 --> 01:31:29.970
<v Speaker 3>continue to spend a shitload of money to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure they protect the second</v>

1959
01:31:29.971 --> 01:31:32.780
<v Speaker 3>amendment rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying if they will,</v>

1960
01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:37.260
<v Speaker 3>if not for the nra,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dash a hundred percent have taken all</v>

1961
01:31:37.261 --> 01:31:38.610
<v Speaker 3>the guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would have definitely done</v>

1962
01:31:38.611 --> 01:31:42.510
<v Speaker 3>something similar to what Australia did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia essentially made gun ownership</v>

1963
01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:43.410
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1964
01:31:43.411 --> 01:31:45.900
<v Speaker 3>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They took away guns.</v>

1965
01:31:45.901 --> 01:31:48.420
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they enact a very strict laws and they</v>

1966
01:31:48.421 --> 01:31:50.810
<v Speaker 3>had like one mass shooting at a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>time ago.</v>

1967
01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:53.010
<v Speaker 3>Had a big mass shooting a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

1968
01:31:53.011 --> 01:31:55.840
<v Speaker 3>That's the only habit is like these big</v>
<v Speaker 3>mass shootings,</v>

1969
01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:57.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you see.</v>

1970
01:31:57.270 --> 01:32:00.730
<v Speaker 3>But Australia has the same amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people's California and it's the size of</v>

1971
01:32:00.731 --> 01:32:02.410
<v Speaker 3>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1972
01:32:02.411 --> 01:32:03.730
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just saw the thing.</v>

1973
01:32:03.731 --> 01:32:06.370
<v Speaker 3>There was a map comparisons until your</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind is like,</v>

1974
01:32:06.371 --> 01:32:10.210
<v Speaker 3>it's the exact same says yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy and people are spread way</v>

1975
01:32:10.211 --> 01:32:14.230
<v Speaker 3>spread out and it's the same amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people's los angeles and it's in this</v>

1976
01:32:14.231 --> 01:32:17.770
<v Speaker 3>giant ass fucking country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you think about being able to</v>

1977
01:32:17.771 --> 01:32:21.070
<v Speaker 3>take people's guns in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's different.</v>

1978
01:32:21.071 --> 01:32:22.210
<v Speaker 3>The culture is different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1979
01:32:22.230 --> 01:32:24.400
<v Speaker 3>the idea of independence is different</v>
<v Speaker 3>over there.</v>

1980
01:32:24.401 --> 01:32:26.600
<v Speaker 3>we have a different attitude over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1981
01:32:26.601 --> 01:32:28.170
<v Speaker 3>I just don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1982
01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:31.510
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you have little kids again.</v>

1983
01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:33.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your changes,</v>

1984
01:32:33.751 --> 01:32:34.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or just like,</v>

1985
01:32:34.570 --> 01:32:35.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't want ever.</v>

1986
01:32:35.530 --> 01:32:39.310
<v Speaker 3>Why worry about them growing up in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>society where a teacher does have to</v>

1987
01:32:39.370 --> 01:32:41.470
<v Speaker 3>think about wearing a fucking helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

1988
01:32:41.471 --> 01:32:43.210
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean nobody wants to think that.</v>

1989
01:32:43.660 --> 01:32:46.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the solution is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the solution.</v>

1990
01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:50.410
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting the guns away from the people.</v>

1991
01:32:50.411 --> 01:32:55.240
<v Speaker 3>There's more guns than there are human</v>
<v Speaker 3>beings in America and they're not.</v>

1992
01:32:55.450 --> 01:33:00.450
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to stop making guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No good business guns of the problem.</v>

1993
01:33:00.881 --> 01:33:02.080
<v Speaker 3>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1994
01:33:02.081 --> 01:33:03.890
<v Speaker 3>I support gun ownership.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

1995
01:33:04.570 --> 01:33:08.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the issue is that we saw in</v>

1996
01:33:08.351 --> 01:33:12.670
<v Speaker 3>France and nice that some crazy fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a car and kill 100 people by</v>

1997
01:33:12.671 --> 01:33:16.060
<v Speaker 3>plowing over pizza and just started</v>
<v Speaker 3>stabbing people to get out of the car</v>

1998
01:33:16.061 --> 01:33:18.190
<v Speaker 3>and just fucking start stabbing folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1999
01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:21.910
<v Speaker 3>there's ways that people lose their</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking minds and do horrible things to</v>

2000
01:33:21.911 --> 01:33:24.490
<v Speaker 3>people and the ways are not things you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to take away.</v>

2001
01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.950
<v Speaker 3>You have to figure out a way and not</v>
<v Speaker 3>take away all hammers.</v>

2002
01:33:27.050 --> 01:33:29.440
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the solution is,</v>

2003
01:33:29.441 --> 01:33:33.790
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think anybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think what you're getting at with</v>

2004
01:33:33.791 --> 01:33:36.340
<v Speaker 3>the mental health stuff is there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not opposed to there being a</v>

2005
01:33:36.341 --> 01:33:39.850
<v Speaker 3>screening process and seeing if you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a history of violence.</v>

2006
01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:40.713
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2007
01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:41.770
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2008
01:33:41.770 --> 01:33:45.820
<v Speaker 3>if you are show up on a terrorist watch</v>
<v Speaker 3>list and that's where I think the nra</v>

2009
01:33:45.821 --> 01:33:49.120
<v Speaker 3>goes overboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're on a fucking terrorist</v>

2010
01:33:49.121 --> 01:33:51.490
<v Speaker 3>watch list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who doesn't agree with that?</v>

2011
01:33:51.730 --> 01:33:53.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only problem with thAt is who gets</v>

2012
01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:56.500
<v Speaker 3>to decide who's on the terrorist watch</v>
<v Speaker 3>list because there was people that were</v>

2013
01:33:56.501 --> 01:33:57.970
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from uh,</v>

2014
01:33:57.971 --> 01:34:02.620
<v Speaker 3>the green party that were put on</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorist watch list after nine slash 11</v>

2015
01:34:02.650 --> 01:34:06.070
<v Speaker 3>because they were anti war protesters</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were put on no fly list.</v>

2016
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:09.120
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of weird shit that</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened where people were put on lists</v>

2017
01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:11.440
<v Speaker 3>because they pissed off the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2018
01:34:11.770 --> 01:34:14.560
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 2001 it was way easier to do</v>

2019
01:34:14.561 --> 01:34:17.710
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is to go to buy a gun and then</v>

2020
01:34:17.711 --> 01:34:19.570
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he can purchase his weapon</v>

2021
01:34:19.571 --> 01:34:23.170
<v Speaker 3>because you're on that list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you go to a gun show that's</v>

2022
01:34:23.171 --> 01:34:25.690
<v Speaker 3>part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go to a gun show and you can buy a</v>

2023
01:34:25.691 --> 01:34:28.960
<v Speaker 3>gun far easier in Kansas city trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>tighten that down though.</v>

2024
01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:30.310
<v Speaker 3>Kansas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kansas,</v>

2025
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:35.320
<v Speaker 3>you can go and correct me If I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't choke up.</v>

2026
01:34:35.321 --> 01:34:40.321
<v Speaker 3>This place sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What am I still go to Kansas and then</v>

2027
01:34:40.450 --> 01:34:43.360
<v Speaker 3>you can get a gun with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2028
01:34:43.530 --> 01:34:48.110
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can just an id Kansas id and get it</v>

2029
01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:50.830
<v Speaker 3>in maybe like five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zero traIn.</v>

2030
01:34:50.890 --> 01:34:51.640
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing.</v>

2031
01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:53.920
<v Speaker 3>Just you get it right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to have a background</v>

2032
01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:54.754
<v Speaker 3>check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

2033
01:34:55.070 --> 01:34:56.260
<v Speaker 3>So is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2034
01:34:56.710 --> 01:35:00.340
<v Speaker 3>Was that like when you did in 2014?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did this Piece yet.</v>

2035
01:35:00.341 --> 01:35:01.300
<v Speaker 3>But you can look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we,</v>

2036
01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:03.610
<v Speaker 3>can we check the gun laws?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kansas?</v>

2037
01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:06.170
<v Speaker 3>No background check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No background check.</v>

2038
01:35:06.171 --> 01:35:09.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty certain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why wouldn't you have to disclose in</v>

2039
01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Kansas?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listening to this guy he does with his</v>

2040
01:35:11.301 --> 01:35:15.080
<v Speaker 3>grandma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he walks into this place and he goes,</v>

2041
01:35:15.081 --> 01:35:17.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

2042
01:35:17.370 --> 01:35:22.010
<v Speaker 3>The guy says I caN't buy the gun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she can like that he buys these four</v>

2043
01:35:22.011 --> 01:35:24.230
<v Speaker 3>guns or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kills a bunch of people.</v>

2044
01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:30.020
<v Speaker 3>So federal law requires federallY</v>
<v Speaker 3>licensed firearms dealers but not</v>

2045
01:35:30.021 --> 01:35:34.970
<v Speaker 3>private sellers to initiate a background</v>
<v Speaker 3>check on the purchase purchaser prior to</v>

2046
01:35:34.971 --> 01:35:36.440
<v Speaker 3>sale a firearm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a result,</v>

2047
01:35:36.441 --> 01:35:39.890
<v Speaker 3>concealed weapons license holders in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kansas are exempt from the federal</v>

2048
01:35:39.891 --> 01:35:41.270
<v Speaker 3>background check requirement.</v>

2049
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:42.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

2050
01:35:42.201 --> 01:35:43.730
<v Speaker 3>No training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no background check hold on.</v>

2051
01:35:43.731 --> 01:35:47.150
<v Speaker 3>A second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Concealed weapons license holders like</v>

2052
01:35:47.151 --> 01:35:48.920
<v Speaker 3>you have to have a concealed weapons</v>
<v Speaker 3>license,</v>

2053
01:35:48.921 --> 01:35:53.240
<v Speaker 3>which is difficult to acquire and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not easy to get a concealed weapons</v>

2054
01:35:53.241 --> 01:35:55.610
<v Speaker 3>license unless they have a different</v>
<v Speaker 3>law,</v>

2055
01:35:55.611 --> 01:35:58.430
<v Speaker 3>theIr background checks and cans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>concealed weapon,</v>

2056
01:35:58.470 --> 01:36:02.240
<v Speaker 3>but I think concealed weapons is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hardest thing to get is a concealed</v>

2057
01:36:02.241 --> 01:36:05.390
<v Speaker 3>carry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Federal law provides states with the</v>

2058
01:36:05.391 --> 01:36:09.230
<v Speaker 3>options of serving as state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kansas has no law requiring firearms</v>

2059
01:36:09.231 --> 01:36:12.890
<v Speaker 3>dealers to initiate background checks</v>
<v Speaker 3>prior to transferring a firearm.</v>

2060
01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:16.610
<v Speaker 3>As a result in Kansas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>firearms dealers must initiate the</v>

2061
01:36:16.611 --> 01:36:18.770
<v Speaker 3>backgrouNd check required by federal</v>
<v Speaker 3>law,</v>

2062
01:36:18.771 --> 01:36:23.771
<v Speaker 3>bY contacting the fbi directly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kansas is not a point of contact state,</v>

2063
01:36:24.990 --> 01:36:27.650
<v Speaker 3>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they have to contact the fbi.</v>

2064
01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:31.130
<v Speaker 3>A federal law does not require dealers</v>
<v Speaker 3>to conduct a background check of a</v>

2065
01:36:31.131 --> 01:36:33.680
<v Speaker 3>firearm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Purchaser presents a state permit to</v>

2066
01:36:33.681 --> 01:36:35.270
<v Speaker 3>purchase or possess firearms.</v>

2067
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:39.800
<v Speaker 3>It meets certain conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it seems like tHere's definitely some</v>

2068
01:36:39.801 --> 01:36:40.940
<v Speaker 3>wiggle room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2069
01:36:40.941 --> 01:36:41.421
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2070
01:36:41.421 --> 01:36:43.250
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an area is talking about these</v>

2071
01:36:43.251 --> 01:36:47.360
<v Speaker 3>gun shows where you can just go gobble</v>
<v Speaker 3>up a bunch of firearms and that he can</v>

2072
01:36:47.361 --> 01:36:49.250
<v Speaker 3>bring them into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they just transport them</v>

2073
01:36:49.251 --> 01:36:53.690
<v Speaker 3>across state lines and it's one of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like many human issues where</v>

2074
01:36:53.691 --> 01:36:57.290
<v Speaker 3>there's not a whole lot of like clear</v>
<v Speaker 3>paths.</v>

2075
01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:00.560
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's so many guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're never going to take them all away</v>

2076
01:37:00.561 --> 01:37:02.520
<v Speaker 3>from people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And should you take them all away from</v>

2077
01:37:02.521 --> 01:37:04.490
<v Speaker 3>him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if a guy like you as a gun,</v>

2078
01:37:04.730 --> 01:37:09.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like danger a threat unless</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get in one of your god damn tirade.</v>

2079
01:37:09.870 --> 01:37:11.570
<v Speaker 3>He might maybe have another best example</v>

2080
01:37:11.890 --> 01:37:14.960
<v Speaker 5>that hack</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking stealing.</v>

2081
01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:19.153
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2082
01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:21.190
<v Speaker 3>did you hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bit like a.</v>

2083
01:37:21.250 --> 01:37:22.340
<v Speaker 3>Not a bid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The video.</v>

2084
01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:26.260
<v Speaker 3>Carlos min sia was on joey diaz a show</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that he thought about bringing a</v>

2085
01:37:26.261 --> 01:37:28.360
<v Speaker 3>gun around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to the comedy store and shooting</v>

2086
01:37:28.361 --> 01:37:29.990
<v Speaker 3>people and he was carrying a gun in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

2087
01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:31.590
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no way,</v>

2088
01:37:31.591 --> 01:37:35.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm crazy while there maybe you</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't have a gun.</v>

2089
01:37:36.670 --> 01:37:38.000
<v Speaker 3>That'S where I started thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ohio,</v>

2090
01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:40.510
<v Speaker 3>which brings me back and then started</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about,</v>

<v Speaker 7>to figure out how we're going to do this</v>
<v Speaker 7>like this.</v>

2218
01:43:08.290 --> 01:43:09.550
<v Speaker 7>This has to be dealt with.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>this is not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not okay.</v>

2280
01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:40.810
<v Speaker 2>Parents don't want their kids and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids are just compLete asshole.</v>

2281
01:45:40.811 --> 01:45:42.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go to parties and they drink and</v>

2282
01:45:42.401 --> 01:45:45.190
<v Speaker 2>they leave the kIds outside and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents,</v>

2283
01:45:45.191 --> 01:45:47.950
<v Speaker 2>these particular parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't watch the kid ever.</v>

2284
01:45:48.150 --> 01:45:49.780
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like what they're famous for</v>

2285
01:45:49.781 --> 01:45:52.210
<v Speaker 2>apparently in their group that just</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't watch this kid.</v>

2286
01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:54.160
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to be parents.</v>

2287
01:45:54.161 --> 01:45:56.620
<v Speaker 2>They became parents in their forties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't</v>

2288
01:45:56.740 --> 01:46:00.250
<v Speaker 7>really planned it out that I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 7>if the parents get along.</v>

2289
01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:02.380
<v Speaker 7>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I dunno how we put the whole thing looks</v>

2290
01:46:02.381 --> 01:46:05.830
<v Speaker 7>like a disaster and the kids a little</v>
<v Speaker 7>monster and they just are not.</v>

2291
01:46:05.950 --> 01:46:09.190
<v Speaker 7>They're not disciplining him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>paying attention and like he literally</v>

2292
01:46:09.191 --> 01:46:11.950
<v Speaker 7>went out and talked to the kid and there</v>
<v Speaker 7>was some commotion going on.</v>

2293
01:46:11.951 --> 01:46:14.080
<v Speaker 7>Were people complaining about the kid</v>
<v Speaker 7>hitting somebody?</v>

2294
01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:17.320
<v Speaker 7>He talked to the kid and then he high</v>
<v Speaker 7>fived him and then the kid went back to</v>

2295
01:46:17.321 --> 01:46:19.640
<v Speaker 7>doing it again.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean literally he went back inside to</v>

2296
01:46:19.641 --> 01:46:21.250
<v Speaker 7>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The kid went back outside again.</v>

2297
01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:25.020
<v Speaker 7>So at the end of the night when this guy</v>
<v Speaker 7>apologized to me like it,</v>

2298
01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.500
<v Speaker 7>if the kid was doing it all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>now I go,</v>

2299
01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:28.090
<v Speaker 7>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your kid is really aggressive.</v>

2300
01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:29.410
<v Speaker 7>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm sorry.</v>

2301
01:46:29.411 --> 01:46:31.640
<v Speaker 7>I'm sorry about the kid I go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your kid is really aggressive with no,</v>

2302
01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:32.810
<v Speaker 7>he's a good kid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I go,</v>

2303
01:46:32.811 --> 01:46:33.501
<v Speaker 7>don't look.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He hit,</v>

2304
01:46:33.501 --> 01:46:35.590
<v Speaker 7>he hit three people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I saw him hit people,</v>

2305
01:46:35.770 --> 01:46:37.600
<v Speaker 7>I saw them push a kid and call him a</v>
<v Speaker 7>loser.</v>

2306
01:46:38.110 --> 01:46:40.450
<v Speaker 7>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's fucking six and he's doing this.</v>

2307
01:46:40.510 --> 01:46:41.530
<v Speaker 7>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that never happened.</v>

2308
01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:46.900
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had to understand consequences.</v>

2309
01:46:46.901 --> 01:46:49.010
<v Speaker 7>This is why I bite my tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I understand like the,</v>

2310
01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:52.890
<v Speaker 7>the actual consequences of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of smacking this guy and his fucking</v>

2311
01:46:52.891 --> 01:46:54.480
<v Speaker 7>mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is what I wanted to do,</v>

2312
01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:55.513
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Of course,</v>

2313
01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:58.620
<v Speaker 7>if there was no consequences to doing</v>
<v Speaker 7>anything and I didn't think of him as a</v>

2314
01:46:58.621 --> 01:47:02.150
<v Speaker 7>person.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't think of him as a guy who just</v>

2315
01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:04.350
<v Speaker 7>never raised the kid before,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hasn't really thought about it.</v>

2316
01:47:04.351 --> 01:47:06.180
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>has a big career,</v>

2317
01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:09.120
<v Speaker 7>probably busy all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wife's busy all the time.</v>

2318
01:47:09.270 --> 01:47:11.940
<v Speaker 7>Just not doing a good job raising a</v>
<v Speaker 7>little monster,</v>

2319
01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:15.270
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>drinking to try to drown out the facts.</v>

2320
01:47:15.271 --> 01:47:16.470
<v Speaker 7>Who knows why,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2321
01:47:16.471 --> 01:47:18.390
<v Speaker 7>drinking because he doesn't like being</v>
<v Speaker 7>married,</v>

2322
01:47:18.391 --> 01:47:19.770
<v Speaker 7>drinking because he doesn't like being a</v>
<v Speaker 7>dad.</v>

2323
01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:22.230
<v Speaker 7>Drinking because he doesn't like being</v>
<v Speaker 7>sober.</v>

2324
01:47:22.231 --> 01:47:23.220
<v Speaker 7>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

2325
01:47:23.221 --> 01:47:25.860
<v Speaker 7>I don't know the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but in that moment when he's looking at</v>

2326
01:47:25.861 --> 01:47:27.060
<v Speaker 7>me and going,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that never happened.</v>

2327
01:47:27.570 --> 01:47:32.570
<v Speaker 7>I just did just to the fucking sheer</v>
<v Speaker 7>ignorance and incompetence and</v>

2328
01:47:33.901 --> 01:47:37.950
<v Speaker 7>irresponsibility was just so infuriating</v>
<v Speaker 7>because I've watched my kids,</v>

2329
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:40.200
<v Speaker 7>like I've watched them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I talk to them,</v>

2330
01:47:40.201 --> 01:47:42.720
<v Speaker 7>I communicate with them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know I didn't have a good childhood,</v>

2331
01:47:42.750 --> 01:47:46.710
<v Speaker 7>so for me it's important to be a good</v>
<v Speaker 7>dad and spend as much time as I can.</v>

2332
01:47:46.711 --> 01:47:48.870
<v Speaker 7>Communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 7>explaining shit,</v>

2333
01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:51.090
<v Speaker 7>talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>treating them like I'm not just their</v>

2334
01:47:51.091 --> 01:47:52.890
<v Speaker 7>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but also I'm their friend and I care</v>

2335
01:47:52.891 --> 01:47:53.600
<v Speaker 7>about them.</v>

2336
01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:57.380
<v Speaker 2>My wife is a first grade teacher and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's become a educational therapists</v>

2337
01:47:57.381 --> 01:48:01.430
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm like living with just the master</v>

2338
01:48:01.490 --> 01:48:04.910
<v Speaker 2>at consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you don't eat in our house or</v>

2339
01:48:05.210 --> 01:48:08.480
<v Speaker 2>decide you don't like broccoli,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing else is coming.</v>

2340
01:48:10.850 --> 01:48:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Good kitchen is closed and that's when</v>
<v Speaker 2>people create monsters.</v>

2341
01:48:15.231 --> 01:48:17.930
<v Speaker 2>When they cater to them so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>

2342
01:48:18.310 --> 01:48:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Let me in and that's where you like your</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid only eats fucking rice.</v>

2343
01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:24.440
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who and he keeps feeding</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking kid sugar.</v>

2344
01:48:24.441 --> 01:48:26.960
<v Speaker 2>This kid just eats nothing but sugar all</v>
<v Speaker 2>day because he doesn't need.</v>

2345
01:48:26.961 --> 01:48:27.581
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2346
01:48:27.581 --> 01:48:29.870
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean he doesn't eat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's always eating cookies because he</v>

2347
01:48:29.871 --> 01:48:30.704
<v Speaker 2>won't eat his food.</v>

2348
01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:31.980
<v Speaker 7>I got to feed him something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I go,</v>

2349
01:48:31.981 --> 01:48:32.814
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

<v Speaker 7>cookies.</v>

2351
01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:37.560
<v Speaker 7>You've got food.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You've got actual food.</v>

2352
01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:39.840
<v Speaker 7>This fucking kid is just eating nothing</v>
<v Speaker 7>but candy.</v>

2353
01:48:39.841 --> 01:48:41.340
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's bananas.</v>

2354
01:48:41.341 --> 01:48:43.210
<v Speaker 7>He's always got a soda in his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh</v>

01:48:43.290 --> 01:48:44.190
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's six.</v>

2356
01:48:44.370 --> 01:48:47.790
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking six and he's drinking a</v>
<v Speaker 2>full coke or you go over the house.</v>

2357
01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:49.850
<v Speaker 2>The kid has a root beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We sell these kids.</v>

2358
01:48:49.851 --> 01:48:54.851
<v Speaker 2>We were on a flight and a saudis to</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents sit in first class and then come</v>

2359
01:48:58.141 --> 01:48:59.880
<v Speaker 2>back and check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know what was going on and</v>

2360
01:48:59.881 --> 01:49:02.910
<v Speaker 2>coach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put three next to each other and</v>

2361
01:49:02.911 --> 01:49:06.090
<v Speaker 2>coach some motherfuckers I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

2362
01:49:06.091 --> 01:49:07.920
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then everybody else has to do with</v>

2363
01:49:07.921 --> 01:49:10.260
<v Speaker 2>their kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gave each of them my pants.</v>

2364
01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:14.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they waitress,</v>

2365
01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:18.870
<v Speaker 2>the waitress or the stewardess comes by</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she looks at these three kids and</v>

2366
01:49:18.871 --> 01:49:22.020
<v Speaker 2>looks around for who they're with and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that will have the kids.</v>

2367
01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:27.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling eight is the oldest one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a maybe six and four.</v>

2368
01:49:28.981 --> 01:49:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Three just in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ,</v>

2369
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:35.990
<v Speaker 2>the oldest one goes three sprites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sprites.</v>

2370
01:49:36.090 --> 01:49:38.370
<v Speaker 2>This is a red eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is an overnight flight.</v>

2371
01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:40.890
<v Speaker 2>They're on ipads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just animals just</v>

2372
01:49:44.220 --> 01:49:48.670
<v Speaker 2>don't stop trying to win something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2373
01:49:48.730 --> 01:49:51.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife were sort of laughing at first,</v>

2374
01:49:51.310 --> 01:49:54.880
<v Speaker 2>but everybody in our family wants to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sleep.</v>

2375
01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:58.030
<v Speaker 2>They already exhausted from being out</v>
<v Speaker 2>all day.</v>

2376
01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:01.270
<v Speaker 2>I've never is a while ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never be on this flight again.</v>

2377
01:50:01.271 --> 01:50:03.220
<v Speaker 2>No red eyes for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This horrible,</v>

2378
01:50:03.221 --> 01:50:05.260
<v Speaker 2>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ruined for days,</v>

2379
01:50:05.261 --> 01:50:06.520
<v Speaker 2>two days afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucked.</v>

2380
01:50:06.610 --> 01:50:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tried to do anything in your power to</v>

2381
01:50:09.281 --> 01:50:11.860
<v Speaker 2>avoid a read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also try to do everything in your</v>

2382
01:50:11.861 --> 01:50:16.780
<v Speaker 2>power to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at if you can fly nonstop,</v>

2383
01:50:17.530 --> 01:50:19.100
<v Speaker 2>that's 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2384
01:50:19.690 --> 01:50:24.690
<v Speaker 2>So they get in a fight after a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start fighting because they're all</v>

2385
01:50:25.391 --> 01:50:29.050
<v Speaker 2>hopped up on sugar and they were staring</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the screen and fucking so then they</v>

2386
01:50:29.051 --> 01:50:33.900
<v Speaker 2>started fighting and I think the mom or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dad hears or somebody has to tap</v>

2387
01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:35.770
<v Speaker 2>them to get up and me and my wife was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2388
01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:37.750
<v Speaker 2>this is not okay.</v>

2389
01:50:39.190 --> 01:50:44.190
<v Speaker 2>Nothing was said because again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just want to monitor on business.</v>

2390
01:50:44.591 --> 01:50:46.390
<v Speaker 2>Ideally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2391
01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:49.120
<v Speaker 2>ideally everyone minds their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

2392
01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:52.600
<v Speaker 2>This is a new world though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This world of electronic babysitters and</v>

2393
01:50:52.601 --> 01:50:56.070
<v Speaker 2>the world of putting the kids and coach</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you go into first class,</v>

2394
01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:58.840
<v Speaker 2>like ignoring kids and it's these career</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2395
01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:03.100
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they their career requires all their</v>

2396
01:51:03.101 --> 01:51:04.630
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They justified by go look,</v>

2397
01:51:04.631 --> 01:51:06.850
<v Speaker 2>someone's gotta make the money in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>household so we can keep up this</v>

2398
01:51:06.851 --> 01:51:08.500
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're out there fucking</v>

2399
01:51:08.501 --> 01:51:10.630
<v Speaker 2>grinding all day and then the kids are</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2400
01:51:10.810 --> 01:51:15.160
<v Speaker 2>what do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It be me full circle to my dad passing</v>

2401
01:51:15.161 --> 01:51:18.070
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's at every single weekend and this is</v>

2402
01:51:18.071 --> 01:51:22.900
<v Speaker 2>why I bought that fj 62 lane cruiser</v>
<v Speaker 2>because every single weekend we went on</v>

2403
01:51:22.901 --> 01:51:27.901
<v Speaker 2>a little family trip and I looked at</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself and we'd go on family vacations</v>

2404
01:51:28.331 --> 01:51:30.820
<v Speaker 2>and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the amount of time that my family</v>

2405
01:51:30.821 --> 01:51:33.940
<v Speaker 2>really spent together like a mom and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad,</v>

2406
01:51:33.941 --> 01:51:35.740
<v Speaker 2>like he would take us to yosemite.</v>

2407
01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:37.990
<v Speaker 2>He would take us up the coast of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mendocino,</v>

2408
01:51:37.991 --> 01:51:41.380
<v Speaker 2>we'd go to marin or stinson beach and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these places,</v>

2409
01:51:41.381 --> 01:51:44.290
<v Speaker 2>even in golden gate park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he would just take us places,</v>

2410
01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:45.730
<v Speaker 2>little adventures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2411
01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:51.120
<v Speaker 2>And so I feel like we need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get caught up in work working because</v>

2412
01:51:51.410 --> 01:51:56.410
<v Speaker 2>it just nonstop and I got to take a step</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and really spend as much time as I</v>

2413
01:51:58.361 --> 01:52:00.130
<v Speaker 2>possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So after that happened,</v>

2414
01:52:00.131 --> 01:52:02.170
<v Speaker 2>and this is june,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so almost a year ago,</v>

2415
01:52:02.890 --> 01:52:07.660
<v Speaker 2>just really tried trim back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to every single volleyball game.</v>

2416
01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:11.740
<v Speaker 2>I go to every practice I possibly can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2417
01:52:11.741 --> 01:52:14.770
<v Speaker 2>and just force yourself to say this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

2418
01:52:15.290 --> 01:52:18.010
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter that much because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at all these deathbed.</v>

2419
01:52:18.100 --> 01:52:20.440
<v Speaker 2>That's what I started looking at all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these deathbed regrets.</v>

2420
01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:22.060
<v Speaker 2>Those are a bunch of lists that are out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2421
01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:25.600
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too much time spent at work.</v>

2422
01:52:26.190 --> 01:52:29.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>not enough time spent with people that I</v>

2423
01:52:29.771 --> 01:52:30.700
<v Speaker 2>love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2424
01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:32.560
<v Speaker 2>and look at all these things and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2425
01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:35.320
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not having any of these regrets.</v>

2426
01:52:35.620 --> 01:52:38.650
<v Speaker 2>So that's What I'm thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started looking at the real estate and</v>

2427
01:52:38.651 --> 01:52:40.600
<v Speaker 2>trying to look at getting away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2428
01:52:40.601 --> 01:52:43.690
<v Speaker 2>just really check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I'm trying to hustle and</v>

2429
01:52:43.691 --> 01:52:47.450
<v Speaker 2>make as much money as I and kids who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a house.</v>

2430
01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Where are you going to go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm checking into.</v>

2431
01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:52.250
<v Speaker 2>That's what I know a lot about</v>
<v Speaker 2>cambridge.</v>

2432
01:52:52.650 --> 01:52:56.980
<v Speaker 2>That's a big sur or one of those places</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could go up there and you're,</v>

2433
01:52:57.040 --> 01:52:59.720
<v Speaker 2>you're away and just live on the coast</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then be able to come back.</v>

2434
01:52:59.721 --> 01:53:01.850
<v Speaker 2>Like if I get an acting gig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love acting.</v>

2435
01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:03.170
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoy it.</v>

2436
01:53:03.890 --> 01:53:08.590
<v Speaker 2>I love writing too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was luckily had some success recently</v>

2437
01:53:08.591 --> 01:53:13.591
<v Speaker 2>as a comedy writer and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the cbs people I was trying</v>

2438
01:53:15.201 --> 01:53:19.580
<v Speaker 2>to match up with the latino show runner</v>
<v Speaker 2>and two years ago they go,</v>

2439
01:53:19.590 --> 01:53:20.120
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2440
01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:21.270
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's you,</v>

2441
01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:22.520
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be that guy.</v>

2442
01:53:23.470 --> 01:53:25.570
<v Speaker 2>There aren't really any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're grooming you to be that.</v>

2443
01:53:25.571 --> 01:53:29.120
<v Speaker 2>And I wrote too big scripts and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>that business background,</v>

2444
01:53:29.630 --> 01:53:33.350
<v Speaker 2>I have the ability to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

2445
01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:38.380
<v Speaker 2>I like working with people and I think I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could staff up and do all that shit so I</v>

2446
01:53:38.601 --> 01:53:42.940
<v Speaker 2>could see myself splitting my time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping my little house in la and then</v>

2447
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:47.330
<v Speaker 2>having a place in cambria or santa</v>
<v Speaker 2>barbara and just fucking go back and</v>

2448
01:53:47.331 --> 01:53:48.470
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Santa barbara is easy.</v>

2449
01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:51.560
<v Speaker 2>It's only an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour and 10 just living on the beach and</v>

2450
01:53:51.590 --> 01:53:56.590
<v Speaker 2>have a blue heeler be able to sit back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and watch the ocean.</v>

2451
01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Just calm yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calm yourself,</v>

2452
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:02.090
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what,</v>

2453
01:54:02.150 --> 01:54:05.270
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking ari shaffir said that when he</v>

2454
01:54:05.271 --> 01:54:09.920
<v Speaker 2>was walking on a beach and he needed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>walk to a restaurant,</v>

2455
01:54:09.921 --> 01:54:14.240
<v Speaker 2>40 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he had this feeling in his head</v>

2456
01:54:14.570 --> 01:54:16.700
<v Speaker 2>that oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to be doing something right now</v>

2457
01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:21.350
<v Speaker 2>and that he needed to curb that and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>needed to just watch the waves.</v>

2458
01:54:21.870 --> 01:54:23.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>

2459
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:27.470
<v Speaker 2>Not think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I have is the problem I</v>

2460
01:54:27.471 --> 01:54:30.710
<v Speaker 2>have is I have a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you try to meditate,</v>

2461
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:35.600
<v Speaker 2>people have said there's a river of</v>
<v Speaker 2>20,000 thoughts that you get just</v>

2462
01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:38.450
<v Speaker 2>nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've been waking up every single</v>

2463
01:54:38.451 --> 01:54:40.580
<v Speaker 2>night at 2:00 in the morning every</v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

2464
01:54:40.810 --> 01:54:42.380
<v Speaker 2>almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not every night,</v>

2465
01:54:42.381 --> 01:54:44.690
<v Speaker 2>but four or five nights a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why</v>

2466
01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:51.830
<v Speaker 2>different reasons to think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts just and then just thinking</v>

2467
01:54:51.831 --> 01:54:53.890
<v Speaker 2>about stuff nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2468
01:54:53.891 --> 01:54:56.930
<v Speaker 2>let's just see what you're saying to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two different contradictory things.</v>

2469
01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:01.130
<v Speaker 2>You're saying that you want peace and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want calm and then you're saying you</v>

2470
01:55:01.131 --> 01:55:05.030
<v Speaker 2>want to start running shows and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying you want to start having</v>

2471
01:55:05.390 --> 01:55:09.440
<v Speaker 2>multiple careers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be able to work on coming into</v>

2472
01:55:09.441 --> 01:55:11.090
<v Speaker 2>town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do a gig,</v>

2473
01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:13.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You caN't be a show runner.</v>

2474
01:55:13.130 --> 01:55:18.130
<v Speaker 2>Work on a thing for like you sAid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the show that I'm on is 10 episodes and</v>

2475
01:55:18.410 --> 01:55:22.940
<v Speaker 2>we worked on that for five months and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I wanted to do nothing else.</v>

2476
01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:25.070
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know that when you work on a</v>

2477
01:55:25.071 --> 01:55:27.170
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're working 16 hour days.</v>

2478
01:55:27.260 --> 01:55:30.560
<v Speaker 2>Like if you want to be a show runner for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a successful show that the amount of</v>

2479
01:55:30.561 --> 01:55:34.530
<v Speaker 2>time that's required to actually make</v>
<v Speaker 2>something take off sure was massive.</v>

2480
01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:37.910
<v Speaker 2>We you have to manage a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>different people and expectations and.</v>

2481
01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:41.180
<v Speaker 2>but it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a portion of your year,</v>

2482
01:55:41.780 --> 01:55:45.180
<v Speaker 2>so it'd be like working seasonal work</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost secret.</v>

2483
01:55:45.181 --> 01:55:47.190
<v Speaker 2>You just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's It for me.</v>

2484
01:55:47.191 --> 01:55:52.191
<v Speaker 2>That's the ideal version.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has to act on a show that has a episode</v>

2485
01:55:53.551 --> 01:55:58.200
<v Speaker 2>order and then go back to santa barbara</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then do nothing,</v>

2486
01:55:58.590 --> 01:56:03.590
<v Speaker 2>saw a bad idea and then come back and be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to just control your own work is</v>

2487
01:56:04.321 --> 01:56:08.670
<v Speaker 2>really what I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to financial freedom to be able</v>

2488
01:56:08.671 --> 01:56:12.390
<v Speaker 2>to do that and then those shows pay</v>
<v Speaker 2>really well.</v>

2489
01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:15.180
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just trying to map out and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have the answer.</v>

2490
01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:17.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is certainly not something I'm</v>

2491
01:56:17.521 --> 01:56:19.410
<v Speaker 2>doing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

2492
01:56:19.411 --> 01:56:23.850
<v Speaker 2>when you work seasonally and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can really take some time to just hang</v>

2493
01:56:23.851 --> 01:56:28.230
<v Speaker 2>out and read on a deck and make dinner</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's your go shop for an</v>

2494
01:56:28.231 --> 01:56:31.830
<v Speaker 2>individual meal every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go and fish and do shit like that.</v>

2495
01:56:32.490 --> 01:56:34.890
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You seem like you're longing for this.</v>

2496
01:56:34.891 --> 01:56:39.891
<v Speaker 7>I'm idealistic view of peace and quiet</v>
<v Speaker 7>while pursuing chaos.</v>

2497
01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:43.600
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're very contradictory.</v>

2498
01:56:43.601 --> 01:56:44.520
<v Speaker 7>You understand what I'm saying?</v>

2499
01:56:44.710 --> 01:56:47.570
<v Speaker 2>Totally will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ThiS is something that I promised myself</v>

2500
01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:51.260
<v Speaker 2>I was going to bust my ass until I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 and I'm 48.</v>

2501
01:56:51.261 --> 01:56:56.261
<v Speaker 2>I'm about to turn 46 and then just take</v>
<v Speaker 2>it as it comes when realistically as she</v>

2502
01:56:57.121 --> 01:57:01.250
<v Speaker 2>just take it as it comes right now and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not now.</v>

2503
01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:03.310
<v Speaker 2>I hustle really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2504
01:57:03.311 --> 01:57:05.670
<v Speaker 2>I have 10 things going on.</v>

2505
01:57:06.250 --> 01:57:08.260
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a weird balancing act trying to</v>

2506
01:57:08.270 --> 01:57:10.300
<v Speaker 7>figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>figure out how to manage your life for</v>

2507
01:57:10.301 --> 01:57:15.301
<v Speaker 7>ultimate happiness and then sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 7>like that the real ultimate happiness</v>

2508
01:57:15.611 --> 01:57:20.611
<v Speaker 7>comes after you've had struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you only really appreciate sunlight</v>

2509
01:57:20.771 --> 01:57:23.030
<v Speaker 7>if you get a lot of rain,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like we don't have.</v>

2510
01:57:23.170 --> 01:57:28.120
<v Speaker 7>Like I went to prince of wales island in</v>
<v Speaker 7>Alaska for six days once and we were up</v>

2511
01:57:28.121 --> 01:57:30.940
<v Speaker 7>there camping.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's fuckiNg miserable pouring rain</v>

2512
01:57:30.941 --> 01:57:33.690
<v Speaker 7>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But when I came back to la,</v>

2513
01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:35.530
<v Speaker 7>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was happy.</v>

2514
01:57:35.860 --> 01:57:39.790
<v Speaker 7>The sunlight felt so good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean it felt like the sunlight's out</v>

2515
01:57:39.791 --> 01:57:41.710
<v Speaker 7>there right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't feel like shit.</v>

2516
01:57:41.711 --> 01:57:42.560
<v Speaker 7>I get mY car,</v>
<v Speaker 7>god,</v>

2517
01:57:42.561 --> 01:57:43.900
<v Speaker 7>it's hot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I drive off.</v>

2518
01:57:44.170 --> 01:57:47.230
<v Speaker 7>I don't appreciate it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but when I came back from Alaska I</v>

2519
01:57:47.231 --> 01:57:51.970
<v Speaker 7>really fucking appreciate it and I feel</v>
<v Speaker 7>like some amount of the peace and quiet</v>

2520
01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:54.430
<v Speaker 7>that we seek and we enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're only gonna.</v>

2521
01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:57.120
<v Speaker 7>Appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you struggle like you're only going</v>

2522
01:57:57.121 --> 01:58:02.080
<v Speaker 7>to appreciate like real relaxation feet</v>
<v Speaker 7>up out the beach if you've been busting</v>

2523
01:58:02.081 --> 01:58:02.730
<v Speaker 7>your ass.</v>

2524
01:58:02.730 --> 01:58:07.730
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I think a tremendous amount of calm</v>

2525
01:58:08.071 --> 01:58:09.890
<v Speaker 2>comes from is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>

2526
01:58:09.891 --> 01:58:13.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can tell me is just financial</v>

2527
01:58:13.501 --> 01:58:15.570
<v Speaker 2>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't have a house payment</v>

2528
01:58:15.571 --> 01:58:18.990
<v Speaker 2>hanging over my head and I don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff that I'm just worried</v>

2529
01:58:18.991 --> 01:58:23.760
<v Speaker 2>about and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend to worry a lot about that stuff.</v>

2530
01:58:23.761 --> 01:58:26.910
<v Speaker 2>That's why I worked my ass off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I really want to just.</v>

2531
01:58:26.911 --> 01:58:30.870
<v Speaker 2>And I'm over complicating my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I am and,</v>

2532
01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:32.370
<v Speaker 2>and david really big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see me?</v>

2533
01:58:32.410 --> 01:58:33.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a happy guy,</v>

2534
01:58:34.590 --> 01:58:37.590
<v Speaker 2>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we waken up in the middle of the</v>

2535
01:58:37.591 --> 01:58:39.930
<v Speaker 2>night at 2:00 in the morning thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about all the shit that you have to do,</v>

2536
01:58:39.931 --> 01:58:41.740
<v Speaker 2>you had to pare some stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2537
01:58:41.741 --> 01:58:45.040
<v Speaker 2>there's that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're a financially free,</v>

2538
01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:49.480
<v Speaker 7>it removes a gigantic burden.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I remember my first development deal.</v>

2539
01:58:49.481 --> 01:58:52.540
<v Speaker 7>That was the first thing I felt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got a development deal way back in the</v>

2540
01:58:52.541 --> 01:58:54.400
<v Speaker 7>nineties and the first thing that</v>
<v Speaker 7>happened,</v>

2541
01:58:54.401 --> 01:58:58.180
<v Speaker 7>they sent me thIs big fat check and all</v>
<v Speaker 7>of a sudden I felt lighter.</v>

2542
01:58:58.420 --> 01:58:59.320
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like something.</v>

2543
01:58:59.321 --> 01:59:01.540
<v Speaker 7>Like I took a backpack off,</v>
<v Speaker 7>filled with rocks.</v>

2544
01:59:01.541 --> 01:59:05.200
<v Speaker 7>Like ugh.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now I knew that I could paY my bills for</v>

2545
01:59:05.201 --> 01:59:08.380
<v Speaker 7>the foreseeable future.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was going to be able to pay my bills</v>

2546
01:59:08.381 --> 01:59:11.170
<v Speaker 7>for the next,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like more than a year if I wanted to do</v>

2547
01:59:11.171 --> 01:59:13.390
<v Speaker 7>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sit back for a year and live the way I'm</v>

2548
01:59:13.391 --> 01:59:15.130
<v Speaker 7>living,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'd have no problem paying my bills.</v>

2549
01:59:15.790 --> 01:59:19.420
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was a very tangible feeling like,</v>

2550
01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:21.850
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>now that I have this momentum,</v>

2551
01:59:21.940 --> 01:59:24.400
<v Speaker 7>I've got to keep this going because I</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't ever want to go back to that</v>

2552
01:59:24.401 --> 01:59:28.690
<v Speaker 7>feeling of not being able to pay my</v>
<v Speaker 7>bills because that's the real struggle.</v>

2553
01:59:28.720 --> 01:59:31.510
<v Speaker 7>The real struggle is like financial</v>
<v Speaker 7>independence.</v>

2554
01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:35.410
<v Speaker 7>Once You become financially independent,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then there's levels to it,</v>

2555
01:59:35.450 --> 01:59:36.700
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you want to have one of those</v>

2556
01:59:36.701 --> 01:59:40.210
<v Speaker 7>monosito houses or have a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 7>private jet or you want to get crazier</v>

2557
01:59:40.211 --> 01:59:42.610
<v Speaker 7>and crazier and crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're just so overly confident.</v>

2558
01:59:43.630 --> 01:59:46.850
<v Speaker 2>That's like the assistant thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2559
01:59:46.910 --> 01:59:50.450
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I feel like this level right here.</v>

2560
01:59:50.451 --> 01:59:53.390
<v Speaker 2>So I'm living in the house that I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to live in.</v>

2561
01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:57.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never moving and we're good to,</v>

2562
01:59:57.081 --> 02:00:00.490
<v Speaker 2>in terms of the la sort of raising my</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids house like a,</v>

2563
02:00:00.620 --> 02:00:02.900
<v Speaker 2>we're in a great little place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

2564
02:00:03.290 --> 02:00:07.040
<v Speaker 2>I live in pasadena second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the wildlife in your yard.</v>

2565
02:00:07.050 --> 02:00:08.660
<v Speaker 2>You send me pictures of deer in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>yard.</v>

2566
02:00:08.670 --> 02:00:10.400
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's deer,</v>

2567
02:00:10.730 --> 02:00:14.840
<v Speaker 2>coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bobcats jumped out behind me the other</v>

2568
02:00:14.841 --> 02:00:15.770
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

2569
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:17.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was running as bears and in the past</v>

2570
02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:21.390
<v Speaker 2>dean happened to people's pools only in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the black neighborhooD.</v>

2571
02:00:22.410 --> 02:00:25.250
<v Speaker 2>So yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black bears too weird.</v>

2572
02:00:25.290 --> 02:00:27.770
<v Speaker 2>It totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what they.</v>

2573
02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:29.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2574
02:00:29.820 --> 02:00:31.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want,</v>

2575
02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:33.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to fly private.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to.</v>

2576
02:00:33.951 --> 02:00:36.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no aspirations.</v>

2577
02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:39.380
<v Speaker 2>I again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to live comfortably,</v>

2578
02:00:39.381 --> 02:00:44.381
<v Speaker 2>but once you fly in first class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult to go sit by the bathroom</v>

2579
02:00:44.721 --> 02:00:46.840
<v Speaker 2>in between two other people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2580
02:00:46.850 --> 02:00:50.480
<v Speaker 2>so there's certain luxuries that I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to afford.</v>

2581
02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:54.200
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to chill out,</v>

2582
02:00:54.230 --> 02:00:57.300
<v Speaker 2>hang out in the backyard and have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink with my wife and fucking have</v>

2583
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:59.750
<v Speaker 2>people over and barbecue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2584
02:01:00.170 --> 02:01:03.170
<v Speaker 2>That's all after you totally do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2585
02:01:03.171 --> 02:01:05.000
<v Speaker 2>that's very peaceful and that's a great</v>
<v Speaker 2>tHing.</v>

2586
02:01:05.060 --> 02:01:09.710
<v Speaker 2>And then also getting satisfaction out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of creating stuff and making stuff and</v>

2616
02:02:29.650 --> 02:02:33.920
<v Speaker 3>it's just a body of water where they</v>
<v Speaker 3>made me like a little pond.</v>

2617
02:02:33.921 --> 02:02:35.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then they go out,</v>

2618
02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:38.430
<v Speaker 3>they take trips to places that I'll go</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and go to,</v>

2619
02:02:38.431 --> 02:02:41.780
<v Speaker 3>go to sierra and I was in bozeman this</v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2622
02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:46.070
<v Speaker 3>we went by this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a place where all these people were fly</v>

2623
02:02:46.071 --> 02:02:48.560

<v Speaker 3>fish's face.</v>

2628
02:02:57.740 --> 02:03:00.120
<v Speaker 3>Then you'll let them back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is kind of fucked up.</v>

2629
02:03:00.121 --> 02:03:03.080
<v Speaker 3>My buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a daily show guy just went to Russia to</v>

<v Speaker 3>river right by it.</v>

2648
02:03:57.530 --> 02:04:02.530
<v Speaker 3>And I know that if I could mix it in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>proper amount of work and the proper</v>

2649
02:04:02.931 --> 02:04:05.120
<v Speaker 3>amount of just chilling out,</v>

2654
02:04:14.421 --> 02:04:19.421
<v Speaker 3>idea of relaxation and peace and quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but look at our constantly vacation</v>

2655
02:04:19.911 --> 02:04:22.250

<v Speaker 3>but meanwhile you're also planning on</v>

2656
02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:26.810
<v Speaker 3>doing a bunch of shows and being an</v>
<v Speaker 3>executive producer and a show runner and</v>

2657
02:04:26.811 --> 02:04:30.710
<v Speaker 3>a writer and a standup performer and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're actinG and.</v>

2658
02:04:31.420 --> 02:04:32.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a ton of shit going on and</v>

2659
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:37.800
<v Speaker 3>you're yelling at people yelling</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily talking about eventually</v>

2660
02:04:37.801 --> 02:04:38.100
<v Speaker 3>getting</v>

2661
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:41.880
<v Speaker 2>to a cognitive therapist and potentially</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting meditation.</v>

2662
02:04:42.090 --> 02:04:43.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just do it noW.</v>

2663
02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:44.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2664
02:04:44.491 --> 02:04:45.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2665
02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:46.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should have already done it like</v>

2666
02:04:46.621 --> 02:04:47.060
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2667
02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:48.570
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these things you should should've</v>

2668
02:04:48.571 --> 02:04:50.800
<v Speaker 2>already done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the problem with me.</v>

2669
02:04:50.801 --> 02:04:51.960
<v Speaker 2>He's money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2670
02:04:51.961 --> 02:04:55.830
<v Speaker 2>So the atc I don't do for anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have nothing but money in.</v>

2671
02:04:55.831 --> 02:04:58.860
<v Speaker 2>So that's not about money at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's starting like I started my</v>

2672
02:04:58.861 --> 02:05:02.070
<v Speaker 2>standup career eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll be great.</v>

2673
02:05:02.770 --> 02:05:03.603
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2674
02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:06.690
<v Speaker 2>it takes a lot of work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's just what is the idea behind</v>

2675
02:05:06.691 --> 02:05:07.500
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2676
02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:12.500
<v Speaker 2>So we things comedy by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is all things comedy is me and</v>

2677
02:05:13.381 --> 02:05:17.700
<v Speaker 2>bill came up with the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians should own and distribute all</v>

2678
02:05:17.701 --> 02:05:20.910
<v Speaker 2>of their own content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I first showed up in la,</v>

2679
02:05:22.630 --> 02:05:25.830
<v Speaker 2>worked on tv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So cheech from cheech and chong who told</v>

2680
02:05:25.831 --> 02:05:29.640
<v Speaker 2>me to do two things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be nice to every single person</v>

2681
02:05:29.641 --> 02:05:31.640
<v Speaker 2>you meet out in the public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2682
02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:34.590
<v Speaker 2>every busboy is going to have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher's an asshole story if you're</v>

2683
02:05:34.591 --> 02:05:34.950
<v Speaker 2>addicted.</v>

2684
02:05:34.950 --> 02:05:37.140
<v Speaker 2>Anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So try to be as nice to as many people</v>

2685
02:05:37.141 --> 02:05:39.420
<v Speaker 2>as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he goes,</v>

2686
02:05:39.421 --> 02:05:42.300
<v Speaker 2>also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to own every single piece of</v>

2687

<v Speaker 2>the albums.</v>

<v Speaker 2>we finally get the company and we take a</v>

02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:14.370
<v Speaker 2>ari shaffir,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dave anthony,</v>

2698
02:06:14.430 --> 02:06:15.420

<v Speaker 2>right direction.</v>

2700
02:06:20.401 --> 02:06:23.480
<v Speaker 2>So when new comic wants to come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us sort of go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>do we want this person on?</v>

2702
02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:27.900
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>john repin and tiana are going to start</v>

2703
02:06:27.901 --> 02:06:31.920

<v Speaker 2>talked to sarah and put them together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Felipe esparza,</v>

2705
02:06:34.890 --> 02:06:37.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw that no latinos are doing podcasts.</v>

2706
02:06:37.621 --> 02:06:41.430
<v Speaker 2>I know philippe's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And instead of like being all like to</v>

2707
02:06:41.431 --> 02:06:43.530
<v Speaker 2>the other latino comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all competitive,</v>

<v Speaker 2>everything like that.</v>

2711
02:06:52.261 --> 02:06:57.090

<v Speaker 2>company together that distributes our</v>

2712
02:06:57.091 --> 02:06:59.700

<v Speaker 3>going to sell it as an individual.</v>

2729
02:07:56.820 --> 02:07:58.120
<v Speaker 3>You did it a long time ago?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2730
02:07:58.121 --> 02:07:59.740
<v Speaker 3>we just shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was distance three.</v>

2731
02:07:59.741 --> 02:08:00.820
<v Speaker 3>Couple of months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weeks ago?</v>

2732
02:08:00.821 --> 02:08:01.720
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two weeks ago.</v>

2733
02:08:01.721 --> 02:08:02.710
<v Speaker 3>Three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not two weeks.</v>

2734
02:08:02.900 --> 02:08:03.790
<v Speaker 3>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four weeks ago.</v>

2735
02:08:04.450 --> 02:08:07.000
<v Speaker 3>And just haven't edited it or editing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

2736
02:08:07.050 --> 02:08:08.890
<v Speaker 3>They're just putting it together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you have like a,</v>

2737
02:08:08.910 --> 02:08:12.310
<v Speaker 3>a group of editors and stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we partner with this company called</v>

2738
02:08:12.311 --> 02:08:15.460
<v Speaker 3>soapbox films that has 15 editors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>animators,</v>

2739
02:08:15.461 --> 02:08:18.730
<v Speaker 3>all these people on staff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you come by you'll see that we</v>

2740
02:08:18.731 --> 02:08:21.280
<v Speaker 3>have two full stages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a green screen,</v>

2741
02:08:21.281 --> 02:08:24.130
<v Speaker 3>white cyc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if color corrections,</v>

2742
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:28.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sound mixing studios.</v>

2743
02:08:28.091 --> 02:08:33.091
<v Speaker 3>And then they gave us our podcast studio</v>
<v Speaker 3>to different offices and then other</v>

2744
02:08:34.151 --> 02:08:37.210
<v Speaker 3>meeting rooms as part of like an</v>
<v Speaker 3>investment in us.</v>

2745
02:08:37.720 --> 02:08:39.430
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

2746
02:08:39.940 --> 02:08:43.030
<v Speaker 3>but everybody owns everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have atc records that again,</v>

2747
02:08:43.031 --> 02:08:45.970
<v Speaker 3>I haven't had the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just staffing up right now because</v>

2748
02:08:45.971 --> 02:08:49.420
<v Speaker 3>we took on a little bit of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you took on money.</v>

2749
02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:50.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got an investor's.</v>

2750
02:08:50.521 --> 02:08:51.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got investors.</v>

2751
02:08:52.250 --> 02:08:55.360
<v Speaker 3>Did somebody get out and given us a</v>
<v Speaker 3>million bucks?</v>

2752
02:08:55.750 --> 02:08:56.583
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2753
02:08:56.770 --> 02:09:00.490
<v Speaker 3>So the idea behind it is you're kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>acting as a network.</v>

2754
02:09:00.550 --> 02:09:02.290
<v Speaker 3>We're going to turn into our own</v>
<v Speaker 3>network.</v>

2755
02:09:02.291 --> 02:09:07.291
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be like united artists and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when shows sell,</v>

2756
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:11.710
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be full transparency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When let's say something's burning goes</v>

2757
02:09:11.711 --> 02:09:16.711
<v Speaker 3>up and people start buying it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Burt just gonna look at his back end and</v>

2758
02:09:17.531 --> 02:09:19.000
<v Speaker 3>know exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2759
02:09:19.001 --> 02:09:21.520
<v Speaker 3>the money has to be recouped and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2760
02:09:22.210 --> 02:09:24.370
<v Speaker 3>the money is split.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

2761
02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:26.710
<v Speaker 3>He'll just get access.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like burt will own that if there's,</v>

2762
02:09:26.711 --> 02:09:31.711
<v Speaker 3>if there's a tv show that gets made out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that and it becomes popular and then</v>

2763
02:09:32.441 --> 02:09:35.430
<v Speaker 3>there's the idea behind it that there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>strength in numbers and yeah,</v>

2764
02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:37.510
<v Speaker 3>we all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all really help each other out too.</v>

2765
02:09:37.511 --> 02:09:38.800
<v Speaker 3>Like if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2766
02:09:38.801 --> 02:09:42.280
<v Speaker 3>I got this special coming out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's going to help me get behind</v>

2767
02:09:42.281 --> 02:09:42.370
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2768
02:09:42.370 --> 02:09:44.420
<v Speaker 3>When burt special comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody says,</v>

2769
02:09:44.460 --> 02:09:45.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes crazy.</v>

2770
02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:47.050
<v Speaker 3>We sort of do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

2771
02:09:47.051 --> 02:09:47.860
<v Speaker 3>We all do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

2772
02:09:47.860 --> 02:09:50.140
<v Speaker 3>that's the collection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like,</v>

2773
02:09:50.141 --> 02:09:55.141
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an association of comics working</v>

2774
02:09:56.621 --> 02:10:00.220
<v Speaker 3>together to promote each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so like if you guys have a podcast</v>

2775
02:10:00.221 --> 02:10:02.650
<v Speaker 3>on the all things comedy label,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone knows,</v>

2776
02:10:02.651 --> 02:10:06.610
<v Speaker 3>well this is going to be pretty high</v>
<v Speaker 3>quality because comedians are going to</v>

2777
02:10:06.611 --> 02:10:09.340
<v Speaker 3>be a better show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to reign that in a little</v>

2778
02:10:09.341 --> 02:10:13.270
<v Speaker 3>bit like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part we have a lot of</v>

2779
02:10:13.271 --> 02:10:17.080
<v Speaker 3>people contacting us and it's all</v>
<v Speaker 3>community of our peers.</v>

2780
02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:20.530
<v Speaker 3>We all really like and really enjoying</v>
<v Speaker 3>that or is that bringing you extra</v>

2781
02:10:20.531 --> 02:10:22.720
<v Speaker 3>stress?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It brings you a little extra stress</v>

2782
02:10:22.721 --> 02:10:25.390
<v Speaker 3>because they've put some money in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely something I'm looking</v>

2783
02:10:25.391 --> 02:10:28.300
<v Speaker 3>at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting to a point and empowering</v>

2784
02:10:28.301 --> 02:10:32.590
<v Speaker 3>other people that have some other comics</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming into help me work on creative</v>

2785
02:10:32.591 --> 02:10:34.160
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But is it making money</v>

2786
02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:35.620
<v Speaker 2>or is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2787
02:10:35.630 --> 02:10:37.490
<v Speaker 2>So we just um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2788
02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:39.500
<v Speaker 2>we haven't put out any of our tv shows</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

2789
02:10:39.501 --> 02:10:41.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean I hope to have tv shows on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>air.</v>

2790
02:10:41.421 --> 02:10:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Let's just like funny or die makes money</v>
<v Speaker 2>off of unbranded.</v>

2791
02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:50.920
<v Speaker 2>I got to have companies come to us and</v>
<v Speaker 2>want scripts written and I was able to</v>

2792
02:10:51.471 --> 02:10:56.471
<v Speaker 2>give gigs to guys I knew on a daily show</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they get paid like $45,000 to</v>

2793
02:10:56.871 --> 02:11:00.800
<v Speaker 2>write a script for a corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow.</v>

2794
02:11:00.890 --> 02:11:04.700
<v Speaker 2>And all those times you get gigs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we can serve as the agency for</v>

2795
02:11:04.701 --> 02:11:05.780
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can do,</v>

2796
02:11:05.870 --> 02:11:10.870
<v Speaker 2>I can match tom papa up with a company</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he can write their ad copy just to</v>

2797
02:11:12.411 --> 02:11:17.411
<v Speaker 2>bring him extra side money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we can do branded content</v>

2798
02:11:17.601 --> 02:11:19.280
<v Speaker 2>integrated marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all that shit.</v>

2799
02:11:19.281 --> 02:11:21.270
<v Speaker 2>And have the comedians on the company</v>
<v Speaker 2>that does that.</v>

2800
02:11:21.470 --> 02:11:23.840
<v Speaker 2>Comedians are responsible for so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking content.</v>

2801
02:11:24.350 --> 02:11:26.090
<v Speaker 2>It's books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tv shows,</v>

2802
02:11:26.091 --> 02:11:28.220
<v Speaker 2>it's movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like you're thinking about all</v>

2803
02:11:28.221 --> 02:11:31.520
<v Speaker 2>these comics are producing so much great</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2804
02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:36.280
<v Speaker 2>Then why shouldn't all the comics have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>company that distributes on it?</v>

2805
02:11:36.900 --> 02:11:38.340
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's interesting because there's a bunch</v>

2806
02:11:38.341 --> 02:11:40.620
<v Speaker 7>of groups that are coming along right</v>
<v Speaker 7>now that are trying to capitalize on</v>

2807
02:11:40.621 --> 02:11:42.210
<v Speaker 7>podcasting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And one of the things that's</v>

2808
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:45.540
<v Speaker 7>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had a conversation with a friend of</v>

2809
02:11:45.541 --> 02:11:50.541
<v Speaker 7>ours who's got a podcast and his agency</v>
<v Speaker 7>or his management company that suck now</v>

2810
02:11:51.481 --> 02:11:53.730
<v Speaker 7>are telling him they want a piece of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>podcast,</v>

2811
02:11:53.850 --> 02:11:56.460
<v Speaker 7>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And for the longest time they were</v>

2812
02:11:56.461 --> 02:12:00.090
<v Speaker 7>telling him he was wasting his time</v>
<v Speaker 7>doing a podcast and they were saying you</v>

2813
02:12:00.091 --> 02:12:03.690
<v Speaker 7>need to worry about like put,</v>
<v Speaker 7>getting a scripted show getting of this</v>

2814
02:12:03.691 --> 02:12:05.040
<v Speaker 7>and a dad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And he was like,</v>

2815
02:12:05.041 --> 02:12:07.560
<v Speaker 7>I really think that there's something in</v>
<v Speaker 7>podcasts.</v>

2816
02:12:07.650 --> 02:12:11.310
<v Speaker 7>So they.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They were negative and they were</v>

2817
02:12:11.311 --> 02:12:15.720
<v Speaker 7>criticizing his efforts and now they</v>
<v Speaker 7>want a piece of it and he's baffled and</v>

2818
02:12:15.721 --> 02:12:16.650
<v Speaker 7>he doesn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

2819
02:12:16.651 --> 02:12:17.880
<v Speaker 7>you got to leAve them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

2820
02:12:18.300 --> 02:12:19.980
<v Speaker 7>you gotta leave them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Absolutely not.</v>

2821
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:22.110
<v Speaker 7>They're not doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Before I even talk to me.</v>

2822
02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:24.780
<v Speaker 7>I could have just a thursday.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No</v>

2823
02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:25.980
<v Speaker 2>sense in you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing it.</v>

2824
02:12:25.981 --> 02:12:30.981
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is something just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>your standup career than you really</v>

2825
02:12:31.351 --> 02:12:33.120
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now because of the technology,</v>

2826
02:12:33.121 --> 02:12:37.110
<v Speaker 2>you don't need an intro to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment.</v>

2827
02:12:37.111 --> 02:12:40.530
<v Speaker 2>When you're a young standup comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need a management manager and an</v>

2828
02:12:40.531 --> 02:12:45.531
<v Speaker 2>agent to usher you into the established</v>
<v Speaker 2>group of decision makers.</v>

2829
02:12:48.030 --> 02:12:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're a podcaster and you're</v>

2830
02:12:50.221 --> 02:12:54.450
<v Speaker 2>podcast becomes popular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's you and a room and that microphone</v>

2831
02:12:54.451 --> 02:12:57.360
<v Speaker 2>and people did listen and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

2832
02:12:57.361 --> 02:12:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Because you're putting out a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>product,</v>

2833
02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:04.140
<v Speaker 2>you don't need somebody to tell you like</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's okay to do it or you're going to be</v>

2834
02:13:04.141 --> 02:13:07.620
<v Speaker 2>on this network like that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

2835
02:13:07.650 --> 02:13:10.860
<v Speaker 2>You can do it by yourself and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>another thing that I encourage all</v>

2836
02:13:10.861 --> 02:13:13.820
<v Speaker 2>people to do and this is a why am able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to like,</v>

2837
02:13:14.220 --> 02:13:17.250
<v Speaker 2>even though I am stressed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wake up in the middle of the night,</v>

2838
02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:19.570
<v Speaker 2>I usually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of contradictory shit</v>

2839
02:13:19.590 --> 02:13:21.660
<v Speaker 2>going on and I'm looking at vacation</v>
<v Speaker 2>homes.</v>

2840
02:13:22.050 --> 02:13:25.860
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love doing what I'm doing.</v>

2841
02:13:25.950 --> 02:13:27.540
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was great.</v>

2842
02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:30.150
<v Speaker 2>I love doing standup below the acting</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I just,</v>

2843
02:13:30.151 --> 02:13:33.420
<v Speaker 2>I love it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to follow your bliss,</v>

2844
02:13:33.421 --> 02:13:34.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to really,</v>

2845
02:13:34.561 --> 02:13:37.650
<v Speaker 2>I was fIring people and like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have to be up In the rain to</v>

2846
02:13:37.651 --> 02:13:41.190
<v Speaker 2>appreciate the sunshine sake?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where I was when I was working</v>

2847
02:13:41.191 --> 02:13:43.170
<v Speaker 2>for somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though that somebody else was my</v>

2848
02:13:43.171 --> 02:13:47.280
<v Speaker 2>parents and so I got down into standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like dry,</v>

2849
02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:49.320
<v Speaker 2>look at all this great shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked right.</v>

2850
02:13:49.321 --> 02:13:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Even writing jokes are free for tim</v>
<v Speaker 2>allen.</v>

2851
02:13:51.301 --> 02:13:52.740
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2852
02:13:53.210 --> 02:13:57.930
<v Speaker 2>I love doing all this stuff and so I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>really thrilled like the people that we</v>

2853
02:13:57.931 --> 02:14:02.310
<v Speaker 2>get to associate with and the people we</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to meet and what happens when you do</v>

2854
02:14:02.311 --> 02:14:04.650
<v Speaker 2>something you love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all just sort of comes together.</v>

2855
02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:10.040
<v Speaker 2>So I feel very fortunate that way that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to do all this shit and even though</v>

2856
02:14:10.081 --> 02:14:12.630
<v Speaker 2>I need to say no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to pare it down.</v>

2857
02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:14.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm still having a hard time.</v>

2858
02:14:14.250 --> 02:14:15.580
<v Speaker 7>Well it's good that you're having a</v>
<v Speaker 7>blast,</v>

2859
02:14:15.581 --> 02:14:18.490
<v Speaker 7>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my advice to you is just do all those</v>

2860
02:14:18.491 --> 02:14:21.070
<v Speaker 7>things that you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like especially do all those things as</v>

2861
02:14:21.071 --> 02:14:23.310
<v Speaker 7>far as like meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do all those things,</v>

2862
02:14:23.311 --> 02:14:26.230
<v Speaker 7>like whatever the cognitive therapy</v>
<v Speaker 7>issue that you have to deal with.</v>

2863
02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:27.400
<v Speaker 7>Just go do that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2864
02:14:27.640 --> 02:14:29.410
<v Speaker 7>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you talk about it too much.</v>

2865
02:14:29.530 --> 02:14:30.520
<v Speaker 7>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2866
02:14:30.521 --> 02:14:34.380
<v Speaker 7>Like you and I have had like 30</v>
<v Speaker 7>conversations about your temper,</v>

2867
02:14:34.780 --> 02:14:36.850
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>over like 10 years.</v>

2868
02:14:37.290 --> 02:14:42.290
<v Speaker 7>Like that's crazy and nothing's changed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's less because she got more and more</v>

2869
02:14:45.281 --> 02:14:46.120
<v Speaker 7>aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2870
02:14:46.121 --> 02:14:47.470
<v Speaker 7>I'm totally aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2871
02:14:47.930 --> 02:14:50.050
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've been so cool.</v>

2872
02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:55.300
<v Speaker 7>There has not been an incident in a</v>
<v Speaker 7>while except another night with steve</v>

2873
02:14:55.301 --> 02:14:56.200
<v Speaker 7>up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2874
02:14:56.201 --> 02:14:59.950
<v Speaker 7>that was a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was the other night we were talking</v>

2875
02:14:59.951 --> 02:15:01.600
<v Speaker 7>about the person that cut into applause</v>
<v Speaker 7>break.</v>

2876
02:15:02.410 --> 02:15:07.360
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Last week.</v>

2877
02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:12.340
<v Speaker 7>But it was just fucking reba</v>
<v Speaker 7>and again also,</v>

2878
02:15:12.341 --> 02:15:13.210
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it for a long time.</v>

2879
02:15:13.211 --> 02:15:16.780
<v Speaker 7>I'm not a in sync.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It gets also you caring about comedy.</v>

2880
02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:17.680
<v Speaker 7>It's terrible.</v>

2881
02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:21.410
<v Speaker 2>Really caring too much about comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's me being again,</v>

2882
02:15:21.740 --> 02:15:26.450
<v Speaker 2>sacrificing a lot to do what I'm doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then seeing other people are just</v>

2883
02:15:26.451 --> 02:15:29.330
<v Speaker 2>trying to fucking take advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2884
02:15:29.670 --> 02:15:32.160
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I love the idea of all things</v>

2885
02:15:32.161 --> 02:15:33.040
<v Speaker 7>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2886
02:15:33.300 --> 02:15:34.980
<v Speaker 7>but I don't want to do anything like</v>
<v Speaker 7>that myself,</v>

2887
02:15:34.990 --> 02:15:36.150
<v Speaker 7>which seems to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>god,</v>

2888
02:15:36.151 --> 02:15:38.940
<v Speaker 7>you're invested in yourself in a whole</v>
<v Speaker 7>bunch of other people's problems.</v>

2889
02:15:39.420 --> 02:15:42.120
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what I've kind of done is form a network</v>

2890
02:15:42.121 --> 02:15:45.570
<v Speaker 7>without having an actual network or all</v>
<v Speaker 7>the people that I'm friends with,</v>

2891
02:15:45.571 --> 02:15:50.100
<v Speaker 7>whether it's tom or joey or duncan,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I helped them.</v>

2892
02:15:50.220 --> 02:15:55.210
<v Speaker 7>I promote them just by just doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want any connection on.</v>

2893
02:15:55.370 --> 02:15:57.600
<v Speaker 7>I don't want any financial connection to</v>
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

2894
02:15:57.740 --> 02:15:59.210
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't even have a fucking contract.</v>

2895
02:15:59.260 --> 02:16:02.620
<v Speaker 7>My manager,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we've been together for so long like I</v>

2896
02:16:02.621 --> 02:16:05.430
<v Speaker 7>don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Our contract came up and I go,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Been with him since I was an open mic or</v>

2902
02:16:16.721 --> 02:16:17.840
<v Speaker 7>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not going anywhere else.</v>

2903
02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:21.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's also when we shot that a</v>

2904
02:16:22.170 --> 02:16:24.870
<v Speaker 2>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say read this bird thing again.</v>

2905
02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:26.580
<v Speaker 2>There's no contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

2906
02:16:26.610 --> 02:16:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Shake hands again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would die</v>

2907
02:16:30.670 --> 02:16:33.270
<v Speaker 3>before I fucked anybody overlay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really would die.</v>

2908
02:16:33.271 --> 02:16:37.000
<v Speaker 3>And so there's no contracts with us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're going to make to put</v>

2909
02:16:37.001 --> 02:16:40.390
<v Speaker 3>that out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's for free or whatever,</v>

2910
02:16:40.420 --> 02:16:42.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just we're going to start making shit.</v>

2911
02:16:42.761 --> 02:16:44.380
<v Speaker 3>And the most important thing is you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>having a good time.</v>

2912
02:16:44.500 --> 02:16:45.990
<v Speaker 3>Have a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>

2913
02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Stover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Laughing.</v>

2914
02:16:46.961 --> 02:16:48.330
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like.</v>

2915
02:16:48.580 --> 02:16:50.470
<v Speaker 3>It's not like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best part about this whole thing is</v>

2916
02:16:50.471 --> 02:16:52.300
<v Speaker 3>that you get a chance to hang out with</v>
<v Speaker 3>comics,</v>

2917
02:16:52.350 --> 02:16:55.630
<v Speaker 3>get a chance to have a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just in the more you do that,</v>

2918
02:16:55.690 --> 02:16:57.670
<v Speaker 3>the better stuff you put out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2919
02:16:57.820 --> 02:16:59.830
<v Speaker 3>the more you're in that vibe in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>group,</v>

2920
02:16:59.831 --> 02:17:01.460
<v Speaker 3>but humans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2921
02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:04.210
<v Speaker 3>just having a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're putting out those good vibes,</v>

2922
02:17:04.211 --> 02:17:07.150
<v Speaker 3>you're getting them back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's producing good stuff.</v>

2923
02:17:07.570 --> 02:17:10.120
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't stress enough to people</v>

2924
02:17:10.121 --> 02:17:15.121
<v Speaker 3>listening and just finding that thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you really liked to do and doing it</v>

2925
02:17:16.690 --> 02:17:18.340
<v Speaker 3>is so fucking important.</v>

2926
02:17:18.340 --> 02:17:21.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you really like something itching</v>

2927
02:17:21.071 --> 02:17:22.990
<v Speaker 3>at you because that's the thing with my</v>
<v Speaker 3>parents,</v>

2928
02:17:22.991 --> 02:17:25.420
<v Speaker 3>family business and even knowing I</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted,</v>

2929
02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:30.480
<v Speaker 3>I knew I wanted to be a standup comic</v>
<v Speaker 3>forever and it took me awhile to figure</v>

2930
02:17:30.971 --> 02:17:33.820
<v Speaker 3>it out and so that's why I come down</v>
<v Speaker 3>here and I'm racing around,</v>

2931
02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:36.760
<v Speaker 3>like really trying to cram it all in or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever's behind it.</v>

2932
02:17:37.180 --> 02:17:40.600
<v Speaker 3>But I just wish that's a regret.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do have.</v>

2933
02:17:40.601 --> 02:17:44.040
<v Speaker 3>I just started earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old were you when you started</v>

2934
02:17:44.050 --> 02:17:46.930
<v Speaker 3>telling?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell you I was 21.</v>

2935
02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:51.010
<v Speaker 3>That's one of those things though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean robert schimmel started when he</v>

2936
02:17:51.011 --> 02:17:53.470
<v Speaker 3>was 36.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Start whenever you start.</v>

2937
02:17:53.660 --> 02:17:54.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2938
02:17:54.450 --> 02:17:58.150
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think oftentimes whatever extra life</v>

2939
02:17:58.151 --> 02:18:02.500
<v Speaker 3>that you have before you start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably going to help you was when</v>

2940
02:18:02.501 --> 02:18:04.120
<v Speaker 3>I started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a baby,</v>

2941
02:18:04.490 --> 02:18:06.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know shit about life.</v>

2942
02:18:06.490 --> 02:18:08.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I did start I was doing sales and</v>

2943
02:18:08.561 --> 02:18:11.110
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that was cool and Met life,</v>

2944
02:18:11.830 --> 02:18:13.450
<v Speaker 3>met life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've hung out with life.</v>

2945
02:18:13.980 --> 02:18:16.570
<v Speaker 3>He'D been there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got down to nitty gritty.</v>

2946
02:18:16.900 --> 02:18:20.620
<v Speaker 3>I went and essentially like a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 3>years out of high school I became a</v>

2947
02:18:20.621 --> 02:18:21.850
<v Speaker 3>comic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2948
02:18:21.940 --> 02:18:25.700
<v Speaker 3>and I was out there doing the life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never done anything but they have a</v>

2949
02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:29.560
<v Speaker 3>bunch of shit along with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if there was ever a question,</v>

2950
02:18:29.561 --> 02:18:30.041
<v Speaker 3>someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2951
02:18:30.041 --> 02:18:32.170
<v Speaker 3>you have to quit everything except one</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2952
02:18:32.171 --> 02:18:33.170
<v Speaker 3>What's it going to be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2953
02:18:34.030 --> 02:18:35.890

<v Speaker 3>Stand up.</v>

2954

<v Speaker 3>because that's the thing.</v>

2957
02:18:40.661 --> 02:18:44.020
<v Speaker 3>As a standup comic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just always have this,</v>

2958
02:18:44.050 --> 02:18:48.280
<v Speaker 3>the skills to go out and earn a living</v>
<v Speaker 3>for all jay leno's faults.</v>

2959
02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:51.190
<v Speaker 3>He danced with some pretty great stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

2960
02:18:51.190 --> 02:18:56.190
<v Speaker 3>There's a book called comic insights by</v>
<v Speaker 3>franklin and gi where he used to teach</v>

2961
02:18:56.360 --> 02:18:58.930
<v Speaker 3>at ucla and if you go through as</v>
<v Speaker 3>interviews with richard,</v>

2962

<v Speaker 3>jenny and chris rock and jay leno and</v>
<v Speaker 3>jalen was says takes you seven years,</v>

2963
02:19:05.350 --> 02:19:08.170
<v Speaker 3>it's like a law degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes you seven years to get your law</v>

2964
02:19:08.171 --> 02:19:12.420
<v Speaker 3>degree and then it takes you another</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven years to be a good lawyer and then</v>

2965
02:19:12.430 --> 02:19:16.270
<v Speaker 3>it takes you seven years to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out who you are as a comic and</v>

2966
02:19:16.271 --> 02:19:18.580
<v Speaker 3>then another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another seven years to be a great comic.</v>

2967
02:19:18.581 --> 02:19:20.380
<v Speaker 3>So around your 14,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>

2968
02:19:20.381 --> 02:19:23.290
<v Speaker 3>you really started hitting your stride</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're great at it.</v>

2969
02:19:23.291 --> 02:19:25.770
<v Speaker 3>You're getting better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2970
02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:29.720
<v Speaker 3>to do that at around seven years he</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>

2971
02:19:30.010 --> 02:19:32.700
<v Speaker 3>started making a living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can start really,</v>

2972
02:19:32.701 --> 02:19:37.040
<v Speaker 3>you can quit your day job and really</v>
<v Speaker 3>start making a fine living for your</v>

2973
02:19:37.041 --> 02:19:40.670
<v Speaker 3>family because you're making a least</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 70 to 100 is a long time ago at 70</v>

2974
02:19:40.671 --> 02:19:41.504
<v Speaker 3>grand a year.</v>

2975
02:19:41.690 --> 02:19:42.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

2976
02:19:42.801 --> 02:19:44.540
<v Speaker 3>Living just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could live.</v>

2977
02:19:45.020 --> 02:19:49.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to a bunch of comics on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>road that just living in Indiana fucking</v>

2978
02:19:49.540 --> 02:19:53.780
<v Speaker 3>house costs $180,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A couple of kids.</v>

2979
02:19:53.930 --> 02:19:55.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally can be done.</v>

2980
02:19:55.740 --> 02:19:58.970
<v Speaker 3>Total question and it's certainly better</v>
<v Speaker 3>than doing something that you don't want</v>

2981
02:19:58.971 --> 02:19:59.810
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2982
02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:01.580
<v Speaker 3>For whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the people that are listening</v>

2983
02:20:01.581 --> 02:20:04.130
<v Speaker 3>to this and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is my thing?</v>

2984
02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:05.630
<v Speaker 3>It's gotta be something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2985
02:20:05.650 --> 02:20:08.300
<v Speaker 3>You've got to be something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be making canoes one of those.</v>

2986
02:20:08.340 --> 02:20:11.330
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so miserable doing that family</v>

2987
02:20:11.331 --> 02:20:13.940
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started doing stained glass.</v>

2988
02:20:14.210 --> 02:20:15.590
<v Speaker 3>Stained glass is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2989
02:20:15.950 --> 02:20:18.880
<v Speaker 3>My dad did it and then I started doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was looking for things.</v>

2990
02:20:18.881 --> 02:20:21.140
<v Speaker 3>I volunteered with the big brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big sisters.</v>

2991
02:20:21.530 --> 02:20:26.530
<v Speaker 3>I was just held there like really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is again where I single and had</v>

2992
02:20:26.661 --> 02:20:28.790
<v Speaker 3>the extra time to do anything.</v>

2993
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:32.780
<v Speaker 3>Like this is what I'm out and I was just</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking for it and then I knew when if I</v>

2994
02:20:32.781 --> 02:20:36.800
<v Speaker 3>turned 30 and I didn't try stand up</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it always had been itching at me</v>

2995
02:20:36.801 --> 02:20:38.630
<v Speaker 3>and people always told me I should do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2996
02:20:39.170 --> 02:20:41.180
<v Speaker 3>Then I would never be able to live with</v>
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>

2997
02:20:41.310 --> 02:20:44.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I forced myself to do it and even</v>

2998
02:20:44.151 --> 02:20:45.240
<v Speaker 3>though it was sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2999
02:20:45.260 --> 02:20:48.560
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this life is like this weird quick</v>

3000
02:20:48.620 --> 02:20:51.110
<v Speaker 3>blip and it seems long when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>young,</v>

3001
02:20:51.530 --> 02:20:54.950
<v Speaker 3>but as you get older now I'm pushing 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be 50 this year.</v>

3002
02:20:55.510 --> 02:20:58.970
<v Speaker 3>It just happens fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It happens very fast and if you're not</v>

3003
02:20:58.971 --> 02:21:01.790
<v Speaker 3>doing what you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a fun time.</v>

3004
02:21:02.030 --> 02:21:04.730
<v Speaker 3>It's not a good feeling and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all know that person.</v>

3005
02:21:04.731 --> 02:21:07.790
<v Speaker 3>We all know that one person that's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing what they want to do and it eats</v>

3006
02:21:07.791 --> 02:21:11.600
<v Speaker 3>away at them all the time instead of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that you know that are fulfilled,</v>

3007
02:21:11.630 --> 02:21:14.480
<v Speaker 3>that are doing things they enjoy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're working hard and they're</v>

3008
02:21:14.481 --> 02:21:16.640
<v Speaker 3>pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they get that good feeling out of</v>

3009
02:21:16.641 --> 02:21:16.730
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3010
02:21:16.730 --> 02:21:18.320
<v Speaker 3>They're actually pursuing what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>love.</v>

3011
02:21:18.321 --> 02:21:20.480
<v Speaker 3>They actually feel like they're making a</v>
<v Speaker 3>difference in their life.</v>

3012
02:21:20.481 --> 02:21:24.560
<v Speaker 3>They're actually creating something or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or accomplishing something.</v>

3013
02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:26.150
<v Speaker 3>That's what you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3014
02:21:26.151 --> 02:21:29.270
<v Speaker 3>that's the key to getting those good</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain chemicals,</v>

3015
02:21:29.271 --> 02:21:32.120
<v Speaker 3>those good feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having good people in your life.</v>

3016
02:21:32.121 --> 02:21:34.970
<v Speaker 3>Having good friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being kind to people,</v>

3017
02:21:35.300 --> 02:21:39.380
<v Speaker 3>enjoying your time in this life and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing that thing that is actually</v>

3018
02:21:39.381 --> 02:21:41.270
<v Speaker 3>interesting to your personality and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>

3019
02:21:41.450 --> 02:21:46.450
<v Speaker 3>So important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm taking a step away from work.</v>

3020
02:21:48.410 --> 02:21:49.910
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those deathbed lists.</v>

3021
02:21:49.911 --> 02:21:51.710
<v Speaker 3>You kind of look at these death bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>

3022
02:21:52.220 --> 02:21:53.053
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nope.</v>

3023
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:55.610
<v Speaker 3>Don't want to look at regret.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

3024
02:21:57.200 --> 02:21:59.000
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I work hard.</v>

3025
02:21:59.090 --> 02:22:02.210
<v Speaker 3>I know what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm no perfect person by any stretch of</v>

3026
02:22:02.211 --> 02:22:04.130
<v Speaker 3>the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't need to look at regret.</v>

3027
02:22:04.720 --> 02:22:05.151
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3028
02:22:05.151 --> 02:22:08.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm focused on tHat all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to focus on positive things.</v>

3029
02:22:08.301 --> 02:22:10.670
<v Speaker 3>I am absolutely aware of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>

3030
02:22:11.180 --> 02:22:11.601
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

3031
02:22:11.601 --> 02:22:13.340
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've contemplated it enough.</v>

3032
02:22:13.341 --> 02:22:16.070
<v Speaker 3>It's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you could spend enough time</v>

3033
02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:20.480
<v Speaker 3>focusing on negative shit like what</v>
<v Speaker 3>people should have done and it can fuck</v>

3034
02:22:20.481 --> 02:22:23.090
<v Speaker 3>with your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to look up when I'm</v>

3035
02:22:23.091 --> 02:22:25.740
<v Speaker 3>Seventy and go where?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

3036
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:27.210
<v Speaker 7>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You won't,</v>

3037
02:22:27.420 --> 02:22:30.990
<v Speaker 7>you won't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not gonna iF I died tomorrow,</v>

3038
02:22:30.991 --> 02:22:32.820
<v Speaker 7>wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm good.</v>

3039
02:22:33.320 --> 02:22:35.580
<v Speaker 7>You just kinda keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You just gotta keep enjoying it.</v>

3040
02:22:35.640 --> 02:22:37.530
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And who knows what this thing really</v>

3041
02:22:37.531 --> 02:22:40.200
<v Speaker 7>even is so weirdest thing about this</v>
<v Speaker 7>life.</v>

3042
02:22:40.230 --> 02:22:41.550
<v Speaker 7>It's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What is it?</v>

3043
02:22:41.830 --> 02:22:42.870
<v Speaker 7>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we,</v>

3044
02:22:42.900 --> 02:22:47.900
<v Speaker 7>we look at it in terms of this like a</v>
<v Speaker 7>sort of solidified structure of waking</v>

3045
02:22:48.241 --> 02:22:50.910
<v Speaker 7>up with the alarm clock,</v>
<v Speaker 7>getting your car driving to work.</v>

3046
02:22:50.940 --> 02:22:52.800
<v Speaker 7>Meanwhile the entire time this is going</v>
<v Speaker 7>on,</v>

3047
02:22:52.801 --> 02:22:57.450
<v Speaker 7>you're a finite life form on a planet in</v>
<v Speaker 7>an infinite universe.</v>

3048
02:22:57.451 --> 02:23:00.540
<v Speaker 7>I mean all of it is preposterous from</v>
<v Speaker 7>the beginning to the end.</v>

3049
02:23:00.570 --> 02:23:04.290
<v Speaker 7>All of it's ridiculous and the more you</v>
<v Speaker 7>look into it and the more you really</v>

3050
02:23:04.291 --> 02:23:09.291
<v Speaker 7>contemplate the absolute,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just massive scale of this universe that</v>

3051
02:23:11.851 --> 02:23:14.680
<v Speaker 7>we live in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the more it seems ridiculous and the,</v>

3052
02:23:14.681 --> 02:23:18.030
<v Speaker 7>the little things that are keeping you</v>
<v Speaker 7>up at night and waking up at 2:00 in the</v>

3053
02:23:18.031 --> 02:23:20.460
<v Speaker 7>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the ame zion insurance,</v>

3054
02:23:20.461 --> 02:23:21.294
<v Speaker 7>ridiculous.</v>

3055
02:23:21.450 --> 02:23:22.590
<v Speaker 7>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Shit.</v>

3056
02:23:22.650 --> 02:23:25.020
<v Speaker 7>Ridiculous shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just a matter of perspective.</v>

3057
02:23:25.170 --> 02:23:27.300
<v Speaker 7>But I think it's also a matter of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>human body.</v>

3058
02:23:27.610 --> 02:23:30.720
<v Speaker 7>I think the human body is designed to</v>
<v Speaker 7>have a certain amount of stress.</v>

3059
02:23:30.721 --> 02:23:33.840
<v Speaker 7>You certain amount of worries.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The reason why we survived is because we</v>

3060
02:23:33.850 --> 02:23:36.630
<v Speaker 7>worried about predators are invaders and</v>
<v Speaker 7>all these different things.</v>

3061
02:23:36.900 --> 02:23:40.390
<v Speaker 7>Those things don't exist anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so we give ourselves issues,</v>

3062
02:23:40.710 --> 02:23:45.710
<v Speaker 7>we give ourselves problems and I think</v>
<v Speaker 7>the way to mitigate that is to exercise</v>

3063
02:23:46.350 --> 02:23:48.990
<v Speaker 7>both in the sense of like a physical</v>
<v Speaker 7>sense,</v>

3064
02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:54.200
<v Speaker 7>but also like almost in like a demonic</v>
<v Speaker 7>extra cyst like get the exercise,</v>

3065
02:23:54.271 --> 02:23:57.900
<v Speaker 7>all that stress out of your body,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you're there.</v>

3066
02:23:57.901 --> 02:24:02.901
<v Speaker 7>Your body does not want to be like this</v>
<v Speaker 7>overflowing battery of stress and</v>

3067
02:24:03.841 --> 02:24:08.250
<v Speaker 7>tension and energy and when it is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it starts fucking with you to try to</v>

3068
02:24:08.251 --> 02:24:12.180
<v Speaker 7>give you pressure and stress and give</v>
<v Speaker 7>you like consequences for this,</v>

3069
02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:17.360
<v Speaker 7>for this anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just have this insatiable drive that</v>

3070
02:24:18.031 --> 02:24:23.031
<v Speaker 7>leads to that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A debilitating stress and anxiety that I</v>

3071
02:24:25.111 --> 02:24:28.320
<v Speaker 7>don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I think it's like what we're talking</v>

3072
02:24:28.321 --> 02:24:29.730
<v Speaker 7>about.</v>

<v Speaker 7>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't.</v>

<v Speaker 7>I just talked to a doctor about it for</v>

3075
02:24:34.351 --> 02:24:35.670
<v Speaker 7>the first time talking to the whole</v>
<v Speaker 7>world.</v>

3076
02:24:35.671 --> 02:24:36.504
<v Speaker 7>Then</v>

3077
02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:40.940
<v Speaker 2>5 million people are going to listen to</v>
<v Speaker 2>jesus christ.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's no perfect person and I,</v>

3084

3087
02:25:05.361 --> 02:25:06.530
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like talking to a complete</v>

<v Speaker 2>stranger about it and all you people</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's like I really am the fucking nicest</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

3096
02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:35.440
<v Speaker 3>I am a very nice dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But wHen pushed and pushed and pushed,</v>

3097
02:25:35.530 --> 02:25:40.530
<v Speaker 3>I fucking lose my mind.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It is a consequence of all your</v>

3101
02:25:50.711 --> 02:25:51.431
<v Speaker 3>ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 3>from.</v>

3103
02:25:52.811 --> 02:25:55.420
<v Speaker 3>It's a consequence of view and it's also</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why you've been so</v>

3104
02:25:55.421 --> 02:25:58.270
<v Speaker 3>successful that you're constantly</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing and making things happen and</v>

3105
02:25:58.271 --> 02:26:00.370
<v Speaker 3>getting things done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But occasionally you're going to spend</v>

3106
02:26:00.371 --> 02:26:01.990
<v Speaker 3>your wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to come back.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you because you are able to do those</v>
<v Speaker 3>things because you have,</v>

3129
02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:19.320
<v Speaker 3>Put it in a lot of time to that and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>mean you working on talk radio and then</v>

3130
02:27:21.431 --> 02:27:23.500
<v Speaker 3>working on his radio news radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

3131
02:27:23.630 --> 02:27:28.230
<v Speaker 3>Newsradio working on a fear factor for</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

3132
02:27:28.430 --> 02:27:29.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ufc.</v>

3133
02:27:29.570 --> 02:27:32.830
<v Speaker 3>I like the gin being a great comment</v>
<v Speaker 3>because led to this,</v>

3134
02:27:32.831 --> 02:27:37.540
<v Speaker 3>you were able to be independent and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fantastic.</v>

3135
02:27:37.630 --> 02:27:42.130
<v Speaker 3>I hope to get you definitely tend to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This fear factor thing taught me a lot</v>

3136
02:27:42.131 --> 02:27:45.430
<v Speaker 3>because it was an independent and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't like doing it and it was a great</v>

3137
02:27:45.431 --> 02:27:47.740
<v Speaker 3>job and it was a lot of money and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>would definitely do it again,</v>

3138
02:27:48.010 --> 02:27:51.130
<v Speaker 3>but it taught me the consequences of</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing something that you don't really</v>

3139
02:27:51.131 --> 02:27:51.700
<v Speaker 3>enjoy.</v>

3140
02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:53.800
<v Speaker 3>It's not pAt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a passion for.</v>

3141
02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:55.840
<v Speaker 3>I love the people I worked with and</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

3142
02:27:55.841 --> 02:27:57.700
<v Speaker 3>it was a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not complaining like,</v>

3143
02:27:57.820 --> 02:27:59.050
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>woe is me.</v>

3144
02:27:59.051 --> 02:28:02.290
<v Speaker 3>I had a tv gig that went 148 episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

3145
02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:04.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this crazy successful show,</v>

3146
02:28:04.781 --> 02:28:06.940
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't what I wanted it to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

3147
02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.100
<v Speaker 3>So while I was doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it made me realize like,</v>

3148
02:28:09.101 --> 02:28:10.990
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not the good feeling.</v>

3149
02:28:11.020 --> 02:28:13.300
<v Speaker 3>The good feeling is when you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>things you want to do,</v>

3150
02:28:13.570 --> 02:28:16.030
<v Speaker 3>so figure out a way to when this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>over,</v>

3151
02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:19.450
<v Speaker 3>never do this again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when fear factor was over,</v>

3152
02:28:19.570 --> 02:28:21.530
<v Speaker 3>of course I did it again when it came</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

3153
02:28:21.820 --> 02:28:23.270
<v Speaker 3>that they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they came uP,</v>

3154
02:28:23.271 --> 02:28:27.650
<v Speaker 3>they came with the money so hard to</v>
<v Speaker 3>start thinking I'm a squirrel that money</v>

3155
02:28:27.651 --> 02:28:28.910
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>

3156
02:28:29.060 --> 02:28:30.080
<v Speaker 3>it's only three days a week.</v>

3157
02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:31.790
<v Speaker 3>What's the big deal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You work four days,</v>

3173
02:29:17.931 --> 02:29:19.550

<v Speaker 3>those shows when news radio went to</v>

3176
02:29:25.430 --> 02:29:28.370
<v Speaker 3>syndication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but new news radio was never the kind of</v>

3177
02:29:28.430 --> 02:29:29.510
<v Speaker 3>commercial success.</v>

3178
02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:32.570
<v Speaker 3>And then these other shows where it</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually became a success in</v>

3179
02:29:32.571 --> 02:29:36.740
<v Speaker 3>syndication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When news radio was on television.</v>

3180
02:29:36.741 --> 02:29:38.840
<v Speaker 3>This was when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was not a lot of shows on tv by</v>

3181
02:29:38.841 --> 02:29:41.570
<v Speaker 3>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was one time where my friend lou</v>

3182
02:29:41.571 --> 02:29:42.740
<v Speaker 3>morton's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the writers,</v>

3183
02:29:42.741 --> 02:29:45.500
<v Speaker 3>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lou would wear a tee shirt that had the</v>

3184
02:29:45.501 --> 02:29:48.510
<v Speaker 3>number that we were ranked for the week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3185
02:29:48.560 --> 02:29:49.271
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like our,</v>

3186
02:29:49.271 --> 02:29:52.040
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our ratings and he came in with a number</v>

3187
02:29:52.041 --> 02:29:53.690
<v Speaker 3>88 on his shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>

3188
02:29:53.691 --> 02:29:55.460
<v Speaker 3>fuck dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where 88th,</v>

3189
02:29:55.461 --> 02:29:59.060
<v Speaker 3>he's like 88th,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like god down are we going to get</v>

3190
02:29:59.061 --> 02:30:02.030
<v Speaker 3>canceled?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only time we got cancels when I</v>

3191
02:30:02.031 --> 02:30:03.560
<v Speaker 3>didn't think we were going to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>canceled,</v>

3192
02:30:03.590 --> 02:30:06.590
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

3193
02:30:07.020 --> 02:30:10.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what my point was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no issue working on all these shows and</v>

3194
02:30:10.751 --> 02:30:13.100
<v Speaker 3>that you're not doing ideally what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>

3195
02:30:13.490 --> 02:30:15.160
<v Speaker 3>but then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a,</v>

3196
02:30:15.161 --> 02:30:17.750
<v Speaker 3>a wife and kids and the money's so good.</v>

3197
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:21.830
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking for the longest time they</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't want it to be like an ethnic lab</v>

3198
02:30:21.831 --> 02:30:26.760
<v Speaker 3>brand on it and one of those in cis</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows where I are,</v>

3199
02:30:26.770 --> 02:30:30.590
<v Speaker 3>the worst guy just comes to come in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cops come in and I go,</v>

3202
02:30:41.211 --> 02:30:43.240
<v Speaker 3>caruso.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to think of those shows where</v>

3203
02:30:43.250 --> 02:30:45.460
<v Speaker 3>they just kind of send it in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>every time you ever see that compilation</v>

3206
02:30:50.361 --> 02:30:54.470

<v Speaker 3>saying corny one liners and pulling off</v>

<v Speaker 3>do one of those shows,</v>

3209
02:30:59.870 --> 02:31:04.010
