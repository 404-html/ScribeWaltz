1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.320
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why feminism exists,</v>

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.980
<v Speaker 1>the only reason why it exists is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an imbalance.</v>

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.920
<v Speaker 1>If there wasn't an imbalanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wouldn't be this need to be</v>

4
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:13.400
<v Speaker 1>extreme towards that side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was like,</v>

5
00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:15.390
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if men were like really kind to women</v>

6
00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:17.310
<v Speaker 1>and there was no dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there would be,</v>

7
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>there would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be ridiculous to have feminism.</v>

8
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:22.590
<v Speaker 1>Nobody would believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why it can exist,</v>

9
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.460
<v Speaker 1>like whether you believe in a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they generalize or not,</v>

10
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in the generalizations.</v>

11
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>I believe there's a lot of good people</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there and I think as soon as you</v>

12
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>start lumping men and a general</v>
<v Speaker 1>categories,</v>

13
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>it's just like lumping women or anyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the general categories were too broad</v>

14
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:40.010
<v Speaker 1>in a spectrum is always an exception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything,</v>

15
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>but there's too many different variables</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to humans interacting with</v>

16
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:44.640
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially sexually.</v>

17
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.620
<v Speaker 1>But the only reason why feminism exists</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all is because there's something</v>

18
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:51.420
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was nothing wrong,</v>

19
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>if there was no women that were getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit on,</v>

20
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>if there was no sexual harassment in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>workplace,</v>

21
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.700
<v Speaker 1>if there was no discrimination when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to employment,</v>

22
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>if they're the don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of those things existed.</v>

23
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't make the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

24
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:05.790
<v Speaker 1>it's that simple that nobody would buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

25
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>The women wouldn't buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody would join.</v>

26
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

27
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Like every men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men treat women like they're themselves</v>

28
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:12.570
<v Speaker 1>living in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

29
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.210
<v Speaker 1>But that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you have,</v>

30
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the men's rights guys or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feminist,</v>

31
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>the reason why these groups exist is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because something's wrong.</v>

32
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>There's not a balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

33
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 1>And there's always going to be someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's out there on the far end of the</v>

34
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>seesaw trying to tip it one way or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

35
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.440
<v Speaker 1>but that they exist because something's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

36
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>The men's rights guys exists because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something going on.</v>

37
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot of guys do get fucked over</v>
<v Speaker 1>in divorce.</v>

38
00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it.</v>

39
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some brutal shit happened to</v>
<v Speaker 1>men in marriages.</v>

40
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:44.100
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some men that were targeted by</v>
<v Speaker 1>women who are just,</v>

41
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>there were financial assassins and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>went after men for their money and got</v>

42
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:50.760
<v Speaker 1>pregnant with these men for their money</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stole money from these man.</v>

43
00:01:50.761 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it happens.</v>

44
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.110
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it without this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The baby part I've seen,</v>

45
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people get fucked over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it happen many times.</v>

46
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.420
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that the men's rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys are right.</v>

47
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>When they say stupid shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like men get raped more than women,</v>

48
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.580
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>You fucking get raped by each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd dumped.</v>

50
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's such a dumb thing to say.</v>

51
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

52
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a disingenuous argument.</v>

53
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Are you really worried about being raped</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

54
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>cause I don't worry about it ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that took her to prison?</v>

55
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't worry about getting raped,</v>

56
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's never comes up.</v>

57
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm around UFC fighters all the</v>

58
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm around people who actually could</v>

59
00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>rape me and it doesn't really come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just went,</v>

60
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:31.800
<v Speaker 1>a guy says that if a guy was talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about divorce laws and the idea that you</v>

61
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:34.860
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone can actually target someone and</v>

62
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:37.530
<v Speaker 1>someone can extract money from them by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.370
<v Speaker 1>by basically a conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're conspiring to rip guys.</v>

64
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a gold digger is.</v>

65
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:45.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole profession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's songs about it.</v>

66
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a kind of a myth,</v>

67
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:51.390
<v Speaker 1>like a unicorn or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not what Coupa cobre it's a real</v>

68
00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a category and society,</v>

69
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.060
<v Speaker 1>gold diggers and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good either.</v>

70
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>But then there's the guys who fall for</v>
<v Speaker 1>those traps.</v>

71
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Where's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's natural selection.</v>

72
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:02.194
<v Speaker 1>You stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

73
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you not look at her and look at</v>

74
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>you and not know she's after your money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're disgusting,</v>

75
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.781
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

76
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 1>It's your personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

77
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 1>you're walking around with a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>$10,000 watch on driving a Ferrari and</v>

78
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>you wonder why women want you to pay for</v>
<v Speaker 1>their rent.</v>

79
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do.</v>

80
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I'm on both sides.</v>

81
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Both sides of the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how rocket.</v>

82
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to,</v>

83
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to bridge gaps here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to bring people together.</v>

84
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to let feminists and men's</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights advocates and everybody know that</v>

85
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 1>we're all just humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I see,</v>

86
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:34.630
<v Speaker 1>like I was watching this thing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>atheism plus,</v>

87
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know what a few of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them is in pluses.</v>

88
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 1>She's the people that wanted attach</v>
<v Speaker 1>atheism with core values,</v>

89
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 1>like against sexual harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racial discrimination.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and they had this really long verbose</v>

91
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:48.610
<v Speaker 1>speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my problem with that,</v>

92
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 1>when I was watching that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

<v Speaker 1>married,</v>

110
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't think that black people</v>

111
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>should have the same rate of pay as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>white person,</v>

112
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 1>you're an asshole.</v>

113
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.980
<v Speaker 1>If you don't think black people should</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in your neighborhood,</v>

114
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.540
<v Speaker 1>you're an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't.</v>

115
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.110
<v Speaker 1>It's all nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

116
00:04:39.111 --> 00:04:42.610

<v Speaker 1>has to be done.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and we can all live in each of the spots</v>

<v Speaker 1>we want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's put,</v>

143
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.160

<v Speaker 1>Not Louisiana is pretty cool.</v>

146
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 1>We should we give them North Dakota,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give him South Dakota.</v>

147
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 1>Nobody even goes there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't even Rhode Island moved to South</v>

<v Speaker 1>to love black people after nine months</v>
<v Speaker 1>of living with polar bears,</v>

154
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.450
