<v Speaker 1>like he would take care of on the road </v>

<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

36
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.330
<v Speaker 1>It was a joyless doorman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he made the comedy experience tents</v>

37
00:01:32.331 --> 00:01:34.160
<v Speaker 1>and miserable,</v>

39
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.190
<v Speaker 1>but he's one of those old staples of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy store,</v>

40
00:01:40.191 --> 00:01:42.260
<v Speaker 1>which is almost kind of weird not having</v>
<v Speaker 1>them around.</v>

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.130
<v Speaker 1>just have a smile show to people,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the guy who was sort of working or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything you needed from Julie </v>

00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:50.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever makes you happy.</v>

120
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:51.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about this.</v>

121
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

122
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.953
<v Speaker 1>I just loved the idea and I know you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a thought and you can go on </v>

123
00:04:58.571 --> 00:04:59.490
<v Speaker 1>that night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

124
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.410
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I imagined,</v>

125
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.340
<v Speaker 1>like an actor can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

126
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:04.174
<v Speaker 1>it's giant too because sometimes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought is funny to you right there in </v>

127
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:07.534
<v Speaker 1>that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why it's funny to you and you </v>

128
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:11.380
<v Speaker 1>might forget why it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next day it might have like a little</v>

129
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Napkin with something written down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:14.860
<v Speaker 1>a tampons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kleenex,</v>

131
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.810
<v Speaker 1>paper towels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

132
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:21.811
<v Speaker 1>I don't carry tampons anymore anymore </v>
<v Speaker 1>because my rectal bleeding and on when I</v>

133
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.633
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the way to go with </v>

134
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:26.290
<v Speaker 1>rectal bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's other options,</v>

135
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.313
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

136
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever get the colonoscopy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

137
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Colonoscopy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

138
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

139
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:35.560
<v Speaker 1>people ask saying something that goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>

140
00:05:35.561 --> 00:05:37.780
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think these college kids want to</v>

141
00:05:37.781 --> 00:05:39.230
<v Speaker 1>hear about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

142
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.370
<v Speaker 1>it's not the kind of subject I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring up,</v>

143
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's bad enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm older than them.</v>

144
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to bring up stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't happened to them yet.</v>

145
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stuff that they don't really.</v>

146
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.700
<v Speaker 1>They're never going to understand like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's.</v>

147
00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Hey kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what about Alzheimer's disease,</v>

148
00:05:50.831 --> 00:05:52.570

<v Speaker 1>Disease.</v>

149
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking.</v>

150
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.330
<v Speaker 1>I was telling them the power of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

153
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:03.194
<v Speaker 1>When I went to Australia doesn't not </v>
<v Speaker 1>even think of all these boys were there </v>

154
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 1>and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>busted my chops about not knowing.</v>

155
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:09.974
<v Speaker 1>How do you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did a thing about how much does the </v>

<v Speaker 1>gorilla way you were much closer than I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was and they were busted my balls about </v>

<v Speaker 1>not knowing him.</v>

158

<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

160
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 1>I got a buddy,</v>

161
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:26.144

<v Speaker 1>something online that can kill you from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hunting,</v>

180

<v Speaker 1>manual or than I am?</v>

182
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking about it that often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never.</v>

183
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:16.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do anything.</v>

184
00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:19.790
<v Speaker 1>To me it's like a big deal to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody drive me to vegas.</v>

185
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.900
<v Speaker 1>I feel like an adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it has anything to do with</v>

186
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:25.760
<v Speaker 1>being a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's the beautiful thing about </v>

196
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.980

<v Speaker 1>but I do like getting up,</v>

197
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.023
<v Speaker 1>open up the tent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking out and just seeing a mountain </v>

198
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.300
<v Speaker 1>filled with trees and hearing the birds </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chirp and put your boots on.</v>

214
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:53.400
<v Speaker 1>That was for a show that was for a show </v>
<v Speaker 1>called meat eater.</v>

215
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.850
<v Speaker 1>It's say it's a hunting show that my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend Steve Rinella has.</v>

216
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.580
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done that show three times,</v>

217
00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.260
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four times we've done that show for dms.</v>

218
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Does your wife and going on these trips </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

219
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.720
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she likes it and the meat is amazing,</v>

220
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come back with wild game hunting and </v>

221
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.600
<v Speaker 1>killing some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then eaten it,</v>

222
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.940
<v Speaker 1>so just eaten meat right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the chicken.</v>

223
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think of it as like a course</v>

224
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.533
<v Speaker 1>because it didn't kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then do you ever think of like </v>

225
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:24.564
<v Speaker 1>Salami as being part of an animal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me it's just this little thing that </v>

226
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:30.870
<v Speaker 1>runs around the cut its legs off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a sandwich.</v>

227
00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Well I think about it that way now I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it as meat,</v>

228
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.420
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always just thought about it.</v>

229
00:09:36.421 --> 00:09:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very convenient.</v>

230
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.650
<v Speaker 1>It's very convenient to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that way.</v>

231
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.320
<v Speaker 1>And you lose that convenience when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunt,</v>

232
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.730
<v Speaker 1>you get a weird connection with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>food that um,</v>

233
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.370
<v Speaker 1>some people just don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I understand that too,</v>

234
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.410
<v Speaker 1>that some people just wanna be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the grocery store,</v>

235
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.950
<v Speaker 1>pick up a little styrofoam container </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has a stake in it,</v>

236
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.910
<v Speaker 1>take it home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cook it,</v>

237
00:09:56.911 --> 00:09:58.290
<v Speaker 1>and they're good and they're fine with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

238
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.053
<v Speaker 1>That's fine too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've killed stuff and eating it </v>

239
00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:02.274
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've killed stuff and eating it in the </v>

240
00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:07.110
<v Speaker 1>woods or eating part of it obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you freeze it.</v>

241
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

242
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Bring it home and phrase it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you start this,</v>

243
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Joe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand 12,</v>

244
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:18.120
<v Speaker 1>so six years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More like five and a half.</v>

245
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.720
<v Speaker 1>And it was a a crossbow or what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>

246
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.870
<v Speaker 1>A compound bow looks like a regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>bulb.</v>

247
00:10:23.871 --> 00:10:24.704
<v Speaker 1>It has wheels at the top that are called</v>
<v Speaker 1>cams and then the cams when it turns </v>

248
00:10:29.281 --> 00:10:31.020
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives you the mechanical advantage.</v>

249
00:10:31.021 --> 00:10:33.640
<v Speaker 1>It makes them more powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

250
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.060
<v Speaker 1>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's intense.</v>

251
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.610
<v Speaker 1>I like to cross bows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

252
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:41.940
<v Speaker 1>those are good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really just like a shitty gun.</v>

253
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:43.043
<v Speaker 1>That's the crossbow is to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could just shooting a stick instead of </v>

254
00:10:45.571 --> 00:10:46.261
<v Speaker 1>like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

255
00:10:46.261 --> 00:10:49.570
<v Speaker 1>you can rest it and looked through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can put it on a rest.</v>

256
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Actually look through the scope and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>squeeze the trigger like a rifle.</v>

257
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not nearly as difficult as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular po.</v>

258
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever shoot an animal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hit it,</v>

259
00:10:57.721 --> 00:11:00.510
<v Speaker 1>and then it ran away?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

260
00:11:00.511 --> 00:11:02.970
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that on TV.</v>

261
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:04.830
<v Speaker 1>I did the mediator show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

262
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:09.360
<v Speaker 1>There was a problem with the rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rifle scope was off.</v>

263
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.553
<v Speaker 1>I'd fallen and the rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rifle scope was installed by one of </v>

264
00:11:13.891 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 1>the guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we got there,</v>

265
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.393
<v Speaker 1>we changed the scopes because there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sponsor of the company sponsor of the </v>

266
00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:21.414
<v Speaker 1>show rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they put a different rifle scope on </v>

267
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.400
<v Speaker 1>and a shot a deer with it and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>wounded and it was.</v>

268
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.290
<v Speaker 1>It didn't die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of suck.</v>

269
00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:29.370
<v Speaker 1>It was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

270
00:11:29.371 --> 00:11:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure it died within a couple of hours,</v>

271
00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:34.890
<v Speaker 1>but we couldn't get to it in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who couldn't find it?</v>

272
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.390
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather just hit it with a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

273
00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:42.390
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the problems were where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were in Wisconsin at nighttime.</v>

274
00:11:42.391 --> 00:11:43.920
<v Speaker 1>You gotta drive slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

275
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:44.803
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're darting out into the middle of </v>

276
00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:48.060
<v Speaker 1>the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when it's called.</v>

277
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:53.090
<v Speaker 1>The rut kicks in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Red is the deal to get one.</v>

278
00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.310
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

279
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They run,</v>

280
00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.700
<v Speaker 1>they run around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get fucking crazy.</v>

281
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.390
<v Speaker 1>They get so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll just walk right into traffic and</v>

282
00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:03.400
<v Speaker 1>just stare at cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll fuck anything.</v>

283
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's coming at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

284
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:11.050
<v Speaker 1>there's videos of Moose trying to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>bales of hay during the Rut,</v>

285
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:14.110
<v Speaker 1>like they literally lose their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea what's going on.</v>

286
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.520
<v Speaker 1>They were like nine feet are gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good size Mousse.</v>

287
00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Like a good size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadian Moose could be 1800 pounds.</v>

288
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

289
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.440
<v Speaker 1>You can't even imagine how.</v>

290
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's try one of those.</v>

291
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.860
<v Speaker 1>One of the other room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have Moose Burgers?</v>

292
00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

293
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten loose burgers series.</v>

294
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got some leftover.</v>

295
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a lot of elk burger.</v>

296
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.070
<v Speaker 1>That's an elk that big on the wall back </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

297
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.890
<v Speaker 1>They're delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good for you too.</v>

298
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:44.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like the best meat you can never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

299
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.670
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even look the same.</v>

300
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.010
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark red.</v>

301
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how a psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously like a logical,</v>

302
00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:51.163
<v Speaker 1>but it's certain meats like rabbit I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't eat and I don't know why because </v>

303
00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:56.770
<v Speaker 1>I'll eat chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really make sense.</v>

304
00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Are you a bugs bunny fan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

305
00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Big Hardcore hardcore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the tattoo.</v>

306
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to talk about it.</v>

307
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Can we talk about the slope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the airplane to best thing.</v>

308
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.410
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

309
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people get real attached to </v>

310
00:13:11.351 --> 00:13:12.760
<v Speaker 1>rabbits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but chickens are like,</v>

311
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.380
<v Speaker 1>they're heartless little dinosaurs.</v>

312
00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.710
<v Speaker 1>They're noisy and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

313
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

314
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.540
<v Speaker 1>chickens there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

315
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.990
<v Speaker 1>basically a lizard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lizard with feathers.</v>

316
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

317
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He pluck all that shit off and look at </v>

318
00:13:29.771 --> 00:13:30.191
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

319
00:13:30.191 --> 00:13:33.070
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a bird flying lizard?</v>

320
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Not a good looking animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they know whether or not Tara Dac.</v>

321
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:40.930
<v Speaker 1>I just found out from my seven year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Tara doctors are not dinosaurs.</v>

322
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:42.600
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

323
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.560
<v Speaker 1>She corrected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They came in a different period.</v>

324
00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:45.603
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She told me to not dinosaurs and we </v>

325
00:13:47.381 --> 00:13:49.270
<v Speaker 1>googled it and she was right when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

326
00:13:49.271 --> 00:13:51.550
<v Speaker 1>how am I so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I was thinking,</v>

327
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:53.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we always had those images,</v>

328
00:13:53.051 --> 00:13:55.030
<v Speaker 1>a Tara Dactyl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so where they were flying around,</v>

329
00:13:55.031 --> 00:13:56.590
<v Speaker 1>they had like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like wings,</v>

330
00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.300
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got Jamie,</v>

331
00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.980
<v Speaker 1>you got something for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it says.</v>

332
00:13:59.981 --> 00:14:01.480
<v Speaker 1>It says that they lived at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

333
00:14:01.481 --> 00:14:04.810
<v Speaker 1>but they're not actually dinosaur the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur technically.</v>

334
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somehow they are not actually dinosaurs.</v>

335
00:14:07.601 --> 00:14:08.434
<v Speaker 1>They were flying creatures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>paleontologist keep telling us the </v>

336
00:14:11.301 --> 00:14:13.150
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs are birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the dye,</v>

337
00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:14.350
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute,</v>

338
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:16.023
<v Speaker 1>the petro source,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't make any sense because </v>

339
00:14:17.621 --> 00:14:20.950
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs are birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so birds became dinosaurs,</v>

340
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:26.200
<v Speaker 1>but Tara dactyl who could fly or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs wasn't the bird.</v>

341
00:14:26.201 --> 00:14:29.410
<v Speaker 1>The the closest descendant of dinosaurs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

342
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not done in source.</v>

343
00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:33.250
<v Speaker 1>So what the hell are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>

344
00:14:33.251 --> 00:14:34.084
<v Speaker 1>like when they showed that image of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the skin for wings instead of a </v>

345
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.453
<v Speaker 1>bat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they know if that's </v>

346
00:14:40.751 --> 00:14:41.584
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's based on what </v>

347
00:14:45.071 --> 00:14:45.904
<v Speaker 1>they absolutely know or like what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think because they're starting to think </v>

348
00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:53.450
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of dinosaurs had feathers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is pretty recently I was in the</v>

349
00:14:53.451 --> 00:14:57.410
<v Speaker 1>museum in Bozeman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana.</v>

350
00:14:57.411 --> 00:14:58.244
<v Speaker 1>There's a museum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a natural history type museum and </v>

351
00:14:59.631 --> 00:15:03.980
<v Speaker 1>they have like a split image of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur,</v>

352
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:06.260
<v Speaker 1>like a raptor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's covered with feathers.</v>

353
00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

354
00:15:07.311 --> 00:15:08.144
<v Speaker 1>Because they think it's entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible that a lot of the dinosaurs </v>

355
00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:12.870
<v Speaker 1>were covered in feathers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know.</v>

356
00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Not as much fossilized remains of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

357
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Men never lived with dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Period.</v>

358
00:15:19.761 --> 00:15:20.594
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that until a couple of </v>

359
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:22.520
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really didn't know.</v>

360
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.593
<v Speaker 1>I thought cavemen Mino [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always show them like I always go </v>

361
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:27.410
<v Speaker 1>by the flintstones.</v>

362
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.550
<v Speaker 1>You really didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

363
00:15:31.551 --> 00:15:32.384
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're a real comic dom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you don't pay attention to shit </v>

364
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.980
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all in jokes like God,</v>

365
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:43.670
<v Speaker 1>I can do that decently well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had no skills.</v>

366
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.003
<v Speaker 1>I like to teach kids I liked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked teaching fourth grade and that </v>

367
00:15:47.511 --> 00:15:49.700
<v Speaker 1>was about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you like having fun?</v>

368
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.541
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you teach kids,</v>

369
00:15:50.541 --> 00:15:52.940
<v Speaker 1>don't teach them about dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you teach?</v>

370
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:54.303
<v Speaker 1>I paleontology everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I taught everything because it was </v>

371
00:15:56.721 --> 00:15:57.554
<v Speaker 1>Catholic school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I taught everything but the but the </v>

372
00:15:59.301 --> 00:16:00.134
<v Speaker 1>smart kids math because I was dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just stuck with the dumb kids and </v>

373
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.130
<v Speaker 1>split the class could come on and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>retards come with me.</v>

374
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Which he couldn't say no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

375
00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.880
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you get in serious trouble.</v>

376
00:16:10.881 --> 00:16:12.680
<v Speaker 1>You'd be on the front page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>USA Today.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I still have kids that get in touch with</v>

378
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:14.630
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

380
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.740
<v Speaker 1>They said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me feel so good that it was the</v>

381
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.680
<v Speaker 1>best year of their lives as far as going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to school because I really,</v>

388
00:16:42.051 --> 00:16:44.450
<v Speaker 1>tyrone done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like a baby James Brown.</v>

389
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.793
<v Speaker 1>He could do a split or complete split </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then then get his self up without </v>

390
00:16:50.331 --> 00:16:51.650
<v Speaker 1>touching anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like James Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

393
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

394
00:16:56.241 --> 00:16:57.074
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a kid and you're going to </v>

395
00:16:57.861 --> 00:17:01.190
<v Speaker 1>school like anyone who was any spark of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life is exciting.</v>

396
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.593
<v Speaker 1>I still to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about some of the teachers that I </v>

397
00:17:04.341 --> 00:17:05.174
<v Speaker 1>had in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had two really good teachers in high </v>

398
00:17:06.201 --> 00:17:07.250
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Lady,</v>

399
00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.273
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could remember her name and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who was a Spanish teacher that I'm </v>

400
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.640
<v Speaker 1>pretty sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

401
00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:19.660
<v Speaker 1>one of my friends who was a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she thanks for clearing that up.</v>

402
00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.560
<v Speaker 1>He was a young guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like 25 years old and she was hot</v>

403
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.293
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that they were like talking </v>

404
00:17:28.311 --> 00:17:29.360
<v Speaker 1>lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was 17.</v>

405
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:31.140
<v Speaker 1>He was 25.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure he fucked her.</v>

406
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.173
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost positive she was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually aggressive and she was at </v>

407
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.630
<v Speaker 1>advanced for her time both physically </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mentally.</v>

408
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:42.583
<v Speaker 1>Like she was one of those girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you knew she was not going to last </v>

409
00:17:45.051 --> 00:17:45.884
<v Speaker 1>in that town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's going to get the fuck out of </v>

410
00:17:46.581 --> 00:17:49.950
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I did this clean show at the,</v>

411
00:17:49.951 --> 00:17:52.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hotel in San Diego.</v>

412
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.120
<v Speaker 1>The uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was with some,</v>

413
00:17:54.121 --> 00:17:56.820
<v Speaker 1>like it hot was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a clean check del Coronado.</v>

414
00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a clean show,</v>

415
00:17:58.711 --> 00:18:00.720
<v Speaker 1>like an early show at 7:00 on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday.</v>

416
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:02.460
<v Speaker 1>They make you be clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

417
00:18:02.461 --> 00:18:04.460
<v Speaker 1>they can only make it be so clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point,</v>

418
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.040
<v Speaker 1>the thing I was getting at was a 15 year</v>
<v Speaker 1>old boys.</v>

419
00:18:08.041 --> 00:18:09.960
<v Speaker 1>They're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were with their parents.</v>

420
00:18:09.961 --> 00:18:11.670
<v Speaker 1>They could tell their parents for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little snooty,</v>

421
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.470
<v Speaker 1>so I said 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a great age and this,</v>

422
00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.650
<v Speaker 1>this is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This can be a dangerous thing to say.</v>

423
00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:18.720
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's great about being 15?</v>

424
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.500
<v Speaker 1>You can nail a 15 year old girl and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to jail for the rest of your life.</v>

425
00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.870
<v Speaker 1>And the kids were crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing,</v>

426
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:28.983
<v Speaker 1>and the parents were really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They looked like they wanted to pull </v>

427
00:18:30.521 --> 00:18:32.370
<v Speaker 1>them out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

428
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Parents don't want kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking hilarious.</v>

429
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Well up there both fists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

430
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.220

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

431
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.220
<v Speaker 1>the girl could get pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's no Bueno.</v>

432
00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.560
<v Speaker 1>But like the idea that going to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>them like,</v>

433
00:18:45.561 --> 00:18:46.820

<v Speaker 1>you stopped doing that thing.</v>

434
00:18:46.821 --> 00:18:51.821
<v Speaker 1>That feels better than anything ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do at school at work.</v>

435
00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:53.653
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your all of your cells in your body are </v>

436
00:18:56.541 --> 00:18:59.330
<v Speaker 1>compelling you in that direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't do it,</v>

437
00:18:59.331 --> 00:19:01.190
<v Speaker 1>but don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your whole body,</v>

438
00:19:01.191 --> 00:19:03.110
<v Speaker 1>your Dna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts are haunted.</v>

439

<v Speaker 1>Everything is wrapped around like ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>and legs and feet and miles and don't do</v>

440
00:19:13.071 --> 00:19:16.180
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time I worked up in</v>

441
00:19:16.181 --> 00:19:21.181
<v Speaker 1>my bedroom in philly and I came so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I thought I'll never have children.</v>

442
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.170
<v Speaker 1>I really did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I.</v>

443
00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.440
<v Speaker 1>I swear to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I emptied it.</v>

444
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Take train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just kept coming.</v>

445
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Float Gushes in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

446
00:19:33.741 --> 00:19:37.340
<v Speaker 1>How far you would shoot back then to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>distance was insane.</v>

447
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Knock your eye out from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We googled it and we think.</v>

448
00:19:40.551 --> 00:19:44.000
<v Speaker 1>I think if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the furthest that guy ever just was like</v>

449
00:19:44.001 --> 00:19:45.830
<v Speaker 1>29 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

450
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.310
<v Speaker 1>I can't even throw it that floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember making that search.</v>

451
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.090
<v Speaker 1>You blocked it out of your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your memory,</v>

452
00:19:53.091 --> 00:19:56.690
<v Speaker 1>like a childhood molestation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was this guy,</v>

453
00:19:56.691 --> 00:19:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Liddy Schultz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember crazy legs.</v>

454
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.700
<v Speaker 1>He used to do a bit of a jerk and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

455
00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:04.520
<v Speaker 1>I jerk off the midget and he would come </v>
<v Speaker 1>in here and then I went bad.</v>

456
00:20:04.521 --> 00:20:05.690
<v Speaker 1>It's come onto the crowd.</v>

457
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.920
<v Speaker 1>No crazy land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you say to that?</v>

458
00:20:09.921 --> 00:20:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

459
00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see you're writing.</v>

460
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:12.283
<v Speaker 1>Always writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to fucking walk on stage with a </v>

461
00:20:14.901 --> 00:20:18.290
<v Speaker 1>smokey the bear doll and he would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would hold the dollar up and say,</v>

462
00:20:18.291 --> 00:20:21.170
<v Speaker 1>only you can prevent forest fires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

463
00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:26.380
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck up and punches me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenny said you were crying,</v>

517
00:22:42.431 --> 00:22:47.320
<v Speaker 1>doing video games and then I'm thinking </v>

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:49.960
<v Speaker 1>And even some archery put me up against </v>

<v Speaker 1>And then shooting baskets because.</v>

524
00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Because it calls me old man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandpa and all this shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

530
00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.160
<v Speaker 1>he knows how to not be overexposed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

531
00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:19.400
<v Speaker 1>I've fucked that up in the past and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like when I get here,</v>

532
00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.460
<v Speaker 1>might get requests for interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

533
00:23:21.461 --> 00:23:23.830
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said I say too much already.</v>

534
00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:24.973
<v Speaker 1>I'm already talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice I never asked you again because </v>

535
00:23:27.371 --> 00:23:29.410
<v Speaker 1>he did me the favor and I don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>push it,</v>

536
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.740
<v Speaker 1>but the fact is we had Jamie to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>around with that time.</v>

537
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:33.521
<v Speaker 1>So No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will,</v>

538
00:23:33.521 --> 00:23:34.354
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to really nail you on an </v>

539
00:23:35.771 --> 00:23:36.700
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make you.</v>

540
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.080
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean on your pod?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

541
00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.250
<v Speaker 1>that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do friends podcasts at the time,</v>

542
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like interviews and real show,</v>

543
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:48.020
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you got nothing to gain Joe.</v>

544
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.570
<v Speaker 1>You're famous enough in Daniel's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

545
00:23:50.571 --> 00:23:51.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

546
00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:52.630
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to get good out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

547
00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Like doing Jimmy Kimmel doing five </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

548
00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:57.483
<v Speaker 1>You probably wouldn't want to do to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up even though that your favorite </v>

549
00:23:59.151 --> 00:24:02.660
<v Speaker 1>thing and then you go over to the panel </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

550
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.360
<v Speaker 1>I like Craig Ferguson only because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was improv.</v>

551
00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:06.381
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

552
00:24:06.381 --> 00:24:07.340
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

553
00:24:07.341 --> 00:24:11.180
<v Speaker 1>I think that sitting down and talking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone should be like this.</v>

554
00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.230
<v Speaker 1>You really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

555
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:13.560
<v Speaker 1>really want to get to know somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

556
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.133
<v Speaker 1>She talked to him like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have I have a real conversation with </v>

557
00:24:16.581 --> 00:24:17.414
<v Speaker 1>them having a conversation with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're under the gun of five </v>

558
00:24:20.601 --> 00:24:21.434
<v Speaker 1>minutes and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a band there and you're sitting </v>

559
00:24:23.271 --> 00:24:26.470
<v Speaker 1>sideways and you're at the desk and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting over like this and you know,</v>

560
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.640
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about some project that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing.</v>

561
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.330
<v Speaker 1>He eats like a quick pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have like a quick story that you can</v>

562
00:24:32.331 --> 00:24:34.430
<v Speaker 1>tell.</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

649
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:16.400
<v Speaker 1>psychological and philosophical turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he's,</v>

650
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.133
<v Speaker 1>he's just thought about life and things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he must've had some psychedelic </v>

<v Speaker 1>experiences too.</v>

<v Speaker 1>matters and what doesn't matter and you </v>

707
00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.290
<v Speaker 1>I watched one episode and I thought it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was pretty good,</v>

708
00:30:41.291 --> 00:30:44.140
<v Speaker 1>but I heard that it got better.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

711

<v Speaker 1>you know all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember Seinfeld at the </v>

712
00:30:49.831 --> 00:30:51.430
<v Speaker 1>beginning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember news radio.</v>

713
00:30:51.431 --> 00:30:52.264
<v Speaker 1>The show I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

714
00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.000
<v Speaker 1>it was clunky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took a while to really get rolling.</v>

715
00:30:55.001 --> 00:30:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To get the rhythm.</v>

716
00:30:55.901 --> 00:30:58.420
<v Speaker 1>What it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitcoms are very difficult.</v>

717
00:30:58.780 --> 00:30:59.590
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

718
00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:00.850
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

719
00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:02.690
<v Speaker 1>bonds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are any good sitcoms in the air.</v>

720
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:03.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>

721
00:31:03.731 --> 00:31:04.840
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

722
00:31:04.841 --> 00:31:05.674
<v Speaker 1>this is the serious one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm kind of the comic relief on </v>

723
00:31:08.201 --> 00:31:11.020
<v Speaker 1>this because it's about like comedians </v>
<v Speaker 1>but not like,</v>

724
00:31:11.021 --> 00:31:11.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we goof around,</v>

725
00:31:11.981 --> 00:31:15.570

<v Speaker 1>hardly any of that.</v>

726
00:31:15.571 --> 00:31:19.600
<v Speaker 1>And you see them more like jealous of </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and they're still in the dark</v>

727
00:31:19.601 --> 00:31:20.434
<v Speaker 1>side of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The woman who plays the Mitzi part is </v>

728
00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:23.673
<v Speaker 1>Melissa Leo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's an academy award for some boxing </v>

731
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:34.230
<v Speaker 1>she's playing Mitzi really serious and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to say anything because she's</v>

732
00:31:34.301 --> 00:31:38.950
<v Speaker 1>a great actress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I were a to give one note,</v>

733
00:31:38.951 --> 00:31:39.784
<v Speaker 1>I would say they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mitzi really had a fun side to her </v>

<v Speaker 1>do things in the shower,</v>

813
00:35:21.231 --> 00:35:22.064
<v Speaker 1>like jump up and down in the shower and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow box and the shower with the hot </v>

814
00:35:25.791 --> 00:35:27.410
<v Speaker 1>water on and try to sweat out weight.</v>

815
00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.753
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't eat for like a whole day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I would fight that day and it was </v>

816
00:35:31.731 --> 00:35:33.590
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that for one year.</v>

817
00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:37.440
<v Speaker 1>Well my father was a professional boxer </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

818
00:35:37.441 --> 00:35:39.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was the bad thing about it.</v>

819
00:35:39.301 --> 00:35:43.560
<v Speaker 1>He was a $500 bucks or oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>box 500 and baseball.</v>

820
00:35:43.561 --> 00:35:45.510
<v Speaker 1>You the greatest player ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but boxing you,</v>

821
00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.180
<v Speaker 1>you got to be like 800,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

822
00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:50.220
<v Speaker 1>at least make a living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he won,</v>

823
00:35:50.221 --> 00:35:54.030
<v Speaker 1>he would come home and beaten up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That must have been hard to see.</v>

824
00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:56.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

825
00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:58.913
<v Speaker 1>I see people that fight in the UFC and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their kids come to hug him in the cage </v>

826
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.093
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the terrified look in their </v>

827
00:36:06.481 --> 00:36:07.314
<v Speaker 1>children's face and they're looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy's eyes all fucked up and got </v>

828
00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:17.520
<v Speaker 1>some different group or different type </v>
<v Speaker 1>of human being that does that.</v>

829
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.353
<v Speaker 1>I had so much fun though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The time you invited me to the one in </v>

830
00:36:20.461 --> 00:36:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Montreal where the guy who's the king of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montreal was George St Pierre.</v>

831
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.593
<v Speaker 1>That was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the loudest noise of cheers I've </v>

832
00:36:26.701 --> 00:36:28.140
<v Speaker 1>ever heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love him.</v>

833
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:29.483
<v Speaker 1>And the other one was when we went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the places that were those guys who own </v>

834
00:36:33.721 --> 00:36:35.340
<v Speaker 1>the Sacramento Kings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

835
00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:39.500
<v Speaker 1>the plate with the playboy club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you had fights there.</v>

836
00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:41.730
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm talking about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's off the strip.</v>

837
00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.830
<v Speaker 1>The Palms?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

838
00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the cool moments,</v>

839
00:36:45.801 --> 00:36:48.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean even though he realized how </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful and how real it is,</v>

840
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.430
<v Speaker 1>this kid got knocked down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting next to his mother and his</v>

841
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:53.603
<v Speaker 1>wife and he wouldn't wake up for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple minutes and then he finally got </v>

842
00:36:56.791 --> 00:36:57.624
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there was another kid who was </v>

843
00:36:59.041 --> 00:36:59.874
<v Speaker 1>like in the cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ran up the wall and I don't know how </v>

844
00:37:02.851 --> 00:37:05.520
<v Speaker 1>the fuck he did it and he just is young </v>
<v Speaker 1>black kid.</v>

845
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.490
<v Speaker 1>He ran up the wall and went upside down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then landed on his feet.</v>

846
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:09.691
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

847
00:37:09.691 --> 00:37:14.670
<v Speaker 1>John Dodson is pretty sure it was young </v>
<v Speaker 1>males that after fights he runs up.</v>

848
00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a freak.</v>

849
00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Awesome athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

850
00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:20.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a different kinds of human being </v>

851
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:27.920
<v Speaker 1>that does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to be in that world that's a.</v>

852
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:33.210
<v Speaker 1>that's a pool to send an intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

853
00:37:33.211 --> 00:37:36.020
<v Speaker 1>That's unlike very many other this in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this war.</v>

854
00:37:36.021 --> 00:37:37.280
<v Speaker 1>Other than war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

855
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:40.200
<v Speaker 1>war is probably the most intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

856
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Guys who are warriors?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actual soldiers.</v>

857
00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.573
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think mma fighters and then obviously </v>

858
00:37:47.071 --> 00:37:48.880
<v Speaker 1>first responders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>firefighters,</v>

859
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:49.920
<v Speaker 1>cops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things on those.</v>

860
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:50.783
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about that with those </v>

861
00:37:52.141 --> 00:37:53.820
<v Speaker 1>fires this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

862
00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:54.803
<v Speaker 1>My Body's a firefighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was up there and now he's in Simi </v>

863
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:00.443
<v Speaker 1>Valley and they shipped him out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else and he tell me it was </v>

864
00:38:03.271 --> 00:38:04.230
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

865
00:38:04.231 --> 00:38:05.400
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

866
00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:08.910
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't stop the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just too big and there,</v>

867
00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:12.090
<v Speaker 1>you know that thousands of firefighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the other thing,</v>

868
00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.240
<v Speaker 1>not just thousands of firefighters but </v>
<v Speaker 1>prisoners really.</v>

869
00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.850
<v Speaker 1>They had prisoners working the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could get out early,</v>

870
00:38:17.851 --> 00:38:19.110
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

871
00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:21.420
<v Speaker 1>I think they got paid and I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>they got paid much.</v>

872
00:38:21.421 --> 00:38:23.160
<v Speaker 1>I think the unpaid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a dollar an hour,</v>

873
00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:26.640
<v Speaker 1>something fucked up and they're out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there working on the fires.</v>

874
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.540
<v Speaker 1>I'll just pretend I got burned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just run into the fire.</v>

875
00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm free.</v>

876
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.150
<v Speaker 1>I got a fake Id.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to Mexico.</v>

877
00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

878
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:41.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the most fucked up</v>

879
00:38:41.501 --> 00:38:42.334
<v Speaker 1>things about prison is that they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to work and they pay them like </v>

880
00:38:45.071 --> 00:38:46.690
<v Speaker 1>pennies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

881
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:49.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they get them to clean up or even</v>

882
00:38:49.241 --> 00:38:52.120
<v Speaker 1>if you have a dui you can get that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that won't even go into prison.</v>

883
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

884
00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.191
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

885
00:38:54.191 --> 00:38:56.140
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you can work it off or pay it off,</v>

886
00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:59.740
<v Speaker 1>clean the sides of roads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine did that instead of.</v>

887
00:38:59.741 --> 00:39:02.080
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much is the money to Pay Dui?</v>

888
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:04.720

891
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they really pay a dollar an hour.</v>

892

<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

907
00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Are you talking about filming a special?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

908
00:39:54.371 --> 00:39:55.204
<v Speaker 1>I did one last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on the show you told me I should </v>

909
00:39:56.981 --> 00:39:58.660
<v Speaker 1>do when I did it and I just didn't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

910
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did you do it?</v>

911
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:02.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

912
00:40:02.071 --> 00:40:02.904
<v Speaker 1>The last time I was on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a year ago I would imagine a </v>

913
00:40:05.741 --> 00:40:06.574
<v Speaker 1>little more.</v>

914
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.640
<v Speaker 1>And then I waited about three months and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shot it.</v>

915
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:11.980
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just said not to release it?</v>

916
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was wrong with it?</v>

917
00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Like what didn't feel good about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

918
00:40:15.851 --> 00:40:20.851
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't my ass look fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't like it.</v>

919
00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:21.933
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't seem to have the energy I </v>

920
00:40:23.651 --> 00:40:25.750
<v Speaker 1>thought I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it didn't feel to you like </v>

922
00:40:28.811 --> 00:40:30.850
<v Speaker 1>representative of a real set that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have?</v>

923
00:40:30.851 --> 00:40:33.490
<v Speaker 1>I got a just a normal night at a club.</v>

924
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.353
<v Speaker 1>Did you feel pressure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's one of the things that I </v>

925
00:40:36.551 --> 00:40:37.384
<v Speaker 1>feel that I've always battle when I do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>special is that like here's the moment </v>

<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>

927
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.810
<v Speaker 1>And one of the best ways I found to </v>
<v Speaker 1>combat that I was to do a bunch of shows</v>

928
00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:47.740
<v Speaker 1>I do for chefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

929
00:40:47.741 --> 00:40:48.310
<v Speaker 1>that's smart.</v>

930
00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:49.600
<v Speaker 1>I did two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

931
00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.670
<v Speaker 1>two is tight and they were back to back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

932
00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people clam up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people do one and it becomes a</v>

933
00:40:56.801 --> 00:40:57.634
<v Speaker 1>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could feel the tightness on stage </v>

934
00:40:59.831 --> 00:41:03.190
<v Speaker 1>because there's so much riding on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just not just a regular show.</v>

935
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:07.870
<v Speaker 1>There's no room really to fuck around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to have room to fuck around.</v>

936
00:41:07.871 --> 00:41:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Like part of what a live show is is </v>
<v Speaker 1>flowing.</v>

937
00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:14.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would like to get myself in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>club where I'm half once,</v>

938
00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:15.813
<v Speaker 1>like if something's worth talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the audience member or something </v>

939
00:41:19.451 --> 00:41:21.340
<v Speaker 1>that's really cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do it.</v>

940
00:41:21.341 --> 00:41:22.174
<v Speaker 1>But just being normal club set that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little more normal but very strong club </v>

941
00:41:26.291 --> 00:41:28.270
<v Speaker 1>set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did you film a.</v>

942
00:41:28.271 --> 00:41:31.840
<v Speaker 1>The laugh factory in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

943
00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:32.801
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember that.</v>

944
00:41:32.801 --> 00:41:33.634
<v Speaker 1>So you still laugh factory in Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a comfortable club for you and </v>

945
00:41:36.381 --> 00:41:37.790
<v Speaker 1>they already set up for filming.</v>

946
00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

947
00:41:38.751 --> 00:41:40.280
<v Speaker 1>I could do it any night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

948
00:41:40.281 --> 00:41:41.114
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Jamie one that had taped me like a </v>

949
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:46.790
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks in a row doing like 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

950
00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:48.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should,</v>

951
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:50.330
<v Speaker 1>that's a great place to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dom,</v>

952
00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:53.070
<v Speaker 1>because they filmed me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you like it or not there.</v>

953
00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we talked about this.</v>

954
00:41:55.281 --> 00:41:58.910
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good sign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do have the setup.</v>

955
00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:02.090
<v Speaker 1>They have the setup to film you there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegas Room is nice,</v>

956
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:03.690
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

957
00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:05.010
<v Speaker 1>is that a trap?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

958
00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing that's great about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegas,</v>

959
00:42:06.651 --> 00:42:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you could do that.</v>

960
00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.433
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing the first week of April.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the trop dental do Brad Garret </v>

961
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:15.920
<v Speaker 1>club too because they don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Vegas.</v>

962
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like Columbus,</v>

963
00:42:17.931 --> 00:42:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the same audience pretty much,</v>

964
00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.580
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

965
00:42:22.581 --> 00:42:24.950
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the audience comes in from far</v>

966
00:42:24.951 --> 00:42:25.880
<v Speaker 1>away every week.</v>

967
00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:29.030
<v Speaker 1>So you could play Vegas a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is true.</v>

968
00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Like that's one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 1>residency works in Vegas.</v>

969
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:33.063
<v Speaker 1>Always anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever thought about doing that </v>

970
00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:36.530
<v Speaker 1>residency?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

971
00:42:36.531 --> 00:42:39.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I killed myself in Vegas.</v>

972
00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:40.993
<v Speaker 1>Just boozing and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out and the rhino at three in </v>

973
00:42:43.791 --> 00:42:45.850
<v Speaker 1>the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fistfuls of dollars.</v>

974
00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:46.690
<v Speaker 1>Dat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dat,</v>

975
00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Dat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dat type.</v>

976
00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:53.560
<v Speaker 1>I go out with this girl and she got </v>
<v Speaker 1>really hot daughters right when she shot</v>

977
00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:55.700
<v Speaker 1>the girl you're dating and she's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>hot,</v>

978
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:57.740
<v Speaker 1>but she's always telling me how </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful her daughters or I go,</v>

979
00:42:57.741 --> 00:42:58.491
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

980
00:42:58.491 --> 00:43:00.890
<v Speaker 1>but I don't watch step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop pimping off your daughters to me.</v>

981
00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:04.600
<v Speaker 1>But I took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took him to see tosh.</v>

982
00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:09.610
<v Speaker 1>I was in the town for the superbowl and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel was at the mirage and it gets,</v>

983
00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:15.260
<v Speaker 1>I forget how big a deal it would be to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>16 year old boy to meet him.</v>

984
00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:18.080
<v Speaker 1>And we went back and he was saying he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was so gracious with them,</v>

985
00:43:18.081 --> 00:43:18.914
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe it because this kid </v>

986
00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:23.690
<v Speaker 1>played John Lennon in loves it when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a little kid.</v>

987
00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:26.000
<v Speaker 1>So he's got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been around theatrical people,</v>

988
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:27.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love the Beatles.</v>

989
00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:31.010
<v Speaker 1>That needles thing is fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good at the Mirage.</v>

990
00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:31.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

991
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.983
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started that acapella because it </v>

992
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:38.150
<v Speaker 1>was very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're a huge Beatles fan.</v>

993
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've always been a big beatles fan.</v>

994
00:43:40.221 --> 00:43:41.054
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took my family to see that about a </v>

995
00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:46.460
<v Speaker 1>month ago or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to see that the Mirage.</v>

996
00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

997
00:43:47.931 --> 00:43:51.350
<v Speaker 1>It's such a showman and it cool to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>your kids kind of digging it.</v>

998
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get all those years ago.</v>

999
00:43:53.091 --> 00:43:53.924
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know so many little kids that liked </v>

1000
00:43:56.271 --> 00:43:57.590
<v Speaker 1>the Beatles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

1001
00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:00.860
<v Speaker 1>They're so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were so good and you.</v>

1002
00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:01.903
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's hard for someone today </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2018 with this vast variety of music </v>

1003
00:44:07.371 --> 00:44:10.460
<v Speaker 1>that we have and so much good music over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of music,</v>

1004
00:44:10.461 --> 00:44:11.294
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much recording that it's hard to </v>

1005
00:44:13.491 --> 00:44:18.410
<v Speaker 1>understand how in the 19 sixties how </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing the Beatles were.</v>

1006
00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:20.013
<v Speaker 1>Then out of nowhere this band out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Liverpool comes out and they just have </v>

1007
00:44:23.991 --> 00:44:28.820
<v Speaker 1>this revolutionary music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so much of it is so different.</v>

1008
00:44:28.821 --> 00:44:29.654
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very different and they were the </v>

1009
00:44:30.531 --> 00:44:34.440
<v Speaker 1>ones they orchestras and all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1010
00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:36.420
<v Speaker 1>it reminds me of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1011
00:44:36.421 --> 00:44:39.330
<v Speaker 1>the thing we were talking about before </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the sitcoms.</v>

1012
00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:44.010
<v Speaker 1>They were given a chance to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people today,</v>

1013
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.410
<v Speaker 1>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're bad records,</v>

1014
00:44:46.411 --> 00:44:50.080
<v Speaker 1>they're out and they got some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful girl replacing them.</v>

1015
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.113
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1016
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:53.580
<v Speaker 1>it's the same way with fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1017
00:44:53.581 --> 00:44:56.550
<v Speaker 1>I've had this conversation with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend Brendan Schaub and I were talking</v>

1018
00:44:56.551 --> 00:44:58.160
<v Speaker 1>about this the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1019
00:44:59.100 --> 00:44:59.933
<v Speaker 1>big brown guys get into the UFC too </v>
<v Speaker 1>young and then they're fighting top </v>

1020
00:45:03.811 --> 00:45:04.644
<v Speaker 1>flight competition like right away and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's either sink or swim and some guy </v>

1021
00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:08.723
<v Speaker 1>swim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some guys have real massive </v>

1022
00:45:09.661 --> 00:45:10.494
<v Speaker 1>potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really they should be fighting </v>

1023
00:45:11.701 --> 00:45:14.880
<v Speaker 1>someone of a lower caliber and </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing their skills and experiencing</v>

1024
00:45:14.881 --> 00:45:15.714
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of different styles and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually working their way up to the </v>

1025
00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:18.924
<v Speaker 1>UFC after five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six years or so and instead they're </v>

1026
00:45:21.181 --> 00:45:22.014
<v Speaker 1>fighting in the UFC at 20 years old and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just not really ready for top </v>

1027
00:45:24.931 --> 00:45:26.270
<v Speaker 1>flight competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1028
00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:27.630
<v Speaker 1>in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you string together five,</v>

1029
00:45:27.631 --> 00:45:28.464
<v Speaker 1>six wins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're entitled contention some weight </v>

1030
00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:30.841
<v Speaker 1>divisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1031
00:45:30.841 --> 00:45:34.110
<v Speaker 1>That'll discourage the shit out of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're getting fucked up by some guy</v>

1032
00:45:34.111 --> 00:45:36.510
<v Speaker 1>who's just many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many levels above you.</v>

1033
00:45:36.511 --> 00:45:37.344
<v Speaker 1>You really shouldn't be fighting him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the flyweight division is perfect </v>

1034
00:45:39.781 --> 00:45:42.600
<v Speaker 1>example because it's run by this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>demetrius mighty mouse,</v>

1035
00:45:42.601 --> 00:45:43.434
<v Speaker 1>Johnson's probably best pound for pound </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter that's ever lived and he's </v>

1036
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.060
<v Speaker 1>saying something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1037
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.550
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking incredible and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wizard,</v>

1038
00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:51.593
<v Speaker 1>like he barely gets hit and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've seen him in the octagon </v>

1039
00:45:55.441 --> 00:45:59.610
<v Speaker 1>develop and grow and become this guy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now now he's just just,</v>

1040
00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's everybody.</v>

1041
00:46:00.721 --> 00:46:03.090
<v Speaker 1>And then there's mighty mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mighty mouse is just another level above</v>

1042
00:46:03.091 --> 00:46:03.924
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never seen anybody as good as </v>

1043
00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:07.890
<v Speaker 1>mayweather to avoid punches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's better.</v>

1044
00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:08.971
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one,</v>

1045
00:46:08.971 --> 00:46:10.560
<v Speaker 1>no one gets hit less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

1046
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:12.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean guys 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1047
00:46:12.241 --> 00:46:14.010
<v Speaker 1>and obviously one of them was conor </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcgregor,</v>

1048
00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.740
<v Speaker 1>which is kinda crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it connor hit him,</v>

1049
00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:18.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connor can crack,</v>

1050
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:21.300
<v Speaker 1>but he just didn't had no business in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ring.</v>

1051
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:22.263
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we really didn't know if he had </v>

1052
00:46:23.371 --> 00:46:25.620
<v Speaker 1>business in the ring until he fought </v>
<v Speaker 1>them after the fact.</v>

1053
00:46:25.621 --> 00:46:26.454
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he caught him with that upper cut </v>

1054
00:46:28.051 --> 00:46:29.520
<v Speaker 1>in the first round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if we wobbled them?</v>

1055
00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:30.413
<v Speaker 1>What have you heard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody can get crazy if you get hit </v>

1056
00:46:33.331 --> 00:46:34.920
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody can get knocked out,</v>

1057
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:38.280
<v Speaker 1>but may whether it's been hit right </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he was hurt.</v>

1058
00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:40.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't think conor hurt him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he just hit him good,</v>

1059
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:43.380
<v Speaker 1>but he's been her sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shane Mosley heard him.</v>

1060
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.060
<v Speaker 1>He's been hurt a couple of times in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

1061
00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:46.253
<v Speaker 1>but over the course of 50 professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights where most of them are at world </v>

1062
00:46:51.241 --> 00:46:52.170
<v Speaker 1>championship level.</v>

1063
00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:55.140
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching the.</v>

1064
00:46:55.141 --> 00:47:00.141
<v Speaker 1>They had like a highlights of the MMA </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the when Fox today and Rhonda Rousey</v>

1065
00:47:01.081 --> 00:47:04.950
<v Speaker 1>when she got kicked in the face though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a great kick that was.</v>

1066
00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Holly Holm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1067
00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:08.220
<v Speaker 1>that was in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember being there for that.</v>

1068
00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:09.001
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a Melbourne,</v>

1069
00:47:09.001 --> 00:47:10.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in Sydney.</v>

1070
00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:11.430
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1071
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:12.263
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sydney.</v>

1072
00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:14.370
<v Speaker 1>That was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might've been Melbourne.</v>

1073
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:16.590
<v Speaker 1>You might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might be right.</v>

1074
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:18.700
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right now that I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1075
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.220
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1076
00:47:20.221 --> 00:47:22.610
<v Speaker 1>you're definitely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that I know I'm stop.</v>

1077
00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Bargain with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leave yourself alone.</v>

1078
00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:27.540
<v Speaker 1>You're a good person trying to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Melbourne.</v>

1079
00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:29.183
<v Speaker 1>I love that great restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just going to say that great </v>

1080
00:47:31.151 --> 00:47:34.910
<v Speaker 1>coffee to Donovan's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have everything like their seafoods</v>

1081
00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:35.763
<v Speaker 1>fantastic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost like I'm an artsy sort </v>

1082
00:47:38.771 --> 00:47:39.690
<v Speaker 1>of San Francisco.</v>

1083
00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco's the one I compare it to.</v>

1084
00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's got its own thing.</v>

1085
00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Melbourne's got its own thing.</v>

1086
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Fucking crowds are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh cool.</v>

1087
00:47:47.591 --> 00:47:49.000
<v Speaker 1>And so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1088
00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:50.253
<v Speaker 1>they're great up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a comedy store in Sydney in </v>

1089
00:47:52.211 --> 00:47:53.044
<v Speaker 1>between like bigger gigs that takes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it worth it for them to bring you </v>

1090
00:47:55.331 --> 00:47:56.164
<v Speaker 1>over them and I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the culture and the of data to </v>

1091
00:47:59.771 --> 00:48:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Ari and I did the comedy store in Sydney</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a Sunday night on a whim.</v>

1092
00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:04.923
<v Speaker 1>The fights took place early in the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that it could be in the UFC pay per </v>

1093
00:48:08.381 --> 00:48:09.214
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we called up the comedy store and </v>

1094
00:48:10.871 --> 00:48:11.440
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1095
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:14.590
<v Speaker 1>can we do an impromptu show tonight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just put it up on twitter and they</v>

1096
00:48:14.591 --> 00:48:15.100
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1097
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:16.420
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me call you right back.</v>

1098

1099
00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we put it on twitter and then Ari</v>

1100
00:48:19.541 --> 00:48:21.410
<v Speaker 1>and I went and did a show that night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kid.</v>

1101
00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:22.660
<v Speaker 1>They came.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1102
00:48:22.661 --> 00:48:23.570
<v Speaker 1>it was packed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1103
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:24.783
<v Speaker 1>It was awfully heavy draw like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped me get a drone in Australia and </v>

1104
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:28.870
<v Speaker 1>that amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

1105
00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I was,</v>

1106
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:34.240
<v Speaker 1>when I started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you get on the tonight show,</v>

1107
00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:36.760
<v Speaker 1>that would be the first time hole all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

1108
00:48:36.761 --> 00:48:39.880
<v Speaker 1>So you get the whole world not like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1109
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.240
<v Speaker 1>The whole world hears this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1110
00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:45.060
<v Speaker 1>This thing has got its own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

1111
00:48:45.061 --> 00:48:49.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm just here working the wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at your house one day when kind of</v>

1112
00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:51.250
<v Speaker 1>like you had started it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you said you feel,</v>

1113
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:52.533
<v Speaker 1>forget what the exact word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but be a momentum going when you felt </v>

1114
00:48:55.901 --> 00:48:59.920
<v Speaker 1>you knew something was something </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible was going to happen with this</v>

1115
00:48:59.921 --> 00:49:00.310
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

1116
00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you just had the.</v>

1117
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:04.840
<v Speaker 1>You told me you have a feeling like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't bragging.</v>

1118
00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:05.943
<v Speaker 1>Not at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but was just like going with the energy </v>

1119
00:49:07.511 --> 00:49:08.344
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1120
00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:09.243
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1121
00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:12.670
<v Speaker 1>I was saying that I felt like there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something going on.</v>

1122
00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this show,</v>

1123
00:49:14.141 --> 00:49:17.170
<v Speaker 1>like it was just starting to pick up </v>
<v Speaker 1>momentum then and I was like,</v>

1124
00:49:17.171 --> 00:49:18.004
<v Speaker 1>there's something going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I was thinking about what the </v>

1125
00:49:20.891 --> 00:49:23.740
<v Speaker 1>potential was and at the time when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>first started,</v>

1126
00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:26.020
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't that many people listening </v>
<v Speaker 1>to podcasts.</v>

1127
00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:26.883
<v Speaker 1>It was very small and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were also streaming live on youtube </v>

1128
00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:30.813
<v Speaker 1>ustream and there wasn't many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to that either or watching </v>

1129
00:49:33.281 --> 00:49:34.600
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

1130
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:38.470
<v Speaker 1>but this keeps growing and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I knew that I was very interested in</v>

1131
00:49:38.471 --> 00:49:39.304
<v Speaker 1>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I knew I was going to get better at </v>

1132
00:49:40.361 --> 00:49:41.940
<v Speaker 1>it and I was always trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1133
00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:46.270
<v Speaker 1>what ways I could do it better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to get out of my own way,</v>

1134
00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:49.270
<v Speaker 1>how to not talk over people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing when to talk,</v>

1135
00:49:49.271 --> 00:49:50.110
<v Speaker 1>when not to talk.</v>

1136
00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:51.940
<v Speaker 1>I had to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tricky.</v>

1137
00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:55.310
<v Speaker 1>It is tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tricky to um,</v>

1138
00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:57.183
<v Speaker 1>to pay you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to put yourself in the seat of </v>

1139
00:50:00.071 --> 00:50:00.904
<v Speaker 1>the person that's listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think listening to podcasts helps </v>

1140
00:50:03.251 --> 00:50:05.560
<v Speaker 1>that as well and listening to things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't enjoy.</v>

1141
00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:06.663
<v Speaker 1>So he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that Stephen King </v>

1142
00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.160
<v Speaker 1>always says about writing is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should.</v>

1143
00:50:09.161 --> 00:50:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you should also read,</v>

1144
00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:11.693
<v Speaker 1>you should read a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the case with podcast </v>

1145
00:50:13.901 --> 00:50:14.734
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the case with standup as </v>

1146
00:50:15.821 --> 00:50:16.654
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think listening to other standup is </v>

1147
00:50:18.191 --> 00:50:21.190
<v Speaker 1>good as long as you're not getting ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>from them,</v>

1148
00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:23.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you're just enjoying it.</v>

1149
00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:27.440
<v Speaker 1>Like the good feeling that you get from </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching stand up watching someone kill,</v>

1150
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:28.783
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I get inspired by it and it </v>

1151
00:50:30.981 --> 00:50:33.140
<v Speaker 1>makes me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I see things,</v>

1152
00:50:33.141 --> 00:50:35.870
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're a little clunky in </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's act,</v>

1153
00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:38.810
<v Speaker 1>like how they need to clean that up or </v>
<v Speaker 1>tighten this up.</v>

1154
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:39.883
<v Speaker 1>And it makes me more cognizant about </v>
<v Speaker 1>those flaws in my own act and makes me </v>

1155
00:50:43.521 --> 00:50:45.090
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more self aware.</v>

1156
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:46.303
<v Speaker 1>I love to watch like say like Chris Rock</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he does something and then two </v>

1157
00:50:49.791 --> 00:50:52.800
<v Speaker 1>weeks later we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1158
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:56.060
<v Speaker 1>he's got a germ of something there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's so good at putting it,</v>

1159
00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:58.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>setting it up to be a potentially really</v>

1160
00:50:58.461 --> 00:50:59.400
<v Speaker 1>great bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1161
00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:00.523
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the all time greats for a </v>

1162
00:51:01.131 --> 00:51:04.010
<v Speaker 1>reason and one of the reasons is he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real craftsman.</v>

1163
00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:05.560
<v Speaker 1>He's a real artist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1164
00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:06.553
<v Speaker 1>Chris will go in there and he will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not just trying to kill every time </v>

1165
00:51:11.481 --> 00:51:13.190
<v Speaker 1>he goes onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1166
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:17.050
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to develop material and he's</v>

1167
00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:20.690
<v Speaker 1>using that time and it is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable thing for him,</v>

1168
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:21.290
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1169
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:24.260
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that this generation is</v>

1170
00:51:24.261 --> 00:51:25.094
<v Speaker 1>better than the generation I started </v>
<v Speaker 1>with and only because they got to see </v>

1171
00:51:29.181 --> 00:51:30.830
<v Speaker 1>them and grow from them.</v>

1172
00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:32.143
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you had to have somebody in the </v>

1173
00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:35.810
<v Speaker 1>middle because I mean honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1174
00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:37.153
<v Speaker 1>you and bill to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take you and bill over prior and the </v>

1175
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sacrilege.</v>

1176
00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stand ups.</v>

1177
00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:44.700
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1178
00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.970
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying that because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend and when we're here,</v>

1179
00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:50.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I seen these guys and I loved,</v>

1180
00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:51.360
<v Speaker 1>I loved them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1181
00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:52.193
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was one of those kids who grew up </v>

1182
00:51:53.361 --> 00:51:56.460
<v Speaker 1>watching him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it just is this,</v>

1183
00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:58.550
<v Speaker 1>your generation has taken it to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different level.</v>

1184
00:51:59.020 --> 00:51:59.853
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely a benefit of being </v>

1185
00:52:01.071 --> 00:52:03.080
<v Speaker 1>able to see the people before you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

1186
00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:06.230
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've learned a lot watching other comedy</v>

1187
00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:08.060
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching people just getting,</v>

1188
00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:10.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking yesterday about Richard,</v>

1189
00:52:10.131 --> 00:52:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Jenny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that um,</v>

1190
00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.430
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm brilliant writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1191
00:52:13.431 --> 00:52:14.910
<v Speaker 1>you're so good with him.</v>

1192
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:15.501
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1193
00:52:15.501 --> 00:52:18.190
<v Speaker 1>with sandals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of him say,</v>

1194
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing this.</v>

1195
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Spartacus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1196
00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1197
00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:27.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to one of his recordings</v>

1198
00:52:27.381 --> 00:52:29.870
<v Speaker 1>on the way home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big steaming pile of me,</v>

1199
00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:31.150
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1200
00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:32.570
<v Speaker 1>at least a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably more,</v>

1201
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:33.733
<v Speaker 1>but I remember like getting a noticeable</v>
<v Speaker 1>bump in my writing after I listened to </v>

1202
00:52:36.951 --> 00:52:41.951
<v Speaker 1>it because it was so inspiring and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a giant advantage that we</v>

1203
00:52:42.561 --> 00:52:43.394
<v Speaker 1>have today with like youtube and itunes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and things along those lines where you </v>

1204
00:52:47.271 --> 00:52:48.104
<v Speaker 1>can listen to anything you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go back and I was listening to an </v>

1205
00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:55.020
<v Speaker 1>old woody allen recording the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in my car driving.</v>

1206
00:52:55.021 --> 00:52:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Now listen to Woody Allen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do standup in the 1967.</v>

1207
00:52:57.550 --> 00:53:01.160
<v Speaker 1>You could tell he was a fucking pervert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even back then there was a line,</v>

1208
00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.730
<v Speaker 1>there was a line in love if there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>line in love and death.</v>

1209
00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Remember loving death?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1210
00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:07.903
<v Speaker 1>And Diane Keaton goes to this high </v>
<v Speaker 1>priest and she steps on his beard and </v>

1211
00:53:11.501 --> 00:53:12.334
<v Speaker 1>it's very funny scene and he says the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most beautiful thing in the world is a </v>

1212
00:53:15.591 --> 00:53:17.930
<v Speaker 1>12 year old girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blonde hair,</v>

1213
00:53:17.931 --> 00:53:19.880
<v Speaker 1>preferably twins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1214
00:53:19.881 --> 00:53:21.610
<v Speaker 1>And this is all this perverted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>

1215
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:26.910
<v Speaker 1>this happened 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 before he got accused of anything,</v>

1216
00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:28.443
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just interesting hearing </v>

1217
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:30.353
<v Speaker 1>because he did a couple of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did it even in Manhattan with </v>

1218
00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Hemingway was a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit twisted,</v>

1219
00:53:35.671 --> 00:53:38.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember Manhattan very much.</v>

1220
00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:39.383
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he falls in love and she pulls a love </v>

1221
00:53:40.381 --> 00:53:41.214
<v Speaker 1>with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's supposed to be 16 and he's Jesus </v>

1222
00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1223
00:53:45.511 --> 00:53:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Well it's not something that people tend</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

1224
00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:52.860
<v Speaker 1>They try to normalize whatever fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>provision they have and they put it into</v>

1225
00:53:52.861 --> 00:53:53.694
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that was one of the things that </v>

1226
00:53:54.721 --> 00:53:55.554
<v Speaker 1>they were accusing Louis Ck of with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie that he released right before it </v>

1227
00:54:00.451 --> 00:54:02.800
<v Speaker 1>came out that he was jerking off in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of a bunch of metal.</v>

1228
00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:03.973
<v Speaker 1>The had this movie and part of the movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just talking about how everyone's a </v>

1229
00:54:07.561 --> 00:54:09.660
<v Speaker 1>pervert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all perverts.</v>

1230
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:11.950
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you something off the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's your new show off the air with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dom Irrera burn people and any context </v>

1234
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:25.910
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1235
00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:27.640
<v Speaker 1>is this thing on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

1236
00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to go actually,</v>

1237
00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:33.960
<v Speaker 1>the night that he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the day after he went,</v>

1238
00:54:33.961 --> 00:54:35.040
<v Speaker 1>I went on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got.</v>

1239
00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so excited.</v>

1240
00:54:36.511 --> 00:54:40.860
<v Speaker 1>I got a part in a Louis ck new TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should shoot in about 10,</v>

1241
00:54:40.861 --> 00:54:45.030
<v Speaker 1>15 years and it took them a beat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they got it.</v>

1242
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:48.120
<v Speaker 1>I think he'll be back in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1243
00:54:48.121 --> 00:54:49.830
<v Speaker 1>you know what Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has that advantage of.</v>

1244
00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:52.860
<v Speaker 1>He was the one that created the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling your own thing.</v>

1245
00:54:52.861 --> 00:54:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he can do that.</v>

1246
00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:57.150
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't need a producer for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1247
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:59.910
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have him on this show,</v>

1248
00:54:59.911 --> 00:55:00.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1249
00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:01.290
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent of them on.</v>

1250
00:55:01.550 --> 00:55:02.383
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a different person than </v>

1251
00:55:05.821 --> 00:55:08.790
<v Speaker 3>when he did those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think those things that he did jerking</v>

1252
00:55:08.791 --> 00:55:09.624
<v Speaker 3>off in front of him punch people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible and I think he probably had an </v>

1253
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:14.063
<v Speaker 3>idea in his head of what those things </v>
<v Speaker 3>were and of who he was and who he would </v>

1254
00:55:17.371 --> 00:55:18.204
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think a lot of your self </v>

1255
00:55:19.861 --> 00:55:24.861
<v Speaker 3>definitions a lot of times are based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this very limited idea of who you are.</v>

1256
00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:26.723
<v Speaker 3>Very limited idea of who you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be and he's like a wallowing in his own </v>

1257
00:55:30.061 --> 00:55:32.460
<v Speaker 3>weirdness and just wants a jerk off in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of somebody,</v>

1258
00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:33.773
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's out of all the offenses of things </v>

1259
00:55:36.061 --> 00:55:36.894
<v Speaker 3>you could do to someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the least egregious because </v>

1260
00:55:39.031 --> 00:55:41.210
<v Speaker 3>he's not raping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not as.</v>

1261
00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:42.600
<v Speaker 3>He didn't lock the door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not.</v>

1262
00:55:42.601 --> 00:55:43.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't lock the door.</v>

1263
00:55:43.591 --> 00:55:45.990
<v Speaker 3>He's not doing anything awful to </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone.</v>

1264
00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:48.420
<v Speaker 3>He just doing something weird in front </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>

1265
00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:50.760
<v Speaker 3>I think it's beautiful to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1266
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:51.833
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's beautiful because a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of things that I think of you to </v>

1267
00:55:53.401 --> 00:55:55.590
<v Speaker 3>think it's a plus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely a black.</v>

1268
00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:56.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1269
00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:57.450
<v Speaker 3>it's human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

1270
00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:58.363
<v Speaker 1>then I bet at it out of the air because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of an ape doesn't really care if you </v>

1271
00:56:00.951 --> 00:56:02.850
<v Speaker 1>jerk and if you're watching when he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>jerking off,</v>

1272
00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:07.550
<v Speaker 1>it could be the jerky over the banana </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one hand banana and the other.</v>

1273
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1274
00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:10.470
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey.</v>

1275
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:13.543
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm at all the things that he did and I </v>

1276
00:56:14.961 --> 00:56:19.961
<v Speaker 3>think that his apology pretty was what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a way to look at it?</v>

1277
00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:24.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it honest and I think it sort of</v>

1278
00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:29.310
<v Speaker 3>explained how his mind worked and why he</v>
<v Speaker 3>did it in the first place.</v>

1279
00:56:29.330 --> 00:56:30.163
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's obviously not something you're </v>

1280
00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:33.730
<v Speaker 3>proud of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So obviously something he's disgusted by</v>

1281
00:56:33.731 --> 00:56:35.740
<v Speaker 3>himself and you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>

1282
00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:37.930
<v Speaker 3>you jerk off in front of someone 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

1283
00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:40.840
<v Speaker 3>How do you fix that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't do it again.</v>

1284
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:42.760
<v Speaker 3>He hasn't done it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing.</v>

1285
00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:45.760
<v Speaker 3>No one's saying these done anything in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>

1286
00:56:45.761 --> 00:56:46.594
<v Speaker 3>Like all the accusations were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say they were from there or </v>

1287
00:56:51.041 --> 00:56:52.150
<v Speaker 3>from years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1288
00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:55.010
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you fix that clicks?</v>

1289
00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:58.300
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you did jerk off in front of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>few people.</v>

1290
00:56:58.301 --> 00:56:58.841
<v Speaker 3>Dom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1291
00:56:58.841 --> 00:56:59.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1292
00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:01.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why that came up for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>blind lady is,</v>

1293
00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:05.110
<v Speaker 3>is it still killed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It depends on how good are hearing is.</v>

1294
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:07.340
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's here.</v>

1295
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:12.290
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you doing over there at dawn?</v>

1296
00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:19.510
<v Speaker 3>And she has to guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all fucking guesswork.</v>

1297
00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:21.670
<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you fix that?</v>

1298
00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:24.470
<v Speaker 3>Like what does a guy do to fix that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1299
00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:28.330
<v Speaker 3>I think out of all the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how the fuck would you rehabilitate</v>

1300
00:57:28.331 --> 00:57:30.610
<v Speaker 3>Harvey Weinstein?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you let Harvey Weinstein around a</v>

1301
00:57:30.611 --> 00:57:31.450
<v Speaker 3>woman again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>

1302
00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:35.850
<v Speaker 3>how do you leave Harvey Weinstein in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hotel room with a woman who comes in for</v>

1303
00:57:35.851 --> 00:57:38.530
<v Speaker 3>a meeting or it was the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the worst.</v>

1304
00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:39.393
<v Speaker 3>He's the word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can rehabilitate to </v>

1305
00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:41.500
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>

1306
00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:42.610
<v Speaker 3>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>

1307
00:57:42.611 --> 00:57:43.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you fix that?</v>

1308
00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:46.610
<v Speaker 3>The only way cosby gets rehabilitated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1309
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:47.583
<v Speaker 3>I mean not really rehabilitated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the only way he gets reintroduced </v>

1310
00:57:49.661 --> 00:57:50.494
<v Speaker 3>into society is if everyone believes </v>
<v Speaker 3>those girls are lying and that's never </v>

1311
00:57:52.901 --> 00:57:53.500
<v Speaker 3>going to happen.</v>

1312
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:57.520
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible because everybody heard </v>
<v Speaker 3>those stories a long time ago when I did</v>

1313
00:57:57.521 --> 00:57:58.354
<v Speaker 3>star search and like 83 and he was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guest host and we were hearing shit </v>

1314
00:58:04.061 --> 00:58:07.270
<v Speaker 3>about him on the set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then really womanizing and stuff.</v>

1315
00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:08.133
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Chris,</v>

1316
00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:11.710
<v Speaker 3>not as extreme as a drug and drug and </v>
<v Speaker 3>raping them.</v>

1317
00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:13.450
<v Speaker 3>But like if you're a guy like Louis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>c,</v>

1318
00:58:13.451 --> 00:58:15.130
<v Speaker 3>k,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>

1319
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:17.720
<v Speaker 3>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what would he,</v>

1320
00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:22.150
<v Speaker 3>what could he have done before the story</v>
<v Speaker 3>came out that he's doing that to girls?</v>

1321
00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:26.350
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what could he have done to make amends?</v>

1322
00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:27.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what could you have done?</v>

1323
00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:28.173
<v Speaker 3>He said sorry to some of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why you looking at me like </v>

1324
00:58:30.041 --> 00:58:31.540
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to think.</v>

1325
00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:33.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're my friend.</v>

1326
00:58:33.551 --> 00:58:34.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at you and you're right </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1327
00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:39.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm just thinking like what would one </v>
<v Speaker 3>do?</v>

1328
00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:43.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean it seems like let's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not exonerating him.</v>

1329
00:58:43.751 --> 00:58:44.584
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it seems like all these years since </v>

1330
00:58:47.141 --> 00:58:48.880
<v Speaker 3>then he hasn't done it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1331
00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:49.923
<v Speaker 3>So if he hasn't done it again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he must understand that there's </v>

1332
00:58:52.061 --> 00:58:56.920
<v Speaker 3>something wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some weird compulsion and it had</v>

1333
00:58:56.921 --> 00:59:00.190
<v Speaker 3>to be a power thing because anybody can </v>
<v Speaker 3>get a hooker and do that.</v>

1334
00:59:00.590 --> 00:59:02.980
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well here's the thing.</v>

1335
00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:06.070
<v Speaker 3>He was probably doing that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1336
00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:09.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean it'd be like jerking off in front</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people.</v>

1337
00:59:09.041 --> 00:59:11.410
<v Speaker 3>He might've just like jerking off in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of all kinds of people.</v>

1338
00:59:11.411 --> 00:59:13.060
<v Speaker 3>He might've jerked off in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hookers to.</v>

1339
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:13.983
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1340
00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:17.790
<v Speaker 3>but we know that he did it in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>women that really didn't want them to do</v>

1341
00:59:17.791 --> 00:59:18.624
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I thought might be part of </v>

1342
00:59:19.361 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 3>the kinkiness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1343
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:22.813
<v Speaker 1>there's some stories of him doing it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of women and they thought it was </v>

1344
00:59:24.591 --> 00:59:27.680
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did it in front of some female comics</v>

1345
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:28.783
<v Speaker 1>and they thought it was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you stay hard when they're </v>

1346
00:59:30.951 --> 00:59:33.170
<v Speaker 1>laughing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be a real animal.</v>

1347
00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:36.470
<v Speaker 1>It's better than better man than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dumb.</v>

1348
00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I did a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just.</v>

1349
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:40.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you think of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

1350
00:59:40.191 --> 00:59:42.980
<v Speaker 1>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woody Allen said that mentioned on stage</v>

1351
00:59:42.981 --> 00:59:44.900
<v Speaker 1>in these women started bowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1352
00:59:44.901 --> 00:59:46.970
<v Speaker 1>why you boom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said because of what he did and the</v>

1353
00:59:46.971 --> 00:59:48.350
<v Speaker 1>daughter and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1354
00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:49.184
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

1355
00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:51.050
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the one thing you got to admit,</v>

1356
00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:53.750
<v Speaker 1>he really must love her because it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she's hot,</v>

1357
00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:57.230
<v Speaker 1>but that got a laugh.</v>

1358
00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:01.100
<v Speaker 1>When we get offstage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you one,</v>

1359
01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:02.390

<v Speaker 1>snoop bit.</v>

1360
01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:06.050

<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you on stage when you tell</v>

1361

<v Speaker 1>I'm happier now than I've ever been in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

1380
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great to hear that.</v>

1381
01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm also,</v>

1382
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:03.290
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm a nicer person now that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever been in my life.</v>

1383
01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Wait a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way nicer.</v>

1384
01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much to compare with his little brick.</v>

1385
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:12.140
<v Speaker 1>What did you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just makes you a,</v>

1386
01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:13.013
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave Chappelle said this to me once and </v>

1387
01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:17.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a really great quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said not only is having children made</v>

1388
01:01:17.751 --> 01:01:18.584
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1389
01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.550
<v Speaker 1>made me love someone more than I ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought I could.</v>

1390
01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:25.370
<v Speaker 1>It's changed my capacity for love and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

1391
01:01:25.650 --> 01:01:26.483
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like my capacity for love as much </v>

1392
01:01:27.891 --> 01:01:29.870
<v Speaker 1>greater than it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That make sense.</v>

1393
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Like you realize like a lot of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggles and a lot of the shit that we,</v>

1394
01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:35.673
<v Speaker 1>we go through in this life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of it is about perspective </v>

1395
01:01:38.810 --> 01:01:39.643
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of it is about who's around </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and what kind of loving environment </v>

1396
01:01:42.561 --> 01:01:47.561
<v Speaker 1>you around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also having kids and not having</v>

1397
01:01:47.810 --> 01:01:51.200
<v Speaker 1>the strain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the financial strain,</v>

1398
01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:55.810
<v Speaker 1>the emotional strain and the ignorance </v>
<v Speaker 1>strain that my parents had.</v>

1399
01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Their parents are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorance is a big thing too.</v>

1400
01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Like they didn't know how to raise kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>

1401
01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Of course they hit us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1402
01:02:01.931 --> 01:02:02.764
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they yelled at us and they didn't know </v>

1403
01:02:03.831 --> 01:02:05.000
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom didn't hit me,</v>

1404
01:02:05.001 --> 01:02:05.834
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a common thing for people hit </v>

1405
01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:08.324
<v Speaker 1>their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember Bruce Willis said to me one </v>

1406
01:02:09.981 --> 01:02:12.740
<v Speaker 1>time to be a named driver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1407
01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:15.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things about having kids,</v>

1408
01:02:15.081 --> 01:02:16.610
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a little girl,</v>

1409
01:02:16.611 --> 01:02:18.600
<v Speaker 1>I forget the middle little one's name.</v>

1410
01:02:19.210 --> 01:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>He said she would wake me up to walk her</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the bathroom and,</v>

1411
01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:22.733
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to her I wasn't a movie star wasn't </v>

1412
01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:26.013
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was daddy because she's afraid of the </v>

1413
01:02:28.171 --> 01:02:29.004
<v Speaker 1>dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walking her in and he said that really </v>

1414
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:34.800
<v Speaker 1>humanized them and made them feel good </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

1415
01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:35.643
<v Speaker 1>it's like you get stroked all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like sometimes you just want to be </v>

1416
01:02:37.891 --> 01:02:38.581
<v Speaker 1>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1417
01:02:38.581 --> 01:02:41.340
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Bruce Willis was famous,</v>

1418
01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.353
<v Speaker 1>there was way less famous people because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no famous internet </v>

1419
01:02:46.171 --> 01:02:49.470
<v Speaker 1>personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no famous reality TV stars.</v>

1420
01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:50.453
<v Speaker 1>There was way less famous rappers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was way less famous comedians </v>

1421
01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:56.160
<v Speaker 1>think out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few famous Comedians,</v>

1422
01:02:56.161 --> 01:03:00.840
<v Speaker 1>they were like me and dice and guys that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were on Rodney specials.</v>

1423
01:03:00.841 --> 01:03:04.470
<v Speaker 1>We were really fucking lucky because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>became instant draws.</v>

1424
01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:08.040
<v Speaker 1>I paid to see you after you were on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rodney.</v>

1425
01:03:08.041 --> 01:03:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Special extra.</v>

1426
01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:10.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to see you at next and I went to </v>

1427
01:03:11.731 --> 01:03:12.564
<v Speaker 1>see two nights in a row because one </v>
<v Speaker 1>night I thought you were supposed to be </v>

1428
01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:16.133
<v Speaker 1>there and neither you missed your flight</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something happened and Dennis leary </v>

1429
01:03:18.511 --> 01:03:20.040
<v Speaker 1>was there instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1430
01:03:20.041 --> 01:03:20.874
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we came back the next day and we saw </v>

1431
01:03:23.221 --> 01:03:24.054
<v Speaker 1>you again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm really with a girl that I was </v>

1432
01:03:26.551 --> 01:03:27.720
<v Speaker 1>dating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her name was Stephanie.</v>

1433
01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:29.573
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1434
01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:31.590
<v Speaker 1>she's telling me what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was older,</v>

1435
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:34.990
<v Speaker 1>really the dominant one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>

1436
01:03:34.991 --> 01:03:36.480
<v Speaker 1>it was the first girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was 25.</v>

1437
01:03:36.481 --> 01:03:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I was 21.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's sick.</v>

1438
01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:41.430
<v Speaker 1>She liked the deck though to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that woo.</v>

1439
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Like it would be a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The old lesbian.</v>

1440
01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Well that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was exciting about it.</v>

1441
01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.480
<v Speaker 1>She's the first woman I dated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1442
01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:49.373
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was a woman that I dated girls </v>

1443
01:03:51.181 --> 01:03:54.150
<v Speaker 1>before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that girl was a woman and you know,</v>

1444
01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:57.510
<v Speaker 1>she was fucking smart to refer girls who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are a woman's age.</v>

1445
01:03:59.330 --> 01:04:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was.</v>

1446
01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:01.143
<v Speaker 1>I'm too intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She tells me what to do with standup up </v>

1447
01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.200
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Standard Bailey's.</v>

1448
01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's of hilarious.</v>

1449
01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:08.383
<v Speaker 1>So that Seinfeld episode where the girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>broke up with him because of his act </v>

1450
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:13.800
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

1451
01:04:13.801 --> 01:04:15.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this is going to work.</v>

1452
01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.210
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

1453
01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:17.340
<v Speaker 1>we're having a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>

1454
01:04:17.341 --> 01:04:20.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your act with the Igg ever notice?</v>

1455
01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:22.170
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not my style of comedy.</v>

1456
01:04:22.171 --> 01:04:24.180
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're breaking up with me because on my</v>

1457
01:04:24.181 --> 01:04:24.781
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

1459
01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:28.680
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1460
01:04:28.681 --> 01:04:31.920
<v Speaker 1>if you were a girl and you were a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy fan,</v>

1461
01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.190
<v Speaker 1>I could imagine if you were a girl and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

1462
01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.233
<v Speaker 1>you love Chappelle and pill burden and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dom irrera and Duncan trussell and Joey </v>

1463
01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:42.953
<v Speaker 1>Diaz and all these great comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you start dating a prop act </v>

1464
01:04:46.610 --> 01:04:48.420
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's the worst prop act.</v>

1465
01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like fucking stupid.</v>

1466
01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:51.990
<v Speaker 1>He's got a soundtrack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has to play,</v>

1467
01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:52.913
<v Speaker 1>hit the music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking dropped down and comes up with </v>

1468
01:04:55.201 --> 01:04:59.580
<v Speaker 1>an album jokes and sophie told me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she would,</v>

1469
01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:01.260
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't go out with me if she </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't like my.</v>

1470
01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:02.810
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1471
01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a comedy fan of me,</v>

1472
01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:05.484
<v Speaker 1>if you're a music fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck would you date a guy who's </v>

1473
01:05:06.841 --> 01:05:08.580
<v Speaker 1>got terrible songs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1474
01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.220
<v Speaker 1>How could you be brought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1475
01:05:11.221 --> 01:05:13.380
<v Speaker 1>if you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bad accountant,</v>

1476
01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:15.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're a great guy.</v>

1477
01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Probably still get a date.</v>

1478
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:20.063
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a fucking terrible to thing </v>

1479
01:05:22.301 --> 01:05:23.860
<v Speaker 1>that someone loves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1480
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Well that's so much more personal than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the debits and credits.</v>

1481
01:05:27.251 --> 01:05:28.084
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're standing up as you are </v>

1482
01:05:29.761 --> 01:05:31.990
<v Speaker 1>a reflection of you generally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1483
01:05:31.991 --> 01:05:35.170
<v Speaker 1>if a good shit good stand up is one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most personal things.</v>

1484
01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:39.490
<v Speaker 1>I think music stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe writing.</v>

1485
01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Writing's pretty personal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1486
01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:42.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But stand up really good ups or reveal </v>

1487
01:05:44.921 --> 01:05:45.754
<v Speaker 1>something of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you know them for </v>

1488
01:05:47.681 --> 01:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>something to relate to the brochure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1489
01:05:51.130 --> 01:05:51.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1490
01:05:51.791 --> 01:05:52.624
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's more famous standups </v>

<v Speaker 1>Jeff and I were talking about the number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of guys today and gals that can sell out</v>

1494
01:06:05.681 --> 01:06:08.950
<v Speaker 1>big ass theaters and it's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1495
01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:11.170
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago there was nobody,</v>

1496
01:06:11.171 --> 01:06:12.520
<v Speaker 1>there was like a handful.</v>

1497
01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Everybody worked at clubs and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a few George Carlin's out there,</v>

1498
01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:17.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few Chris Rock's or whoever it was at </v>

1499
01:06:20.831 --> 01:06:24.310
<v Speaker 1>the time that could sell out a theater </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now like,</v>

1500
01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.140
<v Speaker 1>fucking everybody's selling out these </v>
<v Speaker 1>theaters.</v>

1501
01:06:26.141 --> 01:06:28.210
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the right social media,</v>

1502
01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.550
<v Speaker 1>social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1503
01:06:30.551 --> 01:06:32.770
<v Speaker 1>but they still have to have an act </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they'll sell out once,</v>

1504
01:06:32.771 --> 01:06:34.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe twice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then then it's done.</v>

1505
01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I what have one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of those people from that.</v>

1512
01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:48.003
<v Speaker 1>Eliza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eliza is probably the most successful </v>

1513
01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:51.490
<v Speaker 1>out of that group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1518
01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.820

<v Speaker 1>She works hard.</v>

1519
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:04.743
<v Speaker 1>She does work hard.</v>

1521
01:07:08.621 --> 01:07:10.890
<v Speaker 1>was on my podcast and have you heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

1522
01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:14.020

<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1525
01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:21.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't show it for God's sakes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>shit for asking to show,</v>

1528

1531
01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:31.683
<v Speaker 1>When she was on my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the fucking comments were </v>

1532
01:07:34.301 --> 01:07:37.930
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>

<v Speaker 1>any button that's ever been on the </v>

1540
01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:59.250

<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for a lot because I'm not threatened</v>

1544
01:08:06.551 --> 01:08:10.060

<v Speaker 1>I maybe I feel like it's silly sometimes</v>

1545
01:08:10.061 --> 01:08:12.150
<v Speaker 1>with some people if they're too </v>
<v Speaker 1>confident,</v>

<v Speaker 1>too cocky or they're too dismissive of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

1547
01:08:14.711 --> 01:08:17.210
<v Speaker 1>I think it's silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't get mad at it.</v>

1548
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:20.240

<v Speaker 1>was a teenager and I've seen it.</v>

1570
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:16.430
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it through a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggles,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was sent back in the day.</v>

1579
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.863
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second thing is I never take my </v>

1580

<v Speaker 1>pants in front of you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she took to it like a duck to water </v>

<v Speaker 1>but immediately,</v>

1587
01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:57.613
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like she feels like that's where </v>

1588
01:09:59.571 --> 01:10:01.860
<v Speaker 1>she was always meant to be.</v>

1597
01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.030
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:46.520
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1609
01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:49.790
<v Speaker 1>he said something about his mouth being </v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin's cock holster.</v>

1623
01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:26.610

<v Speaker 1>Was it the school shooting?</v>

1624
01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:29.100
<v Speaker 1>But that was brutal though.</v>

1629
01:11:40.651 --> 01:11:41.484
<v Speaker 1>they had to stay there for hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had everything under lock down </v>

1630
01:11:43.141 --> 01:11:44.730
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't know who had guns </v>
<v Speaker 1>and who didn't.</v>

1631
01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:46.500
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know it with one person or </v>
<v Speaker 1>50 people.</v>

1632
01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:50.440
<v Speaker 1>And she's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's at the trop and uh,</v>

1633
01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:51.413
<v Speaker 1>she got kind of traumatized by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so new year's Eve were walking outside </v>

1634
01:11:54.841 --> 01:11:58.800
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden she starts shaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was having an anxiety attack,</v>

1635
01:11:58.830 --> 01:12:00.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about being in a crowd.</v>

1636
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:01.733
<v Speaker 1>So I was just fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to make her laugh and say </v>

1637
01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.360
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we're in the fireworks.</v>

1638
01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:07.530
<v Speaker 1>That's all I really care about is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fireworks.</v>

1639
01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:10.760
<v Speaker 1>And he took that away from me because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're selfish and Felix,</v>

1640
01:12:10.761 --> 01:12:12.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1641
01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:16.260
<v Speaker 1>but I got her laugh in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fucking,</v>

1642
01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:18.450
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the volume of them.</v>

1643
01:12:19.170 --> 01:12:20.003
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like every couple months or </v>

1644
01:12:21.330 --> 01:12:22.800
<v Speaker 1>some new one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember when Columbine,</v>

1645
01:12:22.801 --> 01:12:25.350
<v Speaker 1>we thought this is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's won't happen again.</v>

1646
01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's so many now,</v>

1647
01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get used to it,</v>

1648
01:12:28.981 --> 01:12:30.390
<v Speaker 1>which has said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1649
01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:33.540
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know what the answer is.</v>

1650
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.823
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's a tighter gun </v>

1651
01:12:36.871 --> 01:12:37.704
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that would stop them </v>

1652
01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:41.910
<v Speaker 1>because it would just make it more </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to get guns,</v>

1653
01:12:41.911 --> 01:12:44.970
<v Speaker 1>but would that be enough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're not doing anything.</v>

1654
01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interesting thing to try something,</v>

1655
01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:47.733
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in and there's also the number of </v>

1656
01:12:49.981 --> 01:12:51.800
<v Speaker 1>people that are on psychiatric </v>
<v Speaker 1>medication.</v>

1657
01:12:51.801 --> 01:12:53.160
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1658
01:12:53.161 --> 01:12:55.890
<v Speaker 1>I think that for the [inaudible] or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they are,</v>

1659
01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:58.050
<v Speaker 1>they share sold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shouldn't be.</v>

1660
01:12:58.051 --> 01:13:01.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really need that to kill a pheasant.</v>

1661
01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:05.460
<v Speaker 1>It's not a a hunting gun really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the guy who designed them,</v>

1662
01:13:05.461 --> 01:13:07.790
<v Speaker 1>said he made it for war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1663
01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:08.633
<v Speaker 1>The real real</v>

1664
01:13:09.090 --> 01:13:13.170
<v Speaker 3>for hunting are usually usually bolt </v>
<v Speaker 3>action rifles,</v>

1665
01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.033
<v Speaker 3>which means you have around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have usually two or three in the </v>

1666
01:13:18.211 --> 01:13:21.570
<v Speaker 3>magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a couple or one in the chamber.</v>

1667
01:13:21.571 --> 01:13:23.010
<v Speaker 3>You put it in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cheeky,</v>

1668
01:13:23.011 --> 01:13:23.844
<v Speaker 3>lock it in place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The clamp it down and you fire a shot </v>

1669
01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.870
<v Speaker 3>and then you have to bolted again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to use the.</v>

1670
01:13:30.871 --> 01:13:31.704
<v Speaker 3>The action again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shell pops out and another one goes </v>

1671
01:13:34.021 --> 01:13:35.370
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bolt that down,</v>

1672
01:13:35.371 --> 01:13:38.220
<v Speaker 3>and then you get another shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very slow thing.</v>

1673
01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:42.270
<v Speaker 3>It takes a couple of Musket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas these are like tack,</v>

1674
01:13:42.271 --> 01:13:43.104
<v Speaker 3>tack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tack tack,</v>

1675
01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:46.290
<v Speaker 3>or with the bump stocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They apparently,</v>

1676
01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:48.810
<v Speaker 3>the president wants a ban bump stocks </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a bump.</v>

1677
01:13:48.811 --> 01:13:50.190
<v Speaker 3>Stock is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1678
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:55.550
<v Speaker 3>it's a stock where you pull back on it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and apparently you push forward and pull</v>

1679
01:13:56.221 --> 01:13:57.830
<v Speaker 3>back at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1680
01:13:57.940 --> 01:13:58.773
<v Speaker 3>I might be fucking this up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is the stock makes the </v>

1681
01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:03.340
<v Speaker 3>trigger go like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1682
01:14:03.341 --> 01:14:03.571
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1683
01:14:03.571 --> 01:14:03.831
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1684
01:14:03.831 --> 01:14:04.231
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1685
01:14:04.231 --> 01:14:05.064
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's almost like an automatic </v>

1686
01:14:05.761 --> 01:14:09.450
<v Speaker 3>weapon and trump just decided to ban </v>
<v Speaker 3>those.</v>

1687
01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:13.000
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of people that are up </v>
<v Speaker 3>in arms about him banning those,</v>

1688
01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:16.000
<v Speaker 3>like these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gun rights people don't want to lose</v>

1689
01:14:16.001 --> 01:14:17.740
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to lose any rights.</v>

1690
01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:21.040
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to lose any fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy ass weapons.</v>

1691
01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:22.173
<v Speaker 3>They think that any slip is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is eventually going to lead to them </v>

1692
01:14:26.351 --> 01:14:27.184
<v Speaker 3>getting their guns taken away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I follow a bunch of NRA people and </v>

1693
01:14:30.281 --> 01:14:33.100
<v Speaker 3>gun people on twitter and instagram and </v>
<v Speaker 3>take their guns away.</v>

1694
01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.830
<v Speaker 3>They think they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think they are.</v>

1695
01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:37.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

1696
01:14:37.751 --> 01:14:39.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's ever going to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>to that.</v>

1697
01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:43.480
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that tighter regulation is </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

1698
01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:45.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1699
01:14:45.341 --> 01:14:46.174
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think first of all you should have to </v>

1700
01:14:48.101 --> 01:14:51.020
<v Speaker 3>go through some sort of examination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can go through exam,</v>

1701
01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:54.220
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't drive a fucking car unless you</v>

1702
01:14:54.221 --> 01:14:56.080
<v Speaker 3>prove that you know how to operate a </v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

1703
01:14:56.110 --> 01:14:58.150
<v Speaker 3>Like someone has to be there with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an expert.</v>

1704
01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.960
<v Speaker 3>So driving expert watches you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they watch.</v>

1705
01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:03.520
<v Speaker 3>Make sure you know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do here at this light?</v>

1706
01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:06.250
<v Speaker 3>Do you know how to hit the brakes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do stop perfectly.</v>

1707
01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:10.300
<v Speaker 3>Do you look left and right before you </v>
<v Speaker 3>turn all that shit is super important.</v>

1708
01:15:10.301 --> 01:15:11.980
<v Speaker 3>If you want to drive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck is it?</v>

1709
01:15:11.981 --> 01:15:15.190
<v Speaker 3>Not Super Important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you operate a goddamn firearm,</v>

1710
01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:19.430
<v Speaker 3>I know I don't understand like the kid </v>
<v Speaker 3>who bought the,</v>

1711
01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.020
<v Speaker 3>I think the kid who did the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1712
01:15:21.090 --> 01:15:25.960
<v Speaker 3>latest shooting in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was two stories together.</v>

1713
01:15:25.961 --> 01:15:26.794
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently he was under age and had </v>

1714
01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:31.300
<v Speaker 3>fake id and still was able to buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1715
01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:32.750
<v Speaker 3>I didn't read that story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be,</v>

1716
01:15:32.751 --> 01:15:34.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I avoided the story.</v>

1717
01:15:34.451 --> 01:15:37.540
<v Speaker 3>I saw the kid's face and I saw the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking insane.</v>

1718
01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:38.373
<v Speaker 3>And you hear all the stories about kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were saying that they knew that </v>

1719
01:15:40.061 --> 01:15:42.550
<v Speaker 3>this kid was going to be a school </v>
<v Speaker 3>shooter anyway,</v>

1720
01:15:43.190 --> 01:15:47.040
<v Speaker 3>they were saying in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then one of the things he wrote it,</v>

1721
01:15:47.041 --> 01:15:47.874
<v Speaker 3>wrote it on facebook or something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he wants to be a professional school </v>

1722
01:15:50.651 --> 01:15:51.484
<v Speaker 3>shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then two years later and he got </v>

1723
01:15:54.761 --> 01:15:55.594
<v Speaker 3>visited by the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the FBI actually checked this fucking </v>

1724
01:15:58.151 --> 01:15:59.470
<v Speaker 3>kid out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk to him about it,</v>

1725
01:15:59.490 --> 01:16:00.323
<v Speaker 3>decided he wasn't a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you decide someone's a threat or </v>

1726
01:16:02.381 --> 01:16:03.490
<v Speaker 3>not a threat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1727
01:16:03.491 --> 01:16:05.050
<v Speaker 3>if you're talking to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were a threat.</v>

1728
01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:06.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they may be.</v>

1729
01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:10.480
<v Speaker 3>I can't talk to everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would be suspicious of anyone that</v>

1730
01:16:10.481 --> 01:16:13.450
<v Speaker 3>it took that much energy to go find it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did they find them?</v>

1731
01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:15.200
<v Speaker 3>Why would they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would they even question them?</v>

1732
01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:16.853
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people were saying that he's a </v>

1733
01:16:18.191 --> 01:16:19.330
<v Speaker 3>fucking psychopath.</v>

1734
01:16:21.370 --> 01:16:23.800
<v Speaker 3>It hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just sad.</v>

1735
01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:27.790
<v Speaker 3>It's just fucking sad that it's sad that</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone could do that.</v>

1736
01:16:27.791 --> 01:16:28.624
<v Speaker 3>It's sad that anyone would be hurting </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so fucked up that you can take a </v>

1737
01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:33.520
<v Speaker 3>child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine you have a kid,</v>

1738
01:16:33.521 --> 01:16:35.410
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got a little dom,</v>

1739
01:16:35.411 --> 01:16:36.244
<v Speaker 3>irrera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little tiny baby and he's just a cute </v>

1740
01:16:37.841 --> 01:16:38.674
<v Speaker 3>little fellow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little tiny baby and they don't know </v>

1741
01:16:39.641 --> 01:16:44.641
<v Speaker 3>anything that would tickle him and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>from there one day that becomes a school</v>

1742
01:16:45.791 --> 01:16:46.624
<v Speaker 3>shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what people have to take into </v>

1743
01:16:48.281 --> 01:16:49.114
<v Speaker 3>consideration that this boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this 19 year old boy who did that was a </v>

1744
01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:57.691
<v Speaker 3>baby at one point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a failed process of failed product,</v>

1745
01:16:58.090 --> 01:17:02.410
<v Speaker 3>whether it's through his environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his family,</v>

1746
01:17:02.411 --> 01:17:04.240
<v Speaker 3>his DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the above,</v>

1747
01:17:04.241 --> 01:17:06.460
<v Speaker 3>his life experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the pain,</v>

1748
01:17:06.461 --> 01:17:08.320
<v Speaker 3>the trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mental illness,</v>

1749
01:17:08.321 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 3>all these various factors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1750
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:10.813
<v Speaker 1>that used to be a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably the cutest little fucker </v>

1751
01:17:12.710 --> 01:17:13.543
<v Speaker 1>probably hold them and cuddle and we'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to sleep in your arms and one of the </v>

1752
01:17:18.681 --> 01:17:23.120
<v Speaker 1>things is changed with me since and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes a little bit every day.</v>

1753
01:17:23.121 --> 01:17:23.954
<v Speaker 1>I feel like every day I just get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit more compassionate and more </v>

1754
01:17:27.051 --> 01:17:30.350
<v Speaker 1>understanding and I work towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something I really think about,</v>

1755
01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:31.963
<v Speaker 1>but having children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of people as they used to be a </v>

1756
01:17:36.531 --> 01:17:38.020
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has to be a baby.</v>

1757
01:17:38.021 --> 01:17:38.854
<v Speaker 1>I think of that with the homeless people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there and they're all those blankets </v>

1758
01:17:42.471 --> 01:17:44.180
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this was born at.</v>

1759
01:17:44.181 --> 01:17:46.530
<v Speaker 1>This person was born into somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1760
01:17:46.570 --> 01:17:47.403
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking that the other day I was </v>

1761
01:17:48.141 --> 01:17:48.974
<v Speaker 1>at coffee bean and I knew homeless guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>was there from the smell that was </v>

1762
01:17:53.061 --> 01:17:55.690
<v Speaker 1>pouring cream in my coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I witnessed,</v>

1763
01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:56.553
<v Speaker 1>smelled them jail.</v>

1764
01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:57.531
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1765
01:17:57.531 --> 01:17:59.280
<v Speaker 1>You were just talking about the hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the podcast.</v>

1766
01:17:59.281 --> 01:18:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Your sense of smell is no good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

1767
01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy smelled so bad that,</v>

1768
01:18:04.971 --> 01:18:07.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was dressed fairly normal.</v>

1769
01:18:07.401 --> 01:18:09.870
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't disgustingly dressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to look at them to,</v>

1770
01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:11.450
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to recognize like,</v>

1771
01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:12.770
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's homeless.</v>

1772
01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:16.760
<v Speaker 1>I looked over and he just fucking stunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was rough.</v>

1773
01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:17.653
<v Speaker 1>I mean he just stunk and I looked over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the guy sitting there with his head </v>

1774
01:18:20.301 --> 01:18:25.301
<v Speaker 1>in his hands like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's probably just full of terrible</v>

1775
01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:30.020
<v Speaker 1>anxiety or thoughts or depression or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>

1776
01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:32.780
<v Speaker 1>but all I was thinking that important </v>
<v Speaker 1>cream in my coffee.</v>

1777
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:34.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like that when someone's a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

1778
01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:37.070
<v Speaker 1>I know someone's a little boy and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>here he is.</v>

1779
01:18:37.071 --> 01:18:41.840
<v Speaker 1>He looks like he's in his sixties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's all fucked up and smells like shit.</v>

1780
01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:42.893
<v Speaker 1>He's sitting there and this coffee bean </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's sitting by himself with his </v>

1781
01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:48.100
<v Speaker 1>head in his hands and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoiding him.</v>

1782
01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:52.240
<v Speaker 1>I'll just moving around him and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think of life like that,</v>

1783
01:18:52.241 --> 01:18:55.280
<v Speaker 1>they think of people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to be humanized.</v>

1784
01:18:55.281 --> 01:18:56.114
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like we were talking about Louis and </v>

1785
01:18:57.860 --> 01:18:58.693
<v Speaker 1>nothing like Louis again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this kid that was working the </v>

1786
01:19:00.951 --> 01:19:01.784
<v Speaker 1>brokerage and a in Long Island and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes in with his mom to see me and he </v>

1787
01:19:07.131 --> 01:19:07.964
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think what Louis did was that </v>

1788
01:19:08.931 --> 01:19:10.370
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't rape her or anything.</v>

1789
01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:11.204
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1790
01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:12.860
<v Speaker 1>it would be better if he did it to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sister.</v>

1791
01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.090
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd fucking kill him.</v>

1792
01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:15.290
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1793
01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:17.900
<v Speaker 1>that should tell you something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't kill him for that,</v>

1794
01:19:17.901 --> 01:19:20.660
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it bothers you enough.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's somebody else's sister know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1796
01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Louis apologized and I'm not trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>jump on him again,</v>

1797
01:19:27.641 --> 01:19:30.830
<v Speaker 1>but I mean you got to know how you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel about it when it was personal.</v>

1798
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think the Olympics are gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why I think the Olympics are </v>

1847
01:21:53.111 --> 01:21:54.810
<v Speaker 3>gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a great opportunity for all</v>

1848
01:21:54.811 --> 01:21:55.644
<v Speaker 3>those athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's great for people to watch </v>

1849
01:21:56.821 --> 01:21:57.654
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it is a fucking disgusting </v>

1850
01:21:59.611 --> 01:22:02.370
<v Speaker 3>money grab and all those amateur air </v>
<v Speaker 3>quotes.</v>

1851
01:22:02.371 --> 01:22:03.204
<v Speaker 3>Athletes don't get paid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these companies are making billions </v>

1852
01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:09.480
<v Speaker 3>and billions of dollars off of them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I really wish they would all quit.</v>

1853
01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:12.150
<v Speaker 3>I really wish they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you pay me.</v>

1854
01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:16.410
<v Speaker 3>I really wish they would just go </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight ray Liotta they give you pain.</v>

1855
01:22:16.411 --> 01:22:17.670
<v Speaker 3>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get up there.</v>

1856
01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:19.860
<v Speaker 3>They're youth for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

1857
01:22:20.130 --> 01:22:23.040
<v Speaker 3>the fucking companies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so restrictive,</v>

1858
01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:23.993
<v Speaker 3>the IOC and all the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind it are so restrictive and they </v>

1859
01:22:27.871 --> 01:22:32.670
<v Speaker 3>are making ungodly sums of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ungodly contracts.</v>

1860
01:22:32.671 --> 01:22:35.700
<v Speaker 3>They're just giant contracts to air the </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Olympics.</v>

1861
01:22:36.030 --> 01:22:36.863
<v Speaker 3>Giant amounts of money to build these </v>
<v Speaker 3>stadiums and set up these are these </v>

1862
01:22:40.111 --> 01:22:44.130
<v Speaker 3>events and that everything is about net </v>
<v Speaker 3>nationalism and national pride.</v>

1863
01:22:44.131 --> 01:22:47.100
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's in Korea or Russia or </v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever the fuck they do them.</v>

1864
01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.160
<v Speaker 3>But meanwhile the athletes don't get </v>
<v Speaker 3>dick.</v>

1865
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:51.143
<v Speaker 3>They don't get Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're lucky and you're Michael </v>

<v Speaker 3>bronze last night or two nights before </v>

<v Speaker 3>the real famous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's Lindsey Vonn.</v>

<v Speaker 3>her famous two plus.</v>

<v Speaker 3>She was a gold medal winner I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many other ones are there?</v>

1885
01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:43.720
<v Speaker 3>So few.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just like a handful.</v>

1886
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:45.910
<v Speaker 3>They can build a story around someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they can sell the story,</v>

1887
01:23:45.911 --> 01:23:48.610
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you get to the point where it's</v>

1888
01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:53.650
<v Speaker 3>worthwhile to sacrifice your entire life</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it actually pays off,</v>

1889
01:23:53.770 --> 01:23:55.090
<v Speaker 3>what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the odds?</v>

1890
01:23:55.090 --> 01:23:55.923

<v Speaker 3>but meanwhile people are tuning in to </v>

1891
01:23:59.321 --> 01:24:00.154
<v Speaker 3>all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the making massive amounts of revenue </v>

1892
01:24:02.381 --> 01:24:05.320
<v Speaker 3>from all of it and they're not sharing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it with the athletes at all.</v>

1893
01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:08.290
<v Speaker 3>I think it's fucking gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pretend it's amateur.</v>

1894
01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:12.580

<v Speaker 3>It's a Goddamn motherfucking business.</v>

1895
01:24:12.670 --> 01:24:15.900

<v Speaker 3>Sensible college business.</v>

<v Speaker 3>paid because the 13th amendment allows </v>

1898
01:24:25.001 --> 01:24:28.270
<v Speaker 3>unpaid prison labor.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Did they really say that?</v>

1904
01:24:38.351 --> 01:24:42.400
<v Speaker 3>The 13th amendment which allows unpaid </v>
<v Speaker 3>prison labor decided in a lawsuit,</v>

1905
01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:45.520
<v Speaker 3>a response to a motion to dismiss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they use is.</v>

1906
01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:48.250
<v Speaker 3>It's so disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so disgusting.</v>

<v Speaker 3>sharing it with the athletes.</v>

1913
01:25:03.130 --> 01:25:06.010
<v Speaker 3>They might as well be slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might as well be fucking prisoners,</v>

1948
01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:34.063
<v Speaker 3>I tried out for the national team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got into like the quarter finals in </v>

1949
01:26:36.471 --> 01:26:39.590
<v Speaker 3>Miami.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won three fights and it was,</v>

1950
01:26:39.591 --> 01:26:41.960
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the last,</v>

1951
01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.380
<v Speaker 3>like my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my last,</v>

1952
01:26:44.381 --> 01:26:45.214
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my really last fascination with </v>

1953
01:26:48.321 --> 01:26:50.200
<v Speaker 3>taekwondo had kind of given up on </v>
<v Speaker 3>taekwondo.</v>

1954
01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:51.073
<v Speaker 3>Really before it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd started kickboxing ready and I </v>

1955
01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:56.770
<v Speaker 3>realized the limitations of taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

1956
01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:59.390
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hands punching to the face.</v>

1957
01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:00.830
<v Speaker 3>Taekwondo window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't punch the face.</v>

1958
01:27:00.831 --> 01:27:03.290
<v Speaker 3>He punched the body and you kick to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>face and kick to the body,</v>

1959
01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:04.850
<v Speaker 3>which is the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1960
01:27:04.851 --> 01:27:05.684
<v Speaker 3>it's a very different thing because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>so easy to punch someone in the face </v>

1961
01:27:08.811 --> 01:27:11.330
<v Speaker 3>comparatively and so hard to kick </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone in the face,</v>

1962
01:27:11.690 --> 01:27:14.600
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dexterity of the legs,</v>

1963
01:27:14.601 --> 01:27:15.434
<v Speaker 3>like for people that know how to kick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just you develop much more leg </v>

1964
01:27:18.891 --> 01:27:22.490
<v Speaker 3>dexterity and you get way better at </v>
<v Speaker 3>kicking and moving your legs,</v>

1965
01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:27.970
<v Speaker 3>but as soon as you fight a good boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize how poor the.</v>

1966
01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:29.353
<v Speaker 3>Like the balances between your hands and</v>
<v Speaker 3>your feet and I had a really develop my </v>

1967
01:27:31.851 --> 01:27:36.560
<v Speaker 3>hand techniques and so I was really </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrating on boxing at that point in</v>

1968
01:27:36.561 --> 01:27:37.394
<v Speaker 3>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like really learning how to box and </v>

1969
01:27:38.601 --> 01:27:39.434
<v Speaker 3>learning how to punch correctly and </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning how to put kicks together with </v>

1970
01:27:42.171 --> 01:27:43.004
<v Speaker 3>punches because you just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of stuff that you can </v>

1971
01:27:44.691 --> 01:27:45.524
<v Speaker 3>get away with if someone's not punching </v>
<v Speaker 3>you in the face that you can't get away </v>

1972
01:27:48.141 --> 01:27:49.610
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as they start doing it.</v>

1973
01:27:49.730 --> 01:27:52.280
<v Speaker 3>And I was already kind of disillusioned </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was learning.</v>

1974
01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:53.593
<v Speaker 3>I was just learning that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a very flawed and then I started </v>

1975
01:27:55.071 --> 01:27:59.780
<v Speaker 3>doing more tie with leg kicks and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>realized like when Jesus Christ,</v>

1976
01:27:59.781 --> 01:28:01.940
<v Speaker 3>like as soon as you kick the legs like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1977
01:28:01.970 --> 01:28:04.320
<v Speaker 3>most of this shit's out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1978
01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:05.810
<v Speaker 3>It changes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's a,</v>

1979
01:28:06.150 --> 01:28:07.850
<v Speaker 3>what you can and can't get away with.</v>

1980
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.510
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is the most lethal </v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts,</v>

1981
01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:15.570
<v Speaker 3>the best martial art to learn for </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone for self defense or even plating</v>

1982
01:28:15.571 --> 01:28:16.600
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put them in the fight.</v>

1983
01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:21.410
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to beat wrestling because </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling you dictate whether or not the</v>

1984
01:28:21.411 --> 01:28:24.340
<v Speaker 3>fight stays or goes to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're wrestling is like,</v>

1985
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:25.880
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best base,</v>

1986
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:30.050
<v Speaker 3>but once you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you've passed that,</v>

1987
01:28:30.051 --> 01:28:30.884
<v Speaker 3>then it's about submissions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's wrestling and then submissions </v>

1988
01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:34.213
<v Speaker 3>because if a guy has wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can take you to the ground and punch </v>

1989
01:28:35.991 --> 01:28:36.824
<v Speaker 3>in the face and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if the guy on the bottom is good at </v>

1990
01:28:39.261 --> 01:28:40.094
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might still be able to submit you </v>

1991
01:28:41.031 --> 01:28:41.864
<v Speaker 3>like the early ufc days hoists gracie </v>
<v Speaker 3>submitted much larger people like Dan </v>

1992
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:45.823
<v Speaker 3>Severn off of his back and Dan Severn </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a real world class wrestler at the </v>

1993
01:28:48.951 --> 01:28:49.784
<v Speaker 3>time and the hoists submitted them off </v>
<v Speaker 3>his back with a Jujitsu because he </v>

1994
01:28:52.641 --> 01:28:55.640
<v Speaker 3>didn't know Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think wrestling,</v>

1995
01:28:55.670 --> 01:28:58.010
<v Speaker 3>the ability to take someone down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably number one,</v>

1996
01:28:58.011 --> 01:29:02.910
<v Speaker 3>but Jujitsu is a very close second </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the problem with Jujitsu is if a</v>

1997
01:29:02.911 --> 01:29:05.360
<v Speaker 3>guy knows how to wrestle really good and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can keep you standing up,</v>

1998
01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:06.213
<v Speaker 3>if he's better at punching and kicking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could fuck you up standing up and </v>

1999
01:29:08.521 --> 01:29:09.354
<v Speaker 3>you'll never get the fight to the ground</v>
<v Speaker 3>to use your Jujitsu because his </v>

2000
01:29:11.191 --> 01:29:13.470
<v Speaker 3>wrestling could also keep the fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>standing.</v>

2001
01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:15.960
<v Speaker 3>The wrestling dictates where the fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>takes place.</v>

2002
01:29:16.170 --> 01:29:18.240
<v Speaker 3>That to me is the most critical thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you have.</v>

2003
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:19.303
<v Speaker 3>If you're a wrestle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the ability to take someone </v>

2004
01:29:20.341 --> 01:29:22.530
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the ability to stand up and you</v>

2005
01:29:22.531 --> 01:29:24.390
<v Speaker 3>have to ability to keep someone from </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking you down.</v>

2006
01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:26.640
<v Speaker 3>Those are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are giant like that.</v>

2007
01:29:26.730 --> 01:29:29.850
<v Speaker 3>To be able to choose where the fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>takes place is giant.</v>

2008
01:29:30.570 --> 01:29:32.520
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when I was doing taekwondo,</v>

2009
01:29:32.521 --> 01:29:35.610
<v Speaker 3>there was really no mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one had ever even invented it.</v>

2010
01:29:36.090 --> 01:29:39.090
<v Speaker 3>I stopped fighting and 88,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think 88 or 89.</v>

2011
01:29:39.150 --> 01:29:41.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm not exactly sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing comedy at the time too.</v>

2012
01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:47.100
<v Speaker 3>When did you say we met?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We met in [inaudible] 93,</v>

2013
01:29:47.101 --> 01:29:47.934
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or [inaudible] 92 might have been </v>

2014
01:29:48.811 --> 01:29:51.810
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 92.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was probably with Kim at the time.</v>

2015
01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:52.830
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2016
01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:55.170
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2017
01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:56.760
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2018
01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:00.490
<v Speaker 3>I was done fighting then I was done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was still thinking about it.</v>

2019
01:30:00.491 --> 01:30:02.670
<v Speaker 3>I was still thinking about it for years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2020
01:30:02.671 --> 01:30:04.290
<v Speaker 3>if everything went wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>call me,</v>

2021
01:30:04.291 --> 01:30:06.330
<v Speaker 3>fell apart for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'd take a fight,</v>

2022
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:07.833
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did you know the comedy wasn't </v>

2023
01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:12.060
<v Speaker 3>going to pull up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A couple weeks ago.</v>

2024
01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was driving one of my car,</v>

2025
01:30:17.470 --> 01:30:19.420
<v Speaker 1>I was driving my car over to the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>

2026
01:30:20.450 --> 01:30:21.960
<v Speaker 3>white workout,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sell all this.</v>

2027
01:30:22.010 --> 01:30:24.390
<v Speaker 3>Just live modestly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2028
01:30:24.450 --> 01:30:25.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2029
01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:26.940
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>its really.</v>

2030
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.863
<v Speaker 3>I've written,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really didn't think I was gonna work </v>

2031
01:30:28.561 --> 01:30:30.810
<v Speaker 3>out until I was on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2032
01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:31.981
<v Speaker 3>men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2033
01:30:31.981 --> 01:30:32.940
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this might be all right.</v>

2034
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's a good thing though,</v>

2035
01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:39.660
<v Speaker 3>that not knowing if it's gonna work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what keeps you hungry.</v>

2036
01:30:39.930 --> 01:30:40.763
<v Speaker 3>I think the worst thing in life could </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever happen and she's getting an </v>

2037
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
<v Speaker 3>inheritance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>GotTa texts the incentive away.</v>

2038
01:30:45.070 --> 01:30:46.200
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2039
01:30:46.270 --> 01:30:47.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not scared.</v>

2040
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:48.833
<v Speaker 3>You're not scared about the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not scared about what the fuck's </v>

2041
01:30:50.190 --> 01:30:51.023
<v Speaker 3>going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have that feeling of not </v>

2042
01:30:54.091 --> 01:30:57.040
<v Speaker 3>knowing is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>

2043
01:30:57.041 --> 01:31:00.780
<v Speaker 3>that feeling creates movement and </v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety and energy.</v>

2044
01:31:00.781 --> 01:31:03.910
<v Speaker 3>Like some of my best sets I've ever had </v>
<v Speaker 3>in my,</v>

2045
01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:08.070
<v Speaker 3>the biggest jumps I've ever had in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life and my career have been after I had</v>

2046
01:31:08.071 --> 01:31:08.904
<v Speaker 3>terrible sets and some of my best </v>
<v Speaker 3>moments in life as a person have been </v>

2047
01:31:13.111 --> 01:31:16.920
<v Speaker 3>after I felt terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like after I just fuck something up or I</v>

2048
01:31:16.921 --> 01:31:19.860
<v Speaker 3>did something stupid and I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can I do that?</v>

2049
01:31:19.861 --> 01:31:21.060
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is wrong with me?</v>

2050
01:31:21.061 --> 01:31:21.894
<v Speaker 3>And then you feel like shit for a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>days and then you emerge out of it like </v>

2051
01:31:24.391 --> 01:31:25.224
<v Speaker 3>a phoenix from the ashes and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a better person because of that </v>

2052
01:31:27.811 --> 01:31:30.540
<v Speaker 3>bad feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like those bad moments,</v>

2053
01:31:30.541 --> 01:31:34.200
<v Speaker 3>like don't just drowned them out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't take pills,</v>

2054
01:31:34.201 --> 01:31:35.270
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't just drowned them out.</v>

2055
01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:36.203
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes those bad moments are an </v>
<v Speaker 3>incentive for you to move forward and </v>

2056
01:31:39.631 --> 01:31:40.464
<v Speaker 3>progress.</v>

2057
01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:43.210
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I did the tonight show </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time,</v>

2058
01:31:43.211 --> 01:31:45.800
<v Speaker 1>it was not fun because it was like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>imprimatur.</v>

2059
01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Who's like Johnny Carson?</v>

<v Speaker 1>magical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said he went to the comedy </v>

2082
01:32:44.021 --> 01:32:44.854
<v Speaker 1>store that night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got fucked out of his head and was </v>

2083
01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:47.133
<v Speaker 1>stumbling into the streets and just out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his mind just had a problem with </v>

2084
01:32:49.781 --> 01:32:50.890
<v Speaker 1>substances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2085
01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:51.733
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember he was so drunk that we were </v>

2086
01:32:54.911 --> 01:32:58.600
<v Speaker 1>at a club in Long Island and he sat on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the edge of the stage and started crying</v>

2087
01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:01.600
<v Speaker 1>and the audience thought that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking around.</v>

2088
01:33:01.630 --> 01:33:04.040
<v Speaker 1>So they all started laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

2089
01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:05.710
<v Speaker 1>can you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's hilarious.</v>

2090
01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:07.780
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his is set on the tonight show.</v>

2091
01:33:07.810 --> 01:33:08.643
<v Speaker 1>This is what I was told.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did so much overtime that they had </v>

2092
01:33:11.381 --> 01:33:13.780
<v Speaker 1>the bump somebody and that's why he went</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the couch.</v>

2093
01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't he went to the couch because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was so great.</v>

2094
01:33:16.211 --> 01:33:17.044
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he never did the show again as far </v>

2095
01:33:19.451 --> 01:33:20.284
<v Speaker 1>as I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he never did the show again because </v>

2096
01:33:22.391 --> 01:33:25.600
<v Speaker 1>he fucked something up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he got drunk and he did this.</v>

2097
01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:27.670
<v Speaker 1>He did way too much time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

2098
01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they loved him.</v>

2099
01:33:29.201 --> 01:33:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Like johnny was loving him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how could he not?</v>

2100
01:33:31.001 --> 01:33:31.834
<v Speaker 1>Johnny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny was very supportive of mostly </v>

2101
01:33:33.401 --> 01:33:35.210
<v Speaker 1>everybody you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was,</v>

2102
01:33:35.211 --> 01:33:36.044
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't Howard stern hate Johnny Carson </v>

2103
01:33:37.981 --> 01:33:38.814
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he really?</v>

2104
01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.990
<v Speaker 1>I think he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he hated him.</v>

2105
01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember him talking about Johnny</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carson being a terrible person,</v>

2106
01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:46.870
<v Speaker 1>a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2107
01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:48.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope I'm not wrong with that.</v>

2108
01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:53.240
<v Speaker 1>The most nervous I ever got ever for </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing anything was doing stern.</v>

2109
01:33:53.630 --> 01:33:54.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was terrified because you wanted to </v>

01:33:59.770 --> 01:34:03.340
<v Speaker 1>he was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was my generation's Johnny Carson.</v>

2112
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I didn't give a fuck about being</v>

2113
01:34:05.171 --> 01:34:07.320
<v Speaker 1>on the tonight show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me I was,</v>

2114
01:34:07.321 --> 01:34:09.550
<v Speaker 1>I was a dirty comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cared about.</v>

2115
01:34:09.610 --> 01:34:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I never thought I'd be on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2116
01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:12.453
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like guys like Hicks and Kennison and </v>

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:19.960
<v Speaker 1>dice and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and prior and that's not that tonight.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed watching like Jenny on.</v>

2119
01:34:22.361 --> 01:34:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Are you on or someone who's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who could do that style and do it really</v>

2120
01:34:25.901 --> 01:34:26.734
<v Speaker 1>well though it was really hard for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather do Improv but used to do it </v>

2121
01:34:29.501 --> 01:34:31.410
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were great on those shows.</v>

2122
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:32.263
<v Speaker 1>I tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not you like at the comedy </v>

2123
01:34:34.661 --> 01:34:35.850
<v Speaker 1>store killing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2124
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:37.760

<v Speaker 1>It's a different thing.</v>

2125
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:40.210
<v Speaker 1>This was never attracted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to me,</v>

2126
01:34:40.510 --> 01:34:42.850
<v Speaker 1>the five minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the censorship,</v>

2127
01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:45.280
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff is just like it.</v>

2128
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:46.343
<v Speaker 1>It didn't mean anything to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always think the coolest thing about </v>

2129
01:34:47.951 --> 01:34:50.290
<v Speaker 1>your career is you did what you wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

2130
01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:52.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you basically,</v>

2131
01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:53.573
<v Speaker 1>you did a sitcom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did like liquid through the career </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's bizarre.</v>
