1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.660
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:02.201
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3
00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:05.440
<v Speaker 1>I think Obama is about to give a speech today about this nonsense.</v>

4
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:06.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:06.970
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

6
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.440
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

7
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.580
<v Speaker 2>even CNN,</v>

8
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.420
<v Speaker 2>the front of it is like Obama's challenge convincing you on Syria.</v>

9
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.690
<v Speaker 2>It's 0% of the public thinks we should do it.</v>

10
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen one person argue that we should attack Syria.</v>

11
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.590
<v Speaker 2>Literally my mom even said she didn't want to go to war and she was always</v>

12
00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:23.850
<v Speaker 2>backing up all the other words.</v>

13
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.500
<v Speaker 2>I think people are just learning.</v>

14
00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 2>It's just we've been hoarse,</v>

15
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 2>fucked for so many years now.</v>

16
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 2>We've been horse fuck since 2001 I mean that's really hard to believe.</v>

17
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to believe that it's been 12 years of horse fucking the whole</v>

18
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 2>world's been horse fucked and at this point time,</v>

19
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:44.361
<v Speaker 2>especially with this second term of this supposedly liberal and ordering drone</v>

20
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 2>strikes like crazy threatening military action for this one.</v>

21
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Ambiguous.</v>

22
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.731
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

23
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:52.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who the fuck cause that strike,</v>

24
00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:56.340
<v Speaker 2>but I know Ron Paul says that it was a false flag is Ron Paul,</v>

25
00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

26
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.200
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck do I know?</v>

27
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.520
<v Speaker 2>But if somebody wanted us to go to Syria for some other reason and they decided</v>

28
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 2>to orchestrate and attack,</v>

29
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:07.140
<v Speaker 2>that would force the United States hand and to going into Syria.</v>

30
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.921
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

31
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:08.131
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

32
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 2>that's possible.</v>

33
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.800
<v Speaker 2>If you don't pay attention to history,</v>

34
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.210
<v Speaker 2>you might think it's not possible.</v>

35
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 2>But if you do pay attention to history,</v>

36
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.400
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

37
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.233
<v Speaker 2>it's happened.</v>

38
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.300
<v Speaker 2>It happened with the Gulf of Tonkin [inaudible] it,</v>

39
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.720
<v Speaker 2>and that was even Shaker.</v>

40
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.800
<v Speaker 2>There was even faker than this.</v>

41
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.991
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:01:19.991 --> 00:01:21.520
<v Speaker 1>look from the Pov of,</v>

43
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.601
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

45
00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:27.601
<v Speaker 1>some are revolutionary fundamentalist Islamic,</v>

46
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.503
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.790
<v Speaker 1>person who's planning these attacks.</v>

48
00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:31.450
<v Speaker 1>We know that,</v>

49
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.220
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people,</v>

51
00:01:33.221 --> 00:01:33.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.100
<v Speaker 1>people who are fundamentalist Islamic,</v>

53
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 1>wha what we call terrorists,</v>

54
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.560
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a problem putting dynamite in their body and blowing themselves</v>

55
00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:41.771
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

56
00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:46.720
<v Speaker 1>So it's not beyond the Pale to think that in the scheme of things,</v>

57
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.260
<v Speaker 1>once they realize if they do a serin attack,</v>

58
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.500
<v Speaker 1>it could possibly cause the United States to attack and unleash hell on Assad.</v>

59
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.111
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

60
00:01:56.111 --> 00:01:56.471
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

61
00:01:56.471 --> 00:01:58.090
<v Speaker 1>that's a logical decision to make.</v>

62
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.620
<v Speaker 1>And why would a sod knowing that if he did a chemical attack,</v>

63
00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:03.670
<v Speaker 1>it could cause the,</v>

64
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.780
<v Speaker 1>all the gains he's made in his shitty Goddamn a civil war to go away.</v>

65
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Why would he do that?</v>

66
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.170
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't make any sense and easy.</v>

67
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

68
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 1>he seems,</v>

69
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.120
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a vicious piece of shit from what I've read,</v>

70
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.710
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't seem stupid.</v>

71
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.420
<v Speaker 1>And apparently he was already kind of winning that war as are making great</v>

72
00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:23.260
<v Speaker 1>advances,</v>

73
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:25.180
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know why suddenly he's like,</v>

75
00:02:25.181 --> 00:02:25.351
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

76
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:26.410
<v Speaker 1>I released the gas,</v>

77
00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:30.210
<v Speaker 1>the gas that will make it so that we get in a super power to stop bump,</v>

78
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:30.940
<v Speaker 1>start bombing us.</v>

79
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.560
<v Speaker 1>And who was he fighting against?</v>

80
00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Isn't he fighting against the Taliban?</v>

81
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.441
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

82
00:02:35.441 --> 00:02:37.240
<v Speaker 1>well it's a may fight against al Qaeda.</v>

83
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:38.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not just al Qaeda.</v>

84
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.041
<v Speaker 1>It's a mixture.</v>

85
00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:39.671
<v Speaker 1>From what I saw,</v>

86
00:02:39.671 --> 00:02:40.240
<v Speaker 1>there was this,</v>

87
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.601
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

88
00:02:40.601 --> 00:02:41.321
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember,</v>

89
00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:41.710
<v Speaker 1>it was on,</v>

90
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.890
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't on scene and it was on one of these weird news channels.</v>

91
00:02:44.891 --> 00:02:49.630
<v Speaker 1>It was just a conference with a Po analysts talking about what Syria,</v>

92
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.870
<v Speaker 1>what the revolution or the civil wars comprised of.</v>

93
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.430
<v Speaker 1>And it's not all al Qaeda.</v>

94
00:02:54.431 --> 00:02:56.530
<v Speaker 1>And it's not all Taliban and it's not all,</v>

95
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.700
<v Speaker 1>it's different.</v>

96
00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:58.990
<v Speaker 1>It's different groups.</v>

97
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.801
<v Speaker 1>Just in the same way,</v>

98
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>if there was a revolution in the United States,</v>

99
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't just be one group.</v>

100
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't just be the tea party,</v>

101
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

102
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.390
<v Speaker 1>It would be an arc is,</v>

103
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:08.224
<v Speaker 1>it would be,</v>

104
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.213
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

105
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>you occupy wall streeters.</v>

106
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 1>It would be environmental is,</v>

107
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>it would be fundamentalist Christians.</v>

108
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what a civil war really is,</v>

109
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:22.171
<v Speaker 1>is just this shattering of people into groups with one initial main goal,</v>

110
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.410
<v Speaker 1>which is get Assad out of power and then the next,</v>

111
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 1>that's where revolution can really suck or a civil work and really suck because</v>

112
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 1>then the thing collapses on itself and they all start attacking each other.</v>

113
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that John Kerry used a fake photo to fuels Syrian war?</v>

114
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I heard him as the photo of the bodies.</v>

115
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>This is the photo.</v>

116
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a photo from 2003 from the Iraq war of a little boy jumping over these</v>

117
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>lines of bodies and he used that in a speech.</v>

118
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to beat the war drums.</v>

119
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck could he know or how could he not know,</v>

120
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 1>rather that that's a bad photo to use.</v>

121
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:56.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

122
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:56.651
<v Speaker 1>no shit,</v>

123
00:03:56.651 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

124
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.611
<v Speaker 1>Of course he knew,</v>

125
00:03:57.611 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

126
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.220
<v Speaker 1>How about McCain playing fucking video poker?</v>

127
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

128
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.830

00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 1>these are fucking sucks,</v>

130

<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

132
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about evaporating human beings and the guys so comfortable.</v>

133
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 1>These fucking playing video poker.</v>

134
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.280
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that he thinks we should go,</v>

135
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.510
<v Speaker 1>doesn't he?</v>

136
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.871

140
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>He think he's supporting it,</v>

141
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

142
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.930
<v Speaker 1>He supported like seven wards.</v>

143
00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

144
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.131

146
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 1>This is the live.</v>

147
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

148
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.871
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>

149
00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>He has to walk down a red carpet and how dramatic</v>

150
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:29.880
<v Speaker 3>my fellow Americans.</v>

151
00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:30.900
<v Speaker 3>Hello President.</v>

152
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

153
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to talk to you about Syria.</v>

154
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.630
<v Speaker 3>Oh boy.</v>

155
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.090
<v Speaker 3>Why it matters and where we go from here.</v>

156
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.940
<v Speaker 3>Over the past two years,</v>

157
00:04:38.941 --> 00:04:43.110
<v Speaker 3>what began as a series of peaceful protests against the repressive regime of</v>

158
00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:46.410
<v Speaker 3>Bashar al Assad has turned into a brutal civil war.</v>

159
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.590
<v Speaker 3>Over a hundred thousand people had been killed.</v>

160
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.760
<v Speaker 3>Millions have fled the country in that time.</v>

161
00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:57.990
<v Speaker 3>America's worked with allies to provide humanitarian support to help the</v>

162
00:04:57.991 --> 00:05:01.230
<v Speaker 3>moderate opposition and to shape a political settlement,</v>

163
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.370
<v Speaker 3>but I have resisted calls for military action because we cannot resolve someone</v>

164
00:05:07.531 --> 00:05:09.600
<v Speaker 3>else's civil war through force,</v>

165
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.620
<v Speaker 3>particularly after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan.</v>

166
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.450
<v Speaker 3>The situation profoundly changed though on August 21st when Assad's government</v>

167
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.490
<v Speaker 3>gassed to death over a thousand people,</v>

168
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.680
<v Speaker 3>including hundreds of children.</v>

169
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.700
<v Speaker 3>The images from this massacre are sickening.</v>

170
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.531
<v Speaker 3>Men,</v>

171
00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:32.310
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>

172
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.881
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>

173
00:05:32.881 --> 00:05:35.280
<v Speaker 3>lying and rose killed my poison gas.</v>

174
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.770
<v Speaker 3>Others foaming at the mouth,</v>

175
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.060
<v Speaker 3>gasping for breath,</v>

176
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.940
<v Speaker 3>father clutching his bed,</v>

177
00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 3>show him on man,</v>

178
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.780
<v Speaker 3>imploring them to get up and walk.</v>

179
00:05:44.781 --> 00:05:46.500
<v Speaker 3>It's better to set them on fire</v>

180
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.310
<v Speaker 3>and gruesome detail.</v>

181
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.360
<v Speaker 3>The of my nature of chemical weapons.</v>

182
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:53.543
<v Speaker 3>How crazy.</v>

183
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.473
<v Speaker 3>The same,</v>

184
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 3>giving these images a father clutching children like what do you do?</v>

185
00:05:59.001 --> 00:05:59.331
<v Speaker 3>Are you,</v>

186
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 3>what are you an actor?</v>

187
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.420
<v Speaker 3>Like what's with the dramatic narrative of father clutching his children?</v>

188
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 3>Babies could be your baby.</v>

189
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 3>American Gis work on the many thousands killed by deadly gas and the trenches of</v>

190
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:13.244
<v Speaker 3>Europe</v>

191
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.103
<v Speaker 3>in World War II.</v>

192
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 3>The Nazis used gassed and flicked the horror of the Holocaust.</v>

193
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:20.750
<v Speaker 3>We must use fire or not gas fire.</v>

194
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:22.910
<v Speaker 3>These weapons can kill on a mass scale.</v>

195
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.150
<v Speaker 3>What the distinction between soldier and mass chill?</v>

196
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.170
<v Speaker 3>No distinction between soldier and fn central like drones don't mean like</v>

197
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:30.621
<v Speaker 3>drones.</v>

198
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:34.930
<v Speaker 3>What about Hiroshima Teen 97 what about the 98% civilian rate?</v>

199
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.720
<v Speaker 3>Your drones have killed international agreement prohibiting the use of chemical</v>

200
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:39.170
<v Speaker 3>weapons.</v>

201
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 3>We sat him on five joints,</v>

202
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.880
<v Speaker 3>marinade on governments</v>

203
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.150
<v Speaker 3>national agreement that we shouldn't use drones because I would think that that</v>

204
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:48.490
<v Speaker 3>would be a bad thing to use to.</v>

205
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.660
<v Speaker 3>These basic rules were violated.</v>

206
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

207
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.990
<v Speaker 3>Pong with our sense of common humanity of murder.</v>

208
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.220
<v Speaker 3>No one disputes that chemical weapons were used in Syria.</v>

209
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 3>The world saw thousands of videos,</v>

210
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.840
<v Speaker 3>cell phone pictures,</v>

211
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 3>and social media accounts from the attack and humanitarian organizations told</v>

212
00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:11.510
<v Speaker 3>stories of hospitals packed with people who had symptoms of poison gas.</v>

213
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 3>Moreover,</v>

214
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.300
<v Speaker 3>we know the Assad regime was responsible in the days leading up to August 21st</v>

215
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:24.830
<v Speaker 3>we know that Assad's chemical weapons personnel prepared for an attack near an</v>

216
00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:26.960
<v Speaker 3>area where they mix serin gas.</v>

217
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.080
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine they distributed gas mess to their trial?</v>

218
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:30.711
<v Speaker 3>Paranoid.</v>

219
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:33.800
<v Speaker 3>This dude gets it and they fired rockets from a regime controlled areas.</v>

220
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:35.880
<v Speaker 3>He's killed tap dance on it.</v>

221
00:07:35.881 --> 00:07:37.200
<v Speaker 3>She had all the kids,</v>

222
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:38.190
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

223
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.470
<v Speaker 3>that's just one part of it.</v>

224
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.490
<v Speaker 3>But just imagine all the conflict that he's engaged in.</v>

225
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.170
<v Speaker 3>Mortal death,</v>

226
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.810
<v Speaker 3>con wounded all over the globe.</v>

227
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:48.031
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

228
00:07:48.031 --> 00:07:48.970
<v Speaker 3>seeing your figures.</v>

229
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.090
<v Speaker 3>It's really gross,</v>

230
00:07:50.091 --> 00:07:50.361
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

231
00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:55.100
<v Speaker 3>If you have to like work on your speech to tell people to go to war and kill it,</v>

232
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.350
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to hear what he says.</v>

233
00:07:57.351 --> 00:07:58.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't hear it that shit.</v>

234
00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:58.790
<v Speaker 3>But he said,</v>

235
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:59.541
<v Speaker 3>do you want to keep going?</v>

236
00:07:59.541 --> 00:07:59.721
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

237
00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:00.590
<v Speaker 3>I just want to know if,</v>

238
00:08:00.591 --> 00:08:02.000
<v Speaker 3>what if we're going to start bombing?</v>

239
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.420
<v Speaker 3>He's going,</v>

240
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.340
<v Speaker 3>we're start bombing.</v>

241
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.490
<v Speaker 3>He's gonna start doing something.</v>

242
00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:05.360
<v Speaker 3>I think he might say,</v>

243
00:08:05.361 --> 00:08:06.170
<v Speaker 3>we're going to cut.</v>

244
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:06.681
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

245
00:08:06.681 --> 00:08:07.340
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're right.</v>

246
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.210
<v Speaker 3>Listen to what he's saying.</v>

247
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 3>There's commit atrocities.</v>

248
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.690
<v Speaker 3>They depend upon the world to look the other way and until those horrifying</v>

249
00:08:14.691 --> 00:08:15.920
<v Speaker 3>pictures fade from memory,</v>

250
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:16.611
<v Speaker 3>what about us,</v>

251
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:17.420
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

252
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.510
<v Speaker 3>but these things happen.</v>

253
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:19.511
<v Speaker 3>We burn,</v>

254
00:08:19.511 --> 00:08:19.791
<v Speaker 3>we did.</v>

255
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.230
<v Speaker 3>The facts cannot be denied.</v>

256
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26.900
<v Speaker 3>The question now is what the United States of America and the international</v>

257
00:08:26.901 --> 00:08:29.090
<v Speaker 3>community is prepared to do about it?</v>

258
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:29.531
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

259
00:08:29.531 --> 00:08:30.950
<v Speaker 3>you mean France and Saudi Arabia's?</v>

260
00:08:30.951 --> 00:08:32.030
<v Speaker 3>What happened to those people?</v>

261
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:33.973
<v Speaker 3>For those children?</v>

262
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.740
<v Speaker 3>There's not only a violation of international law,</v>

263
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.800
<v Speaker 3>it's also a danger to our security.</v>

264
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:39.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

265
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.510
<v Speaker 3>let's call it the bombs he's going to drop,</v>

266
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:42.181
<v Speaker 3>aren't going to kill them.</v>

267
00:08:42.181 --> 00:08:43.880
<v Speaker 3>Explain why they don't kill any kids.</v>

268
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:49.650
<v Speaker 3>Two magnets going together to stop using tells innocence baby bonds as the ban</v>

269
00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:52.640
<v Speaker 3>against these weapons roads.</v>

270
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.020
<v Speaker 3>Other tyrants will have no reason to think about acquiring poison gas and using</v>

271
00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

272

<v Speaker 3>Cheese over time were troops would again face the prospect theory.</v>

273
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get some poison gas.</v>

274
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:08.860
<v Speaker 3>It could be easier if the terrorist organizations to obtain this one gets a free</v>

278
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:20.340
<v Speaker 3>Manchurian candidate would react if they have blood.</v>

279
00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:20.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

289
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that Shit's going to take a long ass time and then it's going to freak</v>

290
00:09:40.611 --> 00:09:43.400
<v Speaker 2>everybody out and it's going to be the subject of discussion tomorrow.</v>

291
00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:44.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

292
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very unfortunate that we live in this world and to listen to that,</v>

293
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:49.670
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

294
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:54.670
<v Speaker 2>to think that he could be so free in talking about this sort of moralization,</v>

295
00:09:56.571 --> 00:10:01.370
<v Speaker 2>is that a word of warfare when we've killed so many fucking people,</v>

296
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.560
<v Speaker 2>it's just really hard to believe.</v>

297
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.410
<v Speaker 2>And those numbers that we read off about deaths,</v>

298
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:07.940
<v Speaker 2>those are just drones.</v>

299
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:09.590
<v Speaker 2>That's just drone deaths.</v>

300
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:11.870
<v Speaker 2>The 98% is just drone desks.</v>

301
00:10:11.871 --> 00:10:15.050
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even factor in how many innocent people were killed in the wars in</v>

302
00:10:15.051 --> 00:10:16.460
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan and Iraq.</v>

303
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:16.911
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

304
00:10:16.911 --> 00:10:17.651
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

305
00:10:17.651 --> 00:10:17.840
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

306
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.990
<v Speaker 2>it is the hypocrisy that it's okay to kill people with fire.</v>

307
00:10:20.991 --> 00:10:22.670
<v Speaker 2>It's not okay to kill with gas.</v>

308
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:27.710
<v Speaker 2>And this being s coming out of the mouth of a man who regularly kills people</v>

309
00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:28.370
<v Speaker 2>with fire.</v>

00:12:13.881 --> 00:12:15.820
<v Speaker 1>The Lord desires blood.</v>

385
00:12:15.821 --> 00:12:18.490

387
00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:22.700
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

388
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.540
<v Speaker 4>let me look at my tattoo.</v>

389
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.950
<v Speaker 1>It was worth 90% of your butthole joke.</v>

390
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.640
<v Speaker 1>Rabo you just,</v>

391
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.230
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

392
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.660
<v Speaker 1>you just gave me great ground.</v>

393
00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.480
<v Speaker 1>I can't find this fucking thing.</v>

394
00:12:38.481 --> 00:12:39.380
<v Speaker 1>These guys yell,</v>

395
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:44.080
<v Speaker 3>members of Congress have said there's no point in simply doing a pinprick strike</v>

396
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:45.023
<v Speaker 3>pinprick.</v>

397
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:45.993
<v Speaker 3>Oh nope.</v>

398
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:50.650
<v Speaker 3>I never end up in one of its main breaks strikes the United States military</v>

399
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.120
<v Speaker 3>doesn't do pinpricks.</v>

400
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.820
<v Speaker 3>We're just going to go down there and pinch be even a limited stroke.</v>

401
00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:01.090
<v Speaker 3>No other nation can deliver and no other I talked about.</v>

402
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.450
<v Speaker 3>We shouldn't move another dictator with force and we learned from a rock the</v>

403
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:04.721
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

404
00:13:04.721 --> 00:13:07.420
<v Speaker 3>So it makes us responsible for all that comes next.</v>

405
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:13.320
<v Speaker 3>But a targeted strike can make Assad or any other dictator think twice before</v>

406
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:14.860
<v Speaker 3>using chemical weapons.</v>

407
00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:17.110
<v Speaker 3>Dictators are thinking about using chemical weapons right now.</v>

408
00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.410
<v Speaker 3>Other questions involve the dangerous or retaliation.</v>

409
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.260
<v Speaker 3>We don't dismiss any threats,</v>

410
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:27.070
<v Speaker 3>but the Assad regime does not have the ability to seriously threatened our</v>

411
00:13:27.071 --> 00:13:29.080
<v Speaker 3>military and the other.</v>

412
00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:33.650
<v Speaker 3>Any other retaliation they might seek is wine with threats that we face every</v>

413
00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:34.483
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

414
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.380
<v Speaker 3>So we're basically saying they're wheeler Assad nor his allies have any interest</v>

415
00:13:38.381 --> 00:13:42.280
<v Speaker 3>in escalation that would lead to his demise and our ally.</v>

416
00:13:42.281 --> 00:13:45.400
<v Speaker 3>Israel can defend itself with overwhelming force.</v>

417
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.280
<v Speaker 3>We just want to kill this guy shakable I'm conscious guy in the face of the</v>

418
00:13:48.281 --> 00:13:49.540
<v Speaker 3>United States of America.</v>

419
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:50.861
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

420
00:13:50.861 --> 00:13:51.430
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

421
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:54.110
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is that many of you have asked about?</v>

422
00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:55.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

423
00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:00.820
<v Speaker 3>should we get involved at all in a place that's so complicated and where there's</v>

424
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:01.870
<v Speaker 3>one person wrote to me,</v>

425
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.770
<v Speaker 3>those who come after Assad may be enemies of human rights.</v>

426
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.200
<v Speaker 3>You can write to Obama.</v>

427
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.080
<v Speaker 3>It's true that some of us odds are extremists.</v>

428
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:12.011
<v Speaker 3>He'll listen,</v>

429
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:12.521
<v Speaker 3>he'll change it.</v>

430
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:13.240
<v Speaker 3>I'll cut up,</v>

431
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.480
<v Speaker 3>will only draw strength in a more chaotic Syria.</v>

432
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:21.430
<v Speaker 3>If people there see the world doing nothing to prevent innocent civilians from</v>

433
00:14:21.431 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 3>being gassed to death,</v>

434
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:23.411
<v Speaker 3>we burned them.</v>

435
00:14:23.411 --> 00:14:27.220
<v Speaker 3>We don't guess the majority of the Syrian people and the Syrian opposition we</v>

436
00:14:27.221 --> 00:14:29.500
<v Speaker 3>work with just want to live in peace</v>

437
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:35.020
<v Speaker 3>and freedom and the day after any military action,</v>

438
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:40.030
<v Speaker 3>we would redouble our efforts to achieve a political solution that strengthens</v>

439
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.360
<v Speaker 3>those who reject the forces of tyranny and extremism.</v>

440
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Joe Biden beat me a poker.</v>

441
00:14:44.931 --> 00:14:46.220
<v Speaker 1>He used to run Raytheon.</v>

442
00:14:46.221 --> 00:14:47.670
<v Speaker 1>They sell how it Hellfire missiles,</v>

443
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.420
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

444
00:14:50.421 --> 00:14:51.680
<v Speaker 1>listen to what he said.</v>

445
00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.470
<v Speaker 3>What we're trying to stomp out is exactly what we're doing.</v>

446
00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:54.771
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

447
00:14:54.771 --> 00:14:54.911
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

448
00:14:54.911 --> 00:14:56.990
<v Speaker 3>the massive amount of hypocrisy.</v>

449
00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.640
<v Speaker 3>We should not be the world's policemen.</v>

450
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.250
<v Speaker 3>We should be the world's dragon.</v>

451
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.540
<v Speaker 3>And I have a deeply held preference for peaceful solutions.</v>

452
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:06.590
<v Speaker 3>Pull up this video.</v>

453

<v Speaker 3>my administration,</v>

455
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.010
<v Speaker 3>Syrian rebels</v>

456
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:14.440
<v Speaker 2>by street crossing.</v>

457
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:17.283
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

460
00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:24.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to find the right one.</v>

461
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:24.391

<v Speaker 2>This wasn't him poke.</v>

467
00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.390
<v Speaker 2>The Russian ghost is the video willingness to join.</v>

468
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:40.400
<v Speaker 2>If you could find it in pushing aside to give up his chemical water video.</v>

469
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.860
<v Speaker 2>The Assad regime has now admitted geyser,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

492
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.980
<v Speaker 2>And they don't even have a chance to respond.</v>

493
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:30.490
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

494
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.323
<v Speaker 2>Wash,</v>

495
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.150
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>

496
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:37.150
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to move Christ uhmm and the guy's just screaming.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Watch that again.</v>

500
00:16:40.691 --> 00:16:41.524
<v Speaker 2>Back that up again.</v>

501
00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:42.660
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

502
00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.600
<v Speaker 2>you're actually controlling it.</v>

503
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

504

<v Speaker 2>Can I do that?</v>

506
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go to another fucking war man.</v>

507
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.540
<v Speaker 2>One more time.</v>

508
00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:53.950
<v Speaker 2>We did a good job of filling the screen there,</v>

509
00:16:53.951 --> 00:16:54.280
<v Speaker 2>buddy.</v>

510
00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:54.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

511
00:16:54.521 --> 00:16:55.510
<v Speaker 2>that's actually really good.</v>

512
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:56.111
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

513
00:16:56.111 --> 00:16:57.160
<v Speaker 2>Watch this one more time.</v>

514
00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:57.821
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

515
00:16:57.821 --> 00:16:59.650
<v Speaker 2>they sort of realize it's happening.</v>

516
00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:00.671
<v Speaker 2>Like look at them,</v>

517
00:17:00.671 --> 00:17:01.870
<v Speaker 2>their body language like,</v>

518
00:17:01.871 --> 00:17:02.441
<v Speaker 2>like they're like,</v>

519
00:17:02.441 --> 00:17:02.890
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>

520
00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:03.723
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

521
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

522
00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:05.590
<v Speaker 3>Watch that stair you out the running.</v>

523
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.633
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

524
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:08.700
<v Speaker 3>Are you fucking kidding me?</v>

525
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:10.540
<v Speaker 3>That's an ethical way to blow people up.</v>

526
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.700
<v Speaker 3>It's way better than chemical.</v>

527
00:17:11.701 --> 00:17:12.820
<v Speaker 3>It's a beautiful thing.</v>

528
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:13.810
<v Speaker 3>Those guys are lucky.</v>

529
00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:16.210
<v Speaker 3>That was like being killed by an American Eagle.</v>

530
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.040
<v Speaker 3>That's like getting killed by gourmet chef.</v>

531
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.983
<v Speaker 3>Couple sprints.</v>

532
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:20.230
<v Speaker 3>So precision.</v>

533
00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.690
<v Speaker 3>The United States doesn't do American pimp for seven decades.</v>

534
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:27.430
<v Speaker 3>I have a seven.</v>

535
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:29.651
<v Speaker 3>Let's here.</v>

536
00:17:29.651 --> 00:17:30.670
<v Speaker 3>He's about to wrap it up.</v>

537
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.000
<v Speaker 3>Doing more than 40 zero international agreements.</v>

538
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.340
<v Speaker 3>It has meant enforcing them.</v>

539
00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.350
<v Speaker 3>The burdens of leadership are often heavy.</v>

540
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:44.010
<v Speaker 3>I can't get it up unless I'm Caroline because we have born them.</v>

541
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.530
<v Speaker 3>And so to my friends on the right,</v>

542
00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:48.940
<v Speaker 3>I ask you to reconcile your,</v>

543
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 3>to America's</v>

544
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:55.040
<v Speaker 2>military might with a failure to act when a cause is so plainly just,</v>

545
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:55.441
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

546
00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:56.040
<v Speaker 2>let's stop.</v>

547
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.810
<v Speaker 2>So he's probably though is he's the CEO.</v>

548
00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.970
<v Speaker 2>Is he the worst president we've ever had?</v>

549
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:05.070
<v Speaker 2>He's the most disappointing for sure because Bush was scary from the jump and he</v>

550
00:18:05.071 --> 00:18:06.540
<v Speaker 2>was scary when he was going to war.</v>

551
00:18:06.541 --> 00:18:08.550
<v Speaker 2>And it was scary when he was misspelling words.</v>

552
00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:09.900
<v Speaker 2>He was always scary.</v>

553
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.300
<v Speaker 2>But Obama was promising and now he's,</v>

554
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.193
<v Speaker 2>he's terrible.</v>

555
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:14.700
<v Speaker 2>That was awful.</v>

556
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:15.751
<v Speaker 2>That was awful.</v>

557
00:18:15.751 --> 00:18:17.160
<v Speaker 2>And it was so corny.</v>

558
00:18:17.161 --> 00:18:18.120
<v Speaker 2>It was so,</v>

559
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.280
<v Speaker 2>it was like watching that show.</v>

560
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.820
<v Speaker 2>What was that old a show that used to be on Jag?</v>

561
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:28.710
<v Speaker 2>Remember Jag was a military show on like NBC or CBS,</v>

562
00:18:28.711 --> 00:18:29.400
<v Speaker 2>CBS,</v>

563
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.233
<v Speaker 2>CBS.</v>

564
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.081
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

565
00:18:31.081 --> 00:18:31.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

566
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.810
<v Speaker 2>it was fucking real clear.</v>

567
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.890
<v Speaker 2>The good guys.</v>

568
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:35.813
<v Speaker 2>Bad guys.</v>

569
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:36.511
<v Speaker 2>Good guys.</v>

570
00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:37.344
<v Speaker 2>Always one.</v>

571
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:38.483
<v Speaker 2>Everything was,</v>

572
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.870
<v Speaker 2>it was an episode of Walker,</v>

573
00:18:39.871 --> 00:18:40.704
<v Speaker 2>Texas Ranger.</v>

574
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:41.850
<v Speaker 2>That's what that was,</v>

575
00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:43.320
<v Speaker 2>but he would just gave us,</v>

576
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.370
<v Speaker 2>I love what I really love is they try to give the illusion that there's such</v>

577
00:18:47.371 --> 00:18:48.450
<v Speaker 2>thing as a safe war.</v>

578
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.570
<v Speaker 2>That's what's really funny.</v>

579
00:18:49.571 --> 00:18:49.771
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

580
00:18:49.771 --> 00:18:52.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to stick this stick and the Hornet's nest.</v>

581
00:18:52.861 --> 00:18:54.540
<v Speaker 2>The Hornets can't fly over here.</v>

582
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.680
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be fine.</v>

583
00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.270
<v Speaker 2>There'll be no retaliation.</v>

584
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.960
<v Speaker 2>They can't even retaliate and it's no need to worry and it's the same kind of</v>

585
00:19:00.961 --> 00:19:01.794
<v Speaker 2>retaliation.</v>

586
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:03.203
<v Speaker 2>That's true,</v>

587
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:04.740
<v Speaker 2>but how crazy is that?</v>

588
00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:05.141
<v Speaker 2>How the,</v>

589
00:19:05.141 --> 00:19:07.800
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you could just retaliate and you could do that and not,</v>

590
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:09.710
<v Speaker 2>not face retaliation feet.</v>

591
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.570
<v Speaker 2>What if we attack Syria and Russia decides to put missiles,</v>

592
00:19:13.571 --> 00:19:14.404
<v Speaker 2>shields up.</v>

593
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.970
<v Speaker 2>Now what does out now we have Obama leading us in a fucking world war three</v>

594
00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:19.710
<v Speaker 2>against that crocodile Putin.</v>

595
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:21.000
<v Speaker 2>That's scary.</v>

596
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.830
<v Speaker 2>That's scary to think about,</v>

597
00:19:22.831 --> 00:19:23.190
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

598
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:24.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

599
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:24.481
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

600
00:19:24.481 --> 00:19:29.481
<v Speaker 2>I'm so disappointed in the whole way this is laid out or the whole way this is</v>

601
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:30.811
<v Speaker 2>taking place.</v>

602
00:19:30.811 --> 00:19:31.291
<v Speaker 2>Don't do that.</v>

603
00:19:31.291 --> 00:19:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Probably we're going to get flagged flagged for changing its color.</v>

604
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:34.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

605
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:36.340
<v Speaker 2>We get flagged terrorist activities.</v>

606
00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:37.590
<v Speaker 2>When you're looking at 10 lag,</v>

607
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.433
<v Speaker 2>Darwin,</v>

608
00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.020
<v Speaker 2>we're not doing anything wrong.</v>

609
00:19:40.021 --> 00:19:40.501
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it.</v>

610
00:19:40.501 --> 00:19:41.510
<v Speaker 2>I pay my taxes and</v>

611
00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.430
<v Speaker 2>protest against war.</v>

612
00:19:44.431 --> 00:19:48.420
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you support a man who would use chemicals to kill children.</v>

613
00:19:48.421 --> 00:19:49.254
<v Speaker 2>Good Polo.</v>

614
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.130
<v Speaker 2>Let's smoke them out in that funny you support the other guy.</v>

615
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.560
<v Speaker 2>If you don't think that you should fire missiles,</v>

616
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.681
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

617
00:19:55.681 --> 00:19:56.341
<v Speaker 2>now he's leaving.</v>

618
00:19:56.341 --> 00:19:57.300
<v Speaker 2>The same way came in.</v>

619
00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

620
00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Nice and dramatic that just that alone.</v>

621
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.910
<v Speaker 2>All of this ready attrical shit was orchestrated.</v>

622
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:03.540
<v Speaker 2>Folks,</v>

623
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.180
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you there are some people that are involved in this.</v>

624
00:20:06.181 --> 00:20:07.350
<v Speaker 2>There's some producers.</v>

628
00:20:10.231 --> 00:20:12.420
<v Speaker 2>that was a well planned out scene.</v>
