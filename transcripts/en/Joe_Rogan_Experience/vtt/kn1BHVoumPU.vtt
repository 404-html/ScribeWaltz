00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy to be here.</v>

2
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.470
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so happy you're here.</v>

3
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.930
<v Speaker 2>I've been reading your book and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking excellent.</v>

4
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.160
<v Speaker 2>You're a really good writer.</v>

5
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.020
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I killed myself doing that though.</v>

6
00:00:09.021 --> 00:00:10.880
<v Speaker 1>That is the hardest thing I've ever done</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my life.</v>

7
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.100
<v Speaker 1>How long did it take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That two years.</v>

8
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I got the deal,</v>

9
00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:19.991
<v Speaker 1>I had this delusional idea that it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like writing 25,000 word essays and</v>

10
00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:22.580
<v Speaker 1>this was so wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was so,</v>

11
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.160
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much harder than anything I'd ever</v>

12
00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why was it so much harder than writing</v>

13
00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:28.070
<v Speaker 1>essays?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:30.470
<v Speaker 1>when you write essays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are doing like these kinds of short</v>

15
00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:31.520
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's limited.</v>

16
00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:32.900
<v Speaker 1>You have a beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a middle and an end.</v>

17
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.030
<v Speaker 1>No characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no dialogue.</v>

18
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:36.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple narrative.</v>

19
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Where does this man like keeping a plot</v>
<v Speaker 1>together over 300 pages and then that</v>

20
00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:45.200
<v Speaker 1>plot is your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by definition has no plot.</v>

21
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

22
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

23
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

24
00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:51.470
<v Speaker 2>It hard to recall all the moments in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life and do them justice</v>

25
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.770
<v Speaker 1>so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also for,</v>

26
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.570
<v Speaker 1>for this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I work as a journalist,</v>

27
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.950
<v Speaker 1>I fact checked it as best I could and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing is more personally painful than</v>

28
00:00:59.951 --> 00:01:03.910
<v Speaker 1>fact checking the ends of various</v>
<v Speaker 1>friendships and relationships and</v>

29
00:01:03.911 --> 00:01:05.680
<v Speaker 1>realizing what a jerk you were at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

30
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can only imagine.</v>

31
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that.</v>

32
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

33
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.350
<v Speaker 1>I had a whole victimization narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that was quite the quite wrong think.</v>

34
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.130
<v Speaker 2>Probably did too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody does.</v>

35
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.540
<v Speaker 2>You know everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

36
00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:22.090
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really strange when you go back and</v>

37
00:01:22.091 --> 00:01:25.060
<v Speaker 2>talk to people that you haven't talked</v>
<v Speaker 2>to for a long time and you're like,</v>

38
00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:26.000
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is your,</v>

39
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.160
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

40
00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:30.340
<v Speaker 2>all judgments aside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just give me your version of what</v>

41
00:01:30.341 --> 00:01:32.450
<v Speaker 2>happened and I'll tell you what I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened and you know,</v>

42
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.020
<v Speaker 2>I call my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck the truth is</v>

43
00:01:35.021 --> 00:01:35.854
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

44
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this one thing where there was</v>

45
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:42.440
<v Speaker 1>this one girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she recalled something and she recalled</v>

46
00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:47.150
<v Speaker 1>it one way and then when she realized</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was actually two days later than</v>

47
00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:49.070
<v Speaker 1>she thought it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which made it look like there was an</v>

48
00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:50.930
<v Speaker 1>article she had written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which had contradicted it.</v>

49
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.030
<v Speaker 1>She kept insisting it hadn't happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

50
00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:54.470
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's your twitter.</v>

51
00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Here's my twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the twitter of the two other</v>

52
00:01:56.451 --> 00:01:58.700
<v Speaker 1>people who are at brunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the email confirming it had</v>

53
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.950
<v Speaker 1>happened on this day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally she was like,</v>

54
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.120
<v Speaker 1>I just give up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give up,</v>

55
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.103
<v Speaker 1>but I don't remember it.</v>

56
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

57
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.770
<v Speaker 2>it's very strange when people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>confronted by that fact too.</v>

58
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>

59
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:13.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a friend that I'm no longer friends</v>

60
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:14.480
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It insisted something.</v>

61
00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:16.280
<v Speaker 2>And then when my other friend jumped in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>

62
00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:17.860
<v Speaker 2>that's not what happened at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

63
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.650
<v Speaker 2>It was a psychedelic drug talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to avoid beat around the</v>

64
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm on regular radio or something.</v>

65
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.650
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

66
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 2>he was insisting that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

67
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.200
<v Speaker 2>got me on this a psychedelic drug the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first time in my,</v>

68
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.360
<v Speaker 2>my other friend was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

69
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.110
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was mine.</v>

70
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.150
<v Speaker 2>It was my drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there like,</v>

71
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:37.880
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he just sort of stopped talking</v>

72
00:02:37.881 --> 00:02:38.690
<v Speaker 2>to us,</v>

73
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.650
<v Speaker 1>just like walked off and it comes back</v>
<v Speaker 1>later with a new subject.</v>

74
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people love</v>

75
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.390
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

76
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.590
<v Speaker 2>they love somehow or another to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>glory from the past and lucky somehow or</v>

77
00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:50.600
<v Speaker 2>another it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those things that never</v>

78
00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:52.790
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of like name dropping,</v>

79
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.710
<v Speaker 2>like name dropping has never worked</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

80
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.440
<v Speaker 2>No one has ever said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really good friends with Leonardo</v>

81
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.000
<v Speaker 2>Dicaprio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And someone's gone,</v>

82
00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

83
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 3>let me give you a movie now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking amazing.</v>

84
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately people go,</v>

85
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's a name dropper.</v>

86
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or he just happens to say it.</v>

87
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 3>It happens to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a fine line,</v>

88
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 3>but everybody knows what the difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

89
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:15.950
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're a name dropper comes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can,</v>

90
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 3>you could smell it in a sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

91
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:19.900
<v Speaker 3>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes off in the air.</v>

92
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 3>So this book is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

93
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking super intimate.</v>

94
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you like just,</v>

95
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 3>just cut the skin away and open your</v>
<v Speaker 3>chest up and just the whole world could</v>

96
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 3>see your soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

97
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you peeled it out.</v>

98
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 3>I tried my best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I just wanted to do something</v>

99
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:37.370
<v Speaker 3>honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

100
00:03:37.371 --> 00:03:39.430
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely that I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

101
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't there obviously.</v>

102
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two years is a long time to write</v>

103
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:45.220
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

104
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 3>Like did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many times did you have to go back</v>

105
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 3>over it and oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like seven drafts and there's a hundred</v>

106
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 3>pages of cuts from this book too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's in another word file that I might</v>

107
00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.030
<v Speaker 3>nine seven day for other essays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was like over and over and you</v>

108
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I had never written a book</v>

109
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

110
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.210
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

111
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.520
<v Speaker 3>how much extra you right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I was like building a block</v>

112
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 3>of marble basically out of words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I had to like cut away at the</v>

113
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 3>horrible ugly block of Marble I had</v>
<v Speaker 3>made.</v>

114
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 3>And then finally something cool emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

115
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 3>They all say that all the great writers</v>
<v Speaker 3>say that like my friend Steve or always</v>

116
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:23.380
<v Speaker 3>use this quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to kill your babies.</v>

117
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

118
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.083
<v Speaker 3>That's what they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

119
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 3>That's like the common writers</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

120
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.240
<v Speaker 3>Kill your babies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you can keep your babies at</v>

121
00:04:29.241 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 3>another document and you can devote like</v>
<v Speaker 3>one essay probaby where they make sense.</v>

122
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 3>That sounds similar to stand up comedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of ways like one of the</v>

123
00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:41.530
<v Speaker 3>hardest things about comedy isn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>recognizing like I'm a bit,</v>

124
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.830
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's just too fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's too much stuff in it and you</v>

125
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:47.890
<v Speaker 3>have to figure out what to chop off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you have like these emotional</v>

126
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:49.550
<v Speaker 3>connections to these punchlines like</v>
<v Speaker 3>upon,</v>

127
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.130
<v Speaker 3>I love this part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love saying it.</v>

128
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.280
<v Speaker 3>This is like my favorite part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that favorite part doesn't</v>

129
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 3>necessarily enhance the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to kind of chip it away and</v>

130
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 3>then the whole thing will be better</v>
<v Speaker 3>without it.</v>

131
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to do.</v>

132
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:03.430
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

133
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:04.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best piece I ever,</v>

134
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 3>I've advice I ever got when I started</v>
<v Speaker 3>writing was um,</v>

135
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.870
<v Speaker 3>my friend Laurie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's that really cool journalist said</v>

136
00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:12.850
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst articles I've ever written are</v>

137
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:15.130
<v Speaker 3>the ones where I tried to say everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>about a subject.</v>

138
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:16.970
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

139
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.630
<v Speaker 3>Well you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

140
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.300
<v Speaker 3>your style is really interesting too</v>
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things that was</v>

141
00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:23.830
<v Speaker 3>really cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you've got a lot of</v>

142
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 3>illustrations that go along with these</v>
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>

143
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 3>Now are these illustrations that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>added in after the fact or the</v>

144
00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 3>illustrations that you sort of drew</v>
<v Speaker 3>while you were experiencing these</v>

145
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:37.330
<v Speaker 3>things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A few of them I drew at the time.</v>

146
00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:40.210
<v Speaker 3>Like there are some old illustrations</v>
<v Speaker 3>like from Turkey or from Paris that I</v>

147
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 3>did when I was teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some stuff from occupied,</v>

148
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.660
<v Speaker 3>but I'd say like over a hundred of them</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did new for the book.</v>

149
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.480
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a lot of extra work on top of</v>

150
00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 3>that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

151
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 3>How many days would you doing this every</v>
<v Speaker 3>day?</v>

152
00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:56.620
<v Speaker 3>Or how will you find the time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I know you're so busy doing</v>

153
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 3>journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be busy doing</v>

154
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 2>art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how'd you find the time to do this?</v>

155
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a really horrible person to be</v>

156
00:06:03.481 --> 00:06:05.470
<v Speaker 1>around for quite a few months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

157
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.170
<v Speaker 1>I have the coolest boyfriend in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

158
00:06:07.171 --> 00:06:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Thank you fred for putting up with me</v>
<v Speaker 1>during this fred,</v>

159
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.711
<v Speaker 1>Fred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fred is,</v>

160
00:06:10.711 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Fred is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

161
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.250
<v Speaker 1>I had a few things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

162
00:06:14.251 --> 00:06:18.750
<v Speaker 1>I had friends with a house in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country and they let me stay there for a</v>

163
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.850
<v Speaker 1>number of weeks and they didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet signal and a lot of it.</v>

164
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.250
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't bring any of my fun books that</v>

165
00:06:23.251 --> 00:06:24.690
<v Speaker 1>I liked to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was just stuck.</v>

166
00:06:24.691 --> 00:06:27.000
<v Speaker 1>It was just me in this fucking thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to beat each other.</v>

167
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.640
<v Speaker 1>I rented a lot of hotel rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had an an editor put a beat down on me</v>

168
00:06:32.641 --> 00:06:35.280
<v Speaker 1>and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't keep going off to other</v>

169
00:06:35.281 --> 00:06:36.960
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually have to write this book</v>

170
00:06:36.961 --> 00:06:39.630
<v Speaker 1>that I contracted you for eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at one point he was like,</v>

171
00:06:39.631 --> 00:06:42.630
<v Speaker 1>are you fleeing towards zone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't have to look at your book</v>

172
00:06:42.631 --> 00:06:43.890
<v Speaker 1>contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that how it's going?</v>

173
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.760
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think towards the end I didn't do</v>

174
00:06:49.921 --> 00:06:54.090
<v Speaker 1>anything but work on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just became this horrible like troll</v>

175
00:06:54.091 --> 00:06:57.390
<v Speaker 1>beast that didn't wash her hair and</v>
<v Speaker 1>would growl at anyone who came near</v>

176
00:06:57.391 --> 00:06:59.970
<v Speaker 1>living entirely in coffee and just made</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

177
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.863
<v Speaker 1>That was how I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

178
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.570
<v Speaker 2>That is a good way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

179
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:04.010
<v Speaker 2>If you can get somewhere without the</v>
<v Speaker 2>internet.</v>

180
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to write a lot on airplanes.</v>

181
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:08.990
<v Speaker 2>I so look forward to airplane flights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

182
00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:10.760
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm stuck in this seat.</v>

183
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 2>There's no Internet access.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what the fuck do the airlines</v>

184
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:14.970
<v Speaker 2>do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put it</v>

185
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.130
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] on the God damn planes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

186
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.330
<v Speaker 4>And then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

187
00:07:18.331 --> 00:07:20.160
<v Speaker 4>I need to see what someone says about me</v>
<v Speaker 4>on twitter.</v>

188
00:07:20.161 --> 00:07:21.600
<v Speaker 4>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone was wrong on twitter.</v>

189
00:07:21.601 --> 00:07:22.530
<v Speaker 4>I must remedy that.</v>

190
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.040
<v Speaker 2>Go on Amazon and buy a new pair of</v>
<v Speaker 2>sneakers,</v>

191
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:26.510
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

192
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.390
<v Speaker 2>It's so easy to just get distracted</v>
<v Speaker 2>nowadays.</v>

193
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:33.380
<v Speaker 2>It's just the world is becoming more and</v>
<v Speaker 2>more available,</v>

194
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.660
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're off in a cabin in the</v>

195
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:37.940
<v Speaker 2>woods with no Internet access,</v>

196
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:39.523
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

197
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.361
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your stock.</v>

198
00:07:40.361 --> 00:07:42.350
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're confronted with your own work to</v>

199
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:42.800
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

200
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so attractive.</v>

201
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.270
<v Speaker 2>That's such an attractive idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be off in a cab.</v>

202
00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:48.350
<v Speaker 2>It's so romantic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

203
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.470
<v Speaker 2>To be off in a cabin in the woods by</v>
<v Speaker 2>herself working on your,</v>

204
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.730
<v Speaker 2>your great work.</v>

205
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Except whenever I'm actually there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to like dig holes.</v>

206
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 4>It was in my arms because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

207
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.190
<v Speaker 2>there is a guy that I tweeted about</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

208
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an article that I tweeted</v>

209
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.550
<v Speaker 2>where this guy decided he wanted to live</v>
<v Speaker 2>by himself in the,</v>

210
00:08:08.551 --> 00:08:11.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a northwest territory's</v>

211
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.630
<v Speaker 2>who's going to do it for a solid year</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

212
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.140
<v Speaker 2>but he made it six months and then he</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a satellite phone.</v>

213
00:08:16.141 --> 00:08:16.891
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come get me,</v>

214
00:08:16.891 --> 00:08:20.520
<v Speaker 2>I can't fucking do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was just going crazy like by</v>

215
00:08:20.521 --> 00:08:23.550
<v Speaker 2>himself for six months and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fascinating story.</v>

216
00:08:23.551 --> 00:08:26.760
<v Speaker 2>This is the guy right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Norwegian adventurer spent six months</v>

217
00:08:26.761 --> 00:08:29.850
<v Speaker 2>alone in the north territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holderness and uh,</v>

218
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.710
<v Speaker 2>it's really cool because the guy is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is very good at describing like what</v>

219
00:08:34.711 --> 00:08:38.940
<v Speaker 2>he felt and what it was like and what he</v>
<v Speaker 2>expected versus what it was really like.</v>

220
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.460
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that he said that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought was really interesting,</v>

221
00:08:41.461 --> 00:08:44.510
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are not meant to be alone and I kind</v>

222
00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:46.620
<v Speaker 2>of feel that way too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I,</v>

223
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people romanticize this idea of being</v>

224
00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:50.850
<v Speaker 2>this hermit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's off in the woods,</v>

225
00:08:50.851 --> 00:08:51.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

226
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.120
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the monk that's out meditating in the</v>

227
00:08:54.121 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 2>forest by himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit is</v>

228
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.810
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like holding your breath.</v>

229
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of cool for a little while,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you don't,</v>

230
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.100
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to do it very long.</v>

231
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:02.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

232
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

233
00:09:03.981 --> 00:09:07.190
<v Speaker 1>it makes you go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like being in solitary things makes you</v>

234
00:09:07.191 --> 00:09:10.250
<v Speaker 1>go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recently did a really big</v>

235
00:09:10.251 --> 00:09:13.220
<v Speaker 1>investigative piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on some longterm solitary prisoners</v>

236
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.980
<v Speaker 1>and these guys like were really smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

237
00:09:15.981 --> 00:09:17.930
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

238
00:09:17.931 --> 00:09:19.040
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

239
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.560
<v Speaker 1>strong guys in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of them,</v>

240
00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:25.850
<v Speaker 1>I consider them really a genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had been in solitary for 14</v>

241
00:09:25.851 --> 00:09:26.481
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

242
00:09:26.481 --> 00:09:29.400
<v Speaker 1>14 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

243
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.640
<v Speaker 1>who is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name is Andre Jacobs.</v>

244
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.680
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was part of these group of</v>

245
00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:35.750
<v Speaker 1>whistleblowers called the Dallas six</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

246
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically they were giving information</v>

247
00:09:38.991 --> 00:09:42.860
<v Speaker 1>about guards doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm beating people up and being racist</v>

248
00:09:42.861 --> 00:09:47.861
<v Speaker 1>in this prison in PA and they're all in</v>
<v Speaker 1>solitary and the guards retaliated.</v>

249
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:53.000
<v Speaker 1>And then when one of the other guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carrington sued the Dea for,</v>

250
00:09:53.001 --> 00:09:56.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not protecting him from the guards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the da turned around and charged them</v>

251
00:09:56.901 --> 00:09:57.740
<v Speaker 1>all with rioting.</v>

252
00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.720
<v Speaker 1>And I got really into the case cause I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

253
00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.410
<v Speaker 1>this seems semantically interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you ride if you're in solitary?</v>

254
00:10:03.411 --> 00:10:06.950
<v Speaker 1>I consider riding at group activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if someone's riding in solitary,</v>

255
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.550
<v Speaker 1>he could just leave them there and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>get tired eventually and then the right</v>

256
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.490
<v Speaker 1>would be over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

257
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.580
<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He called it rioting.</v>

258
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.880
<v Speaker 1>So they're at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I uh,</v>

259
00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:17.690
<v Speaker 1>I did an investigative piece and</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually I got like video and stuff</v>

260
00:10:17.691 --> 00:10:20.600
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was bullshit and I really hope</v>

261
00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:23.240
<v Speaker 1>they're trial goes well in February,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as part of it,</v>

262
00:10:23.241 --> 00:10:25.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he spent a lot of time talking to um,</v>

263
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.520
<v Speaker 1>two of the guys and I mean you sat for</v>
<v Speaker 1>real mental trauma from doing that and</v>

264
00:10:31.671 --> 00:10:34.190
<v Speaker 1>like no one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even like the smartest,</v>

265
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.370
<v Speaker 1>toughest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>best person who has like a really loving</v>

266
00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:39.260
<v Speaker 1>mom that is really devoted to giving</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

267
00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the books and all the support,</v>

268
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.480
<v Speaker 1>even that person will suffer like real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real trauma from that.</v>

269
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've always wondered like when Bradley</v>

270
00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.460
<v Speaker 5>Manning was arrested and then later</v>
<v Speaker 5>became Chelsea manning and spent how</v>

271
00:10:51.461 --> 00:10:53.500
<v Speaker 5>many years was he?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>

272
00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.470
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whenever the transition makes sense.</v>

273
00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.980
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many years was she in solitary?</v>

274
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.830
<v Speaker 5>Like cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it was quite a long time and three</v>

275
00:11:02.831 --> 00:11:04.120
<v Speaker 5>years I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Naked.</v>

276
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Naked and in cold conditions,</v>

277
00:11:07.841 --> 00:11:12.700
<v Speaker 5>like they literally tortured her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like take tortured her.</v>

278
00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.310
<v Speaker 5>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they decided when do you,</v>

279
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:19.270
<v Speaker 5>when do you say her and when his him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause when did she decide to transition?</v>

280
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:20.540
<v Speaker 5>When she was in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

281
00:11:20.541 --> 00:11:20.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

282
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.100
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like announce the transition,</v>

283
00:11:22.101 --> 00:11:24.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right after her trial.</v>

284
00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:25.400
<v Speaker 1>But she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

285
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:28.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at her chat logs with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adrian Lamo,</v>

286
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.010
<v Speaker 1>she has one line where she says that</v>
<v Speaker 1>what she's afraid of is being known to</v>

287
00:11:31.011 --> 00:11:32.480
<v Speaker 1>the world as a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

288
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.900
<v Speaker 1>I think she decided herself along a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time ago,</v>

289
00:11:35.901 --> 00:11:37.490
<v Speaker 1>but before she was arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

290
00:11:37.491 --> 00:11:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Before she was arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that she just didn't publicly</v>

291
00:11:39.981 --> 00:11:41.940
<v Speaker 1>announce it for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a crazy,</v>

292
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.590
<v Speaker 1>the worst things to be known as a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

293
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.610
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

294
00:11:46.611 --> 00:11:47.870
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a line from the chat log.</v>

295
00:11:47.871 --> 00:11:49.280
<v Speaker 1>And anyone who's listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

296
00:11:49.281 --> 00:11:51.080
<v Speaker 1>please fact check it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get it wrong,</v>

297
00:11:51.081 --> 00:11:54.310
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I remember thinking</v>

298
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.950
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wouldn't lose their fucking mind</v>

299
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.670
<v Speaker 2>being naked in a room by herself for</v>
<v Speaker 2>years?</v>

300
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.980
<v Speaker 2>Like what did they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought that she was a,</v>

301
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:04.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hazard to ourself or something.</v>

302
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

303
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:07.300
<v Speaker 1>they're bullshit excuses where he's</v>

<v Speaker 1>nothing to read,</v>

306
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.270
<v Speaker 1>a horrible like suicide prevention</v>
<v Speaker 1>blanket that you can't like,</v>

307
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:18.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrap around you and just,</v>

308
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.920
<v Speaker 1>we have to like torture here cause he</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be a suicide risk.</v>

309
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Like is she in like regular prison now</v>
<v Speaker 1>or still in solitary?</v>

310
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.700
<v Speaker 1>She's in regular prison right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually like one of my most cherished</v>

311
00:12:30.701 --> 00:12:33.170
<v Speaker 1>possessions in the university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wrote me a letter once cause I,</v>

312
00:12:33.171 --> 00:12:37.720
<v Speaker 1>I drew a birthday card for her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She dots her i's with little doves.</v>

313
00:12:37.721 --> 00:12:39.490
<v Speaker 1>It's really cute with doves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

314
00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:41.740
<v Speaker 1>She draws little doves on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every I,</v>

315
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.840
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope this isn't a long letter now as a</v>

316
00:12:43.841 --> 00:12:45.190
<v Speaker 1>short one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that it was a gracious one.</v>

317
00:12:45.191 --> 00:12:45.641
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

318
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:46.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it reminded me of like,</v>

319
00:12:46.871 --> 00:12:48.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thank you card that like someone</v>

320
00:12:48.341 --> 00:12:49.250
<v Speaker 1>very graciously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

321
00:12:49.251 --> 00:12:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Someone who's giving them a gift.</v>

322
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.780
<v Speaker 2>But what a bizarre set of circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who was a soldier who transition</v>

323
00:12:55.781 --> 00:12:57.940
<v Speaker 2>to becoming a woman and then sends</v>
<v Speaker 2>letters at all,</v>

324
00:12:57.941 --> 00:13:01.720
<v Speaker 2>have the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the animal that's known as the symbol of</v>

325
00:13:01.721 --> 00:13:02.630
<v Speaker 2>peace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

326
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:03.940
<v Speaker 2>Over all the eyes.</v>

327
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think from her life you get the sense</v>

328
00:13:07.991 --> 00:13:10.510
<v Speaker 1>that part of the reason she wants to</v>
<v Speaker 1>join the army,</v>

329
00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:13.270
<v Speaker 1>but she's just like so smart and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>just wanted to go to college.</v>

330
00:13:13.271 --> 00:13:14.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

331
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.260
<v Speaker 1>from what I know kind of about reading</v>
<v Speaker 1>her life story like this,</v>

332
00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:22.410
<v Speaker 1>this was someone who like her happiest</v>
<v Speaker 1>time was like dating a dude who is</v>

333
00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:24.070
<v Speaker 1>around sort of like the mit hacker</v>
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>

334
00:13:24.071 --> 00:13:26.140
<v Speaker 1>And I think that if she was middle class</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not poor,</v>

335
00:13:26.141 --> 00:13:30.070
<v Speaker 1>she just would have like gone to school</v>
<v Speaker 1>and gotten a computer science degree and</v>

336
00:13:30.071 --> 00:13:33.550
<v Speaker 1>that would have been the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible that someone who exposes</v>

337
00:13:33.551 --> 00:13:34.384
<v Speaker 1>crimes</v>

338
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:36.660
<v Speaker 2>and that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the only way you could look at</v>

339
00:13:36.661 --> 00:13:39.360
<v Speaker 2>what happened with Edward Snowden end</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Bradley Manning.</v>

340
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say that they did,</v>

341
00:13:41.041 --> 00:13:44.340
<v Speaker 2>what they did was treasonous you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't really treasonous when you're</v>

342
00:13:44.341 --> 00:13:45.450
<v Speaker 2>exposing crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

343
00:13:45.451 --> 00:13:47.820
<v Speaker 2>isn't it supposed to be illegal to</v>
<v Speaker 2>commit crime?</v>

344
00:13:47.821 --> 00:13:50.520
<v Speaker 2>And if your government is doing things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are illegal,</v>

345
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.120
<v Speaker 2>isn't it your job as a patriot to expose</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things?</v>

346
00:13:54.121 --> 00:13:56.490
<v Speaker 2>Like when do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when is it not treasonous?</v>

347
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:57.321
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

348
00:13:57.321 --> 00:13:58.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of them are heroes.</v>

349
00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if no one is putting their own</v>

350
00:14:02.691 --> 00:14:06.860
<v Speaker 1>government in check,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that government will just tend to</v>

351
00:14:06.861 --> 00:14:10.550
<v Speaker 1>concentrating more and more power and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in it will concentrate to doing</v>

352
00:14:10.551 --> 00:14:14.330
<v Speaker 1>worse and worse things cause there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of supervision and there's no way</v>

353
00:14:14.331 --> 00:14:15.860
<v Speaker 1>that you can love your country and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>call it on.</v>

354
00:14:15.861 --> 00:14:18.260
<v Speaker 1>It's bullshit at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the opposite thing is</v>

355
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.330
<v Speaker 1>treason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's treason to say like,</v>

356
00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.970
<v Speaker 1>just because it's my country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any crime is justified</v>

357
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.190
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing though is so horrible</v>

358
00:14:25.191 --> 00:14:28.700
<v Speaker 2>because they're making it so that no one</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever does anything like this.</v>

359
00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:31.280
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so they make such a giant example.</v>

360
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Like Julian assange is literally like</v>
<v Speaker 2>going crazy.</v>

361
00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.780
<v Speaker 2>The staying in that one house in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in London,</v>

362
00:14:38.781 --> 00:14:42.500
<v Speaker 2>he can't leave if he leaves the arrest</v>
<v Speaker 2>him the moment he steps foot on that.</v>

363
00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Like what a crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he can get out in the balcony and</v>

364
00:14:45.291 --> 00:14:49.130
<v Speaker 2>wave to people and get a slight amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of vitamin D and then he has to go back</v>

365
00:14:49.131 --> 00:14:51.290
<v Speaker 2>inside and he's fucking trapped.</v>

366
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.710
<v Speaker 3>Snowden is hanging out with Putin and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>

367
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.800
<v Speaker 3>which is just bizarre to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So strange.</v>

368
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.080
<v Speaker 3>I watched a bizarre Putin video today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which food and video did he watch?</v>

369
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.890
<v Speaker 3>Hooten they're analyzing his gait the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way he walks.</v>

370
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.540
<v Speaker 3>So creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why don't they just admit that they</v>

371
00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:10.430
<v Speaker 3>like have a crush on him and one have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sleep over?</v>

372
00:15:10.431 --> 00:15:11.990
<v Speaker 3>That is so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

373
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.570
<v Speaker 3>well it's because he has a very specific</v>
<v Speaker 3>way of walking that's indicative of</v>

374
00:15:17.571 --> 00:15:21.610
<v Speaker 3>someone who has military training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called the gunslingers gate as I</v>

375
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.930
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did they make that term up themselves?</v>

376
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:28.220
<v Speaker 3>I guess they probably did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what he does is he swings his left</v>

377
00:15:28.221 --> 00:15:30.590
<v Speaker 3>arm but not his right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he could pull his gun out really</v>

378
00:15:30.591 --> 00:15:32.060
<v Speaker 3>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the idea.</v>

379
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:37.070
<v Speaker 3>But what's really bizarre about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>video is I didn't know how like opulent</v>

380
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.910
<v Speaker 3>wherever he is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what palace or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

381
00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.640
<v Speaker 3>Like they have these fucking ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like here it is,</v>

382
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.280
<v Speaker 3>look at these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He norm is gold doors.</v>

383
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.440
<v Speaker 3>Like let's play it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's play at Jamie.</v>

384
00:15:48.441 --> 00:15:51.590
<v Speaker 3>So he could watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you watch as he walks,</v>

385
00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:56.840
<v Speaker 3>if you notice his left arm swings</v>
<v Speaker 3>noticeably while his right arm stays</v>

386
00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.470
<v Speaker 3>relatively still in comparison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a huge contrast.</v>

387
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:04.670
<v Speaker 3>And he always does this and that's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he could shoot you in the fucking</v>

388
00:16:04.671 --> 00:16:08.960
<v Speaker 3>head quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I got someone finds out there's</v>

389
00:16:08.961 --> 00:16:12.530
<v Speaker 3>an untreated rotator cuff injury and one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the that's true,</v>

390
00:16:12.531 --> 00:16:14.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just like looking way too into it.</v>

391
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:19.400
<v Speaker 3>But apparently it's really common</v>
<v Speaker 3>amongst these guys in the Russian</v>

392
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.590
<v Speaker 3>military that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

393
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.860
<v Speaker 3>get that move to some form of political</v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

394
00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:26.930
<v Speaker 3>But what's kind of creepy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about it.</v>

395
00:16:26.931 --> 00:16:28.370
<v Speaker 3>Backing up to the beginning again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

396
00:16:28.371 --> 00:16:29.540
<v Speaker 3>please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

397
00:16:29.541 --> 00:16:32.900
<v Speaker 3>what's creepy it's about is look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>those fucking doors.</v>

398
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.920
<v Speaker 3>Like what is that like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are those God damn doors.</v>

399
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.590
<v Speaker 3>Look at all that gold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's gold.</v>

400
00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's the vestiges of being an</v>

401
00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:47.570
<v Speaker 3>imperial power where people used to</v>
<v Speaker 3>collect faberge eggs and he is,</v>

402
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:51.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is one of the most open dictators</v>

403
00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:56.840
<v Speaker 3>that you can see in modern society in</v>
<v Speaker 3>which it's supposed to be some sort of a</v>

404
00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:00.980
<v Speaker 3>democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not entirely familiar with how the</v>

405
00:17:00.981 --> 00:17:04.700
<v Speaker 3>Russians run their political system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know that he was out and then he</v>

406
00:17:04.701 --> 00:17:05.534
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

407
00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.590
<v Speaker 3>he puts some other guy and some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a puppet position and now he's back</v>

408
00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:11.400
<v Speaker 3>running the whole show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>

409
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.400
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a weird case man.</v>

410
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how he manages it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like guys like that someone</v>

411
00:17:16.791 --> 00:17:19.430
<v Speaker 3>always wants to kill them and just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it always falls apart.</v>

412
00:17:19.431 --> 00:17:22.790
<v Speaker 3>But he's managed to keep it together for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a long,</v>

413
00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:24.530
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>

414
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:25.671
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is,</v>

415
00:17:25.671 --> 00:17:26.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't say,</v>

416
00:17:26.511 --> 00:17:28.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm like super familiar with Russian</v>
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>

417
00:17:28.761 --> 00:17:31.370
<v Speaker 3>so I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might be talking bullshit,</v>

418
00:17:31.371 --> 00:17:33.470
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

419
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:35.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was the ex head of the KGB.</v>

420
00:17:35.301 --> 00:17:40.280
<v Speaker 3>Like he seems incredibly versed and</v>
<v Speaker 3>spying on people and killing people who</v>

421
00:17:40.281 --> 00:17:43.280
<v Speaker 3>are threats and maintaining his position</v>
<v Speaker 3>at all costs.</v>

422
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:44.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't just kill him.</v>

423
00:17:44.421 --> 00:17:46.130
<v Speaker 3>He kills him like openly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

424
00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.070
<v Speaker 3>Hasn't gotten down in front of their</v>
<v Speaker 3>girlfriends and stuff like that.</v>

425
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.080
<v Speaker 3>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just it massive terror tactic.</v>

426
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.940
<v Speaker 3>Who was that one guy that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

427
00:17:53.941 --> 00:17:58.740
<v Speaker 3>he was walking with his girlfriend and</v>
<v Speaker 3>his thought was that he had become so</v>

428
00:17:58.741 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 3>famous from criticizing and the Putin</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't kill him because if he did it</v>

429
00:18:02.371 --> 00:18:04.080
<v Speaker 3>would be so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

430
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:05.490
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't care.</v>

431
00:18:05.491 --> 00:18:06.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always think about,</v>

432
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.850
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a very respected,</v>

433
00:18:08.851 --> 00:18:11.220
<v Speaker 3>a journalist whose name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last name I won't pronounce cause I'll,</v>

434
00:18:11.221 --> 00:18:12.054
<v Speaker 3>I'll butcher it.</v>

435
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:13.740
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

436
00:18:13.741 --> 00:18:16.200
<v Speaker 3>she was also just like gunned down for</v>
<v Speaker 3>criticizing him.</v>

437
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's kind of happened sort or</v>

438
00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.980
<v Speaker 3>fear for theoretically at least in other</v>
<v Speaker 3>places.</v>

439
00:18:22.981 --> 00:18:27.050
<v Speaker 3>But one on one of the weird ones in</v>
<v Speaker 3>America was that Michael Hastings Guy,</v>

440
00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.500
<v Speaker 3>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>

441
00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.440
<v Speaker 3>that's still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one really freaks me out to this</v>

442
00:18:31.441 --> 00:18:33.330
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause if you don't know the story,</v>

443
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:36.870
<v Speaker 3>Michael Hastings was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's actually a ted talk,</v>

444
00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's available right now.</v>

445
00:18:38.891 --> 00:18:42.120
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a podcast called the Ted Radio Hour,</v>

446
00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:44.490
<v Speaker 3>which I listened to all the time that</v>
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>

447
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one episode called disruptive</v>

448
00:18:47.431 --> 00:18:50.070
<v Speaker 3>leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it actually focused on this general</v>

449
00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:53.700
<v Speaker 3>general mcallister.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were kind of sympathetic to him</v>

450
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.700
<v Speaker 3>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this Ted talk because,</v>

451
00:18:56.701 --> 00:18:59.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea was that he did a real</v>

452
00:18:59.311 --> 00:19:01.280
<v Speaker 3>leadership thing by stepping down and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

453
00:19:01.281 --> 00:19:06.281
<v Speaker 3>what it was was Michael Hastings had</v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten embedded in this military</v>

454
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:13.370
<v Speaker 3>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they were overseas and when the</v>

455
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.070
<v Speaker 3>volcano erupted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember that volcano in Iceland,</v>

456
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:21.090
<v Speaker 3>it erupted and it's fucked up all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>flights out of Europe and a,</v>

457
00:19:21.091 --> 00:19:23.880
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't fly from that part of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world to this part of the world.</v>

458
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.081
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

459
00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:27.480
<v Speaker 3>he got stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was supposed to be a short trip and</v>

460
00:19:27.481 --> 00:19:31.590
<v Speaker 3>he got stuck over there for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as he got closer and closer to these</v>

461
00:19:31.591 --> 00:19:33.480
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got more and more relaxed and</v>

462
00:19:33.481 --> 00:19:37.540
<v Speaker 3>they started telling jokes that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>inappropriate about like Al Gore and,</v>

463
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.630
<v Speaker 3>or Joseph Biden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

464
00:19:39.631 --> 00:19:43.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>along the lines of this,</v>

465
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.950
<v Speaker 3>this Guy Michael Hastings formulated</v>
<v Speaker 3>this article,</v>

466
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:51.600
<v Speaker 3>published it in rolling stone and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it became this sort of a national</v>

467
00:19:51.601 --> 00:19:55.610
<v Speaker 3>scandal and I believe his name is Miguel</v>
<v Speaker 3>Esta right?</v>

468
00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.300
<v Speaker 3>Is that his name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

469
00:19:57.301 --> 00:19:59.850
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was forced to step down and that's</v>

470
00:19:59.851 --> 00:20:03.480
<v Speaker 3>what the whole focus of this ted radio</v>
<v Speaker 3>hour was about was this guy,</v>

471
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.790
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking a leadership position,</v>

472
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:10.910
<v Speaker 3>a leadership point of view by deciding</v>
<v Speaker 3>that his position was not as important</v>

473
00:20:11.431 --> 00:20:13.380
<v Speaker 3>as the cause itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was just going to step down</v>

474
00:20:13.381 --> 00:20:18.381
<v Speaker 3>because he had created this environment</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it was too much controversy and he</v>

475
00:20:18.421 --> 00:20:19.890
<v Speaker 3>was upset that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

476
00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.790
<v Speaker 3>President Obama didn't ask him to stay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is what it is and that's it.</v>

477
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:27.750
<v Speaker 3>But what they don't say in this thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>was just Michael Hastings guy who was in</v>

478
00:20:27.751 --> 00:20:30.390
<v Speaker 3>this recording,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's talking about what it was like</v>

479
00:20:30.391 --> 00:20:35.391
<v Speaker 3>when he was there and he committed</v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide in one of the strangest,</v>

480
00:20:35.491 --> 00:20:39.090
<v Speaker 3>most controversial ways ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it was a suicide.</v>

481
00:20:39.091 --> 00:20:41.010
<v Speaker 3>I think it was an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

482
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:44.790
<v Speaker 3>some people think it was a suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people think it was an accident and</v>

483
00:20:44.791 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 3>that the black helicopter crew thinks</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he</v>

484
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.940
<v Speaker 2>was murdered and that what they did is</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took over the electronics in his</v>

485
00:20:51.941 --> 00:20:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Mercedes and they forced his car to</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive right into a tree at 120 miles an</v>

486
00:20:56.231 --> 00:21:00.830
<v Speaker 2>hour with no brakes and explode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And let me,</v>

487
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:04.390
<v Speaker 2>there's all this crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these crazy conspiracy theories that</v>

488
00:21:04.391 --> 00:21:09.240
<v Speaker 2>are attached to it that say that engines</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't go flying from a car like that</v>

489
00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:12.190
<v Speaker 2>unless there's a bomb involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

490
00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:13.810
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would this guy do this?</v>

491
00:21:13.811 --> 00:21:16.480
<v Speaker 2>And it is pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty trippy stuff.</v>

492
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:21.100
<v Speaker 2>And then there was claims that there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>crystal meth in his system and then he</v>

493
00:21:21.101 --> 00:21:21.581
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

494
00:21:21.581 --> 00:21:24.760
<v Speaker 2>high on drugs and he had a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs in the past.</v>

495
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.680
<v Speaker 2>But then the counter to that was people</v>
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>

496
00:21:26.681 --> 00:21:27.131
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

497
00:21:27.131 --> 00:21:29.470
<v Speaker 2>he's probably doing adderall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of writers do.</v>

498
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

499
00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the New York drug.</v>

500
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's on adderall in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>

501
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

502
00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:35.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

503
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.740
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people who were very</v>
<v Speaker 1>close to,</v>

504
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:39.190
<v Speaker 1>to Michael Hastings and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

505
00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.320
<v Speaker 1>I will say that people that I know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are very close to him think it was a</v>

506
00:21:43.321 --> 00:21:44.160
<v Speaker 1>tragic accident.</v>

507
00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.090
<v Speaker 2>They just happened to be going 120 miles</v>
<v Speaker 2>an hour on sunset boulevard.</v>

508
00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

509
00:21:49.411 --> 00:21:51.130
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for the people I know that,</v>

510
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he never hit his brakes.</v>

511
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.370
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

512
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.630
<v Speaker 1>I can't debate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

513
00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.450
<v Speaker 1>that's just what I've heard from people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from people who I'm very close to who</v>

514
00:21:58.451 --> 00:22:00.040
<v Speaker 1>are close to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that too,</v>

515
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.470
<v Speaker 2>if I was close to that dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew I was on some sort of a list.</v>

516
00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:05.900
<v Speaker 2>If you're close to that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

517
00:22:05.901 --> 00:22:06.860
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be on a list.</v>

518
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:07.661
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

519
00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:10.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean probably like if you're an</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigative journalist doing a lot of</v>

520
00:22:10.991 --> 00:22:13.360
<v Speaker 1>stuff in Iraq and Somalia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably on the list.</v>

521
00:22:13.361 --> 00:22:14.550
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

522
00:22:14.551 --> 00:22:16.090
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done Somalia stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

523
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:17.051
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

524
00:22:17.051 --> 00:22:18.940
<v Speaker 1>but like a lot of his friends were</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigative journalists.</v>

525
00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure everybody's,</v>

526
00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably on the list,</v>

527
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.470
<v Speaker 1>probably analyst for having you right</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

528
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you dude.</v>

529
00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:28.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

530
00:22:28.331 --> 00:22:30.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm adopting adopting the a in the</v>

531
00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.280
<v Speaker 1>native dialect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

532
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:35.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure we're all on lists because how</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you be interesting if you're not</v>

533
00:22:35.381 --> 00:22:36.730
<v Speaker 1>on the list?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

534
00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.820
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of like a badge of courage to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be on some sort of a list.</v>

535
00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.680
<v Speaker 2>Depends on what lists though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

536
00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:43.690
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

537
00:22:43.691 --> 00:22:46.750
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird world we live in right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a,</v>

538
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.590
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a temporary bridge right now.</v>

539
00:22:50.591 --> 00:22:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Let's go on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on where,</v>

540
00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:54.250
<v Speaker 2>where there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the NSA,</v>

541
00:22:54.251 --> 00:22:56.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fill in the blank with whatever name of</v>

542
00:22:56.711 --> 00:22:58.990
<v Speaker 2>whatever organization that's supposedly</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching over us.</v>

543
00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:02.860
<v Speaker 2>But they have a certain amount of power</v>
<v Speaker 2>to look into people that we don't have</v>

544
00:23:02.861 --> 00:23:06.760
<v Speaker 2>yet that's temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is going to come a time where this</v>

545
00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:10.300
<v Speaker 2>electronic barrier that we have in</v>
<v Speaker 2>between each other,</v>

546
00:23:10.301 --> 00:23:13.270
<v Speaker 2>it's all going to dissolve and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's going to have the same sort</v>

547
00:23:13.271 --> 00:23:16.030
<v Speaker 2>of power to spy on everybody at the NSA</v>
<v Speaker 2>has.</v>

548
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.560
<v Speaker 2>And we're just going to have to accept</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

549
00:23:17.561 --> 00:23:19.960
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be very straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be like we're all camping.</v>

550
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh okay.</v>

551
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.560
<v Speaker 1>God's going to horrifying worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We already know too much about each</v>

552
00:23:23.561 --> 00:23:24.180
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We</v>

553
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:25.050
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

554
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Was that a concern when you were writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>this book cause you empty yourself out</v>

555
00:23:30.421 --> 00:23:34.470
<v Speaker 2>in this book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you talk about sexual liaisons</v>

556
00:23:34.471 --> 00:23:36.900
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships and friendships and things</v>

557
00:23:36.901 --> 00:23:39.090
<v Speaker 2>gone wrong and was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you,</v>

558
00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.550
<v Speaker 2>when you were writing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you ever say,</v>

559
00:23:41.551 --> 00:23:44.190
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe I don't want everybody</v>

560
00:23:44.191 --> 00:23:45.890
<v Speaker 2>didn't know these things.</v>

561
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.850
<v Speaker 1>I had a few things that were like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually with actually with friendships,</v>

562
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:54.800
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately I thought that it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>more important to be honest though,</v>

563
00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:59.360
<v Speaker 1>the one thing that I did do was I felt</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it would have been really unfair if</v>

564
00:23:59.361 --> 00:24:01.490
<v Speaker 1>I had taken kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

565
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.750
<v Speaker 1>personal moments I had with someone like</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago and just like put them in a</v>

566
00:24:05.751 --> 00:24:08.930
<v Speaker 1>book and that's on that person's google</v>
<v Speaker 1>result without asking them.</v>

567
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:13.010
<v Speaker 1>So while I tried to be pretty merciless</v>
<v Speaker 1>with myself,</v>

568
00:24:13.011 --> 00:24:15.890
<v Speaker 1>with people who I'm still friends with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got their approval on what I wrote</v>

569
00:24:15.891 --> 00:24:16.760
<v Speaker 1>about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

570
00:24:16.761 --> 00:24:18.400
<v Speaker 1>that's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

571
00:24:18.401 --> 00:24:19.300
<v Speaker 1>That's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

572
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:24.080
<v Speaker 1>That would be a real good way to destroy</v>
<v Speaker 1>a friendship who started telling crazy,</v>

573
00:24:24.081 --> 00:24:26.510
<v Speaker 1>intimate stories about someone just not</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

574
00:24:26.511 --> 00:24:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not fair.</v>

575
00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:28.730
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

576
00:24:28.731 --> 00:24:31.100
<v Speaker 1>and I know that light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people disagree with that and</v>

577
00:24:31.101 --> 00:24:32.390
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're my memories.</v>

578
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.370
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's right.</v>

579
00:24:34.371 --> 00:24:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're kind of the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous one.</v>

580
00:24:35.991 --> 00:24:37.430
<v Speaker 1>It not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

581
00:24:37.431 --> 00:24:39.200
<v Speaker 1>we'll sing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My memories.</v>

582
00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:44.720
<v Speaker 1>But if you share a moment with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's kind of a group memory or</v>

583
00:24:44.721 --> 00:24:46.910
<v Speaker 1>at least a group moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

584
00:24:46.911 --> 00:24:48.620
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of kind of collectively owned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

585
00:24:48.621 --> 00:24:52.070
<v Speaker 1>I ran them by my parents also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dad's gotta be weird.</v>

586
00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.310
<v Speaker 1>That was the most terrifying thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there is the,</v>

587
00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.610
<v Speaker 1>cause I ran the parts about my parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy them,</v>

588
00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.560
<v Speaker 1>but then they hadn't read the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

589
00:25:00.561 --> 00:25:04.730
<v Speaker 1>And I had this really terrifying thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the book came out where I was like,</v>

590
00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.290
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they going to think?</v>

591
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:08.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love my parents.</v>

592
00:25:08.781 --> 00:25:11.840
<v Speaker 1>I have really supportive relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't ask for like two cooler</v>

593
00:25:11.841 --> 00:25:15.260
<v Speaker 1>people on Earth unit knew my parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But still you're always scared,</v>

594
00:25:15.261 --> 00:25:15.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

595
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.170
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's scary to show yourself like that</v>

596
00:25:18.171 --> 00:25:19.220
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they liked it.</v>

597
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.770
<v Speaker 1>They liked it mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm very happy about that.</v>

598
00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.890
<v Speaker 1>While you must have really open minded</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>

599
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.200
<v Speaker 1>My Mama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she used to be an illustrator and now</v>

600
00:25:27.201 --> 00:25:29.810
<v Speaker 1>she's mostly retired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She works kind of as a babysitter slash</v>

601
00:25:29.811 --> 00:25:33.470
<v Speaker 1>cats that are now and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad and my dad's an academic.</v>

602
00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

603
00:25:34.761 --> 00:25:37.610
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you seem obviously have some intelligent</v>

604
00:25:37.611 --> 00:25:40.040
<v Speaker 1>open minded parents so they've got to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>really proud of you cause this is</v>

605
00:25:40.041 --> 00:25:41.810
<v Speaker 1>excellent stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much.</v>

606
00:25:41.811 --> 00:25:42.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really are.</v>

607
00:25:42.891 --> 00:25:46.340
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was cool because I got to talk about</v>

608
00:25:46.341 --> 00:25:49.040
<v Speaker 1>how both of them influenced me so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>

609
00:25:49.041 --> 00:25:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally different ways.</v>

610
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Like my mom is an amazing artist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

611
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.660
<v Speaker 1>she trusts so beautifully and she draws</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like me.</v>

612
00:25:56.661 --> 00:26:00.130
<v Speaker 1>If I was a less bitter and jagged person</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

613
00:26:00.131 --> 00:26:04.370
<v Speaker 1>like she drives like the sweet me and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was able to say like,</v>

614
00:26:04.371 --> 00:26:06.170
<v Speaker 1>this is how my mom taught me how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>draw.</v>

615
00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:07.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how she inspired me.</v>

616
00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.640
<v Speaker 1>You've got some great people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>reviewed this too,</v>

617
00:26:10.641 --> 00:26:12.800
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got Matt Taibbi to review this.</v>

618
00:26:12.801 --> 00:26:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Patton Oswald reviewed this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is really fucking impressive</v>

619
00:26:17.151 --> 00:26:18.260
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

620
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:19.580
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's awesome.</v>

621
00:26:19.581 --> 00:26:24.581
<v Speaker 1>He actually interviewed me for my book</v>
<v Speaker 1>launch in New York and I grew up reading</v>

622
00:26:25.011 --> 00:26:25.401
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

623
00:26:25.401 --> 00:26:28.390
<v Speaker 1>I was reading like the exile when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 and I,</v>

624
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:33.170
<v Speaker 1>I love his stuff in New York press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I love about Matt's work is</v>

625
00:26:33.171 --> 00:26:36.590
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of journalists like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like these really like narrow</v>

626
00:26:36.591 --> 00:26:38.390
<v Speaker 1>professional people that are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very serious.</v>

627
00:26:38.391 --> 00:26:43.100
<v Speaker 1>And Matt was like this total wild man</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was yelling and now he does this</v>

628
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.650
<v Speaker 1>incredible investigative journalism on</v>
<v Speaker 1>finance and politics,</v>

629
00:26:46.651 --> 00:26:49.560
<v Speaker 1>but he still writes like a real person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He still writes and that kind of hunter</v>

630
00:26:49.561 --> 00:26:51.450
<v Speaker 1>s Thompson tone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly,</v>

631
00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:55.270
<v Speaker 5>I was going to describe it like a lucid</v>
<v Speaker 5>hunters Thompson.</v>

632
00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.010
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this drug addled</v>

633
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.591
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

634
00:26:57.591 --> 00:27:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Best of hunter s Thompson and less</v>
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic bit and we know much less</v>

635
00:27:01.161 --> 00:27:03.860
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was so influential on me cause I</v>

636
00:27:03.861 --> 00:27:04.880
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

637
00:27:04.881 --> 00:27:09.290
<v Speaker 1>you can totally be this bad ass</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigative journalist and you could</v>

638
00:27:09.291 --> 00:27:13.700
<v Speaker 1>also be this guy who when he was young</v>
<v Speaker 1>was having these crazies often criminal</v>

639
00:27:13.701 --> 00:27:17.840
<v Speaker 1>adventures in like the aftermath of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union falling.</v>

640
00:27:17.841 --> 00:27:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Those two things weren't nodding</v>
<v Speaker 1>compatible at all.</v>

641
00:27:20.301 --> 00:27:21.890
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always liked people like that who have</v>

642
00:27:21.891 --> 00:27:23.300
<v Speaker 1>lives that are really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really diverse.</v>

643
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a really good way of describing</v>

644
00:27:26.221 --> 00:27:29.610
<v Speaker 5>him too because we do have this idea</v>
<v Speaker 5>that if you're going to be an</v>

645
00:27:29.611 --> 00:27:33.680
<v Speaker 5>investigative journalist that your piece</v>
<v Speaker 5>has to be sort of homogenized and that</v>

646
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:38.040
<v Speaker 5>is going to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the facts take precedent over the flavor</v>

647
00:27:38.041 --> 00:27:41.790
<v Speaker 5>of the pros and his has a lot of flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of,</v>

648
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.820
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of personality in</v>
<v Speaker 5>distributing those facts,</v>

649
00:27:44.821 --> 00:27:46.710
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't get in the way of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>facts.</v>

650
00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:47.611
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

651
00:27:47.611 --> 00:27:48.444
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

652
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such like a master class on how to</v>

653
00:27:51.121 --> 00:27:53.940
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact it's really serves the</v>

654
00:27:53.941 --> 00:27:55.440
<v Speaker 1>facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause especially when he's writing about</v>

655
00:27:55.441 --> 00:27:57.290
<v Speaker 1>financial journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

656
00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.840
<v Speaker 1>finance can be so boring and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated that it can really be over</v>

657
00:28:00.841 --> 00:28:03.660
<v Speaker 1>most people's heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you write it completely without</v>

658
00:28:03.661 --> 00:28:05.670
<v Speaker 1>flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people will never even be able to</v>

659
00:28:05.671 --> 00:28:07.170
<v Speaker 1>sink into it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

660
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Is</v>

661
00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:11.250
<v Speaker 5>Guy that I got most of my information</v>
<v Speaker 5>about the financial collapse about,</v>

662
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:16.030
<v Speaker 5>and one of the things that disturbed me</v>
<v Speaker 5>the most was how little reaction like</v>

663
00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:20.850
<v Speaker 5>publicly his articles caused.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I thought like it would be one of</v>

664
00:28:20.851 --> 00:28:23.160
<v Speaker 5>those things where everyone would be</v>
<v Speaker 5>sharing it.</v>

665
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:25.590
<v Speaker 5>It would go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would be on the front page of the New</v>

666
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:30.020
<v Speaker 5>York Times today on CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Matt Taibbi uncover.</v>

667
00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:31.380
<v Speaker 5>And everybody would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

668
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.300
<v Speaker 5>look at the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is crazy.</v>

669
00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:38.540
<v Speaker 5>But meanwhile it was like this terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>terrible scenario where the whole system</v>

670
00:28:41.311 --> 00:28:45.720
<v Speaker 5>was hijacked by these fucking criminals</v>
<v Speaker 5>and no one seemed to care.</v>

671
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:49.170
<v Speaker 5>It just w I have bills to pay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to keep going.</v>

672
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:53.130
<v Speaker 5>I have a spin class at nine o'clock I</v>
<v Speaker 5>can't be paying and no one,</v>

673
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:58.370
<v Speaker 5>no one really gave it the attention or I</v>
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't say no one but not publicly</v>

674
00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:01.350
<v Speaker 5>nationally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It didn't get nearly the attention that</v>

675
00:29:01.351 --> 00:29:04.410
<v Speaker 5>it deserves and he wrote a series of</v>
<v Speaker 5>them and you know,</v>

676
00:29:04.411 --> 00:29:06.870
<v Speaker 5>some of them I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy's going to get fucking killed.</v>

677
00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:10.170
<v Speaker 5>Like these were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these were intense allegations and it's</v>

678
00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:14.340
<v Speaker 5>it and backed up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of it backed up by facts and really</v>

679
00:29:14.341 --> 00:29:17.460
<v Speaker 5>well written and it's just like almost</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's too much for people.</v>

680
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:18.703
<v Speaker 5>This is like,</v>

681
00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.150
<v Speaker 1>it's like complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It deals with a lot of things that are</v>

682
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:25.510
<v Speaker 1>kind of boring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very intellectually demanding,</v>

683
00:29:25.511 --> 00:29:29.250
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily partisan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think for a lot of people are</v>

684
00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.640
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

685
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it bothers me that he's not more famous.</v>

686
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.673
<v Speaker 5>That bothers me.</v>

687
00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope with the next book he will be,</v>

688
00:29:38.231 --> 00:29:40.730
<v Speaker 1>cause I think he's like one of the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists working in American.</v>

689
00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:42.053
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

690
00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:42.811
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

691
00:29:42.811 --> 00:29:44.730
<v Speaker 5>he's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's amazing.</v>

692
00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:48.090
<v Speaker 5>Now you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much time do you spend doing all</v>

693
00:29:48.091 --> 00:29:48.930
<v Speaker 5>this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You too.</v>

694
00:29:48.931 --> 00:29:51.330
<v Speaker 5>A lot of journalism and you do a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy shit.</v>

695
00:29:51.331 --> 00:29:54.480
<v Speaker 5>You go to a really nutty sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>dangerous places.</v>

696
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.590
<v Speaker 5>I've been to a few.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

697
00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.620
<v Speaker 5>What is like the most disturbing place</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you've been to?</v>

698
00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Dangerous place I went to was last</v>
<v Speaker 1>summer when I went into Syria for a day.</v>

699
00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:05.490
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

700
00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:09.450
<v Speaker 1>basically the reason why when I talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how dangerous it was,</v>

701
00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.950
<v Speaker 1>the fact that I wouldn't even spend the</v>
<v Speaker 1>night there shows probably something</v>

702
00:30:13.951 --> 00:30:17.280
<v Speaker 1>about my tolerance levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at that time,</v>

703
00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:22.940
<v Speaker 1>this coalition of Islamist groups had</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kicked isis out of this border town</v>

704
00:30:23.371 --> 00:30:27.990
<v Speaker 1>called is Oz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could take a bus over to the</v>

705
00:30:27.991 --> 00:30:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Turkish border and then you could cross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did that with a war journalist</v>

706
00:30:32.701 --> 00:30:35.820
<v Speaker 1>friend of mine and I spent a day with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Islamic Front driving around his</v>

707
00:30:35.821 --> 00:30:39.390
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things,</v>

708
00:30:39.391 --> 00:30:41.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was happening then was it was</v>

709
00:30:41.341 --> 00:30:41.880
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

710
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.020
<v Speaker 1>James Foley was murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we all knew that there were lots and</v>

711
00:30:46.021 --> 00:30:48.420
<v Speaker 1>lots of kidnappings there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at that point we thought it was just</v>

712
00:30:48.421 --> 00:30:49.890
<v Speaker 1>for ransom and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>

713
00:30:49.891 --> 00:30:51.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda brings a terrible,</v>

714
00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:52.200
<v Speaker 1>terrible thing.</v>

715
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.690
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

716
00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:57.390
<v Speaker 1>the scariest thing that ever happened to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me as a journalist was we're with these</v>

717
00:30:57.391 --> 00:31:00.090
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a young media activist slash fighter</v>

718
00:31:00.091 --> 00:31:01.920
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really cool dudes.</v>

719
00:31:01.921 --> 00:31:04.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked them and we're in this car,</v>

720
00:31:04.531 --> 00:31:08.250
<v Speaker 1>we're driving around his eyes and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>car slows to a halt.</v>

721
00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:12.690
<v Speaker 1>It just breaks down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Patrick,</v>

722
00:31:12.691 --> 00:31:15.810
<v Speaker 1>the guy I'm with and immediately thinks</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's set up for kidnapping to,</v>

723
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:16.733
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

724
00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:21.240
<v Speaker 1>get us out of the car because that's one</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that you can set things up for</v>

725
00:31:21.241 --> 00:31:25.920
<v Speaker 1>kidnappings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guys didn't have their guns.</v>

726
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:30.060
<v Speaker 1>And so we had to walk to the media</v>
<v Speaker 1>office,</v>

727
00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:31.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through his eyes and his eyes at that</v>

728
00:31:31.861 --> 00:31:33.690
<v Speaker 1>point looked like something out of Mad</v>
<v Speaker 1>Max.</v>

729
00:31:33.691 --> 00:31:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Like it was just no women on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just men.</v>

730
00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:37.290
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Ak is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

731
00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.930
<v Speaker 1>even if a guy didn't have any k like</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be holding like sticks and stuff.</v>

732
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

733
00:31:40.801 --> 00:31:44.160
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there was a like what I can only</v>

734
00:31:44.161 --> 00:31:47.730
<v Speaker 1>describe as like a gun bodega,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fascinating because it's sold</v>

735
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.880
<v Speaker 1>all these different guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it might sound like a beautiful</v>

736
00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:51.930
<v Speaker 1>antique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

737
00:31:51.931 --> 00:31:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Pearl in laid revolver that like</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's dad had,</v>

738
00:31:54.631 --> 00:31:57.030
<v Speaker 1>but then also grenades and stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 1>grenades.</v>

739
00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.293
<v Speaker 1>Grenades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

740
00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in case someone tried to kidnap you,</v>

741
00:32:00.601 --> 00:32:03.510
<v Speaker 1>you could have it grab a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come with me bitch.</v>

742
00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>

743
00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:05.251
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

744
00:32:05.251 --> 00:32:06.450
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

745
00:32:06.451 --> 00:32:11.140
<v Speaker 1>we're walking through this town and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was I'd think the scariest thing</v>

746
00:32:11.141 --> 00:32:13.830
<v Speaker 1>that I ever did in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it all turned out fine.</v>

747
00:32:13.831 --> 00:32:18.420
<v Speaker 1>And we got to the media office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it was a government building that</v>

748
00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.270
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these young men had taken over when</v>

749
00:32:21.271 --> 00:32:24.900
<v Speaker 1>they kicked out the central government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm the director of it had been</v>

750
00:32:24.901 --> 00:32:27.390
<v Speaker 1>kidnapped by Isis and the young guys are</v>
<v Speaker 1>there like watching,</v>

751
00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:30.420
<v Speaker 1>watching soccer cause everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone loves soccer there.</v>

752
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:35.370
<v Speaker 1>And it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

753
00:32:35.371 --> 00:32:40.250
<v Speaker 1>it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this feeling of being in place where,</v>

754
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.113
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

755
00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:46.510
<v Speaker 1>the whole world is both fucking with it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and abandoned it both at once,</v>

756
00:32:46.511 --> 00:32:47.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

757
00:32:47.951 --> 00:32:50.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and anything could happen.</v>

758
00:32:50.501 --> 00:32:52.030
<v Speaker 1>So that was the most dangerous thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever done.</v>

759
00:32:52.031 --> 00:32:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Like nothing I've ever done was as</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous is going to Syria.</v>

760
00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:58.240
<v Speaker 1>But I think the most dot personally</v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbing thing was,</v>

761
00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a Gaza six months ago,</v>

762
00:33:01.661 --> 00:33:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went to shy IA,</v>

763
00:33:04.271 --> 00:33:08.110
<v Speaker 1>which is this neighborhood that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely destroyed by Israel during</v>

764
00:33:08.111 --> 00:33:10.210
<v Speaker 1>protective edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they bombed it and then they went</v>

765
00:33:10.211 --> 00:33:12.100
<v Speaker 1>in with tanks and then they went in with</v>
<v Speaker 1>bulldozers.</v>

766
00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like flattened and it's just</v>

767
00:33:15.401 --> 00:33:16.780
<v Speaker 1>like gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

768
00:33:16.781 --> 00:33:17.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

769
00:33:17.231 --> 00:33:18.400
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go there and you're like,</v>

770
00:33:18.401 --> 00:33:20.590
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a neighborhood that has been</v>

771
00:33:20.591 --> 00:33:23.350
<v Speaker 1>wrecked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of times when you see houses</v>

772
00:33:23.351 --> 00:33:26.860
<v Speaker 1>that have collapsed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see all of the stuff of people's</v>

773
00:33:26.861 --> 00:33:27.880
<v Speaker 1>lives and it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

774
00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:30.880
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the cooking pots and there's the</v>

775
00:33:30.881 --> 00:33:33.400
<v Speaker 1>bed and there's all the stuff that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just trapped in.</v>

776
00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:36.970
<v Speaker 1>And then people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's a big housing shortage</v>

777
00:33:36.971 --> 00:33:40.660
<v Speaker 1>obviously in Gaza,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're living in these bombed out</v>

778
00:33:40.661 --> 00:33:41.620
<v Speaker 1>buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

779
00:33:41.621 --> 00:33:44.690
<v Speaker 1>where their home was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

780
00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:49.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with like no real like services or</v>

781
00:33:49.001 --> 00:33:50.140
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I saw this,</v>

782
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.050
<v Speaker 1>I was walking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of scrambling through this</v>

783
00:33:53.051 --> 00:33:57.540
<v Speaker 1>like building take pictures and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just randomly walked into what I thought</v>

784
00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:59.260
<v Speaker 1>was an abandoned room and there's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>an old guy there,</v>

785
00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:00.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out and you know,</v>

786
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.130
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really sorry to do,</v>

787
00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:02.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>invade,</v>

788
00:34:02.531 --> 00:34:05.770
<v Speaker 1>invade your home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was just just talking to him.</v>

789
00:34:05.771 --> 00:34:07.170
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had had like a,</v>

790
00:34:07.171 --> 00:34:12.171
<v Speaker 1>a baller gorgeous home before this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now he was just living in a little like</v>

791
00:34:12.551 --> 00:34:13.840
<v Speaker 1>the rack of one of the rooms.</v>

792
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.570
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

793
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.160
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

794
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:21.010
<v Speaker 5>the Mad Max is the way you described</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

795
00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:25.690
<v Speaker 5>that city and that sort of apocalyptic</v>
<v Speaker 5>scenario,</v>

796
00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:28.690
<v Speaker 5>something that we all worry could happen</v>
<v Speaker 5>to us,</v>

797
00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:32.870
<v Speaker 5>to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But one of the things that I always try</v>

798
00:34:32.871 --> 00:34:36.490
<v Speaker 5>to remember is that the apocalypse is</v>
<v Speaker 5>already here.</v>

799
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:38.800
<v Speaker 5>It's just not here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

800
00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.840
<v Speaker 5>If you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's there.</v>

801
00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.850
<v Speaker 5>Like in Gaza,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's there,</v>

802
00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.560
<v Speaker 5>that's the apocalypse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's there.</v>

803
00:34:44.561 --> 00:34:46.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean it might as well be in that guy's</v>
<v Speaker 5>house.</v>

804
00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean you are living like Mad Max,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those people in that,</v>

805
00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.490
<v Speaker 5>what's the name of the city yet?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw as,</v>

806
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:54.880
<v Speaker 5>as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as and as Oz mean daddy is what</v>

807
00:34:54.881 --> 00:34:57.400
<v Speaker 5>everyone's terrified of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What everyone's terrified of is a</v>

808
00:34:57.401 --> 00:35:01.240
<v Speaker 5>reality where you walked on the street</v>
<v Speaker 5>and everyone's carrying military weapons</v>

809
00:35:01.241 --> 00:35:04.210
<v Speaker 5>and you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's chaos and there's,</v>

810
00:35:04.211 --> 00:35:05.650
<v Speaker 5>it's fairly lawless.</v>

811
00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of the refugee camps that I</v>

812
00:35:10.201 --> 00:35:11.640
<v Speaker 1>saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that they were lawless.</v>

813
00:35:11.641 --> 00:35:16.070
<v Speaker 1>I would never describe them as that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just in the sense of the extreme of</v>

814
00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:21.080
<v Speaker 1>falling in your life situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a guy I met when I was in Iraqi</v>

815
00:35:21.181 --> 00:35:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Kurdistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

816
00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:25.550
<v Speaker 1>last time I was with Dr Borders there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

817
00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was this like super smart dude.</v>

818
00:35:27.871 --> 00:35:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Like he was Kurdish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which meant that he was really</v>

819
00:35:30.271 --> 00:35:32.970
<v Speaker 1>discriminated against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he scored so high on his math exams.</v>

820
00:35:32.971 --> 00:35:36.090
<v Speaker 1>He was able to go to like an elite</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering school and get an</v>

821
00:35:36.091 --> 00:35:37.270
<v Speaker 1>aeronautics degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And know be,</v>

822
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.660
<v Speaker 1>he's never not extend engineer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

823
00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:41.430
<v Speaker 1>this is a dude that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

824
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.980
<v Speaker 1>be beyond the path to like having an</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome job.</v>

825
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.220
<v Speaker 1>And now like he's living in a tent with</v>
<v Speaker 1>his whole family and his mom and</v>

826
00:35:47.221 --> 00:35:50.100
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

827
00:35:50.101 --> 00:35:53.280
<v Speaker 1>you'd never expect that when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in like an awesome city like</v>

828
00:35:53.281 --> 00:35:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Aleppo that he was living in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're,</v>

829
00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:01.110
<v Speaker 1>and then the war comes and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>bombings and here you're driven out of</v>

830
00:36:01.111 --> 00:36:03.600
<v Speaker 1>your home and you're so displaced that</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually you're forced to,</v>

831
00:36:03.601 --> 00:36:06.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be living in this tent with no end in</v>

832
00:36:06.691 --> 00:36:09.810
<v Speaker 1>sight and you're not allowed to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever improve your circumstances because</v>

833
00:36:09.811 --> 00:36:12.210
<v Speaker 1>you have the wrong passport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

834
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.530
<v Speaker 5>It's hard for anybody living in America</v>
<v Speaker 5>to wrap their head around what it would</v>

835
00:36:16.531 --> 00:36:19.800
<v Speaker 5>be like to be there and be stuck in that</v>
<v Speaker 5>position.</v>

836
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.090
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

837
00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:24.210
<v Speaker 1>so the Syrian refugee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mm.</v>

838
00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Syrian refugee thing,</v>

839
00:36:26.791 --> 00:36:31.710
<v Speaker 1>one thing that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think perhaps isn't in the media</v>

840
00:36:31.711 --> 00:36:33.960
<v Speaker 1>enough is that the people who are coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Europe right now,</v>

841
00:36:33.961 --> 00:36:37.950
<v Speaker 1>or the middle class of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's cost over a thousand</v>

842
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:40.890
<v Speaker 1>dollars to pay it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pay that pass smuggler to take you</v>

843
00:36:40.891 --> 00:36:43.680
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every single one of those people</v>

844
00:36:43.681 --> 00:36:48.681
<v Speaker 1>could buy a plane ticket and travel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a normal person and not have their kids</v>

845
00:36:49.381 --> 00:36:52.110
<v Speaker 1>risk drowning and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're banned from it cause they're</v>

846
00:36:52.111 --> 00:36:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Syrians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the whole like taking the boat and</v>

847
00:36:55.141 --> 00:36:59.370
<v Speaker 1>walking from Greece to Germany and</v>
<v Speaker 1>having volunteers give out water and</v>

848
00:36:59.371 --> 00:37:02.250
<v Speaker 1>sleeping on the streets and like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole humanitarian disaster is just a</v>

849
00:37:02.251 --> 00:37:04.050
<v Speaker 1>function of not letting them buy plane</v>
<v Speaker 1>tickets.</v>

850
00:37:04.051 --> 00:37:05.100
<v Speaker 1>That all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all it is.</v>

851
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.590
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's this big push in America now,</v>

852
00:37:07.591 --> 00:37:12.060
<v Speaker 5>especially among the Republicans not</v>
<v Speaker 5>allow anyone from Syria to come into the</v>

853
00:37:12.061 --> 00:37:12.900
<v Speaker 5>United States.</v>

854
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:14.960
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like not a single person with the Syrian</v>

855
00:37:14.961 --> 00:37:17.330
<v Speaker 1>refugee program has ever been arrested</v>
<v Speaker 1>for terrorism offense.</v>

856
00:37:17.331 --> 00:37:18.350
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's nuts.</v>

857
00:37:18.351 --> 00:37:21.130
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's solar brown,</v>

858
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:23.630
<v Speaker 1>but they're so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're terrorist.</v>

859
00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of them that's an asshole.</v>

860
00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:28.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's assholes,</v>

861
00:37:28.641 --> 00:37:30.420
<v Speaker 1>but not one of them was arrested for</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorism offenses.</v>

862
00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:33.380
<v Speaker 5>If you look like a million Canadians and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to,</v>

863
00:37:33.381 --> 00:37:34.790
<v Speaker 5>and they're the nicest people ever,</v>

864
00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.530
<v Speaker 1>there'd be like some of those guys that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in that,</v>

865
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.620
<v Speaker 1>that big like ride was in Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's washing cars.</v>

866
00:37:39.621 --> 00:37:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the ones the size asking a car</v>

867
00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:44.120
<v Speaker 5>or one of them from the Vancouver.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A hockey riot.</v>

868
00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those assholes would make it through.</v>

869
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:47.041
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

870
00:37:47.041 --> 00:37:48.630
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

871
00:37:48.631 --> 00:37:51.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really like personally upsetting to</v>

872
00:37:51.331 --> 00:37:53.130
<v Speaker 1>me because I've done so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

873
00:37:53.131 --> 00:37:57.900
<v Speaker 1>work with Syrians over the last few</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and like to see these like amazing</v>

874
00:37:57.901 --> 00:38:02.901
<v Speaker 1>people that I know who are so tough and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so smart and have endured so much.</v>

875
00:38:03.691 --> 00:38:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Like being defamed like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

876
00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.260
<v Speaker 1>I feel almost like someone's shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking like my,</v>

877
00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:08.071
<v Speaker 1>like my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

878
00:38:08.071 --> 00:38:09.540
<v Speaker 1>someone that's shit talking my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

879
00:38:09.541 --> 00:38:11.250
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes me angry on,</v>

880
00:38:11.251 --> 00:38:12.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a personal level,</v>

881
00:38:12.211 --> 00:38:13.410
<v Speaker 1>like not just a theoretical one.</v>

882
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.371
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not just,</v>

883
00:38:14.371 --> 00:38:16.620
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so short sighted because if you</v>

884
00:38:16.621 --> 00:38:20.250
<v Speaker 5>consider the fact that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about an entire group of</v>

885
00:38:20.251 --> 00:38:23.640
<v Speaker 5>people that's fleeing a terrible area.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly what you're saying.</v>

886
00:38:23.641 --> 00:38:25.020
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have all got to be bad.</v>

887
00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:30.210
<v Speaker 5>That that's one of the most racist</v>
<v Speaker 5>things that you could ever say publicly</v>

888
00:38:30.901 --> 00:38:35.340
<v Speaker 5>in 2015 it gets sort of this weird</v>
<v Speaker 5>excepted racism.</v>

889
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:38.570
<v Speaker 5>And because of the fact that terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

890
00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.570
<v Speaker 5>like when you're dealing with Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

891
00:38:40.571 --> 00:38:43.540
<v Speaker 5>You're dealing with 1.6 is that what it</v>
<v Speaker 5>is?</v>

892
00:38:43.541 --> 00:38:45.760
<v Speaker 5>Billion people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a fifth of the world.</v>

893
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.310
<v Speaker 5>And so the idea is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

894
00:38:48.311 --> 00:38:51.790
<v Speaker 5>lead terrorist activities been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have been done by Muslims.</v>

895
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:54.550
<v Speaker 5>Why don't we kick all the white people</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of America?</v>

896
00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:57.310
<v Speaker 5>Because white people have been</v>
<v Speaker 5>responsible for all the mass shootings.</v>

897
00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.550
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's more logical than this.</v>

898
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:04.300
<v Speaker 5>It's so awful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like the other thing that's to me</v>

899
00:39:04.301 --> 00:39:09.040
<v Speaker 5>like particularly like Moronic is I see</v>
<v Speaker 5>some times in the media like,</v>

900
00:39:09.041 --> 00:39:11.110
<v Speaker 5>why aren't the Muslims condemning the</v>
<v Speaker 5>terrorists?</v>

901
00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.900
<v Speaker 5>Every single group that is actually on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ground,</v>

902
00:39:13.901 --> 00:39:15.820
<v Speaker 5>like fighting isis with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

903
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.260
<v Speaker 5>they're Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

904
00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:19.780
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like 90% Muslim or 95% Muslim.</v>

905
00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.180
<v Speaker 5>I mean a lot of them are war criminals</v>
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

906
00:39:22.181 --> 00:39:23.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying they're good groups</v>
<v Speaker 5>necessarily,</v>

907
00:39:23.981 --> 00:39:25.300
<v Speaker 5>but they're Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

908
00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:28.060
<v Speaker 5>every single,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like major Muslim religious leader in</v>

909
00:39:28.061 --> 00:39:32.620
<v Speaker 5>the world has condemned isis in terms</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they wouldn't even use an America.</v>

910
00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:34.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's astounding to me.</v>

911
00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:37.780
<v Speaker 5>I think that the only reason anyone</v>
<v Speaker 5>would think that Muslims are and</v>

912
00:39:37.781 --> 00:39:40.420
<v Speaker 5>condemning isis is because they can't</v>
<v Speaker 5>use google.</v>

913
00:39:40.421 --> 00:39:43.510
<v Speaker 5>Don't read the news and have never</v>
<v Speaker 5>spoken to a Muslim or for the same</v>

914
00:39:43.511 --> 00:39:47.140
<v Speaker 5>reason why Matt Taibbi abies articles</v>
<v Speaker 5>never really got as popular as I thought</v>

915
00:39:47.141 --> 00:39:50.380
<v Speaker 5>they should.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People just don't have the time or the</v>

916
00:39:50.381 --> 00:39:52.120
<v Speaker 5>need.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything is wonderful.</v>

917
00:39:52.121 --> 00:39:54.160
<v Speaker 5>You go to the supermarket,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you buy food,</v>

918
00:39:54.161 --> 00:39:55.000
<v Speaker 5>it's really easy.</v>

919
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:57.100
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go through the Mcdonald's,</v>

920
00:39:57.101 --> 00:40:00.490
<v Speaker 5>drive through your stomach's full.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You sit home and watch netflix.</v>

921
00:40:00.491 --> 00:40:02.920
<v Speaker 5>You're good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you don't need to pay attention to</v>

922
00:40:02.921 --> 00:40:04.000
<v Speaker 5>Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck those people.</v>

923
00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:07.440
<v Speaker 5>Keep them out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Donald Trump's going to keep us safe and</v>

924
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:10.840
<v Speaker 5>you got to drink yourself into a coma.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wake up in the morning,</v>

925
00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:13.000
<v Speaker 5>do it all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Drink some coffee,</v>

926
00:40:13.001 --> 00:40:14.950
<v Speaker 5>get out the door,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get your fucking car,</v>

927
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.440
<v Speaker 5>do the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As long as you can get to work.</v>

928
00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:19.660
<v Speaker 5>I got bills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As long as you can get to work,</v>

929
00:40:19.661 --> 00:40:23.350
<v Speaker 5>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just the idea of America in the</v>

930
00:40:23.351 --> 00:40:27.250
<v Speaker 5>first place was supposed to be a place</v>
<v Speaker 5>where people could go or they didn't</v>

931
00:40:27.251 --> 00:40:29.290
<v Speaker 5>like where they were and they wanted a</v>
<v Speaker 5>found,</v>

932
00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:32.700
<v Speaker 5>they wanted to establish a new life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want it to,</v>

933
00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.220
<v Speaker 5>we're going to take a giant chance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to get an a fucking stupid</v>

934
00:40:36.221 --> 00:40:39.220
<v Speaker 5>boat and make it across this giant body</v>
<v Speaker 5>of water.</v>

935
00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.980
<v Speaker 5>We don't even know what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't have photos back then.</v>

936
00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:45.070
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the weirdest things about</v>
<v Speaker 5>traveling to America.</v>

937
00:40:45.071 --> 00:40:49.690
<v Speaker 5>If you really stop and think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was done when people didn't even have</v>

938
00:40:49.691 --> 00:40:52.330
<v Speaker 5>photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first people that came over,</v>

939
00:40:52.331 --> 00:40:55.840
<v Speaker 5>if you wanted a picture of something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you had to fucking draw it right.</v>

940
00:40:55.841 --> 00:40:57.890
<v Speaker 5>And that's how crazy these people where</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

941
00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.220
<v Speaker 5>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw drawing.</v>

942
00:41:00.221 --> 00:41:02.860
<v Speaker 5>It's a pretty trees.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're fucking getting in the boat.</v>

943
00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:06.010
<v Speaker 5>But they brought their babies and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>grandma and shit and they got in a boat</v>

944
00:41:06.011 --> 00:41:10.150
<v Speaker 5>and they came to America because they</v>
<v Speaker 5>had an idea and then idea was there is a</v>

945
00:41:10.151 --> 00:41:14.860
<v Speaker 5>better life here we can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can make it and the to deny that to</v>

946
00:41:14.861 --> 00:41:18.100
<v Speaker 5>these people because they were born in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wrong patch of dirt.</v>

947
00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.160
<v Speaker 5>And I'm not saying they shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 5>checked.</v>

948
00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.520
<v Speaker 5>You shouldn't go through a criminal</v>
<v Speaker 5>background check and make sure you're</v>

949
00:41:24.521 --> 00:41:28.660
<v Speaker 5>not letting in some mass murderer or not</v>
<v Speaker 5>letting in some rapist or some thieves</v>

950
00:41:28.661 --> 00:41:29.830
<v Speaker 5>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

951
00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:32.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean if there's a way to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that should be done.</v>

952
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:36.470
<v Speaker 5>But the idea that you should never let</v>
<v Speaker 5>anybody in that's from Syria.</v>

953
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:39.410
<v Speaker 5>It's like God man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>imagine you're cursed.</v>

954
00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.870
<v Speaker 5>You just cause you were born in the the</v>
<v Speaker 5>shitty patch of dirt.</v>

955
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.741
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

956
00:41:42.741 --> 00:41:45.440
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what the thinking is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like because you were born here</v>

957
00:41:45.441 --> 00:41:48.050
<v Speaker 1>like oh you carry some virus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be quarantined.</v>

958
00:41:48.051 --> 00:41:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Didn't man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

959
00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:51.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so fucking grateful that you're</v>

960
00:41:51.831 --> 00:41:52.640

<v Speaker 1>I know it sounds sappy and shit,</v>

963
00:41:56.121 --> 00:41:56.750
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

964
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:57.410
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thank you for going over there.</v>

966
00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:02.880
<v Speaker 5>If it wasn't for people like you and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know the,</v>

967
00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:05.330
<v Speaker 5>the vice people and all these</v>
<v Speaker 5>journalists and all these people that go</v>

968
00:42:05.331 --> 00:42:08.240
<v Speaker 5>over there and show us in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in video form,</v>

969
00:42:08.241 --> 00:42:11.150
<v Speaker 5>like exactly what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you get to watch it and see what</v>

970
00:42:11.151 --> 00:42:12.410
<v Speaker 5>it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They go,</v>

971
00:42:12.411 --> 00:42:14.420
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is fucking chaos.</v>

972
00:42:14.421 --> 00:42:19.070
<v Speaker 5>Like this is in the world right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>2015 while people were watching the</v>

973
00:42:19.071 --> 00:42:21.620
<v Speaker 5>emmy's and everybody's on the red carpet</v>
<v Speaker 5>smiling.</v>

974
00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:26.570
<v Speaker 5>There's parts of the world that are like</v>
<v Speaker 5>a Mad Max movie right now.</v>

975
00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:28.660
<v Speaker 5>Or like this refugee camp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

976
00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.053
<v Speaker 1>I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>er,</v>

977
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:33.000
<v Speaker 1>it was a bunch of refugee camps in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bekaa Valley in Lebanon.</v>

978
00:42:33.001 --> 00:42:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't know it gets cold.</v>

979
00:42:35.371 --> 00:42:37.110
<v Speaker 1>They're like kids freeze to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

980
00:42:37.111 --> 00:42:42.111
<v Speaker 1>every winter I'm in those camps cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're living under vinyl tarp</v>

981
00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:43.650
<v Speaker 1>in the mountains.</v>

982
00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:48.420
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

983
00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:54.090
<v Speaker 5>it's very strange that the world is so</v>
<v Speaker 5>uneven that there are places like the</v>

984
00:42:54.851 --> 00:42:59.851
<v Speaker 5>Congo that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that exist on the same timeline as park</v>

985
00:43:00.641 --> 00:43:02.080
<v Speaker 5>avenue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there's,</v>

986
00:43:02.081 --> 00:43:05.470
<v Speaker 5>there's people that have door men that</v>
<v Speaker 5>dress up like the guys that were holding</v>

987
00:43:05.471 --> 00:43:09.640
<v Speaker 5>open the door for Putin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hop into Uber,</v>

988
00:43:09.641 --> 00:43:12.160
<v Speaker 5>limousines,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you travel around the city,</v>

989
00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.590
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the right fragrances and the in the</v>

990
00:43:14.591 --> 00:43:15.950
<v Speaker 5>car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's,</v>

991
00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.580
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we will live in really strange times</v>

992
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:22.990
<v Speaker 5>because I think the disparity that</v>
<v Speaker 5>existed that that's kind of always</v>

993
00:43:22.991 --> 00:43:24.550
<v Speaker 5>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's always been disparity.</v>

994
00:43:24.551 --> 00:43:25.760
<v Speaker 5>There's always been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

995
00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.990
<v Speaker 5>the haves and the have nots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in some places it's on a much more</v>

996
00:43:28.991 --> 00:43:33.400
<v Speaker 5>grand scale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's never been so obvious,</v>

997
00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:34.850
<v Speaker 5>especially cause</v>

998
00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:40.460
<v Speaker 1>so many people are online now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think a lot of people maybe don't</v>

999
00:43:40.951 --> 00:43:41.810
<v Speaker 1>realize that.</v>

1000
00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:43.060
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1001
00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:46.060
<v Speaker 1>Especially in the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how Internet connected people are.</v>

1002
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:49.180
<v Speaker 1>When I was in dummies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this a refuge,</v>

1003
00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.550
<v Speaker 1>it was the refugee camp in Iraq that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was at.</v>

1004
00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:55.840
<v Speaker 1>One of the most popular stories was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>store that was selling personal wifi</v>

1005
00:43:55.841 --> 00:43:58.330
<v Speaker 1>hotspots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'd have people that were living</v>

1006
00:43:58.331 --> 00:43:59.560
<v Speaker 1>in like a tent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1007
00:43:59.561 --> 00:44:03.190
<v Speaker 1>with tarp and like nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'd have like a wifi hotspot and</v>

1008
00:44:03.191 --> 00:44:05.740
<v Speaker 1>that's because they had a family that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was scattered all around the world.</v>

1009
00:44:05.741 --> 00:44:09.520
<v Speaker 1>And the only way to communicate them</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them was with whatsapp or with</v>

1010
00:44:09.521 --> 00:44:11.290
<v Speaker 1>texting services like this or with</v>
<v Speaker 1>skype.</v>

1011
00:44:11.291 --> 00:44:14.260
<v Speaker 1>And so like the most important thing you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to get was Internet access so</v>

1012
00:44:14.261 --> 00:44:17.230
<v Speaker 1>that you could like talk to your brother</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was in one country and your</v>

1013
00:44:17.231 --> 00:44:19.810
<v Speaker 1>daughter that was in another like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was more important than anything</v>

1014
00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:21.540
<v Speaker 5>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>daughter,</v>

1015
00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:22.433
<v Speaker 5>I'd heard your using.</v>

1016

1017
00:44:24.171 --> 00:44:25.940

<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

1018
00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1019
00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:31.320

<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1020
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.110
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from Queens originally.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1023
00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:40.370
<v Speaker 2>it is a high possibility that someone in</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those camps is listening to you</v>

1024
00:44:40.371 --> 00:44:41.210
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is the latest Donald Trump thing.</v>

1040
00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:20.880
<v Speaker 1>I had a signing last night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I unfortunately I missed the</v>

1041
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.430
<v Speaker 1>intellectual glory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the republican debate.</v>

1042
00:45:23.431 --> 00:45:24.580
<v Speaker 1>So fill me in on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1043
00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:27.700
<v Speaker 2>Didn't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was talking about this,</v>

1044
00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:31.840
<v Speaker 2>that one of the things that they would</v>
<v Speaker 2>do or he would do is knock off the</v>

1045
00:45:31.841 --> 00:45:34.240
<v Speaker 2>internet to certain parts of the Middle</v>
<v Speaker 2>East.</v>

1046
00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Why like how's that?</v>

1047
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:38.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's how they're plotting</v>

1048
00:45:38.911 --> 00:45:41.910
<v Speaker 2>against us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Molly crab apple while you sit in your</v>

1049
00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:46.140
<v Speaker 2>wonderful New York apartment writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>books about sex,</v>

1050
00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.110
<v Speaker 2>the terrorists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the terrorists are winning.</v>

1051
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean does so in Isis territories that</v>

1052
00:45:53.761 --> 00:45:57.650
<v Speaker 1>those fuckers are occupying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got rid of private Internet access</v>

1053
00:45:57.651 --> 00:45:59.850
<v Speaker 1>in people's homes because they're really</v>
<v Speaker 1>scared of the Internet.</v>

1054
00:45:59.851 --> 00:46:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are super scared because there are</v>

1055
00:46:02.211 --> 00:46:05.610
<v Speaker 1>all these citizen activists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists that are revealing shit</v>

1056
00:46:05.611 --> 00:46:08.400
<v Speaker 1>about them on the Internet right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're in rock cod,</v>

1057
00:46:08.401 --> 00:46:12.840
<v Speaker 1>the only way to even get online is to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>on these Internet cafes that are kind of</v>

1058
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:15.990
<v Speaker 1>run by dudes with Isis connections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1059
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:17.690
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

1060
00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:21.900
<v Speaker 1>that's because isis is also really</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking scared of the Internet.</v>

1061
00:46:21.901 --> 00:46:23.610
<v Speaker 1>They really don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1062
00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

1063
00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of Syrians living and</v>

1064
00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Iraqis living in their territories</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hate them and they give Intel on</v>

1065
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.780
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>

1066
00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:36.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign journalists.</v>

1067
00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:39.860
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Internet acts as a way that they</v>

1068
00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:44.560
<v Speaker 2>communicate and establish plans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also acts as something that's</v>

1069
00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:46.100
<v Speaker 2>plotting against them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1070
00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:48.200
<v Speaker 2>Same as the internet does it everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

1071
00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:48.771
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1072
00:46:48.771 --> 00:46:51.080
<v Speaker 2>it's just communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just people.</v>

1073
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:53.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're a group of [inaudible] that</v>

1074
00:46:53.751 --> 00:46:56.300
<v Speaker 2>the whole world hates and your online</v>
<v Speaker 2>guarantee,</v>

1075
00:46:56.301 --> 00:46:57.260
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get some haters.</v>

1076
00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a,</v>

1077
00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.550
<v Speaker 1>there's one group of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1078
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:04.620
<v Speaker 1>journalists there that became very</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous that's called Brocka as being</v>

1079
00:47:04.621 --> 00:47:09.621
<v Speaker 1>silently slaughtered that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they did tons of work documenting</v>

1080
00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.420
<v Speaker 1>isis shit and isis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean beheaded two of their members</v>

1081
00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:16.250
<v Speaker 1>that were in Turkey and there are plenty</v>
<v Speaker 1>of other citizen journalists there and</v>

1082
00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:19.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isis is dead scared of normal of normal</v>

1083
00:47:19.321 --> 00:47:23.370
<v Speaker 1>people who are living under their</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking occupation using the internet.</v>

1084
00:47:23.371 --> 00:47:24.204
<v Speaker 1>They hate it.</v>

1085
00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:25.001
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another thing,</v>

1086
00:47:25.001 --> 00:47:27.100
<v Speaker 2>they're scared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're scared of being killed by women.</v>

1087
00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.650
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1088
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.280
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

1089
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.310
<v Speaker 3>this is my theory that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Kurdish group,</v>

1090
00:47:33.311 --> 00:47:35.410
<v Speaker 3>they won't go to heaven if a curtis girl</v>
<v Speaker 3>kills them thing.</v>

1091
00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:39.520
<v Speaker 3>I think like one person said that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it still how much play it got in</v>

1092
00:47:39.521 --> 00:47:41.020
<v Speaker 3>the media and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aw man,</v>

1093
00:47:41.021 --> 00:47:42.160
<v Speaker 3>this is good pr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's keep it,</v>

1094
00:47:42.161 --> 00:47:44.680
<v Speaker 3>let's keep milking this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so,</v>

1095
00:47:44.681 --> 00:47:45.070
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1096
00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:46.720
<v Speaker 3>it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ideologically,</v>

1097
00:47:46.721 --> 00:47:49.230
<v Speaker 3>like within their religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that something that they believe in?</v>

1098
00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.280
<v Speaker 3>She get killed by a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get all the virgins.</v>

1099
00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:52.540
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's bullshit.</v>

1100
00:47:52.541 --> 00:47:54.490
<v Speaker 3>I think that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe there's like a macho</v>

1101
00:47:54.491 --> 00:47:55.570
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know where they're like,</v>

1102
00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:57.640
<v Speaker 3>well fuck a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>girl shot my leg,</v>

1103
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:59.650
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a theological thing.</v>

1104
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:02.050
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems so good though.</v>

1105
00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.033
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really,</v>

1106
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:04.430
<v Speaker 3>it seemed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems sweet,</v>

1107
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:09.750
<v Speaker 3>like some crazy Amazon scenario</v>
<v Speaker 3>chasing isis and they just run away</v>

1108
00:48:10.751 --> 00:48:14.770
<v Speaker 3>because they're scared of being killed</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the women who are fighting Isis in</v>

1109
00:48:14.771 --> 00:48:17.560
<v Speaker 3>the Ypj or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ferocious soldiers.</v>

1110
00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:22.300
<v Speaker 3>But either isis is scared of getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're scared of getting killed.</v>

1111
00:48:22.301 --> 00:48:25.200
<v Speaker 3>Our soldiers were really allocated or if</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was true though,</v>

1112
00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:30.580
<v Speaker 3>allocated our resources correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's probably enough really</v>

1113
00:48:30.581 --> 00:48:33.190
<v Speaker 3>mean bitches in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could put together a hell of a</v>

1114
00:48:33.191 --> 00:48:34.340
<v Speaker 3>fucking army.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

1115
00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:36.160
<v Speaker 3>I think so too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with tons of motivation.</v>

1116
00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:39.820
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine just jet jetson</v>
<v Speaker 3>bombers</v>

1117
00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:43.750
<v Speaker 3>piloted by women?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's it.</v>

1118
00:48:43.751 --> 00:48:47.190
<v Speaker 3>Only women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only women going after Isis because if</v>

1119
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:49.990
<v Speaker 3>they get killed by these women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are Fox and they don't get to go</v>

1120
00:48:49.991 --> 00:48:51.210
<v Speaker 3>to heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1121
00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:55.570
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd have to do like a more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think at the bombings aren't doing</v>

1122
00:48:55.571 --> 00:48:58.960
<v Speaker 3>shit against Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the Ypg is doing is,</v>

1123
00:48:58.961 --> 00:49:00.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'd have to be more on the</v>

1124
00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:03.330
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1125
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:04.960
<v Speaker 3>especially in Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1126
00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:08.860
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>have always had a problem with invading</v>

1127
00:49:08.861 --> 00:49:09.550
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan.</v>

1128
00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:13.060
<v Speaker 3>It's essentially a series of mountain</v>
<v Speaker 3>ranges occupied by warlords.</v>

1129
00:49:13.061 --> 00:49:16.420
<v Speaker 3>There's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not a lot of access.</v>

1130
00:49:16.421 --> 00:49:19.420
<v Speaker 3>It's not so easy to get to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing with Isis is what they do is</v>

1131
00:49:19.421 --> 00:49:20.350
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they move in,</v>

1132
00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:24.150
<v Speaker 3>they occupy cities like a military</v>
<v Speaker 3>occupation and they try to marry people</v>

1133
00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:27.640
<v Speaker 3>and build families and they try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>insert themselves as much as possible</v>

1134
00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:29.650
<v Speaker 3>into the fabric of a city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's partially,</v>

1135
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:33.320
<v Speaker 3>in part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's them making it so that if,</v>

1136
00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.193
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1137
00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:36.730
<v Speaker 3>bombed Rocca,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would be murdering hundreds of</v>

1138
00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:40.240
<v Speaker 3>thousands of innocent civilians who were</v>
<v Speaker 3>just too poor to get out to do it.</v>

1139
00:49:40.241 --> 00:49:43.840
<v Speaker 3>Strategically embed themselves as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>human shield.</v>

1140
00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:44.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1141
00:49:44.951 --> 00:49:49.510
<v Speaker 3>And like there were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the majority of Rocca is there</v>

1142
00:49:49.511 --> 00:49:53.470
<v Speaker 3>like farmers who couldn't afford to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>out because it's expensive to even get</v>

1143
00:49:53.471 --> 00:49:56.470
<v Speaker 3>out of Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a mess.</v>

1144
00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:58.240
<v Speaker 3>What a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chaotic,</v>

1145
00:49:58.241 --> 00:50:00.820
<v Speaker 3>psychotic mess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really bizarre.</v>

1146
00:50:00.821 --> 00:50:04.090
<v Speaker 3>That member,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Obama speech that he had on</v>

1147
00:50:04.091 --> 00:50:07.030
<v Speaker 3>television,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it a year or so ago or he was</v>

1148
00:50:07.031 --> 00:50:11.740
<v Speaker 3>talking about eminent military action</v>
<v Speaker 3>against Syria and the whole country</v>

1149
00:50:11.741 --> 00:50:14.140
<v Speaker 3>went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you fucking crazy?</v>

1150
00:50:14.141 --> 00:50:15.820
<v Speaker 3>And then it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just stopped.</v>

1151
00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:19.930
<v Speaker 3>Literally like silence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you didn't hear anything more about</v>

1152
00:50:19.931 --> 00:50:21.670
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just completely backed off just</v>

1153
00:50:21.671 --> 00:50:24.160
<v Speaker 3>because Republicans and Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone was like,</v>

1154
00:50:24.161 --> 00:50:27.690
<v Speaker 3>are you out of your fucking mind?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what could happen in look what</v>

1155
00:50:27.691 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 3>happened</v>

1156
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.610
<v Speaker 5>in Afghanistan?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at the,</v>

1157
00:50:29.611 --> 00:50:33.620
<v Speaker 5>the massive negative reaction the</v>
<v Speaker 5>American public has had all these</v>

1158
00:50:33.621 --> 00:50:36.290
<v Speaker 5>military actions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to start up a new one on in</v>

1159
00:50:36.291 --> 00:50:38.900
<v Speaker 5>Syria for what reason?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because somebody got gassed because they</v>

1160
00:50:38.901 --> 00:50:40.300
<v Speaker 5>gas people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what do you,</v>

1161
00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:41.780
<v Speaker 5>what you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's going on that we need to</v>

1162
00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.600
<v Speaker 5>sacrifice American lives over there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1163
00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:46.130
<v Speaker 5>Like what's the cause of all this?</v>

1164
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's really sort of a so tragic about</v>

1165
00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:50.990
<v Speaker 1>Syria is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1166
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1167
00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:55.730
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is me saying an opinion that's not</v>

1168
00:50:55.731 --> 00:50:57.470
<v Speaker 1>necessarily mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's opinion of that I've gotten</v>

1169
00:50:57.471 --> 00:50:59.690
<v Speaker 1>from speaking to refugees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1170
00:50:59.691 --> 00:51:02.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people I think felt very led on</v>

1171
00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:06.920
<v Speaker 1>by what Obama said and they felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1172
00:51:06.921 --> 00:51:07.910
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1173
00:51:07.911 --> 00:51:12.911
<v Speaker 1>some support or I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some action against Assad because I mean</v>

1174
00:51:14.151 --> 00:51:17.060
<v Speaker 1>whatever one thinks about American</v>
<v Speaker 1>intervention or not intervention,</v>

1175
00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:21.470
<v Speaker 1>what asides did is a crime against</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity on a massive scale.</v>

1176
00:51:21.471 --> 00:51:23.330
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever we think do you think we should</v>

1177
00:51:23.331 --> 00:51:24.890
<v Speaker 1>have done what he did was fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific.</v>

1178
00:51:24.891 --> 00:51:29.060
<v Speaker 1>And anyone who is in Syria and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was at the receiving end of that</v>

1179
00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:34.010
<v Speaker 1>would very often once someone else to</v>
<v Speaker 1>intervene and explain to people what he</v>

1180
00:51:34.011 --> 00:51:39.011
<v Speaker 1>did do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ran like an industrial scale,</v>

1181
00:51:39.561 --> 00:51:42.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrest,</v>

1182
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:46.850
<v Speaker 1>torture killing program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does something called barrel</v>

1183
00:51:46.851 --> 00:51:49.760
<v Speaker 1>bombings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are taking like basically like</v>

1184
00:51:49.761 --> 00:51:53.900
<v Speaker 1>dumpsters full of t and t and shrapnel</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dropping them in populated areas to</v>

1185
00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:54.920
<v Speaker 1>target schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>targets.</v>

1186
00:51:54.921 --> 00:51:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Hospitals are destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A large swathes of Aleppo.</v>

1187
00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.270
<v Speaker 1>And this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't me saying,</v>

1188
00:52:02.271 --> 00:52:06.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't me saying that I think the US</v>

1189
00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:09.290
<v Speaker 1>should have intervened because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1190
00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:10.790
<v Speaker 1>I still don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

1191
00:52:10.791 --> 00:52:13.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm very against the US intervening in</v>
<v Speaker 1>general and anything cause I think we</v>

1192
00:52:13.771 --> 00:52:16.490
<v Speaker 1>always fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he also factually didn't do those</v>

1193
00:52:16.491 --> 00:52:17.324
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1194
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:24.420
<v Speaker 5>It's just hard to imagine that someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>is capable of doing shit like that</v>

1195
00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:29.400
<v Speaker 5>where people can get to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where people can get through in their</v>

1196
00:52:29.401 --> 00:52:33.030
<v Speaker 5>minds that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that allows them to do shit like that.</v>

1197
00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:36.800
<v Speaker 1>I think what it was was his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that was quite</v>

1198
00:52:36.801 --> 00:52:41.801
<v Speaker 1>influential was his father put down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of incipient insurgency</v>

1199
00:52:43.551 --> 00:52:44.870
<v Speaker 1>opposition thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1200
00:52:44.871 --> 00:52:49.670
<v Speaker 1>in a city called Hama by killing 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and like bombing the fuck out of</v>

1201
00:52:49.671 --> 00:52:51.040
<v Speaker 1>the city and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it put it,</v>

1202
00:52:51.041 --> 00:52:54.770
<v Speaker 1>put it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that perhaps in his mind he</v>

1203
00:52:54.771 --> 00:52:58.040
<v Speaker 1>thought that he could do the same when</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an uprising against him.</v>

1204
00:52:58.041 --> 00:52:59.870
<v Speaker 1>But obviously that wasn't what happened.</v>

1205
00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:03.070
<v Speaker 5>Well that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's a story of Saddam Hussein</v>

1206
00:53:03.071 --> 00:53:06.420
<v Speaker 5>and his sons as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I imagine being the son of a,</v>

1207
00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.440
<v Speaker 5>an evil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>brutal dictator.</v>

1208
00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:09.693
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're just like,</v>

1209
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those sons was ended up like these</v>

1210
00:53:11.681 --> 00:53:13.410
<v Speaker 1>fucking nero figures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't say it.</v>

1211
00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:16.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the father is very often like</v>

1212
00:53:16.931 --> 00:53:21.931
<v Speaker 1>a thuggish military guy and then the sun</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this a princeling who always got</v>

1213
00:53:22.781 --> 00:53:25.150
<v Speaker 1>whatever he wanted in his life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when it gets so,</v>

1214
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 1>so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see</v>

1215
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.440
<v Speaker 5>with like Kim Jong Il also.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1216
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:30.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Uday and Qusay is,</v>

1217
00:53:30.871 --> 00:53:32.160
<v Speaker 5>I would assume,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1218
00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:36.060
<v Speaker 5>those motherfuckers who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God or it's more horrible stories about</v>

1219
00:53:36.061 --> 00:53:37.980
<v Speaker 5>what they would do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would find women that were getting</v>

1220
00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:40.830
<v Speaker 5>married and they would take them from</v>
<v Speaker 5>their husband,</v>

1221
00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.350
<v Speaker 5>rape them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then feed them to dogs.</v>

1222
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:46.830
<v Speaker 5>They had dogs that they had in their</v>
<v Speaker 5>basement that they just didn't feed.</v>

1223
00:53:46.831 --> 00:53:49.950
<v Speaker 5>And they would throw people that they</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't like to their dogs and the dogs</v>

1224
00:53:49.951 --> 00:53:52.620
<v Speaker 5>are Tam apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

1225
00:53:53.570 --> 00:53:55.740
<v Speaker 5>And then they would watch of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>

1226
00:53:55.741 --> 00:53:58.050
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fact that a person can get to that</v>

1227
00:53:58.051 --> 00:54:00.450
<v Speaker 5>place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that a person can get to that place</v>

1228
00:54:00.451 --> 00:54:05.451
<v Speaker 5>where they eat w in the weirdest way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're flexible in a beautiful way.</v>

1229
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:08.850
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you can see someone who can create</v>

1230
00:54:08.851 --> 00:54:13.770
<v Speaker 5>beautiful songs and art and they can</v>
<v Speaker 5>touch people with their words and their</v>

1231
00:54:13.771 --> 00:54:15.990
<v Speaker 5>thoughts and their deeds and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can,</v>

1232
00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.900
<v Speaker 5>they can be something inspirational and</v>
<v Speaker 5>amazing,</v>

1233
00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:23.910
<v Speaker 5>but we're also flexible in this horrific</v>
<v Speaker 5>way where they could play upon the worst</v>

1234
00:54:23.911 --> 00:54:27.720
<v Speaker 5>fears and the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the worst emotions that people are</v>

1235
00:54:27.721 --> 00:54:30.000
<v Speaker 5>capable of manifesting.</v>

1236
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.000
<v Speaker 5>And they could just just attack and</v>
<v Speaker 5>torture and maim and brutalized and</v>

1237
00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:40.830
<v Speaker 5>murdered and they could do it wantonly</v>
<v Speaker 5>and do it with no for no real reason.</v>

1238
00:54:41.251 --> 00:54:45.150
<v Speaker 5>They could do it sadistically for fun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for recreation.</v>

1239
00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:49.050
<v Speaker 5>The fact that that that's the same beast</v>
<v Speaker 5>has just,</v>

1240
00:54:49.051 --> 00:54:53.460
<v Speaker 5>they're human beings and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there could obviously be some</v>

1241
00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:58.410
<v Speaker 5>anomalies in the brain itself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but essentially a good portion of what</v>

1242
00:54:58.411 --> 00:55:03.411
<v Speaker 5>makes a person who they are is their</v>
<v Speaker 5>environment and their life experiences</v>

1243
00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:08.070
<v Speaker 5>and the nurturing and like how they were</v>
<v Speaker 5>raised and what they're exposed to.</v>

1244
00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:11.580
<v Speaker 5>And we get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're so flexible and pliable because we</v>

1245
00:55:11.581 --> 00:55:16.581
<v Speaker 5>want to survive that we're capable the</v>
<v Speaker 5>same species during the same time</v>

1246
00:55:16.681 --> 00:55:18.510
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not talking about like cave people</v>

1247
00:55:18.511 --> 00:55:21.510
<v Speaker 5>that cannibalize because they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>have books than it and understand it was</v>

1248
00:55:21.511 --> 00:55:25.560
<v Speaker 5>bad and they had invented language yet</v>
<v Speaker 5>over talking about people with the</v>

1249
00:55:25.561 --> 00:55:28.380
<v Speaker 5>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're capable of doing these horrific</v>

1250
00:55:28.381 --> 00:55:30.840
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but at the same time there's someone</v>

1251
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:32.430
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

1252
00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:34.350
<v Speaker 5>You fill in the blank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of beautiful people out</v>

1253
00:55:34.351 --> 00:55:37.510
<v Speaker 5>there that do things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but my friend Justin wren was um,</v>

1254
00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:41.010
<v Speaker 5>from these photos over here who goes to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Congo and he lives with the pygmies</v>

1255
00:55:41.011 --> 00:55:44.760
<v Speaker 5>for six months a year and he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he need builds wells for them and he</v>

1256
00:55:44.761 --> 00:55:47.910
<v Speaker 5>gets malaria and almost dies and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

1257
00:55:47.911 --> 00:55:51.570
<v Speaker 5>he's an American from Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just went over there and saw how</v>

1258
00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:54.270
<v Speaker 5>incredible these people were and he</v>
<v Speaker 5>dedicates his life to it.</v>

1259
00:55:54.271 --> 00:55:55.051
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to me,</v>

1260
00:55:55.051 --> 00:55:57.420
<v Speaker 5>he's like one of my favorite people</v>
<v Speaker 5>because he's just like this beautiful</v>

1261
00:55:57.421 --> 00:56:02.070
<v Speaker 5>manifestation of like experiencing like</v>
<v Speaker 5>friendship and love from these people.</v>

1262
00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:05.040
<v Speaker 5>Then just becoming incredibly dedicated</v>
<v Speaker 5>to try to take care of them.</v>

1263
00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:07.710
<v Speaker 5>But these people exist at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

1264
00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:11.190
<v Speaker 5>it's so hard to understand like a parent</v>
<v Speaker 5>is a fucking parrot.</v>

1265
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:13.540
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some parents you can tame and they'll</v>

1266

<v Speaker 1>public shaming,</v>

1303
00:57:44.481 --> 00:57:48.260
<v Speaker 1>like the term</v>
<v Speaker 1>public shaming is sort of an old</v>

1304
00:57:48.261 --> 00:57:50.180
<v Speaker 1>American tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a book called the scarlet letter</v>

1305
00:57:50.181 --> 00:57:51.440
<v Speaker 1>about public shaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:55.470
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that one day we're going to come a time</v>

1334
00:58:55.471 --> 00:58:57.300
<v Speaker 5>where there's no boundaries between</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1335
00:58:57.310 --> 00:58:59.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm really absolutely convinced this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1336
00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:00.271
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

1337
00:59:00.271 --> 00:59:02.940
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had these weird,</v>

1338
00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:05.970
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trips in a sensory deprivation tank</v>

1339
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:11.000
<v Speaker 5>where I've sort of seen this take place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the slow acceptance of what is the</v>

1340
00:59:11.101 --> 00:59:15.090
<v Speaker 5>ultimate inevitable reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it kind of freaks me out sometimes I</v>

1341
00:59:15.091 --> 00:59:17.950
<v Speaker 5>have to get out of the tank cause I just</v>
<v Speaker 5>can't handle it because I really,</v>

1342
00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:21.920
<v Speaker 5>I think like life as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have this idea that we're gonna put</v>

1343
00:59:21.921 --> 00:59:24.050
<v Speaker 5>our shell on and we're good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got Michelle on,</v>

1344
00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:25.990
<v Speaker 5>this is going to be no shells.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1345
00:59:25.991 --> 00:59:28.010
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're gonna just have to somehow or</v>

1346
00:59:28.011 --> 00:59:29.690
<v Speaker 5>another like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know how you have friends?</v>

1347
00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:31.370
<v Speaker 5>Like I have friends that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1348
00:59:31.371 --> 00:59:33.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm almost too close to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know everything they do.</v>

1349
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:34.490
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1350
00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:35.121
<v Speaker 5>what'd you do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

1351
00:59:35.121 --> 00:59:36.470
<v Speaker 5>you fuck her?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why'd you do that?</v>

1352
00:59:36.471 --> 00:59:37.550
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are you doing?</v>

1353
00:59:37.590 --> 00:59:39.570
<v Speaker 5>I just fucking lost my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1354
00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:42.620
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything like we're going to know that</v>

1355
00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:44.720
<v Speaker 5>about everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a matter of time.</v>

1356
00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:47.350
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is I don't think it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to make us nicer to each other and</v>

1357
00:59:47.351 --> 00:59:50.930
<v Speaker 1>make us like each other better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that one of the things that</v>

1358
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:51.920
<v Speaker 1>twitter has done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1359
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:53.900
<v Speaker 1>I love twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm addicted to twitter.</v>

1360
00:59:53.901 --> 00:59:55.340
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really cool.</v>

1361
00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:59.330
<v Speaker 1>But in addition to having a speak to all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of amazing people that we never</v>

1362
00:59:59.331 --> 01:00:02.660
<v Speaker 1>would have spoken to before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also like really revealed what other</v>

1363
01:00:02.661 --> 01:00:06.830
<v Speaker 1>people were thinking and made us like</v>
<v Speaker 1>really dislike them for it to knit a lot</v>

1364
01:00:06.831 --> 01:00:07.550
<v Speaker 1>of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the ability to reach out to molly and</v>

1381
01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:44.210
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like.</v>

1382
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:47.800
<v Speaker 1>I get a lot of like as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I'm sure you do.</v>

1383
01:00:47.801 --> 01:00:48.820
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1384
01:00:48.821 --> 01:00:50.680
<v Speaker 1>so this is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the thing that helps him put</v>

1385
01:00:50.681 --> 01:00:54.760
<v Speaker 1>it in perspective is I got 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter followers and I think if I ever</v>

1386
01:00:54.761 --> 01:00:58.210
<v Speaker 1>had any other grouping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like any real life grouping of 70,000</v>

1387
01:00:58.211 --> 01:00:59.950
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what would be the jackass ratio</v>

1388
01:00:59.951 --> 01:01:01.210
<v Speaker 1>that I would expect in that</v>

1389
01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:03.920
<v Speaker 5>it's always one in 100 that's my</v>
<v Speaker 5>thought.</v>

1390
01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:07.640
<v Speaker 5>My thought is it's one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the real 1% we should be concerned</v>

1391
01:01:07.641 --> 01:01:10.360
<v Speaker 5>with the jackass 1% the mean people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1392
01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:11.700
<v Speaker 5>because I think they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're so,</v>

1393
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:14.720
<v Speaker 5>they're so calm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the idea of the 1% being like the</v>

1394
01:01:14.721 --> 01:01:16.880
<v Speaker 5>real problem in America being successful</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1395
01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:20.030
<v Speaker 5>I think if you've got the 1% of all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>successful people together,</v>

1396
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:24.080
<v Speaker 5>only 1% of them would be evil cunts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really believe that.</v>

1397
01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:27.500
<v Speaker 5>I think 1% of Pr,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you keep going with the 1% like</v>

1398
01:01:27.501 --> 01:01:29.570
<v Speaker 5>how many of those will add of those</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that are evil,</v>

1399
01:01:29.571 --> 01:01:32.330
<v Speaker 5>how many of them are true sociopath?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Probably ones percent of them too.</v>

1400
01:01:32.331 --> 01:01:33.560
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he keeps going.</v>

1401
01:01:33.830 --> 01:01:38.830
<v Speaker 5>But if you have 300 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with 3 million assholes.</v>

1402
01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.110
<v Speaker 5>Like if there's a hundred people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of them is going to suck.</v>

1403
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:46.610
<v Speaker 5>And if you have 300 million,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have 3 million people that suck.</v>

1404
01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:48.890
<v Speaker 5>And if they all get ahold of your</v>
<v Speaker 5>twitter account,</v>

1405
01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:50.600
<v Speaker 5>you're going to think the world has</v>
<v Speaker 5>ended.</v>

1406
01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:54.170
<v Speaker 5>You're going to think my God and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>won't see the other 99.</v>

1407
01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:58.160
<v Speaker 5>You won't see them because the hateful</v>
<v Speaker 5>words of the one will just be</v>

1408
01:01:58.161 --> 01:02:00.350
<v Speaker 5>overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And every now and then molly,</v>

1409
01:02:00.351 --> 01:02:02.100
<v Speaker 5>your book's amazing collection.</v>

1410
01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

1411
01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:06.960
<v Speaker 5>you'll try to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1412
01:02:06.961 --> 01:02:08.820
<v Speaker 5>I've watched people in scale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I had,</v>

1413
01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.390
<v Speaker 5>like we were talking about Lance</v>
<v Speaker 5>Armstrong and I looked at the mentions</v>

1414
01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:16.410
<v Speaker 5>that Lance Armstrong gets on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like anything he writes and like</v>

1415
01:02:16.411 --> 01:02:18.660
<v Speaker 5>anything he wrote like had a great time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1416
01:02:18.661 --> 01:02:19.740
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing these,</v>

1417
01:02:19.741 --> 01:02:21.900
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this race was as good at times when</v>

1418
01:02:21.901 --> 01:02:24.250
<v Speaker 5>you're running away from drug tests,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like sake,</v>

1419
01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:26.580
<v Speaker 5>I think they can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like they,</v>

1420
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.410
<v Speaker 5>people just love to dig.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just love to fucking reach out of</v>

1421
01:02:31.411 --> 01:02:33.240
<v Speaker 5>that rib cage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pull out your heart.</v>

1422
01:02:33.290 --> 01:02:35.130
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can't help it.</v>

1423
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:39.540
<v Speaker 5>They know they can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's also a new ability that human</v>

1424
01:02:39.541 --> 01:02:43.260
<v Speaker 5>beings have sort of cultivated over the</v>
<v Speaker 5>last couple of decades really didn't</v>

1425
01:02:43.261 --> 01:02:44.190
<v Speaker 5>exist before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1426
01:02:44.191 --> 01:02:46.320
<v Speaker 5>before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you would had to have like written</v>

1427
01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:46.600
<v Speaker 5>on</v>

1428
01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.900
<v Speaker 1>letter left your mom's basement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walked all the way down to the block.</v>

1429
01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Humans basement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't I say like Your Dad's base and</v>

1430
01:02:55.351 --> 01:02:57.730
<v Speaker 1>your girlfriend's based and there's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many other basements these people could</v>

1431
01:02:57.731 --> 01:02:58.870
<v Speaker 1>be in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why do I have to put them all in</v>

1432
01:02:58.871 --> 01:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>their mom's basement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's somehow or another for a</v>

1433
01:03:01.001 --> 01:03:02.590
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most pathetic thing.</v>

1434
01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>

1435
01:03:03.731 --> 01:03:04.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm done here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mom.</v>

1436
01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>Stop yelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm down.</v>

1437
01:03:06.131 --> 01:03:07.660
<v Speaker 1>You're telling people they're wrong on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the internet.</v>

1438
01:03:07.810 --> 01:03:11.540
<v Speaker 5>You're typing up a fucking stone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're trying to hurt land,</v>

1439
01:03:11.541 --> 01:03:13.100
<v Speaker 5>shine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kneeling,</v>

1440
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:17.430
<v Speaker 5>cycling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lying.</v>

1441
01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:19.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1442
01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.400
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>

1443
01:03:20.401 --> 01:03:21.180
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a,</v>

1444
01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:22.013
<v Speaker 1>that was a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1445
01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:23.610
<v Speaker 1>good personification of that.</v>

1446
01:03:24.350 --> 01:03:28.610
<v Speaker 5>It's like this feeling of just wanting</v>
<v Speaker 5>to just somehow or another get a</v>

1447
01:03:28.611 --> 01:03:31.880
<v Speaker 5>reaction and it's all losers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's unfortunate.</v>

1448
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:33.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hate to say that to those people,</v>

1449
01:03:33.741 --> 01:03:34.370
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

1450
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:35.090
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1451
01:03:35.090 --> 01:03:36.140
<v Speaker 5>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a winner.</v>

1452
01:03:36.141 --> 01:03:38.810
<v Speaker 5>And I think he just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what he did was dishonorable.</v>

1453
01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.580
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well then you might think it,</v>

1454
01:03:40.790 --> 01:03:43.310
<v Speaker 5>but if you actually are sitting around</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to attack him,</v>

1455
01:03:43.311 --> 01:03:48.110
<v Speaker 5>I guarantee you that his energy and</v>
<v Speaker 5>focus that you could have best spent on</v>

1456
01:03:48.111 --> 01:03:49.610
<v Speaker 5>your own life 100%</v>

1457
01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:53.400
<v Speaker 1>or like maybe if you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean critical person who is a winner,</v>

1458
01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:56.490
<v Speaker 1>you could have written a really great</v>
<v Speaker 1>essay about like juicing in the sport</v>

1459
01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.420
<v Speaker 1>that like really took him down and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1460
01:03:58.470 --> 01:04:00.450
<v Speaker 1>and then you have challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like meaning this in a positive</v>

1461
01:04:00.451 --> 01:04:01.430
<v Speaker 1>and winning direction.</v>

1462
01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:03.960
<v Speaker 5>But if you really looked at the essay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>honestly,</v>

1463
01:04:03.961 --> 01:04:06.090
<v Speaker 5>you'd have to take down the whole sport</v>
<v Speaker 5>itself.</v>

1464
01:04:06.130 --> 01:04:09.510
<v Speaker 5>You mean you really wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who if you want to take down Lance</v>

1465
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:10.530
<v Speaker 5>Armstrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd have to take them down by his</v>

1466
01:04:10.531 --> 01:04:15.270
<v Speaker 5>individual acts actions in defending his</v>
<v Speaker 5>actions in the sport.</v>

1467
01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That,</v>

1468
01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.430
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1469
01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:21.600
<v Speaker 5>he admits that he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's pretty open about the fact that he</v>

1470
01:04:21.601 --> 01:04:25.080
<v Speaker 5>fucked up and then he made some pretty</v>
<v Speaker 5>horrible choices.</v>

1471
01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:28.980
<v Speaker 5>Does it though the sport itself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you really wanted to write an</v>

1472
01:04:28.981 --> 01:04:30.900
<v Speaker 5>essay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd write what the fuck you bunch of</v>

1473
01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:33.230
<v Speaker 5>steroid using bike riders.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what you got.</v>

1474
01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'd write like properly about the</v>

1475
01:04:35.791 --> 01:04:39.930
<v Speaker 1>economic impetus and how all the ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>that like top people were able to kind</v>

1476
01:04:39.931 --> 01:04:42.540
<v Speaker 1>of condone it but then get out with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hands clean and you'd write</v>

1477
01:04:42.541 --> 01:04:45.480
<v Speaker 1>something like that really channeled</v>
<v Speaker 1>your meaning this into a positive</v>

1478
01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:46.680
<v Speaker 1>direction that really tore shit.</v>

1479
01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:49.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a weird thing about blogs too</v>

1480
01:04:49.241 --> 01:04:50.340
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of pee.</v>

1481
01:04:50.341 --> 01:04:52.380
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've read some really mean blogs.</v>

1482
01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.660
<v Speaker 5>People write about folks and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's interesting about this is like</v>

1483
01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.960
<v Speaker 5>blogs or not a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're,</v>

1484
01:04:58.961 --> 01:04:59.720
<v Speaker 5>you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1485
01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:02.530
<v Speaker 5>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this focused attack of,</v>

1486
01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:06.190
<v Speaker 5>of an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if that individual was there and</v>

1487
01:05:06.191 --> 01:05:08.620
<v Speaker 5>they could respond to this and you could</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a communicate,</v>

1488
01:05:08.850 --> 01:05:11.140
<v Speaker 5>it would be a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what it is is like,</v>

1489
01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:12.200
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a,</v>

1490
01:05:12.201 --> 01:05:16.210
<v Speaker 5>a message tied to the Clav,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a raven that you're sending out.</v>

1491
01:05:16.211 --> 01:05:16.700
<v Speaker 5>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1492
01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:19.660
<v Speaker 5>so it's such a one way thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1493
01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:24.010
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not really an effective way to</v>

<v Speaker 3>It shows like diverse musical tastes.</v>

1523
01:06:30.091 --> 01:06:30.924

<v Speaker 5>Definitely have that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes too diverse,</v>

1525
01:06:33.211 --> 01:06:34.710
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

1526
01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:37.980
<v Speaker 5>I dunno how we got onto that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like,</v>

1527
01:06:37.981 --> 01:06:40.440
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like mean takedowns of like a some</v>

<v Speaker 5>terrible person really affecting your</v>

1529
01:06:45.421 --> 01:06:49.440
<v Speaker 5>life in some strange way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the like the comments that people</v>

1530
01:06:49.441 --> 01:06:52.830
<v Speaker 5>will make to people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe on twitter and facebook,</v>

1531
01:06:52.831 --> 01:06:53.850
<v Speaker 5>all these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and not facebook,</v>

1532
01:06:53.851 --> 01:06:57.900
<v Speaker 5>it's like slightly less anonymous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but all these anonymous methods of</v>

1533
01:06:57.901 --> 01:07:01.740
<v Speaker 5>communicating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're gonna dissolve slowly but surely</v>

1534
01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:06.080
<v Speaker 5>the boundaries between people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not just going to be the NSA that</v>

1535
01:07:06.081 --> 01:07:08.730
<v Speaker 5>can find out exactly what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>and who's saying what to who.</v>

1536
01:07:08.731 --> 01:07:10.440
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be the whole fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

1537
01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:14.040
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's going to be able to do that</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's going to be very,</v>

1538
01:07:14.041 --> 01:07:15.570
<v Speaker 5>very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very weird.</v>

1539
01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:16.980
<v Speaker 5>The other thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

1540
01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.490
<v Speaker 1>we'll find out the people who are doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1541
01:07:19.491 --> 01:07:24.491
<v Speaker 1>I remember there was this like asshole</v>
<v Speaker 1>who made a bunch of twitter accounts to</v>

1542
01:07:25.391 --> 01:07:29.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right that women who worked in tech but</v>

1543
01:07:29.061 --> 01:07:32.270
<v Speaker 1>then just brand and women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't like cunts and he really</v>

1544
01:07:32.271 --> 01:07:35.060
<v Speaker 1>fixated on this one woman who is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>programmer at Tor,</v>

1545
01:07:35.061 --> 01:07:38.690
<v Speaker 1>which is an anonymous web browser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he like made seven twitter accounts</v>

1546
01:07:38.691 --> 01:07:40.280
<v Speaker 1>at one point until I tell her she was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cunt.</v>

1547
01:07:40.850 --> 01:07:44.510
<v Speaker 1>And so finally she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was like this,</v>

1548
01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:47.160
<v Speaker 1>this has gone on long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1549
01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:52.180
<v Speaker 1>when he was visiting her website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presumably to find more proof that she</v>

1550
01:07:52.461 --> 01:07:55.130
<v Speaker 1>was a [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>she got his Ip address track down where</v>

1551
01:07:55.131 --> 01:07:56.960
<v Speaker 1>he worked in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>posted his name and his workplace.</v>

1552
01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.780
<v Speaker 1>And with the line that was like his</v>
<v Speaker 1>classic,</v>

1553
01:07:59.781 --> 01:08:01.340
<v Speaker 1>she wrote should have used tour</v>
<v Speaker 1>foucault.</v>

1554
01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:04.300
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1555
01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.240
<v Speaker 3>if you went up to a bunch of bunch of</v>

1556
01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:10.140
<v Speaker 1>women or if you went on to a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>women at bars and just screamed like</v>

1557
01:08:10.141 --> 01:08:12.750
<v Speaker 1>cunt in their face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like eventually either them or their</v>

1558
01:08:12.751 --> 01:08:14.400
<v Speaker 1>boyfriend or someone around is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit you.</v>

1559
01:08:14.610 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 1>But because were doing this online</v>

1560
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:16.761
<v Speaker 5>you thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

1561
01:08:16.761 --> 01:08:18.100
<v Speaker 5>I can just go up to people and scream</v>
<v Speaker 5>content.</v>

1562
01:08:18.101 --> 01:08:19.880
<v Speaker 5>Nothing's ever going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And some,</v>

<v Speaker 5>sympathetic to anyone's going to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>seven twitter accounts just to call some</v>

<v Speaker 5>You're a young woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're already,</v>

1609
01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.910
<v Speaker 5>you already have a book published.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have many,</v>

1610
01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:16.391
<v Speaker 5>many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many,</v>

1611
01:10:16.391 --> 01:10:20.050
<v Speaker 5>many art pieces published.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If journalism things that you've done.</v>

1612
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:22.210
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's worked out for you and all this</v>

1613
01:10:22.211 --> 01:10:25.330
<v Speaker 5>romance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for some people that's not happening</v>

1614
01:10:25.331 --> 01:10:26.830
<v Speaker 5>for them and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God dammit.</v>

1615
01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:29.830
<v Speaker 5>I just think it would be better if there</v>
<v Speaker 5>was no secrets.</v>

1616
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:33.520
<v Speaker 5>But if you're that person and it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>working out for you,</v>

1617
01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:36.700
<v Speaker 5>probably if there are no secrets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would just have the crushing</v>

1618
01:10:36.701 --> 01:10:39.090
<v Speaker 5>disappointment of realizing either no</v>
<v Speaker 5>one was thinking of you or they're</v>

1619
01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:42.400
<v Speaker 5>thinking bad things about you when it</v>
<v Speaker 5>would just make you more unhappy maybe.</v>

1620
01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:46.960
<v Speaker 5>But is what we are as human beings</v>
<v Speaker 5>currently.</v>

1621
01:10:47.290 --> 01:10:52.290
<v Speaker 5>Is that a static state and is this a</v>
<v Speaker 5>state that we can expect to exist in,</v>

1622
01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:55.900
<v Speaker 5>in sort of this form speaking with our</v>
<v Speaker 5>mouths,</v>

1623
01:10:55.901 --> 01:10:59.590
<v Speaker 5>making noises with our faces,</v>
<v Speaker 5>interpretating it,</v>

1624
01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:05.010
<v Speaker 5>interpreting it in our own minds and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and listening to other people say things</v>

1625
01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:08.680
<v Speaker 5>and sort of establishing what their</v>
<v Speaker 5>meaning is that it is that does this is</v>

1626
01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:09.670
<v Speaker 5>going to be forever.</v>

1627
01:11:09.730 --> 01:11:10.930
<v Speaker 5>This is going to be how he went.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1628
01:11:10.931 --> 01:11:14.730
<v Speaker 5>no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like a monkey climbed off of a tree</v>

1629
01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:19.740
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and eventually became a person 200 plus</v>

1630
01:11:20.161 --> 01:11:21.930
<v Speaker 5>thousand years later or whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck it was.</v>

1631
01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:27.300
<v Speaker 5>Whatever has led us to improve,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to become what we are today is a</v>

1632
01:11:27.301 --> 01:11:29.430
<v Speaker 5>continuous cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to stop.</v>

1633
01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:32.730
<v Speaker 5>And I think that this idea that what</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've got right now like,</v>

1634
01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:35.670
<v Speaker 5>oh this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the romance of not knowing and you know,</v>

1635
01:11:35.671 --> 01:11:38.130
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing and it all works out well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking,</v>

1636
01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.810
<v Speaker 5>it's temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a little,</v>

1637
01:11:40.090 --> 01:11:45.000
<v Speaker 5>when we look back in time to the amount</v>
<v Speaker 5>of time that we've spent in this state,</v>

1638
01:11:45.001 --> 01:11:49.950
<v Speaker 5>currently the Internet state,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's been so brief but so transcendent.</v>

1639
01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:50.130
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1640
01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It like the most transcendent thing.</v>

1641
01:11:53.730 --> 01:11:58.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think as much or more than like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the printing press probably more my God,</v>

1642
01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:03.180
<v Speaker 1>one of the like really good articles I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was reading about the refugee stuff is</v>

1643
01:12:03.181 --> 01:12:06.780
<v Speaker 1>by the Iraqi journalists that I always</v>
<v Speaker 1>plug cause he's so brilliant.</v>

1644
01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Plays up dual a hud and he did this</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece about,</v>

1645
01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:12.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people making the trip and one of the</v>

1646
01:12:12.841 --> 01:12:17.310
<v Speaker 1>things he talked about is that this was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a trip that when he was a young man in</v>

1647
01:12:17.311 --> 01:12:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had tried to pay a smuggler to do and</v>

1648
01:12:18.891 --> 01:12:21.480
<v Speaker 1>the smuggler like defrauded him and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't get to do it but it was all under</v>

1649
01:12:21.481 --> 01:12:24.630
<v Speaker 1>the control of smugglers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas now if you have a cell phone,</v>

1650
01:12:24.631 --> 01:12:28.290
<v Speaker 1>like once you get from Turkey to Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you do that little four hour boat</v>

1651
01:12:28.291 --> 01:12:31.440
<v Speaker 1>ride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just put on the gps maps on your cell</v>

1652
01:12:31.441 --> 01:12:33.930
<v Speaker 1>phone and you walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1653
01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:37.830
<v Speaker 1>you don't need smugglers after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that crazy?</v>

1654
01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:41.760
<v Speaker 1>It completely up ended the end to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire like really like disgusting,</v>

1655
01:12:41.761 --> 01:12:43.020
<v Speaker 1>nasty business.</v>

1656
01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:47.060
<v Speaker 5>Well similar in a lot of ways to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>business of sneaking people over from</v>

1657
01:12:47.061 --> 01:12:48.650
<v Speaker 5>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1658
01:12:48.651 --> 01:12:51.560
<v Speaker 5>I have a friend who has been living in</v>
<v Speaker 5>America for</v>

1659
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:56.600
<v Speaker 5>more than 20 years because I've known</v>
<v Speaker 5>him for,</v>

1660
01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:59.240
<v Speaker 5>I've known him for 18 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So He's,</v>

1661
01:12:59.241 --> 01:13:01.100
<v Speaker 5>I think he's been living in America for</v>
<v Speaker 5>like 27,</v>

1662
01:13:01.101 --> 01:13:03.020
<v Speaker 5>28 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's how he came over.</v>

1663
01:13:03.021 --> 01:13:06.920
<v Speaker 5>I came over in a fucking van in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>middle of the night and they got out and</v>

1664
01:13:06.921 --> 01:13:09.320
<v Speaker 5>there was a guy behind them that had a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a stick,</v>

1665
01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:09.930
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1666
01:13:09.930 --> 01:13:11.450
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would take like a giant,</v>

1667
01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:14.360
<v Speaker 5>like branch from a tree with all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>leaves.</v>

1668
01:13:14.570 --> 01:13:17.870
<v Speaker 5>And as they walked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one guy behind them would waive the</v>

1669
01:13:17.871 --> 01:13:20.540
<v Speaker 5>branch back and forth to cover up their</v>
<v Speaker 5>footsteps.</v>

1670
01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:21.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1671
01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:23.570
<v Speaker 5>And they did it through the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the night.</v>

1672
01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:24.733
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1673
01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:29.300
<v Speaker 5>they eventually got to some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>border town where there was an Arizona</v>

1674
01:13:29.301 --> 01:13:32.840
<v Speaker 5>or whatever and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they made their way and infiltrated into</v>

1675
01:13:32.841 --> 01:13:36.110
<v Speaker 5>cities and eventually found jobs and</v>
<v Speaker 5>barely survived,</v>

1676
01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:39.200
<v Speaker 5>barely fed themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Fuck,</v>

1677
01:13:39.201 --> 01:13:41.360
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just imagined that life.</v>

1678
01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:44.780
<v Speaker 5>And then there's all these people we've</v>
<v Speaker 5>got to tighten up our borders.</v>

1679
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:45.811
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that,</v>

1680
01:13:45.811 --> 01:13:47.100
<v Speaker 1>that's high enough that the borders</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut.</v>

1681
01:13:47.101 --> 01:13:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's like idiot idea of that wall.</v>

1682
01:13:50.581 --> 01:13:52.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not even like physically possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>to build,</v>

1683
01:13:52.951 --> 01:13:56.010
<v Speaker 1>cause we'd have to go through all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>like rivers and take over people's land</v>

1684
01:13:56.011 --> 01:13:58.950
<v Speaker 1>and his like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did we get presidential candidates</v>

1685
01:13:58.951 --> 01:14:01.260
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that they're stupid,</v>

1686
01:14:01.261 --> 01:14:03.340
<v Speaker 1>not they're crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who like fundamentally denied</v>

1687
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:04.710
<v Speaker 1>physical reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is what,</v>

1688
01:14:04.711 --> 01:14:06.410
<v Speaker 1>this is where we are right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1689
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:07.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he</v>

1690
01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:09.990
<v Speaker 5>necessarily as a presidential candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't buy it.</v>

1691
01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:12.400
<v Speaker 1>You think you think it's to the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones look moderate</v>

1692
01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.400
<v Speaker 5>and reasonable?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1693
01:14:13.401 --> 01:14:14.181
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1694
01:14:14.181 --> 01:14:18.800
<v Speaker 5>some grand conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's him riding this crazy wave</v>

1695
01:14:18.801 --> 01:14:23.600
<v Speaker 5>of attention and trying to think in his</v>
<v Speaker 5>own mind that it's justified because</v>

1696
01:14:23.601 --> 01:14:27.770
<v Speaker 5>he's shining light on these important</v>
<v Speaker 5>issues in a way that only he can because</v>

1697
01:14:27.771 --> 01:14:30.410
<v Speaker 5>he's independently wealthy and he's not</v>
<v Speaker 5>bound to,</v>

1698
01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:31.401
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1699
01:14:31.401 --> 01:14:32.280
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1700
01:14:32.281 --> 01:14:33.800
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wishes of his constituents.</v>

1701
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:35.150
<v Speaker 5>He can just kind of go out there and</v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

1702
01:14:35.151 --> 01:14:39.260
<v Speaker 5>I want to put a giant wall up and call</v>
<v Speaker 5>it the trump wall and then we're going</v>

1703
01:14:39.261 --> 01:14:41.820
<v Speaker 5>to keep off the Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1704
01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.460
<v Speaker 5>And meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody wants to fucking kill him and</v>

1705
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:46.820
<v Speaker 5>in his face as fallen off his bones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

1706
01:14:46.821 --> 01:14:51.020
<v Speaker 5>it's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so cohen brothers ask that like,</v>

1707
01:14:51.021 --> 01:14:54.290
<v Speaker 5>he really does seem like satire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1708
01:14:54.291 --> 01:14:59.240
<v Speaker 5>he's like the ultimate American satire</v>
<v Speaker 5>president candidate.</v>

1709
01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever interview him like back</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

1710
01:15:01.370 --> 01:15:01.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1711
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:02.450
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1712
01:15:02.451 --> 01:15:03.650
<v Speaker 5>I've never met him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing.</v>

1713
01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:04.621
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1714
01:15:04.621 --> 01:15:06.000
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I confronted him at a press</v>

1715
01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:08.910
<v Speaker 1>conference in Dubai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like one of my finest moments.</v>

1716
01:15:08.970 --> 01:15:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really scared because Dubai is a,</v>

1717
01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:13.020
<v Speaker 1>it's please state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1718
01:15:13.021 --> 01:15:14.130
<v Speaker 1>there's no free speech there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real,</v>

1719
01:15:14.170 --> 01:15:15.130
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1720
01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:17.250
<v Speaker 1>they'll lock you up and they're rich</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

1721
01:15:17.251 --> 01:15:19.440
<v Speaker 1>They don't really care about your</v>
<v Speaker 1>American passport that much.</v>

1722
01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:22.860
<v Speaker 1>And so as that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this press conference where he had these</v>

1723
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:26.890
<v Speaker 1>golf courses that he was licensing his</v>
<v Speaker 1>name too,</v>

1724
01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:31.380
<v Speaker 1>and I had some Intel that the guys that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were building the golf courses were</v>

1725
01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:33.580
<v Speaker 1>getting 200 bucks a month to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>construction work.</v>

1726
01:15:34.090 --> 01:15:37.120
<v Speaker 1>And like the Emirates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average salary of an Mrr adi is,</v>

1727
01:15:37.121 --> 01:15:40.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like sixty thousand sixty</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand a year I think.</v>

1728
01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:42.310
<v Speaker 1>And he's gets 200 a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1729
01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:45.910
<v Speaker 1>to do like hard ass construction work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I get up during the press</v>

1730
01:15:45.911 --> 01:15:48.700
<v Speaker 1>conference where he's getting his ass</v>
<v Speaker 1>kissed and I'm waving my hand around and</v>

1731
01:15:48.701 --> 01:15:50.770
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Mr. Trump,</v>

1732
01:15:50.771 --> 01:15:55.771
<v Speaker 1>you've been saying how you know this all</v>
<v Speaker 1>stands for luxury and your construction</v>

1733
01:15:56.201 --> 01:15:58.540
<v Speaker 1>guys are getting $200 a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are You satisfied with that?</v>

1734
01:15:59.050 --> 01:16:01.560
<v Speaker 1>And his mouth fucking shriveled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen it like shriveled,</v>

1735
01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:05.170
<v Speaker 1>this little tiny Rosebud at hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I got so yelled at,</v>

1736
01:16:05.290 --> 01:16:07.750
<v Speaker 1>but he yelled at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't yell at me that the,</v>

1737
01:16:07.751 --> 01:16:11.170
<v Speaker 1>the underling yelled at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's under the underlying from the MRI</v>

1738
01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.090
<v Speaker 1>pr firm that was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did they say?</v>

1739
01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:15.910
<v Speaker 1>That's not an appropriate question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that?</v>

1740
01:16:15.911 --> 01:16:17.140
<v Speaker 1>Not Appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1741
01:16:17.141 --> 01:16:19.360
<v Speaker 1>And then the next question was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Trump,</v>

1742
01:16:19.361 --> 01:16:21.700
<v Speaker 1>you stand for luxury in Dubai stands for</v>
<v Speaker 1>luxury.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Some tough,</v>

1744

<v Speaker 1>So did he answer you?</v>

1745
01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:27.791
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't.</v>

1746
01:16:27.791 --> 01:16:30.760
<v Speaker 1>He didn't answer me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just like mouth trivial and like</v>

<v Speaker 1>everyone's mouth went really small with</v>

1748
01:16:33.821 --> 01:16:34.540
<v Speaker 1>anger.</v>

1749
01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:36.130
<v Speaker 5>Cos this is a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1750

1751
01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:37.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1752
01:16:37.921 --> 01:16:38.980
<v Speaker 1>that's the drawing and man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1753
01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.520
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was so angry at me cause I,</v>

1754
01:16:41.521 --> 01:16:44.190
<v Speaker 1>cause I took like a little startup to</v>
<v Speaker 1>just picture of him.</v>

1755
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:45.420
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

1756
01:16:45.421 --> 01:16:49.100
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about how New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be more like Dubai because in</v>

1757
01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:51.700
<v Speaker 1>Dubai everything was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1758
01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1759
01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.570
<v Speaker 1>he liked the ass kissing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that he built the greatest</v>

1760
01:16:54.571 --> 01:16:57.090
<v Speaker 1>architectural buildings in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I beg to differ.</v>

1761
01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:58.660
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1762
01:16:58.660 --> 01:16:59.980
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He really said that.</v>

1763
01:16:59.981 --> 01:17:02.770
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my friend Joey Diaz grew up in New York</v>

1764
01:17:02.771 --> 01:17:04.420
<v Speaker 5>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that people forget</v>

1765
01:17:04.421 --> 01:17:08.320
<v Speaker 5>about Donald Trump is all the disputes</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he had with small local</v>

1766
01:17:08.321 --> 01:17:11.660
<v Speaker 5>construction that used,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they use for projects.</v>

1767
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:14.630
<v Speaker 5>And now these people like wound up going</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of business and they,</v>

1768
01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:15.380
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they couldn't,</v>

1769
01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:18.100
<v Speaker 5>they couldn't battle him financially.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like,</v>

1770
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:22.840
<v Speaker 5>he's like this wave of people that hate</v>
<v Speaker 5>him in that whole construction business.</v>

1771
01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:26.240
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who's right and who's wrong</v>
<v Speaker 5>about those disputes,</v>

1772
01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:29.390
<v Speaker 5>but the idea that you could take that</v>
<v Speaker 5>model,</v>

1773
01:17:29.391 --> 01:17:34.220
<v Speaker 5>which is already problematic in America</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then take it and wrap it up in a</v>

1774
01:17:34.221 --> 01:17:39.221
<v Speaker 5>giant way and do buy that fucking piece</v>
<v Speaker 5>that vice did on those people that are</v>

1775
01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:44.720
<v Speaker 5>in Dubai that are trapped where they</v>
<v Speaker 5>take their passports.</v>

1776
01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:46.790
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I did a big piece on that.</v>

1777
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:48.230
<v Speaker 5>Did you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1778
01:17:48.231 --> 01:17:49.170
<v Speaker 5>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1779
01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:51.080
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how long ago was your amendment?</v>

1780
01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:53.090
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this was a few years ago.</v>

1781
01:17:53.091 --> 01:17:56.120
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe six or seven years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a,</v>

1782
01:17:56.121 --> 01:17:58.460
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a camp that they went to and these men</v>

1783
01:17:58.461 --> 01:18:00.530
<v Speaker 5>were crow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just openly weeping.</v>

1784
01:18:00.531 --> 01:18:03.260
<v Speaker 5>There was showing this like hole in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>ground where they have to shit.</v>

1785
01:18:03.530 --> 01:18:07.760
<v Speaker 5>And they were showing how poor the water</v>
<v Speaker 5>is and they had promised them a</v>

1786
01:18:07.761 --> 01:18:11.840
<v Speaker 5>substantial amount of money per month</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they were coming over from India and</v>

1787
01:18:11.841 --> 01:18:13.850
<v Speaker 5>the Philippines,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of third world countries.</v>

1788
01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:18.230
<v Speaker 5>And once they got there they would take</v>
<v Speaker 5>their passports away and then reduce</v>

1789
01:18:18.231 --> 01:18:20.770
<v Speaker 5>their salary traumatically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1790
01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:25.010
<v Speaker 5>and they couldn't leave and they were</v>
<v Speaker 5>forcing them to build these structures.</v>

1791
01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:25.850
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1792
01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:28.640
<v Speaker 5>It's totally like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the other really fucked up</v>

1793
01:18:28.641 --> 01:18:32.150
<v Speaker 5>thing is that like these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not passive.</v>

1794
01:18:32.151 --> 01:18:34.640
<v Speaker 5>Like they try to strike and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially very often.</v>

1795
01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:37.100
<v Speaker 5>Not only do they reduce their salaries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just don't pay him.</v>

1796
01:18:37.101 --> 01:18:38.840
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and can you imagine like you've like a</v>

1797
01:18:38.841 --> 01:18:40.190
<v Speaker 5>wife and kids at home,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1798
01:18:40.191 --> 01:18:42.860
<v Speaker 5>who are like depending on you to like go</v>
<v Speaker 5>to another country and you know,</v>

1799
01:18:42.861 --> 01:18:44.390
<v Speaker 5>make,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make money for the family and then you</v>

1800
01:18:44.391 --> 01:18:45.830
<v Speaker 5>just don't get paid for three months.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1801
01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:47.030
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1802
01:18:47.031 --> 01:18:49.790
<v Speaker 5>breaking a whole family.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so these guys will do strikes,</v>

1803
01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:52.430
<v Speaker 5>they'll do sit downs in front of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>buses and then they hold them off to</v>

1804
01:18:52.431 --> 01:18:54.600
<v Speaker 5>jail and deport them when they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's,</v>

1805
01:18:54.601 --> 01:18:56.840
<v Speaker 5>it's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so scary that it's again,</v>

1806
01:18:56.841 --> 01:18:59.600
<v Speaker 5>what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the spectrum of human behavior that,</v>

1807
01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:03.170
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's like a few steps away from</v>
<v Speaker 5>being a serial killer,</v>

1808
01:19:03.171 --> 01:19:08.171
<v Speaker 5>but it's just this s s sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>pathological detachment from compassion.</v>

1809
01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:11.630
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you don't,</v>

1810
01:19:11.631 --> 01:19:14.960
<v Speaker 5>you don't care about these people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are risking their lives to make these</v>

1811
01:19:14.961 --> 01:19:18.320
<v Speaker 5>giant buildings that are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these royal people are gonna walk on</v>

1812
01:19:18.321 --> 01:19:22.730
<v Speaker 5>roses and they throw at their feet and</v>
<v Speaker 5>step into these things and go skiing in</v>

1813
01:19:22.731 --> 01:19:23.450
<v Speaker 5>the middle of summer.</v>

1814
01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:27.380
<v Speaker 5>And these gigantic buildings they make,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they make these crazy fucking structures</v>

1815
01:19:27.381 --> 01:19:30.470
<v Speaker 5>over there cause they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they almost have an unlimited budget.</v>

1816
01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:33.350
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like they have like an idea</v>
<v Speaker 5>in their head,</v>

1817
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:36.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would like to fly in doors and they're</v>

1818
01:19:36.711 --> 01:19:37.700
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1819
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:41.930
<v Speaker 5>we're going to build you a mile high</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking gigantic building where you</v>

1820
01:19:41.931 --> 01:19:44.300
<v Speaker 5>could fly inside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1821
01:19:44.301 --> 01:19:47.150
<v Speaker 5>and then you have planes that you could</v>
<v Speaker 5>fly indoors.</v>

1822
01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:50.690
<v Speaker 5>Like I shouldn't even have said that</v>
<v Speaker 5>because someone in Dubai is probably</v>

1823
01:19:50.691 --> 01:19:55.691
<v Speaker 5>listening and a light bulb went off in</v>
<v Speaker 5>their head yes and indoor flight course.</v>

1824
01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:02.030
<v Speaker 5>And it's what's so strange is like I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>prepared to like hate Dubai.</v>

1825
01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:04.250
<v Speaker 5>How Dubai look like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hate how Dubai is,</v>

1826
01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:08.250
<v Speaker 5>but I mean I was prepared to like</v>
<v Speaker 5>aesthetically hated as well as ethically</v>

1827
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:10.260
<v Speaker 1>hated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's weird is when you go there,</v>

1828
01:20:10.261 --> 01:20:11.430
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

1829
01:20:11.431 --> 01:20:13.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I was looking at that</v>

1830
01:20:13.681 --> 01:20:15.030
<v Speaker 1>building like the Shard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the worlds,</v>

1831
01:20:15.150 --> 01:20:18.240
<v Speaker 1>the worlds tallest building Alberg did</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go in it?</v>

1832
01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went down to the ground floor and I</v>

1833
01:20:19.921 --> 01:20:23.610
<v Speaker 1>bought a $20 cup of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$20 is $20.</v>

1834
01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How it taste like a fucking cup of iced</v>

1835
01:20:26.821 --> 01:20:28.420
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a day.</v>

1836
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Was that was just sort of a bevel an</v>
<v Speaker 1>object.</v>

1837
01:20:31.021 --> 01:20:35.580
<v Speaker 1>But so I was like going into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going into it like prepared to</v>

1838
01:20:35.581 --> 01:20:37.230
<v Speaker 1>like really like aesthetically judge it</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1839
01:20:37.231 --> 01:20:39.210
<v Speaker 1>And like the thing is it's like so</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>

1840
01:20:39.211 --> 01:20:43.560
<v Speaker 1>And then I was remembering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like for cy is also beautiful and</v>

1841
01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.980
<v Speaker 1>look at how that was made and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>this weird thing cause you,</v>

1842
01:20:46.981 --> 01:20:50.640
<v Speaker 1>you think about how splendors always</v>
<v Speaker 1>made and how like the most beautiful</v>

1843
01:20:50.641 --> 01:20:51.770
<v Speaker 1>things in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1844
01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:54.810
<v Speaker 1>always are constructed and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely go there and you're like,</v>

1845
01:20:54.811 --> 01:20:58.800
<v Speaker 1>this is the city of the future and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the new aristocrats and this is</v>

1846
01:20:58.801 --> 01:21:03.240
<v Speaker 1>beautiful and it's all being built by</v>
<v Speaker 1>slaves who are dying to build it.</v>

1847
01:21:03.630 --> 01:21:06.750
<v Speaker 5>Well I dunno if it's the future with</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff in the future of that area,</v>

1848
01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:11.780
<v Speaker 5>but they just have this strange world</v>
<v Speaker 5>where it was incredibly poor up until</v>

1849
01:21:11.821 --> 01:21:16.821
<v Speaker 5>just a few decades ago and then all of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>sudden they start pumping oil out of</v>

1850
01:21:18.001 --> 01:21:23.001
<v Speaker 5>that place and the money is astronomical</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the change in the amount of money</v>

1851
01:21:24.931 --> 01:21:27.720
<v Speaker 5>that area has,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the few that have it,</v>

1852
01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:28.640
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1853
01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.900
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the disparity of wealth is just</v>

1854
01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.400
<v Speaker 5>unimaginable.</v>

1855
01:21:32.690 --> 01:21:35.810
<v Speaker 1>One of the kinds of interesting things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they did in Abu Dhabi,</v>

1856
01:21:35.811 --> 01:21:38.150
<v Speaker 1>which actually I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I admire it,</v>

1857
01:21:38.151 --> 01:21:41.000
<v Speaker 1>is that in a lot of countries when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>get oil money,</v>

1858
01:21:41.090 --> 01:21:42.380
<v Speaker 1>like someone steals it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1859
01:21:42.381 --> 01:21:45.170
<v Speaker 1>up top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in Abu Dhabi what they did was they</v>

1860
01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:49.160
<v Speaker 1>gave citizens a lot of entitlements to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1861
01:21:49.161 --> 01:21:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Like you get free education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're in a Morati,</v>

1862
01:21:51.021 --> 01:21:54.110
<v Speaker 1>you get a free healthcare housing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a stipend,</v>

1863
01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:55.940
<v Speaker 1>a Mrit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women are like super,</v>

1864
01:21:55.941 --> 01:21:57.020
<v Speaker 1>super educated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most,</v>

1865
01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:59.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the phds are Mrid women.</v>

1866
01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:00.770
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's awesome.</v>

1867
01:22:00.771 --> 01:22:03.590
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flip side of that is like citizens</v>

1868
01:22:03.591 --> 01:22:05.950
<v Speaker 1>are only 10% of the population and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 90,</v>

1869
01:22:06.050 --> 01:22:09.080
<v Speaker 1>90% of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who do everything,</v>

1870
01:22:09.081 --> 01:22:10.340
<v Speaker 1>like the engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shop,</v>

1871
01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:11.900
<v Speaker 1>the shop workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the maids,</v>

1872
01:22:11.930 --> 01:22:12.820
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1873
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:15.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>construction dudes like the people who</v>

1874
01:22:15.021 --> 01:22:18.170
<v Speaker 1>do every manner of work are not citizens</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have no rights to anything.</v>

1875
01:22:18.410 --> 01:22:19.243
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1876
01:22:19.670 --> 01:22:21.540
<v Speaker 5>That's a trip.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're,</v>

1877
01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're looking on the outside at that</v>

1878
01:22:24.681 --> 01:22:25.760
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

01:22:25.761 --> 01:22:26.240

1880
01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:29.630
<v Speaker 5>I've talked to people that I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been to Dubai and I've been to Abu</v>

1881
01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:31.850
<v Speaker 5>Dhabi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was there for a UFC event.</v>

1882
01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:33.830
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1883
01:22:33.831 --> 01:22:36.500
<v Speaker 5>without getting into anything political,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's beautiful,</v>

1884
01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:37.101
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're like,</v>

1885
01:22:37.101 --> 01:22:37.731
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are,</v>

1886
01:22:37.731 --> 01:22:40.070
<v Speaker 5>these people have done a great job and</v>
<v Speaker 5>constructing these things.</v>

1887
01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:44.080
<v Speaker 5>But the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guys that I was with,</v>

1888
01:22:44.081 --> 01:22:45.950
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of them went to,</v>

1889
01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:49.040
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they went to Dubai because we have the</v>

1890
01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:51.350
<v Speaker 5>night off and I was tired so I to stay</v>
<v Speaker 5>home,</v>

1891
01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:52.610

<v Speaker 5>we're going to go to a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know how it just,</v>

1893
01:22:54.361 --> 01:22:57.280
<v Speaker 5>some places you can go to drink,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you have to drink in certain play</v>

1894
01:22:57.281 --> 01:23:01.130
<v Speaker 5>because it's illegal to have alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's some sort of weird loophole</v>

1895
01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:04.490
<v Speaker 5>and they said it was all Russian</v>
<v Speaker 5>prostitutes.</v>

1896
01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:09.820
<v Speaker 5>They said it was just like these</v>
<v Speaker 5>predatory coyote women that had crossed</v>

1897
01:23:10.241 --> 01:23:13.450
<v Speaker 5>over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would just like looking to dig just a</v>

<v Speaker 5>dudes.</v>

1899
01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:17.801
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

1900
01:23:17.801 --> 01:23:18.281
<v Speaker 5>Like I,</v>

01:23:18.281 --> 01:23:20.740
<v Speaker 5>my friend went to a bar and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not bullshitting.</v>

1902
01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:24.220
<v Speaker 5>This bar might've been 80% hookers and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

1903
01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:24.841

<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>

1904
01:23:24.841 --> 01:23:26.170
<v Speaker 5>I never seen anything like it in my</v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

1905
01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:27.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Women go over there to like,</v>

1906

<v Speaker 5>Bet You can.</v>

1907
01:23:30.851 --> 01:23:35.020
<v Speaker 5>I bet you can fucking clean it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's probably really dangerous too,</v>

1908
01:23:35.050 --> 01:23:36.290
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1909
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:38.410
<v Speaker 5>I never did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never really did research on like sex</v>

1910
01:23:38.411 --> 01:23:39.820
<v Speaker 5>work in Dubai.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like my,</v>

1911
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:41.800
<v Speaker 5>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll be like,</v>

1912
01:23:41.801 --> 01:23:45.580
<v Speaker 5>I know mostly about construction work in</v>
<v Speaker 5>something about the maids and not so</v>

1913
01:23:45.581 --> 01:23:47.770
<v Speaker 5>much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think for anyone who's not a</v>

1914
01:23:47.771 --> 01:23:50.380
<v Speaker 5>citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's dangerous because you like don't</v>

1915
01:23:50.410 --> 01:23:52.330
<v Speaker 5>have any real rights if you're not a</v>
<v Speaker 5>citizen.</v>

1916
01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:53.051
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember,</v>

1917
01:23:53.051 --> 01:23:56.530
<v Speaker 5>I think it was a British couple that</v>
<v Speaker 5>were making out on the beach and they</v>

1918
01:23:56.531 --> 01:23:58.420
<v Speaker 5>were arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were just kissing.</v>

1919
01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:00.790
<v Speaker 5>They were just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they were openly showing affection</v>

1920
01:24:00.791 --> 01:24:02.650
<v Speaker 5>on the beach and they were thrown in</v>
<v Speaker 5>jail.</v>

1921
01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:03.850
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

1922
01:24:03.850 --> 01:24:05.080
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is another one.</v>

1923
01:24:05.081 --> 01:24:08.230
<v Speaker 5>This is the craziest one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a British man who,</v>

1924
01:24:08.290 --> 01:24:13.290
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had eaten a poppy seed Bagel and</v>

1925
01:24:14.891 --> 01:24:19.390
<v Speaker 5>poppy seeds will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you will test positive for heroin if you</v>

1926
01:24:19.391 --> 01:24:20.890
<v Speaker 5>eat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's trace amounts,</v>

1927
01:24:20.891 --> 01:24:24.340
<v Speaker 5>but obviously it's not enough to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychoactive,</v>

1928
01:24:24.341 --> 01:24:27.790
<v Speaker 5>but it's enough to show up in a really</v>
<v Speaker 5>comprehensive blood examination.</v>

1929
01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:32.830
<v Speaker 5>So they tested this guy and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he tested positive for heroin and they</v>

1930
01:24:32.831 --> 01:24:35.560
<v Speaker 5>put him in a fucking cell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

1931
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:40.030
<v Speaker 5>he had a poppy seed Bagel at Heathrow</v>
<v Speaker 5>airport and that big old got him locked</v>

1932
01:24:40.031 --> 01:24:41.470
<v Speaker 5>up in a jail cell.</v>

1933
01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:43.900
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 5>executive at Brillstein Gray,</v>

1935

<v Speaker 5>Entertainment Group.</v>

1936
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:53.010

1946
01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:10.870
<v Speaker 5>They arrested her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>locked her up,</v>

1947
01:25:10.871 --> 01:25:13.780
<v Speaker 5>took her passport,</v>

01:25:13.781 --> 01:25:17.860
<v Speaker 5>Melatonin and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somehow or another somehow got word of</v>

1949
01:25:17.861 --> 01:25:22.000
<v Speaker 5>it and they got her out eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what a terrifying moment it must</v>

1950
01:25:22.001 --> 01:25:23.920
<v Speaker 5>have been for her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was another guy who had a</v>

1951
01:25:23.921 --> 01:25:28.240
<v Speaker 5>marijuana seed like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or a stem or a piece of marijuana that</v>

1952
01:25:28.241 --> 01:25:32.020
<v Speaker 5>was wedged in between the tread of his</v>
<v Speaker 5>shoes.</v>

1953
01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:35.080
<v Speaker 5>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that was enough to put him in jail</v>

1954
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:38.650
<v Speaker 5>and he was going to be sentenced for</v>
<v Speaker 5>some fucking astronomical amount of</v>

1955
01:25:38.651 --> 01:25:39.070
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

1956
01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:40.600
<v Speaker 5>And I don't know what happened to that</v>
<v Speaker 5>poor guy,</v>

1957
01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:45.840
<v Speaker 5>but unfortunately for him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was a black guy with dreadlocks from</v>

1958
01:25:46.061 --> 01:25:48.150
<v Speaker 5>England and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

1959
01:25:48.210 --> 01:25:52.330
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Forever cage forever.</v>

1960
01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:53.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a really,</v>

1961
01:25:53.290 --> 01:25:54.700
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really racist.</v>

1962
01:25:54.701 --> 01:25:56.140
<v Speaker 5>Some of them are here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll go right here.</v>

1963
01:25:56.141 --> 01:25:59.680
<v Speaker 5>Some of the horror stories would be</v>
<v Speaker 5>reported by the BBC four year jail term</v>

1964
01:25:59.681 --> 01:26:04.681

<v Speaker 5>cannabis stuck to the bottom of his</v>

1965
01:26:05.451 --> 01:26:07.430
<v Speaker 5>shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the guy that's Keith Brown.</v>

1966
01:26:08.150 --> 01:26:13.150
<v Speaker 5>Robert Dalton on trial for alleged</v>
<v Speaker 5>possession of 0.3 grams of cannabis,</v>

1967
01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:18.940
<v Speaker 5>0.03 unnamed 20 year old on trial for</v>
<v Speaker 5>allegedly zaw cannabis.</v>

1968
01:26:19.071 --> 01:26:19.904
<v Speaker 5>Mostly.</v>

1969
01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:21.820
<v Speaker 1>I had this one dude I met there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1970
01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:24.430
<v Speaker 1>he's on the rowdy and he was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

1971
01:26:24.431 --> 01:26:29.431
<v Speaker 1>His name is Allen Edmonds store and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like he's so brave,</v>

1972
01:26:30.581 --> 01:26:31.780
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you have so many privileges like</v>

1973
01:26:31.781 --> 01:26:34.300
<v Speaker 1>as an Mri especially came from like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good family and everything,</v>

1974
01:26:34.301 --> 01:26:36.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can really just coast it if you're</v>

1975
01:26:36.131 --> 01:26:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Mrd and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1976
01:26:37.361 --> 01:26:41.350
<v Speaker 1>from a well off family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he made a web forum that let people</v>

1977
01:26:41.351 --> 01:26:43.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss,</v>

1978
01:26:43.450 --> 01:26:45.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically discuss the royal family</v>

1979
01:26:45.431 --> 01:26:46.600

<v Speaker 1>And it also,</v>

1980
01:26:46.650 --> 01:26:48.400
<v Speaker 1>it let people discuss religion kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly.</v>

1981
01:26:48.401 --> 01:26:50.650
<v Speaker 1>And if you were an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can talk about it on the web forum</v>

1982
01:26:51.190 --> 01:26:55.090
<v Speaker 1>and they fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they locked him up for was hinge Elford</v>

1983
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:58.930
<v Speaker 1>I have to have to check this but I want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say was around nine months and then</v>

1984
01:26:58.931 --> 01:27:02.470
<v Speaker 1>factored in with scabies when he was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>jail and then when they let him out</v>

1985
01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.000
<v Speaker 1>affected and purposely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1986
01:27:04.001 --> 01:27:05.650
<v Speaker 1>that's what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that they like gave him a</v>

1987
01:27:05.651 --> 01:27:06.910
<v Speaker 1>blanket that had scabies on it.</v>

1988
01:27:08.350 --> 01:27:13.350
<v Speaker 1>And then when he was out the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had the series of unfortunate events</v>

1989
01:27:13.391 --> 01:27:17.830
<v Speaker 1>that happened up over $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>accidentally disappeared from his bank</v>

01:27:17.831 --> 01:27:20.230
<v Speaker 1>account and no one knows how it got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how I got missing.</v>

1991
01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:24.520
<v Speaker 1>And then like on two occasions at guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sort of jumped out and beat the</v>

1992
01:27:24.521 --> 01:27:26.290
<v Speaker 1>shit out of him and no one knows who</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were.</v>

1993
01:27:26.291 --> 01:27:28.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a mystery and his car just gets</v>

1994
01:27:28.751 --> 01:27:31.720
<v Speaker 1>stolen all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the tires keep getting error taken</v>

1995
01:27:31.721 --> 01:27:32.554
<v Speaker 1>out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1996

01:30:12.511 --> 01:30:13.450
<v Speaker 1>months now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

2063
01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:15.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they've even really</v>
<v Speaker 1>charged them yet.</v>

2064
01:30:15.001 --> 01:30:16.560
<v Speaker 1>They're just like leaked statements to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the press.</v>

2065
01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2066
01:30:19.081 --> 01:30:19.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2067
01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:20.920
<v Speaker 1>that aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2068
01:30:21.570 --> 01:30:22.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2069
01:30:22.061 --> 01:30:25.020
<v Speaker 1>the political repression aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do find it assembled,</v>

2070
01:30:25.021 --> 01:30:28.590
<v Speaker 1>be marvelous city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No place is perfect.</v>

2071
01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:32.040
<v Speaker 1>They charged him with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what is his actual w what is their</v>

2072
01:30:32.041 --> 01:30:34.020
<v Speaker 1>grievance with them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does the actual issue,</v>

2073
01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:37.680
<v Speaker 1>he was going with these two British vice</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists and they were covering a</v>

2074
01:30:37.681 --> 01:30:42.681
<v Speaker 1>clashes between the Turkish government</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Kurds in the south and they pick</v>

2075
01:30:42.901 --> 01:30:45.480
<v Speaker 1>them up doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they just decided they didn't like</v>

2076
01:30:45.481 --> 01:30:47.420
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] he's doing Carl's in</v>

2077
01:30:47.421 --> 01:30:48.260
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they,</v>

2078
01:30:48.261 --> 01:30:52.410
<v Speaker 1>they've been actually like deporting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking with a lot of journalists who</v>

2079
01:30:52.411 --> 01:30:54.570
<v Speaker 1>have been doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>

2080
01:30:54.810 --> 01:30:57.450
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two British guys got out cause you</v>

2081
01:30:57.451 --> 01:31:00.480
<v Speaker 1>know they're British.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you're in a rocky Kurd like</v>

2082
01:31:00.510 --> 01:31:01.500
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who's going to,</v>

2083
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:03.840
<v Speaker 1>who's going to be the person putting</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure on Turkey for you?</v>

2084
01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:07.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're aware of that Saudi</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabian blogger that's been beaten</v>

2085
01:31:07.741 --> 01:31:09.840
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2086
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:12.300
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking horrible story too.</v>

2087
01:31:12.690 --> 01:31:14.750
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the weirdest aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>

2088
01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:18.390
<v Speaker 1>A relationship with Saudi Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we'll talk about all the</v>

2089
01:31:18.391 --> 01:31:20.610
<v Speaker 1>atrocities that are committed by all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these different countries,</v>

2090
01:31:20.611 --> 01:31:25.611
<v Speaker 1>but Saudi Arabia is</v>
<v Speaker 1>moderate and meanwhile they like sent,</v>

2091
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:29.100
<v Speaker 1>they sentenced a poet to death for</v>
<v Speaker 1>poetry in Saudi recently.</v>

2092
01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:33.200
<v Speaker 3>How bad was the poetry though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it like def jam slam comedy in the</v>

2093
01:31:33.201 --> 01:31:34.040
<v Speaker 3>little things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

2094
01:31:34.041 --> 01:31:35.210
<v Speaker 3>Why are you poetry shaming?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you,</v>

2095
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:37.400
<v Speaker 3>why are you have what you have to free</v>
<v Speaker 3>verse shame right now,</v>

2096
01:31:37.410 --> 01:31:41.120
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2097
01:31:41.190 --> 01:31:43.340
<v Speaker 3>it's a phrase in reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you make culture that doesn't like</v>

2098
01:31:43.341 --> 01:31:44.900
<v Speaker 3>Reimer or how did he meet her or</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything?</v>

2099
01:31:45.670 --> 01:31:46.820
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Haikus a short one.</v>

2100
01:31:46.821 --> 01:31:48.590
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not much into poetry,</v>

2101
01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:50.270
<v Speaker 3>but I remember I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've gone to,</v>

2102
01:31:50.271 --> 01:31:54.800
<v Speaker 3>I went to a poetry slam in Venice once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the perfect place to go because</v>

2103
01:31:54.801 --> 01:31:56.990
<v Speaker 3>people take themselves so fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously.</v>

2104
01:31:57.350 --> 01:32:00.400
<v Speaker 3>And that was with a buddy of mine and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were a high</v>

2105
01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:04.000
<v Speaker 2>as you should ever be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you were in public walking around</v>

2106
01:32:04.001 --> 01:32:06.790
<v Speaker 2>talking to people like barely aware of</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

2107
01:32:07.090 --> 01:32:10.710
<v Speaker 2>And we walked by this place and it was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>poetry slam and we ha,</v>

2108
01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:12.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to go inside.</v>

2109
01:32:12.131 --> 01:32:15.010
<v Speaker 2>We have to go inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we went inside and we were both like</v>

2110
01:32:15.011 --> 01:32:17.620
<v Speaker 2>biting her hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try not to laugh because it was just so</v>

2111
01:32:17.621 --> 01:32:20.140
<v Speaker 2>for po preposterous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so you know,</v>

2112
01:32:20.141 --> 01:32:25.141
<v Speaker 2>that really just pretentious save the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world type</v>

2113
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:27.303
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

2114
01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:29.840
<v Speaker 2>20 year old white guys with dreadlocks.</v>

2115
01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2116
01:32:30.970 --> 01:32:31.803
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2117
01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:34.230
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2118
01:32:34.370 --> 01:32:38.700
<v Speaker 1>I think as a visual artist I have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar thing when I see like really,</v>

2119
01:32:38.701 --> 01:32:42.930
<v Speaker 1>really bad art work and I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only are you shaming yourself,</v>

2120
01:32:42.931 --> 01:32:44.660
<v Speaker 1>you're shaming my whole profession here.</v>

2121
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:47.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what I also like as I've</v>

2122
01:32:47.391 --> 01:32:52.391
<v Speaker 2>gotten older and I've sort of understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nuance of life,</v>

2123
01:32:52.401 --> 01:32:55.070
<v Speaker 2>like what this guy's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is stupid shame,</v>

2124
01:32:55.250 --> 01:32:57.320
<v Speaker 2>shamp slam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever poetry.</v>

2125
01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:00.710
<v Speaker 2>What he really is doing is she's trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to express himself and he's developing</v>

2126
01:33:00.711 --> 01:33:03.350
<v Speaker 2>as a person and right now it's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous to other people that are</v>

2127
01:33:03.351 --> 01:33:08.060
<v Speaker 2>maybe a little bit more well versed in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ways of the world and with a more</v>

2128
01:33:08.061 --> 01:33:10.040
<v Speaker 2>social experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he's trying to do is like,</v>

2129
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:14.210
<v Speaker 2>he sees the world is wrong and he wants</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get Social Brownie points by pointing</v>

2130
01:33:14.211 --> 01:33:17.210
<v Speaker 2>it out and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people clap and cheer and he's so,</v>

2131
01:33:17.211 --> 01:33:22.211
<v Speaker 2>he sat down this loose leaf binder and</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote all this stuff out and he's just</v>

2132
01:33:22.581 --> 01:33:25.520
<v Speaker 2>feels like he's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one day he'll look back at that and</v>

2133
01:33:25.521 --> 01:33:26.840
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a fucking moron.</v>

2134
01:33:26.841 --> 01:33:28.430
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll look back at,</v>

2135
01:33:28.730 --> 01:33:33.730
<v Speaker 2>I have a comedy notebook from 1990 and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>should probably burn it in case someone</v>

2136
01:33:34.101 --> 01:33:35.420
<v Speaker 2>breaks in my house and finds it.</v>

2137
01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you die then someone will</v>

2138
01:33:39.130 --> 01:33:42.100
<v Speaker 1>publish the collected papers of Joe</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogan and this will be your most famous</v>

2139
01:33:42.101 --> 01:33:42.934
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2140
01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:46.220
<v Speaker 2>a bit in there about wonder woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like trying to explain wonder woman.</v>

2141
01:33:46.221 --> 01:33:48.560
<v Speaker 2>It's so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was,</v>

2142
01:33:48.561 --> 01:33:50.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>21 years old or whatever the fuck I was</v>

2143
01:33:50.781 --> 01:33:51.650
<v Speaker 2>at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2144
01:33:52.250 --> 01:33:53.620
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're,</v>

2145
01:33:53.690 --> 01:33:55.740
<v Speaker 2>you're when you suck then one of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>yacht,</v>

2146
01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:57.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean it takes a while to get good at</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2147
01:33:58.050 --> 01:34:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Many years I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I look back at my old drawings</v>

2148
01:34:00.771 --> 01:34:03.470
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did I ever get hired as an artist?</v>

2149
01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:07.340
<v Speaker 1>What delusional process did I ever think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'd be an artist putting these</v>

2150
01:34:07.341 --> 01:34:10.550
<v Speaker 1>things out there and again and again and</v>
<v Speaker 1>again in the face of very deserted</v>

2151
01:34:10.551 --> 01:34:13.910
<v Speaker 1>projection for many years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it worked out right?</v>

2152
01:34:13.911 --> 01:34:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Because like if you just keep chipping</v>
<v Speaker 1>away at it and eventually eventually get</v>

2153
01:34:18.681 --> 01:34:19.550
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really,</v>

2154
01:34:19.551 --> 01:34:22.100
<v Speaker 1>I tried to actually really write about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in my book because I feel like</v>

2155
01:34:22.101 --> 01:34:25.160
<v Speaker 1>sometimes a lot of artists they front</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they act like,</v>

2156
01:34:25.190 --> 01:34:26.570
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just really good from the start</v>

2157
01:34:26.571 --> 01:34:28.280
<v Speaker 1>and then it was really easy and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2158
01:34:28.281 --> 01:34:29.690
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sucked from the start.</v>

2159
01:34:29.691 --> 01:34:30.524
<v Speaker 1>And it was really hard.</v>

2160
01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most comedians will tell you that they</v>

2161
01:34:33.681 --> 01:34:36.230
<v Speaker 2>suck from the start except the ones that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are aren't that good,</v>

2162
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:39.710
<v Speaker 2>which will claim that they were always</v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome was the ones,</v>

2163
01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:42.140
<v Speaker 2>I think all my friends that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are really good,</v>

2164
01:34:42.141 --> 01:34:44.120
<v Speaker 2>they'll all tell you they're fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>newer were terrible.</v>

2165
01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:46.970
<v Speaker 2>I have um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two young daughters and one of the cool</v>

2166
01:34:46.971 --> 01:34:49.430
<v Speaker 2>things is watching their art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're really in the art,</v>

2167
01:34:49.431 --> 01:34:51.260
<v Speaker 2>especially my seven year old is really</v>
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>

2168
01:34:51.261 --> 01:34:52.790
<v Speaker 2>She draws every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so cool.</v>

2169
01:34:52.850 --> 01:34:53.690
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2170
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:57.740
<v Speaker 2>W W I watch her early stuff like I save</v>
<v Speaker 2>all our and,</v>

2171
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:00.620
<v Speaker 5>or at least representations like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2172
01:35:00.621 --> 01:35:05.621
<v Speaker 5>like some of it and watching like there</v>
<v Speaker 5>early like control of her motor skills</v>

2173
01:35:07.281 --> 01:35:10.520
<v Speaker 5>in our hands from the time she was like</v>
<v Speaker 5>three to four years later.</v>

2174
01:35:10.530 --> 01:35:13.480
<v Speaker 5>This just dramatic difference in what</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's ability,</v>

2175
01:35:13.481 --> 01:35:16.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>her ability to draw things and draw</v>

2176
01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:20.390
<v Speaker 5>representations and figure out like</v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective and sizes.</v>

2177
01:35:20.391 --> 01:35:22.970
<v Speaker 5>And we were going through this book</v>
<v Speaker 5>yesterday,</v>

2178
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:27.410
<v Speaker 5>she has this um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how to draw a figures book and it was</v>

2179
01:35:27.411 --> 01:35:31.490
<v Speaker 5>the weirdest fucking thing because um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was these princesses,</v>

2180
01:35:31.491 --> 01:35:34.400
<v Speaker 5>it's just trying to draw princesses and</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2181
01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:36.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking at the book and we're going</v>

2182
01:35:36.981 --> 01:35:39.800
<v Speaker 5>through it together and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like one of those books where you</v>

2183
01:35:39.801 --> 01:35:41.510
<v Speaker 5>have a framework,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2184
01:35:41.511 --> 01:35:45.680
<v Speaker 5>like there's like balls and sticks and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you try to like make the framework and</v>

2185
01:35:45.681 --> 01:35:48.430
<v Speaker 5>then you had the close to the framework</v>
<v Speaker 5>and totally.</v>

2186
01:35:48.570 --> 01:35:53.570
<v Speaker 5>But the women's legs were like more than</v>
<v Speaker 5>twice as long as they should have been.</v>

2187
01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:58.760
<v Speaker 5>When you're trying to do those like</v>
<v Speaker 5>fashiony cartoon drawings,</v>

2188
01:35:58.761 --> 01:36:02.120
<v Speaker 5>everyone is like so stretched out and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what's weird is that you get so</v>

2189
01:36:02.121 --> 01:36:05.060
<v Speaker 5>used to seeing that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that when you see like cartoon people</v>

2190
01:36:05.061 --> 01:36:06.590
<v Speaker 5>done it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're real proportions.</v>

2191
01:36:06.591 --> 01:36:08.930
<v Speaker 5>They all look like weird and stubby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2192
01:36:09.170 --> 01:36:12.140
<v Speaker 5>Well that's gotta be weird for it</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it doesn't seem that way for</v>

2193
01:36:12.141 --> 01:36:14.030
<v Speaker 5>men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I was looking at the</v>

2194
01:36:14.031 --> 01:36:16.730
<v Speaker 5>representations of men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're fairly proportionate,</v>

2195
01:36:17.090 --> 01:36:18.200
<v Speaker 5>but with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with women,</v>

2196
01:36:18.201 --> 01:36:22.760
<v Speaker 5>it was all these insanely long legs and</v>
<v Speaker 5>insanely skinny bodies.</v>

2197
01:36:22.761 --> 01:36:25.220
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is fucking strange.</v>

2198
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:27.530
<v Speaker 5>So much so that I had a pointed out to</v>
<v Speaker 5>her,</v>

2199
01:36:27.890 --> 01:36:28.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's like,</v>

2200
01:36:28.791 --> 01:36:29.510
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2201
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:30.590
<v Speaker 5>she's drawing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

2202
01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:32.570
<v Speaker 5>well here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2203
01:36:32.571 --> 01:36:33.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

2204
01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:35.210
<v Speaker 5>you can draw it like this.</v>

2205
01:36:35.210 --> 01:36:37.520
<v Speaker 5>One of the beautiful things about art is</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can do whatever you want.</v>

2206
01:36:37.521 --> 01:36:40.730
<v Speaker 5>If you want to make people that have</v>
<v Speaker 5>giant hands that are size of those phone</v>

2207
01:36:40.731 --> 01:36:42.590
<v Speaker 5>number ones that people were at a</v>
<v Speaker 5>football game,</v>

2208
01:36:42.591 --> 01:36:44.750
<v Speaker 5>you could totally do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one can stop you.</v>

2209
01:36:44.751 --> 01:36:47.690
<v Speaker 5>It's cause it's just drawing is your</v>
<v Speaker 5>expression.</v>

2210
01:36:47.691 --> 01:36:50.030
<v Speaker 5>Whatever you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you want to draw like a real</v>

2211
01:36:50.031 --> 01:36:51.980
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so then we started,</v>

2212
01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:54.440
<v Speaker 5>I started showing her like a real human</v>
<v Speaker 5>body.</v>

2213
01:36:54.441 --> 01:36:54.861
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2214
01:36:54.861 --> 01:36:56.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to stand up and I'll stand up</v>
<v Speaker 5>next to the wall.</v>

2215
01:36:56.871 --> 01:36:59.840
<v Speaker 5>And what we're gonna do is we're going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to mark on the wall where the top of my</v>

2216
01:36:59.841 --> 01:37:02.830
<v Speaker 5>head is and where my waist is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Awesome.</v>

2217
01:37:03.670 --> 01:37:07.220
<v Speaker 5>And so we went from the top of my head</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the waist and then we went from the</v>

2218
01:37:07.221 --> 01:37:10.310
<v Speaker 5>waist down to the feet and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you notice that like they're pretty</v>

2219
01:37:10.311 --> 01:37:14.750
<v Speaker 5>much the same or at least close,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the women in these cartoon things</v>

2220
01:37:14.751 --> 01:37:16.910
<v Speaker 5>you're supposed to draw were no</v>
<v Speaker 5>bullshit.</v>

2221
01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:20.780
<v Speaker 5>There was twice as much length in their</v>
<v Speaker 5>legs as there was from your waist up to</v>

2222
01:37:20.781 --> 01:37:22.160
<v Speaker 5>their head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she was like,</v>

2223
01:37:22.161 --> 01:37:23.570
<v Speaker 5>well why do they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I go,</v>

2224
01:37:23.571 --> 01:37:28.160
<v Speaker 5>well thank some people think that it</v>
<v Speaker 5>looks better to make people that aren't</v>

2225
01:37:28.161 --> 01:37:30.890
<v Speaker 5>real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that are like longer than reality,</v>

2226
01:37:30.891 --> 01:37:34.760
<v Speaker 5>but like why do we accept that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because like if there was a woman and</v>

2227
01:37:34.761 --> 01:37:37.910
<v Speaker 5>that she had like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a normal proportion body but</v>

2228
01:37:37.911 --> 01:37:41.030
<v Speaker 5>enormous tits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just freakish tits.</v>

2229
01:37:41.210 --> 01:37:42.620
<v Speaker 5>Like everybody would look at that and</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

2230
01:37:42.621 --> 01:37:44.300
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck are you making these kids</v>
<v Speaker 5>draw,</v>

2231
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:46.160
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But for,</v>

2232
01:37:46.190 --> 01:37:48.080
<v Speaker 5>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like having the,</v>

2233
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:51.560
<v Speaker 5>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people have freakish tits.</v>

2234
01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:53.970
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's people that for whatever reason</v>

2235
01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 5>there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that poor dude who can't go</v>

2236
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:58.920
<v Speaker 3>to the airport without getting frisked</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause he has this giant Hog,</v>

2237
01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:00.900
<v Speaker 3>has like some 20 inch Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2238
01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:02.400
<v Speaker 3>he's got the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got the world's largest deck.</v>

2239
01:38:02.670 --> 01:38:05.070
<v Speaker 3>And like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they always check his pants to think</v>

2240
01:38:05.071 --> 01:38:08.160
<v Speaker 3>he's carrying drugs or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's women out there that are</v>

2241
01:38:08.161 --> 01:38:10.830
<v Speaker 3>just naturally born with enormous</v>
<v Speaker 3>breasts and there's nothing they could</v>

2242
01:38:10.831 --> 01:38:13.860
<v Speaker 3>do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no one born with knowing that</v>

2243
01:38:13.890 --> 01:38:18.330
<v Speaker 3>there's no one six feet tall and only</v>
<v Speaker 3>two feet of them are upper body and the</v>

2244
01:38:18.331 --> 01:38:19.200
<v Speaker 3>rest of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his legs,</v>

2245
01:38:19.201 --> 01:38:21.360
<v Speaker 3>that's just doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2246
01:38:21.361 --> 01:38:22.500
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

2247
01:38:22.501 --> 01:38:26.550
<v Speaker 3>And even when I was at art school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would have a different formula for</v>

2248
01:38:26.551 --> 01:38:31.030
<v Speaker 3>drying figures and there was like they</v>
<v Speaker 3>would measure it and head.</v>

2249
01:38:31.031 --> 01:38:35.290
<v Speaker 3>So it's like this figure is nine heads</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a fashion figure.</v>

2250
01:38:35.291 --> 01:38:37.350
<v Speaker 3>W W which what they called it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

2251
01:38:37.351 --> 01:38:39.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that take her for a fashion illustration</v>

2252
01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:41.940
<v Speaker 3>was like so many more heads than like</v>
<v Speaker 3>any other figure.</v>

2253
01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:44.760
<v Speaker 3>And so it was like that crazy along the</v>
<v Speaker 3>unaided thing and exactly what you're</v>

2254
01:38:44.761 --> 01:38:46.740
<v Speaker 3>saying with like the crazy daddy long</v>
<v Speaker 3>legs,</v>

2255
01:38:46.741 --> 01:38:49.620
<v Speaker 3>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange because for men we,</v>

2256
01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:53.970
<v Speaker 3>I've never talked to a man who</v>
<v Speaker 3>understands that look because men are</v>

2257
01:38:53.971 --> 01:38:56.640
<v Speaker 3>not attracted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm sure everybody varies,</v>

2258
01:38:56.641 --> 01:38:59.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But most men are not attractive to these</v>

2259
01:39:00.030 --> 01:39:03.590
<v Speaker 3>stick figure people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But women are expected to be stick</v>

2260
01:39:03.591 --> 01:39:07.170
<v Speaker 3>figure people to be models.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the weirdest things.</v>

2261
01:39:07.290 --> 01:39:10.050
<v Speaker 3>And then women think that in order to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>attractive,</v>

2262
01:39:10.230 --> 01:39:13.410
<v Speaker 3>they have to be like these media</v>
<v Speaker 3>representations of women.</v>

2263
01:39:13.411 --> 01:39:15.720
<v Speaker 3>So they have to starve themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then men are like,</v>

2264
01:39:15.721 --> 01:39:16.610
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do that.</v>

2265
01:39:16.770 --> 01:39:17.970
<v Speaker 3>No one likes that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2266
01:39:17.971 --> 01:39:22.410
<v Speaker 3>so like there's this weird disconnect</v>
<v Speaker 3>between what the opposite sex or,</v>

2267
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:23.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2268
01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:26.790
<v Speaker 3>I can't speak for lesbians obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with the opposite sex finds</v>

2269
01:39:26.791 --> 01:39:31.791
<v Speaker 3>attractive and the representations of</v>
<v Speaker 3>attractive women like sucked in cheeks,</v>

2270
01:39:33.110 --> 01:39:35.880
<v Speaker 3>ba basically like on death's door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2271
01:39:35.881 --> 01:39:37.080
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's hot.</v>

2272
01:39:37.290 --> 01:39:38.041
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2273
01:39:38.041 --> 01:39:39.000
<v Speaker 3>that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2274
01:39:39.150 --> 01:39:44.150
<v Speaker 3>it's weird to see someone all cracked</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and skinny like that being the most</v>

2275
01:39:45.050 --> 01:39:47.720
<v Speaker 3>with the most obvious representation of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

2276
01:39:47.721 --> 01:39:50.490
<v Speaker 3>a beautiful person in Nice clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2277
01:39:50.491 --> 01:39:51.810
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2278
01:39:51.811 --> 01:39:54.210
<v Speaker 3>fashion models aren't for men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2279
01:39:54.211 --> 01:39:55.590
<v Speaker 3>or they're not first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not for straight men.</v>

2280
01:39:55.591 --> 01:39:58.200
<v Speaker 3>They're supposed to appeal to women who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are buying the clothing.</v>

2281
01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:00.630
<v Speaker 3>But do they even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2282
01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:02.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2283
01:40:02.410 --> 01:40:03.243
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fashion,</v>

2284
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.900
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2285
01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:05.250
<v Speaker 3>women of all sizes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>skinny,</v>

2286
01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:05.821
<v Speaker 3>skinny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2287
01:40:05.821 --> 01:40:09.660
<v Speaker 3>I think I'll be super beautiful as long</v>
<v Speaker 3>as that's really you.</v>

2288
01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:11.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as you're not harming yourself</v>

2289
01:40:11.461 --> 01:40:12.690
<v Speaker 3>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2290
01:40:12.691 --> 01:40:14.220
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

2291
01:40:15.210 --> 01:40:18.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the idea is that you can just</v>

2292
01:40:18.961 --> 01:40:21.900
<v Speaker 3>hang any clothing on them and it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>affect the hang of the clothing.</v>

2293
01:40:21.901 --> 01:40:24.090
<v Speaker 3>So it's like almost like they're as</v>
<v Speaker 3>close to it being</v>

2294
01:40:25.770 --> 01:40:28.350
<v Speaker 3>like a coat hanger as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the theoretical</v>

2295
01:40:28.351 --> 01:40:30.420
<v Speaker 3>underpinnings of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2296
01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:31.231
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>

2297
01:40:31.231 --> 01:40:34.410
<v Speaker 3>Like if you look at like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a playboy model or like a model for</v>

2298
01:40:34.411 --> 01:40:36.420
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2299
01:40:36.421 --> 01:40:39.570
<v Speaker 3>like black men's magazine or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a model for Max.</v>

2300
01:40:39.571 --> 01:40:41.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like the super fit young women,</v>

2301
01:40:41.491 --> 01:40:44.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who like have like really good like</v>

2302
01:40:44.611 --> 01:40:46.650
<v Speaker 3>muscles and a really curvy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2303
01:40:46.651 --> 01:40:50.070
<v Speaker 3>well people like men are naturally</v>
<v Speaker 3>attracted to women with a certain amount</v>

2304
01:40:50.071 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 3>of body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a natural thing to be</v>

2305
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:57.400
<v Speaker 5>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the whole idea of breasts and butts</v>

2306
01:40:57.401 --> 01:41:02.140
<v Speaker 5>and hips being attractive is because</v>
<v Speaker 5>genetically women who have those things</v>

2307
01:41:02.141 --> 01:41:06.280
<v Speaker 5>will carry children better and we'll be</v>
<v Speaker 5>more likely to be able to nourish those</v>

2308
01:41:06.281 --> 01:41:09.400
<v Speaker 5>children because they're healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the total genetic thing.</v>

2309
01:41:09.401 --> 01:41:12.640
<v Speaker 5>So much so this is the weirdest aspect</v>
<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>

2310
01:41:12.641 --> 01:41:16.630
<v Speaker 5>So much so that if a woman has fake</v>
<v Speaker 5>boobs,</v>

2311
01:41:16.930 --> 01:41:18.370
<v Speaker 5>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're fake,</v>

2312
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:20.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no disconnect at all.</v>

2313
01:41:20.561 --> 01:41:25.450
<v Speaker 5>You're absolutely aware that she has</v>
<v Speaker 5>gone through surgery to cut her skin</v>

2314
01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:28.840
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bags of water in the air that make them</v>

2315
01:41:28.841 --> 01:41:29.680
<v Speaker 5>stick out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

2316
01:41:29.710 --> 01:41:31.450
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they stick out more.</v>

2317
01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:36.660
<v Speaker 5>Like men will be more attracted sexually</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the sexual attraction is supposed to</v>

2318
01:41:37.211 --> 01:41:41.560
<v Speaker 5>at least represent wanting to breed with</v>
<v Speaker 5>that person like you.</v>

2319
01:41:41.561 --> 01:41:45.670
<v Speaker 5>You are not just trekked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're tricking yourself like it's the</v>

2320
01:41:45.970 --> 01:41:50.050
<v Speaker 5>Wa like fake boobs are one of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>weirdest things of all time.</v>

2321
01:41:50.290 --> 01:41:51.820
<v Speaker 5>If you really stop and look at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we were,</v>

2322
01:41:52.030 --> 01:41:55.450
<v Speaker 5>if aliens came down from another planet</v>
<v Speaker 5>or even historians,</v>

2323
01:41:55.870 --> 01:41:58.960
<v Speaker 5>because I guarantee you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we were talking about like Bradley</v>

2324
01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:02.740
<v Speaker 5>Manning and Chelsea Manning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's gonna come a time in whatever,</v>

2325
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:05.170
<v Speaker 5>not so distant future the next hundred</v>
<v Speaker 5>years,</v>

2326
01:42:05.370 --> 01:42:07.330
<v Speaker 5>but they're just going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 5>turn you into a woman.</v>

2327
01:42:07.630 --> 01:42:08.950
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to say like,</v>

2328
01:42:08.951 --> 01:42:10.810
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be a woman anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to be a man.</v>

2329
01:42:10.990 --> 01:42:13.300
<v Speaker 5>They'll make you a man for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean like,</v>

2330
01:42:13.301 --> 01:42:14.860
<v Speaker 5>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like being molly better.</v>

2331
01:42:14.890 --> 01:42:16.570
<v Speaker 5>You go back to me and molly instead of</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mike,</v>

2332
01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:17.650
<v Speaker 5>Molly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Mike the show,</v>

2333
01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:18.990
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you,</v>

2334
01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.160
<v Speaker 5>I think they going to be able to do that</v>
<v Speaker 5>with press.</v>

2335
01:42:21.161 --> 01:42:22.360
<v Speaker 5>They're going to be able to do that with</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

2336
01:42:22.361 --> 01:42:24.760
<v Speaker 5>They're going to be able to manipulate</v>
<v Speaker 5>genetics to the point where,</v>

2337
01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:27.160
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you ever seen or listened to this or</v>

2338
01:42:27.161 --> 01:42:29.410
<v Speaker 5>radio lab,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a episode on Crispr,</v>

2339
01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:33.880
<v Speaker 5>I hadn't know it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that crispr is an a new method of</v>

2340
01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:38.830
<v Speaker 5>manipulating genetics that they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they have invented.</v>

2341
01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:41.170
<v Speaker 5>It's a really super complicated thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I'm going to butcher,</v>

2342
01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:46.470
<v Speaker 5>but they've invented it by studying the</v>
<v Speaker 5>DNA of viruses and they figured out how</v>

2343
01:42:46.901 --> 01:42:51.790
<v Speaker 5>to utilize that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that sort of method to manipulate</v>

2344
01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:55.750
<v Speaker 5>eventually at least human dna and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>point where they're going to be able to</v>

2345
01:42:55.751 --> 01:42:57.700
<v Speaker 5>change your traits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They got to make a change.</v>

2346
01:42:57.730 --> 01:42:59.410
<v Speaker 5>They're going to be able to change so</v>
<v Speaker 5>many different things,</v>

2347
01:42:59.411 --> 01:43:04.411
<v Speaker 5>introduce genes into specific areas of</v>
<v Speaker 5>your body and fix problems or change</v>

2348
01:43:04.901 --> 01:43:07.720
<v Speaker 5>things that you don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are they going to go do some fucking</v>

2349
01:43:07.721 --> 01:43:10.780
<v Speaker 5>freaky shit?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is just one invention that is,</v>

2350
01:43:10.810 --> 01:43:15.810
<v Speaker 5>I think 2012 it was invented and by the</v>
<v Speaker 5>time 2032 rolls around,</v>

2351
01:43:16.810 --> 01:43:18.850
<v Speaker 5>who the fuck knows what they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>have?</v>

2352
01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:22.720
<v Speaker 5>I think we're really close to be able</v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

2353
01:43:22.770 --> 01:43:24.700
<v Speaker 5>to just completely manipulate human</v>
<v Speaker 5>bodies.</v>

2354
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:28.600
<v Speaker 5>But the point being when historians go</v>
<v Speaker 5>back and they look at fake boobs,</v>

2355
01:43:28.601 --> 01:43:31.450
<v Speaker 5>they're going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck were these people doing?</v>

2356
01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:34.780
<v Speaker 5>Like how weird is this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's going to be a smithsonian that</v>

2357
01:43:34.781 --> 01:43:39.370
<v Speaker 5>has like boxes of like silicone and this</v>
<v Speaker 5>is the early days and this was when they</v>

2358
01:43:39.371 --> 01:43:42.430
<v Speaker 5>went to céline and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to look at that stuff going,</v>

2359
01:43:42.431 --> 01:43:45.730
<v Speaker 5>what a strange time to be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the thing is though,</v>

2360
01:43:45.731 --> 01:43:48.100
<v Speaker 5>like with chicory and like matters of</v>
<v Speaker 5>aesthetics,</v>

2361
01:43:48.110 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even want to call it trickery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's all sorts of like you can</v>

2362
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:55.430
<v Speaker 3>like totally like admire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like think a guy like looks really hot</v>

2363
01:43:55.431 --> 01:43:57.590
<v Speaker 3>and a sharp suit even though you know</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not really his scan.</v>

2364
01:43:57.591 --> 01:43:58.730
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2365
01:43:58.860 --> 01:43:59.990
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2366
01:44:00.010 --> 01:44:02.990
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole like sort of visual</v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciation of other people that</v>

2367
01:44:02.991 --> 01:44:05.540
<v Speaker 3>doesn't necessarily just have to do with</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what's the,</v>

2368
01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:07.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the quote unquote real or like what's</v>

2369
01:44:07.611 --> 01:44:09.830
<v Speaker 3>your genetic heritage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really true.</v>

2370
01:44:09.831 --> 01:44:11.360
<v Speaker 3>A closer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a great exam.</v>

2371
01:44:11.361 --> 01:44:14.090
<v Speaker 3>That's a really good example because</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is weird.</v>

2372
01:44:14.330 --> 01:44:16.190
<v Speaker 3>Like you see someone who's dressed sharp</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you go,</v>

2373
01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:18.320
<v Speaker 3>Ooh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he looks great in that suit.</v>

2374
01:44:18.321 --> 01:44:21.050
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a beautiful vest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like wow,</v>

2375
01:44:21.051 --> 01:44:23.360
<v Speaker 3>that looks awesome on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a strange thing.</v>

2376
01:44:23.361 --> 01:44:26.030
<v Speaker 3>Like you look good with stuff on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2377
01:44:26.031 --> 01:44:27.650
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could hang stuff on you that makes</v>

2378
01:44:27.651 --> 01:44:31.580
<v Speaker 3>you look good or professional or</v>
<v Speaker 3>authoritive or all of these other</v>

2379
01:44:31.581 --> 01:44:33.110
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though like they're just like stuff</v>

2380
01:44:33.111 --> 01:44:35.480
<v Speaker 3>that you're wearing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that's a truth.</v>

2381
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:38.690
<v Speaker 3>The same with hermit crabs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my.</v>

2382
01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:41.510
<v Speaker 3>Out a good shell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine like someone's like,</v>

2383
01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:43.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm wearing like the really slick cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shall look,</v>

2384
01:44:43.581 --> 01:44:45.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get all the girl hermit</v>
<v Speaker 3>crabs right now.</v>

2385
01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:46.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably right.</v>

2386
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:50.790
<v Speaker 3>There's some weird things in nature with</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals doing things like,</v>

2387
01:44:50.791 --> 01:44:52.220
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about animals that can actually</v>

2388
01:44:52.221 --> 01:44:54.590
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever paid attention to octopus</v>

2389
01:44:54.591 --> 01:44:55.850
<v Speaker 3>at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2390
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.860
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2391
01:44:58.010 --> 01:45:00.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty shamefully ignorant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might have to educate me here.</v>

2392
01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:02.330
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well apparently cuddle</v>

2393
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:06.700
<v Speaker 5>fish are just as bizarre if not more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But my friend Remy Warren is a,</v>

2394
01:45:06.701 --> 01:45:09.610
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a host of a show called the Apex</v>

2395
01:45:09.611 --> 01:45:11.570
<v Speaker 5>Predator where they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2396
01:45:11.670 --> 01:45:13.480
<v Speaker 5>they monitor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they will,</v>

2397
01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:14.560
<v Speaker 5>they sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2398
01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:21.240
<v Speaker 5>try to emulate the different attributes</v>
<v Speaker 5>that certain predators have and how they</v>

2399
01:45:23.261 --> 01:45:25.780
<v Speaker 5>survive and see like if there's like</v>
<v Speaker 5>some,</v>

2400
01:45:25.810 --> 01:45:27.820
<v Speaker 5>a human version of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2401
01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:28.920
<v Speaker 5>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2402
01:45:28.930 --> 01:45:31.660
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they like check out like how,</v>

2403
01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:33.760
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2404
01:45:33.761 --> 01:45:35.590
<v Speaker 5>birds Harun herons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>herons.</v>

2405
01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:38.200
<v Speaker 5>How do you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Heron heron herons.</v>

2406
01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:41.530
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like how they walk with their crazy long</v>

2407
01:45:41.531 --> 01:45:45.400
<v Speaker 5>legs and then stab at the water looking</v>
<v Speaker 5>for like frogs and shit.</v>

2408
01:45:45.670 --> 01:45:49.480
<v Speaker 5>And he did one on octopus's and at of</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the different animals we were</v>

2409
01:45:49.481 --> 01:45:50.500
<v Speaker 5>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was like,</v>

2410
01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:51.850
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's all these cool animals.</v>

2411
01:45:51.851 --> 01:45:55.030
<v Speaker 5>They were talking about like how wolves</v>
<v Speaker 5>will chase down packs of elk and how</v>

2412
01:45:55.031 --> 01:45:58.720
<v Speaker 5>they cornered them and in these canyons</v>
<v Speaker 5>and draws and how they figured out how</v>

2413
01:45:58.721 --> 01:45:59.430
<v Speaker 5>to trap them.</v>

2414
01:45:59.430 --> 01:46:01.960
<v Speaker 5>It's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when he started talking about</v>

2415
01:46:01.961 --> 01:46:02.860
<v Speaker 5>octopus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

2416
01:46:02.861 --> 01:46:05.350
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have never see our fucking aliens.</v>

2417
01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:06.870
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at these things like what color</v>

2418
01:46:06.871 --> 01:46:09.640
<v Speaker 5>they can change their colors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this is real.</v>

2419
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:13.840
<v Speaker 5>They can change their colors and</v>
<v Speaker 5>immediately adapt to their environment</v>

2420
01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:17.140
<v Speaker 5>to the point where they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>indistinguishable from the background.</v>

2421
01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:19.660
<v Speaker 5>This is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2422
01:46:19.661 --> 01:46:21.730
<v Speaker 5>they're insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're insane.</v>

2423
01:46:22.210 --> 01:46:23.200
<v Speaker 5>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can,</v>

2424
01:46:23.230 --> 01:46:28.230
<v Speaker 5>they can instantaneously like within</v>
<v Speaker 5>fractions of a second change the outside</v>

2425
01:46:28.541 --> 01:46:31.300
<v Speaker 5>of their body to look exactly like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>coral reef,</v>

2426
01:46:31.450 --> 01:46:34.720
<v Speaker 5>not just in the image but in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>texture.</v>

2427
01:46:35.650 --> 01:46:38.830
<v Speaker 5>They do all kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can change themselves to look more</v>

2428
01:46:38.831 --> 01:46:42.420
<v Speaker 5>like predators or like dangerous things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2429
01:46:42.490 --> 01:46:46.030
<v Speaker 5>it's incredible what they can do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You live from the coolest world.</v>

2430
01:46:46.031 --> 01:46:47.300
<v Speaker 5>My God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2431
01:46:47.301 --> 01:46:49.030
<v Speaker 5>the world's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The world.</v>

2432
01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:50.970
<v Speaker 5>The ocean still like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2433
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.310
<v Speaker 5>there's some new project that they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing right now.</v>

2434
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:56.010
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or they're trying to map the ocean floor</v>

2435
01:46:56.580 --> 01:47:01.580
<v Speaker 5>and there without a doubt they're going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to discover some freaky fucking fish</v>

2436
01:47:01.741 --> 01:47:05.910
<v Speaker 5>life marine life down there that we've</v>
<v Speaker 5>never encountered before.</v>

2437
01:47:06.090 --> 01:47:10.620
<v Speaker 5>But just these creatures were just</v>
<v Speaker 5>starting to learn what these things are</v>

2438
01:47:10.621 --> 01:47:11.640
<v Speaker 5>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2439
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:15.810
<v Speaker 5>look at that like a flower or something</v>
<v Speaker 5>on fast motion.</v>

2440
01:47:16.290 --> 01:47:18.640
<v Speaker 5>That's an octopus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not to be</v>

2441
01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:24.600
<v Speaker 5>a Wiki or something looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but watch this,</v>

2442
01:47:24.601 --> 01:47:25.080
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2443
01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:27.690
<v Speaker 5>it can merge with these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2444
01:47:27.710 --> 01:47:30.330
<v Speaker 5>coral reefs and it looks like a coral</v>
<v Speaker 5>reef.</v>

2445
01:47:30.331 --> 01:47:34.860
<v Speaker 5>So it's literally developed this ability</v>
<v Speaker 5>to turn his body into the shape of a</v>

2446
01:47:34.861 --> 01:47:37.080
<v Speaker 5>reef.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then it's little tiny.</v>

2447
01:47:37.081 --> 01:47:38.610
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it curls,</v>

2448
01:47:38.611 --> 01:47:42.600
<v Speaker 5>it's tentacles up into little tiny legs</v>
<v Speaker 5>and runs on two legs.</v>

2449
01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:45.120
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're amazing.</v>

2450
01:47:45.210 --> 01:47:45.781
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And look,</v>

2451
01:47:45.781 --> 01:47:49.230
<v Speaker 5>it's like a teardrop shape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so cool.</v>

2452
01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:52.380
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's just octopuses is just cause</v>

2453
01:47:52.381 --> 01:47:54.780
<v Speaker 5>they're fun to draw with all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>tentacles and stuff.</v>

2454
01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:55.830
<v Speaker 5>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

2455
01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:56.850
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had no idea.</v>

2456
01:47:57.270 --> 01:48:00.660
<v Speaker 5>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the fact that they can do it like</v>

2457
01:48:00.661 --> 01:48:05.661
<v Speaker 5>that they just change like fucking what</v>
<v Speaker 5>a weird world and the communicate with</v>

2458
01:48:06.031 --> 01:48:08.640
<v Speaker 5>each other somehow through that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we don't know how we know they're</v>

2459
01:48:08.641 --> 01:48:11.670
<v Speaker 5>really fucking smart though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are they going to take it all over after</v>

2460
01:48:11.671 --> 01:48:14.010
<v Speaker 5>we destroy everything?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The OCTOPI are going to rule the earth.</v>

2461
01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:15.510
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's something I've been like really</v>

2462
01:48:15.511 --> 01:48:20.160
<v Speaker 5>dwelling on lately when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 5>marine life and dolphins and orcas and</v>

2463
01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:24.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm a huge believer that they are just</v>
<v Speaker 5>as intelligent as us,</v>

2464
01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:27.770
<v Speaker 5>if not more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that what we're doing with seaworld</v>

2465
01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:32.780
<v Speaker 5>and all these wild dolphin shows is</v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing less than slavery.</v>

2466
01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:37.560
<v Speaker 5>It's slavery of some alien intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we can't communicate with.</v>

2467
01:48:37.561 --> 01:48:39.460
<v Speaker 5>We don't understand what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So really,</v>

2468
01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:40.770
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can hear you.</v>

2469
01:48:40.771 --> 01:48:41.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what you're saying.</v>

2470
01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:45.030
<v Speaker 5>So fucking jumped for fish or starve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's your choice.</v>

2471
01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:46.650
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

2472
01:48:46.651 --> 01:48:50.130
<v Speaker 5>I've thought about it but like our ideas</v>
<v Speaker 5>about what is intelligent,</v>

2473
01:48:50.370 --> 01:48:53.220
<v Speaker 5>like we don't think that something's</v>
<v Speaker 5>intelligent and less,</v>

2474
01:48:53.221 --> 01:48:56.220
<v Speaker 5>it does exactly what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When we,</v>

2475
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:57.840
<v Speaker 5>when we think of intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we say,</v>

2476
01:48:57.870 --> 01:48:58.710
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well molly,</v>

2477
01:48:58.711 --> 01:49:01.050
<v Speaker 5>send me an email.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I sent her an email back.</v>

2478
01:49:01.051 --> 01:49:03.270
<v Speaker 5>I know she's intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's communicating through an email.</v>

2479
01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:05.430
<v Speaker 5>The Dolphin is not a fucking make an</v>
<v Speaker 5>email.</v>

2480
01:49:05.431 --> 01:49:06.480
<v Speaker 5>He's an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2481
01:49:06.481 --> 01:49:08.100
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they don't need email.</v>

2482
01:49:08.250 --> 01:49:10.410
<v Speaker 5>Like why do we need email?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need email cause we need to</v>

2483
01:49:10.411 --> 01:49:12.540
<v Speaker 5>communicate well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can communicate from miles through</v>

2484
01:49:12.541 --> 01:49:14.670
<v Speaker 5>the water with their chirps and their</v>
<v Speaker 5>noises.</v>

2485
01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:17.670
<v Speaker 5>They recognize each other from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2486
01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:20.490
<v Speaker 5>years and years being apart from each</v>
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

2487
01:49:20.491 --> 01:49:22.500
<v Speaker 5>Even though to us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they all look the fucking same.</v>

2488
01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:26.490
<v Speaker 5>They can move and manipulate through</v>
<v Speaker 5>three d space in the water.</v>

2489
01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:29.820
<v Speaker 5>They don't need a house because they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>smart enough to go with a water's warm</v>

2490
01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:32.880
<v Speaker 5>fishes everywhere and it's free so they</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't need jobs.</v>

2491
01:49:33.090 --> 01:49:37.110
<v Speaker 5>So all these ideas that we have is like</v>
<v Speaker 5>what represents intelligence,</v>

2492
01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:39.690
<v Speaker 5>all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stupid cause to them.</v>

2493
01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:41.760
<v Speaker 5>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I'm going to build a house and</v>

2494
01:49:41.761 --> 01:49:43.170
<v Speaker 5>drive my car to work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

2495
01:49:43.171 --> 01:49:44.880
<v Speaker 5>what are you talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bitch or under the water?</v>

2496
01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 5>Like if you do like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need a hoard it all the fish and my</v>

2497
01:49:48.071 --> 01:49:51.360
<v Speaker 5>thing and like kill them and then I'll</v>
<v Speaker 5>sell you the fucking fish for calc.</v>

2498
01:49:51.361 --> 01:49:52.770
<v Speaker 5>That's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'd be like,</v>

2499
01:49:52.771 --> 01:49:54.670
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like your high dolphin.</v>

2500
01:49:54.730 --> 01:49:57.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to write you a letter from my</v>
<v Speaker 5>laptop was,</v>

2501
01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:58.450
<v Speaker 5>there's no internet down here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stupid.</v>

2502
01:49:58.700 --> 01:50:01.180
<v Speaker 5>There's no like you're a crap dolphin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2503
01:50:01.181 --> 01:50:01.720
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

2504
01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:04.180
<v Speaker 5>you're fucking laptops,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not gonna work on their water asshole.</v>

2505
01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:09.790
<v Speaker 5>So all of our ideas about what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's intelligent is only based on our</v>

2506
01:50:09.791 --> 01:50:14.200
<v Speaker 5>ability to manipulate or environment or</v>
<v Speaker 5>create things that didn't exist.</v>

2507
01:50:14.350 --> 01:50:17.260
<v Speaker 5>So our intelligence is a very bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 5>intelligence because it's,</v>

2508
01:50:17.261 --> 01:50:22.261
<v Speaker 5>we the only intelligence that can not</v>
<v Speaker 5>just manipulate our or environment</v>

2509
01:50:22.781 --> 01:50:25.360
<v Speaker 5>that's local.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But our environment globally,</v>

2510
01:50:25.361 --> 01:50:28.030
<v Speaker 5>like we can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can essentially change the weather.</v>

2511
01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:32.170
<v Speaker 5>We can spray,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can cloud seed and make it rain and</v>

2512
01:50:32.171 --> 01:50:33.610
<v Speaker 5>put like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's one of the weird things they do</v>

2513
01:50:33.611 --> 01:50:36.460
<v Speaker 5>in Abu Dhabi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They make it rain every week.</v>

2514
01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:40.930
<v Speaker 5>They do it on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They spray the sky with some sort of</v>

2515
01:50:40.931 --> 01:50:44.140
<v Speaker 5>silver something or another that makes</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2516
01:50:44.141 --> 01:50:46.270
<v Speaker 5>I don't forget what the exact compound</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

2517
01:50:46.271 --> 01:50:50.350
<v Speaker 5>but it actually causes it to rain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they've been doing it like once a</v>

2518
01:50:50.351 --> 01:50:53.180
<v Speaker 5>week for years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have rainstorms that they</v>

2519
01:50:53.181 --> 01:50:56.320
<v Speaker 5>manufacturer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're freaks,</v>

2520
01:50:56.430 --> 01:50:58.570
<v Speaker 5>we're freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And our intelligence is fundamentally</v>

2521
01:50:58.571 --> 01:51:01.150
<v Speaker 5>built on dissatisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I mean we have to have,</v>

2522
01:51:01.151 --> 01:51:04.690
<v Speaker 5>cause we're also like weak and not apex</v>
<v Speaker 5>predators necessarily.</v>

2523
01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:07.780
<v Speaker 5>And we're getting weaker I think too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's part of it.</v>

2524
01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:10.690
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you went back to the early humans and</v>

2525
01:51:10.691 --> 01:51:14.290
<v Speaker 5>you compare it like our tendons and bone</v>
<v Speaker 5>structure and are they,</v>

2526
01:51:14.291 --> 01:51:15.760
<v Speaker 5>are they really humans?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are they,</v>

2527
01:51:15.850 --> 01:51:17.710
<v Speaker 5>are they stronger than us?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was that they were like shorter and</v>

2528
01:51:17.711 --> 01:51:18.220
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

2529
01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:21.760
<v Speaker 5>her dolls were so not really humans</v>
<v Speaker 5>right there,</v>

2530
01:51:21.761 --> 01:51:24.640
<v Speaker 5>like a type of human and the how they</v>
<v Speaker 5>categorize them,</v>

2531
01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:27.910
<v Speaker 5>they were way stronger than I was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they weren't just stronger than us.</v>

2532
01:51:27.911 --> 01:51:32.170
<v Speaker 5>They were like really short.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There were like five foot five foot two</v>

2533
01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:35.920
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like 220 pounds just fucking gorilla</v>

2534
01:51:35.921 --> 01:51:40.090
<v Speaker 5>like with super thick bones and fic</v>
<v Speaker 5>heads.</v>

2535
01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:44.740
<v Speaker 5>And then they don't really know exactly</v>
<v Speaker 5>how intelligent they were either.</v>

2536
01:51:44.741 --> 01:51:46.540
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all this speculation as to whether or</v>

2537
01:51:46.541 --> 01:51:50.310
<v Speaker 5>not they figured out tools on their own</v>
<v Speaker 5>or whether they copied them from Homo</v>

2538
01:51:50.311 --> 01:51:55.311
<v Speaker 5>sapiens and where homosapiens came from</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they interbreed and there's debate</v>

2539
01:51:55.811 --> 01:51:56.820
<v Speaker 5>on that as well.</v>

2540
01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:59.410
<v Speaker 5>And it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they're always fun on these,</v>

2541
01:51:59.411 --> 01:52:01.240
<v Speaker 5>fucking knew their violin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Another one,</v>

2542
01:52:01.241 --> 01:52:05.110
<v Speaker 5>like within the last couple of weeks</v>
<v Speaker 5>they found another new species of human.</v>

2543
01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:09.250
<v Speaker 5>We didn't know existed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They found some large tooth that,</v>

2544
01:52:09.251 --> 01:52:12.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>turned out to be not category,</v>

2545
01:52:12.071 --> 01:52:15.670
<v Speaker 5>it was a human tooth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not categorized in any previous</v>

2546
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.610
<v Speaker 5>version of human beings that they were</v>
<v Speaker 5>aware of before.</v>

2547
01:52:18.930 --> 01:52:20.620
<v Speaker 5>Or if they found quite a few of them</v>
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>

2548
01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:22.700
<v Speaker 5>including the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure you've heard of like that.</v>

2549
01:52:22.810 --> 01:52:24.970
<v Speaker 5>The hobbit people they found the island</v>
<v Speaker 5>of Flores,</v>

2550
01:52:25.690 --> 01:52:28.300
<v Speaker 5>that was 14,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not that long ago.</v>

2551
01:52:28.301 --> 01:52:31.180
<v Speaker 5>No luck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not before the beginning of</v>

2552
01:52:31.181 --> 01:52:33.190
<v Speaker 5>recorded history as it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's quill.</v>

2553
01:52:33.250 --> 01:52:37.060
<v Speaker 5>I always a little bit before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a little bit depends on whose version of</v>

2554
01:52:37.061 --> 01:52:40.420
<v Speaker 5>the beginning of recorded history is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a bought a bunch of people that</v>

2555
01:52:40.421 --> 01:52:41.630
<v Speaker 5>believe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2556
01:52:41.890 --> 01:52:44.200
<v Speaker 5>there's this guy that I've had on my</v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast a few times now.</v>

2557
01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:46.370
<v Speaker 5>His name's Randall Carlson and he's an</v>
<v Speaker 5>expert in,</v>

2558
01:52:46.780 --> 01:52:49.250
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cataclysmic events and,</v>

2559
01:52:49.251 --> 01:52:52.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially a asteroidal impacts.</v>

2560
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:53.060
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2561
01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:57.350
<v Speaker 5>him and this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Graham Hancock have worked together and</v>

2562
01:52:57.351 --> 01:52:59.780
<v Speaker 5>Graham Hancock wrote this book called</v>
<v Speaker 5>fingerprints of the Gods.</v>

2563
01:52:59.781 --> 01:53:01.790
<v Speaker 5>It was a really controversial book in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the 90s.</v>

2564
01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:04.910
<v Speaker 5>And then now he has a new one called</v>
<v Speaker 5>magicians of the gods,</v>

2565
01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:09.911
<v Speaker 5>which is sort of shows how much of his</v>
<v Speaker 5>early work that was widely criticized</v>

2566
01:53:10.401 --> 01:53:15.020
<v Speaker 5>was actually substantiated now by</v>
<v Speaker 5>science where these ancient structures</v>

2567
01:53:15.021 --> 01:53:16.970
<v Speaker 5>that didn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they were trying to figure out like</v>

2568
01:53:16.971 --> 01:53:20.690
<v Speaker 5>who fucking built these and how the WHO</v>
<v Speaker 5>or how they here and archeologists sort</v>

2569
01:53:20.691 --> 01:53:25.370
<v Speaker 5>of try to put like vague dates on them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the idea behind it was that</v>

2570
01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:28.840
<v Speaker 5>civilization has not evolved and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>not progressed on a,</v>

2571
01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:31.910
<v Speaker 5>a straight plane,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but rather there's been these peaks and</v>

2572
01:53:31.911 --> 01:53:34.190
<v Speaker 5>valleys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then what has happened is people</v>

2573
01:53:34.191 --> 01:53:38.870
<v Speaker 5>have gotten this very high level of</v>
<v Speaker 5>sophistication and culture and then</v>

2574
01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:42.770
<v Speaker 5>massive cataclysmic disasters have white</v>
<v Speaker 5>people out almost to the brink of</v>

2575
01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:43.993
<v Speaker 5>extinction.</v>

2576
01:53:44.090 --> 01:53:46.940
<v Speaker 5>And they've arisen back up again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like science is like,</v>

2577
01:53:46.941 --> 01:53:49.310
<v Speaker 5>found quite a few of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But one of the big ones they keep</v>

2578
01:53:49.311 --> 01:53:54.311
<v Speaker 5>pointing out is that there's somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 5>around 12,000 years ago,</v>

2579
01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:59.980
<v Speaker 5>there was a series of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>impacts on the earth and has been proven</v>

2580
01:54:00.171 --> 01:54:03.800
<v Speaker 5>by science now because over the last few</v>
<v Speaker 5>years they've discovered this stuff</v>

2581
01:54:03.801 --> 01:54:05.330
<v Speaker 5>called,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's called Triton night,</v>

2582
01:54:05.331 --> 01:54:07.160
<v Speaker 5>but it's essentially called nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 5>glass.</v>

2583
01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:09.780
<v Speaker 5>And it exists around where the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2584
01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:14.860
<v Speaker 5>do nuclear tests and it also at exists</v>
<v Speaker 5>at meteor impact sites and it's,</v>

2585
01:54:15.170 --> 01:54:17.300
<v Speaker 5>the impact creates heat that's so</v>
<v Speaker 5>intense.</v>

2586
01:54:17.301 --> 01:54:22.301
<v Speaker 5>It turns sand and rock to glass and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>find this stuff all throughout Europe</v>

2587
01:54:22.791 --> 01:54:24.650
<v Speaker 5>and all through,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's all around the same time</v>

2588
01:54:24.651 --> 01:54:28.370
<v Speaker 5>period,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which also coincides with the end of the</v>

2589
01:54:28.370 --> 01:54:32.750
<v Speaker 5>ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it also coincides with a thousand</v>

2590
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:35.390
<v Speaker 5>plus years later,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the beginning of modern civilization,</v>

2591
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:37.100
<v Speaker 5>agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mathematics.</v>

2592
01:54:37.250 --> 01:54:40.760
<v Speaker 5>And so their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their theory is that that wasn't exactly</v>

2593
01:54:40.761 --> 01:54:42.950
<v Speaker 5>the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that was a rebirth.</v>

2594
01:54:43.250 --> 01:54:47.600
<v Speaker 5>And if there was most likely thousands</v>
<v Speaker 5>of years of civilization that existed</v>

2595
01:54:47.601 --> 01:54:50.030
<v Speaker 5>before that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was almost entirely wiped out</v>

2596
01:54:50.210 --> 01:54:52.730
<v Speaker 5>when people are just bombarded with</v>
<v Speaker 5>rocks from the sky.</v>

2597
01:54:53.190 --> 01:54:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean it makes a lot of sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when societies where less</v>

2598
01:54:55.981 --> 01:54:59.130
<v Speaker 1>interconnected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the whole reason you know stuff</v>

2599
01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:03.510
<v Speaker 1>various like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>math or astrology survived the dark ages</v>

2600
01:55:03.511 --> 01:55:06.570
<v Speaker 1>in Europe was because in the Middle East</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were able to keep it alive.</v>

2601
01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:10.900
<v Speaker 1>We live in a time now where unless they</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally wiped out everyone,</v>

2602
01:55:10.980 --> 01:55:14.760
<v Speaker 1>it'd be very hard to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in a world where people don't have</v>

2603
01:55:14.761 --> 01:55:17.160
<v Speaker 1>that level of communication where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have that level of connection</v>

2604
01:55:17.161 --> 01:55:19.980
<v Speaker 1>where they don't have that level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge sharing,</v>

2605
01:55:19.981 --> 01:55:21.990
<v Speaker 1>it would be very easy for one society to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>

2606
01:55:22.290 --> 01:55:24.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to that peak and then something</v>

2607
01:55:24.151 --> 01:55:29.151
<v Speaker 1>horrifying happening to it and no other</v>
<v Speaker 1>societies could carry on that legacy.</v>

2608
01:55:29.780 --> 01:55:32.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it would be pretty easy,</v>

2609
01:55:32.090 --> 01:55:35.180
<v Speaker 5>especially today in our culture because</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything has become digital.</v>

2610
01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:40.390
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the weirdest things about us</v>
<v Speaker 5>advancing and evolving is that as things</v>

2611
01:55:40.581 --> 01:55:43.830
<v Speaker 5>move to the cloud and as things become</v>
<v Speaker 5>much,</v>

2612
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:47.040
<v Speaker 5>much less physical books like your book</v>
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>

2613
01:55:47.041 --> 01:55:49.600
<v Speaker 5>but much more like laptops and kindle</v>

2614
01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Kendall and it has 150 books on or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2615
01:55:53.641 --> 01:55:56.580
<v Speaker 1>It's that thin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just sits right in my backpack.</v>

2616
01:55:56.581 --> 01:55:58.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean the what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

2617
01:55:58.860 --> 01:56:00.360
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this magicians thing.</v>

2618
01:56:00.361 --> 01:56:04.530
<v Speaker 1>But also you could potentially like drop</v>
<v Speaker 1>a server that had the only copy of</v>

2619
01:56:04.531 --> 01:56:08.520
<v Speaker 1>something and have that only copy</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappear.</v>

2620
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2621
01:56:09.751 --> 01:56:12.930
<v Speaker 1>And if the power goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting any of this stuff.</v>

2622
01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:16.020
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was going back into an area where he</v>

2623
01:56:16.021 --> 01:56:18.150
<v Speaker 1>couldn't bring books cause there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>checkpoints and um,</v>

2624
01:56:18.190 --> 01:56:20.910
<v Speaker 1>had a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he um,</v>

2625
01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:24.120
<v Speaker 1>had uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his itunes account with something that</v>

2626
01:56:24.121 --> 01:56:24.960
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

2627
01:56:24.990 --> 01:56:26.610
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country that was tied to you</v>

2628
01:56:26.611 --> 01:56:30.090
<v Speaker 1>couldn't buy good ebooks on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I remember I was getting him,</v>

2629
01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:34.440
<v Speaker 1>I got him all these pirated copies of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 1984 and like James Baldwin and</v>

2630
01:56:34.441 --> 01:56:37.620
<v Speaker 1>catch 22 and stuff to read and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2631
01:56:37.621 --> 01:56:41.520
<v Speaker 1>he only has like a few hours of power a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day and he's like reading like 1984 on</v>

2632
01:56:41.521 --> 01:56:44.340
<v Speaker 1>his phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like the craziest</v>

2633
01:56:44.850 --> 01:56:47.460
<v Speaker 1>illustration of both the like ubiquity</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2634
01:56:47.490 --> 01:56:50.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a book and also the limits of it in this</v>

2635
01:56:50.691 --> 01:56:52.440
<v Speaker 1>sort of cloud edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2636
01:56:52.441 --> 01:56:57.441
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of limits of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our entire society is dependent upon the</v>

2637
01:56:57.751 --> 01:56:59.910
<v Speaker 1>grid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the grid goes down,</v>

2638
01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.720
<v Speaker 1>almost none of this stuff is effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>

2639
01:57:03.721 --> 01:57:06.580
<v Speaker 1>he could smuggle all these books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>past checkpoints and no one knew he had.</v>

2640
01:57:06.581 --> 01:57:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2641
01:57:06.930 --> 01:57:07.920
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2642
01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:08.970
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's,</v>

2643
01:57:08.971 --> 01:57:12.450
<v Speaker 5>there's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're in a war torn area like that,</v>

2644
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:13.740
<v Speaker 5>it's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

2645
01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:14.340
<v Speaker 5>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2646
01:57:14.340 --> 01:57:17.450
<v Speaker 5>it freaks me out when I think of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if something like that happened.</v>

2647
01:57:17.451 --> 01:57:18.510
<v Speaker 5>Like there was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2648
01:57:18.990 --> 01:57:22.440
<v Speaker 5>a big event,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was in Indonesia and at</v>

2649
01:57:22.441 --> 01:57:25.200
<v Speaker 5>70,000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they think that civilization was wiped</v>

2650
01:57:25.201 --> 01:57:28.110
<v Speaker 5>out to the point of there being only a</v>
<v Speaker 5>couple thousand people left on the</v>

2651
01:57:28.111 --> 01:57:28.900
<v Speaker 5>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2652
01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:30.950
<v Speaker 5>Super Volcano erupted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2653
01:57:31.290 --> 01:57:35.820
<v Speaker 5>if anything remotely like that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we would instantaneously be brought</v>

2654
01:57:35.821 --> 01:57:38.460
<v Speaker 5>right back to where people were 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>

2655
01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of us don't have any sort of skills</v>

2656
01:57:40.991 --> 01:57:42.610
<v Speaker 1>to maintain or rebuild anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2657
01:57:42.611 --> 01:57:43.444
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2658
01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:45.340
<v Speaker 1>I know if there like the Zombie</v>
<v Speaker 1>apocalypse,</v>

2659
01:57:45.341 --> 01:57:47.680
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like fucking food or something.</v>

2660
01:57:47.681 --> 01:57:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2661
01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:51.950
<v Speaker 5>And what if we broke into a home depot?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a home depot that's like a</v>

2662
01:57:51.950 --> 01:57:54.380
<v Speaker 5>few miles from here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many fucking people could get a</v>

2663
01:57:54.381 --> 01:57:56.990
<v Speaker 5>hammer from there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people out here,</v>

2664
01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:58.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not enough.</v>

2665
01:57:58.100 --> 01:57:59.520
<v Speaker 5>There's not enough hammers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2666
01:57:59.550 --> 01:58:00.530
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we wouldn't even,</v>

2667
01:58:00.770 --> 01:58:03.230
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'd hope the shelters that we have hold</v>

2668
01:58:03.231 --> 01:58:05.000
<v Speaker 5>up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then where are we going to get food?</v>

2669
01:58:05.001 --> 01:58:07.970
<v Speaker 5>Like what do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless we get into the ocean and go</v>

2670
01:58:07.971 --> 01:58:09.770
<v Speaker 5>fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what are you gonna get to shoot</v>

2671
01:58:09.771 --> 01:58:10.620
<v Speaker 5>deer?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many deer?</v>

2672
01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:12.380
<v Speaker 5>They're like five and this whole</v>
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood,</v>

2673
01:58:12.410 --> 01:58:13.010
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

2674
01:58:13.010 --> 01:58:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Well it's the level of population</v>
<v Speaker 1>density we have could never be supported</v>

2675
01:58:16.971 --> 01:58:18.740
<v Speaker 1>by like traditional agriculture ever.</v>

2676
01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:20.240
<v Speaker 5>Not Anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2677
01:58:20.510 --> 01:58:22.110
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what else is weird?</v>

2678
01:58:22.111 --> 01:58:23.720
<v Speaker 5>The friend of mine pointed this out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

2679
01:58:23.721 --> 01:58:27.920
<v Speaker 5>why is it that when you walked on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>street you see all these plants but none</v>

2680
01:58:27.921 --> 01:58:32.060
<v Speaker 5>of them grow food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like everyone grows plants everywhere.</v>

2681
01:58:32.061 --> 01:58:33.830
<v Speaker 5>But there are all these fucking useless</v>
<v Speaker 5>plants.</v>

2682
01:58:34.100 --> 01:58:36.620
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't it be amazing if like cities</v>

2683
01:58:36.621 --> 01:58:40.440
<v Speaker 5>were filled with plants that grow fruit</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all the,</v>

2684
01:58:40.441 --> 01:58:44.050
<v Speaker 5>the grasses and stuff he saw were edible</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there was lettuce everywhere.</v>

2685
01:58:44.260 --> 01:58:45.970
<v Speaker 5>Like literally everything had food on</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2686
01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.100
<v Speaker 5>Like it would be just the same amount of</v>
<v Speaker 5>water used,</v>

2687
01:58:48.490 --> 01:58:50.590
<v Speaker 5>but you would actually get something out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>

2688
01:58:50.591 --> 01:58:52.630
<v Speaker 5>But we're so rich,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were like,</v>

2689
01:58:52.631 --> 01:58:53.830
<v Speaker 5>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pine trees.</v>

2690
01:58:54.070 --> 01:58:55.030
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to oak,</v>

2691
01:58:55.060 --> 01:58:57.490
<v Speaker 5>I want a beautiful oak here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we don't,</v>

2692
01:58:57.550 --> 01:58:59.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't support the,</v>

2693
01:58:59.351 --> 01:59:00.100
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2694
01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:03.490
<v Speaker 5>the trees and the plants around us that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can actually eat.</v>

2695
01:59:04.210 --> 01:59:08.910
<v Speaker 1>I remember one time I was in um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain and I was like 17,</v>

2696
01:59:08.911 --> 01:59:10.580
<v Speaker 1>it was broke and I was with my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

2697
01:59:10.650 --> 01:59:12.700
<v Speaker 1>my friend and we saw like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2698
01:59:12.701 --> 01:59:13.840
<v Speaker 1>he's orange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheesy,</v>

2699
01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:16.540
<v Speaker 1>steal a lot of oranges to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climb up the tree and be like,</v>

2700
01:59:16.541 --> 01:59:19.240
<v Speaker 1>steal all the oranges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we like peel them and then</v>

2701
01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:21.040
<v Speaker 1>they're like bitter and dry and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2702
01:59:21.041 --> 01:59:23.080
<v Speaker 1>these are fucking decorative oranges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tricked us.</v>

2703
01:59:23.081 --> 01:59:26.260
<v Speaker 1>They tricked us with their there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These oranges are lies.</v>

2704
01:59:26.710 --> 01:59:29.890
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that they specifically probably</v>

2705
01:59:29.891 --> 01:59:33.100
<v Speaker 1>planted those type of oranges to avoid</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad people like us climbing the trees</v>

2706
01:59:33.101 --> 01:59:34.330
<v Speaker 1>and stealing all of them.</v>

2707
01:59:34.670 --> 01:59:37.070
<v Speaker 3>Is that funny?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a bad person because you're doing</v>

2708
01:59:37.071 --> 01:59:39.380
<v Speaker 3>what people have done for the last week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2709
01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:42.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're bad person for picking fruit from</v>

2710
01:59:42.591 --> 01:59:44.090
<v Speaker 3>a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How strange.</v>

2711
01:59:44.710 --> 01:59:48.530
<v Speaker 3>This is w and it's also probably those</v>
<v Speaker 3>were what orange is really tasted like</v>

2712
01:59:48.531 --> 01:59:51.650
<v Speaker 3>before we start fucking with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I refuse to believe that that's a cruel</v>

2713
01:59:51.651 --> 01:59:52.484
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2714
01:59:53.700 --> 01:59:54.120
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2715
01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:57.840
<v Speaker 5>they know that the fact for like corn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of other food was like really</v>

2716
01:59:57.841 --> 02:00:00.540
<v Speaker 5>gross before people started manipulating</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2717
02:00:01.720 --> 02:00:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

2718
02:00:02.621 --> 02:00:03.520
<v Speaker 1>but orange is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>

2719
02:00:03.521 --> 02:00:06.580
<v Speaker 1>I want to believe that like prehistoric</v>
<v Speaker 1>oranges were a tasty treat and these</v>

2720
02:00:06.581 --> 02:00:07.310
<v Speaker 1>were not,</v>

2721
02:00:07.310 --> 02:00:08.143
<v Speaker 5>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2722

<v Speaker 5>my friends were laughing more eating</v>

02:00:50.971 --> 02:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

2742
02:00:52.021 --> 02:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2743
02:00:53.221 --> 02:00:54.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting like deep into the memory</v>
<v Speaker 1>bank.</v>

2744
02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:57.750
<v Speaker 1>When I was seven and I lived in far</v>
<v Speaker 1>rockaway.</v>

2745
02:00:58.110 --> 02:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the neighbors had a crab</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple tree or it had the tree with the</v>

2746
02:01:01.111 --> 02:01:02.170
<v Speaker 1>little apples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the ground,</v>

2747
02:01:02.470 --> 02:01:04.260
<v Speaker 1>the crab apples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that,</v>

2748
02:01:04.261 --> 02:01:05.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe I stole some of them and I</v>

2749
02:01:05.491 --> 02:01:06.370
<v Speaker 1>believe they're very sour.</v>

2750
02:01:06.630 --> 02:01:07.463
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember them.</v>

2751
02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:09.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very sour.</v>

2752
02:01:09.001 --> 02:01:10.860
<v Speaker 3>I ate one of those when I was a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid.</v>

2753
02:01:10.861 --> 02:01:13.350
<v Speaker 3>Well more than once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure when I was a little kid growing</v>

2754
02:01:13.351 --> 02:01:16.230
<v Speaker 3>up from Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember biting into those things.</v>

2755
02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:18.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much hope.</v>

2756
02:01:19.220 --> 02:01:21.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the good they're throwing at people</v>

2757
02:01:21.001 --> 02:01:22.680
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what we use them for.</v>

2758
02:01:22.870 --> 02:01:25.090
<v Speaker 3>The kids taste nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chuck them at each other.</v>

2759
02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:26.490
<v Speaker 3>Small and hard like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2760
02:01:26.491 --> 02:01:29.830
<v Speaker 3>Well you know your little tiny hands and</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a good grip on the crab apple new</v>

2761
02:01:29.860 --> 02:01:30.840
<v Speaker 3>whip it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>

2762
02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:32.610
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2763
02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:34.620
<v Speaker 3>what else you got going on these days</v>
<v Speaker 3>besides,</v>

2764
02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:36.690
<v Speaker 3>I know you're promoting this book and</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2765
02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:40.160
<v Speaker 3>besides that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to really excited</v>

2766
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:41.840
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to India for a month cause</v>

2767
02:01:41.841 --> 02:01:43.730
<v Speaker 1>there's all these literary festivals in</v>
<v Speaker 1>India,</v>

2768
02:01:43.731 --> 02:01:45.170
<v Speaker 1>so I'm getting to good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2769
02:01:45.171 --> 02:01:48.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Dji pour and Mumbai and ben before.</v>

2770
02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:49.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's my first time in my life.</v>

2771
02:01:49.971 --> 02:01:53.570
<v Speaker 1>So I'm really excited about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then besides that,</v>

2772
02:01:54.170 --> 02:01:56.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm reaching that point of</v>

2773
02:01:56.331 --> 02:01:57.430
<v Speaker 1>burnout where I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just,</v>

2774
02:01:57.470 --> 02:01:59.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm like actually planning to take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>month off.</v>

2775
02:01:59.390 --> 02:02:01.250
<v Speaker 1>I know it sounds like fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like fucking blast for me,</v>

2776
02:02:01.251 --> 02:02:06.080
<v Speaker 1>but I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to like lie on a beach and go</v>

2777
02:02:06.081 --> 02:02:09.470
<v Speaker 1>or something and read a lot of books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And other than that,</v>

2778
02:02:09.471 --> 02:02:12.590
<v Speaker 1>the only thing I really have to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about is my super dork hobby,</v>

2779
02:02:12.591 --> 02:02:13.510
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2780
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I've been studying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2781
02:02:15.050 --> 02:02:18.440
<v Speaker 1>literary Arabic for the last year and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got pretty good at translating stuff.</v>

2782
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Written stuff.</v>

2783
02:02:19.190 --> 02:02:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2784
02:02:20.211 --> 02:02:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really pretty proud of it.</v>

2785
02:02:22.131 --> 02:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>I do this every morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2786
02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:26.230
<v Speaker 1>so I'm translating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2787
02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:30.860
<v Speaker 1>like long dialogue by the Syrian poet</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's called sex poetry in the</v>

2788
02:02:30.861 --> 02:02:34.970
<v Speaker 1>revolution and it is bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But other than that,</v>

2789
02:02:34.971 --> 02:02:38.180
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm actually going into that</v>

2790
02:02:38.181 --> 02:02:40.430
<v Speaker 1>lake time where I'm just making like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little blank space.</v>

2791
02:02:40.431 --> 02:02:43.370
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end of that I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably be back doing a bunch of</v>

2792
02:02:43.371 --> 02:02:47.270
<v Speaker 1>journalism for vice doing stuff on</v>
<v Speaker 1>prisons in the Middle East working on my</v>

2793
02:02:47.271 --> 02:02:50.060
<v Speaker 1>next book project and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing,</v>

2794
02:02:50.090 --> 02:02:53.250
<v Speaker 1>seeing where life goes cause thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so strange about doing a memoir</v>

2795
02:02:53.251 --> 02:02:58.251
<v Speaker 1>or is it really is like sectioning off</v>
<v Speaker 1>at chapter six section off,</v>

2796
02:02:59.270 --> 02:03:02.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years of your life and then you've</v>

2797
02:03:02.331 --> 02:03:05.150
<v Speaker 1>taken all of that and you've put it into</v>
<v Speaker 1>this book for him.</v>

2798
02:03:05.151 --> 02:03:08.630
<v Speaker 1>You've made it into an object and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go onto what's next.</v>

2799
02:03:08.631 --> 02:03:12.260
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess while I have the vague contours</v>

2800
02:03:12.261 --> 02:03:15.500
<v Speaker 1>of that in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of me just wants to do nothing for</v>

2801
02:03:15.501 --> 02:03:16.970
<v Speaker 1>awhile and then the plan will come to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2802
02:03:17.060 --> 02:03:18.630
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2803
02:03:18.631 --> 02:03:21.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking the same thing about my own</v>
<v Speaker 2>life right now.</v>

2804
02:03:21.381 --> 02:03:25.820
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm too involved and too many</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things and I could use a</v>

2805
02:03:25.890 --> 02:03:28.460
<v Speaker 2>reset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a calming as to,</v>

2806
02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:32.120
<v Speaker 2>I think you get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all good stuff and that's the</v>

2807
02:03:32.121 --> 02:03:34.790
<v Speaker 2>problem and I think that's what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiencing as well.</v>

2808
02:03:34.791 --> 02:03:37.250
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have so many cool things you have</v>

2809
02:03:37.251 --> 02:03:38.240
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

2810
02:03:38.241 --> 02:03:40.220
<v Speaker 2>I feel so lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2811
02:03:40.330 --> 02:03:42.470
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if there's no space,</v>

2812
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:45.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean can absorb them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2813
02:03:45.171 --> 02:03:46.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Louis C K thing about like never</v>

2814
02:03:46.971 --> 02:03:48.050
<v Speaker 1>being bored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2815
02:03:48.051 --> 02:03:50.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have that in the best of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible ways.</v>

2816
02:03:50.541 --> 02:03:53.780
<v Speaker 1>I have like so many cool opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you never have like any,</v>

2817
02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:58.160
<v Speaker 1>any time to like be bored or be down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just like bouncing from thing to</v>

2818
02:03:58.161 --> 02:04:00.440
<v Speaker 1>thing and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2819
02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:00.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2820
02:04:00.690 --> 02:04:03.330
<v Speaker 2>Louis C K thing about never being born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not aware of it.</v>

2821
02:04:03.460 --> 02:04:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a monologue that he had a,</v>

2822
02:04:05.551 --> 02:04:07.970
<v Speaker 1>about where he was saying that since we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have smartphones,</v>

2823
02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:09.520
<v Speaker 1>basically we just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now I remember it.</v>

2824
02:04:09.521 --> 02:04:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you never had like any space to feel</v>

2825
02:04:11.681 --> 02:04:13.660
<v Speaker 1>anything or to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or to be bored.</v>

2826
02:04:13.661 --> 02:04:16.190
<v Speaker 1>And so you're just always in a state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>distraction.</v>

2827
02:04:16.191 --> 02:04:19.150
<v Speaker 1>And I think it can be like that with</v>
<v Speaker 1>work stuff too.</v>

2828
02:04:19.151 --> 02:04:22.690
<v Speaker 1>So after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably just probably just doing a</v>

2829
02:04:22.691 --> 02:04:25.420
<v Speaker 1>bunch of journalism stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work a lot with a really cool,</v>

2830
02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:28.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm Syrian American nonprofit that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to plug here.</v>

2831
02:04:29.140 --> 02:04:34.140

<v Speaker 1>I'm foundation and I'm they k a r a m</v>

2832
02:04:34.810 --> 02:04:38.160
<v Speaker 1>and they do something really cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot attention right now it's</v>

2833
02:04:38.161 --> 02:04:40.770
<v Speaker 1>on the Syrian refugees that make it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

2834
02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:44.730
<v Speaker 1>but they actually work with people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are displaced inside Syria.</v>

2835
02:04:44.731 --> 02:04:46.440
<v Speaker 1>And then also people like on the border.</v>

2836
02:04:46.890 --> 02:04:48.260
<v Speaker 1>And for the last two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2837
02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I've taken part in a program with them</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we go down to the schools that are</v>

2838
02:04:52.321 --> 02:04:55.580

<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

<v Speaker 1>bring up I doctors that get all the kids</v>

2841
02:04:59.131 --> 02:05:02.640

<v Speaker 1>so next spring I'll probably be back</v>

<v Speaker 1>lots of rebellious cats all over a</v>

<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You live such a low ball,</v>

2849

<v Speaker 5>I mean you've had so many really intense</v>

2855
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:42.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel so lucky.</v>

2856
02:05:42.351 --> 02:05:43.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why it's so hard for me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

2857
02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:48.070
<v Speaker 1>I need to take a reset because it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole world is so big and cool and I</v>

2858
02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:49.340
<v Speaker 1>love so many things in it.</v>

2859
02:05:49.700 --> 02:05:51.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think,</v>

2860
02:05:51.170 --> 02:05:52.790
<v Speaker 5>I think your instincts are correct</v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

2861
02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:54.860
<v Speaker 5>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems to me like you're just,</v>

2862
02:05:54.861 --> 02:05:57.320
<v Speaker 5>you've got so much going on all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

2863
02:05:57.321 --> 02:06:00.110
<v Speaker 5>Constantly in so many different arenas.</v>

2864
02:06:00.930 --> 02:06:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2865
02:06:02.130 --> 02:06:04.250
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know.</v>

2866
02:06:04.270 --> 02:06:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Must be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be the same with you too.</v>

2867
02:06:05.821 --> 02:06:07.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean like you d ina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do comedy,</v>

2868
02:06:07.471 --> 02:06:10.200
<v Speaker 1>you do this like super like thoughtful</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk thing.</v>

2869
02:06:10.201 --> 02:06:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Do you like host MMA stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean you've done like so many</v>

2870
02:06:12.391 --> 02:06:16.680
<v Speaker 1>fucking things and I mean it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause like I feel perhaps you feel this</v>

2871
02:06:16.681 --> 02:06:18.540
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the world is just so big and weird</v>

2872
02:06:18.541 --> 02:06:20.790
<v Speaker 1>and interesting and like I just want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like learn stuff.</v>

2873
02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:23.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish I could live 10 different lives</v>

2874
02:06:23.301 --> 02:06:26.400
<v Speaker 5>simultaneously and have a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 5>different careers that I'd be interested</v>

2875
02:06:26.401 --> 02:06:27.151
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Same.</v>

2876
02:06:27.151 --> 02:06:28.140
<v Speaker 5>Same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2877
02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:32.850
<v Speaker 5>But it's like to do any of those things</v>
<v Speaker 5>correctly requires so much attention and</v>

2878
02:06:32.851 --> 02:06:35.070
<v Speaker 5>focus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like you can't,</v>

2879
02:06:35.420 --> 02:06:39.720
<v Speaker 5>you can enjoy too many things cause you</v>
<v Speaker 5>then the one thing that you enjoy the</v>

2880
02:06:39.721 --> 02:06:41.880
<v Speaker 5>most or that you choose to enjoy the</v>
<v Speaker 5>most,</v>

2881
02:06:42.310 --> 02:06:44.160
<v Speaker 5>he really can't focus on it correctly</v>

2882
02:06:44.310 --> 02:06:46.770
<v Speaker 1>or else you just never ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever have downtime ever.</v>

2883
02:06:47.740 --> 02:06:49.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm close to that.</v>

2884
02:06:49.720 --> 02:06:51.910
<v Speaker 5>I get close to that sometimes but it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>not good.</v>

2885
02:06:52.020 --> 02:06:55.990
<v Speaker 5>But it's weird because like my non</v>
<v Speaker 5>downtime seems very recreational.</v>

2886
02:06:56.490 --> 02:06:57.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2887
02:06:57.101 --> 02:06:58.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Super Fun.</v>

2888
02:06:58.301 --> 02:07:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want to like complain like</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2889
02:07:00.491 --> 02:07:05.470
<v Speaker 1>I get to travel all over the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet fascinating people in Confront</v>

2890
02:07:05.470 --> 02:07:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Bastards Boohoo for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet he didn't,</v>

2891
02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:10.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it at a certain,</v>

2892
02:07:10.150 --> 02:07:11.070
<v Speaker 1>at a certain point,</v>

2893
02:07:11.580 --> 02:07:12.413
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2894
02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:15.680
<v Speaker 5>this is a big compliment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm a,</v>

2895
02:07:15.690 --> 02:07:18.210
<v Speaker 5>and I don't mean this in terms of an</v>
<v Speaker 5>imitation,</v>

2896
02:07:18.211 --> 02:07:21.570
<v Speaker 5>but your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your drawing of trump and Ivanka was</v>

2897
02:07:21.571 --> 02:07:22.980
<v Speaker 5>very ralph steadman s</v>

2898
02:07:23.150 --> 02:07:24.410
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I idolize that guy.</v>

2899
02:07:24.411 --> 02:07:25.170
<v Speaker 1>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2900
02:07:25.170 --> 02:07:26.510
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a massive compliment.</v>

2901
02:07:26.511 --> 02:07:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Like I think that man is like a God</v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst men.</v>

2902
02:07:29.170 --> 02:07:33.430
<v Speaker 5>He's a bad motherfucker for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that image is just so much like,</v>

2903
02:07:33.670 --> 02:07:36.700
<v Speaker 5>I think of it as like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Kentucky Derby is decadent.</v>

2904
02:07:36.701 --> 02:07:37.534
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2905
02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:41.590
<v Speaker 4>Monster like toad people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2906
02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:44.220
<v Speaker 5>I've got that on framed on my wall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my office,</v>

2907
02:07:44.250 --> 02:07:48.320
<v Speaker 5>a print from a stubbins illustration of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Kentucky Derby.</v>

2908
02:07:48.410 --> 02:07:49.243
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever had,</v>

2909
02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:50.630
<v Speaker 4>have you ever like had him on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>shower?</v>

2910
02:07:50.631 --> 02:07:51.464
<v Speaker 4>Do you want to get in Ken?</v>

2911
02:07:51.550 --> 02:07:52.660
<v Speaker 5>I would love to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2912
02:07:52.661 --> 02:07:54.160
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if he's ever in Los</v>
<v Speaker 5>Angeles,</v>

2913
02:07:54.161 --> 02:07:56.530
<v Speaker 5>but I prefer to do these things in</v>
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>

2914
02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:59.620
<v Speaker 5>But if he's ever here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would love to have much to talk to him</v>

2915
02:07:59.621 --> 02:08:03.510
<v Speaker 5>about a hunter and what it looks like</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what does last at for time hundred</v>

2916
02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:04.500
<v Speaker 5>dose and with acid.</v>

2917
02:08:05.700 --> 02:08:06.151
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they,</v>

2918
02:08:06.151 --> 02:08:08.360
<v Speaker 4>when they went to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they went to the rumble in the</v>

2919
02:08:08.361 --> 02:08:10.890
<v Speaker 4>jungle and hunter like sold their</v>
<v Speaker 4>tickets and,</v>

2920
02:08:11.150 --> 02:08:13.460
<v Speaker 4>and he was like drawing and off the TV</v>
<v Speaker 4>screen.</v>

2921
02:08:13.550 --> 02:08:15.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was swimming in the pool and he</v>

2922
02:08:15.231 --> 02:08:19.100
<v Speaker 5>totally fucked the whole story up</v>
<v Speaker 5>because he thought that one was going to</v>

2923
02:08:19.101 --> 02:08:20.930
<v Speaker 5>kill Muhammad Ali and he didn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>see it.</v>

2924
02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:25.270
<v Speaker 5>So you put a Richard Nixon mask on and</v>
<v Speaker 5>swam around the yeah,</v>

2925
02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:26.960
<v Speaker 5>the bull.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He to this day over,</v>

2926
02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:28.850
<v Speaker 5>well not to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously he's dead,</v>

2927
02:08:28.851 --> 02:08:31.940
<v Speaker 5>but considered that one of his biggest</v>
<v Speaker 5>journalistic failures and he went into a</v>

2928
02:08:31.941 --> 02:08:36.650
<v Speaker 5>giant slump after he did that because</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he realized that his decadence and</v>

2929
02:08:36.651 --> 02:08:41.570
<v Speaker 5>his indulgence had actually gotten in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way of an amazing moment in history.</v>

2930
02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:47.780
<v Speaker 5>God just to realize like the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>like beautiful beast that like you rode</v>

2931
02:08:47.781 --> 02:08:50.060
<v Speaker 5>to being who you were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it was turning around and like</v>

2932
02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:52.640
<v Speaker 5>becoming like a sort of cliche that was</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking up everything.</v>

2933
02:08:52.641 --> 02:08:54.240
<v Speaker 5>You liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's what the,</v>

2934
02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:56.720
<v Speaker 5>did you ever see the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alex Gibney movie?</v>

2935
02:08:56.840 --> 02:08:57.950
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gonzo,</v>

2936
02:08:57.951 --> 02:09:01.160
<v Speaker 5>the life and times of Dr. Hunter is</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking incredible.</v>

2937
02:09:01.161 --> 02:09:04.250
<v Speaker 5>It's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's such a good documentary.</v>

2938
02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:09.430
<v Speaker 5>But that was almost like initially</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how they started the movie off.</v>

2939
02:09:10.130 --> 02:09:13.400
<v Speaker 5>He started the movie off explaining that</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the end of his life,</v>

2940
02:09:13.401 --> 02:09:15.920
<v Speaker 5>hunter had really stopped being</v>
<v Speaker 5>creative.</v>

2941
02:09:16.220 --> 02:09:19.430
<v Speaker 5>The writing wasn't there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The things that he wrote were like</v>

2942
02:09:19.431 --> 02:09:21.830
<v Speaker 5>really a middling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they weren't that good and it was</v>

2943
02:09:21.831 --> 02:09:26.831
<v Speaker 5>because his indulgences and his excesses</v>
<v Speaker 5>had really cooked his brain and he just</v>

2944
02:09:27.921 --> 02:09:31.370
<v Speaker 5>had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had become almost a caricature of</v>

2945
02:09:31.371 --> 02:09:35.840
<v Speaker 5>himself and along the lines,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the interviews they had found</v>

2946
02:09:35.841 --> 02:09:39.260
<v Speaker 5>him when he was a younger man and when</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had started to become famous and he</v>

2947
02:09:39.261 --> 02:09:41.450
<v Speaker 5>was actually worried about that very</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

2948
02:09:41.451 --> 02:09:42.440
<v Speaker 5>You were saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2949
02:09:42.590 --> 02:09:46.820
<v Speaker 5>I can't even get out of my own way</v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore and they don't even necessarily</v>

2950
02:09:46.821 --> 02:09:48.710
<v Speaker 5>when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I'm doing these things,</v>

2951
02:09:49.190 --> 02:09:54.190
<v Speaker 5>I can't tell whether or not they want me</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they want my take on things or</v>

2952
02:09:54.351 --> 02:09:56.930
<v Speaker 5>whether they want the reality itself</v>
<v Speaker 5>like an I,</v>

2953
02:09:56.980 --> 02:09:58.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>

2954
02:09:58.790 --> 02:10:01.850
<v Speaker 5>it's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would almost be better if I died like</v>

2955
02:10:01.851 --> 02:10:02.870
<v Speaker 5>for my own work.</v>

2956
02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:04.440
<v Speaker 5>And that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

2957
02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:09.540
<v Speaker 5>this guy is like experiencing like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>really early version of both.</v>

2958
02:10:09.891 --> 02:10:13.100
<v Speaker 5>Also very rare that a journalist's</v>
<v Speaker 5>becomes that famous,</v>

2959
02:10:13.130 --> 02:10:14.210
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so rare,</v>

2960
02:10:14.211 --> 02:10:16.480
<v Speaker 5>so rare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>

2961
02:10:16.510 --> 02:10:19.430
<v Speaker 5>I think the problem was that he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at a certain point,</v>

2962
02:10:19.431 --> 02:10:22.280
<v Speaker 5>he stopped growing and changing and</v>
<v Speaker 5>pushing himself and it was just more</v>

2963
02:10:22.281 --> 02:10:24.920
<v Speaker 5>comfortable to like stay in the mask.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2964
02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:26.750
<v Speaker 5>no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2965
02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:27.673
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2966
02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:32.680
<v Speaker 5>and also the indulgences and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>substances became not just a habit but a</v>

2967
02:10:33.651 --> 02:10:36.920
<v Speaker 5>physical addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And at that point in time,</v>

2968
02:10:37.540 --> 02:10:42.140
<v Speaker 5>he's more of a slave to that than he is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even though the work itself and the work</v>

2969
02:10:42.141 --> 02:10:44.540
