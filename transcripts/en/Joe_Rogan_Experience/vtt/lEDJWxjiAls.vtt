1
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.560
Hello Freak bitches.
That's right.
That's right.
We'll back.
That's right.

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.340
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by legal zoom.

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.450
Legal Zoom is a,
a company that I love and respect,

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.390
but I'm not going to read their copy.
This is why,

5
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.820
cause I'm going to read their copy to you and you're going to understand right

6
00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:22.560
away.
Why wouldn't just read their copy?

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.620
America was built by innovators and dreamers.

8
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:30.000
People like Thomas Edison and Henry Ford laid the foundation for our country.

9
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.440
Feel free to use different names.
I would use Ron,
Jeremy,
and uh,

10
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.090
Oliver Stone.
I would use Joe Rogan.
Oh,
Moshi.
So sweet.

11
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.230
These days.
It's innovators and entrepreneurs all around us.

12
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:46.380
I think this country was founded by savages trying to escape,

13
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.080
escape a dictatorship.
But what the fuck do I know?

14
00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:53.340
I have rudimentary grasp of history.
They were innovative savages.
Yeah.

15
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:55.650
They're kind of innovator where they,
uh,
you know,

16
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.880
wanting to be free with had slaves.
It was a new thing.
Uh,
this month,

17
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:03.420
legal zoom celebrates innovation by helping you launch your dream.
Not that,

18
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:04.890
by the way,
I should just clarify.

19
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:08.580
Not that I'm anything against pioneers or pilgrims.
Oh yeah.

20
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:11.270
You might get some pioneers blogging about too.
They get fucking pistols.

21
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.290
Pilgrims,
they get nutty.
That's the one time will they'll use a computer.
Yeah.

22
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.300
They fire it up with their water wheel.
They get online.
That's it.

23
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:20.910
They start splitting wood.
This is going to be a long session.

24
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:21.744
I'm gonna need a lot of wood.

25
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.320
That's back when America online was only the 13 colonies,
a o,

26
00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:29.370
l I fucking bobcat.
Goldthwait still as AOL.

27
00:01:29.371 --> 00:01:33.870
He gave me his email the other day was an AOL email.
He doesn't fuck around,
man.

28
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.040
Yeah,
well,
they got hacked recently.
There was some issue recently.

29
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.460
Somebody probably just realized that,
oh,
they're here.
Let's hack them.

30
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.670
They were even know they were able to break into the personal information of

31
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:49.480
senior citizens across the land.
You've got mail.
Remember that?
That was good,
man.

32
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.970
Remember that?
That was awesome.

33
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.320
Until you got mail every fucking second of every day.
You know if you mentioned,

34
00:01:55.321 --> 00:01:57.300
if you had that shit today,
you've got mail,
you've got mail,

35
00:01:57.301 --> 00:02:00.510
you've got to fucking Jesus fucking Christ and weirdly enough,

36
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:04.220
all of this was the copy from legal zoom.com yes,
exactly.

37
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.330
The copy this month,

38
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:09.840
legal zoom celebrates innovation by helping you launch your dream.

39
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.680
Here's what legal zoom actually is.
This is my version of it.

40
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.960
Legal Zoom is an awesome way to take care of legal shit at home from the privacy

41
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:23.121
of your own apartment or house and you could do it drunk and naked and no one

42
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:28.160
can stop you and it's legal and if you can,
if you're a functional drunk.
I said,

43
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.290
do it man.
Fuck it.
Fuck the system man.

44
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.800
But what you can do with legal zoom is take care of a lot of shit that you would

45
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.910
ordinarily have to go to a law office for.
Things like incorporating,

46
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:41.040
forming an LLC to start a business.

47
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.310
You can get that done cheaper at legal zoom like you can incorporate starting at

48
00:02:46.891 --> 00:02:51.630
99 bucks and no trips don't have to go anywhere.

49
00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:56.631
Don't have to make an appointment to be somewhere at a very specific time.

50
00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:59.920
You can do it in the middle of the night when the world is asleep

51
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.980
<v 1>and if you panic,</v>

52
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.690
legal zoom can set you up with a third party independent attorney.

53
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:10.330
Cause I know that is a big issue with a lot of folks.
You know,

54
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:13.510
you don't feel like this is all right and does it.
And some people like,
you know,

55
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:18.430
it comes something dealing with the law and get very touchy and rightly so.
It's,

56
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.850
you know,
the worst case scenarios,
they could lock you in fucking cage.

57
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.350
That's not good.
Anyway,

58
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.790
celebrate innovation with legal zoom through the end of June and get a special

59
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:29.950
price on trademark copyright or

60
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.870
provisional patent applications.
That's a weird word.

61
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.250
You never see that provisional

62
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.800
<v 2>provisional application for patents.
It's say,
uh,</v>

63
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.270
what does that just to file a provisional patent applications?
I think it's,

64
00:03:44.271 --> 00:03:48.560
if you have an idea you filed for a provisional patent before they actually

65
00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:51.740
grant you a pattern so that nobody else can take that technology.

66
00:03:51.741 --> 00:03:54.170
And so it was my idea.
I think that's exactly what it is.

67
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.710
I don't know why it's provisional.
I don't even know what provisional means.

68
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.920
I would think of provisional as being like a locational thing.
You know,

69
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.190
like it's a provisional jurisdiction.
What's like a pro,
you know,

70
00:04:04.191 --> 00:04:06.620
we'll let you do it,
but we have a couple of provisions.
Right.

71
00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:09.670
I was thinking of as a province,
you know,
I'm thinking of it in the wrong way.

72
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.633
Well

73
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.440
I'm thinking of is like a province like provisional being like the province of

74
00:04:15.441 --> 00:04:19.280
Quebec provincial.
Yeah.
That's what it is.
I'm saying it wrong.
I have an idea.

75
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.840
Right.
Provision is a provision,
not a cat food that the dog can eat.
Awesome.

76
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.810
Like it's caffeine and dog food.
It's just one fit.
What are you calling it?

77
00:04:26.811 --> 00:04:31.200
Provisional Kibble.
Provisional Food for your fucking pen.

78
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.060
Where did that come from?
Because my cat eats my dog.
Oh,
you want to cut my cash?

79
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.870
Well your dog's probably,
yeah.

80
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.520
<v 1>Better off than the cat is cause cats.
If you,
if you only fed your cat dog food,</v>

81
00:04:42.521 --> 00:04:46.510
the cat would probably get sick.
Yeah.
That's why you can't have vegan cats.

82
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.670
Like even people who are like hardcore vegans,

83
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:52.190
they eventually give up and started giving their cats animal protein because the

84
00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:56.560
cats get really sick cats or an animal that needs almost entirely protein.

85
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.850
I'm willing to kill my cat in the name of animal rights too.
That's dope.

86
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.290
Yeah.
Anyway,
uh,
legal zoom,

87
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:09.250
go to legalzoom.com they have an a plus from the better business bureau,
so wow.

88
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.143
That's all you need to know.

89
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.400
But celebrate innovation with legal zoom through the end of June and get a

90
00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:20.320
special price again on trademark copyright or provisional patent applications by

91

92
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.800
zoom.com legal zoom provides legal help through independent attorneys and self

93
00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:32.500
help,
but they are not a law firm.
Okay Bitch.

94
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.760
So don't be suing legal zoom cause that shit will turn out ugly for you.

95
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.601
<v 2>You son.
Yeah.</v>

96
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:40.890
Like who's going to do it as a negative thing against him on the better business

97
00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:41.191
bureau?

98
00:05:41.191 --> 00:05:46.191
I'd be scared as fuck the legal zoom knows a thing or two about their rights and

99
00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:48.400
how to fuck you right back,
Mr.

100
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.050
<v 1>Anyway,
legal,
zoom.com using code word Brogan,
save yourself some money.</v>

101
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.410
We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that is o n n I t if you are to

102
00:05:57.411 --> 00:06:00.140
get in shape,
if you're looking for home exercise equipment,

103
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:03.290
if you're looking for healthy foods and supplements that you could eat post

104
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:08.291
workout we got you covered at on it on it is what we call it human optimization

105
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:09.740
website.
Uh,

106
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.060
what that means is when we find anything that benefits the body,

107
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:18.260
the brain,
anything new,
strength and conditioning equipment that's out,

108
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.420
things that people are using to help their endurance or their immune system.

109
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.190
Shroom tech immune is one of those that we take a,
we have a for sale and uh,

110
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.850
it works in a very interesting way.
Um,

111
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.760
similar to what I'm Doctor Rhonda Patrick was talking about on the podcast the

112
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.180
other day,
she was,
uh,
if you haven't listened to that one fascinating stuff,

113
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.980
I still have to go over it again and take notes and start googling shit because

114
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.560
whenever she's on,
she's,
she's so smart.

115
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.440
She just rattles off information at this ridiculous pace.

116
00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:50.300
And you have to go back and try to decipher what,

117
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.020
what makes sense about all of it,
but the way shrimp tech works,

118
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.010
all the supplements,

119
00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:57.860
whether it's shrimp tack or whether it's Alpha brain or anything else.

120
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.470
If you go to the almond website,
that's o,

121
00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:03.710
n n I t and click on the link for any of the supplements.

122
00:07:03.711 --> 00:07:08.711
There's a very detailed overview of everything that the supplement does,

123
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.170
what it's all based on.
Then there is a research link.

124
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:13.730
If you click on the research link,

125
00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:18.710
it will show you all the clinically tested aspects of each and every product

126
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:23.180
that we sell.
Also,
if you,
even if you go through all that,
and even if you,

127
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.360
you try it and you go,
you know what,
this,
I don't like this shit.

128
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:30.230
This is bullshit.
You get 100% of your money back.

129
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.460
If you send nothing,
you don't have to send in the bottle of pills.

130
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.430
You don't have to do anything for the first 30 pills.
You have 90 days.

131
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.880
Try Your Alpha brain,
try shroom tech.
If you don't believe in it,

132
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.210
get your money back.
You don't have to return anything.

133
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.440
No one's trying to fuck you.

134
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.340
All were trying to do is sell you shit that we use all the things that we sell

135
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:52.190
at Alpha brain,
at a on it rather,
whether it's Alpha brain,

136
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.360
whether it's a strength and conditioning equipment like the kettle bells or the

137
00:07:56.361 --> 00:08:00.740
weight vest.
I use all that shit.
And uh,
I think that it's all beneficial.

138
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.820
There's science behind all of it and there's a history of use,

139
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.190
whether it's a history of use of the supplements,

140
00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:11.100
whether it's the nootropics or whether it's a shroom tech,
which is a UN,

141
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.810
well there's two,
there's one for the immune system and shroom tech sport,

142
00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:17.060
which is an endurance based supplement.

143
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.230
Both of them are based on a different types of mushrooms that have been shown to

144
00:08:21.231 --> 00:08:26.130
have an excellent effect on oxygen absorption.
The shroom tech,
uh,

145
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.690
immune one is a pretty fascinating,
but the shroom tech sport one is,

146
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.470
is really obvious.
Like if you use it,
you will,

147
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.790
you will feel a big difference in the amount of energy have.

148
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.440
It's like you get an extra gear.

149
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:41.950
All of is explained way better than I'm going to be able to do it@onnit.com but

150
00:08:43.161 --> 00:08:47.870
the key ingredient is a quarter steps mushroom,
cordyceps,
sinensis and cordyceps.

151
00:08:47.871 --> 00:08:51.560
Sinensis is a fascinating mushroom.
Uh,

152
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.740
that's several thousand years ago,
high in the mountains of Tibet.

153
00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:58.440
Herdsmen noticed that when their herds would graze on this certain fungus,

154
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:01.050
they were noticeably more lively and energetic.

155
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.680
All of it is explained@onnit.com use the code word Rogan and you will save 10%

156
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.390
off any and all supplements.
You got any shows coming up?
Anything

157
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.600
<v 3>a comic con 2014 oh Jesus.</v>

158
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:18.130
Louise's is that in San Diego,
California,
where you have to hide your weed?

159
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.160
No doubt.
I had to do that.
I was there all weekend h hiding my,

160
00:09:21.161 --> 00:09:24.290
we'd buy a comic con.
We were doing kill Tony Funder,

161
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.720
pussy and a comedy show the following day.
Beautiful,
glorious.

162
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.370
And if you could go to legal zoom,

163
00:09:30.371 --> 00:09:34.030
you could change your name was one of the services and you can buy on it and

164
00:09:34.031 --> 00:09:37.090
then return it and then change your name again by more on it.
Return it.

165
00:09:37.091 --> 00:09:39.310
You could just keep on changing your name and getting free on it.

166
00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.890
<v 1>You retarded.
Why would you even say that?</v>

167
00:09:42.891 --> 00:09:45.770
You don't know Jesus Christ.

168
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.170
That would cost so much money to change her name that many times.

169
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.720
I don't think it would.
If you could save like $100 on it,

170
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.340
there's a lot of idiots who would do anyway.
Um,
what else is going on?
Uh,

171
00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:00.240
killed Tony.
No.
Um,
Thunderpussy this Friday,

172
00:10:00.241 --> 00:10:01.470
Thunderpussy and you're going to be doing,

173
00:10:01.471 --> 00:10:03.480
I'm going to be doing it and I won't be sober.

174
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.450
There's only one way to do Thunderpussy.
That's right.
You gotta be fucked up.

175
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.700
So I'm going to take a lot of coconut water that day.

176
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:13.290
Get a lot of electrolytes in my system and let the party begin and that's going

177
00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:17.880
to sell out.
It's a little tiny ass room,
so that's only like 80 seats.
Um,

178
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.680
the next gigs that I have on the road,

179
00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:24.681
I'm at the Orpheum theater in Vancouver on June 13th with Brian Cowen and Tony

180
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.110
Hinchcliffe.
Oh,
suck at Jesus.

181
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:33.120
And you could find the information for all of that@joerogan.net.

182
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.360
All my tour dates and all that stuff is up there.
All right.
Motion caches here.

183
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.160
Well,
I fall.
Go round.
I got dates.
Please fuck with some dots.
Yeah,

184
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.470
man.
That shit out.
And he's hilarious comedian.

185
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.421
<v 2>Yeah,
come see me.</v>

186
00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:48.810
I'll be at Johnny Brenda's in Philadelphia on June the third and uh,

187
00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:52.940
also be in Fort Lauderdale and Connecticut at the comics thing.

188
00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:57.740
Their choices.
Two very brave choice.
It's bad.
It's brave.

189
00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.430
Wonderful,
brave.
It's sort of like a,
it's a balance sheet.

190
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.350
And then I'm going to boat party.biz.
That's a comedy show on a,
on a cruise.

191
00:11:06.351 --> 00:11:10.520
So everybody go there and go to my scope.
Thrown anybody overboard as a joke.

192
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:16.190
That's my closer because the cap 10 overboard and we try and get home.
All right.

193
00:11:16.191 --> 00:11:20.060
Boom.
Click the loop.
Oh,
what did you give up your website?
Oh yeah.

194
00:11:20.061 --> 00:11:23.270
Moshe kasher.com the only important one is Philadelphia.
Come see me there.

195
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.470
<v 1>Go see him in Philly.
You fucked.
Hit The music</v>

196
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.540
experience.

197
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:38.330
<v 2>Oh,
sweet baby.
Lebus Moshe Kasher.</v>

198
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:41.300
<v 1>Sir.
Welcome to the blackout.
Oh Man.
Thank you.
I'm so glad to be here.</v>

199
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.050
Thank you for asking me.
I was watching you last night.
I watched you on set list.

200
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:46.970
Oh really?
That was really fun.
Thanks man.

201
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:50.460
Set List was just very similar in a lot of ways to uh,
Thunderpussy.

202
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.980
What's Thunderpussy all about?
Tony puts,
he's a podcast

203
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.610
<v 0>where you go on stage and you do none of your material.</v>

204
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.880
You go onstage and the audience will yell out topics and you just riff from

205
00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:06.370
there and try to do a whole set based on their suggestions.

206
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.760
That sounds like exactly in my wheelhouse.
Yeah,
it's my sweet spot.

207
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:10.670
The difference between settlers,

208
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.400
is that where they write it down on a wall or is that list?
It's on a screen.
No,

209
00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:16.990
no,
no.
They put it up on a screen.
Like you're on stage,
you know,

210
00:12:16.991 --> 00:12:18.430
they introduce you,
you go out there,

211
00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:21.310
you say hi to everybody and then there's a little screen and on the screen is

212
00:12:21.311 --> 00:12:24.760
like,
he,
he had a great one.
It was a,

213
00:12:24.761 --> 00:12:29.130
I fuck the elderly so that you don't have to,
and he went to this great.
He is,

214
00:12:29.131 --> 00:12:33.030
he's right here.
This is another guy that's really hilarious thing about him.

215
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.680
You know,
he was working with Milton Berle back in the 20s.

216
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.870
That was his catch line.
He would say,

217
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:42.010
I fucked the elderly and the audience would go,
so you don't have to,

218
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.850
it was really funny man.
I really enjoyed it.
I really enjoyed it,
man.
It's uh,

219
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.220
you know,
I've,
I've heard about you for a while,
you know,

220
00:12:51.221 --> 00:12:52.840
so it was nice to meet you when we did that.

221
00:12:52.841 --> 00:12:55.240
I'm Ari Shapiro show or is not happening.

222
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.950
<v 2>You are very funny that evening as well.
Thank you very much.
That's true though.</v>

223
00:12:58.951 --> 00:12:59.450
It's true.

224
00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:00.660
<v 0>Oh,
thank you.
Yeah,</v>

225
00:13:00.661 --> 00:13:05.661
that's how I just a I love that there's still comics out there that I haven't

226
00:13:06.001 --> 00:13:09.420
met.
There's still hilarious.
Like I just still never met big Jay Oakerson.

227
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.840
He is hilarious.
Keep hearing great things about him that night.
Yeah.

228
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.920
I didn't get a chance to like sit down and talk to them.
Um,
and then,
uh,

229
00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:18.320
I didn't need,
um,

230
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.990
well I've met him but junior stopcock I never remember hung out with him.

231
00:13:21.991 --> 00:13:22.540
I need to hang out.

232
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.540
<v 2>That dude looks,
I'd never met him and he looks like a serial killer though.</v>

233
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.480
It looks awesome.
I love his look in a good way.

234
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.300
I hope you don't take offense junior.
Do you like the way serial killers look?

235
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.540
Yeah,
yeah.
Actually when I used to have it,
when I had a day job,
I was really,

236
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:35.980
I'm really in the serial killers.

237
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.370
I mean like I like to Google them and check out their vibes

238
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.450
and I,
I was at the,

239
00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.720
I worked in a cubicle for a while and I was googling serial killers and the way

240
00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:50.120
that it worked,
that was a sign language interpreter for a long time.
And uh,

241
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.560
the way that it would work,
because I would work at,

242
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.470
we work in a cubicle and I'd be somebody to cubicle over.

243
00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:56.880
You were interpreting over the Internet over webcams.
Wow.
This,

244
00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.400
this is a long story,
but if you needed help,
if you need backup,

245
00:14:00.401 --> 00:14:03.160
you would click a little button and then whoever was available would leave their

246
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.940
thing and come over to your cubicle,
sit with you,
help you translate.

247
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:09.760
Because sometimes the people would pop up,
wouldn't be easy to understand.

248
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:10.511
They'd be gnarled.

249
00:14:10.511 --> 00:14:14.110
They missing fingers or retarded or you would need some extra help.

250
00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.820
And so I just for like three hours had this like just computer monitor of like

251
00:14:18.821 --> 00:14:23.821
famous serial killers tab over Northern California serial killers tab over how

252
00:14:23.861 --> 00:14:27.820
do I become a serial killer tech now.
But anyway,
it was pretty popular.

253
00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:31.840
That's not good sleep.
And watching sent CNN all weekend,
I'm guessing.
What?
Oh,

254
00:14:31.841 --> 00:14:33.830
about homeboy.
Yeah.
This

255
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.910
<v 0>which you don't know homeboy is this kid and San Diego or in Santa Barbara or</v>

256
00:14:37.911 --> 00:14:39.780
rather one on a killing spree.

257
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.590
And didn't it wasn't he targeting women targeting like girls wouldn't have sex

258
00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:47.360
with them?
No,
I'm not going to lie.
I watched it.
It's pretty intense.

259
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:52.070
I want to get that guy's juice in my head.
Yeah.
You know,
there's,
I posted

260
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.730
<v 1>something on Twitter and I,
I should probably clarify after I posted it,</v>

261
00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:01.250
it was an article,
um,
about how many serial killers in mass shootings,

262
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.900
mass shooters have,
uh,
a history of psychiatric medication.

263
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.370
You know,
and it's,
it's,
it's staggering.
You know,

264
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.180
it's like something like more than 90% of all these,
uh,

265
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.380
mass killers are on Ssri or coming off of SSRS.

266
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:20.420
And,
um,
I,
I definitely don't think that the SSRS or killing people,

267
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.330
don't get me wrong,
I don't think that ssrs or bad for you,

268
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:27.590
and obviously I'm not qualified to judge.
Um,
I have zero medical background.

269
00:15:27.591 --> 00:15:29.150
I barely understand vitamins.

270
00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.400
I barely understand what the fuck I'm talking about.

271
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:36.470
But I think that you got to look at the possibility that something that makes

272
00:15:36.471 --> 00:15:38.900
everything okay for you.

273
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.280
It's also going to make everything okay as far as like your actions,

274
00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.510
like things that you do.

275
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.610
And I think if you have anger and you have psychotic thoughts and you have,

276
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:47.991
you know,

277
00:15:47.991 --> 00:15:51.470
a lot of like frustration at the world and something comes along that makes her

278
00:15:51.471 --> 00:15:52.700
actions.
Okay.

279
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.110
I think there's a lot of ways there's gotta be some sort of correlation there.

280
00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:59.180
I'm not saying that,
you know,

281
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.060
people should stop taking antidepressants because we both know guys who have

282
00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:05.360
taken it and it's fucking changed their life and all of a sudden they're cool to

283
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:07.700
be around.
They're like way happier.
I mean,

284
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.550
anything that makes you way happy I'm totally down for,

285
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.750
but these,
there is a connection.

286
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:19.730
It's pretty undeniable.
It's not,
it doesn't necessarily mean it's causal.

287
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.240
Like the taking the medication has caused these people to act in this way.

288
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:27.170
Not necessarily,
but I have a good friend that was murdered by someone who was on

289
00:16:27.171 --> 00:16:31.970
antidepressants,
you know,
so it's,
uh,
it's real shit.
I Dunno,

290
00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.270
<v 2>isn't it?
I mean,
isn't the idea it becomes a chicken or egg kind of conversation,</v>

291
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:38.490
right.
Because if you're crazy,
odds are,

292
00:16:38.491 --> 00:16:41.370
you're going to have been referred to take some Ssri.
Exactly.

293
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.620
Have you ever been on them?
No.
I have.
Yeah.

294
00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:47.640
When I was a kid and that was a very young,
when I was 1213 years old,
I was on,

295
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.450
that's how that seems really young.
It was real.
I was,
yeah,
it was a,

296
00:16:51.451 --> 00:16:54.420
it was a big mess,
but I felt it in a bad way,

297
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:57.900
sort of coursing through my body at all times.
I can definitely,

298
00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.230
you can feel when somebody,
when you know,

299
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:05.070
the finger of God is poking into your brain and kind of like mushing around and

300
00:17:05.071 --> 00:17:06.390
being like,
well,
maybe,
you know what I mean?

301
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:11.400
It's like you can feel your body like not responding or responding,
I think,

302
00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:14.730
you know what I mean?
Responding to the medication.
Why did they have you on it?

303
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.370
It's such a young age.
What was like a juvenile delinquent,
you know?

304
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.040
So I was like,
look like a fucking G.

305
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:24.060
I know the big swooping pompadour and shiny or I wouldn't trust you at all.

306
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:27.270
Yeah.
You know the classic,

307
00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:32.130
I'm unhappy youth with the big glasses and 1950s movie.
Yeah.
No,

308
00:17:32.131 --> 00:17:37.080
I mean I really,
I was,
I was a troubled kid.
Leather jacket.
Yeah,
no,

309
00:17:37.081 --> 00:17:41.880
I was,
uh,
I was in the jets.
What did you do that what you were troubled,

310
00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.370
so,
so much so that they wanted to put you on medication.
Well,

311
00:17:44.371 --> 00:17:47.280
this is actually why what we were talking about before,
like I,
oh,

312
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:50.190
I went to rehab when was like 13

313
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.320
<v 4>1213 years old.
I went to Reed,</v>

314
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.200
I was in and out of Rehab that whole time and I've,

315
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:57.750
and I got sober and I was 15 and I was on my way here listening to your episode

316
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.900
of with Aubrey de Grey,
the grey different one.
No,
that's a,

317
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.850
I'll read Marcus the Iot

318
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.210
<v 1>actually I've heard a great thing.
We've got to,</v>

319
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:10.160
there's videos of it online for folks who have been asking me about that.
Yeah.

320
00:18:10.161 --> 00:18:11.060
The,
the IOWASCA thing.

321
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.270
<v 4>I walk us.
Yeah.
So I,
I,</v>

322
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:17.100
it really made me think like every time I hear,
and I,
and I,

323
00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:22.101
I've known about your sort of philosophical bent towards the world as a r e

324
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.310
psychedelics are sort of,
you know,
a freedom,
lifesaver kind of thing.
It can be.

325
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:32.200
Yeah.
And I was thinking as a person that's been clean and sober that long,

326
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:35.900
it's been a long time.
Right.
How long have,
you know,
I'm 34 yeah.

327
00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.670
So 20 or 20 years.
Right.
So when I hear that kind of stuff,

328
00:18:39.671 --> 00:18:43.570
I think to myself like,
this is unfair that I'm not,

329
00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.470
that I have somehow put my little,

330
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.070
my life path has placed me in some sort of position where these sorts of things

331
00:18:49.071 --> 00:18:51.660
because I,
you know,
I was taking mushrooms and acid when I was 12 years old.
Not,

332
00:18:51.661 --> 00:18:54.340
not exactly the time when you're like looking for spiritual enlightenment.
Right.

333
00:18:54.341 --> 00:18:56.680
You were just trying to get fucked.
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh.

334
00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:01.240
Or a hand job or something like that.
Uh,
and I had listened to that dude.

335
00:19:01.241 --> 00:19:02.800
It's undeniable the truth of what he's,

336
00:19:02.801 --> 00:19:05.290
what he's saying like that he was having this enlightenment moment.

337
00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.420
It didn't sound like he went to Peru to party.

338
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:10.910
<v 1>No,
he's had several of those.
Uh,
it's changed him as a,
as a human.</v>

339
00:19:10.911 --> 00:19:12.420
It's made him brighter,
like,

340
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.540
like the feeling that you get when you're around them.

341
00:19:14.541 --> 00:19:18.170
I know that sounds ridiculous,
but it does happen to people.
Um,

342
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:22.460
everyone has this idea in their head that,
um,
if you are sober,

343
00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.770
if you're a sober person,
you've gone,
you know,

344
00:19:24.771 --> 00:19:28.640
x amount of years that you don't want to fall off the wagon and you don't want

345
00:19:28.641 --> 00:19:33.080
to get back to where you were.
And it's totally,
completely understandable.

346
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.190
I,
uh,

347
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:37.740
I've talked to many friends that have that same sort of feeling like they're,

348
00:19:37.741 --> 00:19:40.280
they're just like you.
They're like,
God,
I want to fucking try this.

349
00:19:40.281 --> 00:19:44.830
Like our friend Tate Tate,
he similar thing,
a key,

350
00:19:44.831 --> 00:19:49.270
he loved getting fucked up and he had an issue like,
oh,

351
00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:53.870
I know the Tate Fletcher and he would do it and he would just go off the rails.

352
00:19:53.871 --> 00:19:57.830
And so he's been sober for a long time,
long time.
He's very disciplined,

353
00:19:57.831 --> 00:20:01.580
very healthy.
So when he sees something like Iowasca and all these benefits of,

354
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.480
it's like damn mother fucker.
Like,
you don't want to take that leap.

355
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:09.080
Like what if you like,
ah,
I'll just try it once and I'll be okay.

356
00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:14.000
And then you're off on the fucking,
on the train through the woods.
No,
no rails.

357
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.751
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

358
00:20:14.751 --> 00:20:18.080
Because there's this like membrane when you were a person that doesn't do drugs

359
00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.970
or you're sober person.
Yeah.

360
00:20:19.971 --> 00:20:23.540
There's this membrane between you and the rest of the world and it's paper thin,

361
00:20:23.541 --> 00:20:26.630
but it keeps you on one side of the line.
Right.
You know what I mean?

362
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.330
Even though you can look on the other side of the line and Think,

363
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:33.410
oh well it would be fine to go to Peru or you know,
to go to,
you know,

364
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.510
some Iowasca ceremony and take,

365
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.450
if I could know that I would be doing that once I would go get enlightened

366
00:20:39.451 --> 00:20:43.280
mentor,
whatever.
It's waiting for me there.
Come back across the line and be fine.

367
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:48.490
But once you rip that membrane into you and whether it's truth or programming,

368
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:49.660
you feel like,

369
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.290
I don't know if I could trust myself to not just stay on the other side for

370
00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:53.820
everything.

371
00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.930
<v 0>That's interesting.
Have you ever,
um,</v>

372
00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:58.860
gone in for an operation or anything where they had to medicate you?

373
00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:03.170
<v 4>Yes.
Yeah.
What happens then?
I,
yeah,</v>

374
00:21:03.171 --> 00:21:06.300
I had my wisdom teeth out and I was put under and then I was taking,
um,

375
00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.470
well one of the,
one of the saddest parts of being a person that doesn't,

376
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:14.600
that is a sober is that when you take a,
you know,
when they give you painkillers,

377
00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:18.080
you take them as prescribed and if you take them as prescribed,

378
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.870
you really not going to get the fun part.
This is going to take away your pain.

379
00:21:20.871 --> 00:21:22.910
You're like,
fuck man,
I thought this was a free look.

380
00:21:22.911 --> 00:21:26.270
What kinds of they give you though?
I think I had um,
Vicodin.

381
00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:30.010
I got news for you pal.
Yeah,
they got your hi.
Oh,
you mean the membrane has,

382
00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:34.860
<v 0>yeah,
if he took Vicodin.
I don't care if you took it as prescribed,
you got high.</v>

383
00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.050
It didn't,
I don't remember feeling,
I mean,
dude,

384
00:21:37.051 --> 00:21:40.440
I would've loved it if that were true.
He just didn't get really high.
Yeah,

385
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.680
I didn't,
I didn't write down anything like Vicodin.
Let's try it.

386
00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.600
You'll have some ready.
Hold on.

387
00:21:48.601 --> 00:21:50.370
What does that tell you about leaving that shit here?

388
00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:53.100
I told you take it with you,
put it in your fucking pocket.

389
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.850
I do not want that shit here because if I tell the cops no,

390
00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.430
there's no viking in here and then they find Vicodin.

391
00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.560
I don't have a prescription for that shit around.

392
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.410
You do not have a prescription for anything.

393
00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.710
It was the last time you went to a fucking doctor.
Why didn't line up?

394
00:22:07.711 --> 00:22:09.890
I go to the dentist.
They'll have record of it.
Wait,

395
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.180
how many different drugs do you have that I just referenced one.

396
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.970
And you pulled out a bag within one second.
Oh you mean this stuff?

397
00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:16.830
It says four PS.
Four or five minutes.

398
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:20.130
Cause I just lucky doesn't have an office here.
If he had an office here,

399
00:22:20.131 --> 00:22:22.800
I'd have to fucking send dogs in there and once a month to see what's in there.

400
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.320
I didn't like it.
That's why I still have it.
They gave me a bottle of,

401
00:22:25.321 --> 00:22:27.720
I took two of them.
I was like fuck this shit.
See what I'm talking about?

402
00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:30.600
The membrane.
I didn't like it.
That's why I still have it.
That's the problem.

403
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.080
You find yourself saying things like,
I didn't like it.
That's why I kept it.

404
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.430
I wanted to make sure I had a close.

405
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.040
I think that's what they gave me when I had my first knee operation.

406
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:42.090
I took it and I hated it.
Yeah.
It just made me feel so stupid.

407
00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:45.870
It was either vicodins or what's the other one that,
uh,

408
00:22:45.871 --> 00:22:48.420
that people take that they actually say make some creative.

409
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:53.400
There's another painkiller,
like FICA and very calm and painkiller.
Oxy.
No,
no,

410
00:22:53.401 --> 00:22:57.960
no,
no.
What?
Percocet.
Percocet.
That,
yeah,

411
00:22:57.961 --> 00:23:01.980
it's either a,
it was either Viking into Percodan Percocet.
It was one of them,

412
00:23:01.981 --> 00:23:04.890
but it was bad,
whatever it was.
But I gave it to this guy at the pool hall.

413
00:23:04.891 --> 00:23:09.580
I sold it to him.
He was super happy.
Can we just like,
yeah,
you got these.
Like,

414
00:23:09.581 --> 00:23:13.800
it's like,
like some people just want to get dumb,
you know,

415
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.140
there was this blonde guys name was Jeff.
Hey,

416
00:23:16.141 --> 00:23:19.890
there's always had long greasy hair and he would wear a Jean jacket with cutoff

417
00:23:19.891 --> 00:23:24.120
sleeves guide.
Yeah.
And you know,
he's always hanging around the pool hall.

418
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.600
He was like a classic Dickinson's character,
you know,

419
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:31.260
if it was like,
you know,
1992,

420
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.280
which is when he was around,
but he was just classic,

421
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:40.050
like looked like he was a Leonard Skinner and fan back in their price.
Joe,

422
00:23:40.051 --> 00:23:43.770
you got some perks,
gross greasy mustache.

423
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.160
He's just crazy.
And he bought

424
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.850
<v 2>the perks.
He fuck,
Yay Joe.
Right on man.</v>

425
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:54.550
Fuck the pom.
Got them perks.
So you,

426
00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.110
even if you did do it,
whatever you did

427
00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.070
<v 1>do didn't get you fucked up enough.</v>

428
00:23:59.071 --> 00:24:02.520
Where you worried about falling back into who you were when you were 12.

429
00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:07.050
<v 2>Well,
the thing is,
what's interesting is about being in a sober person,</v>

430
00:24:07.051 --> 00:24:10.440
being in 12 step groups is that like,
and as a person who's now 34,

431
00:24:10.441 --> 00:24:12.510
I haven't been to a 12 step meeting on a long time,

432
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.460
but I still have a lot of that.
Uh,
uh,
it's sorta still the,
the,

433
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:20.060
the foundation of building blocks of a lot of my sort of moral code and

434
00:24:20.061 --> 00:24:24.840
personality.
Uh,
is that you,
you recognize?
I recognize looking back,

435
00:24:24.841 --> 00:24:28.290
like a lot of what I think about drugs is programming,
programming that I've,

436
00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:31.770
you know,
that I've tried on,
on purpose.
You know what I mean?

437
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:35.880
I've accepted willingly this kind of programming,
but on the other hand,
it's,

438
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.140
there's also realistic,
you know,
there's reality about it.
Like,
do you,

439
00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:43.920
do you be Aubrey or do you be Jeff from the pool hall?
Like,

440
00:24:43.921 --> 00:24:47.340
it's very difficult to know what's going to happen.
You don't know.
You know,

441
00:24:47.341 --> 00:24:51.300
you might,
you might be,
you know,
in the river of time and you might be,
you know,

442
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.360
uh,
at the dead show,
you know,
parking lot,

443
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:56.340
trying to fuck a 16 year old Hula Hooper.

444
00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:57.830
<v 1>Um,
you know,</v>

445
00:24:57.831 --> 00:25:02.831
I think we also have a lot of misconceptions about how drugs affect us and what

446
00:25:03.421 --> 00:25:07.400
would the addiction process is.
And I know I probably still do,

447
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:12.380
but I had this guy on the podcast name is Dr. Carl Hart and he's a fascinating

448
00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.140
character because you know,

449
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:18.560
he's had both real life experiences with drugs and you know,
he's,

450
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:23.420
he's a professor of psycho psychology and Psychiatry at Columbia.

451
00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:28.730
He's a super brilliant guy who wrote this book and um,
uh,

452
00:25:28.731 --> 00:25:32.570
his book is called high price and it's interesting,
the book is,

453
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:35.720
a lot of it is about the actual effects of drugs,

454
00:25:35.721 --> 00:25:40.440
his own life and his own personal personal situation.
Um,
the,

455
00:25:40.441 --> 00:25:44.870
the things that he's experienced personally but fascinating,

456
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:45.830
fascinating.

457
00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:49.520
When it comes to the aspect of like what are the actual mechanisms of addiction

458
00:25:49.521 --> 00:25:53.060
and what are the misconceptions and the misconceptions about the mechanisms of

459
00:25:53.061 --> 00:25:54.260
addiction are that,
you know,

460
00:25:54.261 --> 00:25:57.530
someone smokes crack and then all of a sudden they're addicted and he's like,

461
00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:02.330
that's not how it works.
And,
and being addicted itself and like coming off of it,

462
00:26:02.331 --> 00:26:05.630
it's like everyone makes it seem like cause it's horrible life or death thing

463
00:26:05.631 --> 00:26:07.190
and he's like,
have you had the flu?

464
00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.940
Well then you know what it's like to withdrawal.
That's all it is,

465
00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.870
<v 2>but there's,
there's like shit.
It's interesting though.
There's two different,</v>

466
00:26:13.871 --> 00:26:14.860
there's two aspects of it.

467
00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:17.980
There's the flu and then there was some kind of weird personality flaw that

468
00:26:17.981 --> 00:26:22.000
makes you really,
really unable to deal with having the flu.
You know what I mean?

469
00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:25.000
Like cause I,
I've helped people get off heroin and stuff and it's like,
yeah,

470
00:26:25.001 --> 00:26:28.060
this sucks,
but you're on heroin,
right?
Like it seems so obvious.

471
00:26:28.061 --> 00:26:30.730
Get through this horrible part.
You won't be on heroin anymore.

472
00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:36.140
Then I think that Flint and then they shoot fucking dope again and it's like

473
00:26:36.461 --> 00:26:40.210
what?
Logically if you're putting these things on this,
on a balance sheet,

474
00:26:40.211 --> 00:26:43.990
logically you're right.
It's just a fucking flute.
What we know,

475
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:44.970
and it's terrible for you,

476
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.830
but there's this other weird part where it is like you have the flu and there's

477
00:26:49.831 --> 00:26:52.800
a little voice going.
Like if you just press this button,

478
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:56.760
the flu will be gone immediately.
The flutes going to become,
I mean instantly,

479
00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.660
instantly.
So this like this little voice chipping away at your head.

480
00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:01.381
That's the issue.

481
00:27:01.381 --> 00:27:06.381
It's the voice more than it is the physical actual withdrawal symptoms.

482
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:07.411
Yeah,
no doubt.

483
00:27:07.411 --> 00:27:11.280
And also there's this thing that they talk about in 12 step groups,

484
00:27:11.281 --> 00:27:15.870
which is the strange mental blank spots.
You know.
So like when you look at the,

485
00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.720
you know,
you have a series of consequences,
you know,

486
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:22.440
that's built up as a result of being a drug addict or an alcoholic.
And then you,

487
00:27:22.441 --> 00:27:26.710
you know,
all of those things leading up to the,
you know,
the bottle,
you know,

488
00:27:26.711 --> 00:27:30.480
oh my wife left me,
I lost my job,
I've got hepatitis,
you know,

489
00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.640
and then the moment you look at a bag of heroin,

490
00:27:32.641 --> 00:27:37.530
you forget all of those for you have a,
uh,
an instant of consciousness,

491
00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.860
you know,
disappearing and you just forget all the consequences.

492
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:44.340
All you can think about is the relief that's in that little Baggie.

493
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.770
Do you think that a lot of what the 12 step program provides is like a structure

494
00:27:49.771 --> 00:27:51.210
and sort of like a discipline?

495
00:27:51.211 --> 00:27:54.270
And when you follow that structure and you follow a discipline,

496
00:27:54.271 --> 00:27:58.140
a lot of times you're like less likely to go off the rails because you have sort

497
00:27:58.141 --> 00:28:01.980
of an ethical,
you have like the standards ships supposed to apply,

498
00:28:01.981 --> 00:28:03.480
like accountability,
you know,

499
00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:06.120
like one of the things that I found really interesting about 12 step is that

500
00:28:06.121 --> 00:28:08.850
people that I've known that got sober,

501
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:12.420
one of the things it would have to do is go and find people that they had issues

502
00:28:12.421 --> 00:28:16.320
with and,
and apologize.
I was really just kind of fascinating.
You know,

503
00:28:16.321 --> 00:28:18.660
you talked to someone like,
you know,
so why'd you,
you know,

504
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.510
what made you compelled to go reach out to this person?
And you know,
their,

505
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:27.210
their idea behind it was that there's some psychic weight to all this stuff that

506
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.730
sort of weighs you down and makes you feel like you're not a good person.

507
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.350
And when you feel like you're not a good person,

508
00:28:31.351 --> 00:28:34.020
it makes it easier for you to do something that's not good for you.

509
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:37.230
I think that's right.
I think that the missing piece there,

510
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.400
I think that's 100% right.

511
00:28:38.401 --> 00:28:41.040
And then the missing piece there is that it's not even that it makes doing

512
00:28:41.041 --> 00:28:42.440
something that isn't good for you.
It's,

513
00:28:42.441 --> 00:28:45.540
it's something that can make you instantly forget about yourself.

514
00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:50.280
And that's the sort of weird cycle.
It's the moment that you get high or drink,

515
00:28:50.281 --> 00:28:52.920
then you stop thinking about all of the psychic weight that you've been carrying

516
00:28:52.921 --> 00:28:56.340
around with you.
So you feel a little bit lighter and freer.

517
00:28:56.670 --> 00:29:00.000
Unfortunately by being a drug addict and continuing to drink,

518
00:29:00.001 --> 00:29:02.350
you're creating more and more psychic weight,
your career,

519
00:29:02.351 --> 00:29:04.560
you're creating more and more damage in the wake of your life.

520
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.480
So you have to keep,
it's just horrible.
You know,
he donek treadmill of like,

521
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:14.450
you know,
trauma and relief.
So I,

522
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.730
yeah,
but I think the other thing that 12 step groups do,
and like I said,
I,

523
00:29:17.731 --> 00:29:20.220
it's been a long time for me that they,
they,

524
00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:24.330
they impose whether it's real or not,
they impose a value,

525
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.610
a life or death value to being sober.

526
00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:30.690
Where it's like we're engaged in this cosmic struggle.
You know,

527
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.470
you come to these meetings to find your other brethren that are also addicted.

528
00:29:34.471 --> 00:29:37.590
And then you'd go out and you help those brethren and then we're here in this,

529
00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.530
it's the most,
it's the primary.
Anybody who's active in,

530
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:44.350
in 12 step groups will say,
uh,
you know,

531
00:29:44.351 --> 00:29:48.190
the primary fact of my life is that I'm a sober guy.
And if you,

532
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:51.640
and that's it,
self perpetuated.
I don't think it's in a bad,

533
00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:55.090
I don't think that's a bad thing.
But when you leave a AA meetings,

534
00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:58.590
when you leave 12th step and you stopped going,
that value that,

535
00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:03.520
that sort of a cosmic buildup of what that means goes away.

536
00:30:03.521 --> 00:30:06.850
And then the reason that you're sober becomes,
it's just a good idea,

537
00:30:06.851 --> 00:30:10.390
which is a much less compelling reason to stay sober than I'm engaged in a

538
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:13.870
cosmic struggle to find my brother and,
and,
and save their lives.

539
00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:17.980
But on the flip side,
it makes you less annoying about it when you leave,

540
00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:21.770
when you,
the way you're describing it.
Yes.
By leaving it,
I'm less than,

541
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:25.990
it's a good idea as opposed to this life or death struggle because so many

542
00:30:25.991 --> 00:30:29.830
people that are sober,
they're like crossfitters.
It's all you ever fucking here.

543
00:30:29.831 --> 00:30:31.960
Out of him,
you know,
you told him doing crossfit,

544
00:30:31.961 --> 00:30:35.260
like I guess people that just start doing Jujitsu are guilty of it as well.

545
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.450
Everything,
every single thing,
everything.

546
00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.840
The newly converted person is the most annoying human being that exists across

547
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:47.530
the board,
across the board,
everything.
Guilty as charged.
Every,
all of us are.

548
00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.490
I think that you,
you know,
you get excited about something,

549
00:30:50.491 --> 00:30:53.350
it becomes a part of who you are and then you see the positive results of now

550
00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:54.220
you're sober.

551
00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:58.210
Now you don't have to wake up in the gutter covered in your own fucking throw up

552
00:30:58.211 --> 00:30:59.830
and just,
you know,
shit in your pants.

553
00:30:59.831 --> 00:31:03.140
And the problem with Jujitsu is you can't come to me and tell me,
Oh,

554
00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:06.460
I'm brother Jujitsu.
Save every year.
I'd be like,
oh,
that's a martial art.

555
00:31:06.461 --> 00:31:09.910
I don't have one.
It's like religion.
It can become like,
no,
no,
no.

556
00:31:09.911 --> 00:31:14.860
This is the answer.
All humans must learn the Anaconda choke or whatever.

557
00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:17.400
This,
this is the truth.
And it,

558
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:21.520
and that's the other thing also is like if someone had success for them,

559
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:25.810
they think this is the only way.
And that your way,
oh,
you're fucking,

560
00:31:25.811 --> 00:31:28.990
you're going down a bad road,
Marsha.
And what are you doing there with yoga?

561
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:33.010
You know,
Yoga is designed by devils.
It was originally by,
by demons.

562
00:31:33.011 --> 00:31:35.470
Demons gave it to people so they can convert them.
Well,

563
00:31:35.471 --> 00:31:36.520
that's actually what's interesting.

564
00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:39.360
Speaking of the SSRI thing is I remember when I was in,
uh,

565
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:42.100
when I was actively going to meetings,
uh,

566
00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:46.390
there was this sort of weird offshoot within Aa and it wasn't,
no,

567
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.670
there's no official sanctioning really,
and in Aa,
but there,

568
00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:54.130
there's sort of currents of thought and one of them would be to sort of

569
00:31:54.131 --> 00:31:59.131
passively dissuade people from using second psychiatric drugs in the name of

570
00:31:59.651 --> 00:32:00.484
sobriety.

571
00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:05.200
So you'd have these people coming in that were clearly very disturbed people and

572
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:08.890
up some plumber going,
oh,
we don't do that here.
We don't,

573
00:32:08.891 --> 00:32:12.780
we don't take those drugs here.
Was it?
It was like,
oh,
are you a psychiatrist?

574
00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:17.670
Toughen up.
Yeah.
No,
I'm a plumber and I know what I'm talking about.
Norm.

575
00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:21.820
You stop listening to them.
I got a voice that me all kinds of shit.

576
00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:24.190
Let me just stop you right now.
I'm not going to do it.
That it's,
yeah,
no,

577
00:32:24.191 --> 00:32:27.130
it's more like I don't have a voice so you don't need a voice.
Okay,

578
00:32:27.131 --> 00:32:30.280
let's move on.
Yeah.
People who are,

579
00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:34.990
who like sobriety,
you know,
and,
and,
and our end of that world,

580
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.020
they have a real hard time believing that you could go out and have a drink.

581
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:40.010
Like there was a,
a,
a guy who

582
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:44.420
<v 1>used to own the Tempe Improv and he was sober guy and like super,</v>

583
00:32:44.421 --> 00:32:49.070
super sober to the point where they lied and made up a rule about the stage.

584
00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:54.290
And they said Comedians can't drink on stage because it's a state law.
Not True.

585
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:57.140
Not True at all.
That's not right.
Yeah.
And so,
you know,

586
00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:59.390
there's like a sign there that they have in the,

587
00:32:59.391 --> 00:33:03.410
in the green room talking about how as a state law and then we found out that it

588
00:33:03.411 --> 00:33:06.590
was bullshit.
So we found that it was bullshit and we started,

589
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:11.800
we brought a flask on stage once the store and it was Brian's idea to go to a

590
00:33:11.991 --> 00:33:13.190
liquor store and get a flat.

591
00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:16.340
So I had a flask on stage and I was explaining to the audience that I was just

592
00:33:16.341 --> 00:33:19.190
pouring warm diet coke and in my cold diet coke,

593
00:33:19.191 --> 00:33:22.930
because I sort of a medium diet coke or it's you've got a regular heat

594
00:33:22.931 --> 00:33:27.931
temperature to warm diet coke and a flask that's next to my butt heats it up.

595
00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:32.390
But this guy was,
he would,
you would go to take a drink before you go on stage.

596
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:34.130
Like,
uh,
can I get a shot?
You know,

597
00:33:34.131 --> 00:33:35.900
you go to the bar and you're paying for it too.

598
00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.200
I pay for it and I'm not asking you for free.
I always pay for it.

599
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:43.220
I give the bartender money,
I want,
you know,
I'm not,
I'm not trying to get,

600
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:46.820
so the point is I get this shot and you know,
the,

601
00:33:46.821 --> 00:33:50.000
the owners like shaking his head like upset that the bartender gave it to me.

602
00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:54.320
We have to have this conversation.
Like,
I'll do it.
It's a shot.
It's one shot.

603
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.590
I'm going to go on stage.
I know what I'm doing.
Like,
trust me,
I'm not,

604
00:33:57.591 --> 00:34:00.920
I'm not a drunk.
I'm not out of control.
I'm a professional comedian,

605
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:04.100
I'm going to have a drink and then I'm going to go do all this material that had

606
00:34:04.101 --> 00:34:05.540
been working on for a long fucking time.

607
00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.390
Like this isn't like some reckless endeavor.

608
00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:12.860
I'm going to fucking throw caution to the wind.
Throw one back,
Bang,

609
00:34:12.861 --> 00:34:16.880
a fucking shot of heroin or morphine depository,

610
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:17.873
<v 2>my asshole.</v>

611
00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.350
You go pository going from red band over there and these guys calling ready?

612
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:24.690
Well,
they have those morphine suppository.
He's supposed to be incredible.

613
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:27.620
You know you're the only the comedian that drinks alcohol.
I am.

614
00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:30.570
You're the only one.
So that's why he was so shocked.
Sense.
I'm sorry,

615
00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:34.080
near the AOL of drinking comedians.

616
00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:37.290
It's just so fucking stupid that a guy would say you got a room full of people

617
00:34:37.291 --> 00:34:37.831
that are drinking.

618
00:34:37.831 --> 00:34:41.090
You're selling them booze and you don't want me to have a shot before I go on

619
00:34:41.091 --> 00:34:45.060
stage.
Evangelism of any,
any kind of evangelism is the,
is the enemy.

620
00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.720
Unless you really

621
00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.890
<v 1>do know something.</v>

622
00:34:47.891 --> 00:34:50.410
Could you imagine if you really did find the fountain of Youth?

623
00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:54.820
If you very frustrated,
you're are old and fucked up being jumped in,
boom.

624
00:34:54.821 --> 00:34:55.271
He came out,

625
00:34:55.271 --> 00:34:57.550
you're 20 years old and you're running to all these people and they're like,

626
00:34:57.551 --> 00:35:01.780
get the fuck away from me.
You crazy ass.
Well,
you're not 60 you're fucking 20

627
00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:08.220
<v 2>I've found the truth.
That's how they all feel like.</v>

628
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:12.400
Just be so aware of sobers.
Awesome.
It's interesting,
isn't it?

629
00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:15.030
If you've ever been to Jerusalem and Jerusalem,

630
00:35:15.031 --> 00:35:19.590
there's this thing where people move there to go blues their mind.
Oh,

631
00:35:19.591 --> 00:35:21.480
Jerusalem Syndrome go there.

632
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:24.510
I don't know if they go get on an airplane thinking they're the Messiah or if

633
00:35:24.511 --> 00:35:28.260
they go there with those latent seeds of like with a moment I walk into

634
00:35:28.261 --> 00:35:29.400
Jerusalem,
I'm going to lose my mind,

635
00:35:29.401 --> 00:35:33.630
but you will walk around the Old City of Jerusalem and they will be nine or 10

636
00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:36.990
Messiah's there who are American and I was,

637
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.900
what a crazy coincidence that you well that is great.

638
00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:45.430
<v 0>I love that.
I fucking love that.
That's pretty hot.
It's pretty amazing.</v>

639
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:50.080
That exists.
There was a vice special about it recently.
Oh really?

640
00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:54.700
The HBO show,
they followed all these people that went to Jerusalem,

641
00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.880
whacked out Americans with southern accents.

642
00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:02.260
You just going into tongues and reading from scripture and,
oh,

643
00:36:02.261 --> 00:36:06.190
that was about the American evangelical evangelical supporting the State of

644
00:36:06.191 --> 00:36:08.080
Israel.
I did see that.
Yeah.
Yeah,

645
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.950
that's and who go over there and just go bananas.
Not as far.
I mean,
they weren't,

646
00:36:11.951 --> 00:36:15.190
I don't think there was any messiah's on that show,
but yeah,
no,

647
00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:17.740
I saw their level,
all of the same nonsense.

648
00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:20.850
That's a much more subtle version of Jerusalem.
That's right.

649
00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:22.380
I think there was a cover of,

650
00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:26.110
I think that was a title of one of Mark Marin's book.
It was,
yeah.
Yeah.

651
00:36:26.111 --> 00:36:28.630
He had like a one man show he was doing about that.

652
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.710
Probably based on themselves a little bit like,
right.

653
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:36.670
I have the book at home actually.
Mark,
if you're listening we say hello.
Hello?

654
00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.120
Yeah,
I think it was a,
I think it was supposed to be really funny book.

655
00:36:40.121 --> 00:36:43.120
I never got around to reading it,
but I heard good things.
I mean,
he's good.

656
00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:47.650
The guy's good.
That's what I'm saying.
So when you got out,

657
00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:52.390
how long did you stay in treatment before you decided to be this guy who's just

658
00:36:52.391 --> 00:36:53.890
sober?
Because it's a good idea.

659
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:54.901
<v 2>Oh,</v>

660
00:36:54.901 --> 00:36:57.810
you mean how long have I been in my current iteration of what it means to be a

661
00:36:57.811 --> 00:36:58.890
person that doesn't do drugs

662
00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.010
<v 0>without,
yeah.
Without the 12 step ideology attached to it.</v>

663
00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:05.250
Like how long have you been free of going to meetings and all that stuff?
Oh,

664
00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.093
free.

665
00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:11.220
<v 2>All,
all your silver listeners.
It's a Tupac lyric.</v>

666
00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:16.060
You know,
I first,
when I first went clear,
um,
no,

667
00:37:16.061 --> 00:37:19.240
I stopped funding meeting.
I don't know.

668
00:37:19.241 --> 00:37:23.230
I had a weird experience because I got sober so incredibly young.
I was,
I was 15.

669
00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.770
You haven't talked to in Norton about that?
Uh,
no,
no,
no.
Get sober.
Really Young.

670
00:37:27.771 --> 00:37:30.700
No similar.
Yeah,
I think he was like 18 or 19.
Right.

671
00:37:30.701 --> 00:37:35.440
So the whole group of people I was with was like the were 15,
16,
17,
18 in fact,

672
00:37:35.441 --> 00:37:40.150
that was like the youngest guy that got sober in where in Oakland,

673
00:37:40.151 --> 00:37:40.601
where I'm from.

674
00:37:40.601 --> 00:37:43.660
But there was this whole circle of kids that got sober at the same time.

675
00:37:43.661 --> 00:37:45.390
We all kind of hung out and you know,

676
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:48.880
made this kind of social reality with each other.
And then one by one of course,

677
00:37:48.881 --> 00:37:52.390
they all got older and started to think very reasonably well,

678
00:37:52.391 --> 00:37:57.040
that was probably a phase,
right?
What am I doing here?
This is 10 years later,

679
00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:01.030
I'm 28 years old.
I've been sober 10 years,
like how the hell do I even,
you know,

680
00:38:01.031 --> 00:38:04.800
I didn't know how to date people.
I didn't know how to fuck people.
I did.

681
00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.600
<v 0>If you had to go back to you,</v>

682
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:12.300
if you had to be weekly meetings in order to caress the personality that you

683
00:38:12.301 --> 00:38:13.800
were developing when you were in high school,

684
00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:17.970
like who you define yourself as and it was based on who you were in high school.

685
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:22.890
<v 2>That's exactly right.
There are so undeveloped.
Nothing about me is true.</v>

686
00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:27.030
That was true.
Then today,
and then there's this kernel that you hold on to,

687
00:38:27.031 --> 00:38:29.340
which is this idea that you're a person that needs to be sober,

688
00:38:29.341 --> 00:38:33.150
that that's where things get a little bit hazy and Wonky,
so one by one.

689
00:38:33.151 --> 00:38:37.300
All of those people that I got sober with started to started drinking again.

690
00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:42.180
We started getting high again and then you go,
well now I'm 34 years old.

691
00:38:42.181 --> 00:38:44.410
I've been sober 20 years.
I don't know.

692
00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:47.020
I couldn't honestly tell you it was or wasn't a phase.

693
00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:50.620
But I also couldn't honestly tell you if I started getting high again that I

694
00:38:50.621 --> 00:38:52.120
wouldn't fucking just pull the,

695
00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:56.140
the slowly pull the plug on the stability of what I've got.

696
00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.650
<v 1>Hey,
I see.
This is where I think that for a lot of folks,</v>

697
00:38:59.651 --> 00:39:02.500
especially like you who's a pretty rational guy,

698
00:39:02.501 --> 00:39:05.920
obviously you know we're having a normal conversation.
You know what I'm saying?

699
00:39:05.921 --> 00:39:09.640
Anything Nutty,
I'm pretty sure you're on the ball.
You're successful comedian,

700
00:39:09.641 --> 00:39:11.860
you're well regarded.
He got a lot of good things going on.

701
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.370
I don't see you with destructive behavior anywhere else.

702
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.580
So it becomes in what is making it so destructive?

703
00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:23.640
I mean is it because it just some genetic component of your body that when takes

704
00:39:24.791 --> 00:39:29.650
in some sort of a mind altering substance,
it just goes nutty?
I mean,
I have,

705
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:33.130
I don't know the answer to that because like north it,
Martin is a good example.

706
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:37.300
I love that guy.
He's awesome.
But Norton is clearly crazy and good ways,

707
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:38.950
and it's one of the reasons why he's so hilarious,

708
00:39:38.951 --> 00:39:42.640
but he's a complete total sex addict.
Right.
Super Open about it.

709
00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.320
So we all are,
well,
he's in a different league.
No,
no,

710
00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:50.020
I'm not saying I'm on Norton level.
He takes it to another leg.
He's like,
yeah,

711
00:39:50.021 --> 00:39:54.820
he's like the Michael Jordan of,
of functional perverts.
So he,
um,

712
00:39:55.930 --> 00:40:00.420
he's obviously got that personality.
He's got that maniac that,
I mean it's,

713
00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.380
it's so common and Comedians,

714
00:40:02.381 --> 00:40:07.270
it's almost like if you see your kid and he's kind of crazy and super impulsive

715
00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:11.440
and doing dangerous shit,
start steering them towards stand up,
you know?
Right,

716
00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:12.341
right.
You know,
I mean,

717
00:40:12.341 --> 00:40:16.630
this is the one thing where you can actually have a healthy human being can

718
00:40:16.631 --> 00:40:21.320
develop out of this very bizarre personality trait.
Because,
I mean,
even myself,

719
00:40:21.321 --> 00:40:21.510
if I,

720
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:26.510
if I had gotten stuck and some sort of a job that I didn't agree to,

721
00:40:26.561 --> 00:40:27.400
I didn't enjoy,

722
00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:30.940
but I needed the money and then I got a mortgage or a family and then I'm

723
00:40:30.941 --> 00:40:32.050
trapped and I'm stuck in there.

724
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:37.180
I would for sure be some sort of off the rails junkie for sure.
I just,

725
00:40:37.181 --> 00:40:40.270
I'm impulsive,
I'm very impulsive and uh,
and,
and I,

726
00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.490
I'm capable of making terrible decisions,

727
00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:46.780
but I keep it all in check and I keep it all in check through working out and I

728
00:40:46.781 --> 00:40:51.781
keep it all in check through having the kind of paths like for like for hobbies

729
00:40:52.781 --> 00:40:54.460
and for,
for things that I enjoy doing,

730
00:40:54.461 --> 00:40:57.400
like standup career stuff where they're wild,

731
00:40:57.401 --> 00:41:01.210
crazy things where it's okay to be nutty,
you know,
and being nutty.

732
00:41:01.211 --> 00:41:02.290
There's actually a benefit.

733
00:41:02.291 --> 00:41:06.010
You could be kind of more creative and you come up with these things that a lot

734
00:41:06.011 --> 00:41:09.310
of people would never say,
but they find hilarious.
Like you find a path for,

735
00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.230
I like Joey Diaz,
another perfect example.

736
00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:16.090
Always had mad struggles with drugs his whole life.
He's completely impulsive,

737
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:19.610
you know,
he's,
he's like,
I'm on a diet,
I'm on this new thing.
What's that sec?

738
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:22.690
Give me that fucking sandwich and just fucking take your meatball sub and just

739
00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:25.870
slam it down.
Like,
what happened?
He died.
Fuck that diet and fucking mother,

740
00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:29.770
you know,
he'll just,
he just gone,
it'll go off the rails,
you know,

741
00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:34.070
but you're not,
you don't seem to be off the rails kind of guy.

742
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:37.220
<v 2>Well,
I mean,
I think that I present,
I don't think I,</v>

743
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:39.790
I'm not disagreeing or agreeing with you.
I don't,
I,
I present,

744
00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:43.510
I think better than I present.
Well,
right.
I,
I have my neurosis,

745
00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.500
my clear neurosis.
I've,
you know,

746
00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:49.780
and I've certainly struggled with sex stuff a lot.

747
00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:53.030
<v 1>Okay.
Do,
do,
do,
do,
do,
do,</v>

748
00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:56.170
<v 2>is that the struggle with sex stuff?
That's the,
uh,</v>

749
00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:01.120
either you're getting high or the struggle was what everybody has.
No,

750
00:42:01.121 --> 00:42:03.970
of course.
I mean,
it's a whole mind fuck.
And the other thing is that,

751
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:08.500
what is the drug that they say rearranges the addictive process and your brain

752
00:42:08.501 --> 00:42:12.730
anyway,
it's a psychedelic as well.
The Boga that ebook.
So it's like,

753
00:42:12.731 --> 00:42:13.630
who even knows?

754
00:42:13.631 --> 00:42:16.840
Maybe you have the membrane gets ripped wide open and you come through the,

755
00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:20.860
you know,
the other side of completely different person with a different process.

756
00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:25.160
<v 1>What would I begin?
Does.
I haven't done it.
But what I began does,
uh,</v>

757
00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:27.430
according to the people that have is,

758
00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:31.840
it sort of shows you every aspect of your personality and what's causing all

759
00:42:31.841 --> 00:42:35.890
these different behavior patterns,
whether it's self destructive behavior,

760
00:42:35.891 --> 00:42:38.380
whether it's self loathing behavior,

761
00:42:38.381 --> 00:42:41.020
whether it's a anxiety in security.

762
00:42:41.021 --> 00:42:44.110
The root of it all is kind of explained to you in a very unusual and unique way.

763
00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:49.510
So it's not like dimethyltryptamine is the active ingredient and Iowasca and the

764
00:42:49.511 --> 00:42:51.100
people that go on the high of Wasc or retreats,

765
00:42:51.101 --> 00:42:56.101
what they experienced is the very chemical that is responsible for divine

766
00:42:57.550 --> 00:43:00.520
feelings,
for,
for dreams,

767
00:43:00.521 --> 00:43:04.600
for probably for near death experiences.
It's your,

768
00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:08.170
it's released in the mind.
It's released in the brain,

769
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:11.710
in its released through this gland that's literally your third eye.

770
00:43:11.711 --> 00:43:14.530
It sits in the middle of your brain and eastern mysticism.

771
00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:17.260
All those pictures of the enlightened ones,
the glowing third eye,

772
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:19.090
that's the pineal gland.
You know,

773
00:43:19.091 --> 00:43:23.290
they know for a fact that DMT is being produced there in live mice.

774
00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:27.280
So it's most likely DMT is being proved there and human beings.

775
00:43:27.281 --> 00:43:30.880
And the theory is that when you take any of these drugs,

776
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:33.910
like when it's what it's like a swastika or whether it's a,

777
00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:38.940
what it does is allow you to stop being you for a while and see the whole wiring

778
00:43:39.941 --> 00:43:43.540
under the board,
see all the,
the microcosm,

779
00:43:43.541 --> 00:43:47.470
the fractal nature of the universe itself and see it in a way that's absolutely

780
00:43:47.471 --> 00:43:51.670
impossible.
I began doesn't do that.
I'm again shows you you,

781
00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:57.030
it shows you you in like this really harsh and unusual way where it just shows

782
00:43:58.991 --> 00:44:03.130
you like almost a mathematical components of all the various things that have

783
00:44:03.131 --> 00:44:05.650
gone wrong in your life and why they're leading up to this.

784
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:10.630
And then on top of that,
it rewires your whole addictive mechanism in your mind.

785
00:44:10.631 --> 00:44:15.010
It's very trippy stuff because there was the success rate rather for people

786
00:44:15.011 --> 00:44:18.640
who've done it with addictions is astronomical.
I mean it's huge.

787
00:44:18.641 --> 00:44:21.280
It's like way more than 50% right?

788
00:44:21.281 --> 00:44:25.420
Way more than 50% of the people that go there and do it.
Never do drugs again.

789
00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:28.000
Heroine addicts,
pill heads,
all these people.

790
00:44:28.001 --> 00:44:31.290
I had a friend who did it and he was so powerful that he opened up a retreat

791
00:44:31.291 --> 00:44:34.680
down there.
My friend Ed clay,
it's got a retreat and do retreat in Mexico.

792
00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:38.790
<v 2>Yeah,
that's the complicated thing about like just to poke back on the,</v>

793
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:40.380
on the Io Osca idea.

794
00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:44.940
How do you know that what you're experiencing is true enlightenment?

795
00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:47.720
I mean these are hallucinations.
Sure.
So like in,

796
00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.060
on what level can you trust the hallucination?
Like

797
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:54.060
<v 1>it's a very good question.
Here's my take on it.
You know,
it's,</v>

798
00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.180
it's something that people always worry about.
Like say if you do a drug,

799
00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:03.410
that drug takes you to the divine consciousness at the center of everything.

800
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:07.590
And this divine consciousness explains to you that the insecurities of your

801
00:45:07.591 --> 00:45:11.880
being and all this madness that you're experiencing in your life is really just

802
00:45:11.881 --> 00:45:14.520
your biological mechanisms.
This,

803
00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:19.170
the remnants of the monkey body that have had to run from predators your entire

804
00:45:19.171 --> 00:45:19.501
life.

805
00:45:19.501 --> 00:45:24.450
And all this savagery is still entwined in the very DNA that causes your cells

806
00:45:24.451 --> 00:45:28.040
to duplicate.
Like it's,
it's almost unavoidable.

807
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:31.170
And then you have to find peace through love.

808
00:45:31.171 --> 00:45:33.750
And you have to find the center of this and you come out of that experience like

809
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:36.870
blown away.
You just had a conversation with God.
You just,

810
00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:40.310
you've learned about yourself,
you're a happier,
more relaxed person,

811
00:45:40.311 --> 00:45:44.370
your anxiety's gone.
You see the finish line,
you see something over the cross,

812
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:46.830
the boundary between life and death.

813
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:51.720
Whether or not that actually happened or whether it was a complete total

814
00:45:51.721 --> 00:45:54.220
hallucination.
It's the same experience,
right?

815
00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:57.850
The experience is exactly the same and it's,
it's,
it's,

816
00:45:57.851 --> 00:46:01.260
it's a foolish thing to wonder about if it's beneficial.

817
00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:03.000
If you really do have that experience.

818
00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:07.140
Was it a who says what did the fuck is a hallucination?
That's,
how about that?

819
00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:10.110
How about what is seeing something that's not there?
What are you saying?

820
00:46:10.111 --> 00:46:10.890
It's not there.

821
00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:14.640
You're seeing it like it's not there because you can't put it in a bag and take

822
00:46:14.641 --> 00:46:15.150
it home

823
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:17.220
<v 2>and other chemicals sitting in your brain anyway.</v>

824
00:46:17.221 --> 00:46:20.370
Then it is their whatever chemical makes you see things.
Exactly.

825
00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.250
And light is just as much a hallucination created by your brain.

826
00:46:23.251 --> 00:46:26.490
There's anything else is right.
It's a different state of consciousness.

827
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:30.150
But like the,
you know,
the,
the,
uh,
the classic image of the person on acid,

828
00:46:30.151 --> 00:46:32.250
like writing down his thoughts.
He's like,
oh,

829
00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.670
I had this crazy enlightenment last night.
You have to come see,

830
00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.110
and the opens up his diary and it's just like,
be cool bro.

831
00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:42.440
<v 1>No.
Could it be that simple?
Well,</v>

832
00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:46.810
there's also the issue of the words that we use to describe reality itself were

833
00:46:46.811 --> 00:46:50.410
created in this state of consciousness and the state of consciousness that you

834
00:46:50.411 --> 00:46:55.000
experience when you're in any sort of an intense psychedelic state is so bizarre

835
00:46:55.001 --> 00:46:59.290
and alien that the word that we use to reference things and in this state,

836
00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:02.010
they're not effective enough.
They're just,
they're not you,

837
00:47:02.011 --> 00:47:07.011
you can't dis McKenna used to describe a Terrence from Kenny's described DMT

838
00:47:07.931 --> 00:47:12.160
experiences as self transforming machine elves.

839
00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:16.150
You know,
and the first time I did it,
I remember thinking,

840
00:47:16.151 --> 00:47:19.420
how the fuck did he get self transforming machine elves out of this?

841
00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:23.590
Because it didn't seem like that to me at all.
But it's because the,
it's silly.

842
00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:24.940
The words don't work.

843
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:28.750
It's like what it is is so fucking alien that you can't describe it.

844
00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:30.250
The closest thing you can do

845
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.910
<v 0>is look at an Alex great painting.
You know,</v>

846
00:47:32.911 --> 00:47:36.130
the Alex Grey has all this amazing intense psychedelic art.

847
00:47:36.131 --> 00:47:39.430
Like Brian pull up one of those Alex Gray paintings.
He has these intense,

848
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:43.030
intense tryptamine inspired,
uh,

849
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:45.970
artistic renderings,
paintings and such.

850
00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:50.320
Those are probably the closest thing you'll ever get.
And even those,
yeah,

851
00:47:50.321 --> 00:47:53.860
he did this big old,
the installation at burning man a couple of years ago.

852
00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:58.900
It was just this huge dome that was all Alex Gray paintings and him presenting

853
00:47:58.901 --> 00:48:01.380
like every night.
Yeah.
Like this.
Yeah,
exactly.

854
00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:06.420
That is a perfect example of a trip to mean based experience that's put in some

855
00:48:07.931 --> 00:48:11.950
sort of a painting and it's unbelievably beautiful and fantastic and all that.

856
00:48:11.951 --> 00:48:14.730
But it still falls way short of the actual experience was,
do you know,

857
00:48:14.731 --> 00:48:15.400
it's interesting,

858
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:19.270
I'm looking at this as a person that's been sober for 20 years but has done

859
00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:21.890
psychedelics and how even though I was so young,
they were so,

860
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.270
they were definitely a,
a fundamental part of my development.

861
00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:29.050
I still relate to this kind of imagery.
You will.

862
00:48:29.051 --> 00:48:31.570
That is probably because it's part of your dreams.

863
00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:33.490
You're experiencing that at night.

864
00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:36.520
They don't know what we're experiencing during dreams.
Just a lot of,

865
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:38.820
a lot of guesswork about that.
But they're,

866
00:48:38.821 --> 00:48:42.950
they're trying to do more detailed studies on the effects of dimethyltryptamine

867
00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:47.400
in dreams.
I'm mostly having sex with my mom.
Oh Shit.
You,
it must be hot.

868
00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.790
She's very hot.
And that was where you were.

869
00:48:49.791 --> 00:48:52.090
You were looking for the diabolical part of my personality.

870
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:55.170
I'm just incredibly attracted to my mom.
He just a motherfucker.

871
00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:59.710
I'm just this spray motherfucker.
Well,
as long as your mom's into it too.

872
00:48:59.711 --> 00:49:01.660
I really don't see what anything's wrong with that.
Well,
let's find out.

873
00:49:01.661 --> 00:49:02.494
She's a listener.

874
00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:08.160
<v 2>She's not a listener.
She's deaf</v>

875
00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:15.510
comedy mode.
Can you tell she's really deaf.
Oh No,
no,
I'm not.

876
00:49:15.511 --> 00:49:18.600
Instead of company mode,
my mom's death,
she really is,

877
00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.930
<v 0>can say anything you want to about your mom.
I can't,</v>

878
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:22.860
you can have as long as your eventual,

879
00:49:22.861 --> 00:49:25.630
cause she could talk our icons of mad shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.

880
00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:28.230
Or just put your hand over your mouth.
We used to do that.
Well,

881
00:49:28.231 --> 00:49:30.690
my mom would say something we would just like on the brush our mouth and just be

882
00:49:30.691 --> 00:49:32.560
like,
fuck you bitch.
Yeah.

883
00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:37.020
She probably could sense the vibrations coming off silverware and stuff so she

884
00:49:37.021 --> 00:49:40.470
could sense the psychic vibrations.
It'd be like,
fuck you bitch.

885
00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:43.500
She would sign it though.
But real hood,
you know,
monkeys,

886
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:47.790
monkeys will fuck each other like crazy.
Like especially like,
um,

887
00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.160
but no nobos Banabos we'll fuck everything.

888
00:49:50.161 --> 00:49:53.690
But the mother will never fuck the sun.
Right.
That's the only taboo.
Yeah.

889
00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:55.500
So the father will fuck the daughter.

890
00:49:55.900 --> 00:50:00.270
The mother won't fuck the sun and that is the primary pain of my life.

891
00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:04.150
<v 2>But I've been running from this whole time.
That's why I went to Rehab.</v>

892
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:08.460
That's why I want to do Ibogaine.
Make sense?
Do I want to meet my mother?
The

893
00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:13.160
<v 0>psychedelic landscape?
Well,
one thing about Ibogaine is it's supposed to be like,</v>

894
00:50:13.161 --> 00:50:17.810
really it's so gross that no one ever wants to do it again other than to try to

895
00:50:17.811 --> 00:50:21.830
heal themselves.
Right.
Never the hard way about being recreational.
Right.

896
00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:25.490
They say that about DMT as well.
That's true.
And I,

897
00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:28.600
and I think that when I think about a iosco

898
00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:32.720
<v 4>or DMT or I guess at the same sort of,
or,</v>

899
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:35.970
or I began,
I don't know,
I that just seems to medicinal from you.

900
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:37.940
It's not that I think,
oh,

901
00:50:37.941 --> 00:50:41.120
I'm going to go start partying on Iowasca every weekend.
It's that,

902
00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.770
like I said that when,
once that,

903
00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.580
I think the Iowasca trip would be positive no matter what.

904
00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:50.510
But once you take away that line between you and a person that doesn't get high,

905
00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:55.100
then it's gone.
Yeah.
I guess you'd have to figure that out yourself.
Yeah.

906
00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:59.740
<v 1>Thing anybody could ever tell you.
Yeah.
I mean,
what can they do?</v>

907
00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:04.630
I was just hoping you could,
well,
I've never had a drug problem,
so I don't,

908
00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.960
you know,
a lot of people will tell me I'm wrong and I'm lying.

909
00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:12.770
You wrote drugs road,
no Hippie,
you go to fucking drug problem.
Uh,

910
00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:17.060
I just like substances them never been an issue with me.
Never been in shoot.

911
00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:21.640
Like I had to do it.
Like I've not smoked weed for weeks at a time.

912
00:51:21.641 --> 00:51:24.730
It hasn't bothered me drinking.
It doesn't bother me at all.
I never,

913
00:51:24.731 --> 00:51:27.790
never crave week drinking.
But according to Carl Hart,

914
00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:32.240
all our ideas about like addictions and cravings and stuff like that,
it's,

915
00:51:32.410 --> 00:51:35.440
it's way more psychological than it is physical.

916
00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:38.010
And that when you feel hung over,

917
00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:41.380
like that feeling that you have when you drink and then you're fucked up and

918
00:51:41.381 --> 00:51:44.050
then [inaudible] morning you're in pain,
he goes,

919
00:51:44.051 --> 00:51:46.990
you are experiencing alcohol withdrawals.

920
00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:50.230
Like you're experiencing them right there.
That is what being hung over his.

921
00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:53.380
So this idea that you're addicted to alcohol because you have this honey

922
00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:56.920
hangover,
these withdrawals,
and then you know you can't kick it.

923
00:51:56.921 --> 00:51:59.770
And then in the future you're addicted again.
Like you're addicted right away.

924
00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:02.520
It's just these compensatory mechanisms.
So there was,

925
00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.730
there's a responsible for all that horrible feeling,

926
00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:05.800
the headache and all that stuff.

927
00:52:06.130 --> 00:52:09.100
It's the compensatory mechanisms where they're trying to compensate for the fact

928
00:52:09.101 --> 00:52:11.320
that you've poured this poisons alcohol in your body,

929
00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:13.030
so your body is like raging against it.

930
00:52:13.031 --> 00:52:16.180
And it sort of adjusting all the levels and then there's no more alcohol and

931
00:52:16.181 --> 00:52:21.010
it's like,
that's half of why you feel like shit.
Oh,
that's fascinating,
isn't it?

932
00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:24.220
<v 4>So everybody that's hung over as an alcoholic for an hour and a half.</v>

933
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:28.700
<v 1>Well,
alcoholic is a weird word.
You know,
being addicted to alcohol,</v>

934
00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:32.100
you know what it,
whatever it is,
whatever addiction is,
you know,

935
00:52:32.101 --> 00:52:34.850
and so it's the whole state is very strange.

936
00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:38.660
The idea that you have a substance that becomes so much of a part of your

937
00:52:38.661 --> 00:52:41.900
everyday life that even though it's bad for you,
you need to put it in your body.

938
00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:45.570
<v 4>Well,
it's fascinating.
You go down to downtown la anytime and just drive around.</v>

939
00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:48.300
Anytime you're feeling sorry for yourself about your career or the way things

940
00:52:48.301 --> 00:52:50.640
are going to go down there and you go,
oh,
weird.

941
00:52:50.641 --> 00:52:52.260
You go look at a crack addict and you go,

942
00:52:52.261 --> 00:52:56.790
this person decided to do crack instead of all of the other things.

943
00:52:57.510 --> 00:53:02.490
Forget no work,
no family,
no interest,
no hobbies,
no books,
no,

944
00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.340
no school,
no.
Just I do.
I'm a person that does crack.

945
00:53:05.341 --> 00:53:09.960
My human experience has been to get money to smoke crack.

946
00:53:09.961 --> 00:53:11.550
That's it.
That's what I've checked out.

947
00:53:11.551 --> 00:53:15.990
What if you never been to skid row and you're in La,

948
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:21.120
you've got to try it.
It's the vacation destination of the year.

949
00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:25.020
This week's episode of the Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by skid

950
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:31.080
<v 0>just to see where we're at because everybody like has this idea that one day</v>

951
00:53:31.081 --> 00:53:34.740
we're going to have some sort of a walking dead type apocalyptic scenario.

952
00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:38.190
It's already here we're,
we're ready.
It's just a small spot.

953
00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:40.620
It's only like a block or two or a couple of blocks,

954
00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:45.650
but full long la downtown blocks are filled with villages of homeless people

955
00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:50.400
wandering around like zombies shooting up,
yelling at each other.

956
00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:53.880
This is not the Congo Kinshasa.
This is not Flint,
Michigan.

957
00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:57.300
This is one of the biggest cities in America,
the most rich,

958
00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:00.360
vibrant cities in America in downtown.

959
00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:05.070
There are is a straight up Zombie Apocalypse village waiting for you to visit

960
00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:09.720
and people would think we're lying or see if you can find a video of skid row

961
00:54:09.721 --> 00:54:14.010
just so people can find it.
You need a bathroom break?
Yeah,
get in there son.

962
00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:18.590
Where is their right to that door?
Go through that door and uh,

963
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:19.771
while you're at it,

964
00:54:19.771 --> 00:54:23.220
there was one of those battle rap videos that somebody put on the underground,

965
00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:25.860
uh,
on a message board rather.
Um,

966
00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:29.730
with these two guys are battle rapping in the middle of it.
One guy shoots heroin

967
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:35.700
shoot heroin in the middle of a battle rap.
Yeah.
His name's Cadillac Ron.

968
00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:38.070
So pull up Cadillac.

969
00:54:38.071 --> 00:54:42.510
Ron shoots up in the middle of a battle rap and Ted,

970
00:54:42.511 --> 00:54:47.220
10 minutes in there in the middle of which,
you know,
most battle rap,

971
00:54:47.221 --> 00:54:50.320
I think it's dog shit.
So it just like,
you know,

972
00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:55.890
all this craziness about how I do you peel your cap back.

973
00:54:55.891 --> 00:54:59.370
You know,
I do the,
you know,
I'm,
I'm the baddest motherfucker,
blah,
blah,
blah.

974
00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:02.310
Most of it's silly.
I've had a lot of battle rapper say,

975
00:55:02.311 --> 00:55:05.280
and let me come on and explain it.
Fuck you bitch.

976
00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:08.640
I can see your shit online.
I see what you're doing.
I think,

977
00:55:08.641 --> 00:55:12.330
I just think there's some people are good at it.
Oh yeah,
it's real.
Yeah.

978
00:55:12.331 --> 00:55:16.560
He really shoots up.
If you're going to show,
what are you doing?

979
00:55:16.561 --> 00:55:21.240
I'm showing a whole word.
Oh,
get it to 10 minutes in.
He,
um,

980
00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:23.640
you know,
he shoots it.

981
00:55:23.641 --> 00:55:26.340
What's interesting is he shoots up and then immediately becomes way better.

982
00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:30.240
So if I was his manager,
I would say continue shooting up because uh,

983
00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:34.980
this is where your expertise lies.
This guy was,
I guess he was like,

984
00:55:35.730 --> 00:55:38.460
who is fucked up on drugs?
And then he got sober.

985
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:39.810
Now he's fucked up on drugs again.

986
00:55:39.811 --> 00:55:42.210
It's interesting when something like this happens and someone does something

987
00:55:42.211 --> 00:55:44.880
crazy,
then all these people who are like fans of is,

988
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:47.160
they kind of fill you in on the background.

989
00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:52.290
There's so many rappers out there that it's impossible to keep an eye on all of

990
00:55:52.291 --> 00:55:54.180
them.
You know,
people were always bringing up new names.

991
00:55:54.690 --> 00:55:58.380
It's not like rappers retire like every year there's like a million new ones.

992
00:55:58.381 --> 00:56:01.230
It's impossible to keep track of all of them.

993
00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:05.850
But this guy has a lot of fans,
talented rapper in the middle of this,

994
00:56:05.851 --> 00:56:10.840
10 minutes into this battle rap,
he steps back and uh,

995
00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:15.420
I saw that he shoots up.
Yeah,
this is,
so this is

996
00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:21.690
right now he's totally shooting up right now.
Look at this

997
00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:29.300
and now he starts popping around.

998
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:30.833
<v 5>Wow.</v>

999
00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:37.200
<v 0>How Tommy these kids are.
They're like,
you can clap.
Their guide is buried juice.</v>

1000
00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:42.920
Where's the owner at?
And this is him talking now.
Okay.

1001
00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:46.560
<v 5>We're not doing heroin and walking into cheers woody.
Get Norman.
Oh,</v>

1002
00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:51.250
just go to the post man.
Shit.
Everybody knows me.
Oh,
the blown.

1003
00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:55.670
Even me,
if I had it my way all to live in my bed,
but constant morphine,

1004
00:56:55.671 --> 00:56:56.600
Oxycontin,
Kogi,

1005
00:56:56.601 --> 00:56:59.580
methadone dog to sit here and cocaine freebase China white mixed with Mtma

1006
00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:02.420
immediately administer me being asleep to the main things on my penis

1007
00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:06.330
out of his [inaudible].
This is all going my admin.

1008
00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:08.550
If I see any prescription drugs,
I'm fucking granted him.

1009
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:12.430
Second Medicine Cabinets,
he has Cadillac wrong based on Brynne's with the ED.

1010
00:57:12.431 --> 00:57:15.860
It's even not a Cadillac.
It's fucking suck at tab is plenty.

1011
00:57:15.861 --> 00:57:19.240
It's not concentrated enough.
Ball play motherfucker.
You been in the county.
What?

1012
00:57:19.241 --> 00:57:22.960
The boy days while my best friend you were five years for aggravated assault.

1013
00:57:22.961 --> 00:57:23.840
It wasn't as though shit.

1014
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:26.360
Everybody I know don't put basically a medical leave of absence,

1015
00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:27.860
thanksgiving night,
tweak an accident.

1016
00:57:27.861 --> 00:57:31.120
My absence shall be smoked at $40 a crack by myself.
Scanning,

1017
00:57:31.121 --> 00:57:33.740
share it and how are you with messenger?
Funny slice.
The air was saying fuck you.

1018
00:57:33.741 --> 00:57:37.910
Do your parents ruined your life.
Watch maybe do the down stroke on purpose.

1019
00:57:37.911 --> 00:57:40.450
Why be sober when you could be high.
See I listened to sun spot.

1020
00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:44.650
I'm going to drop to the jungles in back on multiple gunshot.
Oo,
bucks.

1021
00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:48.350
Stop pumps up.
Sold 12 games.
Pullbacks triggers are so busy that I have.

1022
00:57:48.351 --> 00:57:49.184
I'm fucking days.

1023
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:53.100
<v 0>Okay.
I mean that was bad heroin because that,
you know,</v>

1024
00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:57.350
didn't seem to work cause he can still talk.
Right?
Well he's an addict.
Yeah.

1025
00:57:57.351 --> 00:58:01.370
He just got the flu to go away.
That little monkey was like,
good,
good work.

1026
00:58:01.371 --> 00:58:02.330
Let's get back to hip hop.

1027
00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:07.280
That's the thing that happens to people that become addicts is that this need is

1028
00:58:07.281 --> 00:58:10.100
like this horrible thing and then you get,

1029
00:58:10.101 --> 00:58:13.970
you feel the need and that makes you even [inaudible].
That's what they call it.

1030
00:58:13.971 --> 00:58:18.320
Chasing the dragon.
The dragon is the first heroine experience.
Did you do heroin?

1031
00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:22.580
I never did heroin.
What was your specialty?
And Man,
I was a kid.
So kid,
kid stuff,

1032
00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:26.270
Lsd,
Lsd,
mushrooms,
weed,
alcohol.

1033
00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:30.740
So what made you decide like,
oh my God,
I'm fucked up.
I gotta get sober.
Well,

1034
00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:34.510
I was,
I was in and out of Rehab,
you know,

1035
00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:38.980
crazy Rehab for alcohol like we have for what?
I honestly as a,

1036
00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:41.420
as an adult now looking back,
I think it was,

1037
00:58:41.421 --> 00:58:43.400
I was sent there for behavioral issues.

1038
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:46.160
I was a juvenile delinquent and that was the primary thing.
I mean,

1039
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:50.020
I don't know that I really believe in drug addiction in the way that I used,

1040
00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.370
you know,
the,
uh,
the,
uh,
the,

1041
00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:56.270
I think that the paradigm of what addiction is within 12 step and within Rehab

1042
00:58:56.271 --> 00:59:00.020
is that addiction is,
this is a permanent spiritual state of being,
you know?

1043
00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:03.470
Right.
But you are,
you,
that's what you are and that's what you always will be.

1044
00:59:03.471 --> 00:59:07.820
That's the main criticism of things like alcoholics anonymous,
that and God,

1045
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:12.150
yeah,
the God part part is a little weird from my perspective.
And I'm not a,

1046
00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:14.060
I'm not an ardent atheist by any means,

1047
00:59:14.061 --> 00:59:17.870
but it is a little weird for like you Joe,
you hit rock bottom,

1048
00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:22.010
you're just some guy and then you my solution to you as okay,
we'll come

1049
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:22.940
<v 2>meet God.
It's like,</v>

1050
00:59:22.941 --> 00:59:26.000
well that doesn't seem like don't they allow you to substitute that for a higher

1051
00:59:26.001 --> 00:59:26.840
power?
Yeah.

1052
00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:30.470
Sort of like the idea that like maybe you could substitute it for the universe.

1053
00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:34.150
Sure.
But it's all just mental apologetics.
I mean it's still a spiritual what,

1054
00:59:34.151 --> 00:59:39.020
why am I going to court and I'm a federal judges mandating me to go,
you know,

1055
00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:42.800
to have the spirit of the universe heal me.
It doesn't,
it doesn't make sense.

1056
00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:46.460
I'm into it.
What with the federal judge when you mean,

1057
00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:51.610
well like you could go to court for a drug related charge and have a judge say

1058
00:59:51.711 --> 00:59:54.170
you must go to Aa meetings for the 90 days.
Right?

1059
00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:57.530
And then you get to Aa meetings and the thing they say to you is you find a

1060
00:59:57.531 --> 01:00:01.370
power greater than yourself to restore you to sanity.
There's a disconnect there.

1061
01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.840
Why is there a government official telling you to go to a,
uh,

1062
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:05.720
a sense of what's essentially a church?

1063
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:09.920
What do you think that maybe that could be just because there's a lack of other

1064
01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:10.510
viable

1065
01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:15.460
<v 1>options for a judge?
Like if you want to get someone sober,
narcotics anonymous,</v>

1066
01:00:15.461 --> 01:00:18.910
alcoholics anonymous.
It's pretty much the only thing that we've shown that,

1067
01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:22.690
you know,
has good,
a high rate of efficacy.

1068
01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:25.950
<v 2>I think that it's what people,</v>

1069
01:00:25.951 --> 01:00:28.710
I think that it's the paradigm that we're living in,
that people go there.

1070
01:00:28.711 --> 01:00:33.330
I'm for it.
I like it.
It helps me or helped me when I was young.
I,
I'm,

1071
01:00:33.331 --> 01:00:36.750
I'm all for it,
but I do think that there's an argument to be made.
It's like,

1072
01:00:36.751 --> 01:00:41.751
why is some atheist drug addict being sent to a God based organization?

1073
01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:45.080
It just does seem a little bit weird.
Hmm.

1074
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:45.291
<v 1>Well,</v>

1075
01:00:45.291 --> 01:00:49.490
I think the standard that we have today as far as what we believe works and what

1076
01:00:49.491 --> 01:00:51.920
we've shown the work,
the people that we know that have stayed sober,

1077
01:00:51.921 --> 01:00:52.940
they've gone that route.

1078
01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:57.500
The ibogaine route is so alien to Western culture that we haven't used it as an

1079
01:00:57.501 --> 01:00:59.940
option,
but if it was an option and we had,

1080
01:00:59.941 --> 01:01:02.780
and I guarantee you it would make,

1081
01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:07.310
it would make being in 12 step programs be like sending smoke signals as opposed

1082
01:01:07.311 --> 01:01:08.060
to calling somebody.

1083
01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:09.950
<v 2>Well that's interesting.
Well,
what we should do,
Joe,</v>

1084
01:01:09.951 --> 01:01:14.060
is we should get a big bucket of Ibogaine and go to all the Aa meetings in town

1085
01:01:14.490 --> 01:01:19.270
and put it in the coffee and just dose
you got to him if he wants some.

1086
01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:23.010
I'm sure you do.
There's a,

1087
01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:26.800
<v 1>there's a bunch of articles online for anybody who's interested in a,</v>

1088
01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:29.640
I have a gain,
but anybody who has any sort of an addiction,

1089
01:01:29.641 --> 01:01:33.630
I would recommend it wholeheartedly.
I haven't done it myself,

1090
01:01:33.631 --> 01:01:35.940
but I everyone that I know that's done it,

1091
01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:40.170
that has had some sort of an addiction is kicked it.
That's amazing.

1092
01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:45.030
Not just kicked it,
but man,
my friend Ed is the best example.
He's,

1093
01:01:45.031 --> 01:01:48.770
he's so different now.
He's just so any super s very,

1094
01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:51.780
he was always very motivated.
He was always very successful.

1095
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:54.270
Real estate investments,
always doing a bunch of different things.

1096
01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:58.290
He's still successful,
but it's a way different way.
Now he's just more,

1097
01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:00.840
he's more present,
more relaxed,

1098
01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:05.610
like he's a kinder person that he gives off this different sort of relaxed

1099
01:02:05.611 --> 01:02:09.720
feeling.
It's very,
very interesting and unique.
And you know,

1100
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:14.040
he's completely free of any of the pills that were,
were playing him.
And for him,

1101
01:02:14.041 --> 01:02:16.920
he was a pretty healthy guy,
just get injured.
And once he got injured,

1102
01:02:16.921 --> 01:02:20.040
he was taking pain pills and then whoop off to the,
yeah,
that

1103
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.740
<v 0>is a weird thing.
And I said,
there's a little monkey inside of everybody.</v>

1104
01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:26.130
It's not just some kind of spiritually broken person,
but if I,
you know,

1105
01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:29.700
if you take enough pills,
yeah,
you're,
you're gonna get,
you're gonna get addicted.

1106
01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.130
Well,
Carl Hart was talking about the,
um,

1107
01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:37.160
the prevalence of these prescribed drugs in prescribing these oxycontin and all

1108
01:02:37.561 --> 01:02:40.680
these different things,
and they're like,
it's a really incredibly potent drugs.

1109
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:41.350
Right?

1110
01:02:41.350 --> 01:02:44.490
They're being prescribed like crazy because they can make a lot of money off of

1111
01:02:44.491 --> 01:02:45.240
them.
You know,

1112
01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:48.930
they just came up with some new drug that's far more potent than Oxycontin,

1113
01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:51.060
and I remember reading that going,

1114
01:02:51.061 --> 01:02:54.870
who's complaining is this Oxycontin's bull shit.
That battle rapper.

1115
01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:59.820
Yeah.
80 of those bitches in my fucking fruit loops.

1116
01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:03.660
I think a rush at one point in time was taking something like 90 a day,

1117
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:06.600
but that's the same thing.
The Lambo.
Oh,

1118
01:03:06.601 --> 01:03:10.680
I thought you meant the progressive rock band.
They progressive.
They're classic.

1119
01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:11.581
It's not what they're called.

1120
01:03:11.581 --> 01:03:15.850
I think that's called prog rock rush Canada.

1121
01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:21.810
The steam approaches.
How could that be progressive?

1122
01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:25.950
Is it,
is that what you're thinking?
Is Jamie progressive?
I mean,

1123
01:03:25.951 --> 01:03:27.750
I don't know what that means.
I've been around for it.

1124
01:03:27.751 --> 01:03:30.120
I guess it's just their smart isn't progressive.

1125
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:33.480
I don't think it means that they're forward thinking.
I think it means that they,

1126
01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:37.840
their music progress's am I right or something like that.
Hmm.

1127
01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:42.960
Okay.
Too many uses of the word progressive and provincial.
Yeah.

1128
01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:48.630
Yeah.
Well,
progressive more provincial.
I was,
I was just fucking that up.

1129
01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:50.970
You're saying that there's a million different ways you can use the word

1130
01:03:50.971 --> 01:03:53.310
progressive.
Well,
this too.
You know,

1131
01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:57.870
like progressing forward and progressive as far as an ideology.
Right.

1132
01:03:57.871 --> 01:04:01.110
Those two are not,
you know,
like progressive music.
I don't know.

1133
01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:02.190
I don't really understand music,

1134
01:04:02.191 --> 01:04:05.130
but I would imagine you're saying as far as like how the courts progress,

1135
01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.130
you know,
all I know about his progressive house,

1136
01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:13.350
which is that it will progress from being bad music to being worse.

1137
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:19.770
I think it's just a joke folks.
More aggressive with being bad.
Yeah.
The,

1138
01:04:19.771 --> 01:04:24.160
um,
did you,
is these those pills man?
Huh?
What are these?
Right here.
Ah,

1139
01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:28.710
that's something different.
It's a game.
What is that?
That's not Ivor gay.

1140
01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:32.220
What the fuck are these pills?
Are these yours?
Yeah,
that's just that sport tech.

1141
01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:36.990
Shroom tech.
She can't even talk.
He has to laugh.
No,

1142
01:04:36.991 --> 01:04:39.390
but it is from tech medicine check.
Okay.
Oh,
it really is.

1143
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:43.020
Why is it in a little Baggie?
So sketchy dude,

1144
01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.380
you're literally more sketchy than that rap battle rapper dude.

1145
01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:48.130
Completely sketching it.

1146
01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:52.620
He's completely sketching what we're in the middle of talking about it.
Um,

1147
01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:56.190
I have a game drug addiction.
We've gotten past Oh,
progressive.

1148
01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.800
The idea of progressive music as opposed to progressive,

1149
01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:02.820
like thinking and progressive because progressive becomes like left wing,

1150
01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:07.800
you know,
like become interchangeable.
Progressive and liberal.
Oh right.

1151
01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:11.680
Yeah,
yeah.
You know,
it's more like people think of it as more like,

1152
01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:15.660
like a conservative person when I have a very different idea of what progressive

1153
01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:18.340
thinking is.
Oh,
it's obnoxious to call yourself progressive.

1154
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:20.290
<v 2>Yeah,
we're the progressive ones.
Yeah.</v>

1155
01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:23.560
Where the wise ones and then there's the other side,
the dumb people.

1156
01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:27.070
But I do think they're done well.
They are definitely dumber.

1157
01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:32.170
<v 1>You know,
it's just little words are a problem,
you know,</v>

1158
01:05:32.171 --> 01:05:35.500
labeling things or problem because as soon as you label something,

1159
01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:40.750
you can define things in a way like you know,
Oh you liberal.
Like you know,

1160
01:05:40.751 --> 01:05:44.140
arguments where someone will go,
well liberals like you.
Like do you,

1161
01:05:44.170 --> 01:05:48.100
do you actually know what the word liberal means?
It's probably a good thing.

1162
01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:48.761
Let's look up.

1163
01:05:48.761 --> 01:05:53.761
Liberal liberal is most often thought of as being like bleeding hard or soft or

1164
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.781
you know,

1165
01:05:55.781 --> 01:06:00.781
someone who's weak or has a delusional view.

1166
01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:05.950
Philosophical view.
That's the negative way of thinking about a liberal,

1167
01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:10.750
a adult.
Yeah.
Adult and adult,
but look,

1168
01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:12.400
look at the word in the dictionary.

1169
01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:17.380
A favorable to progress or reform as in political or religious affairs so that

1170
01:06:17.381 --> 01:06:18.360
we are progressive.
Yeah.

1171
01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:23.020
Or I am you are liberal noting or pertaining to a political party.
Okay.

1172
01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:27.850
Of pertaining to,
not based on advocating liberalism but there's like some,

1173
01:06:28.270 --> 01:06:29.103
okay.
Here.

1174
01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:34.000
Favorable or in accord with the concepts of maximum individual freedom possible

1175
01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:38.620
especially as guaranteed by law and secured by governmental protection of civil

1176
01:06:38.621 --> 01:06:42.820
liberties.
That's something that sounds good.
It sounds good to me,

1177
01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:47.800
but he say that being a liberal it just think about that you're saying being

1178
01:06:47.801 --> 01:06:50.560
liberal,
you're mocking someone for being a liberal,

1179
01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:55.770
that it's not good to be favorable to the concept of maximum individual freedom,

1180
01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:02.220
especially as guaranteed by law and secured by governmental protection of civil

1181
01:07:02.411 --> 01:07:03.910
liberties.
You don't not into that.

1182
01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:06.200
<v 2>Well that's kind of complicated because then the,</v>

1183
01:07:06.201 --> 01:07:10.670
you know the extreme right wing on the libertarian side,

1184
01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:14.450
those people are essentially liberals themselves.
Yeah.

1185
01:07:14.451 --> 01:07:17.830
They are dudes that are out like fighting the BLM in Nevada.
I mean,

1186
01:07:17.850 --> 01:07:20.480
sounds the weird racism stuff.
The Bundy ranch,

1187
01:07:21.150 --> 01:07:26.150
that dude is really all about the extreme notion of personal civil liberties as

1188
01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:28.310
liberal as possible.

1189
01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:31.490
The government shouldn't ever have any say in anything except I don't know what

1190
01:07:31.491 --> 01:07:33.380
they think the government should do.
I don't know.

1191
01:07:33.381 --> 01:07:35.630
But he thinks that black people are better off as slaves.

1192
01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:40.130
Now he's got a point there and I'll tell you why.
From a liberal perspective.

1193
01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:44.330
Yeah,
that was a,
that was sort of the crumbling of his big ideologies.
Like,

1194
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:47.960
and I'm a huge racist.
Well,
and the fact that he denied that he ever said it,

1195
01:07:47.961 --> 01:07:50.900
but they had a recording of it and they went back and played it back for him.

1196
01:07:50.901 --> 01:07:55.710
Like you,
you did say it.
You said that exactly.
It was,
this is not what I meant.

1197
01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:57.670
Tmo I mean,
I seen him,

1198
01:07:57.671 --> 01:07:59.660
a couple of black people that would be better off as slaves.
I would,

1199
01:07:59.661 --> 01:08:01.850
I just might talked to a couple of dudes and they said,

1200
01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:04.020
<v 1>and is his perspective,</v>

1201
01:08:04.021 --> 01:08:07.770
was it as driving through Las Vegas and he saw bad neighborhoods in Vegas and

1202
01:08:07.771 --> 01:08:11.460
then he started talking about,
you know,
how much better they would be off of.

1203
01:08:11.461 --> 01:08:15.970
They were picking cotton like wow.
Yeah,
on a plantation.
Like um,

1204
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:18.240
<v 0>no,
no,
not,
no,</v>

1205
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:22.150
I think your perspective's a little fucked up dude and don't show some taxes

1206
01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:26.030
bitch.
How about paying those taxes?
I don't believe in taxes raising taxes,

1207
01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:28.100
but what,
here's a question.

1208
01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:31.820
Do you think that I'm crazy ucs murder man?

1209
01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:33.710
What do you think a person like that,

1210
01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:38.630
do you think that he would've gained from an Iowaska experience or would it just

1211
01:08:38.631 --> 01:08:40.100
make him crazy?
It's a good question.

1212
01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.270
I don't think anyone really knows until you take someone like that and give it

1213
01:08:44.271 --> 01:08:46.220
to them.
Otherwise you're just guessing.

1214
01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:47.630
Not Enough people who've actually done it.

1215
01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:51.260
Certainly not enough psychotics who've done it,
you know?

1216
01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.210
And the other thing is it's illegal in America,

1217
01:08:53.211 --> 01:08:56.660
so you have to go to Peru to do it or you've got to do it under the cover of

1218
01:08:56.661 --> 01:08:58.850
darkness here in America.
Very hard to convince that.

1219
01:08:58.851 --> 01:09:02.010
Got To go to Peru on a psychological experiment.
Well,

1220
01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:05.660
he obviously was a very troubled human being.

1221
01:09:05.690 --> 01:09:07.130
Anybody that could possibly do that,

1222
01:09:07.131 --> 01:09:09.440
anybody can get in their car and just randomly shoot people.

1223
01:09:09.441 --> 01:09:12.110
Did he shoot himself at the end?
It seems like he did.

1224
01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.400
They haven't announced that.
Right,

1225
01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:16.490
but he was dead of a gunshot wound inside of his car.

1226
01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:21.730
<v 4>It seemed like such a spoiled Brat that,
that that I want to know if,</v>

1227
01:09:21.731 --> 01:09:26.050
how much is it like him being like crazy and how much of him like growing up in

1228
01:09:26.051 --> 01:09:29.080
like some weird Cinderella type life that he wants,

1229
01:09:29.081 --> 01:09:33.910
he didn't get something immediately that easy that he just couldn't handle it.

1230
01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:37.010
That's the thing.
I was reading a lot of people,
you know,

1231
01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:39.940
that we're sort of deriding the idea that we're calling him crazy.

1232
01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:45.040
And they were saying,
you know,
basically when a Muslim person bloat,

1233
01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.980
kills a bunch of people,
we start talking about uh,

1234
01:09:48.010 --> 01:09:50.800
the calling them terrorists when,
uh,
when,
uh,
you know,
uh,

1235
01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.830
a black dude kills a bunch of people.
We started calling them thugs,

1236
01:09:53.831 --> 01:09:57.820
but when a young white guy starts killing people,
we call the mentally ill.

1237
01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:01.210
And somehow that's,
there's some inherent hypocrisy in that.

1238
01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:06.010
And I kind of just think like,
it's,
I was thinking about this last night,

1239
01:10:06.011 --> 01:10:06.521
like there's,

1240
01:10:06.521 --> 01:10:10.270
there's levels of human evil that are so intense that what we get when we

1241
01:10:10.271 --> 01:10:12.910
approached some,
we just kind of like shut down.
Like,
you know,

1242
01:10:12.911 --> 01:10:16.090
remember the matrix when they would do like the electronic pulse and all the

1243
01:10:16.091 --> 01:10:17.470
machinery would just shut down.

1244
01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:20.980
It's like there are levels of human evil that we get to that are so intense that

1245
01:10:20.981 --> 01:10:24.820
when we start approaching them,
thought just drops out and pee.

1246
01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:29.020
And it's all emotion that's left.
And so you can look at somebody like that.

1247
01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:30.460
And say,
you know,

1248
01:10:30.490 --> 01:10:35.400
it's a hypocritical to call that guy mentally ill or you're fighting against a

1249
01:10:35.410 --> 01:10:39.490
feminist cause by not recognizing the inherent misogyny and his attack.

1250
01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:43.150
But really what's happening is something so much sadder and deeper than either

1251
01:10:43.151 --> 01:10:43.841
of those things.

1252
01:10:43.841 --> 01:10:48.841
It's just like we're living in this insane fucking world where human beings have

1253
01:10:48.851 --> 01:10:51.640
some tick in this country,
more than another countries.

1254
01:10:51.641 --> 01:10:54.880
No one can figure out why were they sometimes once in a while we'll go into a

1255
01:10:54.881 --> 01:10:57.970
place and shoot a bunch of people and no one knows why it happens.

1256
01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:00.130
And some people say it's because it's mental illness.

1257
01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:01.960
And some people say it's because of bad parenting.

1258
01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:04.030
And some people say it's because of gun control.

1259
01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.890
And some people say it's because of,
you know,

1260
01:11:05.891 --> 01:11:09.730
violent video games and violent men and MMA and movies and music.

1261
01:11:09.731 --> 01:11:12.130
And nobody fucking knows why it's really happening.

1262
01:11:12.131 --> 01:11:16.200
And it's so terrifying that we just start slinging mud at one another.
Trying to,

1263
01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:17.700
trying to say,
well,
it's this,
it's that.

1264
01:11:17.701 --> 01:11:21.840
And you're part of the problem by perpetuating this idea.
And the reality is,

1265
01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:25.920
is existence is terrifying and humans are fucking weird.

1266
01:11:25.921 --> 01:11:30.090
And once in a while there's this evolutionary blip that somebody pops out of

1267
01:11:30.091 --> 01:11:33.690
their mother with a,
you know,
sort of genetic code ready to murder people.

1268
01:11:33.691 --> 01:11:36.660
And I don't think it's because of being spoiled and maybe it is,

1269
01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:40.650
and I don't think it's because of,
you know,
chemical imbalances or maybe it is,

1270
01:11:40.651 --> 01:11:45.651
it's just the reality is that's what's happening is jack the ripper exists in

1271
01:11:46.021 --> 01:11:51.021
some 0.001% of human beings.

1272
01:11:51.331 --> 01:11:52.410
It's terrifying.

1273
01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:54.450
<v 1>It's a small percentage,</v>

1274
01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:59.480
but there's so many people that when our access to news and information is so

1275
01:12:00.451 --> 01:12:04.350
complete now than anytime something happens anywhere in the world,
that's bad.

1276
01:12:04.351 --> 01:12:06.060
We get to hear about it.
And the numbers,

1277
01:12:06.061 --> 01:12:08.280
if you look at it and try to put it into perspective,

1278
01:12:08.281 --> 01:12:10.050
when you're talking about 7 billion people,

1279
01:12:10.051 --> 01:12:13.560
like you hear about a horrible gang rape in India and everybody at home just

1280
01:12:13.561 --> 01:12:16.410
clutches or chest and rightly so,
you freak out.
You think,

1281
01:12:16.411 --> 01:12:19.800
what if that was a loved one would?
If that was me,
you know God,

1282
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:23.250
what is wrong with humanity that a bunch of people on a bus can rape some woman?

1283
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:29.280
The numbers though of people not raping and not murdering or the more shocking,

1284
01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:34.470
it's like we concentrate on the negative and look entirely at these people like

1285
01:12:34.471 --> 01:12:38.280
this one fuck up his crazy ass hole shot a bunch of people in Santa Barbara.

1286
01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:42.000
The number of people that don't really define human behavior.

1287
01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:47.030
So I ideas of human behavior oftentimes are shaped in this scared way by these

1288
01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:51.720
instances that are extremely rare in perspective.

1289
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:55.350
If you put it into perspective that the the great number of people,
you know,

1290
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:57.840
great number of people you know are not going to commit violence.

1291
01:12:58.050 --> 01:12:59.610
They're not going to rape and not going to murder,

1292
01:12:59.611 --> 01:13:00.391
they're not going to do anything.

1293
01:13:00.391 --> 01:13:03.870
It's just knowing that it does exist within those numbers.

1294
01:13:03.871 --> 01:13:08.670
The perspective gets sort of skewed because if you go to CNN at any point in

1295
01:13:08.671 --> 01:13:10.320
time,
it's like that old bill Hicks bit.

1296
01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:14.790
Remember that Bill Hicks bet he did about a watching CNN,
AIDS,
murder,

1297
01:13:14.791 --> 01:13:18.540
death pit bulls.
He goes,
and then you open any door Chirp,
Chirp,
Chirp,
chirp.

1298
01:13:18.541 --> 01:13:20.640
Like what the fuck is all this shit?
You know,

1299
01:13:20.641 --> 01:13:23.340
like if someone needs to get Ted Turner,
the,
you know,

1300
01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:27.370
Jane Fonda's not fucking Ted Turner.
So He's,
he's putting up a,

1301
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:32.400
everybody will die of AIDS by 1990 print it,
you know,
he had that bit and um,

1302
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:35.640
it's kind of true.
If you go to CNN right now,
what do you get?

1303
01:13:35.641 --> 01:13:38.490
You get the first thing is six killed in Santa Barbara.

1304
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:43.410
Rampage three shot dead in myrtle beach.
I mean,
yeah.

1305
01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:48.180
You know,
this billionaire says he won the Ukraine election,

1306
01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:52.770
Egypt campaigner worker slain.
I mean,
it's all murder,
murder,
murder,
murder,

1307
01:13:52.771 --> 01:13:56.070
murder.
But there is a lot of murder.
There's a lot of murder,

1308
01:13:56.071 --> 01:14:00.660
but there's a lot of people,
right?
There's 7 billion fucking people,

1309
01:14:00.661 --> 01:14:04.300
350 million in America.
There's so many,

1310
01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.960
so many to be the actual amount of people that kill people.

1311
01:14:06.961 --> 01:14:08.160
When something like this happens,

1312
01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:13.300
if you looked at a giant map of all the human beings and all the human beings,

1313
01:14:13.301 --> 01:14:17.110
we're like a little red dot and every now and then a murder went off.
Fuck,
it's,

1314
01:14:17.230 --> 01:14:21.760
it's a small amount.
It's a really tiny,
tiny,
tiny,
tiny,
tiny,
tiny amount.

1315
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:24.860
<v 2>But what's interesting about us is that all of us know we're not supposed to</v>

1316
01:14:24.861 --> 01:14:27.800
murder people.
We all,
you know what I mean?

1317
01:14:27.801 --> 01:14:31.880
Like that's a part of the human thing is that the difference between the human

1318
01:14:31.881 --> 01:14:35.530
and the animal is that we were born with this consciousness of what,
you know,

1319
01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:38.900
good and the good and evil,
whatever that is.
But we have these sort of notions,

1320
01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:41.600
don't fuck kids,
don't kill humans,
don't rape people.

1321
01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:46.040
We all know that information and yet we keep doing it.

1322
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:48.790
It's is it just because we're animals,
but again,

1323
01:14:49.010 --> 01:14:52.250
<v 1>would the numbers of people that actually do do those things,</v>

1324
01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:57.320
rape kids murder and do fucked up horrible robberies.

1325
01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:00.410
There's are so small and almost all of it.

1326
01:15:00.411 --> 01:15:03.800
Like if you look at all these people that are committing terrible crimes,

1327
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:06.350
like what's the one thing they have in common?
Alienation.

1328
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:10.070
Alienation is one of the big ones.
A lot of these people feel alienated.

1329
01:15:10.071 --> 01:15:11.660
A lot of these people feel like they're outside is,

1330
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:13.520
a lot of these people hate all these other people.

1331
01:15:13.521 --> 01:15:17.240
They associate other people with giving them pain.
They feel like they're out.

1332
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:20.510
They don't,
you know,
they don't have anybody that you know,

1333
01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:23.090
they feel like they're connected to.

1334
01:15:23.091 --> 01:15:26.150
They're all fucked up on psychotropic drugs.

1335
01:15:26.151 --> 01:15:29.390
They're all fucked up on life itself though they're there,

1336
01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:31.180
they're not in the hive and this,

1337
01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:34.430
one of the things that's weird about people is that we need other people.

1338
01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:39.700
We need him bad and you can't just take a person and feed them and give them

1339
01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:44.300
water and never have any human contact because they'll go crazy.

1340
01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:46.310
That's why they put people in solitary confinement.

1341
01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:49.190
They can't wait until somebody opens that slot so he could look at someone and

1342
01:15:49.191 --> 01:15:51.710
said hello to him.
I mean,
you need people.

1343
01:15:51.711 --> 01:15:56.420
It's part of the very human experience itself.
We're not individuals.

1344
01:15:56.660 --> 01:16:00.410
We're a part of a giant multi life organism.

1345
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:04.810
The multi life organism is the human race and when someone doesn't fit in and it

1346
01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:05.653
all goes wrong.

1347
01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.870
If you ever play a video game and you're in the middle of like you're getting

1348
01:16:08.871 --> 01:16:12.230
your ass kicked and you just want to unplug the fucking box because your friend

1349
01:16:12.231 --> 01:16:13.670
is mocking you and you're like,

1350
01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:17.330
you're down like 200 to zero and you just keep getting killed,

1351
01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:21.710
your instinct is to shut it off.
Your instinct is to turn off the box.

1352
01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:25.250
A lot of people do that.
Kids do that all the time.
You Watch kids play games.

1353
01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:28.440
If they're losing really,
really badly,
they'll flip the fucking chess.
Okay.

1354
01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:31.700
<v 2>Are you saying anger?
These people are shutting off the box.</v>

1355
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:33.520
<v 1>Exactly.
That's what he's doing.</v>

1356
01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:36.310
By driving around shooting a bunch of people then shooting himself,

1357
01:16:36.311 --> 01:16:40.180
he caused some pain and then end his own.
What's all in one thing?

1358
01:16:40.210 --> 01:16:43.680
What's the solution?
The solution is very complicated,
but it's,

1359
01:16:43.681 --> 01:16:47.190
it's a part of evolving as a race.
I think it's,

1360
01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:50.590
it's a part of what are we now and what did we used to be?

1361
01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.210
We used to be murderers,

1362
01:16:52.211 --> 01:16:56.350
fucking monkeys on rampages thrown rocks at other murderous monkeys.
Before that,

1363
01:16:56.351 --> 01:17:00.850
we were single celled organisms slopping around in the ocean.
I mean,

1364
01:17:00.851 --> 01:17:05.500
we've become something that has gotten us to this point,
but it's not done.

1365
01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:09.040
It's not done at all.
And how many these kind of conversations,

1366
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:12.050
human beings having these kind of conversations,
it's not just you and I,

1367
01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:16.780
but people all over the world is slowly but surely elevating awareness.
And it's,

1368
01:17:16.781 --> 01:17:20.810
it's,
it's noticeable in our culture.
Like look at this,

1369
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.310
this is a kind of a weird example,

1370
01:17:22.311 --> 01:17:26.360
but someone was talking about comedy in the 1980s they were talking about like

1371
01:17:26.361 --> 01:17:29.420
Eddie Murphy Raw.
And then if you watch Eddie Murphy Raw,

1372
01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:34.450
like you realize like how fucking homophobic it is and nasty it is and mean

1373
01:17:34.491 --> 01:17:38.240
spirited straight up.
Just mean like it's so a friend was,

1374
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:41.000
he had it on and I forget who the fuck had told me.

1375
01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:45.010
[inaudible] professor really homophobic.
Really.
The nutty professor says,

1376
01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:47.650
how dare you,
that fart scene though.

1377
01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:52.270
But there's a bunch of things that you used to be able to do.
Uh,

1378
01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:55.370
and people got away with it and now people realize,
hey,
you know,

1379
01:17:55.371 --> 01:17:56.510
that's not fucking cool.

1380
01:17:56.810 --> 01:18:01.810
And it's become more and more not cool as time has gone on as more and more

1381
01:18:02.271 --> 01:18:04.470
people exchange information.
But the real,

1382
01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:08.120
the reality remains that there's a good percentage of people that fucking suck

1383
01:18:08.330 --> 01:18:11.300
and they're going to be sucky at parents too.
They suck at everything.

1384
01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:16.430
I had this person over the other day and I'm a friend of the family and,
uh,

1385
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.970
we're,

1386
01:18:16.970 --> 01:18:21.970
we're talking about his childhood and in just this horrible parents,

1387
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:25.850
parents,
horrible,
uh,
parental situation,

1388
01:18:25.851 --> 01:18:29.930
real bad drugs and alcohol and meanness and violence and all these different

1389
01:18:29.931 --> 01:18:33.470
things and just seeing this person who's gone through this and can kind of

1390
01:18:33.471 --> 01:18:37.250
express it,
but then you see him with his kid and he's great.

1391
01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:40.550
He's a great parent,
like super loving,
you know,

1392
01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:44.720
into it communicates a lot and you go,
okay,
well at least you know,

1393
01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:48.440
something happened.
It was a terrible situation,
but information was exchanged.

1394
01:18:48.441 --> 01:18:50.600
The,
this,
this person has evolved.

1395
01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:54.110
And then vendor dealing with this new person in their life,

1396
01:18:54.111 --> 01:18:56.570
this child that they had,
and they're doing a great job with it.

1397
01:18:56.810 --> 01:19:01.010
And so you see this sort of information being exchanged and lessons being

1398
01:19:01.011 --> 01:19:04.610
learned and lives being in Renton.
It's just like a,
as a,

1399
01:19:04.611 --> 01:19:09.450
as a human race,
as is this huge project of,

1400
01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:13.700
of evolution and growth.
We're getting better.
It's just not done.

1401
01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:15.440
It takes a long fucking time.

1402
01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:19.940
And you're going to have newt Gingrich still sitting around saying a bunch of

1403
01:19:19.941 --> 01:19:23.090
fucking stupid shit and you're going to have bill O'Reilly.

1404
01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:27.170
You're going to have these dinosaurs that were stuck in this old way of living

1405
01:19:27.171 --> 01:19:28.220
Donald Sterling.

1406
01:19:28.221 --> 01:19:32.240
You're going to have these old shitheads that there's still loafing around,

1407
01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:36.800
you know,
with this archaic idea of what the code of life is inside their head.

1408
01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:40.970
And you're going to have shit heads like this fucking evil kid that went around

1409
01:19:40.971 --> 01:19:43.580
shooting people in Santa Barbara because he was an outcast.

1410
01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.920
You're gonna have that.
We're not done yet.
And you know,

1411
01:19:45.921 --> 01:19:50.921
and maybe part of what's hurting us in the fact that we're not done is that

1412
01:19:51.051 --> 01:19:54.860
we're restricting a lot of these other options like Iowasca,
Ibogaine mushrooms,

1413
01:19:54.861 --> 01:19:58.310
all these different things that have had massively positive effects on some

1414
01:19:58.311 --> 01:20:01.640
people life changing effects.
Would it have helped that kid?
I don't know.

1415
01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:03.170
I don't know.
But it helps people.

1416
01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:06.710
It helps people way more than anything anybody's ever figured out as far as like

1417
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:11.340
and going to meetings where you pray to donuts,
all that,
all that shit is cute.

1418
01:20:11.730 --> 01:20:13.500
But go see the wizard,

1419
01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:16.650
go ride on the fucking snake with Gandalf in the middle of the jungle and you'll

1420
01:20:16.651 --> 01:20:20.580
come back with a different perspective.
Just smoked the fairy dust,

1421
01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:25.170
go take some dn t and literally be shot to the center of the universe for 15

1422
01:20:25.171 --> 01:20:28.500
minutes and explore all the possible options for life itself.

1423
01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:30.960
It's all those things can help people.

1424
01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:33.260
And I don't know if it would've helped this kid,
this kid sent,

1425
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:35.280
it seems like he's completely and totally fucked up,

1426
01:20:35.281 --> 01:20:40.281
but I think that he is one part of this giant fractal and when one part explodes

1427
01:20:41.791 --> 01:20:42.624
and blows up,

1428
01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:46.530
it doesn't change the beauty of the positive aspects of the fact that we just

1429
01:20:46.531 --> 01:20:49.530
have to figure out how to keep those blow ups at a minimum.

1430
01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:51.600
And a lot of it has to do with people raising kids.

1431
01:20:51.630 --> 01:20:55.200
They just do a fucking terrible job of it.
And it also could be,

1432
01:20:55.201 --> 01:20:58.050
you're around a bunch of other cunts,
you know,
maybe your neighbors,

1433
01:20:58.051 --> 01:20:58.920
all the kids you go to school with,

1434
01:20:58.921 --> 01:21:01.530
they're pieces of shit and they're fucking parents suck ass.

1435
01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:05.610
And so world's filled with suck,
you know,
and sometimes you can't,

1436
01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:09.250
you can't catch a break.
You just in a bad spot.
I wasn't,
I grew,

1437
01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:14.260
I had a bad neighborhood when I was 13 or when I was between 11 and when I was

1438
01:21:14.791 --> 01:21:19.680
13 we moved.
Um,
so I guess,
no,
between 11 and 13 I was in Florida.

1439
01:21:19.710 --> 01:21:23.910
13 to 14 is where it was bad.
That was when I was in Jamaica plain,

1440
01:21:23.911 --> 01:21:27.030
which is a bad neighborhood in Boston.
It's more gentrified now.

1441
01:21:27.031 --> 01:21:31.220
It's become sort of more of a hipster place where people bought places and fixed

1442
01:21:31.221 --> 01:21:33.030
him up.
But when I lived there in,

1443
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:36.420
I guess it was like 79 something like that,

1444
01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:40.380
somebody who's 79 80 it was fucking terrible.
It's bad kids,

1445
01:21:40.381 --> 01:21:43.440
bad kids doing bad shit.
There was always,

1446
01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:45.870
people were breaking into people's houses left and right.

1447
01:21:45.871 --> 01:21:48.850
There's a lot of kids that would do B and e's and they would call them B and he

1448
01:21:48.851 --> 01:21:51.720
was like,
it was no big.
They themselves would call it that.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1449
01:21:51.721 --> 01:21:55.230
He got popped for me to go do a B and the,
and they had horrible accents.

1450
01:21:55.231 --> 01:21:57.660
There's a kid named Holly Hudson lived next door.

1451
01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:00.180
You couldn't trust that care for five seconds.

1452
01:22:00.181 --> 01:22:03.180
He was always trying to steal things.
They were just,
they were drinking.

1453
01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:07.410
There were 11 he's listening right now.
Weeping.
He's dead.
He's not lifting.

1454
01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:12.990
He's dead.
Yeah.
I remember following,
he was a creepy next door neighbor,

1455
01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:15.960
but the,
but the point is that I was stuck.

1456
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:19.620
I mean it was only for about a year and a half till my parents realize this is a

1457
01:22:19.621 --> 01:22:23.070
terrible place to be.
And then we moved to a suburb called Newton,

1458
01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:27.870
which is the total opposite.
Nice families,
real like fucking Mayberry type town.

1459
01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:31.920
But a Jamaica plain was tricky.
And if I had stayed in Jamaica plain,

1460
01:22:31.921 --> 01:22:36.000
if I was in there,
ah fuck,
it's fucking hard to find cool people.

1461
01:22:36.001 --> 01:22:38.370
Hard to find safety,
you know,
hard to find.

1462
01:22:38.371 --> 01:22:41.430
Like I would leave my house and it would be sure that one of the neighbors would

1463
01:22:41.431 --> 01:22:44.910
break and I'll be sure like we caught people in the driveway trying to break

1464
01:22:44.911 --> 01:22:49.650
into cars.
Like there's just,
it was just,
just dangerous.
Just not good.

1465
01:22:50.010 --> 01:22:52.470
If that's your spot,
you fuck man,
that's,

1466
01:22:52.471 --> 01:22:56.610
and that's the number one thing that shows you that this government and the

1467
01:22:56.611 --> 01:23:01.611
people that are in charge don't give a fuck about the human race as an idea.

1468
01:23:02.131 --> 01:23:04.830
Because if they did the number one thing that everybody would be concentrating

1469
01:23:04.831 --> 01:23:08.680
on horrible neighborhoods,
skid row,
they would go to skid row and they would go,

1470
01:23:08.681 --> 01:23:13.540
how the fuck can this exist in 2014 with what we forget all your personal

1471
01:23:13.541 --> 01:23:17.650
freedom stuff.
This is obviously a problem,
right?
So giant problem.

1472
01:23:17.651 --> 01:23:21.640
You got a fucking village of zombies.
Go to go to Compton,
go to the,

1473
01:23:21.641 --> 01:23:25.660
go to the ghetto,
go to go to watts,
go to the worst spots in Harlem.

1474
01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:27.790
Go there and go.
How is it still like this

1475
01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:29.261
<v 2>in this country?</v>

1476
01:23:29.261 --> 01:23:33.790
Believe in individual freedoms above the freedoms of the of the masses.
I mean,

1477
01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:37.180
you don't take person's freedom to help.
I'm just saying that the,
the,

1478
01:23:37.190 --> 01:23:39.880
the fundamental notion of America is due for yourself.

1479
01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:43.870
And the problem with looking at a neighborhood filled with people who are down

1480
01:23:43.871 --> 01:23:47.940
on their luck is that the,
the reaction in this country can be,
look at all,

1481
01:23:48.010 --> 01:23:51.170
look at all these poor people or look all their brands.

1482
01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:53.890
Look at all these lazy people that won't do what I did.
Look at me.

1483
01:23:53.891 --> 01:23:56.890
Look at my house.
I've got a wonderful house,
I've got a huge car.

1484
01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:00.670
Therefore a person can have a wonderful house and a huge car.
Therefore,

1485
01:24:00.671 --> 01:24:02.350
if you don't have a wonderful house and a used car,

1486
01:24:02.351 --> 01:24:04.960
you didn't do the things you needed to do to get it.
I,

1487
01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:08.170
I'm always struck with people that complain about being on welfare.

1488
01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:09.160
People on Welfare.

1489
01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:14.140
They are always people who I can tell have never encountered people on welfare.

1490
01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:17.740
I never see people that are like from neighborhoods where people grew up on

1491
01:24:17.741 --> 01:24:20.320
welfare going like these bucking welfare.
It's like,

1492
01:24:20.321 --> 01:24:23.170
it's always people from the suburbs that are talking about an it,

1493
01:24:23.171 --> 01:24:27.130
an abstraction and intellectual abstraction like the welfare people.

1494
01:24:27.131 --> 01:24:29.890
Then you go meet people and you go,
oh,
you're like a poor family.

1495
01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:32.790
It's a lot easier to talk about welfare.
Uh,

1496
01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:35.950
p Mama's when you've never met people that are moms that are trying to feed

1497
01:24:35.951 --> 01:24:39.610
their kids by getting food stamps.
Yeah.
I was on welfare when I was a kid,

1498
01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:43.660
so it was,
I was,
it's not what people think it is.

1499
01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:44.913
People that are,

1500
01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:48.360
<v 1>there's people struggling.
There's sure there's people that abuse it.
You know,</v>

1501
01:24:48.361 --> 01:24:49.200
you hear about them,

1502
01:24:49.230 --> 01:24:52.260
they still work and they have jobs and they still take welfare and even rich

1503
01:24:52.261 --> 01:24:52.561
people.

1504
01:24:52.561 --> 01:24:55.950
I've heard stories of rich people that somehow or another we had con the system

1505
01:24:55.951 --> 01:25:00.390
or getting welfare,
but it's not.
Money's not going to fix everything.

1506
01:25:00.630 --> 01:25:02.760
We were Jews going to fix anything.
Jews on welfare.

1507
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:06.750
We were the first of our kind of,
that should be a band.
Yeah.
The name for a band.

1508
01:25:06.751 --> 01:25:10.890
We had a special entrance to the building and stuff.
Let us send the back.

1509
01:25:10.891 --> 01:25:14.860
You know you were the first with those RFID cards.
Yeah.
They'd saw her last name.

1510
01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.560
We're like,
are you sure you're in the right place?

1511
01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:21.750
I just think people suck at raising people and get you get stuck.

1512
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:24.900
We get stuck in a bad pattern.
Super Common.

1513
01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:27.780
Like one of the most common things in life is for people to get stuck in bad

1514
01:25:27.781 --> 01:25:28.830
patterns.
I mean,

1515
01:25:28.831 --> 01:25:32.790
how many folks do we know that just have the same issues over and over again?

1516
01:25:32.791 --> 01:25:35.400
Whether it comes to girlfriends,
whether it comes to boyfriends,

1517
01:25:35.401 --> 01:25:38.430
whether it comes to jobs getting fired.
You're like,

1518
01:25:38.431 --> 01:25:41.790
how many fucking people this drives me,
God damn nuts.
And people always say,
well,

1519
01:25:42.210 --> 01:25:42.570
you know,

1520
01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:46.170
I've only gone to like a couple of weddings ever and one of the reasons being is

1521
01:25:46.171 --> 01:25:47.370
like I'm not going to go to,

1522
01:25:47.371 --> 01:25:51.470
you're obviously going to fail project if you're one of those motherfuckers.

1523
01:25:51.970 --> 01:25:55.290
Like I have a friend that I used to work with and he was super offended cause I

1524
01:25:55.291 --> 01:25:57.240
didn't go to his wedding and I was like,
dude,

1525
01:25:57.270 --> 01:26:00.780
I've seen you through every one of your horrendous relationships.

1526
01:26:00.930 --> 01:26:04.940
You had a ton of fucking terrible relation with them.
They all went bad.

1527
01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:09.650
They all just come.
Just obvious bad choices from the jump.

1528
01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:13.100
And you've been with this chick for a year and you want me to fly to New York?

1529
01:26:13.190 --> 01:26:16.900
Fuck you man.
You're being rude,
rude ass.

1530
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:20.480
Why do your ridiculous party,

1531
01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:23.010
<v 2>the invitation said we'll attend,
will not attend,</v>

1532
01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:25.710
do not believe in the longterm viability of this relationship.

1533
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:29.170
<v 1>Well just all of it.
Like standing there,
standing,</v>

1534
01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:31.510
staring in your best clothes,

1535
01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:36.280
waiting for some people to say some nonsense to each other.
Like this is crazy,

1536
01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:38.590
but you're married.
It's crazy.

1537
01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:41.500
I'm married and the only reason why I'm married because my wife wants marriage.

1538
01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:45.250
She likes it and I love her enough that I'm willing to do something retarded.

1539
01:26:45.370 --> 01:26:49.720
That's what I did.
But the idea by asking,
yeah,
that's exactly what I said it.

1540
01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:55.080
But the idea of asking someone to go and stand there and watch you do your

1541
01:26:55.121 --> 01:26:58.870
fucking ceremony and hold hands and look at each other and slip metal on each

1542
01:26:58.871 --> 01:27:01.900
other's fingers like God damn,
you need that much attention.

1543
01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:04.810
If you guys really want to do it,
do it yourself.
Go somewhere.

1544
01:27:04.811 --> 01:27:08.710
And you know if you really want to see,
I'm not,
I'm not against ceremony.

1545
01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:12.980
I'm not against someone doing the Oh,
but we want our loved ones around like Ben.

1546
01:27:12.990 --> 01:27:16.840
She want people to fly to where you're at because it makes you the fucking King

1547
01:27:16.841 --> 01:27:20.140
of the hour.
It makes you super special.
It makes you the fucking,

1548
01:27:20.350 --> 01:27:23.950
this is the number one reason why we're here.
Everyone knows why we're here.

1549
01:27:23.951 --> 01:27:27.820
It's all for Mike.
Clink clink here,
here.
Let's have a toast to Mike.

1550
01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:30.100
It's people that want to feel fucking special.

1551
01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:34.860
<v 2>Well and the even further on the absurdity of marriage is the whole gay marriage</v>

1552
01:27:34.861 --> 01:27:37.080
argument is flawed in its beginning because it's like,

1553
01:27:37.081 --> 01:27:39.630
why are we involving the government in marriage in the first place?

1554
01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:43.350
Why do you go register your love with the government and then go basically all

1555
01:27:43.351 --> 01:27:46.170
you do when you get married and register with the government is saying it's

1556
01:27:46.171 --> 01:27:49.350
going to be,
I want to make sure it's incredibly difficult for us to break up.

1557
01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:50.790
Okay,
if this doesn't work out,

1558
01:27:50.970 --> 01:27:55.140
I want to make sure the government is somehow involved in,
are separating.
Okay.

1559
01:27:56.250 --> 01:27:59.700
<v 1>I've,
I actually understand gay marriage more than I understand straight marriage</v>

1560
01:28:00.210 --> 01:28:03.060
because gay people like being gay.

1561
01:28:03.061 --> 01:28:07.410
If you're going to fully go gay and you're going to be out and we all know that

1562
01:28:07.411 --> 01:28:10.800
a lot of people who are gay or not out there like,
hi,
they're in the closet.

1563
01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:16.020
If you're gay and you're married to another gay dude,
damn,

1564
01:28:16.021 --> 01:28:18.060
he's all in.
That guy's all in.

1565
01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:22.620
He went in publicly and financially when he didn't even have to,

1566
01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:26.760
they can't get pregnant.
They can't get pregnant.

1567
01:28:26.761 --> 01:28:31.590
Like you could fuck till the end of time.
That person could never keep you there.

1568
01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:32.551
You can never say,

1569
01:28:32.551 --> 01:28:35.280
you know what I'm going to raise your child would have all your responsibility,

1570
01:28:35.281 --> 01:28:38.040
bro.
I carried your fucking baby for nine months inside me.

1571
01:28:38.130 --> 01:28:40.210
I love your gay accent by the way.
That's my new,

1572
01:28:40.930 --> 01:28:44.940
my new gay motherfucker who it's like a whole Cogan bro.
Ish.

1573
01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:50.100
What are you going to do when I divorce you?
I'm giving birth.

1574
01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:54.930
That's just to give a shit.
Yeah,
well I don't think they shit,

1575
01:28:54.931 --> 01:28:58.290
they'd just have a different opening sort of taint.

1576
01:28:58.291 --> 01:29:01.950
Shoot with a baby comes out,
but they're all in,

1577
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.350
<v 0>you know?
I mean that's,
that's really all in and they don't have to be,</v>

1578
01:29:04.351 --> 01:29:08.010
that's a big commitment.
If you gain,
you decide to get married anyway.
Like wow,

1579
01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:10.410
that's a commitment.
That's a commitment and them as a motherfucker.

1580
01:29:10.650 --> 01:29:13.960
And another thing that happens with the gay people is a lot of times is

1581
01:29:14.010 --> 01:29:15.150
fascinating when they get married,

1582
01:29:15.151 --> 01:29:18.840
they assume traditional roles like male and female roles.
Like,

1583
01:29:18.841 --> 01:29:22.590
I have friends that are gay and they're married and they lived down the street

1584
01:29:22.591 --> 01:29:25.800
and there's like that the guy's one guy's clear with the husband and one guys

1585
01:29:25.801 --> 01:29:29.610
clear the wife,
you know,
it's like,
it's pretty clear.
One Guy Works,

1586
01:29:29.611 --> 01:29:32.580
the other one doesn't.
They have a kid that they've adopted and they're raising,

1587
01:29:32.581 --> 01:29:34.980
this kid is fed very fascinating situation,

1588
01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:39.390
but they have almost the sort of nuclear family,
but they have it with two men.

1589
01:29:39.810 --> 01:29:41.970
Do you think that's typical but it doesn't seem typical to me.

1590
01:29:42.150 --> 01:29:46.770
The one person is uh,
you know,
roles.
Many times I've seen the pie.

1591
01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:50.010
I think it's a Yin Yang sort of situation.
I think it's an opposite.

1592
01:29:50.011 --> 01:29:53.260
Attract sort of a situation.
Is that the name of the kid they adopted?
No,
he,

1593
01:29:54.630 --> 01:29:57.960
no way.
You can't adopt white kids.
You out of here.

1594
01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.710
If you have money,
you can get a white one.
Actually,

1595
01:30:01.711 --> 01:30:04.740
I feel like the white ones are probably worse because they're all from these

1596
01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:09.750
horrifying like cobwebby like Gulag,
uh,
you know,
orphanages,
you know,

1597
01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:13.050
where they sat up straight for like the first five years of their life.
You know,

1598
01:30:13.051 --> 01:30:15.360
and they look all nice and white and then you've got them home and they're like,

1599
01:30:15.450 --> 01:30:17.550
I've,
it'll break you all Avi and drag out.

1600
01:30:17.610 --> 01:30:19.770
The problem is no one touched him for a year.

1601
01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:24.270
Maybe with collide they would ignore him.
Yeah,
no,
I'd rather,
I'd rather,

1602
01:30:24.450 --> 01:30:27.990
I'd rather have a nice,
you know,
touched African babies

1603
01:30:29.970 --> 01:30:33.750
then some eastern European blonde,
good looking baby that's never been touched.

1604
01:30:33.751 --> 01:30:38.280
Psycho future MMA superstar.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I could see that.

1605
01:30:38.890 --> 01:30:39.900
Um,
well,
you know,

1606
01:30:40.590 --> 01:30:45.590
I think people have a natural inclination to be attracted to opposites in a way,

1607
01:30:46.450 --> 01:30:47.760
not fully opposite,

1608
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:52.710
but some aspects like I think sometimes like a stronger personality would like a

1609
01:30:52.711 --> 01:30:57.000
more submissive personality or the opposite or vice versa,
like submissive men,

1610
01:30:57.001 --> 01:31:00.090
like a dominant overbearing woman or you know,

1611
01:31:00.290 --> 01:31:03.630
but then I have friends that are very similar and they get along great too.

1612
01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:04.760
He said,
it doesn't matter.

1613
01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:08.120
Isn't the cliche though that somebody who a very powerful man,

1614
01:31:08.150 --> 01:31:10.260
we'll want to dominate tricks,
you know,

1615
01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:14.630
beat him up and shit on his chest or whatever.
Really super true.
Like A,

1616
01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:17.490
I knew a woman who was a dominatrix and she would,
uh,

1617
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:20.700
professionally beat the fuck out of these really rich guys.

1618
01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:24.660
She'd kicked him in the Dick and step on them with high heels and leave marks

1619
01:31:24.661 --> 01:31:28.380
all over and with their belt and like beat them and tag them and pee on them.

1620
01:31:28.381 --> 01:31:30.690
She would do all kinds of crazy shit to them.
Nothing about that.

1621
01:31:30.691 --> 01:31:34.020
Sounds pleasant to me.
She would,
she'd be the master.
That was part of the thing.

1622
01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.990
She's like,
I had to be,
I had to be the master.

1623
01:31:36.991 --> 01:31:40.380
Like for them it was like an opportunity that they can completely relinquish.

1624
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:42.830
And I goes,
it just playing a role like,

1625
01:31:42.831 --> 01:31:46.410
like do you think that he gets snapped at anytime and go,
no,
you fucking shut up.

1626
01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:50.160
You know?
And she's like,
no,
no.
They just,
they give into it willingly.

1627
01:31:50.161 --> 01:31:52.020
It's really amazing.
It's almost like they need it.

1628
01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:55.950
So it's like a service that she provides and it's always these like high powered

1629
01:31:55.951 --> 01:31:59.680
CEOs with their teeny little,
I imagine have teen low penises,
fat penises.

1630
01:32:00.290 --> 01:32:03.790
<v 2>They're thick.
The know,
like they're teeny,
but there's like fat that's like,
oh,</v>

1631
01:32:03.791 --> 01:32:08.460
sure.
Right,
right,
right,
right.
Under a fat dude.
Do you know about that?
No.

1632
01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:12.290
It's where your belly stick out further than your Dick to ah,

1633
01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:17.620
yeah,
I could see like a rob Ford type,
but with not that person.
He said,
look,

1634
01:32:17.621 --> 01:32:22.390
two Alpha but personality and he's got that body Jason Alexander.
Yeah,
sure.

1635
01:32:22.391 --> 01:32:25.010
Absolutely.
And he's got his tie still on the little bit,
you know,

1636
01:32:25.011 --> 01:32:29.950
and it's like Pudgy,
sort of like a filo dough type of skin,

1637
01:32:29.970 --> 01:32:32.200
like popping out of the space between,

1638
01:32:32.201 --> 01:32:34.660
with his pants around his ankle that she kicks him in the Dick and he

1639
01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:40.890
a little urine bottom,
like a pig bottom.
That's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1640
01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:45.190
Like some sort of like weird chest hair situation.

1641
01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:48.250
Definitely with asymmetrical like asymmetrical chest hair.

1642
01:32:48.290 --> 01:32:52.150
Like the left one has more hair on the right one,
just a little fat dick and,

1643
01:32:52.210 --> 01:32:54.400
but he's all rich and stuff because of his little Dick.

1644
01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:58.990
He went to business school,
master shut,
pees on his face,
shut the fuck up.

1645
01:32:58.991 --> 01:33:02.080
I knew a guy that he would,
um,
he would,
I think was,

1646
01:33:02.081 --> 01:33:03.280
I don't know if there was a woman with a man,

1647
01:33:03.281 --> 01:33:08.020
but one of them would lay underneath a glass table while the one shit on top of

1648
01:33:08.021 --> 01:33:12.550
the class day.
They told me they told you they did.
It could be not true.

1649
01:33:12.551 --> 01:33:16.030
I don't know.
I wasn't there watching,
but it seemed dynamically correct.

1650
01:33:16.031 --> 01:33:20.950
Like their dynamic was real intense.
Like he was like a big goal.
Like psycho,

1651
01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:22.150
you know,
one of those,
you know,

1652
01:33:22.151 --> 01:33:25.150
those guys that seem like they could have started a cult if they were born in it

1653
01:33:25.151 --> 01:33:28.450
in a different,
a slightly different era with a little bit more money.

1654
01:33:28.451 --> 01:33:31.090
They would have started a call.
It was like that type of dude.
Wow.

1655
01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:34.210
And she was like all sex workery and stuff.
Really?
Yeah.

1656
01:33:34.450 --> 01:33:38.800
What did he do for a living?
I can't,
he was a musician.
Oh yeah.

1657
01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:43.210
It was a strange,
strange,
strange man.
Interesting.

1658
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:44.590
A lot of very weird people out there.

1659
01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:47.950
This is a lot of very weird people here in la.
Oh,
the weirdest.

1660
01:33:47.951 --> 01:33:50.170
This is the weirdest spot because this is the spot where they think they're

1661
01:33:50.171 --> 01:33:53.380
going to finally get that attention that they deserve and sexually weird.

1662
01:33:53.410 --> 01:33:57.340
There's a lot of weird sex in it and in La.
I have one on here,
man.
Come on.

1663
01:33:57.420 --> 01:34:01.120
Me Talking about what are you doing?
Well,
I'm in a relationship now,
but uh,

1664
01:34:01.330 --> 01:34:06.310
I was very much,
I'll tell you,
I got some good stories.
Okay,
please.
This is,

1665
01:34:06.311 --> 01:34:10.450
this is a pretty good one.
Oh,
well I want to tell you though.
Okay.
Well,
one,

1666
01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:15.100
when I was starting to hit bottom,
I've gotten that some issues with sex,

1667
01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:17.830
but one real bad story was I,
there was a girl,
I was,

1668
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:20.950
I went to this clothing store and I used to be really in a big girl,

1669
01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:24.950
so very big girls.
How big,
I mean as big as you can muster.

1670
01:34:24.970 --> 01:34:29.800
Hundred plus I was into at all.
Yeah,
I like a thick girl anyway,

1671
01:34:30.010 --> 01:34:34.360
but my girl now is not very small,
but the deal with it.
No,

1672
01:34:34.361 --> 01:34:37.280
I love her and she's great and she's hot.
If we were in ski clothes,

1673
01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:40.660
sometimes I'll feed her a lot.

1674
01:34:40.661 --> 01:34:45.200
You know those relationships where there's a feeder?
Do you know about that?
No,

1675
01:34:45.900 --> 01:34:49.110
this is like where,
where the fat thing that goes,
it goes beyond just like a,

1676
01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:51.580
like I think it's hot and into like a,
like a fetish.

1677
01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:52.840
So there'll be a guy like me,

1678
01:34:52.841 --> 01:34:56.440
like a skinny kind of weekly and guy that's like bringing his fat girlfriend

1679
01:34:56.441 --> 01:34:58.100
like Twinkies and,
and,

1680
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:01.550
<v 4>and Ho Hos and roast beef and stuffing and just be like,
here honey,</v>

1681
01:35:01.551 --> 01:35:03.200
you keep eating.
And she gets bigger and bigger.

1682
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:07.100
So there's like a feeder and then there's like a big woman that just eventually

1683
01:35:07.101 --> 01:35:11.270
I guess grows and grows and grows and his erection grows with or something like

1684
01:35:11.271 --> 01:35:15.020
that.
Oh,
what now this relationship is defined.

1685
01:35:15.021 --> 01:35:17.110
Like when you say there's a type,

1686
01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:21.060
like this is defined like websites where they talk about this.

1687
01:35:21.210 --> 01:35:24.660
I mean you could look that up.
I mean I'm not a,
but is it like a,

1688
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:27.800
is there a community?
Well,
yeah,

1689
01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:30.350
I don't know if there's a community because they have to bring,
they have to get,

1690
01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:33.470
it's hard to get that many cranes to bring people to the meetings.

1691
01:35:33.471 --> 01:35:36.150
And what I mean like an online community where this is all discuss.

1692
01:35:36.170 --> 01:35:39.020
I'm sure beers.
Yeah.
No,
this is a real thing.
Have you heard of it?

1693
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:42.520
I've never heard of that.
Have you been trying this with your new girl?
No,
no,
no,

1694
01:35:42.521 --> 01:35:46.700
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no I'm not.

1695
01:35:46.701 --> 01:35:50.210
I was never like that for me was,
I mean this is like a weird psychological,

1696
01:35:50.211 --> 01:35:51.440
like I'm going to bring you food.

1697
01:35:51.441 --> 01:35:55.310
It's being dominated by one person that's passive.
I think the,
you know,
the,
the,

1698
01:35:55.311 --> 01:35:58.310
the dominatrix in this case doesn't even have to do anything but sit around and

1699
01:35:58.311 --> 01:36:02.390
eat,
you know?
That's interesting.
That's interesting.
But anyway,

1700
01:36:02.391 --> 01:36:04.640
I don't know why I even brought that up.
That's weird sex stuff.

1701
01:36:04.641 --> 01:36:08.240
So this person was,
was big and I went to the store,
she was the,

1702
01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:12.590
she was the parking attendant at the store and this is like,

1703
01:36:12.591 --> 01:36:15.800
well into comedy.
So I'm okay on some level of public figure.
I mean,

1704
01:36:15.801 --> 01:36:18.080
not like a huge public figure,
but enough that it's like,

1705
01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:22.520
I shouldn't be like at random approach.
Maybe I should,
who knows.
Anyway,

1706
01:36:22.521 --> 01:36:26.900
this girl,
she was bigger and she was the parking lot of tenant at this store.

1707
01:36:26.901 --> 01:36:31.160
And I somehow started talking to her and got her phone number and then sort of

1708
01:36:31.161 --> 01:36:31.971
texting with her.

1709
01:36:31.971 --> 01:36:36.440
And this is so I remember I had a show that night in Orange County.
I was at a,

1710
01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:40.670
I was at a,
um,
a comedy show at UC Irvine.

1711
01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:45.980
And I brought my friend Jacob Jacob sear off down to the,
down to the show.
And,

1712
01:36:45.981 --> 01:36:50.090
uh,
and she was texting with me while I was at the show in Orange County and was

1713
01:36:50.091 --> 01:36:52.400
like,
Oh,
you should've said something.
You know,

1714
01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:55.850
I would have sucked your dick in the parking lot.
And I was like,
oh,
really?

1715
01:36:56.540 --> 01:37:00.770
All activated,
like a little Dick Getting hard like that Rob Ford Guy,
you know,

1716
01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:03.920
and uh,
and she's like,
yeah,
I mean,
you know what,
you come by my house tonight.

1717
01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:07.430
I'll suck your dick tonight.
And I was like,
I was like,
where do you live?

1718
01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:12.080
And she's like,
Compton and I,
and I started doing the math and I'm like,
okay,

1719
01:37:12.081 --> 01:37:14.780
Orange County,
if I'm driving back to my home in silver lake,

1720
01:37:14.781 --> 01:37:18.950
Compton is sort of in a weird way on the way.
So I,
I fucking get rid of Jacob,

1721
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:22.360
you know,
I go,
I say to some other comic like,
can you please give it a checkup,

1722
01:37:22.361 --> 01:37:26.120
a boat ride home?
I've got an erection right now.
And uh,
like,
uh,
okay.

1723
01:37:26.121 --> 01:37:29.180
Like I don't tell anybody what's going on.
My friend,
my good friend Jacob,

1724
01:37:29.181 --> 01:37:31.370
he's like,
why are you sloughing me off on this stranger?

1725
01:37:31.371 --> 01:37:32.330
Who's going to give him a ride home?
I was like,

1726
01:37:32.370 --> 01:37:35.800
and he's got some business to take care of it.
It's like,
it's 1130 at night.
What?

1727
01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:37.940
But he's a pervert too.
So I'm driving,

1728
01:37:37.941 --> 01:37:41.690
I pull off the exit and Compton where this girl says she's going to suck my dick

1729
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:46.820
and I start driving through Compton and it's getting weirder and weirder and

1730
01:37:46.821 --> 01:37:49.820
worse and worse the further I go and I keep texting her and she's like,

1731
01:37:49.821 --> 01:37:51.110
keep going,
keep going.

1732
01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:56.310
And I pulled down this alley and it's like an abandoned alley and it's like,

1733
01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:58.890
it's like you want to talk about having two different brains.

1734
01:37:58.891 --> 01:38:03.090
You know what I mean?
Like I knew my brain,
my good brain,

1735
01:38:03.091 --> 01:38:06.870
my big brain was telling me like your going to be murdered.

1736
01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:10.320
This is a situation where you're,
I'm driving down an alley.

1737
01:38:10.321 --> 01:38:14.580
There's an empty field on one side,
there's like tract housing on the other side.

1738
01:38:14.581 --> 01:38:18.510
Like it's,
there's no street lights.
She's,
and she keeps going.
Keep going,

1739
01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:22.620
keep going.
I'm at the end of the,
at the end of this alley I'm waiting for you.

1740
01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:24.900
Keep going.
I just know I'm going to get there.

1741
01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:28.740
Her brothers are going to come out,
surround the car.
Dude,
I'm dead.

1742
01:38:28.970 --> 01:38:29.970
My car's dead.

1743
01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:34.240
And I keep driving forward because I have this other brain that's like this.

1744
01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:38.770
A little Ayp,
Bonobo brain that's going like the end of this road.
There's a blow.

1745
01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:42.960
Keep track of a weights.
I swear you couldn't.

1746
01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:47.850
There is no place in la that's more well suited to murder a white person then

1747
01:38:47.851 --> 01:38:52.140
this alley.
Wow.
So how's it going down?
She comes outside,

1748
01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:57.620
take a deep breath,
she gets in the car and she gives me a blow job.
And

1749
01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:04.800
when you came,
was it like the most like sneaky coming ever?

1750
01:39:04.801 --> 01:39:08.010
Like oh good,
good,
good,
good,
good,
good,
good,
good.

1751
01:39:08.970 --> 01:39:12.240
The ignition was already on.
Oh,
the other crazy thing is she lives in,

1752
01:39:12.450 --> 01:39:13.480
she lives in Compton.

1753
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:17.850
One of the first thing she says before she starts giving me head is uh Oh yeah,

1754
01:39:17.851 --> 01:39:20.250
I love sucking Dick.
I'll suck anybody's dick except for,

1755
01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:23.310
and then she just drops an end bomb like a heart.
And I'm like,

1756
01:39:23.311 --> 01:39:27.240
you live in Compton's and my other,
again,
two brains,
my brain is like,

1757
01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:30.510
don't comment on the racism.
Don't comment on the racism shit.
Come on.

1758
01:39:30.511 --> 01:39:34.110
She's about to give you a blowjob.
Don't even,
and I didn't,
I focused,

1759
01:39:34.111 --> 01:39:37.740
I focused up through it.
Wow.

1760
01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:41.040
Was that the last time you saw her?
Yeah,
that's the last time I saw it.

1761
01:39:41.070 --> 01:39:45.840
Did you change your phone number?
I,
I,
wait,
I'm lying to you.
No,

1762
01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:49.240
I changed my,
I raced the phone number,
uh,

1763
01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:52.500
and told her I have a girlfriend now.
It didn't have a girlfriend.

1764
01:39:52.530 --> 01:39:54.000
I have a girlfriend now raced her phone number.

1765
01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:58.230
Then I w like maybe six months later I drove by that place again.

1766
01:39:58.440 --> 01:39:59.670
God or phone number again.

1767
01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:02.700
Started texting with her and then I've raced her phone number and never,

1768
01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:03.653
I never went back.

1769
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:12.720
She was big.
She was like two to 50 probably.

1770
01:40:12.970 --> 01:40:15.720
Since you've been with a lot of big girls.
Uh,
yeah.

1771
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:18.820
Have you ever had any kind of cleaning problems where they smell more like poop

1772
01:40:18.821 --> 01:40:21.540
or does that get you like a bigger boner when you smell that?

1773
01:40:21.541 --> 01:40:24.800
Cause I mean they don't smell the best is a serious question about that.

1774
01:40:25.050 --> 01:40:26.520
It seems like a serious question.

1775
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:31.110
He's throwing Ibogaine at me as he asks for that.
Um,
no.
I mean,

1776
01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:35.700
you know people fat people shower.
Yeah.
Okay.
But I hear what you're saying.

1777
01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:38.460
They can't get all those nooks and crannies of,

1778
01:40:38.461 --> 01:40:40.830
you're talking about the big 50 is not that big bro.
Yeah.

1779
01:40:40.831 --> 01:40:43.920
I mean I'm talking about like five hundreds and Ralphie may size.

1780
01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:48.130
I know I have fucked her off.
He may refer him is a good guy to fuck.
Yeah,

1781
01:40:48.150 --> 01:40:50.160
I bet he is.
Actually you guys,

1782
01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:54.010
there was another girl when I first moved to town that she was like,
uh,

1783
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:58.480
she was like a kind of,
she was real intense.
Speaking of power dynamics,
she was,

1784
01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:01.810
she's a kind of girl.
She kept going like,
put your cigarette out on me,

1785
01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:06.970
put your cigarette out on this Christ.
And I was like,
I can't,
I don't,

1786
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.430
I don't think I can do that.
And she would be like,

1787
01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:14.700
she was very aggressive and pain oriented and she was biting me and like biting

1788
01:41:15.371 --> 01:41:19.360
my Dick and biting my balls.
Oh God.
But it was also hot,

1789
01:41:19.361 --> 01:41:23.450
but also I didn't like the biting part and be like,
oh,
stop out.
And uh,

1790
01:41:23.530 --> 01:41:26.820
at one point she doesn't called Jewish like that now stop out.

1791
01:41:27.510 --> 01:41:30.310
And at one point she looks down,
she's like going down.
I mean,

1792
01:41:30.311 --> 01:41:32.920
she stops and she goes,
what is that?
And you know,
the kind of,

1793
01:41:32.921 --> 01:41:34.210
what is that the way you would say?

1794
01:41:34.211 --> 01:41:36.450
Like if you were going down on a girl and you saw like a,

1795
01:41:36.610 --> 01:41:39.250
some sort of sore or something.
And I'm like,
what?

1796
01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:42.400
And I look and there is a contusion,

1797
01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:45.430
like a straight up like bubbles,

1798
01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:50.200
blood blister on my scrotum from her biting you from her bite.
I say,

1799
01:41:50.201 --> 01:41:55.060
you fucking did that and she's,
and then afterwards she was like,

1800
01:41:55.150 --> 01:41:58.870
that was great.
We should do it again.
And I texted her,
I was like,
I don't know.

1801
01:41:58.871 --> 01:42:02.830
I think you maybe play it a little too rough for me.
And she goes,
uh,
okay.

1802
01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:08.590
She's like,
no,
like all dial it back.
No like,
oh,
let's try.
It was just like,

1803
01:42:08.591 --> 01:42:13.060
if you can't fucking ride the dragon with the scales that I have,
then get off.

1804
01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:17.230
God Damn Man,
Jesus Christ.
I got more.

1805
01:42:17.890 --> 01:42:20.260
Have you ever had the color like the next day where you're like,

1806
01:42:20.261 --> 01:42:24.630
why is my back and you just look on your back and he's just like,
Oh yeah,

1807
01:42:25.570 --> 01:42:27.820
I've had that,
but that's sort of normal.

1808
01:42:27.821 --> 01:42:31.070
That's girls just getting caught up in the throes of passion.
That's tight.

1809
01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:36.070
That seems good.
That's why I ramping down.
You're screwed.

1810
01:42:36.430 --> 01:42:39.130
I had other,
I had,
I've had sexual,
I don't know if you've,

1811
01:42:39.190 --> 01:42:40.270
you don't seem like you've had,

1812
01:42:40.370 --> 01:42:44.800
because you seem like you've been having fun sex experiences your whole life.

1813
01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:47.560
What makes you say that?
Just like,
you know,

1814
01:42:47.561 --> 01:42:49.060
you're like good looking and you've been,

1815
01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:51.700
you've been famous for a long time and it's,
you feel like,

1816
01:42:51.701 --> 01:42:54.520
you think this only fun sex that well,
no.
What?
I feel like,

1817
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:57.580
I feel like you're the type of dude that likes to have sex only with good

1818
01:42:57.581 --> 01:43:01.480
looking women.
Yeah,
I'm crazy like that.
Yeah.

1819
01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:05.320
You're lucky to have her in a sexual deviant and that way.
No,
but there's like,

1820
01:43:05.321 --> 01:43:05.681
for me,

1821
01:43:05.681 --> 01:43:09.660
I used to get off on like hooking up with people that were not as a truck.
I,

1822
01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:14.440
it was hot purpose.
It was hot,
you know?
I would find hot to them.
Yeah.

1823
01:43:14.441 --> 01:43:18.670
And I would find a objective attractiveness in people that weren't objectively

1824
01:43:18.671 --> 01:43:20.800
attractive.
Does that make sense?

1825
01:43:21.090 --> 01:43:25.200
<v 1>Yeah.
So,
okay.
So what we were talking about earlier,
like that's your,
your kink.</v>

1826
01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:27.060
So like the drug thing,

1827
01:43:27.061 --> 01:43:30.930
whatever led you to be an impulsive drug person led you for a while to be an

1828
01:43:30.931 --> 01:43:35.590
impro impulsive sex person.
So wasn't even almost a natural sort of attraction.

1829
01:43:35.591 --> 01:43:39.770
Like,
wow,
that's a pretty girl.
She likes me.
I like her,
I love her personality.

1830
01:43:39.771 --> 01:43:40.860
You didn't even like her personality.

1831
01:43:40.861 --> 01:43:43.330
She's talking about dropping bombs for one second

1832
01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:47.430
<v 4>mega decks.
She said,
you'll like us still.</v>

1833
01:43:47.431 --> 01:43:50.460
There's something about you that's hot.
Interestingly enough though,

1834
01:43:50.461 --> 01:43:53.600
I actually have,
oh yeah,
it's real big and black.

1835
01:43:53.601 --> 01:43:57.290
But where it was a shocker to her.
Yeah,
she was really bummed.
But

1836
01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:01.460
there was a guy with a slight trauma

1837
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:08.930
everyday,
look where I live.
Uh Yeah,
no,
for sure.
That became the thing.

1838
01:44:08.931 --> 01:44:12.110
And it also is very compartmentalized.
I would be like in a store.

1839
01:44:12.111 --> 01:44:16.400
I remember one instance in particular was at this store at like two o'clock in

1840
01:44:16.401 --> 01:44:17.750
the morning shopping for,

1841
01:44:17.751 --> 01:44:21.740
I was at Safeway getting some groceries and this woman walked around the corner

1842
01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:24.890
and she was big and in the way that I liked and I started,

1843
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:28.010
I did you ever get like,
have you ever gotten so horny you start getting cold?

1844
01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:30.980
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
Little shivery I,

1845
01:44:30.990 --> 01:44:32.330
I'm not even flirting with this woman.

1846
01:44:32.331 --> 01:44:35.180
She's just a woman's shopping at two in the morning for fucking cheese whiz or

1847
01:44:35.181 --> 01:44:38.040
whatever.
And I'm like,
I gotta figure out a way to,

1848
01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:42.050
can you imagine if I walked up to her with a shivering like a two in the
morning?

1849
01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:46.580
Like,
Hey,
how are you?
There's no way she's fucking mate.
That's go so crazy.

1850
01:44:46.581 --> 01:44:49.280
Cause it's just cause she's big or something.

1851
01:44:49.890 --> 01:44:52.500
<v 1>Yeah.
Something.
What else could it be if it wasn't the big thing?</v>

1852
01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:54.300
<v 4>No,
I guess you're right.
It's a big,</v>

1853
01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:57.510
I mean that's when it would get the most pronounced.

1854
01:44:58.260 --> 01:45:02.040
It was pretty intense.
Wow.
That's amazing.

1855
01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:06.450
I've had sex where I lie sold after the woman left cause he thought I was

1856
01:45:06.451 --> 01:45:08.460
rational.
You thought it was rational?
No,

1857
01:45:08.461 --> 01:45:10.710
cause I know she was like scratching this area of her body.

1858
01:45:11.070 --> 01:45:14.700
When she left I was like freaked out so hard.
But I went into my bathroom,

1859
01:45:14.701 --> 01:45:18.700
I started Lysol with my legs like shape and then dish soap and then salt.

1860
01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:20.730
And the next day I,
speaking of 12 step meetings,

1861
01:45:20.731 --> 01:45:25.200
I went to my first and only sex addicts anonymous meeting.
I was just like,

1862
01:45:25.201 --> 01:45:26.320
something's got to change

1863
01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:35.220
to look at your face was awesome.
But you know there's no,

1864
01:45:35.221 --> 01:45:37.800
there's very little way for you to convince yourself that you're just like a

1865
01:45:37.801 --> 01:45:39.810
young man swinging around,
having a good time,

1866
01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:42.540
engaging in the regular sexuality of all human beings.

1867
01:45:42.690 --> 01:45:47.400
When you're spraying Lysol.
I'm
like,
how do you,

1868
01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:52.470
oh that's awesome.
So I went and one of the things about s sex,

1869
01:45:52.650 --> 01:45:55.610
well the first thing I realized when I got to a sex addicts anonymous meeting is

1870
01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:59.610
I may have a problem or something.
I may have a compulsive sexuality,

1871
01:45:59.790 --> 01:46:01.830
but I don't have what these people have.
I mean,

1872
01:46:01.831 --> 01:46:03.870
there was something else that they're talking about.

1873
01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:06.090
What were they talking about?
They were talking about,
I'll look,

1874
01:46:06.091 --> 01:46:10.470
I'll start looking at pornography at 4:00 PM and then all of a sudden the sun

1875
01:46:10.471 --> 01:46:14.700
will be coming up.
Whoa.
And I was like,
oh.
Or like I,

1876
01:46:15.090 --> 01:46:19.230
I had a home,
but I took all of my money and spent it on prostitutes,
you know,

1877
01:46:19.231 --> 01:46:22.170
that kind of thing.
Wow.
It was very intense.

1878
01:46:22.171 --> 01:46:24.660
It was stuff that I did not really fully relate.

1879
01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:25.361
<v 1>Well,</v>

1880
01:46:25.361 --> 01:46:30.361
there's definitely mental illnesses that are connected to weird sexual behavior.

1881
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:35.320
Like there was an,
an episode of this podcast that I talk about all the time.

1882
01:46:35.321 --> 01:46:39.430
My new favorite podcast is radio lab.
Oh yeah,
sure.
Great podcast is really good,

1883
01:46:39.431 --> 01:46:42.550
amazing stuff.
Really interesting and fascinating subjects.

1884
01:46:42.551 --> 01:46:43.810
And it's always food for thought.

1885
01:46:44.620 --> 01:46:49.560
And they had one about a guy who had epilepsy and just fascinating.

1886
01:46:49.650 --> 01:46:54.440
So he was having all these tumors and they offered a surgery to fix this,
uh,

1887
01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:56.490
not tumors.
Um,
seizures rather.

1888
01:46:56.520 --> 01:47:01.520
And e they offered a surgery to fix the seizures and he accepted it.

1889
01:47:01.890 --> 01:47:04.020
And when they gave him the surgery,

1890
01:47:04.021 --> 01:47:09.021
it turned him into this weird sex addict who wanted food all the time,

1891
01:47:09.841 --> 01:47:10.770
wanted sex all the time,

1892
01:47:10.771 --> 01:47:14.680
but could not stop downloading pornography child including child pornography.

1893
01:47:14.681 --> 01:47:18.570
Yeah.
And could,
he would erase it and they would download it again and erase it.

1894
01:47:18.630 --> 01:47:23.630
And the way the neurologist described it is the area of his brain that was

1895
01:47:24.841 --> 01:47:29.841
removed literally is the area that controls impulsive decisions when it comes to

1896
01:47:30.901 --> 01:47:34.860
sexuality and needs and,
and any,
any desires there.

1897
01:47:34.861 --> 01:47:37.980
There's a part of all of us that like,
you know,

1898
01:47:37.981 --> 01:47:42.510
like think Barbara has a joke about it,
but you ever see a role,

1899
01:47:42.511 --> 01:47:45.630
people in the street and you drive and you go ahead and just fucking could turn

1900
01:47:45.631 --> 01:47:49.840
right now and are all these people over.
Like everybody's had those thoughts.
We,

1901
01:47:49.841 --> 01:47:51.660
no one ever does anything but like me,

1902
01:47:51.661 --> 01:47:55.590
I would see like a really frail old person and I would say I could just kick

1903
01:47:55.591 --> 01:47:59.700
this guy's head right off of his body just out of nowhere.
Just kick his head.

1904
01:47:59.701 --> 01:48:03.780
Right.
And I would not do it ever.
I would never even think about doing it.

1905
01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:07.860
But the thought is I bet that I could do that.
I bet I just,

1906
01:48:07.861 --> 01:48:09.810
we'll kick this guy in the head out of nowhere.

1907
01:48:09.930 --> 01:48:14.340
Imagine if you're like a hundred year old man.
You just,
I always think about

1908
01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:19.120
<v 4>I leaping like you kick it with my do.
Does that make sense?</v>

1909
01:48:20.170 --> 01:48:22.390
Yeah.
Just across a room.
Yeah.

1910
01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:25.210
And then I tried to someone just to see what everybody else would be doing.

1911
01:48:25.211 --> 01:48:26.890
We'll do like what did he,
why,
what the

1912
01:48:27.090 --> 01:48:30.020
<v 1>right,
but you would never do it.
And that's the idea is that we all,</v>

1913
01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:35.030
because people have good decision making capabilities and because people have

1914
01:48:35.031 --> 01:48:37.910
ethics and morals and you know,
and because you're nice,

1915
01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:41.260
you never do anything bad like that,
but that these thoughts are just,

1916
01:48:41.630 --> 01:48:44.930
they can come in your head randomly and why,
why do they come up?

1917
01:48:44.931 --> 01:48:49.310
Because you know that is a possibility that in some weird bizarro universe,

1918
01:48:49.311 --> 01:48:53.420
somebody might punch this old guy for no reason or that somebody might turn

1919
01:48:53.421 --> 01:48:56.190
their car into a crowd and stomp on the gas.
It's,
it is.

1920
01:48:56.420 --> 01:48:58.640
So you don't really think about doing it,

1921
01:48:58.641 --> 01:49:00.740
but you think that could be something that someone does,

1922
01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:03.890
but this poor fucking guy was doing things like he was like,

1923
01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:06.800
he couldn't help well with the child pornography.

1924
01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:07.361
<v 4>Yeah.
Well the,</v>

1925
01:49:07.361 --> 01:49:11.230
the part that what they said was the part that they removed from him was the Po,

1926
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:14.390
the regulated,
that phone when you had the thought,
then your next thought is,

1927
01:49:14.391 --> 01:49:15.290
well of course I shouldn't,

1928
01:49:15.291 --> 01:49:18.560
we all kick this old man's head because that would be a mean thing to do and I

1929
01:49:18.561 --> 01:49:19.910
would go to jail and that's wrong.

1930
01:49:20.210 --> 01:49:25.210
But there's literal biological mass in your brain that is the part that tells

1931
01:49:25.671 --> 01:49:27.710
you that second thought,
which is don't do that.

1932
01:49:27.890 --> 01:49:31.970
So this guy's went away and it a regulated sexual compulsivity

1933
01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:36.920
<v 1>yeah.
And,
and,
and hunger as well.
Right.
It's designed for,
remember that part?
Yeah.</v>

1934
01:49:36.921 --> 01:49:41.470
They were talking about just hate,
like a wild man.
Just couldn't stop eating.
Um,

1935
01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:45.110
but the weird thing was,
and this is why they,

1936
01:49:45.170 --> 01:49:48.100
the judge recognized that the neurologist is correct.

1937
01:49:48.610 --> 01:49:50.620
<v 4>If there was an issue in this guy had to deal with it,</v>

1938
01:49:50.621 --> 01:49:54.550
but they still sentence him to jail because he didn't have anything on his

1939
01:49:54.551 --> 01:49:58.060
computer at work who's able to control himself at work and not in the rest of

1940
01:49:58.061 --> 01:50:02.170
his life.
So it showed some sort of a possibility of control.
Yeah.

1941
01:50:02.430 --> 01:50:04.690
I thought I found that to be fascinating.

1942
01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:07.990
It is pretty fascinating because I agree with it and sort of a weird way,

1943
01:50:08.350 --> 01:50:11.500
but he knew that they were there because what the thing was,

1944
01:50:11.501 --> 01:50:14.740
it wasn't just that he downloaded pornography is that he paid for it,

1945
01:50:15.130 --> 01:50:16.810
and by showing that he paid for it,

1946
01:50:16.811 --> 01:50:20.830
it's even worse because then you're supporting child pornography.
Right.

1947
01:50:20.831 --> 01:50:23.560
The other thing I thought was really fascinating was the part afterwards where

1948
01:50:23.561 --> 01:50:24.640
they started saying,
wow,

1949
01:50:24.641 --> 01:50:29.620
isn't that interesting that these kinds of aberrations could be caused by just a

1950
01:50:29.621 --> 01:50:33.010
biological,
literal physical hardware of your brain,

1951
01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:36.730
and this brain doctor came on.
It was the second guy afterwards.

1952
01:50:36.731 --> 01:50:38.650
I don't know if you remember this part,
and he was like,

1953
01:50:38.740 --> 01:50:42.850
that's what everything is.
Every thing,
every climb,
every behavior,

1954
01:50:42.851 --> 01:50:46.630
every positive thing,
your comedy.
Some that kids murder.

1955
01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:50.920
It's all biological.
It's all from the in moment you're born,

1956
01:50:51.070 --> 01:50:53.220
you're born and this thing happens or,

1957
01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:55.600
or this kind of chemical dump happens in your brain.

1958
01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:58.420
There's nothing that's occurring that isn't biological.

1959
01:50:58.421 --> 01:51:02.320
No human behavior isn't directly related to the biology of your brain.

1960
01:51:02.410 --> 01:51:06.760
So that kid,
so that dude looking at child pornography and that kid in,

1961
01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:07.810
in Santa Barbara,

1962
01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:12.840
all of those are related to the biological realities of that kid's brain,

1963
01:51:13.150 --> 01:51:14.320
of those people's brains.

1964
01:51:14.650 --> 01:51:19.180
And that therefore this person started saying this was the craziest part.
He,

1965
01:51:19.181 --> 01:51:21.070
they were saying,
well then shouldn't we,

1966
01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:25.000
should we let a person off because of what happened?

1967
01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:27.280
So we let the person off from going to prison because of what happened in their

1968
01:51:27.281 --> 01:51:28.120
brain's biologically.

1969
01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:32.020
And he was saying that's the wrong question because all crimes and all behaviors

1970
01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:34.240
as a result of what's happening in your brain biologically.

1971
01:51:34.450 --> 01:51:38.560
So the way that we should convict people of crimes is how likely they are based

1972
01:51:38.561 --> 01:51:42.760
upon their biology to commit a crime again is literally like time crimes or

1973
01:51:42.761 --> 01:51:47.050
whatever crime that's like minority report type shit.
Exactly.

1974
01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:49.480
And he's literally saying,
you can look at it,
you can say,

1975
01:51:49.630 --> 01:51:53.080
this guy's brain does this,
this,
and this.
He's therefore this likely to,
uh,

1976
01:51:53.110 --> 01:51:56.020
to recommit a crime.
Therefore he should go to prison for this amount of time.

1977
01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:01.540
Wow.
How sketchy.
Well,
that actually,

1978
01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:05.440
I actually think that that is something that could happen in the foreseeable

1979
01:52:05.441 --> 01:52:08.650
future.
Everybody talks about these mass shootings and they go,
oh,

1980
01:52:08.651 --> 01:52:11.510
well it's mental illness.
That's the problem.
The problem,
you know,

1981
01:52:11.511 --> 01:52:13.740
it's especially people that don't want to deal with,
you know,

1982
01:52:13.810 --> 01:52:16.990
whether or not gun control should be in this conversation.
And we'll say,
well,

1983
01:52:16.991 --> 01:52:19.180
it's mental illness.
We should focus on mental illness.

1984
01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:22.570
But the problem is there's no way to focus on mental illness as it pertains to

1985
01:52:22.571 --> 01:52:26.320
mass shootings.
You can't go up to a crazy person and say,
you seem crazy.

1986
01:52:26.530 --> 01:52:29.980
You go to the comedy store any night of the week and go and you just round up

1987
01:52:29.981 --> 01:52:33.010
like you know the the craziest 5% and then go,

1988
01:52:33.011 --> 01:52:35.560
they seem like they might shoot someone and there's no way to know until the

1989
01:52:35.561 --> 01:52:38.800
shooting someone and they go,
oh,
they were crazy enough to shoot someone.
I mean,

1990
01:52:38.801 --> 01:52:41.530
how can you look at a crazy person and think,
oh,

1991
01:52:41.531 --> 01:52:46.340
that guy's a shooter kind of crazy and not a harmless screamer on the street.

1992
01:52:46.341 --> 01:52:47.180
Kind of crazy person.

1993
01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:49.480
<v 1>Yeah,
it's impossible.
The any,</v>

1994
01:52:49.690 --> 01:52:54.280
anybody that doesn't want some sort of background checks on anybody that wants

1995
01:52:54.281 --> 01:52:58.510
to buy a weapon,
you a part of a huge problem.
Huge,
huge problem.

1996
01:52:58.750 --> 01:53:02.950
And the idea of is in the NRA idea is their philosophy,
I believe.

1997
01:53:02.951 --> 01:53:05.320
And it's not that they're not for any sort of checking,

1998
01:53:05.321 --> 01:53:07.930
but therefore a minimal amount of checking because they think that if you give

1999
01:53:07.931 --> 01:53:10.870
up a certain amount of rights that the government will never give those rights

2000
01:53:10.871 --> 01:53:12.070
back.
So they sit,

2001
01:53:12.250 --> 01:53:16.240
they stand and they dig their heels in the ground and they don't want anything

2002
01:53:16.270 --> 01:53:20.830
other than looser and more,
more freedom when it comes to drugs.

2003
01:53:20.850 --> 01:53:25.270
When it comes to guns,
rather like a Georgia,
the recent thing that they passed,

2004
01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:26.290
they uh,

2005
01:53:26.290 --> 01:53:30.010
they changed their gun laws and they made their gun laws like less restrictive

2006
01:53:30.430 --> 01:53:34.300
and people are freaking out.
Like I should probably Google exactly what it is.
Um,

2007
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:39.160
but the uh,
people are just going nutty about these,
these gun laws.

2008
01:53:39.210 --> 01:53:42.000
<v 3>Well this Elliot Guy,
he,
you know,
he bought his guns and he,</v>

2009
01:53:42.001 --> 01:53:47.001
he also had 400 rounds of ammunition on him and he had also two psychiatrists.

2010
01:53:47.761 --> 01:53:51.990
So it seems like that should be information should have been shared with.

2011
01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:57.060
And also I just found his Twitter and you know how I was saying how he seemed

2012
01:53:57.120 --> 01:53:58.950
maybe cause he was so rich and stuff.

2013
01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:01.860
I had this like really good feeling of like American psycho.

2014
01:54:01.861 --> 01:54:04.110
You ever see that movie?
He had like the same kind of voice.

2015
01:54:04.380 --> 01:54:07.230
But look who is following on Twitter,
Hugo boss,

2016
01:54:07.231 --> 01:54:12.000
BMW Four Seasons Hotel and SB city college.
It's four frames.

2017
01:54:12.090 --> 01:54:16.800
<v 1>Wow.
He was falling for people for Pete and Hugo boss.
He's into rich,</v>

2018
01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:17.720
rich people thing.

2019
01:54:17.890 --> 01:54:22.300
<v 4>Yeah.
I mean,
yeah,
it's,
it's really scary.
I'd be scared.</v>

2020
01:54:22.330 --> 01:54:27.160
There's no way.
There is no way to know this kid.
There's a million kids.

2021
01:54:27.161 --> 01:54:29.770
Exactly.
Like that guy that never shoot people.

2022
01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:33.430
They just are crazy and make videos in their car and they even make videos.

2023
01:54:33.580 --> 01:54:35.260
By the way.
His parents called the police and said,

2024
01:54:35.261 --> 01:54:36.910
we think our kids going to do something crazy.

2025
01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:40.750
And the police came and investigated it and we're like,
well,
uh,
we'll,

2026
01:54:40.751 --> 01:54:42.220
we'll be back when your suit some people.

2027
01:54:42.620 --> 01:54:47.300
<v 3>Yeah.
But the police didn't go,
okay,
your parents are worried psychiatrist.
Oh,</v>

2028
01:54:47.301 --> 01:54:51.170
and we have you on record for buying 400 rounds of ammunition.

2029
01:54:51.171 --> 01:54:54.050
Maybe we should look further into this.
This is what,

2030
01:54:54.170 --> 01:54:57.230
<v 1>this is what they changed in Georgia.
This is really fascinating.</v>

2031
01:54:57.231 --> 01:54:59.310
And the idea is that itch it,

2032
01:54:59.420 --> 01:55:04.420
what it's gonna do is it's going to allow the people who have shown that they

2033
01:55:05.181 --> 01:55:09.650
have guns and uh,
and don't have never committed crimes with them,

2034
01:55:10.130 --> 01:55:14.000
that it protects the basic constitutional rights of the roughly 5% of Georgia

2035
01:55:14.001 --> 01:55:16.490
residency's who hold licensed to carry weapons.

2036
01:55:17.150 --> 01:55:20.690
It says that the law gives added protections to those who have played by the

2037
01:55:20.691 --> 01:55:25.250
rules and who can protect themselves from others from those who don't play by

2038
01:55:25.251 --> 01:55:28.850
the rules.
They said,
now this is,
this is what it allows them.
Broadly speaking,

2039
01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:29.713
they're saying,
um,

2040
01:55:30.020 --> 01:55:34.700
you're allowed to carry a gun in bars and associated parking facilities through,

2041
01:55:34.730 --> 01:55:35.563
through gun.

2042
01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:40.280
Though gun holders can be forced to leave upon notice by the property owner.

2043
01:55:40.850 --> 01:55:44.340
Government buildings going to be allowed to bring a gun into government

2044
01:55:44.341 --> 01:55:48.660
buildings.
Wow.
Places of worship.
Okay.

2045
01:55:48.690 --> 01:55:52.500
Only with the Express Pr,
uh,
approval.
Wow.

2046
01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:55.500
School safety zones,

2047
01:55:55.530 --> 01:56:00.530
school functions or on school provided transportation or brother.

2048
01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:05.640
That means a kid who's 18 years old who's a senior in high school who has a

2049
01:56:05.641 --> 01:56:09.720
license to carry a gun,
could carry a gun on the fucking school bus,

2050
01:56:09.790 --> 01:56:13.900
<v 2>but by wrong,
if they start shooting,</v>

2051
01:56:13.930 --> 01:56:18.190
you can revoke their permission to use the gun.
That's nice.
Excuse me.
Excuse me,

2052
01:56:18.191 --> 01:56:20.980
sir.
You're going to have to leave the bus and they'll immediately get up.

2053
01:56:21.170 --> 01:56:22.610
<v 1>Bill expands the state stand,</v>

2054
01:56:22.611 --> 01:56:26.510
your ground law aversion of which rose to prominence with the Trayvon Martin

2055
01:56:26.511 --> 01:56:30.480
case.
Wow.
You know what?
Fire Oh,

2056
01:56:30.481 --> 01:56:34.110
here it gets even crazier.
Firearm dealers are no longer a,

2057
01:56:34.130 --> 01:56:38.330
they'd no longer need to maintain records of sales and purchases for state

2058
01:56:38.331 --> 01:56:39.164
purposes.

2059
01:56:40.130 --> 01:56:42.890
<v 2>That just seems arbitrary and terrible.</v>

2060
01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:46.770
<v 1>Why would you not want to have records of who's who's buying guns?</v>

2061
01:56:46.771 --> 01:56:49.110
If someone is buying guns every week,

2062
01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:52.800
<v 2>hey man,
you have a million guns.
Like what are you planning?
I mean,</v>

2063
01:56:52.801 --> 01:56:56.190
I understand their point.
If you,
I always try with these,

2064
01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:59.400
with these issues to put my brain and the brain of the people that are making

2065
01:56:59.401 --> 01:57:01.200
the argument.
I guess I understand the point.

2066
01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:04.290
They really don't think that guns are the problem and they really think that

2067
01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:08.610
experimenting with gun control laws to try to solve a problem that isn't,

2068
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:12.290
that isn't solvable through gun control,
we'll just all,

2069
01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:15.090
the only result it will have is that people's guns will get taken away.

2070
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:19.800
And if you think that gun controlled won't solve any of these problems and it

2071
01:57:19.801 --> 01:57:24.210
just becomes you versus the government controlling your guns and look at these

2072
01:57:24.270 --> 01:57:28.920
fat white guys that are so happy that this law is getting signed.

2073
01:57:28.921 --> 01:57:31.680
Have you seen the pictures of the guys bringing in machine guns and into

2074
01:57:31.681 --> 01:57:35.730
chipotle a what?
You got to check that out.
It's because of this,
this law.

2075
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.770
But it's just these like big virgin like call of duty type dudes would
literally,

2076
01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:43.890
I mean with straight up ar 15 is like strapped to their shoulders,

2077
01:57:43.891 --> 01:57:48.550
ordering to poet.
It's just like a weird,
just because they can now.
Yeah.

2078
01:57:48.850 --> 01:57:53.490
It's like a big customers not to bring their guns.
Pull it up,

2079
01:57:53.491 --> 01:57:55.390
put it up,
put on images cause there's

2080
01:57:55.650 --> 01:57:59.820
<v 1>ridiculous.
I need to see that cue.
The backlash.</v>

2081
01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:06.330
<v 2>Oh we're so crazy.
See?
Oh Jesus.
There they are.</v>

2082
01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:10.520
Look at that dude.
Look at that dude.

2083
01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:15.820
Look at the just absolute drought of Pussy that that guy has had in his life.

2084
01:58:16.101 --> 01:58:21.080
Look,
his gun,
his,
his penis.
I am never going to Atlanta.
Did you are chicken?

2085
01:58:21.140 --> 01:58:23.790
That's so crazy.
Look at his shoulder harness and everything.
God,

2086
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:27.440
can you imagine going into topos lay and that's how that's going on.
Wow.

2087
01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:29.840
I can unfortunately,
I can imagine,

2088
01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:33.290
but you know what's weird about it is it is an American problem because I've

2089
01:58:33.291 --> 01:58:38.150
been to Israel a bunch and although Israel obviously has problems that are not

2090
01:58:38.151 --> 01:58:41.770
connected to gun control,
sending stuff,
leaving that issue aside

2091
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:46.510
<v 4>because of the sociopolitical realities of Israel.
People have guns all the time.</v>

2092
01:58:46.750 --> 01:58:49.870
They're in restaurants or in synagogues.
Everybody has guns.

2093
01:58:49.871 --> 01:58:53.050
There's open carry everywhere and it doesn't feel weird and it doesn't,

2094
01:58:53.051 --> 01:58:56.030
there's not people shooting up random indiscriminate.
Yeah.

2095
01:58:56.650 --> 01:58:58.330
<v 0>That's because they have a common enemy.</v>

2096
01:58:58.790 --> 01:59:02.720
<v 4>It could be because there is violence there all the time and that actually makes</v>

2097
01:59:02.810 --> 01:59:04.970
it feel,
pardon me,
it makes sense.

2098
01:59:05.150 --> 01:59:08.150
When a Palestinian comes into Israel and shoots up a bunch of Israelis,

2099
01:59:08.330 --> 01:59:12.710
that terror makes sense because there's an ideology behind it as opposed to just

2100
01:59:12.711 --> 01:59:15.650
some random dude's firing into a,
into a school.

2101
01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:20.450
And so maybe it takes away the impulse of the Israeli people and the Palestinian

2102
01:59:20.451 --> 01:59:24.770
people to do indiscriminate violence.
But every time you start doing this,

2103
01:59:24.771 --> 01:59:28.610
like is it,
is it,
uh,
is it gun?
Too many guns?

2104
01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:31.100
We'll know because there are countries that have just as many,

2105
01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:34.730
many guns that aren't,
that don't have these indiscriminate shootings.

2106
01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:38.570
Is it because of violent video games will know because Japan and Korea play more

2107
01:59:38.571 --> 01:59:42.500
video games and we do it and they don't do this as much.
It starts to breath.

2108
01:59:42.530 --> 01:59:44.120
Bend your mind like what it,

2109
01:59:44.150 --> 01:59:48.920
what is it exactly about America that has all these shootings all the time and

2110
01:59:48.921 --> 01:59:49.760
why so often?

2111
01:59:50.350 --> 01:59:53.500
<v 0>Yeah.
Why?
I think nationalism is a bad thing,</v>

2112
01:59:53.890 --> 01:59:57.130
but nationalism in the case where everybody bands together and everybody's nicer

2113
01:59:57.131 --> 02:00:01.000
to each other because you're also all fellow Israelites.

2114
02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:02.351
What'd you call yourself?

2115
02:00:02.351 --> 02:00:04.720
An Israelite if you live in Israel or is that like an Israeli?

2116
02:00:04.721 --> 02:00:08.530
One of the black is really,
I remember those guys in black Israelites.

2117
02:00:08.590 --> 02:00:10.420
Those guys are a trip that was like,
guys are awesome.

2118
02:00:10.450 --> 02:00:12.670
Did you ever see those guys in New York?
Yeah,
I've seen them.

2119
02:00:12.671 --> 02:00:14.290
You know what's interesting about them in Israel,

2120
02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:18.730
a bunch of the move to Israel and Israel lights are basically just a group of

2121
02:00:18.731 --> 02:00:22.210
black people from Chicago that decided they were the true Jews and that real

2122
02:00:22.211 --> 02:00:26.290
Jews weren't Jews.
And they were just,
I didn't,
apropos of what I don't know.

2123
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:30.400
And they wear outfits like Superhero,
straight up suits of armor.

2124
02:00:30.401 --> 02:00:34.150
And they stand on the corner and say that like,
like white people are the devil

2125
02:00:34.220 --> 02:00:37.880
<v 4>read on brother seat on a group of a move to Israel.</v>

2126
02:00:38.090 --> 02:00:39.830
And they were just sort of squatting in Israel.

2127
02:00:39.831 --> 02:00:42.860
They just went to Israel and then they just stayed.
And the Israeli government,

2128
02:00:42.861 --> 02:00:46.370
the way that the Israeli government immigration works is that you have to be a

2129
02:00:46.371 --> 02:00:50.840
Jew to immigrate there.
Uh,
or you know,
or it's complicated.
But if you're a Jew,

2130
02:00:50.841 --> 02:00:52.940
it's like automatic citizenship in Israel.

2131
02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:55.800
And so they went to these black Israelites and they were like,
okay,

2132
02:00:55.801 --> 02:00:59.300
you guys got to,
you guys are like just here,

2133
02:00:59.340 --> 02:01:04.160
we can't just move here is Jews only now we are Jews brother.
And they were like,

2134
02:01:04.161 --> 02:01:07.700
no,
we'll need you to convert if you're going to stay as citizens.

2135
02:01:07.701 --> 02:01:11.870
And they're like,
we you convert brother.
And then Israel basically was just like,

2136
02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:14.450
uh,
you know what?
Okay,
you guys can stay.

2137
02:01:14.451 --> 02:01:18.110
And they just get them Israeli citizenship as to they never did anything.

2138
02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:21.830
And currently you can go to like a weird commune in the middle of Israel and

2139
02:01:21.831 --> 02:01:26.060
there's a bunch of American black Israeli Israelite Jews.

2140
02:01:26.190 --> 02:01:29.370
<v 0>Really?
So they just decided to let him stay.
Why they do that?</v>

2141
02:01:29.371 --> 02:01:31.400
Because it was just annoying.
I think they were just too,

2142
02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:33.360
they were just like forget it.
Let them stay.

2143
02:01:33.450 --> 02:01:36.150
It's amazing that they let him stay though.
I know.
It's very weird.

2144
02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:40.040
I would think everybody else has to convert because it's total Jewish state.

2145
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:43.160
So like if Brian wanted to move over there,
he'd have to take Hebrew lessons.

2146
02:01:43.161 --> 02:01:46.280
And he'd have to convert.
That's right.
And with all that Viking and he's got,

2147
02:01:46.281 --> 02:01:49.040
it probably wouldn't work out anyway.
But isn't marijuana legal over there?

2148
02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:53.450
I don't think so.
Although there is a marijuana legalization party in parliament,

2149
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:56.890
I think it's why did I think that the law.
Okay.
Let's see.

2150
02:01:56.900 --> 02:01:58.370
Is Marijuana legal in Israel?

2151
02:01:59.210 --> 02:01:59.990
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

2152
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:03.920
<v 0>Maybe not legal,
but very loose with her or changing laws</v>

2153
02:02:05.970 --> 02:02:08.190
that could be.
I know that there was a member of parliament,

2154
02:02:08.191 --> 02:02:09.690
those from the legalization party

2155
02:02:11.460 --> 02:02:14.730
legality of cannabis by country in Wikipedia.

2156
02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:17.130
New Insights on mayor marijuana.

2157
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:19.303
<v 6>Hmm.</v>

2158
02:02:21.340 --> 02:02:25.020
<v 0>Apparently they're,
they're loosening the,
they're,</v>

2159
02:02:25.021 --> 02:02:27.600
they're looking at it and they were recognizing the,
uh,

2160
02:02:27.930 --> 02:02:31.170
the medical benefits of it.
So,
um,

2161
02:02:32.220 --> 02:02:36.900
there's a government approved medical marijuana farm in the Galilee hills of

2162
02:02:36.901 --> 02:02:41.230
northern Israel.
What's the Galilee hills?
The Galilee.

2163
02:02:41.231 --> 02:02:45.040
The Sea of Galilee is where Jesus walked on water.
Oh Shit.

2164
02:02:45.041 --> 02:02:46.180
What a good place to grow weed.

2165
02:02:47.170 --> 02:02:49.480
That's probably why they saw him walking on water.

2166
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:54.070
One strain is said to have the strongest psychoactive effect of any cannabis in

2167
02:02:54.071 --> 02:02:58.360
the world.
A Jews,
powerful Jews.
That's what we do.

2168
02:02:58.420 --> 02:03:02.590
We'll do you know that the reason why Moses supposedly met God when he saw the

2169
02:03:02.591 --> 02:03:06.460
burning Bush,
they think that the burning Bush was the Acacia Bush.

2170
02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:10.750
They acacia bushes,
rich and DMT,
like one of the richest plants and DMT.

2171
02:03:11.110 --> 02:03:16.110
So they think that what it really is is some sort of a metaphor for him taking

2172
02:03:16.751 --> 02:03:17.560
this,

2173
02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:22.330
this psychoactive drug and having this experience with God like this is like

2174
02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:26.650
mainstream Jerusalem scholars are trying to sense.
Totally makes sense,

2175
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:31.510
but all the stories in the Bible are all translated down from ancient Hebrew

2176
02:03:31.511 --> 02:03:35.260
originally.
Then to Roman Latin,
rather Greek,

2177
02:03:35.590 --> 02:03:38.260
all these different languages that you lose a little bit of the,

2178
02:03:38.590 --> 02:03:40.900
the actual original meaning of it.
Right.

2179
02:03:40.930 --> 02:03:44.380
The guy's talking to a burning Bush and seeing God and this Bush that's

2180
02:03:44.381 --> 02:03:47.200
everywhere.
The Bush spoke to him.
Yeah.
I mean,
come on,

2181
02:03:47.201 --> 02:03:50.650
I could give you a bunch of those peaks you.
Yeah,
totally.
It's right now.

2182
02:03:50.651 --> 02:03:55.000
You can get it in 2014 that's the,
what's your name?
I am what I am.

2183
02:03:55.110 --> 02:03:57.160
That sounds straight up like a high person.

2184
02:03:57.490 --> 02:04:01.600
Well that's part of what's going on with a lot of these new churches where they

2185
02:04:01.601 --> 02:04:06.430
uh,
have Iowasca as a religious sacrament and it's approved by the Supreme Court.

2186
02:04:06.460 --> 02:04:10.780
These are native American or these are white people in Topanga Canyon,
Brazil,

2187
02:04:10.990 --> 02:04:15.220
actually two of them from Brazil.
Um,
here I'll pull it up.

2188
02:04:15.700 --> 02:04:18.700
Brazilian churches that uh,

2189
02:04:18.970 --> 02:04:20.950
I think it's sent diamond or something.

2190
02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:27.240
Churches allowed to use psychoactive drug [inaudible].

2191
02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:31.490
<v 6>MMM.</v>

2192
02:04:31.490 --> 02:04:33.410
<v 0>And the uh,
the idea is that look,</v>

2193
02:04:33.411 --> 02:04:36.890
if you have wine and wine is the Sacramento a recognized religious,

2194
02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:40.950
the freedom of religion in this country should protect our,
our,

2195
02:04:40.951 --> 02:04:42.150
our religious sacrament.

2196
02:04:42.630 --> 02:04:46.710
And then our religious sacrament is Iowasca and that um,
these,

2197
02:04:46.770 --> 02:04:47.760
these guys have these,

2198
02:04:47.761 --> 02:04:52.761
these churches fuck the fucking Brazilian Iowasca churches.

2199
02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:57.300
Yeah.
There's,
there's a couple of different ones.
Anyway,
the point being that,

2200
02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:01.950
I mean that's probably what the fuck was going on when Moses was around,

2201
02:05:02.010 --> 02:05:02.281
you know,

2202
02:05:02.281 --> 02:05:05.820
if there really was a Moses and he didn't have this experience and what it,

2203
02:05:05.821 --> 02:05:08.400
what was their experience told them to be nice to people.

2204
02:05:08.401 --> 02:05:10.470
It gave them a list of rules.

2205
02:05:10.471 --> 02:05:14.730
The human being should follow base based on morals and ethics that he learned

2206
02:05:14.731 --> 02:05:17.820
from a burning plant.
But it also said not to fuck his neighbor's wife.

2207
02:05:17.850 --> 02:05:20.070
So that doesn't feel as he said don't covet,

2208
02:05:20.130 --> 02:05:23.480
which is really weird because we covet means is that your neighbor's wife,

2209
02:05:23.490 --> 02:05:25.550
his property and that you're,

2210
02:05:25.551 --> 02:05:29.250
you're coveting her property like you want to and that's a good way to be a

2211
02:05:29.251 --> 02:05:31.050
neighbor man.
I mean,
don't,

2212
02:05:31.140 --> 02:05:34.230
don't try to fuck your friends wife because you're going to ruin their

2213
02:05:34.231 --> 02:05:35.160
relationship.
You know,

2214
02:05:35.161 --> 02:05:40.161
if you're one of those creepy dudes like could you imagine if you were living

2215
02:05:40.261 --> 02:05:45.261
next door to some dude who looked a lot like David Hasselhoff in his prime in

2216
02:05:45.390 --> 02:05:47.460
the 1980s,
and uh,

2217
02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:51.300
this fucking David Hasselhoff cap coming over the house while you were at work,

2218
02:05:51.301 --> 02:05:52.710
ringing the door bell,

2219
02:05:52.980 --> 02:05:56.220
taking your wife out to lunch and all this kind of shit and you're like,

2220
02:05:56.490 --> 02:06:00.930
this motherfucker trying to fuck my wife and it just becomes a huge God damn

2221
02:06:00.931 --> 02:06:02.760
problem.
I don't see David Hasselhoff said,

2222
02:06:02.780 --> 02:06:06.630
nice guy and we're friends and that's it.
I'm like,
listen,
you crazy pitch.

2223
02:06:06.850 --> 02:06:09.190
This guy is trying to fuck you.
He's gonna ruin this whole thing.

2224
02:06:09.550 --> 02:06:14.070
See that's in the Bible.
David Has David Hasselhoff.

2225
02:06:14.220 --> 02:06:16.740
I'm not saying David Hasselhoff.
I mean I'm sure David Hasselhoff,

2226
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:21.180
a beautiful human being.
What I'm saying is if you say,

2227
02:06:21.181 --> 02:06:25.440
if you looked like Brian,
for instance,
handsome fellow,

2228
02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:31.200
average gluten guy.
This guy right there,
Brian right there.
No regular guy.

2229
02:06:31.410 --> 02:06:33.870
Wait,
I'm trying to figure out what you were saying.
Handsome.
Beautiful.

2230
02:06:33.871 --> 02:06:35.490
Look at them.
I'm trying to fat

2231
02:06:38.980 --> 02:06:42.320
and he's married to some hottie and then this fucking David Hasselhoff looking

2232
02:06:42.340 --> 02:06:44.070
motherfucker with a body like the rock.

2233
02:06:44.370 --> 02:06:47.550
So the next door trying to take his girlfriend out.
You would be,

2234
02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:50.100
you wouldn't be happy with that with you.
That's why I have a drop cam.

2235
02:06:50.101 --> 02:06:54.210
I'm checking my checkout right now.
Cleaning and living.
Fuck a checking out.

2236
02:06:54.660 --> 02:06:57.450
You're watching.
You're watching a relationship unfold.
Yeah,

2237
02:06:57.451 --> 02:07:00.420
he's watching David Hasselhoff banging her over a self.
How is he,

2238
02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:04.070
cause he got one of those nights of this total CEO thick roly polies.

2239
02:07:05.540 --> 02:07:07.530
Let's
see.

2240
02:07:08.790 --> 02:07:11.670
I want to find out about these black Israelites in,

2241
02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:14.700
I've seen him out here only once.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2242
02:07:14.701 --> 02:07:17.450
They're in their New York and Chicago.
I've seen him event,

2243
02:07:17.490 --> 02:07:19.620
this is where they would go.
Yeah.
Seems about right.

2244
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:23.250
They would read out of the Bible about the so called Jew,

2245
02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:25.470
you know the show called Jews today.
Right.

2246
02:07:25.471 --> 02:07:28.590
So they have this idea where the 13 tribes of Israel were,

2247
02:07:28.620 --> 02:07:33.290
were basically like native Americans,
Mexicans,
Asians,
black people,
Mex,
uh,

2248
02:07:33.300 --> 02:07:37.570
you know,
bubble Eskimos,
et,
and then the Jews aren't Jews.

2249
02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:41.020
The only people that didn't make it as Jews or Jews,
it just doesn't seem fair.

2250
02:07:42.010 --> 02:07:46.480
Well,
you familiar with,
uh,
the Ethiopian Jews?
I,
yeah,
I know about them.
Yeah.

2251
02:07:46.481 --> 02:07:49.780
That's where they believe the Ark of the covenant is.
Right.
And you know,

2252
02:07:49.781 --> 02:07:53.440
what's weird about that is that it actually could be there.
It's not probably,

2253
02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:56.220
why say not probably.
Well,
do you know the,

2254
02:07:56.270 --> 02:07:58.910
the entire religion of Easter,

2255
02:07:58.930 --> 02:08:03.340
of Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity is based upon the idea that the Ark of the

2256
02:08:03.341 --> 02:08:08.050
covenant is in Addis Ababa,
in the main church of the Ethiopian church.

2257
02:08:08.050 --> 02:08:12.040
But it's in a special room.
Anytime it's special room and special dude,

2258
02:08:12.041 --> 02:08:13.770
who's the only dude that can see it.
I start,

2259
02:08:13.780 --> 02:08:15.970
that's when I started going gray a little bit.

2260
02:08:16.030 --> 02:08:20.470
So there's a special room with a special dude and only one dude can see it.

2261
02:08:20.590 --> 02:08:23.860
Nobody else can see it.
And then when the special dude is ready to retire,

2262
02:08:23.861 --> 02:08:25.570
he fought.
He picks another special dude.

2263
02:08:25.750 --> 02:08:27.550
And that special dude becomes a guy that can see it,

2264
02:08:27.551 --> 02:08:30.610
but the people can never see it.
So I,
whenever I hear things like that,

2265
02:08:30.611 --> 02:08:33.730
I start going like that.
That's not real.
You was rightly should.

2266
02:08:33.731 --> 02:08:37.990
But imagine if it actually was a special dude and he was only allowed to tell

2267
02:08:37.991 --> 02:08:40.400
one of the special dude when he's dying.
They said,
uh,

2268
02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:42.280
Graham Hancock got into that.

2269
02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:47.440
It's one of the first things that he sort of researched and he researched it

2270
02:08:47.441 --> 02:08:51.640
because all these guys that were around that area had cataracts.

2271
02:08:51.940 --> 02:08:54.520
Like these,
uh,
these guys that were taking care of that church,

2272
02:08:54.550 --> 02:08:58.690
I guess you'd call the monks or whatever low they were saying that,
oh,

2273
02:08:58.691 --> 02:09:01.530
I guess they would be,
yeah,
they'd be priests.
Ethiopian cat,

2274
02:09:01.610 --> 02:09:04.150
the Christian priests of some sort.
Yeah,
they,

2275
02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:09.180
there was quite a few that had had a issues that could be described as similar

2276
02:09:10.901 --> 02:09:13.750
to issues that people have when they have radiation poisoning.

2277
02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:18.580
So the light of the Lord was so overwhelming that it give them cataracts have

2278
02:09:18.660 --> 02:09:22.030
covered in this.
If the Ark of the covenant is a real thing,

2279
02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:25.360
like what could it possibly be where if you look at it,
you melt,
you know,

2280
02:09:25.361 --> 02:09:28.030
like remember Raiders of the lost Ark,
what could it be?

2281
02:09:28.090 --> 02:09:30.970
I wouldn't say flying Nazis.
Right.
Ghost of Nazis today.

2282
02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:36.470
It seems like the most likely solution bucketed Nazi Dick's.
Yeah.
Rotten now.

2283
02:09:36.660 --> 02:09:40.900
Yeah.
I think if it,
if it is anything that makes any sense at all.

2284
02:09:40.930 --> 02:09:44.460
It could be some sort of a reactor.
Like some sort of a home reacted.

2285
02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:45.850
Maybe that kid that got arrested recently,

2286
02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:50.200
he was making a fucking reactor in his backyard.
Remember that?
I remember that.

2287
02:09:50.830 --> 02:09:54.340
Yeah.
So you think that's the arc of the covenant?
I don't know.
I wonder,

2288
02:09:54.370 --> 02:09:57.760
I wonder if it really was a such a thing.
See,

2289
02:09:58.180 --> 02:10:01.300
they're finding out now pretty assured,

2290
02:10:02.050 --> 02:10:07.050
like with a high rate of probability that there's been some massive cataclysmic

2291
02:10:07.571 --> 02:10:11.920
disasters that have all but wiped out the human race a couple of times that

2292
02:10:11.930 --> 02:10:14.560
they've been thousands and thousands and thousands of years ago.

2293
02:10:15.070 --> 02:10:16.780
And if that is the case,

2294
02:10:16.810 --> 02:10:21.670
it might very well be that human beings had reached a very high level of

2295
02:10:21.671 --> 02:10:23.440
technological sophistication.

2296
02:10:23.650 --> 02:10:27.700
And that might be why there were all these beautiful,
enormous,

2297
02:10:27.701 --> 02:10:30.450
ancient stone structures that we really don't understand how they,

2298
02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:34.190
they made today,
that it could be that there was people

2299
02:10:34.190 --> 02:10:37.220
<v 1>at one point in time,
whether it's 15,000 years ago,
whatever it was,</v>

2300
02:10:37.490 --> 02:10:40.490
that had gotten pretty,
pretty sophisticated and a lot of ways,

2301
02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:43.040
and then we're almost wiped out by asteroids.

2302
02:10:43.100 --> 02:10:46.580
So there'd been enlightenments before our current enlightenment.
Yeah.

2303
02:10:46.581 --> 02:10:47.840
And maybe even different,

2304
02:10:47.870 --> 02:10:50.900
which is why they have all these incredible stone structures,

2305
02:10:50.901 --> 02:10:53.330
but we've seen no evidence whatsoever that they have electricity.

2306
02:10:53.630 --> 02:10:56.690
No evidence whatsoever outside of a few batteries that we found.

2307
02:10:56.691 --> 02:11:00.190
They have found batteries real.
Yeah.
They found batteries in Iraq here.

2308
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:04.000
Pull up Brian,
pull up an ancient battery,
uh,

2309
02:11:04.010 --> 02:11:09.010
Iraq because Iraq is Sumir and Sumir is the,

2310
02:11:09.410 --> 02:11:14.060
as far as we know,
like current history,
the oldest known civilization,

2311
02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:16.460
the Fertile Crescent.
Yeah.
So that's,

2312
02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:20.710
that's exactly where Baghdad is exactly where this,

2313
02:11:20.711 --> 02:11:24.200
this civilization was.
That was the first written language that we know of.

2314
02:11:24.201 --> 02:11:26.390
The first mathematics.
Yeah,
there's the battery.

2315
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:30.800
It's an actual battery that they've figured out.
I mean,
that is what it is.

2316
02:11:30.850 --> 02:11:35.670
That whatever it is,
it generates electricity in a very primitive way.
So what,

2317
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:39.050
what might mean where you beat somebody up in Baghdad?

2318
02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:44.360
No,
I thought it meant when you make a really good chicken with a thick crust.

2319
02:11:45.110 --> 02:11:49.720
The,
um,
I like that battery.
Yeah.
The,

2320
02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:53.030
the idea is that whatever had happened,

2321
02:11:53.090 --> 02:11:57.350
they believe like 10,500 years ago was also responsible for the decline of the

2322
02:11:57.350 --> 02:12:00.590
ice age.
That it stopped the ice age,
massive global climate change.

2323
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:04.370
But also I'll just talk complete reset of human civilization.

2324
02:12:04.490 --> 02:12:07.230
So that's all we're going towards now with global warming.
Kobe,

2325
02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:10.220
he's another reset.
Could be,
well this guy had this guy,

2326
02:12:10.221 --> 02:12:12.790
Randall Carlson on who's an expert in these,
uh,

2327
02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:17.510
geological events and what he described is so much scarier than global warming.

2328
02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:20.060
When he describes global cooling,
he's like,

2329
02:12:20.150 --> 02:12:23.630
everyone's terrified of global warming and global warming obviously is going to

2330
02:12:23.631 --> 02:12:25.850
have plenty of unique problems.
He's like,

2331
02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:29.270
what I worry about more than that is the particulates that were released into

2332
02:12:29.271 --> 02:12:32.360
the atmosphere,
like coal burning.
He goes,
I worry about that more than,

2333
02:12:32.930 --> 02:12:37.130
more than the warming itself.
The warming itself is definitely problematic.

2334
02:12:37.131 --> 02:12:39.890
He's not like downplaying it,
but he's saying,
but global cooling,

2335
02:12:39.980 --> 02:12:40.920
that's what you wear.

2336
02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:45.860
Glasses and smoke lucky strikes and just hang out on the corner.
Man,

2337
02:12:46.190 --> 02:12:49.940
now he's talking about ice ages.
He's like,
ice ages are horrific.

2338
02:12:50.180 --> 02:12:53.240
That's what kills everybody.
That's what fucks up society.

2339
02:12:53.241 --> 02:12:56.840
That's what causes lifespans to be drastically shortened.

2340
02:12:56.841 --> 02:12:58.850
That's what causes massive diseases.

2341
02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:04.120
That's what causes huge glaciers to just fill up entire continents.

2342
02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:09.280
They know now that at least from 10,500 you know,

2343
02:13:09.860 --> 02:13:11.150
11,000 years back,

2344
02:13:11.420 --> 02:13:16.420
at least half of North America was under a mile high sheet of ice and it Canada,

2345
02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:21.650
Canada was all ice.
That's a wall.
The Wall.
Do you know what's game of Thrones?

2346
02:13:21.670 --> 02:13:25.400
Oh is like the wall.
It's the wall somewhere.
Yeah,
winter is coming.
Yeah.

2347
02:13:25.401 --> 02:13:28.240
And winter lasts forever bro.
But that is actually the,

2348
02:13:28.241 --> 02:13:30.750
the world that gave him a throne slips in.
They have these hundred year,
winter.

2349
02:13:30.820 --> 02:13:32.400
Yes.
So maybe it's just an ice age.

2350
02:13:32.490 --> 02:13:36.840
Well they said that there were times in human history recorded times where

2351
02:13:36.841 --> 02:13:40.850
summer never came.
You know,
where they had these mini ice ages would,

2352
02:13:40.851 --> 02:13:43.050
they had temperature variance.
You know,

2353
02:13:43.051 --> 02:13:46.110
when we think about the variation between winter and summer,

2354
02:13:46.290 --> 02:13:50.550
you know in some places you talk about 50 below zero to 50 degrees.

2355
02:13:50.551 --> 02:13:51.870
Like that's about as warm as it gets.

2356
02:13:52.150 --> 02:13:56.340
It's sort of shift and sometimes it would not shift.
It would just,

2357
02:13:56.400 --> 02:13:57.780
it would be just suck.

2358
02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:02.010
You would get suck from the jump all year round constantly.

2359
02:14:02.011 --> 02:14:07.011
And that's a weird thing to think about that global warming is preferable to

2360
02:14:07.321 --> 02:14:10.350
this global cooling and that global cooling is the worst fucking thing you could

2361
02:14:10.351 --> 02:14:12.600
ever have happened.
Are we headed towards another ice age?

2362
02:14:12.690 --> 02:14:16.140
Is that what that guy said?
No,
no.
He said we're definitely warming up,

2363
02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:19.190
but he said,
but there's a lot of factors.
He said that,
you know,
he,

2364
02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:22.640
he was talking about co two in the atmosphere and he,

2365
02:14:22.641 --> 02:14:24.570
and one of the things that he said that was interesting,
he's like,

2366
02:14:24.571 --> 02:14:27.390
see co two in the atmosphere is awful,
but it,

2367
02:14:27.540 --> 02:14:29.880
it's also responsible for plant growth.

2368
02:14:29.881 --> 02:14:33.210
And the forests have actually started to increase,
increase your amount of,

2369
02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:34.840
of growth of a,

2370
02:14:34.850 --> 02:14:38.840
of plants and trees because of the fact that like the like PR,

2371
02:14:38.990 --> 02:14:43.110
like predicted growth of certain forests is actually much higher than it was

2372
02:14:43.111 --> 02:14:45.870
predicted because the co two in the atmosphere,

2373
02:14:46.420 --> 02:14:50.070
he said the real issue is there's a lot of other things going on as far as like

2374
02:14:50.071 --> 02:14:54.930
solar activity,
the mag fear,
like all these things have to be taken into account.

2375
02:14:54.930 --> 02:14:58.080
When you talk about like why the earth gets warmer and colder and there's been

2376
02:14:58.140 --> 02:14:58.681
periods,

2377
02:14:58.681 --> 02:15:03.150
observable periods from studying ice cores over tens of thousands of years,

2378
02:15:03.151 --> 02:15:06.390
it show all these different shifts.
So he said,
yeah,
without a doubt we're,

2379
02:15:06.391 --> 02:15:08.640
we're assholes and we're ruining the earth.
And you know,
we're,

2380
02:15:08.641 --> 02:15:12.120
we're definitely fucking things up.
But the scariest thing isn't even that.

2381
02:15:12.150 --> 02:15:15.950
The scariest thing is that natural disasters like asteroidal impacts,
which are,

2382
02:15:15.951 --> 02:15:20.390
they're finding with the latest data that they're far more frequent than,

2383
02:15:20.391 --> 02:15:24.690
than we ever thought that meteor impacts on earth are way,
way,
way more frequent.

2384
02:15:25.140 --> 02:15:25.501
And that,

2385
02:15:25.501 --> 02:15:28.680
like this thing that happened over Russia recently when they saw that what

2386
02:15:28.681 --> 02:15:31.410
people drive in their car and these things fucking exploded in the sky.

2387
02:15:31.690 --> 02:15:36.390
They're like,
if it exploded,
just,
you know,
whatever it was quarter mile,

2388
02:15:36.391 --> 02:15:37.430
lower,
you know,
and,

2389
02:15:37.431 --> 02:15:41.250
and on the ground it would have been a massive casualties like thousands of

2390
02:15:41.251 --> 02:15:44.100
people dead,
like a nuclear bomb.
Right?
And he's like,

2391
02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:47.010
these things are going to happen.
They happen all the time.

2392
02:15:47.011 --> 02:15:50.280
We live in a shooting gallery.
All you have to do is look at the moon.

2393
02:15:50.580 --> 02:15:52.470
The moon doesn't have any plants or water on it.

2394
02:15:52.471 --> 02:15:56.320
So you get to see all the impact holes.
Like that shit can hit hit us too.

2395
02:15:56.940 --> 02:15:59.790
Why hasn't it?
It has,
that's what you're saying.
It's just,

2396
02:15:59.850 --> 02:16:02.370
it's a perspective about time.
It's a perspective thing.

2397
02:16:02.580 --> 02:16:04.550
It's all like we were talking about with these all,

2398
02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:07.170
there's so much evil in the world.
There is a lot of evil in the world,

2399
02:16:07.171 --> 02:16:10.200
but there's also a lot of people in the world and in perspective,

2400
02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:11.810
not that much evil.
Right.

2401
02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:16.550
And what he's saying is that the asteroid impacts are inevitable and they're

2402
02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:20.370
deadly and they're ruthless.
We just haven't had one in a couple thousand years,

2403
02:16:20.371 --> 02:16:24.990
so we're kind of slipping and it could happen literally at this exact incident

2404
02:16:25.050 --> 02:16:27.930
all the time.
Yup.
Yup.
Just boom.
And if it did,

2405
02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:30.070
if one of these five mile wide

2406
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:33.250
<v 0>chunks of iron going 45,000 miles an hour,</v>

2407
02:16:33.780 --> 02:16:38.590
it would be seven miles deep into the planet a second after impact.

2408
02:16:38.710 --> 02:16:42.220
But what about my career?
But my head shots make,

2409
02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:47.310
I needed to get a pilot season is so depressing.

2410
02:16:49.570 --> 02:16:51.660
Everyone you know is,
yeah,

2411
02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:57.120
the entire ocean gets hit and just everything has gone to ocean disappears and

2412
02:16:58.211 --> 02:17:00.940
vanishes.
It does put everything in perspective.
You know,

2413
02:17:00.941 --> 02:17:03.070
you think you're at rock bottom,
driving down an alley,

2414
02:17:03.071 --> 02:17:06.690
trying to get a blow job from a racist through Compton,
a giant racist

2415
02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:12.910
living underneath the bridge of racism,
exacting a toll.
And then,

2416
02:17:13.390 --> 02:17:16.120
and then as you're in the middle of your own little interpersonal,

2417
02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:17.260
like rock bottom,

2418
02:17:17.710 --> 02:17:22.420
a fucking literal rock hits the bottom of the earth and destroys all mankind.

2419
02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:25.180
And if that doesn't happen,
the earth itself fucks up.

2420
02:17:25.210 --> 02:17:30.010
There's huge meteors that,
that hit the planet and wipe things out,

2421
02:17:30.011 --> 02:17:33.800
but they're nothing in comparison to super volcanoes,
super volcanoes.

2422
02:17:33.910 --> 02:17:37.000
I fuck up all the time.
They're all over the planet.

2423
02:17:37.210 --> 02:17:39.020
There's a bunch of these gigantic calderas.

2424
02:17:39.060 --> 02:17:43.330
They get to be the size of mountains and then they explode and all that's left

2425
02:17:43.331 --> 02:17:46.510
is a crater and the sun is going to burn out,

2426
02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:49.330
is not going to let her get all of this.

2427
02:17:49.331 --> 02:17:52.540
The Sun's going to go and just like burn out.

2428
02:17:52.810 --> 02:17:55.360
Like one day we're going to go to turn the light switch on in our bedroom and

2429
02:17:55.361 --> 02:17:58.870
it's not going to be there no more son,
bitch.
He used it all up.
That's it.

2430
02:17:59.050 --> 02:18:01.780
<v 1>Yeah.
Well that's,
that's going to take some time,</v>

2431
02:18:01.900 --> 02:18:04.750
but hopefully we'll figure out space travel before that.

2432
02:18:05.140 --> 02:18:08.320
Hopefully we'd be like the highway men.
Do you ever hear that song?

2433
02:18:08.321 --> 02:18:10.650
Was Willie Nelson Johnny Cash?
No,
I don't know.

2434
02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:15.760
Merle haggard and someone else to some the guy,
the highway men,
they uh,

2435
02:18:15.761 --> 02:18:20.440
they made it.
Oh,
uh,
who's the guy?
Chris Christopherson.
He's in it too,
I think.

2436
02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:23.800
<v 0>And the sounds are happening song,
great song.
But it's about,</v>

2437
02:18:23.830 --> 02:18:24.980
you don't like black dick either.

2438
02:18:25.690 --> 02:18:29.570
Maybe they love it until they dress in black all the time.
But it was a,
it's a,

2439
02:18:29.690 --> 02:18:30.200
it's a song.
Yeah,

2440
02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:32.800
<v 1>about reincarnation.
You know,</v>

2441
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:36.440
coming back and doing it all over and over and over again.
You know,
this,

2442
02:18:36.890 --> 02:18:39.800
this notion that whatever life that you live,
you will,

2443
02:18:39.801 --> 02:18:43.460
you will continue and you will keep doing it over and over and over and over and

2444
02:18:43.461 --> 02:18:46.100
over and over and over again until you get it right.
But along the way,

2445
02:18:46.101 --> 02:18:50.990
parallel universes will exist where the next generation will exist and the next

2446
02:18:50.991 --> 02:18:53.300
generation will learn from this and go on and on and on.

2447
02:18:53.301 --> 02:18:54.980
But you might be stuck here,

2448
02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:59.300
right here forever living this very same life over and over again thinking one

2449
02:18:59.301 --> 02:19:00.800
day we're going to have flying cars,

2450
02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:05.130
<v 0>Eh,
one day you're going to die and come back and it's going to be 1975 again.</v>

2451
02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:08.460
Fuck this is straight up.
Like do it all over and you're all diverse theory.

2452
02:19:08.610 --> 02:19:13.050
It's multiverse theory combined with groundhog day combined with some of the

2453
02:19:13.051 --> 02:19:16.710
heroes of country music in this country.
Wait,
but I was a highway man.

2454
02:19:16.711 --> 02:19:18.960
Have you heard of the Boltzmann brain theory?
What does that,

2455
02:19:19.500 --> 02:19:23.570
this is really fucked up.
This is a theory that basically,
um,

2456
02:19:24.090 --> 02:19:28.040
because time is,
uh,
you know,
infinite,
right?
So

2457
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:31.280
<v 4>there's an infinite amount of time ahead of us,
right?</v>

2458
02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:35.600
That it is possible that we're currently here existing in reality,

2459
02:19:35.810 --> 02:19:38.430
but because there's so much time,
uh,

2460
02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:41.390
what eventually will happen is that the sun will burn out,

2461
02:19:41.720 --> 02:19:46.070
the universe will keep expanding.
We'll all be pulled apart into nothingness.

2462
02:19:46.100 --> 02:19:48.470
There'll be nothing,
but you know,

2463
02:19:48.471 --> 02:19:51.650
the atoms will separate from each other and we'll be just floating.

2464
02:19:51.651 --> 02:19:54.590
Nothing this time ceasing to exist.

2465
02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:57.210
But because there's so much time in,

2466
02:19:57.410 --> 02:20:01.910
in front of us that and because there is still some heat and temperature that

2467
02:20:01.911 --> 02:20:06.590
eventually,
because all things will happen in an infinite times time frame,

2468
02:20:06.700 --> 02:20:07.251
you know what I mean?

2469
02:20:07.251 --> 02:20:10.850
If you have enough time at all of the things that are possible to happen in time

2470
02:20:11.060 --> 02:20:16.040
will happen because of infinite time that eventually we will recreate,

2471
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:20.320
there'll be a little blip of recreation,
of energy and uh,
you know,
uh,

2472
02:20:20.330 --> 02:20:24.380
a virus will be created and then a protozoal be recreated and then a human will

2473
02:20:24.381 --> 02:20:29.381
be recreated and then the society will be recreated into the realm of reality

2474
02:20:29.391 --> 02:20:33.140
that we're in now.
So all things will happen because there's infinite time,

2475
02:20:33.410 --> 02:20:37.920
but because of the realities of energy and,
and,

2476
02:20:38.030 --> 02:20:39.710
and production that,

2477
02:20:40.270 --> 02:20:44.270
that it is much more likely that a,
and much more,

2478
02:20:44.271 --> 02:20:49.100
it takes much less energy to have created a reality where all of our brains,

2479
02:20:49.340 --> 02:20:52.280
where this brain that you have Joe,
that is created,

2480
02:20:52.281 --> 02:20:56.750
this podcasting empire was created with intact.

2481
02:20:56.990 --> 02:20:58.190
It's much more,
uh,

2482
02:20:58.290 --> 02:21:02.240
much less energy to create your brain with all of its memories implanted in it

2483
02:21:02.390 --> 02:21:06.380
than it is to create a university,
create that informed all of your memories.

2484
02:21:06.410 --> 02:21:09.890
Does that make sense?
So for your brain to just have popped up in this universe,

2485
02:21:10.040 --> 02:21:14.180
having a bunch of things that it considers to be memories in this considering to

2486
02:21:14.181 --> 02:21:15.410
be your,
you know,

2487
02:21:15.411 --> 02:21:19.700
this looking like your podcasting studio and your California in your world,

2488
02:21:19.940 --> 02:21:24.940
it's much less energy to create a brain that understands that reality than it is

2489
02:21:25.041 --> 02:21:30.041
to create an entire history that your brain will have memories of it.

2490
02:21:31.420 --> 02:21:32.001
In other words,

2491
02:21:32.001 --> 02:21:37.001
it's easier to create a memory of a photo then to create the reality of the past

2492
02:21:37.881 --> 02:21:41.300
where the photo was taken.
Does any of this make sense?
No.
Okay.
Well,

2493
02:21:41.301 --> 02:21:43.550
I'm not a physicist,
so that could be part of our problem

2494
02:21:43.690 --> 02:21:48.370
<v 1>to create a memory and artificial memory meeting.
Basically it's easier to life.</v>

2495
02:21:48.430 --> 02:21:52.540
It's easier for life to be simulation than it is for life to be real.

2496
02:21:52.620 --> 02:21:56.040
<v 4>That's right.
That it's more according to the laws of physics,</v>

2497
02:21:56.070 --> 02:21:58.250
it's more likely that all of this is,

2498
02:21:58.251 --> 02:22:03.240
this is a simulation where all of our memories are just were created in a,

2499
02:22:03.300 --> 02:22:05.070
in a vacuum because it creates,

2500
02:22:05.400 --> 02:22:10.400
it takes more work to create a history than it does to create the memory of a

2501
02:22:10.411 --> 02:22:11.244
history.

2502
02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:16.130
<v 1>See,
I think that's,
maybe it may be,
who knows?
It might be true.
Might be possible,</v>

2503
02:22:16.190 --> 02:22:19.910
but I think that's part of the problem with intellectual masturbation.
Yeah.

2504
02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:24.320
Is that you,
you can get into these.
It's more likely that this is not real,

2505
02:22:24.410 --> 02:22:26.040
that it Israel,
well,
I've got news

2506
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:30.750
<v 0>for everybody that's open.
It's not real.
It's fucking real knock knock.</v>

2507
02:22:30.780 --> 02:22:35.040
It's real.
Whether it's real in a simulation or whether it's real,

2508
02:22:35.041 --> 02:22:38.160
it goes back to the same thing.
It's about having psychedelic experiences.

2509
02:22:38.161 --> 02:22:40.350
Are they real or are they hallucination?
Right.

2510
02:22:40.590 --> 02:22:44.490
It really doesn't matter whether it's real in the sense that you can put it in a

2511
02:22:44.491 --> 02:22:47.910
bag and throw it on a scale and they'll show you a waste 30 pounds or whether

2512
02:22:47.911 --> 02:22:50.460
it's real and that you're eyes saw it and then you had a,

2513
02:22:50.461 --> 02:22:54.960
a vivid memory of it still real.
Right.
So whether or not your,

2514
02:22:55.230 --> 02:22:59.190
your life and your memories are real because they were somehow or another

2515
02:22:59.191 --> 02:23:03.240
created in some sort of a simulation or whether they're real because you went

2516
02:23:03.241 --> 02:23:03.960
through it.

2517
02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:07.860
And because we really did evolve from protozoas the climbed out of the slime and

2518
02:23:07.861 --> 02:23:11.580
then it,
all of this was created by asteroidal impacts,
you know,

2519
02:23:11.581 --> 02:23:16.350
the theory of Panspermia taking the building blocks of life from other planets

2520
02:23:16.351 --> 02:23:21.030
and slamming them into the oceans.
Either way,
it's still real.
It's still real.

2521
02:23:21.180 --> 02:23:24.030
I Dunno.
I Dunno if it all really happened.
It doesn't matter if it happened,

2522
02:23:24.330 --> 02:23:27.390
whether it really dinosaurs they have bones.
Seems like it was real.
Well,

2523
02:23:27.391 --> 02:23:29.280
that's what this guy was saying.
This physicist to,

2524
02:23:29.281 --> 02:23:31.890
I was hearing talk about the Dr. Sean Carroll,
that's the guy's name,

2525
02:23:31.910 --> 02:23:34.800
was talking about this Boltzmann brain theory.
Uh,
he's like,

2526
02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:39.330
that's the most likely scenario that physics has come up with and it's absurd

2527
02:23:39.420 --> 02:23:42.540
and no one believes it because it's so crazy.
So they don't even,

2528
02:23:42.630 --> 02:23:46.800
so basically if you get to a level with physics where you start getting out into

2529
02:23:46.801 --> 02:23:49.410
the,
into time and space,
like the furthest reaches,

2530
02:23:49.530 --> 02:23:51.090
you get to a place where you just go,
oh,

2531
02:23:51.120 --> 02:23:55.470
it turns out we have absolutely no idea what's going on for now for now.

2532
02:23:55.650 --> 02:23:59.580
But I think there's also the theory that makes it tremendous amount of success

2533
02:23:59.581 --> 02:24:04.581
that if we do eventually come up with some sort of an augmented reality or

2534
02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:10.110
artificial reality,
that it will continue to progress technologically,

2535
02:24:10.111 --> 02:24:13.680
there'll be more,
more efficient,
it'll be more complete,

2536
02:24:13.681 --> 02:24:17.880
and it will eventually get to a point where it's indistinguishable.
You were,

2537
02:24:18.030 --> 02:24:21.540
you're going to have some sort of an oculus rift type reality that's

2538
02:24:21.541 --> 02:24:25.140
indistinguishable from the reality that we have right in front of us right here,

2539
02:24:25.141 --> 02:24:28.800
that they're going to have a way to stimulate the parts of your body that get

2540
02:24:28.801 --> 02:24:31.810
your dick hard because the 250 pound fat checks going to meet you in an alley.

2541
02:24:32.130 --> 02:24:34.980
I'm so cold.
I was like,
oh,
you're not cold.
There is no cold.

2542
02:24:35.010 --> 02:24:39.600
That might be part of the whole thing that one day that's going to be an option

2543
02:24:39.601 --> 02:24:43.350
and then even mental illness is going to be an option in this artificial reality

2544
02:24:43.351 --> 02:24:46.530
that we've created or maybe the,

2545
02:24:46.590 --> 02:24:51.590
the artificial reality will take into account all the lessons that you can learn

2546
02:24:51.661 --> 02:24:52.920
from the failures of others.

2547
02:24:53.070 --> 02:24:57.150
So CNN in this artificial reality will be filled with mass murders and crimes

2548
02:24:57.151 --> 02:24:58.120
and all these things.
Well,

2549
02:24:58.121 --> 02:25:02.490
you could see the horrific reactions in the face of the families of the victims

2550
02:25:02.491 --> 02:25:06.170
and all this stuff.
It could be programmed into the thing.
Well,
yeah,
or the fact,

2551
02:25:06.210 --> 02:25:10.390
or what if the sun burnt out a billion years ago and somebody right before it

2552
02:25:10.400 --> 02:25:15.000
burnt out,
created a computer simulation that could make society keep going on.

2553
02:25:15.001 --> 02:25:17.520
And we're just,
we're,
we're,
we're in it.
We're just,

2554
02:25:17.550 --> 02:25:22.550
we're contained in some ad Menttium marble hurling through the universe,

2555
02:25:23.050 --> 02:25:27.010
the speed of light and will slam into an ocean on the other side of the galaxy.

2556
02:25:27.011 --> 02:25:30.070
And that ocean will be just like that scene and what it was,

2557
02:25:30.071 --> 02:25:32.020
it was the fucking new alien movie.

2558
02:25:32.170 --> 02:25:36.580
Promethium the engineer spills his DNA into the river.

2559
02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:42.360
We could be about to be promethium engineered DNA sperm.

2560
02:25:42.460 --> 02:25:45.370
Dude,
you're a stoner without the weed.
That's what you are.

2561
02:25:45.820 --> 02:25:49.050
You're sitting here having stoner thoughts and you don't even use him.
We'd,

2562
02:25:49.060 --> 02:25:52.840
that's ridiculous.
I need to go to Peru and meet Gandalf,
man.
You might,

2563
02:25:53.380 --> 02:25:55.750
I might need to.
I just don't want,
you know,
imagine,

2564
02:25:55.751 --> 02:25:58.440
imagine like what we tell them to go and then

2565
02:26:00.430 --> 02:26:04.270
come on,
man.
I'm not doing good man.
Please man.
This is your idea,
man.

2566
02:26:04.271 --> 02:26:08.560
Just let me get like $100 real quick.
I'm good for a baby.
You know me or worse.

2567
02:26:08.620 --> 02:26:12.880
We're on our way to downtown La to do the ace theater on the August 1st.

2568
02:26:12.881 --> 02:26:16.570
Me and Joey Diaz.
And who is that walking down the street with all the zombies?

2569
02:26:16.900 --> 02:26:21.430
It's Moshe Chi.
Zip My little,
my little portal.
Hey Joe.

2570
02:26:21.810 --> 02:26:23.570
Well,
you have a zipper.
Yeah,
right.

2571
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:26.320
Isn't a lot of those guys with the fucking refrigerator boxes.

2572
02:26:26.321 --> 02:26:29.290
I'm about to eat my one meal of the week and Joey Diaz comes over and says,

2573
02:26:29.291 --> 02:26:32.980
that's my sandwich.
Listen,
you're already skinny.

2574
02:26:33.770 --> 02:26:38.410
I don't even need this.
We need this aggravation.
Yeah.
I don't know Matt.
Yeah,

2575
02:26:38.480 --> 02:26:39.490
it's a personal decision,

2576
02:26:39.491 --> 02:26:44.080
but I would give you as a suggestion now is to do the natural route first.

2577
02:26:44.290 --> 02:26:48.340
Have you ever done isolation tanks?
I have.
What'd you think about it?

2578
02:26:48.820 --> 02:26:51.700
I hated it.
Really drove me crazy.
Ooh,

2579
02:26:51.970 --> 02:26:54.880
I was thinking about you actually because I knew that you were a proponent,

2580
02:26:54.881 --> 02:26:58.270
a proponent of it,
and I really wanted to love it,
but I just,

2581
02:26:58.540 --> 02:27:01.470
maybe I'm too anxious maybe.

2582
02:27:02.050 --> 02:27:07.030
Which to do it in Portland.
Huh?
It didn't get me high.
It got me anxious.

2583
02:27:07.060 --> 02:27:09.020
Did you only do it once?
I did it once.
Yeah.

2584
02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:11.560
It's something you got to get used to.
The first time I ever did it,

2585
02:27:11.561 --> 02:27:13.960
I was a little weirded out by it for awhile.
I,

2586
02:27:13.961 --> 02:27:18.270
it's hard to relax and just accept the fact that you're in this tank and you're

2587
02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:21.580
going to move at all.
You start getting busy work where you like,

2588
02:27:21.581 --> 02:27:24.220
you start itching for no reason.
Like if you want to scratch your face,

2589
02:27:24.550 --> 02:27:26.890
how often is your fucking face?
Itchy.
Almost never.

2590
02:27:27.100 --> 02:27:30.100
Like when we're having a conversation.
Besides that time where I faked it,

2591
02:27:30.130 --> 02:27:33.550
I didn't have any itchy face.
I didn't,
I mean sometimes I'll rub my hand,

2592
02:27:33.551 --> 02:27:35.530
but I don't need to write.
When you're in that tank,

2593
02:27:35.531 --> 02:27:38.710
it feels like you need to fuck,
I need to scratch my eyebrows.
What?
I mean,

2594
02:27:38.711 --> 02:27:41.080
it's a trip.
How often do you think about your body?
I mean,

2595
02:27:41.081 --> 02:27:43.970
you may be more than most people would take a pill.
I'm body all day sun.

2596
02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:45.940
I do too.
I think about your body constantly,

2597
02:27:45.941 --> 02:27:50.920
which is why I was so happy to come to,
yeah,
I don't,

2598
02:27:51.430 --> 02:27:56.230
I don't know what it is about all those signals that go down to your body that

2599
02:27:56.231 --> 02:27:59.710
are hard to ignore when you just lie there still.
But it's hard to lie still.

2600
02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:01.270
It's very hard a lot still.

2601
02:28:01.630 --> 02:28:05.370
<v 3>Did you see that thing?
We talked about this on the podcast before in 1983.</v>

2602
02:28:05.371 --> 02:28:08.280
How they,
this group of people experimented.

2603
02:28:08.730 --> 02:28:13.140
They wanted to cut all senses off,
like,
like sight hearing,
you know,

2604
02:28:13.230 --> 02:28:15.330
everything.
So they found somebody that was like,

2605
02:28:15.450 --> 02:28:18.630
like he had no will to live anymore.
They,
they,
they took his side,

2606
02:28:18.631 --> 02:28:22.850
his ways hearing and stuff like that and he was just pretty much had no census

2607
02:28:22.851 --> 02:28:25.580
coming in.
So he's pretty much done like an isolation tank.

2608
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:30.890
And he started hearing like dead family members and his head and went to the

2609
02:28:30.891 --> 02:28:34.520
point where he just started going crazy saying that they won't stop talking to

2610
02:28:34.521 --> 02:28:38.560
me.
And uh,
then he ended up starting to like,
like tearing up,
uh,

2611
02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:39.800
pieces of his skin.

2612
02:28:39.900 --> 02:28:41.910
<v 0>Wait a minute,
wait a minute.
Are you sure this isn't a hoax?</v>

2613
02:28:42.210 --> 02:28:46.110
Because there was a hoax though.
Oh,
I know.
Yeah.

2614
02:28:46.580 --> 02:28:49.040
<v 3>Yeah.
I remember that Russian thing.
This is,
I wonder if this is the same.</v>

2615
02:28:49.470 --> 02:28:51.670
<v 0>Well,
it sounds like a crazy person.</v>

2616
02:28:52.330 --> 02:28:55.480
The problem is anecdotal evidence based on one particular case,
like,
you know,

2617
02:28:55.510 --> 02:28:58.390
you don't know how fucked up that dude was before they told him to do this.
No,

2618
02:28:58.420 --> 02:29:03.290
that is,
you're talking about that weird Russian Snopes story.
Yeah.

2619
02:29:03.330 --> 02:29:06.530
Yeah.
I think so.
They came in and it was other,

2620
02:29:06.540 --> 02:29:11.540
so it was a vision of nightmarish gruesomeness beyond all of that to anyone had

2621
02:29:11.831 --> 02:29:16.510
ever seen before.
Yeah.
It's like,
um,
event horizon,

2622
02:29:16.540 --> 02:29:17.950
that movie,
right?

2623
02:29:18.310 --> 02:29:22.630
They traveled through a wormhole and they hit the hell and hell gets into their

2624
02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:25.780
spaceship and they start telling each other.
Is that what you meant?

2625
02:29:25.930 --> 02:29:30.030
You meant they movie event horizon?
Yeah.
I'm just talking about the new guide.

2626
02:29:30.031 --> 02:29:33.910
So I think that uh,
what,
what,

2627
02:29:34.270 --> 02:29:37.750
what you get out of the tank once,
once you do it,
once you really do do it,

2628
02:29:37.751 --> 02:29:42.070
you get out of it and it's an environment where you actually separate from the

2629
02:29:42.071 --> 02:29:46.660
impo input that your body is giving your brain and that can be good or that

2630
02:29:46.661 --> 02:29:48.790
could be bad depending on how you are with your brain.

2631
02:29:49.150 --> 02:29:51.640
Like if you're one of those people that you know,

2632
02:29:52.240 --> 02:29:56.050
go back to people that have drug addictions that are just can't wait to get that

2633
02:29:56.051 --> 02:29:59.740
fixed and all they're thinking about is getting that crack in them and then try

2634
02:29:59.741 --> 02:30:03.430
to get them to lie down in a tank for two hours and think about nothing and

2635
02:30:03.431 --> 02:30:05.730
don't move,
they're going to be so uncomfortable.
Right?

2636
02:30:05.800 --> 02:30:10.210
They're going to be so freaked out because all their body is just tuned into

2637
02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:14.800
responding to this manic mind and running around and doing a bunch of things

2638
02:30:15.010 --> 02:30:17.520
like that.
When that guy shot heroin,
did you see that when you hear it,

2639
02:30:17.530 --> 02:30:18.363
did you pee?

2640
02:30:18.610 --> 02:30:21.760
You said when he was shot heroin and he's jumping up and down and move in and

2641
02:30:21.761 --> 02:30:24.000
stuff like this is Bonnie's getting his,

2642
02:30:24.130 --> 02:30:27.550
his is crazy fix when you're in that tank,

2643
02:30:27.850 --> 02:30:29.980
there's no moving on.
No,
we saw that yesterday.

2644
02:30:29.981 --> 02:30:33.910
I was in palm springs yesterday and there was just like 26 year old kid and his

2645
02:30:33.911 --> 02:30:36.520
mom was like 60 years old walking along,

2646
02:30:36.521 --> 02:30:41.170
but the kid was so obviously fucking gacked out on crystal.

2647
02:30:41.380 --> 02:30:44.290
Like he's like moving around and scratching himself in this old white haired

2648
02:30:44.291 --> 02:30:48.550
ladies,
like attempting to look and ignore the re.
I mean it's so obvious.

2649
02:30:48.551 --> 02:30:52.090
We're sitting at the intersection looking at this guy and she's like,
La,
la La.

2650
02:30:52.091 --> 02:30:55.960
We're just having a nice lunch out with Rmr son and he's scratching fucking

2651
02:30:55.961 --> 02:30:59.980
tweaking out and shit.
It's just like part bastard poor Bastow does.
Right.

2652
02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:02.260
That's a scary one.
Two.

2653
02:31:02.530 --> 02:31:06.610
That's one where you just lose all of your ability to make good judgment.

2654
02:31:06.730 --> 02:31:11.290
Crystal.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
I never did it.
I've done it.
I've done crank.

2655
02:31:11.770 --> 02:31:14.710
Was it like,
it's not pleasant for me.
It wasn't pleasant,

2656
02:31:14.860 --> 02:31:16.810
but now I think now I'm an artist,

2657
02:31:17.530 --> 02:31:20.010
but now I feel like people like us would be like,

2658
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:24.270
<v 2>I know for sure people like us would be at first have an instant feeling of
like,</v>

2659
02:31:24.660 --> 02:31:27.960
I'm so fucking creative,
you know?
And you'd be like,
I'm writing so much.

2660
02:31:27.961 --> 02:31:29.280
I've never written so much in my entire life.

2661
02:31:29.281 --> 02:31:32.640
And then a month goes by and you're like,
oh my God,
I'm a fucking nightmarish.

2662
02:31:32.641 --> 02:31:36.060
Tweaker what's happened?
I'm stuck.
Well,
that's the Adderall thing.

2663
02:31:36.140 --> 02:31:38.670
Exactly what he's done.
The Adderall.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2664
02:31:38.671 --> 02:31:41.820
I know a couple people that do the Adderall.
A lot of people do it.

2665
02:31:41.850 --> 02:31:45.450
There are problems.
They are terrible.
They're,
they're really like,

2666
02:31:45.810 --> 02:31:48.060
they're not tuned in very well.
The people around them either.

2667
02:31:48.061 --> 02:31:51.670
Have you read math land?
No.
Oh,
that's a good one.
You'd like it.
What is it?

2668
02:31:51.680 --> 02:31:56.010
It's basically about how,
uh,
how methamphetamine is like destroying the,

2669
02:31:56.220 --> 02:31:58.500
the modern Midwestern small town.

2670
02:31:58.830 --> 02:32:02.550
But it describes in pretty great detail what happens to people,

2671
02:32:02.551 --> 02:32:07.320
why people get addicted to meth because meth has,
uh,
has a,
a chemical compound.

2672
02:32:07.320 --> 02:32:08.880
The way that math gets you high,

2673
02:32:09.030 --> 02:32:12.720
it gets you high in a different and more profound way than any other drug.

2674
02:32:13.020 --> 02:32:17.460
Like it.
Uh,
it,
it takes the whatever that dopamine,
and I'm not an expert on this,

2675
02:32:17.461 --> 02:32:18.660
so I'm not going to say it exactly,

2676
02:32:18.810 --> 02:32:21.570
but whatever that dopamine release that regular drugs give you,

2677
02:32:21.750 --> 02:32:26.750
it takes that and like doubles it and also at the same time makes it harder for

2678
02:32:27.151 --> 02:32:29.340
you to produce the dopamine naturally.

2679
02:32:29.700 --> 02:32:33.510
So it makes life worse and the high better at the same time.

2680
02:32:33.720 --> 02:32:35.610
So that totally makes sense.
Well,

2681
02:32:35.611 --> 02:32:39.480
whenever you ask for more than your body wants to give,
he just force it,

2682
02:32:39.590 --> 02:32:40.980
redline it,
force it,

2683
02:32:40.981 --> 02:32:45.930
and then you have this backs off and you don't have any afterwards.

2684
02:32:45.931 --> 02:32:49.080
You,
your body loses its ability to produce it and so you give it back to it.

2685
02:32:49.260 --> 02:32:52.020
It's like that Cadillac Ron guy where he started shooting up and as he's

2686
02:32:52.021 --> 02:32:52.770
shooting up,

2687
02:32:52.770 --> 02:32:57.120
then all of a sudden he's active and moving around rambling a lot better.

2688
02:32:57.400 --> 02:33:01.350
It's still not that good,
but whatever,
it's battle rap.
It's on.
It's not my,

2689
02:33:01.440 --> 02:33:04.800
it's not my sport,
but also it's a little weird that heroin would make you,
well,

2690
02:33:04.801 --> 02:33:08.130
I'm better.
Like you said,
you should be like,
is laying on the couch.

2691
02:33:10.070 --> 02:33:12.990
I said,
you know,
it's bad.
My experience with heroin,

2692
02:33:13.110 --> 02:33:16.740
one of the big ones was this guy,
his nickname was water dog,

2693
02:33:17.160 --> 02:33:20.070
these calm water dog or buffalo bill and he was a pool player,

2694
02:33:20.850 --> 02:33:22.110
high level pool player.

2695
02:33:22.170 --> 02:33:26.160
I used to play a lot of pool when I lived in New York and this guy would gamble

2696
02:33:26.161 --> 02:33:28.410
and you'd shoot up and he would disappear.

2697
02:33:28.411 --> 02:33:33.300
He'd go in the bathroom and shoot up and come out and sit down for like 30

2698
02:33:33.301 --> 02:33:36.000
minutes and not move.
Just sit there like this,

2699
02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:38.850
just all fucked up on heroin.

2700
02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:42.450
Then he would get up and he would play pool so well.

2701
02:33:42.810 --> 02:33:46.770
It was incredible where he couldn't miss,
he couldn't miss.
He played perfect.

2702
02:33:46.860 --> 02:33:50.250
It was like perfection and you would watch him play and some of the best pool

2703
02:33:50.251 --> 02:33:51.510
I'd ever seen in my life.
You know what?

2704
02:33:51.540 --> 02:33:56.220
That actually makes sense because his ideal state was an hour after shooting up.

2705
02:33:56.221 --> 02:34:00.620
Right.
A moment after shooting up,
he's too high to function,
you know,
uh,

2706
02:34:00.740 --> 02:34:05.100
a day after shooting up,
he's getting that flu,
that sickness.
So his ideal,

2707
02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:09.600
perfect human state,
a person in that kind of addiction is,

2708
02:34:10.110 --> 02:34:13.590
you know,
the high wears down a little bit and he's like a normal person again.

2709
02:34:13.620 --> 02:34:16.770
Yeah.
He's a normal person.
And also his nerves were gone.

2710
02:34:16.830 --> 02:34:18.010
Right because worries and

2711
02:34:18.010 --> 02:34:20.800
<v 1>fears.
Like he was gambling for a lot of money.</v>

2712
02:34:20.830 --> 02:34:25.390
They're planning like tent for like $10,000.
He didn't give a fuck totally.
Again,

2713
02:34:25.510 --> 02:34:28.960
didn't give a fuck.
He just couldn't miss it.
Couldn't miss.
And he had no anxiety,

2714
02:34:29.440 --> 02:34:32.560
no anxiety and he was playing perfect and peep.
He would start,

2715
02:34:32.620 --> 02:34:36.370
the betters would get start complaining,
they would start to make like rules,

2716
02:34:36.371 --> 02:34:38.080
but he couldn't shoot up before he played.

2717
02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:42.340
There was all this shit cause it's a weird handicap.
Yeah.
They would say like,

2718
02:34:42.341 --> 02:34:44.830
look,
you know,
this guy who was playing this Guy George,

2719
02:34:44.831 --> 02:34:47.980
the Greek who led this way to talk,
he talked like this,
this motherfucker.

2720
02:34:48.250 --> 02:34:51.970
He goes into the fucking bathroom,
he shoots his shit.
He comes out,

2721
02:34:51.971 --> 02:34:55.000
he can't miss this cocksucker and he would get get all upset.

2722
02:34:55.030 --> 02:34:58.330
Like I'm not playing him.
If he's shooting up,
hey you fucking city.

2723
02:34:58.500 --> 02:35:00.970
It's any of it.
The whole time you can't shoot up.
Like they had these legs,

2724
02:35:00.990 --> 02:35:05.020
little agreements.
He wouldn't do it crazy.
He wouldn't do it.
Of course not.

2725
02:35:05.080 --> 02:35:06.070
That was his medicine.
Yeah.

2726
02:35:06.071 --> 02:35:10.510
I met him out here in Compton or are men amount here rather in um,
uh,

2727
02:35:10.540 --> 02:35:13.500
Bellflower and he wanted me to take them to Compton to,
um,

2728
02:35:13.690 --> 02:35:17.560
is it a pool tournament and want to,
to drive them in and to go get his heroin.

2729
02:35:17.561 --> 02:35:20.560
I was like,
Bitch,
I'm not driving you in a fucking Compton.
You out of your mind.

2730
02:35:20.561 --> 02:35:22.690
You could've gotten a great blowjob I here,

2731
02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:26.320
but you'll also could get your car taken away.
That's true.

2732
02:35:26.410 --> 02:35:28.750
Cause if they ever catch you buying drugs,

2733
02:35:28.990 --> 02:35:33.040
like the idea is that if you're in a car and you take someone and they're buying

2734
02:35:33.041 --> 02:35:36.680
drugs in the cops show up,
they can confiscate your car.
Big Tea.

2735
02:35:36.730 --> 02:35:38.920
There's a lot of steal from you,
which is hilarious.

2736
02:35:39.230 --> 02:35:40.540
You're doing something you're not allowed to do,

2737
02:35:40.541 --> 02:35:43.030
so we're allowed to steal your car.
Take it.
Yeah.

2738
02:35:43.060 --> 02:35:46.000
They just take your car and then the,
the government owns it.
The,

2739
02:35:46.130 --> 02:35:47.110
what does the government do?
Oh,

2740
02:35:47.250 --> 02:35:51.040
they auction at the auction and they take the proceeds and they use it to hire

2741
02:35:51.041 --> 02:35:52.180
more cops.
Not Crazy.

2742
02:35:52.210 --> 02:35:56.020
<v 2>It's all just,
and it's all just speaking of computer simulation.</v>

2743
02:35:56.170 --> 02:35:58.480
This is all just made up.
Yeah.
I think about the law all the time.

2744
02:35:58.481 --> 02:36:01.960
Just like somebody decided that we could have a law.
Actually it was Moses.

2745
02:36:02.590 --> 02:36:04.360
Moses saw the burning Bush.
He was like,
well,

2746
02:36:04.361 --> 02:36:07.270
we should make law and then all of a sudden you can get your car taken away for

2747
02:36:07.271 --> 02:36:11.440
driving water,
dog to get heroin.
I was like,
what?
How did this happen?

2748
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:13.250
<v 1>Well,
how about places in the country right now,</v>

2749
02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:16.930
2014 where it's still illegal to have sex if you're gay.

2750
02:36:17.100 --> 02:36:21.920
It's still illegal to have a oral sex,
still legal to have anal sex.
It's sodomy.

2751
02:36:22.010 --> 02:36:24.010
They have sodomy laws.
There's still,
I mean,

2752
02:36:24.020 --> 02:36:26.270
if somebody wanted to prosecute you for certain sodomy laws,

2753
02:36:26.510 --> 02:36:28.310
they still exist in certain parts of the country.

2754
02:36:28.600 --> 02:36:31.610
<v 2>That's why I embarked on my new tour,
uh,</v>

2755
02:36:31.650 --> 02:36:35.680
sodomy busters.com and where I'm going to all the sodomy law states and I'm

2756
02:36:35.681 --> 02:36:40.600
engaging in hardcore passive sodomy with enormous gay men.
That's a good move.

2757
02:36:40.630 --> 02:36:43.000
And as long as you're passive,
they can't even say anything.

2758
02:36:43.340 --> 02:36:47.400
I've only did was lay there,
give him shit.
I asked him to stop silently,

2759
02:36:47.410 --> 02:36:50.560
but he wouldn't do it as long as he did it silently.
You're clear,

2760
02:36:50.680 --> 02:36:54.040
your consciousness clear.
Did you weep?
Yeah,
definitely.

2761
02:36:54.041 --> 02:36:56.050
I weeped I whooped with joy though.

2762
02:37:01.130 --> 02:37:05.820
<v 1>Yeah.
Sodomy laws,
gay marriage laws,
all of it.</v>

2763
02:37:06.150 --> 02:37:11.150
Just anytime there's laws involving things that is a choice and things that some

2764
02:37:11.761 --> 02:37:14.790
people like and you don't imagine if there's laws on certain kinds of music.

2765
02:37:14.791 --> 02:37:17.870
I mean this is just as ridiculous as laws and certain types of sex.

2766
02:37:18.190 --> 02:37:23.190
Like you caring with someone else does that they like to do is pretty weird.

2767
02:37:23.940 --> 02:37:28.190
Alistair Crawley was right.
Do as thou wilt.
That is the whole of the law.

2768
02:37:28.510 --> 02:37:31.010
Don't hurt anybody else.
That's so satanism.

2769
02:37:31.140 --> 02:37:35.390
That's most cashiers going satanism on it.
I mean,
I'm a Jew,
but I got to say,
I,
I,

2770
02:37:35.391 --> 02:37:38.840
there's,
I believe do is do what you want.
Everybody said,
well,

2771
02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:42.430
morality based laws are ridiculous.
The only thing,

2772
02:37:43.040 --> 02:37:44.720
the only thing that makes any sense,

2773
02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:48.020
you know what to say they always harp on is protecting children.

2774
02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:50.700
So that's what it was.
Don't hurt children don't yet.

2775
02:37:50.990 --> 02:37:54.680
But they believe that somehow or another engaging an immoral activity could

2776
02:37:54.681 --> 02:37:58.220
somehow influence children or trickle back.
Send the wrong message.

2777
02:37:58.310 --> 02:38:03.140
Like one of those crazy hot fox news chicks,
the laws in Colorado.

2778
02:38:03.141 --> 02:38:07.220
Do you think this is sending the wrong message to the children?
Meanwhile,

2779
02:38:07.221 --> 02:38:10.850
the wrong message is being sent to the children currently by the system we have

2780
02:38:10.851 --> 02:38:14.750
in place.
Not just the wrong message,
only wrong messages,

2781
02:38:16.070 --> 02:38:20.690
messages or the Ma.
It's like,
well,
we're fucked.
Healthcare's fucked.

2782
02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:24.470
You know,
everything costs too much money tax that we need more money from taxes.

2783
02:38:24.500 --> 02:38:28.700
Oh,
we're going to war here.
We've got to watch out.
I ran my,
blow us up.
Oh,

2784
02:38:28.701 --> 02:38:33.080
Russia is going to blow up Ukraine.
Uh,
it's just the messages are terrible.

2785
02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:36.560
The news can't just be a event.
It just,

2786
02:38:36.590 --> 02:38:39.440
if you guys are pretending that you're some sort of a moral voice,

2787
02:38:39.710 --> 02:38:41.030
if you're pretending that you know,

2788
02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:43.940
is this sending the wrong message to the children?

2789
02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:47.870
It can't just be events and and points of controversy.
You've,

2790
02:38:47.940 --> 02:38:50.330
if you've taken on that responsibility,

2791
02:38:50.480 --> 02:38:54.230
then you also have the responsibility since you're broadcasting to millions of

2792
02:38:54.231 --> 02:38:59.231
people to somehow or another it luminate certain ideas somehow or another

2793
02:38:59.690 --> 02:39:03.350
elevate cultural ideas and give people these,

2794
02:39:03.380 --> 02:39:08.180
these possibilities of of of good these possibilities of good nature,

2795
02:39:08.181 --> 02:39:10.640
of good,
of good,
good future of,

2796
02:39:10.700 --> 02:39:15.700
of good human behavior instead of the majority of it just being eye catching.

2797
02:39:15.891 --> 02:39:17.840
If it bleeds,
it leads bullshit.

2798
02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:21.470
There's a lot going on that's good and nobody hears about it.

2799
02:39:21.770 --> 02:39:23.600
There's a lot going on.
That's great.

2800
02:39:23.630 --> 02:39:27.110
There's a lot of beauty in the world and you're concentrating continually on

2801
02:39:27.111 --> 02:39:32.000
negative.
The perspective is that if it's negative,
then somehow or another,

2802
02:39:32.001 --> 02:39:36.650
it's important to know the news as we get it.
It's important to know,

2803
02:39:36.860 --> 02:39:39.950
but it's just as important to know about all these positive things,

2804
02:39:39.951 --> 02:39:43.880
if not more important.
When you look at this 7 billion,

2805
02:39:43.940 --> 02:39:48.160
300 million in this continent,
you look at this,
this country rather,

2806
02:39:48.180 --> 02:39:48.861
you look at this,

2807
02:39:48.861 --> 02:39:53.720
this like perspective of like good shit to bad shit.
Well,

2808
02:39:53.721 --> 02:39:57.410
you're getting on the news.
He's not balanced at all.
It's not fair and balanced.

2809
02:39:57.411 --> 02:40:01.040
You fucking assholes are concentrating almost entirely on the bad shit.

2810
02:40:01.370 --> 02:40:05.540
You're concentrating almost entirely on nonsense when it comes to like marijuana

2811
02:40:05.541 --> 02:40:08.030
laws and sending message to the children.

2812
02:40:08.031 --> 02:40:12.680
That's seconds that you wasted actually saying that you fucked America.

2813
02:40:12.890 --> 02:40:15.720
You hate America with your shitty choices and how you projected.

2814
02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:19.500
<v 4>Thanks.
Well,
it's like a terrorism.
You know the idea of what terrorism is.</v>

2815
02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:23.080
It's like you were saying,
a few people do a terrible thing,

2816
02:40:23.410 --> 02:40:26.350
but most people aren't doing a terrible thing.
Yeah,
but terrorism,

2817
02:40:26.351 --> 02:40:29.830
it's goal is not to create damage,
but to create terror,

2818
02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:32.350
to make people afraid to go out.

2819
02:40:32.590 --> 02:40:35.650
Even though all they did was blow up one school bus.

2820
02:40:36.400 --> 02:40:39.610
Now everybody's afraid to send their kids to school on the bus.
Well,

2821
02:40:39.611 --> 02:40:41.980
the news is doing the same thing.
It's just,
you know,

2822
02:40:41.981 --> 02:40:44.290
it's just doing that over the over mass media airwaves.

2823
02:40:44.291 --> 02:40:47.920
It's like creating a small amount of terror so that everybody's afraid all the

2824
02:40:47.921 --> 02:40:49.330
time.
Or if you want to go

2825
02:40:49.460 --> 02:40:50.870
<v 1>full on Alex Jones,</v>

2826
02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:55.970
then you say what the news is actually doing is reporting these instances and

2827
02:40:55.971 --> 02:41:00.380
these instances are in fact designed to keep people scared and keep the military

2828
02:41:00.381 --> 02:41:04.730
industrial complex in a position where they can demand massive amounts of money

2829
02:41:04.940 --> 02:41:08.090
because they have to protect you from these horrific events that happen

2830
02:41:08.091 --> 02:41:09.170
incredibly rarely.

2831
02:41:09.290 --> 02:41:13.880
But we need almost all of your money all day long to stop them from happening.

2832
02:41:13.881 --> 02:41:17.150
And the only reason why they're not taking place every day like fucking popcorn

2833
02:41:17.151 --> 02:41:21.770
in the microwave just pop up pop up because because of the good men and women of

2834
02:41:21.771 --> 02:41:25.880
this government to protecting you from the horrible realities of terrorism.

2835
02:41:26.040 --> 02:41:29.610
<v 4>I believe that except that I believe that it's even scarier than that,</v>

2836
02:41:29.611 --> 02:41:32.930
which is that there's no diabolical man behind the curtain.
It's like,

2837
02:41:33.060 --> 02:41:36.990
it's like a robot that we've created a consciousness robot that we've created

2838
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:40.560
and even the people that are perpetuating that believe that it's the truth.

2839
02:41:40.561 --> 02:41:44.400
So there's no one to say,
hey,
this is crazy.
We have to stop.

2840
02:41:44.401 --> 02:41:48.900
Cause everybody on every level of the stratosphere believes that we're engaged

2841
02:41:48.901 --> 02:41:51.930
in something necessary and good and proper.

2842
02:41:52.190 --> 02:41:56.540
<v 1>Yeah.
Well that's like when people talk about television programming and they go,</v>

2843
02:41:56.541 --> 02:42:00.950
well you know,
television programming is designed to make people stupid.

2844
02:42:01.190 --> 02:42:03.170
They get together and they think about,

2845
02:42:03.530 --> 02:42:06.290
well I can tell you for a fact that's not true.
How can I tell you?

2846
02:42:06.291 --> 02:42:10.610
Because I hosted fear factor or if anybody was doing something designed to make

2847
02:42:10.611 --> 02:42:12.800
people stupid,
it's fucking fear factor.

2848
02:42:12.980 --> 02:42:17.690
And I hosted that shit for 148 episodes and that's not what it is.

2849
02:42:17.780 --> 02:42:20.680
What it is is people like stupid shit.
Right?

2850
02:42:20.690 --> 02:42:24.200
So if you make something really stupid,
it's sells.
And if it sells,

2851
02:42:24.201 --> 02:42:25.220
everybody makes money.

2852
02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:30.080
And that's why it was created 100% to all conspiracy theories.

2853
02:42:30.260 --> 02:42:32.030
Throw him out the window when it comes to that.

2854
02:42:32.031 --> 02:42:34.520
There's no government agencies that come to the set and say,

2855
02:42:35.210 --> 02:42:39.050
you guys are making this show too fucking smart.
We need a dumb,

2856
02:42:39.260 --> 02:42:41.280
if we don't have a dumb,
we're not going to have enough soldiers.

2857
02:42:41.450 --> 02:42:44.300
We don't have enough soldiers.
This fucking country is going to melt.

2858
02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:49.160
That doesn't happen.
No guy shows up with a fucking white crew cut and a cigar.

2859
02:42:49.490 --> 02:42:53.590
You know,
like looking like some military guy from a Spiderman comics

2860
02:42:53.770 --> 02:42:54.250
<v 4>book.</v>

2861
02:42:54.250 --> 02:42:58.060
But the reality that you're talking about is scarier because when there is a

2862
02:42:58.061 --> 02:42:59.590
white crew cut guy,

2863
02:42:59.860 --> 02:43:02.550
then the people can realize what's happening and overthrow them.

2864
02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:05.980
They can take them out.
That's right.
Spider man can come save the day.

2865
02:43:06.130 --> 02:43:08.080
There's no Spiderman that's going to save the day.

2866
02:43:08.470 --> 02:43:11.770
It's the spider web like consciousness raising that we all gain

2867
02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:17.400
<v 0>by hour indulgence in Ibogaine.
That would certainly help.</v>

2868
02:43:17.550 --> 02:43:18.640
No,
but it is.

2869
02:43:18.641 --> 02:43:21.940
Eventually we're just going to have to either wake up or go to sleep completely.

2870
02:43:22.060 --> 02:43:25.150
Well,
there's a reality that not everyone's going to play that game.

2871
02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:30.040
So if you did have some sort of a psychedelic revelation,

2872
02:43:30.340 --> 02:43:35.340
if you did have a whole country that had embraced these new ideas and had tried

2873
02:43:37.271 --> 02:43:42.160
to turn the,
the current culture that we have today into a more peaceful,

2874
02:43:42.490 --> 02:43:46.510
more self aware,
more sustainable culture,

2875
02:43:46.710 --> 02:43:50.950
still got to deal with Africa and he's still got a deal with Iran,

2876
02:43:50.951 --> 02:43:54.490
you still got to deal with Russia with all these parts of the world that may or

2877
02:43:54.491 --> 02:43:59.320
may not be playing that game,
but you're hopeful.
Yes,
I am.
You were hopeful.

2878
02:43:59.350 --> 02:44:00.910
Yeah,
for sure.
Yeah,
for sure.

2879
02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:05.110
Without a doubt and things could go terribly wrong at any point in time along

2880
02:44:05.111 --> 02:44:08.620
this hopeful,
but I,
I think I'm hopeful that we'll rebuild after that.
Look,

2881
02:44:08.621 --> 02:44:12.190
I think that Yellowstone might blow up and kill everyone on this fucking

2882
02:44:12.250 --> 02:44:16.650
continent.
It's very possible.
That's a continent killer.
If that does happen.

2883
02:44:16.690 --> 02:44:20.370
Yellowstone,
what about Jelly stone?
That's not real.
That's Yogi.

2884
02:44:21.300 --> 02:44:25.280
Yogi,
Yogi.
That could blow at any moment.
There could be a big picnic basket.

2885
02:44:26.460 --> 02:44:29.930
Is that not true?
No.
Why is Yellowstone?
I'm going to kill us all.
Yellowstone,

2886
02:44:30.070 --> 02:44:35.070
they discovered in the early two thousands as a called Dara volcano that's 300

2887
02:44:35.711 --> 02:44:40.711
miles wide that at one point in time Yellowstone was like a mountain and the

2888
02:44:41.531 --> 02:44:46.531
mountain blew up a 300 mile wide mountain blew up and filled the sky with

2889
02:44:47.711 --> 02:44:52.630
fucking molten lava and nuclear winter and kills everything in the continent.

2890
02:44:52.631 --> 02:44:56.650
It happens every 600 to 800,000 years.
It's going to happen again.

2891
02:44:56.950 --> 02:45:00.550
And the last time it happened was 600,000 years ago.
Oh my God,

2892
02:45:00.670 --> 02:45:02.770
that's the most terrible thing I've ever heard in my life.

2893
02:45:02.900 --> 02:45:06.670
And isn't it funny like the moment that it blows everyone on earth while

2894
02:45:06.671 --> 02:45:11.320
simultaneously just go,
oh,
Islam,
Christianity,

2895
02:45:11.350 --> 02:45:15.640
capitalism,
socialism,
gun control and sanity,
rape culture,

2896
02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:19.870
my career,
my girlfriend,
my personal.
It'll just be like,
oh,
none of it mattered.

2897
02:45:19.871 --> 02:45:20.740
And then we're all dead.

2898
02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:25.270
It's just like an immediate like consciousness raised where everybody just goes,

2899
02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:30.190
oh,
it was all about the volcano this whole time.
But for that moment,

2900
02:45:30.191 --> 02:45:34.090
that will be from the moment before it kills you or if you're unlucky for the

2901
02:45:34.091 --> 02:45:37.900
moment.
If you're like in Maryland and it takes a long time to kill you,

2902
02:45:38.500 --> 02:45:41.500
that's the straight into having sex,
right?
What would you do?

2903
02:45:41.860 --> 02:45:44.530
I don't think you'd get it up.
I guarantee your kid,

2904
02:45:44.531 --> 02:45:48.160
you're not going to get it up.
If the sky is filled with molten ash,
oh my God,

2905
02:45:48.970 --> 02:45:53.050
are we dead immediately?
Most likely.
Most likely.
California is fucked.

2906
02:45:53.140 --> 02:45:55.930
It's just not that far.
There's like a death zone.

2907
02:45:56.290 --> 02:46:00.820
There's a death zone that's like several states over and then there's like the

2908
02:46:00.821 --> 02:46:02.380
east coast,
the Far East Coast,

2909
02:46:02.381 --> 02:46:05.030
which you know they're going to be dealing with zombies.

2910
02:46:05.031 --> 02:46:07.960
They're going to have to put fences up because people were just going to be half

2911
02:46:07.961 --> 02:46:11.120
molten,
wandering through the fucking desert on the way to New York.

2912
02:46:11.540 --> 02:46:13.880
It's going to be fucked and there'd be nothing growing.

2913
02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:17.900
The climate will change the whole,
the whole country will cool.

2914
02:46:18.110 --> 02:46:20.360
That's what I've been talking about that a lot.

2915
02:46:20.390 --> 02:46:24.200
That notion that like there we won't do anything,

2916
02:46:24.770 --> 02:46:26.750
especially as it relates to global warming.

2917
02:46:26.780 --> 02:46:31.780
We won't do anything until it is too late because it being too late will be the

2918
02:46:32.481 --> 02:46:37.040
evidence that we all need that will,
that will motivate us to do something.

2919
02:46:37.370 --> 02:46:39.350
Yeah.
I don't think that there's anything they can do.

2920
02:46:39.350 --> 02:46:42.290
They say that if they stopped carbon emissions right now,

2921
02:46:42.410 --> 02:46:47.410
if everyone just stopped burning coal and stop driving cars and cows stopped

2922
02:46:48.081 --> 02:46:49.910
farting,
there's still,

2923
02:46:49.940 --> 02:46:54.940
the process is like almost inexorably begun the process of at least getting to a

2924
02:46:55.101 --> 02:46:58.160
certain point of warming and not just warming but,

2925
02:46:58.580 --> 02:47:02.440
but the massive shifts in the,
the,
the,

2926
02:47:02.580 --> 02:47:05.300
the like the differences between,

2927
02:47:05.330 --> 02:47:09.470
it was like cold and warm that the weather become more volatile,

2928
02:47:09.471 --> 02:47:10.970
storms become more frequent.

2929
02:47:11.270 --> 02:47:14.270
They're like almost nothing they could do about that at this point in time.

2930
02:47:14.570 --> 02:47:18.590
Can I just do what I want with impunity and just say super volcano at the end of

2931
02:47:18.591 --> 02:47:19.550
every behavior?
No,

2932
02:47:19.551 --> 02:47:23.990
because then if you become some epic Gingiss con con and then the future

2933
02:47:23.991 --> 02:47:27.570
remembers you is that there isn't a future them off,

2934
02:47:27.830 --> 02:47:30.500
but it's going to be a future for people in Australia.
Don't make it.

2935
02:47:30.890 --> 02:47:33.250
We should all move to Australia.
That's the move.
If,
if,

2936
02:47:33.390 --> 02:47:37.060
if Yellowstone starts rambling,
I'm living in Sydney Bitch.
I love it over there.

2937
02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:39.890
What makes you think you'll be able to get on a flight to Sydney?

2938
02:47:39.891 --> 02:47:42.800
Cause I'm like one of them dogs that runs from tsunamis,
Bro.

2939
02:47:42.801 --> 02:47:47.150
I'm in tune with the mother nature.
It was just like fucking,
I just,

2940
02:47:47.151 --> 02:47:49.970
I'll be in my tank and I'd be like telling my family it's time to go to

2941
02:47:49.971 --> 02:47:50.804
Australia.

2942
02:47:51.080 --> 02:47:55.430
So the moment Fox News pipes on in world news tonight there is lots of death and

2943
02:47:55.431 --> 02:47:59.720
murder.
But first a story from Yellowstone national park and a bit of rumbling

2944
02:47:59.721 --> 02:48:02.840
underneath America's favorite part.
You decide,

2945
02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:06.020
do you know they have thousands of earthquakes in Yellowstone every year?

2946
02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:08.930
Thousands.
I really don't like this.

2947
02:48:10.100 --> 02:48:12.800
It's just a matter of time.
It is a matter of time.

2948
02:48:12.801 --> 02:48:15.620
But it might be a hundred thousand years,
might be 200,000 years.

2949
02:48:15.620 --> 02:48:19.580
That's a long fucking time.
But it literally might be today.
It could be soon.

2950
02:48:20.030 --> 02:48:21.200
We'll think.
They would know,

2951
02:48:21.201 --> 02:48:23.930
they'd have good indications that some activity was going on.

2952
02:48:23.931 --> 02:48:26.930
But I think it would be like one of those movies where,
you know,

2953
02:48:27.320 --> 02:48:31.160
one of those fucking Armageddon type movies where there would be one scientist

2954
02:48:31.161 --> 02:48:32.990
who had figured out but no one would believe him.

2955
02:48:32.991 --> 02:48:36.260
And he'd be yelling and he would get arrested cause he'd break into the TV

2956
02:48:36.261 --> 02:48:38.960
studio.
You know,
we need a wine people.

2957
02:48:38.961 --> 02:48:43.580
Y'alls tone is kind of blow and they pull them out and it's a,
who would it be?

2958
02:48:43.850 --> 02:48:47.980
Bradley Cooper,
maybe Bradley Cooper.
They didn't handcuff him and he screaming,

2959
02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:53.480
you were all going to die and then we all die and then you would be driving just

2960
02:48:55.011 --> 02:48:56.960
driving on the left hand side.
That's all you have to do.

2961
02:48:56.990 --> 02:48:59.720
But how do you get there?
Aren't all the flights going to be full?
Getting a boat?

2962
02:48:59.750 --> 02:49:02.480
You got to get on a boat,
a really quick boat and get there quickly.
No,

2963
02:49:02.620 --> 02:49:04.840
it would take forever.
You have to fucking fly.

2964
02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:09.720
If it takes 16 hours at 500 miles an hour and a fucking plane and do the math,

2965
02:49:10.530 --> 02:49:13.710
what does that,
that's a lot.
It's many thousands of miles.

2966
02:49:13.770 --> 02:49:16.320
It's fucking terrible from here to Australia.

2967
02:49:16.730 --> 02:49:19.630
<v 4>Yeah.
Take 40 days,
something like that.
On a boat.
Yeah,</v>

2968
02:49:19.670 --> 02:49:24.350
just saw this like a fat one you beat and each other 22 days.

2969
02:49:24.351 --> 02:49:27.710
So this great documentary about this Dutch girl that took a boat around the

2970
02:49:27.711 --> 02:49:29.900
world,
just 14 years old,
youngest person ever to do it

2971
02:49:29.950 --> 02:49:34.840
<v 0>by herself.
Her parents are assholes.
No,
they're cool.
They're ass holes and no,</v>

2972
02:49:34.841 --> 02:49:37.930
I think they're cool.
They could stick it,
suck it.
Their parents are idiots.

2973
02:49:38.530 --> 02:49:40.900
Fucking lit.
A 14 year old.
Go around the world.

2974
02:49:40.930 --> 02:49:44.470
She's 14 how about wait until she's 18 because then she wouldn't be the youngest

2975
02:49:44.471 --> 02:49:48.250
person to do it.
So fucking stupid.
She did it though.
Good.
Who Cares?

2976
02:49:49.060 --> 02:49:51.040
I've been around the world too.
I don't want any credit for it.

2977
02:49:51.560 --> 02:49:56.470
Got in a fucking plane.
Oh,
she did it by boat.
Amazing.
What a person.
I mean,

2978
02:49:56.530 --> 02:49:59.730
but according to your own logic though,
who cares if her parents,

2979
02:50:00.040 --> 02:50:02.440
I mean the fucking supervolcano man.
No,

2980
02:50:02.470 --> 02:50:06.430
because she might live to be a ripe old age and influence people in a very

2981
02:50:06.431 --> 02:50:09.070
positive way or get eaten by sharks at 14,

2982
02:50:09.340 --> 02:50:12.490
because her parents were fucking retarded and they let her get on a raft and

2983
02:50:12.491 --> 02:50:16.930
they pushed her out to the ocean.
We love you,
but float on young soldier

2984
02:50:18.700 --> 02:50:21.610
shine on you.
Crazy diamond that she has a hard to do.

2985
02:50:21.940 --> 02:50:25.210
I'm sure she's got a book deal or parents are assholes.
They're fucking,

2986
02:50:25.211 --> 02:50:27.790
they're probably trying to cash in on her like little beaver parents.

2987
02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:28.833
I don't know.

2988
02:50:28.850 --> 02:50:32.000
<v 4>I was thinking watching it,
uh,
like,
you know what,</v>

2989
02:50:32.030 --> 02:50:35.840
like w it's not valuable to keep your children alive.
Hold on,

2990
02:50:36.500 --> 02:50:39.890
wait for it.
But it's just like every parent keeps her children alive.

2991
02:50:39.980 --> 02:50:41.450
But to keeping them alive for what?

2992
02:50:41.451 --> 02:50:44.750
Like to give him a true experience of life that's so much more valuable than

2993
02:50:44.751 --> 02:50:48.440
just keeping them like their heart beating and them making sure that they're

2994
02:50:48.620 --> 02:50:50.840
eating food,
that everybody should do that.

2995
02:50:51.110 --> 02:50:53.600
But to make your children have a life that's worth living.

2996
02:50:53.630 --> 02:50:58.250
I feel like it's worth risk that my point is like there was this,
uh,

2997
02:50:58.280 --> 02:51:01.670
this family who was living on a boat abroad and they had a little baby and then

2998
02:51:01.970 --> 02:51:04.490
that was on this last week's episode of this American Life.

2999
02:51:04.491 --> 02:51:07.080
They had a baby and they had to call the navy to rescue them cause their boats

3000
02:51:07.081 --> 02:51:10.220
started taking on water and everybody was like,
you're the worst parents ever.

3001
02:51:10.221 --> 02:51:12.050
Why would you have a baby at see all this stuff?

3002
02:51:12.290 --> 02:51:15.920
But it's just like there's so many people having such a regular experience of

3003
02:51:15.921 --> 02:51:17.570
life like this,

3004
02:51:17.840 --> 02:51:20.960
whoever this baby would have been at [inaudible] and the baby lived,

3005
02:51:21.430 --> 02:51:24.800
is it going to have such a more intense and unique experience of life?

3006
02:51:24.801 --> 02:51:29.801
Like I don't feel like it's that valuable to have a safety in world where you

3007
02:51:31.131 --> 02:51:34.190
know,
you make sure your baby's okay at all moments at all time.

3008
02:51:34.370 --> 02:51:38.150
Then to give a kid an experience of a,
of an exciting life.

3009
02:51:38.250 --> 02:51:41.880
<v 0>Well,
I think there's definitely a balance when it comes to risk and reward.</v>

3010
02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:42.571
You know,
and I,

3011
02:51:42.571 --> 02:51:47.500
I say this as a person who's fought full contact martial arts tournaments.
I've,

3012
02:51:47.501 --> 02:51:52.320
I've probably had,
I don't know how many amateur fights I had,

3013
02:51:52.830 --> 02:51:57.210
but is over 50 easily.
It was probably a close to a hundred.
I don't know.

3014
02:51:57.211 --> 02:52:02.040
I did it for five years,
basically almost every week or constantly.

3015
02:52:02.041 --> 02:52:05.470
I was constantly competing and sometimes he'd fight two,
three times in day.

3016
02:52:06.190 --> 02:52:09.460
<v 1>And then all the times that I trained and spark in the gym,</v>

3017
02:52:09.461 --> 02:52:13.060
which a lot of them were just basically fights.
I did a lot of risky shit.

3018
02:52:13.390 --> 02:52:15.070
So I don't,
I'm not averse to risk,

3019
02:52:15.340 --> 02:52:20.260
but the risk of competition,
I believe there's that.

3020
02:52:20.280 --> 02:52:24.550
What would I feel about martial arts,
and this is,

3021
02:52:24.640 --> 02:52:26.740
I say this was extreme bias,

3022
02:52:26.741 --> 02:52:30.400
but I've always said that martial arts are a vehicle for developing your human

3023
02:52:30.401 --> 02:52:30.911
potential.

3024
02:52:30.911 --> 02:52:33.970
And then in doing something incredibly difficult but getting really good at it,

3025
02:52:34.300 --> 02:52:38.230
you develop this intense focus that you could apply to all these other things

3026
02:52:38.650 --> 02:52:43.420
and you can see that thing well and find that path,
whether it's in,

3027
02:52:43.720 --> 02:52:44.311
you know,
uh,

3028
02:52:44.311 --> 02:52:49.180
an art form or anything else that you decided to pursue that learning how to do

3029
02:52:49.181 --> 02:52:52.660
a martial art and because it's so difficult and because it's so challenging and

3030
02:52:52.661 --> 02:52:56.950
that you learn a lot about learning and you learn a lot about character and

3031
02:52:56.951 --> 02:52:59.320
focus that that can be applied to other things.

3032
02:52:59.650 --> 02:53:03.100
I don't know if that could be the case about a 14 year old in a fucking boat in

3033
02:53:03.101 --> 02:53:06.350
the middle of the ocean that gets eaten by a shark.
I don't know.
I mean,

3034
02:53:07.060 --> 02:53:09.910
she got lucky.
She made it.
She got lucky.
She's zig when she could have said,

3035
02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:12.910
by the way,
I was watching this fucking animal planet.
What was,

3036
02:53:12.970 --> 02:53:17.740
when did the animal planet just start lying to us and around the Mermaid Times?

3037
02:53:17.741 --> 02:53:20.560
These motherfuckers have a new one on Megla dawn's.

3038
02:53:20.890 --> 02:53:23.380
They have a new one that's so fake.

3039
02:53:23.560 --> 02:53:27.310
And I'm watching this and my kids are asking me if they're really our 75 foot

3040
02:53:27.311 --> 02:53:28.144
long sharks.

3041
02:53:28.420 --> 02:53:33.110
They have this picture of this that they're pretending is a whale and the whale

3042
02:53:33.111 --> 02:53:34.810
that's been bitten in half by a shark.

3043
02:53:34.811 --> 02:53:38.140
But it's all like a highly detailed computer generated picture.

3044
02:53:38.410 --> 02:53:41.050
But as someone who knows with CGI,
looks like I'm looking,
I'm like,

3045
02:53:41.051 --> 02:53:41.950
this is bullshit.

3046
02:53:42.250 --> 02:53:45.430
And is someone who pays attention to whether or not Megler dawn's actually
exist.

3047
02:53:45.431 --> 02:53:46.900
I'm like,
they don't fucking exist.

3048
02:53:47.350 --> 02:53:51.700
And then they showed this photo from World War II that shows a giant shark that

3049
02:53:51.701 --> 02:53:56.320
was near a u boat and like the fuck it does.
So you're just lying.
Made Up.

3050
02:53:56.330 --> 02:54:01.210
Creature eats a complete work of fiction.
Complete work.
Let me pull it up,

3051
02:54:01.211 --> 02:54:04.990
cause I know,
I know it is,
but I need to know meg.
Dawn,

3052
02:54:05.530 --> 02:54:08.980
a show is fake.
It's total bullshit.

3053
02:54:09.130 --> 02:54:11.850
But they don't tell you that you,

3054
02:54:11.860 --> 02:54:16.480
you watch it and you think that there's really some sort of a fucking giant

3055
02:54:16.481 --> 02:54:17.500
shark out there.

3056
02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:22.680
Discovery Channel perverts provokes outrage with fake shark week documentary.

3057
02:54:25.100 --> 02:54:30.100
Um,
this is,
yeah.
Mengele dawn,
the monster shark that lives,

3058
02:54:30.101 --> 02:54:35.101
it's a completely fake documentary with fake Cgi and everything.

3059
02:54:37.630 --> 02:54:42.490
And people or act out in scientists are fucking furious.

3060
02:54:42.520 --> 02:54:44.420
Like,
here's the guy who tweeted this.
Uh,

3061
02:54:44.460 --> 02:54:46.660
his name is David Schuffman please our tea.

3062
02:54:46.690 --> 02:54:50.890
I'm a professional shark scientist and I can unequivocably state that mega don

3063
02:54:50.891 --> 02:54:53.620
is extinct and he writes this thing on shark week,

3064
02:54:53.920 --> 02:54:57.560
but they have these fake photos.
Oh,
it was once real,
well,

3065
02:54:57.561 --> 02:55:01.900
a long time ago,
like millions of years ago.
It was a real shark,

3066
02:55:01.901 --> 02:55:03.040
just a big shark.

3067
02:55:03.350 --> 02:55:08.350
And they think that the shark went extinct because it fed on enormous whales and

3068
02:55:08.391 --> 02:55:09.470
that the sperm whales,

3069
02:55:09.620 --> 02:55:13.160
a lot of them might have figured out a way to get away from the sharks by going

3070
02:55:13.161 --> 02:55:16.040
into colder water.
So by going into colder water,

3071
02:55:16.041 --> 02:55:18.770
the sharks couldn't survive in that water.
And so they managed to live,

3072
02:55:18.771 --> 02:55:22.190
but the sharks didn't have enough food and so they went extinct.

3073
02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:25.100
It's fucking horrible though,
that they did this because look,

3074
02:55:25.101 --> 02:55:26.480
the mermaid thing is like,

3075
02:55:26.481 --> 02:55:29.990
you gotta be an asshole if you believe is really mermaids.
You know,
I get it.

3076
02:55:29.991 --> 02:55:31.970
If you're really stupid,
it's Kinda mean,

3077
02:55:32.210 --> 02:55:37.010
but this megalodon thing is bullshit because it looks real as fuck.

3078
02:55:37.190 --> 02:55:38.960
You're,
you're watching these people talk,

3079
02:55:38.961 --> 02:55:41.600
they're talking about their experiences.
It seems God damn real.

3080
02:55:42.470 --> 02:55:46.460
And they did it all just for ratings.
He's fuck heads.
It's really awful,
man.

3081
02:55:46.970 --> 02:55:50.090
It's really gross because you know they didn't,

3082
02:55:50.180 --> 02:55:54.660
it's not like there was some new movie piece of shit movie with Shannon Doherty.

3083
02:55:54.670 --> 02:55:58.640
Remember Shannen Doherty sure is these killer lampreys but it's obviously a

3084
02:55:58.641 --> 02:56:01.280
movie.
It's so stupid.
We're running out of time here.

3085
02:56:01.910 --> 02:56:04.940
Three hours and then we turn into a pumpkin.
