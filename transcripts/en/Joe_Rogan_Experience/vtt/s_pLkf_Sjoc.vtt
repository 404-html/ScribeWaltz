00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.400
Are we on the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by on it dot.

2
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.020
Look at that mother fucker.

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.750
Got a new way of doing it on this though.

4
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:13.200
I'm not,

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.460
I'm not down with windows yet.

6
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:14.671
Dude,

7
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:15.600
I'm still confused.

8
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.930
We're brought to you by [inaudible] dot com if you go to on it,

9
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:21.720
that's o n n I t.com.

10
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.531
You will see that,

11
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:22.710
uh,

12
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.350
not only do we have the supplements that we've always had in,

13
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:28.530
but now we have kettle bells and battle ropes.

14
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.041
Uh,

15
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:31.500
so if you want to be all manly like Tito Ortiz,

16
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.650
get your swole on Sun.

17
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.470
Uh,

18
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.870
what are kettlebells is a long conversation.

19
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:37.171
Folks,

20
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:38.580
if you're not familiar with the exercise,

21
00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:39.780
I suggest first of all,

22
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.510
go get yourself a personal training before you start slinging around cannon

23
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:43.560
balls because,

24
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:43.970
uh,

25
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.430
it gets complicated and you could hit yourself in the head and people have died,

26
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.330
I'm sure anyway.

27
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.360
And people have died from weaver emotes.

28
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.830
Well,

29
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.091
yeah,

30
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:51.451
they have,

31
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:52.020
right?

32
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.900
How many people have died from,

33
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.590
we can promote flying off into capitalism.

34
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.371
It's been a few,

35
00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:56.721
right?

36
00:00:56.721 --> 00:00:58.230
People probably have died,

37
00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.770
right?

38
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.240
I know people have died from coconuts.

39
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:03.240
I know 150 people die every year because of coconuts.

40
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.670
Coconuts fall hit you in the head and you're dead.

41
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:06.570
One 50 a year.

42
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.691
Oh,

43
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.530
you can multiply cook and I buy like 10 years.

44
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.660
She get that and Kettle Bell,

45
00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:09.901
right?

46
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:10.170
Yeah,

47
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.003
probably.

48
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.930
You got to think all these fucking idiots.

49
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.820
Think about all the knuckleheads you see at the gym.

50
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.420
All right?

51
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.500
Don't be that guy.

52
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.423
First of all,

53
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.821
if you're,

54
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:19.140
if you're really interested in it,

55
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:20.730
I suggest start off very light.

56
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.700
There's a workout that I do call the extreme kettlebell cardio workout.

57
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.110
35 pound kettle bell.

58
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.890
That's it.

59
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.910
It seems like nothing,

60
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.781
but I'm telling you,

61
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:31.170
if you do all the exercises in that DVD will fucking kick your ass.

62
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.210
I 35 out care.

63
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.680
Well,

64
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.530
we'll kick it will kick your ass is crazy,

65
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:34.861
right?

66
00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:35.011
Sure.

67
00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:35.850
I worked out with them.

68
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:36.980
They actually will kick some ass.

69
00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:37.100
Yeah.

70
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.760
Tito motherfucking Ortiz.

71
00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:39.594
Okay.

72
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.830
The longest reigning UFC light heavyweight champion ever working out with a 35

73
00:01:43.831 --> 00:01:44.430
pound Kettlebell.

74
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.510
It's that ridiculous.

75
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.040
It gives you functional strength.

76
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:47.820
And unlike,

77
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.653
um,

78
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.110
look,

79
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.891
any lifting weights,

80
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:50.724
we'll get you stronger.

81
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.770
It's a real simple pick things up.

82
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.021
Your,

83
00:01:53.021 --> 00:01:54.060
your body will respond,

84
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:54.870
you will get stronger.

85
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.703
It's a very simple,

86
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.050
but in order to maximize your time,

87
00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:59.670
there's two beautiful things about kettlebells.

88
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.470
One of them is that it uses your whole body as one unit by slinging these kettle

89
00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:05.250
bells around.

90
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.380
You have to concentrate in your posture.

91
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:08.490
You have to tighten up your core,

92
00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:09.150
you have to cut you off,

93
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.350
you,

94
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.320
yours and your legs.

95
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.500
He using your back using all of it together as one big unit and instead of like

96
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:18.390
curls or tricep extensions,

97
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.010
then that shit will make you stronger.

98
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.610
But as far as something that's going to be able to apply directly in Catholics,

99
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.010
I think kettlebells or one of the best things you can ever do,

100
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:28.290
and if you wanted to pick out one way to work out,

101
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.303
that's one of them.

102
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.761
Um,

103
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:30.150
it's,

104
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.050
it's one of the best ones.

105
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.250
Olympic lift weights,

106
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.110
that's good too.

107
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.331
You know,

108
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:35.070
cleans and presses and shit like that.

109
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.440
It's just you want to use your whole body as one unit.

110
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.850
If you're interested in Kettlebells,

111
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:43.020
we sell the best quality Troy cattle bells that you can fucking buy.

112
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.670
They're the perfect cattle bell.

113
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.650
They will be here long after you're dead.

114
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.640
They will find them when there's archeologists from the future who don't even

115
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:53.880
use words anymore and communicate with telekinesis and they're digging up holes

116
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.220
where human society in 2012 used to be,

117
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.850
they'll fund is fucking cannon ball with a handle on and go one.

118
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.610
If I lead their pyramid,

119
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.221
<v 1>it'll be those,</v>

120
00:03:02.221 --> 00:03:02.470
uh,

121
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.801
those,

122
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:03.220
yeah,

123
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.550
<v 0>my old old mech heads that they find in Peru,</v>

124
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:07.840
they don't know what the fuck they are,

125
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.740
you know?

126
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.340
Um,

127
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.791
so,

128
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:10.180
uh,

129
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.650
go and check all that shit out.

130
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.040
Alpha brain of course is the number one supplement that we have still.

131
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.610
Uh,

132
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.061
if you're,

133
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:18.040
if you're interested in any of that stuff as well,

134
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:19.990
I always suggest you gotta Google it.

135
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.540
You got to be educated on anything you're taking.

136
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.480
Is that Alpha brain.

137
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.550
Oh,

138
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.383
that's good to,

139
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.850
uh,

140
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:26.840
what does knew mood knew ladies?

141
00:03:26.841 --> 00:03:30.030
I have five HTP and l Tryptofan uh,

142
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.903
enhance her.

143
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.331
What it is,

144
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:34.810
is when you take five HTP at your brain produces more serotonin,

145
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.290
and when you take a l Tryptofan l trip,

146
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:40.270
defend converts in your body to five HTP,

147
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:41.530
which converts a Serotonin.

148
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:44.650
It's like a multistep process for the two different nutrients.

149
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.500
So it almost acts as like a time release,

150
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.363
sort of an effect.

151
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.790
Uh,

152
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.710
but if you're interested in five HTP,

153
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.910
a very important thing,

154
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.670
make sure you're not an SSRI.

155
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.190
Noah antidepressants,

156
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.421
no.

157
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:56.310
Is that the right way to say it?

158
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.163
SSL,

159
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.070
whenever there's certain certain Antique Cfi,

160
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.203
CSI Vegas,

161
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.790
there's certain antidepressants that uh,

162
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.141
what,

163
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:05.210
uh,

164
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.440
what they're exactly doing is the same thing that five HTP is doing.

165
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.910
They're elevating your serotonin.

166
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.320
So if you're taking that,

167
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.610
you might be taking too much.

168
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.990
If you take both of them the same time,

169
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.980
uh,

170
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.970
talk to doctor bitch,

171
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.133

ladies and gentlemen,

195
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.180
right when a Alienware keeps trying to get me to upgrade,

196
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.720
bitch,

197
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.970
I ain't upgrade and update your software.

198
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.300
Uh,

199
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.500
alien re spawn.

200
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.080
We should just wipe all of that.

201
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.740
Why it maybe maybe supposed to it when they're sort of helping us out.

202
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.030
Dude.

203
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.541
First of all,

204
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:14.710
thanks for doing the podcast man.

205
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.190
Appreciate it.

206
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.510
Appreciate it man.

207
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.111
This is cool.

208
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:18.250
I think the fans would dig it too.

209
00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:19.061
So yeah,

210
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:20.320
I'm wearing social media.

211
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.770
[inaudible] athletics since what 99 is that when you started this sampling

212
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.470
Goddamn businessman athlete?

213
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.550
Is that the focus now?

214
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.061
Now that you're,

215
00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:29.470
you're completely done fighting.

216
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.010
They're going to always be up on my clothing companies.

217
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.863
Always my focus,

218
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.381
my love.

219
00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:32.621
You know,

220
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:33.170
I,

221
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.730
I have love for something that I've never want to get rid of people who tried to

222
00:05:36.731 --> 00:05:39.130
come in and buy me out and I'd never wanted to sell out,

223
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:39.820
you know,

224
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.110
cause it represents something to you,

225
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.741
your baby,

226
00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:42.380
you made it,

227
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.611
you know,

228
00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:43.780
and it's punishment.

229
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:43.931
I mean,

230
00:05:43.931 --> 00:05:47.020
every person who goes through work deals with some type of punishment,

231
00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:47.240
you know,

232
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.200
either you wake up at five in the morning and you press the alarm clock going,

233
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.621
God,

234
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:51.790
what am I doing this for?

235
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.241
Like,

236
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:53.440
and realize you got to pay bills,

237
00:05:53.441 --> 00:05:54.520
you got to take care of your family.

238
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.780
It's a punishment.

239
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.070
And that's what all life and of life go through

240
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.903
<v 3>his punishment.</v>

241
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.320
That's what my brand represents.

242
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.921
You,

243
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:01.130
uh,

244
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.550
you told me something once we're talking about submissions and uh,

245
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.210
you said,

246
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.000
you know the problem with submitting a guy as you could submit the guy and after

247
00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:09.471
he taps,

248
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:10.304
he's okay.

249
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.050
And he's like,

250
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.781
Yo man,

251
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:12.740
he got lucky man.

252
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:13.574
He got lucky.

253
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.880
But when I get on top of you and punch you in the fucking head for 15 minutes,

254
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.910
I'm punished until the referee pulls me up.

255
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:20.870
That is punishment.

256
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:22.730
And I'll never forget that because that really,

257
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:23.300
uh,

258
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.601
that,

259
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:26.360
that one quote really embodied your career,

260
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.080
you know,

261
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.890
I mean,

262
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.380
you only submitted Yuki Kondo and Ryan Bader,

263
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:31.370
those the only two guys.

264
00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:31.611
Right.

265
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:32.031
That's it.

266
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:32.691
And then my man,

267
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:33.051
that's it.

268
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:33.830
That's all I've ever done.

269
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.270
I just want to put on a show,

270
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:35.451
man.

271
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:36.020
I,

272
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.261
you know,

273
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:37.130
I thought it was,

274
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:37.311
you know,

275
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:38.390
those guys are going on and he caught me

276
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.540
<v 1>lucky with the arm triangle or with the arm bar.</v>

277
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:42.021
I mean,

278
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:42.651
don't get me wrong.

279
00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:43.730
I would love to submit it.

280
00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:44.151
Machida,

281
00:06:44.151 --> 00:06:44.990
that would have been awesome.

282
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:48.590
But I always wanted to be dominating and be on top.

283
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.160
It just polarize a guy just to try to finish them and you know,

284
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.600
make them not want to find me again.

285
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.800
Do Yuki Kondo one was the all elusive one arm Ghia teen.

286
00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.950
She called a Cobra Choke Colbert show.

287
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.320
That's from cal State Bakersfield.

288
00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:02.210
I said a one arm,

289
00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:04.370
one arm was grabbing his chin where I do,

290
00:07:04.371 --> 00:07:07.850
unless I'm hooking the Chin and I tried to pin his chin across to his shoulder

291
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.830
and it's almost like a throat choke.

292
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:11.810
Cal State Bakersfield to cook.

293
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:15.410
Daryl pope showed us that chuck and we'd choke guys unconscious in wrestling

294
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:18.710
matches and the refugees don't know what's happening because in college you're

295
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:20.700
allowed to turn in the chin wherever you want it.

296
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.531
In high school rules,

297
00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:22.170
you're not allowed to church,

298
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.120
turn the Gen wherever you want.

299
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.900
But I learned that and I do it a lot of Jujitsu guys because they'd pull guard,

300
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:27.970
they watch the guy,

301
00:07:27.971 --> 00:07:29.030
my chin under my arm,

302
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:29.864
I'm fine.

303
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.270
But once you hook and kind of snuggle in,

304
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.421
guys don't go anywhere.

305
00:07:33.421 --> 00:07:36.170
And this is one of those old school catch wrestling moves.

306
00:07:36.171 --> 00:07:36.770
Exactly.

307
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:37.370
Exactly.

308
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.760
There's a,

309
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.760
is that the same one that Jake Shield used our Nick Thompson in strike force and

310
00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:46.970
hit him with some sort of a one arm one and he posted out with his left arm and

311
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:47.960
then he arches back.

312
00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:48.771
It was pretty gnarly.

313
00:07:48.771 --> 00:07:49.011
Yeah.

314
00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:50.630
It's a little different cause that's for this one.

315
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:52.490
You got to hook literally outside hit.

316
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.240
You didn't hook the outside hip to make it happen and you hook the hip and we do

317
00:07:56.241 --> 00:08:00.320
as you're compressing the lungs and a compression to the chin and the neck of

318
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:00.861
the same time,

319
00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:03.320
so it's like a compressive choke,

320
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.100
is it?

321
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:09.100
The hardest thing is to me seems as an observer watching it seemed it's hard for

322
00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:14.801
dudes to put new aspects to the game once they become successful.

323
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.730
That seems to be the most hard,

324
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.320
but I think that the hardest thing is,

325
00:08:18.321 --> 00:08:21.770
is doing it in repetition because everything you got to do in repetition to get

326
00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:22.521
better and better,

327
00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:24.890
you have to do it in repetition over and over again.

328
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:25.371
Guys think,

329
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:25.700
well,

330
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:25.881
okay,

331
00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:26.714
I know that move.

332
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.680
I don't need to do that anymore.

333
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:27.990
No,

334
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.823
you,

335
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.360
you'll lose it during going live and wrestling.

336
00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:35.630
That I learned was I would do it so much I was reaction.

337
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.850
It wasn't a factor of just doing it to do it.

338
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.440
You did it as reaction and so when I would go for a high crotch guy would defend

339
00:08:42.441 --> 00:08:42.690
that.

340
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.060
They got to go to a single guide defending that.

341
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:44.811
I go to a double guy,

342
00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:48.080
defend that I'd go back to a high crotch and he's not even thinking chaining

343
00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:50.520
them together because that's how you've drilled it and chain wrestling.

344
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:50.960
Exactly.

345
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.640
That's what it came into fighting the same thing,

346
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.560
but you kind of get caught up and to the of going to,

347
00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.140
well I'm going to do submission defenses.

348
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:58.023
That was my first thing.

349
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.910
I didn't want to learn submissions because I wanted all the defenses first and

350
00:09:01.911 --> 00:09:03.480
then I learned all the defenses and I was like,

351
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:03.691
okay,

352
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:04.830
I'm not going to get cotton anymore.

353
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.540
Then I started learning offenses.

354
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.930
Then after certain learn offenses,

355
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:08.501
okay great,

356
00:09:08.501 --> 00:09:09.870
and now I got this position is good.

357
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.060
Then I started learning more standup and then it was just,

358
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.260
it was Kinda like a,

359
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.280
I didn't want to over step my boundaries by doing too much at once,

360
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:18.870
so I just kind of putting a little,

361
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.730
I guess little schedules.

362
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.050
It was like,

363
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:21.361
all right,

364
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:22.560
this week I'll work on this,

365
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.640
next week I'll work on this.

366
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.590
And then I had to go back to the first week,

367
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.581
a couple of months later.

368
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:27.390
So it's like,

369
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:27.600
yeah,

370
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.700
it's hard to absorb something new.

371
00:09:29.701 --> 00:09:30.151
Also,

372
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:32.340
especially if you're trying to do like two different things new.

373
00:09:32.341 --> 00:09:33.300
Because when you,

374
00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:34.590
when you absorb something new,

375
00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:37.180
it becomes like an obsession where like thinking about it,

376
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.240
you'll go back grounds.

377
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.190
Well you'll go for that move over and over and over and over and over and over

378
00:09:41.191 --> 00:09:41.491
again.

379
00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:42.060
I mean,

380
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.360
when I was in high school and then I was known for a head and arm and a low

381
00:09:45.361 --> 00:09:45.840
single,

382
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.380
I mean that was,

383
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:46.890
people go,

384
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:47.491
you tie up with them,

385
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:47.971
he's gonna hit an arm,

386
00:09:47.971 --> 00:09:48.730
throw you,

387
00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:49.860
you stand away from me.

388
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:50.670
He's listening to you.

389
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.380
And I was known for that.

390
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:54.310
But then when I got it to be a junior,

391
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.770
junior and senior in high school,

392
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.230
part Herrera was my coach who fought in the UFC.

393
00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.101
He goes,

394
00:09:59.101 --> 00:09:59.371
Tito,

395
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:00.210
you're going to live by that.

396
00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:01.140
You're going to die by that.

397
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:01.681
Let's learn.

398
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:03.870
High crotch lists are in double like lister and snap down.

399
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:06.810
And I started learning these different things and collegiate wrestling that I

400
00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:07.230
was like,

401
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:07.471
oh,

402
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:09.120
I'm starting to learn all this different stuff.

403
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.950
So I wasn't just stuck to one thing.

404
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:11.161
Yeah,

405
00:10:11.161 --> 00:10:13.440
it's funny when you see a guy like Cody McKenzie,

406
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:13.921
you know,

407
00:10:13.921 --> 00:10:18.270
has got this fucking ridiculous guillotine that nobody can run away from.

408
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:18.811
But it's,

409
00:10:18.811 --> 00:10:21.300
it's so weird to have one move like that.

410
00:10:21.301 --> 00:10:22.720
But someone will learn the defense too.

411
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:23.431
I mean,

412
00:10:23.431 --> 00:10:24.010
you look at,

413
00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:24.450
uh,

414
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:25.051
who was it?

415
00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:25.884
Um,

416
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.260
GAF from strike.

417
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.250
I start versus from pride.

418
00:10:29.251 --> 00:10:30.120
Who came over here?

419
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.540
The heavyweight Nogueira now the,

420
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.393
now the [inaudible],

421
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:37.190
the big guy who just got burnt out on all the vitamin him got out.

422
00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:37.670
I can't think of,

423
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.300
he got burnt for steroids.

424
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.590
Carlin,

425
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:40.771
Bob.

426
00:10:40.771 --> 00:10:41.100
No.

427
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.330
Carwyn was never a proud guy.

428
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:42.721
No,

429
00:10:42.721 --> 00:10:45.000
I over him over him.

430
00:10:45.001 --> 00:10:47.010
He had a sick amount of guillotines.

431
00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:49.250
He caught Belfort with them over and over and over.

432
00:10:49.251 --> 00:10:50.460
Then all of a sudden he got away from it.

433
00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:55.470
It's not pretty much got away from the ground game period when he became a k one

434
00:10:55.471 --> 00:10:56.310
grand Prix champion.

435
00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.173
And just to,

436
00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.170
to clarify,

437
00:10:58.171 --> 00:11:01.110
you didn't get really get popped for steroids to get popped for elevated

438
00:11:01.111 --> 00:11:03.900
elevated testosterone to epitestosterone ratio.

439
00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.990
It's from testosterone.

440
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.330
I mean he admitted they shot him with testosterone.

441
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:10.733
Um,

442
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.340
yeah,

443
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.570
he was a really trying to concentrate entirely on the kickboxing for awhile.

444
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:16.530
You know,

445
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.030
when you see a guy that,

446
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.360
I mean he's one of the,

447
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:24.380
like the best examples ever of a guy whose career was in the shitter and then

448
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:29.700
pull out of it and all of a sudden he's on top of the world and amazing did it.

449
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:30.401
He's good.

450
00:11:30.401 --> 00:11:30.861
He's great.

451
00:11:30.861 --> 00:11:31.800
And I mean Anderson Silva,

452
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:32.551
Anderson Silva,

453
00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:35.820
when he was in pride and he was losing and getting submitted and all of a sudden

454
00:11:35.821 --> 00:11:40.821
he came in to Casi submitted them and they came over to UFC and just hasn't been

455
00:11:42.091 --> 00:11:43.290
beaten since I don't think.

456
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:43.531
Yeah.

457
00:11:43.531 --> 00:11:45.030
It's interesting when you see guys,

458
00:11:45.031 --> 00:11:49.140
when you catch guys like in between camps and you know there's a split when it

459
00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:49.530
can't you.

460
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:53.200
That's when you really realize like how important it is to have the whole

461
00:11:53.201 --> 00:11:54.970
fucking package together.

462
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.910
To have a coach that you will listen to,

463
00:11:57.911 --> 00:12:00.970
to have trainers who were looking out for you to have a guy who's actually

464
00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:02.740
analyzing your training and say,

465
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:03.221
you know,

466
00:12:03.221 --> 00:12:03.670
he's,

467
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.200
he looks like he's peeking a little early.

468
00:12:05.201 --> 00:12:06.220
We've got to take them back little,

469
00:12:06.221 --> 00:12:09.670
let's check his heart rate guys who are really looking at you like a race horse.

470
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.320
And when a guy doesn't have that,

471
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:15.160
like Anderson Silva went for a stretch in pride where he'd left,

472
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:16.480
who'd Jamar and,

473
00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.380
uh,

474
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:21.160
formed Moitai Dream Team and he sewed on his own for a little bit too.

475
00:12:21.161 --> 00:12:22.580
And it was losing man.

476
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.740
It wasn't the same dude,

477
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.850
just wasn't the same guy.

478
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:25.781
And then he's trying to sell it.

479
00:12:25.781 --> 00:12:26.920
The great people in any look at.

480
00:12:26.921 --> 00:12:27.731
He does an awesome job.

481
00:12:27.731 --> 00:12:28.091
But I mean,

482
00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:29.560
it goes back to the fight or also on that aid.

483
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.150
I mean we go through a lot mentally.

484
00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:34.210
It just battles that we go through in our own heads.

485
00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:35.770
And you got to have that confidence,

486
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:35.981
man.

487
00:12:35.981 --> 00:12:37.420
That confidence is what changes everything.

488
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.171
What was it?

489
00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:39.800
What does it like when you know,

490
00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:40.840
you go from,

491
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.890
I mean I was there,

492
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:45.280
I was very fortunate to be there for your very first fight in 1997.

493
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:45.990
Was it west?

494
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.580
All Britain nameless,

495
00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.870
all Britain came Alabama.

496
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:50.111
Yeah.

497
00:12:50.111 --> 00:12:52.420
You came in as a replacement,

498
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:52.751
right?

499
00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:53.051
Yeah,

500
00:12:53.051 --> 00:12:53.960
I'm actually um,

501
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.160
I watched Jerry bull and her fight and we wrestled in high school.

502
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.130
He went to Livermore high and with tiny Tim and we're at the state meet and I

503
00:13:00.131 --> 00:13:00.964
beat him.

504
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.900
And then I watched him when the lightweight at the time was lightweight under

505
00:13:04.901 --> 00:13:05.670
one 99.

506
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.781
Well,

507
00:13:05.781 --> 00:13:07.810
the lightweight tournament and uh,

508
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:08.750
I was like,

509
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:09.750
they can't look familiar.

510
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:10.691
I remember it.

511
00:13:10.691 --> 00:13:11.200
I was like,

512
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:11.891
I called tank.

513
00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:13.180
At that time I was training with tank.

514
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.961
Dude,

515
00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:14.890
I want to fight in the UFC.

516
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.290
I can crush these guys to see both lender,

517
00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:18.960
just smitten guys and just have,

518
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.980
they're just pretty much hand in their ass to him.

519
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:22.120
And uh,

520
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.950
I think it was you could do this.

521
00:13:23.951 --> 00:13:24.784
So yeah,

522
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:25.731
it's all right.

523
00:13:25.731 --> 00:13:27.100
I will see about getting you fun.

524
00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.830
I get a call like two weeks later and says UFC 13.

525
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.910
How much training did you have MMA training before that fight?

526
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:34.060
Um,

527
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.950
probably about two months.

528
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.500
And what did you do during that time?

529
00:13:37.501 --> 00:13:37.931
I wrestled,

530
00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:38.560
I wrestled,

531
00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.440
I wrestled and I,

532
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:39.610
man,

533
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:40.271
we had a street fight.

534
00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:40.361
I'm,

535
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:42.010
I grew up in the 80s punk rock era.

536
00:13:42.011 --> 00:13:45.910
We used to slam dance and there was no guns and people don't have guns.

537
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.130
Romance fought.

538
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.540
We fought and I got in fist fights,

539
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.850
got my ass beat a bunch of times.

540
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:54.190
My brother Marty and Jim and Mike and their brothers or their friends.

541
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.360
Um,

542
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.760
but I just came from a wrestling background.

543
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:58.600
I knew how to street fight.

544
00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:58.781
I mean,

545
00:13:58.781 --> 00:13:59.491
they're not fighting us.

546
00:13:59.491 --> 00:14:00.480
So that's how you looked at it.

547
00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:01.160
He looked at it and look,

548
00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:01.930
I got,

549
00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:02.691
I got my wrestling,

550
00:14:02.691 --> 00:14:03.650
I'm gonna take this guy down.

551
00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:04.693
Beat his head.

552
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:05.710
I knew,

553
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:06.540
I knew at the time,

554
00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:07.900
I mean I was a state champ.

555
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.380
I was very confident and I knew that guys couldn't stop my double.

556
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.470
These guys weren't college wrestlers and I know I would dominate.

557
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.570
What is it like to,

558
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.770
there's this gotta be completely different mindsets from the first time you step

559
00:14:20.771 --> 00:14:25.771
into the octagon to as your career's progressing to becoming a champion.

560
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.981
You know,

561
00:14:26.981 --> 00:14:27.191
this,

562
00:14:27.191 --> 00:14:27.390
uh,

563
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:31.510
this gotta be a lot of differences in the way you approach things.

564
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:32.680
It was,

565
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.071
I don't know,

566
00:14:33.071 --> 00:14:35.410
I just really didn't think too much about it.

567
00:14:35.411 --> 00:14:35.700
You know,

568
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.770
I don't want to get lost in the beginning.

569
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:38.740
Wasn't like all of a sudden,

570
00:14:38.741 --> 00:14:39.520
this is what I'm doing.

571
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:39.911
All of a sudden,

572
00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:40.151
boom.

573
00:14:40.151 --> 00:14:40.541
I was like,

574
00:14:40.541 --> 00:14:42.250
I'm trying to sound and all of a sudden was like,

575
00:14:42.251 --> 00:14:42.561
wow,

576
00:14:42.561 --> 00:14:43.600
it's more stepping in the cage.

577
00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:43.820
We went,

578
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:44.401
Holy Shit.

579
00:14:44.401 --> 00:14:46.480
Well what am I doing?

580
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:48.041
What's going on?

581
00:14:48.041 --> 00:14:48.690
And people listen to me.

582
00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.040
I'm going to drink your Tito Ortiz.

583
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:50.560
No,

584
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:50.831
no.

585
00:14:50.831 --> 00:14:51.980
I was an average guides me.

586
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.760
<v 4>It was like,</v>

587
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.001
okay,

588
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:53.834
don't make a mistake.

589
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.921
Keep your hands up.

590
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:57.030
Because at the time we buddies in average guy,

591
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.940
that's the secret.

592
00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:58.843
At the end of the day,

593
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:00.370
everywhere person,

594
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:01.490
everybody's just a person.

595
00:15:01.491 --> 00:15:01.621
I mean,

596
00:15:01.621 --> 00:15:02.391
I'm just a person.

597
00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:03.171
I just work really,

598
00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:04.004
really hard.

599
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.750
You know Paul Herrera who fought in UFC,

600
00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:07.760
it was a David versus Goliath.

601
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.280
He was my high school wrestling coach and a,

602
00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:12.500
I was training with them at the time and I remember him saying,

603
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.150
and this was the sign of cockiness,

604
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:14.510
he's like,

605
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:14.931
Oh,

606
00:15:14.931 --> 00:15:17.390
what is Gary Good was going to do arm wrestling to the ground?

607
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:17.930
Oof.

608
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:18.763
And then I was like,

609
00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.300
I wouldn't think of it that way.

610
00:15:20.301 --> 00:15:21.920
I would look and see what he really does.

611
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:23.090
And I started watching,

612
00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:24.360
seeing some of the other cop,

613
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.060
Quito or some of their fight,

614
00:15:26.061 --> 00:15:26.571
and he did.

615
00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:29.510
And that was one of the scariest Kaos ever that was,

616
00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:30.291
I was there and it,

617
00:15:30.291 --> 00:15:31.270
and it shook my heart.

618
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:31.940
I was like Blam.

619
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.740
He got blasted and I was just like,

620
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:34.850
Holy Shit.

621
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.601
I remember at the time,

622
00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:36.260
my girlfriend,

623
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:36.740
Kristen,

624
00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:37.550
she was like,

625
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:38.350
I don't want you to happen.

626
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:39.680
What happened to Paul happened to you?

627
00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:40.700
I'm all,

628
00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:41.810
I'm going to train hard and I can,

629
00:15:41.811 --> 00:15:43.190
I can let be too confident.

630
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:43.911
I'm just gonna go in.

631
00:15:43.911 --> 00:15:44.860
I'm going to know him to fight.

632
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.310
I'm gonna fight as hard as they possibly can.

633
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:46.731
And I did.

634
00:15:46.731 --> 00:15:47.750
I worked my butt off.

635
00:15:47.751 --> 00:15:47.961
You know,

636
00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:49.100
I'd run four miles a day,

637
00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:49.970
six days a week.

638
00:15:49.971 --> 00:15:52.550
I would wrestled three hours a day with Jujitsu,

639
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.780
two hours a day.

640
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.000
I,

641
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.140
I'll do my boxing.

642
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.080
I didn't do kickboxing the time I just did boxing.

643
00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.190
Um,

644
00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.930
I didn't spar that much cause I mean,

645
00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:01.670
at the time I didn't,

646
00:16:01.671 --> 00:16:03.560
I didn't really understand what spartan was about.

647
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:04.131
You know,

648
00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:04.261
we,

649
00:16:04.261 --> 00:16:05.420
we did a lot of wrestling.

650
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.610
We did a lot of crown groundfighting stuff.

651
00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:07.821
We did.

652
00:16:07.821 --> 00:16:08.960
Studies didn't do much.

653
00:16:08.961 --> 00:16:09.751
Stand up,

654
00:16:09.751 --> 00:16:10.121
fight it.

655
00:16:10.121 --> 00:16:10.330
Yeah.

656
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:11.240
Not really.

657
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:11.900
Not really.

658
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:12.380
I mean,

659
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.560
I tank was the guy who I'd have to spar with and I didn't want to get punched in

660
00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:16.394
the face by hand.

661
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.990
Everybody saw what he did.

662
00:16:17.991 --> 00:16:18.824
The guys,

663
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.300
I never got a chance to spar with him.

664
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:20.750
Um,

665
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.890
but I'd Russell from all the time,

666
00:16:21.891 --> 00:16:23.450
we'd just submission wrestling all the time.

667
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:24.740
I was a lot faster.

668
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:25.550
Um,

669
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.470
but it's just one of those things as it progressed,

670
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.090
when I first started to,

671
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:31.370
like when I went to cal state Bakersfield,

672
00:16:31.371 --> 00:16:32.450
after I fought my first time,

673
00:16:32.451 --> 00:16:33.290
I took a year off,

674
00:16:33.291 --> 00:16:35.240
I went to cal state Bakersfield to try to finish up to get my,

675
00:16:35.241 --> 00:16:35.690
you know,

676
00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.670
my teaching degree and uh,

677
00:16:37.671 --> 00:16:40.420
I get my major in physical education and my minor,

678
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.250
especially in the case in teaching and the me and the coach and CSI.

679
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:43.761
And I was like,

680
00:16:43.761 --> 00:16:43.981
wow.

681
00:16:43.981 --> 00:16:46.160
Then this is something that I don't want to do.

682
00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.030
Um,

683
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.040
I got an opportunity to go back and fight for the UFC.

684
00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:49.874
And I was like,

685
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:50.743
all right,

686
00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.770
I'm going to kill this coach and gold at cal State Bakersfield or I'm going to

687
00:16:54.771 --> 00:16:55.041
leave.

688
00:16:55.041 --> 00:16:56.210
So I packed my stuff up,

689
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.570
dropped my stuff off at his school and said,

690
00:16:58.571 --> 00:16:59.030
you know what?

691
00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.060
You're a piece of shit and I'm gonna share.

692
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:02.060
Anybody respects you.

693
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.430
I'm either gonna kick your ass or I'm out of here.

694
00:17:04.431 --> 00:17:05.690
So I packed my stuff and new hall,

695
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:08.960
we get back down to Huntington and got a job at Spanky's adult bookstore.

696
00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:11.510
And one of your first sponsors?

697
00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:11.721
Yeah,

698
00:17:11.721 --> 00:17:15.680
one of my first Spanky's Spanky's triple x and my first sponsor,

699
00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.120
adult novelty store.

700
00:17:17.121 --> 00:17:17.954
I worked there,

701
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.010
I sold merchandise.

702
00:17:19.011 --> 00:17:20.780
I was probably the highest selling guys are.

703
00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.130
I was a great salesman.

704
00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.240
There's some interesting stories I would happen there,

705
00:17:26.241 --> 00:17:27.074
but uh,

706
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.831
yeah,

707
00:17:27.831 --> 00:17:28.664
but no beyond that,

708
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:29.290
uh,

709
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:29.510
you know,

710
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:30.500
I started training,

711
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:31.640
I got my first fight back,

712
00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.140
so it was like an opportunity in the middle of a play.

713
00:17:34.141 --> 00:17:34.311
It was,

714
00:17:34.311 --> 00:17:35.600
it was the best door for you?

715
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:36.533
There was,

716
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:37.071
it was,

717
00:17:37.071 --> 00:17:37.461
it was,

718
00:17:37.461 --> 00:17:38.010
uh,

719
00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:38.350
he,

720
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.320
he actually,

721
00:17:39.321 --> 00:17:41.930
the owner from the company knew that I fought and he goes,

722
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.280
there's a UFC in Brazil.

723
00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.200
And I told him I wanted to go.

724
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.590
He said,

725
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.800
how about I pay for your air ticket and your hotel to go out there?

726
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.070
Me and one of my other friends,

727
00:17:50.071 --> 00:17:53.460
we went out there and I made my first little fighter cards and it had my phone

728
00:17:53.461 --> 00:17:54.170
number on it,

729
00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:55.170
had my email address on it.

730
00:17:55.171 --> 00:17:58.410
It had a picture of me with my back to the picture and said,

731
00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:01.160
Tito Ortiz on a number walking up the John Preti and go on.

732
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:02.543
I want to fight.

733
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.790
I'll kick any of these guys as I kicked that frank share marks.

734
00:18:04.791 --> 00:18:05.311
Guy's ass.

735
00:18:05.311 --> 00:18:06.091
I'll kick his ass.

736
00:18:06.091 --> 00:18:06.960
I'll kick his ass.

737
00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:07.520
I go,

738
00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.201
I want to fight.

739
00:18:08.201 --> 00:18:08.821
And he looked at her like,

740
00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:09.780
who the hell are you?

741
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:10.351
I go,

742
00:18:10.351 --> 00:18:11.190
I'm Tito Ortiz.

743
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.060
I go watch UFC 13 I got almost be Guy Metzker in the finals.

744
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:15.871
I got beat up,

745
00:18:15.871 --> 00:18:16.740
got west,

746
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.330
all Britain at the time I was a young kid.

747
00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:18.961
I was cocky.

748
00:18:18.961 --> 00:18:19.794
And how old were you?

749
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.450
I was a 22 I just know 20 I just turned 20 yeah,

750
00:18:23.451 --> 00:18:28.451
I just turned 22 I was a young kid and I mean at the time I was hungry,

751
00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:29.760
man.

752
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.100
I was,

753
00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.470
I had nothing to judge a man.

754
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.730
What the fuck comes out of his mouth?

755
00:18:32.731 --> 00:18:34.650
And He's 22 I believe me.

756
00:18:34.651 --> 00:18:34.941
I,

757
00:18:34.941 --> 00:18:36.780
at that time I didn't care.

758
00:18:36.781 --> 00:18:37.141
I didn't,

759
00:18:37.141 --> 00:18:39.410
I mean I always thought was the toughest guy in the world.

760
00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.610
You did not have a good childhood?

761
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.410
No,

762
00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:43.740
I came from nothing.

763
00:18:43.741 --> 00:18:44.574
I mean,

764
00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.910
I think God has put me in the right way,

765
00:18:47.911 --> 00:18:48.601
is a lot of things,

766
00:18:48.601 --> 00:18:49.200
you know,

767
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:49.590
but I'm,

768
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:50.161
don't get me wrong,

769
00:18:50.161 --> 00:18:51.480
I don't go to church all the time.

770
00:18:51.481 --> 00:18:51.661
You know,

771
00:18:51.661 --> 00:18:53.160
I just believe in being a good person.

772
00:18:53.161 --> 00:18:53.401
You know,

773
00:18:53.401 --> 00:18:54.960
you treat people how you're going to be treated.

774
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:55.860
Uh,

775
00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.161
you know,

776
00:18:56.161 --> 00:18:57.990
I never tried to step on the way to get ahead.

777
00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.340
That seems to be self evident.

778
00:18:59.341 --> 00:18:59.521
Right?

779
00:18:59.521 --> 00:18:59.790
I mean,

780
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.470
pretty much everybody who has a brain knows,

781
00:19:01.471 --> 00:19:03.650
treat people well and good things happen to you.

782
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:04.981
There's a,

783
00:19:04.981 --> 00:19:06.210
an ethic to the world,

784
00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:06.480
right?

785
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.040
Yeah.

786
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:07.771
When I was a kid,

787
00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:07.921
you know,

788
00:19:07.921 --> 00:19:08.900
I mean I had a problem I used,

789
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.270
I used to steal a lot when I was a kid cause I never had anything.

790
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.300
My parents were drug addicts.

791
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:12.481
You know,

792
00:19:12.481 --> 00:19:13.890
we lived down in motels,

793
00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:14.730
we lived in cars,

794
00:19:14.731 --> 00:19:17.760
live in people's garages and everybody else always had something.

795
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:18.660
And I never had anything.

796
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.950
My parents could never buy him anything.

797
00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:20.650
So,

798
00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:22.320
and I would still have to put clothes on my back.

799
00:19:22.321 --> 00:19:23.730
I'd still put food in my mouth.

800
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:24.510
Um,

801
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:25.020
you know,

802
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.060
so that was always your reality growing up.

803
00:19:27.061 --> 00:19:30.680
Your parents were drug addicts your entire time to up.

804
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.240
It was about six years old to about 13.

805
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:34.530
Um,

806
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:35.160
it was,

807
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:35.581
it was,

808
00:19:35.581 --> 00:19:35.821
it was.

809
00:19:35.821 --> 00:19:37.080
So that was just a reality.

810
00:19:37.081 --> 00:19:37.914
That's all you were at.

811
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.090
I go to therapy right now.

812
00:19:39.091 --> 00:19:42.240
It's like I talked to my therapist and psych and I realize the things that I do

813
00:19:42.241 --> 00:19:42.870
and why do them,

814
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:43.201
it's like,

815
00:19:43.201 --> 00:19:44.034
okay,

816
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.450
this is the reason why I do that.

817
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.060
This is right.

818
00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:46.893
The reason why I do that,

819
00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:50.970
it's a learning process and I think each person has us individuals,

820
00:19:50.971 --> 00:19:55.740
we got to understand ourselves and how we're brought up is usually is how we

821
00:19:55.741 --> 00:19:56.520
become.

822
00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.340
But you still have that opportunity to make those decisions.

823
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:00.211
Yeah,

824
00:20:00.211 --> 00:20:02.280
you have the opportunity to change your behavior,

825
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.260
but you have to look at it and it's hard to do.

826
00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:04.861
It's hard to,

827
00:20:04.861 --> 00:20:05.820
it's hard to look at your say.

828
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:08.700
It's challenging to look in the mirror and to question yourself,

829
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:09.331
don't,

830
00:20:09.331 --> 00:20:10.620
I mean people could say,

831
00:20:10.621 --> 00:20:10.771
oh,

832
00:20:10.771 --> 00:20:12.090
that guy's talking shit about me.

833
00:20:12.091 --> 00:20:12.480
No,

834
00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.630
maybe that person is speaking the truth about you and you're just too in denial

835
00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:16.710
to really realize it.

836
00:20:16.711 --> 00:20:18.060
And I'm still learning it.

837
00:20:18.061 --> 00:20:18.541
I'm human.

838
00:20:18.541 --> 00:20:19.374
I'm still learning.

839
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.420
And I look at those things as a,

840
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:22.831
it's a challenge.

841
00:20:22.831 --> 00:20:23.820
It's a challenge from God.

842
00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:24.240
You know,

843
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.080
I could be a quitter.

844
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:28.650
I could be a complete drug addict right now and be strung out on heroin.

845
00:20:28.651 --> 00:20:28.771
I was,

846
00:20:28.771 --> 00:20:29.580
my parents were,

847
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.480
or it could be in prison right now and doing a life term for killing somebody

848
00:20:33.481 --> 00:20:34.130
for something.

849
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:34.963
Um,

850
00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:35.940
or I could be dead.

851
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.370
I could have been shot as one of my friends were when I lived,

852
00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:39.204
grew up in Santa Ana.

853
00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.020
Um,

854
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:45.020
but I was able to make a choice of my future and I think through my UFC career,

855
00:20:45.301 --> 00:20:47.980
people had to kind of a bad image of me because of the bad boy image.

856
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.180
But I was just trying to sell.

857
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.370
I was just trying to do what Ali did.

858
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:52.031
Um,

859
00:20:52.031 --> 00:20:52.301
you know,

860
00:20:52.301 --> 00:20:56.290
I was trying to do what some of the bad guys were that got the most attention.

861
00:20:56.291 --> 00:20:56.800
You know,

862
00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.570
at Tyson's heyday he had said some of the most negative things ever and people

863
00:21:01.571 --> 00:21:03.130
loved him and that's why he was selling,

864
00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:03.610
you know,

865
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.440
1.5 million pay per views.

866
00:21:05.441 --> 00:21:06.274
I mean,

867
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:07.181
I've done that.

868
00:21:07.181 --> 00:21:07.431
I've,

869
00:21:07.431 --> 00:21:08.530
I've done that for the USC.

870
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.070
<v 0>There is a part of it that is show business and people kind of have to</v>

871
00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:13.630
understand it's like rappers.

872
00:21:13.631 --> 00:21:15.490
Do you think they're really going out shooting people?

873
00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.480
Some are from Atlanta and you never know.

874
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:20.420
Some of them,

875
00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.150
some of them get a little caught up in the game.

876
00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:22.550
Yeah.

877
00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:23.383
<v 4>But you know,</v>

878
00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.670
you got to find that happy medium.

879
00:21:25.671 --> 00:21:26.504
You know,

880
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:31.750
where you realize that it's about yourself to make the decisions.

881
00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.260
It's not about others.

882
00:21:33.261 --> 00:21:34.400
Who made you make those decisions?

883
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:37.170
<v 0>How did you get out of the,</v>

884
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:37.760
the,

885
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.550
the place where you were when you were growing up with drug addict parents?

886
00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:43.050
How did you get out of that?

887
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:47.030
What was your mindset like when you were separating from your parents,

888
00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.150
becoming your own person with that sort of a back room?

889
00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.031
My mom gave me,

890
00:21:50.031 --> 00:21:50.120
gave

891
00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.010
<v 4>me 800 bucks when I was 18.</v>

892
00:21:52.011 --> 00:21:52.700
I graduated,

893
00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:56.000
she goes time for me to BMN BNN and I wanted to move out too.

894
00:21:56.001 --> 00:21:56.511
But she was like,

895
00:21:56.511 --> 00:21:57.344
here,

896
00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.310
time for you to be a man.

897
00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:02.870
I moved on with my brother Marty and his wife and um,

898
00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:05.090
I was doing drugs.

899
00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:06.010
I mean I was doing,

900
00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.160
I mean crystal,

901
00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.210
we smoked weed,

902
00:22:08.211 --> 00:22:09.620
we drank on the weekends,

903
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:13.910
but I worked at allied moving service and I would work 16 hour days,

904
00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:14.540
um,

905
00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.373
drug down,

906
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:16.863
uh,

907
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.220
to kind of forgot about Roselyn a little bit.

908
00:22:19.221 --> 00:22:21.950
And it was about a year after high school.

909
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:22.310
Um,

910
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:24.590
I was at some club and I was party and one of my coaches,

911
00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.000
old coaches pulled up to me.

912
00:22:26.001 --> 00:22:26.250
He's like,

913
00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:27.470
t say,

914
00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:28.160
yeah,

915
00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:28.990
yeah,

916
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.691
you do not write,

917
00:22:29.691 --> 00:22:30.930
Ma'am much.

918
00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:31.490
I'm fine.

919
00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:32.121
I'm looking at myself.

920
00:22:32.121 --> 00:22:34.820
What do you mean I'm fine because you don't look so good,

921
00:22:34.821 --> 00:22:35.460
man.

922
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:35.670
No,

923
00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:36.231
I'm cool man.

924
00:22:36.231 --> 00:22:36.561
I'm good.

925
00:22:36.561 --> 00:22:37.394
I'm good.

926
00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:39.200
Cause even thought about coming back in wrestling,

927
00:22:39.201 --> 00:22:40.070
going back to school,

928
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:40.973
I was like,

929
00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:42.081
yeah,

930
00:22:42.081 --> 00:22:44.270
but I mean I live on my own.

931
00:22:44.271 --> 00:22:45.470
I'm just trying to make ends meet.

932
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.550
And he's like,

933
00:22:46.551 --> 00:22:46.761
you know,

934
00:22:46.761 --> 00:22:47.211
I tell you what,

935
00:22:47.211 --> 00:22:47.810
I'll do.

936
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:48.920
You come to my cut on my,

937
00:22:48.921 --> 00:22:49.754
uh,

938
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:53.810
my office and we'll see about getting your financial aid,

939
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.901
financial aid.

940
00:22:54.901 --> 00:22:55.370
And he goes,

941
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:55.911
you're Mexican.

942
00:22:55.911 --> 00:22:56.211
Ran to go.

943
00:22:56.211 --> 00:22:56.571
Yeah.

944
00:22:56.571 --> 00:22:57.260
He goes,

945
00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.070
we get your financial aid or pay for your schooling,

946
00:22:59.071 --> 00:22:59.904
pay for your bucks,

947
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.860
and possibly give you some type of stipend to pay for your house or apartment.

948
00:23:03.861 --> 00:23:04.131
And I go,

949
00:23:04.131 --> 00:23:04.964
really?

950
00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.820
So that's,

951
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:10.040
it was a Saturday night and I was partying was at Rhino Room in Huntington

952
00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:10.490
beach.

953
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:12.520
I was drinking when party that night.

954
00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:13.550
Sunday rolled around,

955
00:23:13.551 --> 00:23:15.410
I was up still doing drugs,

956
00:23:15.411 --> 00:23:18.040
doing crystal that nine,

957
00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:21.140
I looked in the mirror and I didn't recognize myself.

958
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:23.780
I was 182 pounds,

959
00:23:23.781 --> 00:23:24.770
183 pounds,

960
00:23:24.771 --> 00:23:26.930
six foot two sucked up.

961
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.610
I mean,

962
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:32.630
people see me when I'm making weight at two oh five and my size now it's the big

963
00:23:32.631 --> 00:23:33.430
difference.

964
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.770
But Wayne,

965
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.590
185 pounds pimples all over my face.

966
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:40.040
I look like a drug addict and it scared me.

967
00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.500
I looked at myself and I said,

968
00:23:42.501 --> 00:23:46.340
you're turning into your parents here and I have these with myself all the time

969
00:23:46.341 --> 00:23:48.410
just to to read reality check to check myself.

970
00:23:48.411 --> 00:23:50.660
And I woke up that Monday morning,

971
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.381
I called allied,

972
00:23:51.381 --> 00:23:52.940
we've been served and I said I can't come in today.

973
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:53.421
They're like,

974
00:23:53.421 --> 00:23:54.620
what do you mean you can't come in today?

975
00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.340
You mean you can't,

976
00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.320
you can't call on it cause they are not coming into that girl.

977
00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.050
I got to check it out the school thing or you don't come in today,

978
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.741
you're fired.

979
00:24:00.741 --> 00:24:00.921
I go,

980
00:24:00.921 --> 00:24:01.670
well I guess I quit.

981
00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:05.720
Then walked into that office and the coach had a big smile on his face.

982
00:24:05.721 --> 00:24:06.590
I'm a to Doherty.

983
00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.980
I was kind of a big smile on his face and he was like showed up.

984
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.470
I want to give this a try.

985
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:13.671
That's amazing.

986
00:24:13.671 --> 00:24:16.670
So this is just based on your wrestling ability that he saw from high school.

987
00:24:16.671 --> 00:24:17.031
He said,

988
00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:20.000
this kid's got some talent and let me give you an opportunity to get out of your

989
00:24:20.001 --> 00:24:20.690
situation.

990
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:21.830
You knew you were in a bad spot.

991
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:22.250
Yeah.

992
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:23.083
I mean,

993
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:24.860
I knew that I was in a bad spot too.

994
00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:25.551
I just wasn't,

995
00:24:25.551 --> 00:24:29.580
it's not one of the best things about competitive athletics that you know,

996
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:31.520
that you can't get an opportunity like that.

997
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.121
Well,

998
00:24:32.121 --> 00:24:32.451
you know,

999
00:24:32.451 --> 00:24:34.640
I don't think you can only just an athletics.

1000
00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:35.960
I think it's in general in life,

1001
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.780
there's always some of them give somebody an opportunity and I think people got

1002
00:24:38.781 --> 00:24:42.440
to take that advantage and take that as a situation of maybe it's God giving you

1003
00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:43.693
a chance.

1004
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:45.530
Maybe it's someone who's looking out for you.

1005
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:46.161
I mean,

1006
00:24:46.161 --> 00:24:47.300
I've done it through my whole career.

1007
00:24:47.301 --> 00:24:47.411
I've,

1008
00:24:47.411 --> 00:24:48.890
I've tried to help guys come up and,

1009
00:24:48.891 --> 00:24:49.670
uh,

1010
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:49.941
you know,

1011
00:24:49.941 --> 00:24:52.010
I look at it w it was a gift.

1012
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:53.690
It was a gift to me and it was a challenge.

1013
00:24:53.691 --> 00:24:54.461
It was a challenge from God.

1014
00:24:54.461 --> 00:24:55.294
I had the sand.

1015
00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:56.930
You want to become a real person.

1016
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:58.790
How hard is it to tick that crystal?

1017
00:24:59.150 --> 00:24:59.451
Um,

1018
00:24:59.451 --> 00:25:01.970
that was almost

1019
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:04.220
four months,

1020
00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:04.810
three months,

1021
00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:04.940
three,

1022
00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:05.850
four months to kick it.

1023
00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:06.280
Yeah.

1024
00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.113
I mean,

1025
00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:09.500
my situation was when I drank,

1026
00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:10.363
I would like to party.

1027
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:11.263
That was it.

1028
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.410
I wasn't like I was,

1029
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:13.790
I had to do it to get up and go.

1030
00:25:13.791 --> 00:25:14.624
I had no,

1031
00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.480
I mean I hate the feeling the next day,

1032
00:25:17.481 --> 00:25:18.291
the burnout feeling.

1033
00:25:18.291 --> 00:25:18.891
I hated that,

1034
00:25:18.891 --> 00:25:19.724
that suck.

1035
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:21.020
But what really,

1036
00:25:21.021 --> 00:25:21.854
what it was,

1037
00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.690
I didn't feel normal anymore.

1038
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.950
I didn't feel that I was able to cope on a normal feeling.

1039
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:29.720
So he just wanted an escape.

1040
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.610
I wanted to escape.

1041
00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:31.000
I,

1042
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:31.850
it was from,

1043
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:34.190
it's funny because I talked to my therapist,

1044
00:25:34.191 --> 00:25:34.421
it's,

1045
00:25:34.421 --> 00:25:38.990
it's wanting to get away from that child of always wanting the attention that my

1046
00:25:38.991 --> 00:25:39.830
parents never gave me.

1047
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:40.873
And that was,

1048
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.590
it was weird cause I was the only way to push that stuff away.

1049
00:25:44.591 --> 00:25:45.400
Right then think about anymore.

1050
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.310
It was doing drugs.

1051
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:47.690
It helped me,

1052
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:48.523
helped me deal with it.

1053
00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:49.161
I dealt with it.

1054
00:25:49.161 --> 00:25:49.994
I dealt with through well.

1055
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:50.893
And uh,

1056
00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:52.820
all of a sudden when the drugs weren't around,

1057
00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.310
then I had something else to deal with it.

1058
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.823
School,

1059
00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:57.200
school kept my mind off of it.

1060
00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.910
Wrestling kept my mind off it.

1061
00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.000
The security that I had from my coaches and front of the time,

1062
00:26:02.001 --> 00:26:02.930
my girlfriend Kristen,

1063
00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.360
who backed me,

1064
00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:06.853
I just,

1065
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.030
I felt great from it.

1066
00:26:08.031 --> 00:26:08.151
You know,

1067
00:26:08.151 --> 00:26:09.350
I felt great from wrestling.

1068
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:10.820
I felt grateful winning tournaments.

1069
00:26:10.821 --> 00:26:12.080
I felt grateful when an a match.

1070
00:26:12.081 --> 00:26:13.580
I felt great when I ran four miles,

1071
00:26:13.581 --> 00:26:14.391
when I lifted weights,

1072
00:26:14.391 --> 00:26:15.021
when I would drill,

1073
00:26:15.021 --> 00:26:15.530
when everybody,

1074
00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.640
when there was no one else in the room and I'd be drone by myself or I'd try

1075
00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.350
when other guys with me and I'd be drawing on itself.

1076
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.320
The coach should be looking at me going,

1077
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:22.210
all right,

1078
00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:23.990
a card training's done.

1079
00:26:23.991 --> 00:26:24.231
I'm like,

1080
00:26:24.231 --> 00:26:24.381
no,

1081
00:26:24.381 --> 00:26:24.441
no,

1082
00:26:24.441 --> 00:26:24.810
no.

1083
00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:25.760
I still got some work to do.

1084
00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.370
And I always want to prefer be better.

1085
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.780
I always want to do something better.

1086
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.460
And I think that's what it was.

1087
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.770
Just hard work and dedication and yeah,

1088
00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:33.981
I mean,

1089
00:26:33.981 --> 00:26:36.440
here's another story that I mean I look back and when I used to drugs,

1090
00:26:36.441 --> 00:26:37.370
I mean when I was growing up,

1091
00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:38.720
when I was with gangs and stuff,

1092
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:43.440
we used to sniff rubber cement and when you hallucinate and so forth.

1093
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:44.280
Um,

1094
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:48.120
<v 5>when I was growing up I would hallucinate that I was walking down the red carpet</v>

1095
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.400
and the set the age of 12 years old,

1096
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:51.953
1213,

1097
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.810
I would hallucinate that I'm on a red carpet and people are taking pictures

1098
00:26:54.811 --> 00:26:55.830
going Tito this way,

1099
00:26:55.831 --> 00:26:56.221
this way,

1100
00:26:56.221 --> 00:26:56.641
pictures,

1101
00:26:56.641 --> 00:26:57.001
pictures,

1102
00:26:57.001 --> 00:26:59.100
pictures at that age.

1103
00:26:59.130 --> 00:26:59.531
And I mean,

1104
00:26:59.531 --> 00:27:02.790
I'm assuming anything that I was going to be who I am today as a,

1105
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:03.810
well who you are today,

1106
00:27:03.811 --> 00:27:05.580
it's probably because of that very hunger.

1107
00:27:05.581 --> 00:27:08.430
I mean it's the exact opposite of what your life was.

1108
00:27:08.431 --> 00:27:09.960
You weren't treated as special at all.

1109
00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:11.670
So you want it to be Uber special.

1110
00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:12.504
You want it to me.

1111
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.261
But it was weird.

1112
00:27:13.261 --> 00:27:15.250
I look at it and it was like maybe it was that God,

1113
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:18.070
show me that this is what could happen.

1114
00:27:18.071 --> 00:27:18.960
It could be possible.

1115
00:27:18.961 --> 00:27:19.591
It'd be possible.

1116
00:27:19.591 --> 00:27:19.841
Well,

1117
00:27:19.841 --> 00:27:20.101
you know,

1118
00:27:20.101 --> 00:27:20.934
it could be,

1119
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:21.421
but I mean,

1120
00:27:21.421 --> 00:27:23.240
I think everybody's motivation when,

1121
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.220
when you're in a bad situation is to improve.

1122
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.200
And it's one of the weird paradoxes of life,

1123
00:27:28.201 --> 00:27:32.670
especially as a father because I want to do the best I can for my kids and

1124
00:27:32.671 --> 00:27:35.640
provide them with the most love and give them the most experiences.

1125
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.460
But everybody I know that's interesting.

1126
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:39.600
Had a fucked up life.

1127
00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.190
Right?

1128
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:42.240
We've got a weird,

1129
00:27:42.241 --> 00:27:42.450
I mean,

1130
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:43.410
look at everybody who's very,

1131
00:27:43.411 --> 00:27:44.220
very successful.

1132
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.420
They have had a fucked up life.

1133
00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.480
They don't want to be in that position and they don't want to put their family

1134
00:27:48.481 --> 00:27:49.314
in that position.

1135
00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.130
And I've worked so hard to make sure that doesn't happen for my surroundings

1136
00:27:53.131 --> 00:27:53.740
now.

1137
00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:54.450
Yeah.

1138
00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:55.980
I look at it and yes I have nice cars.

1139
00:27:55.981 --> 00:27:57.150
Yes I have nice house and yes,

1140
00:27:57.151 --> 00:27:59.220
or burner you financially comfortable.

1141
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:02.460
But my biggest thing is making sure my kids have nothing to worry about where

1142
00:28:02.461 --> 00:28:04.110
they don't have to steal this to eat.

1143
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:05.970
And I'm not convinced that you're,

1144
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:06.511
you know,

1145
00:28:06.511 --> 00:28:07.141
let you,

1146
00:28:07.141 --> 00:28:10.830
your tuition or my situation is bad for children as long as they get enough

1147
00:28:10.831 --> 00:28:11.341
attention.

1148
00:28:11.341 --> 00:28:12.121
You communicate with them?

1149
00:28:12.121 --> 00:28:14.640
I do think that they can see life for what it is,

1150
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.290
man.

1151
00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:16.410
You got to give him challenges.

1152
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:17.341
You have to give.

1153
00:28:17.341 --> 00:28:18.410
You have to give them challenges.

1154
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.480
You have to make sure that they're working hard for what they're getting.

1155
00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:23.820
If you just give them everything they want and they don't,

1156
00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:24.241
they say,

1157
00:28:24.241 --> 00:28:24.451
well,

1158
00:28:24.451 --> 00:28:26.070
my dad didn't get it from me or my dad's get it from me.

1159
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:27.600
So I know my son Jacob,

1160
00:28:27.601 --> 00:28:28.311
who's with him right now,

1161
00:28:28.311 --> 00:28:31.680
and actually he has all A's in school right now.

1162
00:28:31.681 --> 00:28:32.490
He's in private school,

1163
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:33.210
has all A's.

1164
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.820
He reads on a sixth grade level.

1165
00:28:35.821 --> 00:28:36.840
Now he's in the second grade.

1166
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:37.860
That's awesome.

1167
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.520
And our deal is,

1168
00:28:39.521 --> 00:28:40.050
is Jacob,

1169
00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:41.580
I'll buy you anything you want,

1170
00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:45.240
but you got to get all A's in school and you got to do four things for me.

1171
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.320
You gotta respect your mom.

1172
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.880
You got to respect your students.

1173
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.010
You've got to respect your teacher and you have to respect me.

1174
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.540
And it gets done.

1175
00:28:51.541 --> 00:28:51.721
Deal.

1176
00:28:51.721 --> 00:28:52.140
Dad,

1177
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:52.973
I promise you.

1178
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:56.580
And he's a great kid and he has a good head on his shoulders.

1179
00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:56.761
Well,

1180
00:28:56.761 --> 00:28:57.480
that's amazing.

1181
00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:57.960
You know,

1182
00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.501
you're,

1183
00:28:58.501 --> 00:29:00.420
you're really lucky and I'm very lucky.

1184
00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:00.930
Well,

1185
00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:01.860
it's not even that.

1186
00:29:01.861 --> 00:29:06.861
It's also just the attitude and the fact that he gets to see how hard work pays

1187
00:29:06.931 --> 00:29:07.260
off.

1188
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:07.531
You know?

1189
00:29:07.531 --> 00:29:09.330
I think that's so important to,

1190
00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:09.631
you know,

1191
00:29:09.631 --> 00:29:10.340
to see,

1192
00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:10.650
uh,

1193
00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:12.360
like he seen you struggle.

1194
00:29:12.361 --> 00:29:14.280
He's seen you up and down,

1195
00:29:14.281 --> 00:29:14.581
you know,

1196
00:29:14.581 --> 00:29:15.930
he's seen you win and lose.

1197
00:29:15.931 --> 00:29:19.090
It's been a part of the whole thing and seeing the actual pain in the,

1198
00:29:19.091 --> 00:29:19.320
the,

1199
00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.153
the actual,

1200
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.560
the effort that's involved in becoming excellent.

1201
00:29:22.561 --> 00:29:22.710
Yeah.

1202
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:23.101
Let me tell you,

1203
00:29:23.101 --> 00:29:24.600
when I fight Rashad last year,

1204
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.970
it was the worst call I've ever had with him ever.

1205
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.193
And I was like,

1206
00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:29.253
you're up to watch Friday.

1207
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:29.461
He goes,

1208
00:29:29.461 --> 00:29:29.581
no,

1209
00:29:29.581 --> 00:29:29.731
Dad,

1210
00:29:29.731 --> 00:29:30.550
I can't watch the fight.

1211
00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:30.960
I go,

1212
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.531
what do you mean?

1213
00:29:31.531 --> 00:29:32.364
He's all,

1214
00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.080
it hurts when you want to watch you lose.

1215
00:29:34.081 --> 00:29:34.440
And I was like,

1216
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:34.900
oh,

1217
00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:35.760
well maybe he started crying.

1218
00:29:35.761 --> 00:29:35.971
I was like,

1219
00:29:35.971 --> 00:29:36.301
what do you mean?

1220
00:29:36.301 --> 00:29:37.080
And he's like,

1221
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:37.530
I can't,

1222
00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:37.771
I can't,

1223
00:29:37.771 --> 00:29:38.700
I can't want you to lose like you,

1224
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.451
you get hurt.

1225
00:29:39.451 --> 00:29:40.171
And it scares me.

1226
00:29:40.171 --> 00:29:41.070
I just can't handle it,

1227
00:29:41.071 --> 00:29:41.890
can't handle the pressure.

1228
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:42.723
I was like,

1229
00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:43.540
okay,

1230
00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:44.770
now I'm starting to get them.

1231
00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:45.070
I was like,

1232
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.551
wow,

1233
00:29:45.551 --> 00:29:46.840
this is starting to getting right now.

1234
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.390
And then I even had realize,

1235
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:48.611
okay,

1236
00:29:48.611 --> 00:29:50.680
I mean I've got a couple more fights left than you ain't got to worry about it.

1237
00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.250
And when I told him my last fight,

1238
00:29:52.251 --> 00:29:53.084
it was uh,

1239
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:53.830
in um,

1240
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.060
July and he was like,

1241
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.433
thank God.

1242
00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.950
Now we could spend time together and that's how much time I'm away from when I'm

1243
00:29:59.951 --> 00:30:00.460
training.

1244
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.220
People understand that,

1245
00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.053
you know why I buy,

1246
00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.420
it's not like I get in the cage and I fight.

1247
00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:05.140
No,

1248
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:09.970
I put him in three months of work in big bath in big bear three times a year.

1249
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.410
That's nine months out of the year.

1250
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.520
That's a long time.

1251
00:30:12.521 --> 00:30:13.354
You're away from the family.

1252
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:13.931
And by the way,

1253
00:30:13.931 --> 00:30:16.650
if anybody wants to buy Tito Ortiz is big powerhouse.

1254
00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:17.573
That shit's for sale,

1255
00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:18.611
for sale.

1256
00:30:18.611 --> 00:30:19.261
I'm trying to sell it.

1257
00:30:19.261 --> 00:30:19.901
I'm trying to get rid of it.

1258
00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:20.980
He fucking Badass.

1259
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.480
I saw some photos of it online,

1260
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:23.333
pulled them up.

1261
00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.431
Five stars,

1262
00:30:24.431 --> 00:30:24.920
you can get it.

1263
00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.500
I tried to get that motherfucker sold.

1264
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:28.390
I bet there's some fans out there.

1265
00:30:28.391 --> 00:30:31.000
They probably don't even know if that's your training camp.

1266
00:30:31.001 --> 00:30:33.420
And he used to be Oscar de la Hoya is training to della.

1267
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:34.780
That'll be it for himself.

1268
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:35.001
You know,

1269
00:30:35.001 --> 00:30:38.560
it started with one home and then he made another home s right next to it.

1270
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.580
It's on an acre,

1271
00:30:39.581 --> 00:30:40.414
half the land.

1272
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:44.650
And he made it right next to him and it was five or 4,000 square feet,

1273
00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.790
4,500 square feet.

1274
00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.030
It got his own Jacuzzi in this room.

1275
00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:50.080
Everything set on the inside.

1276
00:30:50.081 --> 00:30:50.291
I mean,

1277
00:30:50.291 --> 00:30:51.070
it's kind of,

1278
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:52.060
it's arcade system.

1279
00:30:52.061 --> 00:30:52.441
I mean it's,

1280
00:30:52.441 --> 00:30:53.050
it's a,

1281
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:54.160
it's a mad house for sure.

1282
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:54.701
It's dope.

1283
00:30:54.701 --> 00:30:55.630
It's all wood too.

1284
00:30:55.631 --> 00:30:56.530
It's all logs.

1285
00:30:56.531 --> 00:30:57.400
It's made with law.

1286
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.581
It's,

1287
00:30:57.581 --> 00:30:57.851
it's,

1288
00:30:57.851 --> 00:30:58.330
it's,

1289
00:30:58.330 --> 00:30:58.871
it's Pam.

1290
00:30:58.871 --> 00:30:59.681
It's about as pimps.

1291
00:30:59.681 --> 00:30:59.951
You got an,

1292
00:30:59.951 --> 00:31:01.600
and I go there and it's rural,

1293
00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:01.821
eh?

1294
00:31:01.821 --> 00:31:02.654
Yeah.

1295
00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:03.850
It's like Lindsay pimp.

1296
00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:05.440
It's almost like better than my home.

1297
00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.820
My house at home.

1298
00:31:06.821 --> 00:31:07.421
I'm like Jesus.

1299
00:31:07.421 --> 00:31:08.111
But is that it?

1300
00:31:08.111 --> 00:31:08.501
Yeah,

1301
00:31:08.501 --> 00:31:08.801
that's it.

1302
00:31:08.801 --> 00:31:08.960
Yep.

1303
00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:09.761
Come on dude.

1304
00:31:09.761 --> 00:31:10.421
Look at that place.

1305
00:31:10.421 --> 00:31:12.310
That's fucking bad ass.

1306
00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:13.001
But you gotta understand.

1307
00:31:13.001 --> 00:31:14.050
When I first got to go to big bear,

1308
00:31:14.051 --> 00:31:19.051
one was 2001 I stayed in a two bedroom apartment with eight dudes.

1309
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:20.471
Dude,

1310
00:31:20.471 --> 00:31:20.801
this is,

1311
00:31:20.801 --> 00:31:21.760
so that's the room.

1312
00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:22.623
What happens?

1313
00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.620
What happens if your kid gets straight A's though and wants to buy this house?

1314
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:27.040
That's what he wants you to buy.

1315
00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.590
That one you can never know.

1316
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.433
I mean,

1317
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:32.950
but now our job is,

1318
00:31:32.951 --> 00:31:35.860
you know what I mean as a father is making sure that he gets through school,

1319
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.713
you know,

1320
00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.980
and he says he wants to be a fighter,

1321
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.850
but I tell him what's our deal and our deal is to make sure that he gets his

1322
00:31:42.851 --> 00:31:43.840
master's degree first,

1323
00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.090
but he gets his masters degree actually.

1324
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.351
And you,

1325
00:31:46.351 --> 00:31:49.960
he'll be buying this house for me all just getting in and paid for by them.

1326
00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.280
Go Google it folks.

1327
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:53.141
So,

1328
00:31:53.141 --> 00:31:53.680
um,

1329
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.690
what I was trying to get at when I was asking you about the psychology of the,

1330
00:31:56.691 --> 00:31:58.570
the difference between when you first were like,

1331
00:31:58.571 --> 00:31:58.961
fuck it,

1332
00:31:58.961 --> 00:32:02.390
let's give this a shot to when you actually have something to lose now.

1333
00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:05.170
Like this conversation that you have with your kid where he doesn't want you to

1334
00:32:05.171 --> 00:32:05.771
fight anymore.

1335
00:32:05.771 --> 00:32:05.951
You know,

1336
00:32:05.951 --> 00:32:07.270
it's like I can't watch,

1337
00:32:07.271 --> 00:32:08.290
I don't want to watch her lose.

1338
00:32:08.291 --> 00:32:09.020
Like,

1339
00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:09.670
you know what,

1340
00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:10.421
it came down,

1341
00:32:10.421 --> 00:32:11.380
I think the couture fight,

1342
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:11.921
it was,

1343
00:32:11.921 --> 00:32:12.754
um,

1344
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.150
I defended my little tight at the time five consecutive times.

1345
00:32:16.151 --> 00:32:16.870
Um,

1346
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:19.780
and I was up in big bear for three months,

1347
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:20.891
the whole time,

1348
00:32:20.891 --> 00:32:21.281
three months.

1349
00:32:21.281 --> 00:32:23.650
I never left the mountain and I didn't do any PR.

1350
00:32:23.651 --> 00:32:24.100
I just,

1351
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.970
I sat up there and I busted my ass and I thought I was prepared.

1352
00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.710
I may overtrained myself a little bit.

1353
00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:30.000
Um,

1354
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.690
I was the first problem I had with my back.

1355
00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.470
Uh,

1356
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.681
you know,

1357
00:32:32.681 --> 00:32:34.900
I came down and got injections in my back.

1358
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:36.263
Um,

1359
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.200
I didn't want to pull out.

1360
00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:38.830
I was like,

1361
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:38.990
what?

1362
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.470
What is it?

1363
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:40.490
What did it feel like?

1364
00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:40.850
Um,

1365
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:42.680
it felt like someone stabbed me,

1366
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.790
right.

1367
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:44.510
Um,

1368
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:45.440
above my tailbone.

1369
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:46.550
So what did it feel like?

1370
00:32:46.551 --> 00:32:47.720
It was in the spine,

1371
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:48.831
the spine.

1372
00:32:48.831 --> 00:32:49.270
It was like,

1373
00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:52.340
it felt like a writer and I'm like literally right on the spinal cord.

1374
00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.290
So what happened was a bulge disc,

1375
00:32:54.291 --> 00:32:58.040
the disc I bulged and oppressed in my spinal cord and my legs were completely

1376
00:32:58.041 --> 00:32:58.540
numb.

1377
00:32:58.540 --> 00:32:59.240
Oh.

1378
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.760
And it was the worst and it was a month before the fight for five couture.

1379
00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.130
He knows the worst pain ever and people don't understand.

1380
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.950
And I get all the time people will make.

1381
00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.470
Tito makes excuses and Dah,

1382
00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:07.610
Dah,

1383
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:08.030
Dah.

1384
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:08.631
People made it.

1385
00:33:08.631 --> 00:33:13.631
If you guys ever had back pain before trying to train on it or run on it,

1386
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.700
not only when someone says it's,

1387
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:19.250
it's an excuse really.

1388
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.270
It's true.

1389
00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:20.630
Yeah.

1390
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.841
You know,

1391
00:33:20.841 --> 00:33:22.340
you could say it's an excuse,

1392
00:33:22.341 --> 00:33:26.600
but if you want to have all the information about a guy's performance,

1393
00:33:26.601 --> 00:33:31.220
you really got to know first of all what goes wrong and training how many

1394
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:35.080
different dudes go into the cage fucked up or rather how many,

1395
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.730
so many times when you see guys you don't even know,

1396
00:33:37.731 --> 00:33:38.850
they might have uh,

1397
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:41.630
something wrong with their shoulder or they might have something wrong with

1398
00:33:41.631 --> 00:33:42.261
their hip,

1399
00:33:42.261 --> 00:33:42.531
you know,

1400
00:33:42.531 --> 00:33:44.030
you never know.

1401
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:45.710
And you know,

1402
00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:48.080
two people get upset at you bringing that up.

1403
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:50.090
You've gone through knee surgeries,

1404
00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:52.010
back surgery.

1405
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.570
I had an ACL replacement.

1406
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.260
Um,

1407
00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:54.830
I fought,

1408
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:55.070
uh,

1409
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:58.040
six months later after I had back surgery,

1410
00:33:58.041 --> 00:33:58.790
two level fusion,

1411
00:33:58.790 --> 00:33:59.400
my lower back,

1412
00:33:59.400 --> 00:33:59.721
l four,

1413
00:33:59.721 --> 00:34:00.950
five s one fused.

1414
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.320
I fought a year later on when they fuse it,

1415
00:34:03.321 --> 00:34:07.180
is it like they did with Nate Corey where it's like a flexible piece of

1416
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.640
something in between a plastic they fuse,

1417
00:34:09.641 --> 00:34:11.260
they put screws in it,

1418
00:34:11.970 --> 00:34:15.800
they bolt them together and then they get like one disc and it becomes like,

1419
00:34:15.801 --> 00:34:17.000
why becomes one,

1420
00:34:17.001 --> 00:34:17.400
right?

1421
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:17.811
Oh yeah,

1422
00:34:17.811 --> 00:34:19.430
we'll actually four became a long,

1423
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:20.900
actually no tube comes one.

1424
00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:21.470
And,

1425
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:22.010
uh,

1426
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.310
and that,

1427
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.740
does that change your movement to change them?

1428
00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.680
I could touch my toes.

1429
00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:28.820
My hands can touch the bottom of the ground when my feet flat.

1430
00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:30.530
I'm not a problem at all.

1431
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:30.741
You know,

1432
00:34:30.741 --> 00:34:32.060
it was a hard,

1433
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:33.110
um,

1434
00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:33.943
recovery.

1435
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:34.371
Very,

1436
00:34:34.371 --> 00:34:35.270
very hard recovery.

1437
00:34:35.271 --> 00:34:35.661
Very.

1438
00:34:35.661 --> 00:34:36.494
I mean,

1439
00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:39.050
that was the worst pain I ever had in my life.

1440
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.460
I've had ACL surgery.

1441
00:34:40.461 --> 00:34:41.294
Like I said,

1442
00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:43.430
I had my neck fused,

1443
00:34:43.431 --> 00:34:45.050
a c six c seven fused.

1444
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:46.430
I had meniscus,

1445
00:34:46.431 --> 00:34:47.264
50%.

1446
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:48.041
That fuse.

1447
00:34:48.041 --> 00:34:49.190
Is it the same way?

1448
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:50.650
I'm having an exact same way.

1449
00:34:50.651 --> 00:34:51.500
Same exact thing.

1450
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:52.730
I'm a Dr. William Smith.

1451
00:34:52.731 --> 00:34:54.110
I don't want us Vegas who did my surgery,

1452
00:34:54.111 --> 00:34:55.790
who's the best surgeon in the world?

1453
00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:56.120
Um,

1454
00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.110
and I'll say that again.

1455
00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:00.170
Dr. William Smith is the best surgeon in the world.

1456
00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:00.920
Um,

1457
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.610
I was able to bounce back and fight and I was about to go to bounce back and,

1458
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:04.903
and train.

1459
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:07.460
I was able not to have back pain anymore.

1460
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.791
I mean,

1461
00:35:07.791 --> 00:35:12.500
it was so bad where when my escalate and I actually was leaning so much on my

1462
00:35:12.501 --> 00:35:15.920
right ass that when I got my back fixed,

1463
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:18.290
my seat was still leaning.

1464
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:21.950
It was dented and I would sit in and I was like,

1465
00:35:21.951 --> 00:35:24.540
what the fuck Jesus is that,

1466
00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.580
that is just weird.

1467
00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.370
And just little small things mean getting up to go to the bathroom and go sit

1468
00:35:28.371 --> 00:35:30.230
down and go to the bathroom was impossible.

1469
00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:33.530
And it's the same thing in your lower back cause it was your neck.

1470
00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:33.770
This,

1471
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:34.603
they're both useful.

1472
00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:35.900
Was it the same kind of pain?

1473
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.350
Um,

1474
00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:37.680
it was pain.

1475
00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:39.330
The one of my butt,

1476
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:39.871
or excuse me,

1477
00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:40.620
in my back,

1478
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.540
would go down to my butt and go down to my legs.

1479
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:43.740
My legs go numb.

1480
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.500
The one that was in my neck would go through my whole body.

1481
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:47.910
It was going down my arms.

1482
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:52.950
And this before I fought Forrest and UFC was the UFC one oh six where I had a

1483
00:35:52.951 --> 00:35:53.880
ruptured disc.

1484
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:54.990
The disc was ruptured.

1485
00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.520
And I still find,

1486
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.800
I mean,

1487
00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.100
it wasn't,

1488
00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:59.400
I mean I had no choice.

1489
00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:00.331
I gotta pay bills.

1490
00:36:00.331 --> 00:36:00.990
Right.

1491
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:01.201
But,

1492
00:36:01.201 --> 00:36:01.381
uh,

1493
00:36:01.381 --> 00:36:02.450
they went in and they fused it.

1494
00:36:02.451 --> 00:36:05.790
They took a desktop completely stuck in two bolts and a plate.

1495
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:06.901
And the spy,

1496
00:36:06.901 --> 00:36:07.621
the way Brian,

1497
00:36:07.621 --> 00:36:08.700
that video's online.

1498
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:08.971
Yes.

1499
00:36:08.971 --> 00:36:10.980
That surgery,

1500
00:36:10.981 --> 00:36:12.990
you got to see it because people don't understand.

1501
00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:13.950
You got to walk people.

1502
00:36:13.951 --> 00:36:16.950
You gotta watch this because you'll see this guy's putting in the screws in my

1503
00:36:16.951 --> 00:36:17.370
neck.

1504
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:19.800
He's hammering in his neck like his neck as a chair.

1505
00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:20.131
Yeah.

1506
00:36:20.131 --> 00:36:21.570
And like putting in these bolts in you here.

1507
00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:22.653
Yeah.

1508
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:24.930
It's like he's going on the bolts.

1509
00:36:24.931 --> 00:36:27.960
It's like he's hammering a leg in on a wooden chair,

1510
00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:30.900
Dunk Tito Ortiz surgery,

1511
00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:31.801
surgery,

1512
00:36:31.801 --> 00:36:32.340
video,

1513
00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.173
neck surgery.

1514
00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:34.810
And that surgery is,

1515
00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.670
is gnarly.

1516
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:36.560
But you know,

1517
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:37.651
it was challenges,

1518
00:36:37.651 --> 00:36:38.160
man.

1519
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.240
God gives me challenges,

1520
00:36:39.241 --> 00:36:39.481
you know,

1521
00:36:39.481 --> 00:36:40.530
I could,

1522
00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:41.431
you know,

1523
00:36:41.431 --> 00:36:45.120
as everyone calls me or tries to call me a pussy for getting,

1524
00:36:45.121 --> 00:36:46.230
for making excuses,

1525
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.530
I kept it and Pussy and pulled out of my whole career and I wasn't letting it

1526
00:36:49.531 --> 00:36:50.364
happen.

1527
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:52.410
Be able to call you a pussy or silly.

1528
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.891
You can't,

1529
00:36:52.891 --> 00:36:53.850
you can't address them.

1530
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:54.713
There's silly.

1531
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.870
It's a look it,

1532
00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.050
there's so many.

1533
00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:58.580
Is that

1534
00:36:58.580 --> 00:36:59.090
<v 3>the video?</v>

1535
00:36:59.090 --> 00:36:59.720
Oh yeah.

1536
00:36:59.720 --> 00:36:59.961
Oh,

1537
00:36:59.961 --> 00:37:01.040
you don't even want to watch this,

1538
00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:04.100
but that's the spacer,

1539
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:05.810
that thing that guys screwing.

1540
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:07.490
That's to open the neck up.

1541
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:08.420
Oh look,

1542
00:37:08.421 --> 00:37:08.700
no.

1543
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.010
Normally this is,

1544
00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:11.840
that's me on the ground.

1545
00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:15.710
I had him record it just so people understood what they're going through.

1546
00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.140
This is so fucking crazy,

1547
00:37:18.141 --> 00:37:18.491
man.

1548
00:37:18.491 --> 00:37:19.790
Now he's clipping out the disc.

1549
00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:21.470
Oh my God,

1550
00:37:21.471 --> 00:37:22.400
this is not nuts.

1551
00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:23.960
You guys see a fucking wide,

1552
00:37:23.961 --> 00:37:27.020
your neck is open you up and you'll see the little two guys in there with a

1553
00:37:27.021 --> 00:37:29.840
hammer and pulling shit out of the blood on the two right there.

1554
00:37:29.841 --> 00:37:30.980
The second through the pipe

1555
00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:34.130
on the disc out.

1556
00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.760
Oh my God.

1557
00:37:35.761 --> 00:37:36.181
And he's like,

1558
00:37:36.181 --> 00:37:36.471
you know,

1559
00:37:36.471 --> 00:37:38.120
he's just pulling a little disk pieces out.

1560
00:37:38.121 --> 00:37:39.620
He's pulling chunks out.

1561
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:40.743
Yep.

1562
00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.180
Dude.

1563
00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:41.590
I mean,

1564
00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:42.423
oh,

1565
00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.600
the work they do now is just amazing.

1566
00:37:44.601 --> 00:37:44.751
I mean,

1567
00:37:44.751 --> 00:37:45.041
like I said,

1568
00:37:45.041 --> 00:37:48.020
this Dr. William Smith and Ms God has given him some blessed hands.

1569
00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.300
Your head is a car.

1570
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:55.210
You're servicing the car that has a broken trend or a blown transmission.

1571
00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:56.840
That mother Fucker was straining as.

1572
00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:58.070
He's pulling shit out of there.

1573
00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:59.900
I just wait until you see the,

1574
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:01.310
the hammer part.

1575
00:38:01.311 --> 00:38:01.840
Once this,

1576
00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.440
he's happy you have no,

1577
00:38:03.441 --> 00:38:07.120
he's hammering in the bolt and oh Jesus.

1578
00:38:07.121 --> 00:38:08.960
And then the raddest thing is too is when he bought,

1579
00:38:08.961 --> 00:38:09.711
when he screws them in,

1580
00:38:09.711 --> 00:38:11.060
like right sitting right now,

1581
00:38:11.061 --> 00:38:14.300
he just click on the first little tip of the screws and then he goes with his

1582
00:38:14.301 --> 00:38:14.931
whole hand.

1583
00:38:14.931 --> 00:38:16.280
He goes it right right here.

1584
00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.050
And now he's tightening it down.

1585
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:19.783
Oh my goodness.

1586
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.960
People online.

1587
00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.430
You check us out in the audio for this.

1588
00:38:22.431 --> 00:38:24.860
I mean it was ridic and hear the squeaking.

1589
00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:25.430
Oh,

1590
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:26.360
let's hear the squeaking

1591
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:31.103
<v 6>and it was like tap,</v>

1592
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:32.141
tap,

1593
00:38:32.141 --> 00:38:32.351
tap,

1594
00:38:32.351 --> 00:38:33.184
tap.

1595
00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:37.763
Oh.

1596
00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:41.350
Oh Jesus.

1597
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:42.820
Fucking Christ.

1598
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:44.680
And then you barely hear him.

1599
00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.540
It's like he's changing the tire,

1600
00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:47.870
but it's actually changing in the neck.

1601
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:53.380
We'll get a space or this fucking giant hunk of metal.

1602
00:38:53.381 --> 00:38:56.530
They're sticking inside year after I got this done and I watched it,

1603
00:38:56.531 --> 00:38:56.901
so I was like,

1604
00:38:56.901 --> 00:38:57.840
you made me you.

1605
00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.120
I'm like fucking refueled.

1606
00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:00.943
Oh,

1607
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:02.940
three millimeter punch.

1608
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:04.200
Ooh,

1609
00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.300
I like the term while

1610
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.170
<v 4>you were healing up.</v>

1611
00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:07.920
Yeah.

1612
00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:08.810
Hello.

1613
00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:10.200
I was laying in bed.

1614
00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:11.183
It was actually got,

1615
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:12.383
I got it done.

1616
00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.510
It was my son and my boy's second birthday,

1617
00:39:15.511 --> 00:39:18.960
Jesse and journey second birthday and they're having a party downstairs and I

1618
00:39:18.961 --> 00:39:20.340
was up in bed laying down.

1619
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.570
Ooh,

1620
00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:22.201
we're talking about it.

1621
00:39:22.201 --> 00:39:22.800
I just like,

1622
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:22.981
man,

1623
00:39:22.981 --> 00:39:24.390
I wish I'd be downstairs with my family,

1624
00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:28.320
but you know the sacrifice that we do to become fighters couldn't even move

1625
00:39:28.321 --> 00:39:28.980
around.

1626
00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.180
How long were you in bed for?

1627
00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:31.830
I was in bed for a week,

1628
00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:32.813
a whole week.

1629
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:34.380
I have to ride for surgery.

1630
00:39:34.381 --> 00:39:35.010
I got out,

1631
00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:35.790
I got up,

1632
00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:36.481
had a neck brace on.

1633
00:39:36.481 --> 00:39:37.021
I got up,

1634
00:39:37.021 --> 00:39:37.531
I stood up,

1635
00:39:37.531 --> 00:39:38.490
I could walk to my car.

1636
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.330
I sat down.

1637
00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:40.590
My friend Juan drove me back,

1638
00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:41.430
uh,

1639
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:43.050
Huntington beach for holy Shit.

1640
00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:45.630
You drove like when you were in a car?

1641
00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:46.350
I was in the car.

1642
00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:48.660
And if feel like your head would be like a weeble,

1643
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:49.623
I'm let alone me.

1644
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:52.140
I was on my fandom level heads a little different.

1645
00:39:52.141 --> 00:39:52.840
You're in a fandom.

1646
00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:53.520
Yeah,

1647
00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.720
but the raddest thing is,

1648
00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:56.580
I had this during the shoot in the ultimate fighter,

1649
00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.310
so they shot the ultimate fighter and I was getting kicked out.

1650
00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:03.100
I got kicked off because I had to get neck surgery and back then the old

1651
00:40:03.101 --> 00:40:06.840
provider was shot six weeks before Danny goes,

1652
00:40:06.841 --> 00:40:08.010
you can't be seen in public.

1653
00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:08.491
I was like,

1654
00:40:08.491 --> 00:40:09.720
what do you mean they can be seen in public?

1655
00:40:09.721 --> 00:40:10.030
He goes,

1656
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:12.840
you got to wait until we show that get kicked up for it can be seen in public.

1657
00:40:12.841 --> 00:40:13.591
Are you serious?

1658
00:40:13.591 --> 00:40:14.190
She goes,

1659
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:14.371
yeah.

1660
00:40:14.371 --> 00:40:15.480
Have you been selling with Siena public?

1661
00:40:15.481 --> 00:40:16.750
They're gonna know you're gonna have to get neck surgery,

1662
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:17.440
mom.

1663
00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.210
Okay.

1664
00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:19.043
He goes,

1665
00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.170
I had to stay in the house for an extra month and a half and hide.

1666
00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:23.730
Yeah.

1667
00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:24.660
Literally hide her.

1668
00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.490
I would go to my physical therapy.

1669
00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:29.160
I had a pull to the back door and I was like,

1670
00:40:29.161 --> 00:40:29.401
all right,

1671
00:40:29.401 --> 00:40:30.060
no one's looking.

1672
00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.310
I go because at the time Paparazzi would be looking around and stuff.

1673
00:40:32.311 --> 00:40:32.750
So I was like,

1674
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:34.540
that's a lariat would run,

1675
00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.800
make a run to the door and I'd get in and everybody was all hush hush when I was

1676
00:40:37.801 --> 00:40:38.071
there.

1677
00:40:38.071 --> 00:40:38.880
And it was like,

1678
00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:39.810
it was the worst.

1679
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.060
I mean not to be able to go out was,

1680
00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:43.770
was was hard cause I had a neck brace on and on.

1681
00:40:43.771 --> 00:40:46.170
I couldn't take my neck brace off for seven weeks.

1682
00:40:46.171 --> 00:40:47.004
So it was,

1683
00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.250
how long was it after surgery before you could actually train?

1684
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:51.060
Um,

1685
00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:53.580
it was probably about two and a half months,

1686
00:40:53.581 --> 00:40:56.250
three months where I was able to do a little bit cardio stuff.

1687
00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:56.730
Um,

1688
00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:57.563
that's it.

1689
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.520
Yeah,

1690
00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:00.120
it's like I was able to hit the bag a little bit.

1691
00:41:00.121 --> 00:41:00.871
So for two months,

1692
00:41:00.871 --> 00:41:01.351
nothing,

1693
00:41:01.351 --> 00:41:04.260
no movement or a little physical therapy.

1694
00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:04.521
You know,

1695
00:41:04.521 --> 00:41:05.354
I uh,

1696
00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:06.000
um,

1697
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.780
Joe down here down in Costa Mesa called a pro sport.

1698
00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:11.460
We did a lot of physical therapy stuff.

1699
00:41:11.461 --> 00:41:12.600
Rather I was a lot of movement,

1700
00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.760
some shoulder workout stuff,

1701
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:16.380
a little arm paddling,

1702
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.330
biking,

1703
00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:18.150
um,

1704
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:19.350
but all very low key,

1705
00:41:19.351 --> 00:41:19.911
very low,

1706
00:41:19.911 --> 00:41:20.551
low key,

1707
00:41:20.551 --> 00:41:20.970
you know.

1708
00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:22.340
And the way my doctor put,

1709
00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.350
he's a cheater gonna understand all those nerve and these are starting to heal

1710
00:41:25.351 --> 00:41:27.330
up again for the first two,

1711
00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:29.910
three with four weeks you got to chill,

1712
00:41:29.911 --> 00:41:31.140
you got to let those things just hill.

1713
00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.100
So I mean I was eating painkillers like no thing

1714
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.310
<v 5>and when I was like just handfuls of them,</v>

1715
00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:37.153
handfuls of them,

1716
00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:39.380
but he says you don't want to feel any pain.

1717
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:39.741
He goes,

1718
00:41:39.741 --> 00:41:42.050
when you feel pain and gives irritation to the area.

1719
00:41:42.051 --> 00:41:44.450
I was trying to be hilled and it's not going to heal that fast.

1720
00:41:44.451 --> 00:41:44.840
So I was like,

1721
00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.200
all right,

1722
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.160
I'm never going to fill up time.

1723
00:41:46.161 --> 00:41:48.210
So he's telling you to take as many painters,

1724
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:50.180
he sounds like I do to sell on painkillers,

1725
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.600
but I mean he,

1726
00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:55.420
you got to put it to acknowledge it's not the factor of sound painkillers.

1727
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:57.950
I mean he's not making money off the painkillers he's making.

1728
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:59.120
I'm totally kidding.

1729
00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.180
Just listeners don't understand that.

1730
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:02.960
Right?

1731
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.150
So it's important actually to take those pills,

1732
00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.080
take those pills,

1733
00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:06.980
doctor say take them,

1734
00:42:06.981 --> 00:42:09.050
take them when it's time to get off of them.

1735
00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.130
Stop taking them.

1736
00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.300
How hard is that though?

1737
00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:12.163
It takes a week.

1738
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.930
It's,

1739
00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:13.160
it's,

1740
00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:13.700
it's hard.

1741
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:13.911
You know,

1742
00:42:13.911 --> 00:42:18.911
you go through the little shakes and the sick feeling like you're have the flu.

1743
00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.590
How ridiculous is it that that Shit is legal?

1744
00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:21.920
Yeah.

1745
00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:26.280
It's gotta be another way to fucking stop pain then that rubber cement bold.

1746
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:28.790
It's crazy.

1747
00:42:28.791 --> 00:42:29.300
Cause you know,

1748
00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:29.751
people,

1749
00:42:29.751 --> 00:42:30.010
they,

1750
00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:30.290
the,

1751
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:32.900
they'll take painkillers and then they tried to get off of them and they're in

1752
00:42:32.901 --> 00:42:34.040
pain and they're like,

1753
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:35.630
I got to take painkillers due to the pain.

1754
00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:36.080
No,

1755
00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.040
it's because your body's addicted.

1756
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.970
Addicted to them.

1757
00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:42.290
I know so many fucking people that have had problems with pain pills.

1758
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:45.350
I know a lot of people and there's a lot of kids in her school to get them from

1759
00:42:45.351 --> 00:42:46.280
their parents and they're,

1760
00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:46.640
yeah,

1761
00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.480
they're snorting them.

1762
00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:48.080
Yeah.

1763
00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.740
A lot of kids are smoking them and snorting them.

1764
00:42:49.741 --> 00:42:50.820
Cause Norton Adderall.

1765
00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.850
So Calculus while that,

1766
00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:53.630
yeah,

1767
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:55.070
it's bizarre.

1768
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:56.291
We were growing up,

1769
00:42:56.291 --> 00:42:57.680
I mean kids while we were smoking weed,

1770
00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:58.591
you know what I mean?

1771
00:42:58.591 --> 00:43:00.170
There maybe the rich kids had cocaine.

1772
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:01.490
I mean that was,

1773
00:43:01.491 --> 00:43:02.324
that was it man.

1774
00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:05.150
So many people that we're normal people.

1775
00:43:05.151 --> 00:43:07.730
And then they had a back injury or something.

1776
00:43:07.731 --> 00:43:10.280
They got on pain pills and they could not fucking get off.

1777
00:43:10.281 --> 00:43:11.031
Well that's what started my,

1778
00:43:11.031 --> 00:43:11.221
My,

1779
00:43:11.221 --> 00:43:11.720
my dad,

1780
00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.400
he had a hernia,

1781
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:17.930
he had a hernia and he had surgery and I started taking painkillers and uh,

1782
00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:19.243
my uncle,

1783
00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.700
cause the doctor said we can't prescribe painkillers anymore and he was still,

1784
00:43:22.701 --> 00:43:23.540
I was still in pain.

1785
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:26.090
So my uncle hooked him up with should try suppose heroin.

1786
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:28.220
Oh Bam.

1787
00:43:28.221 --> 00:43:30.940
All of a sudden everything life changed from that point on it.

1788
00:43:30.941 --> 00:43:31.281
Cause my dad,

1789
00:43:31.281 --> 00:43:32.840
he's still in the business when I was young,

1790
00:43:32.841 --> 00:43:34.460
I mean I remember when I was five,

1791
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:37.130
my dad had his own carpentry business and he did well.

1792
00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:37.421
I mean we,

1793
00:43:37.421 --> 00:43:38.254
we lived,

1794
00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.590
we lived a great life.

1795
00:43:39.591 --> 00:43:40.370
I thought,

1796
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:41.330
I mean at the time,

1797
00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:42.970
but I mean when I was six years old,

1798
00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:43.813
everything changed.

1799
00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:45.340
I mean I remember perfectly,

1800
00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:46.790
everything changes so fast.

1801
00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:48.450
All of a sudden we're in a house,

1802
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.110
him to hear my parents fighting all the time and all of a sudden we're in the

1803
00:43:51.111 --> 00:43:51.441
house,

1804
00:43:51.441 --> 00:43:52.730
we're living in someone's garage.

1805
00:43:52.731 --> 00:43:54.110
And then we in someone's trailer.

1806
00:43:54.111 --> 00:43:54.944
And when someone,

1807
00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.690
we're in a car for a while,

1808
00:43:56.691 --> 00:43:59.390
they were in the motels and it was,

1809
00:43:59.391 --> 00:44:00.211
it was challenging him.

1810
00:44:00.211 --> 00:44:00.371
And I'm,

1811
00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:04.340
I'm very thankful for my mom leaving my dad cause I got a second chance in life

1812
00:44:04.341 --> 00:44:05.174
I think.

1813
00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:08.990
Do you feel like you could have ever been the guy you were if you didn't have

1814
00:44:08.991 --> 00:44:10.010
such a shit child?

1815
00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:10.760
No.

1816
00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:11.330
No Way.

1817
00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:12.590
There's no way you would have that drive.

1818
00:44:12.591 --> 00:44:12.850
Right?

1819
00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:13.040
That's,

1820
00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.540
I wouldn't have the same drive nowhere you'd be,

1821
00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:17.630
but I would like little thingies still be a winner though.

1822
00:44:17.631 --> 00:44:17.961
Right.

1823
00:44:17.961 --> 00:44:18.261
You know what,

1824
00:44:18.261 --> 00:44:19.580
I figured something out.

1825
00:44:19.581 --> 00:44:20.300
I would,

1826
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:21.133
I would,

1827
00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:23.900
I may be a little bit better in school and you know,

1828
00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:24.180
I,

1829
00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:24.501
if I,

1830
00:44:24.501 --> 00:44:24.831
if I,

1831
00:44:24.831 --> 00:44:25.820
if I got a different opportunity,

1832
00:44:25.821 --> 00:44:27.140
I think if I got the San Martine,

1833
00:44:27.141 --> 00:44:29.690
I'm giving my son a B in a straight a student.

1834
00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.050
I think I,

1835
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:31.920
I mean my

1836
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:33.570
<v 4>parents are very artistic.</v>

1837
00:44:33.571 --> 00:44:37.290
My Dad was an artist and my dad was a carpenter and my mother's an artist.

1838
00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:38.243
Um,

1839
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:39.900
I think I have great brands.

1840
00:44:39.901 --> 00:44:41.280
I mean shit like a worrying right now.

1841
00:44:41.281 --> 00:44:44.940
I mean the business work I've done already by all the damage I've done to my

1842
00:44:44.941 --> 00:44:45.930
brain when I was younger.

1843
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:46.230
I,

1844
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:47.040
you know,

1845
00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:51.180
I'm a great capacity of just learning experience and I think that my kids have

1846
00:44:51.181 --> 00:44:52.140
that same opportunity now.

1847
00:44:52.141 --> 00:44:53.250
But without the drugs around,

1848
00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:56.270
<v 1>well you certainly got Outta MMA to uh,</v>

1849
00:44:56.390 --> 00:45:01.190
without incurring some like speech problems or any of this shit.

1850
00:45:01.191 --> 00:45:03.830
And we're starting to see now from guys see some of the guys now.

1851
00:45:03.831 --> 00:45:05.540
It just makes me cringe and I'm just like,

1852
00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:06.433
God man,

1853
00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:08.301
all those times,

1854
00:45:08.301 --> 00:45:10.700
all those fights and you think it gadget like God is what you see.

1855
00:45:10.701 --> 00:45:13.040
You guys stand up and just punch each other in the face.

1856
00:45:13.041 --> 00:45:13.790
And I was like,

1857
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.941
okay.

1858
00:45:13.941 --> 00:45:14.930
I look at boxers.

1859
00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:15.800
Yeah.

1860
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:16.220
I mean,

1861
00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:17.750
for perfect example,

1862
00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:18.693
<v 4>um,</v>

1863
00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:19.451
I actually,

1864
00:45:19.451 --> 00:45:24.451
one of my buddies who I back of the day who used to box a Fernando Vargas,

1865
00:45:25.061 --> 00:45:26.680
and I know Fernando,

1866
00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.030
<v 1>you changed a lot,</v>

1867
00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:29.631
a lot,

1868
00:45:29.631 --> 00:45:30.051
a lot.

1869
00:45:30.051 --> 00:45:30.561
And I mean,

1870
00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:31.580
I love him.

1871
00:45:31.581 --> 00:45:32.330
He's my boy.

1872
00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:33.110
Great Guy.

1873
00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:33.990
Awesome guys.

1874
00:45:33.991 --> 00:45:35.060
Stand up dude.

1875
00:45:35.061 --> 00:45:35.421
Cool,

1876
00:45:35.421 --> 00:45:35.931
cool click.

1877
00:45:35.931 --> 00:45:37.130
There's no doubt he paid the price.

1878
00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:38.210
He paid a price span.

1879
00:45:38.211 --> 00:45:39.044
I mean these guys,

1880
00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:40.970
they getting in these weird,

1881
00:45:40.971 --> 00:45:45.460
when you know a guy before he pays the price and then you see the results and

1882
00:45:45.461 --> 00:45:45.780
then I go,

1883
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:45.940
oh,

1884
00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:46.641
this is real.

1885
00:45:46.641 --> 00:45:48.830
The Trinidad fight was the one that changed everything.

1886
00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:50.550
I met Terry Norris once in vague.

1887
00:45:50.551 --> 00:45:51.381
I didn't actually meet him.

1888
00:45:51.381 --> 00:45:52.370
I was standing next to him,

1889
00:45:52.371 --> 00:45:52.851
I should say,

1890
00:45:52.851 --> 00:45:54.980
while he was talking to a fan and he was a,

1891
00:45:54.981 --> 00:45:55.191
you know,

1892
00:45:55.191 --> 00:45:56.001
someone's asking them,

1893
00:45:56.001 --> 00:45:56.170
you know,

1894
00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:56.630
what's,

1895
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:57.630
what's going on with you?

1896
00:45:57.631 --> 00:45:58.464
You're going to fight again.

1897
00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.440
And he was talking and it was almost like,

1898
00:46:00.441 --> 00:46:01.220
it was a joke.

1899
00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:01.671
I was like,

1900
00:46:01.671 --> 00:46:02.504
is he drunk?

1901
00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:03.373
Like what's going on?

1902
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:04.190
And then I realized,

1903
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:05.120
oh Jesus,

1904
00:46:05.121 --> 00:46:06.740
this is why you haven't seen him in years.

1905
00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:08.320
He's fucking punch drunk.

1906
00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.190
It's just from taking so many blows.

1907
00:46:10.191 --> 00:46:13.340
And so is it exciting to put a great show by it on yes,

1908
00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:15.590
but to stand there and slug with guys.

1909
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:18.140
Well talk not just that,

1910
00:46:18.141 --> 00:46:19.670
it's also the gym wars,

1911
00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:20.620
you know,

1912
00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:22.910
there's 100% your trail hand.

1913
00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:24.530
He got hit too.

1914
00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:28.880
Terry Norris got hit by guys like Mugabi when Gabby was a monster.

1915
00:46:28.881 --> 00:46:30.080
When he was Kayo and everybody,

1916
00:46:30.081 --> 00:46:31.220
he Kao Terry Norris.

1917
00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.210
It was ugly.

1918
00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.300
Or did Terry who did Terry Norris Kale.

1919
00:46:35.301 --> 00:46:36.950
That was like a vicious Kale puncher.

1920
00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:39.230
I'm pretty sure Mugabi take care of Norris to,

1921
00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.030
I don't want to say that.

1922
00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:40.300
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1923
00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:40.541
I mean,

1924
00:46:40.541 --> 00:46:41.440
he looks to my guys now.

1925
00:46:41.441 --> 00:46:42.790
I mean guys at Tyson's five,

1926
00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:43.683
I mean,

1927
00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:44.763
they're not all there.

1928
00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:47.230
I mean,

1929
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:48.550
you see a lot of his guys go through.

1930
00:46:48.551 --> 00:46:51.190
Some things have been football players and other guys that have the concussion.

1931
00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:51.920
<v 1>Oh,</v>

1932
00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:54.950
Terry Norris CalEd Mugabi Jesus Christ.

1933
00:46:54.951 --> 00:46:55.610
Joe Rogan.

1934
00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:56.211
I know Joe.

1935
00:46:56.211 --> 00:46:56.970
Come on dude.

1936
00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:57.980
It was um,

1937
00:46:58.760 --> 00:46:59.870
Julian Jackson.

1938
00:46:59.871 --> 00:47:00.910
Who the fuck was,

1939
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:03.770
was it that Mugabi like knocked that where it was really ugly?

1940
00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:05.773
I don't remember her.

1941
00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:06.380
Look.

1942
00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:09.350
Terry Noyes had gotten stopped a bunch of times in his career.

1943
00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:10.453
Um,

1944
00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:11.360
and you know,

1945
00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:11.731
the,

1946
00:47:11.731 --> 00:47:12.501
the fights that,

1947
00:47:12.501 --> 00:47:13.520
where he got stopped,

1948
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:15.680
it wasn't even that,

1949
00:47:15.681 --> 00:47:18.050
just that damage that really did it to him.

1950
00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.160
I think it was June Jackson knocked out during ours.

1951
00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:21.770
There was really the gym wars,

1952
00:47:21.771 --> 00:47:22.340
right?

1953
00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.950
The gym wars are the things that people don't see,

1954
00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:26.420
but they accumulate.

1955
00:47:26.421 --> 00:47:28.940
And a lot of times it might as well be a fucking,

1956
00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:29.651
there's,

1957
00:47:29.651 --> 00:47:30.340
I mean I've seen,

1958
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:33.340
I've been in gyms were watching dudes who are high level guys.

1959
00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:34.031
We're fighting,

1960
00:47:34.031 --> 00:47:36.280
we're fighting fighting mean rampage.

1961
00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:37.510
Rampage where channel partners.

1962
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:37.840
Yeah,

1963
00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:38.673
we would spar,

1964
00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:39.513
we would fight.

1965
00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:40.210
We would,

1966
00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:41.290
we'd kick each other's asses.

1967
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:42.124
We would fight.

1968
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:45.700
I mean it was just that type of thing where we've got the best of each other and

1969
00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:46.361
it was like,

1970
00:47:46.361 --> 00:47:46.661
all right,

1971
00:47:46.661 --> 00:47:47.190
cool.

1972
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:49.240
Well good job of that.

1973
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.980
Good job.

1974
00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:50.201
All right,

1975
00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:51.034
good job.

1976
00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.060
Some guys can hear that,

1977
00:47:52.061 --> 00:47:55.840
but some guys are not that durable and then you slowly see it slipping away on

1978
00:47:55.841 --> 00:47:57.850
them and you know exactly what's causing it.

1979
00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:58.121
I mean,

1980
00:47:58.121 --> 00:48:00.310
my biggest thing was in my training of trainers or I'll be like,

1981
00:48:00.311 --> 00:48:00.491
okay,

1982
00:48:00.491 --> 00:48:01.540
we're sparring three times a week.

1983
00:48:01.541 --> 00:48:01.830
I was like,

1984
00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:02.031
Whoa,

1985
00:48:02.031 --> 00:48:02.230
Whoa,

1986
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:02.491
whoa,

1987
00:48:02.491 --> 00:48:02.890
Whoa,

1988
00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:03.101
whoa.

1989
00:48:03.101 --> 00:48:04.780
We smarter and so much for and be like,

1990
00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:05.480
we don't want to spar.

1991
00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:05.740
I go,

1992
00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:05.951
no,

1993
00:48:05.951 --> 00:48:07.600
I just want to get my ass whipped every day.

1994
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:08.051
I go,

1995
00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:09.190
let's do taught twice a week.

1996
00:48:09.191 --> 00:48:09.581
All right.

1997
00:48:09.581 --> 00:48:10.414
We'll do twice a week.

1998
00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:11.180
Just,

1999
00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:11.620
I mean there's,

2000
00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:11.861
I mean,

2001
00:48:11.861 --> 00:48:12.411
don't get me wrong,

2002
00:48:12.411 --> 00:48:13.151
and there was times,

2003
00:48:13.151 --> 00:48:15.520
I mean years and years and years that we do three times a week,

2004
00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.200
sometimes four times a week.

2005
00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:18.543
But I mean,

2006
00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:20.230
I don't like to get hit.

2007
00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:20.981
She tells me,

2008
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:22.060
Hey guy who likes to get hit,

2009
00:48:22.061 --> 00:48:23.170
I'm going to show you a stupid man.

2010
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.800
Yeah,

2011
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.390
well I think that it's,

2012
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:28.630
it's a weird aspect of MMA.

2013
00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:29.440
You know,

2014
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:29.831
the,

2015
00:48:29.831 --> 00:48:30.071
the,

2016
00:48:30.071 --> 00:48:32.620
the guys who just want to stand there and bang,

2017
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.060
they just want to stand and bang.

2018
00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:34.361
I'm like,

2019
00:48:34.361 --> 00:48:35.170
man,

2020
00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:36.190
you don't know what you're saying.

2021
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.880
Like you're,

2022
00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.070
you're saying something crazy like you got a ticket.

2023
00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:39.551
Okay.

2024
00:48:39.551 --> 00:48:43.420
And there's only so many places you can punch a hole in that ticket and you're

2025
00:48:43.421 --> 00:48:45.550
just going to give up all these tickets on purpose.

2026
00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.760
That's just to put on a show called fans love you.

2027
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:49.241
Awesome.

2028
00:48:49.241 --> 00:48:49.691
Great.

2029
00:48:49.691 --> 00:48:52.420
But when it's time to cashing that check,

2030
00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:54.850
are you sure you can count those numbers out there?

2031
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:55.211
Well,

2032
00:48:55.211 --> 00:48:56.044
it's like,

2033
00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:59.080
I love the fights between the Toro Gadi and Micky ward.

2034
00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.600
They were fucking amazing fundraiser.

2035
00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:04.330
But if you know anything about brain damage and you know anything about what

2036
00:49:04.331 --> 00:49:04.961
causes it,

2037
00:49:04.961 --> 00:49:07.470
those are the type of fights and those guys are going to pay for it.

2038
00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:08.441
Pull up Brian,

2039
00:49:08.441 --> 00:49:09.131
pull up a video.

2040
00:49:09.131 --> 00:49:10.000
Julian Jackson,

2041
00:49:10.001 --> 00:49:10.510
Kao,

2042
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:11.350
Terry Norris,

2043
00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.780
Julian Jackson versus Terry Norris.

2044
00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:15.190
This is the fight that I was talking about,

2045
00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:16.750
which was frightening.

2046
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.960
Yeah.

2047
00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.670
Well Jackson was another murderous puncher.

2048
00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:23.080
You're knocking guys out and they're blowing small bubbles.

2049
00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:23.760
Yeah.

2050
00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.290
And your branding and working all the way there.

2051
00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:25.650
Yeah.

2052
00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:26.230
At all.

2053
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:27.340
That's not wicked going.

2054
00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:27.911
Hello.

2055
00:49:27.911 --> 00:49:28.490
I love it.

2056
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:29.170
Like Mama,

2057
00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:29.411
Dad,

2058
00:49:29.411 --> 00:49:29.710
dad.

2059
00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:30.101
No,

2060
00:49:30.101 --> 00:49:31.150
we're not in that home.

2061
00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:34.540
It seems like the guys with the grappling based styles that are trying to

2062
00:49:34.541 --> 00:49:35.710
initiate grappling more,

2063
00:49:35.711 --> 00:49:39.530
avoid a lot more damaged than the guys who are striking on image.

2064
00:49:39.531 --> 00:49:39.701
I mean,

2065
00:49:39.701 --> 00:49:40.540
if you can put on a show,

2066
00:49:40.541 --> 00:49:40.781
I mean,

2067
00:49:40.781 --> 00:49:44.410
I have done a great job in my career of being the dominant person on top.

2068
00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:45.191
Yeah.

2069
00:49:45.191 --> 00:49:46.300
Well not only not,

2070
00:49:46.301 --> 00:49:46.451
I mean,

2071
00:49:46.451 --> 00:49:49.420
look at a guy like Anderson Silva barely gets hit and everybody loves watching

2072
00:49:49.421 --> 00:49:49.870
him fight.

2073
00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:50.231
You don't,

2074
00:49:50.231 --> 00:49:52.240
you don't have to slug it out with people.

2075
00:49:52.241 --> 00:49:52.870
It's true.

2076
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:53.660
It's very true.

2077
00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:54.070
You know,

2078
00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:54.700
and you know,

2079
00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.350
people like watching submissions to,

2080
00:49:56.351 --> 00:49:59.290
it's people like watching a guy figured out how to be a killer.

2081
00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:00.880
And in the moment MMA,

2082
00:50:00.881 --> 00:50:01.810
you never know.

2083
00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:02.830
You never know.

2084
00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:04.570
But people can't figure out how to beat Anderson yet.

2085
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:06.810
Not yet has been present and very aggressive.

2086
00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:08.110
Maybe John Jones would,

2087
00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:10.510
what's the catch weight there?

2088
00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:11.403
I don't know.

2089
00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:12.580
I don't think you should be one.

2090
00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:13.590
I think two five.

2091
00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:16.600
I don't think John Jones can get any lower than two oh five for the WWE and be

2092
00:50:16.601 --> 00:50:17.434
healthy.

2093
00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:20.290
That's a Terry Noyes gang.

2094
00:50:20.291 --> 00:50:20.501
Kid.

2095
00:50:20.501 --> 00:50:21.310
Watch this shit.

2096
00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:22.300
Chilean Jackson was

2097
00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:28.850
Julian Jackson is one of the most murderous power punchers of all times.

2098
00:50:28.851 --> 00:50:30.120
He stuff like that was kissing.

2099
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:30.760
Yeah.

2100
00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:34.910
You realize how there's only watched the boxes of the year dying stuff like this

2101
00:50:34.911 --> 00:50:35.744
is what does it,

2102
00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:37.640
the fucking hour.

2103
00:50:37.641 --> 00:50:38.140
That guy,

2104
00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:38.940
right hook.

2105
00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:39.260
Ooh,

2106
00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:40.220
another right hook.

2107
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:45.950
Poor Terry took a few of those in his career.

2108
00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:48.673
He just,

2109
00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.960
I watched him fight dot Dana Rosenblatt.

2110
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:52.400
It was like one of his last fights.

2111
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:55.460
Dana was a friend of mine from Boston and uh,

2112
00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:57.050
Dana beat him by decision,

2113
00:50:57.051 --> 00:50:59.780
but I remember watching Terry and I find them like he can't pull the trigger.

2114
00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:00.890
His body's just,

2115
00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:05.250
he just couldn't pull the trigger things too that I talked to Jason Parillo

2116
00:51:05.251 --> 00:51:05.520
about,

2117
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:06.170
cause Jason,

2118
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:06.351
you know,

2119
00:51:06.351 --> 00:51:07.520
he's working some great guys.

2120
00:51:07.521 --> 00:51:08.150
I'll be,

2121
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:09.350
and he goes,

2122
00:51:09.351 --> 00:51:12.020
you tell when a guy loses it because when he hits pads,

2123
00:51:12.021 --> 00:51:12.950
when he spars,

2124
00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:14.683
it's not there.

2125
00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.630
You just lose your timing.

2126
00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.361
You lose everything.

2127
00:51:17.361 --> 00:51:18.194
I mean,

2128
00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:18.650
if it was,

2129
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:19.483
they say,

2130
00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:20.051
Jason tells me,

2131
00:51:20.051 --> 00:51:20.391
he says,

2132
00:51:20.391 --> 00:51:22.070
first goes your legs,

2133
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.791
then your body,

2134
00:51:22.791 --> 00:51:23.624
then your mind.

2135
00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:24.290
Yeah.

2136
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:25.520
I mean you see it.

2137
00:51:25.521 --> 00:51:26.960
I mean all fighters do that.

2138
00:51:26.961 --> 00:51:27.141
I mean,

2139
00:51:27.141 --> 00:51:28.370
thank God my legs are gone.

2140
00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.700
Thank God my body's gone because my head is still here.

2141
00:51:31.701 --> 00:51:35.270
So now it's time to use my head and said of my body and my damn legs anymore.

2142
00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:36.860
Did you ever get to,

2143
00:51:36.861 --> 00:51:37.191
I mean,

2144
00:51:37.191 --> 00:51:40.190
I remember on my brief time a kickboxing,

2145
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:43.850
there was moments I would lay in bed at nine and a half fucking headaches and

2146
00:51:43.851 --> 00:51:46.280
I'd be sitting there with my head is throbbing going,

2147
00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:47.630
what the fuck am I doing?

2148
00:51:47.631 --> 00:51:48.560
Am I head right now?

2149
00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:49.610
Like what is the,

2150
00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.190
did you ever wonder about like,

2151
00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.090
what's the like where are you at?

2152
00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.230
Like what's the tally?

2153
00:51:54.231 --> 00:51:54.561
What do you,

2154
00:51:54.561 --> 00:51:55.220
Oh,

2155
00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:56.053
you know what I mean?

2156
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:57.351
No,

2157
00:51:57.351 --> 00:51:57.651
you know,

2158
00:51:57.651 --> 00:51:58.100
I,

2159
00:51:58.100 --> 00:51:58.341
you know,

2160
00:51:58.341 --> 00:51:59.840
I always felt like I was smoking weed.

2161
00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:00.963
Try Smart.

2162
00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:02.331
Just like dizzy,

2163
00:52:02.331 --> 00:52:03.164
silly,

2164
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:04.123
silly film.

2165
00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:06.470
People say some silly shit after they spar.

2166
00:52:06.471 --> 00:52:06.980
Like,

2167
00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:10.400
like sometimes the funniest conversations you get in with guys who just got done

2168
00:52:10.401 --> 00:52:13.020
sparring and then they go eat every day.

2169
00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:15.140
Like hammered.

2170
00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:15.771
No,

2171
00:52:15.771 --> 00:52:16.251
seriously.

2172
00:52:16.251 --> 00:52:17.460
That's what they called punchdrunk.

2173
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:17.590
I,

2174
00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:18.410
yeah.

2175
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:19.850
Well sort of,

2176
00:52:19.851 --> 00:52:21.600
but that's a different field.

2177
00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:25.100
That's like a sort of a post workout posts getting punched in the head,

2178
00:52:25.101 --> 00:52:26.610
feeling your adrenaline is rushing,

2179
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:27.320
you got cracked.

2180
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.131
Some good shots.

2181
00:52:28.131 --> 00:52:28.964
He kind of get that.

2182
00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:31.850
I ain't even tasting her mouth or like blood.

2183
00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:32.391
Yeah.

2184
00:52:32.391 --> 00:52:34.550
The copper that doesn't teach you.

2185
00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:35.030
Um,

2186
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:36.080
did you ever like,

2187
00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:37.190
say like,

2188
00:52:37.191 --> 00:52:39.320
how many times can I fight?

2189
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:42.380
How many did you ever like try to like sit down and look at it and say

2190
00:52:42.381 --> 00:52:44.830
realistically how much damage there's,

2191
00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:45.830
cause we all know there's,

2192
00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:49.730
there's certain guys like even boxers that got out in time and you listened to

2193
00:52:49.731 --> 00:52:51.200
them talk and they're fine,

2194
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.920
you know,

2195
00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:52.940
they have no problems at all.

2196
00:52:52.941 --> 00:52:53.571
But that was my thing.

2197
00:52:53.571 --> 00:52:55.280
I never wanted to take too much abuse,

2198
00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:55.671
you know?

2199
00:52:55.671 --> 00:52:56.030
I mean,

2200
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.850
I think with Dell's zone,

2201
00:52:56.850 --> 00:52:57.950
it's a really hurt me.

2202
00:52:58.610 --> 00:52:58.971
Literally.

2203
00:52:58.971 --> 00:53:02.420
I mean Vandelay Silva who was one punched when our title five when we fought

2204
00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:04.820
that made me felt like the world upside what?

2205
00:53:04.821 --> 00:53:05.570
Upside down.

2206
00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:06.403
Um,

2207
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:07.191
chuck caught me,

2208
00:53:07.191 --> 00:53:08.000
you know,

2209
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.590
in their first fight with some good,

2210
00:53:09.591 --> 00:53:10.520
a couple of good shots,

2211
00:53:10.521 --> 00:53:11.181
two good shots,

2212
00:53:11.181 --> 00:53:12.500
a good right hand and good left hook.

2213
00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:13.850
And uh,

2214
00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:15.260
it just feels like your legs could dropped.

2215
00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:16.820
Your legs come out from under you.

2216
00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:17.800
If they stop working,

2217
00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:18.391
stop working.

2218
00:53:18.391 --> 00:53:18.591
It just,

2219
00:53:18.591 --> 00:53:19.424
everything goes.

2220
00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:20.181
I mean,

2221
00:53:20.181 --> 00:53:21.530
I'd never been out of unconscious ever.

2222
00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.070
My career,

2223
00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:22.341
you know,

2224
00:53:22.341 --> 00:53:23.780
I think rampage and won't respond.

2225
00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:26.010
Maybe see some twinkle bells where everything felt

2226
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:26.610
<v 4>like has been there.</v>

2227
00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:26.990
Like,

2228
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.120
Oh,

2229
00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.640
this is been here before.

2230
00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:29.820
Wait a second,

2231
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:31.200
I'm not been here before to move.

2232
00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:31.980
Right.

2233
00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:32.813
But I mean,

2234
00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:33.121
I,

2235
00:53:33.121 --> 00:53:36.740
I've never been unconscious where I'm on the ground and wake up feeling whole

2236
00:53:36.741 --> 00:53:36.940
or,

2237
00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:37.151
or,

2238
00:53:37.151 --> 00:53:37.380
well,

2239
00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:38.213
well it happened.

2240
00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:39.770
Thank God it doesn't,

2241
00:53:39.771 --> 00:53:40.080
ah,

2242
00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.180
that's some scary shit.

2243
00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:42.240
That's some scary shit.

2244
00:53:42.241 --> 00:53:42.421
You know,

2245
00:53:42.421 --> 00:53:44.100
I've been able to get up right after like boom.

2246
00:53:44.101 --> 00:53:44.430
You know,

2247
00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:44.930
like I said,

2248
00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:46.020
the first time you and Chuck Fahd,

2249
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.400
I poked around on my feet.

2250
00:53:47.401 --> 00:53:49.860
I was fine and the judge is trying to keep me down.

2251
00:53:49.861 --> 00:53:50.190
I was like,

2252
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:51.120
get the fuck away from me.

2253
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:52.380
Let me stand on my feet,

2254
00:53:52.381 --> 00:53:53.214
get away from me.

2255
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:54.020
You know,

2256
00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:54.841
I'm a little embarrassed,

2257
00:53:54.841 --> 00:53:55.501
but same time,

2258
00:53:55.501 --> 00:53:58.240
it's just that most things as fighters and his men,

2259
00:53:58.241 --> 00:53:58.520
you do,

2260
00:53:58.520 --> 00:53:59.820
you don't want to be in that position.

2261
00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:00.843
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2262
00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:04.660
But then there's still didn't want to accept losing to lose.

2263
00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:04.881
No,

2264
00:54:04.881 --> 00:54:05.714
it just happened.

2265
00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:06.131
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2266
00:54:06.131 --> 00:54:07.480
I mean people don't understand.

2267
00:54:07.481 --> 00:54:08.650
I mean as a fighter,

2268
00:54:09.070 --> 00:54:10.470
I mean that hard as a fighter.

2269
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:11.151
When I lose,

2270
00:54:11.151 --> 00:54:12.160
it's like a loved one died.

2271
00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:13.830
That's how much pain it is.

2272
00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:15.280
Just like it sucks everything

2273
00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:17.980
fighting the soap,

2274
00:54:17.981 --> 00:54:20.260
lonely and people don't understand it unless you're a fighter.

2275
00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:21.101
They only,

2276
00:54:21.101 --> 00:54:24.910
the loneliest feeling there is no growth is laying in bed before a fight and

2277
00:54:24.911 --> 00:54:25.300
going,

2278
00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:26.860
you had to go out there and fight.

2279
00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:28.840
You got to put on a show.

2280
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:33.430
You gotta make it fun for the fans that watch and everything lies on you.

2281
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:35.500
There's no one that could save you.

2282
00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:38.050
There's no one that could boost you.

2283
00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.360
There's no one that can help you throw punches.

2284
00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:42.580
There's no one that can help take a guy down.

2285
00:54:42.790 --> 00:54:44.560
It's only you by yourself.

2286
00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:45.850
And there could be your family,

2287
00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:46.661
wives,

2288
00:54:46.661 --> 00:54:47.620
girlfriends,

2289
00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:48.641
brothers,

2290
00:54:48.641 --> 00:54:49.241
sisters,

2291
00:54:49.241 --> 00:54:49.770
dads,

2292
00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:50.980
mother's going,

2293
00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:51.610
good luck.

2294
00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:52.450
Kick some ass.

2295
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:55.330
That's as far as it goes right there it goes.

2296
00:54:55.331 --> 00:54:56.164
No further than that.

2297
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:58.540
You're the one that got to get in the gym and train every day.

2298
00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:00.400
You're the one that gets to push yourself in spine,

2299
00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:01.930
do the extra drilling,

2300
00:55:01.931 --> 00:55:03.100
do all these extra things.

2301
00:55:03.101 --> 00:55:03.934
And you know,

2302
00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:07.360
I never really understood it until I started working with Jason Pro and he

2303
00:55:07.361 --> 00:55:07.941
explained it to me.

2304
00:55:07.941 --> 00:55:08.141
He goes,

2305
00:55:08.141 --> 00:55:08.560
man,

2306
00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.820
isn't this a lonely sport?

2307
00:55:09.821 --> 00:55:10.210
And I was like,

2308
00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:11.043
fuck,

2309
00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:12.700
I never heard of that way.

2310
00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.200
But yes it is ma'am

2311
00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:15.101
<v 1>lonely.</v>

2312
00:55:15.101 --> 00:55:20.101
But it all comes back into that one gigantic moment of the exact opposite of

2313
00:55:21.641 --> 00:55:22.061
lonely.

2314
00:55:22.061 --> 00:55:22.894
When you win,

2315
00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:23.860
when you win,

2316
00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:25.240
everybody wants to be your best friend.

2317
00:55:25.241 --> 00:55:26.590
Everybody wants to be a part of the joy.

2318
00:55:26.591 --> 00:55:27.580
And not only that,

2319
00:55:27.581 --> 00:55:29.510
the moment that you actually win,

2320
00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:31.150
like when you tap Ryan Bader,

2321
00:55:31.151 --> 00:55:31.781
let me tell you something,

2322
00:55:31.781 --> 00:55:31.960
man,

2323
00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:34.930
that was about as happy as I've ever seen you because you had gone through a

2324
00:55:34.931 --> 00:55:38.930
drought for a few years and it's like you wanted that w and when you tagged them

2325
00:55:38.931 --> 00:55:42.430
and you dropped him and you grabbed a hold of that neck and pulled guard and

2326
00:55:42.431 --> 00:55:44.410
fucking crushed it and he tapped,

2327
00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:44.981
dude,

2328
00:55:44.981 --> 00:55:45.880
you were so happy.

2329
00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:47.000
You jumped up

2330
00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:52.680
<v 4>watching discovery channel and you see a lion chasing a gazelle and trying to</v>

2331
00:55:53.261 --> 00:55:58.060
eat for the first time it was life [inaudible] I was at lion is finally got it.

2332
00:55:58.090 --> 00:55:59.380
Fucking finally got it.

2333
00:55:59.381 --> 00:56:01.960
I Limor lock in my hands and I was working with producer server doing at the

2334
00:56:01.961 --> 00:56:04.110
time and I remember just hooking it,

2335
00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:08.970
the guillotine wrap one leg the other leg over and we're just thinking producer

2336
00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:09.520
goes,

2337
00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:12.030
keep her elbow down to you whenever you get the guilt and keep bro.

2338
00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:15.130
But then I kept my old down and I just squeezed everything together and it

2339
00:56:15.131 --> 00:56:18.310
wasn't the fact of pulling his head towards me or my body towards me who just

2340
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.790
doing a crunch and is crunching everything together,

2341
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:23.290
Russian at all,

2342
00:56:23.291 --> 00:56:25.020
squeezing the shit out of it.

2343
00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:26.810
I remember it.

2344
00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:29.880
I'm not like going to the reference me off cause I'm not going through something

2345
00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:32.380
where he didn't tap or the referee has written me off.

2346
00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:34.420
And I remember and three,

2347
00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:37.840
three days before that I did the ultimate fighter with Michael Bisbing and all

2348
00:56:37.841 --> 00:56:38.651
the guys were on the show.

2349
00:56:38.651 --> 00:56:39.340
They're like,

2350
00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:39.671
Tito,

2351
00:56:39.671 --> 00:56:39.910
man,

2352
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:40.870
please do the grave digger.

2353
00:56:40.871 --> 00:56:41.800
Please do the greater good for.

2354
00:56:41.801 --> 00:56:42.634
Show us how you do it.

2355
00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:43.451
I was like,

2356
00:56:43.451 --> 00:56:44.270
no,

2357
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:48.040
wait until this weekend because when I dropped Bader and I'm going to drop him,

2358
00:56:48.041 --> 00:56:49.300
I'm going to beat him and we'll do something.

2359
00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:50.021
Whatever I do,

2360
00:56:50.021 --> 00:56:51.370
but when I get it done,

2361
00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:52.730
I'll do the grand Duke of free guys.

2362
00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:55.840
Crazy that that was the only the second submission in your career.

2363
00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:56.920
It really is crazy

2364
00:56:57.090 --> 00:56:59.460
<v 0>because I always tell people you have a very underrated ground game.</v>

2365
00:56:59.461 --> 00:57:01.710
When you pulled that triangle off on Machida.

2366
00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:02.430
I was like,

2367
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:03.720
Oh shit.

2368
00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:05.790
Like that was a wrinkle that a lot.

2369
00:57:05.791 --> 00:57:06.180
Look,

2370
00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:07.560
there's a lot of dominant dudes,

2371
00:57:07.561 --> 00:57:10.470
top dominant especially that don't have that wrinkle in their game.

2372
00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:11.830
They don't have that aspect again.

2373
00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:13.800
You lock that thing up fucking sweet.

2374
00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:15.180
And if it wasn't Machida,

2375
00:57:15.210 --> 00:57:17.700
if it wasn't a real Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt,

2376
00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:18.810
you would have had that shit.

2377
00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:22.630
You went for a tumble with it for the arm too.

2378
00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:23.810
<v 4>And that was my,</v>

2379
00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:24.830
that was my mess up.

2380
00:57:24.831 --> 00:57:25.190
Um,

2381
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.640
you know,

2382
00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:26.421
when we drill,

2383
00:57:26.421 --> 00:57:29.560
I draw the triangle there from a triangle I go for and bar.

2384
00:57:29.561 --> 00:57:32.090
Cause the guy pulls away and I blew it by doing that.

2385
00:57:32.091 --> 00:57:33.230
I probably should have never did that.

2386
00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:35.980
I should have stayed at the triangle the whole time and all the time.

2387
00:57:35.981 --> 00:57:37.490
But I have to catch guys now and triangles,

2388
00:57:37.491 --> 00:57:41.240
I just make sure I hold onto it and don't let go.

2389
00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:43.460
And I know now to grab onto my shin.

2390
00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:45.350
Don't let anything else go to grab your Shin,

2391
00:57:45.351 --> 00:57:46.850
just hold on and wait the guy out.

2392
00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.340
And so for you to Gable grip around the back of the head,

2393
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:50.600
pulling that you pull the neck,

2394
00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:53.270
can't handle it after a certain point in time.

2395
00:57:53.271 --> 00:57:53.501
You,

2396
00:57:53.501 --> 00:57:53.691
you,

2397
00:57:53.691 --> 00:57:54.081
you have to,

2398
00:57:54.081 --> 00:57:54.500
you have,

2399
00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:57.440
there's a guy from Brazil that I moved out here who teaches on my school at

2400
00:57:57.441 --> 00:58:00.280
punishment train and Senator Ricardo a Bruin and we'd go over that stuff.

2401
00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:00.900
He was like Tito,

2402
00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:01.733
like promise.

2403
00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:02.091
Oh,

2404
00:58:02.091 --> 00:58:02.924
Cyborg.

2405
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:03.900
You know,

2406
00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:04.753
Ricardo Abreu,

2407
00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:06.133
he's three now.

2408
00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:08.330
Right now he's an 85 pounds and he's an up and coming kid.

2409
00:58:08.331 --> 00:58:11.180
He's 26 years old and he's amazing.

2410
00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:11.841
Amazing.

2411
00:58:11.841 --> 00:58:12.231
Who's that?

2412
00:58:12.231 --> 00:58:14.150
So there's a Bruce Cyborg or brew,

2413
00:58:14.151 --> 00:58:14.981
you know what I'm talking about?

2414
00:58:14.981 --> 00:58:15.950
Presumes you just a guy.

2415
00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:17.150
I think he might be,

2416
00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:18.940
I think it's the same last year I had no,

2417
00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:19.430
um,

2418
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.670
yeah,

2419
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:20.240
same last name,

2420
00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:20.700
but this kid,

2421
00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:21.531
he's an up and comer.

2422
00:58:21.531 --> 00:58:21.981
He's three now.

2423
00:58:21.981 --> 00:58:22.670
He's amazing.

2424
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:23.050
Um,

2425
00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:25.250
try to give them a file in the next strike for strike force card.

2426
00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:28.820
But he's still got good former fights until the GFC status.

2427
00:58:28.821 --> 00:58:30.890
I think it just needs to build his confidence a little bit,

2428
00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:32.151
but it's just one of those things,

2429
00:58:32.151 --> 00:58:32.421
like I say,

2430
00:58:32.421 --> 00:58:32.601
man,

2431
00:58:32.601 --> 00:58:34.550
you get those submissions and you do it over and over again.

2432
00:58:34.610 --> 00:58:38.750
You used to just making sure you don't make the same mistakes twice and my whole

2433
00:58:38.751 --> 00:58:39.584
life and never done that.

2434
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:42.890
Trying to make the same mistakes more than once.

2435
00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:43.520
There's some,

2436
00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:46.550
there's so few guys that are big guys and have a strong guard,

2437
00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:46.881
you know,

2438
00:58:46.881 --> 00:58:49.160
for every four Breeshia over doom is a,

2439
00:58:49.161 --> 00:58:49.401
you know,

2440
00:58:49.401 --> 00:58:52.330
a hundred guys that turtles when they put them on their back and it's just,

2441
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:54.230
and when I went to Abu Dhabi was when I started learning,

2442
00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:54.500
you know,

2443
00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:55.221
I started realizing,

2444
00:58:55.221 --> 00:58:56.270
I mean I was a wrestler.

2445
00:58:56.271 --> 00:58:57.980
I mean I don't go into my back.

2446
00:58:57.981 --> 00:59:02.180
It took me a good two years to see what comfortable to be okay to go to my back.

2447
00:59:02.181 --> 00:59:03.014
I'd be okay with it.

2448
00:59:03.350 --> 00:59:05.810
But it was one of those things that when I first started fighting,

2449
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:07.760
I was going to my back.

2450
00:59:07.790 --> 00:59:09.140
The guys weren't taking me down.

2451
00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:09.681
No Way.

2452
00:59:09.681 --> 00:59:10.520
I was defending,

2453
00:59:10.521 --> 00:59:11.354
defending.

2454
00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:12.910
But then you get a little lazy when started,

2455
00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:13.940
you started going,

2456
00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:14.411
okay,

2457
00:59:14.411 --> 00:59:15.244
I'll pull garden.

2458
00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.110
I teach my guys now don't pull guard.

2459
00:59:18.111 --> 00:59:19.130
And that's the least.

2460
00:59:19.131 --> 00:59:20.240
That's the last thing you guys,

2461
00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:22.160
what do you do if can't take a guy down

2462
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.500
<v 1>though and the guy's fucking you up kickboxing,</v>

2463
00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:25.580
then pull guard.

2464
00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:28.230
<v 4>You better be fucking tough.</v>

2465
00:59:29.550 --> 00:59:32.000
<v 1>You pulled guard guard,</v>

2466
00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:33.690
he got smashy on top.

2467
00:59:33.691 --> 00:59:33.841
Well,

2468
00:59:33.841 --> 00:59:36.930
this guys who you can't do that to like look at that Paul Sass guy.

2469
00:59:36.931 --> 00:59:38.550
You'd watch that kid out of Great Britain.

2470
00:59:38.610 --> 00:59:39.190
Not yet.

2471
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:41.100
Ooze triangles are nasty.

2472
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:46.000
I think he's got eight or nine wins by triangle and he just catches everybody

2473
00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:48.000
just caught Jacob Volkman with a triangle.

2474
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:49.770
But I mean you getting that motherfucker's guard,

2475
00:59:49.771 --> 00:59:50.604
you're in quicksand.

2476
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:52.640
<v 4>If someone fights him,</v>

2477
00:59:52.850 --> 00:59:56.660
give me an opportunity and I'll show you a defense for a triangle that everybody

2478
00:59:56.690 --> 00:59:57.210
can get out.

2479
00:59:57.210 --> 00:59:59.120
<v 1>I just love watching the Chicago.</v>

2480
00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:00.061
Really.

2481
01:00:00.061 --> 01:00:00.281
It's,

2482
01:00:00.281 --> 01:00:00.541
it's a,

2483
01:00:00.541 --> 01:00:01.081
you can get,

2484
01:00:01.081 --> 01:00:01.440
I mean,

2485
01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.390
someone could lock a triangle on you and you're going to get out.

2486
01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:06.500
Is that that core sort of role or your role towards where the foot is locked?

2487
01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.890
<v 4>I had to do is I put em right hand goes on top of the Shim.</v>

2488
01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.710
Lefthand comes on top of that and I'd do a tripod,

2489
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:13.310
right.

2490
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:14.140
Uh,

2491
01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:17.270
put the knee down and literally his legs open up

2492
01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:18.890
<v 1>realize has no choice to get it.</v>

2493
01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:20.750
I want to see you try that on for a over doom.

2494
01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:22.350
I buy works really.

2495
01:00:22.351 --> 01:00:22.510
I,

2496
01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:24.140
it'll work off of recent works off DC.

2497
01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:24.540
All right,

2498
01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:25.500
I got to see that man.

2499
01:00:25.501 --> 01:00:26.100
I get to see.

2500
01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:26.933
It's amazing.

2501
01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:27.331
It's good.

2502
01:00:27.331 --> 01:00:28.164
Good Shit.

2503
01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.320
It's mad isn't what on them.

2504
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:31.703
That's a good sheriff for you,

2505
01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.553
Brian.

2506
01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:35.610
Styling dangerous.

2507
01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:37.533
How much,

2508
01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:41.490
when you were a in the middle of a training for fights and then you know,

2509
01:00:41.491 --> 01:00:42.510
the fight would be over,

2510
01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.390
how much time would you spend like working on your skills?

2511
01:00:45.391 --> 01:00:47.910
We just make constantly making sure you're always in shape.

2512
01:00:47.911 --> 01:00:48.180
Like,

2513
01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:48.870
um,

2514
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:51.060
did you have a set thing that you did?

2515
01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:51.980
Well,

2516
01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:53.630
I would take a month off always.

2517
01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:54.720
I'm always taking a month off.

2518
01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:57.510
Just loud and Jorma enjoy yourself

2519
01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:58.180
<v 4>myself.</v>

2520
01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:59.530
It was because I was,

2521
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:01.780
when I started wrestling in high school,

2522
01:01:01.781 --> 01:01:02.400
that was my deal.

2523
01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.910
I would go through a whole season of wrestling.

2524
01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:08.130
Someone would start and right before actually right at right and for summer

2525
01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:08.651
first started,

2526
01:01:08.651 --> 01:01:10.540
we'd have a freestyle wrestling.

2527
01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:12.070
And during freestyle,

2528
01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:12.371
you know,

2529
01:01:12.371 --> 01:01:14.770
for the first month I would work really hard.

2530
01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:16.060
And then as soon as I was over,

2531
01:01:16.330 --> 01:01:18.250
I'd have a month and a half to chip for school started.

2532
01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:19.300
All right.

2533
01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:19.881
I get the party,

2534
01:01:19.881 --> 01:01:20.441
I get the drink,

2535
01:01:20.441 --> 01:01:21.520
have fun with my friends.

2536
01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.590
And then as soon as school started again wrestling and started,

2537
01:01:23.591 --> 01:01:24.424
so I couldn't drink.

2538
01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:24.940
I couldn't,

2539
01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:27.400
I had to stick with school and I had to get good grades so I,

2540
01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:28.271
I would do that.

2541
01:01:28.271 --> 01:01:30.910
So I followed her right into college and I got into college.

2542
01:01:30.911 --> 01:01:31.744
He did the same thing.

2543
01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:33.100
When I got into fighting,

2544
01:01:33.101 --> 01:01:36.940
I did the same thing as soon as the fight was over at a party of my friends and

2545
01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.580
for the first month and as soon as that month was over,

2546
01:01:39.581 --> 01:01:39.851
okay,

2547
01:01:39.851 --> 01:01:40.684
there's my date,

2548
01:01:40.810 --> 01:01:42.490
I'd have a contract sign for another fight.

2549
01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:43.390
And I started trying to,

2550
01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:45.810
<v 1>did you feel more pressure at once it became the champ?</v>

2551
01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:46.883
Yes.

2552
01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:49.980
That's like the walls were closing in and that's when all the contenders were

2553
01:01:49.981 --> 01:01:50.814
running at Ya.

2554
01:01:53.350 --> 01:01:53.750
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2555
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:54.100
Yeah.

2556
01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:54.841
It came down to that,

2557
01:01:54.841 --> 01:01:56.130
but I always wanted to learn.

2558
01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.630
I was always going out to learn.

2559
01:01:57.631 --> 01:01:57.841
You know,

2560
01:01:57.841 --> 01:01:59.470
I'd go out to John Lewis is a,

2561
01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:01.890
I got work with all different guys all the time.

2562
01:02:01.891 --> 01:02:02.310
I,

2563
01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:03.001
I wanted to learn.

2564
01:02:03.001 --> 01:02:03.181
I mean,

2565
01:02:03.181 --> 01:02:06.570
that's be one thing I can say to guys who are listening who are fighters is

2566
01:02:06.571 --> 01:02:07.440
don't ever stop learning.

2567
01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:11.250
Don't ever think just because you're with one school that you can't go with

2568
01:02:11.251 --> 01:02:12.084
other guys and learn.

2569
01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:15.570
Because when your coach says you can't do that and that coach not right for you,

2570
01:02:16.050 --> 01:02:16.440
you know,

2571
01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.090
cause if you're not learning enough and your gym,

2572
01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.620
you're only as good as the guys you're with.

2573
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.170
You got to go out and you learn from others

2574
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:21.550
<v 1>guys,</v>

2575
01:02:21.550 --> 01:02:24.330
it's hard to learn new shit in and try it on fights.

2576
01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:25.200
Yes.

2577
01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:25.441
Right.

2578
01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:25.950
Because a,

2579
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:26.280
you know,

2580
01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:30.240
you're worried about doing something where you're not like your double your

2581
01:02:30.241 --> 01:02:31.074
grounded pound,

2582
01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.040
that Shit's in your head.

2583
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:33.360
It's cement.

2584
01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:34.753
It's not going anywhere.

2585
01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:36.090
I get a guy against a fence,

2586
01:02:36.091 --> 01:02:36.750
I'm taking them down.

2587
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:37.080
Right.

2588
01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.270
But jumping to arm bar on somebody,

2589
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.930
it's like,

2590
01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:40.291
fuck,

2591
01:02:40.291 --> 01:02:41.400
should I really be doing this?

2592
01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:44.530
Am I going to give a one position for another position right now?

2593
01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:45.060
No,

2594
01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.080
I probably shouldn't do that.

2595
01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:47.640
But it was just one of those things,

2596
01:02:47.641 --> 01:02:47.871
you know?

2597
01:02:47.871 --> 01:02:48.540
Um,

2598
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.340
I got set in mind

2599
01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:49.760
<v 4>ways,</v>

2600
01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:50.221
you know,

2601
01:02:50.221 --> 01:02:50.480
um,

2602
01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.313
I got comfortable,

2603
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:51.831
you know,

2604
01:02:51.831 --> 01:02:52.430
I,

2605
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:53.300
the guys I trained with,

2606
01:02:53.301 --> 01:02:55.120
I would bring guys around me and I,

2607
01:02:55.121 --> 01:02:55.301
you know,

2608
01:02:55.301 --> 01:02:56.450
I started teen punishment.

2609
01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.081
We first started,

2610
01:02:57.081 --> 01:02:57.650
it was,

2611
01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:58.100
you know,

2612
01:02:58.100 --> 01:02:59.210
Rico Rodriguez,

2613
01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:00.680
rampage myself,

2614
01:03:00.681 --> 01:03:00.891
look,

2615
01:03:00.891 --> 01:03:01.724
Dell,

2616
01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:02.653
um,

2617
01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.150
peaky rob Fabiana he,

2618
01:03:05.151 --> 01:03:06.550
Hi John Louis.

2619
01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:06.701
<v 1>I mean,</v>

2620
01:03:06.701 --> 01:03:07.570
there was so many guys.

2621
01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:08.680
There's a name from the past.

2622
01:03:08.681 --> 01:03:09.860
Fabiano Yhonnie

2623
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.823
<v 4>all right.</v>

2624
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:12.570
A guy turned out to be a scumbag to,

2625
01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:13.523
um,

2626
01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:14.920
it was just one of those things,

2627
01:03:14.921 --> 01:03:15.161
man,

2628
01:03:15.161 --> 01:03:18.160
that you just kind of look at that you just tried to bring the best guys around

2629
01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:18.490
you.

2630
01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:21.760
And when I didn't have the best guys around me anymore,

2631
01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:22.271
I was like,

2632
01:03:22.271 --> 01:03:22.600
all right,

2633
01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.660
well I'll just get the guys that I need that I thought I needed at the time,

2634
01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.130
you know?

2635
01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:26.640
Um,

2636
01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.290
<v 1>did you run all your camps?</v>

2637
01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:29.940
Did you have a head trainer ever?

2638
01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:30.781
Did you always,

2639
01:03:30.781 --> 01:03:32.070
I'll always had a head trainer.

2640
01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:32.581
Always,

2641
01:03:32.581 --> 01:03:32.940
always,

2642
01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:34.110
always had a head trainer,

2643
01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:36.150
a guy who always told us what we needed to do.

2644
01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:37.013
I always did that.

2645
01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:37.201
I mean,

2646
01:03:37.201 --> 01:03:38.030
there was,

2647
01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:38.270
uh,

2648
01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:38.520
you know,

2649
01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.960
a couple of times that I,

2650
01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:44.880
I had to do things myself just because of my injuries after the couture fight.

2651
01:03:44.881 --> 01:03:48.000
There were so many injuries that came back to back to back to back that were

2652
01:03:48.001 --> 01:03:49.800
always guiding around things to make it,

2653
01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:50.970
make the right things happen.

2654
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:51.271
Well,

2655
01:03:51.271 --> 01:03:56.271
it's also got to be very hard for you to develop any sort of a real relationship

2656
01:03:56.341 --> 01:03:57.660
with a head trainer because you,

2657
01:03:57.661 --> 01:04:01.440
you really were a part of the whole transitionary phase of mixed martial arts.

2658
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:03.480
Even being recognized as a support.

2659
01:04:03.481 --> 01:04:05.220
I mean in 97 when you first did it,

2660
01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.240
it was,

2661
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.120
I was there,

2662
01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:07.540
man,

2663
01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:12.360
we were in the fucking middle of nowhere and it was a weird half fold gymnasium.

2664
01:04:12.361 --> 01:04:17.361
And so to get up professional like real head coach,

2665
01:04:18.031 --> 01:04:19.770
like it's almost like you've got to train them.

2666
01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:21.780
How many guys were there?

2667
01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:22.000
There?

2668
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.360
I mean there was two really good guys.

2669
01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:25.194
I mean there was,

2670
01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:28.530
it was funny cause w back in the day there was a kickbox and trainer,

2671
01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:28.680
though I

2672
01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.240
<v 4>would use John Spencer,</v>

2673
01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.860
there's a ground guy that I would use.

2674
01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:32.903
Uh,

2675
01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.960
um,

2676
01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:34.793
John Lobur.

2677
01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:35.813
Um,

2678
01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.470
and I would do the wrestling,

2679
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:38.170
you know,

2680
01:04:38.170 --> 01:04:38.550
I mean,

2681
01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:40.980
I can't recall dress and saw my restaurant him that we just drilled.

2682
01:04:40.981 --> 01:04:41.814
We draw all the time.

2683
01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:43.830
And then as I got a little bit better,

2684
01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:44.041
our,

2685
01:04:44.041 --> 01:04:47.690
excuse me was I read a file upon my world title and train would call it on Yama.

2686
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.510
Um,

2687
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:50.760
who was a kickboxing trainer and uh,

2688
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:52.290
I'd have Fabiani had,

2689
01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:53.250
we'd do a Jujitsu,

2690
01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:53.790
um,

2691
01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:56.970
Rico Rodriguez Doroty Jitsu rampage and spiral.

2692
01:04:56.971 --> 01:04:58.440
It's a lot of times we had great sparring,

2693
01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:59.970
great rom wrestling,

2694
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.590
some of the guys in the college and so forth.

2695
01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:02.980
And then about what,

2696
01:05:02.981 --> 01:05:03.780
when I fought,

2697
01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:04.320
um,

2698
01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.153
who was it?

2699
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.610
Uh,

2700
01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:06.443
Vito Belfort,

2701
01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:07.680
um,

2702
01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.030
being Colin didn't get along.

2703
01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:10.140
There were some things back,

2704
01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:11.040
back and forth.

2705
01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:11.850
Uh,

2706
01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:13.170
due to rampage.

2707
01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:16.020
I'm rampage was in his ear saying Shit and saying,

2708
01:05:16.021 --> 01:05:16.141
Oh,

2709
01:05:16.141 --> 01:05:17.170
you could be Tito then.

2710
01:05:17.171 --> 01:05:18.040
It was never about that mean

2711
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.630
<v 5>rampage were always good friends.</v>

2712
01:05:19.631 --> 01:05:19.901
And,

2713
01:05:19.901 --> 01:05:20.734
uh,

2714
01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:24.730
it just got to think to personal between me and Collin.

2715
01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:25.360
Um,

2716
01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:30.220
so salsa lease came about because of a regret trans great trainer.

2717
01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:34.450
He was one of the guys who pretty much invent the MMA training game.

2718
01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:38.290
He was the first guy to do it and the other guys caught onto is when we did the

2719
01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:39.124
ultimate fighter.

2720
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:40.420
That's when people have caught onto it.

2721
01:05:40.421 --> 01:05:43.450
When I can't have him come in and and do the ultimate fighter and season three

2722
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:44.583
and what that was.

2723
01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:49.300
That was a great time for you to man because people really got to see how much

2724
01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:52.300
attention and how much focus you put on coaching kids.

2725
01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.400
This is such a direct contrast.

2726
01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.960
My friend Tate was on that season.

2727
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.281
All right,

2728
01:05:56.281 --> 01:05:57.114
on Tate Fletcher.

2729
01:05:57.650 --> 01:06:00.470
Unfortunately it was up 10 shamrock stag and a,

2730
01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:01.930
he's like Ken Shamrock,

2731
01:06:01.931 --> 01:06:03.650
like barely fucking paid attention to that.

2732
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:06.340
I came from a wrestling background.

2733
01:06:06.341 --> 01:06:08.410
I mean if any collegiate wrestlers are out there and you know,

2734
01:06:08.411 --> 01:06:11.230
you guys got coaches wrestling's a family,

2735
01:06:11.350 --> 01:06:11.591
you know,

2736
01:06:11.591 --> 01:06:12.311
it's a family.

2737
01:06:12.311 --> 01:06:15.130
It's not just about coming in and training.

2738
01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:15.521
It's,

2739
01:06:15.521 --> 01:06:15.910
you know,

2740
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:17.080
you're okay with your girlfriend,

2741
01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:17.321
you know,

2742
01:06:17.321 --> 01:06:18.460
you're okay with your friends,

2743
01:06:18.461 --> 01:06:19.510
you're okay with your family.

2744
01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.040
That was my family.

2745
01:06:21.041 --> 01:06:22.240
My family was wrestling.

2746
01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:23.650
That's what saved me was wrestling,

2747
01:06:23.651 --> 01:06:24.310
you know,

2748
01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:25.390
wrestling saves lives.

2749
01:06:25.391 --> 01:06:27.400
And so you were bringing everybody together.

2750
01:06:27.790 --> 01:06:28.750
Everything was always,

2751
01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:29.021
always,

2752
01:06:29.021 --> 01:06:30.020
always a family deal.

2753
01:06:30.021 --> 01:06:30.311
And you know,

2754
01:06:30.311 --> 01:06:31.750
and with a salsa least,

2755
01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:32.913
like I say,

2756
01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.800
he doesn't get as much credit as he does as he should.

2757
01:06:35.801 --> 01:06:36.251
I think,

2758
01:06:36.251 --> 01:06:36.460
uh,

2759
01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:40.120
cause he was one of the first guys to kind of start the MMA training game.

2760
01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:40.661
I think wine,

2761
01:06:40.661 --> 01:06:41.140
all of it.

2762
01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:42.760
I mean when I had the ultimate fighter,

2763
01:06:42.761 --> 01:06:43.390
you've seen all this stuff.

2764
01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:43.900
We did,

2765
01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:44.890
he did half the stuff,

2766
01:06:44.891 --> 01:06:45.151
you know,

2767
01:06:45.151 --> 01:06:45.984
he,

2768
01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:50.620
I just had the mentality to have them positive outlooks on things.

2769
01:06:50.621 --> 01:06:52.210
I would say to the guys to get them going,

2770
01:06:52.211 --> 01:06:55.450
to get them pushing forward to push harder in practice.

2771
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:58.210
And it wasn't like you guys better show are you guys are pussies.

2772
01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.500
You guys ain't going be a part of this.

2773
01:06:59.501 --> 01:07:00.281
And No,

2774
01:07:00.281 --> 01:07:00.581
it was like,

2775
01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:02.050
what did we need to do to make you guys better?

2776
01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:03.850
What do we need to do to make this better?

2777
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:08.560
What can I be on a positive influence to you guys to make you guys love to be

2778
01:07:08.561 --> 01:07:09.160
here?

2779
01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:09.701
And they did.

2780
01:07:09.701 --> 01:07:09.911
You know,

2781
01:07:09.911 --> 01:07:10.930
you look at Kindle Grove,

2782
01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.910
you look at Michael Bisbing Hamill,

2783
01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.380
I mean these guys that came with from my team,

2784
01:07:14.381 --> 01:07:15.580
but they understood it.

2785
01:07:15.581 --> 01:07:15.761
You know,

2786
01:07:15.761 --> 01:07:17.710
bismuth now and he's a huge star.

2787
01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:19.083
He understood it.

2788
01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:19.391
I mean,

2789
01:07:19.391 --> 01:07:20.890
I was a couple of times I've pulled Bisbee around.

2790
01:07:20.891 --> 01:07:22.150
I go be the asshole dude.

2791
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:23.343
People hate you.

2792
01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:24.550
You're talking about you're right.

2793
01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:26.530
I think he gets it annoys him though.

2794
01:07:29.110 --> 01:07:29.970
He's getting paid.

2795
01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:30.490
Definitely.

2796
01:07:30.490 --> 01:07:31.990
And people got understand that you have people,

2797
01:07:31.991 --> 01:07:32.291
you know,

2798
01:07:32.291 --> 01:07:32.461
I,

2799
01:07:32.461 --> 01:07:33.760
I couldn't hear it enough.

2800
01:07:33.761 --> 01:07:38.260
Or Dana has stopped talking to fucking about money and I'm paying for my family.

2801
01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:39.550
I'm paying for my kids.

2802
01:07:39.551 --> 01:07:41.950
This is a business to me from day one.

2803
01:07:42.030 --> 01:07:43.550
This tells you to stop talking about money.

2804
01:07:43.551 --> 01:07:43.790
Yeah.

2805
01:07:43.790 --> 01:07:44.381
He always says that.

2806
01:07:44.381 --> 01:07:44.651
He said,

2807
01:07:44.651 --> 01:07:45.130
you need to talk,

2808
01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:45.341
talk,

2809
01:07:45.341 --> 01:07:45.890
talk about money.

2810
01:07:45.890 --> 01:07:46.810
Fans want to hear that.

2811
01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:48.310
And in fact your fans saying that,

2812
01:07:48.311 --> 01:07:48.500
oh,

2813
01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.050
she was talking about fucking money again.

2814
01:07:51.550 --> 01:07:52.690
What do you guys do for a living?

2815
01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:53.621
You know,

2816
01:07:53.621 --> 01:07:54.790
you guys get in the cage fighting.

2817
01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:55.580
You guys get in the gym,

2818
01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:55.960
training,

2819
01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:58.210
you guys get away from your family for three months at a time.

2820
01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:58.991
If Floyd Mayweather,

2821
01:07:58.991 --> 01:07:59.980
it wasn't talking about money,

2822
01:07:59.981 --> 01:08:01.110
I would think that something wrong with them.

2823
01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.170
Like check his temperature.

2824
01:08:02.410 --> 01:08:07.360
You might be sick is a smart cat when you're making $120 million on a fight,

2825
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.980
something right there.

2826
01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:09.813
I mean I,

2827
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:15.150
that's smart business and you look at del La Jolla and then the guy made almost

2828
01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:16.723
a billion dollars last year.

2829
01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:17.580
Pretty good.

2830
01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:20.660
These spiders doing different than us MMA fighters are doing.

2831
01:08:21.770 --> 01:08:25.670
Maybe I think we're kind of being there being businessmen and fighters are just

2832
01:08:25.671 --> 01:08:27.020
being fighters or excuse me,

2833
01:08:27.021 --> 01:08:28.340
those fighters just being fighters.

2834
01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:29.540
I'm being a businessman.

2835
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:30.041
I understand.

2836
01:08:30.041 --> 01:08:33.710
It says that some people though can't do that with their personality.

2837
01:08:33.711 --> 01:08:36.590
Their personality lends itself to competing and that's about it.

2838
01:08:36.591 --> 01:08:40.400
They like to be stone faced and stoic fade or like that their work do the

2839
01:08:40.401 --> 01:08:41.300
talking for them.

2840
01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.970
But for folks that don't understand,

2841
01:08:43.971 --> 01:08:45.110
like if you want to be,

2842
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:50.030
if you want to get paid attention to look when I go to the expos and uh,

2843
01:08:50.031 --> 01:08:50.241
you know,

2844
01:08:50.241 --> 01:08:50.481
when you're,

2845
01:08:50.481 --> 01:08:51.530
when you're signing,

2846
01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.660
I know that you're a fucking lines and longer than anybody's man sign up for

2847
01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:55.513
eight hours.

2848
01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:56.810
Meticulous.

2849
01:08:56.810 --> 01:08:57.890
Those lines of ridiculous.

2850
01:08:58.190 --> 01:08:59.270
I've watched that man.

2851
01:08:59.450 --> 01:09:01.550
And there's a certain amount of,

2852
01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:02.443
you know,

2853
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:03.770
entertainment to it.

2854
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:05.210
There's a show biz aspect to it.

2855
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:06.590
People have to appreciate,

2856
01:09:06.591 --> 01:09:07.424
I mean,

2857
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:08.930
I'm two different people,

2858
01:09:08.931 --> 01:09:09.350
man are,

2859
01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:09.891
I think,

2860
01:09:09.891 --> 01:09:10.170
you know,

2861
01:09:10.170 --> 01:09:11.780
I think maybe it was because when I was a kid,

2862
01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:14.240
I always wanted to be that person who had the buddy.

2863
01:09:14.241 --> 01:09:15.590
I want to be that kid who,

2864
01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:18.170
who was accepted in society.

2865
01:09:18.171 --> 01:09:20.020
I think you wanted to feel normal.

2866
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:21.440
I wanted to feel normal and I was,

2867
01:09:21.441 --> 01:09:24.380
was always dying for that normalcy and I'd never had it.

2868
01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:25.273
And uh,

2869
01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.110
that's the drive though,

2870
01:09:27.111 --> 01:09:27.290
right?

2871
01:09:27.290 --> 01:09:28.850
And that was the drive and that's what I looked.

2872
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:32.210
I can now and it was just all the fighters that come up now guys,

2873
01:09:32.211 --> 01:09:32.781
please,

2874
01:09:32.781 --> 01:09:33.410
if you're listening,

2875
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:33.981
please,

2876
01:09:33.981 --> 01:09:35.690
and I can explain this enough to you guys.

2877
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:37.220
This is a business.

2878
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.870
No more than that.

2879
01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.580
You come in and you bust your ass and in 15 years,

2880
01:09:43.581 --> 01:09:44.510
if you last that long,

2881
01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.120
you'll have a business in front of you that you be able to,

2882
01:09:47.690 --> 01:09:48.740
I made a clothing company,

2883
01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:50.090
I made a nutrition,

2884
01:09:50.091 --> 01:09:50.271
light,

2885
01:09:50.271 --> 01:09:50.631
punishment,

2886
01:09:50.631 --> 01:09:51.170
nutrition.

2887
01:09:51.170 --> 01:09:52.400
I was able to build a gym.

2888
01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:54.560
I was able to not just that,

2889
01:09:54.561 --> 01:09:56.930
but make my name a brand.

2890
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:59.240
I was thankful for Lorenzo Fertitta,

2891
01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:00.411
Frank Fertitta,

2892
01:10:00.411 --> 01:10:01.244
Dana White,

2893
01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:01.911
forgive me.

2894
01:10:01.911 --> 01:10:06.050
The opportunities that I've had through my career to expose the way I have of

2895
01:10:06.051 --> 01:10:06.531
myself.

2896
01:10:06.531 --> 01:10:09.590
But the way that to have that for that to happen was to have a good head on my

2897
01:10:09.591 --> 01:10:10.424
shoulders,

2898
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:12.710
to never step on anybody to get ahead.

2899
01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:13.611
And I think,

2900
01:10:13.611 --> 01:10:14.270
you know,

2901
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:15.230
God overlooks us.

2902
01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:15.471
You know,

2903
01:10:15.471 --> 01:10:15.960
like I said,

2904
01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:16.820
I got to go to church.

2905
01:10:16.821 --> 01:10:18.920
I don't believe all worship God,

2906
01:10:18.921 --> 01:10:20.300
you're the best person world because of that.

2907
01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:21.133
No.

2908
01:10:21.230 --> 01:10:25.190
How old will have open hands and help people around you and be respectful.

2909
01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:30.340
Don't step on people to get ahead and I really think good things will happen and

2910
01:10:30.351 --> 01:10:31.520
my whole career I look at it,

2911
01:10:31.521 --> 01:10:32.340
you know,

2912
01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:36.830
I could've made a a left or I could have made a right and I went the right way

2913
01:10:36.831 --> 01:10:38.110
and I'm thankful because of it.

2914
01:10:38.111 --> 01:10:38.330
You know,

2915
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:39.980
cause I had three choices in life,

2916
01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.910
dead or in prison or I am right now and I'm pretty,

2917
01:10:43.930 --> 01:10:45.020
I'm thankful to be where I am right now.

2918
01:10:45.170 --> 01:10:46.370
I'm not a religious person,

2919
01:10:46.371 --> 01:10:51.371
but I recognize that when a person becomes religious or when a person adopts the

2920
01:10:52.851 --> 01:10:54.230
ideals of religion,

2921
01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:55.910
of wanting to do the right thing,

2922
01:10:55.911 --> 01:10:57.200
like the really simple ideals,

2923
01:10:57.201 --> 01:10:58.160
wanting to do the right thing,

2924
01:10:58.161 --> 01:11:03.161
treat your brothers if they were yourself to go through life with that idea that

2925
01:11:03.621 --> 01:11:07.640
you are aspiring to the wants and desires of a higher power.

2926
01:11:07.641 --> 01:11:08.474
That's all knowing.

2927
01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:08.990
I'm like,

2928
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:10.040
you're going to do better.

2929
01:11:10.170 --> 01:11:11.290
It's like it's really simple.

2930
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:12.283
It's not.

2931
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:14.040
It's not whether or you believe in fairy

2932
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:14.431
<v 1>tales.</v>

2933
01:11:14.431 --> 01:11:19.431
It's the idea that you were aspiring to a higher connection with your brothers

2934
01:11:19.561 --> 01:11:22.410
and sisters on this planet and with the universe itself.

2935
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:24.380
And if you can call that God that you can call,

2936
01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:25.770
you can call that anything you want,

2937
01:11:25.771 --> 01:11:26.370
man.

2938
01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:27.121
Anything you want,

2939
01:11:27.121 --> 01:11:27.630
it makes,

2940
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:27.961
I have,

2941
01:11:27.961 --> 01:11:29.670
I have that battle of time with people who were like,

2942
01:11:29.671 --> 01:11:29.910
God,

2943
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:30.870
you don't believe in Jesus.

2944
01:11:30.871 --> 01:11:31.171
I was like,

2945
01:11:31.171 --> 01:11:31.570
you know,

2946
01:11:31.570 --> 01:11:34.080
but some guy who someone talked about and so yeah,

2947
01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:35.190
maybe who knows?

2948
01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:36.240
You don't know either bitch.

2949
01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:37.800
They don't know.

2950
01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:38.633
You don't know if you,

2951
01:11:38.650 --> 01:11:41.880
if you were born in 1972 you do not know about Jesus.

2952
01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:42.840
Prove that shit.

2953
01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:44.910
All I gotta say is,

2954
01:11:44.911 --> 01:11:45.091
you know,

2955
01:11:45.091 --> 01:11:45.840
before I go to bed,

2956
01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.051
<v 4>man,</v>

2957
01:11:46.051 --> 01:11:46.281
I wore,

2958
01:11:46.281 --> 01:11:48.210
I brush my teeth and I look who's around me.

2959
01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:50.113
It's myself.

2960
01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:51.690
I look in the mirror and I said,

2961
01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:54.780
did you do something today to help somebody?

2962
01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:57.091
Most of the days,

2963
01:11:57.091 --> 01:11:57.720
yes,

2964
01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:58.411
some of the days.

2965
01:11:58.411 --> 01:12:01.050
Now am I going to do something to model to help somebody?

2966
01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:01.770
Yeah,

2967
01:12:01.770 --> 01:12:02.603
I'm gonna try.

2968
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:04.050
And every day I do that,

2969
01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:05.920
I believe in myself.

2970
01:12:05.921 --> 01:12:07.920
I'm saying you're going to be a better person by doing that.

2971
01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:09.480
I don't need to add somebody else.

2972
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:10.441
I didn't get to go,

2973
01:12:10.441 --> 01:12:10.831
God,

2974
01:12:10.831 --> 01:12:11.311
please help me.

2975
01:12:11.311 --> 01:12:11.540
Because,

2976
01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:11.850
I mean,

2977
01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:12.541
don't get me wrong.

2978
01:12:12.541 --> 01:12:14.670
There's been times that I had been challenged and it's like,

2979
01:12:15.570 --> 01:12:15.781
what?

2980
01:12:15.781 --> 01:12:16.351
Why,

2981
01:12:16.351 --> 01:12:17.550
why are you doing this to me right now?

2982
01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:18.061
You know,

2983
01:12:18.061 --> 01:12:20.760
there's been times where I'm just like going and the challenges I've been

2984
01:12:20.761 --> 01:12:20.911
through,

2985
01:12:20.911 --> 01:12:21.870
my relationships,

2986
01:12:22.670 --> 01:12:23.220
you know,

2987
01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:24.060
personal stuff,

2988
01:12:24.061 --> 01:12:24.331
you know,

2989
01:12:24.331 --> 01:12:24.531
why,

2990
01:12:24.531 --> 01:12:26.100
why is my parents treat me like this?

2991
01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:26.670
Why,

2992
01:12:26.670 --> 01:12:27.503
why,

2993
01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:30.720
and all I kept the questions comes to my mind is I'm challenging you.

2994
01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:32.910
What type of man are you?

2995
01:12:32.911 --> 01:12:36.120
What type of character do you have that you could prove l sort of this

2996
01:12:36.430 --> 01:12:39.250
<v 1>with every moment of adversity in your life,</v>

2997
01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.530
<v 4>it comes an opportunity to grow and learn 100%.</v>

2998
01:12:41.531 --> 01:12:42.460
And every time I've had,

2999
01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:43.300
I mean,

3000
01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:43.901
two years ago,

3001
01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:44.111
I mean,

3002
01:12:44.111 --> 01:12:46.060
I went to the worst stuff from I ever had in my life.

3003
01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:47.290
And um,

3004
01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:49.870
just to kind of correct my character,

3005
01:12:50.350 --> 01:12:52.420
it was a factor that I,

3006
01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:53.530
it was a challenge.

3007
01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:53.741
You know,

3008
01:12:53.741 --> 01:12:55.620
it was a true challenge that I look back on.

3009
01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:56.454
It was just like,

3010
01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:01.960
that's a gift for trying to help somebody and I look and I would realize that I

3011
01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:02.771
made myself better.

3012
01:13:02.771 --> 01:13:05.560
I made myself mentally stronger because I went through the things I did.

3013
01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:05.911
<v 1>Well,</v>

3014
01:13:05.911 --> 01:13:08.440
I dunno what you're referring to that you went through some personal thing.

3015
01:13:09.690 --> 01:13:10.980
I mean it's,

3016
01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:13.110
it's just a part of life.

3017
01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:14.520
It's what goes what I said about,

3018
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:18.600
it's weird that all the interesting people I know all it fuck childhoods.

3019
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:23.070
It's like adversity can really make you a more interesting,

3020
01:13:23.071 --> 01:13:23.970
introspective,

3021
01:13:23.971 --> 01:13:24.660
more,

3022
01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:25.950
more well rounded person.

3023
01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:29.490
It really can if you allow it to or if you allow it to just decide that all life

3024
01:13:29.491 --> 01:13:30.324
hates me,

3025
01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:31.020
hates me.

3026
01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:32.400
God's not doing anything for me,

3027
01:13:32.401 --> 01:13:35.160
so I'm just going to quit being a fucking pussy.

3028
01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:36.180
Step up and be a man.

3029
01:13:37.230 --> 01:13:38.063
That is,

3030
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:40.200
it sounds like a meathead thing to say,

3031
01:13:40.201 --> 01:13:42.590
but that is reality is reality.

3032
01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:43.230
It's reality.

3033
01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:43.971
A fucking pussy.

3034
01:13:43.971 --> 01:13:46.050
You won't be able to step up and be a man.

3035
01:13:46.051 --> 01:13:48.030
Step up and make the right choices.

3036
01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:49.500
Make the right choice for yourself.

3037
01:13:49.530 --> 01:13:50.850
Don't do it because someone else told you,

3038
01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:53.810
don't do it because you're doing it to show someone wrong.

3039
01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:56.880
I do it because you look in the mirror and you're by yourself and you say,

3040
01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:58.200
are you going to do some better today?

3041
01:13:58.500 --> 01:13:59.610
Is this an attitude?

3042
01:13:59.611 --> 01:14:02.730
And is this a philosophy that you've sort of developed through trial and error

3043
01:14:02.731 --> 01:14:03.301
through your life?

3044
01:14:03.301 --> 01:14:07.440
100% you sort of slowly patched it together and piece it together.

3045
01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:08.393
100%

3046
01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:10.350
<v 4>and I think it all comes down to my children.</v>

3047
01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:12.040
I want to make sure I'm a good

3048
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:12.520
<v 5>dad.</v>

3049
01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.610
So you feel like it.

3050
01:14:13.611 --> 01:14:15.070
But just having these children,

3051
01:14:15.071 --> 01:14:18.330
having these kids that look up to you makes you an even better person.

3052
01:14:18.331 --> 01:14:20.110
It makes you aspire to a higher calling.

3053
01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:20.320
Yeah,

3054
01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:20.861
I think so.

3055
01:14:20.861 --> 01:14:22.660
I it really started was when I was,

3056
01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:23.050
uh,

3057
01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:26.800
I was an assistant coach at a marina high school,

3058
01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:27.653
Huntington Beach.

3059
01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:30.640
I'm wrestling with the kids and watch them go and coach,

3060
01:14:30.641 --> 01:14:30.941
coach,

3061
01:14:30.941 --> 01:14:31.300
coach,

3062
01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.133
coach.

3063
01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:34.010
And it wasn't a factor of this John who had to work hard.

3064
01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:35.590
I would help with their relationships.

3065
01:14:35.591 --> 01:14:36.101
They would ask me.

3066
01:14:36.101 --> 01:14:36.371
He's like,

3067
01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:38.080
it's girls can be problems are done.

3068
01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:42.310
So you felt like you could provide a service that you didn't get when you were a

3069
01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:42.550
kid?

3070
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:45.250
100% because I went to those same type of trials when I was a kid.

3071
01:14:45.490 --> 01:14:46.600
I always wonder why,

3072
01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:47.111
why?

3073
01:14:47.111 --> 01:14:48.820
And I was always the kid asking the questions,

3074
01:14:48.821 --> 01:14:49.210
why?

3075
01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:49.900
Why?

3076
01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:54.640
I always was challenged by that and I think through my life I've lived through

3077
01:14:54.641 --> 01:14:59.170
what people have gone through and had quit and have never made it past.

3078
01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:02.560
And I've made a pass because I believed that I was able to do it.

3079
01:15:03.010 --> 01:15:04.270
I mean there was times when you don't get me wrong,

3080
01:15:04.271 --> 01:15:06.160
I mean I'd ask for people for advice.

3081
01:15:06.161 --> 01:15:09.040
I mean I would ask for strength and I'd say,

3082
01:15:09.041 --> 01:15:09.341
God,

3083
01:15:09.341 --> 01:15:10.480
please help me through this right now.

3084
01:15:10.481 --> 01:15:11.430
And like I said,

3085
01:15:11.431 --> 01:15:11.710
I'm not,

3086
01:15:11.710 --> 01:15:12.543
I don't go to church,

3087
01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:15.010
but someone has to be able to,

3088
01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:17.860
something a little bit bigger to answer to.

3089
01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:19.540
When you were a kid and you were,

3090
01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:20.940
when you were a kid and you were an athlete,

3091
01:15:20.941 --> 01:15:21.760
when you're coming up,

3092
01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:24.760
was there anyone who you looked up to,

3093
01:15:24.761 --> 01:15:26.830
anyone who you drew inspiration from that you,

3094
01:15:26.970 --> 01:15:28.300
you looked at their work ethic.

3095
01:15:28.301 --> 01:15:30.340
Like it was a Dan Gable type character.

3096
01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:31.870
I watched whole calling them home at all,

3097
01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:33.920
<v 3>all Kogan and Mama leave.</v>

3098
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:35.330
Good guy,

3099
01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:36.550
male combination,

3100
01:15:37.050 --> 01:15:37.741
inch pop,

3101
01:15:37.741 --> 01:15:38.574
don't drive yet.

3102
01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:40.331
<v 5>I remember,</v>

3103
01:15:40.331 --> 01:15:40.730
uh,

3104
01:15:40.730 --> 01:15:43.310
Howard Cosell said something to Muhammad Ali and Muhammad.

3105
01:15:43.311 --> 01:15:45.350
I was irritated at him and he goes,

3106
01:15:45.351 --> 01:15:47.210
you're being very truculent champ.

3107
01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:47.781
And he goes,

3108
01:15:47.781 --> 01:15:47.871
well,

3109
01:15:47.871 --> 01:15:48.920
whatever truck lit means.

3110
01:15:48.921 --> 01:15:49.150
If it's

3111
01:15:49.150 --> 01:15:49.451
<v 3>good.</v>

3112
01:15:49.451 --> 01:15:50.284
I'm that

3113
01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:54.280
<v 5>said,</v>

3114
01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:54.980
I mean this sport,

3115
01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:55.391
MMA,

3116
01:15:55.391 --> 01:15:56.320
it's so new.

3117
01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:56.561
I mean,

3118
01:15:56.561 --> 01:15:59.180
there's so much stuff that people haven't touched you though,

3119
01:15:59.230 --> 01:16:00.063
mark on.

3120
01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:04.570
Why can't I do the things that I'll lead in boxing and MMA?

3121
01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:05.321
That's my question.

3122
01:16:05.321 --> 01:16:06.154
I was asking myself,

3123
01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:07.630
why can't I do what whole?

3124
01:16:07.631 --> 01:16:09.460
Because we did and Professor Russ,

3125
01:16:09.461 --> 01:16:11.550
as far as showmanship and showmanship,

3126
01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:12.850
champions style.

3127
01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:13.530
I mean,

3128
01:16:13.530 --> 01:16:14.920
I won world titles.

3129
01:16:15.010 --> 01:16:16.060
I defend the world titles.

3130
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:17.980
I made the star,

3131
01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:18.431
excuse me,

3132
01:16:18.431 --> 01:16:19.630
I'll retract that.

3133
01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:22.510
I helped make this sport what it is today.

3134
01:16:23.530 --> 01:16:24.850
I pushed it to the next level.

3135
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:25.270
Yeah.

3136
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:26.770
Maybe I said some shit I shouldn't have said.

3137
01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:27.760
Um,

3138
01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:27.990
what,

3139
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:29.910
do you have any regrets if you look back,

3140
01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:30.640
having grants,

3141
01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.473
um,

3142
01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:37.060
one and I just think it's just some that I,

3143
01:16:37.061 --> 01:16:40.870
that I learned and I think it was the only way I knew at the time was the shit

3144
01:16:40.871 --> 01:16:41.830
that I said towards Dana.

3145
01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:43.830
I'm a,

3146
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:44.240
I'm a,

3147
01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:45.073
I'm a human man.

3148
01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:47.980
I make mistakes and I was just defending for my family.

3149
01:16:48.250 --> 01:16:48.661
That's it.

3150
01:16:48.661 --> 01:16:49.750
Bad it's business.

3151
01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:51.460
So nothing personal towards,

3152
01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:55.360
it was nothing personal and it was never a towards the Fertitta family.

3153
01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:56.170
I love them.

3154
01:16:56.170 --> 01:16:57.920
I very thankful for everything they've been giving,

3155
01:16:57.921 --> 01:17:00.850
given to me and gave to me what I have wasn't for them.

3156
01:17:00.851 --> 01:17:02.320
I wouldn't have anything I have right now.

3157
01:17:02.710 --> 01:17:03.850
And Dana was my manager,

3158
01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:04.803
um,

3159
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:06.760
and he taught me to fight for things.

3160
01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.530
I remember when I fought for pay per view,

3161
01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:10.010
I fought for

3162
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:13.070
<v 1>those things because he told me to fight for those things.</v>

3163
01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:13.641
He's like,

3164
01:17:13.641 --> 01:17:13.921
boss,

3165
01:17:13.921 --> 01:17:14.361
who's doing it?

3166
01:17:14.361 --> 01:17:15.194
Why can't you do it?

3167
01:17:15.290 --> 01:17:16.150
We're going to get this from,

3168
01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:17.540
from Bob Myerwitz.

3169
01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:18.493
We're going to do this.

3170
01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:19.940
If these not going to do it,

3171
01:17:20.210 --> 01:17:20.871
we'll walk away.

3172
01:17:20.871 --> 01:17:21.704
We'll go to pride.

3173
01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:22.971
I looked at him like,

3174
01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:24.170
I don't want to go fight Japan.

3175
01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:25.340
I want to stay here in the states.

3176
01:17:25.810 --> 01:17:26.390
It was like,

3177
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:27.223
don't worry about it.

3178
01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:28.243
Don't answer.

3179
01:17:28.730 --> 01:17:30.590
So we sat for a week and a half.

3180
01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:31.401
Is it weird?

3181
01:17:31.401 --> 01:17:31.731
Watson,

3182
01:17:31.731 --> 01:17:34.760
Dana go from being a manager to a promoter,

3183
01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:35.780
the different person.

3184
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:37.070
Complete opposite role.

3185
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:38.330
<v 4>Definitely man.</v>

3186
01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:38.931
Total different.

3187
01:17:38.931 --> 01:17:39.350
He's not,

3188
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:40.220
he's not the same person.

3189
01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:40.590
He,

3190
01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:40.910
he's,

3191
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:41.620
that's not Dana.

3192
01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:42.453
All right.

3193
01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:44.210
I love him.

3194
01:17:44.210 --> 01:17:49.210
I miss his friendship and I mean me and him were boys and I see him change and

3195
01:17:50.271 --> 01:17:50.720
he's,

3196
01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:51.560
I just,

3197
01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:54.290
he's became these became famous.

3198
01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:55.400
It's crazy,

3199
01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:56.503
crazy,

3200
01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:57.650
crazy.

3201
01:17:57.650 --> 01:17:59.960
I can't say nothing bad about because he's given so much to me.

3202
01:18:00.370 --> 01:18:00.760
I,

3203
01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:05.150
I've said everything that I wanted to through my career and it was nothing ever

3204
01:18:05.151 --> 01:18:06.530
towards personal towards him.

3205
01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:09.230
It was always business and it was no more than that.

3206
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:11.120
I was defending for my family.

3207
01:18:11.121 --> 01:18:16.121
I was definitive for as a business [inaudible] brand punishment brand was a

3208
01:18:16.161 --> 01:18:20.140
business to me and I wasn't getting locked or I wasn't get walked over on.

3209
01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:21.030
<v 1>Well I get man,</v>

3210
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:23.050
I don't know the specifics of your ear,

3211
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:24.330
your dispute,

3212
01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:30.630
but I've known Dana from the beginning when they first bought the organization.

3213
01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:31.620
He's definitely different,

3214
01:18:31.770 --> 01:18:32.101
you know,

3215
01:18:32.101 --> 01:18:34.800
he's more confident now and he's more successful now,

3216
01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:35.830
but me and him is,

3217
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:37.680
he live a very different relationship.

3218
01:18:38.610 --> 01:18:41.250
They call that cockiness you said confidence,

3219
01:18:41.251 --> 01:18:41.820
I guess.

3220
01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:42.280
You know,

3221
01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:46.050
it's also the Hubris is how he gets things done and that's why he's so good at

3222
01:18:46.051 --> 01:18:46.540
what he does.

3223
01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:47.990
And he does an awesome job with UFC.

3224
01:18:47.991 --> 01:18:48.990
I mean it wasn't for him.

3225
01:18:48.991 --> 01:18:49.980
We wouldn't be where we are today,

3226
01:18:49.981 --> 01:18:50.490
that's for sure.

3227
01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:51.240
He's got a whole lot.

3228
01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:52.230
It doesn't give a fuck.

3229
01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:53.880
I appreciate that.

3230
01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:55.981
I appreciate,

3231
01:18:55.981 --> 01:18:56.790
uh,

3232
01:18:56.790 --> 01:19:00.600
I appreciate how much the guy works for it and I also appreciate,

3233
01:19:00.601 --> 01:19:01.860
I like watching people grow.

3234
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:03.140
I like watching the guy who was not,

3235
01:19:03.141 --> 01:19:04.140
and you can call it cocky,

3236
01:19:04.141 --> 01:19:04.974
but

3237
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:08.250
my relationship with the dudes very different than yours.

3238
01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:09.690
I'm never really had a dispute with him.

3239
01:19:09.691 --> 01:19:10.524
Me and him are,

3240
01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:11.620
we always get a little narrower.

3241
01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:12.390
We talk,

3242
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:13.830
but I can still see I can.

3243
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:18.300
I think you have to have an unflappable belief in yourself to run a company like

3244
01:19:18.301 --> 01:19:19.270
that and garlic.

3245
01:19:19.290 --> 01:19:22.590
You could say that's negative all you want,

3246
01:19:22.830 --> 01:19:24.750
but I think it doesn't do what he does.

3247
01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:25.890
You gotta be like that.

3248
01:19:25.891 --> 01:19:27.600
I think he's the perfect guy for the job.

3249
01:19:27.690 --> 01:19:28.500
It's a business.

3250
01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:29.070
Yeah.

3251
01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:30.330
I think along with you,

3252
01:19:30.331 --> 01:19:33.600
he's one of the more integrity reasons why this sport has become what it's

3253
01:19:33.601 --> 01:19:34.410
become.

3254
01:19:34.410 --> 01:19:35.160
It's a,

3255
01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:38.040
you can't have someone who's nuts running the fucking thing,

3256
01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:38.671
you know?

3257
01:19:38.671 --> 01:19:39.660
It's a crazy sport,

3258
01:19:39.661 --> 01:19:39.901
man.

3259
01:19:39.901 --> 01:19:41.040
This ain't a normal sport.

3260
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.970
You know,

3261
01:19:41.970 --> 01:19:42.690
it's nuts.

3262
01:19:42.690 --> 01:19:44.190
I think it should be about the fighters a little more,

3263
01:19:44.191 --> 01:19:46.200
but that's just my opinion.

3264
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.741
Well,

3265
01:19:46.741 --> 01:19:51.150
it is an opportunity and it's an opportunity that you have capitalized on better

3266
01:19:51.151 --> 01:19:51.984
than most,

3267
01:19:52.110 --> 01:19:54.200
and that that opportunity to,

3268
01:19:54.230 --> 01:19:54.691
to really,

3269
01:19:54.691 --> 01:19:55.231
like you said,

3270
01:19:55.231 --> 01:19:55.831
make a brand,

3271
01:19:55.831 --> 01:19:56.970
make a name for yourself.

3272
01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:03.460
<v 4>I can't explain this to a fight more enough is do something different that the</v>

3273
01:20:03.701 --> 01:20:05.390
other fighters are doing it as a,

3274
01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:06.700
when I first started it,

3275
01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:08.250
I was the first kind of make fighter cards.

3276
01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:12.000
<v 5>All of a sudden rampage started doing it.</v>

3277
01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:12.361
I mean,

3278
01:20:12.361 --> 01:20:12.871
I helped him,

3279
01:20:12.871 --> 01:20:13.231
he's dead.

3280
01:20:13.231 --> 01:20:14.640
But when you say fight or cards,

3281
01:20:14.641 --> 01:20:16.200
his cards with the little,

3282
01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.470
I make 10,000 of those.

3283
01:20:19.471 --> 01:20:21.510
I'm at my 16th edition of doing them.

3284
01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:22.200
Um,

3285
01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:22.890
I just didn't,

3286
01:20:22.890 --> 01:20:23.641
I have one word,

3287
01:20:23.641 --> 01:20:24.271
but in my last one,

3288
01:20:24.271 --> 01:20:25.650
my retirement or my last one,

3289
01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:28.920
but I made 10,000 of each one and wherever I would go,

3290
01:20:28.921 --> 01:20:29.754
I'd pass them out.

3291
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I would literally sit there and put them on every single chair in the front row.

3292
01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:34.590
That's fine.

3293
01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:35.131
And I,

3294
01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:36.450
it was brand new and I was,

3295
01:20:36.451 --> 01:20:37.470
I understood by doing that.

3296
01:20:37.471 --> 01:20:39.270
I mean there was a part,

3297
01:20:39.271 --> 01:20:42.660
I think it was five years ago where I got a letter from USC saying,

3298
01:20:42.690 --> 01:20:43.523
you can't do that anymore.

3299
01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:44.731
I was like,

3300
01:20:44.731 --> 01:20:46.980
what do you mean I can't do anymore because he can't do that anymore.

3301
01:20:47.010 --> 01:20:47.910
It's free.

3302
01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:48.600
I was like,

3303
01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:49.800
but you can't do that anymore.

3304
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:50.820
You can't promote yourself.

3305
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.863
And I was like,

3306
01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:52.651
okay,

3307
01:20:52.651 --> 01:20:53.490
I'll keep my mouth shut.

3308
01:20:53.491 --> 01:20:54.690
Then that was just,

3309
01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:57.750
you couldn't put cards on chairs.

3310
01:20:58.170 --> 01:20:59.190
What's up with that?

3311
01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:02.320
Because people don't want to sweep up a lot of people throwing those cards away.

3312
01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.350
I mean there's popcorn on the floor.

3313
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:05.783
Come on.

3314
01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:07.500
Why do they need to put white paper on the ground?

3315
01:21:07.501 --> 01:21:08.334
Brian?

3316
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:10.050
People are supposed to put them in their pocket.

3317
01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:11.101
Listen,

3318
01:21:11.101 --> 01:21:12.990
that's what happens on a business becomes big.

3319
01:21:12.991 --> 01:21:15.150
They also had to start developing corporate rules.

3320
01:21:15.450 --> 01:21:16.283
Yeah,

3321
01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:17.001
but I say,

3322
01:21:17.001 --> 01:21:17.940
I mean as fighters,

3323
01:21:17.941 --> 01:21:21.300
if like say I want to be a inspiration of fighters,

3324
01:21:21.301 --> 01:21:21.810

3325
01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:23.100
you guys got to promote yourself.

3326
01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.170
I mean USC would do their part.

3327
01:21:25.171 --> 01:21:25.620
Yes.

3328
01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:26.280
Um,

3329
01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:27.870
do you think that's a big part of your legacy?

3330
01:21:28.090 --> 01:21:28.831
Like that's one,

3331
01:21:28.831 --> 01:21:30.570
one definite thing that you added to the game.

3332
01:21:30.810 --> 01:21:31.350
Yeah.

3333
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.950
Promotion.

3334
01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:32.783
It was about,

3335
01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:33.960
I was whole Colton dude.

3336
01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:34.590
Yeah.

3337
01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:35.730
I followed his footsteps.

3338
01:21:35.970 --> 01:21:37.650
Well you were the only guy who was doing it.

3339
01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:37.921
Really.

3340
01:21:37.921 --> 01:21:38.820
There was no one who is doing it.

3341
01:21:38.821 --> 01:21:39.481
Like we were doing it.

3342
01:21:39.481 --> 01:21:41.220
Dan Henderson started making fighter cards.

3343
01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.420
Randy couture started making,

3344
01:21:42.690 --> 01:21:43.680
I was making them for them.

3345
01:21:43.681 --> 01:21:44.820
How are we getting them done for them?

3346
01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:45.390
That's fine.

3347
01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:46.071
They understand it,

3348
01:21:46.071 --> 01:21:48.750
but it was about Ladell had a fighter.

3349
01:21:48.810 --> 01:21:50.600
I have five cards with me and check the down.

3350
01:21:50.601 --> 01:21:53.520
I'm chuck the dose fighter cards and there's fans that came up to me and showed

3351
01:21:53.521 --> 01:21:56.050
him and he see a little tea punishment logo on it.

3352
01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:57.180
And it was funny.

3353
01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:58.340
That was funny cause I was back with me.

3354
01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:59.640
Chucklito were never friends.

3355
01:21:59.850 --> 01:22:02.550
It's going to be a strange thing for you to have watched,

3356
01:22:02.610 --> 01:22:03.090
uh,

3357
01:22:03.090 --> 01:22:07.140
going from where you did that first fight in 1997 to like,

3358
01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:07.650
you know,

3359
01:22:07.650 --> 01:22:07.951
seeing him,

3360
01:22:07.951 --> 01:22:10.920
Roger worked on the cover of sports illustrated and seeing all this.

3361
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:11.790
It's cool dude.

3362
01:22:11.850 --> 01:22:12.181
It's cool.

3363
01:22:12.181 --> 01:22:13.950
It does it like to watch this all like,

3364
01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:18.510
I mean you literally got on the train at the first stop this,

3365
01:22:18.511 --> 01:22:23.220
this last month has been really heart wrenching for me.

3366
01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:24.540
It's just one of those things just going,

3367
01:22:24.541 --> 01:22:25.374
wow,

3368
01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:29.520
I helped get this word is today and it's over,

3369
01:22:29.730 --> 01:22:30.690
but I'm okay with it.

3370
01:22:30.691 --> 01:22:31.141
I'm cool with it.

3371
01:22:31.141 --> 01:22:31.321
I'm good.

3372
01:22:31.321 --> 01:22:31.910
I'm good with it.

3373
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:32.400
I'm like,

3374
01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:33.450
you're happy with it really,

3375
01:22:33.451 --> 01:22:33.901
really happened.

3376
01:22:33.901 --> 01:22:35.720
Then there's your people come up to me and like,

3377
01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:36.990
so when you're coming back,

3378
01:22:36.991 --> 01:22:37.651
when you find I'm like,

3379
01:22:37.651 --> 01:22:38.484
I'm done.

3380
01:22:38.850 --> 01:22:39.990
And it was like,

3381
01:22:40.710 --> 01:22:41.151
it was playing.

3382
01:22:41.151 --> 01:22:42.420
I was sending my therapist and he was like,

3383
01:22:42.421 --> 01:22:43.800
so fighters,

3384
01:22:43.801 --> 01:22:44.041
I mean,

3385
01:22:44.041 --> 01:22:45.460
we just kind of bad couple months ago,

3386
01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:46.050

3387
01:22:46.050 --> 01:22:46.770
so fighters,

3388
01:22:46.770 --> 01:22:46.960

3389
01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:47.791
I had no boxers.

3390
01:22:47.791 --> 01:22:48.570
After they fight,

3391
01:22:48.570 --> 01:22:49.430
they want to come back and do it.

3392
01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:49.621
I go,

3393
01:22:49.621 --> 01:22:49.801
no,

3394
01:22:49.801 --> 01:22:50.634
dude,

3395
01:22:50.670 --> 01:22:51.503
I'm done.

3396
01:22:52.410 --> 01:22:52.891
I'm done.

3397
01:22:52.891 --> 01:22:53.724
I made my money.

3398
01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:55.080
My kids are there,

3399
01:22:55.081 --> 01:22:56.580
their futures is done.

3400
01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:58.560
They go to college and go to any university.

3401
01:22:58.561 --> 01:22:59.910
They wanted to get their masters.

3402
01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:01.030
I'm,

3403
01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:01.561
I'm done.

3404
01:23:01.561 --> 01:23:02.011
I don't want,

3405
01:23:02.011 --> 01:23:02.750
I wanted to do,

3406
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:03.710
I have my clothing company,

3407
01:23:03.711 --> 01:23:05.800
he's doing awesome like nutrition.

3408
01:23:05.801 --> 01:23:07.270
My punishment tuition is doing awesome.

3409
01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:07.991
You know?

3410
01:23:07.991 --> 01:23:08.800
Um,

3411
01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.330
my Jim started to grow,

3412
01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:10.870
um,

3413
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:11.231
you know,

3414
01:23:11.231 --> 01:23:11.920
I'm gonna Start Doing,

3415
01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:12.970
trying to do some acting.

3416
01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:13.640
Um,

3417
01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:14.473
uh,

3418
01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:19.420
I think he used my brain for a lot more than just fighting and I'm sick of all

3419
01:23:19.421 --> 01:23:20.254
the pressure.

3420
01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:22.210
I'm sick of beard,

3421
01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:26.080
expected so much of I be due the 15th.

3422
01:23:26.230 --> 01:23:27.430
When you say the pressure,

3423
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:29.830
you mean the psychological pressure of performing?

3424
01:23:29.831 --> 01:23:30.160
Yes.

3425
01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:32.010
Getting in there and throw a no one.

3426
01:23:32.011 --> 01:23:32.610
You're going to get hurt.

3427
01:23:32.610 --> 01:23:32.891
No one.

3428
01:23:32.891 --> 01:23:33.440
You're going to be fun.

3429
01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:37.420
I know you're gonna get her knowing that you got to not letting my fans down,

3430
01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:38.680
not letting my family down,

3431
01:23:38.681 --> 01:23:39.850
not letting my kids down,

3432
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:43.480
not letting so many people are around me down.

3433
01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:44.313
You know?

3434
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:45.700
And people always thinking about,

3435
01:23:45.730 --> 01:23:45.990
well,

3436
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:47.410
you shouldn't think about losing.

3437
01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:48.310
I don't think about it.

3438
01:23:48.311 --> 01:23:49.350
It's not the fact of losing.

3439
01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.230
That goes through my mind.

3440
01:23:50.231 --> 01:23:50.511
Of course,

3441
01:23:50.511 --> 01:23:52.990
that just that just maybe 5% of a thought.

3442
01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:53.811
Nah,

3443
01:23:53.811 --> 01:23:54.460
it's think about,

3444
01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:54.620
well,

3445
01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:54.911
what if I,

3446
01:23:54.911 --> 01:23:57.670
what if I get bounced on my head again and I'm paralyzed?

3447
01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:59.890
I had that happen once before I fought forest,

3448
01:23:59.950 --> 01:24:03.270
UFC one oh six I got bounced off my head by Aaron Ross.

3449
01:24:03.271 --> 01:24:06.250
Son In my arms and legs were completely numb for two minutes.

3450
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:09.760
I was laying in the middle of the cage up in big bear for two minutes.

3451
01:24:09.761 --> 01:24:10.594
Paralyzed.

3452
01:24:11.170 --> 01:24:12.790
That's some scary shit.

3453
01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:14.080
I mean people,

3454
01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.010
people don't understand that.

3455
01:24:15.011 --> 01:24:15.731
People don't see that.

3456
01:24:15.731 --> 01:24:17.990
People don't understand what my train of partners wanted to see that my trainers

3457
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:18.833
to see that shit.

3458
01:24:18.970 --> 01:24:21.970
The fans don't see that they think or how did you deal with that?

3459
01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:22.893
Um,

3460
01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:26.980
well like two minutes later I got up the emergency or the paramedics came.

3461
01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:28.463
Um,

3462
01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:30.100
I got up and said we're taking your emergency.

3463
01:24:30.101 --> 01:24:30.311
I'm going,

3464
01:24:30.311 --> 01:24:30.341
no,

3465
01:24:30.341 --> 01:24:30.401
no,

3466
01:24:30.401 --> 01:24:30.461
no,

3467
01:24:30.461 --> 01:24:30.551
no.

3468
01:24:30.551 --> 01:24:30.791
I'm cool.

3469
01:24:30.791 --> 01:24:31.061
I'm good.

3470
01:24:31.061 --> 01:24:32.110
I'm good tests.

3471
01:24:32.111 --> 01:24:32.891
My arms are good.

3472
01:24:32.891 --> 01:24:33.321
A Mama cat,

3473
01:24:33.321 --> 01:24:34.780
my cat went laid bed,

3474
01:24:34.781 --> 01:24:36.790
laid in bed for a couple of days,

3475
01:24:36.791 --> 01:24:37.624
uh,

3476
01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:40.360
woke up that next day and I just had pains going.

3477
01:24:40.370 --> 01:24:40.890
I'm arms.

3478
01:24:40.890 --> 01:24:41.980
So I went and got injections.

3479
01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:43.990
I got a cortisone injection was my neck.

3480
01:24:44.350 --> 01:24:45.610
They give me 15 shots.

3481
01:24:45.611 --> 01:24:48.120
So this is the same neck injury that you wound up getting surgery?

3482
01:24:48.130 --> 01:24:48.963
I got surgery.

3483
01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:50.320
This was started,

3484
01:24:50.350 --> 01:24:51.790
this was three weeks before.

3485
01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:52.960
You'll see what else?

3486
01:24:52.961 --> 01:24:53.381
Six.

3487
01:24:53.381 --> 01:24:57.760
This was when I found out that Brock Lesnar pulled out and I became the main

3488
01:24:57.780 --> 01:24:58.510
event.

3489
01:24:58.510 --> 01:24:59.343
So I was pulling out.

3490
01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:00.573
I was,

3491
01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:03.250
I had to pay for my pay for my family of course.

3492
01:25:03.250 --> 01:25:04.240
But at the same time,

3493
01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:06.970
I didn't want any data down because if I would've pulled down and he goes,

3494
01:25:06.971 --> 01:25:07.061
well,

3495
01:25:07.061 --> 01:25:07.241
here's,

3496
01:25:07.241 --> 01:25:10.450
Tito would get fucking plot our batches and good blast me on fucking the

3497
01:25:10.451 --> 01:25:13.750
Internet and blasting media saying ddos being a pussy again.

3498
01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.030
And that's all I thought that's ever came about.

3499
01:25:16.031 --> 01:25:20.230
My fans have that questions because of him blasting me and it sucks,

3500
01:25:20.231 --> 01:25:20.530
man.

3501
01:25:20.530 --> 01:25:22.210
I just wish it never came about that part.

3502
01:25:22.230 --> 01:25:23.020
Uh,

3503
01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:23.800
but I look at it,

3504
01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:24.521
I had to get a surgery,

3505
01:25:24.521 --> 01:25:24.791
you know,

3506
01:25:24.791 --> 01:25:25.420
I,

3507
01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:27.550
I thought it would go away after I got my objections.

3508
01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:28.420
It felt better.

3509
01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:29.081
You know,

3510
01:25:29.081 --> 01:25:32.950
I'm in the third round or that fight when I fought for the second time,

3511
01:25:33.250 --> 01:25:34.240
I remember third round and going,

3512
01:25:34.241 --> 01:25:34.810
fuck,

3513
01:25:34.810 --> 01:25:35.860
I ain't got nothing left.

3514
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:37.240
Don't get knocked down.

3515
01:25:37.250 --> 01:25:38.120
Don't get taken down.

3516
01:25:38.130 --> 01:25:39.040
You got to match one.

3517
01:25:39.370 --> 01:25:40.570
They'd have given him the match.

3518
01:25:40.571 --> 01:25:41.260
And uh,

3519
01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:42.550
I remember after it was going to God,

3520
01:25:42.551 --> 01:25:42.791
I think,

3521
01:25:42.791 --> 01:25:43.121
God,

3522
01:25:43.121 --> 01:25:43.800
this is over.

3523
01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:44.633
I had a fracture,

3524
01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:45.693
right?

3525
01:25:46.150 --> 01:25:47.770
Eyebrow bone was cracked.

3526
01:25:47.790 --> 01:25:48.520
Um,

3527
01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.170
I was pretty beat up after that fight.

3528
01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:50.921
And,

3529
01:25:50.921 --> 01:25:51.281
uh,

3530
01:25:51.281 --> 01:25:55.950
I remember three weeks before for a month and a half before that fight even

3531
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.410
happen.

3532
01:25:56.410 --> 01:25:57.071
Dan asked what I do,

3533
01:25:57.071 --> 01:25:57.880
y'all can fight her.

3534
01:25:57.880 --> 01:25:58.061
I said,

3535
01:25:58.061 --> 01:25:58.721
of course I'll do it.

3536
01:25:58.721 --> 01:25:59.554
No problem at all.

3537
01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:01.120
And this situation came about,

3538
01:26:01.370 --> 01:26:03.980
it was already signed from you to do it and thought if I took a month

3539
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:04.580
<v 4>off,</v>

3540
01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:07.490
I came back and shot it in January that I'd be okay.

3541
01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:10.340
I can get through the camp and then I would fight.

3542
01:26:10.341 --> 01:26:14.090
Chuck was sparring with the guys I was training with for the ultimate fighter

3543
01:26:14.091 --> 01:26:17.850
and I got hit with a couple of shots before between trader that would hold,

3544
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:19.460
watch TV laid down,

3545
01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:21.740
went to go get up and I couldn't stand up.

3546
01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:22.281
I was like,

3547
01:26:22.281 --> 01:26:23.114
what the fuck?

3548
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:24.710
I certain feel safe,

3549
01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:26.960
same pain or sickness of my stomach.

3550
01:26:26.961 --> 01:26:29.380
I was dry heaving with the doctors.

3551
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:31.730
Just said you got to rupture disc and C six c seven.

3552
01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:33.141
And I told David,

3553
01:26:33.141 --> 01:26:33.570
I called,

3554
01:26:33.570 --> 01:26:34.760
told them and uh,

3555
01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:37.310
you like okay shirt cause I couldn't mean okay,

3556
01:26:37.311 --> 01:26:37.760
sure.

3557
01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:40.670
Well do they got a ruptured disc in my neck was like,

3558
01:26:40.671 --> 01:26:40.911
all right,

3559
01:26:40.911 --> 01:26:41.970
well we'll go.

3560
01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:43.990
We had to use doctors to make sure I go,

3561
01:26:44.170 --> 01:26:44.631
all right,

3562
01:26:44.631 --> 01:26:45.020
so,

3563
01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:45.201
okay,

3564
01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:46.034
question me.

3565
01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:48.050
They showed ruptured disk.

3566
01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:52.610
They went in and did surgery five days before the ultimate fighter.

3567
01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:53.840
Season 11 was over.

3568
01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:54.741
He goes,

3569
01:26:54.741 --> 01:26:55.610
we got to let you go.

3570
01:26:55.630 --> 01:26:55.730
Like,

3571
01:26:55.730 --> 01:26:56.870
what do you mean we got let me go.

3572
01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:59.060
You know you're not going to be fighting,

3573
01:26:59.061 --> 01:27:00.390
so we need to promote the next fight.

3574
01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:01.311
I go,

3575
01:27:01.311 --> 01:27:03.710
so you're going to fucking fire me on television.

3576
01:27:03.810 --> 01:27:04.041
It was,

3577
01:27:04.041 --> 01:27:04.371
yeah,

3578
01:27:04.371 --> 01:27:05.780
that's the way it's supposed to be.

3579
01:27:06.990 --> 01:27:08.360
Cause I would do that with anyone.

3580
01:27:08.430 --> 01:27:08.710
You're like,

3581
01:27:08.710 --> 01:27:09.120
dude,

3582
01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:09.861
that's fucking,

3583
01:27:09.861 --> 01:27:10.880
are you serious right now?

3584
01:27:10.881 --> 01:27:11.151
And goes,

3585
01:27:11.151 --> 01:27:11.570
yeah.

3586
01:27:11.570 --> 01:27:13.820
<v 1>The show though is to promote a fight.</v>

3587
01:27:13.821 --> 01:27:14.120
Right.

3588
01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:14.960
That was the idea of,

3589
01:27:14.961 --> 01:27:15.381
okay Anthony,

3590
01:27:15.381 --> 01:27:16.280
here's a question for you.

3591
01:27:16.730 --> 01:27:17.930
Maybe they should work with you.

3592
01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:20.430
We would you be of happier.

3593
01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:22.250
When rich came in,

3594
01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:26.540
you trained along with them 100% instead of making a limelight of sitting chuck

3595
01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:29.300
down and fucking saying that telus plenty of fight and chuck getting them.

3596
01:27:29.330 --> 01:27:29.511
Oh,

3597
01:27:29.511 --> 01:27:30.410
I told you he had pulled out.

3598
01:27:30.411 --> 01:27:31.221
He's a fucking pussy.

3599
01:27:31.221 --> 01:27:32.054
He pull out,

3600
01:27:32.530 --> 01:27:33.460
<v 4>come on dude,</v>

3601
01:27:33.610 --> 01:27:34.540
be real man.

3602
01:27:34.541 --> 01:27:35.740
Are you fucking serious?

3603
01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:37.510
And that really pissed me off.

3604
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:40.150
That was just over the board about doing that.

3605
01:27:40.151 --> 01:27:42.130
Just just to destroy my image.

3606
01:27:42.210 --> 01:27:42.771
And that's what they,

3607
01:27:42.771 --> 01:27:43.930
they've always tried to do.

3608
01:27:44.290 --> 01:27:46.350
And then I took it and you know,

3609
01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:49.660
I'm getting real do I don't give a fuck what people say when then when they came

3610
01:27:49.661 --> 01:27:49.991
about,

3611
01:27:49.991 --> 01:27:54.050
and Dan says that I came out and I was one of the US,

3612
01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:56.230
one of the only use fibershed destroy the company.

3613
01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:57.190
Bullshit.

3614
01:27:57.190 --> 01:27:57.911
I've never been there.

3615
01:27:57.911 --> 01:28:00.880
I've always tried to promote and help this company prevail and get better.

3616
01:28:00.881 --> 01:28:03.010
And he's only the top guy that's ever tried to destroy me.

3617
01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:05.080
And thank God on my fans.

3618
01:28:05.081 --> 01:28:05.950
I think God,

3619
01:28:05.951 --> 01:28:06.820
I could fucking fight.

3620
01:28:06.821 --> 01:28:06.971
Well,

3621
01:28:06.971 --> 01:28:07.061
I'm,

3622
01:28:07.061 --> 01:28:09.250
thank God I've always spoken my mind.

3623
01:28:09.251 --> 01:28:12.040
The fans have supported me that I was able to become who I am.

3624
01:28:12.490 --> 01:28:15.040
And the only reason that happened was because I worked hard to get where I am.

3625
01:28:15.610 --> 01:28:19.510
And I look at the situation that I had met portrayed and over the last eight

3626
01:28:19.511 --> 01:28:20.344
years,

3627
01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:21.190
it's been bad,

3628
01:28:21.190 --> 01:28:22.510
but I've been able to survive.

3629
01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:24.790
And you look at other fighters like Matt Lindland,

3630
01:28:26.370 --> 01:28:27.790
he was was a champ.

3631
01:28:28.330 --> 01:28:30.190
People forget about them because he tried to stand up.

3632
01:28:30.610 --> 01:28:31.990
There's other fighters to tried to do the same thing,

3633
01:28:31.991 --> 01:28:32.741
to stand up there,

3634
01:28:32.741 --> 01:28:33.574
forgot about,

3635
01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:34.481
<v 1>well,</v>

3636
01:28:34.481 --> 01:28:34.831
in,

3637
01:28:34.831 --> 01:28:36.400
in the defense of the UFC,

3638
01:28:36.430 --> 01:28:38.770
Matt Lindland wore a shirt that was forbidden.

3639
01:28:38.771 --> 01:28:40.840
It was a casino shirt and we're a to a casino.

3640
01:28:40.841 --> 01:28:41.230
Right?

3641
01:28:41.230 --> 01:28:42.460
Isn't that what happened at a way in,

3642
01:28:42.461 --> 01:28:43.330
so that's why they banned them.

3643
01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:44.320
Um,

3644
01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:44.950
I,

3645
01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:45.520
I don't know.

3646
01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:46.031
I don't know.

3647
01:28:46.031 --> 01:28:47.940
I don't want to speak to the specifics of his detail.

3648
01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:48.340
Yulia,

3649
01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:52.210
same situation as recur Rodrigues and he had fucking pallet or a station on his

3650
01:28:52.211 --> 01:28:52.421
back,

3651
01:28:52.421 --> 01:28:52.690
right?

3652
01:28:52.690 --> 01:28:53.170
Yeah.

3653
01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:53.650
Yeah.

3654
01:28:53.650 --> 01:28:54.483
Rico stayed around.

3655
01:28:55.150 --> 01:28:58.330
But just to kind of go back on where the conversation about the ultimate fighter

3656
01:28:58.690 --> 01:29:01.500
now with Dominick Cruz and,

3657
01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:02.693
um,

3658
01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:03.240
<v 5>you're right.</v>

3659
01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:03.870
A favor.

3660
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:05.880
[inaudible] why didn't Dominick Cruz go home?

3661
01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:08.060
We heard himself on the show.

3662
01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:09.060
Okay.

3663
01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:09.893
Why didn't he go?

3664
01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:10.740
Well,

3665
01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:10.980
I,

3666
01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:11.641
I think,

3667
01:29:11.641 --> 01:29:11.790
uh,

3668
01:29:11.790 --> 01:29:12.740
it was late in this,

3669
01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.160
in this season is it wasn't it?

3670
01:29:14.190 --> 01:29:14.431
Yeah,

3671
01:29:14.431 --> 01:29:15.750
but mine was five days left.

3672
01:29:16.690 --> 01:29:17.523
<v 3>I don't know man.</v>

3673
01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:19.853
I know,

3674
01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:20.820
I know that you,

3675
01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:21.810
I'm just looking at,

3676
01:29:21.811 --> 01:29:22.201
Oh yeah,

3677
01:29:22.201 --> 01:29:22.390
no,

3678
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:23.890
I'm just looking at some issues,

3679
01:29:24.100 --> 01:29:25.060
but I'm just looking at the real,

3680
01:29:25.061 --> 01:29:26.110
real questions that,

3681
01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:26.800
you know,

3682
01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:29.860
things that we think it's unfair to bring this up unless he was here as well

3683
01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:30.220
too.

3684
01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:30.670
You know,

3685
01:29:30.670 --> 01:29:32.410
cause I don't know all the details of it.

3686
01:29:32.830 --> 01:29:34.450
I'm sorry that that had happened with you.

3687
01:29:34.510 --> 01:29:34.640
Yeah.

3688
01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:35.290
It's your set.

3689
01:29:35.290 --> 01:29:37.650
Just things that I always think about that just a,

3690
01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:39.390
I think my fans are really bummed about it.

3691
01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:40.570
They have those same questions.

3692
01:29:40.571 --> 01:29:44.920
So you feel like you just unfairly fairly portrayed as far as like your injuries

3693
01:29:44.921 --> 01:29:47.380
and they try to make fun of your character or

3694
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:49.303
<v 5>100%.</v>

3695
01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:50.170
And it was to,

3696
01:29:50.170 --> 01:29:51.450
to downplay me and,

3697
01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:52.791
and you know,

3698
01:29:52.791 --> 01:29:53.241
like I say,

3699
01:29:53.241 --> 01:29:53.451
man,

3700
01:29:53.451 --> 01:29:54.620
that that's behind me now.

3701
01:29:54.810 --> 01:29:55.560
Um,

3702
01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:55.880
but let's,

3703
01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:56.121
so,

3704
01:29:56.121 --> 01:29:57.280
so still things that I,

3705
01:29:57.281 --> 01:30:01.560
I still hear all the time for my fans and I still hear from my family and it

3706
01:30:01.610 --> 01:30:06.440
hurts my feelings and when my kids start talking about it and they get bed in

3707
01:30:06.441 --> 01:30:07.850
front of school for things like that,

3708
01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:09.890
that's my kids man.

3709
01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:10.813
And it's,

3710
01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:14.860
<v 3>that's challenging I think what the kids say to year kid like,</v>

3711
01:30:15.010 --> 01:30:15.880
oh my kid just saying,

3712
01:30:15.881 --> 01:30:16.001
oh,

3713
01:30:16.001 --> 01:30:16.811
your dad's a pussy.

3714
01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:17.600
He,

3715
01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:17.981
yeah,

3716
01:30:17.981 --> 01:30:19.580
like gnarly stuff didn't he gets tense.

3717
01:30:19.630 --> 01:30:20.463
Hilarious.

3718
01:30:20.710 --> 01:30:25.000
It's hilarious that kids would actually have the balls to say that a former

3719
01:30:25.210 --> 01:30:30.210
light heavyweight champion of the UFC is somehow a pussy and low bar,

3720
01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:33.120
but the rash thing is the only association they get that far.

3721
01:30:33.121 --> 01:30:34.600
I was from Dana because my dad,

3722
01:30:34.601 --> 01:30:34.830
mom,

3723
01:30:34.830 --> 01:30:35.030
I,

3724
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.531
my kids,

3725
01:30:35.531 --> 01:30:37.030
all you,

3726
01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:37.811
he's a champion.

3727
01:30:37.811 --> 01:30:38.381
What are you talking about?

3728
01:30:38.381 --> 01:30:39.330
How can you stand that he's all just,

3729
01:30:39.331 --> 01:30:43.570
that's what Dana White's is and it's like a 10 year old kids,

3730
01:30:43.571 --> 01:30:43.930
man.

3731
01:30:43.930 --> 01:30:47.800
They're just always trying to take their names down and go to this school and

3732
01:30:47.801 --> 01:30:48.880
just give him a wink.

3733
01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:51.730
The raddest thing is it actually,

3734
01:30:51.731 --> 01:30:54.050
it's a private school and I went and talked for career day,

3735
01:30:54.140 --> 01:30:54.800
<v 5>my school,</v>

3736
01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:57.890
and then I kind of told her my story about me coming up and everything and how

3737
01:30:57.891 --> 01:30:58.190
my name,

3738
01:30:58.190 --> 01:30:59.210
my real name is Jacob.

3739
01:30:59.211 --> 01:30:59.990
Of course I'll listeners,

3740
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:01.040
you don't know my true name,

3741
01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:02.330
not my true names,

3742
01:31:02.331 --> 01:31:02.631
Tito,

3743
01:31:02.631 --> 01:31:04.010
but my real name's Jacob,

3744
01:31:04.050 --> 01:31:04.883
my birth name.

3745
01:31:05.450 --> 01:31:05.730
<v 3>True.</v>

3746
01:31:05.730 --> 01:31:06.563
And a real name.

3747
01:31:06.810 --> 01:31:07.890
I only have a real name.

3748
01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:09.100
I have a face with him.

3749
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:09.631
What's your,

3750
01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:10.410
what's your fake name?

3751
01:31:10.410 --> 01:31:11.243
What's your stage?

3752
01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:12.000
Burbank.

3753
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:12.690
Bad boy.

3754
01:31:12.690 --> 01:31:13.523
Brian Redman.

3755
01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:15.460
Yeah,

3756
01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:17.850
that's a quadruple be right there.

3757
01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:26.070
But I watered the lawn after Seth before seven.

3758
01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:27.293
He'll give a fuck.

3759
01:31:27.450 --> 01:31:28.610
I don't give a fuck.

3760
01:31:29.670 --> 01:31:31.410
All kinds of town ordinances and shit,

3761
01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:32.550
but like my,

3762
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:34.620
my real name's Jacob in the Bible.

3763
01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:40.100
<v 5>Jacob rustled against an angel and Jacob lost to the angel and the angel save</v>

3764
01:31:40.651 --> 01:31:41.370
his life.

3765
01:31:41.370 --> 01:31:41.700
Well,

3766
01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:42.780
Russell and saved his life.

3767
01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:43.741
Wrestling,

3768
01:31:43.741 --> 01:31:44.574
saved my life.

3769
01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:46.350
My son name is Jacob.

3770
01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:48.020
He loves wrestling now.

3771
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:50.610
He just took second in the state just this year at 10 years old.

3772
01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:51.571
That's pretty awesome.

3773
01:31:51.571 --> 01:31:51.760
I know.

3774
01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:52.560
It's really awesome.

3775
01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:52.860
<v 3>I don't know.</v>

3776
01:31:52.860 --> 01:31:55.830
It has to do with some other dude named Jacob who was born a billion years ago.

3777
01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:57.100
Yeah or not.

3778
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:58.530
He wrestled against an angel.

3779
01:31:58.740 --> 01:31:59.500
Did he really do?

3780
01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:00.333
Yes.

3781
01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:01.233
<v 5>In the Bible read.</v>

3782
01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:01.990
Yeah.

3783
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.823
I don't think it happened.

3784
01:32:03.290 --> 01:32:04.660
You really thinking he wrestled the angel.

3785
01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:05.680
Of course he does.

3786
01:32:05.681 --> 01:32:07.460
Probably sleeping bag.

3787
01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:10.930
I had a crazy fucking dream and he told him he ate some mushrooms.

3788
01:32:10.931 --> 01:32:11.950
I'm like smoking some weed,

3789
01:32:11.951 --> 01:32:13.080
right dude,

3790
01:32:13.090 --> 01:32:13.440
I was,

3791
01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:15.340
I was wrestling on a dude with wings.

3792
01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:17.680
It was really fucked up because I just,

3793
01:32:17.681 --> 01:32:19.990
I just remembered that story and then it just,

3794
01:32:20.150 --> 01:32:20.420
I,

3795
01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:20.860
I,

3796
01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:21.850
I associate it and be,

3797
01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:22.231
like I said,

3798
01:32:22.231 --> 01:32:24.570
I'm not a Bible thumper person,

3799
01:32:24.610 --> 01:32:26.320
but that story just hit me,

3800
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:29.650
hit me riding home because wrestling saved my life and I made a shirt.

3801
01:32:29.651 --> 01:32:34.030
Actually people go to punishment.com and it says wrestling saved lives and the

3802
01:32:34.031 --> 01:32:35.140
rest of you have seen that shirt.

3803
01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:35.250
Oh,

3804
01:32:35.250 --> 01:32:36.940
I've seen a lot of people wearing it a little bit lately.

3805
01:32:38.110 --> 01:32:41.260
It's one of the cool things about punch mathletics he sponsored many fighters.

3806
01:32:41.290 --> 01:32:41.451
Yeah.

3807
01:32:41.451 --> 01:32:43.600
I to fire a lot of fighters wearing your shirts.

3808
01:32:43.670 --> 01:32:44.261
I tried to give him,

3809
01:32:44.261 --> 01:32:47.920
I give him an opportunity to know that they can make a piece of the shirts that

3810
01:32:47.921 --> 01:32:49.060
we'd make personally for them.

3811
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:52.930
We give them a big chunk so they could help promote and that's what it comes

3812
01:32:52.931 --> 01:32:53.530
down to.

3813
01:32:53.530 --> 01:32:56.140
I wanted to show guys as business wise to promote.

3814
01:32:56.141 --> 01:32:57.130
When you got to do to do it.

3815
01:32:57.310 --> 01:32:57.671
People say,

3816
01:32:57.671 --> 01:32:59.590
well I'm just gonna wear a shirt and I'm going to sell a bunch.

3817
01:32:59.610 --> 01:32:59.830
No,

3818
01:32:59.830 --> 01:33:00.820
you gotta get on Twitter,

3819
01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:01.990
you got to follow,

3820
01:33:01.991 --> 01:33:03.880
you've got to post pictures about it.

3821
01:33:03.881 --> 01:33:06.010
You've got to make the interest for the social media,

3822
01:33:06.011 --> 01:33:08.470
for people to understand you of who you truly are.

3823
01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:10.540
And I think that's what it really comes down to that I'm helped.

3824
01:33:10.590 --> 01:33:10.991
Now you,

3825
01:33:10.991 --> 01:33:13.180
you talked about counseling that you've gone through counseling.

3826
01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:15.490
Did you do any while you're fighting?

3827
01:33:15.491 --> 01:33:17.560
Did you do any sports psychology work?

3828
01:33:17.650 --> 01:33:17.981
Nothing.

3829
01:33:17.981 --> 01:33:18.470
No.

3830
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.730
No.

3831
01:33:18.730 --> 01:33:20.080
I tried it and when my,

3832
01:33:20.710 --> 01:33:21.491
when I got married,

3833
01:33:21.491 --> 01:33:23.140
I'm with my aunt star Kristen.

3834
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:28.350
We're going through a relationship counseling and I started to get soft I think,

3835
01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:34.600
cause I started realizing why I was reacting the way I was starting to get soft.

3836
01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:35.740
I thought,

3837
01:33:35.741 --> 01:33:36.970
I think it was just myself.

3838
01:33:36.971 --> 01:33:38.740
I started getting to my feeling,

3839
01:33:38.741 --> 01:33:39.311
touch,

3840
01:33:39.311 --> 01:33:39.630
you know,

3841
01:33:39.630 --> 01:33:39.940
my,

3842
01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:40.220
my,

3843
01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:41.980
my thought it was going to fuck you up as a fighter.

3844
01:33:41.981 --> 01:33:42.281
Yeah.

3845
01:33:42.281 --> 01:33:42.791
I thought it was,

3846
01:33:42.791 --> 01:33:43.624
I stopped

3847
01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:44.593
<v 0>Claris you know,</v>

3848
01:33:44.830 --> 01:33:46.120
I took yoga when I was young.

3849
01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:48.680
I stopped taking it because I thought if you were enlightened it would be bad

3850
01:33:48.681 --> 01:33:49.170
for you as a kid.

3851
01:33:49.170 --> 01:33:50.640
<v 5>Median it wouldn't be,</v>

3852
01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:52.970
you wouldn't be as fun because a lot of my fucking comedy,

3853
01:33:52.971 --> 01:33:54.940
it was like being mean about people.

3854
01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:57.290
Comedy is fucking funny.

3855
01:33:57.970 --> 01:33:58.803
I,

3856
01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:01.060
I've never laughed so fucking hard in my life.

3857
01:34:01.061 --> 01:34:01.840
That shit is funny.

3858
01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:02.051
Oh,

3859
01:34:02.051 --> 01:34:02.430
thank you.

3860
01:34:02.430 --> 01:34:02.841
You're funny.

3861
01:34:02.841 --> 01:34:03.510
For me,

3862
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:05.410
I know that that thing like,

3863
01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:06.370
you know,

3864
01:34:06.370 --> 01:34:06.881
for me,

3865
01:34:06.881 --> 01:34:07.510
uh,

3866
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:09.460
my child who was not nearly as hard as is

3867
01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:10.310
<v 0>yours a,</v>

3868
01:34:10.450 --> 01:34:11.590
but I had a bad dad.

3869
01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:13.750
My parents divorced when I was five.

3870
01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:15.551
My mom remarried.

3871
01:34:15.551 --> 01:34:16.384
My Stepdad,

3872
01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:17.710
who was a great guy.

3873
01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:20.440
So from seven on my childhood is pretty,

3874
01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:20.741
pretty.

3875
01:34:20.741 --> 01:34:21.490
God damn good.

3876
01:34:21.490 --> 01:34:21.890
You know,

3877
01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:22.631
everybody's Nice,

3878
01:34:22.631 --> 01:34:23.500
nobody beat me up.

3879
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:29.310
But my father was a terrible person and I have these crazy memories of my dad

3880
01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:30.910
beating up my mom.

3881
01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:35.050
And I didn't realize until I was a grown man that that was why I was angry all

3882
01:34:35.051 --> 01:34:35.471
the time.

3883
01:34:35.471 --> 01:34:36.910
I really didn't realize that,

3884
01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:37.810
you know,

3885
01:34:37.810 --> 01:34:38.643
you know,

3886
01:34:38.910 --> 01:34:40.330
a person looks at their father,

3887
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:41.021
a child,

3888
01:34:41.021 --> 01:34:41.854
especially a boy,

3889
01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:43.420
you look to this is,

3890
01:34:43.450 --> 01:34:45.040
this is the person has already done it.

3891
01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:46.090
This is my goal.

3892
01:34:46.210 --> 01:34:46.440
You know,

3893
01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:47.410
I want to be like him.

3894
01:34:47.411 --> 01:34:48.640
This is my superhero.

3895
01:34:49.090 --> 01:34:49.911
When you see a,

3896
01:34:49.911 --> 01:34:53.290
a terrible person place of that and you just feel like the,

3897
01:34:53.291 --> 01:34:56.950
the world fucked you with a shitty deck of cards,

3898
01:34:57.180 --> 01:34:58.350
you want to repair

3899
01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:02.000
<v 1>the rolled back by being in that same fucking person somehow or another.</v>

3900
01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:03.240
I'm very thankful.

3901
01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:08.240
<v 5>My Dad was actually good till I was about six because I remembered the loving</v>

3902
01:35:08.541 --> 01:35:10.010
feeling of my father.

3903
01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:15.460
But then the abstinence after I was six of my mother had my father.

3904
01:35:15.790 --> 01:35:16.623
Um,

3905
01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:17.360
and I,

3906
01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:22.190
I'm like talk to him and talking to my therapist and that's why I've always

3907
01:35:22.191 --> 01:35:23.690
looking for a mother figure around me.

3908
01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:25.670
I know Mike girlfriend,

3909
01:35:25.671 --> 01:35:26.180
Kristen,

3910
01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:26.500
I mean the,

3911
01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:27.333
I,

3912
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:29.380
I started dating her after my second year out of,

3913
01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:31.430
or my first year at high school and uh,

3914
01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:32.810
I was waiting the whole time,

3915
01:35:32.811 --> 01:35:33.231
you know what I mean?

3916
01:35:33.231 --> 01:35:35.730
It was just me and her and I was always looking for that motherfucker,

3917
01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:36.501
you know what I mean?

3918
01:35:36.501 --> 01:35:37.334
And gender together,

3919
01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:39.410
she's perfect for me.

3920
01:35:39.411 --> 01:35:40.011
I mean we are,

3921
01:35:40.011 --> 01:35:44.510
have the same associations in life coming up business wise are,

3922
01:35:44.511 --> 01:35:44.721
you know,

3923
01:35:44.721 --> 01:35:46.340
we're never supposed to be successful.

3924
01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:48.980
We didn't have loving parents and thought it ah,

3925
01:35:49.490 --> 01:35:52.700
but we still are missing that same type of role models in our life,

3926
01:35:52.701 --> 01:35:52.911
you know,

3927
01:35:52.911 --> 01:35:53.260
and her,

3928
01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:55.010
her mother died at the age of three.

3929
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:56.510
Her father was never around.

3930
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:57.200
Um,

3931
01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:02.200
so I think we just kind of work hard to be the best parents that week possibly

3932
01:36:02.661 --> 01:36:03.200
can be.

3933
01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:05.600
And I think work on each other and making that happen.

3934
01:36:05.601 --> 01:36:06.950
It is what it comes down to.

3935
01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:07.431
I think,

3936
01:36:07.431 --> 01:36:08.264
you know,

3937
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.810
being

3938
01:36:08.810 --> 01:36:09.620
<v 1>learning from it.</v>

3939
01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:09.801
Well,

3940
01:36:09.801 --> 01:36:10.131
you know,

3941
01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:11.330
also learning from,

3942
01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:12.770
how about you talking about it,

3943
01:36:12.771 --> 01:36:13.011
man.

3944
01:36:13.011 --> 01:36:13.191
You know,

3945
01:36:13.191 --> 01:36:16.130
this shit wasn't available when your parents were coming up,

3946
01:36:16.131 --> 01:36:17.390
nor when my parents were coming in.

3947
01:36:17.630 --> 01:36:20.930
We didn't have anybody sitting around talking really about relationships are

3948
01:36:20.931 --> 01:36:22.550
real about being raised by cons.

3949
01:36:22.670 --> 01:36:23.121
Dude,

3950
01:36:23.121 --> 01:36:23.541
seriously.

3951
01:36:23.541 --> 01:36:24.070
I mean,

3952
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:27.760
<v 5>and I mean in any people who are parents now who I fucked up,</v>

3953
01:36:27.761 --> 01:36:29.500
parents make a difference.

3954
01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:31.960
Don't keep that cycle going.

3955
01:36:32.210 --> 01:36:33.200
<v 1>Fuck the cycle.</v>

3956
01:36:33.201 --> 01:36:35.570
Fuck the cycle doesn't have to keep,

3957
01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:37.420
you can grow and learn.

3958
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:38.330
Grown learning,

3959
01:36:38.590 --> 01:36:39.000
green,

3960
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:39.833
move on.

3961
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:44.420
Find someone else who has a great family and try to be something like that.

3962
01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:44.901
Well,

3963
01:36:44.901 --> 01:36:45.201
this,

3964
01:36:45.201 --> 01:36:46.550
this conversation alone,

3965
01:36:46.551 --> 01:36:47.151
I'm sure,

3966
01:36:47.151 --> 01:36:47.540
look,

3967
01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:50.170
this podcast gets heard by a lot of people over the world.

3968
01:36:50.171 --> 01:36:52.040
I guarantee you it's going to speak to a lot of people.

3969
01:36:52.910 --> 01:36:53.630
<v 5>So you know,</v>

3970
01:36:53.630 --> 01:36:54.740
and like I said,

3971
01:36:54.741 --> 01:36:59.330
I can't rehearse this over and over and over and over again is be truthful to

3972
01:36:59.331 --> 01:37:02.540
yourself and don't step on people to get ahead.

3973
01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:04.580
And I'm telling you good things happen for that.

3974
01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:06.970
<v 1>Good things happen and you got to embrace the losses.</v>

3975
01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:10.500
You gotta embrace the losses that life hands you because you're not perfect.

3976
01:37:10.501 --> 01:37:11.041
No one is,

3977
01:37:11.041 --> 01:37:12.240
you're not born perfect.

3978
01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:15.780
You got to embrace the losses as far as the relationships he got to Britain.

3979
01:37:15.781 --> 01:37:18.820
Embrace him in your social life as well as embrace him in your,

3980
01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:19.890
your business life.

3981
01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:22.920
You got to learn and the only way to learn is to try and fail.

3982
01:37:23.010 --> 01:37:24.840
That's the only way and one way to do it,

3983
01:37:24.841 --> 01:37:25.111
man.

3984
01:37:25.111 --> 01:37:26.070
Just keep getting up,

3985
01:37:26.071 --> 01:37:27.030
keep moving forward,

3986
01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:27.630
learn,

3987
01:37:27.630 --> 01:37:28.290
grow,

3988
01:37:28.290 --> 01:37:30.210
continue to analyze yourself.

3989
01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:30.511
Right?

3990
01:37:30.511 --> 01:37:30.661
Yeah,

3991
01:37:30.661 --> 01:37:30.940
I know.

3992
01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:31.201
I mean,

3993
01:37:31.201 --> 01:37:32.070
it's a learning process.

3994
01:37:32.130 --> 01:37:32.963
I mean,

3995
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.541
like I say every,

3996
01:37:33.541 --> 01:37:34.160
every day,

3997
01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:34.950
you know,

3998
01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:35.783
test yourself.

3999
01:37:36.510 --> 01:37:38.820
What's beautiful in this day and age,

4000
01:37:38.850 --> 01:37:43.850
what's beautiful in this era of endless information is that kids of listening

4001
01:37:44.251 --> 01:37:44.821
right now,

4002
01:37:44.821 --> 01:37:48.960
people who you can influence and I guarantee you they're going to get something

4003
01:37:48.961 --> 01:37:49.310
out of this.

4004
01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:50.590
I guarantee you when parents,

4005
01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:53.070
I get indirectly even old people,

4006
01:37:53.071 --> 01:37:53.311
man,

4007
01:37:53.311 --> 01:37:55.860
no one's no one's too old to old to and Brighton.

4008
01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:57.720
When I did a the apprentice,

4009
01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:00.030
I had a whole different demographic.

4010
01:38:00.031 --> 01:38:00.721
When I did that show,

4011
01:38:00.721 --> 01:38:01.051
I was like,

4012
01:38:01.051 --> 01:38:01.884
Holy Shit.

4013
01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:06.180
I walked in the airport and you're just like 80 year old old ladies,

4014
01:38:06.210 --> 01:38:06.780
Kyla Zoopla.

4015
01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:07.830
Hi Tito Howard

4016
01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:11.820
was such a nice guy.

4017
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:16.730
I started watching the ultimate fighter and person y.

4018
01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:19.080
That's my fight game.

4019
01:38:19.081 --> 01:38:19.800
He was like,

4020
01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:21.650
but you're still rhythm mass guy.

4021
01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:23.660
Thank you.

4022
01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:26.830
Very [inaudible] on the celebrity apprentice with a Lennox Lewis.

4023
01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:28.550
Who wanted that y'all uh,

4024
01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:30.150
Pierce Morgan wanted that year.

4025
01:38:30.810 --> 01:38:31.591
Lennox Lewis.

4026
01:38:31.591 --> 01:38:32.424
What was he like?

4027
01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:33.330
He's a cool cat.

4028
01:38:33.370 --> 01:38:33.560
He's,

4029
01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:33.921
he's,

4030
01:38:33.921 --> 01:38:34.754
he had another fight.

4031
01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:35.690
He's a bad motherfucker.

4032
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:36.750
He laid back cool,

4033
01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:37.820
nice guy.

4034
01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:39.120
And when not part of the couple of times.

4035
01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:40.081
He's a cool dude.

4036
01:38:40.081 --> 01:38:40.381
Really,

4037
01:38:40.381 --> 01:38:40.681
really,

4038
01:38:40.681 --> 01:38:40.921
really,

4039
01:38:40.921 --> 01:38:44.280
really cool guy that's playing bad motherfucker.

4040
01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:45.181
He's calm,

4041
01:38:45.181 --> 01:38:45.730
he's calm,

4042
01:38:45.730 --> 01:38:46.340
collective.

4043
01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:47.041
He's just like,

4044
01:38:47.041 --> 01:38:47.874
cool.

4045
01:38:48.190 --> 01:38:50.010
He just a cool black fuck.

4046
01:38:50.011 --> 01:38:50.490
Just like,

4047
01:38:50.490 --> 01:38:50.941
and he's just,

4048
01:38:50.941 --> 01:38:51.601
he's cool man.

4049
01:38:51.601 --> 01:38:53.790
He's really loved about Lennox Lewis Madison.

4050
01:38:53.791 --> 01:38:55.560
He had some fucking bad losses,

4051
01:38:55.561 --> 01:38:59.480
like hosteen rock on knocked him out like he got cut and here's that Kodak and

4052
01:38:59.481 --> 01:39:00.450
come back and yeah,

4053
01:39:00.451 --> 01:39:02.370
I mean he was a real human dude.

4054
01:39:02.371 --> 01:39:02.731
He wasn't,

4055
01:39:02.731 --> 01:39:03.090
uh,

4056
01:39:03.090 --> 01:39:04.500
like when Tyson was the king,

4057
01:39:04.501 --> 01:39:05.200
it was like,

4058
01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:08.310
it was Tyson to the destroyer and then it all fell apart.

4059
01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:09.930
But with Lennox Lewis is like,

4060
01:39:09.931 --> 01:39:10.291
you know,

4061
01:39:10.291 --> 01:39:13.060
like he stumbled and he got back up by humble.

4062
01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:14.790
Bladimir Klitschko is another one.

4063
01:39:14.791 --> 01:39:16.440
You got stopped a bunch of times.

4064
01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:18.210
Corey Sanders knocked him out,

4065
01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:18.571
you know,

4066
01:39:18.571 --> 01:39:21.090
it looked like it looked like he was losing it.

4067
01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:24.060
It looked like Vladimir was never going to be the dominant guy than he is today.

4068
01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:24.600
Yeah,

4069
01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:26.310
I love a even an over him store.

4070
01:39:26.310 --> 01:39:27.840
I love a guy moves forward.

4071
01:39:27.841 --> 01:39:29.550
This Tito and the celebrity apprentice,

4072
01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:31.140
is that like,

4073
01:39:31.230 --> 01:39:32.880
it was a lot of work,

4074
01:39:32.881 --> 01:39:33.241
man.

4075
01:39:33.241 --> 01:39:35.010
That was me walking out and let me tell you,

4076
01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:37.590
after eight straight weeks,

4077
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:38.760
I was like,

4078
01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:41.940
thank God I'm going home right now because I had an opportunity to have an

4079
01:39:41.970 --> 01:39:46.320
opportunity to sell out and step over Amarosa call around and just make it look

4080
01:39:46.321 --> 01:39:46.891
like shit.

4081
01:39:46.891 --> 01:39:47.720
And I didn't.

4082
01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:48.570
I was straight up,

4083
01:39:48.571 --> 01:39:48.840
dude.

4084
01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:49.430
You know,

4085
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:51.480
and I think um,

4086
01:39:51.810 --> 01:39:53.610
Trump's seen that Trump goes,

4087
01:39:53.611 --> 01:39:54.444
he knew what to you though.

4088
01:39:54.690 --> 01:39:55.620
You're an awesome guy.

4089
01:39:55.650 --> 01:39:56.910
You got some great things ahead of you.

4090
01:39:57.340 --> 01:39:57.520
Um,

4091
01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:59.580
cause she didn't call Amarosa if you,

4092
01:39:59.581 --> 01:40:00.540
you're really,

4093
01:40:00.541 --> 01:40:01.980
if you were going to serve the public,

4094
01:40:01.981 --> 01:40:02.701
you should call her.

4095
01:40:02.701 --> 01:40:03.750
I was like chucked her out.

4096
01:40:05.010 --> 01:40:06.060
We had around fear factor.

4097
01:40:06.061 --> 01:40:06.781
That bitch is crazy.

4098
01:40:06.781 --> 01:40:07.261
Yeah,

4099
01:40:07.261 --> 01:40:08.094
she was.

4100
01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:10.350
She's a cool Stephen Baldwin,

4101
01:40:10.351 --> 01:40:11.430
Steven Blah Blah.

4102
01:40:11.770 --> 01:40:12.880
She's actually a cool lady.

4103
01:40:12.881 --> 01:40:13.070
Dude.

4104
01:40:13.070 --> 01:40:13.591
She was actually,

4105
01:40:13.591 --> 01:40:14.730
it was a cool lady.

4106
01:40:15.060 --> 01:40:16.200
But when the cameras came on,

4107
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:17.220
she was,

4108
01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:18.053
she's hustling.

4109
01:40:18.770 --> 01:40:19.603
Yeah,

4110
01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:20.260
just hustling.

4111
01:40:20.260 --> 01:40:24.090
Steve Baldwin tried to sell you on Jesus for about a half a second,

4112
01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:28.021
but not really.

4113
01:40:28.021 --> 01:40:28.231
No.

4114
01:40:28.231 --> 01:40:29.070
He's a cool dude.

4115
01:40:29.071 --> 01:40:31.290
And then he realized that I was with Jenna and he was like,

4116
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:31.770
okay,

4117
01:40:31.770 --> 01:40:32.131
who's that?

4118
01:40:32.131 --> 01:40:32.964
Pretty girl.

4119
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:34.290
The blonde.

4120
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.621
Oh,

4121
01:40:34.621 --> 01:40:35.550
that's his daughter.

4122
01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:36.290
That's his daughter.

4123
01:40:36.290 --> 01:40:36.470
Yeah.

4124
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:38.460
I dropped my daughter and she's a really cool girl.

4125
01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:38.851
Really,

4126
01:40:38.851 --> 01:40:40.280
really nice girls since it seems her,

4127
01:40:40.281 --> 01:40:41.100
it really cool.

4128
01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:43.920
That'd be a great Trump's daughter.

4129
01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:46.080
And who are all the other people that,

4130
01:40:46.090 --> 01:40:46.800
who is that?

4131
01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:48.540
She's a model supermodel.

4132
01:40:48.630 --> 01:40:48.960
Um,

4133
01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:50.150
that was some guy from,

4134
01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:50.760
Oh,

4135
01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:50.951

4137
01:40:52.850 --> 01:40:53.510
He wanted that.

4138
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:54.343
He really

4139
01:40:55.210 --> 01:40:55.880
<v 3>is he cool guy?</v>

4140
01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:55.991
Yeah.

4141
01:40:55.991 --> 01:40:56.860
He's a pretty cool cat.

4142
01:40:57.010 --> 01:40:57.641
He's smart.

4143
01:40:57.641 --> 01:40:58.750
He's a very,

4144
01:40:58.751 --> 01:40:59.401
very crafted,

4145
01:40:59.401 --> 01:41:00.250
you did for sure.

4146
01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:00.401
Yeah.

4147
01:41:00.401 --> 01:41:01.780
He's like the Anti Larry King.

4148
01:41:01.810 --> 01:41:03.970
It's like completely like he really is paying attention.

4149
01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.073
Yeah,

4150
01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:06.793
no,

4151
01:41:07.090 --> 01:41:08.110
he's a smart guy,

4152
01:41:08.111 --> 01:41:08.321
dude.

4153
01:41:08.321 --> 01:41:08.681
I'm sorry.

4154
01:41:08.681 --> 01:41:09.230
He's crafty.

4155
01:41:09.230 --> 01:41:09.800
<v 4>He comes from,</v>

4156
01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:11.570
he has some great ideas is we're uh,

4157
01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:12.680
uh,

4158
01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:13.311
when he was a,

4159
01:41:13.311 --> 01:41:15.230
was a project manager or whatever,

4160
01:41:15.231 --> 01:41:15.980
but uh,

4161
01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:16.440
he was a good,

4162
01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:17.121
but really good dude.

4163
01:41:17.121 --> 01:41:18.110
He has some good connections.

4164
01:41:18.111 --> 01:41:19.790
He has some really great donations.

4165
01:41:19.791 --> 01:41:23.600
But to me on that show was put a light on the MMA of course.

4166
01:41:23.601 --> 01:41:24.890
But for charity,

4167
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:25.670
what am I trying to,

4168
01:41:25.670 --> 01:41:27.080
Saint Jude's Children's hospital.

4169
01:41:27.170 --> 01:41:27.531
Um,

4170
01:41:27.531 --> 01:41:28.550
I raised over,

4171
01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:31.490
I think it was $90,000,

4172
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:32.960
just from the show.

4173
01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:33.710
Um,

4174
01:41:33.710 --> 01:41:34.281
but then,

4175
01:41:34.281 --> 01:41:34.970
um,

4176
01:41:34.970 --> 01:41:38.090
$100,000 were donated to,

4177
01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:41.360
was it saint Jude children's Hospital under my name.

4178
01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:43.970
So I mean raising that much money for Saint Jude's,

4179
01:41:43.971 --> 01:41:45.140
I was going to biggest thing to help kids,

4180
01:41:45.141 --> 01:41:45.301
man.

4181
01:41:45.301 --> 01:41:45.610
I want him.

4182
01:41:45.610 --> 01:41:46.443
That's awesome man.

4183
01:41:46.490 --> 01:41:47.323
That's awesome.

4184
01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:49.550
I think this podcast is going to help a lot of people,

4185
01:41:49.551 --> 01:41:49.910
man.

4186
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:50.560
I think,

4187
01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:52.830
I think people understand,

4188
01:41:52.970 --> 01:41:53.271
you know,

4189
01:41:53.271 --> 01:41:53.931
where I come from,

4190
01:41:53.931 --> 01:41:54.141
you know,

4191
01:41:54.141 --> 01:41:54.480
and I know,

4192
01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:58.430
I think people would get so associated automatically with the ultimate ultimate

4193
01:41:58.431 --> 01:41:59.090
fighting.

4194
01:41:59.090 --> 01:41:59.640
Um,

4195
01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:01.300
<v 3>well it's point to,</v>

4196
01:42:01.330 --> 01:42:02.200
it's so easy to point,

4197
01:42:02.201 --> 01:42:02.800
fuck,

4198
01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.780
this guy sucks and it's got,

4199
01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:06.481
it's got to,

4200
01:42:06.481 --> 01:42:08.680
so it's so easy for people to do that.

4201
01:42:08.710 --> 01:42:11.500
People don't understand it until they get in the cage and they fight when they

4202
01:42:11.501 --> 01:42:13.380
get in the gym and lift weights.

4203
01:42:13.381 --> 01:42:13.581
Like,

4204
01:42:13.581 --> 01:42:13.780
Oh,

4205
01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:14.980
I'm sore right now.

4206
01:42:18.990 --> 01:42:19.210
Oh,

4207
01:42:19.210 --> 01:42:19.700
I fucking,

4208
01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:21.280
I ran three miles a day.

4209
01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:21.881
I'm sorry.

4210
01:42:21.881 --> 01:42:22.341
You don't know what,

4211
01:42:22.341 --> 01:42:23.081
sorry as well.

4212
01:42:23.081 --> 01:42:23.914
Not only you,

4213
01:42:23.930 --> 01:42:26.110
you came along in the time where the,

4214
01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:29.370
the ultimate fighter didn't exist or you know,

4215
01:42:29.530 --> 01:42:31.000
ultimate fighting and MMA was,

4216
01:42:31.001 --> 01:42:31.511
it was in,

4217
01:42:31.511 --> 01:42:35.410
its like really its infancy when you came along but you also came along in an

4218
01:42:35.411 --> 01:42:37.180
age where the Internet was at its infancy.

4219
01:42:37.530 --> 01:42:42.530
It was the first time we're athletes could get shit on every day by a million

4220
01:42:42.551 --> 01:42:44.720
youtube people and Twitter people.

4221
01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:46.540
Nothing that I think too,

4222
01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:46.980
I said it

4223
01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:50.160
<v 4>fighters were in the is don't listen to the fans,</v>

4224
01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:51.873
<v 3>don't listen to them.</v>

4225
01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:53.030
Be telling you man cause it,

4226
01:42:53.031 --> 01:42:53.830
it can,

4227
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:54.670
it got to me,

4228
01:42:54.671 --> 01:42:55.930
I got to a point where I was like,

4229
01:42:55.931 --> 01:42:57.820
you know what and I have,

4230
01:42:57.890 --> 01:42:59.260
I've I block people

4231
01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:00.133
<v 4>like no other,</v>

4232
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:01.430
no the negative stuff.

4233
01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:02.293
I,

4234
01:43:02.330 --> 01:43:03.570
since the bait are fine,

4235
01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:05.480
I have no more negative stuff.

4236
01:43:05.481 --> 01:43:06.650
I don't battle back and forth.

4237
01:43:06.651 --> 01:43:07.041
People,

4238
01:43:07.041 --> 01:43:07.740
I don't call people

4239
01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:08.281
<v 3>loud,</v>

4240
01:43:08.281 --> 01:43:09.210
I don't say shit.

4241
01:43:09.211 --> 01:43:10.090
I just don't wear the,

4242
01:43:10.230 --> 01:43:12.250
I just block them or reading them.

4243
01:43:12.251 --> 01:43:12.540
Listen,

4244
01:43:12.540 --> 01:43:13.530
just block them.

4245
01:43:14.690 --> 01:43:17.180
<v 4>Fuck the negative all about positive baby.</v>

4246
01:43:17.181 --> 01:43:17.931
That's what I'm talking about.

4247
01:43:17.931 --> 01:43:20.840
And I live in my life since like that in life has been so much better because

4248
01:43:20.841 --> 01:43:23.690
when you involve yourself into a positive environment,

4249
01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:26.410
it just spawns more positive.

4250
01:43:26.490 --> 01:43:27.690
While his positivity and it,

4251
01:43:27.691 --> 01:43:30.020
it sounds kind of Hippie,

4252
01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:31.160
but it's true.

4253
01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:31.890
It's true.

4254
01:43:31.890 --> 01:43:32.420
It is.

4255
01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:35.210
If you involve herself enough negative energy,

4256
01:43:35.630 --> 01:43:38.570
negative is going to come about you and everything around you can see it goes,

4257
01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:39.700
God man,

4258
01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:40.790
this stuff won't stop.

4259
01:43:40.791 --> 01:43:41.650
Leave me alone.

4260
01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:42.710
It's like Nolan on it.

4261
01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:43.280
Yeah.

4262
01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:43.610
You know,

4263
01:43:43.610 --> 01:43:46.300
I was it right before the Bader fight.

4264
01:43:46.301 --> 01:43:47.870
It was funny cause everyone,

4265
01:43:48.010 --> 01:43:48.530
Dane,

4266
01:43:48.530 --> 01:43:49.820
every one,

4267
01:43:49.821 --> 01:43:52.160
and we're just talking and just you're

4268
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:52.791
<v 5>done.</v>

4269
01:43:52.791 --> 01:43:53.191
And Dot.

4270
01:43:53.191 --> 01:43:53.800
A.

4271
01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:53.801
Dot.

4272
01:43:53.801 --> 01:43:54.321
And I just,

4273
01:43:54.321 --> 01:43:55.640
you know what I'm believing in myself.

4274
01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:57.170
I remember just thinking myself,

4275
01:43:57.770 --> 01:43:58.610
I'm going to leave myself.

4276
01:43:58.670 --> 01:44:00.890
No more fans talked.

4277
01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:02.410
I can't listen to that.

4278
01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:02.841
I just,

4279
01:44:02.841 --> 01:44:03.860
I just say,

4280
01:44:03.861 --> 01:44:04.580
you know what?

4281
01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:05.690
I'll watch to those Bader fight.

4282
01:44:05.691 --> 01:44:06.550
I remember doing an interview,

4283
01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:07.251
him going,

4284
01:44:07.251 --> 01:44:08.720
the guy's so what are you gonna do after this fight?

4285
01:44:08.721 --> 01:44:09.750
Since your career is going to be done.

4286
01:44:09.751 --> 01:44:10.584
And I looked down at my goal.

4287
01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:12.080
When I win,

4288
01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:14.030
you'll see like a wet,

4289
01:44:14.090 --> 01:44:15.230
I go watch when I,

4290
01:44:15.231 --> 01:44:17.780
when you'll see it was actually showdown Joe from Canada.

4291
01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:20.900
I go and when I win you'll see and no one understood it.

4292
01:44:20.901 --> 01:44:21.090
I go,

4293
01:44:21.090 --> 01:44:21.710
just watch.

4294
01:44:21.710 --> 01:44:22.543
Watch what I win.

4295
01:44:22.730 --> 01:44:25.820
How annoying is it talking to reporters that are telling you they're going to

4296
01:44:25.821 --> 01:44:28.370
lose that ignorance?

4297
01:44:28.670 --> 01:44:29.690
Ignorance is bliss.

4298
01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:30.501
It's so stupid.

4299
01:44:30.501 --> 01:44:31.011
First of all,

4300
01:44:31.011 --> 01:44:31.910
like people always say,

4301
01:44:32.090 --> 01:44:33.470
you know what's going to happen this fight.

4302
01:44:33.710 --> 01:44:34.610
I always say,

4303
01:44:34.910 --> 01:44:35.271
uh,

4304
01:44:35.271 --> 01:44:35.900
I don't know.

4305
01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:36.740
That's why they got to fight.

4306
01:44:37.150 --> 01:44:39.420
The only reason to watch it because you don't know.

4307
01:44:39.550 --> 01:44:40.150
You don't know.

4308
01:44:40.150 --> 01:44:41.900
You don't know what the fuck is going to happen.

4309
01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:42.401
That's my thing.

4310
01:44:42.401 --> 01:44:46.730
I'm on UFC and I think that's why Dana and Joseph to do such a great job.

4311
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:48.920
It's not like boxing fight.

4312
01:44:48.970 --> 01:44:49.803
It are built.

4313
01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:51.800
You wouldn't see a UFC guy built.

4314
01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:53.053
No Way.

4315
01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:56.390
Boxers are built to be 28 now.

4316
01:44:57.380 --> 01:44:59.300
When you say built for the uninitiated,

4317
01:44:59.301 --> 01:45:02.690
what you were saying is the set up with easy fights set up with these other

4318
01:45:02.691 --> 01:45:07.691
slowly tested to slowly tested and there were 28 now and they're built to become

4319
01:45:08.121 --> 01:45:13.121
world champions and they're building them at least to have a good financial run

4320
01:45:13.791 --> 01:45:14.624
at the title.

4321
01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:15.530
Yes.

4322
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:18.290
Highly respected rank contender.

4323
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:19.161
Exactly.

4324
01:45:19.161 --> 01:45:19.994
And it's smart.

4325
01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:21.980
That's smart business.

4326
01:45:22.580 --> 01:45:26.840
If there's two situations you can have a WWE or are you going to have a

4327
01:45:26.841 --> 01:45:27.674
professional wrestling?

4328
01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:28.210
Right,

4329
01:45:28.210 --> 01:45:28.431
right.

4330
01:45:28.431 --> 01:45:28.731
Excuse me.

4331
01:45:28.731 --> 01:45:32.600
A professional boxer as in WWE,

4332
01:45:33.290 --> 01:45:38.000
they're washed and guys in and out so fast that you don't really get a chance

4333
01:45:38.001 --> 01:45:38.180
to,

4334
01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:38.331
well,

4335
01:45:38.331 --> 01:45:39.290
it's real though.

4336
01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:40.160
It's not fighting,

4337
01:45:40.190 --> 01:45:42.440
but still it's making money.

4338
01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:43.431
Okay,

4339
01:45:43.431 --> 01:45:44.180
I see what you're saying.

4340
01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:47.360
So they're having guys that are getting put in every single week while different

4341
01:45:47.361 --> 01:45:47.691
guys.

4342
01:45:47.691 --> 01:45:52.070
You're not building one single person now as inboxing.

4343
01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:55.760
How you have guys like del La Jolla guys have like golly.

4344
01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:57.590
And they were built it coming up.

4345
01:45:57.650 --> 01:45:58.040
You know,

4346
01:45:58.040 --> 01:45:58.421
Delaware,

4347
01:45:58.421 --> 01:46:03.421
he me as he fights his first six seven eight five ten five 15 fights and all of

4348
01:46:03.591 --> 01:46:07.910
a sudden when he's 20 and then now he starts fighting guys who at the tail end

4349
01:46:07.911 --> 01:46:10.970
of their career now he's knocking guys out a holy shit.

4350
01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:11.841
We also,

4351
01:46:11.841 --> 01:46:16.670
I think you have to take into account that boxing has been around for so long.

4352
01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:20.660
They really have their situation down as far as like how to develop a fighter

4353
01:46:20.661 --> 01:46:21.440
correctly.

4354
01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:24.650
If you wanted to look at it from the point of view of the fighter,

4355
01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:26.180
that's the way to do it.

4356
01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:31.240
I mean the way to do it is to be tested slowly where you know or you know

4357
01:46:31.551 --> 01:46:33.550
there's this fucking John Jones type dudes.

4358
01:46:33.551 --> 01:46:38.551
It just jump into the deep end of the pool and dominators exceptions for guys

4359
01:46:38.931 --> 01:46:39.410
like that.

4360
01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:42.710
Guys like John Jones is just a tremendous athlete.

4361
01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:44.930
That guy respect for that guy like no other,

4362
01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:46.020
he's amazing.

4363
01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:47.540
I watch the kid and I'm just like,

4364
01:46:48.110 --> 01:46:50.520
is it weird seeing the next level coming up,

4365
01:46:50.521 --> 01:46:52.170
like seeing the Rory Macdonald's.

4366
01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:52.860
It's crazy.

4367
01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:53.311
It's cool.

4368
01:46:53.311 --> 01:46:54.120
It's good to see you.

4369
01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:54.591
It's wild.

4370
01:46:54.591 --> 01:46:55.830
It was cool because you can go to the river.

4371
01:46:55.831 --> 01:46:57.180
Donald come up to me or like you man,

4372
01:46:57.181 --> 01:47:01.440
I've been watching you since I've been like six years old and like fuck really a

4373
01:47:01.441 --> 01:47:01.980

01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:02.590
Mike.

4375
01:47:02.590 --> 01:47:03.421
Mike McDonald.

4376
01:47:03.421 --> 01:47:06.060
I think he's only 21 maybe 20.

4377
01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.781
It's crazy.

4378
01:47:06.781 --> 01:47:10.060
It's like kids come to my gym and her train set in Huntington beach and they

4379
01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:13.110
their 10 year old kids who do kickboxing,

4380
01:47:13.111 --> 01:47:15.120
Jujitsu and they're doing an MMA classes now.

4381
01:47:15.121 --> 01:47:15.601
I'm just like,

4382
01:47:15.601 --> 01:47:16.231

4383
01:47:16.231 --> 01:47:17.760
Me and the parents are calling.

4384
01:47:17.761 --> 01:47:18.120

4388

You do the UFC fighting style at your gym?

4389
01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:26.010
You mean MMA?

4390
01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:26.880
Mixed martial arts?

4391
01:47:26.970 --> 01:47:27.271
Yes.

4392
01:47:27.271 --> 01:47:28.104
Do you do that?

4393
01:47:28.290 --> 01:47:28.531

4394
01:47:28.531 --> 01:47:28.770

4395
01:47:28.770 --> 01:47:29.940
Are we're bringing our kid down.

4396
01:47:29.970 --> 01:47:30.450

4398
01:47:33.870 --> 01:47:34.420

4400
01:47:37.390 --> 01:47:38.090
Oh that's bad.

4401

And so it's in Huntington beach.

4402
01:47:40.201 --> 01:47:40.590

4403
01:47:40.590 --> 01:47:41.580
Well how can they find it?

4404
01:47:41.581 --> 01:47:42.440
What is the upside?

4405
01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:46.700
It's actually punched for training center.com punishment training center doc.

4406
01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:50.040
So that is also one of the fucking cool things about the sport.

4407
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.251
It's a,

4408
01:47:50.251 --> 01:47:55.210
you can go and take classes your kid can from a former world champion.

4409
01:47:55.211 --> 01:47:55.800
Yeah.

4410
01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:56.460
What mean?

4411
01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:57.720
That's amazing to me.

4412
01:47:57.860 --> 01:47:58.820
It's just like I say,

4413
01:47:58.821 --> 01:47:59.080
I,

4414
01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:00.810
I've always wanted to be a coach.

4415
01:48:01.050 --> 01:48:01.883
Um,

4416
01:48:02.010 --> 01:48:02.410
I love,

4417
01:48:02.410 --> 01:48:02.940
I love it.

4418
01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:03.540
I dig it.

4419
01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:05.060
I love seeing the kid progress.

4420
01:48:05.070 --> 01:48:05.281
You know,

4421
01:48:05.281 --> 01:48:07.500
I remember when I first started at marina high school,

4422
01:48:07.530 --> 01:48:08.610
we were last in the league.

4423
01:48:08.930 --> 01:48:09.300
Um,

4424
01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:10.640
I was there for two years and when I,

4425
01:48:10.641 --> 01:48:14.760
when I left for a second in the lake and just to watch a kid progress and just

4426
01:48:14.761 --> 01:48:19.761
seeing his attitude and just how they respond to things and from the negative to

4427
01:48:20.221 --> 01:48:22.500
the positive and just being in an environment around them,

4428
01:48:22.501 --> 01:48:22.981
they're just like,

4429
01:48:22.981 --> 01:48:23.341
wow.

4430
01:48:23.341 --> 01:48:25.960
Like it's crazy if you are young boxer.

4431
01:48:26.350 --> 01:48:27.450
Oh beautiful.

4432
01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:29.460
And I painted myself nice ass place.

4433
01:48:29.660 --> 01:48:29.880
No,

4434
01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:30.990
I painted myself.

4435
01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:32.210
You painted that plan.

4436
01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:32.991
There's a floor.

4437
01:48:32.991 --> 01:48:34.080
See the red formal left,

4438
01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:35.220
the all the red flooring.

4439
01:48:35.221 --> 01:48:36.730
I did all the red and that's carpet on the right.

4440
01:48:36.731 --> 01:48:37.320
And that's all like,

4441
01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:37.771
Holy Shit.

4442
01:48:37.771 --> 01:48:39.000
That place is fucking huge.

4443
01:48:39.001 --> 01:48:40.020
How many squares?

4444
01:48:40.021 --> 01:48:42.360
She said it's actually a 10,000 square feet,

4445
01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:43.591
if that's what she said.

4446
01:48:43.591 --> 01:48:44.670
She's talking about her pussy.

4447
01:48:44.671 --> 01:48:45.121
Cause I said,

4448
01:48:45.121 --> 01:48:46.710
that place is fucking huge.

4449
01:48:46.990 --> 01:48:47.821
There's nothing said that.

4450
01:48:47.821 --> 01:48:48.540
That was huge.

4451
01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:49.610
Now I said that place is fine.

4452
01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:51.300
I think to those huge almost works.

4453
01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:52.973
Sound good though.

4454
01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:54.860
That's a massive fucking Gerrity.

4455
01:48:54.861 --> 01:48:55.041
Yeah,

4456
01:48:55.041 --> 01:48:55.231
I know.

4457
01:48:55.231 --> 01:48:56.160
But the color itself,

4458
01:48:56.161 --> 01:48:56.431
I won't,

4459
01:48:56.431 --> 01:48:56.611

4460
01:48:56.611 --> 01:48:57.061

4461
01:48:57.061 --> 01:48:57.331
black,

4462
01:48:57.331 --> 01:48:57.691

4464
01:48:57.891 --> 01:48:58.650
I,

4465
01:48:58.650 --> 01:48:59.490
I really just kind of,

4466
01:48:59.491 --> 01:49:00.211
I put my heart into it,

4467
01:49:00.211 --> 01:49:00.370

01:49:28.801 --> 01:49:30.120
The women come in and do kickboxing.

4487
01:49:30.121 --> 01:49:30.931
It's like all of a sudden the girls,

4488
01:49:30.931 --> 01:49:32.160
now that's a rad thing.

4489
01:49:32.170 --> 01:49:34.200
The girls come in and then I want to do MMA fight and it's like,

4490
01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:35.450
girl,

4491
01:49:35.450 --> 01:49:35.850
like,

4492
01:49:35.850 --> 01:49:36.061
no,

4493
01:49:36.061 --> 01:49:36.980
but I want to do it my fine.

4494
01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.330
I don't be like really rosy contact.

4495
01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:41.700
Well,

4496
01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:43.160
you stuck to Huntington Beach House.

4497
01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:44.540
I ain't going no where.

4498
01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:45.220
You gotta understand.

4499
01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:45.530
I,

4500
01:49:45.530 --> 01:49:47.290
when I lived in Huntington,

4501
01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:48.173
um,

4502
01:49:48.910 --> 01:49:52.270
<v 4>from the age of seven to 13,</v>

4503
01:49:52.271 --> 01:49:53.770
I moved to Santa Ana and that was,

4504
01:49:53.771 --> 01:49:55.000
my parents had the drug problem.

4505
01:49:55.001 --> 01:49:55.834
I would be Santa Ana.

4506
01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:56.351
And then,

4507
01:49:56.351 --> 01:49:57.100
um,

4508
01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:57.810
I actually,

4509
01:49:57.810 --> 01:49:58.750
when I was 13,

4510
01:49:58.751 --> 01:50:01.690
my mother separate as my father and she got remarried and moved me back to

4511
01:50:01.691 --> 01:50:02.524
Huntington.

4512
01:50:02.770 --> 01:50:03.603
And um,

4513
01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:04.960
all the time I grew up,

4514
01:50:05.020 --> 01:50:07.210
all the kids lived in the Harvard heights and harbor and all the rich,

4515
01:50:07.211 --> 01:50:08.044
prissy kids.

4516
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:10.600
And I remember fishing on one of the docs back there.

4517
01:50:10.601 --> 01:50:10.961
And I was like,

4518
01:50:10.961 --> 01:50:11.860
one day guys,

4519
01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:14.860
guys hold patient with my friend Dave caudal,

4520
01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:15.753
who's a friend of mine.

4521
01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:16.271
I go,

4522
01:50:16.271 --> 01:50:18.250
one day I'm going to buy a house here with the,

4523
01:50:18.251 --> 01:50:19.360
we call shut the fuck up.

4524
01:50:20.410 --> 01:50:22.050
That's what ever I go,

4525
01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:22.661
dude,

4526
01:50:22.661 --> 01:50:23.141
I'm serious.

4527
01:50:23.141 --> 01:50:24.610
One day I'm going to buy a house here.

4528
01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:27.250
Well we shot this bad blood.

4529
01:50:27.251 --> 01:50:29.350
A DVD would be in chuck.

4530
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:31.451
They shot it.

4531
01:50:31.451 --> 01:50:35.140
And I told that story and he was with me on the bug.

4532
01:50:35.470 --> 01:50:36.303
And uh,

4533
01:50:36.350 --> 01:50:37.450
the week prior to that,

4534
01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:38.470
I took all my bud.

4535
01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:39.100
We would fish,

4536
01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:39.561
cause God,

4537
01:50:39.561 --> 01:50:41.980
do you remember that one time they were sitting with fucking doctor her pitch

4538
01:50:41.981 --> 01:50:42.814
for bat rays.

4539
01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:44.380
You told me you're gonna get a house here.

4540
01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:45.190
Yeah.

4541
01:50:45.190 --> 01:50:45.370
Fuck,

4542
01:50:45.370 --> 01:50:46.091
I never forgot that.

4543
01:50:46.091 --> 01:50:46.421
And he goes,

4544
01:50:46.421 --> 01:50:47.254
dude,

4545
01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:49.120
that is crazy shit.

4546
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:50.740
But it's just one of those things.

4547
01:50:50.741 --> 01:50:51.850
And I'm not leaving Huntington.

4548
01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:52.780
I live in the harbor.

4549
01:50:52.781 --> 01:50:53.710
I own a fishing boat.

4550
01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:55.630
I now,

4551
01:50:55.631 --> 01:50:56.740
my kids are the ritual,

4552
01:50:56.741 --> 01:50:57.280
the prosecutors,

4553
01:50:57.280 --> 01:50:58.270
but he's not a prissy kids.

4554
01:50:58.271 --> 01:50:59.890
They're the rich little rich kid that,

4555
01:50:59.891 --> 01:51:00.724
you know,

4556
01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:01.830
but it's just an,

4557
01:51:01.831 --> 01:51:02.501
an opportunity,

4558
01:51:02.501 --> 01:51:03.110
you know,

4559
01:51:03.110 --> 01:51:06.670
I'm changing the cycle and I look at it as I worked hard to get wearing them

4560
01:51:06.671 --> 01:51:07.030
today.

4561
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:08.950
You know what's so great about Huntington Beach?

4562
01:51:09.930 --> 01:51:10.763
No crime.

4563
01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:12.371
Crime was very,

4564
01:51:12.371 --> 01:51:13.204
very like,

4565
01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:16.450
I think it was 93.

4566
01:51:16.510 --> 01:51:20.500
[inaudible] 94 to 97 as the safest world in the United States.

4567
01:51:20.890 --> 01:51:22.260
Safest part of the United States,

4568
01:51:22.261 --> 01:51:23.710
the safest city in the United States.

4569
01:51:23.711 --> 01:51:24.130
Really?

4570
01:51:24.130 --> 01:51:24.963
Yes.

4571
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:25.690
And uh,

4572
01:51:25.690 --> 01:51:28.630
but the HBP does an awesome job down there.

4573
01:51:28.930 --> 01:51:29.260
And then,

4574
01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:29.580
um,

4575
01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:29.920
city,

4576
01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:32.740
I our little town I live in or not town,

4577
01:51:33.010 --> 01:51:33.843
little

4578
01:51:35.290 --> 01:51:36.160
area that I live in.

4579
01:51:36.190 --> 01:51:36.640
Uh,

4580
01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:37.480
it's really nice.

4581
01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:40.120
No gangs at all.

4582
01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:41.440
No gangs at all.

4583
01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:42.733
Um,

4584
01:51:43.090 --> 01:51:44.800
crime is pretty much nil.

4585
01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:47.200
There's downtown kids get a little crazy.

4586
01:51:47.230 --> 01:51:48.010
Like I said,

4587
01:51:48.010 --> 01:51:50.980
HBP does an amazing job and I was just making sure it's very safe.

4588
01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:52.000
So to,

4589
01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.390
it's also like sort of a sentimental thing cause that represented the good times

4590
01:51:55.391 --> 01:51:57.680
in your life when you were younger and now you're back to yeah.

4591
01:51:57.820 --> 01:51:58.381
And you know,

4592
01:51:58.381 --> 01:51:58.950
um,

4593
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:59.160
you know,

4594
01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:02.620
have h and a B behind my arms as the only tattoos I've ever had.

4595
01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:03.070
And uh,

4596
01:52:03.070 --> 01:52:03.611
forever.

4597
01:52:03.611 --> 01:52:06.520
You had that shit back in the day when I first met him when I was 18,

4598
01:52:06.521 --> 01:52:06.950
I got it.

4599
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:08.200
I was the first tattoos I ever got.

4600
01:52:08.410 --> 01:52:09.060
Wow.

4601
01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:10.570
Like to beach represent.

4602
01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:10.870
Yeah,

4603
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:11.501
it's forever.

4604
01:52:11.501 --> 01:52:11.681
You know,

4605
01:52:11.681 --> 01:52:14.110
I look at it and I don't forget where I came from.

4606
01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:14.411
You know,

4607
01:52:14.411 --> 01:52:19.210
I remember when I first became the world champion and I was in Vegas and I was

4608
01:52:19.211 --> 01:52:19.661
partying.

4609
01:52:19.661 --> 01:52:21.500
I was actually a cheetah is a strip club and uh,

4610
01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:23.580
I seen Diamond Dallas page there,

4611
01:52:23.710 --> 01:52:25.810
this when he was in WWE and I was like,

4612
01:52:25.811 --> 01:52:27.220
I want to get in ww one day.

4613
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.560
And uh,

4614
01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:28.961
he was like,

4615
01:52:28.961 --> 01:52:29.794
Huh,

4616
01:52:30.130 --> 01:52:31.330
let me tell you one thing son,

4617
01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:33.910
you're the champion right now,

4618
01:52:33.911 --> 01:52:34.160
Ryan.

4619
01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:34.331
I go,

4620
01:52:34.331 --> 01:52:34.531
yeah,

4621
01:52:34.531 --> 01:52:34.671
yeah,

4622
01:52:34.671 --> 01:52:35.080
yeah.

4623
01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:35.913
He goes,

4624
01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:38.020
I give you one word of advice.

4625
01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:39.700
No matter how famous you ever get,

4626
01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:42.040
don't ever forget where you came from.

4627
01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:42.581
He goes,

4628
01:52:42.581 --> 01:52:43.900
you'll be more successful.

4629
01:52:43.901 --> 01:52:45.070
You never forget where you came from.

4630
01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:47.030
And I always kept on shit.

4631
01:52:47.031 --> 01:52:47.864
This is

4632
01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:50.390
14 years ago.

4633
01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:53.400
<v 1>So because of one conversation with Dallas diamond page,</v>

4634
01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:54.263
you have wrapped Heineken

4635
01:52:54.350 --> 01:52:57.260
<v 4>beach hard since then.</v>

4636
01:52:57.290 --> 01:52:57.831
I have no,

4637
01:52:57.831 --> 01:52:58.040
I've,

4638
01:52:58.040 --> 01:52:59.210
I repped it no matter what.

4639
01:52:59.211 --> 01:52:59.420
I,

4640
01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:00.830
I just never forgot where I came from.

4641
01:53:01.250 --> 01:53:04.650
I just always been an idea in my head is is no matter how famous again went,

4642
01:53:04.790 --> 01:53:05.180
never,

4643
01:53:05.180 --> 01:53:06.013
never.

4644
01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:08.030
No matter how much money you make,

4645
01:53:08.031 --> 01:53:10.790
don't ever forget where you came from because there's guys that'll make millions

4646
01:53:11.210 --> 01:53:11.811
and they'll bounce.

4647
01:53:11.811 --> 01:53:12.644
They'll say fucking,

4648
01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:14.540
I forget that neighborhood.

4649
01:53:14.541 --> 01:53:15.320
I don't need that anymore.

4650
01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:16.153
That's me.

4651
01:53:16.630 --> 01:53:16.880
<v 1>No,</v>

4652
01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:17.740
I'm the first out.

4653
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:19.090
As soon as I get some money,

4654
01:53:19.091 --> 01:53:20.000

4655
01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:22.121

4656
01:53:22.121 --> 01:53:25.330
They're seniors places that I would say grab your stuff and get the fuck out of

4657
01:53:25.331 --> 01:53:25.800
there.

4658
01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:26.850
<v 4>Cause there is some towns,</v>

4659
01:53:26.851 --> 01:53:27.140

4664
01:53:35.371 --> 01:53:37.380
parents to get your kids out of there as soon as possible.

4665
01:53:37.410 --> 01:53:38.221
If you get that opportunity,

4666
01:53:38.221 --> 01:53:38.990

4667
01:53:38.990 --> 01:53:40.010

4670
01:53:41.121 --> 01:53:43.010
I wish I didn't have so many good friends in La.

4671
01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:46.180
I would like to live in a bunch of different places all over the country when
