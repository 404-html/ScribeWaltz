<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.800
<v Speaker 1>but I was always living in Dallas in and I was 42 years old when ecstasy hit the</v>

3
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:09.280
<v Speaker 1>streets Mbma and uh,</v>

4
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>I'd never taken any drugs.</v>

6
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.540
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even smoke pot.</v>

7
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Came out of the navy and everything.</v>

8
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:16.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's the Oregon attorney right in,</v>

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 1>in Houston House and attorney.</v>

10
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Then in Dallas I started a computer company.</v>

11
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>I had a personal computer company that while in 1981 we outgrows Microsoft,</v>

12
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:23.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:26.730
<v Speaker 1>I had four color picture in Forbes magazine,</v>

14
00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>made the front page of the Wall Street Journal and really then ibm came in and</v>

15
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>crushed us like a bug.</v>

16
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

17
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 1>What was the name of your computer company ready for?</v>

18
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>This is in Dallas,</v>

19
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Texas named it Dynasty Dynasty Computer Corporation.</v>

20
00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:41.790
<v Speaker 1>But hilarious.</v>

21
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.630
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

22
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 1>we were the amway of computers.</v>

23
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:47.100
<v Speaker 1>I had like 3000 distributors around the country and uh,</v>

24
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.851
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

25
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:48.511
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy.</v>

26
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>And we sold.</v>

27
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>We sold this machine.</v>

28
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.440
<v Speaker 1>You want to hear this anymore?</v>

29
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.930
<v Speaker 1>It was an eight k machine with 16 K of Ram and it was a 12 inch black and white</v>

31
00:00:57.451 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 1>monitor and a cassette tape deck is what we use for input and output and you'd</v>

32
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:03.030
<v Speaker 1>have to load your,</v>

33
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.641
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

34
00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:03.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 1>your boot program and then you'd get a crc error.</v>

36
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:09.560
<v Speaker 1>So you're just the tone and rewind it and then loaded again.</v>

37
00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:10.080
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

38
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>and we sold hundreds of these for 3000 bucks each.</v>

39
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

40
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>And parents would say,</v>

41
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:17.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.870
<v Speaker 1>why do I need this,</v>

43
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:19.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:20.700
<v Speaker 1>you've got recipe program and,</v>

45
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.560
<v Speaker 1>and Pong and a couple of games.</v>

46
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:23.394
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

47
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you need it,</v>

48
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.770
<v Speaker 1>but if your kids don't have this,</v>

49
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.030
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be left behind.</v>

50
00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

51
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 1>When they're 30 years old.</v>

52
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.210
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

53
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.721
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

54
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:30.851
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

55
00:01:30.851 --> 00:01:34.860
<v Speaker 1>I was talking at one of the job of conventions in San Francisco and a guy came</v>

56
00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:38.970
<v Speaker 1>up to me and gave me his card and he's CEO of a company like 100 programmers and</v>

57
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

58
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.421
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

59
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:40.111
<v Speaker 1>you don't remember me,</v>

60

<v Speaker 1>do you?</v>

61
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:40.711
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

62
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

63
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.610
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

64
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>my dad bought a computer from you.</v>

65
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 1>And you told them that would help me.</v>

66
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

67
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if anybody else got help.</v>

68
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:48.990
<v Speaker 1>At least one customer turned out with.</v>

69
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.490
<v Speaker 1>What year was this?</v>

70
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.563
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

71
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.261
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

72
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:53.520
<v Speaker 1>We went out of business.</v>

73
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 1>I started in 79,</v>

74
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.030
<v Speaker 1>79 and we made it to lady for while.</v>

75
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

76
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 1>it was great.</v>

77
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.300
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

78
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.910
<v Speaker 1>you heard of the DOTCOM bubble.</v>

80
00:02:03.911 --> 00:02:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Well this was the PC bubble.</v>

81
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 1>It was before ibm got in and,</v>

82
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Speaker 1>we'd run short and memory chips and I'd call up my friend had osborne and he'd</v>

84
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 1>shoot me some and then when I got some back I had shipped him and it was a</v>

85
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 1>closed network is pretty good old boy thing,</v>

86
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:16.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.633
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>

88
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.630
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of fun.</v>

89
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.411
<v Speaker 1>It was great fun.</v>

90
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

91
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.180
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know what we're doing,</v>

92
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:21.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.280
<v Speaker 1>we're geeks and,</v>

94
00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:23.114
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

95
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know anything about cash flow or business,</v>

96
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:25.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I've been an electrical engineer and a lawyer,</v>

98
00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:28.530
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know anything about business.</v>

99
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:29.410
<v Speaker 1>And so we,</v>

100
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>we just sort of sold ourselves out of business.</v>

101
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>And by the time we were done the last six or eight,</v>

102
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:36.241
<v Speaker 1>nine months,</v>

103
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:39.000
<v Speaker 1>I was a financing the thing by selling ecstasy,</v>

104
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.420
<v Speaker 1>ecstasy come into play.</v>

105
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.350
<v Speaker 1>I was a,</v>

106
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I was doing this computer thing and,</v>

107
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.770
<v Speaker 1>and a close friend of mine,</v>

108
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:47.830
<v Speaker 1>a lawyer in Biloxi,</v>

109
00:02:47.831 --> 00:02:49.860
<v Speaker 1>he called me one day and he says,</v>

110
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>what do you know about ecstasy?</v>

111
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:51.600
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

112
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.141
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

113
00:02:52.141 --> 00:02:52.371
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

114
00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:52.461
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

115
00:02:52.461 --> 00:02:53.191
<v Speaker 1>it's a drug.</v>

116
00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:53.461
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

117
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:53.531
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

118
00:02:53.531 --> 00:02:54.364
<v Speaker 1>I don't do drugs.</v>

119
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.631
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

120
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:56.220
<v Speaker 1>it's legal now.</v>

121
00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>This isn't Texas.</v>

122
00:02:57.241 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>And at that time you're getting 30 years life for a single joint.</v>

123
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>And so there's no way I'd touched something like that,</v>

124
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

125
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>and I get join for one joint.</v>

126
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 1>And so he said,</v>

127
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:09.521
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

128
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 1>this is legal.</v>

129
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>And I had a friend,</v>

130
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 1>a friend of my wife's,</v>

131
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

132
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 1>she was a model in town,</v>

133
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>ran with the fast crowd and I met with her and she fixed me up.</v>

134
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

135
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.030
<v Speaker 1>so I got involved in and then my friend wanted some.</v>

136
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.950
<v Speaker 1>I sent him 50 and I started telling friends about it and I became really</v>

137
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:25.220
<v Speaker 1>evangelical about it.</v>

138
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.830
<v Speaker 1>And pretty soon I'm buying hundreds and 500,</v>

139
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.730
<v Speaker 1>600 and,</v>

140
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.633
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

141
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize it at the time.</v>

142
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 1>The Guy I was buying from was actually the main man.</v>

143
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.320
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

144
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 1>the big guy that started the ecstasy hit the street in Dallas,</v>

145
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 1>had been out here in west coast for several years with the therapist and all but</v>

146
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Dallas and the stork club was the ground zero.</v>

147
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.520
<v Speaker 1>And the stork club was just stark.</v>

148
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.321
<v Speaker 1>Club was so big.</v>

149
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Madonna moved to Dallas to be close to that club.</v>

150
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.793
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

151
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a documentary going to be coming out soon,</v>

152
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.850
<v Speaker 1>called the stark project.</v>

153
00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.073
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

154
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>it was an insane place.</v>

155
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:01.480
<v Speaker 1>It's really the,</v>

156
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 1>the genesis of house music before,</v>

157
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>or even Chicago is called Stark club music.</v>

158
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 1>And then it in and there were bowls of ecstasy on the bar where you go by,</v>

159
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:11.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 1>giving 20 bucks and get a,</v>

161
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>get a hit because it was all legal and uh,</v>

162
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:15.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:16.594
<v Speaker 1>they had chill space.</v>

164
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 1>It was a crazy place that you,</v>

165
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 1>it was like burning man in a building.</v>

166
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.001
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

167
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Larry Hagman was a regular there.</v>

168
00:04:23.571 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

169
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.071
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

170
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:24.191
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

171
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:24.530
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

172
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 1>in this movie that's coming out,</v>

173
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.640
<v Speaker 1>he's quoted as saying he lights up and he said,</v>

174
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.091
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

175
00:04:29.091 --> 00:04:30.340
<v Speaker 1>it was the greatest party on earth.</v>

176
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.631
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

177
00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 1>the only better party is burning man,</v>

178
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>but that's like putting the stork club in the middle of a desert.</v>

179
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.480
<v Speaker 1>But some people would get all dressed up burning man type and we're talking name</v>

180
00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:40.211
<v Speaker 1>brand people,</v>

181
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:40.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.350
<v Speaker 1>the talking heads and people like that.</v>

183
00:04:42.351 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 1>And Madonna even w showed up,</v>

184
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>George W dot ben there.</v>

185
00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:46.720
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

186
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.560
<v Speaker 1>it was just wild and crazy and they played this house music and they had a chill</v>

187
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 1>space and coed bathrooms.</v>

188
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:54.100
<v Speaker 1>It's just a wild place.</v>

189
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.080
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

190
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.440
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

191
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 1>that's really where ecstasy started spreading.</v>

192
00:04:57.731 --> 00:05:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Now I was selling to all of my friends and,</v>

193
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.400
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of coworkers and everybody.</v>

194
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.540
<v Speaker 1>And we were really serious about it that I would make people read all whatever</v>

195
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:08.590
<v Speaker 1>literature there was,</v>

196
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:08.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

197
00:05:08.831 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't very much.</v>

198
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:10.541
<v Speaker 1>So there's a speech.</v>

199
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Sasha gave a talk that Rick Doblin had given up the international,</v>

200
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:15.520
<v Speaker 1>a health organization,</v>

201
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:16.151
<v Speaker 1>but not much.</v>

202
00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:19.750
<v Speaker 1>But we were really serious and I was sort of not in the club scene.</v>

203
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:22.120
<v Speaker 1>I was getting people together in small groups and doing it.</v>

204
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:26.110
<v Speaker 1>But I sold a lot of ex and I was getting deep discounts and so I was using that</v>

205
00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:27.700
<v Speaker 1>money to cash flow of my business.</v>
