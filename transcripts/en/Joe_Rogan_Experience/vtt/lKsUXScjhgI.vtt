<v Speaker 1>This is shade grown men do in their </v>

5
00:00:11.931 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>spare time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Testing flat cap.</v>

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Is that Echo in New Mexico?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

7
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:16.750
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A new Eva Cerveza.</v>

9
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>You don't that New Mexico might be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only shape of a state that sort of makes</v>

10
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking square.</v>

11
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Basically Square.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's square,</v>

12
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.310
<v Speaker 1>but like it looks like on the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some dudes just had some </v>

13
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.770
<v Speaker 1>miscommunication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like fucking do that.</v>

14
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:37.720
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to be over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Mexico miscommunication.</v>

15
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lives that Mexico wanted,</v>

16
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>like there must have been like a cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>elk hunting spot probably.</v>

17
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>And a New Mexico is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

18
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.460
<v Speaker 1>we gotta have a story about a need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This little area,</v>

19
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:55.461
<v Speaker 1>this little block off in that corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico know New Mexico is like the one </v>

20
00:00:55.461 --> 00:00:57.370
<v Speaker 1>of the premier elk hunting spots in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

21
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was a kid in Michigan we </v>

22
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:03.060
<v Speaker 1>went whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe but not at all when I was like</v>

23
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 1>12 or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff changed.</v>

24
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:09.630
<v Speaker 1>And because elk used to be not hunted </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they opened up a season,</v>

25
00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:14.631
<v Speaker 1>I'm so fucking elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could like walk up to a herd of 100 </v>

26
00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:18.981
<v Speaker 1>deep and there would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember there'd be centuries they </v>

27
00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:20.430
<v Speaker 1>would post like young bull elks all </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the perimeter.</v>

28
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.510
<v Speaker 1>And it was fucking wild dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were almost tame.</v>

29
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 1>And then the year after they opened up </v>
<v Speaker 1>permits is skiddish as white tail deer.</v>

30
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the best hunting experiences I </v>

31
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.880
<v Speaker 1>had there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

32
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.370
<v Speaker 1>I was in like a pit blind with a bowl </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there were a bunch of dough at the </v>

33
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.090
<v Speaker 1>feed pile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as in this big field and I hear</v>

34
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 1>like come through the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then another group and these elk met</v>

35
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>two bowls and they started smashing </v>
<v Speaker 1>horns and I was fucking blown away.</v>

36
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 1>The deer didn't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

37
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.010
<v Speaker 1>just eating whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even our species.</v>

38
00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:00.500
<v Speaker 1>We're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

39
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>it was awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

40
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:02.260
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

41
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I loved growing up in the woods or Rad </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

42
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool that you got into hunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your deep,</v>

43
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:08.670
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep in it.</v>

44
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Like there's nothing better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed,</v>

45
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's the elk thing is so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The noises they make,</v>

46
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.780
<v Speaker 1>like when we were a hunting Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the female see they bark.</v>

47
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.540
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody know,</v>

48
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.620
<v Speaker 1>let everybody know so open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all that huge tracking.</v>

49
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Like you got to be an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Mexico and Colorado.</v>

50
00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:34.281
<v Speaker 1>It's a different kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Colorado where we were was in the </v>

51
00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:37.131
<v Speaker 1>mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's all trees and stuff and it was </v>

52
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 1>all about hiding behind trees and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing them to you and being on a,</v>

53
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.410
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a run or something.</v>

54
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Trying to be near where they are and </v>
<v Speaker 1>since it's the raw you tryna make </v>

56
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Speaker 1>noises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.941
<v Speaker 1>like cow calls or you're trying to bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>them in while you're trying to sneak </v>

58
00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:50.010
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't piss all over you.</v>

59
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Is that the new shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

60
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.240
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

61
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>it's a Ted Ted talk podcast and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know if you've ever seen</v>

62
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.040
<v Speaker 2>that video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a video that got around </v>

63
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 2>about when they reintroduced wolves to </v>
<v Speaker 2>yellowstone park.</v>

64
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.570
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you,</v>

65
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.720
<v Speaker 2>you can't hunt in yellowstone park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the animals in yellowstone park or </v>

66
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 2>the same way that you were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>those elk,</v>

67
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.280
<v Speaker 2>the elk are the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they somehow or another know that </v>

68
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 2>people are not gonna hunt them.</v>

69
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.290
<v Speaker 3>That's the weird thing about it and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>it changed in one season.</v>

70
00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:26.291
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are they all symbiotic in this way </v>

71
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:28.160
<v Speaker 3>where they all communicate because none </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them had been hunted.</v>

72
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.680
<v Speaker 3>And it's like all of a sudden all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking elk new though.</v>

73
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's wild.</v>

74
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.050
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

75
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what it's like,</v>

76
00:03:34.251 --> 00:03:36.080
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how uh,</v>

77
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.460
<v Speaker 2>is there something wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what it's like a,</v>

78
00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:43.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you see birds when they fly and </v>

79
00:03:43.461 --> 00:03:45.050
<v Speaker 2>those big or schools of fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>schools of fish,</v>

80
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 2>when they'll turn on a dime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the flocks just know where everybody's </v>

81
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.870
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

82
00:03:50.871 --> 00:03:53.660
<v Speaker 2>There's some sort of strange </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication telepathy.</v>

83
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.230
<v Speaker 2>And I think that you read that book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rise of Superman.</v>

84
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't heard.</v>

85
00:03:58.611 --> 00:03:59.720
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

86
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.800
<v Speaker 3>And they talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the movie was transformers that </v>

87
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.830
<v Speaker 3>all these dudes in wing suits went off </v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

88
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.920
<v Speaker 3>Is it the sears tower in Chicago?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And make an almost 90 degree banks and </v>

89
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:16.411
<v Speaker 3>stuff and then if and there are four of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and they're following each other </v>

90
00:04:16.411 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 3>and if one guy goes after I see you </v>
<v Speaker 3>move,</v>

91
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm too late,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to move as you're moving around </v>

92
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.440
<v Speaker 3>inside ruined the air flow and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I hit the building.</v>

93
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.630
<v Speaker 3>These guys practicing the Alps and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about that,</v>

94
00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 3>that you need to be in that flow state </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that you can start to work with each</v>

95
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:36.961
<v Speaker 3>other in a way that is a supernatural,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy because I felt that flow </v>

96
00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 3>state as a singular person in different </v>
<v Speaker 3>events in my life,</v>

97
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:47.071
<v Speaker 3>but like that kind of thing where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're working in tandem with each </v>

98
00:04:47.071 --> 00:04:50.521
<v Speaker 3>other and they're all talking to each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other and I think like that's the way </v>

99
00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:50.521
<v Speaker 3>that that fish move or that's the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

100
00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:55.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it that gives a frog the fence </v>

101
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.870
<v Speaker 3>to jump off the lily pad right as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hawk is diving before the Hawks moved or</v>

102
00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

103
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.390
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all those fish,</v>

104
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.240
<v Speaker 3>it's not like one turns in the rest </v>
<v Speaker 3>follow up.</v>

105
00:05:00.241 --> 00:05:02.290
<v Speaker 3>They all move uniformly,</v>

106
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.890
<v Speaker 2>the schools of fish efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The flocks of birds are so magical when </v>

107
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.071
<v Speaker 2>you watch them dance in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was giant flocks of birds like how </v>

108
00:05:11.071 --> 00:05:12.610
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are they not just slamming heads,</v>

109
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.510
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

110
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.640
<v Speaker 2>what is going on there,</v>

111
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.420
<v Speaker 3>and then the hawks that birds of prey </v>
<v Speaker 3>are so different than that,</v>

112
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.890
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

113
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.350
<v Speaker 3>no flocks of that meat is a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of thing.</v>

114
00:05:22.351 --> 00:05:25.400
<v Speaker 3>It does people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

115
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.590
<v Speaker 3>Those are those seed eating birds are </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones that can do that.</v>

116
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.820
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we really need each other.</v>

117
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.640
<v Speaker 3>The ones that are mediators are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good.</v>

118
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.050
<v Speaker 2>This the same tent talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy was talking about how a humans,</v>

119
00:05:37.311 --> 00:05:39.680
<v Speaker 2>it was a different guy was st podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

120
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.800
<v Speaker 2>was talking about how humans interrupt </v>
<v Speaker 2>the natural symphony of nature and that </v>

121
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 2>this symphony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like there's a frequency that </v>

122
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.981
<v Speaker 2>all these different animals operate at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like a frog has a niche in this </v>

123
00:05:53.981 --> 00:05:58.121
<v Speaker 2>frequency and a bird has a niche in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>frequency and they were talking about </v>

124
00:05:58.121 --> 00:06:02.200
<v Speaker 2>one frogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have like a whole like swamp </v>

125
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.360
<v Speaker 2>filled with Brady predators would also </v>
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>

126
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:10.361
<v Speaker 2>It makes it impossible to locate them </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's so much sound coming </v>

127
00:06:10.361 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 2>from so many different places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's you can't find them,</v>

128
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.720
<v Speaker 2>but they have these low flying jets in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this area because this is a place where </v>

129
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.850
<v Speaker 2>they practice or pilots practice fighter</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter pilots and so they fly these </v>

130
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:27.191
<v Speaker 2>jets like 600 meters above the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty low and they age,</v>

131
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 2>they fucking supersonic speeds.</v>

132
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.510
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking just going crazy over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the swamp and the disruption of sound is</v>

133
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:40.451
<v Speaker 2>so intense that everything stops for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>while and then slowly these frogs start </v>

134
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:44.710
<v Speaker 2>to resynchronize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like one one,</v>

135
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.990
<v Speaker 2>one will read it and then they'll try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>find each other and get into that rhythm</v>

136
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:50.120
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when that happens,</v>

137
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Speaker 2>when they're trying to find that rhythm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when all the hawks,</v>

138
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.190
<v Speaker 2>all the owls and all the coyotes know </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly when to move in.</v>

139
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 2>So they move in then and they start </v>
<v Speaker 2>picking apart all these frogs.</v>

140
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:05.810
<v Speaker 2>They find the frogs and they eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting,</v>

141
00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:09.860
<v Speaker 2>like they know that there's like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>disruption in the frequency.</v>

142
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:15.090
<v Speaker 3>Wonder how the like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So are those predation animals working </v>

143
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 3>on a different frequency than the frogs </v>
<v Speaker 3>then are like,</v>

144
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.360
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're opportunists in this way where </v>

145
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.360
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a tie,</v>

146
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.360
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

147
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That must be opportunist I think.</v>

148
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the whole idea of what he.</v>

149
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.230
<v Speaker 2>The way he was describing it though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way the frogs do it where you know,</v>

150
00:07:28.231 --> 00:07:30.840
<v Speaker 2>like you're in the swamp or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that and you hear frogs,</v>

151
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:36.410
<v Speaker 2>you didn't know where the fuck there are</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many of them sometimes what it is </v>

152
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:36.960
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sound fucking crazy.</v>

153
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many of them.</v>

154
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:43.910
<v Speaker 2>And so when they have to kind of find </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other and because the sound is so </v>

155
00:07:44.821 --> 00:07:46.200
<v Speaker 2>intense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the jet flies over,</v>

156
00:07:46.201 --> 00:07:48.470
<v Speaker 2>everybody stops what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're like,</v>

157
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.310
<v Speaker 2>we doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing this,</v>

158
00:07:50.311 --> 00:07:51.110
<v Speaker 2>we doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did,</v>

159
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.200
<v Speaker 2>let's do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do it.</v>

160
00:07:52.201 --> 00:07:53.730
<v Speaker 2>And how long does it take them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>recalibrate?</v>

161
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.050
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't long.</v>

162
00:07:55.051 --> 00:07:56.270
<v Speaker 2>It was only a few minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

163
00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.390
<v Speaker 2>I think I want to say 15 minutes where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be.</v>

164
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.580
<v Speaker 2>I might be mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was less than an hour and in that</v>

165
00:08:02.581 --> 00:08:06.690
<v Speaker 2>time these trying to get their shit back</v>
<v Speaker 2>together again and they just get jacked.</v>

166
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:12.390
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing about us humans being </v>
<v Speaker 3>the disruption is that even though like </v>

167
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.630
<v Speaker 3>what we think of our.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read something somewhere,</v>

168
00:08:16.631 --> 00:08:20.290
<v Speaker 3>I heard a podcast where they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a kid or somebody that developed</v>

169
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:25.550
<v Speaker 3>a bacteria or a some kind of biome that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that will eat plastic and maybe take </v>

170
00:08:27.281 --> 00:08:30.790
<v Speaker 3>care of the big island of plastic or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

171
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.740
<v Speaker 3>And I started thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

172
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:37.180
<v Speaker 3>we're fucking idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we created plastic.</v>

173
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.370
<v Speaker 3>Like that was our solution then to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

174
00:08:39.371 --> 00:08:43.480
<v Speaker 3>It's like we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we put nuclear reactors on the biggest,</v>

175
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.900
<v Speaker 3>a fault line in the world where it's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most active.</v>

176
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.210
<v Speaker 3>Like that's how smart we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

177
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.840
<v Speaker 3>what do you do when you create a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bacteria or something that will eat?</v>

178
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.200
<v Speaker 3>What happens when all the plastics gone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like is like,</v>

179
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.000
<v Speaker 3>was that like</v>

180
00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:01.110
<v Speaker 2>the introducing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh we've got a rabbit problem in </v>

181
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.230
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get a Fox and then we've got a Fox</v>

182
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:01.770
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

183
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:03.450
<v Speaker 2>it's like fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Australia.</v>

184
00:09:03.451 --> 00:09:04.870
<v Speaker 2>Australia is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

185
00:09:04.871 --> 00:09:07.290
<v Speaker 2>My Buddy Adam will learn from anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

186
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.880
<v Speaker 2>What are the most adaptable creature and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>

187
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 2>let's go ahead and get some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got a desert.</v>

188
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Get the golf courses out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go ahead and do that.</v>

189
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was what was interesting about this</v>

190
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:19.230
<v Speaker 2>Ted podcast is this same guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about the wolves.</v>

191
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:21.360
<v Speaker 2>Who's done that video but the wolves in </v>
<v Speaker 2>yellowstone.</v>

192
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.590
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting because he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>got.</v>

193
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:27.740
<v Speaker 2>He's got an English accent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He asked about the wolves in yellowstone</v>

194
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:30.590
<v Speaker 2>and amazing things have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>

195
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:35.610
<v Speaker 2>This guy's crazy though because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't just want to bring wolves back to</v>

196
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.640
<v Speaker 2>yellowstone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he's talking about bringing mega </v>

197
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.810
<v Speaker 2>fauna to England.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See they did these studies where they </v>

198
00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:48.510
<v Speaker 2>dug deep into the ground and they found </v>
<v Speaker 2>fossilized remains from 10,000</v>

199
00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:52.740
<v Speaker 2>plus years ago of lions and elephants.</v>

200
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.800
<v Speaker 2>This crazy fucker is talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>reintroducing lions to England.</v>

201
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:02.931
<v Speaker 2>We need that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what was interesting about this cat </v>

202
00:10:02.931 --> 00:10:06.860
<v Speaker 2>is that he admitted that this all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascination with wolves and everything </v>

203
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.300
<v Speaker 2>came out of a midlife crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

204
00:10:09.301 --> 00:10:12.180
<v Speaker 2>he went into a midlife crisis and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

205
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:17.270
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his solution was to get a pussy and now </v>

206
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:17.840
<v Speaker 2>my spirit animals will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

207
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:23.410
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this dude got like really super and </v>

208
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:26.971
<v Speaker 2>the wolves and super into the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what he calls rewilding,</v>

209
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.260
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is like he was talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how megafauna used to live in </v>

210
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.930
<v Speaker 2>England and that human predation and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff wiped them out,</v>

211
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:42.350
<v Speaker 2>but that hasn't been proven that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know that for a fact that it is </v>

212
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.290
<v Speaker 2>entirely possible that the climate was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just not the best climate for them.</v>

213
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.320
<v Speaker 2>And then also natural disasters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also the absolute fact that 90 </v>

214
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:54.690
<v Speaker 2>plus percent of everything that has ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>lived ever is extinct.</v>

215
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.740
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this guy's idea of reducing don't </v>

216
00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.090
<v Speaker 2>want to kill nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to let nothing die.</v>

217
00:11:00.091 --> 00:11:05.091
<v Speaker 2>We are the ultimate pussy arrogant </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuckers that are building golf courses </v>

218
00:11:05.091 --> 00:11:05.520
<v Speaker 2>and deserts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

219
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wolf thing is so fast.</v>

220
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.690
<v Speaker 2>So there's both sides of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard both,</v>

221
00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:11.760
<v Speaker 2>like it's awesome that we have wolves </v>
<v Speaker 2>again there.</v>

222
00:11:11.761 --> 00:11:16.761
<v Speaker 2>And then I've heard people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really the decimation of an </v>

223
00:11:16.761 --> 00:11:17.790
<v Speaker 2>environment like this change the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment and the topographical,</v>

224
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:23.160
<v Speaker 2>a makeup of yellowstone so much that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were retarding growth and a lot of ways </v>

225
00:11:23.971 --> 00:11:25.440
<v Speaker 2>are all like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

226
00:11:25.441 --> 00:11:27.420
<v Speaker 2>anytime you ready to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an alteration,</v>

227
00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:29.400
<v Speaker 2>but like is it for the good or the bad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

228
00:11:29.401 --> 00:11:31.920
<v Speaker 2>it's good for some species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really good.</v>

229
00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:35.120
<v Speaker 2>For some birds it's really good for </v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

230
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.380
<v Speaker 2>a lot of different kinds of plants and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trees.</v>

231
00:11:37.381 --> 00:11:42.381
<v Speaker 2>It's really good for trees because </v>
<v Speaker 2>yellowstone had such a huge population </v>

232
00:11:42.381 --> 00:11:44.430
<v Speaker 2>of deer and elk and bison and all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different animals.</v>

233
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:49.430
<v Speaker 2>They were just eating the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the grass and the trees got thicker </v>

234
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.540
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they grew taller,</v>

235
00:11:51.541 --> 00:11:54.430
<v Speaker 2>like within six years they grew much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much taller.</v>

236
00:11:54.431 --> 00:11:55.050
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

237
00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:00.200
<v Speaker 2>the Ted talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy gave and the root system got </v>

238
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:00.760
<v Speaker 2>stronger because the root system got </v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger.</v>

239
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.900
<v Speaker 2>The path of the rivers was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

240
00:12:03.901 --> 00:12:07.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it changed and it was really,</v>

241
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.510
<v Speaker 2>really intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it is good for some animal.</v>

242
00:12:10.511 --> 00:12:13.420
<v Speaker 2>It's not good for the deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

243
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 2>but do they take those anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would Rangers go out and be like,</v>

244
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.720
<v Speaker 2>we need to take 50 zero this year?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or like there was no hunting.</v>

245
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there was any hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they do in certain circumstances in </v>

246
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.991
<v Speaker 2>places where there's no hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will bring in people to kill the </v>

247
00:12:27.991 --> 00:12:29.140
<v Speaker 2>population if it gets too high and pick </v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

248
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:34.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the solution to that is allow </v>

249
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.530
<v Speaker 2>hunters to go into yellowstone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with that of course,</v>

250
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:38.230
<v Speaker 2>is it yellowstone national park people </v>
<v Speaker 2>were out there hiking and shit.</v>

251
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.500
<v Speaker 2>You don't want Yahoos out there shooting</v>
<v Speaker 2>a gun.</v>

252
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:45.550
<v Speaker 2>Just have rangers and he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the session is closed and make sure </v>

253
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:45.550
<v Speaker 2>there's no campers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go through it.</v>

254
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:45.760
<v Speaker 2>All that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

255
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.880
<v Speaker 2>It's hard though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean how many animals and animal can </v>

256
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.610
<v Speaker 2>give birth to and if there's no wolves </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

257
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.840
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the other thing about hunting.</v>

258
00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:59.770
<v Speaker 2>One of the things you realize is how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much woods there really are,</v>

259
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.800
<v Speaker 2>how deep the everyone's talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the human beings have absolutely taken </v>

260
00:13:05.981 --> 00:13:07.930
<v Speaker 2>over big parts of this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

261
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.640
<v Speaker 2>Southern California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

262
00:13:09.641 --> 00:13:13.230
<v Speaker 2>you go around Los Angeles area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the wildlife that used to be here,</v>

263
00:13:13.231 --> 00:13:18.231
<v Speaker 2>it's all been pushed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's still areas that are </v>

264
00:13:18.231 --> 00:13:18.231
<v Speaker 2>insanely wild and yellowstone is one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

265
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of wilderness</v>

266
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:25.170
<v Speaker 3>when I fly from here to New Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like fly over New Mexico and </v>

267
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:25.600
<v Speaker 3>telling me like there's just no land </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

268
00:13:25.601 --> 00:13:29.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's fucking no people </v>
<v Speaker 3>living anywhere and most of that state,</v>

269
00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.700
<v Speaker 3>like it's just that something happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a fucking mountain lion that</v>

270
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.060
<v Speaker 3>stocked and hunted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of my friends,</v>

271
00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:42.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm in Hollywood in the Hollywood hills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was at a party like fourth of July </v>

272
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:47.251
<v Speaker 3>or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>parked your car on a little cul de sac </v>

273
00:13:47.251 --> 00:13:47.251
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people are gone on vacation.</v>

274
00:13:47.251 --> 00:13:51.841
<v Speaker 3>Some really rich folks up in the hills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She walks down and she and two friends </v>

275
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.380
<v Speaker 3>and fucking car and there's a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain lion that's there that they are</v>

276
00:13:56.381 --> 00:13:58.300
<v Speaker 3>in the Culdesac,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mountain lions here and it's.</v>

277
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:03.360
<v Speaker 3>There's nowhere to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a fence into the fucking crazy </v>

278
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:03.360
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

279
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.890
<v Speaker 3>she ends up yelling at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scaring and jumping on top of this audio</v>

280
00:14:06.891 --> 00:14:10.240
<v Speaker 3>or some car that was there that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>parked there screaming at it.</v>

281
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.330
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then that stopped at,</v>

282
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.500
<v Speaker 3>stopped it from advancing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still the extra,</v>

283
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:15.820
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what sounds did it make?</v>

284
00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:16.450
<v Speaker 3>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

285
00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:18.510
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like a beast from a move.</v>

286
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:22.960
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy just talking to her and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you would think</v>

287
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.010
<v Speaker 2>if that was the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might've been cornered and it wasn't,</v>

288
00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:28.390
<v Speaker 2>it was cornering them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

289
00:14:28.391 --> 00:14:30.810
<v Speaker 2>But why would it cornered them and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>growl at them?</v>

290
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:33.070
<v Speaker 2>Delphy</v>

291
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.760

<v Speaker 3>but made itself known.</v>

292
00:14:35.761 --> 00:14:38.640
<v Speaker 3>She jumped the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to break the windows of the house,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Stop Light Shit.</v>

324
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.220
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the line was tagged.</v>

325
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:45.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why she didn't get charged with </v>

326
00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.411
<v Speaker 3>like an attempted breaking and entering </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all this shit from security cameras </v>

327
00:15:47.411 --> 00:15:47.411
<v Speaker 3>on them because they knew where the line</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like yeah,</v>

328
00:15:47.411 --> 00:15:52.061
<v Speaker 3>the line fucking was done and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you got taglines that are in high </v>

329
00:15:52.061 --> 00:15:54.080
<v Speaker 3>density population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like right in downtown Hollywood.</v>

330
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're super awesome.</v>

331
00:15:55.441 --> 00:15:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Super Arrogant about mountain lions in </v>
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

332
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.600
<v Speaker 2>You can't hunt mammoth mountain lions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not hunted.</v>

333
00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.710
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because of that,</v>

334
00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:05.670
<v Speaker 2>their population has skyrocketed in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>place that I'm going to to hone ranch.</v>

335
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:09.960
<v Speaker 2>There's one waterhole that they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they took pictures of 16 different</v>

336
00:16:09.961 --> 00:16:12.870
<v Speaker 2>mountain lions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have a massive population of</v>

337
00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:15.450
<v Speaker 2>animals up there because it's 270,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>acres.</v>

338
00:16:15.451 --> 00:16:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Whose ranch is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Privately owned?</v>

339
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.490
<v Speaker 2>Privately owned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant ranch and they,</v>

340
00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:25.510
<v Speaker 2>it's just huge and there's nothing going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on up there other than hunting and some.</v>

341
00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:31.660
<v Speaker 2>I think they have a water pipeline goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>through it and a bunch of other ways </v>

342
00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.661
<v Speaker 2>they make money off the ranch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like there's a lot of </v>

343
00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:35.661
<v Speaker 2>people there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

344
00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:40.660
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very few people go in and out of the </v>

345
00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.791
<v Speaker 2>ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these fucking cats have the run of </v>

346
00:16:43.791 --> 00:16:46.071
<v Speaker 2>the land and there's elk up there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's deer up there and there's a lot </v>

347
00:16:46.071 --> 00:16:46.440
<v Speaker 2>of pigs up there and they just party.</v>

348
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.380
<v Speaker 3>I want to put Gopros on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All came back like a fucking stock.</v>

349
00:16:50.381 --> 00:16:55.381
<v Speaker 3>It like be bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do I think someone did something </v>

350
00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:56.180
<v Speaker 3>like that recently?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put a Gopro on something.</v>

351
00:16:56.210 --> 00:17:01.210
<v Speaker 3>Those aren't those park rangers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not fulfilling their fucking </v>

352
00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:01.210
<v Speaker 3>need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they're not dark,</v>

353
00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:03.080
<v Speaker 3>those things put Gopros on them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>let's walk.</v>

354
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long will the battery last?</v>

355
00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need to get in there.</v>

356
00:17:06.641 --> 00:17:10.670
<v Speaker 3>Figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go do something for this world.</v>

357
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:15.910
<v Speaker 3>You've got a battery that'll never </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking disintegrate and that we're </v>

358
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.281
<v Speaker 3>going to keep around forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's polluting the environment for </v>

359
00:17:18.281 --> 00:17:20.471
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can't get that on a mountain </v>

360
00:17:20.471 --> 00:17:20.800
<v Speaker 3>lion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on entertainment.</v>

361
00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:25.810
<v Speaker 3>At least I think that there's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be in the future there's going to be </v>

362
00:17:26.151 --> 00:17:27.860
<v Speaker 3>batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just don't run out of juice.</v>

363
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.500
<v Speaker 3>Like we're going to look back 100 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>from now.</v>

364
00:17:30.501 --> 00:17:35.501
<v Speaker 3>They're going to laugh at us like piles </v>
<v Speaker 3>and batteries and landfills and </v>

365
00:17:35.501 --> 00:17:39.461
<v Speaker 3>hopefully we get to the place where we </v>
<v Speaker 3>can be laughed at hopefully if we make </v>

366
00:17:39.461 --> 00:17:43.271
<v Speaker 3>it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the thing is I think we get </v>

367
00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:43.271
<v Speaker 3>just smart enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he say it all the time,</v>

368
00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:47.261
<v Speaker 3>just smart enough to where we can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can go ahead and have our own </v>

369
00:17:47.261 --> 00:17:49.830
<v Speaker 3>destruction because of our progress </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we won't stop progress.</v>

370
00:17:49.831 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

371
00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:52.050
<v Speaker 1>is that weird thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that thing.</v>

372
00:17:52.051 --> 00:17:55.020
<v Speaker 1>I think Duncan was talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Elon Musk put $10,000,000</v>

373
00:17:55.021 --> 00:18:00.021
<v Speaker 1>towards like this is going to guard us </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the future against the rise of the </v>

374
00:18:00.021 --> 00:18:01.830
<v Speaker 1>machines type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to stop artificial until,</v>

375
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:06.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants to protect us or at least </v>

376
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:07.810
<v Speaker 1>analyze artificial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing is like any pro,</v>

377
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.980
<v Speaker 1>show me where progress got halted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like progress.</v>

378
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.100
<v Speaker 1>It just spurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a weed,</v>

379
00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:14.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my boss,</v>

380
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.760
<v Speaker 1>my hope about progress is they figured </v>
<v Speaker 1>out a way to make no residue like that.</v>

381
00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.400
<v Speaker 1>No footprint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

382
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:25.680
<v Speaker 1>not like there's no waste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the idea of like,</v>

383
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:28.230
<v Speaker 1>like right now we create pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

384
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:30.360
<v Speaker 1>But we had that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did we have that?</v>

385
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

386
00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:37.060
<v Speaker 1>that Goddamn book about food anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

387
00:18:37.911 --> 00:18:38.380
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

388
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:43.390
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it surveyed three different meals and </v>

389
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.251
<v Speaker 1>one was like a fast food meal and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like a all organic home cooked meal </v>

390
00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:46.920
<v Speaker 1>and another was a meal that you made </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

391
00:18:46.921 --> 00:18:49.230
<v Speaker 1>like you made the flower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you harvested the yeast,</v>

392
00:18:49.231 --> 00:18:50.910
<v Speaker 1>you did all that kind of stuff.</v>

393
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the Omnivore's dilemma was the </v>

394
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:56.000
<v Speaker 1>name of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

395
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.680
<v Speaker 1>and like farms used to be like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you'd have some sheep and some pigs</v>

396
00:18:58.681 --> 00:19:02.670
<v Speaker 1>and some chickens and they would shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>all over here and you'd be growing wheat</v>

397
00:19:02.671 --> 00:19:07.671
<v Speaker 1>or corn or whatever over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they'd move over here and then you </v>

398
00:19:07.671 --> 00:19:08.760
<v Speaker 1>move your crops over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you had a continual fertilization</v>

399
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.940
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and self utilized farm.</v>

400
00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:15.510
<v Speaker 1>And then we moved all the animals off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the farm and put them in feed lots.</v>

401
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.750
<v Speaker 1>And then now we just grow one crop over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and over again.</v>

402
00:19:18.751 --> 00:19:20.280
<v Speaker 1>So we need to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

403
00:19:20.281 --> 00:19:21.700
<v Speaker 1>But even if they're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

404
00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:26.730
<v Speaker 1>you're still using farm equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The farm equipment had to be built </v>

405
00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:28.230
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The construction materials,</v>

406
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.640
<v Speaker 1>there's residue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

407
00:19:29.641 --> 00:19:31.270
<v Speaker 1>there's waste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

408
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.440
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of pollution that </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes out of the machines themselves.</v>

409
00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:39.960
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way how to take carbon </v>

410
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.220
<v Speaker 1>dioxide out of the atmosphere and </v>
<v Speaker 1>utilize it.</v>

411
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:46.430
<v Speaker 1>How to take waste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what are all the different waste </v>

412
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.770
<v Speaker 1>products that people create with all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things that we do,</v>

413
00:19:46.771 --> 00:19:51.771
<v Speaker 1>whether it's making computers or whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's driving buses are and figuring out </v>

414
00:19:51.771 --> 00:19:56.160
<v Speaker 1>a way to turn that waste into something </v>
<v Speaker 1>profitable or into something useful.</v>

415
00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Had to be Hella profitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

416
00:19:57.821 --> 00:19:59.760
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to be held you useful too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

417
00:19:59.761 --> 00:20:04.761
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the idea behind this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The plastic island in the ocean,</v>

418
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:06.990
<v Speaker 1>how to utilize that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really an island.</v>

419
00:20:06.991 --> 00:20:11.991
<v Speaker 1>People who get mad if you call it an </v>
<v Speaker 1>island because you can't build a house </v>

420
00:20:11.991 --> 00:20:11.991
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

421
00:20:11.991 --> 00:20:13.020
<v Speaker 1>We can't sell real estate on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fuck you.</v>

422
00:20:13.021 --> 00:20:16.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That figure is on environment though.</v>

423
00:20:16.681 --> 00:20:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Like what do we call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a floating,</v>

424
00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.170
<v Speaker 1>floating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the size of Texas.</v>

425
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.880
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know how big it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

426
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.180
<v Speaker 1>It's just like how all the plastic finds</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

427
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants even plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful.</v>

428
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.880
<v Speaker 1>Love Story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plastic plastic should be one of those </v>

429
00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.900
<v Speaker 1>little 15 minute shorts before you watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kids meal.</v>

430
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:41.280
<v Speaker 1>You know what dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I need to do.</v>

431
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:45.210
<v Speaker 1>All this other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to get a job with like Chevron or</v>

432
00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 1>something or the plastic companies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be the guy that goes out there.</v>

433
00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.510
<v Speaker 3>I remember when we were filming two guns</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like in Louisiana and,</v>

434
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:54.280
<v Speaker 3>and that fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just fucked up the whole golf.</v>

435
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:56.650
<v Speaker 3>So way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were there when that happened?</v>

436
00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.890
<v Speaker 3>It was right after that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's just no,</v>

437
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.500
<v Speaker 3>I didn't go down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't like that right there.</v>

438
00:21:02.501 --> 00:21:07.501
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't on the shores.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like how far away were you were in </v>

439
00:21:07.501 --> 00:21:07.501
<v Speaker 3>New Orleans and how far away is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>from them?</v>

440
00:21:07.501 --> 00:21:11.590
<v Speaker 3>One and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to bad river runs out into it.</v>

441
00:21:11.591 --> 00:21:14.410
<v Speaker 3>And you didn't smell anything crazier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean no more.</v>

442
00:21:14.411 --> 00:21:16.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean you want to smell is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>

443
00:21:16.091 --> 00:21:18.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of new smells to me like I</v>

444
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.990
<v Speaker 3>go to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to Bourbon Street and I was like,</v>

445
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:25.680
<v Speaker 3>this is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they got everybody at Walmart </v>

446
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.410
<v Speaker 3>hammered and brought a party bus and </v>
<v Speaker 3>drop them off.</v>

447
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.820
<v Speaker 3>And that's what Bourbon streets like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a trip permit.</v>

448
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.610
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy.</v>

449
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:34.540
<v Speaker 3>And then it feels like you walk back all</v>
<v Speaker 3>through that quarter and you're like,</v>

450
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.590

<v Speaker 3>hookers and fucking all kinds of </v>

453
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.430
<v Speaker 3>darkness all through there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a trip.</v>

454
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:51.130
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bp is doing all this shit and they're </v>

455
00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.581
<v Speaker 3>going look at what we've done to help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I could be one of those spin </v>

456
00:21:53.581 --> 00:21:53.980
<v Speaker 3>doctors for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the,</v>

457
00:21:53.981 --> 00:21:54.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plastic.</v>

458
00:21:54.671 --> 00:21:57.270
<v Speaker 3>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the love and plastic help is.</v>

459
00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.540
<v Speaker 3>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

460
00:21:58.541 --> 00:22:00.490
<v Speaker 3>I really believed these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are great commercials.</v>

461
00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:05.820
<v Speaker 3>I look up even though we've dumped </v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of gallons,</v>

462
00:22:06.071 --> 00:22:07.390
<v Speaker 3>like Halliburton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can be like,</v>

463
00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.680
<v Speaker 3>look at all these dead Iraqis and look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at what we've done to help them.</v>

464
00:22:10.681 --> 00:22:13.570
<v Speaker 3>And they could show them Baghdad like </v>
<v Speaker 3>five years ago in Baghdad now.</v>

465
00:22:13.571 --> 00:22:17.920
<v Speaker 3>And it's a little different just to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>like New York City now.</v>

466
00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:18.610
<v Speaker 3>It's caves.</v>

467
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:25.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to do is we start from </v>

468
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.471
<v Speaker 2>scratch and then do it right and do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

469
00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:33.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is one of the arguments that </v>

470
00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.841
<v Speaker 2>historians use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's in the beginning of a Dan </v>

471
00:22:35.841 --> 00:22:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Carlin's hardcore history series on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mongols.</v>

472
00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Did you listen to that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what he's talking about?</v>

473
00:22:39.631 --> 00:22:44.631
<v Speaker 2>Hitler and the beginning of the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about how the way people </v>

474
00:22:44.631 --> 00:22:48.351
<v Speaker 2>talk about gang is calm today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say that he opened up the trade </v>

475
00:22:48.351 --> 00:22:51.951
<v Speaker 2>routes with China and all the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>they tried to put a positive spin on </v>

476
00:22:51.951 --> 00:22:53.940
<v Speaker 2>what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the reason why they could do that is</v>

477
00:22:53.941 --> 00:22:56.210
<v Speaker 2>because it was a thousand years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

478
00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.280
<v Speaker 2>But if they try to do that about Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too soon.</v>

479
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.470
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting thing that people do</v>

480
00:23:01.471 --> 00:23:03.150
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag.</v>

481
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:06.820
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag too soon.</v>

482
00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.070
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag blessed.</v>

483
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every revolution starts with the fight.</v>

484
00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:16.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned that today on the UFC,</v>

<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and I'm like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what made me cry as like the pride </v>

498

<v Speaker 1>of a black eye like that people don't </v>

502
00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.630
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I would look at a girl with a </v>

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:03.461
<v Speaker 1>black guy and think that she got beat by</v>
<v Speaker 1>her man and that's what a lot of people </v>

504
00:24:03.461 --> 00:24:03.800
<v Speaker 1>don't think that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see color Joe,</v>

505
00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:09.020
<v Speaker 1>that's not a colored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's a male female.</v>

506
00:24:09.021 --> 00:24:12.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be that aggressive.</v>

00:24:43.551 --> 00:24:46.160
<v Speaker 1>makeup on fear factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but during that I did.</v>

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.310
<v Speaker 1>How people don't want to be authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

523
00:24:52.311 --> 00:24:55.250
<v Speaker 1>we can't have this be real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to have it look a certain way.</v>

524
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.290
<v Speaker 1>The way we think of him to look.</v>

<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're not happy with that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>they do their lips.</v>

575
00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:11.760
<v Speaker 1>They shoot rubber into their face to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking fill it up and then they pull </v>

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.780
<v Speaker 1>that bitch back and then she's monster </v>

<v Speaker 1>year old lady who looks fine.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The self talk that happens around it </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people do is like,</v>

585
00:27:30.661 --> 00:27:33.690
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what people run from in that way.</v>

586
00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:39.170
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it just feels like there's </v>

587
00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:39.170
<v Speaker 1>something they don't do the shit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do it.</v>

588
00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:39.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you want to move?</v>

589
00:27:39.541 --> 00:27:44.541
<v Speaker 1>Well all the time,</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

591
00:27:44.541 --> 00:27:44.541
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

592
00:27:44.541 --> 00:27:45.770
<v Speaker 1>But I could get some surgery to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like fuck.</v>

593
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Well they just want to look good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

594
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some people that look good </v>
<v Speaker 1>until their face moves,</v>

595
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:55.870
<v Speaker 1>like they can convince themselves they </v>
<v Speaker 1>look good because they're like looking </v>

596
00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:56.970
<v Speaker 1>in the mirror and then everything looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>okay as long as they stay still.</v>

597
00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:58.830
<v Speaker 1>But once they start talking and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

598
00:27:58.831 --> 00:28:00.910
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking cheeks are moving man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

599
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Like one time we were in the green </v>
<v Speaker 1>facial expression.</v>

600
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:09.170
<v Speaker 1>We were in the green room at the Improv </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Breyer in this member when Joan </v>

601
00:28:09.541 --> 00:28:14.541
<v Speaker 1>rivers and her daughter had like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality show and I was high as anyone </v>

602
00:28:14.541 --> 00:28:16.580
<v Speaker 1>wondering who do I want to fuck her </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter?</v>

603
00:28:16.581 --> 00:28:16.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

604
00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how either one of those were an </v>

605
00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:24.600
<v Speaker 1>option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was looking at we will really,</v>

606
00:28:24.601 --> 00:28:29.601
<v Speaker 1>really high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was me and des and you know how that </v>

607
00:28:29.601 --> 00:28:29.601
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're,</v>

608
00:28:29.601 --> 00:28:30.230
<v Speaker 1>we're in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the green room and we were looking up</v>

609
00:28:30.231 --> 00:28:34.170
<v Speaker 1>at the screen and I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was freaked out.</v>

610
00:28:34.171 --> 00:28:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean just like nervous and terrified </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Joan rivers face because her face was</v>

611
00:28:38.371 --> 00:28:40.710
<v Speaker 1>like a rubber Kabuki mask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

612
00:28:40.711 --> 00:28:42.040
<v Speaker 1>As if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're looking at it,</v>

613
00:28:42.041 --> 00:28:47.041
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like somebody is about to </v>

614
00:28:47.041 --> 00:28:47.041
<v Speaker 1>explode.</v>

615
00:28:47.041 --> 00:28:49.730
<v Speaker 1>It looks like there's an impending </v>
<v Speaker 1>something happening and you're not sure </v>

616
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:49.730
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

617
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:53.061
<v Speaker 1>it's so fucking not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's just looked frozen.</v>

618
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:58.250
<v Speaker 1>It looked like frozen and rubber and </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird and she died getting operated on.</v>

619
00:28:58.321 --> 00:29:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't surgery though.</v>

620
00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:03.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was plastic surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that how Kanye his mom died too?</v>

621
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she died from plastic surgery.</v>

622
00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Anesthesia going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going under for hundreds.</v>

623
00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:15.060
<v Speaker 1>No bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird that we live in such an </v>

624
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:15.060
<v Speaker 1>advanced society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're like,</v>

625
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:15.060
<v Speaker 1>just putting people to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We might kill him.</v>

626
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Bono.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so rare though.</v>

627
00:29:16.261 --> 00:29:18.080
<v Speaker 1>It's you have to be a poor health to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

628
00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Gone under a bunch of times for </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgeries and I've had both my knees </v>

629
00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.660
<v Speaker 1>done one knee twice my nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Done,</v>

630
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:30.140
<v Speaker 1>I've got a lot of shit fixed and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just put you under in the front </v>

631
00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.830
<v Speaker 1>like you never hear of a fighter when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they go under.</v>

632
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:36.480
<v Speaker 1>It's usually older people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What have you had done?</v>

633
00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.660
<v Speaker 1>My knee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My shoulder three times.</v>

634
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:40.400
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

635
00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:41.680
<v Speaker 1>you shoulda done times.</v>

636
00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:44.970
<v Speaker 2>I was overachiever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did.</v>

637
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:50.940
<v Speaker 3>They sculpt it first and then I rip that</v>
<v Speaker 3>one out and then they did another one </v>

638
00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:55.381
<v Speaker 3>where it was a real aggressive thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that changed my anatomy around in that </v>

639
00:29:55.381 --> 00:29:58.321
<v Speaker 3>shoulder and then like they like your </v>
<v Speaker 3>bicep head goes in and they cut off the </v>

640
00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:03.720
<v Speaker 3>bone where it goes in on one of them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they moved it and screwed it in </v>

641
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.920
<v Speaker 3>underneath to be like a physical blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when it dislocate,</v>

642
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:10.590
<v Speaker 3>which then you fast forward 15 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>later and I was having a lot of ac joint</v>

643
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:15.810
<v Speaker 3>hurt like trouble and there's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>rubbing together and so this other </v>

644
00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:20.371
<v Speaker 3>doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes in and he's going to clean that </v>

645
00:30:20.371 --> 00:30:20.371
<v Speaker 3>up and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be great.</v>

646
00:30:20.371 --> 00:30:20.371
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looks at my x rays.</v>

647
00:30:20.371 --> 00:30:20.830
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

648
00:30:20.831 --> 00:30:22.090
<v Speaker 3>who did this to you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

649
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.840
<v Speaker 3>that's not very encouraging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

650
00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:30.340
<v Speaker 3>just nobody ethically would change your </v>
<v Speaker 3>anatomy like that,</v>

651
00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:31.330
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

652
00:30:31.331 --> 00:30:34.630
<v Speaker 3>it was a cutting edge shit at Michigan </v>
<v Speaker 3>State University fucking 15 years ago.</v>

653
00:30:34.631 --> 00:30:36.440
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno why,</v>

654
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:40.090
<v Speaker 3>but it's been solid since then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my good shoulder.</v>

655
00:30:40.091 --> 00:30:41.930
<v Speaker 3>So that guy do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

656
00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:45.190
<v Speaker 3>that guy just cleaned up my ac joint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was forest surgery.</v>

657
00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:47.550
<v Speaker 2>So when they cleaned it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what do they do?</v>

658
00:30:47.551 --> 00:30:51.420
<v Speaker 2>Like my friend Melissa from the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's had her shoulder done,</v>

659
00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:52.560
<v Speaker 2>she has a,</v>

660
00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:57.740
<v Speaker 3>they shave it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they put some kind of fake synovial </v>

661
00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:58.650
<v Speaker 3>fluid maybe back in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They try to influence a</v>

662
00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:02.220
<v Speaker 2>cartilage growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps hers was bone growth,</v>

663
00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:04.680
<v Speaker 2>like when you have like any sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue,</v>

664
00:31:04.681 --> 00:31:08.250
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of arthritis and rubbing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you see that a lot,</v>

665
00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:13.280
<v Speaker 2>a lot of time in spinal stenosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the spinal columns you'll see </v>

666
00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.710
<v Speaker 2>growth like on the edges of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

667
00:31:15.711 --> 00:31:17.990
<v Speaker 2>the spine of the discs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

668
00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.590
<v Speaker 2>not on the disc itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

669
00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:24.700
<v Speaker 2>the hard pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spine and the disc is the stuff in </v>

670
00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:24.700
<v Speaker 2>between these times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

671
00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.640
<v Speaker 2>And the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they call those things?</v>

672
00:31:26.641 --> 00:31:29.100
<v Speaker 2>What's the spine bone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's a bone?</v>

673
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.350
<v Speaker 2>I think we did spine bone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spine.</v>

674
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.710
<v Speaker 2>I know just what you're talking about is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

675
00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:37.710
<v Speaker 2>your backbone because in between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>semipermeable like pumice creek,</v>

676
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:43.380
<v Speaker 2>that's the mushy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the stuff to cushions </v>

677
00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:43.380
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

678
00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:47.150
<v Speaker 2>And the bulk of your vertebrae.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank God very much.</v>

679
00:31:48.751 --> 00:31:50.190
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew there was a word.</v>

680
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:53.490
<v Speaker 2>How do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems like that's in my lexicon,</v>

681
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.860
<v Speaker 2>but I've had a rough day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been running around.</v>

682
00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:58.680
<v Speaker 2>But the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the edges as you,</v>

683
00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:02.610
<v Speaker 2>your disks get smaller if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're losing disc degeneration.</v>

684
00:32:02.611 --> 00:32:03.480
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

685
00:32:03.481 --> 00:32:07.680
<v Speaker 2>a lot of doctors will start to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that it's disc degeneration,</v>

686
00:32:07.681 --> 00:32:09.540
<v Speaker 2>disease and they'll let you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

00:32:09.541 --> 00:32:11.250
<v Speaker 2>it's a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to worry about it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's not a disease for the most part.</v>

690
00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:20.360
<v Speaker 2>It's most of the time when they say that</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is is you've been abusing your </v>

691
00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.780
<v Speaker 2>body because I've talked to a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters and they'll say,</v>

<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it has nothing to do with you </v>

695
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:31.371
<v Speaker 2>fucking headbutting dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred miles an hour like shooting </v>

696
00:32:31.371 --> 00:32:34.251
<v Speaker 2>for doubles and run it into people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hips suplex to over and over again or </v>

<v Speaker 2>tossed or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't.</v>

698
00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:36.020
<v Speaker 2>This isn't a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking.</v>

699
00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:38.530
<v Speaker 2>This isn't herpes concussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is your,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They develop like bone spurs,</v>

702
00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:49.970
<v Speaker 1>like the bone tries to grow and almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>like your bone is trying to fill in the </v>

703
00:32:50.091 --> 00:32:54.080
<v Speaker 1>area where it knows that the spinal disc</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't there anymore.</v>

704
00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:56.440

<v Speaker 1>homeostasis.</v>

708
00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.050
<v Speaker 1>getting dislocated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The scar tissue keeps it in place.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

742
00:34:33.621 --> 00:34:38.621

<v Speaker 1>a paper and the paper that I wrote was </v>

743
00:34:38.621 --> 00:34:41.861
<v Speaker 1>that you should legalize every drug and </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was all the kind of thing,</v>

<v Speaker 1>should have Uzi.</v>

748
00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.730
<v Speaker 1>That's true is because he can sell to </v>
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

749
00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:58.760
<v Speaker 1>The black market is the only thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes crime.</v>

<v Speaker 1>case in there because now you've got to </v>

<v Speaker 1>That does happen.</v>

765
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:40.380
<v Speaker 1>That does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that shit should be legal.</v>

766
00:35:40.381 --> 00:35:41.850
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are like,</v>

767
00:35:41.851 --> 00:35:43.200
<v Speaker 1>well they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they do just tax,</v>

768
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:45.120
<v Speaker 1>everybody's like tax that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

769
00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:49.680
<v Speaker 1>but that's on the idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government gives a fuck the government.</v>

770
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean it makes more money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like if I can tax you who wants</v>

771
00:35:53.281 --> 00:35:54.030
<v Speaker 1>to buy weed?</v>

772
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:59.570
<v Speaker 1>I wondered how do I tax everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make them all scared and then I am </v>

773
00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:03.651
<v Speaker 1>prison guys for this illegality and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get the public dollars because </v>

774
00:36:03.651 --> 00:36:08.450
<v Speaker 1>look at isn't it scary that we got these</v>
<v Speaker 1>black and Mexican guys that are selling </v>

775
00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:09.630
<v Speaker 1>dope and we need to put them somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a business.</v>

776
00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:14.660
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole business and that's why it's </v>

777
00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:14.700
<v Speaker 1>like a business though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another business.</v>

778
00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:16.710
<v Speaker 1>The other businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal marijuana,</v>

779
00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:21.830
<v Speaker 1>will you make more money from tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars from legal marijuana in </v>

780
00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:21.830
<v Speaker 1>Colorado?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

781
00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:26.300
<v Speaker 1>In this year in Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made more money from tax dollars </v>

782
00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:26.910
<v Speaker 1>from marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did from alcohol for the first time</v>

783
00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:27.600
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

784
00:36:27.601 --> 00:36:29.370
<v Speaker 1>But what I would love to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very high.</v>

785
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:34.430
<v Speaker 1>What I want to see then is those numbers</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus all the public and federal money </v>

786
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:38.970
<v Speaker 1>that comes from taxpayers that goes into</v>
<v Speaker 1>law enforcement,</v>

787
00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.310
<v Speaker 1>whether it's at sheriff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug enforcement levels,</v>

788
00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.110
<v Speaker 1>dea levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>FBI law,</v>

789
00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:46.500
<v Speaker 1>like all the different funding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fucking huge.</v>

790
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:49.260
<v Speaker 1>And all the prisons shit like where's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the.</v>

791
00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:54.320
<v Speaker 1>So all the public tax dollars show me </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the taxing on pot is more than </v>

792
00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:54.960
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would agree,</v>

793
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:57.840
<v Speaker 1>but wharf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

794
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.380
<v Speaker 1>I bet you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well especially with drug enforcement is</v>

795
00:37:01.381 --> 00:37:02.660
<v Speaker 1>weird because you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

796
00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.530
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at a blanket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

797
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:06.900
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at heroin,</v>

798
00:37:06.901 --> 00:37:08.580
<v Speaker 1>coke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the marijuana,</v>

799
00:37:08.581 --> 00:37:09.930
<v Speaker 1>drug enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal,</v>

800
00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.730
<v Speaker 1>make it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make well make it all legal and at least</v>

801
00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:15.150
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna get taxes from stuff that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>already been sold anyway.</v>

802
00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:17.280
<v Speaker 1>And then you can use that money for </v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

803
00:37:17.281 --> 00:37:22.281
<v Speaker 1>use that money for treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the people that are in law </v>

804
00:37:22.281 --> 00:37:25.401
<v Speaker 1>enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with the law enforcement </v>

805
00:37:25.401 --> 00:37:27.831
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're fucking lobbying to </v>

806
00:37:27.831 --> 00:37:27.910
<v Speaker 1>keep shit illegally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do a lot of.</v>

807
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:30.150
<v Speaker 1>They don't want it legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know why would you.</v>

808
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:35.150
<v Speaker 1>And then when you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's the biggest union in the </v>

809
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:38.960
<v Speaker 1>maybe in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the country as the correctional </v>

810
00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.200
<v Speaker 1>prison guards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you got prison guards the biggest,</v>

811
00:37:40.201 --> 00:37:41.580
<v Speaker 1>but they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lobby there.</v>

812
00:37:41.581 --> 00:37:44.350
<v Speaker 1>One of the biggest contributors for drug</v>
<v Speaker 1>legalization,</v>

813
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:49.790
<v Speaker 1>keeping drugs illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lobby hard to make sure that drugs </v>

814
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:50.370
<v Speaker 1>stay illegal because it keeps them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>

815
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:55.550
<v Speaker 1>But you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just got to figure out alternatives </v>

816
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:58.251
<v Speaker 1>for those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think people that are prison </v>

817
00:37:58.251 --> 00:37:59.961
<v Speaker 1>guards want to be fucking prison guards?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could find some sort of a </v>

818
00:37:59.961 --> 00:38:02.160
<v Speaker 1>positive job if you could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I bet a lot of those guys are like,</v>

819
00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm in power over some fucking bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers.</v>

820
00:38:05.401 --> 00:38:10.401
<v Speaker 1>And they liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consciousness is fucked up because </v>

821
00:38:10.401 --> 00:38:10.401
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

822
00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:12.540
<v Speaker 1>if you've got that job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a prisoner,</v>

823
00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:14.690
<v Speaker 1>you're a prisoner all doing.</v>

824
00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been chosen to be a prisoner and </v>

825
00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:19.730
<v Speaker 1>you think you're free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>

826
00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:22.950
<v Speaker 1>You're a head guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just don't know until it's a guy </v>

827
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:25.131
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda got that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness to where he doesn't even </v>

828
00:38:25.131 --> 00:38:26.190
<v Speaker 1>know he's fought qm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the feeling that you must get,</v>

829
00:38:26.191 --> 00:38:29.820
<v Speaker 1>like they shut those gates behind you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're working with all those people</v>

830
00:38:29.821 --> 00:38:34.821
<v Speaker 1>that are in there for life and you got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go home at night and then you're </v>

831
00:38:34.821 --> 00:38:34.920
<v Speaker 1>going to go home at night and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>quit and leave anytime you.</v>

832
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:39.430
<v Speaker 1>But your work environment is filled with</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these people that are just doomed.</v>

833
00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:40.990
<v Speaker 1>They're doomed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally.</v>

834
00:38:40.991 --> 00:38:41.610
<v Speaker 1>They arrived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

835
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:44.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freeway.</v>

836
00:38:44.471 --> 00:38:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Rick Ross a documentary last week and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

837
00:38:47.771 --> 00:38:48.790
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is crazy.</v>

838
00:38:48.791 --> 00:38:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Like you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

839
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:53.890
<v Speaker 1>like more money than it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like get anything.</v>

840
00:38:53.891 --> 00:38:58.891
<v Speaker 1>You're living a life that like is is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like if Bill Gates had an exciting life </v>

841
00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.910
<v Speaker 1>type,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you wanted to do,</v>

842
00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:02.410
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any vacations,</v>

843
00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.050
<v Speaker 1>any anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you go into nothing of prison.</v>

844
00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:10.280
<v Speaker 1>Then you come out and he's just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>printing tee shirts or whatever he's </v>

845
00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:10.280
<v Speaker 1>trying to do and trying to stay busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just trying to hustle.</v>

846
00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does like speeches and does a bunch </v>

847
00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:17.881
<v Speaker 1>of different shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's just trying to hustle and stay </v>

848
00:39:17.881 --> 00:39:17.881
<v Speaker 1>straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

849
00:39:17.881 --> 00:39:17.881
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard man.</v>

850
00:39:17.881 --> 00:39:20.650
<v Speaker 1>It's also crazy because he went in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was making all that money,</v>

851
00:39:20.651 --> 00:39:23.360
<v Speaker 1>millions and millions of dollars and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't read millions a day,</v>

852
00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:28.890
<v Speaker 1>millions a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't read and then figured out how </v>

853
00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:29.920
<v Speaker 1>to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then figured out how to fucking read law</v>

854
00:39:29.921 --> 00:39:34.921
<v Speaker 1>books and then figured out that his case</v>
<v Speaker 1>was bullshit and then got it overturned </v>

855
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:38.260
<v Speaker 1>because he was in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was under the three strikes law,</v>

856
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:42.400
<v Speaker 1>but they tried to try him for going </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal enterprise,</v>

857
00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:45.160
<v Speaker 1>not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a or whatever.</v>

858
00:39:45.161 --> 00:39:47.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like it was one robbing spree that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

859
00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:50.180
<v Speaker 1>that it wasn't secular events is how he </v>
<v Speaker 1>did it.</v>

860
00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Like so there were saying Ohio is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate thing and he's like,</v>

861
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.960
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was on a continuous criminal </v>

862
00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.791
<v Speaker 1>spree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my whole life was a continuous </v>

863
00:39:59.791 --> 00:39:59.791
<v Speaker 1>criminal spree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the three strike thing,</v>

864
00:39:59.791 --> 00:40:04.081
<v Speaker 1>they tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tried him for two things at the </v>

865
00:40:04.081 --> 00:40:06.340
<v Speaker 1>same time and it's not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to go away and then they</v>

866
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.760
<v Speaker 1>catch you again and you go away and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they catch you again at three strikes,</v>

867
00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:15.210
<v Speaker 1>but they tried to do it for him with </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than one different things tagged </v>

868
00:40:15.581 --> 00:40:17.740
<v Speaker 1>onto one arrest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not how it works.</v>

869
00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they planted a bunch of shit on</v>

870
00:40:19.601 --> 00:40:21.820
<v Speaker 1>him as father to put them in jail to </v>
<v Speaker 1>win.</v>

871
00:40:21.821 --> 00:40:26.821
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird that they let them out that </v>

872
00:40:26.821 --> 00:40:27.040
<v Speaker 1>that worked like that work because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was right.</v>

873
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem,</v>

874
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:31.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be talking about this a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

875
00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.370
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem with law enforcement</v>
<v Speaker 1>in general,</v>

876
00:40:34.371 --> 00:40:36.610
<v Speaker 1>like one of the big problems is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to win.</v>

877
00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:41.780
<v Speaker 1>When people get into game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Jujitsu or it's fucking </v>

878
00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:41.860
<v Speaker 1>ping pong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to win,</v>

879
00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:44.050
<v Speaker 1>or like the drug testers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're not looking,</v>

880
00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.270
<v Speaker 1>they're not wanting you to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's not true.</v>

881
00:40:46.271 --> 00:40:51.271
<v Speaker 1>Some guys probably are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not looking for you to have </v>

882
00:40:51.271 --> 00:40:53.281
<v Speaker 1>a free test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I want to catch this dirty guy and </v>

883
00:40:53.281 --> 00:40:53.281
<v Speaker 1>they see all the guys is dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

884
00:40:53.281 --> 00:40:54.190
<v Speaker 1>But I mean that's the hustle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

885
00:40:54.191 --> 00:40:55.540
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're trying to do.</v>

886
00:40:55.541 --> 00:40:59.380
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to catch people cheating </v>
<v Speaker 1>so they get this motherfucker like every</v>

887
00:40:59.381 --> 00:41:02.860
<v Speaker 1>day you're playing a game and the game </v>
<v Speaker 1>is catch the guy with the rubber Dick.</v>

888
00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they should?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

889
00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.500
<v Speaker 1>therapists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an eight or.</v>

890
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Manson made that famous.</v>

891
00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Did he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

892
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:16.250
<v Speaker 1>he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the first guy that I know that </v>

893
00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:16.900
<v Speaker 1>I'd heard about a wizard later with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys are fucking.</v>

894
00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:22.080
<v Speaker 1>I think all that shit should be illegal </v>
<v Speaker 1>to like when they do gene splicing or </v>

895
00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:22.450
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck is next that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do.</v>

896
00:41:22.451 --> 00:41:27.451
<v Speaker 1>Like they're going to have miles that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and inhibitors and all that kind of </v>

897
00:41:27.451 --> 00:41:30.181
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have a thing if all </v>

898
00:41:30.181 --> 00:41:32.380
<v Speaker 1>these fucking useless fucking nerds that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are regulating this shit or like we want</v>

899
00:41:32.921 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 1>to have clean athletes,</v>

900
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:35.390
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

901
00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:40.480
<v Speaker 3>so you're going to have a crowd of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking people at the mgm that are all </v>

902
00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:44.021
<v Speaker 3>in way better shape and condition than </v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual fucking fighters that are </v>

903
00:41:44.021 --> 00:41:44.360
<v Speaker 3>competing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is for sure.</v>

904
00:41:44.361 --> 00:41:46.430
<v Speaker 3>When the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When that does happen,</v>

905
00:41:46.431 --> 00:41:51.431
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have to have a totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>new conversation because I think right </v>

906
00:41:51.431 --> 00:41:54.161
<v Speaker 3>now what's going on is they're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to prevent the first drips of </v>

907
00:41:54.161 --> 00:41:56.090
<v Speaker 3>water that are coming out of that dam </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're putting their fingers in it.</v>

908
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:57.790
<v Speaker 3>It's like stops and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

909
00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.210
<v Speaker 3>stopping the rise of the machines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Elan Musk,</v>

910
00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:01.880
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's common.</v>

911
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.020
<v Speaker 3>It's common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's common.</v>

912
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:05.030
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do with the rise </v>
<v Speaker 3>of New Mexico?</v>

913
00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:07.140

<v Speaker 3>Handsomest man,</v>

980
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:28.670
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>green eyed devil,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you've got a lot going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How all that came.</v>

982
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:34.050
<v Speaker 3>And then I just got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just kept,</v>

983
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:39.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I was used to live like thinking </v>

984
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.470
<v Speaker 3>another shoe's about to drop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right for a long time.</v>

985
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:41.610
<v Speaker 3>And I thought it was just not going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>end up good.</v>

986
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:46.670
<v Speaker 3>And because like I didn't correlate that</v>
<v Speaker 3>my actions were getting my results in a </v>

987
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.980
<v Speaker 3>lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

988
00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.050
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think,</v>

989
00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:54.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big part of that is just being </v>

990
00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:54.070
<v Speaker 3>accountable for your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a guy told me,</v>

991
00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:54.070
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:55.290
<v Speaker 3>you're all fucked up and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

993
00:44:55.350 --> 00:45:00.350
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you think you're a good guy </v>

994
00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:04.610
<v Speaker 3>because you base yourself on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>intentions and the whole world is </v>

995
00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:04.800
<v Speaker 3>reacting to your actions.</v>

996
00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.260
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

997
00:45:07.261 --> 00:45:09.450
<v Speaker 3>Don't they know that I'm saying I </v>
<v Speaker 3>intended and I'm like,</v>

998
00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:10.850
<v Speaker 3>none of that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

999
00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:12.720
<v Speaker 3>if you step on a dude's shoes and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>

1000
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:15.360
<v Speaker 3>you didn't mean to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His shoes are still fucking dirty.</v>

1001
00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:20.450
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so like just bringing all that shit </v>

1002
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:23.121
<v Speaker 3>into my everyday and I think the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing more and more that I think about </v>

1003
00:45:23.121 --> 00:45:23.460
<v Speaker 3>is heightening awareness and the more </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are aware,</v>

1004
00:45:23.461 --> 00:45:25.410
<v Speaker 3>the less dumb you are and the less dumb </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>

1005
00:45:25.411 --> 00:45:27.480
<v Speaker 3>the better off you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a really good.</v>

1006
00:45:27.481 --> 00:45:30.210
<v Speaker 3>You can train yourself to be more aware,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1007
00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:35.240
<v Speaker 3>Yes you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it happens all the time and you </v>

1008
00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:35.240
<v Speaker 3>don't just get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you get layers of it,</v>

1009
00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>layers.</v>

1010
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:41.270

<v Speaker 3>That's all great way of putting it the </v>

1011
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:43.281
<v Speaker 3>whole way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just said it is a great way of </v>

1012
00:45:43.281 --> 00:45:43.281
<v Speaker 3>putting it.</v>

1013
00:45:43.281 --> 00:45:45.440
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people think that </v>

<v Speaker 3>get away with something because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>hustling,</v>

1112
00:49:45.421 --> 00:49:47.971
<v Speaker 3>care of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew he'd be a good steward of it and </v>

<v Speaker 3>It's like demand that you get better </v>

1256
00:55:22.431 --> 00:55:25.131
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a powerful way to look at </v>

1257
00:55:25.131 --> 00:55:25.131
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some,</v>

1258
00:55:25.131 --> 00:55:25.131
<v Speaker 3>some wrestling mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1259
00:55:25.131 --> 00:55:27.270
<v Speaker 3>those wrestlers are fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a different breed of guy.</v>

1260
00:55:27.271 --> 00:55:28.260
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to do this.</v>

1261
00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:33.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you have that with boxers you </v>

1262
00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:35.751
<v Speaker 3>have that would kick box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have that with anybody who is just </v>

1263
00:55:35.751 --> 00:55:37.590
<v Speaker 3>fanatical about improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have that insane,</v>

1264
00:55:37.591 --> 00:55:42.591
<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the drive to believe fiction and </v>

1265
00:55:42.591 --> 00:55:42.591
<v Speaker 3>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1266
00:55:42.591 --> 00:55:44.310
<v Speaker 3>But you got to be obsessed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1267
00:55:44.490 --> 00:55:49.490
<v Speaker 3>If you're not obsessed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to beat the guys </v>

1268
00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:51.470
<v Speaker 3>obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when I saw fucking foundry </v>

1269
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.470
<v Speaker 3>Ellen's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he first came down,</v>

1270
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:54.710
<v Speaker 3>the first time I'd ever seen him was </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I never knew anything about him </v>

1271
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:55.860
<v Speaker 3>until he beat up Stephan Bonner and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was live at that fight and I was like,</v>

1272
00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:58.770
<v Speaker 3>holy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was just learning back then,</v>

1273
00:55:58.810 --> 00:56:00.820
<v Speaker 3>didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the throws I was like,</v>

1274
00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:05.310
<v Speaker 3>and Stephens is maybe bigger than me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking nuts.</v>

1275
00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.900
<v Speaker 3>Not Small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's good.</v>

1276
00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.570
<v Speaker 3>He's adept at everything and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting them with elbows,</v>

1277
00:56:09.571 --> 00:56:14.571
<v Speaker 3>like their jabs and knees and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>throwing them like crate anytime it'd </v>

1278
00:56:14.571 --> 00:56:14.571
<v Speaker 3>get close to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw them.</v>

1279
00:56:14.571 --> 00:56:15.030
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy fuck.</v>

1280
00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.620
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1281
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:19.740
<v Speaker 3>a month or two months later he came to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jackson's and he's there and I'm like,</v>

1282
00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.480
<v Speaker 3>I was eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I knew he wrestled,</v>

1283
00:56:21.481 --> 00:56:22.890
<v Speaker 3>like I knew a bunch of tough wrestlers </v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

1284
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:23.890
<v Speaker 3>from uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York.</v>

1285
00:56:23.891 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

1286
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:24.950
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1287
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.150
<v Speaker 1>where'd you there Moitai though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because like Tom Watson,</v>

1288
00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:32.650
<v Speaker 1>or he'd just gotten back from a Dutch </v>
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing camp and dudes go to Thailand</v>

1289
00:56:32.651 --> 00:56:34.560
<v Speaker 1>all the time and there's all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1290
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.320
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1291
00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:41.110
<v Speaker 1>youtube fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1292
00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.970
<v Speaker 1>like dudes are dying and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

1293
00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:43.810
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1294
00:56:43.811 --> 00:56:45.420
<v Speaker 1>I look at it and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1295
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:48.040
<v Speaker 1>And then I believe and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy fuck,</v>

1296
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:51.730
<v Speaker 1>like no proper training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just watches shit on a video.</v>

1297
00:56:51.731 --> 00:56:54.280
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't watch the matrix.</v>

1298
00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:56.730
<v Speaker 1>He's a special talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is a special talent.</v>

1299
00:56:57.250 --> 00:57:01.300
<v Speaker 1>One of the problems with John is that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely has worked hard,</v>

1300
00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:05.410
<v Speaker 1>but it has come way easier for him than </v>
<v Speaker 1>it has for other people and I think part</v>

1301
00:57:05.411 --> 00:57:08.830
<v Speaker 1>of that is because he grew up with two </v>
<v Speaker 1>super athletes for brothers.</v>

1302
00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Kenny wouldn't match you just getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>your ass kicked all the time in your </v>

1303
00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:16.651
<v Speaker 1>house by giant super athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both his brothers are NFL fucking </v>

1304
00:57:16.651 --> 00:57:16.651
<v Speaker 1>allstars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1305
00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:17.320
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1306
00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:22.350
<v Speaker 1>he's got a super athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always joke about it is whatever comes </v>

1307
00:57:23.501 --> 00:57:25.120
<v Speaker 1>out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just Nike should sponsor.</v>

1308
00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:29.110
<v Speaker 1>We're all super athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So true.</v>

1309
00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:30.700
<v Speaker 1>It's so true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1310
00:57:30.701 --> 00:57:34.780
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his level is just right out.</v>

1311
00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:37.000
<v Speaker 1>They used to beat them up or whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just like,</v>

1312
00:57:37.001 --> 00:57:38.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The toughest one in my family is like,</v>

1313
00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:41.260
<v Speaker 1>my brothers will beat my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The younger brother,</v>

1314
00:57:41.261 --> 00:57:46.261
<v Speaker 1>his younger brother beat his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like his younger brother was talking </v>

1315
00:57:46.261 --> 00:57:49.381
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in an interview they asked for tmz </v>

1316
00:57:49.381 --> 00:57:49.381
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1317
00:57:49.381 --> 00:57:49.381
<v Speaker 1>I'll beat his ass right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1318
00:57:49.381 --> 00:57:51.010
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't remember when he watched,</v>

1319
00:57:51.011 --> 00:57:51.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1320
00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:55.570
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he chokes the Oto and I'm like,</v>

1321
00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:00.840
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't even really know how to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at that or when he choked </v>

1322
00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:00.840
<v Speaker 1>bader I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yoda.</v>

1323
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Choke was a great job because he knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to push.</v>

1324
00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:05.800
<v Speaker 1>He's the first one doesn't cover the </v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

1325
00:58:05.830 --> 00:58:07.060
<v Speaker 1>covers the head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he also,</v>

1326
00:58:07.061 --> 00:58:09.520
<v Speaker 1>he pushes the arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1327
00:58:09.521 --> 00:58:14.521
<v Speaker 1>he pushes his palm back just learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sees that he's learning in these </v>

1328
00:58:14.521 --> 00:58:14.521
<v Speaker 1>moments.</v>

1329
00:58:14.521 --> 00:58:16.910
<v Speaker 1>We so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How scared I was like,</v>

1330
00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:22.280
<v Speaker 1>like Beta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked great against Rashad fucking </v>

1331
00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.871
<v Speaker 1>look like at different athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a different athlete over the </v>

1332
00:58:24.871 --> 00:58:24.871
<v Speaker 1>last four fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bader is,</v>

1333
00:58:24.871 --> 00:58:28.920
<v Speaker 1>he's been number back then when he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>just relied on wrestling that Jon Jones </v>

1334
00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:33.060
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When do you see a sun kissed kid </v>

1335
00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:34.750
<v Speaker 1>wrestler pull half guard like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he just was like,</v>

1336
00:58:34.751 --> 00:58:37.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get in a bad position.</v>

1337
00:58:37.301 --> 00:58:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I can hang onto this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1338
00:58:38.531 --> 00:58:43.531
<v Speaker 1>he was just overwhelmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a kind of power that like </v>

1339
00:58:43.531 --> 00:58:47.580
<v Speaker 1>he'd never felt in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge top of the food chain </v>

1340
00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:47.580
<v Speaker 1>wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1341
00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:51.801
<v Speaker 1>let's see how special John Is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't look at how good glover to</v>

1342
00:58:52.211 --> 00:58:54.490
<v Speaker 1>share his looked against everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but John,</v>

1343
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:59.520
<v Speaker 1>well Phil Davis did beat his ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Phil Davis beat his ass when he was </v>

1344
00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:03.331
<v Speaker 1>fighting out of Connecticut and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder was all fucked up for the John </v>

1345
00:59:03.331 --> 00:59:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Jones fight and there's a lot of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with this camp.</v>

1346
00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:09.940
<v Speaker 1>Go overhead is has the right mentality </v>
<v Speaker 1>to as far as like a stocking and getting</v>

1347
00:59:09.941 --> 00:59:14.941
<v Speaker 1>really aggressive towards cones and </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the center because John just </v>

1348
00:59:14.941 --> 00:59:15.480
<v Speaker 1>takes the center of the ring and makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody running.</v>

1349
00:59:15.481 --> 00:59:20.481
<v Speaker 1>The circle around him was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the fascinating things </v>

1350
00:59:20.481 --> 00:59:24.121
<v Speaker 1>about their fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glover was like loading up on and John </v>

1351
00:59:24.121 --> 00:59:24.121
<v Speaker 1>was just aware of everything and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1352
00:59:24.121 --> 00:59:24.510
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't fight them.</v>

1353
00:59:24.511 --> 00:59:29.511
<v Speaker 1>I know you guys are looking like they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to put them away and it's like he </v>

1354
00:59:29.511 --> 00:59:31.840
<v Speaker 1>sees too much to be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to really.</v>

1355
00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.500
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to surprise him with </v>
<v Speaker 1>one shot?</v>

1356
00:59:33.501 --> 00:59:34.790
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible though.</v>

1357
00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:37.760
<v Speaker 1>When you think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible that he has that sort of</v>

1358
00:59:37.761 --> 00:59:41.930
<v Speaker 1>awareness with relatively small amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time striking.</v>

1359
00:59:41.931 --> 00:59:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1360
00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:46.730
<v Speaker 1>when you consider his entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact it's only 27 wins.</v>

1361
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:48.770
<v Speaker 1>The title at 23,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1362
00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:50.930
<v Speaker 1>the growth is in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>22 or 23.</v>

1363
00:59:50.931 --> 00:59:52.880
<v Speaker 1>They want the title to 22.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like so.</v>

1364
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:58.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean I hate what happened with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to see a guy run into that,</v>

1365
01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:06.080
<v Speaker 1>that classic Cliche of partying and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>messing up his life and,</v>

1366
01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.050
<v Speaker 1>and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hit and run.</v>

1367
01:00:09.051 --> 01:00:11.390
<v Speaker 1>So God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's that youth stuff,</v>

1368
01:00:11.391 --> 01:00:14.270
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the thing that I'm like,</v>

1369
01:00:14.271 --> 01:00:19.271
<v Speaker 1>I would just ask everybody to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>gracious looking at it in that way </v>

1370
01:00:19.271 --> 01:00:20.150
<v Speaker 1>because it's shit that maybe not </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody does,</v>

1371
01:00:20.151 --> 01:00:25.151
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of young dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go through that shit and he went </v>

1372
01:00:25.151 --> 01:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>through it at a later time maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a way public time.</v>

1373
01:00:26.601 --> 01:00:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1374
01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:31.760
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that when you're so </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicized like that people are going to</v>

1375
01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:34.870
<v Speaker 1>see all your words and there's nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's walking without words.</v>

1376
01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:39.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the problems with the way </v>

1377
01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:39.880
<v Speaker 1>we view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think politics,</v>

1378
01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:39.880
<v Speaker 1>I think everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1379
01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:41.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pee before the Internet,</v>

1380
01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:44.810
<v Speaker 1>like all those politicians are </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretending that they didn't fuck kids or</v>

1381
01:00:44.811 --> 01:00:48.360
<v Speaker 1>have affairs or blood or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

1382
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:50.290
<v Speaker 1>That's jared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1383
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:54.140
<v Speaker 1>but I know what you're saying and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

1384
01:00:54.141 --> 01:00:56.840
<v Speaker 1>And it's like when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you live with transparency,</v>

1385
01:00:56.841 --> 01:00:58.760
<v Speaker 1>like we have a lot more transparency </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1386
01:00:58.761 --> 01:01:03.761
<v Speaker 1>It's like everybody's seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no cover ups of scandals except </v>

1387
01:01:03.761 --> 01:01:07.031
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But beyond that they chose black </v>

1388
01:01:07.031 --> 01:01:07.390
<v Speaker 1>helicopters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1389
01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:08.390
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1390
01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:13.460
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it's going to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics in the future if you're going </v>

1391
01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:13.460
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are going to be forced to just be</v>

1392
01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.380
<v Speaker 1>human and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the thing.</v>

1393
01:01:15.381 --> 01:01:20.381
<v Speaker 1>Grow and will be a real person because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that speech type style of delivery with </v>

1394
01:01:20.381 --> 01:01:21.650
<v Speaker 1>a not real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1395
01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>that they do with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1396
01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:25.380
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president of United States.</v>

1397
01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My fellow Americans today is a day that </v>

1398
01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:33.230
<v Speaker 1>will live in infamy of speech writers </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have this template and they want to</v>

1399
01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:35.930
<v Speaker 1>put that template.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also like the tone,</v>

1400
01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:38.240
<v Speaker 1>the way they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they speak,</v>

1401
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:43.270
<v Speaker 1>it's all fake and I always wonder like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we going to come to a point in time </v>

1402
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:47.141
<v Speaker 1>where a guy gets onstage where a woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets on stage as the president and </v>

1403
01:01:47.141 --> 01:01:50.720
<v Speaker 1>speaks like a human and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's our situation.</v>

1404
01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.280
<v Speaker 1>This is where we're at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have,</v>

1405
01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:57.290
<v Speaker 1>we have a real problem with Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have when going to run for president.</v>

1406
01:01:57.291 --> 01:01:58.040
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kanye West,</v>

1407
01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.960
<v Speaker 1>I think Atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kanye,</v>

1408
01:01:59.961 --> 01:02:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Kanye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kanye up and debate.</v>

1409
01:02:02.241 --> 01:02:04.880
<v Speaker 1>So for sure you would run trains on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate.</v>

1410
01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:08.090
<v Speaker 1>He was racing a train trying to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>over you.</v>

1411
01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:11.150
<v Speaker 1>It has a connotation that I gave you </v>
<v Speaker 1>your time,</v>

1412
01:02:11.151 --> 01:02:12.320
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be awesome.</v>

1413
01:02:12.321 --> 01:02:13.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not Taylor swift.</v>

1414
01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:16.580
<v Speaker 1>That would be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1415
01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:17.840
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1416
01:02:17.841 --> 01:02:18.970
<v Speaker 1>I feel like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1417
01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:21.180
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we take for granted from old ideas,</v>

1418
01:02:21.181 --> 01:02:26.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like it goes back to polly's </v>

1419
01:02:26.181 --> 01:02:26.181
<v Speaker 1>shorter going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody knows how to do it.</v>

1420
01:02:26.181 --> 01:02:26.970
<v Speaker 1>There was no path when you make your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>path,</v>

1421
01:02:26.971 --> 01:02:27.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

1422
01:02:27.781 --> 01:02:32.781
<v Speaker 1>Because Paul came from standup and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's absolutely no path and stand up </v>

1423
01:02:32.781 --> 01:02:35.300
<v Speaker 1>like no one because at least like with </v>
<v Speaker 1>acting role,</v>

1424
01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.670
<v Speaker 1>some open mics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fletcher,</v>

1425
01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the same thing.</v>

1426
01:02:40.351 --> 01:02:42.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1427
01:02:42.031 --> 01:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's down.</v>

1428
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:44.010
<v Speaker 1>He wants to kill it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

1429
01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:47.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had eddie do it like he probably these</v>

1430
01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:47.950
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like eight times.</v>

1431
01:02:47.951 --> 01:02:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he say?</v>

1432
01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

1433
01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1434
01:02:51.721 --> 01:02:53.940
<v Speaker 1>I had the stroke that I thought was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome and it just,</v>

1435
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:57.250
<v Speaker 1>it was about hookers and it just didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1436
01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one and uh,</v>

1437
01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:00.930
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1438
01:03:00.931 --> 01:03:05.931
<v Speaker 1>you look at all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these old ideas that people haven't </v>

1439
01:03:05.931 --> 01:03:08.121
<v Speaker 1>even like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole stigma of like what we have </v>

1440
01:03:08.121 --> 01:03:08.121
<v Speaker 1>low attention span.</v>

1441
01:03:08.121 --> 01:03:08.121
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at it wherever my phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1442
01:03:08.121 --> 01:03:10.350
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at our phones all the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>or this and that.</v>

1443
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:12.270
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at that and you go,</v>

1444
01:03:12.271 --> 01:03:17.271
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I were a corporate media thing and I </v>

1445
01:03:17.271 --> 01:03:18.900
<v Speaker 1>wanted to put out a fucking new </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment thing and it's going to be</v>

1446
01:03:18.901 --> 01:03:23.901
<v Speaker 1>anywhere from an hour to three hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>long and it's just going to be guys </v>

1447
01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:25.620
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any corporation would be like,</v>

1448
01:03:25.621 --> 01:03:27.690
<v Speaker 1>that's never going to catch on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need sound bites,</v>

1449
01:03:27.691 --> 01:03:31.740
<v Speaker 1>we need MTV news like we need fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you look at podcasts and you look at</v>

1450
01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:36.741
<v Speaker 1>what they are and people are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>more invested in that because it's real </v>

1451
01:03:36.741 --> 01:03:37.920
<v Speaker 1>because there's authentic voices to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1452
01:03:37.921 --> 01:03:42.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the number one things </v>

1453
01:03:42.921 --> 01:03:42.921
<v Speaker 1>that people said to me when I first </v>
<v Speaker 1>started out,</v>

1454
01:03:42.921 --> 01:03:46.461
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do three hour podcasts right </v>

1455
01:03:46.461 --> 01:03:46.461
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1456
01:03:46.461 --> 01:03:46.461
<v Speaker 1>Why or why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

1457
01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:51.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because no one's going to listen to </v>

1458
01:03:51.590 --> 01:03:51.590
<v Speaker 1>three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1459
01:03:51.590 --> 01:03:51.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to write.</v>

1460
01:03:51.590 --> 01:03:51.600
<v Speaker 1>You can just shut it off like I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it.</v>

1461
01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:55.440
<v Speaker 1>That's why I had like an argument is </v>
<v Speaker 1>about as long as you just having fun.</v>

1462
01:03:55.441 --> 01:03:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Who gives a fuck our.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was adamant about it.</v>

1463
01:03:57.991 --> 01:03:59.970
<v Speaker 1>You have to enter your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just telling you right now,</v>

1464
01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:01.470
<v Speaker 1>you have to edit your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1465
01:04:01.471 --> 01:04:02.370
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1466
01:04:02.371 --> 01:04:03.390
<v Speaker 1>because it's too long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1467
01:04:03.391 --> 01:04:03.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what?</v>

1468
01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:08.070
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also more importantly is that a road</v>

1469
01:04:08.071 --> 01:04:11.400
<v Speaker 1>that you've walked you have experienced </v>
<v Speaker 1>with yours being too long,</v>

1470
01:04:11.401 --> 01:04:14.940
<v Speaker 1>but everybody was compelling but nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>had any experience at all.</v>

1471
01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:17.190
<v Speaker 1>But they thought about it like a comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>central show,</v>

1472
01:04:17.191 --> 01:04:21.210
<v Speaker 1>like an hour long show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which then speaks to the thing about old</v>

1473
01:04:21.211 --> 01:04:22.440
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old ideas.</v>

1474
01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:25.460
<v Speaker 1>You've got to put away your old ideas if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be on the tip of the sphere.</v>

1475
01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Don't even think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1476
01:04:26.941 --> 01:04:31.020
<v Speaker 1>my point of view was like you and I long</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we ever did podcast,</v>

1477
01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:35.610
<v Speaker 1>we always had these conversations before</v>
<v Speaker 1>a show or after show or hanging out.</v>

1478
01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:38.040
<v Speaker 1>We would talk for hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours and hours.</v>

1479
01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:42.330
<v Speaker 1>And it seemed to me like a half hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the conversation or 45 minutes,</v>

1480
01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.500
<v Speaker 1>shit just started getting cookie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1481
01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:45.120
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1482
01:04:45.121 --> 01:04:46.440
<v Speaker 1>an hour later we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1483
01:04:46.441 --> 01:04:46.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1484
01:04:46.891 --> 01:04:48.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then blah blah blah.</v>

1485
01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:51.930
<v Speaker 1>And then the stories come out and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember this one time and those are the</v>

1486
01:04:51.931 --> 01:04:54.600
<v Speaker 1>fun conversation and you get to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and then,</v>

1487
01:04:54.930 --> 01:04:57.000
<v Speaker 1>and then he would make that into an </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience and the fuck.</v>

1488
01:04:57.001 --> 01:04:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Then they get to know you and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not like,</v>

1489
01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:01.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not all this,</v>

1490
01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these barriers between us all.</v>

1491
01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:09.800
<v Speaker 1>We're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all see our similarities and there's </v>

1492
01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:09.800
<v Speaker 1>less dissension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's less animosity,</v>

1493
01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:14.421
<v Speaker 1>there's more understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more graciousness and </v>

1494
01:05:14.421 --> 01:05:14.421
<v Speaker 1>generosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

1495
01:05:14.421 --> 01:05:18.231
<v Speaker 1>if we could get that way with everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if everybody felt that way instead of </v>

1496
01:05:18.231 --> 01:05:21.741
<v Speaker 1>this corporate dominion though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what CNN says that we need this </v>

1497
01:05:21.741 --> 01:05:24.721
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have direct feedback from other </v>

1498
01:05:24.721 --> 01:05:24.721
<v Speaker 1>people about what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1499
01:05:24.721 --> 01:05:26.800
<v Speaker 1>And that feedback has been super </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable to me,</v>

1500
01:05:26.801 --> 01:05:28.270
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the negative stuff,</v>

1501
01:05:28.271 --> 01:05:33.271
<v Speaker 1>the negative stuff like you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody likes to hear criticisms about </v>

1502
01:05:33.271 --> 01:05:33.670
<v Speaker 1>what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you consider it and find warriors</v>

1503
01:05:33.671 --> 01:05:38.671
<v Speaker 1>enter a truth in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could find out a lot about your </v>

1504
01:05:38.671 --> 01:05:41.971
<v Speaker 1>style or of you just interviewing people</v>
<v Speaker 1>or talking to people where you make </v>

1505
01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:43.210
<v Speaker 1>mistakes and you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's perfect.</v>

1506
01:05:43.211 --> 01:05:44.890
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1507
01:05:44.891 --> 01:05:48.700
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to have a podcast that </v>
<v Speaker 1>every word comes out perfect.</v>

1508
01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:51.970
<v Speaker 1>It's just not possible because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>free dollar ads.</v>

1509
01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I freaking lost.</v>

1510
01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.900
<v Speaker 1>You stumble on all the time and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't fucking matter.</v>

1511
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:58.620
<v Speaker 1>But if somebody were dragging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1512
01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:00.670
<v Speaker 1>they would want to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it again.</v>

1513
01:06:00.730 --> 01:06:02.430
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have.</v>

1514
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:04.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean sometimes I have to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1515
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:09.870
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this medium is new and no one had it </v>

1516
01:06:10.901 --> 01:06:15.901
<v Speaker 1>before and this medium is like they gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>these kids the controls like the gave </v>

1517
01:06:16.511 --> 01:06:21.511
<v Speaker 1>these kids the ability to broadcast a </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio show and then they just did it </v>

1518
01:06:21.511 --> 01:06:21.820
<v Speaker 1>their way and then it go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1519
01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:26.880
<v Speaker 1>why don't we just start talking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just see what happens if we don't </v>

1520
01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:30.811
<v Speaker 1>have commercials in the middle of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is like as long as you're </v>

1521
01:06:30.811 --> 01:06:30.811
<v Speaker 1>having fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the person involved in it?</v>

1522
01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

1523
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:35.170
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what the result is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a way it's like,</v>

1524
01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.040
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda like it's like a fight or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy sketch or what?</v>

1525
01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:44.280
<v Speaker 1>When you go up and you try a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's not an and you're </v>

1526
01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:44.890
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure it out and do it the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best you can in real time.</v>

1527
01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Right in real time with no script and </v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1528
01:06:47.681 --> 01:06:52.681
<v Speaker 1>but that's like being in competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's competition is where greatness </v>

1529
01:06:52.681 --> 01:06:56.911
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People figure shit out in the crazy way </v>

1530
01:06:56.911 --> 01:06:57.790
<v Speaker 1>inside of that kind of pressure and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you step on stage,</v>

1531
01:06:57.970 --> 01:07:00.280
<v Speaker 1>you've got an increased amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're in your living room</v>

1532
01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:02.050
<v Speaker 1>in front of your mirror trying to say a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking joke.</v>

1533
01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.500
<v Speaker 1>It means something different so you grow</v>
<v Speaker 1>more in that competition.</v>

1534
01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:07.800
<v Speaker 1>The second mean more the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments.</v>

1535
01:07:07.810 --> 01:07:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that stuff and you don't get that</v>

1536
01:07:10.121 --> 01:07:13.650
<v Speaker 1>if you're not willing to throw it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and expose yourself live and that's like</v>

1537
01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:14.860
<v Speaker 1>putting this live on the Internet.</v>

1538
01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a huge exposure and either </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an authentic person that's got </v>

1539
01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:21.130
<v Speaker 1>something or you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And and it becomes like.</v>

1540
01:07:21.131 --> 01:07:26.131
<v Speaker 1>I think it's super visible and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's super important that we all get to </v>

1541
01:07:26.131 --> 01:07:28.150
<v Speaker 1>that instead of all these masks that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>wear all the time.</v>

1542
01:07:28.151 --> 01:07:28.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1543
01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.140
<v Speaker 1>and to me it doesn't matter if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1544
01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:32.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1545
01:07:32.650 --> 01:07:37.650
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you saying that I'm sure if he only </v>

1546
01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:38.680
<v Speaker 1>feels differently now laughs about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like if you're.</v>

1547
01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.540
<v Speaker 1>So does that mean that you don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation?</v>

1548
01:07:40.541 --> 01:07:42.220
<v Speaker 1>This is more than 15 minutes with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend,</v>

1549
01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:47.620
<v Speaker 1>like 40 minute thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like he thought it had to be </v>

1550
01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:48.820
<v Speaker 1>like an hour because a show is an hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>but not a real hour,</v>

1551
01:07:48.821 --> 01:07:50.770
<v Speaker 1>42 minutes because we got to have to out</v>
<v Speaker 1>for commercials.</v>

1552
01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Most people do the commercials in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of Shit too,</v>

1553
01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:57.180
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1554
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:59.740
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried what you ever watch that show?</v>

1555
01:07:59.741 --> 01:08:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a new fear.</v>

1556
01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:05.790
<v Speaker 1>The walking dead is the new walk now </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing an ad for a really dope.</v>

1557
01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:10.850
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought the walking dead was going to </v>

1558
01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:10.850
<v Speaker 1>be shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I watched it and I was like,</v>

1559
01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:13.300
<v Speaker 1>and then I watched like six or 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>episodes and I was like,</v>

1560
01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:15.350
<v Speaker 1>this is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same episode again.</v>

1561

1562
01:08:20.351 --> 01:08:23.350

<v Speaker 1>Fear the walking dead is interesting </v>

1563
01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:25.430
<v Speaker 1>because it's less special effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got Less zombies and it's better and the</v>

1629
01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:23.360
<v Speaker 1>could put all my money and vet and go </v>

<v Speaker 1>those land cruisers.</v>

1673

<v Speaker 1>It doesn't need to be that way.</v>

1686
01:13:32.191 --> 01:13:33.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to support that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

1687

01:13:59.641 --> 01:14:03.360
<v Speaker 1>they're actual real four wheel drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>truck because based off the Land Cruiser</v>

1700
01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Platform,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Land Cruiser.</v>

01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:37.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

1823
01:18:37.041 --> 01:18:39.110
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the kindest,</v>

1824
01:18:39.111 --> 01:18:40.730
<v Speaker 3>friendliest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you hear and you're like,</v>

1825
01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:45.850
<v Speaker 3>holy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of the nicest people I know were </v>

1826
01:18:45.850 --> 01:18:46.640
<v Speaker 3>special operators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I talked to him too.</v>

1827
01:18:46.641 --> 01:18:48.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how come there's a.</v>

1828
01:18:48.231 --> 01:18:50.570
<v Speaker 3>He gave me a real insight into that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about how come there's not,</v>

1829
01:18:51.130 --> 01:18:56.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm more like would withdraw from war </v>
<v Speaker 3>from guys that are special operators </v>

1830
01:18:57.741 --> 01:19:00.200
<v Speaker 3>than regular guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like everybody that has ptsd,</v>

1831
01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:02.670
<v Speaker 3>like there's a ton of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1832
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:03.200
<v Speaker 3>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1833
01:19:03.201 --> 01:19:04.760
<v Speaker 3>there's not a lot in our community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

1834
01:19:04.761 --> 01:19:05.570
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

1835
01:19:05.571 --> 01:19:06.140
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1836
01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:09.630
<v Speaker 3>because if you're a regular guy on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground and you're you,</v>

1837
01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:12.140
<v Speaker 3>you can't engage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be reactive.</v>

1838
01:19:12.170 --> 01:19:17.170
<v Speaker 3>You have to be fired upon or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's rules of engagement and he goes </v>

1839
01:19:17.170 --> 01:19:20.771
<v Speaker 3>for us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're predators and we're going out to </v>

1840
01:19:20.771 --> 01:19:21.170
<v Speaker 3>engage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's a different mindset.</v>

1841
01:19:21.170 --> 01:19:26.170
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in a place of either being </v>

1842
01:19:26.170 --> 01:19:26.170
<v Speaker 3>defensive or offensive and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>defensive,</v>

1843
01:19:26.170 --> 01:19:28.490
<v Speaker 3>you're pray in a way and you get to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>reactive to that,</v>

1844
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:33.790
<v Speaker 3>but he's like world hunting and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like also by the time you get to that </v>

1845
01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:36.791
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're very dialed in about who you are </v>

1846
01:19:36.791 --> 01:19:37.460
<v Speaker 3>and what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is super interesting.</v>

1847
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:38.630
<v Speaker 3>That does make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1848
01:19:38.631 --> 01:19:40.920
<v Speaker 3>it's like because he talked to Tim and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tim's like,</v>

1849
01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.280
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Shit's not present to him at all.</v>

1850
01:19:43.281 --> 01:19:43.790
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1851
01:19:43.791 --> 01:19:44.900
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking.</v>

1852
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:47.210
<v Speaker 3>When he was on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about it.</v>

1853
01:19:47.211 --> 01:19:48.380
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1854
01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:53.440
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>throwing acid on girls that were going </v>

1855
01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:53.440
<v Speaker 3>to school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1856
01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:53.440
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I killed those guys.</v>

1857
01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1858
01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:57.740
<v Speaker 3>and when you say it like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm right there with you.</v>

1859
01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:58.850
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I was there,</v>

1860
01:19:58.851 --> 01:20:00.350
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it 100 percent.</v>

1861
01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:02.600
<v Speaker 3>And that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the type of guys you want.</v>

1862
01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:03.890
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1863
01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:05.420
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot of those guys out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1864
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:07.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a reason why it's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking hard</v>

1865
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:13.010
<v Speaker 2>to become a navy seal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason why it's so hard to be </v>

1866
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:13.010
<v Speaker 2>a ranger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1867
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:13.010
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

1868
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:17.830
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the kind of shit like marcus </v>

1869
01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:17.830
<v Speaker 3>trail talks about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1870
01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:17.830
<v Speaker 3>you've got to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1871
01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:19.500
<v Speaker 3>if you get through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you've got to be willing to die,</v>

1872
01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:20.610
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1873
01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:21.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1874
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:22.290
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1875
01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:24.090
<v Speaker 3>my cousin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just got,</v>

1876
01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:29.120
<v Speaker 3>he got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is in seal team two and he got a gun </v>

1877
01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:31.430
<v Speaker 3>fight and then he got shot up and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>recovered now and I think he just </v>

1878
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:33.060
<v Speaker 3>screened for seal team six and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>year after his injury,</v>

1879
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:37.290
<v Speaker 3>but two of his friends died and in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pool and they're in,</v>

1880
01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:39.520
<v Speaker 3>they're in training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1881
01:20:39.570 --> 01:20:44.570
<v Speaker 3>Then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's completely controlled </v>

1882
01:20:44.570 --> 01:20:44.570
<v Speaker 3>environment and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

1883
01:20:44.570 --> 01:20:44.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1884
01:20:44.570 --> 01:20:48.180
<v Speaker 2>A lot of that is my friend Eric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris said when he was going through it,</v>

1885
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:52.680
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they make you drown and resuscitate you,</v>

1886
01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:57.681
<v Speaker 3>that it's part of the training that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the beginning of buds for </v>

1887
01:20:57.681 --> 01:21:00.351
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these guys are already active duty </v>

1888
01:21:00.351 --> 01:21:02.721
<v Speaker 3>combat seals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I started it and then like a few </v>

1889
01:21:02.721 --> 01:21:02.850
<v Speaker 3>weeks ago it dawned on me and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about like,</v>

1890
01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:04.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's got safety and comfort.</v>

1891
01:21:04.741 --> 01:21:05.910
<v Speaker 3>Like here's where we live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1892
01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:11.380
<v Speaker 3>And then like Greg Jackson always say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to be comfortable where other </v>

1893
01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:14.361
<v Speaker 3>men are uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you need to raise your breaking </v>

1894
01:21:14.361 --> 01:21:14.361
<v Speaker 3>point to where it's unreachable for them</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1895
01:21:14.361 --> 01:21:17.160
<v Speaker 3>and you can smash there's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

1896
01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:22.280
<v Speaker 3>so there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's safety comfort and then </v>

1897
01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:24.291
<v Speaker 3>there's death over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're pushing it and like a </v>

1898
01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:27.930
<v Speaker 3>combat arena,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for me it's a certain thing,</v>

1899
01:21:28.650 --> 01:21:33.650
<v Speaker 3>but then you get more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes opaque where death and your </v>

1900
01:21:33.650 --> 01:21:35.430
<v Speaker 3>discomfort is and those guys are so used</v>
<v Speaker 3>to being uncomfortable.</v>

1901
01:21:35.431 --> 01:21:38.190
<v Speaker 3>And then the worst situations possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they probably can't see it.</v>

1902
01:21:38.191 --> 01:21:40.590
<v Speaker 3>So they're underwater and a pool and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing whatever they're doing.</v>

1903
01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.480
<v Speaker 3>And they join,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just too late and they don't,</v>

1904
01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:47.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's something like that </v>

1905
01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:48.720
<v Speaker 3>probably where they're so fucking tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys that all,</v>

1906
01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:53.900
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they erase all there there warning </v>

1907
01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:53.900
<v Speaker 3>flags,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1908
01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:56.781
<v Speaker 3>Our body puts up his warning like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to stop this now or you're in </v>

1909
01:21:56.781 --> 01:21:56.910
<v Speaker 3>danger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it just goes away for those</v>

1910
01:21:56.911 --> 01:21:57.290
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1911
01:21:57.340 --> 01:21:58.580
<v Speaker 3>that shit doesn't exist for them anyway.</v>

1912
01:21:58.790 --> 01:22:00.320
<v Speaker 2>There's levels of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1913
01:22:00.321 --> 01:22:05.321
<v Speaker 2>Level levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's levels of competency is levels </v>

1914
01:22:05.321 --> 01:22:05.480
<v Speaker 2>of excellence and there's levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>toughness.</v>

1915
01:22:05.530 --> 01:22:10.530
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's people that put </v>

1916
01:22:10.530 --> 01:22:10.530
<v Speaker 2>themselves into situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>

1917
01:22:10.530 --> 01:22:12.260
<v Speaker 2>you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this to the average person,</v>

1918
01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:14.780
<v Speaker 2>you would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just not a smart place to be.</v>

1919
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:16.730
<v Speaker 2>But to them it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's home.</v>

1920
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.990
<v Speaker 2>That's where they're at.</v>

1921
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:19.780
<v Speaker 3>There is where they live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

1922
01:22:19.781 --> 01:22:21.460
<v Speaker 3>this is very uncomfortable for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like.</v>

1923
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:23.500
<v Speaker 3>There's a nerdist theater kicked up on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the couch.</v>

1924
01:22:23.501 --> 01:22:24.220
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is great.</v>

1925
01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:27.010
<v Speaker 2>My friend Cameron Hanes sent me a text </v>
<v Speaker 2>last night.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They're trudging through.</v>

1936
01:22:55.181 --> 01:22:58.360
<v Speaker 2>They had to find these moves and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>finally got one and it was like this big</v>

1937
01:22:58.361 --> 01:23:03.361
<v Speaker 2>triumphant that moment for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sent me a text yesterday that Roy </v>

<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

<v Speaker 2>snow was too dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so much snow.</v>

01:25:23.701 --> 01:25:25.050
<v Speaker 2>I got to the top with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1997
01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:28.440
<v Speaker 2>he's not even breathing right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2000
01:25:32.371 --> 01:25:34.710
<v Speaker 2>he could have a conversation with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I'm like,</v>

2001

<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking Steve.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Steve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2003
01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the difference between a guy who</v>

2004
01:25:39.871 --> 01:25:42.680
<v Speaker 2>runs hills and a guy who doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2005
01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:46.830
<v Speaker 2>he prepares for that specific </v>
<v Speaker 2>environmental constantly running hills,</v>

2006
01:25:46.831 --> 01:25:48.420
<v Speaker 2>constantly lifting weights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

2007
01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:50.220
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people criticize them.</v>

2008
01:25:50.221 --> 01:25:51.300
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to do that stuff.</v>

2009
01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:56.300
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to do that stuff because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to do it and they don't </v>

2010
01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:58.050
<v Speaker 2>like that someone is doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that fucking guy killed several bull</v>

2011
01:25:58.051 --> 01:26:00.000
<v Speaker 2>elk every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kills Moose.</v>

2012
01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:02.310
<v Speaker 2>Every time he goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's killing something and that's all he</v>

2013
01:26:02.311 --> 01:26:04.880
<v Speaker 2>eats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He high protein,</v>

2014

<v Speaker 2>organic meat constantly and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspirational.</v>

2015
01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:09.810
<v Speaker 2>That's what I love about a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy.</v>

2016
01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:14.960
<v Speaker 2>I've run into so many people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspired by that guy and he forces them </v>

2017
01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:19.210
<v Speaker 2>by just watching him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It forces them to get off their ass and </v>

2018
01:26:19.210 --> 01:26:20.120
<v Speaker 2>go do stuff and go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean a guy like that you had to go and</v>

2020
01:26:22.130 --> 01:26:25.820

<v Speaker 2>I'm winning and he works all day,</v>
