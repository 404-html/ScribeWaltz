00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.710
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't we assume that the reason why we're so conflicted and weird is</v>

3
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:09.030
<v Speaker 1>because that's the proper mechanism that needs to be in place for people to move</v>

4
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:10.980
<v Speaker 1>forward in the direction that we're moving forward.</v>

5
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:11.241
<v Speaker 1>It'd be,</v>

6
00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:16.241
<v Speaker 1>it'd be constantly chasing technology without any real clear sort of a rational</v>

7
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:20.970
<v Speaker 1>approach to using our resources and looking at the problems that we have because</v>

8
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:25.230
<v Speaker 1>we're like a bunch of little kids that have like shit all over their house,</v>

9
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.180
<v Speaker 1>but instead we're,</v>

10
00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 1>we're outside working on the garden,</v>

11
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:29.491
<v Speaker 1>we're planting trees,</v>

13
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:32.250
<v Speaker 1>we're not cleaning up the shit that we piled up in the middle of the living room</v>

14
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 1>and it keeps piling up every day to the point where we can't even live in our</v>

15
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:38.340
<v Speaker 1>house anymore and we're concentrating on some shit that's not even ours.</v>

16
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.460
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you could ever,</v>

17
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.650
<v Speaker 2>you probably couldn't,</v>

18
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 2>but maybe in your,</v>

19
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 2>maybe it stayed,</v>

20
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 2>like if you didn't have kids,</v>

21
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.331
<v Speaker 2>in fact big family.</v>

22
00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 2>So do you think you could ever live in like one of those airstream trailers by</v>

23
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:48.631
<v Speaker 2>myself?</v>

24
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:49.110
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

25
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.861
<v Speaker 2>Cause I was recently,</v>

26
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:52.550
<v Speaker 2>I recently went to Joshua tree and one of those and I was thinking like,</v>

27
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 2>really this is all I really need and I could take my whole fucking house</v>

28
00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:56.581
<v Speaker 2>anywhere I want.</v>

29
00:00:56.581 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 2>And the new ones have like nice wood floors</v>

30
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.210
<v Speaker 1>and some of them expand out.</v>

31
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

32
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.261
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

33
00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:02.860
<v Speaker 1>there's been,</v>

34
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people that are moving towards minimalist houses,</v>

37
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:07.870
<v Speaker 1>really small houses,</v>

38
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.170
<v Speaker 1>but there's a bunch of online that show like how certain people live.</v>

39
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.400
<v Speaker 1>And it's kind of interesting,</v>

40
00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:12.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:16.090
<v Speaker 1>like one guy figured out a way to have like this little tiny cooking area and he</v>

42
00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:17.770
<v Speaker 1>pulls the bed out in the bed,</v>

43
00:01:17.771 --> 00:01:18.371
<v Speaker 1>comes out of the wall.</v>

44
00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:20.920
<v Speaker 1>He lives by himself and he has like some storage up in top,</v>

45
00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:22.540
<v Speaker 1>like toilet paper and things along those lines.</v>

46
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.650
<v Speaker 1>But it's a tiny,</v>

47
00:01:23.651 --> 00:01:26.020
<v Speaker 1>tiny little house and a little kitchen dinette area.</v>

48
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.891
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

49
00:01:26.891 --> 00:01:27.790
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that like,</v>

50
00:01:27.791 --> 00:01:28.180
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

51
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.690
<v Speaker 1>why do we have to have this giant fucking footprint of House that we live in?</v>

52
00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:31.961
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

53
00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:32.490
