00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Her freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.350
<v Speaker 1>What does Michael Phelps listened to who might be down 10</v>

3
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.150
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't give a fuck.</v>

4
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.463
<v Speaker 1>That is weird,</v>

5
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.921
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

6
00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:13.720
<v Speaker 1>I think you just got to be that guy.</v>

7
00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:14.830
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be that good,</v>

8
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.840
<v Speaker 1>who else is as good as him?</v>

9
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever.</v>

10
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

11
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Who else has that intense?</v>

12
00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:20.404
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

13
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

14
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.270
<v Speaker 1>He takes it all to the next level.</v>

15
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>God Damn crazy people out there winning gold medals.</v>

16
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:28.980
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fucking impressive.</v>

17
00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:29.731
<v Speaker 1>Smokes a lot of weed.</v>

18
00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:30.550
<v Speaker 1>I hear.</v>

19
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.250
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] did you hear about the DEA this morning?</v>

21
00:00:34.251 --> 00:00:35.870
<v Speaker 2>That really pissed me off.</v>

22
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.400
<v Speaker 2>They decided not to reclassify marijuana weight.</v>

23
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.830
<v Speaker 2>So they're keeping it in the same category as heroin.</v>

24
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

25
00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Of stuff.</v>

26
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.540
<v Speaker 1>They decided that it has no medical benefits.</v>

27
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Now how?</v>

28
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Why can't we</v>

29
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.030
<v Speaker 2>take him to one of these kids that have seizures and just go here,</v>

30
00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:52.510
<v Speaker 2>watch,</v>

31
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.880
<v Speaker 2>see seizure now see no seizure.</v>

32
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.361
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

33
00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Shut the fuck up.</v>

34
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.981
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

35
00:00:56.981 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 2>common sense knows common sensor,</v>

36
00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.911
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

37
00:00:58.911 --> 00:00:59.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

38
00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:00:59.231 --> 00:00:59.741
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

40
00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:00.880
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely evidence.</v>

41
00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:02.710
<v Speaker 1>But I mean there's many,</v>

42
00:01:02.711 --> 00:01:03.670
<v Speaker 1>many cases of that.</v>

43
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.750
<v Speaker 1>That is evidence that there's this test being done on these children in the real</v>

44
00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:09.070
<v Speaker 1>world and it's working.</v>

45
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.881
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

46
00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:11.530
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it's scientific,</v>

47
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.090
<v Speaker 1>double blind,</v>

49
00:01:13.091 --> 00:01:14.380
<v Speaker 1>placebo controlled evidence.</v>

50
00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:14.561
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

51
00:01:14.561 --> 00:01:19.180
<v Speaker 1>but there's plenty of evidence about the medicinal benefits of cannabis.</v>

52
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.140
<v Speaker 1>There's a plenty of it.</v>

53
00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:20.561
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty,</v>

54
00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:20.830
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

55
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.220
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of data that seems to indicate that it has some sort of a role</v>

56
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.780
<v Speaker 1>in reducing tumors.</v>

57
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.860
<v Speaker 1>It can,</v>

58
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.110
<v Speaker 1>it definitely helps people with anxiety.</v>

59
00:01:29.111 --> 00:01:29.381
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

60
00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:32.620
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of factors that it does that.</v>

61
00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:33.454
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

62
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:34.701
<v Speaker 1>when Neil Brennan was on,</v>

64
00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:36.550
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about antidepressants and he was like,</v>

65
00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:38.980
<v Speaker 1>they don't exactly know how they work.</v>

66
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.840
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really good point.</v>

67
00:01:40.841 --> 00:01:43.750
<v Speaker 1>But they sell fucking ton of different kinds of antidepressants.</v>

68
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.850
<v Speaker 1>They know how cannabis works.</v>

69
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.640
<v Speaker 1>They know that there's canaveroid receptors in the human mind,</v>

70
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 1>meaning the human brain is designed or grew up or developed alongside cannabis.</v>

71
00:01:56.171 --> 00:01:57.490
<v Speaker 1>It knows what to do with it.</v>

72
00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.650
<v Speaker 1>So when you take marijuana,</v>

73
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.440
<v Speaker 1>your body knows what it is.</v>

74
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Your body even produces some sort of cannabinoid response when you run.</v>

75
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.790
<v Speaker 1>That's part of what you're getting in the runner's high.</v>

76
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.560
<v Speaker 1>They say it's similar.</v>

77
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Is that correct?</v>

78
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.443
<v Speaker 1>I think that's correct.</v>

79
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.110
<v Speaker 1>How is this a true statement that they add in there that they don't know the</v>

80
00:02:17.111 --> 00:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>drug's chemistry is not known or reproducible?</v>

81
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.160
<v Speaker 1>I like that it says no current obsession accepted medical use because the drug's</v>

82
00:02:25.571 --> 00:02:28.600
<v Speaker 1>chemistry is not reproducible,</v>

83
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.081
<v Speaker 1>not known,</v>

84
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>and reproducible means what?</v>

85
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.120
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

86
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Meaning drugs.</v>

87
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Chemistry is not known in reproducing.</v>

88
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.680
<v Speaker 2>Meaning they can't create it in a lab.</v>

89
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

90
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.220
<v Speaker 2>or they can't make two of the same.</v>

91
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.800
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they get,</v>

92
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.100
<v Speaker 2>you can't keep the same cue.</v>

93
00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:46.290
<v Speaker 2>You can't clone the same person over and over again.</v>

94
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 2>Every time you it's a different</v>

95
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.190
<v Speaker 1>maybe because when you get it as marijuana,</v>

96
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:53.190
<v Speaker 1>there's hundreds of different types of cannabinoids apparently,</v>

97
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>and you're not just getting THC.</v>

98
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:58.700
<v Speaker 1>You're getting all kinds of other groovy shit in there to create a fee.</v>

99
00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

100
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a ton of different types of cannabinoids.</v>

101
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Let's go download a little fucking information whole young Jamie.</v>

102
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 1>How many things,</v>

103
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.361
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to guess.</v>

104
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>There's a hundred different types of cannabinoids.</v>

105
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.153
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

106
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>I would guess over a thousand.</v>

107
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

108
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

109
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 1>I also think it's 12 hours to the Pentagon.</v>

110
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>85 cannabis contains at least 85 types of cannabinoids.</v>

111
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:23.651
<v Speaker 1>Many,</v>

112
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 1>which have documented medical value.</v>

113
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 1>That was 2014 they're probably found new ones,</v>

114
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

115
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.291
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

116
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:34.291
<v Speaker 1>Now there's only over 480 natural components found in the cannabis sativa plant.</v>

117
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

118
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.033
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

119
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.450
<v Speaker 1>So that's different.</v>

120
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>So it's 480 natural components.</v>

121
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.420
<v Speaker 1>So 113 different cannabinoids says one in wicken in Wikipedia.</v>

122
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>So you know it's real.</v>

123
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.503
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

124
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.111
<v Speaker 1>scroll down.</v>

125
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:50.471
<v Speaker 1>One more.</v>

126
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:50.901
<v Speaker 1>The one that,</v>

127
00:03:50.901 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 1>this is how many different cannabinoids?</v>

128
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.513
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

129
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 1>64.</v>

130
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

131
00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:55.351
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

132
00:03:55.351 --> 00:03:55.640
<v Speaker 1>so it,</v>

133
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 1>so it varies.</v>

134
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.660
<v Speaker 1>The answers vary depending on studying year.</v>

135
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 1>This is the most recent one,</v>

136
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

137
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.020
<v Speaker 1>This is 2015 claim.</v>

138
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Going back to the marijuana thing with the DEA,</v>

139
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 1>they had that happen.</v>

140
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 1>They had to read or do that because the governor got so many sign petitions or</v>

141
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.570
<v Speaker 1>assigned names that it forced them to have to reclassify the marijuana.</v>

142
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what governor,</v>

143
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:21.400
<v Speaker 1>but whoever it was,</v>

144
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

145
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:22.241
<v Speaker 1>if they,</v>

146
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:22.421
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

147
00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 1>they acquiesce to the demands of the Internet.</v>

148
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

149
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.610
<v Speaker 1>We definitely didn't do enough then.</v>

150
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.001
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

151
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:31.930
<v Speaker 1>so if chatting more ramped up in that and they say that they couldn't clap,</v>

152
00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:32.681
<v Speaker 1>reclassified,</v>

153
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 1>they had to keep it the same because they couldn't find any health benefits from</v>

154
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:35.651
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

155
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

156
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.070
<v Speaker 1>So what happens if that same governor gets all the signatures to reclassify</v>

157
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:43.210
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes or alcohol,</v>

158
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>what would the da has to say then for the health benefits of those two?</v>

159
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Would they have to reclassify it as illegal?</v>

160
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good point.</v>

161
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.061
<v Speaker 1>Let's try it.</v>

162
00:04:52.061 --> 00:04:52.710
<v Speaker 1>See what happens.</v>

163
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see what happens.</v>

164
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:54.454
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good point.</v>

165
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:55.743
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good point.</v>

166
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 1>And here's another really good point.</v>

167
00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:58.330
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

168
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.990
<v Speaker 1>they're classifying it in schedule one cause that's where it's been.</v>

169
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.750
<v Speaker 1>And because they're,</v>

170
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 1>they claim there's no known medical use or it can't be reproducible,</v>

171
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck that means,</v>

172
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>you can grow it dummy.</v>

173
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.610
<v Speaker 1>You can get clones and grill it.</v>

174
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Of course it's three Bruceville.</v>

175
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:15.160
<v Speaker 1>It's just reproducible as a plant.</v>

176
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.650
<v Speaker 1>So what they're saying is it trying to classify it as a drug?</v>

177
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.320
<v Speaker 1>What they're almost admitting themselves.</v>

178
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.771
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

179
00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 1>if what we're thinking is true.</v>

180
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.190
<v Speaker 1>If what they're saying is that you can't,</v>

181
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.500
<v Speaker 1>it's not reproducible because it's not a chemical that you can break down into a</v>

182
00:05:29.501 --> 00:05:29.831
<v Speaker 1>pill.</v>

183
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:30.664
<v Speaker 1>If that's what they're saying,</v>

184
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.270
<v Speaker 1>like you can't standardize it because it's too wild and it's free and it's</v>

185
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:34.750
<v Speaker 1>growing.</v>

186
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.810
<v Speaker 1>That's almost a perfect example.</v>

187
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.290
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you're,</v>

188
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:39.280
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

189
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:40.151
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

190
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't be in a position where you're controlling a plant.</v>

191
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.360
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't have be in a position where you're regulating nature,</v>

192
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.320
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

193
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.790
<v Speaker 1>so you're almost admitting it yourself.</v>

194
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a repeat.</v>

195
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not reproducible.</v>

196
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

197
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.480
<v Speaker 1>If that's what you're saying,</v>

198
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.920
<v Speaker 1>then you're saying it's not a drug.</v>

199
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.611
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

200
00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:54.791
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

201
00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:56.260
<v Speaker 1>but it has a psychoactive effect.</v>

202
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

203
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Now you have to prove that psychoactive effect is dangerous.</v>

204
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.363
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

205
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing that's the real problem.</v>

206
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:09.260
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is classified in the category of the most dangerous,</v>

207
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 1>harmful drugs.</v>

208
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.040
<v Speaker 1>There's no evidence that that's should,</v>

209
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Speaker 1>that should be correct.</v>

210
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.103
<v Speaker 1>There's no evidence.</v>

211
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 1>So that's where the DEA is failing.</v>

212
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.940
<v Speaker 1>They're failing way more in that than they are.</v>

213
00:06:20.941 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 1>And even not admitting that there's medical evidence.</v>

214
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you wanted to follow it to the strictest sense of the word,</v>

215
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.090
<v Speaker 1>what studies have been done that have absolutely been proven in,</v>

216
00:06:30.091 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

217
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 1>a new modern form of like the,</v>

218
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:35.960
<v Speaker 1>the most current science.</v>

219
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.230
<v Speaker 1>What studies have been done that show the medical benefits of cannabis?</v>

220
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.411
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

221
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm not how many studies being done,</v>

222
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's because it's classified as schedule one,</v>

223
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:48.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a total catch 22 it's hard to get studies done because it's a schedule one.</v>

224
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Speaker 1>And so you can't prove,</v>

225
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:51.740
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't be a schedule one because there's not very many studies.</v>

226
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.260
<v Speaker 1>But there's a ton of studies that had been done by universities.</v>

227
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>There's a ton of studies that have shown positive benefits.</v>

228
00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 1>If you want to go back into history,</v>

229
00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:01.010
<v Speaker 1>even back into the Nixon administration,</v>

230
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.160
<v Speaker 1>they were running studies that they buried the results because the results</v>

231
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.900
<v Speaker 1>showed no harm.</v>

232
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.010
<v Speaker 1>They showed nothing.</v>

233
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.730
<v Speaker 1>They can't.</v>

234
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.860
<v Speaker 1>So when you follow just straight science,</v>

235
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.210
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

236
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 1>there's no evidence whatsoever.</v>

237
00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:14.060
<v Speaker 1>It should be illegal.</v>

238
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.560
<v Speaker 1>That's the most important thing.</v>

239
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not the evidence of whether it should be legal.</v>

240
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:18.950
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

241
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.500
<v Speaker 1>you know the whole thing about you're innocent until proven guilty.</v>

242
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.480
<v Speaker 1>It should be the same way about marijuana.</v>

243
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:29.140
<v Speaker 1>It should be that you can't just make it illegal and say it has to remain</v>

244
00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:35.351
<v Speaker 1>illegal because we don't know what it can do because you do know what we can do.</v>

245
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:35.811
<v Speaker 1>You do.</v>

246
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:36.411
<v Speaker 1>You definitely know.</v>

247
00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:38.240
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think of the millions of people like it?</v>

248
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.260
<v Speaker 1>Are they all crazy?</v>

249
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:40.423
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

250
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.100
<v Speaker 1>All these millions and millions of adults that live in America,</v>

251
00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:44.120
<v Speaker 1>are they fucking crazy?</v>

252
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:45.403
<v Speaker 1>So what are you saying?</v>

253
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.240
<v Speaker 1>You're saying you're smarter than them.</v>

254
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you talk about it with somebody that knows what the fuck they're</v>

255
00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:51.080
<v Speaker 1>talking about and you'll get buried.</v>

256
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Talk about it with a person who's like,</v>

257
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 1>talk about it with like Todd McCormick commanded Todd McCormick.</v>

258
00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Having a debate with one of these DEA guys about whether or not marijuana is</v>

259
00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:01.010
<v Speaker 1>beneficial.</v>

260
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:04.460
<v Speaker 1>He survived cancer because of it mean a lot of people have,</v>

261
00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:06.860
<v Speaker 1>we have friends that have kids that have autism.</v>

262
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.520
<v Speaker 1>They give their fucking kids this medical cannabis and all of a sudden they can</v>

263
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:11.210
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>

264
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.991
<v Speaker 1>they relaxed,</v>

265
00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.400
<v Speaker 1>they stop having seizures.</v>

266
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:17.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a massive benefit to a lot of people.</v>

267
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>It relaxes people,</v>

268
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 1>makes people feel good,</v>

269
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:25.690
<v Speaker 1>and we have a government agency in 2016 that ignores all of that and wants to</v>

270
00:08:26.751 --> 00:08:30.560
<v Speaker 1>keep it in a category of some of the most harmful and dangerous drugs these</v>

271
00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:31.121
<v Speaker 1>people have.</v>

272
00:08:31.121 --> 00:08:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Like living in an episode of Hawaii five o the limit in the past,</v>

273
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.910
<v Speaker 1>they're like 1950s people.</v>

274
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:42.080
<v Speaker 1>And what they think they can do is like keep this,</v>

275
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:47.350
<v Speaker 1>this bureaucracy in this paperwork and he's classifications in in movement and</v>

276
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:53.990
<v Speaker 1>they can head off freedom because what they're trying to do is they're trying to</v>

277
00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 1>stop freedom.</v>

278
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.050
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons why the Trump's trying to stop freedom is because they</v>

279
00:08:58.051 --> 00:08:59.070
<v Speaker 1>benefit from it.</v>

280
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.660
<v Speaker 1>They benefit from stopping it.</v>

281
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.980
<v Speaker 1>They have more agents.</v>

282
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:02.671
<v Speaker 1>If those eight,</v>

283
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:04.980
<v Speaker 1>if all of a sudden most drugs are legal,</v>

284
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.220
<v Speaker 1>what are those fucking thousands of Dea agents going to do?</v>

285
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:08.770
<v Speaker 1>They have,</v>

286
00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 1>they're protecting their own industry.</v>

287
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.810
<v Speaker 1>This is a natural thing that any organism does when it's threatened and if you</v>

288
00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:18.810
<v Speaker 1>start making drugs legal and you start opening up that,</v>

289
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.870
<v Speaker 1>that conversation like who the fuck is any one adult to tell any other adult</v>

290
00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:26.850
<v Speaker 1>what's good or bad for you?</v>

291
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 1>When a lot of shit we do,</v>

292
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:29.490
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the food we eat,</v>

293
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.241
<v Speaker 1>the alcohol,</v>

294
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:31.200
<v Speaker 1>we drank the cigarettes,</v>

295
00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:34.110
<v Speaker 1>we smoke the fucking sugar in our diet.</v>

296
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.310
<v Speaker 1>All these things are bad for us.</v>

297
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.150
<v Speaker 1>We all know that,</v>

298
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.660
<v Speaker 1>but we were afraid it was the government going to come in with a fucking machine</v>

299
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:42.300
<v Speaker 1>guns to stop you from eating a chocolate cake and smoking a cigarette.</v>

300
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.193
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

301
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

302
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:44.910
<v Speaker 1>I think we all agree on that.</v>

303
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.040
<v Speaker 1>If they can't do that,</v>

304
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.050
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't be able to stop you from smoking weed.</v>

305
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.460
<v Speaker 1>This is archaic.</v>

306
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:55.670
<v Speaker 1>This is like this is some ancient fucking vampire shit and they're clinging to</v>

307
00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:56.670
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

308
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.140
<v Speaker 1>They are totally irrelevant,</v>

309
00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.400
<v Speaker 1>totally irrelevant.</v>

310
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Your decision should be made 100% on the facts that are available today.</v>

311
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.093
<v Speaker 1>You can go,</v>

312
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.100
<v Speaker 1>you could research all the facts about matter marijuana.</v>

313
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Speaker 1>You find a few that make correlations between some sort of mental illnesses,</v>

314
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.050
<v Speaker 1>but those core,</v>

315
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.070
<v Speaker 1>most of the time,</v>

316
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.430
<v Speaker 1>at least according to experts that I've listened to talk about it,</v>

317
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:22.910
<v Speaker 1>the correlations of schizophrenia to marijuana use are directly in proportionate</v>

318
00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:24.110
<v Speaker 1>with the quote,</v>

319
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.350
<v Speaker 1>the numbers of schizophrenia for any given population that there's always going</v>

320
00:10:28.351 --> 00:10:33.090
<v Speaker 1>to be around 1% of the population that suffers from some type of schizophrenia</v>

321
00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:35.340
<v Speaker 1>or severe mental distraction,</v>

322
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:35.940
<v Speaker 1>illness.</v>

323
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.080
<v Speaker 1>You know a bunch of different categories,</v>

324
00:10:37.081 --> 00:10:39.090
<v Speaker 1>these little various mental diseases,</v>

325
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:40.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's always that number.</v>

326
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.060
<v Speaker 1>So if they smoked pot,</v>

327
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.610
<v Speaker 1>it's just a thousand people,</v>

328
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.010
<v Speaker 1>you know that smoked pot have schizophrenia.</v>

329
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:47.963
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

330
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.960
<v Speaker 1>If there was the same amount of people and they didn't smoke pot,</v>

331
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.440
<v Speaker 1>it might be the same amount of schizophrenia x,</v>

332
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.190
<v Speaker 1>they might not even be connected.</v>

333
00:10:56.191 --> 00:11:00.300
<v Speaker 1>But when you're talking about 300 million people and you say 30,000 people got</v>

334
00:11:00.301 --> 00:11:01.500
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia for marijuana,</v>

335
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.000
<v Speaker 1>are you fucking sure?</v>

336
00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Are you really fucking sure or has it just 30,000 people have schizophrenia and</v>

337
00:11:06.901 --> 00:11:10.040
<v Speaker 1>they also smoke marijuana cause this is the part,</v>

338
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.950
<v Speaker 1>this is a real problem with the way they present the data cause it's just like</v>

339
00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:18.720
<v Speaker 1>you coming up to me or to Jamie and you saying that you've got new rules.</v>

340
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.360
<v Speaker 1>You as a 42 year old grown ass man,</v>

341
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.800
<v Speaker 1>you have new rules and we,</v>

342
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.600
<v Speaker 1>you don't want us drinking alcohol anymore.</v>

343
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.261
<v Speaker 1>You're going to,</v>

344
00:11:25.261 --> 00:11:29.310
<v Speaker 1>you're going to come in and you've hired guards to keep us from smoking alcohol</v>

345
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.240
<v Speaker 1>or drinking alcohol.</v>

346
00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:32.370
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

347
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:37.260
<v Speaker 1>If it's 50,000 people with some big building with three letters in the front of</v>

348
00:11:37.261 --> 00:11:41.910
<v Speaker 1>it or whether it's one crazy fuck who wants to stop his neighbor from smoking</v>

349
00:11:41.911 --> 00:11:42.240
<v Speaker 1>pot?</v>

350
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.200
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

351
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.860
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to stop someone from doing something that's not bad.</v>

352
00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't do that.</v>

353
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 1>You don't have any evidence that it's bad.</v>

354
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 1>There should be a fuck load of evidence that it's bad and it should</v>

355
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.980
<v Speaker 2>be as much or worse than all the shit that you know is bad that you sell open</v>

356
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:01.360
<v Speaker 2>and make money from taxes,</v>

357
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.170
<v Speaker 2>alcohol,</v>

358
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:02.780
<v Speaker 2>alcohol,</v>

359
00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:03.970
<v Speaker 2>which we both love.</v>

360
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.391
<v Speaker 2>I love.</v>

361
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:06.130
<v Speaker 2>But here's a great example of getting him.</v>

362
00:12:06.131 --> 00:12:06.964
<v Speaker 2>I talk a lot.</v>

363
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.710
<v Speaker 2>They just research released a study that I think this week showing the like they</v>

364
00:12:11.711 --> 00:12:16.711
<v Speaker 2>proved scientifically that a weed is better for sex and they not only did it for</v>

365
00:12:18.491 --> 00:12:19.001
<v Speaker 2>pleasures,</v>

366
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:22.030
<v Speaker 2>but they also explained how when you have alcohol,</v>

367
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:22.991
<v Speaker 2>you a,</v>

368
00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:24.160
<v Speaker 2>you cheat more,</v>

369
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:24.721
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

370
00:12:24.721 --> 00:12:25.960
<v Speaker 2>you do bad things,</v>

371
00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:27.180
<v Speaker 2>you hook up with people he shouldn't do.</v>

372
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.330
<v Speaker 2>You don't use condoms.</v>

373
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:31.890
<v Speaker 2>Like do a lot of shit that lot of people change.</v>

374
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm on team boobs,</v>

375
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.950
<v Speaker 2>let's do this danger style.</v>

376
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.320
<v Speaker 2>But it's shit that is life changing.</v>

377
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Getting a girl pregnant that you hope met at a bar that looked hot last night.</v>

378
00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:42.580
<v Speaker 2>You wake up and it's a dog.</v>

379
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:42.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

380
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:46.420
<v Speaker 2>like all the dog you talking about a woman and woman human.</v>

381
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.920
<v Speaker 2>How dare you?</v>

382
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:48.381
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

383
00:12:48.381 --> 00:12:48.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine.</v>

384
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.530

385
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:51.383
<v Speaker 2>Actual dog.</v>

386
00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.040
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
