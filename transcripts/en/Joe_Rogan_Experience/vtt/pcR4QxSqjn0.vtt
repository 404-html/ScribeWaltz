WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.930
In Broadcasting?
Are we broadcasting?
How does this work?
I think we are,

2
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:06.420
I think we are brothers in broadcasting.
I like that.
I think,
yeah,

3
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.790
we want to talk about the brothers in Standup,
in broadcasting.

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.910
Broadcasting is like,
isn't that like a signal though?
Like it doesn't,

5
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.740
not only does that,
like,

6
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.030
like when you're sending something through the air broadcast,
I don't know.

7
00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:21.160
I mean,
don't forget that this didn't exist when that term came up.
So this,

8
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.800
they probably would have encompassed this too,
I guess,

9
00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:25.410
but broadcast for whatever reason,

10
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:29.220
to me it feels like you're sending like all wired signal,

11
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:32.640
like the old school league TV signal.
Yeah,
it did.
It did.
It did.
It did.
It,

12
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:34.350
did that come in off the radio tower?
Yeah.

13
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.090
Imagine what that must have been like when they,

14
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.810
the first TVs came about and you're sitting in your house and all this time

15
00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:42.030
you've just been listening to the radio like an asshole.

16
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.160
And then finally they have this box that you can sit in front of and you,

17
00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:50.010
you get to see an actual image and it's moving around and you know that the

18
00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:54.150
whole country's watching at the same time.
They probably reacted to that.

19
00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:57.780
The way we will react to holograms when I've actually,
like,

20
00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:00.840
say you're in a live action movie st movies,
you can be immersed in,

21
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:03.630
in holograms eventually.
That's how they,

22
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.430
the way we look at that as how they probably looked at TV,

23
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.920
cause it's just the whole family that just sit around in this shitty black and

24
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:10.980
white box and just stare at it.
Hold the elections are coming.

25
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.460
Fucking boring stuff.
But that must have been amazing.
Like magic in your house.

26
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.060
Well,
even just the radio before that was magic where they could all sit around a

27
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:22.980
broadcast like hg wells,
war of the worlds member.
When that,
uh,

28
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:27.840
that story from,
I guess it was like,
what year was that?

29
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.430
35 it was in the thirties I guess was killing themselves.
Yeah,
I don't know.

30
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.390
I think Snopes attack that and so there's no evidence and they killed
themselves.

31
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.360
Oh,
I didn't know there was like one of those urban myth things.

32
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.520
I that Shit I had that I'm disappointed that documented.
I asked you what?
Oh.

33
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.900
Oh nurse.
So sad about that.

34
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.680
It sounds like one of those things that it's be pretty hard to prove.

35
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.790
Want to go back to 1930 and find out who killed themselves over an Orson Welles

36
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:55.010
radio broadcast.
Yeah.

37
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.970
People are going to be reluctant to talk about that slow uncle.
Yeah,

38
00:01:58.971 --> 00:02:01.860
Lou his fucking brains out because he believed the actor man was telling the

39
00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:04.980
truth.
Yeah.
He was probably depressed anyway like cause he's obviously a dopey,

40
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.870
probably lost a lot of money in the market crash.

41
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.630
Was it over by 35 I guess it was.
When was the market crash was 35 I know always,

42
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.640
I think I want to say early twenties was it 29 maybe 35 was what was prohibition

43
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:19.860
33 well that note,
let's go ahead and go.

44
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:22.920
Well in the 20s to don't forget cause Bullock empires in the 20s I think.

45
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:26.340
And that's all through prohibition,
right?
I don't know when it ended.
I feel like,

46
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:28.140
I want to say it ended in 33,

47
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.580
and then marijuana became criminalized and 35 was illegal before that,

48
00:02:32.581 --> 00:02:36.210
or just not know it was illegal before then,
but they didn't call it marijuana.

49
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:38.880
It was only do zoning called marijuana.

50
00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:43.050
After William Randolph Hearst started printing these articles about blacks and

51
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:47.540
Mexicans taking this new drug and raping white women and uh,

52
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.000
they called it marijuana.
Oh Wow.
But that was a name for a,

53
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:54.300
like a wild Mexican tobacco.
That's what marijuana was.

54
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.660
They used to call it cannabis.
I mean,
that's what it was.

55
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.280
It was hemp cannabis and they would,
uh,

56
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:03.610
they would smoke cannabis and they would smoke hash and all that stuff was the

57
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:08.140
same plant,
but it was really what they were after was hemp as a commodity.

58
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.780
They were trying to make hemp a commodity,

59
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:15.730
very difficult to take over for,
uh,
for paper and for cotton.

60
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:16.300
They'd,

61
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.360
they'd made some new invention called a decorticator and it was going to be able

62
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:22.970
to really easily process hemp fibers.
That's where all this came from.
Okay.

63
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.290
Supposedly,
and again,
it's,
it's catchy stuff.

64
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.220
It's hard to call this like guy and Eagle Song.

65
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.750
That's the only time I've ever heard that and I heard it was pot warm smell of

66
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.270
has.
Is that what they call them?
Never heard of that.

67
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:38.420
That's what I heard a and now eagles documentary I want is that Khaleed tested a

68
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.040
rising up through the way.
Always wondered what that name was.
They were saying,

69
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.910
I think it's a name for pot,
warm smell of colitis.
He said the whole thing,

70
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:47.980
the whole song is about show business or la or whatever,

71
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:51.850
but I just made me think that makes sense.
That makes sense,
but,

72
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.960
but my point being,
there's no point.
It was a long ass time ago.
People were,

73
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.230
they had so much,
little,
so much,
much,

74
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.470
much less information coming at them every day that just getting that signal

75
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:06.580
from the radio must must've been a big fucking deal.
Like whoa.
Yeah,
yeah.

76
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:07.900
Grabbing around with a ball game.

77
00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:10.630
They'd all just sit around and look at it and actually just looking at a fucking

78
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:14.740
radio and hanging on the,
or the soap operas,
the radio,
a soap operas.

79
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:18.070
They would do the weekly ones.
Fuck man.

80
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.790
All those guys that did the fully work with the paper is a flyer,
crinkle,

81
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:23.230
crinkle,
crinkle.
They had,

82
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.320
they had comedies and dramas and some of those are really fucking cool to listen

83
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:31.060
to today to you're driving,

84
00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:35.410
like if you've got a Gig you're going to listen to when I'm old timey suspense

85
00:04:35.411 --> 00:04:39.640
radio programs.
Dot.
Yeah.
It's like a time machine.

86
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.720
Have you heard Tom Papa's,
it's called come to pop up in a week.
We do that.

87
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:46.210
He doesn't live at the village Undergrad.
I think he doesn't here in La.

88
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.090
We don't give us all this script to look white in front of a live audience and

89
00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:52.150
they're awesome.
And uh,
he's always got like a weird theme,

90
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:53.590
like a Christmas theme or Thanksgiving.

91
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:57.220
And then you wind up reading it and it's getting real audience laughs and it's

92
00:04:57.221 --> 00:05:01.020
so great to act and not have to be off book.
Just hold your fucking script there.

93
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.040
It's like doing a play with a script in your hand.
Wow.

94
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:04.750
And so he does it live in front of an audience?

95
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.450
He writes all the scripts he does.
Yeah.
But he's,
he's cool.

96
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:10.810
Like we'll go through one rehearsal like that night and then you just,
you,

97
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:11.081
you know,

98
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:14.560
I always change stuff to make it sound like me and he doesn't care and they're

99
00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:16.810
really fun to do.
He's got Matt Damon to Dome Wow.

100
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.110
Really famous friends cause he hasn't bothered them for photos.

101
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.020
Actually actually see him as an equal.
He's a sweetheart,
that guy.

102
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.711
He's a good dude.

103
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:26.710
I really only hung out with them for the first time when he did my podcast.

104
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.220
I had like met him before,
like I said Hi.
I think maybe at the most,

105
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.550
but I'd never really talked to him before he came in to do the podcast.

106
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:36.970
He's a great guy.
He's funny too and he's a weird guy.

107
00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:41.840
Like Tom is one of those guys,
like he's clean,
but he fucking murderers on stay.

108
00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:43.750
Like,
you know,
a lot of times you watch a clean guy up there and you're like,

109
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:47.170
oh you stink.
Papa's was so good bed.

110
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.230
He's a guy that you watched in the cellar like east,
totally clean.

111
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.200
He can perform in front of any audience and you can't even hate and be like,

112
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:56.620
he's just a funny guy.
Well some people,
that's just what they think of,
you know,

113
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.010
there's nothing with it.
I

114
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.300
<v 1>think we all,
especially you and I coming up,
we've got kinda got,
there was,</v>

115
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.020
we were in a time we,
we pretty much started around the same time.
Right?

116
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:07.800
Like you started in the late nineties.
Yeah,

117
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.090
I started in 88 so by the time I'd come to New York it was like 90 91 and you

118
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:14.390
were just getting started.

119
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:17.390
So we were both kind of getting started around the same time.
And there was like,

120
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.510
there was clean camps back then and dirty camps.
Yep.

121
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.430
And we were looked at as like the,
the dummies,
like,
oh,
these guys are dirty.

122
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.080
As he finally got out of there,
just dirty.

123
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.180
And they would look at what you're doing is like,

124
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:32.570
it would have less merit because even though he's killing,
yeah,
he's killing.

125
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:33.111
But he's just,

126
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:37.310
he's talking about getting his Dick Sucked by ag dries weird stuff,
you know?

127
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:39.960
And people would have this like dismissal of it.
Yeah.

128
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.340
That doesn't really exist anymore.
No,
I don't see it as much.

129
00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:46.130
I don't hear many again because I'm not in the open mic thing anymore,

130
00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:46.701
but I don't,

131
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:49.850
I remember that clean and dirty and I've always thought that they thought there

132
00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:53.120
was so much more valid and cleanliness.
Yeah.
And there's not,
well,

133
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:55.340
it's censorship.
That's all it is.

134
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.880
Like you tell me you don't have those thoughts or you just don't want to explore

135
00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:00.650
those thoughts on stage.
That's okay.

136
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.690
You don't have to explore those thoughts on stage.

137
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.970
But to pretend that somehow or another,

138
00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:07.790
there's something wrong with somebody else exploring those thoughts on stage.

139
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:09.080
Whatever the fuck they are,

140
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.750
that they can't be handled in a clever and hilarious way.
Right.

141
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.360
Everything can be,
well,
they were looking at it like,

142
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.390
like there's a difference between just be cause you can be hacky and clean too.

143
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.690
Like hackey dirty guys suck just as much as hacking lean guys do.

144
00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:21.980
I mean it's just,
you know,
guys doing that.

145
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.870
I don't find any of that to be shocking.

146
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:25.850
But you always know when a guy's up there trying to be shocking,

147
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:31.450
but sometimes someone just has an idea of what it's going to be like.

148
00:07:32.031 --> 00:07:34.730
If you hear,
oh,
it's dirty,
comma like God,
it's fucking stupid.

149
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.020
But then you'll see someone who is dirty and like really clever and you'll go,

150
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:41.840
wow,
I didn't even think of that option.
Right.

151
00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:45.450
Stan hope or lotto when he was alive was perfect example.

152
00:07:45.451 --> 00:07:48.920
There's some really filthy funny guy and have we truly funny guy that all of

153
00:07:48.921 --> 00:07:49.670
these people,

154
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.940
whether it was bill Hicks who could be dirty when he only Carsten least were

155
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:55.130
prior or Kinison or Cleveland or Lenny Bruce,

156
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.710
they were all filthy and yet all these guys are like,
well,
dirty comedy.

157
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.590
Like you mentioned them.
Instead of just going,
Oh yeah,

158
00:08:00.591 --> 00:08:03.180
I'm going to ask that I'm wrong.
And they go,
well you're not him.
Yes,

159
00:08:03.181 --> 00:08:04.480
that's exactly what they say.

160
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.530
They have to say that cause they can't admit they're wrong.

161
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:10.040
I said that to a guy and an open Mike night when I was an open mic or this guy

162
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:12.290
was telling me,
you can't swear.
He was telling me,
you know,

163
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:14.780
you got to stop swearing because you're never going to do TV and we're going to

164
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:18.650
do kick TV gigs.
If you swear you're not going to get the the tonight show,

165
00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:21.350
you're not gonna,
you're not going to get Letterman.
You're going to be stuck.

166
00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:22.280
You're going to be pigeonholed.

167
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.490
Like you're just going to be one of those guys as bitter doing the road
swearing.

168
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.560
And I was like,
well what about Kinison?
And he's like,

169
00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:31.040
well you're not Sam Kennison.
I go,
well,
well how did he become Sam?
Kinison right.

170
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:32.720
What about dice clay?
You're not dice clay.

171
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.720
Well this is stupid cause those are the guys I think are really funny.
Right.

172
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:39.590
What about prior w what would,
if he had listened to you and went totally clean,

173
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.310
this is ridiculous.
Like what do you like,
what do you like?
Well,

174
00:08:43.311 --> 00:08:48.260
cause I like Kennison and Pryor and Hicks and Carlin,

175
00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:49.730
like those are what I think is funny.

176
00:08:49.731 --> 00:08:53.560
And you're telling me that I can't be like them.
I can't do that style.
Right?

177
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.920
Like that's ridiculous.
That's what I think of his comedy.

178
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.250
<v 0>Like you and I might have a different idea of what you think of his comedy for</v>

179
00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:03.030
you.
It might be Henny young men,
it might be,
you know,
whatever.
Fill in the blank.

180
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.270
Fibber McGee and Molly too,
you know,
whatever.
Could,

181
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:10.230
you know everybody's got their own style that they're into but the people would

182
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:13.140
be like real adamant in the clean versus dirty camp.

183
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.370
I don't think that exists anymore.

184
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:17.220
And I think the Internet is sort of like dissolve those boundaries.

185
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.940
Last TV has gotten harsher too.
It's like,
you know,
you didn't have,

186
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:25.470
even in 1990 he had cable but you didn't have channels like FX or all of these

187
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.990
daily HPL was really doing original programming where you were actually just

188
00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:30.480
watching comedy shows.
I said fucking them all the time.

189
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.220
So it was easier for them to do that.

190
00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:35.020
But now you just looked like a day to Douche.
You feel like I don't,

191
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.070
sometimes I'll work material out,
I'll take language out of it cause like,

192
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.720
oh yeah I want to try to do this on TV.

193
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.440
So I gotta make sure my Tinder bit is funny,
clean.

194
00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:44.580
Cause if I ever want to do it on TV,

195
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:46.950
I don't want the punchline to be cut lips and then go,
oh no,

196
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.030
how do I take that out?
Maybe I can go like,
um,
can I,

197
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.990
can I make a trolley callous noise and make it?

198
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.190
That's what you get fucked up when you have to start editing and couponing it
up.

199
00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.510
But I've always hated euphemisms anyway.
Like I hate guys.
There was one,

200
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.630
it was one guy was talking about like a dick or a pussy and he would go her ra

201
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:07.560
and he would whistle.
Can you whistle?
Yeah,
like and it down.

202
00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:08.970
Like that was what he referred to.

203
00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.570
It's like either say it or don't but don't whistle.
That's fucking,

204
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.820
that's not cute.
That's not stomach turning is bizarre.
It's bizarre.

205
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.010
Imagine you're talking to a man.

206
00:10:17.011 --> 00:10:21.750
It was just you and him and he couldn't say pussy and he was like her.
Yeah.

207
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.530
Unless he was talking about a girl that,
I might like it,

208
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.320
but I could see the confusion statistic.
It's just really powerful posted.

209
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.440
You could actually whistle out of it.
She said just insane pussy muscles.

210
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:32.550
Just can suck,
Erin.

211
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.980
It's probably possible if girls can shoot ping pong balls and stuff like stand

212
00:10:37.981 --> 00:10:41.970
up as a joke or that bit rather about when he was in Thailand and he went to

213
00:10:41.971 --> 00:10:44.700
some crazy lady who shoots bananas out of her pussy,

214
00:10:44.701 --> 00:10:47.220
Julia would put the banana and then chop it up,

215
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:52.350
spitting it out one piece at a time.
Wow.
How about them apples?
Huh?

216
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:56.220
How about that clamp down?
It's pretty impressive.
I might not be totally true.

217
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.360
I mean who knows?
You know they have a,

218
00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:02.040
you know Sandra $20 to bet they might've played a scam on them too.

219
00:11:02.041 --> 00:11:04.620
They might have sliced it up in advance.
Either way.

220
00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:07.600
Anybody shooting anything under their vaginas?
Pretty God damn impressive.
Yeah.

221
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.640
I think the way I've done it should fall out of a vagina as basically should

222
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.600
stand up or it should just fall out on the floor.

223
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.780
That's the way it puts you should work.
So if you're doing anything above that,

224
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.220
you're impressive with your pussy.

225
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.710
I was reading this article that this woman wrote,

226
00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:22.020
and I really wish I remember who she was,

227
00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:27.260
but she was arguing that size doesn't matter cause if a chick isn't lazy she can

228
00:11:27.331 --> 00:11:30.780
work on our pussy muscles to the point where she could enjoy any deck.

229
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.840
I don't know if that's true or not,
but she was kind of like,

230
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:35.550
I'll tell you what she was doing.

231
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.960
She was a loose vagina shaming she was doing,

232
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.040
she was shaming.

233
00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:46.041
All these girls were not having the effort to also while sending a signal out

234
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.310
telling guys she's got a tight pussy or she was also telling that guy she's been

235
00:11:50.311 --> 00:11:53.890
dating who's cock is small and she knows it's small.

236
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.540
She was trying to make him feel better.

237
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.850
So she's built her whole philosophy around,

238
00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:59.920
I'm not an idiot dating a guy with a little dick.

239
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:04.990
I'm not lazy so I can enjoy him to process easier to suck.

240
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.950
And he's probably really good at eating pussy.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

241
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:09.791
Someone just called me.

242
00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:13.540
Some girl just told me a story yesterday we had dinner about a guy with a tiny,

243
00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:16.660
like a micro cock and she opened her fingers about three inches while I'm like,

244
00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:20.210
was it that long?
She goes,
yeah,
and uh,
I'm like,
how was it?
And she said,
oh,

245
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.990
it was fucking awful.
I couldn't feel it.
And I love the honesty.

246
00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:24.700
I hate when women go like,
oh,
it didn't matter.
Yeah,

247
00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:27.430
of course it matters because it matters.
It matters.
Yeah.

248
00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:29.650
This woman was talking about that too,
that we,

249
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:34.000
here's where size matters is that women want to feel stuffed,
stretched out.

250
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.330
She's like,
but you can achieve that feeling by tightening your pussy muscles.

251
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:39.620
But I think you might have a point there,
maybe motives.

252
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.670
Maybe it's a combination of all those things.
Maybe there is no right answer.

253
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:46.120
Maybe you know her pussy is okay and her boyfriend's Dick is okay.

254
00:12:46.121 --> 00:12:49.210
It's just a combination of all of these things that closer to write the article

255
00:12:49.211 --> 00:12:52.390
and maybe she really is loose vagina shaming.
That's a possibility too.

256
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:57.260
She might let all these bitches know my policies down.
Squeeze,

257
00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.160
squeeze the box.
I don't like a pussy that's too snug.

258
00:13:00.161 --> 00:13:04.330
I like a bit of a sloppy and not lose a bit of a,
you know,

259
00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:09.280
like a bit of a fucking horror show
that makes you happy.

260
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.120
Will you look extra lip it some extra meat philosophy.
Crazy.

261
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.560
I'm trying not to,
you know,
it's funny man.
I,

262
00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:19.450
I talked so much about my sexual shit.
I'm trying now to be a good boy again.

263
00:13:19.451 --> 00:13:24.230
Like I'm only four days in to like,
no,
I'm trying not to do porn.

264
00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.260
I'm trying not to dirty,
intrigued tax.
It's very cause I'm like,
I'm,
I'm,

265
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.700
I'm blocking so much shit by doing that.

266
00:13:30.701 --> 00:13:34.600
It's almost like I feel connected to nobody.
I'm always disconnected.

267
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.720
I don't ever feel like I'm,
I'm with another person for real.

268
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:40.330
I always feel like I'm just looking at them through a window.

269
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.420
So I kind of want to connect and I know I'm blocking myself.

270
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:45.490
I know that by living this way,
this,

271
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:50.640
this constant fucking obsession in this constant thing for money is blocking me

272
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:55.300
from Billy living with people.
That's fascinating.

273
00:13:55.301 --> 00:14:00.301
So the constant looking for prostitutes and the prostitute relationship blocks

274
00:14:00.731 --> 00:14:04.530
you from having honest relationships with people?
Yeah,
cause I came into,

275
00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.510
this is the first time I've ever traveled without a computer.

276
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:08.530
Like I have two computers now.

277
00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:12.310
I've got a newer Mac laptop and I said this will be my good boy computer.

278
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.600
I have literally have nothing in there that I have.
I'm,

279
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:19.180
I'm ashamed of you could open my work computer and there's not one dirty fucking

280
00:14:19.181 --> 00:14:23.230
photo on it.
There's nothing that's beautiful.
It's just work.
You're a good boy.

281
00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.760
I'm trying.
And the other one well you know fucking horror show.
Yeah,
exactly.

282
00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:30.130
It's like the West shore expressway.
It was.
So when you,

283
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:35.050
what you do is put like tape around it and if you break the seal then you know

284
00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.650
you're,
you know,
you fucked up.
You got to seal it up.

285
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.460
You got to see a lit up like a vault and have it be like a symbol of your

286
00:14:42.461 --> 00:14:44.770
sobriety.
Well I got too much stuff on it that I need.

287
00:14:44.771 --> 00:14:47.650
Like there's too many like real photos on it.
I got to clear it off eventually.

288
00:14:47.651 --> 00:14:50.580
But if you start looking,
you start terpene good.
That's the problem.

289
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.640
And I can't delete all my shit.

290
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:57.760
So I actually have an external hard drive that is a coded like,
you know,
it's a,

291
00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:01.250
it's a pass code and I have in a bank vault because I'm not ready to throw it

292
00:15:01.251 --> 00:15:05.360
all out yet,
but eventually I will.
Hilarious.
Actually bank the bank have,
yeah,

293
00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.910
the bank volume.
You got your papers in there and stuff.

294
00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.730
That's my phone has got a few dirty things on it,

295
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:15.500
but I'm going to get rid of them and uh,
I want to know what's going to happen.

296
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.690
I haven't been like that my whole life.
I like the constant,

297
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.520
it's almost like there's times where I feel like just put it down just it's,

298
00:15:21.521 --> 00:15:23.810
it's like,
uh,
you feel like you're buzzing.

299
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.360
It's like a doodle that get off the plane from La.

300
00:15:26.361 --> 00:15:29.870
And the first thing I'm doing is texting dirty and I'm trying to go to the hotel

301
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.070
and fucking look for all this shit and Lakota eeros and go to this one and set

302
00:15:34.071 --> 00:15:37.640
something up.
So I have no connection with my manager or my friends out here.

303
00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:40.280
There's no real communication cause all I'm thinking about is what I'm going to

304
00:15:40.281 --> 00:15:43.520
do after I got to end this fast so I can go there and it's like,
it's like,

305
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:46.250
it's like a fucking drug and it's like now I just want to stop.

306
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.800
I'll tell you why.
I did a scene recently.

307
00:15:48.801 --> 00:15:52.460
I had a scene in a show called the nick.
It was a scene with Clive Owen.

308
00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:56.830
It was very brief scene and I think I did okay in it.
Um,

309
00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:00.620
you know,
but it was,
it was only like five lines.
I was ready,
I was prepared,

310
00:16:00.621 --> 00:16:04.280
I knew my lines,
I showed up on time and I felt good about it,

311
00:16:04.281 --> 00:16:08.540
but I didn't feel great and I didn't feel 100% connected during the scene.

312
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:12.800
And I'm like,
I'm not,
what am I so disconnected from?

313
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:16.340
I'm not fucking scared to act with this guy.
Like I could set I,
you know,

314
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.250
I can stand in front of people and fucking do what I do.

315
00:16:19.251 --> 00:16:22.730
There's no reason I can't do a few lines with this person.
And feel connected.

316
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:25.310
It wasn't like that kind of an intimidation.
It was just like,

317
00:16:25.311 --> 00:16:30.020
I realize like even in my most comfortable,
when I'm prepared,
I'm disconnected.

318
00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.630
Got It.
Doug Davidoff told me that years ago,
he goes,

319
00:16:32.631 --> 00:16:35.570
you'd be a really good actor.
He goes,
but whatever's blocking you,
he goes,

320
00:16:35.571 --> 00:16:37.520
you got something that you do well you got to do is get rid of its block.

321
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.890
And I've thought about that for years.
You know what I mean?

322
00:16:39.891 --> 00:16:42.470
Every time I see stupid dove,
I want to tell him like,
I still think about that,

323
00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.100
but,
and I know that.
But you know what I mean?
It's like I see him all the time,

324
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.120
but it's like that fucking death thing blocking it where you feel like I'm just

325
00:16:50.121 --> 00:16:53.570
not,
there's nothing I'm going to do that makes me feel like I'm a part of this

326
00:16:53.571 --> 00:16:57.950
group.
Well,
you should probably add something to your life.
Yeah.

327
00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.550
What you should do is probably add like a new thing to be obsessed with.

328
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:06.750
You know,
like take up a hobby.
Started doing something that,
uh,

329
00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:11.060
like not something like,
look that doesn't sort of have a real end goal,

330
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.230
but something that you enjoy participating in like some sort of a just to do it.

331
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.401
Like,
you know,

332
00:17:16.401 --> 00:17:20.600
for some people it's working out but working out it seems like kind of like if

333
00:17:20.601 --> 00:17:23.330
you do it for that reason,
just like this is my new addiction,

334
00:17:23.331 --> 00:17:24.910
where now it seems like you're,

335
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.780
unless you like really wholeheartedly dive into it,

336
00:17:29.781 --> 00:17:32.490
it seems like you're going to get bored with just like lifting weights and

337
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.090
wanting it,
the gym,
unless that's your thing,
you know,

338
00:17:35.091 --> 00:17:39.260
I think that's Kinda gotta be done for the,
the benefits of the exercise.

339
00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.000
If you're really going to get psycho about that,

340
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:46.240
but maybe a sport or a hobby or something or I mean something like a game or

341
00:17:47.961 --> 00:17:50.140
even a martial art or something,
something where you're,

342
00:17:50.141 --> 00:17:53.700
you're practicing something that you enjoy.
I want to read more,
you know,

343
00:17:53.701 --> 00:17:54.390
like Bill Burr,

344
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:58.170
we had built bar in recently and he's flying helicopters now and I'm like,

345
00:17:58.171 --> 00:18:01.920
this is what your friends are doing.
Like as a healthy guy,

346
00:18:01.921 --> 00:18:05.730
bill got married and you bill is never a hunk of shit sexually that I know of

347
00:18:05.731 --> 00:18:08.160
but you know,
here's a guy who,
but you know what I mean.

348
00:18:08.161 --> 00:18:10.620
He was always like a pretty straight and narrow guy and he,

349
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.140
he marries a nice girl and he has a,
and I'm like,

350
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.860
why do you have no thing in your life like that?

351
00:18:16.861 --> 00:18:20.580
Like just a normal thing like hey guy wants to fly out.
I got nothing but time.

352
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:21.690
Right.
I got fucking,

353
00:18:21.691 --> 00:18:24.900
I'm done with the radio at 10 in the morning and I want to read more.

354
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.300
Like I literally can't read anymore.
I get so fucking,

355
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:31.410
I'm so wired up and I literally have my phone right here.
It's constant.

356
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.400
So I started reading a little bit more like I'm trying just to shut my brain

357
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:37.620
down.
Once you go to a flip phone,
that's,
what are you doing?

358
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.380
I saw already there by Kade.
There's too many violently.

359
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.660
There's too many legit things I do with it.
Like I said,

360
00:18:42.661 --> 00:18:46.920
a lot of real texts and I do like Twitter and I do like being able to check my

361
00:18:46.921 --> 00:18:50.580
email and play chess and all these things that are not deviant or piggish.

362
00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.340
A flip phone would annoy me more than it would help me.

363
00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:56.430
I think you need a genius APP.
What's that Jesus App.

364
00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.200
You need something that overwhelms your phone only.

365
00:18:58.201 --> 00:19:02.150
Let's use the apps that are wholesome and in order to,

366
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.980
to use that Jesus App,
you'd probably have to like to unblock it.

367
00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.940
Probably have to put all your fingerprints in or something.

368
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:12.130
It's upgraded a little bit or he's upgraded his phone,
Samsung alias to bullshit.

369
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:16.050
That's still an old fucking iPhone.
Want to be piece of shit,
flip phone.

370
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:20.340
But he texted me asking me if he could get a pocket camera and I said,
yeah,

371
00:19:20.341 --> 00:19:22.410
get an iPhone and he's got this.
He's like,
no,

372
00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:26.550
I've got this new Samsung alias deal.
Almost the Shitty iPhone.

373
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.090
He's going back.
He will go back to hard not to.
In this day and age,

374
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.150
you just got to manage it.
You can't ignore the new technology.

375
00:19:33.151 --> 00:19:35.740
It's like ignoring your car because you drive too much.
You just got it.

376
00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:39.780
You got to just balance it.
So does this new shitty phone have apps?

377
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:45.000
Show me this new shitty phone.
This is it.
So he got something with a keypad.

378
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.480
Let me say like what Apps,
what are we talking about?

379
00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:56.190
This is a flip phone.
How does it,
oh wow.

380
00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:01.010
Oh,
how weird is it?
Touch screen or all Arrow on the,
oh,

381
00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:05.000
so it goes up and back.
It goes both ways.
How weird.
Yeah.

382
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.520
I remember this piece of shit.
This came out like many.

383
00:20:08.521 --> 00:20:12.960
I might have had one of these fucking things I might have ordered that was still

384
00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:17.280
in the stylists era.
What's wrong with him?
With a stylist on the note,

385
00:20:17.281 --> 00:20:20.700
four of you are trying to add the Samsung note four.
Oh my God.

386
00:20:20.701 --> 00:20:22.620
The galaxy note four.
It's fucking amazing.

387
00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:27.060
As it gets better than the iPhone six no,
no.
The iPhone six is a better phone.

388
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.930
It's just better construction.
The apps work better,
the camera's better.

389
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:35.220
But the stylists on the note four is pretty slick.

390
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:39.060
Like you could circle things and it has options.
You could like,

391
00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:42.450
you could copy pictures,
send them to your folder,

392
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.530
you could save them like with,
with the stylists,
like say if you're online,

393
00:20:46.531 --> 00:20:48.010
you're looking at something,
you could just

394
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.090
<v 1>scroll it with the stylist and the stylist will take that photo.
Oh,
okay.</v>

395
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:56.140
And then you could also like write notes on pictures and send them to people.

396
00:20:56.141 --> 00:20:57.310
Like,
this is you stupid.

397
00:20:57.311 --> 00:21:00.910
You could draw a Dick and calm coming out of it and put it on someone's picture

398
00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:02.980
and just send it to him.
And in seconds you could write,

399
00:21:02.981 --> 00:21:07.240
like I used to write all my standup notes by hand,
like a,

400
00:21:07.241 --> 00:21:11.080
and they even save to Evernote by hand.
It's kind of slick.

401
00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:16.210
So like when I go into my notes,
I'd have certain notes in here that are,

402
00:21:16.211 --> 00:21:20.650
uh,
they're all done from,
from the,
uh,
galaxy note four.

403
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:25.330
So they're all done by hand.
Oh,
okay.
You know,
so it's like my handwriting.

404
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.950
It's not just,
but it's my handwriting on a little,
you know,

405
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.590
computer don't you like,
like I have a no thing too.
I talked my notes into it,

406
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.880
I talked my notes.

407
00:21:33.881 --> 00:21:37.120
I like just talking a joke idea and half the time he misspells it,

408
00:21:37.121 --> 00:21:41.320
but it's so much easier and I find like I do so many more ideas that way.

409
00:21:41.321 --> 00:21:43.600
I'm prepared so much more for interviews.
You know what,

410
00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:46.480
I'm just reading a book and spitting notes and then I just emailed them to

411
00:21:46.481 --> 00:21:49.590
myself and print them.
Yeah,
I know what you mean.
And the,
the,

412
00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:53.980
the software now is so good at picking up your words.
It's incredible.

413
00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.450
What have I signed?
Something Jim,
my dumb phone right to Jen Norton let,

414
00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.490
sometimes you have followers.
It's a con.
It's like how stupid are you?

415
00:22:00.491 --> 00:22:03.580
How many times have I said this?
You don't know that Jim is Jim.

416
00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:09.040
I have Alexis that has a navigation feature that you're supposed to,
you know,

417
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:14.200
take me to one 18 Hollywood boulevard.
It's fucking never right.

418
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.590
No,
I mean never.
I mean,
it's so bad.
I mean,

419
00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:22.620
I try to talk very clearly so that it understands me and it never gets it right.

420
00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.520
I have to do it three,
four times and usually I wind up pulling over.

421
00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:30.850
It's one of those ones that won't let you enter it in because it thinks you're a

422
00:22:30.851 --> 00:22:34.450
fucking baby.
He can't do it while you're driving.
So you have to pull over,

423
00:22:34.451 --> 00:22:35.320
stop your car,

424
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:38.620
and then you can enter in an address or you could use the voice feature.

425
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:43.570
The fois feature sucks at thousand decks.
It's really bad.
Yeah,

426
00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:45.580
that's the word.
And it brings out such a rage,

427
00:22:45.581 --> 00:22:49.360
like how do you not have this figured out?
But the voice feature on your phone,

428
00:22:49.361 --> 00:22:54.010
which is Bluetooth into your car anyway,
is amazing.

429
00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.870
The Siri like Siri,

430
00:22:55.871 --> 00:23:00.670
take me to Mann's Chinese theater on Hollywood boulevard,
Mann's Chinese theater.

431
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:04.270
Would you like directions?
Yes.
Boom.
You're on your way.
I mean,

432
00:23:04.271 --> 00:23:07.240
it's really that good.
I'll tell you what's frustrating about Siri though,

433
00:23:07.241 --> 00:23:10.360
is when you're a talking into it,
you need a wifi connection or whatever,

434
00:23:10.361 --> 00:23:14.660
or a good connection when you do a whole thing,
you know?
And I feel like God,

435
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.660
you know,
I just don't know what I wanted to do with my life and all that.

436
00:23:16.661 --> 00:23:19.840
I fly around a whole fucking chapter and I look in that fucking Cock sucker

437
00:23:19.841 --> 00:23:22.510
circle is still spinning and I realized nothing has been said.

438
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.880
Like it's just waiting to find somewhere to grab the information from.

439
00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.250
So this time of you got to just talk,
I finally be like,
you can say comma,

440
00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:31.120
let her ride.

441
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.840
You can go come up period while we just have to keep stopping it and doing it.

442
00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.610
Point.
Yeah.
Well it's really good for that note pad feature.
The,

443
00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:44.080
what was it called?
The one that's native to the iPhone.
Um,
I was just just,
no,

444
00:23:44.081 --> 00:23:46.120
it's,
I have another one.
Nodes.
Well,

445
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.700
<v 0>do you know what,
there's,
there's,
there's benefits to both platforms.</v>

446
00:23:49.701 --> 00:23:53.660
I think android and iPhone and I liked both of them.

447
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:57.890
But what I like about android is that it's open and that like pretty much

448
00:23:57.891 --> 00:24:02.000
anybody can create apps for them.
And there's just so much more variety.
So many,

449
00:24:02.001 --> 00:24:03.800
and there's a lot of Goddamn people use it.

450
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.400
And what you don't like about iPhone is that it's like difficult to get your app

451
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:08.480
approved for the APP store.

452
00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:11.570
But that's also why so many of these things work so well.

453
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.310
You know like I think in some way it stifles innovation in a small way.

454
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.250
Everyone like you're tethered to the apple maybe,

455
00:24:19.251 --> 00:24:24.251
but they have such a pursuit of excellence cause I can totally see it from their

456
00:24:24.591 --> 00:24:29.450
point of view and ultimately the end product is better.
But I used to phones,

457
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.650
I use this phone for like my home stuff,
my personal stuff.

458
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:38.150
And then I use a Samsung galaxy s five which is a,

459
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:41.120
it's waterproof.
I like it a lot.
Man.
I have one of those.

460
00:24:41.121 --> 00:24:44.510
I have never fell in love with it.
I like it a lot.
It's um,

461
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.740
there's a lot of good features to it.

462
00:24:45.741 --> 00:24:49.010
I think the size is about the right size cause this is like five and a half

463
00:24:49.011 --> 00:24:52.100
inches.
The other one's five inch,
I think five inches of the right size.
Yeah,

464
00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:53.660
they have a new,
another newer version of that.

465
00:24:53.661 --> 00:24:57.470
That's probably the same as the iPhone six plus.
Yeah,
the six,
the galaxy s six.

466
00:24:57.471 --> 00:25:00.260
It's just coming out I think like in a week or so.
All I know they gave him,

467
00:25:00.261 --> 00:25:03.110
they gave us a bunch of weight.
They've given us phones,
the galaxy,

468
00:25:03.111 --> 00:25:05.270
and they're not bad phones,
but for me,
I'm just,
this is,

469
00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.550
I think there's only one you can just go,
that's my phone.
Like you and me.

470
00:25:08.551 --> 00:25:12.140
I tried both platforms and say,
ah,
fuck it.
While if we had an a,

471
00:25:12.141 --> 00:25:14.830
if he had an android and that was the only option when they first came out,

472
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.680
like when the iPhone came out,
you'd be like,
oh my God,
this is fucking amazing.

473
00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.550
We're just so used to how good the i-phones are now that it makes it difficult

474
00:25:22.551 --> 00:25:25.010
for almost everybody else,
but even the old light phones look shitty.

475
00:25:25.011 --> 00:25:27.260
I see somebody got a small iPhone.
I'm like,
where are you from?

476
00:25:27.261 --> 00:25:31.560
1930 given new fucking phone.
Especially the one you see that,

477
00:25:31.561 --> 00:25:32.900
that hunk of Shit.
You're like,

478
00:25:32.901 --> 00:25:37.901
look at this stupid aluminum looking back I no flash and the camera dog shit.

479
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:40.420
Yeah.
Steve Jobs really bugged me.
That was on purpose.

480
00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:45.350
No flash fucking ass.
But they made a dope phone.

481
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.640
I mean they changed the whole game.
That was only like 2007 it's hard to believe.

482
00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:53.180
I know that pre 2007 we all existed without smartphones.

483
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:55.600
You think of stuff that you ever watch it,

484
00:25:55.601 --> 00:25:59.030
I'll watch a movie from the 80s and I started thinking they have no right.

485
00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:04.090
I'd be like died in 1989 or that person never made a cell phone call like they

486
00:26:04.221 --> 00:26:09.221
missed so much by dying and in 89 or 1990 or you watch a movie and it just seems

487
00:26:10.371 --> 00:26:13.790
so primitive.
Like how did everybody stay in touch without a fall?

488
00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.830
You know wherever you are you think is,
oh my God,

489
00:26:15.831 --> 00:26:18.050
it can never get fucking more advanced than this.

490
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:20.660
And then five years from now you're like,
what a Douche.
I was.
I was.

491
00:26:20.661 --> 00:26:23.060
I was out in the wilderness by myself.
Yeah.

492
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.930
Do you remember calling people on the phone and pink psych from their home?
Yeah.

493
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:31.250
When they weren't home.
He just kept calling.
Yeah.
Ring,
ring,
ring or machine.

494
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.280
What do you have?
Party lines can at a party line.
Did you ever have one of those?

495
00:26:34.281 --> 00:26:37.980
No.
What's that?
It's in New Jersey when I lived there,
I was a kid and a,

496
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.030
you would get a call and see the philosophy of the upstairs people and I think

497
00:26:41.031 --> 00:26:44.130
it rang different for the nortons if for the people upstairs,
so a lot to you,

498
00:26:44.131 --> 00:26:48.420
if you are quiet you can just like pick it up and listen in and then that you

499
00:26:48.421 --> 00:26:51.230
could listen to someone's conversation from upstairs and sometimes they'd go

500
00:26:51.231 --> 00:26:53.730
where I'm on the phone and you have to go.
Oh,
okay.

501
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:58.710
Different families shared align.
Wow.
Party.

502
00:26:58.711 --> 00:27:01.890
I think it was called a,
I dunno if it was a party line.

503
00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:03.150
I believe it was called the party line,

504
00:27:03.151 --> 00:27:05.040
but it was nothing to do with like 900 numbers.

505
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:08.280
And did I just make it like less expensive or it's just the only option?

506
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.390
Probably.
I think,
again,
this is in the late seventies when I was,
you know,

507
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:15.570
10 11 nine years old.
So that's crazy.
Yeah,

508
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.570
I don't remember that at all.
I don't know if I experienced that.

509
00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:22.230
That might've been on the east coast.
I was on the west coast back then.

510
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.180
I was in the west coast from my age seven to 10 where,

511
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.480
uh,
I was living in San Francisco.
Oh,
okay.

512
00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:35.100
I guess seven to 11 and 11 to 13 yeah.
Seven to 11 in San Francisco.

513
00:27:35.101 --> 00:27:38.580
11 and 13 in Florida.
And then Boston.

514
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.240
Yeah.
So that they didn't have the party lines back then.

515
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:45.390
I don't know if they had,
or if it was just rapport.
People.
We weren't poor,

516
00:27:45.391 --> 00:27:47.280
but we didn't have a lot of money.
I mean,
my dad,

517
00:27:47.281 --> 00:27:50.430
I think you had to work at that point or he was in and out of work from
trucking,

518
00:27:50.431 --> 00:27:54.240
so maybe that was a quite some money saving thing.
We were pretty poor back then.

519
00:27:54.241 --> 00:27:57.210
We were on welfare.
We drank powdered milk.
The whole lear,

520
00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:00.500
I don't know if I ever had powdered milk.
It sucks.
Right?
It's not good.
No.
Yeah,

521
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:04.650
it's also very nerve wracking when you're a kid and you know that it's down the

522
00:28:04.651 --> 00:28:09.300
powdered milk,
you know?
And you know that like,
times really are tough.

523
00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:13.860
It's just,
it's a creepy feeling like,
Whoa,
we gonna run out of food.
You know,

524
00:28:13.861 --> 00:28:16.680
like people would freak out if you ate too much.
It's like,
you know,

525
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:22.040
being poor is very stressful to everybody and in comparison to the rest of the

526
00:28:22.081 --> 00:28:26.700
world,
you're rich,
right?
We talked about this before on this show we have,

527
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:30.930
not you,
but the 1% everybody uses that term.

528
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:35.340
The 1% the top 1% of ruining everything to be 1% globally.

529
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:40.050
The top 1% globally,
all you need to make is $34,000 a year.
Wow.

530
00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.530
I don't know that.
Yeah,
that's,

531
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:48.500
I mean I wouldn't say if you made $34,000 a year,
you're poor,
but it's,

532
00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:52.770
it's not rich.
It's,
it's certainly you're in trouble if you have a family.

533
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.220
If you make in $34,000 a year and you have children to feed,
but it's a fucking,

534
00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.550
that's not a lot of money.
I guess it all depends on where you live too.

535
00:28:59.551 --> 00:29:00.271
You would have your single,

536
00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:03.000
in New York where you know you may get 34 grand a year.

537
00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:06.540
It's very hard to find a comfortable living space in New York and have a good

538
00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:08.850
life there.
If you're only making 34 it's almost impossible.

539
00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:12.930
It's almost impossible just for your rent.
Your rent might be 34 grand a year.

540
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.360
Jesus Christ.
34 grand a year is only,

541
00:29:15.361 --> 00:29:18.600
what does that a little bit more than two grand a month.
Yeah,
that,
good luck.

542
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.560
Good fucking luck.
Finding an apartment in New York for two grand a month.

543
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:24.030
Good fucking luck.

544
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.850
Did you ever see where I lived before I came and we did a cribs that opie and

545
00:29:26.851 --> 00:29:30.810
Anthony like 2001 when I lived at Florentine and there was fucking black mall.

546
00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.020
We split it.
$900 rent between me,
him and his girlfriend at the time.

547
00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:37.560
And when you walk in,
there's video of it.
They did.

548
00:29:37.561 --> 00:29:39.840
I kept Jim Norton cribs and um,

549
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:43.270
the old producer Rick and Steve came to my apartment and I thought it was a

550
00:29:43.271 --> 00:29:47.710
great place.
I had no idea what a fucking cess pool I lived in.

551
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.880
And when you look,
there was a picture on the wall and when you moved it,

552
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.660
black mold was in the,
I don't know if you can bring that up.
It's a video.

553
00:29:55.661 --> 00:29:58.990
You don't want the volume,
but you can see it for that's my old place.

554
00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:00.600
There's fucking,
uh,

555
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:03.310
you could zip in a little bit as we're walking up these steps here.

556
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:07.180
This was cliffside Park,
New Jersey.
Where'd you guys live?
This cliffside Park,

557
00:30:07.181 --> 00:30:09.640
New Jersey.
Upstairs about six miles from New York.

558
00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:12.370
You could see the river from the end of the blog side parts all black mold on

559
00:30:12.371 --> 00:30:16.120
the wall and up in the corners.
Oh my God.

560
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:17.740
That shit's really bad for you.

561
00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:21.250
I wonder if that's contributing to my breathing problems.
Bad sleeper.

562
00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.350
I guarantee you it did.
But look at,
look at it leaking from fucking down,
um,

563
00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.580
from bad picture behind the picture.

564
00:30:27.581 --> 00:30:30.580
You know that we do move the picture and I hope it's right now.
Yeah,

565
00:30:30.581 --> 00:30:35.200
I think we do a move it.
Um,
it doesn't,
it's not,
it's not good.

566
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:39.640
Brace yourself.
Yeah,
they put that fucking 2000 graphic.

567
00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:46.150
Oh my God.
That's all black mold.
Yeah.
All Bloody Shit,
Jim.
Yeah.

568
00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.060
That's really bad for you,
man.
That's insane.

569
00:30:49.061 --> 00:30:52.750
Why is it behind that picture like that?
I think we had a very leaky living room.

570
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:56.740
When you look down at my room,
I'm not as Florentines all this.
When you,

571
00:30:56.741 --> 00:31:00.580
when you looked at it,
I had a,
uh,
we had a very leaky living room,

572
00:31:00.581 --> 00:31:02.980
which you might see like we had rain coming in all the time.

573
00:31:02.981 --> 00:31:06.490
We used to put like four or five buckets in the living room and it would rain.

574
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.130
Oh my God.
And it was a,
yeah,
that was,
that was our living room.

575
00:31:09.131 --> 00:31:10.700
That was where I lived.
Um,

576
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.960
did Florentine software the same sort of cardiovascular problems?

577
00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.930
I don't know him,
you know,
like he,
he had to be,

578
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.820
Jim had so much black mold in his bedroom,
he had died.
That was,
as the roof does,

579
00:31:20.821 --> 00:31:25.660
he gets almost caving and Jim had fucking Bob Tin foil against the whole bottom

580
00:31:25.661 --> 00:31:29.470
third of his wall just to see the black moldy.
Couldn't see it.
What,

581
00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.390
but you know what?
I think too,

582
00:31:31.391 --> 00:31:35.170
part of my breathing problems where I think part of my breathing problems or the

583
00:31:35.171 --> 00:31:38.680
way I fucking sexually edge,
I've thought of that,
all that jerking off.

584
00:31:38.681 --> 00:31:40.420
And like a lot of times I hold my breath,
I don't even know.

585
00:31:40.421 --> 00:31:42.490
I'm doing it like when I'm jerking off and I'm like,

586
00:31:42.491 --> 00:31:44.140
you're breathing fucked up man.

587
00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:47.620
Like I really think that that messed up my bio rhythms or whatever.

588
00:31:47.621 --> 00:31:52.120
Like my sleep.
You fucked up your asleep by edging.
I think I do.

589
00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.660
It's so much like right before bed.
If I do something dirty and I jerk off,

590
00:31:55.661 --> 00:31:59.440
I can't sleep.
I'm wired and I think I fucked myself up.

591
00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:02.710
Oh my God.

592
00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.920
Well I know that that black mold stuff definitely can have an effect on you,
Tom.

593
00:32:05.921 --> 00:32:09.640
Like has had that in his house and you had to demolish like half of his fucking

594
00:32:09.641 --> 00:32:12.430
house did.
If it didn't make it,
he was sick all the time.

595
00:32:12.431 --> 00:32:15.410
He felt like shit all the time.
He's like,
just felt terrible.

596
00:32:15.411 --> 00:32:18.880
It was like immune system was just fucked and he couldn't figure out what was
up.

597
00:32:18.881 --> 00:32:22.660
And then he did some tests and he found that his house was infested with black

598
00:32:22.661 --> 00:32:24.070
mold.
How long did he live like that?

599
00:32:24.071 --> 00:32:26.650
Cause I was there for about three years maximum.
I don't know.

600
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:31.560
It's a good question.
And I've been out since 2000 or no,
2002.
Yeah.

601
00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:32.231
I don't know.

602
00:32:32.231 --> 00:32:35.590
I don't know how much of a pain in the ass it was or how long it lasts it or

603
00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.070
what.
But I know that it was an issue and then he had to,
I know the specifics,
but

604
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.310
<v 1>I know that he had to demolish like a large portion of his house.</v>

605
00:32:43.311 --> 00:32:44.150
It's a big deal.

606
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.740
They have to cut the windows out and cut the doors out and cut the walls out and

607
00:32:48.741 --> 00:32:53.000
then spray everything for this fucking mold shit and kill all this mall and they

608
00:32:53.001 --> 00:32:55.670
have to make sure they kill all of it.
It's really bad for you.
Yeah,

609
00:32:55.671 --> 00:32:59.240
it's super bad for you.
That's tough.
Like all over your walls like that.
Uh,

610
00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:04.350
you guys were essentially walking through like air that was tainted by that

611
00:33:05.091 --> 00:33:07.100
fungus.
Can you,
can you like,

612
00:33:07.101 --> 00:33:11.330
I have trouble taking deep breath once in a while like I can now,

613
00:33:11.331 --> 00:33:14.180
but did I feel like I get,
something stops me and I can't sleep.

614
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.860
Like Anthony had a great way.
Who says you?
Anthony?

615
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:18.740
Comeya such a great way of describing anything.
And he said,
yeah,

616
00:33:18.741 --> 00:33:23.060
you have trouble getting that last click and that's a deep breath.
We're clicks.

617
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.480
And you had that final full breath.
Yeah.

618
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:28.670
But there's times where I can't get to that full click.

619
00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.120
Like I get that a lot when I'm laying down and I have to prop myself up on my

620
00:33:32.121 --> 00:33:34.880
right elbow and then I can take a deep breath.

621
00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:38.060
So I don't know if things are sitting wrong inside or whatever.
Well,
you know,

622
00:33:38.061 --> 00:33:42.180
you can do breathing exercises.
I'm not really an expert in these of,

623
00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:47.180
I fucked with them a little bit and I do a,
a version of them when I do a,

624
00:33:47.181 --> 00:33:48.770
the isolation tank sometimes,

625
00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:53.150
or I'll take a one minute breath in and then a one minute breath out.

626
00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:56.930
And so I dragged my inward breath for one minute.
Oh Wow.

627
00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:59.360
And then I drag my outward breath for one minute.

628
00:33:59.361 --> 00:34:03.200
And it requires a lot of discipline because you start panicking,
you know,

629
00:34:03.201 --> 00:34:03.891
start panicking.

630
00:34:03.891 --> 00:34:07.160
Especially when you breathing it out because you've got to push out the whole

631
00:34:07.161 --> 00:34:10.700
breath,
you know?
So if I'm breathing in like a,
I don't want to,

632
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:13.460
I don't want to give everybody the boring two minute version of it,

633
00:34:13.461 --> 00:34:14.780
but I literally will go like this.

634
00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.100
I like clean my system out and get ready and then I'll,

635
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:43.030
I don't know how long that was but the first,

636
00:34:43.031 --> 00:34:46.040
and it was probably only about 30 seconds probably about getting panicky,

637
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:50.050
about half of what I do.
I do a full minute.
Are you really beat out?

638
00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.730
Because what happens is I'll take a deep breath and then like 10 seconds into my

639
00:34:52.731 --> 00:34:57.500
body goes your full unfinished.
Fucking can't do it.
Hello.

640
00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:00.560
So like if you look at the seven right now on that clock right there and just

641
00:35:00.561 --> 00:35:03.090
start everything and just give yourself,

642
00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:06.440
give yourself a little break and go

643
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.860
God this is boring podcast.
I'm not breathing out but I am.
Yeah,

644
00:35:18.861 --> 00:35:20.180
I just stopped because you're right.

645
00:35:20.181 --> 00:35:23.270
It's like I literally people listening to me breathe and if they would be,

646
00:35:23.271 --> 00:35:26.630
they'd be hoping I stopped.
Just try it folks.
Just give it a try.

647
00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:31.250
Once you get it down then the way I do it in an isolation tank,

648
00:35:31.251 --> 00:35:36.230
cause I do a 60 count a count in my head while I'm breathing and slow as fucking

649
00:35:36.231 --> 00:35:40.020
hard.
It's hard to hold your breath for a minute.
It seems like it shouldn't be.

650
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:42.240
It seems like,
well the,
the guys that have the world records,

651
00:35:42.241 --> 00:35:44.310
they hold their breath for like seven minutes or some shit like that.

652
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:49.460
Like David Blaine does he hold his breath for like a 14 minute tiny period.
Yeah.

653
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:53.040
He had some world record breath.
I think there's like a caveat to that.

654
00:35:53.041 --> 00:35:56.820
He might have ingested some oxygen before he did or something like that.

655
00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:02.010
17 minutes.
Whoa.
If you ingest the oxygen,
that helps.

656
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:05.310
I don't know.
Brian Count told me that.
Take it with a grain of salt.

657
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.060
Is that what he did?
Really just breathing of the radios.
It's funny.

658
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:14.280
I should take it was luckily it wasn't the radio.
It would go,

659
00:36:14.281 --> 00:36:17.400
what the fuck is wrong with you table?
It was that.
Um,
but that's uh,

660
00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:22.410
it's a good discipline for breath and there's all sorts of different yoga

661
00:36:22.651 --> 00:36:25.680
breathing called Pranayama and a bunch of other different names.

662
00:36:25.681 --> 00:36:28.110
They have four different styles of breathing,

663
00:36:28.111 --> 00:36:33.111
but breath exercises or like you can exercise your lungs with like deep

664
00:36:34.171 --> 00:36:38.490
breathing exercises where you actually strengthen your lungs and you can

665
00:36:38.491 --> 00:36:43.200
condition your lungs and you can get used to breathing in a way.
Like they have,

666
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:48.030
um,
a type of breeding they call shamonic breath work where you can go into

667
00:36:48.031 --> 00:36:53.031
psychedelic states like real drug induced states with no drugs and you can do it

668
00:36:53.131 --> 00:36:57.390
all from this,
what did they call it?
Haul off something.
Breathing.
Holla.

669
00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.350
Holotropic breathing is at it.
I've never done it,
but Aubrey,

670
00:37:01.351 --> 00:37:04.770
my friend Aubrey has done it a bunch of times and wants to take you to get that

671
00:37:04.771 --> 00:37:06.300
way.
I don't know.
It's a good question.

672
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.140
I think if you took a class in it and then somebody can show you how to do it.

673
00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:14.070
I know I can't pay for shit.
Holotropic breathing.

674
00:37:14.071 --> 00:37:18.840
It's a practice uses that uses breathing and other elements to putatively never

675
00:37:18.841 --> 00:37:22.740
used that word.
Allow access to non ordinary states of consciousness.

676
00:37:22.741 --> 00:37:25.290
It was developed by Stanislav Grof,

677
00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:30.590
a successor to his lad l s d base psychedelic therapy following the suppression

678
00:37:31.051 --> 00:37:34.890
of Legal Lsd use in the late 1960s oh,
that's interesting.

679
00:37:34.891 --> 00:37:39.120
So he came up with that.
Wow.
What a fucking genius.

680
00:37:39.121 --> 00:37:42.900
That guy out of the fact he did a lot of acid before that helped.
Uh,
Brett,

681
00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:46.680
he was always one step away from just being out of his fucking mind to take two

682
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:51.000
deep breaths and tie again.
The rest of us had to do with the acid.

683
00:37:51.001 --> 00:37:54.840
Probably told them how to teach people.
Yeah.
You know the assets like,
listen man,

684
00:37:54.841 --> 00:37:56.670
we're going to go away for a little bit.
It's going to be a while.

685
00:37:56.671 --> 00:37:57.750
People are going to still talk about us,

686
00:37:57.751 --> 00:38:00.930
but it's going to be a few years probably till the two thousands when really

687
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.510
people just say,
why exactly is this stuff illegal again?

688
00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:07.010
But until then you can do this.
I wonder if it's,
if it's just like a lot of,

689
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:08.520
you know,
you gotta you gotta you stand up too fast.

690
00:38:08.521 --> 00:38:11.970
If they're breathing too fast,
you can't like this is how fucking much as you.

691
00:38:11.971 --> 00:38:14.880
I don't sleep for shit.
I bet it that my dumps sleep apnea for years,

692
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:16.560
but I literally will go to the gym,

693
00:38:16.561 --> 00:38:20.790
newer cap and my trainer has me do like literally sometimes walking up the
steps.

694
00:38:20.791 --> 00:38:23.820
I'm tired.
Really fucking awful.
Now you,

695
00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:26.700
you still have the sleep apnea issue and I put the,
I have so many masks,

696
00:38:26.701 --> 00:38:29.220
so many fans of sent me masking cause I'm a stuffy nose.

697
00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:32.600
I hate my fucking nose so much.
You have no idea.
It's always congested.

698
00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:36.140
You got a deviated septum operation.
That's what happened and help.

699
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:37.810
<v 3>It really helped it,
but you know,
you know what I mean?</v>

700
00:38:37.811 --> 00:38:40.630
Now instead of being completely stuffed all the time,
it's partially stuffed.

701
00:38:40.631 --> 00:38:43.960
Most of the time it's much better because I have allergies but I can't get used

702
00:38:43.961 --> 00:38:46.900
to in mass comm.
Claustrophobic,
which you should probably live in Arizona.

703
00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:51.160
You should force opie to live,
move to Arizona to do the show.
It's dry air.
Yeah.

704
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.950
I don't know if that would help them.
A lot of hookers.
Yeah.

705
00:38:53.951 --> 00:38:57.250
I was in there recently in Phoenix.
Um,
did I partake?

706
00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.870
I don't think I did.
No.
He's a good boy in Phoenix.
He's a good boy.

707
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:06.580
Good boy.
No,
no hooking and Phoenix.
I like Phoenix.
It's a fun fucking town.

708
00:39:06.581 --> 00:39:09.610
They're wild ass people.
It's a,
it's an interesting town.

709
00:39:09.611 --> 00:39:12.640
It doesn't get enough respect.
Yeah.
And have a good God downtime there.

710
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:17.380
Warren Sapp wait,
what a weekend.
He hadn't fucking painting.
Yeah,

711
00:39:17.381 --> 00:39:21.500
he had a good weekend.
Wouldn't involve cocaine.
And it prompts,
you're showing,

712
00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.970
I don't know.
There was two girls feel like there's some prostitution.

713
00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:27.280
Well that that was,
he was arrested because it was an altercation in his room.

714
00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.660
And these girls,
like,

715
00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:31.630
I guess that he filmed them sucking his dick on his phone and they wanted the

716
00:39:31.631 --> 00:39:34.270
money.
But I wish I could have sat down with them and said,
Warren,

717
00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:36.250
sometimes when you,

718
00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.740
when a girl is like that and she's freaking out and they want a few extra

719
00:39:38.741 --> 00:39:43.660
hundred and they'll leave,
he got up to do it because you're paying your,
yeah,

720
00:39:43.661 --> 00:39:48.520
it's shitty and it's not part of the deal.
But you are,
if they want,

721
00:39:48.521 --> 00:39:53.050
I want $10,000.
That's different bullshit.
It is bullshit.

722
00:39:53.051 --> 00:39:55.330
It's a bad business practice demand to see her.

723
00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:00.280
So maybe I'm confusing his story and I believe I am with Mike Tyson story cause

724
00:40:00.281 --> 00:40:03.690
he was arrested in Phoenix and he had cocaine on him but is a long,
tall.
Yeah,

725
00:40:03.691 --> 00:40:08.691
no this was this passable past and he lost his gig and because he played shoved

726
00:40:09.281 --> 00:40:12.650
the woman or whatever know.
And um,

727
00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:15.760
but there was an altercation between them and him and I've had that where you

728
00:40:15.761 --> 00:40:19.060
can feel,
cause I don't drink so maybe have a better sense for it.
Like,

729
00:40:19.061 --> 00:40:20.920
if you're drunk,
you might be fucking,
not thinking,

730
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.520
but you can feel when it's about to go to a weird place and a lot of times you

731
00:40:25.521 --> 00:40:28.990
got to back out and be calm.
And you know what I mean?
Like I had to go on time,

732
00:40:28.991 --> 00:40:31.540
we would just text dirty shit all the time.

733
00:40:31.541 --> 00:40:33.880
And she was threatening like she didn't know who I was as a comedian,

734
00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:37.960
so she was threatening to expose me for my dirty fantasies and none of them were

735
00:40:37.961 --> 00:40:40.330
things that would be that they a little bit on,
slightly embarrassing,

736
00:40:40.331 --> 00:40:43.960
but none of them were like Horace,
who's threatening to expose.
She wanted money.

737
00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.930
What?
And I kind of said to her,
I'm like,
first of all,

738
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:51.160
everyone I know knows I'm a pervert.
Everyone that hears you on the radio,

739
00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.440
she did well.
She would always call the radio.
All the people that,
oh,

740
00:40:53.441 --> 00:40:54.180
she didn't know.
Yeah.

741
00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:56.500
Like you have no idea the person you're actually talking to right now.

742
00:40:56.501 --> 00:40:57.700
So I'm like,
do what you have to do.

743
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.380
But you've literally just made a fucking committed a felony through text.

744
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:06.480
You're trying to blackmail me for money,
a dope and show that.
Yes.
I'm like,
yeah,

745
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.820
but then she's like,
well I wouldn't do it,
but somebody would.
I'm like,
what?
Oh,

746
00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:14.560
we're tempting to blackberry.
But I wasn't even mad at her,
but I said to her,

747
00:41:14.561 --> 00:41:16.120
this is the point.
I said to her,
look,

748
00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:19.840
why don't we both just talk tomorrow when we have clearer heads and whatnot.

749
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:22.360
Let's not fight.
I said,
let's walk away.

750
00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:26.420
I didn't say you fucking cut cause sometime you got to.
Yeah,

751
00:41:26.421 --> 00:41:29.720
I was pointing people on the,
but I said,
uh,

752
00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:33.320
you got to give people an out once in a while and that's what Warren Sapp in

753
00:41:33.321 --> 00:41:34.070
that moment probably

754
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.400
<v 0>didn't do.
He was probably so angry.
Like fuck you bitch and fuck you.</v>

755
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:41.150
And they're arguing instead of realizing I got a Gig and the cops are gonna show

756
00:41:41.151 --> 00:41:45.260
up,
give her the out or I look,
I don't want to fight with you.

757
00:41:45.261 --> 00:41:47.170
Let's calm down.
You wanted,

758
00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:50.750
here's an extra 300 let's walk away and maybe we'll talk tomorrow and do it

759
00:41:50.751 --> 00:41:53.300
again.
Then she thinks she might see some more money coming in tomorrow.

760
00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:57.320
She might actually be amenable to month to not screaming.
So whatever.

761
00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:59.390
I've also heard there was trainees at blackmailed rappers.

762
00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:04.110
I want a $30,000 in the lobby.
I've heard stories of that.
Wow.
30,000 yeah,
yeah,

763
00:42:04.111 --> 00:42:06.500
yeah.
I've had a few trainings tell me that until like,
yeah,
you know,

764
00:42:06.501 --> 00:42:09.740
this has been rappers or whatever,
that fucking got black by a girls.

765
00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.560
They start freaking out in the lobby and the guy's like,
all right,
come back up.

766
00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:16.250
And they want money.
Wow.
Being a rappers,
a lot of pressure,
man.
Peter Comic,

767
00:42:16.251 --> 00:42:18.170
nobody cares what the fuck you do.
Being a rapper,

768
00:42:18.171 --> 00:42:21.590
he's gotta be a motherfucker cause pressure because they're not meeting.

769
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:24.380
Oh the train age wise and stuff,
we're all over again.

770
00:42:24.381 --> 00:42:27.110
If they're into the weird shit,
you can't show weakness,

771
00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:30.490
you can't eat m and m can self deprecate.
But that,
that whole act,

772
00:42:30.491 --> 00:42:34.130
that whole side of psychology is harder for those guys because it's seen as

773
00:42:34.131 --> 00:42:37.040
weakness and it's always got to be you and partying with a fat ass girl and a

774
00:42:37.041 --> 00:42:39.950
car.
And I came from nothing and now I'm the shit and fuck you.

775
00:42:39.951 --> 00:42:44.030
And it's like damn soda from the bottom.
Now we're here.
Yeah,
that's a good one.

776
00:42:44.031 --> 00:42:45.300
That's a catchy fucking tune.

777
00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:48.490
I don't even allow the phone to ballroom modal hold too.
Oh boy.

778
00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:52.350
Is that a good one?
Yeah,
it's a smart move.
Yeah.
It's a weird cultural,

779
00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.020
it's a culture of machismo.

780
00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:58.280
It's like one of the most macho forms of music ever and a lot of ways.
Right.

781
00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:01.490
More than rock.
Cause they don't want anything.
They have ballads too.

782
00:43:01.491 --> 00:43:02.870
But I would say,
but he got to do it.

783
00:43:02.871 --> 00:43:05.360
It was shooting each other like the guys in rock were never knowing that and

784
00:43:05.361 --> 00:43:08.300
being a culture of their friends were getting shot.
Right.
That's a difference.

785
00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:12.590
They took it to a totally new place.
The rap game.
And especially Gangsta rap.

786
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:17.590
I mean they made like east coast,
west coast rivalries involve gunfights.

787
00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:21.910
Yeah.
Like that shit never existed before.
And where was there ever a guy and in,

788
00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.520
in rock and roll that was like openly,
like shook night.

789
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:28.180
There really wasn't Phil Spector.

790
00:43:28.181 --> 00:43:29.970
There was as close as you calm and he wasn't a gangster.

791
00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:32.600
He's just a fucking Kook in the Hendricks manager.

792
00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:37.780
Hendrix had a manager that apparently according to a guy who was once one of the

793
00:43:37.881 --> 00:43:40.250
roadies,
are there security guys,
whatever the fuck it was,

794
00:43:40.251 --> 00:43:44.090
he just put out a book saying that he thinks that not only did the manager kill

795
00:43:44.091 --> 00:43:47.840
Hendrix,
but he killed Hendricks girlfriend too.
He's dead,
I guess.
Yeah.

796
00:43:47.841 --> 00:43:48.920
Hendricks girlfriend was,

797
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:54.370
she fell or was pushed off of a roof and Soho like right after Hendrix died.

798
00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:56.391
And you know,

799
00:43:56.391 --> 00:44:00.860
the idea was that she committed suicide or she knew too much and she was killed.

800
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:02.750
I doubt that he use what I would guess,

801
00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:04.400
knowing nothing other than what you just said.

802
00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:07.040
And she allowed to Hendricks to die because she was afraid of the cops or find

803
00:44:07.041 --> 00:44:07.874
the drugs in the room.

804
00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:11.250
So that was why Hendrix died because he could have been saved if you just call

805
00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:13.860
the ambulance,
but she didn't.
So the manager probably say,

806
00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.290
you know how much money you cost me?

807
00:44:15.291 --> 00:44:18.350
You dumb fuck and throw off the roof if that's like,
like Fort Apache.

808
00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:20.660
But when I Ella towards that kid off the roof,
it was probably like that.

809
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:22.320
That could have been the case.
The,

810
00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:27.330
the book was arguing that Hendricks was leaving the manager and the manager had

811
00:44:28.011 --> 00:44:32.070
a stranglehold on Hendricks for a bunch of stupid reasons.
And one of

812
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.080
<v 1>them was that he had faked a kidnapping.</v>

813
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:38.890
He had a kidnap Jimmy and then rescue Jimmy had some people kidnap him and then

814
00:44:38.891 --> 00:44:41.070
he said,
look,
I rescued you.
You're going to be fine.

815
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.650
I talked to the mob guys and everything's going to be okay.

816
00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:48.960
And this is what this guy who wrote the book,
um,
fight,
try to find that.
Jamie,

817
00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:52.050
try to find,
it was really recent,
like within the last year or so,

818
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:55.380
this guy wrote this book and it was really fascinating.

819
00:44:55.381 --> 00:44:58.170
I heard him being interviewed or read it.
I don't remember which,

820
00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.820
but it's a pretty,
uh,
pretty interesting.
The theories at this guy puts forth,

821
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.550
isn't that you're alive now are dead.
I think the manager is dead too.

822
00:45:05.551 --> 00:45:07.200
But the manager was a notorious criminal.

823
00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:14.300
Undoubtedly a bad guy and they believe that he really did have Jimi Hendrix

824
00:45:15.721 --> 00:45:20.490
kidnapped and then stepped in to save him,
you know,
to let them know,
you know,

825
00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:23.310
you've been around loyalty to me,
I'm going to keep you from all these bad guys.

826
00:45:23.311 --> 00:45:27.940
I want to kidnap you.
And you know,
that's a,
that's a crazy tactic to kill it,

827
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:30.660
to keep an artist and you're stable.
Yeah.
It's fairly brilliant though.

828
00:45:30.661 --> 00:45:32.840
I mean if you've got a Hendrickson,
you're stable,
you know,
you want to,

829
00:45:32.841 --> 00:45:35.730
you you got to pull out all stops.
Well I think he realized that,

830
00:45:35.731 --> 00:45:39.150
I think he realized he probably signed them before he really hit.

831
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:42.300
And then once he really hit,
he's like holy Jesus Christ,

832
00:45:42.301 --> 00:45:45.620
look what I got on my hands.
Only like the greatest rock and roll guy ever.
Yup.

833
00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.460
So with this guy was saying,
yeah,

834
00:45:47.461 --> 00:45:52.410
book ups or the man who saved Jimmy Hendrix from the Mafia.
Is that it?
Romance,

835
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:57.630
mob,
kidnapping and waterskiing mishap.
Maybe.

836
00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:03.330
I don't,
I think that's just part of it.
Yeah.
Just look up Jimmy Hendrix.

837
00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:07.530
Um,
manage your,
killed him.
Look up that and see if you find,
oh God,

838
00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:11.060
it was sexist,
racist history of SNL.
Like just looked at that headline.

839
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:15.690
God Good God.
How about rolling stone?
Boy,
they shit the bed.
Yeah,

840
00:46:15.691 --> 00:46:19.320
they did.
It's amazing.
They get to put the fucking Boston bomber on the cover.

841
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:24.720
That,
that was disgusting.
And then this new thing,

842
00:46:24.721 --> 00:46:26.280
well it not just they put him on the cover,

843
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.980
they put him on the cover looking cute.
A glamor shot,

844
00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:34.050
glamor shot looking cute and his new book.
Yeah.
Rock roadie.

845
00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:39.320
Write claims that Jeffrey told him he plied Hendricks with pills and alcohol in

846
00:46:39.901 --> 00:46:44.100
order to kill him and claim on the guitars.
Life Insurance.
Wow.

847
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:49.980
Wow.
Yeah.
Who knows,
man.

848
00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.750
I wonder if that,
I wonder if that um,

849
00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.360
hotel room is still there with that hotel has gone.

850
00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:59.610
I know they took down the one that we're,
Bobby Kennedy was killed.

851
00:46:59.611 --> 00:47:04.150
The ambassador is gone.
Yeah.
They just took that down.

852
00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:06.330
Put a school there or something.
What are the hotel still stands?

853
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:09.900
We'll get this bullet.
Who said,
I was in London the night of Jimmy's death.

854
00:47:09.901 --> 00:47:11.700
We went around to Monica's hotel room.

855
00:47:11.701 --> 00:47:14.970
Got a handful of pills and stuffed and when his mouth and port a few bottles of

856
00:47:14.971 --> 00:47:17.880
red wine deep into his windpipe.
Well,
it doesn't,

857
00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:20.850
doesn't that seem there would be like some sign of struggle if they that was

858
00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:24.270
Hendrix doing,
there'll be like cuts on them or something.

859
00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:28.230
Manager was allegedly word that Hendricks is about to sack him.

860
00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:31.440
He had recently taken a life insurance policy of $2 million.
Hmm.

861
00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:34.390
That's if that's true.
That's wild.
But Jeffrey is the beneficiary.

862
00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:38.650
We had to do it.
Jenny was worth much more than him dead than alive.

863
00:47:38.651 --> 00:47:40.460
Jeffery's quote,
it's telling.
Right.
That's son of a bitch.

864
00:47:40.461 --> 00:47:43.030
Just gonna leave me if I lost my lose everything.
Oh Man.

865
00:47:43.031 --> 00:47:47.290
I don't know about all that.
Yeah,
it's all hearsay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Who knows?
It's also,

866
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.740
yeah,
this guy wants to sell a book and he wants to make money.
The guy's dead.

867
00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:53.270
The guy can't defend himself.
Right.
Who the fuck knows?
Meanwhile,

868
00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:55.870
we just spread that rumor such Jay.
That's how you do it.

869
00:47:55.871 --> 00:47:59.390
But we did say allegedly,
allegedly,
I love saying that.
It's a good word.

870
00:47:59.391 --> 00:48:03.220
Good word.
Protection.
A lawsuit.
Ooh,
boy,
you want to throw out that allegedly,

871
00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:07.000
allegedly is always important.
It's a nice little buffer.

872
00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:10.740
Then I think even when allegedly I wonder by the way off the total of the Saudi

873
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:13.540
before I forget Jones,
uh,
against uh,

874
00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:17.290
on my God Anthony Johnson.
What do you think?
It's a good fight.

875
00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:19.300
It's a very good fight.
It's um,

876
00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:23.350
it's all about whether or not Johnson can get ahold of Joan's because Joan's is

877
00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.620
very good at using his reach better than anybody ever.

878
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:31.800
He's the very best that utilizing reach and he's also very good at using

879
00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:36.700
techniques to keep people at bay.
He used a straight arm all the time,

880
00:48:36.701 --> 00:48:40.750
which is not good because he pokes guys in the arm in the I occasionally.
Um,

881
00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:44.530
so he's got to make sure if he does do that,
he puts palm to the forehead,

882
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:46.330
fingers really pulled back,

883
00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:49.990
make sure that the fingers are an issue cause it's a legit technique that comes

884
00:48:49.991 --> 00:48:51.710
from weak tie and Moitai.

885
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:55.180
You're see a lot of that they push off and in a leg kick,
push off,

886
00:48:55.181 --> 00:48:59.590
elbow push off punch.
But there's a lot of pushing off and there's,
you know,

887
00:48:59.591 --> 00:49:00.381
because they're,

888
00:49:00.381 --> 00:49:03.310
they're doing different than boxing whether utilizing all these other techniques

889
00:49:03.311 --> 00:49:05.020
like kicks and elbows and knees and stuff.

890
00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:10.380
So pushing off and then pushing into quenching all that is a like a valid part

891
00:49:10.391 --> 00:49:12.160
of that style of striking.

892
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:15.910
And it's probably one of the most effective styles of striking Johnson's really

893
00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:19.750
fucking good at Moy Thai.
He's got a really good Dutch kickboxing coach.

894
00:49:19.751 --> 00:49:22.320
This Guy Henri Hooft who is the lead trainer,

895
00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:27.340
the Blackzilians which is a Florida based crew that has a lot of high level

896
00:49:27.941 --> 00:49:31.150
strikers come through.
Um,
Tyrone Spong trains there.

897
00:49:31.151 --> 00:49:34.630
Alistair Overeem was training there for a bit and uh,

898
00:49:34.631 --> 00:49:38.140
they have a lot of like big named guys like Niki holds skin is like a,

899
00:49:38.141 --> 00:49:43.141
a a famous Dutch guy who fights and glory and a bunch of other guys come in

900
00:49:43.601 --> 00:49:47.380
through there.
This is like a go cart Saki,
like real,
real high level guys.

901
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:49.540
And so they all trained in this one spot.

902
00:49:49.541 --> 00:49:54.280
So Johnson is getting like super high level training and kickboxing like key.

903
00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:56.710
There was pictures of him sparring with Rico Verhoeven.

904
00:49:56.950 --> 00:50:01.000
Rico Verhoeven is the glory heavyweight champion of the world and kickboxing bad

905
00:50:01.001 --> 00:50:03.940
motherfucker,
just like super technical kickboxer.

906
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:07.870
So if Johnson's in their sparring with that guy and a daily basis,

907
00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:12.871
he's getting some super high quality striking training and Johnson has lethal

908
00:50:13.151 --> 00:50:17.350
power.
He's really a fucking strong dude,
man.
He's a destroyer.
He said destroyer.

909
00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:22.090
His power is ridiculous and it's incredible that this guy started off his career

910
00:50:22.091 --> 00:50:25.870
in the UFC at one 70 and now he's at two oh five two oh five.

911
00:50:25.871 --> 00:50:27.530
He's just smashing people.

912
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:32.710
Not only did he not lose power going up 35 fucking pounds of competition weight,

913
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:36.080
not even body weight.
Like there's a lot of guys like Hendrix,

914
00:50:36.081 --> 00:50:39.020
they'll fight at one 70,
he'll get the two oh five easy,
uh,

915
00:50:39.021 --> 00:50:41.000
in the downtime cause he just gets fad,

916
00:50:41.001 --> 00:50:45.290
eats a lot of fucking wild pigs and shit cause nutty.
He's a nutty Texas guy,

917
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:49.400
but I'm rumble would get up to that in meat.
He's,

918
00:50:49.401 --> 00:50:53.900
he's got 205 pounds of fucking meat on him.
So he went from one 70,

919
00:50:53.901 --> 00:50:58.370
the weight cut to two oh five comfortable weight cut and just smashing people.

920
00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:01.580
It's crazy.
And it's unprecedented.
No one's ever done it before,
right?

921
00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:03.680
No one's ever like gone up.

922
00:51:03.681 --> 00:51:07.850
Not just one way class but two way classes and been a legit threat to the world

923
00:51:07.851 --> 00:51:12.800
title.
What are they fighting?
They are fighting in May.
That is uh,

924
00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:17.330
may,
um,
what is the date?
23rd of May 23rd.
Come on down.

925
00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:21.230
I may go for that one.
Man.
That's a good one.
Go down,
cuts,
come hang with us.

926
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:24.650
Tom Segura and um,
Ari should fear no.

927
00:51:24.651 --> 00:51:29.060
Tom Score and Tony Hinchcliffe and I are doing the coffee at her with,
oh,

928
00:51:29.061 --> 00:51:32.030
is that not MGM?
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Go out there.

929
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:34.280
The only thing I take off to do is to go see fights.

930
00:51:34.281 --> 00:51:37.820
I take off or nothing else know.
It's awesome.
I mean that's the only hot,

931
00:51:37.821 --> 00:51:39.710
that's a hobby I have is I like to go to UFC and watch.

932
00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:41.810
Like that's my only leisure activity.
Well,

933
00:51:41.811 --> 00:51:45.290
I tell people like one of the funnest times I ever had in Vegas was the time

934
00:51:45.291 --> 00:51:50.291
where I didn't have a gig scheduled and it was you and me and red ban and um,

935
00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:54.240
Bobby Kelly and uh,

936
00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:58.880
and Anthony remember we all ways dice.
Bobby Kelly was there too,
right?

937
00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:03.710
He was,
yeah.
Yes.
And uh,
we all went to see dice.
We all had a steak dinner.

938
00:52:03.711 --> 00:52:04.630
Like,
man,

939
00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:08.610
we had a good fucking meal in us who went down to the Riviera and watched the

940
00:52:08.611 --> 00:52:12.710
show,
hung out with dice and dices all happy to see us.

941
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:16.610
We went backstage,
we're chilling in the green room.
We had a great fucking time.

942
00:52:16.611 --> 00:52:19.790
It was a lot of fun.
That was a great fucking time.
It was really fun.

943
00:52:19.791 --> 00:52:23.780
I was one of my funniest times ever in Vegas and it was also a time to sit like

944
00:52:23.781 --> 00:52:27.500
an audience member and just laugh.
We were just laughing like idiots.

945
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:30.680
Why watched you and I,
but I went out there and I haven't said,

946
00:52:30.681 --> 00:52:31.401
I think I told you,

947
00:52:31.401 --> 00:52:35.090
you're just the first comedy show I sat through in years and I mean fucking

948
00:52:35.091 --> 00:52:38.270
years.
And it was fun to watch.
It was really enjoyable.

949
00:52:38.271 --> 00:52:42.410
I might've seen the end of Ari who I like and then I watched you and it made me

950
00:52:42.411 --> 00:52:46.930
laugh and it was kind of fun just to watch somebody perform who I know in like

951
00:52:46.931 --> 00:52:48.980
and,
and just enjoy it.
Like you said,
it's the audience.

952
00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:51.050
Well I did the same to you and Austin,

953
00:52:51.051 --> 00:52:54.890
I told you that you kind of changed my thinking about two things,

954
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:59.770
about the length of a set and also about too many Dick Jokes.

955
00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:03.020
Cause I would go,
God damn,
I got too many fucking Dick Jokes,
man.

956
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:05.120
But I saw Norton killed,

957
00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:09.740
killed 50 minutes nonstop barrage of Dick Jokes.

958
00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:13.720
And I'm howling laughing and I'm howling and laughing and uh,

959
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:14.930
I remember thinking,
you know what?

960
00:53:14.931 --> 00:53:18.920
I like that you just pound them for 50 minutes.
I was always like,

961
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:21.590
I gotta do at least an hour,
10 maybe an hour or 20.

962
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:25.980
I think an hour is my magic number.
Two an hour now about an hour.
That

963
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.490
<v 0>seems to be like the magic number where people just get tired of listening to</v>

964
00:53:29.491 --> 00:53:29.820
you.

965
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:33.540
So what I do is I bring good guys on the road with me and the good guys do like

966
00:53:33.541 --> 00:53:34.620
at least a half an hour.

967
00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:38.160
So I'll either Hinchcliffe we'll do a half an hour or if I have Hinchcliffe and

968
00:53:38.161 --> 00:53:40.050
Secura they'll each do like 20 minutes.

969
00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:44.820
So there's a nice variety of looks and then I'll do like an hour and it's a

970
00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:48.510
great show.
It's a big pack together fast.
But like when I go to see a movie,

971
00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:52.610
I'm so happy with a kickass 90 minute movie.
That's good.
Yeah.

972
00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:54.660
You don't have to give me a three hour movie,
man.

973
00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:58.050
I don't need a lord of the rings.
Fucking,
I don't need to drag it.
That bitch out.

974
00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:01.020
The one and a half hours is a good number,
you know?

975
00:54:01.021 --> 00:54:04.830
So he's seeing you and you crush for 50 minutes.
It like put it in my head.

976
00:54:04.831 --> 00:54:08.040
I was like,
you know what?
I really enjoyed that.
And as an audience member,

977
00:54:08.041 --> 00:54:10.920
I would really enjoy that.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You know what it is?
It's like you just,

978
00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:14.250
I go through my phases where I'm really filthy or I'm not as dirty.

979
00:54:14.251 --> 00:54:17.520
It all depends on what I'm,
what's happening in my life,
but like when I'm single,

980
00:54:17.521 --> 00:54:20.400
like I am now,
I'm dirtier because doing more dirty shit,

981
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:23.060
there's more stuff to report.

982
00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:28.120
I get a special coming out Friday the 24th is why I'm in La and um,

983
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:29.880
I'm really happy with it.
Nobody leaves.

984
00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:31.710
It's like you always have to say that about your latest project,

985
00:54:31.711 --> 00:54:34.890
but I actually really liked this one and I'm already,

986
00:54:34.891 --> 00:54:38.430
but I'm already moving on because I've got to drop all that fucking material and

987
00:54:38.431 --> 00:54:42.630
it's an hour of stuff that I no longer talk about.
You know?
That's a really fun,

988
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:45.990
it's fun to do.
I,
I get scared every time I do it.

989
00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:48.810
Every time I dropped my act and start all over again,
I get scared,

990
00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:53.810
but it's really fun.
What is it?
What is it called?
Contextually inadequate.
Yeah.

991
00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:57.570
Where'd that come from?
It was,
it was something about context.

992
00:54:57.571 --> 00:54:59.630
I had originally wanted to call it context,
not included,

993
00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:02.400
but I didn't like that as much and I just thought of like,

994
00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:05.350
it's like my greatest fear is to be an adequate,

995
00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:08.670
like I feel sexually inadequate all the time and contextually inadequate.

996
00:55:08.671 --> 00:55:11.460
I'm afraid that what I'm saying is meaningless.
So it just tied in.

997
00:55:11.461 --> 00:55:15.150
It just felt right because it's by two greatest fears.
So I put them together,

998
00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:17.520
made media under special.
I hope it's good.

999
00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:20.400
I know it's going to be good and Hilarious,
but I thank you.
But I like it.

1000
00:55:20.401 --> 00:55:20.690
Like he,

1001
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:24.510
a lot of times you shoot something normally you like in hindsight like I'll like

1002
00:55:24.511 --> 00:55:28.000
something I shot like a year later,
but um,
you know,
now I'm like,
yeah,
I'm,

1003
00:55:28.001 --> 00:55:30.180
I'm really happy with this.
I'm happy with the pace of it.
I'm happy with it.

1004
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:33.090
I talk about Cosby,
I talk about Anthony getting fired,
you know,

1005
00:55:33.091 --> 00:55:37.020
just a lot of shit that,
you know,
fell Hong knew that's,

1006
00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:39.780
that's so important because one of the things that happens,

1007
00:55:39.781 --> 00:55:41.430
a comics when they hold on their material,

1008
00:55:41.431 --> 00:55:46.170
two longs that they don't think like that anymore.
All the Peter Criss I do,

1009
00:55:46.171 --> 00:55:49.950
I have all four kiss solo albums as characters.
Oh,
that one just me,

1010
00:55:49.951 --> 00:55:52.050
I got age freely is chip.
I got fucking,

1011
00:55:52.051 --> 00:55:54.870
one of them is Edgar and one his uncle Paul.
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

1012
00:55:54.871 --> 00:55:58.110
And those are just all on the sabbath cover.
It was Collins.

1013
00:55:58.111 --> 00:56:01.100
I did cause you would've put yourself on album covers and I had this guy,
uh,

1014
00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.920
put me on all the black sabbath records and it's just,
you know,

1015
00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:07.560
every time you refresh the page is a different image.
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1016
00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:10.830
They just all just all sabbaths records.
That is hilarious.

1017
00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:11.880
I gotta do some more though.

1018
00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:16.140
Is that picture from the last one was that you with uh,
your,
uh,

1019
00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:19.920
when you had a nose operation?
Yeah,
that was just one of my many apnea photos.

1020
00:56:19.921 --> 00:56:23.830
My fucking fat face.
Even Though v I hate the way that,

1021
00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:28.030
that there's no,
no.
Um,
you know,
mozzies first record.
Wow.

1022
00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:32.020
This is pretty cool man.
And it feels like it's me.
It feels like it's my,
my,

1023
00:56:32.021 --> 00:56:34.700
it's Jim norton.com and it's just really like his money was,

1024
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:36.680
what I was going to say is,
um,

1025
00:56:36.970 --> 00:56:40.900
that for me at least doing new material is really important.

1026
00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:44.110
Like at the end of a cycle,
like,
so you've got a two year cycle.

1027
00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:46.420
For me it's like two years seems to be,

1028
00:56:46.421 --> 00:56:50.330
if I do a special every one year that it's just too rushed,
that I'm,

1029
00:56:50.331 --> 00:56:52.210
I'm not honing the material enough.

1030
00:56:52.211 --> 00:56:56.970
I'm not giving my perspective chance enough to grow on stage.
And it's like I'll,

1031
00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:01.450
I'll do way more than I need to in those two years and then I'll whittle it down

1032
00:57:01.451 --> 00:57:04.720
to what I really like when that time comes,
you know?

1033
00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:08.500
But then it forces me when I abandon it and start with new stuff,

1034
00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:11.860
my perspective is always refreshed.
I think as,

1035
00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:15.700
as a person you're constantly reevaluating things and looking at it and has a

1036
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:16.960
standup,
you kind of have to be,

1037
00:57:16.961 --> 00:57:19.720
you have to always be looking for what's funny about something.

1038
00:57:19.721 --> 00:57:23.170
What's interesting that changes and your material changes to,
you know,

1039
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:25.000
and fans have to realize too like,

1040
00:57:25.001 --> 00:57:28.660
you know I get so it's amazing like how much feedback you get.

1041
00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:32.920
That is exactly the opposite.
Like you'll get one guy will tweet or,
right,

1042
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:36.760
hey man,
fucking Nora and go stuff is a topical.
It doesn't hold up.
And then you,

1043
00:57:36.761 --> 00:57:40.900
the next person will say fucking enough with the trainee jokes in sex jokes.

1044
00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:44.020
It's like,
well make up your mind motherfuckers,
what do you want?

1045
00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:47.140
I can't do it for you.
I can only do like what feels right.

1046
00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:51.040
And the reason I do a lot of topical stuff is aid interests me and beats.

1047
00:57:51.041 --> 00:57:54.040
Like I talk on the radio every day.
That's what's on my mind.

1048
00:57:54.041 --> 00:57:56.440
It's like when you're fucking reading the paper every day and you're talking

1049
00:57:56.441 --> 00:57:59.740
about stuff every day you're formulating opinions because you're talking about

1050
00:57:59.741 --> 00:58:00.860
something long form for,

1051
00:58:00.861 --> 00:58:04.510
it's six minutes or 10 minutes and then you just start getting an idea about it

1052
00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:08.140
and you create something and yeah,
but the people that are like really wacky,

1053
00:58:08.141 --> 00:58:09.010
hardcore fans,

1054
00:58:09.011 --> 00:58:11.920
they'd get upset if you talk about something on the radio and then that becomes

1055
00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:16.760
a bit,
yeah,
talk about the on the roof.
We were newer.

1056
00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:20.620
They don't know what they want because the,
the,
the criticism is again,

1057
00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:23.470
50% say this,
50% say that.

1058
00:58:23.471 --> 00:58:26.770
I think it's even more than 50% say they like being in on the creative process.

1059
00:58:26.771 --> 00:58:28.330
Like,
oh,
I remember when you first brought that up,

1060
00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:31.330
but those are the people that are just looking to complain.
Yeah.

1061
00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:32.380
No matter what you do,

1062
00:58:32.381 --> 00:58:34.420
there's going to be some people that are just looking to be upset.

1063
00:58:34.421 --> 00:58:36.160
And there's some people that just want to get your attention.

1064
00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:38.110
They just want you to notice them.
They do.

1065
00:58:38.111 --> 00:58:41.470
And I actually wrote about that when Lindy West and I had that debate about rape

1066
00:58:41.471 --> 00:58:44.950
jokes afterwards I,
she was getting like a lot of rape comments,

1067
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.770
hope you raped and killed and you know,

1068
00:58:47.771 --> 00:58:50.680
she was wrote a big blog about how it was all this,
this rape threats.

1069
00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:53.590
And then I wrote something for Xo Jane,
which I,
you know,

1070
00:58:53.591 --> 00:58:56.050
I didn't think they would legit rape threats.
They would like,

1071
00:58:56.051 --> 00:58:58.570
if we've been talking about drunk driving,
I said people would have fucking run.

1072
00:58:58.571 --> 00:58:59.800
I hope you're killed by a drunk driver.

1073
00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:01.530
It's one of those things that people just want to be heard.

1074
00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:05.370
They want to say stole the worst thing they can say,
I hope you get raped.

1075
00:59:05.371 --> 00:59:06.290
It's pretty much the worst thing.

1076
00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:08.800
It's like walking into a room and just screaming really loud.
He goes,

1077
00:59:08.801 --> 00:59:12.700
what was that?
We noticed you let you get wanted.
Well,
you know what man,

1078
00:59:12.701 --> 00:59:15.580
there's always going to be people that are just looking to get upset and there's

1079
00:59:15.581 --> 00:59:18.040
always gonna be people that are looking to piss people off.

1080
00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:21.410
You know it was if they think they can push your buttons and trolls,

1081
00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:26.330
like anonymous trolls online,
taking them into account as an actual legit threat,

1082
00:59:26.331 --> 00:59:29.690
you have no idea what you're doing with it might be a legit threat,

1083
00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:33.050
but it also might be some 13 year old kid who's a dickhead.

1084
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:35.090
I think the majority of them,

1085
00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:38.600
this is what I love when they criticized material or they criticize what you're

1086
00:59:38.601 --> 00:59:41.450
doing,
whether we have been talking about opie and Anthony and a lot of people,

1087
00:59:41.451 --> 00:59:45.500
he's not be telling the truth like,
what do you want me to say?

1088
00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:47.870
What do you mean you're not telling the truth?
He's what?

1089
00:59:47.871 --> 00:59:51.950
A lot of a lot of these guys just want me to go on the radio and motherfuck Oop,

1090
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:53.690
and they think that's what's being honest.

1091
00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:55.400
They think that that's what I should do.

1092
00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:59.660
Meanwhile they're posting under anonymous names.
It's like you fucking cowards.

1093
01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:03.170
You fucking afraid for everybody to see who you really are.

1094
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:07.890
Cowards sitting in your house,
demanding other people do shit that you would,

1095
01:00:07.891 --> 01:00:10.760
you don't have the moral courage to say your name,
go fuck yourself.

1096
01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:14.510
But they think that's what honesty is like.
That's what they want.
And it's like,

1097
01:00:14.511 --> 01:00:17.480
if I don't give them that they instead of realize it may be,

1098
01:00:17.481 --> 01:00:21.370
that's not where the truth lies for me.
They think I'm not being honest.
Yeah,

1099
01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:24.820
but you're evaluating the minds of retards,
right.
Way To put it.

1100
01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:27.800
He's really dopey people for logic and reasoning.

1101
01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.340
There's just a bunch of people that are just content.
No matter what you do.

1102
01:00:31.341 --> 01:00:33.980
And if you really concentrate too much about what they're saying,

1103
01:00:33.981 --> 01:00:35.840
you're going to get crazy.
It's like you're,

1104
01:00:35.841 --> 01:00:38.030
you're taking in crazy input and this,

1105
01:00:38.031 --> 01:00:41.210
but there are times where they're right and then like with my standup or other

1106
01:00:41.211 --> 01:00:45.410
things and then criticized I,
and this is why they annoy me.
It's like,
it's like,

1107
01:00:45.411 --> 01:00:48.470
hey dummies.
I've actually given you guys credit when you're right.

1108
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:50.210
I've really meant it when I've said,

1109
01:00:50.211 --> 01:00:54.260
there are times when they say things that are really smart and intuitive and

1110
01:00:54.261 --> 01:00:57.980
they fucking nail.
One of my shitty habits or my verbal crutches or what a hand,

1111
01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.110
they make a lot of very valid points.

1112
01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:03.230
And then I'll read that they theorize something about the radio show and it's

1113
01:01:03.231 --> 01:01:05.800
like,
oh my God,
that I give you any,
it's way too much credit.
Well,

1114
01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:08.690
you see what you're saying.
The problem with what you're saying is they,

1115
01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.890
you're saying they as if they're all like one collective unit that has a vote

1116
01:01:12.891 --> 01:01:13.820
and that's your side.

1117
01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:17.210
And there's a bunch of fuck heads out there and there's a bunch of really cool

1118
01:01:17.211 --> 01:01:20.150
people out there too.
And sometimes the really cool people,

1119
01:01:20.151 --> 01:01:22.040
they disagree with you and they have a good point.

1120
01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:25.430
And there's just a way to do it where it's like,
you know,

1121
01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:28.160
I noticed that he relies on this a bit too much.
It gets,
uh,

1122
01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:31.760
it gets a tad tiresome or it gets really tiresome.

1123
01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:34.610
You could even say it gets really tiresome and maybe you don't like hearing that

1124
01:01:34.611 --> 01:01:37.160
it stings,
but maybe that's what you need to hear.

1125
01:01:37.161 --> 01:01:41.720
But there's a difference between that and someone has just a dummy who also gets

1126
01:01:41.721 --> 01:01:43.820
the same amount of voice.
Like you know,

1127
01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:47.210
you're on Twitter and someone's reaching out to you on Twitter.

1128
01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.220
If you read a dummy's words,

1129
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:52.610
you know he got to you just like the smart guy show it to you.
They all just,

1130
01:01:52.611 --> 01:01:55.250
they're all,
they're all receiving,
you're receiving,

1131
01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:59.000
although that data in your brain,
it's just,
you've got to decide like,
okay,

1132
01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:01.340
what kind of a person am I taking this advice from?

1133
01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:04.070
What kind of a person my receiving this criticism from?

1134
01:02:04.071 --> 01:02:08.330
Is he a fucking idiot or is this a cool person who just disagrees with me?

1135
01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.870
And there's two different types of people out there when it comes to things that

1136
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:17.090
are conflict.
There's cool people that you can get involved with,
conflicts with,

1137
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:20.070
where you work out each other's differences.
And then there's cots

1138
01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:24.540
<v 3>and that's the,
the fine art of anonymous internet interaction.</v>

1139
01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:28.410
Like you can be anonymous and still not be a cut.
I,
and that's the thing is that,

1140
01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:33.270
that's what irritates me about that culture.
It's like my,
the public email,

1141
01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:37.360
the real Jim Norton at Gmail is for people to contact me.
I'm not once,

1142
01:02:37.361 --> 01:02:41.460
have I ever gotten an email from somebody that was reasonable.
If it's nasty,

1143
01:02:41.461 --> 01:02:44.820
I'll answer you nasty or I'll ignore you.
But I've never gotten one that was,

1144
01:02:44.821 --> 01:02:47.040
you know,
and again guys,
not,
you guys had medication,

1145
01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:50.160
you fucking slow down with the eight paragraphs,
you know.

1146
01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:51.780
But if you send me an email,
go look,

1147
01:02:51.781 --> 01:02:54.090
this is what I don't like about the show and I feel you guys are doing this too

1148
01:02:54.091 --> 01:02:57.330
much.
I really do read it and I really do listen to what you say.

1149
01:02:57.331 --> 01:03:00.300
A lot of times I don't agree with it and there's times where I write you back,

1150
01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:04.140
but I'm not that irrational where somebody will be critical if just don't be a

1151
01:03:04.141 --> 01:03:07.140
dick.
Right?
Like you can't say to me like,
you know what I mean?

1152
01:03:07.141 --> 01:03:11.430
Fucking show stinks and an your content and then you don't respond.

1153
01:03:11.431 --> 01:03:13.590
And they go say he can't take criticism.

1154
01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:17.460
It's like we can not exactly being fucking,
you know,
you're not contacting me,

1155
01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:21.160
you know,
calling someone a cunt is not the act of a friend.
So you know,

1156
01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:24.420
you're not writing me an email and just go and look man.

1157
01:03:24.421 --> 01:03:29.421
I think you guys are disloyal to and has a lot of loyalty issues.

1158
01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:33.390
Yeah.
It's like how much more loyal,
what do you want me to be to Anthony?

1159
01:03:33.391 --> 01:03:35.640
Like I love Anthony.
Like how can I express to you?

1160
01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:39.270
Like that's not enough for them.
At first they were like,
well you know,

1161
01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.010
you're not saying you're loyal to Anthony.

1162
01:03:41.011 --> 01:03:43.530
I'm going to Anthony show and then that's not enough.
And like,

1163
01:03:43.531 --> 01:03:46.770
well it does it say he loves Anthony and goes on to show what would you like me

1164
01:03:46.771 --> 01:03:50.610
to do?
Anthony and I are fine with how we treat it.
Just like,
what do you want?

1165
01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:55.200
Sometimes I think that they just don't know what they want and I wish you would

1166
01:03:55.201 --> 01:03:58.740
express to me what you want.
Send me an email.
That makes sense.

1167
01:03:59.070 --> 01:04:02.700
Unmedicated and I really will read it and try to accommodate you like I do.

1168
01:04:02.701 --> 01:04:06.210
I do want the fucking fans happy.
They don't seem to get that.
It's like,

1169
01:04:06.211 --> 01:04:08.190
I really do like,
you know,

1170
01:04:08.191 --> 01:04:11.790
I stand out and meet everybody and I don't charge for fucking photos.

1171
01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:15.270
You do the same thing.
I've seen you do it.
How much more can I say to fans?

1172
01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:18.240
I appreciate what you do and I do appreciate your input.

1173
01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:22.350
Then standing there like a fucking dumb just bucket.
I don't charge for anything.

1174
01:04:22.351 --> 01:04:24.240
Most of you don't buy things on the way out.

1175
01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:26.710
And I always thank you for coming and like what are you want me to do is suck

1176
01:04:26.711 --> 01:04:30.930
your Dick in the parking lot with a gun there.
Most people are cool,
right?

1177
01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:35.520
So you're freaking out about a small percentage.
They used to just ignore.

1178
01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.440
I'm actually,
I might even freak out,
like I'm not even,

1179
01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.440
I'm a little hyper now cause I'm drinking this fucking gasoline you gave me.

1180
01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:44.550
It's very good.
Caveman coffee.
Delicious.
And uh,
but it does hype me up,

1181
01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:46.590
but I'm not even angry at them.

1182
01:04:46.591 --> 01:04:50.700
It's like some of them are really funny and somebody in the mean ones are really

1183
01:04:50.701 --> 01:04:53.490
funny dudes.
And it's a guide.
You're fucking,

1184
01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:57.270
you know more about the show then to be this dumb at this moment.

1185
01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:02.280
Like you know more about what we do and about our interactions with each other

1186
01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:05.400
and it'd be a dope at this moment,
but I'm not even that mad at them.

1187
01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:08.940
It's like some of them just are hilarious.
Well,
and it's also,

1188
01:05:08.941 --> 01:05:13.140
they're not realizing that you're just a person is for some reason when you

1189
01:05:13.141 --> 01:05:16.710
think of someone as being a famous community and I'm thinking I'm being way out

1190
01:05:16.711 --> 01:05:18.280
there and New York

1191
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:21.730
<v 0>or wherever the fuck they are at the moment you're tweeting at them and they're</v>

1192
01:05:21.731 --> 01:05:24.610
tweeting back.
Like that doesn't even seem real to a kid.

1193
01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:28.840
If you're an 18 year old kid and you're living in Cleveland and a year you get

1194
01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:31.000
on your iPhone and you're like,
fuck you,

1195
01:05:31.001 --> 01:05:33.940
you just bucket to you and then you're like,
fuck you,

1196
01:05:33.941 --> 01:05:35.350
I didn't say anything to you asshole.
You're like,

1197
01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:39.970
Jim Norton really tweet at me like they didn't,
doesn't even seem real.
I love,

1198
01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:42.400
I love Gail going back at them and having fun with them.

1199
01:05:42.401 --> 01:05:45.040
And I liked sometimes being a dick and then knowing that they're just going to

1200
01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:47.890
start fighting with other people and it's out of my hands.
It's kind of fun.
Well,

1201
01:05:47.891 --> 01:05:52.240
I do enjoy going to people's Twitter pages when they all day long or in

1202
01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:53.380
legitimate fights.

1203
01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:57.520
Like one of the things I noticed this group that likes to call themselves social

1204
01:05:57.521 --> 01:06:01.810
justice warriors or they get disparagingly referred to as social justice

1205
01:06:01.811 --> 01:06:05.230
warriors as a bunch of these people that I follow and some of them that even I'm

1206
01:06:05.231 --> 01:06:08.670
on a block list,
can't believe that I am too.

1207
01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:10.270
I think I know that list.

1208
01:06:10.271 --> 01:06:14.080
Somebody sent me that because you send out in Cindy Arie things and,
and,

1209
01:06:14.081 --> 01:06:17.360
and in and they're weak culture of I don't want to read what upsets me.
Yeah,

1210
01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:21.760
I mean jokes.
So No.
Yeah,
it jokes are bad for our culture.

1211
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.720
Um,

1212
01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:27.160
but my point being I like to go to their pages because some of them,

1213
01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:32.340
their entire like timeline is them fighting with people like in these horrible

1214
01:06:33.911 --> 01:06:38.911
like insult laden back and forth conversations and there's that old expression

1215
01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:43.270
that if you go outside and you run into an asshole,

1216
01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:45.340
you probably just ran into an asshole.

1217
01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:50.110
But if you go outside and everybody you meet is an Asshole,
it might be you,

1218
01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:52.890
right?
You're the common denominator.
It might be you.
Yeah.

1219
01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:56.740
Like give your Twitter feed is just constant complaining about everything in the

1220
01:06:56.741 --> 01:07:01.741
world and then arguments with people that are disagreeing with you that it end

1221
01:07:02.171 --> 01:07:06.220
up in horrible insults.
Like maybe it's you,
maybe it's you,

1222
01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:10.570
like maybe you don't realize you're transmitting a signal and that signal is

1223
01:07:10.571 --> 01:07:15.250
super conti and what you're getting back to super country data,
you know,

1224
01:07:15.251 --> 01:07:17.380
and you'd think it's the whole world.
The world sucks.
And Look,

1225
01:07:17.381 --> 01:07:22.040
I'm getting rape threats and I'm getting all these horrible harassment baby.

1226
01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:26.600
Maybe that's what's,
maybe you send out a real shitty flag.
You,

1227
01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:31.700
you fly a shitty flag and shit comes back your way and people respond to it and

1228
01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:33.280
in a shitty way and they don't like it.

1229
01:07:33.281 --> 01:07:37.390
Like if somebody insults you publicly and then you insult them back,

1230
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:40.150
they get all the stuff like what are you picking on me?

1231
01:07:40.151 --> 01:07:43.420
And it's like when Norton attack to blogger,
you're a heckler,

1232
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:47.350
you've heckled me online.
You had mentioned me.
So I see it.
You basically,

1233
01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:48.730
they will usually say like,
Jim,

1234
01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:52.270
I'd like to walk up to you and go fuck you and your face and then walk away

1235
01:07:52.271 --> 01:07:55.690
without you saying anything.
But what do you should,

1236
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:59.560
you should do that to your fans.
Yeah.
Let them say,
dude,

1237
01:07:59.561 --> 01:08:03.190
you don't even love your fans.
They are animals.
They really are good though.

1238
01:08:03.191 --> 01:08:05.320
But they're just the things they tolerate me saying,

1239
01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:09.910
I was on stage in Denver recently and the biggest response I got was doing chip

1240
01:08:09.911 --> 01:08:13.020
and uncle Paul.
I'm threatening them.
The lesson you're like reminiscing about,

1241
01:08:13.021 --> 01:08:15.220
I always find a young guy and just talk about like,
yeah,
Hey,

1242
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:16.160
remember when you was

1243
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:16.851
<v 3>a baby?</v>

1244
01:08:16.851 --> 01:08:21.440
And they fucking love knowing that I'm going to talk about molesting this man.

1245
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:23.450
Well it's that character,
that code.

1246
01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:26.810
It's allows you to do things that are totally unacceptable.

1247
01:08:26.811 --> 01:08:28.750
Normally my favorite thing to do in the world,

1248
01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:33.510
there's nothing if I could literally doing chip and uncle Paul and I agree with

1249
01:08:33.511 --> 01:08:34.100
all that stuff.

1250
01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:38.240
It's so here's why it's so much fun cause it's like I know he's playing the bad

1251
01:08:38.241 --> 01:08:38.421
guy.

1252
01:08:38.421 --> 01:08:42.710
Like how many you get to explore that fucking horrible side of like when we're

1253
01:08:42.711 --> 01:08:45.170
doing a story about like a fucking priest or a molester.

1254
01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:49.040
Just to know that like uncle Paul can step in and go in any direction.

1255
01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:54.260
It's so much fun cause you know as a man you got to go on.
It's terrible.

1256
01:08:54.261 --> 01:08:57.770
That's wrong.
But that's not funny to say.
But it is to me.

1257
01:08:57.890 --> 01:09:01.550
How long has uncle Paul been around for?
Well he started,
uncle Paul started is,

1258
01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:04.580
I've been doing character for years in relationships long before I did them on

1259
01:09:04.581 --> 01:09:07.570
the radio,
I didn't to annoy my girlfriends and he'd be,

1260
01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.230
he was uncle Larry many years ago.

1261
01:09:09.231 --> 01:09:13.700
There was Roger Davis or Roger d and this is long before chip,

1262
01:09:13.701 --> 01:09:17.830
there was Roger and Roger had a brother Lester who was burned in a fire and

1263
01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:20.780
unless you've got a whole time like all storyline,

1264
01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:23.480
Lester was burned everywhere but his knees and his,

1265
01:09:23.481 --> 01:09:26.360
until he would always wear knickers to show off his legs.
It was a whole thing.

1266
01:09:26.361 --> 01:09:28.140
And Uncle Roger,
I know uncle,

1267
01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:33.160
uncle Larry and then it merged into chip who my girlfriend hated so much and

1268
01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:37.340
chip became the fucking cause they would chip,
would embarrass people.

1269
01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:40.250
I did had literally before I ever thought I'd do on the radio,

1270
01:09:40.730 --> 01:09:43.910
I would be out with girlfriends and embarrass them by doing that.
Like we,

1271
01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:47.210
I'll just be making bad jokes in the cab and my girlfriend,
I,
you know,

1272
01:09:47.230 --> 01:09:50.380
a Jen and even grow up and go home.
We just go,
just shut the fuck up.

1273
01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:51.920
It's not funny.

1274
01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:56.870
And it made me so happy.

1275
01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:01.580
And what's,
this is what would drive Jenny crazy.

1276
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:05.990
He'd be like a really nice steakhouse and the way it would come over and she

1277
01:10:05.991 --> 01:10:08.960
would order like the salmon and then chip just goes,
how much is that?

1278
01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:10.760
And would ask the way there and she was like,

1279
01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:15.080
do you know how humiliating it is that people think I fucked that guy.

1280
01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:17.600
People think I'm fucking this guy.

1281
01:10:19.730 --> 01:10:23.270
And that's where they come from.
That visceral reaction.

1282
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:28.220
It was real like I was who was doing one night that she all I would do,

1283
01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:29.730
I would,
do you know how I,

1284
01:10:29.770 --> 01:10:33.410
Edgar's one I don't do as much because Edgar is the moment that tiny mouth,

1285
01:10:33.411 --> 01:10:37.850
he just go room and decree knowers and that's his thing.

1286
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:43.370
But he had a brother Eugene and Eugene was always telling her that like,

1287
01:10:43.371 --> 01:10:45.530
you know,
you need to get right with Lord.

1288
01:10:45.531 --> 01:10:47.750
And he would always tell him she was garbage and a whore.

1289
01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:53.270
She was telling my girlfriend she was a whore and she was not worthy and crying.

1290
01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:56.720
I'm crying.
But I,
what happened was my girlfriend at the time,

1291
01:10:56.721 --> 01:10:59.060
who's now my best friend,
she,
my extra girlfriend from years ago,

1292
01:10:59.390 --> 01:11:02.540
she hated Eugene so much and I meet,

1293
01:11:02.541 --> 01:11:05.870
it wasn't even funny anymore and we would do it and she would dig her

1294
01:11:05.871 --> 01:11:07.040
fingernails into my face.

1295
01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:11.330
She dug her nails into my face cause I think Eugene had his spot.

1296
01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:17.460
It's true
and I'm,
I'm crying.
He would,
it was,

1297
01:11:17.461 --> 01:11:20.700
it was such a visceral reaction from her as I stopped doing Eugene,
who,

1298
01:11:20.701 --> 01:11:25.080
she caught me dirty texting with another girl.
She fucking,
I told you,

1299
01:11:25.150 --> 01:11:27.960
I only told us it wasn't even a girl.
I have a fuck.
It was just a girl.

1300
01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:31.830
I told you my dirty,
intriguing.
It was a girl.
I was like,
I'll pay you 500 baby.

1301
01:11:32.210 --> 01:11:34.080
I fucking,
I'm such an addict.

1302
01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:37.800
I would save my conversations to jerk off to write and I hit the wrong button by

1303
01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:41.910
button and I fucking printed it.
Dude,
I fucking printed it.

1304
01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:46.590
So she wakes me up one morning,
she goes,
Jim,
wake up.

1305
01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:47.880
And I knew I was in trouble.

1306
01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.850
So she found these things and she knew I hadn't fucked the girl,

1307
01:11:50.851 --> 01:11:52.650
but it was a real strain on the relationship.

1308
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:56.790
So as I swear to you as one of the ways of making amends to her,

1309
01:11:57.270 --> 01:12:02.100
I stopped doing Eugene.
I killed off Eugene Mellencamp because she,

1310
01:12:02.101 --> 01:12:06.570
cause I do a baby boy character named Jelly who she liked who's jelly.

1311
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:09.210
I don't do jelly published too embarrassed.
He's just a little boy.

1312
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:12.540
But she thought he was really cute and uncle Paul would always molest jelly.

1313
01:12:13.210 --> 01:12:15.900
Fucking and chip was so stupid.

1314
01:12:15.901 --> 01:12:18.610
Chip would always drop jelly off and uncle Paul's house.
No,

1315
01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:23.610
it was a whole fucking inner world.
Ah.
So Ah,
yeah,
chip would be like,

1316
01:12:23.611 --> 01:12:24.930
what if uncle Paul's a good guy,

1317
01:12:24.931 --> 01:12:28.470
he's helping out and she has so and she would do,
would drive a crazy,
so silly,

1318
01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:33.650
but it was just a fun way to be.
And uh,
she reacted so strongly.
So,
um,

1319
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:35.030
I,
I've said before,
I don't want it,

1320
01:12:35.031 --> 01:12:38.160
like I am animating them now and I'm in a point now with them where I haven't

1321
01:12:38.161 --> 01:12:40.290
introduced them.
We're working on it.

1322
01:12:40.710 --> 01:12:43.200
You're going to do an actual show with these pilots.
Oh yeah.

1323
01:12:43.201 --> 01:12:45.780
But this is after years of people telling me to do it.
Well you,

1324
01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:47.730
what are you going to do it on?
I don't know yet,

1325
01:12:47.731 --> 01:12:50.850
but it's going to be on something on Netflix.
I'm not,

1326
01:12:50.851 --> 01:12:52.500
they got bill Burke cartoon and they,

1327
01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:54.220
I don't think they're interested and I don't want to,

1328
01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:58.050
I want to do it online somewhere.
I don't think I'll be able to monetize it.

1329
01:12:58.090 --> 01:13:02.370
I have a six minute pilot.
I have a second five minute episode,
uh,

1330
01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:04.050
where the audio is all taped already.

1331
01:13:04.051 --> 01:13:06.120
And I'm looking at what they call animatronics now,

1332
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:11.130
which is to very basic animation.
It's like a storyboarding that moves.

1333
01:13:11.131 --> 01:13:14.260
So it doesn't really look like the characters,
but they have,

1334
01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:18.090
they're just showing you the motion they're going to be in and where they are.

1335
01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.090
But I got to see chips face animated.
I have,

1336
01:13:21.091 --> 01:13:23.910
I see what the character looks like and it's getting to where I'm happy with it.

1337
01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:26.710
You know,
cause again,
different levels of automation or it's expensive shit.

1338
01:13:26.711 --> 01:13:27.810
It's like two grand a minute.

1339
01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:31.170
So both of these things are costing me like 20 grand to do total,

1340
01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:32.790
which is all right.
That's not that bad.

1341
01:13:32.791 --> 01:13:34.980
If it's an investment and it's mine and I fucking own it,

1342
01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:37.650
but you know to get the animation,
that's amazing.

1343
01:13:37.651 --> 01:13:40.350
It's like five grand a minute and it's like I'm,
I'm not funding that mice.

1344
01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:42.690
So these are,
these are a fucking a,

1345
01:13:43.290 --> 01:13:47.130
it's a beginning and where it will go from here depends on how people respond to

1346
01:13:47.131 --> 01:13:49.380
it.
If they think it's funny and they like it,
they might go,
that's cool,

1347
01:13:49.381 --> 01:13:53.490
but we want this,
we want that.
But I really a,
I want to do something with it.

1348
01:13:53.490 --> 01:13:56.940
So I've gotten a lot of the characters in the first one and in the second one I

1349
01:13:56.941 --> 01:13:59.490
have a couple of the characters and I think people will like it.

1350
01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:02.340
But I literally just did it cause you have to years and years of people telling

1351
01:14:02.341 --> 01:14:05.970
me to do this stuff,
but it's the most fun I have on the road.
This is nothing.

1352
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.670
I can't listen to Jim Norton.
I really like it.
He was a kid.

1353
01:14:09.090 --> 01:14:11.200
I would always have like a these weird flake.

1354
01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:14.350
I would detach from Jim Norton and we would fantasize.

1355
01:14:14.410 --> 01:14:17.590
Like I had this little baby biz fantasy of me when I was five.

1356
01:14:17.591 --> 01:14:19.210
Me and Jimmy Robinson were friends.

1357
01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:22.090
Jimmy Robinson was a boy and a Cape who was me.

1358
01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:25.180
He was Jim Norton indicate but me and Jimmy Robinson hated Jimmy Norton.

1359
01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:28.780
Who is this weird separation between like,
I don't know who I was.

1360
01:14:28.781 --> 01:14:31.250
I was just this guy and I,
you know,

1361
01:14:31.251 --> 01:14:34.720
it was five or six and Jimmy Robinson was really cool and good looking and he

1362
01:14:34.721 --> 01:14:36.220
was five or six and then he looked like he was me.

1363
01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:39.850
But he wrote a tricycle and had a fucking Cape and we just Cim Norton,

1364
01:14:39.851 --> 01:14:43.600
which fucking Shit.
So I've always had this weird detachment.

1365
01:14:43.601 --> 01:14:46.960
So I don't like listening to myself any more than anybody else does right now on

1366
01:14:46.961 --> 01:14:48.610
coffee.
But I like watching,

1367
01:14:48.611 --> 01:14:50.560
I like listening to uncle Paul or chip cause they don't,

1368
01:14:50.710 --> 01:14:54.070
they don't sound like me.
So I'll go back and listen to fucking chip.

1369
01:14:54.071 --> 01:14:56.440
And I laughed like I've never heard it before cause I don't remember saying it.

1370
01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:58.600
I mean I remember doing it,
but I don't,

1371
01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.090
in those moments you're not fucking paying attention.

1372
01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:04.630
So in those moments you are really thinking like that guy.
Oh it's all,
yeah,
it's,

1373
01:15:04.631 --> 01:15:06.310
it's never thought through ever.

1374
01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.890
And I'll listen sometimes and remember it and I'll listen to it.

1375
01:15:08.891 --> 01:15:12.190
Like somebody who's like,
oh yeah,
no,
you really are thinking in that

1376
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:14.950
mindset but it's fine.

1377
01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:18.120
But it's fun to do and that's why I'm always interested like what?

1378
01:15:18.121 --> 01:15:19.990
I'm uncomfortable acting somewhere.
And again,

1379
01:15:19.991 --> 01:15:23.440
I know the different between standing with Clive Owen with a bunch of people

1380
01:15:23.441 --> 01:15:27.300
playing doctors,
that's a real situation.
So just talking to my fucking,
you know,

1381
01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:30.440
Dumbo fucking friends on the radio and Bob Kelly's there,
you know it,

1382
01:15:30.441 --> 01:15:31.690
there's no pressure with your buddies.

1383
01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:35.080
But it's almost like why is one so comfortable where there's,

1384
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:37.720
there's zero planning in it and it's just going to be,

1385
01:15:37.721 --> 01:15:40.210
you're talking about whatever you think of for five minutes and you know,

1386
01:15:40.211 --> 01:15:42.400
it has to be funny and you know,
it has to move the story along.

1387
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:44.740
Why is that not scary at all?

1388
01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:49.840
But this is so something is interfering or thing to kind of bring it back.

1389
01:15:49.841 --> 01:15:52.280
But that's the most fun I have is doing that shit.
That's it.

1390
01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:55.990
So you've been doing these characters like for a long time?
Yeah.

1391
01:15:55.991 --> 01:16:00.520
I brought him to the radio over time.
They became the radio over time,

1392
01:16:00.521 --> 01:16:02.740
but they were,
they existed long before radio.

1393
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.120
They existed in my personal life as just a fun way to be.
There's so many.

1394
01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:10.690
The one like my ex girlfriend was the best and got,
I'll see her tonight.

1395
01:16:10.691 --> 01:16:14.580
She's fucking awesome.
Um,
Jennifer,
I'd never given her name before,
but we,

1396
01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:17.170
I've talked to about,
her name is Jennifer Carmody and she has a podcast.

1397
01:16:17.171 --> 01:16:21.730
She's really a funny person and she,
um,
she's the one,

1398
01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:23.350
she fucked the characters.

1399
01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:28.420
Like she fucked chip and uncle Paul and Jane is hilarious and she,

1400
01:16:28.421 --> 01:16:29.170
ah,

1401
01:16:29.170 --> 01:16:32.890
she fucks suddenly suddenly was one I never done suddenly was one who was just

1402
01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:36.010
Dominique would drool a lot and he would lick the side of her face and her neck

1403
01:16:36.011 --> 01:16:38.620
and she hated.
Suddenly I,
he was kind of retarded,

1404
01:16:38.621 --> 01:16:41.050
but he never made it to the radio.
Some things don't translate.

1405
01:16:41.051 --> 01:16:42.610
They just thinks you're doing your personal life.

1406
01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.850
Tell me what kind of a cast or you have in your brain,

1407
01:16:45.851 --> 01:16:49.640
how many people are in there?
There was at one point with Jen and then Jen,

1408
01:16:49.690 --> 01:16:53.050
the reason she's working on this animation with me because literally her and my

1409
01:16:53.051 --> 01:16:56.200
manager Jonathan and club Soda Kenny have dealt with these people in their

1410
01:16:56.201 --> 01:16:58.960
personal lives more than any of you have ever heard them on the radio.

1411
01:16:59.470 --> 01:17:01.330
There wasn't one point with Jen.
There was,

1412
01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:05.380
of course it was chip and there was jelly and it was a Edgar Mellencamp and

1413
01:17:05.381 --> 01:17:09.860
Eugene Mellencamp and I did kill off Eugene.
There was,
um,
uncle Paul.

1414
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:15.140
There was,
she remembered,
uh,
Sheldon who was a,

1415
01:17:15.141 --> 01:17:18.830
there was another one called the Sushi kid who was just a guy who can't talk

1416
01:17:18.831 --> 01:17:21.110
like Ritzville Watch,
but like who she,
uh,

1417
01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:23.900
and talked all about Sushi Sushi kid.

1418
01:17:24.170 --> 01:17:27.020
And then it was fucking suddenly who drooled a lot and always go.

1419
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:30.050
But there was a lot of,
a lot of these characters had no depth to them.

1420
01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:32.030
And that's why I didn't bring them to the radio.

1421
01:17:32.031 --> 01:17:36.440
They were only funny contextually in the relationship cause Jen got them and I

1422
01:17:36.441 --> 01:17:40.460
got them.
So there was no,
they would be one trick ponies on the radio.
Uh,

1423
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:41.130
there'll be get all that.

1424
01:17:41.130 --> 01:17:44.570
He just felt like Jimmy [inaudible] and he would like lick her pussy bad or

1425
01:17:44.571 --> 01:17:48.470
liquor thighs,
which is closer out to,
there was no way to translate that.

1426
01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:51.930
So one night she fucked ship and uncle Paul and suddenly,

1427
01:17:51.931 --> 01:17:53.060
and she said chip was the worst.

1428
01:17:53.061 --> 01:17:55.910
Fuck what's always made me like she's uncle Paul was probably the best of the

1429
01:17:55.911 --> 01:17:58.600
three.
So while you're fucking there,
you're in these characters.

1430
01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:02.040
Only that time as a goof,
she suck chips.
Dick wants to chip.

1431
01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:07.700
Chip came in one time,
chip came in one time,
I said,
cool.
And he was like,

1432
01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:10.790
fucking Jedi.
Call my bomb like you've put,
Bobby was in Montreal,

1433
01:18:10.791 --> 01:18:13.550
I bombed at the festival and she felt bad.
She blue chip,
she was a fuck.

1434
01:18:13.551 --> 01:18:17.900
She was all areas.
Um,
and who else was there?

1435
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:22.340
There was fucking a,
at one point there's one called the gossip kid,

1436
01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:26.570
which I know he was black and I don't do him anymore.
Yay.

1437
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:28.190
He was just the one that would kind of sum up.

1438
01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:32.360
He almost worked like it was not based on this cute way before I ever saw a

1439
01:18:32.361 --> 01:18:35.600
fucking,
they,
uh,
we were Harold Perrineau when he did Oz,

1440
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:37.670
the guy in the wheelchair,
the black guy.
We kind of narrate.

1441
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:41.000
That's what the gossip kid did.
He would just narrate,
you know,
like,

1442
01:18:41.001 --> 01:18:42.380
you know what I mean?
I heard Uncle Paul,
you know,

1443
01:18:42.381 --> 01:18:45.800
I heard a bit stuck uncle Paul's Dick.
It was like that and she made her laugh.

1444
01:18:46.230 --> 01:18:48.170
The gossip kid was one of the favorites we would do.

1445
01:18:48.171 --> 01:18:52.400
But then our relationship ended years ago,
so I don't do the gossip kid anymore,

1446
01:18:52.670 --> 01:18:54.740
but the gossip kid with some,
the characters.

1447
01:18:57.870 --> 01:19:02.090
Oh my God.
That's hilarious.
That's what I'm going to do too.

1448
01:19:02.091 --> 01:19:03.440
I forgot about him until recently.

1449
01:19:03.441 --> 01:19:06.710
I started doing them again to another friend of mine actually.
He was like,

1450
01:19:06.711 --> 01:19:07.760
that's fucking funny.
Did.

1451
01:19:07.761 --> 01:19:11.780
He comes out on on the radio once in a while to he'll just do it like,
God,

1452
01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:14.800
people will always hit me.
Go,
who is that bitch?
And that's the,
that's that,

1453
01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:17.750
that's that character.
But I haven't gone into great depth with it.
Jimmy,

1454
01:19:17.751 --> 01:19:20.570
you need to do a podcast just by yourself.

1455
01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:25.130
Just by yourself talking to different guests.
Just you and a guest.

1456
01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:27.920
I don't know if it would be,
he wouldn't be fucking beautiful.

1457
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:32.300
People hear me so much on the radio.
Maybe if I didn't have radio.
Um,
I hear you.

1458
01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:33.740
You know what I mean?
People would get bored of me.

1459
01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:37.430
I think that they wouldn't get bored of you had a podcast.
I guarantee you,

1460
01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:40.370
you would reach a lot of people.
And even if you only did it once a week,

1461
01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:43.340
would it be a bad idea to have something in the back burner?

1462
01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:45.980
Who the fuck knows what's going to happen with series?
That's true.
I mean,

1463
01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:48.800
they're doing well right now,
but the Internet is a strange thing.

1464
01:19:49.010 --> 01:19:52.490
The Internet is going to be in cars.
It's going to happen within the next decade,

1465
01:19:52.491 --> 01:19:53.450
within the next decade.

1466
01:19:53.451 --> 01:19:56.720
It's going to be real hard to justify paying for satellite radio cause there's

1467
01:19:56.721 --> 01:19:57.320
going to be some,

1468
01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:00.410
someone's going to figure out programs that you could do that mimics satellite

1469
01:20:00.411 --> 01:20:04.370
radio and they become native apps on your car whether we talked about it before,

1470
01:20:04.371 --> 01:20:07.830
whether it's Pandora or some new thing that we even know where

1471
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.350
<v 1>they have that stitcher app now on your,
your car.</v>

1472
01:20:10.351 --> 01:20:15.351
A lot of Ford cars where you can download podcasts directly from the thing you

1473
01:20:15.541 --> 01:20:18.270
have favorites,
you save them so you can have like,

1474
01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:21.330
like stations that you could click on,
you can go to different podcasts.

1475
01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:25.650
All that stuff is,
you know,
it's going to be hard to compete with that.
Yeah,

1476
01:20:25.651 --> 01:20:28.080
I think you're right and I think he had less than a decade,
I think.

1477
01:20:28.081 --> 01:20:31.020
I think it'd be a lot sooner than that before the cars have it.
No,

1478
01:20:31.021 --> 01:20:32.400
they definitely going to have it less than a decade.

1479
01:20:32.401 --> 01:20:35.540
But I mean like how much more time to seriously like I like serious.
I liked.

1480
01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:39.780
I like switching to the channels and listening to different music or listening

1481
01:20:39.781 --> 01:20:44.080
to Howard.
Then listening to you guys and listening to a,
I listened to two.
Um,

1482
01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:47.930
it's Ron and Ron and Fez,
good shows and uh,

1483
01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:49.950
there's a bunch of different things you can listen to.

1484
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:54.150
There's a lot of different classic vinyl station to play.
Cool music.
You know.

1485
01:20:54.330 --> 01:20:57.480
Ozzy's boneyard is my favorite station anywhere.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1486
01:20:57.481 --> 01:21:00.930
There's some great law.
What does it last tracks?
What does that one,

1487
01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:05.370
there's deep tracks.
Deep tracks is like real obscure songs.

1488
01:21:05.371 --> 01:21:07.770
Hope he likes that one a lot too.
Yeah.

1489
01:21:07.850 --> 01:21:11.040
I think he probably goes more deeper music than I do.
I,
I don't,
I don't listen,

1490
01:21:11.041 --> 01:21:12.200
I don't listen to most of the mutation.

1491
01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:15.030
She said Ozzy's boneyard and occasionally hairnation I'll listen to it a 70

1492
01:21:15.031 --> 01:21:18.240
channel.
But like when you,
when you really think about it,

1493
01:21:18.810 --> 01:21:22.740
the benefit of the Internet is a bunch.

1494
01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.000
There's a bunch of different benefits.

1495
01:21:24.170 --> 01:21:27.510
But one of the big ones is you can be anywhere.
You could be in a parking garage.

1496
01:21:27.511 --> 01:21:29.850
Like it's really annoying when you're listening to a good show.

1497
01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:33.440
And then you'd go into a tunnel and it stops because your satellite connections

1498
01:21:33.450 --> 01:21:34.170
count.

1499
01:21:34.170 --> 01:21:38.940
But with cellular connections you can get a cellular connection way more places.

1500
01:21:39.090 --> 01:21:40.950
You can get a cellular connection underground,

1501
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:42.920
you can get it in parking lot structures.

1502
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:45.450
You're getting a lot of different places that you can't get radio.

1503
01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:49.710
And also like what I was driving on Topanga Canyon yesterday and a fucking sunny

1504
01:21:49.711 --> 01:21:54.030
day and satellite was cut now.
Oh really?
Yeah,
it's just trees.
Just the trees.

1505
01:21:54.031 --> 01:21:56.540
Like there's areas of Topanga where you're,

1506
01:21:56.550 --> 01:22:00.150
you're driving through the canyon and there's just this canopy of trees overhead

1507
01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:03.500
and it just blocks out the satellite.
That's Piss real quick.
I gotta I guess.

1508
01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:08.210
Definitely I'll be right back.
And let's promote Jimmy's special.
That is on Epix,

1509
01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:12.240
uh,
coming up real soon.
[inaudible] um,

1510
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:13.770
contextually inadequate.

1511
01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:18.980
April 24th on Epix and epics is the same network that was airing deep web on May

1512
01:22:21.630 --> 01:22:22.490
31st,
which is,
uh,

1513
01:22:22.830 --> 01:22:27.630
our friend Alex winter who was here yesterday or the day before yesterday and a,

1514
01:22:27.631 --> 01:22:32.070
so epics is doing some fucking cool shit and Jim has already done one special on

1515
01:22:32.071 --> 01:22:36.000
epics already.
So this'll be his a second special on,

1516
01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:42.360
uh,
everybody asks you about tonight at the uh,
ice house is sold out,
sorry,

1517
01:22:42.361 --> 01:22:43.194
pitches.

1518
01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:48.240
And then the next gig that we have that's a big one is in New York that's sold

1519
01:22:48.241 --> 01:22:50.640
out too.
That's up the,

1520
01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:55.370
<v 4>what is it called?
Um,
what's the name of that joint?</v>

1521
01:22:56.900 --> 01:22:57.733
What is it?

1522
01:22:58.570 --> 01:23:02.290
<v 1>The grand ballroom.
The grand ballroom ballroom in New York City.</v>

1523
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:07.450
So the next gig that I had that's available that actually has tickets available

1524
01:23:07.451 --> 01:23:11.650
is the car theater at MGM.
And that's on the 22nd.

1525
01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:14.050
So that's a,
and then we'll,

1526
01:23:14.051 --> 01:23:16.930
we'll be doing some ice house shows in town between now and then.

1527
01:23:16.931 --> 01:23:19.510
And definitely the comedy store.
And one of the things we started doing it,

1528
01:23:19.511 --> 01:23:23.800
the comic stores,
that belly room.
Have you done the belly room?
I've done the uh,

1529
01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:26.500
you know what maybe I have,
what's the,
what's the,
uh,
the one that everybody,

1530
01:23:26.530 --> 01:23:27.790
the original room in the other,

1531
01:23:27.791 --> 01:23:31.180
and I get it to the original room is the downstairs room that seats about,

1532
01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:34.870
I guess like one 50.
And the main room seats,

1533
01:23:35.050 --> 01:23:37.900
I think all full seats.
400 people.
I've never done it.

1534
01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:41.100
And then the belly room only seats like 80 or something like that.

1535
01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:45.010
It's a tiny ass room.
Like if you want to stuff people in there,
you might get 90.

1536
01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:49.150
And it's amazing.
I did it last night for this,
uh,
Jeremiah Watkins,

1537
01:23:49.151 --> 01:23:50.320
young kid out here has this,

1538
01:23:50.321 --> 01:23:54.610
a show that he used to do called Thunderpussy where it was like a podcast that

1539
01:23:54.611 --> 01:23:56.730
he did it,
but a lot of people didn't want to do it on a podcast.

1540
01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:58.180
I just want to do it on a regular show.

1541
01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:01.420
So they stopped doing it as a podcast and now maybe stopped.

1542
01:24:01.421 --> 01:24:04.660
I don't know if he'd stopped.
Yeah,
but he does.
He gives does both.

1543
01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:07.120
But stand up on the spot is what they call it in someone.

1544
01:24:07.150 --> 01:24:11.080
The people yell out topics and you're forced to make jokes or make fun of them.

1545
01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:14.380
Oh Wow.
Cool.
And everybody knows that's what it is.

1546
01:24:14.530 --> 01:24:17.060
So they know you might stumble a little bit and it might be you,

1547
01:24:17.070 --> 01:24:19.270
you're going to have subjects that you just don't have anything.
Oh,

1548
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:21.550
that's awesome.
But you're forced into that situation.

1549
01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:25.180
We're trying to make comedy and I've come up with a bunch of bids because of it,

1550
01:24:25.181 --> 01:24:28.420
because we've done it like three or four times now and you come up with like,

1551
01:24:28.421 --> 01:24:31.540
you know,
you might do 15 minutes,
you might get three minutes out of it.

1552
01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:34.480
We're like,
wow,
this is actually got potential.
Hope they're good topics,
girl,

1553
01:24:34.481 --> 01:24:37.740
Fort Shaw,
get out of my way.
There's a lot of that.
What does,

1554
01:24:37.741 --> 01:24:42.460
what's a really hard,
when it,
they throw out,
uh,
economics.
Oh boy.

1555
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:46.660
Yeah.
Someone,
someone yelled out,
space travel,
you know,
economic space travel.

1556
01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:50.680
This is,
but you're always going to have like,
you know,
they don't know who knows?

1557
01:24:50.710 --> 01:24:53.080
You might,
you might like in that moment,

1558
01:24:53.170 --> 01:24:56.140
like someone could yell out economics and you have nothing,

1559
01:24:56.170 --> 01:25:00.160
or you can be in the right frame of mind at the right moment and you just have

1560
01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:03.700
this idea and then you just run with it on stage and people start laughing

1561
01:25:03.701 --> 01:25:07.480
hilariously hysterically and you're like,
oh,
there is something in that.

1562
01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:08.380
I didn't even consider that.

1563
01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:12.520
But you're forced into this like you're forced to to run,

1564
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:14.460
you're forced to figure out how to run.
Right,
right,
right.

1565
01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:16.870
Forced to figure out how to swim.
You just thrown into the water.

1566
01:25:16.990 --> 01:25:21.340
You figure it out.
I liked that.
I did one similar that Paul Provenza has one.

1567
01:25:21.341 --> 01:25:21.560
It was,

1568
01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:25.690
it was always his call list set list and there was some really hard weird things

1569
01:25:25.691 --> 01:25:29.290
on there,
but that was kind of fun to go up there and just explore it and see,

1570
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:33.460
see where you go with it and where your mind works and that's really fun shit to

1571
01:25:33.461 --> 01:25:34.900
do.
Yeah,
it's fun.

1572
01:25:34.901 --> 01:25:39.190
It's a good way to start new material to like just to get the beginnings of a

1573
01:25:39.191 --> 01:25:42.670
new bit or the idea of a new bit like you've got to trick yourself.

1574
01:25:42.671 --> 01:25:45.910
I think Ari and I were talking about this once.
If you do too many gigs,

1575
01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:50.560
if you don't live your life enough,
absolutely right,
like sometimes you just,

1576
01:25:50.561 --> 01:25:54.500
you have too much,
too much gigs and not enough life,
nothing to fetal.

1577
01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:58.990
If a bear was saying that the same thing.
Actually bear was saying that,
you know,

1578
01:25:58.991 --> 01:26:02.170
sometimes he needs to do things and that's why I think he got in the helicopter

1579
01:26:02.171 --> 01:26:03.980
flying and he actually was doing

1580
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:06.230
<v 0>a bit on helicopter flying.
He's decided,</v>

1581
01:26:06.231 --> 01:26:08.600
well I'll fucking actually take some lessons.

1582
01:26:08.601 --> 01:26:11.660
And then in taking glasses he actually want to be enjoying it.
Well that's,

1583
01:26:11.661 --> 01:26:11.811
you know,

1584
01:26:11.811 --> 01:26:14.570
it's funny you say that because that's another part of me not wanting to be such

1585
01:26:14.571 --> 01:26:17.720
a piece of shit any more sexually because you,
you,
you be,

1586
01:26:17.721 --> 01:26:21.290
you feed on only the same thing and there's nothing new coming into my life.

1587
01:26:21.291 --> 01:26:23.930
There's no new input.
So there's stuff I talked about on the radio,

1588
01:26:23.931 --> 01:26:26.210
which is topical and then there's that and it's like,
no man,

1589
01:26:26.211 --> 01:26:30.260
it's a whole life out there that you're not enjoying and living.
And you know,

1590
01:26:30.261 --> 01:26:32.900
again,
I'm not crying the blues.
I make good money.
I have a nice apart,

1591
01:26:32.901 --> 01:26:34.370
like I've been very lucky in comedy,

1592
01:26:34.371 --> 01:26:37.250
but it's like there's so many fun things to do.
Like,

1593
01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:41.600
just go out with someone somewhere without a goal of sexual whatever,
or just,

1594
01:26:41.601 --> 01:26:41.841
you know,

1595
01:26:41.841 --> 01:26:44.900
go away for the night to a little dumb town and go shopping or just do some

1596
01:26:44.901 --> 01:26:47.750
fucking dumped shit that people do.
That's fun.

1597
01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:51.980
That's relaxing and normal and normal human beings do not be itching,

1598
01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:55.490
not be edging it fucking hours.
Dude,
I'm telling you,

1599
01:26:55.700 --> 01:27:00.590
it fucks me up so much.
It's like,
it's like this weird,
uncomfortable,

1600
01:27:00.591 --> 01:27:02.210
scared feeling I get when I'm done too.

1601
01:27:02.211 --> 01:27:06.860
Like I get very scared like I'm exposed man.
You know what I mean?
Like,

1602
01:27:06.861 --> 01:27:09.310
Oh God,
she's married a fucking husbands going to find out.

1603
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:13.100
I talked to that girl to jerk me off.
I gave him a 500 man,

1604
01:27:13.101 --> 01:27:16.070
but a fucking husbands going to shoot me if he finds out like [inaudible] you

1605
01:27:16.071 --> 01:27:20.120
like that I do in a moment,
but as soon as you come,
boy you stopped liking it.

1606
01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:23.900
You know what I mean?
Oh God,
this is fun.
I'm going to get killed.

1607
01:27:25.690 --> 01:27:26.070
It's really,

1608
01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:28.700
I'll fucking load coming out really brings you right back to reality.

1609
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:32.100
Isn't it funny though,
that part of being like a funny guy.

1610
01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:33.580
I like the way you are is,

1611
01:27:33.710 --> 01:27:36.830
is dependent upon like impulsive behavior and thoughts.

1612
01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:42.110
Like there's something about like the actual creation of a bit like an Improv

1613
01:27:42.111 --> 01:27:46.190
line,
a hilarious Improv line.
A lot of that is like impulsive things.
Sure.

1614
01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:47.690
Yeah.

1615
01:27:47.690 --> 01:27:50.360
It's somebody will yell something or you just think of something you say it.

1616
01:27:50.361 --> 01:27:53.450
Even though if you thought it through,
you might not say it,
will you tweet it?

1617
01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:56.120
Which is why guys get in trouble.
Um,
you know what I mean?

1618
01:27:56.121 --> 01:27:56.761
It is that you're right,

1619
01:27:56.761 --> 01:28:00.050
that impulsive thinking that this is the thing that makes you great is also the

1620
01:28:00.051 --> 01:28:01.160
thing that will eventually ruined you.

1621
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:05.570
My favorite tweet that someone should never done is that woman who was working

1622
01:28:05.571 --> 01:28:08.270
for some publicity firm or something like that and she flew to Africa.

1623
01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:12.440
I'm sure it's just like on my way to Africa.
Hope I don't get aids.
Just kidding.

1624
01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:14.570
I'm white,
lol.

1625
01:28:14.810 --> 01:28:19.810
And then she lands and it's a national fucking scandal and she lost her job.

1626
01:28:19.821 --> 01:28:20.450
I mean,

1627
01:28:20.450 --> 01:28:25.070
what are the odds that anyone's going to read that tweet and decide to like go

1628
01:28:25.071 --> 01:28:28.070
after you?
You know what it is.
They were like,
Hey let's get this publicist.

1629
01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:32.240
But what she was saying Justine Sacco and at least a stupid thing to say,

1630
01:28:32.241 --> 01:28:35.650
but what she's probably saying is,
hey,
white people like it.

1631
01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:39.980
So sometimes there might even be a statement about how it's unfair that only the

1632
01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:40.610
black guys are,

1633
01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:43.400
I don't think she meant like fuck black people or do you think she did?

1634
01:28:43.401 --> 01:28:45.980
I don't know.
I think she was just trying to be funny.
Maybe.

1635
01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:49.280
I think she just saw it choose being funny going to Africa.

1636
01:28:49.281 --> 01:28:51.290
Hope I don't get aids.
Just kidding.
I'm white.

1637
01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:54.150
I think she was just being an asshole just shouldn't be.

1638
01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:57.020
I mean I don't mean an asshole in a bad way,
but you're funny.
Yeah.
Funny.
Yeah.

1639
01:28:57.021 --> 01:29:00.020
Being goofy and just being an ass.
Well that's something that a comic would say.

1640
01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:02.280
I mean tell me a colic wouldn't say that.

1641
01:29:02.850 --> 01:29:06.690
Absolutely lot of comics would say that.
The thing is that they're getting,

1642
01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:08.550
I've had a wide,
a weird thing too,

1643
01:29:08.551 --> 01:29:09.870
cause you're not people getting fired for tweets.

1644
01:29:09.871 --> 01:29:13.740
And it uprooted our radio show obviously.
Um,
you know,

1645
01:29:13.741 --> 01:29:15.420
it's very frustrating and it's stupid.

1646
01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:18.570
But then I hear these guys who sent these tweets to,

1647
01:29:18.571 --> 01:29:21.960
to a curt Schilling's daughter was curt Schilling,

1648
01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:25.110
the pitcher and those a big,
it was a red sox pitcher.
He pitched,

1649
01:29:25.111 --> 01:29:27.980
he had the bloody sock and he tweeted something about his daughter,

1650
01:29:27.981 --> 01:29:32.790
a pitching in a college game.
So these anonymous,
these fucking cowards,

1651
01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:36.830
they tweet this stuff about his daughter that's really nasty.
And some of it,

1652
01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:39.780
he said it might've been illegal because it was sexual stuff too.
I don't know.

1653
01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:41.750
But they both were up there.

1654
01:29:41.790 --> 01:29:44.790
They found out who they were and they were both fired from their jobs or one
was,

1655
01:29:44.791 --> 01:29:47.010
and I was happy that they got fired because I didn't like them.

1656
01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:50.610
But I had a real dilemma because the emotional part of me is like,

1657
01:29:50.611 --> 01:29:52.050
good fuck these scumbags.

1658
01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:56.250
And then the other part of me is you shouldn't be firing people because they say

1659
01:29:56.251 --> 01:30:00.360
dumb shit.
But then I'm like,
okay,
say you were a doctor and you tweet,

1660
01:30:00.630 --> 01:30:03.600
I hate Jews.
Like there's the hospital and I have the right to go.

1661
01:30:03.601 --> 01:30:04.770
We don't want you working for us.

1662
01:30:04.771 --> 01:30:08.150
Are Jewish clientele would legitimately not feel comfortable having you operate

1663
01:30:08.151 --> 01:30:11.460
on like I'm just kind of in a quandary about it cause I don't know how to feel

1664
01:30:11.461 --> 01:30:14.520
about any of it.
No.
Like I'm such a,
I'm always like,

1665
01:30:14.521 --> 01:30:17.250
whatever you say you shouldn't get in trouble for.
Uh,

1666
01:30:17.251 --> 01:30:18.780
I mean there is a penalty to speak,

1667
01:30:18.781 --> 01:30:22.190
but you shouldn't get fired for doing dumb jokes.
But what if you were,

1668
01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.670
say if you're working with a guy,

1669
01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:27.840
like say you're in an office and the guy shares the office is a small amount of

1670
01:30:27.841 --> 01:30:28.111
people.

1671
01:30:28.111 --> 01:30:31.530
There's like three or four people in the office and you guys work in and out

1672
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:33.240
together day in,
day out.

1673
01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:38.540
And one of you you find out is sending really mean tweets to a baseball player's

1674
01:30:38.761 --> 01:30:42.450
daughter.
Really evil,
vicious shit for no reason.

1675
01:30:42.690 --> 01:30:45.510
Like just an asshole doesn't know the girl.
He's just an asshole.

1676
01:30:45.690 --> 01:30:48.210
Why the fuck would you want to work with that?
Right,
that's the truth.

1677
01:30:48.211 --> 01:30:49.500
So why can't you find that guy?

1678
01:30:49.501 --> 01:30:53.280
Because that guy is negative to the environment of the office because this is,

1679
01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:57.070
and,
and I like,
I'm happy he got fired again emotionally.
Right.
But,
but,

1680
01:30:57.071 --> 01:31:00.060
but the part of me that contradicts that is going.
Yeah.
But yeah,

1681
01:31:00.061 --> 01:31:02.460
that was an obvious one.
All right.
The guy was a con,

1682
01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:06.450
but then there's the ones where people are just going for a joke.
Like that lady.

1683
01:31:06.510 --> 01:31:10.440
Yeah.
And then she gets fired.
So like who makes the determination?

1684
01:31:10.441 --> 01:31:13.800
Like that's what tries to be crazy.
I don't know how to feel about it.
Like I,
I,

1685
01:31:13.801 --> 01:31:16.950
we felt disloyal to my own point of view because I was so,
I was like,

1686
01:31:16.951 --> 01:31:21.030
fuck those guys.
You know?
And I'm,
I'm telling on myself by saying it.

1687
01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.850
But I mean like I,
I don't know,

1688
01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:26.100
I just had a bit of a dilemma with this one lately.
Well,

1689
01:31:26.101 --> 01:31:29.760
she was interviewed with a,
I forget what blog.

1690
01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:34.110
Excuse me.
I hate when I keep doing that until I get the same thing.

1691
01:31:34.290 --> 01:31:38.280
I sat the defendant fucking child rape child.
No,
I just want not.

1692
01:31:38.290 --> 01:31:41.400
I have it in there.
It's this,
yeah,
it's a coffee.
It's the butter.

1693
01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:45.420
So the butter in the coffee and she was talking about how it essentially

1694
01:31:45.450 --> 01:31:46.780
uprooted her entire life.

1695
01:31:46.781 --> 01:31:51.180
Like she landed in Africa and didn't even realize what was going on.
Slept,

1696
01:31:51.181 --> 01:31:54.270
you know,
probably took a sleeping pill.
It's a long flight.
Woke up,

1697
01:31:54.570 --> 01:31:56.730
didn't even realize what she had caused.

1698
01:31:56.940 --> 01:32:00.020
And then she had lost her job and people hated her.
They

1699
01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:00.340
<v 1>were,</v>

1700
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:04.000
people were having conversations about her on CNN and they were calling her a

1701
01:32:04.001 --> 01:32:07.030
piece of shit and it got ugly,
really ugly.

1702
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:10.690
And she kind of went into hiding and then she got a gig somewhere else.

1703
01:32:10.691 --> 01:32:14.260
I don't remember where her Gig is,
nor would I mentioned.
And if I do did know it,

1704
01:32:14.290 --> 01:32:18.130
but she,
you know,
she recovered,
she recovered and got back on track.

1705
01:32:18.131 --> 01:32:21.190
But she's made a careless joke.
She thought she was being funny.

1706
01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:24.080
She thought she was being silly and she didn't think that that many people are

1707
01:32:24.081 --> 01:32:25.540
gonna listen to it or read it.

1708
01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:29.230
And the intent in what she's doing is different than what those guys saying to

1709
01:32:29.231 --> 01:32:32.660
Kurt Shaklee.
But then there's the thing where you know,
supports guys,

1710
01:32:32.661 --> 01:32:34.390
you like you said,
you think they're immune.

1711
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:36.370
Like cause people yell stuff all the time.

1712
01:32:36.371 --> 01:32:40.810
It's sports figures fucking drop dead a Rod,
you suck.
You'd fucking,
it's like,

1713
01:32:41.710 --> 01:32:43.720
what's the like who's to say what's right?

1714
01:32:43.721 --> 01:32:45.400
And that's where I'm kind of just whatever,

1715
01:32:45.401 --> 01:32:46.590
I don't even know what I'm saying y'all.

1716
01:32:46.591 --> 01:32:48.840
I'm just kind of know it's confusing me a little bit.

1717
01:32:48.841 --> 01:32:50.170
And I think the sports guys,

1718
01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:55.620
if they're saying something that's absolutely mean and vicious and nasty and you

1719
01:32:55.811 --> 01:32:59.650
don't want them representing your organization.
So if you have an organization,

1720
01:32:59.651 --> 01:33:01.900
if you have a team or if you have ESPN,

1721
01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:05.980
it makes sense to me that people are getting fired for saying mean shit.

1722
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:08.020
But where is it?

1723
01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:13.240
It gets problematic when it's a difference of opinion and it's not necessarily a

1724
01:33:13.241 --> 01:33:16.570
mean insulting thing or a negative thing,

1725
01:33:16.690 --> 01:33:19.390
but it's a philosophical difference of opinion.
You know,

1726
01:33:19.391 --> 01:33:24.310
like sometimes people say things and although it's not smart,
what they said,

1727
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:27.370
what they said probably shouldn't get them fired,

1728
01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:30.310
just is a gray area when it comes to some of these things.
Well,

1729
01:33:30.311 --> 01:33:33.350
if everyone was honest,
I would say yeah,
but they're not.
What happens,

1730
01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:36.940
the guy like Trevor Noah does is tweet a few years ago and then they go back and

1731
01:33:36.941 --> 01:33:37.930
they know they're jokes,

1732
01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:41.290
but they lie and they go look at this hateful thing about Jews.
He doesn't like,

1733
01:33:41.291 --> 01:33:42.124
he's antisemitic.

1734
01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:45.880
So they take things that they know are men for jokes and they spin them into

1735
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.260
this was hate speech.

1736
01:33:47.710 --> 01:33:51.710
And it's almost like because there are such liars just to get a result that

1737
01:33:51.930 --> 01:33:54.000
that's where the confusing part comes in.
Because if,
if,

1738
01:33:54.001 --> 01:33:57.640
if it was just left alone yet,
it dilutes their opinion because then,
you know,

1739
01:33:57.650 --> 01:33:59.800
I'm not going to listen to anything you say.
If you say that is Joe,

1740
01:34:00.010 --> 01:34:02.860
like he had one joke,
she's 10 times the woman that she used to be.

1741
01:34:03.130 --> 01:34:06.790
So I guess she's fat now.
They're like,
oh,
she's,
he's fat shaming.
No,

1742
01:34:06.791 --> 01:34:09.100
he's making a joke.
Yes.
Yeah.

1743
01:34:09.101 --> 01:34:12.810
And what are you saying that someone has 10 times the size they used to be isn't

1744
01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:15.240
fat cause I'd say that's pretty fucking dishonest.
Sure.

1745
01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:17.170
Unless they weighed six pounds at one point.

1746
01:34:17.530 --> 01:34:22.080
This idea of fat shaming has been driving me fucking crazy.
Like it's not,

1747
01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:25.480
I like the fanny pack by the way.
Thank you very much.
Louis was really,

1748
01:34:25.490 --> 01:34:28.240
Louie wanted to spit in my face this morning when he saw it.
Dare he?

1749
01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:30.970
I know he's got a fanny pack.
I have one for you if you want one.

1750
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.980
I think you get a new one.
I have one of yours too.
Yeah,

1751
01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:37.660
I like a good fanny pack so I do as well.
I forgot what I said.
I got all excited.

1752
01:34:37.661 --> 01:34:40.390
You're talking about fat shaming.
Yeah,
I mean look man,

1753
01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:43.240
it's not cool to be mean to people.

1754
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:45.490
It's not cool to like point someone out and be mean to him,

1755
01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:50.170
but it's not smart to just let it go either.

1756
01:34:50.410 --> 01:34:55.020
It's not smart to just not ever talk about someone's weight like you.

1757
01:34:55.021 --> 01:34:56.440
If you care about someone,

1758
01:34:56.441 --> 01:34:59.480
you should probably bring up the fact that they're morbidly obese.

1759
01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:03.800
If you could bring it up and have them realize that there's other options out

1760
01:35:03.801 --> 01:35:06.290
there and they change their,
their habits,
that's not,

1761
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:08.390
that's not necessarily fat shaming.

1762
01:35:08.530 --> 01:35:12.560
If we're all ignoring fat people or ignoring people that have eating problems,

1763
01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:17.230
we're going to ignore like a,
a serious health problem.
That's,
that's,
uh,

1764
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:20.680
that's as much of an addiction as what you were talking about.
What about sex?

1765
01:35:20.681 --> 01:35:23.570
Sure.
It's the same sort of thing.
They get in their head,

1766
01:35:23.571 --> 01:35:27.530
they get sweaty thinking about ring dings and Ho hos and cakes and Burgers,

1767
01:35:27.531 --> 01:35:32.330
and it's just a fucking sheer joy of gluttony given into it.
Yeah.

1768
01:35:32.331 --> 01:35:34.310
Bring things are fucking awesome though.
I gotta be honest.

1769
01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:37.070
I have friends that have a food,
food addictions,
and I've been around them.

1770
01:35:37.071 --> 01:35:40.400
When they satisfy those addictions,
it's like you're watching the lions eat.

1771
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:44.000
It's the hardest.
It's the hardest of all the food.
Fucking brutal,
man.
You gotta,

1772
01:35:44.001 --> 01:35:48.380
you gotta eat.
You have to eat right.
Exactly.
It,
you don't have to go to hookers.

1773
01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:52.100
Right.
Some of us do Joe,
but you know what I'm saying?
You don't like,

1774
01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:55.880
you'll live if you don't get a hooker,
you won't live if you don't eat right.

1775
01:35:55.881 --> 01:35:56.750
You have to eat.

1776
01:35:57.110 --> 01:36:01.790
So he like constantly dive the dancing in and out of this world that they're

1777
01:36:01.791 --> 01:36:06.170
addicted to very hard.
It's like you can't not do it.
Well I'm eating healthy.

1778
01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:09.800
Like I dated this Gal wants back in the day who had a bit of a weight problem

1779
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:14.420
and she um,
she and I had a discussion about at once where I was like,

1780
01:36:14.830 --> 01:36:16.760
um,
I think that you,

1781
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:21.660
you put so much emphasis on this issue and it was a very minor weight problem.

1782
01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:26.010
And what she wasn't morbidly obese by anyone's definition.
Um,

1783
01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:28.680
but she did like would gain like a little 10 pounds here,

1784
01:36:28.681 --> 01:36:32.240
a little 20 pounds there and it bothered her and what bothered her was that it

1785
01:36:32.241 --> 01:36:35.360
would obsess her all day and she would talk about what she ate.

1786
01:36:35.361 --> 01:36:38.990
I had a fat free muffin ahead of this and I had of that and it became like

1787
01:36:38.991 --> 01:36:43.070
almost this and like this,
this battle that she could never,

1788
01:36:43.071 --> 01:36:46.250
when she was as crazy Yoyo that who she just,

1789
01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.320
she knew that she wasn't supposed to have the ice cream,

1790
01:36:48.321 --> 01:36:50.840
so she had to eat the ice cream,
you know,
and then whoa.

1791
01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:53.900
The way she fixed it is yoga.

1792
01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:59.920
She started doing yoga and the yoga somehow or another balanced her brain out

1793
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:05.950
and the effort of doing the yoga boosted her metabolism and she started eating

1794
01:37:06.981 --> 01:37:11.030
really healthy because she got more conscious of her body be instead of just

1795
01:37:11.031 --> 01:37:13.430
like she,
she had always exercise.
He was always like pretty fit,

1796
01:37:13.790 --> 01:37:16.790
but she just would do like running or lift a little ways or something like this.

1797
01:37:16.791 --> 01:37:21.791
But this got her into doing yoga and then she became like really obsessed with

1798
01:37:23.151 --> 01:37:26.450
eating healthy foods and taking care of her body and you know,

1799
01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:29.990
then she turned out great.
That's great.
Yeah,
she figured it out,

1800
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:32.840
which is cool when someone figures it out.
But,
but it was,

1801
01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:36.500
it was bizarre being in,
I've been next to friends,

1802
01:37:36.501 --> 01:37:41.300
like guy friends that have it,
but they just go in Hog wild and gluttony.

1803
01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:43.850
Well girls don't do that.
They kind of dance around it.

1804
01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:47.510
So their food addictions even weirder because like my friends that have food

1805
01:37:47.511 --> 01:37:50.690
addictions,
they'll indulge right in front of me,
you know,
like let's go,

1806
01:37:50.691 --> 01:37:52.700
you guys want to go to,
you know,
fill in the blank.

1807
01:37:52.701 --> 01:37:54.950
Let's go get some spaghetti and meatballs.
Fuck yeah.

1808
01:37:55.170 --> 01:37:58.590
And they sit down and then you seem indulging like,

1809
01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:00.350
oh this is fucking tremendous.
And you know,

1810
01:38:00.351 --> 01:38:02.790
they know they shouldn't be eating this but they're eating in any way.

1811
01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:05.610
And it's hard to say something like,
you don't want to be the wet nurse.

1812
01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:06.750
But then it's like,
you know,

1813
01:38:06.751 --> 01:38:09.900
I'm 46 and my friends were in their forties it's like you can drop dead at this

1814
01:38:09.901 --> 01:38:13.230
point.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
You certainly can.
And have,

1815
01:38:13.530 --> 01:38:16.080
you know like already what worried me when he was in here,

1816
01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:19.700
I was like Jesus Christ and I was telling them about healthy foods and you know,

1817
01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:23.520
just got the pill thing to the heroin thing too.
And it's like,

1818
01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:26.340
God damn dude,
you're putting a lot of pressure on your heart.

1819
01:38:26.370 --> 01:38:28.990
How long ago did you have him?
Not long ago.
Okay.
He's,

1820
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.890
he looks like he's lost a few pounds.
Actually I saw him recently.
Yeah,

1821
01:38:31.891 --> 01:38:34.260
we get a Gig in Florida and as he looks a little thinner,
I'm like,

1822
01:38:34.261 --> 01:38:37.620
you make it an effort.
Funny.
Fuck.
Yeah,
he's really fucking funny.

1823
01:38:37.650 --> 01:38:41.160
He was so funny on the podcast talking about sports gambling,

1824
01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:45.360
which he's got a thing for just as bad as you ever think for said.
Oh really?

1825
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:49.860
He fucking loves gambling and he loves gambling and it's that same thing.

1826
01:38:49.861 --> 01:38:53.940
It's that,
that impulsive shit that comics tend to get.
We get,

1827
01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:57.060
there's like a lot of us get like,
we have real addiction problems.

1828
01:38:57.210 --> 01:38:59.850
The really funny ones,
like for whatever reason,

1829
01:38:59.851 --> 01:39:04.020
like I know a lot of guys that have either a sexual addiction or some sort of

1830
01:39:04.021 --> 01:39:07.440
drug addiction or a gambling addiction or some sort of addiction,

1831
01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:09.000
like it's a real common,

1832
01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:14.060
I know guys that have relationship addictions where their addiction is to be

1833
01:39:14.670 --> 01:39:18.870
constantly in conflict and the relationships and they never straightened it out

1834
01:39:19.110 --> 01:39:21.840
and they're always scared to be alone and they'll like scared,

1835
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:25.860
scared to lose a cow and then they fight like cats and dogs and they always,

1836
01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:28.980
I got to get away from her and then they never do and then there's aids.

1837
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:29.880
But what you're,

1838
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:34.140
what you're doing is the same sort of crazy thing that a food person does.

1839
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:38.580
Well you just back and forth and back and forth in that conflict becomes like

1840
01:39:38.581 --> 01:39:41.880
what you were talking about with the sex where you never see yourself,

1841
01:39:41.881 --> 01:39:45.060
you never see life.
You're looking at,
like you said,
through a window,

1842
01:39:45.061 --> 01:39:47.250
you never right there,
you never totally present.

1843
01:39:47.610 --> 01:39:49.620
You're always involved in this inner battle.

1844
01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:52.950
And that inner battle could be gambling,
it could be beaten off,

1845
01:39:53.070 --> 01:39:56.400
it could be going to hookers,
there could be doing drugs,
it could be drinking.

1846
01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:59.730
Whatever you're trying to not do becomes your thing.
It could be food,

1847
01:39:59.910 --> 01:40:02.910
whatever you're trying to not do becomes this wrestling match that you're

1848
01:40:02.911 --> 01:40:07.500
constantly engaged in all day.
And for me,
I had a,
I've had a bunch of them,

1849
01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:12.000
I've got a bunch of 'em um,
various games.
I've had a bunch of,

1850
01:40:12.001 --> 01:40:16.920
with video games,
with playing pool,
like real bad man where I,
you know,

1851
01:40:16.921 --> 01:40:18.570
with video games it was real bad.

1852
01:40:18.750 --> 01:40:21.210
Like I would be sitting there talking to somebody and I'd be like,

1853
01:40:21.211 --> 01:40:23.190
this is so much more boring than playing a video game.

1854
01:40:23.370 --> 01:40:24.900
I want to go play a video of them right now.

1855
01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:27.330
And I just wanted to get away and go play a video game.

1856
01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:32.370
And I would just go into my office and shut the door and just like finally put

1857
01:40:32.371 --> 01:40:34.980
the headphones on and then I would play.
And then I realized like,
wow,

1858
01:40:34.981 --> 01:40:38.750
this is like I'm in,
I'm doing,
I'm an addict here.
Adequate.

1859
01:40:38.850 --> 01:40:42.060
Like what's the long period of time?
Eight,
10 hours.
Wow.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1860
01:40:42.061 --> 01:40:46.320
12 sometimes I would do 12 I would do like six at night to six in the morning.

1861
01:40:46.350 --> 01:40:49.680
Easy.
Oh,
like fueled with a caffeine.

1862
01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:54.640
Australian girl had a heart attack.
I used to buy these sodas.

1863
01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:56.980
I forget the company that made them,

1864
01:40:56.981 --> 01:40:59.980
they were really cool and some of them were blue,

1865
01:40:59.981 --> 01:41:01.930
some of them had Jalapeno in them.

1866
01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:06.310
Some of them had like extreme amounts of caffeine and them and Guarana and all

1867
01:41:06.311 --> 01:41:10.120
these and they had like skulls and all these different weird artsy labels.

1868
01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:13.450
And there was this supermarket in north Hollywood that used to sell them down

1869
01:41:13.451 --> 01:41:17.080
the street from my apartment and I would go and I would buy them by the fucking

1870
01:41:17.081 --> 01:41:21.220
crate.
I would buy like everything they had when they would get new shipments in.

1871
01:41:21.250 --> 01:41:24.370
I even contacted the people that made the soft drink.

1872
01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:26.290
They had a warehouse in the factory and I said,

1873
01:41:26.291 --> 01:41:29.320
can I come to your warehouse and just buy some cases of your shit?

1874
01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:33.040
And it had like all sorts of different hot peppers in it and crazy,

1875
01:41:33.130 --> 01:41:37.570
but it was super caffeinated and I would drink this stuff and just play video

1876
01:41:37.571 --> 01:41:41.590
games just all night long.
Did you do it for,
that's the shit.
No,
that's not it.

1877
01:41:41.591 --> 01:41:45.010
Actually.
Green Apple,
Jalapenos,
soda.
Um,

1878
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:47.130
it looked a little bit like the stuff in the upper left hand.

1879
01:41:47.131 --> 01:41:48.370
There's a bunch of different ones,

1880
01:41:48.371 --> 01:41:52.740
but they had like skulls and all kinds of weird shit all over the um,

1881
01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:57.910
the uh,
the labels.
How many years ago is,
this isn't the nineties.
And how many,

1882
01:41:57.911 --> 01:41:59.560
how long did you do for a,

1883
01:41:59.561 --> 01:42:03.730
I think I quit video games altogether around 2000.

1884
01:42:04.030 --> 01:42:07.360
I think I realized I started playing like every now and again.

1885
01:42:07.630 --> 01:42:10.690
And like the early two thousands,
I would play like a little lever here and then,

1886
01:42:11.050 --> 01:42:13.870
but I didn't take,
I never,
I never got into it seriously again.

1887
01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:17.570
And then I completely stopped playing,
um,
around 2002 the graphics now.

1888
01:42:17.571 --> 01:42:20.980
And go like,
yeah,
I get scared.
Yeah,
it's still there.
It's,

1889
01:42:21.190 --> 01:42:23.650
here's the thing about it.
If you're a Gamer and you're like,
boom,

1890
01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:26.770
folks room with you,
you know you do do a lot.
You're right.

1891
01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:29.350
There's nothing wrong with playing video games.
They're fun as hell.

1892
01:42:29.650 --> 01:42:33.550
The problem is if you have some other stuff that you want to do in your life,

1893
01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:38.000
you got to know like what?
Like if I get addicted to Jujitsu,
here's a,

1894
01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:40.390
here's a perfect example.
I can't do Jujitsu,

1895
01:42:40.391 --> 01:42:42.880
but an hour and a half a day you get exhausted.

1896
01:42:43.150 --> 01:42:46.980
Like you keep your body just can't keep up.
You can't keep doing it like you,

1897
01:42:46.990 --> 01:42:50.110
there's only a certain amount of hours in a day that you could roll because

1898
01:42:50.111 --> 01:42:52.650
you're straining your fucking cardio and you're,

1899
01:42:53.010 --> 01:42:56.830
you're trying to survive and you're trying to kill and you're fucking constantly

1900
01:42:56.831 --> 01:42:59.710
moving and you're constantly trying to,
you know,

1901
01:42:59.711 --> 01:43:04.540
a better your position and defend and after a you're done,
you're done.

1902
01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:07.690
You can.
It's not like that with video games,
with video games,

1903
01:43:07.691 --> 01:43:11.470
if you're addicted to it,
you fucking can play eight,
10 hours a day.

1904
01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:15.670
It's not a problem if you get the right caffeine in you and you've got to write

1905
01:43:15.671 --> 01:43:17.230
the right kind of addictive game,

1906
01:43:17.231 --> 01:43:19.780
especially if you have friends and you're playing to get,
Luis said,

1907
01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:21.010
playboy land parties.

1908
01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:24.640
We used to get there and link all of our computers together.
Oh my God.

1909
01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:26.760
We'd be up for days.
People would just,
well we,

1910
01:43:26.810 --> 01:43:28.660
I would go to Houston and have gigs in Houston.

1911
01:43:28.661 --> 01:43:30.760
A lot of the guys would be from Houston.

1912
01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:35.320
We'd meet in Houston and we link up our computers together and we would play

1913
01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:40.380
four fucking hours and hours and hours and we'd come day after day.

1914
01:43:40.601 --> 01:43:43.510
Like we'd have like a two or three day thing where we'd all get together.

1915
01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:47.440
It's just burnout,
junk food,
chips,
mountain,

1916
01:43:47.441 --> 01:43:50.590
do whatever the fuck kind of caffeine you can get into your system.

1917
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:54.740
It's just too,
it's too fun.
It's a really fun thing to do.
Yeah.
But I,

1918
01:43:54.741 --> 01:43:58.570
I play asteroids.
When I was a kid,
I was very addicted.
Like I played every I,

1919
01:43:58.571 --> 01:44:02.100
but I'm that,
I'm that of that ilk,
so I never got into them as an adult.
Yeah.

1920
01:44:02.110 --> 01:44:05.690
Well,
I think they can get there but as a form of entertainment they're fucking

1921
01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:08.540
awesome and even better today than ever before.

1922
01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:11.510
You know it's funny cause I was in one of the grand theft auto and I had like a

1923
01:44:11.511 --> 01:44:15.050
little line or whatever and I tried playing it.
Laszlo,

1924
01:44:15.051 --> 01:44:18.890
this Guy Laszlo came into opie and Anthony and I kept,
I played that whole month.

1925
01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:22.580
I backed into the fence six times and said fuck this,

1926
01:44:22.910 --> 01:44:27.300
I am such an uncoordinated twat that I just couldn't make it work.
Thank I.

1927
01:44:27.301 --> 01:44:30.530
I literally look back on that and I go thank God you backed into the fence

1928
01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:31.430
because I live.

1929
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:34.730
I know that it would have been fun but once you figured out how to use the

1930
01:44:34.731 --> 01:44:38.480
controllers and a video game and you really do become like a part of the way you

1931
01:44:38.481 --> 01:44:40.310
move.
Like with quake,

1932
01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:44.870
every guy had like a script that he would run that he would load up like a

1933
01:44:44.871 --> 01:44:49.040
profile script for the speed of your mouse for the shape of your character for

1934
01:44:49.041 --> 01:44:50.690
your name and you can upload it.

1935
01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:54.260
Like you could have it as a text file on your computer and you upload it into

1936
01:44:54.261 --> 01:44:58.370
the game and then like that would be like your speed of your mouse.

1937
01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:00.710
Like some people like the mouse to move really fast.

1938
01:45:00.711 --> 01:45:02.540
Some people like the mouse to move really slow.

1939
01:45:02.690 --> 01:45:06.650
Some people like an extended view,
like your Pov could change,

1940
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:10.700
like your Pov could be they're 90 or one 27 guys are spread it out and they give

1941
01:45:10.701 --> 01:45:14.390
you like a fish eye lens and allow you to see more shit on your screen.

1942
01:45:14.630 --> 01:45:16.250
And some guys like that and some guys didn't,

1943
01:45:16.251 --> 01:45:21.251
but it was this thing that it became like really specific so that you got super

1944
01:45:21.381 --> 01:45:25.700
used to the amount of movement that you would do with your fingers and how that

1945
01:45:25.701 --> 01:45:28.730
would calculate into moving on screen and your brain's sinked up to it.

1946
01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:31.190
So then you didn't even think about moving your fingers.

1947
01:45:31.191 --> 01:45:34.370
It just automatically happen.
And when you're playing eight,
10 hours a day,

1948
01:45:34.371 --> 01:45:38.680
day after day after day,
it becomes like really become second nature.
Yeah.

1949
01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:41.240
Anthony's a big Gamer and he would always play on the computer.

1950
01:45:41.241 --> 01:45:44.510
He preferred that to Joyce and I never could understand playing on the computer

1951
01:45:44.511 --> 01:45:47.420
left right kit,
this key,
this key,
this guy,
I couldn't get it.

1952
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:49.610
Well the reason is when you use a mouse,

1953
01:45:49.790 --> 01:45:54.410
a mouse and a keyboard is the most accurate form of controller for video games.

1954
01:45:54.410 --> 01:45:58.700
So far like you can get a lot done with one of those x-box controllers but

1955
01:45:58.701 --> 01:46:02.870
you're never going to get the type of pinpoint accuracy in like a first person

1956
01:46:02.871 --> 01:46:06.200
shooter especially.
Oh you can with a mouse with a mouse.

1957
01:46:06.201 --> 01:46:10.070
You could turn around and like look at a guy like there's certain guys that

1958
01:46:10.071 --> 01:46:13.650
would play like there's this kid is to calm fatality.
He's calm himself.

1959
01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:15.040
Fatality and the uh,
the,

1960
01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:19.730
the I and fatality was like a number one and he is like a world champion quake

1961
01:46:19.731 --> 01:46:21.920
player.
And when you would watch him play,

1962
01:46:22.130 --> 01:46:26.960
he would make these split second turns and shoot guys in the face that were

1963
01:46:26.961 --> 01:46:28.370
falling off of buildings.

1964
01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:33.170
Like guys would like we jumping off of buildings and he would spin and in midair

1965
01:46:33.171 --> 01:46:35.920
they would explode.
And he just had this,

1966
01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:41.180
this super tight tuned in sense of what the cursor was doing on a screen as he

1967
01:46:43.401 --> 01:46:46.760
was moving.
And if you watch some of the really high level quick guys,

1968
01:46:46.910 --> 01:46:48.530
when they would play in what these things are called,

1969
01:46:48.531 --> 01:46:50.010
they're called demos and they

1970
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:53.640
<v 0>can make a demo and then they could upload the demo and you could watch a match</v>

1971
01:46:53.641 --> 01:46:56.430
take place from their point of view and you could see how,

1972
01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:59.910
how well they move in the game and it was just like my God.

1973
01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:02.280
Like when you get to the really high levels of the game,

1974
01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:06.630
it's insanely adrenaline filled because you're going down dark corridors,

1975
01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:09.180
people are shooting at you,
you're shooting at them,

1976
01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:11.580
your health is deteriorating before your eyes.

1977
01:47:11.730 --> 01:47:13.350
You're running to try to get more health.

1978
01:47:13.351 --> 01:47:16.830
You're running to try to get armor and new weapons and you're trying to control

1979
01:47:16.831 --> 01:47:19.230
the map and waiting for the new weapon to respond.

1980
01:47:19.380 --> 01:47:21.450
You've got to get to this area within five seconds.

1981
01:47:21.451 --> 01:47:22.980
He'd have to time it all out in your head.

1982
01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:27.490
You have to know the map inside and out.
It becomes insanely addictive.
And the,

1983
01:47:27.491 --> 01:47:28.830
the,
the,
the rush,

1984
01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:33.180
the actual rush that you would get from these games is incredible.
I mean,

1985
01:47:33.181 --> 01:47:35.820
it's just adrenaline pumping,
heart beating,

1986
01:47:35.970 --> 01:47:39.720
three dimensional graphics sound you have headphones on.
So you,

1987
01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:42.810
you're here three dimensional sound.
Like if you hear something to the right,

1988
01:47:42.930 --> 01:47:45.720
that means someone is to your right.
Like they are actually two,

1989
01:47:45.721 --> 01:47:50.370
you're right in the game and you run towards them and is these corridors and it

1990
01:47:50.371 --> 01:47:51.061
was amazing.

1991
01:47:51.061 --> 01:47:55.110
It's an amazing game because then it's just one of them backing into the fence

1992
01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:58.720
and saying,
fuck it.
I can't do it.
What's probably good for you?
Sorry,

1993
01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:03.390
I lost years of my life playing those games did and I enjoyed it.
I enjoyed it.

1994
01:48:03.391 --> 01:48:06.060
But I guarantee I lost years of my life.
Uh,

1995
01:48:06.061 --> 01:48:09.090
it could also coincided with a time where I wasn't white writing many jokes.

1996
01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:13.170
Coincidental.
Right,
right.
Yeah.
Sometimes if something becomes obsessive,
I wanted,

1997
01:48:13.171 --> 01:48:13.740
there's a balance.

1998
01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:17.280
I want to have more fun stuff in my life that I do that's healthy and normal,

1999
01:48:17.550 --> 01:48:19.290
but you know,
I don't want to get addicted to anything else.

2000
01:48:19.290 --> 01:48:22.110
I don't want to put down one addiction and I hope I can just stay away from this

2001
01:48:22.111 --> 01:48:22.691
one for awhile.
I've,

2002
01:48:22.691 --> 01:48:26.280
I've been keeping a running tally is the first time I ever did that.

2003
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.510
A running tally financially.
Oh really?
Yes.

2004
01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:34.440
Of how much you spending on that stuff?
It's quite a bit.
It's not,

2005
01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:37.170
I mean it's not,
you know,
I've put his way in a year of,

2006
01:48:37.171 --> 01:48:39.310
I spent more than Charlie Sheen.
Sure.
I mean that,

2007
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:41.780
I mean that one year that he talked to $50,000 in a year.
I was like,

2008
01:48:42.630 --> 01:48:46.260
I mean often I would say it's nothing but I've done more and I'll make Charlie

2009
01:48:46.261 --> 01:48:50.460
sheen money.
Wow.
Not every year and not up to this point this year.

2010
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:54.000
Well,
if you can replace it with something,

2011
01:48:54.001 --> 01:48:55.470
isn't that what your mom wants to tell you?

2012
01:48:55.471 --> 01:49:00.471
That mom message to Phil said you can go to the gym and that was in 2003 I put

2013
01:49:02.731 --> 01:49:06.720
that on my second CD.
A mother made a very good point.
She said,

2014
01:49:06.721 --> 01:49:07.501
just go to the gym.

2015
01:49:07.501 --> 01:49:11.520
You can meet nice girls to the senior ladies of the evening getting shape.

2016
01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:13.590
And she was right.
I did do that.

2017
01:49:13.650 --> 01:49:16.260
But I mean she called it ladies of the evening too,
right?
I don't know.

2018
01:49:16.290 --> 01:49:19.320
I forget what it was called.
The time it's,
yeah,

2019
01:49:19.321 --> 01:49:22.020
I don't remember what she called it.
I might even have it on my foot.
If you,

2020
01:49:22.021 --> 01:49:25.800
if you picked up a game,
like,
I hate to say it,
but even golf,

2021
01:49:26.090 --> 01:49:27.750
like golf becomes very addiction.

2022
01:49:28.230 --> 01:49:31.800
It takes a lot of time and guys do it for like long hours in the day,

2023
01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:35.580
but it's also fun.
You go with your buddies,
you'd go and fos,

2024
01:49:35.581 --> 01:49:37.840
he could've no you all day and he'd go and knock.

2025
01:49:37.870 --> 01:49:40.110
We ain't Voss plays basically every fucking day.
Right.

2026
01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:41.880
But I don't sleep well enough to pull it off either.

2027
01:49:41.881 --> 01:49:43.490
My sleep's a big issue like I,

2028
01:49:43.491 --> 01:49:46.800
and I feel like this is why I get so frustrated and angry and just self hating

2029
01:49:46.810 --> 01:49:47.643
because

2030
01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:49.720
<v 3>I tried to do the right thing.</v>

2031
01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:54.040
Like I'll put the mask on big boy when God is Tessa,
went to three apnea test,

2032
01:49:54.370 --> 01:49:56.590
still can't do it.
Claustrophobic.

2033
01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:00.340
I fucking finally fall asleep and then I hear

2034
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:05.260
and I realize that the air is blowing out the side of the mask.

2035
01:50:05.261 --> 01:50:09.040
It's like everything.
Nothing syncs up,
right.
Despite my best efforts.

2036
01:50:09.041 --> 01:50:10.960
And it's almost like you're always taught if you do the right thing,

2037
01:50:10.961 --> 01:50:11.794
the right thing.

2038
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:15.940
I've done all the legwork and I'm still getting fucking dog shit results and it

2039
01:50:15.941 --> 01:50:16.780
makes me nuts.

2040
01:50:17.050 --> 01:50:21.040
It makes me so I want to smash my face to a fucking window because I've done the

2041
01:50:21.041 --> 01:50:24.030
right stuff and I still can't fall asleep.
And you're asleep at Mo.

2042
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:27.430
Maybe someone listening to this can shed some light or help you out in some sort

2043
01:50:27.431 --> 01:50:28.180
of war.

2044
01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:30.940
Probably not though because I bet you've talked about this on the radio enough

2045
01:50:30.941 --> 01:50:33.360
times where someone has explored all the options with you.

2046
01:50:33.610 --> 01:50:36.070
I have something called a complex apnea.

2047
01:50:36.071 --> 01:50:40.420
It's central apnea and it's obstructive.
Like I was falling asleep on the plane.

2048
01:50:40.630 --> 01:50:42.310
I flew out here today and I just kept,

2049
01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:45.420
it felt like someone was just fucking put a sock in my mouth.
It was a,

2050
01:50:46.690 --> 01:50:51.160
it was like my fucking dub tongue lolled back over my throat.
And then if it,

2051
01:50:51.161 --> 01:50:54.190
but if it's not that I have a mouth guard,
I use not the one you use,

2052
01:50:54.191 --> 01:50:57.220
but I have one that does hold my jaw forward,
then it's a central apnea.

2053
01:50:57.490 --> 01:51:00.370
When my tongue's not blocking things,
my brain just goes,
don't breathe.

2054
01:51:00.610 --> 01:51:03.280
You don't breathe.
So the ASV machine I have,

2055
01:51:03.281 --> 01:51:07.090
which I've tried c pap and APAP and bypass and all that shit ASV is the

2056
01:51:07.091 --> 01:51:11.110
combination that they supposed to work with.
Complex apnea is very,

2057
01:51:11.111 --> 01:51:12.310
very intuitive machine.

2058
01:51:12.340 --> 01:51:14.890
Like it really picks up your breathing and it works with you.

2059
01:51:15.490 --> 01:51:18.710
Even though they can't sleep with John Dam,
it stinks.

2060
01:51:18.711 --> 01:51:21.850
So when you put that thing on that you just can't get a good night's sleep.
No,

2061
01:51:22.450 --> 01:51:25.000
no,
because I get claustrophobic,
claustrophobic,

2062
01:51:25.090 --> 01:51:27.580
mass cause on your face and tries to be nuts from stuffy.

2063
01:51:27.581 --> 01:51:32.110
My douchey nose is stuffy.
Fucking Jimmy Norton's cunt nose is stuffy.

2064
01:51:32.111 --> 01:51:33.310
It makes me so frustrated.

2065
01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:36.070
And you think that the nose thing has something to do with allergies?
So yeah,

2066
01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:39.760
big thing.
Big thing.
I mean,
you know,
I think so.

2067
01:51:40.590 --> 01:51:43.960
Are we all crazy?
Are All comics crazy?
Yeah.
But I mean like literally.

2068
01:51:45.490 --> 01:51:47.980
Yeah.
I'm not getting the air and they had physically it's the truth.

2069
01:51:47.981 --> 01:51:50.710
You know we yet,
yes.
I think those things are both true.

2070
01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:53.320
I think we are all nuts and I do think that I just can't breathe.
Well.

2071
01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:57.910
Do you monitor your diet to keep your diet free of things that cause

2072
01:51:57.911 --> 01:52:00.760
inflammation or anything?
Probably.
You know what's funny?

2073
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:04.120
I have a feeling that certain things do it.
Like we'd probably does it to me.

2074
01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:10.030
I know when I eat Sushi I'm a throat clearing jerk off by things like uh,

2075
01:52:10.031 --> 01:52:12.640
you know,
even the fat,
anything milk oriented bothers me.

2076
01:52:13.170 --> 01:52:16.780
So certain foods I can avoid and that and that makes it easier.

2077
01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:20.140
I use a breathe right strip.
Does that help?
Yeah,
a little bit.

2078
01:52:20.170 --> 01:52:23.410
I mean that and plus the mouth,
the mouth guard,
the one you got.

2079
01:52:23.411 --> 01:52:25.750
I want to try to get up because I have central apnea too.

2080
01:52:25.751 --> 01:52:29.980
It won't fix it at the mouth guard has changed my life a little bit because it

2081
01:52:29.981 --> 01:52:31.330
does keep my throat open.

2082
01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:36.720
So like a lot of times I am probably choking far less often like that I did.

2083
01:52:37.661 --> 01:52:42.040
I,
you know what I mean?
That I would be normally,
so it's helped me a lot.
But um,

2084
01:52:42.180 --> 01:52:44.710
you know,
I just talked about this on the radio the other day with it be like,

2085
01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:46.150
one of the reasons that when opie

2086
01:52:46.150 --> 01:52:48.740
<v 0>and Anthony had their fight recently and they,
they're actually cool.
It was,</v>

2087
01:52:48.741 --> 01:52:52.160
I missed that fight.
I our heard ob talking about it.
No,

2088
01:52:52.161 --> 01:52:56.510
you know what I heard you talking about opie crying on the radio talking about

2089
01:52:56.511 --> 01:52:58.150
it,
but I missed the whole thing.
Yeah,
it was,

2090
01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:02.700
Anthony had had said some shit about open,
then open responded.
Um,

2091
01:53:02.750 --> 01:53:06.110
but you know what,
what did they say?
Um,
what the hell did answer,

2092
01:53:06.111 --> 01:53:09.020
he was just talking about how it was difficult to work with him all these years

2093
01:53:09.021 --> 01:53:10.010
and the stuff with his girlfriend,

2094
01:53:10.011 --> 01:53:11.810
he went through a history of why there's bad blood.

2095
01:53:11.811 --> 01:53:16.160
It's just got to the point where I could tell on Twitter that those guys were,

2096
01:53:16.161 --> 01:53:20.570
we're going to go,
I could sent it.
Um,
and I never said to Andrew,

2097
01:53:20.571 --> 01:53:22.850
you're going to bad mouth open.
I never said dopey.
What are you feeling?

2098
01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:26.450
Like it's see through their tweets that some things that either one of them were

2099
01:53:26.451 --> 01:53:30.980
saying we're being misinterpreted.
It was just going to happen.
So aunt,

2100
01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:32.750
you know,

2101
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:35.870
opens it a few things on Twitter or on the show that I think misinterpreted or

2102
01:53:35.871 --> 01:53:38.150
even interpreted.
Right?
And got Mad,
but combination of both.

2103
01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:42.260
So whatever that fucking snipping at each other.
And then when it went,
oop,

2104
01:53:42.261 --> 01:53:43.460
went back at him the next day,

2105
01:53:43.461 --> 01:53:46.140
like you have to aunt really set some stuff on the compound show old.

2106
01:53:46.270 --> 01:53:48.910
He came back and he was pissed off.
And uh,

2107
01:53:48.911 --> 01:53:50.450
I was in a weird position only cause I'm like,

2108
01:53:50.451 --> 01:53:54.110
I'm not going to sit here and just play devil's advocate for Anthony because

2109
01:53:54.111 --> 01:53:56.150
aunt needs to do that.
Like they need to do that together.

2110
01:53:56.570 --> 01:53:59.780
And it almost seemed unfair for me to just sit there and argue with opie.
Like,

2111
01:53:59.781 --> 01:54:02.330
I'm Anthony's mouthpiece,
but you know what I mean.

2112
01:54:02.330 --> 01:54:04.490
And so I even said I didn't want to do that.
There's a couple of points.

2113
01:54:04.491 --> 01:54:07.430
I clarified things and I thought Ann had made a valid point about,

2114
01:54:07.670 --> 01:54:09.860
but I wasn't gonna just sit there and argue with opie over it like that,

2115
01:54:09.861 --> 01:54:11.860
that's let him,
and he had fucking do that shit.
Like I'm not,

2116
01:54:12.250 --> 01:54:16.040
I'm not that codependent.
It's like,
let them fuck it.
But,
um,
but I've got like,

2117
01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:18.900
it was legit.
Two people thought it might have been like manipulate,

2118
01:54:18.901 --> 01:54:22.520
but I watched it happen and you know,
nobody wants to do that shit.

2119
01:54:22.521 --> 01:54:24.290
Like that's embarrassing shit when you're,
you know,

2120
01:54:24.291 --> 01:54:26.830
especially a fucking audience like that.
Nobody wants to solve.

2121
01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:30.830
I on the fucking awful did he saw it wasn't,

2122
01:54:30.900 --> 01:54:33.110
it wasn't like a little,
it was a little,
it

2123
01:54:35.810 --> 01:54:39.170
wasn't that bad,
but he kind of caught himself and he didn't want,
it was like,

2124
01:54:39.171 --> 01:54:42.980
you know,
it was like a little bit the I,
but he just,
you know,

2125
01:54:42.981 --> 01:54:47.210
he was over in remembering nice stuff.
It was remembering Nice Shit.
And,
uh,

2126
01:54:47.211 --> 01:54:49.610
I forget what I was to,
what was I saying?
I was just talking about something.

2127
01:54:49.611 --> 01:54:52.010
Why don't they go down this road?
Um,
I don't remember either.

2128
01:54:52.011 --> 01:54:56.060
I was talking about breathing and about my fucking why did I go down this road?

2129
01:54:56.080 --> 01:55:01.070
You talking about Oop,
bad mouthing,
um,
that they,
they fought back and forth.

2130
01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:01.341
No,

2131
01:55:01.341 --> 01:55:05.420
but there was a reason I went down that road then maybe think of those guys and

2132
01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:10.010
I don't remember what it was or that people listening online.
Does anybody know?

2133
01:55:10.610 --> 01:55:13.080
I legitimately just lost my place.
I would say little,

2134
01:55:13.150 --> 01:55:16.400
someone will say it right now on Twitter.
Yeah.
Like what was I saying?

2135
01:55:16.401 --> 01:55:16.881
That made me,

2136
01:55:16.881 --> 01:55:20.330
cause it was the reason I went down the road about them fighting about something

2137
01:55:20.331 --> 01:55:21.260
that got talked about.

2138
01:55:21.261 --> 01:55:25.760
It was something I said after or something I thought of that one of them said,

2139
01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:29.960
I don't know.
God dammit.
I don't know what it was.

2140
01:55:29.961 --> 01:55:34.430
I had no one that me going down that row was spawned by thinking of something

2141
01:55:34.431 --> 01:55:37.620
else.
Motherfucker.
God Damn it.

2142
01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:39.950
I'm not saying waiting for someone to,

2143
01:55:40.190 --> 01:55:43.650
maybe there's a woman I'm looking at with chips,
tweets.
The wonder,

2144
01:55:43.651 --> 01:55:45.130
I'm not getting any fucking real information.

2145
01:55:45.590 --> 01:55:47.780
Ships that mansion you have Twitter.

2146
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:51.210
Chip is a separate character that you a tweet through him and Ed,

2147
01:55:51.211 --> 01:55:52.590
you're both have their own Twitter.
Of course.

2148
01:55:55.300 --> 01:55:59.670
I'm sure the chip has 44,000 followers.

2149
01:56:00.090 --> 01:56:03.540
Chip has a,
you know,
yeah,
he's a fucking,
he's a force.

2150
01:56:03.810 --> 01:56:07.470
Let me see here now on Jim Norton's.
Let's see how many,

2151
01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:10.230
I'm trying to see anybody's mad.
Apologize for stolen like this.

2152
01:56:10.410 --> 01:56:13.980
And that's hilarious.
I didn't mean to go down that road.
Someone will find it.

2153
01:56:14.010 --> 01:56:15.420
We're going to get corrected on line,

2154
01:56:15.450 --> 01:56:18.630
but I want to know because there was a point I was making the mask

2155
01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:25.380
on the show.
No,
but I don't know.
Window went down the opie and Anthony thing.

2156
01:56:25.381 --> 01:56:28.350
There was something,
I was thinking of it.
I literally just lost my place.

2157
01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:31.680
That's how tired I am.
I don't know.
You know,
let me tell you something.

2158
01:56:31.681 --> 01:56:33.130
Maybe it will help you.
Um,

2159
01:56:35.130 --> 01:56:40.020
you know what I really liked is that fucking thing that you wrote about Trevor

2160
01:56:40.020 --> 01:56:42.990
Noah.
Oh,
thank you.
That thing you wrote for Time magazine.
Thank you.

2161
01:56:43.020 --> 01:56:44.670
That was really smart.

2162
01:56:44.710 --> 01:56:49.470
That's really appropriate and exactly.
You are exactly right.

2163
01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:54.710
The outrage was manufactured.
It was its recreational outrage there.

2164
01:56:54.810 --> 01:56:55.800
They found something,

2165
01:56:55.801 --> 01:56:59.700
a green light to be a dick about and they decided to be a dick about it.

2166
01:56:59.701 --> 01:57:03.360
And you wrote a really well thought out piece about that.
Thank you.
Yeah,

2167
01:57:03.361 --> 01:57:06.420
it was just,
it was just the uh,
Trevor Noah is,
and the problem you are,

2168
01:57:06.450 --> 01:57:07.620
it's kind of hard sometimes.

2169
01:57:07.621 --> 01:57:10.920
Like the good thing about writing is you have a time to edit and you can get

2170
01:57:10.921 --> 01:57:14.950
your thoughts in a row instead of just reacting angrily.
He don't even have a,

2171
01:57:14.951 --> 01:57:19.100
like a flood of thoughts come normally or explain this best.
Like he,

2172
01:57:19.101 --> 01:57:21.510
when you have a bunch of thoughts and you just want to get them all out,

2173
01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:24.120
there's been certain things I wanted to write about but I couldn't cause you get

2174
01:57:24.121 --> 01:57:28.680
blocked by the frustration.
What do I want to say?
And Norman.
Leah said,

2175
01:57:28.681 --> 01:57:32.100
his therapist said,
damn,
years ago,
picture it like a room that's on fire.

2176
01:57:32.101 --> 01:57:35.120
Do we talk about this?
He said,
when you win,
everybody rushes to the door,

2177
01:57:35.130 --> 01:57:39.450
they get stuck.
But if everybody walks out of the room one at a time,

2178
01:57:39.810 --> 01:57:44.160
everyone gets out and then you can section them off into people by height and

2179
01:57:44.161 --> 01:57:47.280
people by color and couple of them.
That's the way it is with thoughts.

2180
01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:50.940
So it's almost like all this frustration,
I'll just talk it into this thing,

2181
01:57:51.060 --> 01:57:54.060
but I did.
I just get the fuck out one at a time,

2182
01:57:54.061 --> 01:57:56.120
one at a time and then formulate it.

2183
01:57:56.130 --> 01:57:57.660
Cause something like that where there's so many,

2184
01:57:57.661 --> 01:58:01.000
you have so many feelings about it.
It's hard not to try it.

2185
01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:03.960
We try hard not to be self righteous as comedians.
You really tried to,

2186
01:58:03.961 --> 01:58:07.110
just to make your thoughts known.
We all fall into it once in a while.

2187
01:58:07.111 --> 01:58:09.540
Every person does it,
but it's,
it's,
it's hard.

2188
01:58:09.570 --> 01:58:13.380
You don't want to cause that's a Dick Quality.
Yeah,
it's,
well it's,

2189
01:58:13.381 --> 01:58:15.990
there's a balancing act where you're creating something.
It's like,

2190
01:58:15.991 --> 01:58:18.330
what tone am I trying to set here?

2191
01:58:18.510 --> 01:58:22.740
What's the best way to get this thought out where it's got the most impact?

2192
01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:27.720
How do I really feel about it versus what's the most entertaining version of it

2193
01:58:27.721 --> 01:58:32.430
that I could say,
you know,
how much do I twist it for just for humor?

2194
01:58:32.610 --> 01:58:35.580
How much did I fuck around with it?
You know,
and it's,

2195
01:58:35.610 --> 01:58:39.120
that's the beautiful thing about standup is that it's all coming from your

2196
01:58:39.121 --> 01:58:41.980
direction.
You can decide where to it and tweak it.

2197
01:58:41.981 --> 01:58:44.950
And so you're going to have those little battles in your head about where to

2198
01:58:44.951 --> 01:58:49.720
take things.
Yeah.
I mean,
um,
but it's like when they,
I always write,
it's funny,

2199
01:58:49.930 --> 01:58:51.040
this is why fans are great,

2200
01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:53.650
cause I wrote that piece and then I get people get mad at me.

2201
01:58:53.650 --> 01:58:56.830
Why didn't you write one about aunt say,
first of all,

2202
01:58:56.831 --> 01:58:59.290
I have to talk about him on stage and he's my special.
Second of all,

2203
01:58:59.291 --> 01:59:03.040
they didn't ask me to,
I don't,
I don't call them and ask.
They just asked me.
Um,

2204
01:59:03.060 --> 01:59:04.810
you know,
they've,
I've turned them down for things.

2205
01:59:04.811 --> 01:59:06.520
I didn't think I was qualified to write about it.
I'm like,
no,

2206
01:59:06.521 --> 01:59:09.340
I'm not going to address that.
So how does that go?
Like wait,
they say,

2207
01:59:09.341 --> 01:59:11.550
would you like to write something about Trevor Noah?
Look,

2208
01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:13.870
you have a relationship with them.
When they do that,
they'll write to me and say,

2209
01:59:13.871 --> 01:59:18.230
would you write something about Trevor?
Or they've written me when Robyn died.

2210
01:59:18.231 --> 01:59:19.690
They're like,
would you like to write something?
I'm like,
yeah,

2211
01:59:20.770 --> 01:59:23.020
but they asked him that Joan Rivers.
I said no,
only because I loved her,

2212
01:59:23.021 --> 01:59:23.500
but I wasn't,

2213
01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:26.470
I just felt like so many people are gonna be eulogizing let people who are

2214
01:59:26.471 --> 01:59:28.810
better qualified to do it.
Cause I really didn't know her.

2215
01:59:28.990 --> 01:59:32.920
So of Joan Rivers was Patrice,
you would've written something.
Oh,
of course.

2216
01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:37.090
If they asked me to.
Um,
but again,
you have to get away.
I just,
it was only like,

2217
01:59:37.091 --> 01:59:39.310
I didn't know her well enough and I would have been talking about her,

2218
01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:41.410
but not from a knowledgeable point of view.

2219
01:59:41.411 --> 01:59:44.620
As someone who interacted with Joan a lot,
I was a huge fan.

2220
01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:49.120
I was bummed out that I never got to meet her.
I really wish I got to meet her.

2221
01:59:49.150 --> 01:59:53.050
There was,
I was supposed to do,
uh,
in bed with Joan.
Oh yeah.

2222
01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:57.670
It was a podcast that you climb in bed with her and she would interview you from

2223
01:59:57.671 --> 02:00:00.820
bed and you know,
he'd just laugh around,
joke around with her.

2224
02:00:00.821 --> 02:00:04.030
I would have loved to have done it,
but for whatever reason,
scheduling wise,

2225
02:00:04.031 --> 02:00:05.570
it had to be moved around or,

2226
02:00:06.250 --> 02:00:11.250
and then obviously she died quite a while after that first time I met Joan

2227
02:00:11.410 --> 02:00:13.570
Rivers.
I was on a flight coming from,
I mean,
I loved her.

2228
02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:15.460
So I was on a flight coming from

2229
02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:21.430
West Palm Beach and I see Joan get on the plane and she's two seats in front of

2230
02:00:21.431 --> 02:00:24.790
me and to her assistant recognize me.
So as we're getting on the plane,

2231
02:00:24.791 --> 02:00:28.240
she's sitting there and she has a look up and I just said like,
get a hi,

2232
02:00:28.241 --> 02:00:31.840
I'm a comedian.
That's just,
you're just,
you're awesome.
I just think you're great.

2233
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:34.990
She said,
thank you.
And then she's just,
you know,
she's like,
you don't look funny.

2234
02:00:34.991 --> 02:00:36.570
I'm like,
well not,
you know,
she was just like,
well,

2235
02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:39.310
so I sat down in moments like that.
I'm terrible by the way,

2236
02:00:39.311 --> 02:00:43.420
I'm the worst fun banter guy ever.

2237
02:00:43.570 --> 02:00:47.050
I stink at fun banter with anyone on elevators.

2238
02:00:47.230 --> 02:00:49.960
My ex would laugh at me cause somebody would walk on and go like,
oh boy,

2239
02:00:49.961 --> 02:00:51.210
this elevator slow and I'll just go,

2240
02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:55.390
yes it is like I'm a humorless content but it's not.
I just panicked.

2241
02:00:55.990 --> 02:00:58.690
So I sat down and then her assistant came over with a piece of the New York

2242
02:00:58.691 --> 02:01:00.370
Times and he handed it to me.
He's like,

2243
02:01:00.371 --> 02:01:02.170
Joan said you looked like he needed something to read.

2244
02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:05.530
So she gave me a piece of red paper and I want to take a photo with it.
I'm like,

2245
02:01:05.531 --> 02:01:08.620
can we take a photo after the plane landed?
And she goes,
yeah,
but not here.

2246
02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:11.170
So she walked me up to the top and she goes,
hop on.

2247
02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:14.260
And she had one of those lug does those things that they zip through the airport

2248
02:01:14.261 --> 02:01:17.890
with and she gave me a ride on her fucking thing.

2249
02:01:17.891 --> 02:01:20.770
We speed through the airport and then we took a photo,

2250
02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:22.450
a not a good photo of either one of us,

2251
02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:25.000
but I eventually got her to sign it from someone else.

2252
02:01:25.001 --> 02:01:27.400
And I had met her a couple of times after that and said,
brief hello is,

2253
02:01:27.401 --> 02:01:30.700
I don't think she remembered me.
And the last time I spoke to her,

2254
02:01:31.210 --> 02:01:34.240
I went to Louis C K had on Thanksgiving two years ago.

2255
02:01:34.510 --> 02:01:35.860
He had Joan Rivers at his house.

2256
02:01:35.861 --> 02:01:40.010
He had Philip Seymour Hoffman at his house and he invited me and a,
I said

2257
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:42.050
<v 3>hi to her.
Um,
wow.</v>

2258
02:01:42.051 --> 02:01:46.250
You went to a dinner party with Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Joan Rivers at Louis

2259
02:01:46.250 --> 02:01:48.530
C K s house.
And that's amazing story.
Well,

2260
02:01:48.531 --> 02:01:51.350
this is why Louis is so Louis would tell a great story.
This is what Louis sell.

2261
02:01:51.351 --> 02:01:54.520
Incredible because he's unafraid.
Like someone told me,

2262
02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:58.970
I think Nick Depaulo was there.
Bobby Bobby Kelly was so funny that day.
I panic.

2263
02:01:58.971 --> 02:02:00.930
I'm just looking at Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
You know,
I sent a lighter,

2264
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:05.060
just myself.
Um,
you know,
but I'm,
I'm not good in those moments.

2265
02:02:05.061 --> 02:02:09.290
Bob Kelly's just be a fucking Dag.
He's breaking balls.
He a big funny ox,

2266
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:12.920
you know,
shit talker,
bully guy.
Just moments like that.

2267
02:02:12.921 --> 02:02:14.480
It really loved Bobby because he's just,

2268
02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:17.630
he's so good at being funny in those moments.

2269
02:02:17.631 --> 02:02:19.580
You don't like the ball breaker from Boston that he is.

2270
02:02:19.940 --> 02:02:23.420
And Bobby's a guy who like in those moments like metal,

2271
02:02:23.421 --> 02:02:27.410
who the guy is who tries to Alpha Bob.
Bob Is,
Bob is a,

2272
02:02:27.420 --> 02:02:28.590
is a,

2273
02:02:28.750 --> 02:02:32.330
a Yorkshire terrier who would be slaughtered by a pit bull because Bob's the guy

2274
02:02:32.331 --> 02:02:34.130
who really doesn't back off it from anybody.

2275
02:02:34.350 --> 02:02:37.250
Like that's why he's funny cause like someone tries to Alpha him and be funny

2276
02:02:37.251 --> 02:02:41.150
and by ain't not dead,
he just,
and he's just,
you know,
but,
but that works for him,

2277
02:02:41.180 --> 02:02:41.900
you know what I mean?

2278
02:02:41.900 --> 02:02:44.880
So I really admired Bobby that day cause he was so funny in front of Phillip's

2279
02:02:44.881 --> 02:02:48.980
from a hop and all these other people and Ellen Burstyn was there.
Um,
you know,

2280
02:02:48.981 --> 02:02:51.590
and I'm just staring at her like she's doing the extra system.
Yeah,

2281
02:02:51.591 --> 02:02:53.840
it was that she was in the [inaudible].
She played the mother in the exorcist.

2282
02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:58.610
Really?
Yeah.
So what a bizarre partner.
He knows the fucking weirdest people.
Um,

2283
02:02:58.730 --> 02:03:02.090
and he's awesome.
And he was making Thanksgiving and Joan was helping him.

2284
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:05.300
And I think Nick Depalo told me that Louie had never done this.

2285
02:03:05.301 --> 02:03:08.420
That's why he's got such courage because he'll do something like that.

2286
02:03:08.421 --> 02:03:11.870
That's why he's show works.
Cause he takes risks.
You know,
I'm fucking,

2287
02:03:11.871 --> 02:03:13.580
I'm Samuel to shy sea lion.

2288
02:03:13.581 --> 02:03:16.430
I just want to sit back until it's all in a row and everything's fucking so this

2289
02:03:16.431 --> 02:03:20.390
is a Thanksgiving dinner parties.
It was Thanksgiving two years ago.
Oh.

2290
02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:24.810
And Phillips showed up with his kids and it sounds amazing.

2291
02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:28.400
Parker Posey was there.
Um,
and,
and fucking,
by the way,

2292
02:03:28.401 --> 02:03:29.780
I met the Cappuccino machine.

2293
02:03:29.781 --> 02:03:32.660
Bobby and I are trying to make Cappuccino and Philip Seymour Hoffman comes over

2294
02:03:33.170 --> 02:03:34.930
and I'm just like,
look for making kappa cheat all.
Yeah.

2295
02:03:34.931 --> 02:03:37.550
I'm so star struck like a cunt and Bob's just being funny.

2296
02:03:37.551 --> 02:03:42.110
Bob's just being him in that moment,
you know,
he's able to be him and be funny.

2297
02:03:42.110 --> 02:03:45.050
And I was like fucking so jealous of Bob that he could be so funny there.

2298
02:03:45.530 --> 02:03:49.650
But Anyway,
Joan was there and uh,
when she,

2299
02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:51.560
I was just it all over.
I couldn't even speak to her.

2300
02:03:51.561 --> 02:03:53.630
She was there with Melissa and switched.
You walked out.

2301
02:03:53.631 --> 02:03:56.480
I'm like pre or post meeting or on the point.
Oh,
so all of those posts.

2302
02:03:56.780 --> 02:03:59.320
So she left and I said goodbye Ms. Right.
It was nice seeing you Joan,

2303
02:03:59.350 --> 02:04:00.410
which was like,
oh,
okay.

2304
02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:04.400
Like literally she had no recognition of me and I saw Louis after that and I was

2305
02:04:04.401 --> 02:04:06.470
like,
God,
it really hurts my feelings that she doesn't know who I am.

2306
02:04:06.471 --> 02:04:09.590
And I'm not like that or any comedian.
I'm not uncomfortable around comedians.

2307
02:04:09.950 --> 02:04:11.870
I'm not nervous around comedians.
Uh,

2308
02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:14.300
cause I figure we all know each other in some way,

2309
02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:18.150
but around her I was always like fucking head down here.

2310
02:04:18.170 --> 02:04:19.003
It gets bad and all that.

2311
02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:22.970
I was like John Candy and stripes and Larry Cat's yelling at him,
shut up.
Okay,

2312
02:04:22.971 --> 02:04:26.450
sure.
I always had like that thing with Joan Rivers because she was just,

2313
02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:30.200
I didn't want her to not like me because she was just such a fucking icon.

2314
02:04:30.260 --> 02:04:33.200
It would have Louis say when you told him that he was nice though.
He was smart.

2315
02:04:33.201 --> 02:04:34.520
He goes,
you gotta remember she's healed with this.

2316
02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:39.060
We Louie so logical Louise like you know,
Geez fucking an 80 year old woman.

2317
02:04:39.450 --> 02:04:42.120
You know she's put,
but that's how he is.
You know,

2318
02:04:42.180 --> 02:04:43.560
you forget cause she's had work done.

2319
02:04:43.561 --> 02:04:46.830
She's fucking 80 she doesn't know anybody and I'm like,
he's right.

2320
02:04:46.860 --> 02:04:48.930
Even though she was still fucking totally sharp.

2321
02:04:49.410 --> 02:04:51.930
But she was an 80 year old woman at that time.
So of course,
you know,

2322
02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:54.930
maybe like the face,
it didn't ring as much of a bell as they should have,

2323
02:04:55.050 --> 02:05:00.050
which is also insanely famous for so many fucking years where she's probably all

2324
02:05:01.770 --> 02:05:05.580
day talking to people that want a piece of her all day.
They want to talk,

2325
02:05:05.581 --> 02:05:07.560
don't want pictures.
They wanted this,
they wanted that.

2326
02:05:08.190 --> 02:05:09.780
They should probably just can't remember it all.

2327
02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:13.600
It's 50 fucking years of that and show business everybody.

2328
02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:15.200
And that's how it was for me.
That Ozzy Osborne,

2329
02:05:15.210 --> 02:05:18.480
like I've met Ozzy so many times and when he finally knew me,

2330
02:05:18.810 --> 02:05:22.260
like I knew he knew him.
Hey Man,

2331
02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:25.500
anybody I knew it was really,
it's like,
you know,
hey man,
you look right,

2332
02:05:25.501 --> 02:05:29.700
how are you?
And he was like,
it was like really the way I would greet Joe Rogan.

2333
02:05:29.701 --> 02:05:32.280
Like it was just a buddy.
And like when that happened,
I was like,

2334
02:05:32.281 --> 02:05:35.730
my fucking life is good.
But Joe and I never had that with,

2335
02:05:35.731 --> 02:05:37.650
and I wish I had because she's one of them.

2336
02:05:37.651 --> 02:05:41.700
But she was one of my longest running aisles.
Like I really loved her.

2337
02:05:41.701 --> 02:05:44.110
She was not,
and not just cause she don't eat if someone dies,

2338
02:05:44.111 --> 02:05:47.340
how many waxes poetic about them.
But I thought she was fucking great.

2339
02:05:47.341 --> 02:05:50.310
She's a ballsy lady.
She was a very ballsy lady.
Very brave.

2340
02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:52.920
She was braver than any of us,
cause she never said she was sorry.

2341
02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:55.800
And she had so much to lose as far as the,
you know,

2342
02:05:56.340 --> 02:06:00.590
I mean I interviewed one time,
what was his name?
Henry Bush going to,

2343
02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:04.200
he was Johnny's hold lawyer,
Carson's old lawyer and he wrote a book recently.

2344
02:06:04.201 --> 02:06:06.360
I wonder how Carson would have felt about him.
The old lawyer write a book,

2345
02:06:06.570 --> 02:06:09.960
but he told all the old stories and I asked him about Joan Rivers and he had a

2346
02:06:09.961 --> 02:06:12.360
very interesting perspective on how Carson never would have,

2347
02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:13.860
he said he wouldn't have cared.

2348
02:06:13.861 --> 02:06:16.440
He said Carson didn't think she would last and late night cause she was a little

2349
02:06:16.441 --> 02:06:19.530
too abrasive to be watched.
I mean like,
you know,
Johnny was a smart fucking guy,

2350
02:06:19.950 --> 02:06:23.820
but Henry Bush kitten was a really,
well,
it didn't need to Carson go bad on her.

2351
02:06:23.850 --> 02:06:27.560
Didn't they have some sort of a falling out with Johnny was apparently a cold

2352
02:06:27.561 --> 02:06:27.720
mother.

2353
02:06:27.720 --> 02:06:31.230
Her mother was really cold and boy did it not the apple didn't fall far from the

2354
02:06:31.231 --> 02:06:34.330
tree.
He would do Joan,
this is what I,

2355
02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:37.620
and Joan got the show and her,
uh,

2356
02:06:37.650 --> 02:06:40.680
husband Edgar said she should do her own talk show.

2357
02:06:40.681 --> 02:06:43.560
I believe it started at 11 or 1130.
It was up against Johnny.

2358
02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:48.150
She did it because she was never considered for the permanent guest host job.

2359
02:06:48.690 --> 02:06:50.730
And she was hurt by that and she had had a career.

2360
02:06:51.450 --> 02:06:55.260
But apparently they had hung out with Johnny and not told him that she,

2361
02:06:55.261 --> 02:06:57.780
and I think if she had walked up to Carson and said,
Johnny,
look,

2362
02:06:57.781 --> 02:07:01.530
I have this opportunity according to Henry Bush get and Johnny's lawyer,

2363
02:07:01.800 --> 02:07:04.170
Johnny would have wished your well because he didn't think,

2364
02:07:04.710 --> 02:07:06.100
he didn't think she had the,

2365
02:07:06.101 --> 02:07:08.970
the longevity and late night just because of how she was.

2366
02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:10.830
And he might've been right because you look at,

2367
02:07:10.831 --> 02:07:15.831
Carson was so easy breezy and he had that fucking way and he lasted and John's

2368
02:07:16.261 --> 02:07:20.100
show lasted a little bit,
but it didn't last.
So I don't know.
But,
uh,

2369
02:07:20.101 --> 02:07:24.000
I guess he felt that she had betrayed him and he never spoke to her again.

2370
02:07:24.390 --> 02:07:27.950
And I think she tried to call him once and he hung up on her and never,

2371
02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:30.270
she said she sent him a note when his son died.

2372
02:07:30.510 --> 02:07:35.030
His son drove off a cliff and died.
No response.
He was a cold motherfucker.

2373
02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:36.100
Johnny man,
when he was done

2374
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:38.950
<v 0>with you,
he was done fucking finished.</v>

2375
02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:42.550
And so when she drove off a cliff,
well by mistake,
I think it was an accident,

2376
02:07:42.590 --> 02:07:43.480
I don't think it was a suicide.

2377
02:07:43.870 --> 02:07:46.400
His son Chris and I also heard the fucking one Jane,

2378
02:07:46.401 --> 02:07:50.530
when Johnny was eulogizing his son on the tonight show,

2379
02:07:50.740 --> 02:07:54.580
fucking Fred de Cordova who was his exact producer.
Give him like the wrap sign,

2380
02:07:55.090 --> 02:07:57.070
like to move it like because of commercial was coming.

2381
02:07:57.071 --> 02:07:59.950
And I heard the Carson never forgave him either and he was never allowed on the

2382
02:07:59.951 --> 02:08:03.880
floor of the tonight show again.
Johnny banished him to upstairs,
which again,

2383
02:08:03.881 --> 02:08:07.270
these are just,
you know,
third and fourth hand shit stories say I'm anyway,

2384
02:08:07.330 --> 02:08:10.330
absolutely repeat them as Gospel.
But you Snopes this.

2385
02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:12.790
But the fact that you fucking not those are true,

2386
02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:15.280
but the fact that you like almost like with TV people,

2387
02:08:15.281 --> 02:08:20.281
what are you thinking when this guy who is such a god on television is fucking

2388
02:08:20.831 --> 02:08:23.470
eulogizing his son and you're wrapping them up,
what are you thinking?

2389
02:08:23.470 --> 02:08:25.720
That fucking pampers can't wait five minutes.

2390
02:08:26.170 --> 02:08:28.600
Like what's going to happen to the show?
If you let them go.

2391
02:08:28.930 --> 02:08:31.720
Speaking of what's going to happen to show this one has to end.
Yes it does.

2392
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:34.200
We've been talking for awhile.
This is good though.
Yeah.

2393
02:08:34.210 --> 02:08:36.550
We got to do this more often.
I love it too.
When I'm out here.
This is,

2394
02:08:36.551 --> 02:08:39.610
I love doing you and uh,
it's my favorite one to do.
I mean,

2395
02:08:39.611 --> 02:08:41.950
I love Adam and I love,
but you know,
you,
I know for so many years,

2396
02:08:41.951 --> 02:08:44.920
so this is the most fun I had.
If we've known each other a long fucking time.

2397
02:08:44.921 --> 02:08:49.080
Dude.
Like I said,
we met in like what,
90,
91.
Uh,
yeah,

2398
02:08:49.100 --> 02:08:50.950
doing the the quarter deck and I still am I talking,

2399
02:08:50.951 --> 02:08:54.760
I remember your Mike Tyson joke about how scary it must have been when fucking

2400
02:08:55.030 --> 02:08:56.860
Mike showed up and Brad Pitt was worth and you're like,

2401
02:08:56.861 --> 02:08:58.240
you're checking a check you off you for a second.

2402
02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:01.390
And you did the Mike Tyson impression and you,
you were,
uh,

2403
02:09:01.810 --> 02:09:05.920
you were very funny and you're very animated and a very powerful comic to it.

2404
02:09:05.940 --> 02:09:08.950
I know you use that word a lot,
but that was,
that was how you struck me early on.

2405
02:09:09.210 --> 02:09:13.870
You had a tremendous amount of fucking force on stage and um,
you know,

2406
02:09:13.871 --> 02:09:17.460
and I was up there just meek doing high energy.
Fucking faggoty Jimmy,

2407
02:09:17.461 --> 02:09:20.950
how are you doing?
Like me,
I went though and I always liked you.

2408
02:09:21.070 --> 02:09:24.300
I think you start,
you are funny.
You're very nice.
No,

2409
02:09:24.820 --> 02:09:27.550
but it's interesting when you've gone through a journey like that with someone

2410
02:09:27.551 --> 02:09:30.270
when you've been friends since you were both starting out.
Yeah.
You know,
it's,

2411
02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:31.180
it's weird.

2412
02:09:31.180 --> 02:09:34.090
It's weird when you go back and you look at all the time that's passed and how

2413
02:09:34.091 --> 02:09:37.060
much each one of us has evolved and grown,
you know,

2414
02:09:37.061 --> 02:09:40.370
it's cool to see someone that you started out with being really successful too.

2415
02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:42.580
I'm really psyched for you.
Thank you man.
Yeah,

2416
02:09:42.581 --> 02:09:45.550
I hope people like the new special economic love it.
They'll love you.
