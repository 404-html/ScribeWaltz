<v Speaker 1>in here.</v>

36
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

37
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.771
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

38
00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:47.360
<v Speaker 1>He's uh,</v>

39
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.050
<v Speaker 1>he's saying that.</v>

40
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the video on his instagram?</v>

41
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.760
<v Speaker 1>He shows that it's more than 10 seconds.</v>

42
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

43
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.310
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

44
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.143
<v Speaker 1>It's fact.</v>

45
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.720
<v Speaker 1>And he plays the clock.</v>

46
00:00:56.721 --> 00:00:59.900
<v Speaker 1>As soon as Tyson fury goes down and then it's more than 10 seconds before he</v>

47
00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:00.620
<v Speaker 1>gets back up.</v>

48
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.060
<v Speaker 1>The only problem with that is,</v>

49
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

50
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.590
<v Speaker 1>it's human error,</v>

51
00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:03.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

52
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.600
<v Speaker 1>You can start immediately,</v>

53
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.580
<v Speaker 1>there's always that little,</v>

55
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>that little space and ties and they're supposed to be a guy on the sidelines</v>

56
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.611
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

57
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 1>That starts the camera.</v>

58
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

59
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.780
<v Speaker 1>And then he picks it up with five fort,</v>

60
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.623
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

61
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:17.660
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is referees,</v>

63
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.150
<v Speaker 1>when they're in the heat of the battle,</v>

65
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.640
<v Speaker 1>the fucking adrenaline there seconds.</v>

66
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:25.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they have a stopwatch in their hand to hit it.</v>

67
00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Every time a guy goes down,</v>

68
00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:26.331
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

69
00:01:26.331 --> 00:01:27.290
<v Speaker 1>why don't they have</v>

70
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Paula?</v>

71
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.770
<v Speaker 1>It's too much to remember.</v>

72
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.330
<v Speaker 1>We just talked about the heat of the moment.</v>

73
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

74
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.883
<v Speaker 1>Click.</v>

75
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Is that too much to remember?</v>

76
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

77
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:41.180
<v Speaker 1>think about all the Shit Tyson furious to American steak.</v>

78
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.103
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

79
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.500
<v Speaker 1>If you're in that fight,</v>

80
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.060
<v Speaker 1>I wanted,</v>

81
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.490
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

82
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm rooting for awhile there because I like,</v>

83
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.570
<v Speaker 1>I like big knockouts,</v>

84
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.453
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

85
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.363
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

86
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.890
<v Speaker 1>he looked good in the first two rounds.</v>

87
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Then he just looked like he abandoned the game plan and he was just looking for</v>

88
00:01:58.011 --> 00:01:58.970
<v Speaker 1>the knockout after that.</v>

89
00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

90
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.020
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

91
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>he's got a problem.</v>

92
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.130
<v Speaker 1>The problem is he can knock anybody the fuck out.</v>

93
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>

94
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Anybody except that guy said Tyson theory.</v>

95
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.920
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you almost knocked him out.</v>

96
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Like he knocked him out.</v>

97
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.560
<v Speaker 1>It was out.</v>

98
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.393
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't.</v>

99
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean he definitely did 10.</v>

100
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.090
<v Speaker 1>He was definitely down for 10.</v>

101
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.140
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing.</v>

102
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.130
<v Speaker 1>If the referee,</v>

103
00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:20.120
<v Speaker 1>instead of saying eight,</v>

104
00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:20.954
<v Speaker 1>said seven,</v>

105
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.390
<v Speaker 1>instead of saying six had five would have gotten up quicker.</v>

106
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I think he probably would have because he's waiting for eight,</v>

107
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.390
<v Speaker 1>nine and then he's standing up because he's trying to give himself.</v>

108
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>He's an old vet.</v>

109
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.960
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to give himself as much recovery time as he can.</v>

110
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I watched when I watched them getting up.</v>

111
00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:36.980
<v Speaker 1>I look at that replay and you see his head,</v>

112
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.720
<v Speaker 1>his head comes up like he's trying to get up and then he just stands up like a</v>

113
00:02:41.721 --> 00:02:42.171
<v Speaker 1>Zombie.</v>

114
00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:43.910
<v Speaker 1>I think that's an gypsy shit.</v>

115
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.163
<v Speaker 1>It's scary.</v>

116
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

117
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.370
<v Speaker 1>I did not expect him to get up.</v>

118
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

119
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.580
<v Speaker 1>I would celebrate fight.</v>

120
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.040
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mind.</v>

121
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.440
<v Speaker 1>While they were celebrating,</v>

122
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.000
<v Speaker 1>do the.</v>

123
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>Was like when he went down,</v>

124
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

125
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.511
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

126
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe he knocked him out in the twelfth like that.</v>

127
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>And it was the left hook going down.</v>

128
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>That was the craziest,</v>

129
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.870
<v Speaker 1>was on the right hand that bang a left hook going down.</v>

130
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 1>It was so insane and he walked off,</v>

131
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 1>walk off.</v>

132
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 1>It was a walk off knock out when he was dancing and he was pointing to his woman</v>

133
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:19.720
<v Speaker 1>in the audience and she was saying,</v>

134
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:20.381
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>

135
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:21.214
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

136
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing was a celebratory moment.</v>

137
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>And then the look on his face when he realized that Tyson fury gotten up.</v>

138
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:27.461
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

139
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:28.140
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

140
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

141
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:29.960
<v Speaker 1>you know what that is?</v>

143
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

144
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 1>remember the eighties and nineties,</v>

145
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.131
<v Speaker 1>the Friday,</v>

146
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:36.240
<v Speaker 1>the 13th movie when you killed Jason and then you turn around.</v>

147
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.491
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

148
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

149
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>That fries with a full setup.</v>

150
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>That's what that was.</v>

151
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 1>How does wilder punched so hard as a man who studied martial arts his whole</v>

152
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:45.230
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>

153
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some dudes,</v>

154
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

155
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think they have some frequent explosive power,</v>

156
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's crazy how much he's getting.</v>

157
00:03:52.771 --> 00:03:53.441
<v Speaker 1>He's only 200,</v>

158
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:54.274
<v Speaker 1>12 pounds.</v>

159
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>That's the crazy thing.</v>

160
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's very small for a heavyweight,</v>

161
00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.140
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of these guys to 50.</v>

162
00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

163
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 1>remember a guy named Mike Tyson?</v>

164
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:00.911
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

165
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>He was still like in the two fifteens,</v>

166
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

167
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.680
<v Speaker 1>He was like 2:15.</v>

168
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

169
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:05.001
<v Speaker 1>Not much.</v>

170
00:04:05.001 --> 00:04:05.834
<v Speaker 1>Taking truck.</v>

171
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.753
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

172
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how.</v>

173
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean I didn't have that kind of power,</v>

174
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 1>my knockouts with from like stuff you didn't see.</v>

175
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

176
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

177
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.391
<v Speaker 1>and quickness.</v>

178
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:15.650
<v Speaker 1>But like a guy like Jeremy Stevens.</v>

179
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like that,</v>

180
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

181
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Melvin Guillard had that kind of power.</v>

182
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.620
<v Speaker 1>How do you develop?</v>

183
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you could develop that.</v>

184
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:22.810
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a natural thing.</v>

185
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:23.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

186
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.351
<v Speaker 1>Rumble.</v>

187
00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Johnson type house.</v>

188
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

189
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

190
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.650
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

191
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Think you can develop that.</v>

192
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

193
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 1>I think you can accentuate it.</v>

194
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.930
<v Speaker 1>I think we got hit hard with better techniques and you hit harder.</v>

195
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a bone structure thing.</v>

196
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like if you look at a Deontae,</v>

197
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:40.280
<v Speaker 1>he's kinda built like a gigantic Tommy hearns.</v>

198
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

199
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

200
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.530
<v Speaker 1>just widen the shoulders and it's back just a fucking bundle of muscle ups.</v>

201
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.980
<v Speaker 1>It's just like those,</v>

202
00:04:48.981 --> 00:04:49.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

203
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.790
<v Speaker 1>those thick ass ropes that they use for,</v>

204
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.870
<v Speaker 1>for boats,</v>

205
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.861
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

206
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 1>When they more ships,</v>

207
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.740
<v Speaker 1>that's like the muscles in his back,</v>

208
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.330
<v Speaker 1>just jack back.</v>

209
00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 1>That's where the power comes from.</v>

210
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:03.460
<v Speaker 1>I guess you should let him body shot you fuck all that.</v>

211
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.960
<v Speaker 1>Fuck all that.</v>

212
00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:05.794
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

213
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.750
<v Speaker 1>That dude's a scary dude,</v>

214
00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:08.450
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

215
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

216
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.440
<v Speaker 1>He hits harder than anybody I think in recent memory,</v>

217
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.630
<v Speaker 1>like his one shot power.</v>

218
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.673
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

219
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:18.461
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

220
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean Tyson was a better boxer.</v>

221
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Pure boxer too.</v>

222
00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:22.900
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

223
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.810
<v Speaker 1>but like I would love to see like big power punches,</v>

224
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:26.170
<v Speaker 1>like hey,</v>

225
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.700
<v Speaker 1>they need to make a boxing game where they,</v>

226
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.250
<v Speaker 1>where they have all the guests.</v>

227
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.101
<v Speaker 1>They might have,</v>

228
00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:30.934
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

229
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.320
<v Speaker 1>but they need to have one where they have all the power punchers and power</v>

230
00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:36.210
<v Speaker 1>puncher point of it.</v>

231
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.233
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

232
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.451
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

233
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:37.781
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

234
00:05:37.781 --> 00:05:39.600
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's,</v>

235
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.130
<v Speaker 1>it was a perfect boxing match because you haven't Tyson fury.</v>

236
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.501
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

237
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:48.790
<v Speaker 1>you have this guy that overcame depression and suicidal thoughts and you know,</v>

238
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.320
<v Speaker 1>drug addiction and alcoholism and me.</v>

239
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.750
<v Speaker 1>He was just obesity.</v>

240
00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:53.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

241
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:54.820
<v Speaker 1>He was living in a world of depression,</v>

242
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:59.780
<v Speaker 1>he was just drinking constantly and doing coke and fucking his life up and then</v>

243
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 1>loses more than a hundred pounds.</v>

244
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Cleans himself up,</v>

245
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 1>gets in there against the scariest guy in the heavyweight division and puts on a</v>

246
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 1>boxing clinic.</v>

247
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

248
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 1>he still gets clipped.</v>

249
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 1>He still gets clipped not once,</v>

250
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 1>but twice hard and dropped hard,</v>

251
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 1>especially in the twelfth round.</v>

252
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.250
<v Speaker 1>So it's like for a person who loves watching fights,</v>

253
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 1>it's such a perfect fight because you've got.</v>

254
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.970
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

255
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.800
<v Speaker 1>they're both great guys,</v>

256
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

257
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.290
<v Speaker 1>like both guys like it.</v>

258
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.700
<v Speaker 1>If you're a fan of exceptional human beings,</v>

259
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.350
<v Speaker 1>both guys are great guys.</v>

260
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Like the more I see Deontay wilder interact with his family,</v>

261
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.090
<v Speaker 1>talk about things,</v>

262
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Speaker 1>talk about the way he approaches fighting,</v>

263
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.660
<v Speaker 1>the more I appreciate what he's doing,</v>

264
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.231
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

265
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:43.160
<v Speaker 1>And then Tyson Fury,</v>

266
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.031
<v Speaker 1>how do you not love the guy?</v>

267
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:48.470
<v Speaker 1>And the way they exchanged pleasantries after the fight was over and Tyson was</v>

268
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>telling me he loved him and he kissed his fucking fist.</v>

269
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:51.403
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

270
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.560
<v Speaker 1>it was a great all around a great feeling after,</v>

271
00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:55.490
<v Speaker 1>even though it was a draw,</v>

272
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 1>it was like I felt good about it.</v>

273
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>That was rocky one.</v>

274
00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 1>It was rocky one.</v>

275
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:00.610
<v Speaker 1>That's what that list was rocky.</v>

276
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 1>It was rocky one sort of.</v>

277
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

278
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.700
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't a slugger.</v>

279
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:05.534
<v Speaker 1>That one,</v>

280
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

281
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.320
<v Speaker 1>mean what it was was just a great.</v>

282
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Nobody won.</v>

283
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Nobody one in first one.</v>

284
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

285
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.113
<v Speaker 1>It was a great,</v>

286
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.370
<v Speaker 1>great boxing match.</v>

287
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.060
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

288
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.301
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

289
00:07:17.301 --> 00:07:18.740
<v Speaker 1>it had all the good elements.</v>

290
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.350
<v Speaker 1>It was the best heavyweight fight I've seen in a long time.</v>

291
00:07:21.351 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

292
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.780
<v Speaker 1>that might've been better than,</v>

293
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.280
<v Speaker 1>than Holyfield Tyson.</v>

294
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.950
<v Speaker 1>That's hard to say because know Holyfield was like the good guy coming in</v>

295
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:32.480
<v Speaker 1>against the bad guy.</v>

296
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Like there was so much to that fight.</v>

297
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:35.120
<v Speaker 1>And then with Tyson,</v>

298
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 1>like you thought he was invincible and then holy field just eating these shots</v>

299
00:07:39.171 --> 00:07:42.490
<v Speaker 1>and slowly beaten them down and then eventually stops them.</v>

300
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:43.980
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

301
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it's ear bitten was bite now.</v>

302
00:07:45.751 --> 00:07:46.610
<v Speaker 1>That was the second one.</v>

303
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Second fight.</v>

304
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.403
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

305
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:48.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

306
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:49.191
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

307
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:50.024
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

308
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.601
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

309
00:07:50.601 --> 00:07:50.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

310
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.651
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the best.</v>

311
00:07:51.651 --> 00:07:52.401
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what though,</v>

312
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:52.760
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

313
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.151
<v Speaker 1>anthony,</v>

314
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Joshua versus Klitschko was one of the best in a long time before that,</v>

315
00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

316
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:57.930
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

317
00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:00.470
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna go that fella into a fight.</v>

318
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:01.690
<v Speaker 1>Someone's gonna,</v>

319
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.500
<v Speaker 1>someone's gonna trick that fell into a fight.</v>

320
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.490
<v Speaker 1>I want to see those,</v>

321
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:04.931
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

322
00:08:04.931 --> 00:08:06.290
<v Speaker 1>that threeway mix,</v>

323
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:06.980
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

324
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:07.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

325
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I think Joshua better stay the fuck away from wilder.</v>

326
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.280
<v Speaker 1>If I had,</v>

327
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.720
<v Speaker 1>if I was in his corner,</v>

328
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.550
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

329
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.900
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

330
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.060
<v Speaker 1>you get hit sometimes.</v>

331
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.250
<v Speaker 1>He don't want to get it anytime by that guy.</v>

332
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

333
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:17.120
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

334
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.450
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

335
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:17.720
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

336
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to avoid it.</v>

337
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's got his head movement going now.</v>

338
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 1>I know he's waking up</v>

339
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.170
<v Speaker 1>just fucking bobbing and weaving.</v>

340
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like the dudes like that.</v>

341
00:08:29.361 --> 00:08:31.730
<v Speaker 1>The consequences of getting clipped are so great.</v>

342
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:32.720
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>

343
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.531
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting.</v>

344
00:08:33.531 --> 00:08:34.850
<v Speaker 1>When someone has that kind of power,</v>

345
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.390
<v Speaker 1>the consequences are just so great.</v>

346
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.800
<v Speaker 1>They're different than anybody else because you never stop watching.</v>

347
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.100
<v Speaker 1>You never stop watching that fight with Tyson fury.</v>

348
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean we saw the gap getting bigger in the points,</v>

349
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:47.990
<v Speaker 1>but then that knife round hit.</v>

350
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:48.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

351
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:49.760
<v Speaker 1>And he dropped him and he's like,</v>

352
00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:50.011
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

353
00:08:50.011 --> 00:08:53.060
<v Speaker 1>see he could still do it and you'll watch and watch and then the twelfth round</v>

354
00:08:53.061 --> 00:08:54.110
<v Speaker 1>he hit him and then you know,</v>

355
00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:55.290
<v Speaker 1>if your wildest fan like me,</v>

356
00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:56.320
<v Speaker 1>you're jumping up and you,</v>

357
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:57.600
<v Speaker 1>you're celebrating your,</v>

358
00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:57.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

359
00:08:57.921 --> 00:09:00.990
<v Speaker 1>your victory and then fucking Zombie gets out.</v>

360
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm so impressed.</v>

361
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Not only did he get up,</v>

362
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.290
<v Speaker 1>he won the remaining part of the round.</v>

363
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.610
<v Speaker 1>He stung wilder,</v>

364
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.110
<v Speaker 1>battled back off.</v>

365
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.540
<v Speaker 1>That can't.</v>

366
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Well I guess it could,</v>

367
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:18.720
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really happen in mma where somebody just gets destroyed or,</v>

368
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:23.490
<v Speaker 1>or dominate I guess in MMA would be like a bad beating in one round and then the</v>

369
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:25.350
<v Speaker 1>next round you'd come out and you just like fresh.</v>

370
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Because when he dropped him and when he get,</v>

371
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:27.171
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

372
00:09:27.171 --> 00:09:29.490
<v Speaker 1>when fury got up and he looked at him,</v>

373
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:29.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

374
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 1>he was a little bit broken,</v>

375
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:31.950
<v Speaker 1>but he's probably like,</v>

376
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:32.520
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

377
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:32.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna,</v>

378
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:33.630
<v Speaker 1>take this motherfucker out.</v>

379
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.880
<v Speaker 1>And then fury put it on him a little bit.</v>

380
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Probably not broke his spirit,</v>

381
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:41.190
<v Speaker 1>but it probably made him kind of shrink up a little bit.</v>

382
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Well he got lit.</v>

383
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:42.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

384
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 1>he definitely got stung,</v>

385
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.370
<v Speaker 1>he got cracked and you'll see him like his eyes rolled back.</v>

386
00:09:46.371 --> 00:09:48.780
<v Speaker 1>He backed off a little bit and then he grabbed a hold of Tyson.</v>

387
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:49.021
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

388
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:49.501
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

389
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:50.460
<v Speaker 1>He got rocked.</v>

390
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

391
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.030
<v Speaker 1>both guys are incredible good conditioning to.</v>

392
00:09:54.031 --> 00:09:54.271
<v Speaker 1>For,</v>

393
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:54.501
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

394
00:09:54.501 --> 00:09:54.801
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

395
00:09:54.801 --> 00:09:55.680
<v Speaker 1>for heavyweights.</v>

396
00:09:55.681 --> 00:09:56.051
<v Speaker 1>Immediate.</v>

397
00:09:56.051 --> 00:09:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

398
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.230
<v Speaker 1>For to take shots that late and that.</v>

399
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot about conditioning.</v>

400
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:01.681
<v Speaker 1>When you get tired,</v>

401
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:01.891
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

402
00:10:01.891 --> 00:10:02.191
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

403
00:10:02.191 --> 00:10:02.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

404
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:03.930
<v Speaker 1>your brain is ready to shut off.</v>

405
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

406
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.690
<v Speaker 1>And to be that big,</v>

407
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean six foot nine,</v>

408
00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:11.940
<v Speaker 1>256 pounds and still have that kind of conditioning,</v>

409
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:12.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

410
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:16.910
<v Speaker 1>and wilder to carry that knockout power in the twelfth after being frustrated</v>

411
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.260
<v Speaker 1>and just within a lot for fucking rounds.</v>

412
00:10:20.261 --> 00:10:21.180
<v Speaker 1>That exhausts you,</v>

413
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:21.811
<v Speaker 1>the punches,</v>

414
00:10:21.811 --> 00:10:22.410
<v Speaker 1>you miss those.</v>

415
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:23.370
<v Speaker 1>That takes so much off of.</v>

416
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:24.990
<v Speaker 1>You take so much.</v>

417
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

418
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

419
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.770
<v Speaker 1>It was just great all around.</v>

420
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.710
<v Speaker 1>It was just great.</v>

421
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:30.543
<v Speaker 1>What's the best?</v>

422
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.460
<v Speaker 1>What's the best boxing fight you can remember watching in your lifetime life?</v>

423
00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

424
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:35.551
<v Speaker 1>not in person,</v>

425
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:37.110
<v Speaker 1>but just watching it as it happens.</v>

426
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:37.831
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

427
00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:38.970
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

428
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.790
<v Speaker 1>I think Julio Cesar Chavez versus Meldrick Taylor,</v>

429
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.680
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people say that I didn't watch that one line because Taylor was so</v>

430
00:10:49.681 --> 00:10:50.460
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

431
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:55.460
<v Speaker 1>He was so fast and he was winning up until the twelfth round and Chavez just</v>

432
00:10:56.401 --> 00:10:57.510
<v Speaker 1>kept the pressure,</v>

433
00:10:57.511 --> 00:10:58.530
<v Speaker 1>kept the pressure,</v>

434
00:10:58.531 --> 00:10:59.490
<v Speaker 1>kept the pressure,</v>

435
00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:00.324
<v Speaker 1>kept the pressure,</v>

436
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.250
<v Speaker 1>and then eventually crack crack.</v>

437
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.600
<v Speaker 1>He had some of the big right hand.</v>

438
00:11:03.601 --> 00:11:04.291
<v Speaker 1>The twelfth round,</v>

439
00:11:04.291 --> 00:11:06.420
<v Speaker 1>you see Meldrick has just beaten down.</v>

440
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.850
<v Speaker 1>The downside of that fight is Meldrick.</v>

441
00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Taylor was never the same again.</v>

442
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

443
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.200
<v Speaker 1>That was one beating that just.</v>

444
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.700
<v Speaker 1>He crossed over beyond the Pale and went to the dark lands.</v>

445
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:19.250
<v Speaker 1>It's just not good after that fight.</v>

446
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:19.851
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

447
00:11:19.851 --> 00:11:21.180
<v Speaker 1>what do you think if a.</v>

448
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.420
<v Speaker 1>was it Richard Steele was rough.</v>

449
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.240
<v Speaker 1>I think it was.</v>

450
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:29.240
<v Speaker 1>So steel doesn't start that fight in those last seconds and Meldrick Taylor wins</v>

451
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.490
<v Speaker 1>on the cards then.</v>

452
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Then what happens is their rematch and does he look the same as he?</v>

453
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Was He the same guy after that?</v>

454
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.880
<v Speaker 1>I think if he wins the match,</v>

455
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:41.670
<v Speaker 1>he's done.</v>

456
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.020
<v Speaker 1>He's done no matter what.</v>

457
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Remember when Terry talked about after that he just did not look like he could</v>

458
00:11:47.431 --> 00:11:48.450
<v Speaker 1>take a punch anymore.</v>

459
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.400
<v Speaker 1>That fight was so brutal.</v>

460
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.350
<v Speaker 1>If you watch that fight against Chavez,</v>

461
00:11:52.351 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 1>just raking his</v>

462
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.150
<v Speaker 2>body and clip them,</v>

463
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.480
<v Speaker 2>but meldrick was just so fast and so skillful,</v>

464
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.460
<v Speaker 2>like his movement and his speed,</v>

465
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.160
<v Speaker 2>but Chavez was just relentless,</v>

466
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.600
<v Speaker 2>was a great fight.</v>

467
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Elizah great fight,</v>

468
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:06.940
<v Speaker 2>but watched it after the fact.</v>

469
00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.230
<v Speaker 2>But there's a few of those fights where you know that that was the one where the</v>

470
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.480
<v Speaker 2>guy's never going to be the same again.</v>

471
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:13.343
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

472
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:14.051
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

473
00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:14.321
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

474
00:12:14.321 --> 00:12:15.880
<v Speaker 2>you felt that way watching it?</v>

475
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.240
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

476
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.380
<v Speaker 2>I felt that way afterwards.</v>

477
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:18.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean watching it,</v>

478
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:18.880
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

479
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.713
<v Speaker 2>what a great fight,</v>

480
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.900
<v Speaker 2>but then afterwards you realize like,</v>

481
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.241
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

482
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:23.074
<v Speaker 2>that was it.</v>

483
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.920
<v Speaker 2>That was the fight.</v>

484
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.320
<v Speaker 2>I kind of felt that way honestly for MMA.</v>

485
00:12:26.321 --> 00:12:31.321
<v Speaker 2>I felt that way about rory after the Roy Robbie fight who wonderboy and I was</v>

486
00:12:32.381 --> 00:12:32.561
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

487
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:32.681
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

488
00:12:32.681 --> 00:12:33.550
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't look the same.</v>

489
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:34.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

490
00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.850
<v Speaker 2>I think he was having real problems with his nose.</v>

491
00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:37.933
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

492
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.950
<v Speaker 2>his nose has been shattered a bunch of times and he just can't take a shot at it</v>

493
00:12:41.951 --> 00:12:42.640
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

494
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.230
<v Speaker 2>It just starts bleeding really bad,</v>

495
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:48.880
<v Speaker 2>but I think physically the way he moves and his ability to take punches is still</v>

496
00:12:48.881 --> 00:12:49.720
<v Speaker 2>exactly the same.</v>

497
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.770
<v Speaker 2>Like you saw him in the Lima file.</v>

498
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.440
<v Speaker 2>It looks good still.</v>

499
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:53.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

500
00:12:53.651 --> 00:12:54.280
<v Speaker 2>he does.</v>

501
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.240
<v Speaker 2>He fucked up taking them.</v>

502
00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:56.260
<v Speaker 2>We saucy fight though.</v>

503
00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

504
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.810
<v Speaker 2>that's us too big to too big.</v>

505
00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I thought the same thing to,</v>

506
00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:00.790
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

507
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.361
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

508
00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have a lot of similar sales skill sets and then the bigger guy,</v>

509
00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:07.300
<v Speaker 2>it's like what's the saucy?</v>

510
00:13:07.301 --> 00:13:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Might be a little better to striking.</v>

511
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.670
<v Speaker 2>Definitely better with a striking his grounds.</v>

512
00:13:12.671 --> 00:13:13.510
<v Speaker 2>No joke either.</v>

513
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

514
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:15.700
<v Speaker 2>Massage is just so good,</v>

515
00:13:15.701 --> 00:13:16.030
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

516
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.770
<v Speaker 2>He's so good that like if I was in his corner of billet,</v>

517
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:19.060
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

518
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:19.661
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>

519
00:13:19.661 --> 00:13:20.520
<v Speaker 2>You want to do a superfight?</v>

520
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:21.610
<v Speaker 2>I want to do a challenge.</v>

521
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.430
<v Speaker 2>These guys quite a bit bigger than you and really,</v>

522
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.750
<v Speaker 2>really fucking good.</v>

523
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:26.660
<v Speaker 2>Like when you started,</v>

524
00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.493
<v Speaker 2>you might be the best one.</v>

525
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.930
<v Speaker 2>80 five are in the world.</v>

526
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Thinks that he's not.</v>

527
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:31.241
<v Speaker 2>If he's not easy,</v>

528
00:13:31.241 --> 00:13:31.931
<v Speaker 2>he's there.</v>

529
00:13:31.931 --> 00:13:32.800
<v Speaker 2>He's with whitaker,</v>

530
00:13:32.801 --> 00:13:33.730
<v Speaker 2>he's with Joelle.</v>

531
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:34.623
<v Speaker 2>He's there.</v>

532
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:34.910
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

533
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:35.150
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

534
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:36.190
<v Speaker 2>There's a mix of them.</v>

535
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:36.881
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

536
00:13:36.881 --> 00:13:37.720
<v Speaker 2>really like.</v>

537
00:13:37.721 --> 00:13:41.020
<v Speaker 2>I have a whole lot of confidence in whitaker to quietly.</v>

538
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:44.350
<v Speaker 2>He just kind of rose up to the top and I think people still sleep on him.</v>

539
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.340
<v Speaker 2>I think so too,</v>

540
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:50.370
<v Speaker 2>but I got to say that I was surprised at the decision in the Yoel Romero fight</v>

541
00:13:51.191 --> 00:13:51.800
<v Speaker 2>the second one.</v>

542
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

543
00:13:52.211 --> 00:13:52.450
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

544
00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.160
<v Speaker 2>I think Romero won that fight.</v>

545
00:13:54.161 --> 00:13:54.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

546
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.840
<v Speaker 2>Or if not one it.</v>

547
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:56.950
<v Speaker 2>It was so close.</v>

548
00:13:56.951 --> 00:13:57.880
<v Speaker 2>It had to be a draw.</v>

549
00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.620
<v Speaker 2>It was so fucking close.</v>

550
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.930
<v Speaker 2>But I think Romero did way more damage Ramiro.</v>

551
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:03.530
<v Speaker 2>See?</v>

552
00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:04.330
<v Speaker 2>He heard him a couple times.</v>

553
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Think about like the wild or fight.</v>

554
00:14:06.041 --> 00:14:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Like someone said to me like,</v>

555
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.241
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

556
00:14:07.241 --> 00:14:08.770
<v Speaker 2>the score cards are all fucked up.</v>

557
00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Tyson fury should have one.</v>

558
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:11.291
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

559
00:14:11.291 --> 00:14:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

560
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.191
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

561
00:14:12.191 --> 00:14:14.800
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying if you're looking at it in terms of like that.</v>

562
00:14:14.801 --> 00:14:17.800
<v Speaker 2>But as a person who knows what a fight is,</v>

563
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.800
<v Speaker 2>wilder clearly won the fight.</v>

564
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.090
<v Speaker 2>If it was a fight.</v>

565
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:22.780
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

566
00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.650
<v Speaker 2>Who's getting fucked up right in the school yard where the one that he won.</v>

567
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:27.131
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

568
00:14:27.131 --> 00:14:29.140
<v Speaker 2>And this is the Yoel Romero whittaker thing.</v>

569
00:14:29.141 --> 00:14:29.980
<v Speaker 2>Who won the fight?</v>

570
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.450
<v Speaker 2>Whitaker's getting,</v>

571
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

572
00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.170
<v Speaker 2>just he got hit with bombs by Joelle.</v>

573
00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:39.490
<v Speaker 2>Joelle hit him with some fucking haymakers and whitaker survive,</v>

574
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.720
<v Speaker 2>but when it could never put you well in that same sort of situation where you're</v>

575
00:14:42.721 --> 00:14:45.340
<v Speaker 2>well with staggering around like really badly hurt me.</v>

576
00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.080
<v Speaker 2>You Whitaker is a champ.</v>

577
00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:48.573
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

578
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:48.970
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

579
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:49.960
<v Speaker 2>the skills,</v>

580
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:50.681
<v Speaker 2>the heart,</v>

581
00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:51.291
<v Speaker 2>the courage,</v>

582
00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:52.124
<v Speaker 2>all those things.</v>

583
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's got everything.</v>

584
00:14:53.151 --> 00:14:54.050
<v Speaker 2>He's a champ,</v>

585
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.380
<v Speaker 2>but I felt like the damage done.</v>

586
00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.870
<v Speaker 2>I hate the 10 point muscles.</v>

587
00:14:58.950 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

588
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.040
<v Speaker 2>I hate it.</v>

589
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:02.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean so stupid.</v>

590
00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.213
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

591
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.510
<v Speaker 2>A five minute rounds you'll using 10 points.</v>

592
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:06.110
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

593
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:07.160
<v Speaker 2>Because it was already there.</v>

594
00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.241
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

595
00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:08.481
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

596
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:11.780
<v Speaker 2>that's the big thing for me because I mean we got aspects of Jujitsu,</v>

597
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.800
<v Speaker 2>got aspects of wrestling.</v>

598
00:15:12.801 --> 00:15:15.320
<v Speaker 2>We've got aspects of striking boxing and kickboxing.</v>

599
00:15:15.321 --> 00:15:16.070
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

600
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:21.070
<v Speaker 2>And we're using a rule set from boxing only one set of weapons.</v>

601
00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.140
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

602
00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.600
<v Speaker 2>And like how does that,</v>

603
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.570
<v Speaker 2>how does that quantify the takedowns and the grappling exchanges?</v>

604
00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:27.404
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>

605
00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.010
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

606
00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:28.843
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

607
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:29.250
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

608
00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:30.060
<v Speaker 2>I disagree.</v>

609
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.310
<v Speaker 2>I remember there were,</v>

610
00:15:31.311 --> 00:15:34.550
<v Speaker 2>they had all these different systems they were trying to work and I feel like at</v>

611
00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:38.390
<v Speaker 2>one point I think doc rivers maybe had Campbellton thought Hamilton.</v>

612
00:15:38.391 --> 00:15:38.661
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

613
00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:38.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

614
00:15:38.801 --> 00:15:39.940
<v Speaker 2>he does basketball,</v>

615
00:15:39.941 --> 00:15:41.880
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

616
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.580
<v Speaker 2>doc Hamilton has an excellent system.</v>

617
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.250
<v Speaker 2>Was that half point system right?</v>

618
00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Which was better,</v>

619
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.950
<v Speaker 2>was better than what we're using now.</v>

620
00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.270
<v Speaker 2>The pride system was better.</v>

621
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:50.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

622
00:15:50.631 --> 00:15:51.580
<v Speaker 2>The system is better.</v>

623
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.500
<v Speaker 2>Chose to fight as a whole and the last part of the fight is more important than</v>

624
00:15:54.501 --> 00:15:55.334
<v Speaker 2>the first Friday of the fight.</v>

625
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.850
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

626
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:58.340
<v Speaker 2>Because that kind of tells you the path that we're going on a school yard,</v>

627
00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:58.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

628
00:15:58.730 --> 00:15:59.480
<v Speaker 2>Who's on top?</v>

629
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.380
<v Speaker 2>Who's on top of the teachers get there was beating the dude down.</v>

630
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:02.991
<v Speaker 2>The teachers get there.</v>

631
00:16:02.991 --> 00:16:06.860
<v Speaker 2>Nobody cares if you like throw a leg kicks and boxing the guy up for 15 minutes</v>

632
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.920
<v Speaker 2>and then the teachers come right when the guy gets on top of you and punching</v>

633
00:16:09.921 --> 00:16:10.281
<v Speaker 2>your face.</v>

634
00:16:10.281 --> 00:16:11.270
<v Speaker 2>And I want the decision.</v>

635
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:11.960
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

636
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.071
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

637
00:16:12.071 --> 00:16:12.221
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

638
00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:12.380
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

639
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:12.591
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

640
00:16:12.591 --> 00:16:15.880
<v Speaker 2>The teachers pull that guy off you and then you get rebounds.</v>

641
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:17.660
<v Speaker 2>Rematches in school.</v>

642
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:19.580
<v Speaker 2>Fucking hard to swallow.</v>

643
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.620
<v Speaker 2>You gotta you gotTa have balls,</v>

644
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:22.710
<v Speaker 2>so that rematch in school.</v>

645
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

646
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:27.363
<v Speaker 2>No money.</v>

647
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:28.923
<v Speaker 2>All Glory.</v>

648
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.020
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

649
00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:30.850
<v Speaker 2>this has got to be right.</v>

650
00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.060
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be a rematch for this fight.</v>

651
00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.980
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be the biggest heavyweight fighter of all time.</v>

652
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:34.521
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

653
00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:39.300
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be Gi fucking antic and I'm happy for wilder because while</v>

654
00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:40.430
<v Speaker 2>there is finally a star,</v>

655
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean forever.</v>

656
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:44.270
<v Speaker 2>We wanted an American heavyweight champion.</v>

657
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.133
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

658
00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Klitschko had it forever.</v>

659
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.590
<v Speaker 2>Now we have not only an American heavyweight champion,</v>

660
00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.670
<v Speaker 2>but we had an American every week,</v>

661
00:16:49.671 --> 00:16:50.490
<v Speaker 2>championed the knocks.</v>

662
00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:52.250
<v Speaker 2>Everybody the fuck out,</v>

663
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.690
<v Speaker 2>knocks everybody the fuck out.</v>

664
00:16:53.691 --> 00:16:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Super exciting.</v>

665
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:55.543
<v Speaker 2>Great Guy.</v>

666
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.560
<v Speaker 2>For some reason he didn't catch like.</v>

667
00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.200
<v Speaker 2>It's weird like who catches who gets famous?</v>

668
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.130
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

669
00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:04.940
<v Speaker 2>But then when you look at the post fight interviews and I'm Tyson Fury,</v>

670
00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:05.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

671
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.471
<v Speaker 2>God bless me.</v>

672
00:17:06.471 --> 00:17:08.120
<v Speaker 2>God bless you and God bless America.</v>

673
00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:09.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean he got a lot of people on his side.</v>

674
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:10.670
<v Speaker 2>He's not American.</v>

675
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:11.750
<v Speaker 2>He's a good guy.</v>

676
00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:13.190
<v Speaker 2>I him in here.</v>

677
00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:14.230
<v Speaker 2>He's great.</v>

678
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

679
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.320
<v Speaker 2>he's a real character.</v>

680
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.303
<v Speaker 2>He's the real deal.</v>

681
00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.121
<v Speaker 2>Both of them are.</v>

682
00:17:17.121 --> 00:17:17.331
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

683
00:17:17.331 --> 00:17:20.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking so excited about the rematch when you think that happens.</v>

684
00:17:20.931 --> 00:17:21.890
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be a long time.</v>

685
00:17:21.891 --> 00:17:23.230
<v Speaker 2>He got hit with some bombs.</v>

686
00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:24.670
<v Speaker 2>If I was in Tyson's camp up,</v>

687
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:24.861
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

688
00:17:24.861 --> 00:17:29.840
<v Speaker 2>do we got to take some time off so I know you feel great and you're riding this</v>

689
00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:30.290
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>

690
00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:32.390
<v Speaker 2>How about the guy donates all his money to charity?</v>

691
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:33.651
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that incredible?</v>

692
00:17:33.651 --> 00:17:35.390
<v Speaker 2>That's just ridiculously incredible.</v>

693
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:36.950
<v Speaker 2>$10,000,000.</v>

694
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.010
<v Speaker 2>$10,000,000 just donated.</v>

695
00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.190
<v Speaker 2>Is he going to do that in the rematch?</v>

696
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Rematch is $100,000,000</v>

697
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:45.453
<v Speaker 2>deficit.</v>

698
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:47.360
<v Speaker 2>Floyd mayweather money,</v>

699
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:47.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

700
00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.670
<v Speaker 2>The rematch could be the biggest heavyweight title fight ever.</v>

701
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.533
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

702
00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

703
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:52.351
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

704
00:17:52.351 --> 00:17:52.681
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

705
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:54.690
<v Speaker 2>it's bigger than right now,</v>

706
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:55.710
<v Speaker 2>especially with the world,</v>

707
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.441
<v Speaker 2>the way the world is.</v>

708
00:17:56.441 --> 00:17:58.110
<v Speaker 2>It's bigger than totally feel Tyson.</v>

709
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.380
<v Speaker 2>It's bigger than you.</v>

710
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.700
<v Speaker 2>It's bigger than Holyfield Tyson and think or right there,</v>

711
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.020
<v Speaker 2>at least right there.</v>

712
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.680
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to say because Tyson was such a cultural phenomenon,</v>

713
00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:11.370
<v Speaker 2>like there was no one like him when we're kids and when Tyson would fight,</v>

714
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.390
<v Speaker 2>it would just be like,</v>

715
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:12.571
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

716
00:18:12.571 --> 00:18:16.140
<v Speaker 2>watching a public executions and people would wonder,</v>

717
00:18:16.141 --> 00:18:17.130
<v Speaker 2>should I pay for this?</v>

718
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.530
<v Speaker 2>Should I get this pay per view?</v>

719
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.010
<v Speaker 2>How long is it going to last?</v>

720
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.670
<v Speaker 2>Have a bunch of people over popcorn and shit and it lasts 15 seconds.</v>

721
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:24.251
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

722
00:18:24.251 --> 00:18:24.990
<v Speaker 2>what do you think?</v>

723
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:29.990
<v Speaker 2>What do you think the benefit of while they're having Tyson come into his next</v>

724
00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:31.110
<v Speaker 2>camp?</v>

725
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.300
<v Speaker 2>Is Tyson him and he's a student now.</v>

726
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.520
<v Speaker 2>He knows boxing well.</v>

727
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:36.503
<v Speaker 2>Is he doing that?</v>

728
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:37.583
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

729
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.150
<v Speaker 2>But what would the benefit be?</v>

730
00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:40.830
<v Speaker 2>Looked at the benefit would be great.</v>

731
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Mark Tyson knows a lot about boxing.</v>

732
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean he doesn't just know a lot about how he boxed the history,</v>

733
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:48.751
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

734
00:18:48.751 --> 00:18:48.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

735
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.040
<v Speaker 2>he knows so much.</v>

736
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was like one of the big things.</v>

737
00:18:52.741 --> 00:18:53.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

738
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:58.010
<v Speaker 2>one of the big stories about his childhood was him watching Jim Jacobs old reel</v>

739
00:18:59.761 --> 00:19:01.700
<v Speaker 2>to reel films that wash up.</v>

740
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:04.380
<v Speaker 2>He'd watch all those old school films.</v>

741
00:19:04.381 --> 00:19:06.780
<v Speaker 2>Joe Lewis and Shit and Jack Dempsey,</v>

742
00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:07.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

743
00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:07.560
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

744
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.100
<v Speaker 2>he liked pattern a lot of his style after watching those old timers.</v>

745
00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:12.940
<v Speaker 2>Archie Moore and yeah,</v>

746
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:13.621
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think,</v>

747
00:19:13.621 --> 00:19:14.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

748
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.930
<v Speaker 2>he could definitely help them I think.</v>

749
00:19:15.931 --> 00:19:20.510
<v Speaker 2>But the style of someone who could help wilder would,</v>

750
00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:25.560
<v Speaker 2>would be someone who is going to incorporate more movement and and more like</v>

751
00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:28.403
<v Speaker 2>switch up.</v>

752
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.190
<v Speaker 2>Like don't always throw a bomb.</v>

753
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.160
<v Speaker 2>You know who I would bring in files,</v>

754
00:19:32.161 --> 00:19:32.994
<v Speaker 2>wilder,</v>

755
00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:33.893
<v Speaker 2>Andre Ward,</v>

756
00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.090
<v Speaker 2>Andre Ward and Virgil Hill.</v>

757
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.700
<v Speaker 2>Have those guys tighten up what he does.</v>

758
00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.930
<v Speaker 2>I think Andre Ward is one of the smartest guys in boxing.</v>

759
00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:42.380
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

760
00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.290
<v Speaker 2>how is he as a,</v>

761
00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:44.071
<v Speaker 2>as an instructor,</v>

762
00:19:44.071 --> 00:19:44.850
<v Speaker 2>as a teacher?</v>

763
00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.890
<v Speaker 2>He's too fucking smart to not be good at it.</v>

764
00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.180
<v Speaker 2>He's too smart.</v>

765
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.620
<v Speaker 2>He knows too much about boxing.</v>

766
00:19:49.621 --> 00:19:52.950
<v Speaker 2>Like he's one of my favorite analysts when he talks about fights,</v>

767
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:54.660
<v Speaker 2>like the way he breaks things down.</v>

768
00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

769
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:55.441
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

770
00:19:55.441 --> 00:19:55.661
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

771
00:19:55.661 --> 00:20:00.120
<v Speaker 2>and he's a guy who really does find weaknesses and exploit them.</v>

772
00:20:00.121 --> 00:20:04.180
<v Speaker 2>It's not just pushing buttons and throwing haymakers like if you look at his</v>

773
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:05.400
<v Speaker 2>rematch with Cova level,</v>

774
00:20:05.401 --> 00:20:06.870
<v Speaker 2>like he figured that fucking guy out.</v>

775
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:07.651
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>

776
00:20:07.651 --> 00:20:10.290
<v Speaker 2>he got hurt by him early in the first fight,</v>

777
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.570
<v Speaker 2>but then one the remainder of the fight.</v>

778
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.200
<v Speaker 2>And then one of the decision a little bit controversial but then said,</v>

779
00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:16.530
<v Speaker 2>I know how to beat this motherfucker.</v>

780
00:20:16.531 --> 00:20:18.260
<v Speaker 2>And then came back and the second fight and stopped him.</v>

781
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.133
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

782
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:19.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

783
00:20:19.561 --> 00:20:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Andre Ward is and Virgil Hill.</v>

784
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.153
<v Speaker 2>That's old school.</v>

785
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Old School.</v>

786
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

787
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:24.990
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

788
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.280
<v Speaker 2>that would be a good fit.</v>

789
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:28.230
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot of good fits in boxing.</v>

790
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Boxing is an interesting thing is that they've had this long history of trial</v>

791
00:20:34.891 --> 00:20:36.040
<v Speaker 2>and error that,</v>

792
00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:38.160
<v Speaker 2>that MMA hasn't had,</v>

793
00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:38.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

794
00:20:38.851 --> 00:20:39.780
<v Speaker 2>like you see,</v>

795
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.010
<v Speaker 2>you see this,</v>

796
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:41.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

797
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.490
<v Speaker 2>you got lineage that goes back to the sixties and seventies.</v>

798
00:20:44.491 --> 00:20:46.620
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

799
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:47.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

800
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:48.050
<v Speaker 2>goes back</v>

801
00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:48.883
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

802
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

803
00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.540
<v Speaker 1>I really pap.</v>

804
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

805
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean in terms of like active trainers.</v>

806
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

807
00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.970
<v Speaker 1>And active gems,</v>

808
00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:56.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

809
00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean these guys had been around for forever.</v>

810
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:04.140
<v Speaker 1>They've been putting champions into rings for decades and there's a lot of those</v>

811
00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:05.014
<v Speaker 1>guys out there.</v>

812
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:05.681
<v Speaker 1>I think about.</v>

813
00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:07.600
<v Speaker 1>I think about that too with like with Tyson.</v>

814
00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:10.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean like if customer auto didn't die when he did,</v>

815
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.120
<v Speaker 1>would tyson's career have been different?</v>

816
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Probably would have that.</v>

817
00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.180
<v Speaker 1>It probably would have been different.</v>

818
00:21:16.181 --> 00:21:16.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

819
00:21:16.391 --> 00:21:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I think Kevin Rooney did his best to try to keep that teaching going.</v>

820
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:20.141
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

821
00:21:20.141 --> 00:21:20.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

822
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:25.210
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes that mentor is the glue that keeps you together.</v>

823
00:21:25.211 --> 00:21:25.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

824
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.780
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm talking about.</v>

825
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

826
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.910
<v Speaker 1>The other stuff,</v>

827
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:32.230
<v Speaker 1>that guy meant so much to Tyson because custom model essentially gave him this</v>

828
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:33.400
<v Speaker 1>new lease on life.</v>

829
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.250
<v Speaker 1>He thought he was going to be a loser and his life is going to be hell.</v>

830
00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.370
<v Speaker 1>And then instead he's the heavyweight champion of the world,</v>

831
00:21:39.371 --> 00:21:40.270
<v Speaker 1>the youngest ever,</v>

832
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:41.583
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

833
00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.010
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>

834
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

835
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

836
00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:44.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

837
00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Teddy Atlas had a very,</v>

838
00:21:46.301 --> 00:21:47.950
<v Speaker 1>very interesting take on Tyson.</v>

839
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.980
<v Speaker 1>He just felt like Tyson never developed the skills to overcome adversity.</v>

840
00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.840
<v Speaker 1>So as long as he was dominating everyone who was great,</v>

841
00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.700
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as it started coming back and him,</v>

842
00:21:57.701 --> 00:21:57.940
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>

843
00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.320
<v Speaker 1>he would never recover from that.</v>

844
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.591
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

845
00:21:59.591 --> 00:22:03.520
<v Speaker 1>we call that Nima me the bully or a front runner.</v>

846
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.433
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

847
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

848
00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:05.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of guys like that,</v>

849
00:22:05.711 --> 00:22:06.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

850
00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

851
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:07.303
<v Speaker 1>And good on top.</v>

852
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

853
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:08.681
<v Speaker 1>They're good.</v>

854
00:22:08.681 --> 00:22:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Hammer.</v>

855
00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Not such a good nail.</v>

856
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

857
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.640
<v Speaker 1>You got to be able to take them both.</v>

858
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:13.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

859
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:14.380
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

860
00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.600
<v Speaker 1>when you say hammer and nail every reminds me of like,</v>

861
00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:18.970
<v Speaker 1>there was something I was thinking when we're talking about rory and Robbie,</v>

862
00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.230
<v Speaker 1>like would,</v>

863
00:22:20.231 --> 00:22:24.640
<v Speaker 1>it takes how much pain you have to be in to be a fighter,</v>

864
00:22:24.641 --> 00:22:28.570
<v Speaker 1>to be a fun of Roy's caliber and then just sit down and concede.</v>

865
00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

866
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Because like it hurts that much.</v>

867
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.130
<v Speaker 1>I think his face was shattered.</v>

868
00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.760
<v Speaker 1>His nose was broken into eight or nine pieces or some shit like that.</v>

869
00:22:36.761 --> 00:22:37.240
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

870
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.740
<v Speaker 1>it was just mush and I just don't think he physically could go on anymore.</v>

871
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:42.461
<v Speaker 1>Like I've had.</v>

872
00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:42.970
<v Speaker 1>I've had,</v>

873
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:44.050
<v Speaker 1>I've had breaks in training,</v>

874
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:45.370
<v Speaker 1>either breaks in and fights.</v>

875
00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

876
00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:47.160
<v Speaker 1>broke my jaw one's training.</v>

877
00:22:47.161 --> 00:22:47.440
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

878
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:47.591
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

879
00:22:47.591 --> 00:22:48.150
<v Speaker 1>that hurts.</v>

880
00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

881
00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.331
<v Speaker 1>and then I got hit again.</v>

882
00:22:49.331 --> 00:22:49.571
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

883
00:22:49.571 --> 00:22:49.661
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

884
00:22:49.661 --> 00:22:50.494
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this.</v>

885
00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.493
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm just.</v>

886
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Was it a clean snap?</v>

887
00:22:53.201 --> 00:22:53.461
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

888
00:22:53.461 --> 00:22:54.130
<v Speaker 1>it's just a,</v>

889
00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:55.150
<v Speaker 1>a hairline.</v>

890
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.051
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

891
00:22:56.051 --> 00:22:56.590
<v Speaker 1>it hurt,</v>

892
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:57.910
<v Speaker 1>like I couldn't chew.</v>

893
00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.410
<v Speaker 1>I was crying the next day.</v>

894
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know is broken until the next day.</v>

895
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:02.590
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

896
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:03.920
<v Speaker 1>and then when I fly out,</v>

897
00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Ludwig and bang,</v>

898
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.130
<v Speaker 1>and I thought I was on top,</v>

899
00:23:06.131 --> 00:23:06.761
<v Speaker 1>he was on his back.</v>

900
00:23:06.761 --> 00:23:07.900
<v Speaker 1>He feels a punch upwards,</v>

901
00:23:07.901 --> 00:23:12.100
<v Speaker 1>hits me right in the eyeball and bust my orbital.</v>

902
00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:12.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

903
00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:14.080
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about this the last time you were here?</v>

904
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:14.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

905
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.270
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy when he hit me though,</v>

906
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.313
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

907
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:18.280
<v Speaker 1>that hurts.</v>

908
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:18.491
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

909
00:23:18.491 --> 00:23:20.080
<v Speaker 1>I put my head down for a second and I was like,</v>

910
00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.340
<v Speaker 1>I got to tap this guy at a tap,</v>

911
00:23:21.341 --> 00:23:21.611
<v Speaker 1>this guy.</v>

912
00:23:21.611 --> 00:23:26.050
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just trying to institute a Jujitsu game and um,</v>

913
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:27.490
<v Speaker 1>he's escaping all the time.</v>

914
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.540
<v Speaker 1>But the pain,</v>

915
00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:28.991
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

916
00:23:28.991 --> 00:23:33.790
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like I went out for Laurie to sit down and concede like I can only</v>

917
00:23:33.791 --> 00:23:37.450
<v Speaker 1>imagine because I've been in pain and a fight like excruciating pain is like,</v>

918
00:23:37.451 --> 00:23:39.340
<v Speaker 1>I just got to figure this out and move on.</v>

919
00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:40.421
<v Speaker 1>But he was just like,</v>

920
00:23:40.421 --> 00:23:40.631
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

921
00:23:40.631 --> 00:23:41.464
<v Speaker 1>that's enough.</v>

922
00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.270
<v Speaker 1>And it's rory.</v>

923
00:23:43.271 --> 00:23:44.290
<v Speaker 1>We know how tough he is.</v>

924
00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:45.620
<v Speaker 1>He's also crazy.</v>

925
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:46.161
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

926
00:23:46.161 --> 00:23:47.090
<v Speaker 1>this is a dude who he,</v>

927
00:23:47.091 --> 00:23:47.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

928
00:23:47.571 --> 00:23:48.404
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

929
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.600
<v Speaker 1>you just kind of expect him to have bodies</v>

930
00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.013
<v Speaker 1>bodies on it.</v>

931
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Did you see him when he was on a podcast?</v>

932
00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:56.361
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

933
00:23:56.361 --> 00:23:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

934
00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:57.620
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see that.</v>

935
00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.240
<v Speaker 1>He's not like you would think he is.</v>

936
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.270
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy.</v>

937
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:00.640
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>

938
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.311
<v Speaker 1>He's like very,</v>

939
00:24:01.311 --> 00:24:03.260
<v Speaker 1>like warm and friendly is awesome.</v>

940
00:24:03.261 --> 00:24:03.950
<v Speaker 1>I sat on it,</v>

941
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:07.160
<v Speaker 1>sat with sat next to him on the bus a bunch of different times and we were just</v>

942
00:24:07.161 --> 00:24:07.994
<v Speaker 1>writing to their arena.</v>

943
00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.340
<v Speaker 1>We've had a bunch of conversations.</v>

944
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:09.861
<v Speaker 1>I love him,</v>

945
00:24:09.861 --> 00:24:10.694
<v Speaker 1>but when you see his,</v>

946
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.450
<v Speaker 1>his demeanor or his persona when he,</v>

947
00:24:13.451 --> 00:24:13.920
<v Speaker 1>when he's,</v>

948
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:14.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

949
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.350
<v Speaker 1>in front of the camera,</v>

950
00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:17.060
<v Speaker 1>he just seems very</v>

951
00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:20.540
<v Speaker 1>serious,</v>

952
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.320
<v Speaker 1>very serious.</v>

953
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.700
<v Speaker 1>And that killer,</v>

954
00:24:22.701 --> 00:24:24.230
<v Speaker 1>like serial killer.</v>

955
00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.393
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>

956
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.510
<v Speaker 1>He's not done either.</v>

957
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:29.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think the fight was a bad idea,</v>

958
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:32.300
<v Speaker 1>but I still think he's one of the best welterweights on the planet and 100</v>

959
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:33.260
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>

960
00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:33.740
<v Speaker 1>100 years.</v>

961
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:34.573
<v Speaker 1>I mean he can come,</v>

962
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:35.990
<v Speaker 1>he can come back to the UFC and.</v>

963
00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.430
<v Speaker 1>And threatened tyron.</v>

964
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

965
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:39.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

966
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:40.730
<v Speaker 1>he beat tired when the first time,</v>

967
00:24:40.731 --> 00:24:41.511
<v Speaker 1>but that's a different.</v>

968
00:24:41.511 --> 00:24:42.110
<v Speaker 1>Tyron,</v>

969
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:45.530
<v Speaker 1>tyron with Duke Roufus is a different time and I think,</v>

970
00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:46.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

971
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.090
<v Speaker 1>he's just,</v>

972
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:48.380
<v Speaker 1>he knows more now.</v>

973
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:49.610
<v Speaker 1>He's a champion now.</v>

974
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.240
<v Speaker 1>He successfully defended his title several times and he's much better too.</v>

975
00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.133
<v Speaker 1>He's um,</v>

976
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.860
<v Speaker 1>he's still slows later in the fight,</v>

977
00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:58.790
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

978
00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.890
<v Speaker 1>it's drastically different than it used to be.</v>

979
00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:02.043
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

980
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:07.210
<v Speaker 1>and once what I would like to see out of Tyron is more use of all of his skills</v>

981
00:25:08.211 --> 00:25:13.211
<v Speaker 1>later on and not just looking at land that big right hand because like tyron can</v>

982
00:25:13.341 --> 00:25:14.174
<v Speaker 1>do everything,</v>

983
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.680
<v Speaker 1>tyron can do everything,</v>

984
00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:19.490
<v Speaker 1>but there are those times when you see him start to really depend on that right</v>

985
00:25:19.491 --> 00:25:20.600
<v Speaker 1>hand and only look for that.</v>

986
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.501
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

987
00:25:21.501 --> 00:25:22.760
<v Speaker 1>he's like right hand,</v>

988
00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:23.743
<v Speaker 1>right hand,</v>

989
00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:24.711
<v Speaker 1>right hand,</v>

990
00:25:24.711 --> 00:25:25.191
<v Speaker 1>right hand,</v>

991
00:25:25.191 --> 00:25:25.670
<v Speaker 1>right hand.</v>

992
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.340
<v Speaker 1>The thing about that right hand though is it works</v>

993
00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:32.330
<v Speaker 1>when you have something like wilders,</v>

994
00:25:32.331 --> 00:25:34.000
<v Speaker 1>right hand or leg tyrants,</v>

995
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.610
<v Speaker 1>white hand,</v>

996
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:38.330
<v Speaker 1>you have something that can you have a right hand that could put anybody out.</v>

997
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:39.111
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is,</v>

998
00:25:39.111 --> 00:25:40.340
<v Speaker 1>I brought up before,</v>

999
00:25:40.341 --> 00:25:41.120
<v Speaker 1>but think about it.</v>

1000
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.970
<v Speaker 1>He fought Darren till and they fought wonderboy twice.</v>

1001
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Those are two,</v>

1002
00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:48.770
<v Speaker 1>two guys that are arguably the best strikers in the 170 pound division.</v>

1003
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:49.341
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

1004
00:25:49.341 --> 00:25:50.630
<v Speaker 1>Both of them up on their feet.</v>

1005
00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean both fights.</v>

1006
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Wonderboy was on Queer Street and then in the till fight,</v>

1007
00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.220
<v Speaker 1>the only punch landed at all was by Tyron.</v>

1008
00:25:59.221 --> 00:25:59.420
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1009
00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:03.000
<v Speaker 1>He cracks till drops until Neverland touched him with a glove drop.</v>

1010
00:26:03.001 --> 00:26:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Some beats the shit out of him and then chokes him.</v>

1011
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.540
<v Speaker 1>I think that was one of the best performances from tyron.</v>

1012
00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:08.820
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1013
00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.520
<v Speaker 1>He looked really good in that fight.</v>

1014
00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.200
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1015
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.870
<v Speaker 1>He looked almost like a disdainful to like,</v>

1016
00:26:14.871 --> 00:26:15.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1017
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:18.800
<v Speaker 1>you motherfuckers can't believe you guys got him the Fed betting favorite?</v>

1018
00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:19.131
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1019
00:26:19.131 --> 00:26:19.581
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1020
00:26:19.581 --> 00:26:21.520
<v Speaker 1>What is that shit going to beats.</v>

1021
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Cowboy cerrone.</v>

1022
00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.590
<v Speaker 1>A guy was supposed to be fighting at 155 pounds.</v>

1023
00:26:24.591 --> 00:26:28.220
<v Speaker 1>He's tough as shit but one big fight and all of a sudden you guys have in the</v>

1024
00:26:28.221 --> 00:26:29.060
<v Speaker 1>betting favorite.</v>

1025
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:30.290
<v Speaker 1>This is preposterous.</v>

1026
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Put some respect on my name.</v>

1027
00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:32.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1028
00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:33.590
<v Speaker 1>well he's a,</v>

1029
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.010
<v Speaker 1>he's a polarizing figure for some reason.</v>

1030
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:37.933
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

1031
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.990
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's one of those things where guys have to catch,</v>

1032
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:42.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1033
00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.430
<v Speaker 1>like maybe it's like if tyron</v>

1034
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.900
<v Speaker 2>had a GSP fight,</v>

1035
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.450
<v Speaker 2>like if GSP comes out of retirement fights,</v>

1036
00:26:48.451 --> 00:26:48.841
<v Speaker 2>tyron,</v>

1037
00:26:48.841 --> 00:26:50.310
<v Speaker 2>tyron smashes GSP,</v>

1038
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.930
<v Speaker 2>then maybe people go,</v>

1039
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.640
<v Speaker 2>I wonder like what Mohammed Ali was like because I wasn't,</v>

1040
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.950
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't there like everybody loves him now,</v>

1041
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:00.690
<v Speaker 2>but did they love him when he was,</v>

1042
00:27:00.691 --> 00:27:02.310
<v Speaker 2>when he was running his mouth?</v>

1043
00:27:02.311 --> 00:27:02.720
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

1044
00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure people did.</v>

1045
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that he had um,</v>

1046
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:06.220
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1047
00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:06.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1048
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.091
<v Speaker 2>like the economy,</v>

1049
00:27:07.091 --> 00:27:07.924
<v Speaker 2>greg of fans,</v>

1050
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:08.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1051
00:27:08.491 --> 00:27:10.170
<v Speaker 2>because he was that good.</v>

1052
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:14.250
<v Speaker 2>But I wonder if there was this big contingent of people that were like,</v>

1053
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:15.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1054
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:15.893
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1055
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:17.760
<v Speaker 2>we hate that Muhammad Ali guy.</v>

1056
00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:18.241
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1057
00:27:18.241 --> 00:27:20.220
<v Speaker 2>he was really that good,</v>

1058
00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:21.180
<v Speaker 2>but then he wasn't.</v>

1059
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:26.570
<v Speaker 2>See what happened was we got really crazy with our was they made him take three</v>

1060
00:27:26.581 --> 00:27:30.210
<v Speaker 2>years right off of fighting and during that three years he was supposed to be</v>

1061
00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:31.070
<v Speaker 2>fighting in Vietnam.</v>

1062
00:27:31.071 --> 00:27:31.321
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1063
00:27:31.321 --> 00:27:32.131
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>

1064
00:27:32.131 --> 00:27:33.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to Vietnam.</v>

1065
00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.280
<v Speaker 2>So they stripped him of his title and then he doesn't train.</v>

1066
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:35.941
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1067
00:27:35.941 --> 00:27:36.930
<v Speaker 2>when he came back,</v>

1068
00:27:36.931 --> 00:27:37.910
<v Speaker 2>did you ever see his comeback?</v>

1069
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:38.220
<v Speaker 2>Find,</v>

1070
00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:38.970
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>

1071
00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:42.500
<v Speaker 2>he came back against Jerry Quarry and I'm,</v>

1072
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you man,</v>

1073
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.570
<v Speaker 2>he looked like he had no muscle.</v>

1074
00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Like you look at him from the old days,</v>

1075
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:48.811
<v Speaker 2>like look,</v>

1076
00:27:48.811 --> 00:27:49.770
<v Speaker 2>when he fought Cleveland,</v>

1077
00:27:49.771 --> 00:27:50.760
<v Speaker 2>big Cat Williams.</v>

1078
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was just a Greek God,</v>

1079
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.570
<v Speaker 2>but then you see him when he's coming back and he's fighting quarry three years</v>

1080
00:27:57.571 --> 00:27:58.110
<v Speaker 2>out of the ring,</v>

1081
00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:59.550
<v Speaker 2>probably barely trained at all.</v>

1082
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.730
<v Speaker 2>His body just looks slower and smoother.</v>

1083
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:04.110
<v Speaker 2>He just didn't look the same.</v>

1084
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.880
<v Speaker 2>Like physically see if you could find that.</v>

1085
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:08.061
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1086
00:28:08.061 --> 00:28:10.500
<v Speaker 2>and Jerry quarry was just a super tough guy.</v>

1087
00:28:10.501 --> 00:28:12.870
<v Speaker 2>Just would walk forward and eat a bunch of shots.</v>

1088
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.010
<v Speaker 2>But you look,</v>

1089
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:16.530
<v Speaker 2>you look at his body like it doesn't look the same.</v>

1090
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:16.831
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1091
00:28:16.831 --> 00:28:17.071
<v Speaker 2>look it,</v>

1092
00:28:17.071 --> 00:28:17.910
<v Speaker 2>look at his back.</v>

1093
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.120
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't mean he obviously went through a full camp.</v>

1094
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.133
<v Speaker 2>Get ready for that,</v>

1095
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.810
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't look like the Muhammad Ali of old.</v>

1096
00:28:24.811 --> 00:28:27.270
<v Speaker 2>And then when he's fighting he doesn't move.</v>

1097
00:28:27.271 --> 00:28:28.710
<v Speaker 2>Like the Muhammad Ali of old.</v>

1098
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.540
<v Speaker 2>Those three years took a toll on them.</v>

1099
00:28:30.541 --> 00:28:31.410
<v Speaker 2>Like look at his body.</v>

1100
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.640
<v Speaker 2>Just doesn't look the same.</v>

1101
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:34.043
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1102
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1103
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:35.790
<v Speaker 2>He looks a little smaller.</v>

1104
00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:36.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1105
00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:37.890
<v Speaker 2>Smaller because he hasn't been training,</v>

1106
00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.540
<v Speaker 2>so we lost,</v>

1107
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.010
<v Speaker 2>probably lost a lot of muscle,</v>

1108
00:28:41.011 --> 00:28:46.011
<v Speaker 2>just looks smoother and just doesn't look as quick or as good and he's fighting</v>

1109
00:28:46.471 --> 00:28:48.090
<v Speaker 2>a guy that has no business in the ring with him,</v>

1110
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.553
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1111
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:54.830
<v Speaker 2>he's fighting a guy that mean and he's a jerry quarry is a sad story when it</v>

1112
00:28:55.501 --> 00:28:57.700
<v Speaker 2>comes to brain damage to like the end of his career,</v>

1113
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:59.040
<v Speaker 2>the end of his life rather.</v>

1114
00:28:59.041 --> 00:29:00.360
<v Speaker 2>It was horrible.</v>

1115
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:05.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean he had fought so many times against big punchers and was known for being</v>

1116
00:29:06.781 --> 00:29:07.710
<v Speaker 2>able to take a punch.</v>

1117
00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:10.500
<v Speaker 2>And then also I think coming up,</v>

1118
00:29:10.501 --> 00:29:11.790
<v Speaker 2>I think it was his brothers,</v>

1119
00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:15.330
<v Speaker 2>his brother also had like a real problem with brain damage.</v>

1120
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:19.440
<v Speaker 2>I think they did a lot of real hard sparring together and a lot of hard sparring</v>

1121
00:29:19.441 --> 00:29:22.320
<v Speaker 2>and the gym and the end of his life was awful.</v>

1122
00:29:22.321 --> 00:29:26.700
<v Speaker 2>I read an article about what it was like at the end for him and it was similar</v>

1123
00:29:26.701 --> 00:29:28.590
<v Speaker 2>to what the end was like for Ali.</v>

1124
00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:29.421
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1125
00:29:29.421 --> 00:29:30.254
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1126
00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.130
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

1127
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:31.963
<v Speaker 2>I always,</v>

1128
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.130
<v Speaker 2>when someone says something,</v>

1129
00:29:33.131 --> 00:29:34.290
<v Speaker 2>it makes me think of something else.</v>

1130
00:29:34.291 --> 00:29:38.740
<v Speaker 2>And you're talking about cory and his brother made me think of Joe Lozan and Dan</v>

1131
00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:42.690
<v Speaker 2>Lowe's on fighting in the yard when they would have those barbecues.</v>

1132
00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.840
<v Speaker 2>Beat the shit out of each other.</v>

1133
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:44.771
<v Speaker 2>Like legit.</v>

1134
00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Beat the fuck out of each other.</v>

1135
00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1136
00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:49.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I could do that to my family.</v>

1137
00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:50.790
<v Speaker 2>They had a different kind of friendship.</v>

1138
00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:52.630
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny.</v>

1139
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:53.620
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1140
00:29:53.621 --> 00:29:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Those videos of Joe on top of him punching him in the head from behind.</v>

1141
00:29:56.861 --> 00:29:57.101
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1142
00:29:57.101 --> 00:29:58.140
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1143
00:29:58.210 --> 00:29:59.350
<v Speaker 2>Joe Dot.</v>

1144
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1145
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:00.431
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1146
00:30:00.431 --> 00:30:01.270
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm thinking.</v>

1147
00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:01.840
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1148
00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:02.800
<v Speaker 2>that's not a stranger.</v>

1149
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1150
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:04.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1151
00:30:04.391 --> 00:30:07.750
<v Speaker 2>that's some of the toughest guys grew up with brothers and they already here</v>

1152
00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.370
<v Speaker 2>beating the shit out of each other.</v>

1153
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:10.810
<v Speaker 2>This is what I stick it out.</v>

1154
00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.471
<v Speaker 2>The thing is though,</v>

1155
00:30:11.471 --> 00:30:12.640
<v Speaker 2>this is Massachusetts.</v>

1156
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.880
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts is a fucking hard ass place in there fighting mean they're full</v>

1157
00:30:19.661 --> 00:30:24.661
<v Speaker 2>blast kicks and punches and then the entire family is watching now and they're,</v>

1158
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:28.130
<v Speaker 2>they're having a real legit mma fight.</v>

1159
00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1160
00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:29.501
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

1161
00:30:29.501 --> 00:30:30.970
<v Speaker 2>That's what a bunch of psychos.</v>

1162
00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:35.500
<v Speaker 2>They got little girls watching and shit in there on the grass and he's beating</v>

1163
00:30:35.501 --> 00:30:36.730
<v Speaker 2>the shit out of his brother</v>

1164
00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.680
<v Speaker 2>and he's better to look at what kind of cycle family or the</v>

1165
00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.360
<v Speaker 2>fucking car,</v>

1166
00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:47.950
<v Speaker 2>the whole family sitting there.</v>

1167
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:49.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

1168
00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.100
<v Speaker 2>They put a soundtrack on it.</v>

1169
00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:54.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1170
00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.061
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>

1171
00:30:55.061 --> 00:30:55.894
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

1172
00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:56.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1173
00:30:56.651 --> 00:30:57.401
<v Speaker 2>let's not watch this.</v>

1174
00:30:57.401 --> 00:31:00.340
<v Speaker 2>I like both these guys got them at triangle.</v>

1175
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1176
00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm about tyron though.</v>

1177
00:31:03.101 --> 00:31:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

1178
00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:04.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1179
00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:04.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1180
00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.380
<v Speaker 2>look when,</v>

1181
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.580
<v Speaker 2>when Ali was,</v>

1182
00:31:06.581 --> 00:31:07.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1183
00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:10.690
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing about him refusing to fight in the draft,</v>

1184
00:31:10.691 --> 00:31:12.100
<v Speaker 2>like people hated him.</v>

1185
00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:13.720
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of people that hated him.</v>

1186
00:31:13.721 --> 00:31:17.020
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people that consider themselves patriots and thought it was before.</v>

1187
00:31:17.021 --> 00:31:20.170
<v Speaker 2>We have to realize that now pretty much everybody thinks the Vietnam war was a</v>

1188
00:31:20.171 --> 00:31:20.980
<v Speaker 2>terrible idea.</v>

1189
00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1190
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:22.870
<v Speaker 2>The Gulf of Tonkin incident,</v>

1191
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:26.470
<v Speaker 2>which got everybody into Vietnam was a false flag.</v>

1192
00:31:26.471 --> 00:31:27.340
<v Speaker 2>It was all bullshit.</v>

1193
00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:28.960
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't have been there in the first place.</v>

1194
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what the real reason for being in Vietnam was.</v>

1195
00:31:32.141 --> 00:31:35.610
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of people think that had to do with heroin and money and all kinds of</v>

1196
00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:36.190
<v Speaker 2>crazy shit.</v>

1197
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:36.700
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1198
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.200
<v Speaker 2>So when Ali said,</v>

1199
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm not fighting that war back then though,</v>

1200
00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.310
<v Speaker 2>back then people thought he was a coward.</v>

1201
00:31:42.311 --> 00:31:42.700
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1202
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Back then people thought he was a trader and he was aligned with Malcolm x.</v>

1203
00:31:46.211 --> 00:31:49.240
<v Speaker 2>He changed his name from Cassius clay to Muhammad Ali and everybody was worried</v>

1204
00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:51.740
<v Speaker 2>about the black panthers and the black Muslims and you know,</v>

1205
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:52.121
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

1206
00:31:52.121 --> 00:31:54.220
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of hate towards him I'm sure.</v>

1207
00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.550
<v Speaker 2>And so then when he came back and he was not the same guy anymore,</v>

1208
00:31:57.551 --> 00:31:58.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure people loved it.</v>

1209
00:31:58.660 --> 00:31:59.493
<v Speaker 2>They were happy.</v>

1210
00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:01.390
<v Speaker 2>They were happy when Joe Frazier beat him,</v>

1211
00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.253
<v Speaker 2>people were happy.</v>

1212
00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1213
00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:04.933
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1214
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.210
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1215
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:07.200
<v Speaker 2>that's human nature.</v>

1216
00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.760
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1217
00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:09.880
<v Speaker 2>People pick sides.</v>

1218
00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:12.220
<v Speaker 2>Like you picked sides when wildin knockdown fury.</v>

1219
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1220
00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:13.751
<v Speaker 2>We pick sides.</v>

1221
00:32:13.751 --> 00:32:14.011
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1222
00:32:14.011 --> 00:32:15.250
<v Speaker 2>You mean you don't know those guys,</v>

1223
00:32:15.251 --> 00:32:15.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1224
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.330
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1225
00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:16.750
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1226
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:17.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm also not going to hate on it,</v>

1227
00:32:17.971 --> 00:32:19.020
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I mean,</v>

1228
00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:19.601
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>

1229
00:32:19.601 --> 00:32:20.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm not hating on theory.</v>

1230
00:32:20.681 --> 00:32:21.460
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1231
00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:22.130
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

1232
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:22.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1233
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.240
<v Speaker 2>we're also a successful professional fighter.</v>

1234
00:32:25.241 --> 00:32:26.680
<v Speaker 2>You're not just a regular hater.</v>

1235
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:27.851
<v Speaker 2>He just said,</v>

1236
00:32:27.851 --> 00:32:28.121
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1237
00:32:28.121 --> 00:32:29.030
<v Speaker 2>why am I special?</v>

1238
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.943
<v Speaker 2>Kind of</v>

1239
00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.810
<v Speaker 2>successful former fighter,</v>

1240
00:32:34.811 --> 00:32:39.010
<v Speaker 2>fought many different organizations like for you to be rooting on somebody.</v>

1241
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 2>It feels different</v>

1242
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:40.401
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

1243
00:32:40.401 --> 00:32:41.234
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

1244
00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:46.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad I got the stamp of approval if he just doesn't feel I get it.</v>

1245
00:32:46.551 --> 00:32:47.390
<v Speaker 1>You like the style.</v>

1246
00:32:47.391 --> 00:32:47.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1247
00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.880
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't like knock out?</v>

1248
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck doesn't like knockouts?</v>

1249
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:52.003
<v Speaker 1>Everybody loves it.</v>

1250
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:52.993
<v Speaker 1>I love him man.</v>

1251
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Like Jeremy Stevens.</v>

1252
00:32:55.591 --> 00:32:57.290
<v Speaker 1>This is the guy that I love to watch fight,</v>

1253
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:58.183
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1254
00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was fighting him.</v>

1255
00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:01.310
<v Speaker 1>That's a different story.</v>

1256
00:33:01.311 --> 00:33:02.930
<v Speaker 1>But like watching him fight.</v>

1257
00:33:02.931 --> 00:33:03.291
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1258
00:33:03.291 --> 00:33:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that every time.</v>

1259
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.260
<v Speaker 1>But then when I'm fighting him,</v>

1260
00:33:06.261 --> 00:33:07.370
<v Speaker 1>I want you to root for me.</v>

1261
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:10.850
<v Speaker 1>He had a terrifying style.</v>

1262
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Still has a terrifying style.</v>

1263
00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:13.760
<v Speaker 1>He's just do or die.</v>

1264
00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:14.960
<v Speaker 1>If Jeremy connects,</v>

1265
00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:15.800
<v Speaker 1>you go over,</v>

1266
00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.730
<v Speaker 1>you can be Foxville and he carries that power deep deep into a fight.</v>

1267
00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:20.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1268
00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.340
<v Speaker 1>I remember when he was young and he fought rda.</v>

1269
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:23.443
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1270
00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1271
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:25.820
<v Speaker 1>That upper cut and that was a.</v>

1272
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:26.960
<v Speaker 1>That was a highlight reel.</v>

1273
00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Upper cut for a long time.</v>

1274
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Mom fight.</v>

1275
00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Rda Guzman.</v>

1276
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.670
<v Speaker 1>I saw the end of it to the last round.</v>

1277
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Who sponsored mother fucker?</v>

1278
00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:37.031
<v Speaker 1>Someone's dangerous.</v>

1279
00:33:37.031 --> 00:33:37.281
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1280
00:33:37.281 --> 00:33:37.710
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1281
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:38.570
<v Speaker 1>I was at Bella tour.</v>

1282
00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.630
<v Speaker 1>I was Abella toyed with,</v>

1283
00:33:39.631 --> 00:33:39.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1284
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:44.290
<v Speaker 1>with Chili and Bomba juicy shillings fight great.</v>

1285
00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:45.410
<v Speaker 1>He looked great.</v>

1286
00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.710
<v Speaker 1>He looks like he looks like a completely different guy.</v>

1287
00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:51.560
<v Speaker 1>We were in the dressing room warming up.</v>

1288
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.210
<v Speaker 1>He's warming up and he's hitting mitts.</v>

1289
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.470
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1290
00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:55.490
<v Speaker 1>my first thought was,</v>

1291
00:33:55.491 --> 00:33:55.791
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1292
00:33:55.791 --> 00:33:59.240
<v Speaker 1>he looks like he's doing the defensive takedowns sitting low.</v>

1293
00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:00.590
<v Speaker 1>It's more comfortable,</v>

1294
00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:01.221
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1295
00:34:01.221 --> 00:34:01.431
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1296
00:34:01.431 --> 00:34:02.480
<v Speaker 1>he's a different dude.</v>

1297
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:03.440
<v Speaker 1>He's very different.</v>

1298
00:34:03.441 --> 00:34:04.010
<v Speaker 1>He's putting,</v>

1299
00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:05.900
<v Speaker 1>he's got to that point where you,</v>

1300
00:34:05.901 --> 00:34:06.734
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1301
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.760
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

1302
00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.600
<v Speaker 1>it's not uncomfortable to wrestle like he didn't know what to do for a long time</v>

1303
00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:12.740
<v Speaker 1>and I've been gone for a while.</v>

1304
00:34:12.741 --> 00:34:13.690
<v Speaker 1>I came back and he was,</v>

1305
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.470
<v Speaker 1>he was out there with cowboy and Mickey and,</v>

1306
00:34:15.471 --> 00:34:15.691
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1307
00:34:15.691 --> 00:34:15.881
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1308
00:34:15.881 --> 00:34:17.030
<v Speaker 1>and Jafar even near.</v>

1309
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:19.490
<v Speaker 1>And those guys really helped him and I'm,</v>

1410
00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:49.860
<v Speaker 1>I missed all the UFC fights this weekend because of Bella tour and the boxing</v>

00:36:49.861 --> 00:36:50.191
<v Speaker 1>match.</v>

1412
00:36:50.191 --> 00:36:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Shogun returned from adversity to.</v>

1415
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Tyson poured it on but couldn't keep it up.</v>

1416
00:36:58.501 --> 00:37:00.660
<v Speaker 1>And then shogun got him to the ground,</v>

1417
00:37:00.661 --> 00:37:01.830
<v Speaker 1>smashed him up a bit,</v>

1419
00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:05.550
<v Speaker 1>hit him with a big right hand at the end of the fight,</v>

1420
00:37:05.551 --> 00:37:08.790
<v Speaker 1>dropped him and then beat the fuck out of them on the ground is like it was.</v>

1421
00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.050
<v Speaker 1>It was for me.</v>

1422
00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.180
<v Speaker 1>When I saw that fight announced Tyson.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sjogren's got another hard fight.</v>

1426
00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:18.440
<v Speaker 1>It's hard watching shogun get knocked out a bunch of times,</v>

1427
00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:24.090
<v Speaker 1>but he won and he won a big way and he wanted a war was a war.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like he's not slow down.</v>

1432
00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:36.150
<v Speaker 1>It was like real frantic and aggressive and it was awesome.</v>

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.600
<v Speaker 1>You can't get rid of that.</v>

1436
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:40.141
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1437

1438
00:37:40.711 --> 00:37:44.460
<v Speaker 1>they lose a bit of it when they take too much punishment there they lose some of</v>

1439
00:37:44.461 --> 00:37:47.490
<v Speaker 1>the ferocity or some of the enthusiasm or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

1440
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.960
<v Speaker 1>But I was one of the things.</v>

1441
00:37:48.961 --> 00:37:49.830
<v Speaker 1>I was watching that fight.</v>

1442
00:37:49.831 --> 00:37:50.101
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1443

1451
00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:00.960
<v Speaker 1>like a monster.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like he was like,</v>

1453
00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.410
<v Speaker 1>he was enjoying it.</v>

1454
00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:03.243
<v Speaker 1>Like he was shogun.</v>

1455
00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Shogun of old man.</v>

1456
00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1457
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:07.590
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>

1458
00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:10.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean he fought really well too.</v>

1459
00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Like his ground game was real solid.</v>

1460
00:38:12.091 --> 00:38:13.830
<v Speaker 1>His ground and pound was real solid,</v>

1461
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:15.630
<v Speaker 1>but it was also like his,</v>

1462
00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:16.400
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1463
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.430
<v Speaker 1>the exchanges.</v>

1464
00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.410
<v Speaker 1>He would be wanting to find openings.</v>

1465
00:38:19.411 --> 00:38:22.380
<v Speaker 1>He was frantic and very real aggressive.</v>

1466
00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:23.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1467
00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:23.680
<v Speaker 1>it was a.</v>

1468
00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:24.511
<v Speaker 1>It was an awesome fight,</v>

1469
00:38:24.511 --> 00:38:24.990
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1470
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:25.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1471
00:38:25.261 --> 00:38:26.010
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1472
00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:26.551
<v Speaker 1>I had a fight.</v>

1473
00:38:26.551 --> 00:38:27.384
<v Speaker 1>Pass this.</v>

1474
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1475
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:29.281
<v Speaker 1>it was an fs.</v>

1476
00:38:29.281 --> 00:38:29.761
<v Speaker 1>One thing.</v>

1477
00:38:29.761 --> 00:38:30.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know when.</v>

1478
00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:31.110
<v Speaker 1>When did they put those efforts?</v>

1479
00:38:31.111 --> 00:38:32.970
<v Speaker 1>One fights on fight pass.</v>

1480
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:34.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like a month because that what it is.</v>

1481
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:35.771
<v Speaker 1>I think go,</v>

1482
00:38:35.771 --> 00:38:36.250
<v Speaker 1>go further</v>

1483
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:41.250
<v Speaker 2>ahead of this because this is a long period where Tyson was trying to secure</v>

1484
00:38:41.921 --> 00:38:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Kamora.</v>

1485
00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:42.931
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>

1486
00:38:42.931 --> 00:38:43.751
<v Speaker 2>You don't go overseas,</v>

1487
00:38:43.751 --> 00:38:44.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1488
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:45.190
<v Speaker 2>Not Anymore.</v>

1489
00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.620
<v Speaker 2>Now those would cripple me,</v>

1490
00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:48.040
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1491
00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.500
<v Speaker 2>Those fucking those overseas things.</v>

1492
00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:53.230
<v Speaker 2>There's where you dropped them with the right hand?</v>

1493
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:54.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1494
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:57.520
<v Speaker 2>they direct me for a week and a half afterwards.</v>

1495
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:58.390
<v Speaker 2>I'd be exhausted.</v>

1496
00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:03.120
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Brazil or fly to Australia is worse.</v>

1497
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.030
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was going to say.</v>

1498
00:39:04.031 --> 00:39:04.691
<v Speaker 2>I was like Brazil.</v>

1499
00:39:04.691 --> 00:39:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that just like north south?</v>

1500
00:39:05.861 --> 00:39:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much.</v>

1501
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:06.881
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

1502
00:39:06.881 --> 00:39:08.860
<v Speaker 2>but it's still 16 hours on a plane.</v>

1503
00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:09.700
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1504
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1505
00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:10.571
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1506
00:39:10.571 --> 00:39:14.230
<v Speaker 2>You got to fly to Miami and then you get a flat 10 more hours to Rio.</v>

1507
00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.360
<v Speaker 2>It's 10 hours from Miami to real.</v>

1508
00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1509
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:18.210
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize that.</v>

1510
00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:20.250
<v Speaker 2>The South America zone,</v>

1511
00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:22.270
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole nother country.</v>

1512
00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.100
<v Speaker 2>Different continent.</v>

1513
00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.290
<v Speaker 2>I loved being there.</v>

1514
00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:27.280
<v Speaker 2>I hated getting there.</v>

1515
00:39:27.281 --> 00:39:28.180
<v Speaker 2>I hated going home.</v>

1516
00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:29.710
<v Speaker 2>I hated how I felt afterwards.</v>

1517
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:30.850
<v Speaker 2>And I'm just too busy.</v>

1518
00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:31.780
<v Speaker 2>It's just too.</v>

1519
00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.780
<v Speaker 2>It's too costly for me financially to take that much time off.</v>

1520
00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:35.771
<v Speaker 2>And it's also,</v>

1521
00:39:35.771 --> 00:39:37.600
<v Speaker 2>it's just too hard for me physically,</v>

1522
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:38.380
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1523
00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.710
<v Speaker 2>So if they compensated you for the time,</v>

1524
00:39:41.711 --> 00:39:42.180
<v Speaker 2>it's dope.</v>

1525
00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:43.013
<v Speaker 2>Physically</v>

1526
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:46.510
<v Speaker 2>know fuck you money.</v>

1527
00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:50.440
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1528
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:50.870
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1529
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:52.210
<v Speaker 2>you know what the other problem is man,</v>

1598
00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:17.870
<v Speaker 2>what's important and what they think is going to be a problem in a fight.</v>

1599
00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:22.750
<v Speaker 2>Like that's such a great move to have these x fighters and continue to,</v>

1600
00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:23.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1601
00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:24.580
<v Speaker 2>10 cormier is always doing it.</v>

1602
00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Continue to have them explaining from their own experience.</v>

1603
00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:30.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1604
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.761
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1605
00:41:30.761 --> 00:41:31.061
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1606
00:41:31.061 --> 00:41:31.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1607
00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.040
<v Speaker 2>that was the first thing for.</v>

1608
00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 2>Because I</v>

1609
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.221
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>

1610
00:41:34.221 --> 00:41:34.701
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1611
00:41:34.701 --> 00:41:35.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I'm doing.</v>

1612
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:36.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1613
00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.000
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what it is I'm doing,</v>

1614
00:41:38.001 --> 00:41:42.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's just talking about fights and it's so much fun to be doing it with,</v>

1615
00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:44.900
<v Speaker 1>with guys that are on that same level because you know,</v>

1616
00:41:44.901 --> 00:41:45.680
<v Speaker 1>you're at home,</v>

1617
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.550
<v Speaker 1>you probably do it when,</v>

1618
00:41:46.551 --> 00:41:46.791
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1619
00:41:46.791 --> 00:41:49.900
<v Speaker 1>when you're at home and you're not doing a fight companion watching fights and</v>

1620
00:41:49.901 --> 00:41:50.810
<v Speaker 1>maybe some friends around,</v>

1621
00:41:50.811 --> 00:41:52.400
<v Speaker 1>they ask you things about fights and you're like,</v>

1622
00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.770
<v Speaker 1>you have to explain it to people who don't understand.</v>

1623
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:58.520
<v Speaker 1>But when you're having a conversation with somebody who knows what's going on</v>

1624
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:59.570
<v Speaker 1>and then you can eat,</v>

1625
00:41:59.571 --> 00:42:03.350
<v Speaker 1>especially when you come to a point where you disagree because you have strong,</v>

1626
00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.400
<v Speaker 1>you have strong opinions.</v>

1627
00:42:04.401 --> 00:42:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1628
00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:08.090
<v Speaker 1>And you have strong arguments as to why you're right and why the other guy's</v>

1629
00:42:08.091 --> 00:42:08.750
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

1630
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:09.161
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1631
00:42:09.161 --> 00:42:09.651
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

1632
00:42:09.651 --> 00:42:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

1633
00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:11.420
<v Speaker 1>I love those moments man.</v>

1634
00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.470
<v Speaker 1>I love having those things.</v>

1635
00:42:12.471 --> 00:42:15.470
<v Speaker 1>Especially being able to do that with guys who know what they're talking about.</v>

1636
00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:15.741
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1637
00:42:15.741 --> 00:42:18.290
<v Speaker 1>it makes it so much more fun when you're doing it with guys who know what</v>

1638
00:42:18.291 --> 00:42:18.921
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about.</v>

1639
00:42:18.921 --> 00:42:22.550
<v Speaker 1>What's one of the cool things about fight companion is that were set when Brian</v>

1640
00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:23.403
<v Speaker 1>counselors talking.</v>

1641
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:24.463
<v Speaker 1>Just kidding,</v>

1642
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.310
<v Speaker 1>just kidding Brian.</v>

1643
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Just kidding.</v>

1644
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:26.570
<v Speaker 1>But when,</v>

1645
00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:29.570
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing it like everybody's got their own opinion of how something</v>

1646
00:42:29.571 --> 00:42:30.890
<v Speaker 1>could go down or how,</v>

1647
00:42:30.891 --> 00:42:31.141
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1648
00:42:31.141 --> 00:42:32.060
<v Speaker 1>what's gonna be a problem?</v>

1649
00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:33.200
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times you agree,</v>

1650
00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:33.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1651
00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:34.190
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

1652
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:37.670
<v Speaker 1>like the till Tyron Woodley fight will tills chances standing up.</v>

1653
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:38.511
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1654
00:42:38.511 --> 00:42:39.111
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1655
00:42:39.111 --> 00:42:40.730
<v Speaker 1>if I was tired I'd take him to the ground.</v>

1656
00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean determines a far better wrestler.</v>

1657
00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Far,</v>

1658
00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:43.350
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

1659
00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:44.390
<v Speaker 1>much more experience,</v>

1660
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.130
<v Speaker 1>but like there's some fights were like,</v>

1661
00:42:46.131 --> 00:42:46.401

1669
00:42:52.941 --> 00:42:54.900
<v Speaker 1>I've bounced that one around my head and people,</v>

1670
00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:56.330
<v Speaker 1>people would come up to me on the street like,</v>

1671
00:42:56.331 --> 00:42:56.840
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1673
00:42:58.110 --> 00:42:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Especially Hawaiians.</v>

1674
00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Hawaiians are super excited for Max Holloway to win again.</v>

1675
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:04.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's the new Bj Penn.</v>

1676
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:05.323
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1677
00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:06.980
<v Speaker 1>And theRe may be a different level.</v>

1678
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Max max hallways,</v>

1679
00:43:08.391 --> 00:43:09.750
<v Speaker 1>a mother fucker.</v>

1680
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:10.580
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1681
00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:11.630
<v Speaker 1>that's one of those fights.</v>

1682
00:43:11.631 --> 00:43:11.871
<v Speaker 1>YeAh.</v>

1683
00:43:11.871 --> 00:43:15.030
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to pick a it was that even like,</v>

1684
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:16.170
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty even gotta be.</v>

1685
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1686
00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:16.580
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1687
00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:16.780
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1688
00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.080
<v Speaker 1>what the vegas odds are.</v>

1689
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:18.801
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1690
00:43:18.801 --> 00:43:19.161
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1691
00:43:19.161 --> 00:43:22.790
<v Speaker 1>I love the fact that you can actually gamble on fights now online.</v>

1692
00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Like it's lean,</v>

1693
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:24.263
<v Speaker 1>it's legal.</v>

1694
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:26.420
<v Speaker 1>They kind of do it right.</v>

1695
00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.130
<v Speaker 1>If you were fighting with myself,</v>

1696
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:30.140
<v Speaker 1>depending on the state to have too much pressure,</v>

1697
00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:33.440
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to think about it unless I knew,</v>

1698
00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:38.260
<v Speaker 1>unless the guy was a fucking asshole and now I'm going to go smash this.</v>

1699
00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Like there's just no.</v>

1700
00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Very close.</v>

1701
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:43.550
<v Speaker 1>They're both minus,</v>

1702
00:43:43.551 --> 00:43:44.290
<v Speaker 1>minus one,</v>

1703
00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:45.230
<v Speaker 1>minus 1:25,</v>

1704
00:43:45.231 --> 00:43:48.020
<v Speaker 1>which would be all the favorite slight favorite.</v>

1705
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:48.981
<v Speaker 1>does that make sense?</v>

1706
00:43:48.981 --> 00:43:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1707
00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:50.143
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

1708
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:51.410
<v Speaker 1>That should be how it is.</v>

1709
00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Slight favorite because he's the champion and you know it's interesting with</v>

1710
00:43:54.831 --> 00:43:56.240
<v Speaker 1>hallway said he goes,</v>

1711
00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:56.991
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

1712
00:43:56.991 --> 00:43:59.060
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of weird when he goes.</v>

1713
00:43:59.061 --> 00:44:00.350
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of weird when the,</v>

1714
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:04.520
<v Speaker 1>the new thing is older than the current thing.</v>

1715
00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's like I'm younger man.</v>

1716
00:44:08.121 --> 00:44:09.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm the fucking champ.</v>

1717
00:44:09.201 --> 00:44:09.561
<v Speaker 1>I beat.</v>

1718
00:44:09.561 --> 00:44:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Although I'd been all these dudes,</v>

1719
00:44:11.031 --> 00:44:14.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm younger and yet this guy is the new thing coming up and challenge me.</v>

1720
00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:15.861
<v Speaker 1>It's like motherfucker,</v>

1721
00:44:15.861 --> 00:44:16.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm the younger fighter.</v>

1722
00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:18.170
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of funny.</v>

1723
00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:18.951
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>

1724
00:44:18.951 --> 00:44:19.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean we haven't seen,</v>

1725
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:23.880
<v Speaker 1>we haven't seen something like or tag a little bit in um,</v>

1726
00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:28.910
<v Speaker 1>in the featherweight division guy submitting like only submissions off to like</v>

1727
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:29.950
<v Speaker 1>the one with cub.</v>

1728
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1729
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1730
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 1>I think that was beautiful.</v>

1731
00:44:32.101 --> 00:44:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Like he readjusted on that teaM too.</v>

1732
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:34.530
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1733
00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:37.110
<v Speaker 1>that's probably the hardest submission to readjust,</v>

1734
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:38.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1735
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:43.290
<v Speaker 1>one hand hanging on readjusting and then still sinking it in against cubs won.</v>

1736
00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:48.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's not like Brandon Bishop or whoever it's comes once.</v>

1737
00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.450
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1738
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:50.550
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

1739
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:51.540
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy man.</v>

1740
00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:52.643
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1741
00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:55.050
<v Speaker 1>he's a direct lineage,</v>

1742
00:44:55.051 --> 00:44:55.291
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1743
00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:57.720
<v Speaker 1>He's real gracie jujitsu.</v>

1744
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:59.850
<v Speaker 1>He is henner and he Iran,</v>

1745
00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:00.810
<v Speaker 1>you know he's come.</v>

1746
00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:03.270
<v Speaker 1>He comes from horry on that school.</v>

1747
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is where brian comes from.</v>

1748
00:45:05.071 --> 00:45:10.071
<v Speaker 1>He's direct from those mats and his technique is like razor blades so sharp.</v>

1749
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:16.030
<v Speaker 1>It's so sharp and precise and so honed and just through drills and a constant</v>

1750
00:45:16.681 --> 00:45:19.200
<v Speaker 1>emphasis on proper leverage and position.</v>

1751
00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:23.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are sticklers to that old style of jujitsu and some people.</v>

1752
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:27.300
<v Speaker 1>There's an unfortunate word that people like to use that sometimes pisses people</v>

1753
00:45:27.301 --> 00:45:27.420
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

1754
00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Like vinny magalhaes use this to describe minataro and he didn't mean it in a</v>

1755
00:45:31.081 --> 00:45:31.890
<v Speaker 1>negative way,</v>

1756
00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:33.210
<v Speaker 1>but he meant the basics.</v>

1757
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:34.950
<v Speaker 1>He's like his jujitsu is very basic.</v>

1758
00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.980
<v Speaker 1>He'd ended up people go fucking my jujitsu is basic,</v>

1759
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:40.530
<v Speaker 1>but the basic is like the best,</v>

1760
00:45:40.531 --> 00:45:41.364
<v Speaker 1>the fundamentals,</v>

1761
00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:46.460
<v Speaker 1>but these guys that have those basics like hotter gracie,</v>

1762
00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:47.610
<v Speaker 1>his jujitsu is.</v>

1763
00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.500
<v Speaker 1>He's mostly the basics.</v>

1764
00:45:49.501 --> 00:45:53.370
<v Speaker 1>He's not doing any crazy della hiva shit or anything that you've never seen</v>

1765
00:45:53.371 --> 00:45:53.851
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

1766
00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:54.684
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1767
00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:55.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1768
00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:55.921
<v Speaker 1>he's not doing anything.</v>

1769
00:45:55.921 --> 00:45:57.090
<v Speaker 1>We never saw it before.</v>

1770
00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:58.320
<v Speaker 1>It's strict,</v>

1771
00:45:58.580 --> 00:45:59.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1772
00:45:59.040 --> 00:45:59.491
<v Speaker 1>guard,</v>

1773
00:45:59.491 --> 00:46:00.001
<v Speaker 1>pass,</v>

1774
00:46:00.001 --> 00:46:01.290
<v Speaker 1>smashing on top,</v>

1775
00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:01.921
<v Speaker 1>triangle,</v>

1776
00:46:01.921 --> 00:46:02.701
<v Speaker 1>mount arm,</v>

1777
00:46:02.701 --> 00:46:04.170
<v Speaker 1>triangle armbar.</v>

1778
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Everything he does is classic jujitsu,</v>

1779
00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:09.270
<v Speaker 1>but it's just so perfect.</v>

1780
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:09.871
<v Speaker 1>Everything,</v>

1781
00:46:09.871 --> 00:46:13.350
<v Speaker 1>the leverage and the weight and the emphasis on,</v>

1782
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:13.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1783
00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.540
<v Speaker 1>certain positions over others.</v>

1784
00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:20.130
<v Speaker 1>It's all like basic classic jujitsu and that's Brian Ortega.</v>

1785
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:24.840
<v Speaker 1>His jujitsu is just so rock solid fundamentals.</v>

1786
00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:25.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1787
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:27.050
<v Speaker 1>he's all about fundamentals,</v>

1788
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:28.110
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1789
00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Even his box,</v>

1790
00:46:29.191 --> 00:46:29.670
<v Speaker 1>he's not,</v>

1791
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe he's as good a boxer as as Max,</v>

1792
00:46:31.981 --> 00:46:36.981
<v Speaker 1>but he's fundamentally sound strong and direct with his boxing mean.</v>

1793
00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.240
<v Speaker 1>He knocked out frankie,</v>

1794
00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:40.620
<v Speaker 1>he knocked out frankie.</v>

1795
00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:45.290
<v Speaker 1>He submitted my condo who I think is one of the dark horse in that division and</v>

1796
00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:47.310
<v Speaker 1>auto marcano is a fucking beast.</v>

1797
00:46:47.311 --> 00:46:48.144
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1798
00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Mike brown has nothing but praise for him,</v>

1799
00:46:50.611 --> 00:46:50.970
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1800
00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:51.451
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1801
00:46:51.451 --> 00:46:52.650
<v Speaker 1>that kid is legit.</v>

1802
00:46:52.651 --> 00:46:52.930
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1803
00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:54.330
<v Speaker 1>he's going to challenge for that title.</v>

1804
00:46:54.331 --> 00:46:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I believe that.</v>

1805
00:46:55.171 --> 00:47:00.120
<v Speaker 1>I believe that and he's super respectful and intelligent and like everything</v>

1806
00:47:00.121 --> 00:47:01.110
<v Speaker 1>about him I like.</v>

1807
00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:01.920
<v Speaker 1>I love his,</v>

1808
00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:02.753
<v Speaker 1>his approach,</v>

1809
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:05.010
<v Speaker 1>the way he fights and in that fight,</v>

1810
00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:06.630
<v Speaker 1>hollowell or excuse me,</v>

1811
00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:11.700
<v Speaker 1>ortega made him shoot because he was beating him standing up and he shot and</v>

1812
00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:12.140
<v Speaker 1>ortega.</v>

1813
00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:12.973
<v Speaker 1>I think you</v>

1814
00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:15.331
<v Speaker 1>that good team.</v>

1815
00:47:15.331 --> 00:47:17.010
<v Speaker 1>It's just a death grip.</v>

1816
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.510
<v Speaker 1>He's just got a vice.</v>

1817
00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Just clamps down on your fucking life,</v>

1818
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:23.820
<v Speaker 1>put you to sleep.</v>

1819
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:24.570
<v Speaker 1>There's no room,</v>

1820
00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:25.171
<v Speaker 1>there's no room.</v>

1821
00:47:25.171 --> 00:47:27.120
<v Speaker 1>You're going To sleep or you're going to tap.</v>

1822
00:47:27.121 --> 00:47:28.110
<v Speaker 1>You need a kid.</v>

1823
00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:29.290
<v Speaker 1>he's my size.</v>

1824
00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:29.890
<v Speaker 1>He's big.</v>

1825
00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 1>He's</v>

1826
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:30.541
<v Speaker 2>a big.</v>

1827
00:47:30.541 --> 00:47:31.320
<v Speaker 2>He's big.</v>

1828
00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:33.640
<v Speaker 2>Macs is big to their max is huge.</v>

1829
00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.680
<v Speaker 2>Max was 185.</v>

1830
00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:39.230
<v Speaker 2>When they told him about the fight,</v>

1831
00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:44.620
<v Speaker 2>the horrible thing about that fight was that he lost all that weight really</v>

1832
00:47:44.621 --> 00:47:49.540
<v Speaker 2>rapidly for no reason and then they wound up pulling him out of the fight,</v>

1833
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:51.250
<v Speaker 2>know the commissioners like fuck this.</v>

1834
00:47:51.251 --> 00:47:52.000
<v Speaker 2>You can't fight.</v>

1835
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.500
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of us at the time were like,</v>

1836
00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:56.800
<v Speaker 2>why is the commission telling the champion whether or not he could make,</v>

1837
00:47:56.801 --> 00:47:57.011
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1838
00:47:57.011 --> 00:47:58.330
<v Speaker 2>let him try to make weight.</v>

1839
00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck out of there.</v>

1840
00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:00.430
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what you're doing,</v>

1841
00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:05.610
<v Speaker 2>but then you find out after that that like when he was preparing for the first</v>

1842
00:48:06.371 --> 00:48:10.780
<v Speaker 2>fight with ortega and he was experiencing these weird concussion like symptoms</v>

1843
00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:11.201
<v Speaker 2>symptoms,</v>

1844
00:48:11.201 --> 00:48:13.570
<v Speaker 2>but they said he didn't have a concussion and then people will say,</v>

1845
00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:13.721
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1846
00:48:13.721 --> 00:48:14.680
<v Speaker 2>this is weight loss,</v>

1847
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:16.390
<v Speaker 2>this is rapid weight cuttings.</v>

1848
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:19.570
<v Speaker 2>Body is responding to the fact that you just went through this and now I was</v>

1849
00:48:19.571 --> 00:48:21.700
<v Speaker 2>trying to do it again and his body's rejecting it.</v>

1850
00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.080
<v Speaker 2>So this is a bunch of theories.</v>

1851
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:24.153
<v Speaker 2>There's not.</v>

1852
00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:27.760
<v Speaker 2>They're not giving us a whole lot of information about exactly what's wrong with</v>

1853
00:48:27.761 --> 00:48:29.410
<v Speaker 2>him medically or what was wrong.</v>

1854
00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:30.910
<v Speaker 2>Whether theY know it or not,</v>

1855
00:48:30.911 --> 00:48:31.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1856
00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:31.990
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1857
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:36.430
<v Speaker 2>But even or take has been saying all week like what the fuck was wrong with him?</v>

1858
00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:37.240
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

1859
00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.540
<v Speaker 2>How come they're not telling us like what if it happens again or take has got to</v>

1860
00:48:40.541 --> 00:48:41.374
<v Speaker 2>be thinking right now.</v>

1861
00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Here we are today.</v>

1862
00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:43.750
<v Speaker 2>It's wednesday,</v>

1863
00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:45.250
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow's thursday.</v>

1864
00:48:45.251 --> 00:48:46.150
<v Speaker 2>The weigh ins friday.</v>

1865
00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:50.380
<v Speaker 2>He'll only got a couple of days like we don't know whether or not this is even</v>

1866
00:48:50.381 --> 00:48:51.250
<v Speaker 2>actually going to happen.</v>

1867
00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:51.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1868
00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:55.420
<v Speaker 2>Like what if it gets down to thursday and friday and he's in the middle of the</v>

1869
00:48:55.421 --> 00:48:58.780
<v Speaker 2>weight cut and he starts blacking out or he starts experiencing those symptoms</v>

1870
00:48:58.781 --> 00:48:58.960
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1871
00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:01.360
<v Speaker 2>They pull them out of the car more ikonos on standby,</v>

1872
00:49:01.361 --> 00:49:02.194
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1873
00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:07.420
<v Speaker 2>I did not know that he's on standby for this fight that he see and then it</v>

1874
00:49:07.421 --> 00:49:08.440
<v Speaker 2>becomes an interim title.</v>

1875
00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:09.400
<v Speaker 2>It must,</v>

1876
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:10.420
<v Speaker 2>it has to be.</v>

1877
00:49:10.421 --> 00:49:11.290
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to strip them,</v>

1878
00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:12.220
<v Speaker 2>but then what happens?</v>

1879
00:49:12.221 --> 00:49:16.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean a guy like max that I don't know.</v>

1880
00:49:16.541 --> 00:49:16.710
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1881
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:18.420
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those situations where it's like,</v>

1882
00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:20.290
<v Speaker 2>if that happens multiple times,</v>

1883
00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:21.370
<v Speaker 2>like what do you have to do?</v>

1884
00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:21.641
<v Speaker 2>Kim,</v>

1885
00:49:21.641 --> 00:49:22.540
<v Speaker 2>can you continue to,</v>

1886
00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:24.580
<v Speaker 2>how much longer can you continue to fight at that weight?</v>

1887
00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:27.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he can continue to fight it that way very much longer because I</v>

1888
00:49:27.491 --> 00:49:30.430
<v Speaker 2>think he severely compromises himself getting done in 45.</v>

1889
00:49:30.431 --> 00:49:32.470
<v Speaker 2>But he's been able to do it because he's a champion.</v>

1890
00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:33.131
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

1891
00:49:33.131 --> 00:49:35.090
<v Speaker 2>And I think if you do have a,</v>

1892
00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:37.390
<v Speaker 2>a like a george lockhart in your corner,</v>

1893
00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:41.020
<v Speaker 2>a guy that gets you to do it scientifically and they rehydrate yourself</v>

1894
00:49:41.021 --> 00:49:41.854
<v Speaker 2>scientifically,</v>

1895
00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:45.460
<v Speaker 2>it can be done and you can pull it off in 24 hours later.</v>

1896
00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:47.230
<v Speaker 2>You can fight at a very high level.</v>

1897
00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:48.790
<v Speaker 2>But is that the way to go?</v>

1898
00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:49.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1899
00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:51.310
<v Speaker 2>the kidneys start breaking down,</v>

1900
00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:55.480
<v Speaker 2>your body starts getting beat up and your organs don't want to get dried out</v>

1901
00:49:55.481 --> 00:49:56.314
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1902
00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.030
<v Speaker 2>Your brain doesn't want to get dried out like that.</v>

1903
00:49:58.031 --> 00:50:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Your muscles don't want to get dried out like that.</v>

1904
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:05.280
<v Speaker 2>There's just no way you perform at your best when you're just at death's door 24</v>

1905
00:50:06.131 --> 00:50:06.820
<v Speaker 2>hours ago.</v>

1906
00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:08.020
<v Speaker 2>And now here you're fighting again.</v>

1907
00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1908
00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:10.053
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1909
00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.133
<v Speaker 2>frankie,</v>

1910
00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:11.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1911
00:50:11.561 --> 00:50:12.790
<v Speaker 2>when he was fighting at lightweight,</v>

1912
00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:13.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1913
00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:18.860
<v Speaker 2>that kinda kinda shows you that you can be the smaller guy and do well.</v>

1914
00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:25.320
<v Speaker 2>But it's weird because like now frankie said a bar and now guys reached that bar</v>

1915
00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:28.700
<v Speaker 2>so he had to change weight classes.</v>

1916
00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:29.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1917
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.910
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1918
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:30.743
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing.</v>

1919
00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:31.800
<v Speaker 2>And everybody's gonna.</v>

1920
00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:32.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1921
00:50:32.001 --> 00:50:32.630
<v Speaker 2>it's the fight game.</v>

1922
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:33.000
<v Speaker 2>You always,</v>

1923
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.770
<v Speaker 2>you try to get the best out of yourself and you try to get the biggest advantage</v>

1924
00:50:36.771 --> 00:50:37.604
<v Speaker 2>that you can,</v>

1925
00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.710
<v Speaker 2>so the weight cut's gonna always be an issue.</v>

1926
00:50:39.711 --> 00:50:44.711
<v Speaker 2>Unless the way classes are changed and or weIgh ins become same day.</v>

1927
00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:49.700
<v Speaker 2>Well josh thompson just said recently that he thinks that the ufc is getting rid</v>

1928
00:50:49.701 --> 00:50:51.190
<v Speaker 2>of the 125 pound division.</v>

1929
00:50:51.191 --> 00:50:53.120
<v Speaker 2>They're got to put on a one 65 pound division,</v>

1930
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:54.530
<v Speaker 2>which I think is very interesting.</v>

1931
00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.450
<v Speaker 2>If they do do a one 65,</v>

1932
00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:59.080
<v Speaker 2>I would like them to switch one 72 [inaudible] 75.</v>

1933
00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:00.290
<v Speaker 2>I think that would be wise.</v>

1934
00:51:00.291 --> 00:51:02.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's wise to have a 65 and 75,</v>

1935
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:05.090
<v Speaker 2>but I do think of 65 and 75 is great,</v>

1936
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:05.983
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1937
00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:06.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1938
00:51:06.381 --> 00:51:07.214
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1939
00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:09.680
<v Speaker 2>I 10 pounds 10 pounds is good.</v>

1940
00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:11.480
<v Speaker 2>I think across the board,</v>

1941
00:51:11.481 --> 00:51:13.340
<v Speaker 2>I think we had every 10 pounds of weight class.</v>

1942
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:15.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of people don't like the boxing thing.</v>

1943
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:18.080
<v Speaker 2>There's so many champions and so many weight classes,</v>

1944
00:51:18.081 --> 00:51:20.150
<v Speaker 2>but who fucking cares?</v>

1945
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:21.133
<v Speaker 2>Who cares?</v>

1946
00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:24.440
<v Speaker 2>Who cares that there's a welterweight and then a super welterweight really cares</v>

1947
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:25.940
<v Speaker 2>that it's only seVen pounds difference.</v>

1948
00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:26.793
<v Speaker 2>This is more fights.</v>

1949
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:27.680
<v Speaker 2>It's more fights,</v>

1950
00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:28.490
<v Speaker 2>more champions.</v>

1951
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:29.990
<v Speaker 2>It's more champion versus champion.</v>

1952
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:30.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1953
00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:31.940
<v Speaker 2>don't you want to see that?</v>

1954
00:51:31.941 --> 00:51:32.690
<v Speaker 2>I want to see that.</v>

1955
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:33.081
<v Speaker 2>I want is.</v>

1956
00:51:33.081 --> 00:51:33.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1957
00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:34.790
<v Speaker 2>I want to see the best in the best.</v>

1958
00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:35.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1959
00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:35.631
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1960
00:51:35.631 --> 00:51:35.881
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

1961
00:51:35.881 --> 00:51:36.471
<v Speaker 2>we're getting,</v>

1962
00:51:36.471 --> 00:51:38.300
<v Speaker 2>we're getting some of the best of the best right now.</v>

1963
00:51:38.301 --> 00:51:39.134
<v Speaker 2>You get the number.</v>

1964
00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:40.790
<v Speaker 2>Let's say Kevin Lee.</v>

1965
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:43.160
<v Speaker 2>Kevin lee could be 165 pound champion.</v>

1966
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.581
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1967
00:51:43.581 --> 00:51:43.920
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

1968
00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:47.270
<v Speaker 2>And probably that's his weight class struggles to make 1:55.</v>

1969
00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:47.990
<v Speaker 2>He's a bIg fella.</v>

1970
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:51.440
<v Speaker 2>He's a big dude but then can't do it anymore.</v>

1971
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.330
<v Speaker 2>But like tyron wrestled at one 65.</v>

1972
00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:55.220
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if he was still that age,</v>

1973
00:51:55.221 --> 00:51:55.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1974
00:51:55.461 --> 00:51:56.870
<v Speaker 2>and he could fight at one 65.</v>

1975
00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:58.820
<v Speaker 2>Get tyron can make 65.</v>

1976
00:51:59.090 --> 00:51:59.631
<v Speaker 2>I've been tiring.</v>

1977
00:51:59.631 --> 00:52:00.450
<v Speaker 2>Can make 65.</v>

1978
00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:02.060
<v Speaker 2>I think he can make 65.</v>

1979
00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:04.700
<v Speaker 2>I definitely think he could fight at 75 and be at his best.</v>

1980
00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:06.620
<v Speaker 2>And I think he could also fight at 85.</v>

1981
00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:09.950
<v Speaker 2>I think tyron has legitimate potential to be a three division champion.</v>

1982
00:52:09.951 --> 00:52:10.850
<v Speaker 2>He should start.</v>

1983
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:12.740
<v Speaker 2>You should start rallying for that.</v>

1984
00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:14.450
<v Speaker 2>For that 65 pound weight class.</v>

1985
00:52:14.451 --> 00:52:15.410
<v Speaker 2>Nobody listens to me anymore.</v>

1986
00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:16.890
<v Speaker 2>If they listened to me,</v>

1987
00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:19.520
<v Speaker 2>melvIn manhoef would've been in the ufc back in 2002.</v>

1988
00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:21.830
<v Speaker 2>They listen to me sometimes.</v>

1989
00:52:21.831 --> 00:52:26.480
<v Speaker 2>I think they listen to me with ben aspirin on record and I'm gonna say I'm a big</v>

1990
00:52:26.481 --> 00:52:28.220
<v Speaker 2>reason why I've been asking and gotten the ufc.</v>

1991
00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:31.610
<v Speaker 2>I brokered a meeting between him and dana white.</v>

1992
00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:32.150
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1993
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.421
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1994
00:52:32.421 --> 00:52:33.254
<v Speaker 2>I put it together.</v>

1995
00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.370
<v Speaker 2>I called dana.</v>

1996
00:52:34.371 --> 00:52:34.641
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1997
00:52:34.641 --> 00:52:34.791

00:52:35.811 --> 00:52:36.501

2011
00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:48.411
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2012
00:52:48.411 --> 00:52:52.830
<v Speaker 2>the thing about fighting is it's not a matter of what is the,</v>

2013
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:55.670
<v Speaker 2>what's exciting to watch for a person like you,</v>

2014
00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:58.010
<v Speaker 2>a person like me who's like sitting by the.</v>

<v Speaker 2>How is this going to play out?</v>

2016
00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:00.603
<v Speaker 2>What's gonna work?</v>

2017
00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:01.520
<v Speaker 2>What's gonna work?</v>

2018
00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.353
<v Speaker 2>What works?</v>

2019
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:03.370
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>

2020
00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2021
00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:07.190
<v Speaker 2>I want to see what works when when I see a guy like ben asked her and I want to</v>

2022
00:53:07.191 --> 00:53:08.690
<v Speaker 2>see what works well,</v>

2023
00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:10.700
<v Speaker 2>he's a three to one favorite over robbie lawler.</v>

2024
00:53:10.701 --> 00:53:11.720
<v Speaker 2>Holy shit.</v>

2025
00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:12.740
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

2026
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:14.270
<v Speaker 2>Just added another fight to this card.</v>

2027
00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:15.021
<v Speaker 2>Listen man,</v>

2028
00:53:15.021 --> 00:53:19.150
<v Speaker 2>you can't sleep on robbie fucking law.</v>

2029
00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.440
<v Speaker 2>Don't sleep on robbie lawler.</v>

2030
00:53:21.441 --> 00:53:22.460
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

2031
00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:23.691
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

2032
00:53:23.691 --> 00:53:25.400
<v Speaker 2>Three to 1:30.</v>

2033
00:53:25.401 --> 00:53:26.330
<v Speaker 2>One is horror glued.</v>

2034
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:27.530
<v Speaker 2>Robbie lawler can bressler.</v>

2035
00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Robin has been shutting people's lights out since the early two.</v>

2036
00:53:31.831 --> 00:53:32.664
<v Speaker 2>Thousands.</v>

2037
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:33.623
<v Speaker 2>Decent bet then.</v>

2038
00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.620
<v Speaker 2>So fucking good.</v>

2039
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:35.573
<v Speaker 2>I would take,</v>

2040
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:40.630
<v Speaker 2>I'd take the robbie lawler six actually being three to 100 to make $300 plus</v>

2041
00:53:43.231 --> 00:53:44.064
<v Speaker 2>2:30.</v>

2042
00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:45.840
<v Speaker 2>Two 33 to one.</v>

2043
00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:48.670
<v Speaker 2>So you'd have to win the bet three to win one on aspirin,</v>

2044
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2045
00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:49.410
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

2046
00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2047
00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:50.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2048
00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.151
<v Speaker 2>I'd take that bad.</v>

2049
00:53:51.151 --> 00:53:51.751
<v Speaker 2>It's a good bet,</v>

2050
00:53:51.751 --> 00:53:52.110
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2051
00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:56.640
<v Speaker 2>I'd like aspirin's chances because I think that wrestling is just on another</v>

2052
00:53:56.641 --> 00:53:57.660
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

2053
00:53:57.730 --> 00:53:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2054
00:53:58.320 --> 00:53:59.250
<v Speaker 2>that's the fight.</v>

2055
00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Here's the fight.</v>

2056
00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:02.040
<v Speaker 2>One 65 khabib.</v>

2057
00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:02.910
<v Speaker 2>Ben aspirin.</v>

2058
00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:09.510
<v Speaker 2>I guess bank could make 6,500 percent.</v>

2059
00:54:09.511 --> 00:54:11.370
<v Speaker 2>He can make 6,500 percent.</v>

2060
00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:12.031
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

2061
00:54:12.031 --> 00:54:15.240
<v Speaker 2>He wants to make 65 because he's good friends with tyron and he's like,</v>

2062
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:18.150
<v Speaker 2>I'll be the 65 pound champ tire and be the 70 or 75,</v>

2063
00:54:18.151 --> 00:54:18.361
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2064
00:54:18.361 --> 00:54:20.010
<v Speaker 2>They decided to go with that.</v>

2065
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:22.540
<v Speaker 2>That's the fight khabib versus ben asked me,</v>

2066
00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:23.460
<v Speaker 2>because I'm teLling you man,</v>

2067
00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:24.510
<v Speaker 2>ben aspirin,</v>

2068
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:28.560
<v Speaker 2>they just put his face on the camera the other day while he was in the crowd and</v>

2069
00:54:28.561 --> 00:54:29.720
<v Speaker 2>the audience went crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Now they know who he is now.</v>

2075
00:54:36.751 --> 00:54:38.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like he's been building momentum.</v>

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:39.840

2110
00:55:21.961 --> 00:55:24.300
<v Speaker 2>very excited about because like right now,</v>

2111
00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:25.420
<v Speaker 2>khabib,</v>

2112
00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:29.430
<v Speaker 2>the number one fight for khabib I believe is tony ferguson.</v>

2113
00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:30.760
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a big fight.</v>

2114
00:55:30.761 --> 00:55:31.594
<v Speaker 2>A giant fight.</v>

2115
00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:33.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm real excited about that.</v>

2116
00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:33.541
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

2117
00:55:33.541 --> 00:55:33.930
<v Speaker 2>I heard,</v>

2118
00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:38.930
<v Speaker 2>I heard rumors and I was spoken to dustin of that whole tony and khabib,</v>

2119
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:41.910
<v Speaker 2>dustin and conor fight each other.</v>

2120
00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:43.290
<v Speaker 2>I heard that too,</v>

2121
00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.120
<v Speaker 2>but here's the cynical part of me.</v>

2122
00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:48.840
<v Speaker 2>I know that nate diaz was supposed to be fighting dustin,</v>

2123
00:55:48.841 --> 00:55:51.330
<v Speaker 2>but dustin had a pull out with a hip injury,</v>

2124
00:55:51.331 --> 00:55:51.751
<v Speaker 2>so I'm like,</v>

2125
00:55:51.751 --> 00:55:51.961
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2126
00:55:51.961 --> 00:55:54.990
<v Speaker 2>well how bad is his hip injury and when is that going to heal up,</v>

2127
00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:55.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2128
00:55:55.511 --> 00:55:57.000
<v Speaker 2>and isn't going to heal up,</v>

2129
00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.890
<v Speaker 2>or is it going to be a reoccurring thing?</v>

2130
00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:03.780
<v Speaker 2>And them saying that dustin is going to step in and he's going to fight conor.</v>

2131
00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:05.550
<v Speaker 2>That is a good fight.</v>

2132
00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:07.590
<v Speaker 2>But does that make nate diaz go?</v>

2133
00:56:07.591 --> 00:56:09.460
<v Speaker 2>what does that make nate?</v>

2134
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Nate diaz come back to the bargaining table and then they have like.</v>

2135
00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.020
<v Speaker 2>Because that's the big money fight.</v>

2136
00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:15.780
<v Speaker 2>Big money.</v>

2137
00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:16.680
<v Speaker 2>If I was a promoter,</v>

2138
00:56:16.681 --> 00:56:17.514
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a promoter.</v>

2139
00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:18.450
<v Speaker 2>If I was a promoter,</v>

2140
00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:19.030
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

2141
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:19.290
<v Speaker 2>nate,</v>

2142
00:56:19.290 --> 00:56:20.123
<v Speaker 2>what are we going to do?</v>

2143
00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.040

2151
00:56:38.111 --> 00:56:40.840
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why they want to have brock lesnar fight dc is because they want</v>

2152
00:56:40.841 --> 00:56:41.890
<v Speaker 2>to make a shit ton of money,</v>

00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:15.050
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work.</v>

2175
00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:16.420
<v Speaker 2>It works the opposite way.</v>

2176
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Works the opposite way.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There was a good lesson for cowboy though.</v>

2192
00:57:32.201 --> 00:57:35.320
<v Speaker 2>So important fight for them in terms of like the path of his career.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

2453
01:04:11.290 --> 01:04:13.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's in a precarious situation.</v>

2454
01:04:13.031 --> 01:04:15.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why hbo decided to get out of the boxing game.</v>

2455
01:04:15.491 --> 01:04:16.540
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of crazy to me,</v>

2456
01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:20.140
<v Speaker 2>but after all those years of covering the greatest fights ever,</v>

2457
01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:21.610
<v Speaker 2>hbo decided to just pull out.</v>

2458
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:24.580
<v Speaker 2>I know that when the guy that started that or not started it,</v>

2459
01:04:24.581 --> 01:04:27.430
<v Speaker 2>but that guy who's like the pay per view model creator,</v>

2460
01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:28.620
<v Speaker 2>mark taffet and he,</v>

2461
01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:30.300
<v Speaker 2>he left and I don't know if,</v>

2462
01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.050
<v Speaker 2>if that had something to do with it,</v>

2463
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:34.960
<v Speaker 2>I'd imagine it has to be a profitability thing.</v>

2464
01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:36.550
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the only thing that makes sense.</v>

2465
01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:37.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2466
01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:38.230
<v Speaker 2>It has to be that they just,</v>

2467
01:04:38.231 --> 01:04:39.160
<v Speaker 2>what they were losing money.</v>

2468
01:04:39.161 --> 01:04:39.281
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2469
01:04:39.281 --> 01:04:40.990
<v Speaker 2>you gotta think the production is huge,</v>

2470
01:04:40.991 --> 01:04:41.201
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2471
01:04:41.201 --> 01:04:43.180
<v Speaker 2>You got all these cameras and all those thing and they're,</v>

2472
01:04:43.181 --> 01:04:44.130
<v Speaker 2>they're alive.</v>

2473
01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:45.910
<v Speaker 2>They got to get the trucks that production trucks.</v>

2474
01:04:46.270 --> 01:04:51.100
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a live sports is probably an extremely expensive thing to pull</v>

2475
01:04:51.101 --> 01:04:51.934
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>

2476
01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:52.410
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2477
01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:53.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2478
01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:53.681
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2479
01:04:53.681 --> 01:04:54.514
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense.</v>

2480
01:04:54.550 --> 01:04:55.660
<v Speaker 2>But they were the best at it.</v>

2481
01:04:55.690 --> 01:04:57.100
<v Speaker 2>Lampley and kellerman.</v>

2482
01:04:57.370 --> 01:04:58.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean fucking commentary.</v>

2483
01:04:58.901 --> 01:05:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Roy jones jr doing commentary with them sometimes.</v>

2484
01:05:01.570 --> 01:05:02.403
<v Speaker 2>Andre ward,</v>

2485
01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:03.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2486
01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:05.370
<v Speaker 2>they had some of the best fights ever.</v>

2487
01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.430
<v Speaker 2>The best team ever.</v>

2488
01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:07.481
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

2489
01:05:07.481 --> 01:05:08.314
<v Speaker 2>Jones jr.</v>

2490
01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:09.430
<v Speaker 2>I loved Roy Jones,</v>

2491
01:05:09.431 --> 01:05:09.750
<v Speaker 2>jr.</v>

2492
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:11.830
<v Speaker 2>tried to get him in here to shit,</v>

01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 2>he could</v>

2499
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:18.940
<v Speaker 3>box Roy Jones.</v>

2500
01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:24.440
<v Speaker 2>I love your reaction.</v>

2501

<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.620
<v Speaker 2>man who's delusional.</v>

01:05:36.050 --> 01:05:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2509
01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:37.710
<v Speaker 2>You got to add that caveat.</v>

2510
01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:39.251
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2511
01:05:39.251 --> 01:05:41.410
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking beast if you look at his body,</v>

2512
01:05:41.411 --> 01:05:41.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2513
01:05:41.790 --> 01:05:42.101
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2514
01:05:42.101 --> 01:05:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Michael Jordan is just jacked full six pack bill.</v>

2515
01:05:45.821 --> 01:05:47.020
<v Speaker 2>Like a greek goD.</v>

2516
01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:49.330
<v Speaker 2>But son stop.</v>

2517
01:05:49.331 --> 01:05:50.440
<v Speaker 2>It creates a movie.</v>

2518
01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:52.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a movie man.</v>

2519
01:05:52.091 --> 01:05:52.391
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2520
01:05:52.391 --> 01:05:54.010
<v Speaker 2>You felt good hitting those pads.</v>

2521
01:05:54.830 --> 01:05:55.011
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2522
01:05:55.011 --> 01:05:55.611

01:05:55.611 --> 01:05:56.444
<v Speaker 3>Look at him.</v>

2524
01:05:57.350 --> 01:06:00.210
<v Speaker 3>Roy jones jr will light you up like a christmas tree in times square.</v>

2525
01:06:00.211 --> 01:06:01.280
<v Speaker 3>This rodman in this quarter.</v>

2526
01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:02.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's dennis rodman.</v>

2527
01:06:02.441 --> 01:06:03.890
<v Speaker 3>I think it's his brother.</v>

2528
01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:08.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's jacked for sure.</v>

2529
01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:09.381
<v Speaker 3>It looks good,</v>

2530
01:06:09.381 --> 01:06:12.200
<v Speaker 3>but listen to terrible disaster.</v>

2531
01:06:12.350 --> 01:06:13.340
<v Speaker 3>Check out my segway.</v>

2532
01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:14.540
<v Speaker 3>Like if he thinks he's tough,</v>

2533
01:06:14.541 --> 01:06:16.040
<v Speaker 3>he can fight in pfl for me.</v>

2534
01:06:16.041 --> 01:06:16.900
<v Speaker 3>And ah.</v>

2535
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:20.180
<v Speaker 3>So what is the deal with pfl in the million dollar thing?</v>

2536
01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:24.610
<v Speaker 3>Like what is it for each individual weight class on,</v>

2537
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:25.700
<v Speaker 3>on new Year's eve,</v>

2538
01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:26.151
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

2539
01:06:26.151 --> 01:06:27.920
<v Speaker 3>there's a $10,000,000 prize pool.</v>

2540
01:06:28.790 --> 01:06:29.601
<v Speaker 3>All the winners,</v>

2541
01:06:29.601 --> 01:06:32.870
<v Speaker 3>six winners of their championship fights get a million dollars.</v>

2542
01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:34.720
<v Speaker 3>So three fights for me.</v>

2543
01:06:34.721 --> 01:06:35.720
<v Speaker 3>Million dollars because it's playoffs.</v>

2544
01:06:35.721 --> 01:06:36.081
<v Speaker 3>Fights,</v>

2545
01:06:36.081 --> 01:06:36.530
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2546
01:06:36.530 --> 01:06:39.740
<v Speaker 3>The playoffs are cool too though because once you make the off,</v>

2547
01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:41.240
<v Speaker 3>if you lose in the quarters,</v>

2548
01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:42.260
<v Speaker 3>it's a guaranteed 50.</v>

2549
01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.150
<v Speaker 3>You lose in the semis.</v>

2550
01:06:44.151 --> 01:06:44.984
<v Speaker 3>That's 100.</v>

2551
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:46.670
<v Speaker 3>And then the finals are,</v>

2552
01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:47.690
<v Speaker 3>the winner gets a million.</v>

2553
01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:48.180
<v Speaker 3>The loser.</v>

2554
01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:49.870
<v Speaker 3>200 still good.</v>

2555
01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:50.541
<v Speaker 3>Still good money,</v>

2556
01:06:50.541 --> 01:06:50.870
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2557
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:51.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2558
01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:53.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy to see how good vinnie's doing.</v>

2559
01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:55.490
<v Speaker 3>Vinny meghalaya beast.</v>

2560
01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:57.440
<v Speaker 3>he's a completely different guy.</v>

2561
01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:58.370
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2562
01:06:58.370 --> 01:06:59.800
<v Speaker 3>he always had the,</v>

2563
01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:00.770
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2564
01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:04.190
<v Speaker 3>some of the best jujitsu you're ever going to see an mma peter.</v>

2565
01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:04.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2566
01:07:04.790 --> 01:07:07.100
<v Speaker 3>But then hiS striking wasn't up to par,</v>

2567
01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:07.963
<v Speaker 3>but now it is.</v>

2568
01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:09.320
<v Speaker 3>His striking was good.</v>

2569
01:07:09.321 --> 01:07:14.321
<v Speaker 3>I mean he won two fights because of his striking one with strikes and one by</v>

2570
01:07:15.021 --> 01:07:16.190
<v Speaker 3>setting it up with his striking.</v>

2571
01:07:16.191 --> 01:07:16.910
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2572
01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:17.500
<v Speaker 3>vinny,</v>

2573
01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:17.980
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2574
01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:19.490
<v Speaker 3>he's really working out and he says,</v>

2575
01:07:19.491 --> 01:07:21.860
<v Speaker 3>he says he claims to be training four times a day for this.</v>

2576
01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:22.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2577
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:23.000
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

2578
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.050
<v Speaker 3>he looked that way,</v>

2579
01:07:24.051 --> 01:07:25.280
<v Speaker 3>he didn't get out of the first round,</v>

2580
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:29.210
<v Speaker 3>like each fight got longer and the longest flight with like two minutes,</v>

2581
01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:30.630
<v Speaker 3>33 seconds or something like that.</v>

2582
01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:31.920
<v Speaker 3>His jujitsu.</v>

2583
01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Who's on another level?</v>

2584
01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:36.060
<v Speaker 2>Vinny magallanes is one to just forget about mma.</v>

2585
01:07:36.061 --> 01:07:39.930
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the best in his weight class on the planet earth in jujitsu.</v>

2586
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:41.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a monster.</v>

2587
01:07:41.450 --> 01:07:43.550
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever see when a flying arm barred paid upon?</v>

2588

2595
01:07:56.671 --> 01:07:58.500
<v Speaker 2>air and snatches his arm out of nowhere.</v>

2596
01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:00.860
<v Speaker 2>Flip flips them over on his back and paid upon,</v>

2597
01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:01.351
<v Speaker 2>tapped out.</v>

2598
01:08:01.351 --> 01:08:02.184
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

2599
01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:03.573
<v Speaker 3>if it needs a ninja,</v>

2600
01:08:03.790 --> 01:08:04.890
<v Speaker 3>he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

2601
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.940
<v Speaker 3>Motherfucker on.</v>

2602
01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.353
<v Speaker 3>That's um,</v>

2603
01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:12.980
<v Speaker 3>I think that that is the fight that I'm the second flight that I'm looking to</v>

2604
01:08:12.981 --> 01:08:14.020
<v Speaker 3>the most for the,</v>

2605
01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:14.390
<v Speaker 3>for the,</v>

2606
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:15.223
<v Speaker 3>for the finals.</v>

2607
01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:16.250
<v Speaker 3>Then that ray cooper,</v>

2608
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:17.990
<v Speaker 1>the third dude,</v>

2609
01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:18.861
<v Speaker 1>he's another one.</v>

2610
01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Five slash seven.</v>

2611
01:08:19.701 --> 01:08:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2612
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Hay makers vicious.</v>

2613
01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Why did they make jake shields fight that dude again,</v>

2614
01:08:25.730 --> 01:08:27.770
<v Speaker 1>this just how it played out.</v>

2615
01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:28.491
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2616
01:08:28.491 --> 01:08:29.580
<v Speaker 1>The number eight seed right?</v>

2617
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Smashed by by ray and then he's got to fight him again.</v>

2618
01:08:33.081 --> 01:08:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2619
01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:38.630
<v Speaker 1>and it's like he didn't have much time in between the five months,</v>

2620
01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:39.800
<v Speaker 1>not even five months.</v>

2621
01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Formula was like,</v>

2622
01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:41.451
<v Speaker 1>let me see.</v>

2623
01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:44.150
<v Speaker 1>The first one happened in like july.</v>

2624
01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:45.410
<v Speaker 1>The second was october,</v>

2625
01:08:45.411 --> 01:08:46.220
<v Speaker 1>july,</v>

2626
01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:46.551
<v Speaker 1>august,</v>

2627
01:08:46.551 --> 01:08:47.600
<v Speaker 1>september three months.</v>

2628
01:08:47.601 --> 01:08:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2629
01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:49.940
<v Speaker 1>How crazy is it that jake fought his dad?</v>

2630
01:08:50.170 --> 01:08:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Jake ford is that 14 years ago and then when they were scheduled to fight the</v>

2631
01:08:54.351 --> 01:08:55.184
<v Speaker 1>first time.</v>

2632
01:08:55.890 --> 01:08:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Jake his favorite,</v>

2633
01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.970
<v Speaker 1>because we know who jake jake shields is.</v>

2634
01:08:58.971 --> 01:09:00.320
<v Speaker 1>We don't know who ray cooper.</v>

2635
01:09:00.321 --> 01:09:05.321
<v Speaker 1>The third is we don't know state champion wrestler hay makers hits like a truck</v>

2636
01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:09.530
<v Speaker 1>and he's just a tank of a man and when you see him in there,</v>

2637
01:09:09.531 --> 01:09:12.680
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't look as small as like when I stand next to them and talk to him,</v>

2638
01:09:12.681 --> 01:09:13.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like he's a short,</v>

2639
01:09:13.611 --> 01:09:14.444
<v Speaker 1>stocky guy,</v>

2640
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:17.390
<v Speaker 1>but then when he's in there against jake shields,</v>

2641
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:18.410
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>

2642
01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:18.891
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2643
01:09:18.891 --> 01:09:19.521
<v Speaker 1>That persona,</v>

2644
01:09:19.521 --> 01:09:20.181
<v Speaker 1>that attitude,</v>

2645
01:09:20.181 --> 01:09:20.991
<v Speaker 1>that personality.</v>

2646
01:09:20.991 --> 01:09:24.650
<v Speaker 1>He's coming forward and jake's backing up and it makes him look bigger than he</v>

2647
01:09:24.651 --> 01:09:25.220
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

2648
01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:25.491
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2649
01:09:25.491 --> 01:09:26.570
<v Speaker 1>he's only five slash seven,</v>

2650
01:09:26.810 --> 01:09:28.020
<v Speaker 1>but jesus fucking christ,</v>

2651
01:09:28.021 --> 01:09:28.854
<v Speaker 1>he hit so hard.</v>

2652
01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.660
<v Speaker 1>He's terrifying to any.</v>

2653
01:09:30.661 --> 01:09:35.630
<v Speaker 1>He's crispr technique like it's not just like throwing wide looping fucking</v>

2654
01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:37.310
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous punches like ricardo,</v>

2655
01:09:37.311 --> 01:09:39.500
<v Speaker 1>my org or some shit that they hit you.</v>

2656
01:09:39.501 --> 01:09:40.334
<v Speaker 1>You're fucked.</v>

2657
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.701
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2658
01:09:40.701 --> 01:09:42.500
<v Speaker 1>he's throwing everything with great technique.</v>

2659
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:44.330
<v Speaker 1>He's a monster.</v>

2660
01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:44.570
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2661
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:45.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

2662
01:09:45.681 --> 01:09:46.514
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2663
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:49.080
<v Speaker 1>he's been my biggest favorite this,</v>

2664
01:09:49.081 --> 01:09:49.914
<v Speaker 1>this season.</v>

2665
01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Like just watching.</v>

2666
01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Well he's unquestionably world class and so it was vinny and that's one of the</v>

2667
01:09:53.931 --> 01:09:55.700
<v Speaker 1>more interesting things about today's climate.</v>

2668
01:09:55.730 --> 01:10:00.730
<v Speaker 1>I feel like with bella tour with a pfl for absolutely with one fc.</v>

2669
01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:05.300
<v Speaker 1>You have world class fighters in many organizations.</v>

2670
01:10:05.301 --> 01:10:09.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the ufc and these guys can all come over and compete and</v>

2671
01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:13.280
<v Speaker 1>essentially at the top of the heap right now and basically you've got lance</v>

2672
01:10:13.281 --> 01:10:14.114
<v Speaker 1>palmer,</v>

2673
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:18.350
<v Speaker 1>these guys in almost every organization that I feel like I can compete with the</v>

2674
01:10:18.351 --> 01:10:20.330
<v Speaker 1>best in the world in any organization.</v>

2675
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:21.040
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2676
01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.610
<v Speaker 1>it's getting pretty even now,</v>

2677
01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:24.650
<v Speaker 1>much more so than it was four or five years ago.</v>

2678
01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:25.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2679
01:10:25.131 --> 01:10:28.250
<v Speaker 1>it's weird though because all of these things happened in the past.</v>

2680
01:10:28.251 --> 01:10:28.821
<v Speaker 1>We had prIde,</v>

2681
01:10:28.821 --> 01:10:29.720
<v Speaker 1>we had strived for us,</v>

2682
01:10:29.721 --> 01:10:29.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2683
01:10:29.931 --> 01:10:32.240
<v Speaker 1>the wec and then those things got absorbed,</v>

2684
01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:32.690
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2685
01:10:32.690 --> 01:10:35.630
<v Speaker 1>And then all the best guys ended up in the ufc and it's like,</v>

2686
01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:37.220
<v Speaker 1>well all the best guys are here now.</v>

2687
01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:39.140
<v Speaker 1>And like now these other organizations,</v>

2688
01:10:39.141 --> 01:10:42.590
<v Speaker 1>one was still around in one was always not a threat but always,</v>

2689
01:10:42.710 --> 01:10:44.540
<v Speaker 1>always had quality quality fighters,</v>

2690
01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:45.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2691
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:46.400
<v Speaker 1>now we know that the one,</v>

2692
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:48.530
<v Speaker 1>there's some really the guys over at one.</v>

2693
01:10:48.531 --> 01:10:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Then we got asked him coming over now,</v>

2694
01:10:50.690 --> 01:10:51.570
<v Speaker 1>the pfl starting now,</v>

2695
01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:53.630
<v Speaker 1>like guys like vinny is his career.</v>

2696
01:10:53.770 --> 01:10:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Like he's a different guy now.</v>

2697
01:10:55.530 --> 01:10:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Like with the fight,</v>

2698
01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.530
<v Speaker 1>he can compete with anybody at two.</v>

2699
01:10:58.531 --> 01:10:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh five.</v>

2700
01:10:58.930 --> 01:10:59.763
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2701
01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a very different story for a lot of guys,</v>

2702
01:11:02.631 --> 01:11:03.770
<v Speaker 1>but now what happens when,</v>

2703
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:05.870
<v Speaker 1>when these guys in the ufc,</v>

2704
01:11:05.871 --> 01:11:10.871
<v Speaker 1>the number eighth rank heavyweight in the ufc sees a guy make a million dollars.</v>

2705
01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:14.603
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

2706
01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:15.451
<v Speaker 1>And he's.</v>

2707
01:11:15.451 --> 01:11:16.284
<v Speaker 1>And he's thinking,</v>

2708
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:17.540
<v Speaker 1>fuck that guy up.</v>

2709
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:23.100
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

2710
01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:23.640
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

2711
01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:24.450
<v Speaker 1>It's good for everybody.</v>

2712
01:11:24.450 --> 01:11:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2713
01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:26.520
<v Speaker 1>competition is great for the sport.</v>

2714
01:11:26.521 --> 01:11:27.570
<v Speaker 1>It's great for the athletes,</v>

2715
01:11:27.571 --> 01:11:29.910
<v Speaker 1>it's great for the organizations because the organizations,</v>

2716
01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:31.080
<v Speaker 1>whether they like it or not,</v>

2717
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.411
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna.</v>

2718
01:11:31.411 --> 01:11:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Make them pick up their game,</v>

2719
01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:33.540
<v Speaker 1>going to make them step up.</v>

2720
01:11:33.541 --> 01:11:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't like to pick up the game,</v>

2721
01:11:34.981 --> 01:11:35.290
<v Speaker 1>joe.</v>

2722
01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Some people like to because they just like to be comfortable that it's not live.</v>

2723
01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:39.660
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

2724
01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:40.480
<v Speaker 1>That is not lying.</v>

2725
01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not piCk up your game.</v>

2726
01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Then I got.</v>

2727
01:11:43.571 --> 01:11:43.921
<v Speaker 1>I got.</v>

2728
01:11:43.921 --> 01:11:44.130
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

2729
01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:48.750
<v Speaker 1>There was something I wanted to show you that I'm bed reminded me of why I need</v>

2730
01:11:48.751 --> 01:11:49.620

2731
01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:53.820
<v Speaker 1>I was looking through my phone a couple months ago and I have this video of my</v>

2732
01:11:53.821 --> 01:11:54.151

2735
01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to send it to jamie?</v>

2924
01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:07.973
<v Speaker 3>That was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3026
01:18:27.481 --> 01:18:28.280
<v Speaker 1>I heard about that.</v>

3027
01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:29.810
<v Speaker 1>It's right next to like fs.</v>

3028
01:18:29.811 --> 01:18:31.120
<v Speaker 1>One fs,</v>

3029
01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:31.580
<v Speaker 1>one to two.</v>

3030
01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen mbcs.</v>

3031
01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Sn is 2:20.</v>

3032
01:18:34.230 --> 01:18:35.330
<v Speaker 1>So not great in that channel.</v>

3033
01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:37.700
<v Speaker 1>what is nbc?</v>

3034
01:18:37.701 --> 01:18:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Is plans for this,</v>

3035
01:18:39.230 --> 01:18:39.650
<v Speaker 1>for this?</v>

3036
01:18:39.650 --> 01:18:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Is this like,</v>

3037
01:18:40.190 --> 01:18:43.010
<v Speaker 1>this is obviously they're spending a lot of money because they're given a</v>

3038
01:18:43.011 --> 01:18:45.020
<v Speaker 1>million dollar prize to three different guys.</v>

3039
01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:45.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3040
01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:47.950
<v Speaker 1>one of the pfl is its own organization now,</v>

3041
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.491
<v Speaker 1>so it's a,</v>

3042
01:18:48.491 --> 01:18:49.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a partnership with nbc,</v>

3043
01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:55.010
<v Speaker 1>so the pfl puts the money up for the fighters and nbc does have,</v>

3044
01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:55.880
<v Speaker 1>does it,</v>

3045
01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:56.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3046
01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:58.100
<v Speaker 1>there's an influx of money coming in from nbc,</v>

3047
01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.290
<v Speaker 1>but the pfl is in control of all of that.</v>

3048
01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:03.230
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know it nbc plans are,</v>

3049
01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:03.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3050
01:19:03.831 --> 01:19:05.300
<v Speaker 1>but the pfl has big plans.</v>

3051
01:19:05.330 --> 01:19:09.170
<v Speaker 1>They have a contract with nbc that I believe the contract is up this year,</v>

3052
01:19:09.171 --> 01:19:10.970
<v Speaker 1>but of course they're going to renegotiate,</v>

3053
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3054
01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:16.100
<v Speaker 1>they're going to work things out and this is the only product that nbc has.</v>

3055
01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Mma is hot right now.</v>

3056
01:19:17.151 --> 01:19:18.650
<v Speaker 1>So I don't believe nbc wants to,</v>

3057
01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:19.880
<v Speaker 1>wants to let the pfo go.</v>

3058
01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:24.800
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that seems to be the bottleneck it with other organizations is</v>

3059
01:19:24.801 --> 01:19:25.634
<v Speaker 1>the name.</v>

3060
01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:27.141
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

3061
01:19:27.141 --> 01:19:28.520
<v Speaker 1>the ufc is like the nfl,</v>

3062
01:19:28.570 --> 01:19:28.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3063
01:19:28.770 --> 01:19:29.450
<v Speaker 1>So I got this.</v>

3064
01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:30.410
<v Speaker 1>It's the biggest name.</v>

3065
01:19:30.411 --> 01:19:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Ufc has ever made it to a lot of people to a lot of people.</v>

3066
01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:35.150
<v Speaker 1>And then you hear about the pfl what's,</v>

3067
01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:35.870
<v Speaker 1>what's that mean?</v>

3068
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:36.860
<v Speaker 1>What's bella tour mean?</v>

3069
01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:37.851
<v Speaker 1>Whereas one fc,</v>

3070
01:19:37.851 --> 01:19:38.684
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

3071
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:39.540
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean anything.</v>

3072
01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:40.070
<v Speaker 1>You're just like,</v>

3073
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:41.270
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get.</v>

3074
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:43.730
<v Speaker 1>I think bella tours making some ground,</v>

3075
01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:44.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3076
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:48.080
<v Speaker 1>because they've been doing plenty of television events and paramount network is</v>

3077
01:19:48.081 --> 01:19:48.831
<v Speaker 1>a big network.</v>

3078
01:19:48.831 --> 01:19:50.120
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people get the chance to see it.</v>

3079
01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:51.590
<v Speaker 1>they've had good ratings,</v>

3080
01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:53.630
<v Speaker 1>but it still hasn't caught fire.</v>

3081
01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:54.493
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3082
01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.060
<v Speaker 1>The thing with the pfl yeah,</v>

3083
01:19:56.061 --> 01:20:00.200
<v Speaker 1>the name professional fighters league like you hear pfl,</v>

3084
01:20:00.201 --> 01:20:00.951
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what that means.</v>

3085
01:20:00.951 --> 01:20:01.850
<v Speaker 1>You have professional fighters,</v>

3086
01:20:01.851 --> 01:20:02.000
<v Speaker 1>lee,</v>

3087
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.470
<v Speaker 1>you have an idea what's going on,</v>

3088
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:04.190
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

3089
01:20:04.190 --> 01:20:05.023
<v Speaker 1>it's good name,</v>

3090
01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 1>it's a great name and it's the name</v>

3091
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:08.201
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

3092
01:20:08.201 --> 01:20:09.750
<v Speaker 3>is representative of what it is.</v>

3093
01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:10.350
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3094
01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:10.861
<v Speaker 3>it's a league.</v>

3095
01:20:10.861 --> 01:20:11.910
<v Speaker 3>We have a regular season.</v>

3096
01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:13.920
<v Speaker 3>So you fight in the regular season,</v>

3097
01:20:13.921 --> 01:20:15.810
<v Speaker 3>you score a certain amount of points,</v>

3098
01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:17.670
<v Speaker 3>you score points by getting finishes,</v>

3099
01:20:17.671 --> 01:20:18.241
<v Speaker 3>you score points.</v>

3100
01:20:18.241 --> 01:20:19.350
<v Speaker 3>We're getting finished in the first,</v>

3101
01:20:19.370 --> 01:20:19.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3102
01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:19.891
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3103
01:20:19.891 --> 01:20:20.551
<v Speaker 3>you win the fight.</v>

3104
01:20:20.551 --> 01:20:22.440
<v Speaker 3>That's three points you get to finishing the first.</v>

3105
01:20:22.441 --> 01:20:23.520
<v Speaker 3>That's three additional points,</v>

3106
01:20:23.521 --> 01:20:24.091
<v Speaker 3>second round,</v>

3107
01:20:24.091 --> 01:20:24.571
<v Speaker 3>two points,</v>

3108
01:20:24.571 --> 01:20:25.470
<v Speaker 3>third now one point.</v>

3109
01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:27.720
<v Speaker 3>And then at the end of the regular season,</v>

3110
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:31.530
<v Speaker 3>the top aide seeds get into the playoffs and you fight by your seed.</v>

3111
01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:33.570
<v Speaker 3>So that's why jake had the fyc fight.</v>

3112
01:20:33.571 --> 01:20:37.890
<v Speaker 3>Ray cooper again is jake kind of edged into that eight spot and ray cooper was</v>

3113
01:20:37.891 --> 01:20:38.724
<v Speaker 3>the number one</v>

3114
01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.550
<v Speaker 2>might want to rework that</v>

3115
01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:46.110
<v Speaker 2>to the finished in the third round is worth less than the finished in the first.</v>

3116
01:20:46.111 --> 01:20:47.190
<v Speaker 2>So don't make any sense to me.</v>

3117
01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:47.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3118
01:20:47.641 --> 01:20:48.450
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

3119
01:20:48.450 --> 01:20:50.230
<v Speaker 2>because it's a little tougher to finishing the third.</v>

3120
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:51.511
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

3121
01:20:51.511 --> 01:20:53.190
<v Speaker 2>it's a finish finishes a finish.</v>

3122
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3123
01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:53.901
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3124
01:20:53.901 --> 01:20:54.734
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3125
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:55.820
<v Speaker 3>I agree,</v>

3126
01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:58.400
<v Speaker 3>but I don't</v>

3127
01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:00.710
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes it takes a while to finish a guy.</v>

3128
01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:01.230
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3129
01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:01.520
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3130
01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:02.630
<v Speaker 2>here's a perfect example.</v>

3131
01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:06.920
<v Speaker 2>Say you're fighting a guy like josh thompson,</v>

3132
01:21:06.970 --> 01:21:07.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3133
01:21:07.190 --> 01:21:10.130
<v Speaker 2>back in the day like this is a tough fight.</v>

3134
01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:14.960
<v Speaker 2>These are two world class fighters versus you fighting Henry Smith from fucking</v>

3135
01:21:14.961 --> 01:21:16.160
<v Speaker 2>albuquerque that nobody knows.</v>

3136
01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:18.500
<v Speaker 2>It's different if you finished that guy in the first round like,</v>

3137
01:21:18.501 --> 01:21:18.681
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3138
01:21:18.681 --> 01:21:19.940
<v Speaker 2>you've got to finish in the first round,</v>

3139
01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:22.670
<v Speaker 2>but did you get to finish over a world class guy?</v>

3140
01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:25.010
<v Speaker 2>If you've get a finish of a world class guy in the third,</v>

3141
01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.210
<v Speaker 2>that's worth more.</v>

3142
01:21:26.650 --> 01:21:29.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's depending upon who you're fighting and what style they are,</v>

3143
01:21:29.691 --> 01:21:30.890
<v Speaker 2>how resilient they are,</v>

3144
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:32.270
<v Speaker 2>how difficult they are to beat,</v>

3145
01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.130
<v Speaker 3>but then it gets,</v>

3146
01:21:33.130 --> 01:21:38.130
<v Speaker 3>becomes more subjective when you're talking about the difficulty and matching up</v>

3147
01:21:38.801 --> 01:21:42.840
<v Speaker 3>styles and then you started to bring the odds into it from like,</v>

3148
01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.780
<v Speaker 3>I guess it wouldn't be betting odds but similar to betting on.</v>

3149
01:21:46.930 --> 01:21:47.763
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3150
01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:53.040
<v Speaker 3>so it's one of those things where there is no perfect way but you take what you</v>

3151
01:21:54.401 --> 01:21:55.720
<v Speaker 3>have and do the best you can.</v>

3152
01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:56.301
<v Speaker 2>I get it,</v>

3153
01:21:56.301 --> 01:21:59.000
<v Speaker 2>but a point the differences in two points,</v>

3154
01:21:59.030 --> 01:22:01.160
<v Speaker 2>like you get three points for the first round,</v>

3155
01:22:01.161 --> 01:22:06.161
<v Speaker 2>but one point if the third phone call that finishes a finnish man,</v>

3156
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:06.550
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3157
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.750
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

3158
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:08.180
<v Speaker 3>So bonus points for finishes.</v>

3159
01:22:08.230 --> 01:22:10.130
<v Speaker 3>What is a finnish I,</v>

3160
01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:11.510
<v Speaker 3>I made that argument.</v>

3161
01:22:11.511 --> 01:22:13.930
<v Speaker 3>We had that conversation is like,</v>

3162
01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:15.711
<v Speaker 3>but then again,</v>

3163
01:22:15.711 --> 01:22:16.341
<v Speaker 3>then what do you do?</v>

3164
01:22:16.341 --> 01:22:17.030
<v Speaker 3>How do you get bullied?</v>

3165
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.361
<v Speaker 3>What do you get?</v>

3166
01:22:17.361 --> 01:22:18.170
<v Speaker 3>Bonus points for</v>

3167
01:22:18.170 --> 01:22:19.340
<v Speaker 2>his perfect example.</v>

3168
01:22:19.730 --> 01:22:21.410
<v Speaker 2>How dare you,</v>

3169
01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:26.360
<v Speaker 2>how dare you try to diminish [inaudible] rodriguez last second,</v>

3170
01:22:26.530 --> 01:22:29.150
<v Speaker 2>teo of the korean zombie and noticeable.</v>

3171
01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:32.360
<v Speaker 2>He shouldn't get all the points for that.</v>

3172
01:22:32.630 --> 01:22:33.860
<v Speaker 2>That was crazy.</v>

3173
01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:38.780
<v Speaker 2>He literally knocked the guy out with one second to go with a no look elbow</v>

3174
01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:40.233
<v Speaker 2>pack.</v>

3175
01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:42.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's all the points.</v>

3176
01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:43.220
<v Speaker 2>Give them all the points.</v>

3177
01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.920
<v Speaker 3>That's the git like.</v>

3178
01:22:44.921 --> 01:22:45.131
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3179
01:22:45.131 --> 01:22:45.341
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3180
01:22:45.341 --> 01:22:45.701
<v Speaker 3>You get,</v>

3181
01:22:45.701 --> 01:22:47.190
<v Speaker 3>you get so many points for finish.</v>

3182
01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:47.861
<v Speaker 3>Whether it be first,</v>

3183
01:22:47.861 --> 01:22:49.450
<v Speaker 3>second or third round finishes.</v>

3184
01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:51.220
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

3185
01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:51.550
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3186
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:52.251
<v Speaker 3>because the,</v>

3187
01:22:52.251 --> 01:22:52.721
<v Speaker 3>the one,</v>

3188
01:22:52.721 --> 01:22:54.670
<v Speaker 3>the one difference that we have is,</v>

3189
01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:57.610
<v Speaker 3>isn't a draw like both guYs get one point.</v>

3190
01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:58.750
<v Speaker 3>I feel that if,</v>

3191
01:22:58.810 --> 01:23:01.630
<v Speaker 3>if you or if it goes to a decision,</v>

3192
01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:03.100
<v Speaker 3>maybe you should get points,</v>

3193
01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:04.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3194
01:23:04.150 --> 01:23:06.460
<v Speaker 3>maybe we should get a point for surviving,</v>

3195
01:23:06.670 --> 01:23:09.880
<v Speaker 3>but the winner gets more and then if you get finished you get no points.</v>

3196
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:12.400
<v Speaker 3>But the finisher gets all the points.</v>

3197
01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:14.050
<v Speaker 3>Well it's,</v>

3198
01:23:14.050 --> 01:23:15.100
<v Speaker 3>it's definitelY squirrely.</v>

3199
01:23:15.810 --> 01:23:16.690
<v Speaker 3>The idea behind it.</v>

3200
01:23:16.691 --> 01:23:17.320
<v Speaker 3>SquIrrelly.</v>

3201
01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:18.280
<v Speaker 3>I get what they're doing,</v>

3202
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:20.423
<v Speaker 3>but I don't buy it.</v>

3203
01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:20.871
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3204
01:23:20.871 --> 01:23:21.520
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3205
01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:22.121
<v Speaker 3>I buy the,</v>

3206
01:23:22.121 --> 01:23:24.760
<v Speaker 3>I buy the fact that you got to get points because it's kinda like,</v>

3207
01:23:24.761 --> 01:23:26.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm kinda like college wrestling,</v>

3208
01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:27.673
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3209
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:28.930
<v Speaker 3>you get 10 points,</v>

3210
01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:30.670
<v Speaker 3>you get points for a pin,</v>

3211
01:23:30.970 --> 01:23:31.980
<v Speaker 3>you get four for the pin,</v>

3212
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:32.730
<v Speaker 3>you get three.</v>

3213
01:23:32.730 --> 01:23:33.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

3214
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.770
<v Speaker 3>you get five for the pen,</v>

3215
01:23:33.770 --> 01:23:34.280
<v Speaker 3>you get,</v>

3216
01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:36.550
<v Speaker 3>you get six with I'm so you get five for the major decision,</v>

3217
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:37.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3218
01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:39.250
<v Speaker 3>you get three for the decision.</v>

3219
01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:39.890
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3220
01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:40.780
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>

3221
01:23:40.781 --> 01:23:41.614
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3222
01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:43.030
<v Speaker 3>and then maybe tweak next year.</v>

3223
01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:47.380
<v Speaker 3>There may be some tweaks for people to remember all that shit.</v>

3224
01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:48.551
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

3225
01:23:48.551 --> 01:23:50.160
<v Speaker 3>So we're constantly talking about it on,</v>

3226
01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:51.053
<v Speaker 3>on here,</v>

3227
01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:51.903
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3228
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:52.270
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

3229
01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:55.210
<v Speaker 3>as the fights going on and people will listen to her drunk though,</v>

3230
01:23:55.211 --> 01:23:56.300
<v Speaker 3>like what the fuck,</v>

3231
01:23:57.250 --> 01:23:59.500
<v Speaker 3>what is the point that can't do the math?</v>

3232
01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:00.860
<v Speaker 3>And once there was no,</v>

3233
01:24:01.630 --> 01:24:03.050
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

3234
01:24:03.051 --> 01:24:03.280
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3235
01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:08.110
<v Speaker 3>it's super cool because it changes sometimes guys' attitudes when they're in</v>

3236
01:24:08.111 --> 01:24:08.340
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

3237
01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:11.650
<v Speaker 3>they changes what they do and how they respond in the fight.</v>

3238
01:24:11.651 --> 01:24:12.484
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3239
01:24:13.210 --> 01:24:16.300
<v Speaker 3>say the fight there was a fight with kyLe allen carr and mike kyle,</v>

3240
01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:16.870
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3241
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:19.780
<v Speaker 3>Both of these guys needed to finish to get into the playoffs.</v>

3242
01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:21.190
<v Speaker 3>Either one of those guys get to finish.</v>

3243
01:24:21.191 --> 01:24:22.120
<v Speaker 3>They get into the playoffs.</v>

3244
01:24:22.330 --> 01:24:25.470
<v Speaker 3>Josh copeland sitting at home hoping that nobody gets a finished.</v>

3245
01:24:25.471 --> 01:24:27.180
<v Speaker 3>The fight starts and boom,</v>

3246
01:24:27.181 --> 01:24:30.610
<v Speaker 3>my cow rocks weiland car and it's like it looks like he's going to get a first</v>

3247
01:24:30.611 --> 01:24:31.061
<v Speaker 3>round finish,</v>

3248
01:24:31.061 --> 01:24:32.050
<v Speaker 3>make it into the playoffs.</v>

3249
01:24:32.250 --> 01:24:33.580
<v Speaker 3>Kyle and guard starts coming back.</v>

3250
01:24:33.581 --> 01:24:36.850
<v Speaker 3>He gets on top and the second round he looks like he's going to get the finish</v>

3251
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:37.870
<v Speaker 3>and make it to the playoffs.</v>

3252
01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:39.070
<v Speaker 3>These guys go to the third.</v>

3253
01:24:39.071 --> 01:24:40.210
<v Speaker 3>Both guys a gas now.</v>

3254
01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:41.290
<v Speaker 3>Nobody finishes.</v>

3255
01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:45.730
<v Speaker 3>josh copeland jumps off his chair at home and he's in the playoffs now and now</v>

3256
01:24:45.731 --> 01:24:46.780
<v Speaker 3>he's in the finals.</v>

3257
01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:48.000
<v Speaker 3>Like he was the ac.</v>

3258
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:51.790
<v Speaker 3>He beat the number one seed and then he beat the number five seat by kale.</v>

3259
01:24:52.150 --> 01:24:52.900
<v Speaker 3>Now he's in the.</v>

3260
01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:55.470
<v Speaker 3>He's in the finals and he has a chance to make a million dollars number.</v>

3261
01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:56.500
<v Speaker 3>Ac is going in.</v>

3262
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:57.663
<v Speaker 3>InTeresting.</v>

3263
01:24:57.690 --> 01:24:58.060
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3264
01:24:58.060 --> 01:24:59.470
<v Speaker 3>That you just made a good argument for it.</v>

3265
01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure if I bought it though.</v>

3266
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:03.481
<v Speaker 3>You buy it,</v>

3267
01:25:03.481 --> 01:25:04.210
<v Speaker 3>joe,</v>

3268
01:25:04.210 --> 01:25:05.020
<v Speaker 3>you buy it.</v>

3269
01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:06.940
<v Speaker 3>Why don't they revamped the scoring system?</v>

3270
01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:12.820
<v Speaker 3>I would not be surprised if this off season we do some,</v>

3271
01:25:12.821 --> 01:25:13.654
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

3272
01:25:13.930 --> 01:25:16.010
<v Speaker 3>some brainstorming and,</v>

3273
01:25:16.011 --> 01:25:17.590
<v Speaker 3>and change a few things,</v>

3274
01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:21.070
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know if a whole lot is going to be changed.</v>

3275
01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:21.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3276
01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:24.100
<v Speaker 3>I think a few things will be changed in next.</v>

3277
01:25:24.101 --> 01:25:25.510
<v Speaker 3>Season's going to be even better.</v>

3278
01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:27.670
<v Speaker 3>And to a man,</v>

3279
01:25:27.671 --> 01:25:28.031
<v Speaker 3>I've heard,</v>

3280
01:25:28.031 --> 01:25:30.820
<v Speaker 3>I've heard virtually every high level guy,</v>

3281
01:25:30.821 --> 01:25:33.010
<v Speaker 3>every ufc level guy that I've spoken to,</v>

3282
01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:34.473
<v Speaker 3>they've said to me,</v>

3283
01:25:34.570 --> 01:25:38.650
<v Speaker 3>I think going to be able to pay that million dollars when they see that million</v>

3284
01:25:38.650 --> 01:25:39.483
<v Speaker 3>dollars is real.</v>

3285
01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.890
<v Speaker 3>Then I want to see the reaction to that.</v>

3286
01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.570
<v Speaker 3>That's gonna change everything.</v>

3287
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:45.680
<v Speaker 3>Once people get that million dollar check,</v>

3288
01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:48.080
<v Speaker 3>once you see someone you know,</v>

3289

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:26.840
<v Speaker 1>I sat next to fatal and that's a feather in my cap.</v>

3318
01:26:27.650 --> 01:26:27.971
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3319
01:26:27.971 --> 01:26:28.804
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3320
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:33.010
<v Speaker 1>I was gonna go to watch the faders,</v>

3321
01:26:33.130 --> 01:26:33.711
<v Speaker 1>faders,</v>

3322
01:26:33.711 --> 01:26:34.220
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

3323
01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3324
01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:36.290
<v Speaker 1>ryan bader in la.</v>

3325
01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:37.610
<v Speaker 1>They're fighting at the forum,</v>

3326
01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:39.090
<v Speaker 1>but there's a,</v>

3327
01:26:39.090 --> 01:26:41.450
<v Speaker 1>there's a ufc that night I can't go.</v>

3328
01:26:41.451 --> 01:26:43.340
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to go see fate or fight live.</v>

3329
01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3330
01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Never seen him fight live.</v>

3331
01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:47.630
<v Speaker 1>And I felt like that was a great fight in him versus bader.</v>

3332
01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:48.021
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3333
01:26:48.021 --> 01:26:49.310
<v Speaker 1>That's a great fight to see live.</v>

3334
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:50.541
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>

3335
01:26:50.541 --> 01:26:52.160
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen him fight live either.</v>

3336
01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:55.410
<v Speaker 1>I have a picture of me fader and tim crater like,</v>

3337
01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:00.560
<v Speaker 1>like just tim was fighting and fado is given me some advice on what to tell.</v>

3338
01:27:00.570 --> 01:27:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Tim,</v>

3339
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:01.783
<v Speaker 1>what was he saying?</v>

3340
01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:03.590
<v Speaker 1>He was just,</v>

3341
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:04.130
<v Speaker 1>he's just,</v>

3342
01:27:04.130 --> 01:27:07.070
<v Speaker 1>he's got to stay low and keep him away because he was fighting shale.</v>

3343
01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:07.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3344
01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:09.450
<v Speaker 1>But this was before jail is jail and he's like,</v>

3345
01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:09.770
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3346
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:10.130
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3347
01:27:10.130 --> 01:27:12.830
<v Speaker 1>he's wrestler like and somebody translating it to.</v>

3348
01:27:13.130 --> 01:27:13.963
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

3349
01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:14.751
<v Speaker 1>he's talking to me,</v>

3350
01:27:14.751 --> 01:27:15.171
<v Speaker 1>he's talking to,</v>

3351
01:27:15.171 --> 01:27:16.640
<v Speaker 1>he's talking to me and someone comes along and translate.</v>

3352
01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:16.941
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3353
01:27:16.941 --> 01:27:18.780
<v Speaker 1>he's got to stay low and keep them outside.</v>

3354
01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:19.663
<v Speaker 1>Keep him outside.</v>

3355
01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:21.470
<v Speaker 1>The guy translating sounds like this.</v>

3356
01:27:21.471 --> 01:27:22.060
<v Speaker 1>He said he's,</v>

3357
01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:22.581
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

3358
01:27:22.581 --> 01:27:25.460
<v Speaker 1>he said fado say keep him outside and stay low.</v>

3359
01:27:27.230 --> 01:27:27.651
<v Speaker 1>But just,</v>

3360
01:27:27.651 --> 01:27:31.040
<v Speaker 1>just having a conversation with that dude and sit next to him and he's not that</v>

3361
01:27:31.041 --> 01:27:33.530
<v Speaker 1>big of a guy is not that big of a guy.</v>

3362
01:27:33.530 --> 01:27:35.270
<v Speaker 1>So it was another guy who probably could be a middleweight.</v>

3363
01:27:35.330 --> 01:27:36.163
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3364
01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:37.520
<v Speaker 1>fado is awesome though.</v>

3365
01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:40.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you see some of the middle weights that are in the ufc,</v>

3366
01:27:40.791 --> 01:27:41.624
<v Speaker 1>like ul,</v>

3367
01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:46.290
<v Speaker 1>ul was in your chair sitting right there and it looked like somebody dropped a,</v>

3368
01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:50.170
<v Speaker 1>a giant iron sculpture of a superhero and put it.</v>

3369
01:27:50.171 --> 01:27:52.280
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even look like he doesn't look like a human.</v>

3370
01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:53.990
<v Speaker 1>He's so big dude.</v>

3371
01:27:54.290 --> 01:27:58.310
<v Speaker 1>He's like 2:20 plus just jacked everything neck,</v>

3372
01:27:58.311 --> 01:27:59.510
<v Speaker 1>shoulders back,</v>

3373
01:27:59.511 --> 01:28:00.470
<v Speaker 1>just jacked.</v>

3374
01:28:00.810 --> 01:28:01.190
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

3375
01:28:01.190 --> 01:28:02.540
<v Speaker 1>that is a heavyweight.</v>

3376
01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3377
01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:03.441
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3378
01:28:03.441 --> 01:28:07.220
<v Speaker 1>if you sit him next to fate or he looks relaxed bigger way bigger than fader,</v>

3379
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:09.170
<v Speaker 1>yet he fights a one 85,</v>

3380
01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.870
<v Speaker 1>but he's also so jacked and ripped and he's like my age.</v>

3381
01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:13.353
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

3382
01:28:13.670 --> 01:28:14.780
<v Speaker 1>But he's not like.</v>

3383
01:28:14.781 --> 01:28:15.440
<v Speaker 1>He like,</v>

3384
01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:18.500
<v Speaker 1>you can be my age and be ripped like I am if I take off my shirt,</v>

3385
01:28:18.501 --> 01:28:19.310
<v Speaker 1>but I want to bash you.</v>

3386
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.491
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3387
01:28:19.491 --> 01:28:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Don't please don't.</v>

3388
01:28:20.361 --> 01:28:20.780
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

3389
01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:23.240
<v Speaker 1>But like the way he is,</v>

3390
01:28:23.241 --> 01:28:25.010
<v Speaker 1>he's ripped like a 25 year old.</v>

3391
01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:26.210
<v Speaker 1>He's ripped like a bodybuilder.</v>

3392
01:28:26.490 --> 01:28:27.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3393
01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:28.670
<v Speaker 1>He's a freak of all freaks.</v>

3394
01:28:29.210 --> 01:28:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3395
01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Like he like you see his body in the ring and you go,</v>

3396
01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:32.961
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

3397
01:28:32.961 --> 01:28:33.890
<v Speaker 1>how did he make weight?</v>

3398
01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:35.210
<v Speaker 1>That's what I always think.</v>

3399
01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Like when even when he steps on the scale,</v>

3400
01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:39.040
<v Speaker 1>like back before we had the early wayans,</v>

3401
01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:41.690
<v Speaker 1>we had the weigh ins at the actual time of 4:00,</v>

3402
01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:43.190
<v Speaker 1>he would step on the scale and make weight,</v>

3403
01:28:43.191 --> 01:28:43.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3404
01:28:43.321 --> 01:28:45.440
<v Speaker 1>like how is that 185 pounds?</v>

3405
01:28:45.441 --> 01:28:46.520
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even make sense.</v>

3406
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:49.280
<v Speaker 1>He looks like he's 200 pounds easy plus that,</v>

3407
01:28:49.281 --> 01:28:50.650
<v Speaker 1>that same thing happened in,</v>

3408
01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:51.800
<v Speaker 1>in the match with um,</v>

3409
01:28:51.801 --> 01:28:54.560
<v Speaker 1>conor and floyd when connor was getting on the scale.</v>

3410
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:55.833
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3411
01:28:56.220 --> 01:28:58.730
<v Speaker 1>mayweather's maybe this promoter was like,</v>

3412
01:28:58.820 --> 01:28:59.780
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to make the weight.</v>

3413
01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:00.710
<v Speaker 1>He's not gonna make the weIght,</v>

3414
01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:02.450
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know this.</v>

3415
01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:03.450
<v Speaker 1>There's some guys who,</v>

3416
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3417
01:29:03.810 --> 01:29:05.670
<v Speaker 1>especially the mma guys are bigger than boxers,</v>

3418
01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:06.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3419
01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:09.450
<v Speaker 1>so it's one of those things like joelle has that down.</v>

3420
01:29:09.451 --> 01:29:09.631
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

3421
01:29:09.631 --> 01:29:09.901
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3422
01:29:09.901 --> 01:29:10.920
<v Speaker 1>he is huge,</v>

3423
01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:14.070
<v Speaker 1>but at dehydration hits and that's probably why he sucks.</v>

3424
01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Lockhart talked about it.</v>

3425
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of that guys like 42 years old.</v>

3426
01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:25.050
<v Speaker 1>He's so jacked and unparalleled wrestling skills to,</v>

3427
01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:26.281
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

3428
01:29:26.281 --> 01:29:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Yoel romero versus david branches booked.</v>

3429
01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:30.060

3430
01:29:30.061 --> 01:29:30.520
<v Speaker 1>That shit.</v>

3431
01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:31.010
<v Speaker 1>That might not be.</v>

3432
01:29:31.010 --> 01:29:31.480
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

3433
01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Could be older.</v>

3434
01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:33.330
<v Speaker 1>It might be new though.</v>

3435
01:29:33.390 --> 01:29:34.210
<v Speaker 1>I'll click on it.</v>

3436
01:29:34.210 --> 01:29:34.770

01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Ufc on fox.</v>

3440
01:29:38.130 --> 01:29:38.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>

3441
01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:38.870
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

3442
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:39.703
<v Speaker 1>Old.</v>

3443
01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:40.740
<v Speaker 1>So that never happened,</v>

3444
01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:42.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3445
01:29:42.690 --> 01:29:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't ever happen.</v>

3446
01:29:43.410 --> 01:29:44.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember it happening.</v>

3447
01:29:44.590 --> 01:29:45.423
<v Speaker 1>It didn't happen.</v>

3448
01:29:46.010 --> 01:29:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

3449
01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Typed in real elvers fader and there's a picture of the matching up 3,485 pound</v>

3450
01:29:52.051 --> 01:29:56.070
<v Speaker 1>division is kind of crazy because they're promising if style bender fights</v>

3451
01:29:56.071 --> 01:29:56.521
<v Speaker 1>anderson,</v>

3452
01:29:56.521 --> 01:29:57.600
<v Speaker 1>they're saying to anderson,</v>

3453
01:29:57.601 --> 01:29:58.291
<v Speaker 1>if you win,</v>

3454
01:29:58.291 --> 01:30:01.740
<v Speaker 1>you get a title shot and everybody else in divisions.</v>

3455
01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:02.573
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

3456
01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:04.133
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3457
01:30:04.530 --> 01:30:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Like you think that that's like some trickery to get anderson to fight style</v>

3458
01:30:08.371 --> 01:30:08.940
<v Speaker 1>bender?</v>

3459
01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:09.390
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3460
01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:10.830
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what I think it is.</v>

3461
01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:12.960
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what I think I um,</v>

3462
01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:15.840
<v Speaker 1>does it they offer style bender title shot if he beats anderson.</v>

3463
01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:17.453
<v Speaker 1>Dan hook is,</v>

3464
01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:18.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe so.</v>

3465
01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:20.910
<v Speaker 1>And that a dad hooker hooker posted that on it,</v>

3466
01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:21.391
<v Speaker 1>on his,</v>

3467
01:30:21.391 --> 01:30:22.260
<v Speaker 1>on his instagram.</v>

3468
01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:22.971
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

3469
01:30:22.971 --> 01:30:23.610
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

3470
01:30:23.610 --> 01:30:25.280
<v Speaker 1>I like hooker and I just had to say something.</v>

3471
01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:25.861
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

3472
01:30:25.861 --> 01:30:26.101
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3473
01:30:26.101 --> 01:30:27.810
<v Speaker 1>we know that style.</v>

3474
01:30:27.930 --> 01:30:31.170
<v Speaker 1>And my thought was we know when style benton wins his fight because I really</v>

3475
01:30:31.171 --> 01:30:33.120
<v Speaker 1>believe that I wasn't going to win that fight.</v>

3476
01:30:33.121 --> 01:30:34.020
<v Speaker 1>When he wins this fight,</v>

3477
01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:35.520
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to get that title shot.</v>

3478
01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:36.810
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

3479
01:30:36.930 --> 01:30:41.340
<v Speaker 1>for me as a form of fighter and knowing who addison is and what he's done for</v>

3480
01:30:41.341 --> 01:30:42.690
<v Speaker 1>the sport and for the ufc,</v>

3481
01:30:42.691 --> 01:30:43.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

3482
01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:44.153
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's,</v>

3483
01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:44.790
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3484
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:45.080
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3485
01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:47.850
<v Speaker 1>that's so disrespectful.</v>

3486
01:30:48.090 --> 01:30:48.910
<v Speaker 1>She asked me,</v>

3487
01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:49.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3488
01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:50.400
<v Speaker 1>that's mY opinion.</v>

3489
01:30:50.401 --> 01:30:51.121
<v Speaker 1>It's an opinion.</v>

3490
01:30:51.121 --> 01:30:51.760
<v Speaker 1>It's mine.</v>

3491
01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.280
<v Speaker 1>And I stand by that,</v>

3492
01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:54.114
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3493
01:30:54.170 --> 01:30:54.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3494
01:30:54.481 --> 01:30:57.530
<v Speaker 1>we want to make this young guy star and we're going to,</v>

3495
01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:00.090
<v Speaker 1>we're goIng to sacrifice you to the wolf to get that done.</v>

3496
01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:04.020
<v Speaker 1>But anderson still feels like he can compete at the highest level.</v>

3497
01:31:04.530 --> 01:31:08.520
<v Speaker 1>We all go to feel like we could beat it if you put enough money in front of me,</v>

3498
01:31:08.730 --> 01:31:09.563
<v Speaker 1>I will,</v>

3499
01:31:09.690 --> 01:31:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I will fuck khabib up.</v>

3500
01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:16.950
<v Speaker 1>You put something in front of me that I really want.</v>

3501
01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:18.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3502
01:31:18.330 --> 01:31:18.960
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing,</v>

3503
01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.010
<v Speaker 1>they give you a goal,</v>

3504
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:23.070
<v Speaker 1>give you a time period to train and prepare for it.</v>

3505
01:31:23.770 --> 01:31:24.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3506
01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:24.631
<v Speaker 1>Anderson's,</v>

3507
01:31:24.631 --> 01:31:24.811
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3508
01:31:24.811 --> 01:31:25.644
<v Speaker 1>43 now.</v>

3509
01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:27.033
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3510
01:31:27.490 --> 01:31:27.990
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3511
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:28.441
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

3512
01:31:28.441 --> 01:31:28.960
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing,</v>

3513
01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:33.090
<v Speaker 1>out of the realm of possibilities the same age as well or close to it.</v>

3514
01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:34.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3515
01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:36.600
<v Speaker 1>At least 40 years at least.</v>

3516
01:31:36.610 --> 01:31:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3517
01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.700
<v Speaker 1>he's 41.</v>

3518
01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:40.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3519
01:31:40.141 --> 01:31:40.974
<v Speaker 1>it's not</v>

3520
01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:43.290
<v Speaker 1>the problem within.</v>

3521
01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.153
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3522
01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:44.761
<v Speaker 1>anderson,</v>

3523
01:31:44.761 --> 01:31:47.540
<v Speaker 1>we started failing drug tests like okay,</v>

3524
01:31:47.550 --> 01:31:50.160
<v Speaker 1>so he's probably struggling trying to get that edge,</v>

3525
01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:51.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3526
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.540
<v Speaker 1>trying to,</v>

3527
01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:52.800
<v Speaker 1>trying to recover and training.</v>

3528
01:31:52.801 --> 01:31:54.600
<v Speaker 1>So he's taking a bunch of weird supplements.</v>

3529
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are tainted and I bet you if you go back to just</v>

3530
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:01.600
<v Speaker 3>go back to what you used to do,</v>

3531
01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:06.070
<v Speaker 3>go back to what it was you did when you became the anniston silver that</v>

3532
01:32:06.071 --> 01:32:06.940
<v Speaker 3>everybody loves,</v>

3533
01:32:07.210 --> 01:32:08.043
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3534
01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:08.920
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

3535
01:32:09.010 --> 01:32:12.400
<v Speaker 3>before he got to the point where like before the forrest griffin fight,</v>

3536
01:32:13.150 --> 01:32:15.520
<v Speaker 3>because I believe that's when it started to decline for him.</v>

3537
01:32:15.521 --> 01:32:15.701
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3538
01:32:15.701 --> 01:32:16.880
<v Speaker 3>He still looked good and he still,</v>

3539
01:32:16.890 --> 01:32:18.040
<v Speaker 3>it still performed well,</v>

3540
01:32:18.370 --> 01:32:19.630
<v Speaker 3>but he got away from,</v>

3541
01:32:19.690 --> 01:32:21.160
<v Speaker 3>from the fundamentals,</v>

3542
01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:22.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3543
01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:22.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3544
01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:23.470
<v Speaker 3>and that forrest griffin fight,</v>

3545
01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:27.340
<v Speaker 3>he was able to take for us out without the fundamentals moving his head doing,</v>

3546
01:32:27.341 --> 01:32:28.180
<v Speaker 3>doing these weird things,</v>

3547
01:32:28.330 --> 01:32:30.760
<v Speaker 3>just popping back fundamentals.</v>

3548
01:32:31.010 --> 01:32:32.470
<v Speaker 3>What's the strongest thing in the game</v>

3549
01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:33.321
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

3550
01:32:33.321 --> 01:32:34.070
<v Speaker 2>That fundamental.</v>

3551
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:35.320
<v Speaker 2>The forrest griffin fights it.</v>

3552
01:32:35.321 --> 01:32:36.560
<v Speaker 2>An interesting example too though,</v>

3553
01:32:36.561 --> 01:32:40.700
<v Speaker 2>because forest had been kao twice in training for that fight,</v>

3554
01:32:40.850 --> 01:32:42.950
<v Speaker 2>but he had no business being in there.</v>

3555
01:32:43.370 --> 01:32:43.791
<v Speaker 2>They really.</v>

3556
01:32:43.791 --> 01:32:45.350
<v Speaker 2>And he just couldn't take shot,</v>

3557
01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.770
<v Speaker 2>which is another thing I want to talk to you about.</v>

3558
01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:49.281
<v Speaker 2>Tito.</v>

3559
01:32:49.281 --> 01:32:50.114
<v Speaker 2>Chuck,</v>

3560
01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:53.510
<v Speaker 2>as a guy who's retired,</v>

3561
01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:57.920
<v Speaker 2>who had an awesome career and you're watching that and you've seen a guy come</v>

3562
01:32:57.921 --> 01:33:00.590
<v Speaker 2>back at 50 and get stopped like that.</v>

3563
01:33:00.650 --> 01:33:01.060
<v Speaker 2>What does.</v>

3564
01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:01.970
<v Speaker 2>What did that do for you?</v>

3565
01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:04.220
<v Speaker 3>You kind of knew That.</v>

3566
01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:05.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3567
01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:07.370
<v Speaker 3>I felt that chuck shouldn't be taking that fight right now.</v>

3568
01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:08.750
<v Speaker 3>Tito's been competing.</v>

3569
01:33:08.751 --> 01:33:11.810
<v Speaker 3>Tito's still in there and then when they stepped in,</v>

3570
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:13.070
<v Speaker 3>as soon as they touched up,</v>

3571
01:33:13.370 --> 01:33:13.821
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3572
01:33:13.821 --> 01:33:14.270
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3573
01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:15.140
<v Speaker 3>chuck shouldn't be in here.</v>

3574
01:33:15.141 --> 01:33:17.840
<v Speaker 3>He looked does the first time he looked that much smaller than tito.</v>

3575
01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:20.060
<v Speaker 3>He didn't look the same size of the tito.</v>

3576
01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:21.650
<v Speaker 3>He didn't look comfortable.</v>

3577
01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:23.210
<v Speaker 3>He didn't look as coordinated.</v>

3578
01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:26.360
<v Speaker 3>Like chuck was always little quirky and awkward in his movement,</v>

3579
01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:28.760
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't even look like chuck liddell.</v>

3580
01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:30.950
<v Speaker 3>He looked like a shell of chocolate dell.</v>

3581
01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:34.150
<v Speaker 2>And if you see him hitting the pads,</v>

3582
01:33:34.151 --> 01:33:35.980
<v Speaker 2>like recent video of him hitting the pads,</v>

3583
01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:37.570
<v Speaker 2>did it look terrible?</v>

3584
01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3585
01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:40.680
<v Speaker 2>He said he was just warming up like he had talked to brendan about it.</v>

3586
01:33:40.710 --> 01:33:40.961
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

3587
01:33:40.961 --> 01:33:42.390
<v Speaker 2>I always look bad when I'm warming up.</v>

3588
01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:43.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3589
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.320
<v Speaker 2>it's not just the look.</v>

3590
01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:47.690
<v Speaker 2>It looked like his balance was off work.</v>

3591
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.580
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3592
01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:49.220
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>

3593
01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:49.380
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3594
01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:52.250
<v Speaker 3>I would see if I would've saw that beforehand.</v>

3595
01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:56.390
<v Speaker 3>I still wouldn't put a whole lot of stock in that because like I remember being</v>

3596
01:33:56.391 --> 01:34:00.620
<v Speaker 3>a lock on 44 at hermes frank for the first time in the ufc and nick diaz was in</v>

3597
01:34:00.621 --> 01:34:05.130
<v Speaker 3>our locker room and niggas hitting pads and he's about to fight robby and he</v>

3598
01:34:05.131 --> 01:34:06.110
<v Speaker 3>didn't pads and he's like,</v>

3599
01:34:06.290 --> 01:34:06.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3600
01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:08.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna knock this motherfucker out.</v>

3601
01:34:08.450 --> 01:34:09.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3602
01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:11.280
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like not really hitting those pads.</v>

3603
01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:12.050
<v Speaker 3>Like he didn't,</v>

3604
01:34:12.050 --> 01:34:13.580
<v Speaker 3>he didn't look like he didn't look sharp,</v>

3605
01:34:13.581 --> 01:34:14.630
<v Speaker 3>he didn't look like getting poWer.</v>

3606
01:34:14.770 --> 01:34:15.411
<v Speaker 3>And then you went out there,</v>

3607
01:34:15.411 --> 01:34:16.250
<v Speaker 3>knocked ravi out.</v>

3608
01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:18.380
<v Speaker 2>It was just warming up though,</v>

3609
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:19.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3610
01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:21.080
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes when guys warming up,</v>

3611
01:34:21.290 --> 01:34:22.350
<v Speaker 2>they'll just do just,</v>

3612
01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:23.720
<v Speaker 2>they're just trying to get their bodies.</v>

3613
01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:24.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3614
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:27.560
<v Speaker 2>They're not really trying to look like a fight or trying to look like sharp.</v>

3615
01:34:27.561 --> 01:34:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Like they're going to be inside the inside of the cage and yeah,</v>

3616
01:34:31.011 --> 01:34:34.030
<v Speaker 2>he just wanted to see if he could find that chuck chocolate,</v>

3617
01:34:34.031 --> 01:34:35.000
<v Speaker 2>dell hidden pads.</v>

3618
01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:36.133
<v Speaker 2>It's different.</v>

3619
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:37.880
<v Speaker 2>It's different because it's like it.</v>

3620
01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:39.230
<v Speaker 2>His balance looks off,</v>

3621
01:34:39.231 --> 01:34:40.700
<v Speaker 2>his coordination looks off.</v>

3622
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:41.990
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't look.</v>

3623
01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:44.270
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't look good.</v>

3624
01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:45.620
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3625
01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:46.453
<v Speaker 2>It just.</v>

3626
01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:47.413
<v Speaker 2>There's a.</v>

3627
01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:48.613
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>

3628
01:34:48.650 --> 01:34:49.483
<v Speaker 2>Take a look at this.</v>

3629
01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:50.533
<v Speaker 2>Marsh says,</v>

3630
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:57.703
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3631
01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:01.353
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3632
01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Looks like it has no pop.</v>

3633
01:35:02.991 --> 01:35:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3634
01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3635
01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:05.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's crazy to watch.</v>

3636
01:35:05.721 --> 01:35:06.554
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3637
01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:09.670
<v Speaker 1>It just looks like lucy,</v>

3638
01:35:09.690 --> 01:35:12.740
<v Speaker 1>How he throws that kick in and leans back afterwards.</v>

3639
01:35:12.741 --> 01:35:17.741
<v Speaker 1>It just looks like there's a real issue with someone who's had that many chaos.</v>

3640
01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:19.850
<v Speaker 1>You've been caled that many times,</v>

3641
01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:22.670
<v Speaker 1>like your brain's been scrambled that many times.</v>

3642
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Like what is,</v>

3643
01:35:24.530 --> 01:35:25.363
<v Speaker 1>how is the,</v>

3644
01:35:25.370 --> 01:35:30.370
<v Speaker 1>the connection between your muscles in your mind which bumps nor neurologic.</v>

3645
01:35:30.481 --> 01:35:30.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3646
01:35:30.681 --> 01:35:31.880
<v Speaker 1>It makes you uncomfortable,</v>

3647
01:35:31.881 --> 01:35:32.031
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3648
01:35:32.031 --> 01:35:32.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3649
01:35:32.241 --> 01:35:32.780
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

3650
01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:33.613
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3651
01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:33.971
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3652
01:35:33.971 --> 01:35:34.804
<v Speaker 1>and that's chuck.</v>

3653
01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3654
01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:37.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of the greatest of all time.</v>

3655
01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:38.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3656
01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:41.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't and I 49 also 50.</v>

3657
01:35:41.781 --> 01:35:42.080
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3658
01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:43.730
<v Speaker 1>that's there's a point.</v>

3659
01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3660
01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:44.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3661
01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:47.510
<v Speaker 1>I almost feel like I would do it again for,</v>

3662
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.890
<v Speaker 1>for certain.</v>

3663
01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:50.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to be a world champion,</v>

3664
01:35:50.511 --> 01:35:52.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to get to qbb or dustin and those guys,</v>

3665
01:35:52.821 --> 01:35:53.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3666
01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:53.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3667
01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:57.200
<v Speaker 1>but like Joe lowe's on diego sanchez,</v>

3668
01:35:57.201 --> 01:35:59.030
<v Speaker 1>somebody that's like from the same era,</v>

3669
01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:00.980
<v Speaker 1>at least the part of the era that I was in,</v>

3670
01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:02.091
<v Speaker 1>somebody like that,</v>

3671
01:36:02.091 --> 01:36:02.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3672
01:36:02.391 --> 01:36:05.600
<v Speaker 1>somebody who have respect for and it like it's going to be fun and some,</v>

3673
01:36:05.740 --> 01:36:06.770
<v Speaker 1>but like I'm not.</v>

3674
01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:09.690
<v Speaker 1>And I guess that's what tito and chuck is also chuck,</v>

3675
01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:10.550
<v Speaker 1>he beat him twice.</v>

3676
01:36:10.670 --> 01:36:11.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3677
01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:11.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3678
01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:13.010
<v Speaker 1>let's be inventories by knockout.</v>

3679
01:36:13.011 --> 01:36:13.844
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

3680
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:16.610
<v Speaker 1>I think he just felt like you always had tito's number,</v>

3681
01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:19.070
<v Speaker 1>but this is the problem is like tito winds now,</v>

3682
01:36:19.490 --> 01:36:19.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3683
01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Like the guy who he never wanted to win now wins.</v>

3684
01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:24.710
<v Speaker 1>THe guy who wouldn't fight him when he was tHe champ.</v>

3685
01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:25.900
<v Speaker 1>now that was the winter,</v>

3686
01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:29.390
<v Speaker 1>like when it all said and done tito k odom.</v>

3687
01:36:29.810 --> 01:36:33.620
<v Speaker 1>And he kIlled him more soundly than chuck evekeo tito.</v>

3688
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Because when chuck hailed tito,</v>

3689
01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:38.210
<v Speaker 1>he basically beat him down and then tito covered up.</v>

3690
01:36:38.211 --> 01:36:39.140
<v Speaker 1>But he was conscious,</v>

3691
01:36:39.170 --> 01:36:39.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3692
01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Like right.</v>

3693
01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Chuck chuck out,</v>

3694
01:36:43.130 --> 01:36:45.130
<v Speaker 1>he put them out and you know,</v>

3695
01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:45.591
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3696
01:36:45.591 --> 01:36:47.120
<v Speaker 1>it was a good shot for sure,</v>

3697
01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:50.330
<v Speaker 1>but it just seems like you're dealing with a guy whose,</v>

3698
01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:51.290
<v Speaker 1>whose brains are,</v>

3699
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3700
01:36:51.911 --> 01:36:52.280
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

3701
01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:53.990
<v Speaker 1>he's been scrambled too many times.</v>

3702
01:36:54.770 --> 01:36:55.603
<v Speaker 1>YeaH.</v>

3703
01:36:56.530 --> 01:36:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3704
01:36:56.900 --> 01:36:57.351
<v Speaker 1>Prizes.</v>

3705
01:36:57.351 --> 01:36:58.184
<v Speaker 1>They made that fight.</v>

3706
01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:01.550
<v Speaker 1>I am surprised that the commission that the fight happened.</v>

3707
01:37:01.610 --> 01:37:02.151
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3708
01:37:02.151 --> 01:37:02.901
<v Speaker 1>If that's what you mean.</v>

3709
01:37:02.901 --> 01:37:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3710
01:37:03.290 --> 01:37:05.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surprised that that oscar de la hoya,</v>

3711
01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:08.270
<v Speaker 1>tito ortiz came together and said,</v>

3712
01:37:08.271 --> 01:37:09.440
<v Speaker 1>let's get chuck to fight me.</v>

3713
01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:10.281
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3714
01:37:10.281 --> 01:37:11.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surprised about that at all.</v>

3715
01:37:12.930 --> 01:37:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that they said there was only like 25,000 pay per view.</v>

3716
01:37:15.621 --> 01:37:16.460
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I heard.</v>

3717
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:17.621
<v Speaker 1>I kinda sucks.</v>

3718
01:37:17.621 --> 01:37:18.500
<v Speaker 1>So it's crazy.</v>

3719
01:37:18.501 --> 01:37:19.160
<v Speaker 1>horrible.</v>

3720
01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:20.120
<v Speaker 1>That's so low.</v>

3721
01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.860
<v Speaker 1>That must have cost everybody money.</v>

3722
01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:26.920
<v Speaker 1>LIke I have more instagram followers and it's a hard sell and the undercard</v>

3723
01:37:27.441 --> 01:37:28.460
<v Speaker 1>wasn't so good either.</v>

3724
01:37:28.461 --> 01:37:31.510
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like there was a lot of like big names on the undercard that's gonna</v>

3725
01:37:31.530 --> 01:37:33.020
<v Speaker 1>draw people in where they're going to go,</v>

3736
01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:43.800
<v Speaker 1>No you didn't.</v>

3737
01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:45.890
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know who their windows.</v>

3738
01:37:46.370 --> 01:37:47.390
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

3739
01:37:47.391 --> 01:37:48.224
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3740
01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:50.420
<v Speaker 1>the undercard was not great.</v>

3741
01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:51.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3742
01:37:51.230 --> 01:37:52.460
<v Speaker 1>and then the tito chuck fight,</v>

3743
01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:55.430
<v Speaker 1>chuck tito looks the,</v>

3744
01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:55.860
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3745
01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:56.030
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

3746
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:58.980
<v Speaker 2>much better strike a much more accomplished striker in that fight.</v>

3747
01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:01.260
<v Speaker 2>And tito ortiz knocked out,</v>

3748
01:38:01.261 --> 01:38:02.071
<v Speaker 2>knocked out cHocolate.</v>

3749
01:38:02.071 --> 01:38:02.581
<v Speaker 2>Dell is that,</v>

3750
01:38:02.581 --> 01:38:06.060
<v Speaker 2>that's like a phrase I never thought I would hear and it'd be real,</v>

3751
01:38:06.570 --> 01:38:11.070
<v Speaker 2>but isn't it also the case of not just see tito remaining active and staying</v>

3752
01:38:11.071 --> 01:38:12.630
<v Speaker 2>competitive and exactly what it is.</v>

3753
01:38:12.650 --> 01:38:13.500
<v Speaker 2>It's that too,</v>

3754
01:38:13.501 --> 01:38:15.210
<v Speaker 2>but it's also a tito skills got better.</v>

3755
01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:15.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3756
01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:16.493
<v Speaker 2>they definitely got better.</v>

3757
01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:18.270
<v Speaker 2>Jason pearls and awesome instructor.</v>

3758
01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:22.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a fantastic boxing coach and he really tightened up tito's hands and</v>

3759
01:38:22.970 --> 01:38:25.890
<v Speaker 2>all these techniques over over the course of the years they were together and</v>

3760
01:38:25.891 --> 01:38:27.450
<v Speaker 2>the last time tito and chuck fought,</v>

3761
01:38:27.810 --> 01:38:29.190
<v Speaker 2>I phones hadn't been invented.</v>

3762
01:38:30.370 --> 01:38:30.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3763
01:38:30.750 --> 01:38:31.583
<v Speaker 2>Think of that shit.</v>

3764
01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:32.810
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3765
01:38:32.810 --> 01:38:33.720
<v Speaker 2>No iphones.</v>

3766
01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:35.540
<v Speaker 2>People using sidekicks.</v>

3767
01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:36.383
<v Speaker 2>Remember those,</v>

3768
01:38:36.530 --> 01:38:36.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3769
01:38:36.890 --> 01:38:37.723
<v Speaker 2>where those things.</v>

3770
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:43.020
<v Speaker 2>I remember that flip up the keyboard and everybody thought they were slick.</v>

3771
01:38:43.770 --> 01:38:44.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3772
01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:47.370
<v Speaker 2>That was the last time they fought to different and myspace was a thing.</v>

3773
01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:48.750
<v Speaker 2>It was a different world man.</v>

3774
01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:50.153
<v Speaker 2>It's just um,</v>

3775
01:38:50.930 --> 01:38:53.400
<v Speaker 2>it's just sad to see it go down like that.</v>

3776
01:38:53.401 --> 01:38:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Where,</v>

3777
01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:57.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean it would be one thing if it was a good fight.</v>

3778
01:38:57.001 --> 01:38:58.750
<v Speaker 2>If tito looked like chuck chuck,</v>

3779
01:38:59.040 --> 01:38:59.490
<v Speaker 2>tito,</v>

3780
01:38:59.490 --> 01:38:59.731
<v Speaker 2>tito,</v>

3781
01:38:59.731 --> 01:39:00.564
<v Speaker 2>look good.</v>

3782
01:39:00.660 --> 01:39:01.680
<v Speaker 2>Chuck did not look good.</v>

3783
01:39:01.710 --> 01:39:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3784
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:04.140
<v Speaker 2>They both look good and they put on their best fight.</v>

3785
01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:06.720
<v Speaker 2>And then tito won up winning good for him.</v>

3786
01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:07.980
<v Speaker 2>But it wasn't that.</v>

3787
01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:09.480
<v Speaker 2>It was one guy was a,</v>

3788
01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:12.360
<v Speaker 2>just a shell shell of himself.</v>

3789
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:17.790
<v Speaker 2>So what kind of fight for tito or rematch fatina would make sense to,</v>

3790
01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:20.790
<v Speaker 2>to that you think would sell?</v>

3791
01:39:20.791 --> 01:39:21.151
<v Speaker 2>Is there.</v>

3792
01:39:21.151 --> 01:39:21.984
<v Speaker 2>Is there one?</v>

3793
01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:24.690
<v Speaker 2>Tito versus jail will sell a little bit.</v>

3794
01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:27.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's been calling chill out saying I want to kick your ass,</v>

3795
01:39:27.391 --> 01:39:30.720
<v Speaker 2>but I think that was probably before the pay per view numbers came in and then</v>

3796
01:39:30.721 --> 01:39:32.320
<v Speaker 2>they'll like oscar tails.</v>

3797
01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:32.941
<v Speaker 2>Tails like,</v>

3798
01:39:32.941 --> 01:39:33.600
<v Speaker 2>nah,</v>

3799
01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:36.870
<v Speaker 2>he's probably got 15 voicemails on oscar's phone.</v>

3800
01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:37.820
<v Speaker 2>Oscar and call him back.</v>

3801
01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:39.480
<v Speaker 2>I'll asked,</v>

3802
01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:40.380
<v Speaker 2>is just sitting there going,</v>

3803
01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:41.610
<v Speaker 2>fuck tito ortiz.</v>

3804
01:39:41.611 --> 01:39:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Willing to postpone retirement to kick someone's ass again.</v>

3805
01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3806
01:39:45.450 --> 01:39:46.080
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

3807
01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:49.530
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is he's going to try to do that with oscar and golden boy.</v>

3808
01:39:49.531 --> 01:39:51.650
<v Speaker 2>And that's going to sell $13,000.</v>

3809
01:39:51.651 --> 01:39:52.560
<v Speaker 2>Pay per view buys.</v>

3810
01:39:52.710 --> 01:39:53.940
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's going to buy that.</v>

3811
01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:54.451
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3812
01:39:54.451 --> 01:39:54.781
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3813
01:39:54.781 --> 01:39:55.120
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

3814
01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:56.580
<v Speaker 2>if child gets the marketing,</v>

3815
01:39:56.581 --> 01:39:57.414
<v Speaker 2>somebody will buy it.</v>

3816
01:39:57.870 --> 01:39:58.180
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

3817
01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:03.180
<v Speaker 2>if they could figure out a real competitive fight for tito against someone who's</v>

3818
01:40:04.291 --> 01:40:06.570
<v Speaker 2>got a big name and I don't know who that big name would be,</v>

3819
01:40:07.050 --> 01:40:08.910
<v Speaker 2>but he could still sell some.</v>

3820
01:40:09.810 --> 01:40:10.830
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the um,</v>

3821
01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:13.080
<v Speaker 2>did you see somebody posted these?</v>

3822
01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:17.970
<v Speaker 2>I think cannot tell the raja posted these two videos of tito where it was like</v>

3823
01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:21.060
<v Speaker 2>somebody was asking him how does he feel about this fight with chuck?</v>

3824
01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:21.750
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

3825
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:22.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm a much better fighting.</v>

3826
01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:23.610
<v Speaker 2>I was 12 years ago.</v>

3827
01:40:23.670 --> 01:40:24.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm much better fighter,</v>

3828
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:25.860
<v Speaker 2>be bigger,</v>

3829
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:26.833
<v Speaker 2>I'm stronger,</v>

3830
01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:27.773
<v Speaker 2>I'm younger,</v>

3831
01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:29.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm cities younger.</v>

3832
01:40:29.950 --> 01:40:33.980
<v Speaker 2>It gets a little flustered with said he wanted to outlive as kids too,</v>

3833
01:40:33.990 --> 01:40:34.411
<v Speaker 2>like to.</v>

3834
01:40:34.411 --> 01:40:37.410
<v Speaker 2>That's the worst thing you also said.</v>

3835
01:40:37.411 --> 01:40:37.871
<v Speaker 2>You also said,</v>

3836
01:40:37.871 --> 01:40:38.670
<v Speaker 2>he also said,</v>

3837
01:40:38.670 --> 01:40:39.211
<v Speaker 2>the guy's like,</v>

3838
01:40:39.211 --> 01:40:41.430
<v Speaker 2>so who's making the money off of the paper view?</v>

3839
01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:42.181
<v Speaker 2>Is it just you?</v>

3840
01:40:42.181 --> 01:40:45.360
<v Speaker 2>Is it all the fighters in the card or is it just you and chuck?</v>

3841
01:40:45.361 --> 01:40:45.900
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

3842
01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:46.260
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3843
01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:47.430
<v Speaker 2>it's me and myself and chuck,</v>

3844
01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:49.180
<v Speaker 2>we're going to make the money off of the peer view.</v>

3845
01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:49.771
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3846
01:40:49.771 --> 01:40:50.101
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>

3847
01:40:50.101 --> 01:40:52.170
<v Speaker 2>he just gets flooded and he just powered through these things.</v>

3848
01:40:52.230 --> 01:40:52.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3849
01:40:52.810 --> 01:40:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3850
01:40:53.410 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3851
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:57.420
<v Speaker 2>it's not a talkers business fighters business.</v>

3852
01:40:57.660 --> 01:40:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3853
01:40:58.150 --> 01:40:58.751
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

3854
01:40:58.751 --> 01:40:58.991
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3855
01:40:58.991 --> 01:40:59.530
<v Speaker 2>you're asked,</v>

3856
01:40:59.530 --> 01:41:03.520
<v Speaker 2>asked to be several things and when a guy like conor comes along or a guy like</v>

3857
01:41:03.521 --> 01:41:04.420
<v Speaker 2>colby covington.</v>

3858
01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:04.661
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3859
01:41:04.661 --> 01:41:05.950
<v Speaker 2>that was the other thing I want to talk about.</v>

3860
01:41:06.250 --> 01:41:09.280
<v Speaker 2>They're talking about colby not fighting tyron for the title now.</v>

3861
01:41:09.610 --> 01:41:12.370
<v Speaker 2>And then eastman leap frogging over colby,</v>

3862
01:41:12.371 --> 01:41:13.630
<v Speaker 2>who's the interim champ?</v>

3863
01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Didn't they strip colby?</v>

3864
01:41:15.850 --> 01:41:16.780
<v Speaker 2>Did they strip him?</v>

3865
01:41:17.170 --> 01:41:19.620
<v Speaker 2>I believe he called the stripped maybe.</v>

3866
01:41:20.130 --> 01:41:20.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3867
01:41:20.830 --> 01:41:21.551
<v Speaker 2>maybe they did strip.</v>

3868
01:41:21.551 --> 01:41:21.671
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3869
01:41:21.671 --> 01:41:22.690
<v Speaker 2>which is also weird.</v>

3870
01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Which is weird because like,</v>

3871
01:41:24.610 --> 01:41:27.380
<v Speaker 2>that should've been tyrants first fight back from that shoulder surgery,</v>

3872
01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:28.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3873
01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:29.140
<v Speaker 2>that's what the interim is for,</v>

3874
01:41:29.141 --> 01:41:29.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3875
01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:30.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3876
01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:30.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3877
01:41:30.270 --> 01:41:30.640
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3878
01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:31.450
<v Speaker 2>if it's not,</v>

3879
01:41:31.450 --> 01:41:32.650
<v Speaker 2>then what's an interim for.</v>

3880
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:34.930
<v Speaker 2>Unless if they stripped him,</v>

3881
01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:38.300
<v Speaker 2>the only reason why I could see saying uzma,</v>

3882
01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:41.830
<v Speaker 2>but also that's another thing where I think it's probably negotiation tactics.</v>

3883
01:41:41.831 --> 01:41:44.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like the nate diaz dust employee a thing.</v>

3884
01:41:44.650 --> 01:41:47.830
<v Speaker 2>I remember looking this up and someone was trying to correct me last time I did,</v>

3885
01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:49.240
<v Speaker 2>it was supposed to be,</v>

3886
01:41:49.241 --> 01:41:52.120
<v Speaker 2>which I don't know if it actually happened when that fight happened with tyron</v>

3887
01:41:52.121 --> 01:41:53.770
<v Speaker 2>until when that fight happened,</v>

3888
01:41:53.771 --> 01:41:54.850
<v Speaker 2>he was supposed to be stripped,</v>

3889
01:41:55.090 --> 01:41:56.710
<v Speaker 2>but he's on the website.</v>

3890
01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:58.660
<v Speaker 2>He still listed as the interim champ.</v>

3891
01:41:59.020 --> 01:41:59.351
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3892
01:41:59.351 --> 01:42:02.500
<v Speaker 2>it's a good move to keep them in the interim champ if they decide to fight</v>

3893
01:42:02.670 --> 01:42:04.240
<v Speaker 2>because then the champ versus champ,</v>

3894
01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:05.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3895
01:42:05.051 --> 01:42:06.580
<v Speaker 2>if they do decide to make that fight,</v>

3896
01:42:06.730 --> 01:42:08.170
<v Speaker 2>I feel like on paper,</v>

3897
01:42:08.230 --> 01:42:10.180
<v Speaker 2>at least financially,</v>

3898
01:42:10.210 --> 01:42:11.950
<v Speaker 2>it's a good fight because uh,</v>

3899
01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:14.740
<v Speaker 2>like colby talks so much shit.</v>

3900
01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:16.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's worth,</v>

3901
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:21.520
<v Speaker 2>it's worth putting together just for that because people don't know huisman is</v>

3902
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:22.423
<v Speaker 2>as much,</v>

3903
01:42:22.750 --> 01:42:24.460
<v Speaker 2>but it was a nightmare for anybody.</v>

3904
01:42:24.970 --> 01:42:26.830
<v Speaker 2>He is the biggest,</v>

3905
01:42:27.010 --> 01:42:27.461
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

3906
01:42:27.461 --> 01:42:29.530
<v Speaker 2>biggest threat to tyron right now.</v>

3907
01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:30.760
<v Speaker 2>Solid wrestling,</v>

3908
01:42:31.390 --> 01:42:33.250
<v Speaker 2>striking conditioning.</v>

3909
01:42:33.310 --> 01:42:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Everything super strong.</v>

3910
01:42:35.110 --> 01:42:35.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3911
01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:40.000
<v Speaker 2>and just has been on a tear and has gotten better with every fight has been</v>

3912
01:42:40.001 --> 01:42:40.834
<v Speaker 2>proven.</v>

3913
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:43.870
<v Speaker 2>Has gone through the trial by fire inside the octagon.</v>

3914
01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:45.130
<v Speaker 2>Exactly like colby has.</v>

3915
01:42:45.131 --> 01:42:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Colby has the wrestling,</v>

3916
01:42:46.630 --> 01:42:48.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm submission awareness.</v>

3917
01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:51.370
<v Speaker 2>At least his offensive submissions aren't the best,</v>

3918
01:42:51.371 --> 01:42:55.630
<v Speaker 2>but he can finish you and his striking is competent,</v>

3919
01:42:55.631 --> 01:42:56.890
<v Speaker 2>but he has no power.</v>

3920
01:42:57.670 --> 01:43:00.770
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to hurt tyra in term title holder.</v>

3921
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:01.863
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3922
01:43:02.030 --> 01:43:02.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3923
01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:04.510
<v Speaker 2>So they didn't strip them to decide to keep them,</v>

3924
01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:05.351
<v Speaker 2>but who knows,</v>

3925
01:43:05.351 --> 01:43:07.410
<v Speaker 2>they might have just not Kevin Mcdonald,</v>

3926
01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:08.381
<v Speaker 2>the website.</v>

3927
01:43:08.381 --> 01:43:09.400
<v Speaker 2>He was one of my students.</v>

3928
01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:09.881
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

3929
01:43:09.881 --> 01:43:10.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3930
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:11.223
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

3931
01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:12.280
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

3932
01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:13.113
<v Speaker 2>It's great ref.</v>

3933
01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:13.331
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3934
01:43:13.331 --> 01:43:14.164
<v Speaker 2>he's a good rough.</v>

3935
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3936
01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:15.341
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

3937
01:43:15.341 --> 01:43:16.780
<v Speaker 2>the colby thing is interesting.</v>

3938
01:43:16.810 --> 01:43:17.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3939
01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:18.610
<v Speaker 2>it's like his fight again,</v>

3940
01:43:18.611 --> 01:43:19.560
<v Speaker 2>hafael dot sohn.</v>

3941
01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:21.370
<v Speaker 2>Joe's like anybody who thought he wasn't for real,</v>

3942
01:43:21.371 --> 01:43:22.060
<v Speaker 2>like you see that fit,</v>

3943
01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:22.900
<v Speaker 2>you beat the shit out.</v>

3944
01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:25.840
<v Speaker 2>Dos anjos his conditioning is incredible.</v>

3945
01:43:26.050 --> 01:43:26.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is,</v>

3946
01:43:26.980 --> 01:43:28.810
<v Speaker 2>that is one of the big things about that dude.</v>

3947
01:43:28.811 --> 01:43:29.621
<v Speaker 2>This is conditioning.</v>

3948
01:43:29.621 --> 01:43:30.490
<v Speaker 2>It's off the charts.</v>

3949
01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:31.190
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't get tired.</v>

3950
01:43:31.190 --> 01:43:32.410
<v Speaker 2>It does not get tired.</v>

3951
01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:33.580
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking animal.</v>

3952
01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3953
01:43:34.030 --> 01:43:36.370
<v Speaker 2>So that's the thing that makes that fight interesting.</v>

3954
01:43:36.371 --> 01:43:37.120
<v Speaker 2>With tire.</v>

3955
01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Can he push tyron?</v>

3956
01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:39.850
<v Speaker 2>But kenny survive.</v>

3957
01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:40.713
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

3958
01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:42.100
<v Speaker 2>That's the big thing.</v>

3959
01:43:42.210 --> 01:43:46.170
<v Speaker 2>See dos anjos is more of a volume striker at one 70.</v>

3960
01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:48.050
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to knock those bigger guys out.</v>

3961
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:49.780
<v Speaker 2>But tyron and knock on anybody.</v>

3962
01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:51.320
<v Speaker 2>So this is a.</v>

3963
01:43:51.710 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 2>I want</v>

3964
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:52.670
<v Speaker 3>to see that fight.</v>

3965
01:43:52.670 --> 01:43:54.080
<v Speaker 3>And the thing with colby,</v>

3966
01:43:54.290 --> 01:43:56.030
<v Speaker 3>like the last time I trained with him,</v>

3967
01:43:56.031 --> 01:43:56.990
<v Speaker 3>it's been about a year,</v>

3968
01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:59.450
<v Speaker 3>but at that point he was hard to miss.</v>

3969
01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:00.893
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3970
01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:02.180
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

3971
01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:05.420
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm a striker but I'm tiring.</v>

3972
01:44:05.810 --> 01:44:06.980
<v Speaker 3>Like tyrons got good.</v>

3973
01:44:06.981 --> 01:44:07.900
<v Speaker 3>Chris boxing put,</v>

3974
01:44:07.901 --> 01:44:09.300
<v Speaker 3>he hit so hard,</v>

3975
01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:11.040
<v Speaker 3>so strong.</v>

3976
01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:12.250
<v Speaker 3>He's so</v>

3977
01:44:12.250 --> 01:44:12.760
<v Speaker 2>fast,</v>

3978
01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:13.810
<v Speaker 2>like a straight right hand.</v>

3979
01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:15.250
<v Speaker 2>I remember when he fought,</v>

3980
01:44:15.251 --> 01:44:16.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm carlos condit,</v>

3981
01:44:17.170 --> 01:44:19.060
<v Speaker 2>he hit them with a lead right hand and I was just like</v>

3982
01:44:19.110 --> 01:44:19.440
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

3983
01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:22.110
<v Speaker 3>Somebody like removed some friends from that.</v>

3984
01:44:22.111 --> 01:44:22.801
<v Speaker 3>From reality.</v>

3985
01:44:22.801 --> 01:44:25.590
<v Speaker 3>He crossed over so fast like this distance,</v>

3986
01:44:25.591 --> 01:44:27.240
<v Speaker 3>like he closed the distance so quick.</v>

3987
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:28.170
<v Speaker 3>He's explosive.</v>

3988
01:44:28.270 --> 01:44:29.670
<v Speaker 3>He's so fast.</v>

3989
01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:31.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3990
01:44:31.410 --> 01:44:35.100
<v Speaker 3>I tyron is a real champion,</v>

3991
01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:35.940
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

3992
01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:40.940
<v Speaker 3>He's a real champion and not getting the credit that he deserves for a long time</v>

3993
01:44:42.050 --> 01:44:43.020
<v Speaker 3>and that bothers him,</v>

3994
01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:43.850
<v Speaker 3>but he's in a</v>

3995
01:44:43.850 --> 01:44:46.090
<v Speaker 2>handful of the greatest wall towards of all time now,</v>

3996
01:44:46.091 --> 01:44:46.751
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion.</v>

3997
01:44:46.751 --> 01:44:50.140
<v Speaker 2>You got matt hughes who's a legend and of course george st pierre,</v>

3998
01:44:50.470 --> 01:44:53.770
<v Speaker 2>robbie lawler and then tyrone who knocked out robbie lawler.</v>

3999
01:44:53.771 --> 01:44:54.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean in my opinion,</v>

4000
01:44:54.731 --> 01:44:58.150
<v Speaker 2>he's right up there and then as these winds pile up,</v>

4001
01:44:58.550 --> 01:45:01.630
<v Speaker 2>you make more of a case of him being the best welterweight ever.</v>

4002
01:45:02.150 --> 01:45:02.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4003
01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:03.293
<v Speaker 3>tiring.</v>

4004
01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:05.300
<v Speaker 3>With that being said,</v>

4005
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.720
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>

4006
01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:08.000
<v Speaker 3>He's beaten a lot of the guys in the division,</v>

4007
01:45:08.001 --> 01:45:09.170
<v Speaker 3>but he needs,</v>

4008
01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:10.100
<v Speaker 3>like you said earlier,</v>

4009
01:45:10.101 --> 01:45:11.750
<v Speaker 3>he needs a fight like a gsp.</v>

4010
01:45:12.050 --> 01:45:16.250
<v Speaker 3>He needs some something where somebody else's established because with him</v>

4011
01:45:16.251 --> 01:45:18.830
<v Speaker 3>coming in and taken out robbie and and all these other young guys,</v>

4012
01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:21.260
<v Speaker 3>they proven amongst themselves and amongst each other,</v>

4013
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:22.310
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of the,</v>

4014
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.911
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

4015
01:45:22.911 --> 01:45:23.391
<v Speaker 3>nobody knows.</v>

4016
01:45:23.391 --> 01:45:25.590
<v Speaker 3>Come on with simon and huseman.</v>

4017
01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:26.031
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>

4018
01:45:26.031 --> 01:45:29.240
<v Speaker 3>He's a threat to everybody.</v>

4019
01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:29.930
<v Speaker 3>Everybody,</v>

4020
01:45:29.930 --> 01:45:30.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4021
01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:32.080
<v Speaker 3>he's been wanting and he's been wonderful,</v>

4022
01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:33.770
<v Speaker 3>but he's been wanting down until he wants.</v>

4023
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:37.540
<v Speaker 3>He wants everybody because he wants a shot at the belt and um,</v>

4024
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.440
<v Speaker 3>I believe for real,</v>

4025
01:45:39.441 --> 01:45:40.274
<v Speaker 3>he's the biggest,</v>

4026
01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:41.420
<v Speaker 3>biggest threat to tiring,</v>

4027
01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:46.790
<v Speaker 3>but I'm tyron could win that fight also can win it convincingly and then it</v>

4028
01:45:46.791 --> 01:45:47.660
<v Speaker 3>means nothing to the,</v>

4029
01:45:47.661 --> 01:45:51.680
<v Speaker 3>to the world who tyron wants to respect what he's done as the champion.</v>

4030
01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:52.341
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4031
01:45:52.341 --> 01:45:52.910
<v Speaker 2>In that case,</v>

4032
01:45:52.910 --> 01:45:56.030
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the reasons why the fight with colby makes the most sense.</v>

4033
01:45:56.031 --> 01:45:58.190
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be the most controversial,</v>

4034
01:45:58.191 --> 01:45:59.520
<v Speaker 2>highest profile because colby,</v>

4035
01:45:59.521 --> 01:46:00.740
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk mad shit.</v>

4036
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:05.780
<v Speaker 2>Time will get really angry and if he beats him and smashes him then it steps up</v>

4037
01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:07.070
<v Speaker 2>him and puts him in a.</v>

4038
01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:08.750
<v Speaker 2>And then in the meantime,</v>

4039
01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:11.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean tills not going to fight at one 70 anymore.</v>

4040
01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Tills moved up to one 85.</v>

4041
01:46:13.041 --> 01:46:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4042
01:46:13.490 --> 01:46:14.290
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

4043
01:46:14.290 --> 01:46:18.350
<v Speaker 2>but you still have a plethora of killers in the welterweight division.</v>

4044
01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:20.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can make a lot of match ups,</v>

4045
01:46:20.230 --> 01:46:21.070
<v Speaker 3>but the colby fight,</v>

4046
01:46:21.071 --> 01:46:23.500
<v Speaker 3>the colby fight also could help tire and get over to.</v>

4047
01:46:23.501 --> 01:46:27.640
<v Speaker 3>Because colby is going to talk a lot of shit and some of it's disrespectful and</v>

4048
01:46:27.641 --> 01:46:27.971
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

4049
01:46:27.971 --> 01:46:28.570
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

4050
01:46:28.570 --> 01:46:30.700
<v Speaker 3>people like to see those guys get stopped.</v>

4051
01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:31.490
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

4052
01:46:31.490 --> 01:46:32.323
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

4053
01:46:32.590 --> 01:46:33.590
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

4054
01:46:33.690 --> 01:46:34.290
<v Speaker 3>that's that.</v>

4055
01:46:34.290 --> 01:46:38.500
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's what that's like to see those guys get stopped.</v>

4056
01:46:38.890 --> 01:46:41.730
<v Speaker 3>Not just get beat the tire and win that fight.</v>

4057
01:46:41.731 --> 01:46:41.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4058
01:46:41.890 --> 01:46:46.600
<v Speaker 3>for the most part he has to stop colby because colby is not going to quit.</v>

4059
01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:49.500
<v Speaker 3>And in the fourth round he's gonna.</v>

4060
01:46:49.501 --> 01:46:50.700
<v Speaker 3>He's gonna step on the gas.</v>

4061
01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:52.680
<v Speaker 3>Tyron can't keep up.</v>

4062
01:46:53.010 --> 01:46:54.000
<v Speaker 3>Then it's going to be a problem.</v>

4063
01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:57.550
<v Speaker 3>I got david goggins here to nice max amount.</v>

4064
01:46:58.260 --> 01:46:59.610
<v Speaker 3>Anything else before we get out of here?</v>

4065
01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:01.530
<v Speaker 3>The only other thing was the ketone meals.</v>

4066
01:47:01.650 --> 01:47:02.790
<v Speaker 3>Like those things are awesome.</v>

4067
01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:03.661

4068
01:47:03.661 --> 01:47:05.860
<v Speaker 3>an elk meal and they want it.</v>

4069
01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:06.930
<v Speaker 3>They want to talk to you about,</v>

4070
01:47:06.931 --> 01:47:07.291

4071
