00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Hey Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

8
00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:14.350
<v Speaker 1>thank you so much for this coin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This coin from Constantine.</v>

9
00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:15.430
<v Speaker 1>You brought me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.560
<v Speaker 1>how many years old?</v>
<v Speaker 1>1700.</v>

11
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.970
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

12
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.953
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say I like giving something </v>

13
00:00:20.951 --> 00:00:23.680
<v Speaker 1>that is the oldest manmade objects in </v>
<v Speaker 1>most people's homes.</v>

14
00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:24.514
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll have some aboriginal instrument </v>

15
00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:27.370
<v Speaker 1>or something that's like from the Stone </v>
<v Speaker 1>Age,</v>

16
00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:30.220
<v Speaker 1>but most people that'll be the oldest </v>
<v Speaker 1>manmade thing in their home.</v>

17
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.170
<v Speaker 1>My friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>

18
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Mark Gordon actually gave me a Roman </v>
<v Speaker 1>coin as well,</v>

19
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.430
<v Speaker 1>but I dunno who's coin is all yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looks older.</v>

20
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's depressing though.</v>

21
00:00:38.111 --> 00:00:38.944
<v Speaker 1>Cause normally I'm the coin guy so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate that I've been beaten to the punch </v>

22
00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:43.300
<v Speaker 1>by anybody on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he's,</v>

23
00:00:43.301 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of a historical efficient auto</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a history aficionados.</v>

24
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Well not the extent that you are though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so this is from Constantine?</v>

25
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife would spend that by accident.</v>

26
00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:54.730
<v Speaker 1>Just so you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

27
00:00:54.731 --> 00:00:56.800
<v Speaker 1>I got a coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a pair of shoes.</v>

28
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:57.700
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were no,</v>

29
00:00:57.701 --> 00:00:58.990
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't buy shoes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

30
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.500
<v Speaker 1>W W how much was that worth back then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what that's like?</v>

31
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.760
<v Speaker 1>There probably is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

32
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Did they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of units do they have?</v>

33
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.653
<v Speaker 1>Like A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably had like some dead metal </v>

34
00:01:08.741 --> 00:01:09.574
<v Speaker 1>type thing and then some kind of bronze </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you get into the silver and </v>

35
00:01:11.621 --> 00:01:14.140
<v Speaker 1>gold and how much is mixed into the rest</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

36
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.423
<v Speaker 1>and they have those like you can go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually really cool because they </v>

37
00:01:17.111 --> 00:01:18.550
<v Speaker 1>were better like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they'll,</v>

38
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.460
<v Speaker 1>they'll clean the silver often it looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like yesterday.</v>

39
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.073
<v Speaker 1>So you always know what's the cheap </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff when they're all dirty and </v>

40
00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:25.960
<v Speaker 1>everything like that.</v>

41
00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:27.580
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because then that's like a penny.</v>

42
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our pennies get the same way.</v>

43
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think this is made out of?</v>

44
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they had alloys back then.</v>

46
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.971
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They use it.</v>

52
00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:42.160
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope I'm right about this,</v>

<v Speaker 1>about it about electron.</v>

55
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

56
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:50.920
<v Speaker 1>the beautiful thing about your podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>is you can research things in advance so</v>

57
00:01:50.921 --> 00:01:52.210
<v Speaker 1>you know what the fuck you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

58
00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:54.280
<v Speaker 1>By the time you speak when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>radically.</v>

59
00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegedly.</v>

60
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>I supposedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of,</v>

61
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.550
<v Speaker 1>a lot of wiggle room words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>defensive journalism.</v>

62
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

63
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to tell you again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will.</v>

64
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your podcast is for me,</v>

65
00:02:06.401 --> 00:02:10.990
<v Speaker 1>has been the most educational historical</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in my entire life.</v>

66
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.183
<v Speaker 1>I've never had anything in my life that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's taught me more about history than </v>

67
00:02:15.191 --> 00:02:16.024
<v Speaker 1>hardcore history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how to react when </v>

68
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.650
<v Speaker 1>people say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the kindest things that you hear.</v>

69
00:02:20.651 --> 00:02:23.260
<v Speaker 1>And I always say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always hope everybody gets a chance in</v>

70
00:02:23.261 --> 00:02:24.094
<v Speaker 1>their lives to have people that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>admire turning around and telling them </v>

71
00:02:26.891 --> 00:02:28.900
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it is the need is feeling.</v>

72
00:02:28.901 --> 00:02:31.120
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you realize all the crap you put up</v>

73
00:02:31.121 --> 00:02:33.760
<v Speaker 1>with for decades and other jobs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>other businesses to say,</v>

74
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.470
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 51 or whatever,</v>

75
00:02:35.471 --> 00:02:37.420
<v Speaker 1>and they really like what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

76
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.580
<v Speaker 1>everybody should feel this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I appreciate that though.</v>

<v Speaker 1>think about all the other stuff you did,</v>

80
00:02:45.941 --> 00:02:49.960
<v Speaker 1>all the broadcast work you did before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really prepared you for this,</v>

81
00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:50.794
<v Speaker 1>this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because obviously this medium is so </v>

82
00:02:53.651 --> 00:02:56.950
<v Speaker 1>incredibly new and this ability for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to just put something out.</v>

83
00:02:56.951 --> 00:02:58.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see when you put out new podcasts,</v>

84
00:02:58.691 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>they're at the top of the heap of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcasts in the world.</v>

85
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about that,</v>

86
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>that all you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just you and you have a,</v>

87
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 1>an a guy who helps you with editing </v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretically.</v>

88
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's fucking it.</v>

89
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is amazing.</v>

90
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.533
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is that any different from this </v>

91
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>empire?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've this,</v>

92
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm just talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I'm doing too.</v>

93
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 1>But you walk into this place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

94
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:19.534
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the Joe Rogan's talking has </v>

95
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:21.830
<v Speaker 1>built,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

96
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something along those lines.</v>

97
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Talking to people like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're right.</v>

98
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean I keep trying to remind myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

99
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>you and I both been doing this a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

100
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 1>got into it pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty early on and so for us it doesn't</v>

101
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 1>feel new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you keep trying to think about,</v>

102
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:34.624
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's this going to be like in 30 </v>

103
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:37.060
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years?</v>

104
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:39.410
<v Speaker 1>I keep telling everybody that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're seeing now in Mike,</v>

105
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.181
<v Speaker 1>my children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

106
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:41.880
<v Speaker 1>no other world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in their minds,</v>

107
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 1>I tell my oldest all the time at at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time you were born,</v>

108
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 1>we weren't even texting yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is all since you've come around.</v>

109
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>So I keep thinking we're at still at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tip of the tip of the tip of the iceberg</v>

110
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.033
<v Speaker 1>in this era that we're in now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's podcasting going to be like when </v>

111
00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>whole generations grow up and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>a part of their world and podcasts are a</v>

112
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 1>part of it and it won't even be </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasting.</v>

113
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.223
<v Speaker 1>I mean there'll be broadcasting into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>matrix cord in the back of your neck or </v>

114
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:05.584
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

115
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're still at the,</v>

116
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:07.864
<v Speaker 1>it seems hard for longterm podcasters to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that this is still the </v>

117
00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:13.870
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible for us to predict</v>

118
00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:17.500
<v Speaker 1>because when you really think about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing now in terms of like,</v>

119
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 1>like you could put a youtube video right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

120
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 1>you could make a video and you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could go viral for whatever reason,</v>

121
00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:27.130
<v Speaker 1>and a million people all over the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be watching your video.</v>

122
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Like almost instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was not,</v>

123
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only unheard of 10 years ago.</v>

124
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Just go back 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>

125
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 1>40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insanity.</v>

126
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.020
<v Speaker 1>You're talking insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people would be like,</v>

127
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a phone in your pocket?</v>

128
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.690
<v Speaker 1>That would be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a phone in your pocket that has</v>

129
00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:44.524
<v Speaker 1>a camera.</v>

130
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.780
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wait,</v>

131
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.633
<v Speaker 1>don't you have a phone in your pocket?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a video camera that takes high </v>

132
00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 1>definition video with stereo sound and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can we meet,</v>

133
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:57.640
<v Speaker 1>you're uploading it through the sky just</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the air.</v>

134
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.180
<v Speaker 1>What in real time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instantaneously.</v>

135
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.340
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now think,</v>

136
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.533
<v Speaker 1>what could we be looking at in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>augmented reality in terms of virtual </v>

137
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Speaker 1>reality and working on something along </v>
<v Speaker 1>those lines.</v>

138
00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Right now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

139
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.910
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

140
00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what you doing.</v>

141
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.460
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me off.</v>

142
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:15.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

143
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.720
<v Speaker 1>but the point of the podcast up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is,</v>

144
00:05:17.721 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 1>is that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

145
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 1>you're absolutely right about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

146
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

147
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent,</v>

148
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 1>before I got into podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in,</v>

149
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the era where,</v>

150
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:25.084
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Mark Cuban made it big and </v>

151
00:05:25.751 --> 00:05:28.660
<v Speaker 1>everybody was just going to start a high</v>
<v Speaker 1>tech company and sell it for billions of</v>

152
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.690
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>

153
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 1>What did Cuban make it big with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>broadcast.com</v>

154
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:31.520
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

155
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.310
<v Speaker 1>which we call it was basically like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>website with a bunch of links and,</v>

156
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.250
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was like,</v>

157
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Dang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he can do so.</v>

158
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 1>So I was in one of these companies with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of buddies and we were,</v>

159
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.880
<v Speaker 1>we were pushing what we called amateur </v>
<v Speaker 1>content back then.</v>

160
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 1>So we're talking 95,</v>
<v Speaker 1>96.</v>

161
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.903
<v Speaker 1>And one of my jobs was to go with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>staff to all these venture capitalists </v>

162
00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:52.540
<v Speaker 1>and try to sell them on the idea of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>amateur content was going to become.</v>

163
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.853
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went from like place to place to </v>

164
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:57.010
<v Speaker 1>place with all these people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly the,</v>

165
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 1>who can see the future and every one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

166
00:05:59.001 --> 00:05:59.834
<v Speaker 1>And I mean every single one said </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's going to view amateur content </v>

167
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>because if anybody could make anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody would wanted to see,</v>

168
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 1>they'd be paid for it.</v>

169
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 1>And I kept talking about the quantity </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a quality all its own idea,</v>

170
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:11.751
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where you say,</v>

171
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:12.584
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if only 1% of this stuff is worth </v>

172
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:15.074
<v Speaker 1>watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still going to have millions of </v>

173
00:06:16.491 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 1>pieces of content uploaded all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be good stuff in there.</v>

174
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

175
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:23.900
<v Speaker 1>So you thought this was coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was in some ways.</v>

176
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

177
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.600
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't just because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

178
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in with a bunch of tech people who</v>

179
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:28.934
<v Speaker 1>understood this too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of them had taken me off the </v>

180
00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:32.900
<v Speaker 1>radio and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to put you on the Internet.</v>

181
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:35.540
<v Speaker 1>This was in 94.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

182
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 1>put me on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

183
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:38.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just learning how to use the,</v>

184
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.380
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to do?</v>

185
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:39.950
<v Speaker 1>And you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

186
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:40.783
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to invent the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to do this and you going to be </v>

187
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 1>the test person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

188
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 1>That shows everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

189
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:47.270
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that fell through.</v>

190
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 1>But once that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

191
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was in the back of my head going,</v>

192
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.013
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someday we might be able to do this on </v>

193
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:53.060
<v Speaker 1>the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

194
00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:53.631
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

195
00:06:53.631 --> 00:06:56.030
<v Speaker 1>the point was is that these people do </v>
<v Speaker 1>venture capital meetings.</v>

196
00:06:56.031 --> 00:06:59.030
<v Speaker 1>All these hardcore guys were inventing </v>
<v Speaker 1>our future and funding it.</v>

197
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.550
<v Speaker 1>None of them saw this amateur content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then coming,</v>

198
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.610
<v Speaker 1>there was one thing that they were doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a long time ago.</v>

199
00:07:04.611 --> 00:07:05.444
<v Speaker 1>There was like some Internet radio </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel because they had tried to put </v>

200
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:09.224
<v Speaker 1>together and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had funded it and spend a bunch of </v>

201
00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:12.494
<v Speaker 1>money on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hired a bunch of people to do it </v>

202
00:07:13.401 --> 00:07:15.830
<v Speaker 1>and Bobby Slayton was actually one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

203
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:16.664
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the online broadcasters and I did his </v>

204
00:07:18.381 --> 00:07:19.214
<v Speaker 1>show and he didn't know and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about how they were having a </v>

205
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:25.400
<v Speaker 1>hard time keeping it up and wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>catching on the way they wanted to.</v>

206
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.950
<v Speaker 1>They were just a little bit ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your head too far.</v>

207
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.920
<v Speaker 1>I read somewhere too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I was actually sort of researching</v>

208
00:07:30.921 --> 00:07:33.140
<v Speaker 1>the history of what we do and what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>precursors were.</v>

209
00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:33.974
<v Speaker 1>And I guess there were audio blogs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that some really high tech types </v>

210
00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:41.330
<v Speaker 1>where we're pursuing in the 90s also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe even the late eighties where,</v>

211
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:42.164
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like send in full files to each </v>

212
00:07:43.371 --> 00:07:44.690
<v Speaker 1>other or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

213
00:07:44.691 --> 00:07:45.524
<v Speaker 1>it's funny because somebody is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>write a book someday about the history </v>

214
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:49.580
<v Speaker 1>of this and how it got started and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff.</v>

215
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:50.414
<v Speaker 1>And it's crazy to think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're actually due to sort of a </v>

216
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.100
<v Speaker 1>serendipity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>

217
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:59.240
<v Speaker 1>good timing sense that here we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said in the first 10 years,</v>

218
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 1>15 years of of what's not just going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a phenomenon,</v>

219
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:02.984
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to be a huge part I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the future world that people grow up </v>

220
00:08:05.271 --> 00:08:07.490
<v Speaker 1>and not our show specifically but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

221
00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:10.250
<v Speaker 1>but this world we're creating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everyone's a broadcast or now.</v>

222
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>

223
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:14.600
<v Speaker 1>anyone could have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's been a lot of barriers to</v>

224
00:08:14.601 --> 00:08:16.460
<v Speaker 1>keep people that are really talented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

225
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:18.950
<v Speaker 1>funny people from getting their stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

226
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.560
<v Speaker 1>And that thing was like always like they</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know how to start.</v>

227
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.990
<v Speaker 1>How do I like how do I become a standup </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian enough to,</v>

228
00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:27.020
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to so many funny guys and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just go,</v>

229
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:28.100
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I get started?</v>

230
00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:28.934
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you got to go sign up at an open </v>

231
00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:31.160

233
00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:33.704
<v Speaker 1>the idea of it is too daunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you just sit in front of a </v>

234
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 1>camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all you have to do.</v>

235
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Turn your cell phone on and start </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>

236
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.053
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I think about Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what I think about Harvey </v>

237
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.373
<v Speaker 1>Weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is have a unique </v>

238
00:08:46.341 --> 00:08:46.610
<v Speaker 1>take.</v>

239
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Be Funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be interesting,</v>

240
00:08:47.871 --> 00:08:50.900
<v Speaker 1>somehow engaging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't even have to be visual.</v>

241
00:08:50.901 --> 00:08:51.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

242
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.393
<v Speaker 1>there's a hundred maybe more really </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny what I would call twitter </v>

243
00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:56.814
<v Speaker 1>comedians that just save funny shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They write funny shit on twitter and </v>

244
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:03.930
<v Speaker 1>they have huge followings because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say,</v>

245
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.003
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to look at what the brick and </v>

246
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:09.070
<v Speaker 1>mortar analog version of this was before</v>
<v Speaker 1>this came around.</v>

247
00:09:09.071 --> 00:09:11.370
<v Speaker 1>And Remember Mc Hammer was selling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

248
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:12.204
<v Speaker 1>cassette tapes of his music out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of his hatchback at the Oakland a's </v>

249
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:15.684
<v Speaker 1>games or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I think of like Eddie Murphy or </v>

250
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Richard Pryor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people who are just,</v>

251
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.640
<v Speaker 1>they're so funny that you could put them</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a crappily recorded cassette tape and</v>

252
00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:25.680
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't make any difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

253
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:26.523
<v Speaker 1>and I remember Eddie Murphy saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about if he hadn't gotten on </v>

254
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:29.034
<v Speaker 1>Saturday night live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't know how he would of how he </v>

255
00:09:30.721 --> 00:09:32.220
<v Speaker 1>would have exposed himself to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>

256
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.181
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these days,</v>

257
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:36.870
<v Speaker 1>if you're that funny and you put that on</v>
<v Speaker 1>audio and you put it out there,</v>

258
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.210
<v Speaker 1>you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

259
00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:39.044
<v Speaker 1>know you no longer need the facilitator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gatekeeper to open the doors for </v>

260

299
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>34 that's old to these yarn.</v>

300
00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:08.080
<v Speaker 1>Trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody over 30?</v>

301
00:11:08.081 --> 00:11:09.210
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

302
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.570
<v Speaker 1>that was back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

303
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.790
<v Speaker 1>but the 30s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forties,</v>

304
00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:13.680
<v Speaker 1>the new 30 so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything changes.</v>

305
00:11:13.681 --> 00:11:14.514
<v Speaker 1>So what the fuck am I dirt like dirt </v>
<v Speaker 1>still at the top of the of the iceberg </v>

306
00:11:19.051 --> 00:11:19.884
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the ahead of the game and </v>

307
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.400
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing,</v>

308
00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:24.234
<v Speaker 1>what we're experiencing now I think is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top of the iceberg because I think </v>

309
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.403
<v Speaker 1>there's some shit that's coming down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pipe that is going to blow all this out </v>

310
00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:34.050
<v Speaker 1>of the water and the idea of just </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to things,</v>

311
00:11:34.051 --> 00:11:35.040
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be ridiculous.</v>

312
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.873
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be so surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really believe like what you were </v>

313
00:11:37.561 --> 00:11:40.080
<v Speaker 1>saying about some sort of a matrix </v>
<v Speaker 1>plugin.</v>

314
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:40.890
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend,</v>

315
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:43.710
<v Speaker 1>my friend Dunkin has one of those htc </v>
<v Speaker 1>vives.</v>

316
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.410
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever seen those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those you mean virtual reality?</v>

317
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put the helmet on.</v>

318
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I have one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have one of those as well.</v>

319
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Part of the part of the Gig I'm working </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

320
00:11:51.151 --> 00:11:51.631
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

321
00:11:51.631 --> 00:11:53.170
<v Speaker 1>you want to talk about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sent it to me.</v>

322
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.180
<v Speaker 1>They sent it to me and I'll tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's cool.</v>

323
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.580
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to interrupt your story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go have been a change as well.</v>

324
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Google earth is on the the virtual </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality thing,</v>

325
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:01.571
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just,</v>

326
00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:04.240
<v Speaker 1>and they just started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just put out a new,</v>

327
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:05.440
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a new update.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't go.</v>

328
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:06.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm old so don't quote me on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

329
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:10.360
<v Speaker 1>but the update allows you now to zoom in</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the ground level now.</v>

330
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not virtual reality at the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

331
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:15.910
<v Speaker 1>It's more like your in the photograph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really cool.</v>

332
00:12:15.911 --> 00:12:17.740
<v Speaker 1>I I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just a week ago I went to all the</v>

333
00:12:17.741 --> 00:12:20.670
<v Speaker 1>homes I grew up in as a kid and went </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to Jamie's.</v>

334
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

335
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.710
<v Speaker 1>this is how it always looked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even like a year ago,</v>

336
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:27.870
<v Speaker 1>but now you can zoom into the ground and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people around you at all these,</v>

337
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:32.560
<v Speaker 1>it's truly awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have spent sane and it's only going to</v>

338
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:34.450
<v Speaker 1>be better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll actually at some point have real</v>

339
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:37.120
<v Speaker 1>virtual reality on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anywhere you want to go.</v>

340
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.650
<v Speaker 1>This is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

341
00:12:38.651 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 1>that's what I think is going to come up </v>
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>

342
00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:44.260
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to have it set up </v>
<v Speaker 1>where like this podcast,</v>

343
00:12:44.261 --> 00:12:47.110
<v Speaker 1>you'll be able to put on some goggles </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this lady is wearing here.</v>

344
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.600
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna be able to put up some </v>
<v Speaker 1>goggles.</v>

345
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.920
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be in this room with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be behind me.</v>

346
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.560

<v Speaker 1>You'll do whatever the fuck you want.</v>

351
00:12:59.501 --> 00:13:04.501

<v Speaker 1>d and flat and archaic and just a decade</v>

00:13:05.501 --> 00:13:06.334
<v Speaker 1>or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's waiting though for the big </v>

365
00:13:30.971 --> 00:13:34.330
<v Speaker 1>terms of like android versus apple as </v>
<v Speaker 1>these android phones,</v>

366
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:38.570
<v Speaker 1>they slide into these headsets now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they act as virtual reality screen.</v>

367
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Like a low level one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

368
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.940
<v Speaker 1>Not that bad man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

369
00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.490
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen it,</v>

370
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they told me again,</v>

371
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.170
<v Speaker 1>they um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that the overlords,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

373
00:13:48.341 --> 00:13:50.940
<v Speaker 1>the overlords.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand the mushroom overlords.</v>

374
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.360
<v Speaker 1>That's what I heard earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

375
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:53.830
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

376
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.290
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were telling me that,</v>

377
00:13:55.291 --> 00:13:59.200
<v Speaker 1>that the I phones from apple also are </v>
<v Speaker 1>built for that capability.</v>

378
00:13:59.201 --> 00:14:01.300
<v Speaker 1>They just haven't introduced the add ons</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would need.</v>

379
00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:03.760
<v Speaker 1>But in terms of the power that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>put in there,</v>

380
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:06.280
<v Speaker 1>they built it for that so it can scale </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

381
00:14:06.281 --> 00:14:07.114
<v Speaker 1>Eventually.</v>

<v Speaker 1>with google,</v>

394
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.670

<v Speaker 1>I messaged servers and have your email </v>
<v Speaker 1>removed.</v>

422
00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go and do that.</v>

423

<v Speaker 1>you gotta change your number or watts.</v>

427
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.160
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to try to use an android </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>

428
00:15:52.161 --> 00:15:53.360
<v Speaker 1>you have to change your phone number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

430
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.720

<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

431
00:15:56.721 --> 00:15:58.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

432
00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:01.170
<v Speaker 1>this is too much noodling around high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

433
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:02.443
<v Speaker 1>One problem with a password these days </v>
<v Speaker 1>can occupy your whole day trying to </v>

434
00:16:05.151 --> 00:16:06.260
<v Speaker 1>figure out the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

435
00:16:06.261 --> 00:16:07.490
<v Speaker 1>I had it with the email.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

436
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:11.330
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know Yahoo Mail was down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm thinking it's my problem.</v>

437
00:16:11.331 --> 00:16:12.890
<v Speaker 1>So I'm spending the whole day working on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

438
00:16:12.891 --> 00:16:14.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm changing passwords,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

439
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.991
<v Speaker 1>find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>

440
00:16:14.991 --> 00:16:15.824
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yahoo was just down all those past </v>

441
00:16:16.431 --> 00:16:17.264
<v Speaker 1>rigid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to do any of that and it's </v>

442
00:16:18.011 --> 00:16:18.844
<v Speaker 1>screwed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that Yad before and I'm 51 </v>

443
00:16:21.141 --> 00:16:22.400
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens when you get old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

444
00:16:22.401 --> 00:16:25.400
<v Speaker 1>I got a Mac book and I got a phone call </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my book.</v>

445
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:26.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>

446
00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:27.013
<v Speaker 1>What is this bullshit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I updated something and all of a sudden </v>

447
00:16:30.021 --> 00:16:32.390
<v Speaker 1>my laptop started ringing and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

448
00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:32.961
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

449
00:16:32.961 --> 00:16:33.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

450
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:34.760
<v Speaker 1>We're not doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

451
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ask my children.</v>

452
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:37.663
<v Speaker 1>I'm at the point now where I'm literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking my teenage children for help and </v>

453
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:41.623
<v Speaker 1>that to me is a sign right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the first sign that eventually </v>

454
00:16:43.821 --> 00:16:46.310
<v Speaker 1>leads you into that home that they put </v>
<v Speaker 1>you in.</v>

455
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:47.323
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the first step towards my </v>

456
00:16:48.261 --> 00:16:49.340
<v Speaker 1>children going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

457
00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:51.530
<v Speaker 1>my father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's bizarre man?</v>

458
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.140
<v Speaker 1>My kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just figure shit out.</v>

459
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Like if you give a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

460
00:16:55.911 --> 00:16:58.940
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how intuitive some of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>APP creators are.</v>

461
00:16:58.941 --> 00:17:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because my eye,</v>

462
00:17:00.531 --> 00:17:03.950
<v Speaker 1>my nine year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she started making these little movies.</v>

463
00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.620
<v Speaker 1>She's got this little editing thing on </v>
<v Speaker 1>our ipad.</v>

464
00:17:06.621 --> 00:17:07.610
<v Speaker 1>My 12 year old does it too.</v>

465
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:08.443
<v Speaker 1>So she's filming little scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She splices them all together and then </v>

466
00:17:11.061 --> 00:17:13.730
<v Speaker 1>she adds music and text to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she goes,</v>

467
00:17:13.731 --> 00:17:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to see the movie?</v>

468
00:17:14.571 --> 00:17:15.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

469
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.380
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

470
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.300
<v Speaker 1>And it's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>

471
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:20.360
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what though?</v>

472
00:17:20.361 --> 00:17:21.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a creative standpoint,</v>

473
00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.370
<v Speaker 1>it's so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

474
00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.253
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I tend to have a personality that </v>

475
00:17:25.041 --> 00:17:25.874
<v Speaker 1>does this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any way to look at the negative </v>

476
00:17:26.721 --> 00:17:27.950
<v Speaker 1>Dystopian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ya know,</v>

477
00:17:27.951 --> 00:17:29.450
<v Speaker 1>things that can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big brother things,</v>

478
00:17:29.451 --> 00:17:30.830
<v Speaker 1>which is totally the way I see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

479
00:17:30.831 --> 00:17:31.460
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

480
00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.340
<v Speaker 1>but my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I look at the creativity,</v>

481
00:17:34.341 --> 00:17:35.174
<v Speaker 1>so in my family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come from a family of people who </v>

482
00:17:36.321 --> 00:17:37.910
<v Speaker 1>worked in film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I was a kid,</v>

483
00:17:37.911 --> 00:17:38.744
<v Speaker 1>I had a super eight camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the old editing setup dance </v>

484
00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.430
<v Speaker 1>licensed by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to make a little space videos and</v>

485
00:17:43.431 --> 00:17:44.264
<v Speaker 1>I figured out you scratch the film with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a needle frame after frame and you can </v>

486
00:17:46.641 --> 00:17:47.570
<v Speaker 1>make laser beams.</v>

487
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:48.830
<v Speaker 1>And so when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that.</v>

488
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 1>So like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

489
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.680
<v Speaker 1>my daughter comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was only two weeks ago and she's,</v>

490
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.560
<v Speaker 1>she's taken all of her school plays that</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's done.</v>

491
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:56.603
<v Speaker 1>She's taken scenes out of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's backed it with music and she's </v>

492
00:17:59.041 --> 00:18:02.010
<v Speaker 1>turned it into like a movie promo that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see at the beginning of the theater.</v>

493
00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.880
<v Speaker 1>And I'm looking at this and I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so dang creative.</v>

494
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.820
<v Speaker 1>And it's made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how hard it would have been for</v>

495
00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:10.830
<v Speaker 1>her to get a super eight camera and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>editing device.</v>

496
00:18:10.831 --> 00:18:11.221
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

497
00:18:11.221 --> 00:18:12.054
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this makes it available to all these </v>

498
00:18:14.311 --> 00:18:15.900
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so theoretically,</v>

499
00:18:15.901 --> 00:18:18.690
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't go the Dan Carlin </v>
<v Speaker 1>dystopian blade runner way,</v>

500
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:19.853
<v Speaker 1>it could easily be like this and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>how I used to sell the the amateur </v>

501
00:18:22.531 --> 00:18:23.364
<v Speaker 1>content to the venture capitalists in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nineties by saying it's going to be </v>

502
00:18:25.231 --> 00:18:26.064
<v Speaker 1>a creativity revolution and Joe Rogan's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine year old is already taking part in </v>

503
00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:30.900
<v Speaker 1>it and you're not even sure how she did </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

504
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.420
<v Speaker 1>That's how we know we're have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched her do it.</v>

505
00:18:33.421 --> 00:18:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you doing this?</v>

506
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Who taught you how to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I figured it out.</v>

507
00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.450
<v Speaker 1>You figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just figured it out because God,</v>

508
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.130
<v Speaker 1>he just put destiny into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Blah blah blah blah,</v>

509
00:18:41.131 --> 00:18:41.700
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

510
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:42.820
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to do one?</v>

511
00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:43.654
<v Speaker 1>Let's do one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can do them fast and slow mo </v>

512
00:18:46.201 --> 00:18:48.270
<v Speaker 1>and all these different little effects </v>
<v Speaker 1>he could put on it.</v>

513
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.463
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the old days when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have two vhs tapes to trying to do this </v>

514
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:54.203
<v Speaker 1>and you would press one on record and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other one I'm planning you would </v>

515
00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:58.590
<v Speaker 1>record from each other?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

516
00:18:58.591 --> 00:19:02.220
<v Speaker 1>And it worked about 50% of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like the cuts were so obvious,</v>

517
00:19:02.221 --> 00:19:05.640
<v Speaker 1>like the cuts and scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was never seamless.</v>

518
00:19:05.641 --> 00:19:09.860
<v Speaker 1>There was always like this big fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>digital fas in between the scenes aspect</v>

519
00:19:09.861 --> 00:19:12.450
<v Speaker 1>of something that you and I were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about when we first started here.</v>

520
00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.670
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what the technology can do.</v>

521
00:19:14.671 --> 00:19:16.110
<v Speaker 1>So like I'm straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're out there,</v>

522
00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:17.310
<v Speaker 1>you're going to hear me talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

523
00:19:17.311 --> 00:19:18.144
<v Speaker 1>this may be a personal one to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation with someone in your </v>

524
00:19:20.431 --> 00:19:21.264
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somebody did something that is both </v>

525
00:19:22.741 --> 00:19:25.740
<v Speaker 1>flattering and absolutely terrifying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me recently.</v>

526
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went and they said it took hundreds</v>

527
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:30.023
<v Speaker 1>of hours and they called a ton of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows and they made little clips of all </v>

528
00:19:34.561 --> 00:19:35.394
<v Speaker 1>the things I said and then rearrange </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and created an absolutely new show </v>

529
00:19:39.601 --> 00:19:42.150
<v Speaker 1>about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately with me.</v>

530
00:19:42.151 --> 00:19:45.120
<v Speaker 1>And you cannot tell that they've cut </v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing 9,000</v>

531
00:19:45.121 --> 00:19:48.810
<v Speaker 1>different times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's my voice saying a whole show of</v>

532
00:19:48.811 --> 00:19:51.190
<v Speaker 1>political stuff that I never said made </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

533
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.633
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy said it took him hundreds of </v>

534
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:54.101
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

535
00:19:54.101 --> 00:19:55.290
<v Speaker 1>he's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

536
00:19:55.291 --> 00:19:56.970
<v Speaker 1>But you turn around and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

537
00:19:56.971 --> 00:19:58.270
<v Speaker 1>somebody is going to take a little tie.</v>

538
00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:59.103
<v Speaker 1>And he had at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not Dan Carlin really saying </v>

539
00:20:00.391 --> 00:20:01.224
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some guys going to take like some </v>

540
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:02.843
<v Speaker 1>obscure weird segment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it on the Internet and I'm going to </v>

541
00:20:04.441 --> 00:20:06.180
<v Speaker 1>be chasing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that group going,</v>

542
00:20:06.181 --> 00:20:06.841
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not me.</v>

543
00:20:06.841 --> 00:20:07.674
<v Speaker 1>That guy didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you don't even have to do that </v>

544
00:20:08.611 --> 00:20:09.870
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's just audio.</v>

545
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.840
<v Speaker 1>What they're doing now is you could take</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 hours of audio,</v>

546
00:20:12.841 --> 00:20:15.750
<v Speaker 1>which obviously you and I both have way </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than that.</v>

547
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.793
<v Speaker 1>They take that 40 hours of audio and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can essentially have you say </v>

548
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.080
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything ever.</v>

549
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.390
<v Speaker 1>So is that going to get us out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the conversation we had.</v>

550
00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:26.190
<v Speaker 1>So can you say to somebody when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

551
00:20:26.191 --> 00:20:29.100
<v Speaker 1>I heard Dan Carlin said he's all for </v>
<v Speaker 1>child molesting all this clip.</v>

552
00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Can you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

553
00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:31.590
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not me.</v>

554
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.660
<v Speaker 1>And look there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all this stuff out there.</v>

555
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.553
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it gonna?</v>

556
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.393
<v Speaker 1>Is that gonna get you out of trouble or </v>
<v Speaker 1>a CNN gonna run that story and you'll </v>

557
00:20:37.471 --> 00:20:38.304
<v Speaker 1>never be able to whack a mole your way </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of once they understand that that </v>

558
00:20:40.951 --> 00:20:41.784
<v Speaker 1>technology is available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have to be at least </v>

559
00:20:43.471 --> 00:20:45.570
<v Speaker 1>questioning the source of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they don't,</v>

560
00:20:45.571 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 1>you just see the shit out of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they're going to</v>

561
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.150
<v Speaker 3>jump on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of like photo shopping.</v>

562
00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:51.163
<v Speaker 3>I'm shopping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember when Oscar de la Hoya </v>

563
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:57.610
<v Speaker 3>got caught wearing fish nets and high </v>
<v Speaker 3>heeled shoes with boxing gloves on?</v>

564
00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:58.563
<v Speaker 3>He was coked up and he was hanging </v>
<v Speaker 3>around with some crazy rush and </v>

565
00:21:00.371 --> 00:21:01.204
<v Speaker 3>strippers and he was having a good old </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and just thought it was fun to </v>

566
00:21:03.791 --> 00:21:05.680
<v Speaker 3>dress up like a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

567
00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:06.514
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was very deeply embarrassed by </v>

568
00:21:09.431 --> 00:21:11.320
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously he's Mexican,</v>

569
00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:15.580
<v Speaker 3>so Latino boxing fans were not taken </v>
<v Speaker 3>very kindly to that.</v>

570
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:16.660
<v Speaker 3>So he just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

571
00:21:16.661 --> 00:21:18.490
<v Speaker 3>that shits fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been photoshop.</v>

572
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.510
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

573
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:20.530
<v Speaker 3>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There he is.</v>

574
00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.470
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we know that's Oscar Dela.</v>

575
00:21:23.471 --> 00:21:25.670
<v Speaker 3>He's having a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's wearing a wig and one of them and a</v>

576
00:21:25.671 --> 00:21:26.504
<v Speaker 3>hat they were thinking about is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the left hook to the liver that </v>

577
00:21:30.311 --> 00:21:31.144
<v Speaker 3>Bernard Hopkins hit him with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put him down on the deck and I think </v>

578
00:21:34.031 --> 00:21:36.940
<v Speaker 3>about him beating up Julio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cesar Chavez where all the Mexicans were</v>

579
00:21:36.941 --> 00:21:37.880
<v Speaker 3>mad at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

580
00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.013
<v Speaker 3>prime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the girl that he was with go </v>

581
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:41.330
<v Speaker 3>above that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

582
00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.360
<v Speaker 3>the two pictures with him and the girl?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

583
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:46.180
<v Speaker 3>Is that the girl that turned to been </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep an eye on that bitch.</v>

584
00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:48.190
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to get a lap dance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's going to tell people.</v>

585
00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.980
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guess I guess they uh,</v>

586
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:54.100
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's her right there.</v>

587
00:21:54.101 --> 00:21:54.934
<v Speaker 3>I guess that looks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Photoshop does look sort of photoshop </v>

588
00:21:57.531 --> 00:22:01.030
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not gladly because it's his body</v>
<v Speaker 3>means always an athlete's body,</v>

589
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.300
<v Speaker 3>but he's wearing a skirt and look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were partying.</v>

590
00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.520
<v Speaker 3>He's having a good fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We thought it was silly to play.</v>

591
00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:09.640
<v Speaker 3>Dress up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck you mean?</v>

592
00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.250
<v Speaker 3>Look at the one in the upper right </v>
<v Speaker 3>though and he's bending over.</v>

593
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.860
<v Speaker 3>Look at that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one's rough weight of it.</v>

594
00:22:14.861 --> 00:22:15.694
<v Speaker 3>So could you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it almost seems to me that it's the </v>

595
00:22:16.811 --> 00:22:19.840
<v Speaker 3>perfect cover cause now you could do </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything you wanted to.</v>

596
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:20.673
<v Speaker 3>I mean if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's the Clinton years in office and </v>

597
00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:23.500
<v Speaker 3>bill cleanse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do anything you wanted to just hit</v>

598
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.940
<v Speaker 3>it's photoshop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not me.</v>

599
00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.750
<v Speaker 3>You kind of can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can tell they can sorta towel.</v>

600
00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.870
<v Speaker 3>If you have an expert look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can break it down sort of.</v>

601
00:22:30.871 --> 00:22:31.704
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's a lot of the problem is all </v>

602
00:22:33.581 --> 00:22:37.750
<v Speaker 3>you have to do is have a few people say </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's real and then a few people say it's</v>

603
00:22:37.751 --> 00:22:39.700
<v Speaker 3>fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the people that want it to be real.</v>

604
00:22:39.701 --> 00:22:40.860
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

605
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.753
<v Speaker 3>And how do you chase it down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you would constantly be one step </v>

606
00:22:44.981 --> 00:22:47.050
<v Speaker 3>behind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's even this way.</v>

607
00:22:47.051 --> 00:22:50.050
<v Speaker 3>Like I was talking about piracy earlier </v>
<v Speaker 3>and trying,</v>

608
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:51.183
<v Speaker 3>you know I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have these old line advisors who will </v>

609
00:22:52.841 --> 00:22:53.674
<v Speaker 3>say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to be charging for your new </v>

610
00:22:54.671 --> 00:22:56.120
<v Speaker 3>shows and not and more money into it.</v>

611
00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.660
<v Speaker 3>And I sit there and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our competition is piracy,</v>

612
00:22:58.661 --> 00:22:59.494
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you got to make everything so </v>

613
00:23:00.611 --> 00:23:03.580
<v Speaker 3>cheap and guilt amounts of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to go pirate your stuff.</v>

614
00:23:03.581 --> 00:23:04.510
<v Speaker 3>They feel but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

615
00:23:04.511 --> 00:23:05.350
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

616
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:09.070
<v Speaker 3>the idea of um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm forgetting where I told him,</v>

617
00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:09.963
<v Speaker 3>I told you this was going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't have any shopping your moments </v>

618
00:23:12.251 --> 00:23:13.270
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

619
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:14.100
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

620
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:14.933
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we had it with Obama's birth </v>

621
00:23:16.271 --> 00:23:17.104
<v Speaker 3>certificate or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Obama birth certificate was a real </v>

622
00:23:19.301 --> 00:23:20.134
<v Speaker 3>issue because there was people that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>examining it and they say they were </v>

623
00:23:22.091 --> 00:23:24.100
<v Speaker 3>going putting it through photoshop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go and look,</v>

624
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.830
<v Speaker 3>this is clearly fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

625
00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:27.693
<v Speaker 3>here's the filters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see how it's been added and </v>

626
00:23:29.021 --> 00:23:29.854
<v Speaker 3>edited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you had a bunch of people that </v>

627
00:23:30.821 --> 00:23:32.680
<v Speaker 3>were actually photoshop experts say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

628
00:23:32.681 --> 00:23:33.610
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no dip shit.</v>

629
00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:35.920
<v Speaker 3>This is how photoshop breaks down </v>
<v Speaker 3>images.</v>

630
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.920
<v Speaker 3>It breaks them down into layers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This isn't fake.</v>

631
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:42.730
<v Speaker 3>Like this is the actual image and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is how photoshop process is.</v>

632
00:23:42.731 --> 00:23:43.820
<v Speaker 3>Images.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

633
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.673
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All it took was enough people to show </v>

634
00:23:47.631 --> 00:23:50.600
<v Speaker 3>you the original photoshop image and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

635
00:23:50.601 --> 00:23:52.910
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's why when we put it in photoshop,</v>

636
00:23:52.911 --> 00:23:53.744
<v Speaker 3>you see all these layers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clearly it's fake and then they just </v>

637
00:23:55.671 --> 00:23:56.504
<v Speaker 3>fucking run with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just run with it on their online </v>

638
00:23:58.431 --> 00:23:59.264
<v Speaker 3>forums and on there they got the little </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter group of right wing people that </v>

639
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:03.164
<v Speaker 3>want to think that Obama's at Kenyan </v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslim who's a some sort of Manchurian </v>

640
00:24:06.021 --> 00:24:08.690
<v Speaker 3>candidate and there was a lot of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on,</v>

641
00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:13.010
<v Speaker 3>but when I talked to people like Red </v>
<v Speaker 3>Band who actually understands photoshop,</v>

642
00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:13.340
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

643
00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.173
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what happens when you put an </v>

644
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:16.214
<v Speaker 3>image in photoshop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It breaks it down into layers like it </v>

645
00:24:18.561 --> 00:24:22.520
<v Speaker 3>shows you how this is how you would edit</v>
<v Speaker 3>something in photoshop.</v>

646
00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.640
<v Speaker 3>I think the point you made earlier when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you started talking about that though is</v>

647
00:24:25.641 --> 00:24:29.060
<v Speaker 3>the key one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is if you want to believe this,</v>

648
00:24:29.061 --> 00:24:29.894
<v Speaker 3>here's your evidence and you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>ignore it and if you don't want to the </v>

649
00:24:32.121 --> 00:24:34.700
<v Speaker 3>opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a piece that never got published</v>

650
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.340
<v Speaker 3>in the late eighties called the death of</v>
<v Speaker 3>objective truth.</v>

651
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:38.503
<v Speaker 3>And I thought at the time that this was </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you couldn't have arguments </v>

652
00:24:40.971 --> 00:24:43.730
<v Speaker 3>anymore because no one would accept your</v>
<v Speaker 3>source if you said,</v>

653
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:44.564
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the New York Times said this when I was </v>

654
00:24:45.951 --> 00:24:47.570
<v Speaker 3>a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the starting point.</v>

655
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.051
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

656
00:24:48.051 --> 00:24:49.280
<v Speaker 3>If the New York Times says this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

657
00:24:49.281 --> 00:24:50.114
<v Speaker 3>we both believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we can have a conversation about </v>

658
00:24:51.231 --> 00:24:53.130
<v Speaker 3>what the New York Times says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

659
00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:57.830
<v Speaker 3>nowadays I can't have political </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussions with people anymore cause it</v>

660
00:24:57.831 --> 00:24:59.990
<v Speaker 3>never gets past ground zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

661
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.150
<v Speaker 3>We start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I make a premise,</v>

662
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.620
<v Speaker 3>you challenge the premise.</v>

663
00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.660
<v Speaker 3>I bring in a piece of evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>

664
00:25:05.661 --> 00:25:07.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that evidence at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the other evidence.</v>

665
00:25:07.701 --> 00:25:09.290
<v Speaker 3>And Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jonah Goldberg,</v>

666
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:10.303
<v Speaker 3>who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a standard conservative columnist </v>

667
00:25:12.111 --> 00:25:14.060
<v Speaker 3>wrote a piece a couple months ago where </v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

668
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.133
<v Speaker 3>I can't even have fun political </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussions anymore cause you never get </v>

669
00:25:17.451 --> 00:25:19.430
<v Speaker 3>past the beginning of the talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

670
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:23.810
<v Speaker 3>We disagree over over the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't even what we're talking about.</v>

671
00:25:23.811 --> 00:25:24.410
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's,</v>

672
00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:25.490
<v Speaker 3>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's reality.</v>

673
00:25:25.491 --> 00:25:26.810
<v Speaker 3>Now let's talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>

674
00:25:26.811 --> 00:25:28.520
<v Speaker 3>That's your reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not my area.</v>

675
00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:31.850
<v Speaker 3>And so you can't even have the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fun political discussions we had as kids</v>

676
00:25:31.851 --> 00:25:32.684
<v Speaker 3>or teenagers because there's a basic </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagreement on what reality looks like </v>

677
00:25:36.231 --> 00:25:37.220
<v Speaker 3>to different people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

678
00:25:37.221 --> 00:25:39.980
<v Speaker 3>Well there's these tribal agreeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>tribals the perfect.</v>

679
00:25:39.981 --> 00:25:40.814
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a tribal agreement to support </v>

680
00:25:42.051 --> 00:25:44.180
<v Speaker 3>the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you saw that with Hillary Clinton.</v>

681
00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.253
<v Speaker 3>There was so many people that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>defending Hillary Clinton and people </v>

682
00:25:47.541 --> 00:25:49.610
<v Speaker 3>were calling me right wing people that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

683
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:50.600
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you a right wing?</v>

684
00:25:50.601 --> 00:25:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Or now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

685
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:55.130
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton is a fucking liar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's really simple.</v>

686
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.053
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that I liked Donald </v>

687
00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:57.950
<v Speaker 3>Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

688
00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:01.280
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying you can't just because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't like Donald Trump.</v>

689
00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:05.060
<v Speaker 3>Ignore the fact that the Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 3>Foundation is Super Fucking Shady,</v>

690
00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.073
<v Speaker 3>that Hillary Clinton is clearly a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That they definitely did something with </v>

691
00:26:09.381 --> 00:26:13.310
<v Speaker 3>the DNC to rig the primaries to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders out.</v>

692
00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.020
<v Speaker 3>And now you have Donna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is her name?</v>

693
00:26:15.021 --> 00:26:15.854
<v Speaker 3>Donna Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donna Brazil coming out about all this </v>

694
00:26:17.511 --> 00:26:18.344
<v Speaker 3>stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's showing how it was all done </v>

695
00:26:20.181 --> 00:26:21.014
<v Speaker 3>and how Clinton sort of hijack the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire DNC during the campaign made </v>

696
00:26:24.741 --> 00:26:29.741
<v Speaker 3>everybody dependent upon her campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is tribal because people</v>

697
00:26:30.081 --> 00:26:30.641
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

698
00:26:30.641 --> 00:26:35.641
<v Speaker 3>they wanted so badly to get Donald Trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>and make sure he wasn't in office,</v>

699
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.943
<v Speaker 3>that they were supporting someone who </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't even support gay marriage until </v>

700
00:26:40.011 --> 00:26:40.844
<v Speaker 3>2013 I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was a creepy person in so many </v>

701
00:26:43.891 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 3>different</v>

702
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.053
<v Speaker 4>ways and still is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she represents their team so they </v>

703
00:26:48.361 --> 00:26:52.470
<v Speaker 4>would had this blind allegiance in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>tribal loyalty towards the left.</v>

704
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:53.573
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a real problem we have in this </v>

705
00:26:55.441 --> 00:26:59.520
<v Speaker 4>country where people just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fucking dolphins fan.</v>

706
00:26:59.521 --> 00:27:03.480
<v Speaker 4>It's dolphins to the death and they get </v>
<v Speaker 4>that way with the cubs and they get that</v>

707
00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:04.314
<v Speaker 4>way with Democrats and they get that way</v>
<v Speaker 4>with Republicans and you're seeing it </v>

708
00:27:06.811 --> 00:27:07.644
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're seeing it right now with people </v>

709
00:27:08.881 --> 00:27:09.714
<v Speaker 4>that have an inability to in any way say</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything negative about Donald Trump </v>

710
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.330
<v Speaker 4>because he's the president because he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a Republican.</v>

711
00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.760
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not living in reality.</v>

712
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:22.650
<v Speaker 4>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's certain things,</v>

713
00:27:22.651 --> 00:27:23.484
<v Speaker 4>there's certain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's certain things that we really </v>

714
00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:26.700
<v Speaker 4>need to be concerned about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Forget about politics.</v>

715
00:27:26.701 --> 00:27:28.950
<v Speaker 4>What about the Environmental Protection </v>
<v Speaker 4>Agency standards?</v>

716
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:29.933
<v Speaker 4>What about what they're doing in Alaska </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they're trying to drill for </v>

717
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.060
<v Speaker 4>minerals and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

718
00:27:33.061 --> 00:27:34.380
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have this,</v>

719
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:39.950
<v Speaker 4>a very important salmon river that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to drill right next to and</v>

720
00:27:39.961 --> 00:27:42.690
<v Speaker 4>they're passing this without any advice </v>
<v Speaker 4>from scientists.</v>

721
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:43.643
<v Speaker 4>They're just going straight to it to try</v>
<v Speaker 4>to make money and people are freaking </v>

722
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:49.350
<v Speaker 4>the fuck out about this kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Republicans,</v>

723
00:27:49.351 --> 00:27:51.450
<v Speaker 4>there's so many of them don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>say a peep.</v>

724
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.090
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to say a word about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's their guy.</v>

725
00:27:54.091 --> 00:27:56.850
<v Speaker 4>He's on their team and people are super </v>
<v Speaker 4>tribal about it.</v>

726
00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:57.963
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is part of the problem I've been </v>

727
00:27:59.041 --> 00:27:59.874
<v Speaker 5>having with my political show is I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and everybody thinks it's a trump </v>

728
00:28:02.311 --> 00:28:04.110
<v Speaker 5>related thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think it's what you said.</v>

729
00:28:04.111 --> 00:28:07.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm having an issue trying to figure out</v>

730
00:28:07.231 --> 00:28:09.150
<v Speaker 5>if my basic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

731
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.013
<v Speaker 5>if my basic understanding of how a </v>
<v Speaker 5>system like ours is supposed to work is </v>

732
00:28:13.261 --> 00:28:15.000
<v Speaker 5>fundamentally flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

733
00:28:15.001 --> 00:28:15.834
<v Speaker 5>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always like to say that wisdom </v>

734
00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:20.160
<v Speaker 5>requires a flexible mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I gotta I gotta live that too,</v>

735
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.760
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if I'm seeing stuff that doesn't back</v>

736
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:24.780
<v Speaker 5>up my theory on how things are supposed </v>
<v Speaker 5>to work,</v>

737
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:26.910
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I have to sit back a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>bit and go,</v>

738
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.440
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are we seeing here?</v>

739
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:31.380
<v Speaker 5>And you mentioned a bunch of fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 5>societal changes we're going through.</v>

740
00:28:31.381 --> 00:28:32.214
<v Speaker 5>And we started talking with whether </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about amateur content or </v>

741
00:28:33.931 --> 00:28:35.460
<v Speaker 5>everybody being able to broadcast and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all that.</v>

742
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:38.930
<v Speaker 5>We didn't even mention the fact that our</v>
<v Speaker 5>broadcasts are international now,</v>

743
00:28:38.931 --> 00:28:40.710
<v Speaker 5>so you're not just talking to Americans </v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>

744
00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:41.843
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it makes me start to wonder about </v>

745
00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:47.100
<v Speaker 5>the basic idea of are we smart enough </v>
<v Speaker 5>and this,</v>

746
00:28:47.101 --> 00:28:49.620
<v Speaker 5>this goes against all my principles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's hard for me,</v>

747
00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:54.890
<v Speaker 5>but are we smart enough and does our </v>
<v Speaker 5>modern society require us all to be more</v>

748
00:28:55.441 --> 00:28:59.040
<v Speaker 5>intelligent or in touch or understanding</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the facts?</v>

749
00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.120
<v Speaker 5>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

750
00:29:00.121 --> 00:29:03.840
<v Speaker 5>American voters 75 years ago had to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

751
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm starting to see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>

752
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.650
<v Speaker 5>this isn't about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about what you were talking about.</v>

753
00:29:07.651 --> 00:29:12.030
<v Speaker 5>The fact that we're having discussions </v>
<v Speaker 5>over stuff that either isn't real or you</v>

754
00:29:12.031 --> 00:29:12.864
<v Speaker 5>don't understand the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you have a very strong opinion one </v>

755
00:29:14.401 --> 00:29:17.460
<v Speaker 5>way or the other about it or some talk </v>
<v Speaker 5>show host you trust,</v>

756
00:29:17.461 --> 00:29:18.420
<v Speaker 5>told you this is the way it is.</v>

757
00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:21.780
<v Speaker 5>So you're going to believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's put it this way,</v>

758
00:29:21.781 --> 00:29:22.614
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say we've always have had </v>

759
00:29:23.731 --> 00:29:26.430
<v Speaker 5>uninformed or tribal voters because we </v>
<v Speaker 5>always have,</v>

760
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.280
<v Speaker 5>is there a tipping point where if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have,</v>

761
00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:30.403
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it's changing 10% every decade that </v>

762
00:29:32.761 --> 00:29:33.241
<v Speaker 5>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

763
00:29:33.241 --> 00:29:35.820
<v Speaker 5>we used to have 20% of people who really</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't know what was going on.</v>

764
00:29:35.821 --> 00:29:39.420
<v Speaker 5>Now we have 70% of people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm starting to look back and go,</v>

765
00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.970
<v Speaker 5>if you can't have basic discussions </v>
<v Speaker 5>about reality,</v>

766
00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.610
<v Speaker 5>can you do your job as an,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a,</v>

767
00:29:45.611 --> 00:29:48.130
<v Speaker 5>as a voter in this society?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

768
00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:49.083
<v Speaker 5>and I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm backing up going cause I'm a </v>

769
00:29:50.531 --> 00:29:52.450
<v Speaker 5>Jeffersonian guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I believe,</v>

770
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:53.231
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>

771
00:29:53.231 --> 00:29:55.440
<v Speaker 5>in the old agricultural,</v>
<v Speaker 5>old Republican,</v>

772
00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:56.403
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a bunch of ideas that go to </v>

773
00:29:57.041 --> 00:29:57.874
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Part of it is a real trust in the </v>

774
00:29:58.931 --> 00:30:00.220
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

775
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:01.833
<v Speaker 5>I can't decide if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if the trust I've always had in the </v>

776
00:30:03.761 --> 00:30:06.370
<v Speaker 5>people was misplaced from the bay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the get go,</v>

777
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:07.503
<v Speaker 5>or if the challenges of this modern </v>
<v Speaker 5>society that we have and an entire </v>

778
00:30:10.871 --> 00:30:12.730
<v Speaker 5>generation and generations behind them.</v>

779
00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:13.563
<v Speaker 5>Let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>growing up in a world of 140 character </v>

780
00:30:15.791 --> 00:30:17.380
<v Speaker 5>conversations and all these different </v>
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

781
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:20.290
<v Speaker 5>if that doesn't fundamentally change us </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a way that you might say,</v>

782
00:30:20.291 --> 00:30:22.090
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the 50s we could handle our,</v>

783
00:30:22.091 --> 00:30:22.924
<v Speaker 5>our voting responsibilities better than </v>
<v Speaker 5>now because the challenge is to human </v>

784
00:30:26.231 --> 00:30:28.600
<v Speaker 5>beings now are greater.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

785
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:30.880
<v Speaker 5>and I don't have an answer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is why I'm sort of backing off and</v>

786
00:30:30.881 --> 00:30:33.600
<v Speaker 5>kind of observing instead of yakking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it for a change.</v>

787
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:34.443
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's simple.</v>

788
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:35.303
<v Speaker 5>I think it's important to talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 5>just because we were all trying to </v>

789
00:30:37.121 --> 00:30:38.590
<v Speaker 5>figure it out together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

790
00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.453
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's really what's going on here is </v>

791
00:30:40.931 --> 00:30:41.764
<v Speaker 5>that collectively,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've never really had a voice the way </v>

792
00:30:44.051 --> 00:30:46.780
<v Speaker 5>we have now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's never been 320,</v>

793
00:30:46.781 --> 00:30:49.770
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>million people that can just chime in.</v>

794
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.590
<v Speaker 5>And it's not even that.</v>

795
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:52.540
<v Speaker 5>I mean we have foreigners in Russian </v>
<v Speaker 5>bots.</v>

796
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:54.250
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

797
00:30:54.251 --> 00:30:56.050
<v Speaker 5>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is never happened.</v>

798
00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.010
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the old days.</v>

799
00:30:57.011 --> 00:30:57.844
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember they used to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it used to be considered like what your </v>

800
00:30:59.891 --> 00:31:00.724
<v Speaker 5>CIA would do or something just to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to broadcast Radio Free Europe over the </v>

801
00:31:04.541 --> 00:31:07.450
<v Speaker 5>Iron Curtain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Radio Free Europe is a joke.</v>

802
00:31:07.451 --> 00:31:09.650
<v Speaker 5>Now we all talk to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the timing.</v>

803
00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.470
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you say to yourself,</v>

804
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.440
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if the Russians are doing this to us,</v>

805
00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.460
<v Speaker 5>aren't we doing this to the Russians </v>
<v Speaker 5>have hindsight.</v>

806
00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:18.520
<v Speaker 5>It's 100%.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

807
00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:19.563
<v Speaker 5>the fake news that's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There may be a bunch of governments and </v>

808
00:31:22.271 --> 00:31:24.520
<v Speaker 5>corporations and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

809
00:31:24.521 --> 00:31:25.211
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they used to say,</v>

810
00:31:25.211 --> 00:31:26.044
<v Speaker 5>the best way to cover up your lie is to </v>
<v Speaker 5>just flood the system with more lies </v>

811
00:31:30.761 --> 00:31:33.040
<v Speaker 5>because then everything's up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

812
00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:33.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

813
00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:34.060
<v Speaker 5>that makes sense.</v>

814
00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:34.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And just,</v>

815
00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:37.180
<v Speaker 5>it flooded and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I feel like we're flooded now.</v>

816
00:31:37.181 --> 00:31:38.014
<v Speaker 5>And so if you say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are we more flooded than we were 75 </v>

817
00:31:39.761 --> 00:31:40.810
<v Speaker 5>years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if we are,</v>

818
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:45.190
<v Speaker 5>does that require more from the average </v>
<v Speaker 5>voter than we required 75 years ago?</v>

819
00:31:45.191 --> 00:31:46.024
<v Speaker 5>And let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the dirty little secret of the American </v>

820
00:31:47.951 --> 00:31:48.784
<v Speaker 5>system is everyone who studies it knows </v>
<v Speaker 5>is that once upon a time this voting </v>

821
00:31:52.031 --> 00:31:56.710
<v Speaker 5>franchise was actually in relatively few</v>
<v Speaker 5>hands and you had to,</v>

822
00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:58.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean the old idea behind running a </v>
<v Speaker 5>farm,</v>

823
00:31:58.721 --> 00:32:01.330
<v Speaker 5>I used to read this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a left wing writer who said it was all a</v>

824
00:32:01.331 --> 00:32:02.590
<v Speaker 5>part of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they hated poor people,</v>

825
00:32:02.591 --> 00:32:04.080
<v Speaker 5>so they didn't want it to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I dunno,</v>

826
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:05.860
<v Speaker 5>I think it was more of a voting </v>
<v Speaker 5>requirement that said,</v>

827
00:32:05.861 --> 00:32:07.120
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you can run a farm,</v>

828
00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:10.190
<v Speaker 5>you can't be too much of an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that'll be our requirement.</v>

829
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.400
<v Speaker 5>Yet I have this much land.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

830
00:32:12.401 --> 00:32:13.234
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you do feel like as democracies </v>

831
00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.390
<v Speaker 5>taken over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because we're really a republic,</v>

832
00:32:16.391 --> 00:32:19.450
<v Speaker 5>but we've been moving more towards a </v>
<v Speaker 5>democracy for 200 some years.</v>

833
00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.580
<v Speaker 5>If that happens and you turn it go </v>
<v Speaker 5>clean.</v>

834
00:32:21.581 --> 00:32:25.150
<v Speaker 5>Now we have no qualifications because </v>
<v Speaker 5>how would you implement them?</v>

835
00:32:25.151 --> 00:32:28.330
<v Speaker 5>Somebody would say this is racist or </v>
<v Speaker 5>classist or whatever,</v>

836
00:32:28.331 --> 00:32:31.690
<v Speaker 5>but without any requirements.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are we doing a ha,</v>

837
00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:35.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean how many people who are voting </v>
<v Speaker 5>really understand what's going on?</v>

838
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:36.340
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are those requirements like?</v>

839
00:32:36.341 --> 00:32:37.174
<v Speaker 5>Think about it from telling you that the</v>
<v Speaker 5>20 year old kid in my neighborhood </v>

840
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 5>bought a $7 million</v>

841
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:41.023
<v Speaker 3>house from Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This kid is obviously very wealthy and </v>

842
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:44.203
<v Speaker 3>but does he know what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to be smart or do you have </v>

843
00:32:46.221 --> 00:32:48.620
<v Speaker 3>to be wealthy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like do you have to be a land owner?</v>

844
00:32:48.621 --> 00:32:50.630
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to be a farmer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to be a business owner?</v>

845
00:32:50.631 --> 00:32:53.980
<v Speaker 3>He's essentially a business and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to take you to design test sort of</v>

846
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:55.040
<v Speaker 3>grades the test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who,</v>

847
00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.470
<v Speaker 3>who decides what the questions of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>informed voter,</v>

848
00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would know would be,</v>

849
00:32:58.491 --> 00:33:00.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean other right in the left going </v>
<v Speaker 3>agree in a parameter,</v>

850
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.640
<v Speaker 3>be like gerrymandering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Gerrymander,</v>

851
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.000
<v Speaker 3>the test,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know these people,</v>

852
00:33:05.001 --> 00:33:05.834
<v Speaker 3>these 320 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this new found responsibility of being </v>

853
00:33:09.201 --> 00:33:10.034
<v Speaker 3>able to chime in and communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're used to just being able to talk </v>

854
00:33:12.381 --> 00:33:13.214
<v Speaker 3>shit at the gas station they used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not used to this being </v>

855
00:33:15.531 --> 00:33:16.310
<v Speaker 3>permanent.</v>

856
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:20.060
<v Speaker 3>They're not used to this being political</v>
<v Speaker 3>arguments on twitter or crazy dude.</v>

857
00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:22.280
<v Speaker 3>The crazy crazy I want you look at him </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

858
00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.173
<v Speaker 3>The crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're fascinating though because I </v>

859
00:33:24.501 --> 00:33:25.334
<v Speaker 3>think this is one step.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is step one to this </v>

860
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.830
<v Speaker 3>augmented reality situation that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>

861
00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.233
<v Speaker 3>I think what this represents is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a deeper and deeper connection that </v>

862
00:33:36.531 --> 00:33:37.364
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think we're going to get past </v>

863
00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:44.000
<v Speaker 3>language and we're going to get past </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture and some sort of a weird way,</v>

864
00:33:44.001 --> 00:33:45.770
<v Speaker 3>and it might take a hundred years to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

865
00:33:45.771 --> 00:33:46.604
<v Speaker 3>but I really believe it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a universal operating </v>

866
00:33:48.741 --> 00:33:52.680
<v Speaker 3>system that allows us to exchange </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts in a,</v>

867
00:33:52.681 --> 00:33:53.514
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way that everyone understands some </v>

868
00:33:55.161 --> 00:33:57.380
<v Speaker 3>sort of a Rosetta stone for the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>

869
00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.161
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

870
00:33:58.161 --> 00:33:58.790
<v Speaker 3>I love that idea.</v>

871
00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:00.890
<v Speaker 3>I really think it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The stone for the human mind.</v>

872
00:34:00.891 --> 00:34:02.780
<v Speaker 3>I think it's possible because I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

873
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:03.621
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new,</v>

874
00:34:03.621 --> 00:34:05.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

875
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:05.953
<v Speaker 3>Google Pixel has ear buds and these </v>
<v Speaker 3>earbuds translate languages in real </v>

876
00:34:10.311 --> 00:34:12.320
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

877
00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.050
<v Speaker 3>So if you're in another country and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating,</v>

878
00:34:15.051 --> 00:34:17.630
<v Speaker 3>fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and someone's talking in Spanish,</v>

879
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:18.583
<v Speaker 3>you will hear the translation in English</v>
<v Speaker 3>in real time and you'll be able to </v>

880
00:34:21.231 --> 00:34:24.080
<v Speaker 3>understand what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what Esperanto was supposed to</v>

881
00:34:24.081 --> 00:34:25.470
<v Speaker 3>be once upon a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

882
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.313
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be the common language and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we would all learn it and because we </v>

883
00:34:28.341 --> 00:34:29.174
<v Speaker 3>would speak it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be no more wars and no more </v>

884
00:34:30.681 --> 00:34:31.700
<v Speaker 3>awful things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They thought,</v>

885
00:34:31.701 --> 00:34:32.570
<v Speaker 3>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a,</v>

886
00:34:32.571 --> 00:34:35.030
<v Speaker 3>the digital Esperanto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgot about that.</v>

887
00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:36.080
<v Speaker 3>Well that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

888
00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:37.483
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Esperanza has been around for longer </v>

889
00:34:38.811 --> 00:34:39.644
<v Speaker 3>than this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean the big push came after the </v>

890
00:34:40.761 --> 00:34:41.594
<v Speaker 3>first world war was over and the League </v>
<v Speaker 3>of nations was formed and they were </v>

891
00:34:43.911 --> 00:34:46.340
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out how do we never </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a world war again?</v>

892
00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:48.080
<v Speaker 3>We'll have to understand each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all.</v>

893
00:34:48.081 --> 00:34:50.570
<v Speaker 3>And you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could understand all the speeches</v>

894
00:34:50.571 --> 00:34:52.640
<v Speaker 3>and all the demagogues and all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>other countries,</v>

895
00:34:52.641 --> 00:34:53.474
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

896
00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.070
<v Speaker 3>that's a giant issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

897
00:34:55.071 --> 00:34:57.350
<v Speaker 3>the Tower of Babel is based on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

898
00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:00.350
<v Speaker 3>And that that is a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't read Korean.</v>

899
00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:00.891
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

900
00:35:00.891 --> 00:35:03.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at Russian language and I'm like,</v>

901
00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:05.290
<v Speaker 3>does these cases are really craving?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

902
00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.553
<v Speaker 3>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all problem because the lack of </v>

903
00:35:09.291 --> 00:35:14.000
<v Speaker 3>communication is one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes it easier for us to look at people</v>

904
00:35:14.001 --> 00:35:15.410
<v Speaker 3>as the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

905
00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:16.371
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And listen,</v>

906
00:35:16.371 --> 00:35:17.204
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the common problem because when </v>

907
00:35:18.711 --> 00:35:19.900
<v Speaker 3>people look at these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

908
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.833
<v Speaker 3>regimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

909
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:21.703
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll take the standard one that you'd </v>

910
00:35:22.301 --> 00:35:23.134
<v Speaker 3>talk about the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a bazillion regimes like </v>

911
00:35:24.471 --> 00:35:25.304
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first thing you do is you have to </v>

912
00:35:26.241 --> 00:35:27.074
<v Speaker 3>dehumanize the people you want to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>after because obviously we have human </v>

913
00:35:29.931 --> 00:35:31.790
<v Speaker 3>feeling towards each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you can say something,</v>

914
00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:32.953
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is what's been most </v>
<v Speaker 3>depressing for me is that we seem to be </v>

915
00:35:35.841 --> 00:35:37.800
<v Speaker 3>backsliding on how we see people.</v>

916
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.720
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I mean this idea that,</v>

917
00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:40.861
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

918
00:35:40.861 --> 00:35:42.810
<v Speaker 5>one of the things I see all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the time,</v>

919
00:35:42.811 --> 00:35:45.780
<v Speaker 5>and I don't know where it comes from on </v>
<v Speaker 5>twitter and everywhere else is this idea</v>

920
00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:48.450
<v Speaker 5>that a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the different races are inferior to</v>

921
00:35:48.451 --> 00:35:51.360
<v Speaker 5>white folks because white folks built </v>
<v Speaker 5>all of this and therefore we must,</v>

922
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.220
<v Speaker 5>and you turn around and go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

923
00:35:53.221 --> 00:35:54.870
<v Speaker 5>one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how is that helpful too?</v>

924
00:35:54.871 --> 00:35:56.370
<v Speaker 5>Is that even true?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Three.</v>

925
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.970
<v Speaker 5>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I mean,</v>

926
00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.610
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so what part is where you just go,</v>

927
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:00.953
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you doing anybody any good with </v>

928
00:36:03.001 --> 00:36:03.541
<v Speaker 5>this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

929
00:36:03.541 --> 00:36:04.470
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are we at?</v>

930
00:36:04.471 --> 00:36:05.281
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and truthfully,</v>

931
00:36:05.281 --> 00:36:06.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't think most human beings think </v>
<v Speaker 5>like this.</v>

932
00:36:06.991 --> 00:36:09.150
<v Speaker 5>We're trying to make a living.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're trying to get by.</v>

933
00:36:09.151 --> 00:36:10.470
<v Speaker 5>We try to get a date.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're trying to,</v>

934
00:36:10.471 --> 00:36:10.771
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

935
00:36:10.771 --> 00:36:12.540
<v Speaker 5>there's a bazillion things you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do in this life.</v>

936
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.060
<v Speaker 5>The idea that you have to be responsible</v>
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>

937
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:16.163
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pushing back racism in America seems a </v>

938
00:36:17.521 --> 00:36:20.310
<v Speaker 5>heck of a lot of responsibility to put </v>
<v Speaker 5>on an average joe or Jane.</v>

939
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:21.303
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that these conversations are </v>

940
00:36:22.091 --> 00:36:22.924
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very important and I think we're having </v>

941
00:36:23.981 --> 00:36:24.814
<v Speaker 4>them more so than ever before and these </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversations show how ridiculous it is </v>

942
00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:30.213
<v Speaker 4>to have blind allegiance towards people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have the same amount of melanin as </v>

943
00:36:32.831 --> 00:36:35.080
<v Speaker 4>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so fucking stupid.</v>

944
00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.720
<v Speaker 4>All human beings essentially either came</v>
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

945
00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:40.630
<v Speaker 4>actually is some speculation that some </v>
<v Speaker 4>of them might have come from Europe,</v>

946
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:42.220
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years,</v>

947
00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:43.690
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ago as well.</v>

948
00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:46.480
<v Speaker 4>But we're talking about hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years ago.</v>

949
00:36:46.481 --> 00:36:49.030
<v Speaker 4>The very first homo sapiens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they believe came from Africa.</v>

950
00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:51.430
<v Speaker 4>Everybody migrated out of there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>moved wrong.</v>

951
00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.350
<v Speaker 4>We essentially came from the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>source.</v>

952
00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:54.303
<v Speaker 4>So all of this idea of race is just </v>
<v Speaker 4>based on a particular amount of time in </v>

953
00:36:58.751 --> 00:37:03.100
<v Speaker 4>a particular climate that forced people </v>
<v Speaker 4>to adapt to that climate.</v>

954
00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:05.500
<v Speaker 4>And the colder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>darker climates,</v>

955
00:37:05.501 --> 00:37:09.100
<v Speaker 4>you see Paler skin in the Sunnier hotter</v>
<v Speaker 4>climates.</v>

956
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.023
<v Speaker 4>You see more Melanin in the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 4>these people that live with have more </v>

957
00:37:14.261 --> 00:37:16.900
<v Speaker 4>pale skin are superior than the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have more.</v>

958
00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:20.200
<v Speaker 4>Melanin is just patently stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

959
00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:21.123
<v Speaker 4>it's a dumb idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you take into account all the socio </v>

960
00:37:24.341 --> 00:37:25.174
<v Speaker 4>economic factors that cause people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>live certain ways as people that are </v>

961
00:37:29.741 --> 00:37:32.740
<v Speaker 4>isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that live in certain tribal traditions,</v>

962
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:35.530
<v Speaker 4>that these things are all easily </v>
<v Speaker 4>explained.</v>

963
00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.513
<v Speaker 4>And if you want to chalk it off to </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence or the superiority of the </v>

964
00:37:39.311 --> 00:37:43.000
<v Speaker 4>white race in 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a fucking moron.</v>

965
00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.330
<v Speaker 4>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

966
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.020
<v Speaker 4>it's a good thing that we can have these</v>
<v Speaker 4>conversations.</v>

967
00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:47.973
<v Speaker 4>So you can expose these all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>Charlottesville people that you see </v>

968
00:37:51.221 --> 00:37:54.730
<v Speaker 4>walking around with fucking swastika </v>
<v Speaker 4>tattoos like Jesus Christ.</v>

969
00:37:54.731 --> 00:37:57.430
<v Speaker 4>You fucking dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those people that were involved in that,</v>

970
00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:01.060
<v Speaker 4>those riots and all that racial bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 4>that just went on.</v>

971
00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.313
<v Speaker 4>These people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they need to see the reaction that the </v>

972
00:38:05.531 --> 00:38:06.364
<v Speaker 4>rest of the world has and they are </v>
<v Speaker 4>isolated and insulated in their weird </v>

973
00:38:08.831 --> 00:38:12.250
<v Speaker 4>little worlds and when they go global </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that shit and they march with those</v>

974
00:38:12.251 --> 00:38:13.084
<v Speaker 4>Tiki torches down this tree and people </v>
<v Speaker 4>mock them and talk shit about them </v>

975
00:38:16.331 --> 00:38:17.164
<v Speaker 4>openly online,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get to understand how the rest of </v>

976
00:38:19.091 --> 00:38:23.230
<v Speaker 4>the world sees this ridiculous ideology </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they subscribed to.</v>

977
00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.213
<v Speaker 4>This is the power of of free expression </v>
<v Speaker 4>and communication that we're </v>

978
00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.113
<v Speaker 4>experiencing in 2017 and this is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>power to nip a lot of this shit in the </v>

979
00:38:31.841 --> 00:38:32.674
<v Speaker 4>bud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we can get past this tribal that </v>

980
00:38:36.371 --> 00:38:39.220
<v Speaker 4>we're all taking part of this truck </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're doing,</v>

981
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:42.700
<v Speaker 4>there's tribal nonsense that's male </v>
<v Speaker 4>versus female.</v>

982
00:38:42.701 --> 00:38:44.950
<v Speaker 4>There's tribal nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's white versus black,</v>

983
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:48.340
<v Speaker 4>but there's tribal nonsense that's left </v>
<v Speaker 4>versus right.</v>

984
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:53.550
<v Speaker 4>There's nationalism does all this tribal</v>
<v Speaker 4>stupidity and all of this stuff is,</v>

985
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:54.783
<v Speaker 4>is being debated and exposed and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening in real time and to you and I </v>

986
00:38:58.841 --> 00:39:02.260
<v Speaker 4>can't happen quick enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's still still too goddamn slow.</v>

987
00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:05.260
<v Speaker 4>It's still too frustrating to the idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's still around.</v>

988
00:39:05.261 --> 00:39:07.750
<v Speaker 4>It's still mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This kind of racism,</v>

989
00:39:07.751 --> 00:39:08.584
<v Speaker 4>this open,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blatant racism still exists in 2017 but </v>

990
00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:15.250
<v Speaker 4>it's way less prevalent than it was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand years ago.</v>

991
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:19.030
<v Speaker 4>It's way less accepted than it was 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

992
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.120
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's a blip in time as you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

993
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.310
<v Speaker 4>probably better than anybody that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>

994
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:25.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

995
00:39:25.841 --> 00:39:30.430
<v Speaker 5>it's funny because there's a part of me </v>
<v Speaker 5>that thinks that there must be something</v>

996
00:39:30.431 --> 00:39:31.264
<v Speaker 5>deeply embedded in the DNA or our code </v>
<v Speaker 5>or whatever that that because it's </v>

997
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:41.620
<v Speaker 5>either that or people run into this </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff and it appeals to them.</v>

998
00:39:41.621 --> 00:39:42.660
<v Speaker 5>So let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

999
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.490
<v Speaker 5>the first time you ever hear a speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and look,</v>

1000
00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:45.940
<v Speaker 5>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me draw a distinction.</v>

1001
00:39:45.941 --> 00:39:46.774
<v Speaker 5>Because when we took,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm one of those people that actually </v>

1002
00:39:48.251 --> 00:39:49.450
<v Speaker 5>buys into the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1003
00:39:49.451 --> 00:39:50.284
<v Speaker 5>I'd love to get to a place where we </v>
<v Speaker 5>judge people by the content of their </v>

1004
00:39:52.211 --> 00:39:54.070
<v Speaker 5>character,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not the color of their skin,</v>

1005
00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:58.240
<v Speaker 5>but let's not pretend that it's only the</v>
<v Speaker 5>white supremacist types that do that.</v>

1006
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:59.103
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we are so hung up on race that if you </v>

1007
00:40:00.911 --> 00:40:02.700
<v Speaker 5>could say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1008
00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.580
<v Speaker 5>in 15 years we are going to be a society</v>
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't even notice race.</v>

1009
00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:07.413
<v Speaker 5>Well in 1968 folks like Martin Luther </v>
<v Speaker 5>King might have thought that that was a </v>

1010
00:40:10.451 --> 00:40:12.130
<v Speaker 5>great thing today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people would be like,</v>

1011
00:40:12.131 --> 00:40:12.491
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

1012
00:40:12.491 --> 00:40:12.790
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

1013
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:13.031
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

1014
00:40:13.031 --> 00:40:15.730
<v Speaker 5>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We should still be noticing race for all</v>

1015
00:40:15.731 --> 00:40:15.971
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1016
00:40:15.971 --> 00:40:17.050
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these people need help.</v>

1017
00:40:17.051 --> 00:40:18.430
<v Speaker 5>Or the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess what I'm saying is,</v>

1018
00:40:18.431 --> 00:40:20.620
<v Speaker 5>is that there's a pendulum and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm,</v>

1019
00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:23.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking at this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like we're right in the middle of</v>

1020
00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.360
<v Speaker 5>this right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's so hard to analyze it.</v>

1021
00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.160
<v Speaker 5>So everybody take this with a grain of </v>
<v Speaker 5>salt,</v>

1022
00:40:27.161 --> 00:40:27.791
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

1023
00:40:27.791 --> 00:40:30.520
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if there's not a pendulum </v>
<v Speaker 5>involved.</v>

1024
00:40:30.521 --> 00:40:33.520
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tend to buy into most of the theories,</v>

1025
00:40:33.521 --> 00:40:34.354
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about racism that have always been put </v>

1026
00:40:35.861 --> 00:40:36.694
<v Speaker 5>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think some are less helpful than </v>

1027
00:40:38.921 --> 00:40:39.754
<v Speaker 5>others.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think they all give you an </v>

1028
00:40:41.231 --> 00:40:42.064
<v Speaker 5>example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think they come from academia </v>

1029
00:40:43.451 --> 00:40:45.700
<v Speaker 5>because I think this is sort of what </v>
<v Speaker 5>academics do.</v>

1030
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:47.080
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think that that's their job,</v>

1031
00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:48.860
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of times they'll come up with </v>
<v Speaker 5>theories.</v>

1032
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:51.970
<v Speaker 5>So one of the ones that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that drives me crazy is white privilege.</v>

1033
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.983
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>White privilege is true in the sense </v>

1034
00:40:55.451 --> 00:40:56.190
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1035
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:57.023
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like one African American guy said to </v>

1036
00:40:58.121 --> 00:40:58.451
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>

1037
00:40:58.451 --> 00:41:00.940
<v Speaker 5>I would love to forget about race,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but white people won't let me.</v>

1038
00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:01.803
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which is an,</v>

1039
00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:04.480
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every morning I wake up and reminded,</v>

1040
00:41:04.481 --> 00:41:06.640
<v Speaker 5>and you don't have to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get that.</v>

1041
00:41:06.641 --> 00:41:08.370
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I approve and I understand it,</v>

1042
00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:09.693
<v Speaker 5>but here's my problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to be able to see how telling </v>

1043
00:41:13.061 --> 00:41:13.894
<v Speaker 5>somebody that you were born with </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that you didn't earn is going </v>

1044
00:41:16.931 --> 00:41:19.900
<v Speaker 5>to be received on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1045
00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:20.943
<v Speaker 5>There are some people that have become </v>
<v Speaker 5>these white supremacists types or or </v>

1046
00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:28.600
<v Speaker 5>anti racial group because they're so </v>
<v Speaker 5>upset about their perceived position.</v>

1047
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.640
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like somehow you're blaming me for stuff</v>

1048
00:41:30.641 --> 00:41:32.680
<v Speaker 5>that happened to now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>True or not.</v>

1049
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:33.543
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I always tell people is it doesn't </v>

1050
00:41:34.731 --> 00:41:35.564
<v Speaker 5>matter what's true or not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It matters how that person reacts and </v>

1051
00:41:38.091 --> 00:41:40.070
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're explaining to them that,</v>

1052
00:41:40.071 --> 00:41:40.904
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you born with all these unearned </v>

1053
00:41:41.931 --> 00:41:44.750
<v Speaker 5>privileges and their reaction is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm starving here.</v>

1054
00:41:44.751 --> 00:41:46.830
<v Speaker 5>I don't have a job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm living in a crappy,</v>

1055
00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.940
<v Speaker 5>how can you tell me that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then it might prompt,</v>

1056
00:41:49.941 --> 00:41:52.820
<v Speaker 5>and again I'm analyzing from within the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Maelstrom that we're in now,</v>

1057
00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:53.923
<v Speaker 5>but that that might be a reaction </v>
<v Speaker 5>counter reaction thing to say that we </v>

1058
00:41:56.871 --> 00:41:57.704
<v Speaker 5>could have a society where you judge </v>
<v Speaker 5>people on the content of their </v>

1059
00:41:59.601 --> 00:42:01.010
<v Speaker 5>character,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not the color of their skin.</v>

1060
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.143
<v Speaker 5>That might be as upsetting for an </v>
<v Speaker 5>African American activist as a white </v>

1061
00:42:06.051 --> 00:42:06.884
<v Speaker 5>supremacist because this society right </v>
<v Speaker 5>now pays really close attention to your </v>

1062
00:42:11.121 --> 00:42:12.740
<v Speaker 5>race for all kinds of reasons.</v>

1063
00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:13.873
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm one of those people that believes </v>

1064
00:42:14.631 --> 00:42:17.690
<v Speaker 5>we're all going to be a nice 10 color </v>
<v Speaker 5>someday,</v>

1065
00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:20.120
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it's a moot point.</v>

1066
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.030
<v Speaker 5>But there are people out there who </v>
<v Speaker 5>literally think it's life or death.</v>

1067
00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.550
<v Speaker 5>If we do become a Tan people at one </v>
<v Speaker 5>point,</v>

1068
00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.390
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have to preserve this race or this.</v>

1069
00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.920
<v Speaker 5>I don't get any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>None of that makes sense.</v>

1070
00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:31.510
<v Speaker 5>That seems foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>

1071
00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.353
<v Speaker 5>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's consistent with the way human </v>

1072
00:42:35.931 --> 00:42:38.840
<v Speaker 5>beings evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trying to listen to the perfect,</v>

1073
00:42:38.841 --> 00:42:41.240
<v Speaker 5>her short lived in these small groups of</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1074
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:42.463
<v Speaker 5>We looked like each other and when we </v>
<v Speaker 5>saw these blond hair dudes pull up in </v>

1075
00:42:46.341 --> 00:42:48.560
<v Speaker 5>boats with battle ax as you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh shit,</v>

1076
00:42:48.561 --> 00:42:49.850
<v Speaker 5>they don't even look like us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck,</v>

1077
00:42:49.851 --> 00:42:50.684
<v Speaker 5>we gotta get Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's literally what you had to worry </v>

1078
00:42:52.851 --> 00:42:53.391
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1079
00:42:53.391 --> 00:42:55.310
<v Speaker 5>you had to worry about someone who was </v>
<v Speaker 5>the other.</v>

1080
00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:56.300
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>

1081
00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.133
<v Speaker 5>we forget in this time and place that </v>
<v Speaker 5>the other didn't happen to be a skin </v>

1082
00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.830
<v Speaker 5>color thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you could be the shark,</v>

1083
00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:03.673
<v Speaker 5>the Carolingian Empire that's being </v>
<v Speaker 5>attacked by the Vike Vikings and to an </v>

1084
00:43:06.711 --> 00:43:07.544
<v Speaker 5>outside observer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you all look like a bunch of blonde </v>

1085
00:43:09.231 --> 00:43:10.064
<v Speaker 5>haired blue eyed guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But to them the vikings are the other </v>

1086
00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:13.813
<v Speaker 5>and in a tribal sense there is inferior </v>
<v Speaker 5>and awful and barbaric as anything you </v>

1087
00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:17.894
<v Speaker 5>can think of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we make the distinction now based on </v>

1088
00:43:19.941 --> 00:43:23.150
<v Speaker 5>this or that visual thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But throughout history,</v>

1089
00:43:23.151 --> 00:43:23.984
<v Speaker 5>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you could go to China and they </v>

1090
00:43:25.461 --> 00:43:28.970
<v Speaker 5>have all sorts of different peoples in </v>
<v Speaker 5>China that they recognize as the other,</v>

1091
00:43:28.971 --> 00:43:31.340
<v Speaker 5>but if you're looking at them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they all looked Chinese to you.</v>

1092
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:32.990
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's a perfect example where we have a</v>

1093
00:43:32.991 --> 00:43:33.824
<v Speaker 5>blind spot of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this was in Iraq when we took over and </v>

1094
00:43:38.301 --> 00:43:39.134
<v Speaker 5>killed Saddam Hussein and overthrew him </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then the Sunni's and the Shias went </v>

1095
00:43:42.501 --> 00:43:44.830
<v Speaker 5>into a full scale and the Kurds and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>current,</v>

1096
00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:45.681
<v Speaker 5>everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

1097
00:43:45.681 --> 00:43:47.510
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is going on?</v>

1098
00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:52.720
<v Speaker 5>I thought you guys were all Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So many people had no idea there was two</v>

1099
00:43:53.241 --> 00:43:56.750
<v Speaker 5>competing sects of Muslims that lived in</v>
<v Speaker 5>that area.</v>

1100
00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.530
<v Speaker 5>They have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was no struggle.</v>

1101
00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:02.030
<v Speaker 5>We may be talking about the population </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a whole but but come on,</v>

1102
00:44:02.031 --> 00:44:04.130
<v Speaker 5>the people in the government understood </v>
<v Speaker 5>this really well.</v>

1103
00:44:04.131 --> 00:44:04.964
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is why the first George Bush</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't want to go in and and to topple </v>

1104
00:44:08.061 --> 00:44:08.894
<v Speaker 5>Saddam Hussein directly the way the </v>
<v Speaker 5>second Gulf War did because he didn't </v>

1105
00:44:11.301 --> 00:44:12.134
<v Speaker 5>want to own that mass and we knew that </v>
<v Speaker 5>those groups were there because we were </v>

1106
00:44:15.231 --> 00:44:17.870
<v Speaker 5>encouraging them and funding them to </v>
<v Speaker 5>overthrow.</v>

1107
00:44:17.871 --> 00:44:18.704
<v Speaker 5>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a big Sunni Shiite rebellion </v>

1108
00:44:20.571 --> 00:44:23.030
<v Speaker 5>against Saddam at one point after the </v>
<v Speaker 5>first Gulf War,</v>

1109
00:44:23.031 --> 00:44:26.930
<v Speaker 5>which we were funding and hoping for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Kurds have been for a long time.</v>

1110
00:44:26.931 --> 00:44:29.420
<v Speaker 5>Our friends and we've been pushing for </v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

1111
00:44:29.421 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 5>They're less than a state,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but more than what</v>

1112
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.800
<v Speaker 3>they had under Saddam cause the Turks </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't love him and not well,</v>

1113
00:44:34.801 --> 00:44:35.634
<v Speaker 3>whenever you overthrow a dictator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you leave a power vacuum and that power </v>

1114
00:44:39.661 --> 00:44:43.410
<v Speaker 3>vacuum is never filled in a nice and </v>
<v Speaker 3>calm and democratic way.</v>

1115
00:44:43.411 --> 00:44:44.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look what's going on in Libya.</v>

1116
00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:48.640
<v Speaker 3>Libya is now a failed state and it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1117
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:51.690
<v Speaker 3>like a breeding ground for Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's be,</v>

1118
00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:52.533
<v Speaker 3>the reason why is because you had this </v>
<v Speaker 3>tie radical dictator and we had him </v>

1119
00:44:57.361 --> 00:44:58.950
<v Speaker 3>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had Kadafi killed,</v>

1120
00:44:59.100 --> 00:44:59.933
<v Speaker 3>which is another great piece of evidence</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to point to with people with </v>

1121
00:45:02.971 --> 00:45:04.050
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1122
00:45:04.051 --> 00:45:07.170
<v Speaker 3>watch the interview where she is about </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be interviewed.</v>

1123
00:45:07.171 --> 00:45:08.550
<v Speaker 3>She's still on camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

1124
00:45:08.551 --> 00:45:09.384
<v Speaker 3>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not any of you hasn't officially </v>

1125
00:45:10.651 --> 00:45:13.800
<v Speaker 3>started and she's talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>death of Kadafi and she's laughing.</v>

1126
00:45:13.801 --> 00:45:15.360
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we came,</v>

1127
00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.980
<v Speaker 3>we saw he died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1128
00:45:16.981 --> 00:45:17.570
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

1129
00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:19.020
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's laughing.</v>

1130
00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:20.003
<v Speaker 3>This is not the kind of cavalier mindset</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ever want to see in someone that </v>

1131
00:45:24.661 --> 00:45:28.800
<v Speaker 3>possesses the power to overthrow a </v>
<v Speaker 3>government and someone who possesses the</v>

1132
00:45:28.801 --> 00:45:33.390
<v Speaker 3>power to wield nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a person who's a chicken hawk.</v>

1133
00:45:33.391 --> 00:45:34.224
<v Speaker 3>You're completely shielded from the idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>of actually engaging in v actual </v>

1134
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:40.350
<v Speaker 3>visceral combat yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

1135
00:45:40.351 --> 00:45:43.890
<v Speaker 3>you're outside in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in flying around in jets,</v>

1136
00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:44.873
<v Speaker 3>having catered food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in war rooms making decisions </v>

1137
00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:49.740
<v Speaker 3>while you're an air conditioned </v>
<v Speaker 3>buildings.</v>

1138
00:45:49.741 --> 00:45:52.740
<v Speaker 3>It's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these,</v>

1139
00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:57.750
<v Speaker 3>these decisions that you make have </v>
<v Speaker 3>massive repercussions for decades,</v>

1140
00:45:57.751 --> 00:45:59.240
<v Speaker 3>if not centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>centuries.</v>

1141
00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:00.623
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing that you talked about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think is incredibly important in </v>

1142
00:46:02.521 --> 00:46:06.390
<v Speaker 3>the wrath of the cons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When gingiss con took over Baghdad,</v>

1143
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.553
<v Speaker 3>Baghdad essentially was knocked into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking stone age and might not have </v>

1144
00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:12.780
<v Speaker 3>ever recovered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

1145
00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:13.793
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] he just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Mongols destroyed the irrigation </v>

1146
00:46:16.681 --> 00:46:17.514
<v Speaker 3>system that had been around from time in</v>
<v Speaker 3>memorial and wood and how complicated </v>

1147
00:46:22.111 --> 00:46:22.944
<v Speaker 3>and and advanced their civilization was </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time when the Mongols showed up </v>

1148
00:46:26.341 --> 00:46:28.680
<v Speaker 3>and did all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how few people knew this.</v>

1149
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:29.700
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1150
00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:30.563
<v Speaker 3>the question of asking about dictators </v>
<v Speaker 3>is really important because I think </v>

1151
00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:34.824
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you have to ask how much of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that the country is held </v>

1152
00:46:38.071 --> 00:46:40.440
<v Speaker 3>together is only because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dictator.</v>

1153
00:46:40.441 --> 00:46:43.230
<v Speaker 3>So we'll use the Yugoslavia example </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause it's pretty classic.</v>

1154
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:44.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for those who don't know,</v>

1155
00:46:44.731 --> 00:46:45.564
<v Speaker 3>Yugoslavia is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a country made up of a bunch of </v>

1156
00:46:47.311 --> 00:46:51.270
<v Speaker 3>different independent countries now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't necessarily get along.</v>

1157
00:46:51.271 --> 00:46:52.104
<v Speaker 3>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's some of the oldest ethnic hatreds </v>

1158
00:46:54.421 --> 00:46:57.540
<v Speaker 3>in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you talk about Serbs and Croats and</v>

1159
00:46:57.541 --> 00:46:58.374
<v Speaker 3>coastal vars and Bosnian Muslims and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Albanians and all the people in that </v>

1160
00:47:00.931 --> 00:47:05.600
<v Speaker 3>area there historically at odds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but under certain governments,</v>

1161
00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:06.650
<v Speaker 3>a Tito,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1162
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:07.503
<v Speaker 3>after the second world war formed a </v>
<v Speaker 3>government where he essentially ruled </v>

1163
00:47:10.201 --> 00:47:12.720
<v Speaker 3>with an iron fist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's how you kept all these people</v>

1164
00:47:12.721 --> 00:47:13.554
<v Speaker 3>from killing each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you say Iraq is not even a real </v>

1165
00:47:16.351 --> 00:47:17.184
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you didn't have an iron fist </v>

1166
00:47:19.001 --> 00:47:21.870
<v Speaker 3>to dictator holding it together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't be together.</v>

1167
00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:22.943
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then when you take the one lynch pin </v>

1168
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:28.380
<v Speaker 3>as awful and Saddam Hussein was awful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>awful,</v>

1169
00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:29.830
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you a book read that will </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

1170
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.050
<v Speaker 5>you'll have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the only book I've ever read that I</v>

1171
00:47:32.051 --> 00:47:32.884
<v Speaker 5>had to read another book afterwards </v>
<v Speaker 5>before I went to bed at night cause it </v>

1172
00:47:34.961 --> 00:47:36.230
<v Speaker 5>was so horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1173
00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:38.010
<v Speaker 5>He's evil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

1174
00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:41.140
<v Speaker 5>it's called the great war for </v>
<v Speaker 5>civilization by Robert Fisk.</v>

1175
00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:42.243
<v Speaker 5>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's in reporter on the scene and he </v>

1176
00:47:43.331 --> 00:47:44.164
<v Speaker 5>would tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is scrawled on the walls and the </v>

1177
00:47:46.931 --> 00:47:49.240
<v Speaker 5>prisons that Saddam Hussein's prisons at</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1178
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:51.040
<v Speaker 5>the prisoners would write in their own </v>
<v Speaker 5>bloody,</v>

1179
00:47:51.041 --> 00:47:52.780
<v Speaker 5>it's horrible stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the point is,</v>

1180
00:47:52.781 --> 00:47:54.640
<v Speaker 5>is that if there hadn't been a regime </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>

1181
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:57.880
<v Speaker 5>would you have even had in Iraq?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you say to yourself,</v>

1182
00:47:57.881 --> 00:47:59.340
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy is the only reason this country</v>

1183
00:47:59.341 --> 00:48:02.530
<v Speaker 5>is held together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if you pull out that linchpin,</v>

1184
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:03.311
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he'd say,</v>

1185
00:48:03.311 --> 00:48:04.780
<v Speaker 5>he's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1186
00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:06.670
<v Speaker 5>But if you could look into the crystal </v>
<v Speaker 5>ball and find out,</v>

1187
00:48:06.671 --> 00:48:08.530
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're going to lose a million people</v>

1188
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:10.480
<v Speaker 5>in warfare between all these people.</v>

1189
00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.030
<v Speaker 5>If you pull the Saddam Hussein character</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of there too quickly,</v>

1190
00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:15.610
<v Speaker 5>it's like a giant Jenga game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you put in the wrong piece,</v>

1191
00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.230
<v Speaker 5>and that's what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1192
00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:20.050
<v Speaker 5>And it's still happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's still happening.</v>

1193
00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:22.030
<v Speaker 5>Listen to Iran is the next,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1194
00:48:22.031 --> 00:48:22.864
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're really gunning for lack of a </v>

1195
00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:25.800
<v Speaker 5>better word for Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1196
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:29.020
<v Speaker 5>and you can see it if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you know how to read the news and you</v>

1197
00:48:29.021 --> 00:48:32.800
<v Speaker 5>connect this dot with that dot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't provide a clear picture,</v>

1198
00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:35.350
<v Speaker 5>but he say they demean the United States</v>
<v Speaker 5>military,</v>

1199
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:37.450
<v Speaker 5>the United States government and our </v>
<v Speaker 5>friends.</v>

1200
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:41.320
<v Speaker 5>And why are they gunning after Iran?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Iran has been on our,</v>

1201
00:48:41.321 --> 00:48:43.140
<v Speaker 5>on our net.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Naughty boy listens.</v>

1202
00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:46.570
<v Speaker 5>1979 they used to be our best friend in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the region,</v>

1203
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:47.463
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even even better than Israel early on </v>

1204
00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:53.020
<v Speaker 5>because the Israeli relationship really </v>
<v Speaker 5>got tight after like 73,</v>

1205
00:48:53.021 --> 00:48:56.830
<v Speaker 5>74 but Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we overthrew a government there with the</v>

1206
00:48:56.831 --> 00:48:57.580
<v Speaker 5>British.</v>

1207
00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:58.413
<v Speaker 5>Kermit Roosevelt was one of the people </v>
<v Speaker 5>involved in that and overthrew a </v>

1208
00:49:01.031 --> 00:49:04.300
<v Speaker 5>democratically elected regime under Dr </v>
<v Speaker 5>Mohammed Moza Deck,</v>

1209
00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:06.520
<v Speaker 5>put the shaw back in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>power his son.</v>

1210
00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.800
<v Speaker 5>And that became our little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1211
00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:10.450
<v Speaker 5>we had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you look at geopolitics,</v>

1212
00:49:10.451 --> 00:49:12.490
<v Speaker 5>it's all sort of like playing a risk </v>
<v Speaker 5>game,</v>

1213
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:13.503
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you want to have a little territory </v>

1214
00:49:14.801 --> 00:49:16.240
<v Speaker 5>on this side of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the,</v>

1215
00:49:16.241 --> 00:49:18.670
<v Speaker 5>of the continent and then another one on</v>
<v Speaker 5>this side and that places.</v>

1216
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:21.730
<v Speaker 5>So if you have Turkey as a friend and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a Israel as a friend,</v>

1217
00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:23.980
<v Speaker 5>then on the other side you have Iran as </v>
<v Speaker 5>a friend.</v>

1218
00:49:23.981 --> 00:49:26.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we had this whole area sussed for awhile</v>

1219
00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:27.453
<v Speaker 5>and the 1979 revolution screwed </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything up and you could make a </v>

1220
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.863
<v Speaker 5>decent case that it's since 1979 that </v>
<v Speaker 5>all this crap that we're dealing with </v>

1221
00:49:35.741 --> 00:49:36.574
<v Speaker 5>today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>including modern terrorism directed at </v>

1222
00:49:38.951 --> 00:49:40.840
<v Speaker 5>us stems from all that.</v>

1223
00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the domino that begins tumbling,</v>

1224
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:43.833
<v Speaker 5>that explains a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>including the 82 83 Lebanon involvement </v>

1225
00:49:46.331 --> 00:49:47.860
<v Speaker 5>and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1226
00:49:47.861 --> 00:49:48.694
<v Speaker 5>It just seems like such a colobus mess </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you look at all the potential </v>

1227
00:49:51.881 --> 00:49:54.240
<v Speaker 5>pieces that are in place that could </v>
<v Speaker 5>cause chaos.</v>

1228
00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.110
<v Speaker 5>It's money though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

1229
00:49:56.111 --> 00:49:58.360
<v Speaker 5>It's money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's so much.</v>

1230
00:49:58.750 --> 00:49:59.690
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went to it,</v>

1231
00:49:59.691 --> 00:50:02.140
<v Speaker 5>I've said this before and it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>violation probably of my,</v>

1232
00:50:02.141 --> 00:50:03.310
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of what I said I would do.</v>

1233
00:50:03.311 --> 00:50:04.990
<v Speaker 5>But I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went to a Centcom meeting,</v>

1234
00:50:04.991 --> 00:50:06.900
<v Speaker 5>I was invited to this weird symptom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1235
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:07.833
<v Speaker 5>US Central Command.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought I'll tell you the story of </v>

1236
00:50:09.791 --> 00:50:10.624
<v Speaker 5>what time cause it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought they were going to kill me </v>

1237
00:50:11.231 --> 00:50:12.760
<v Speaker 5>that there was an assassination attempt </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1238
00:50:12.761 --> 00:50:15.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a conspiracy nut,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the whole story was really funny.</v>

1239
00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:16.173
<v Speaker 5>But long story short,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ended up at this Central Command </v>

1240
00:50:18.671 --> 00:50:20.530
<v Speaker 5>planning meeting with 11 guys.</v>

1241
00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:21.513
<v Speaker 5>It's me and 11 other guys and generals </v>
<v Speaker 5>mean it was chaired by the guy who is </v>

1242
00:50:24.651 --> 00:50:27.100
<v Speaker 5>the defense secretary now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Madis um,</v>

1243
00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:29.900
<v Speaker 5>so we sat there and they started talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>about half of it was,</v>

1244
00:50:29.901 --> 00:50:30.734
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you think we ought to do about </v>

1245
00:50:31.281 --> 00:50:32.360
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that or the other thing.</v>

1246
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:35.930
<v Speaker 5>And the second half blew my mind because</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole second half of the meeting was</v>

1247
00:50:35.931 --> 00:50:38.510
<v Speaker 5>about procurement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not procurement.</v>

1248
00:50:38.511 --> 00:50:40.940
<v Speaker 5>Sounds boring when it basically means is</v>
<v Speaker 5>buying stuff,</v>

1249
00:50:40.941 --> 00:50:41.774
<v Speaker 5>military stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the meeting was kind of about how </v>

1250
00:50:44.031 --> 00:50:44.864
<v Speaker 5>important it was that that countries </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't start shifting over from say our </v>

1251
00:50:49.791 --> 00:50:50.624
<v Speaker 5>tanks to another country's tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it wasn't because we wanted to sell </v>

1252
00:50:53.541 --> 00:50:54.374
<v Speaker 5>them tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was because we wanted to sell them </v>

1253
00:50:55.731 --> 00:50:58.670
<v Speaker 5>spare parts for the tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the old printer model,</v>

1254
00:50:58.671 --> 00:50:59.361
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1255
00:50:59.361 --> 00:51:00.770
<v Speaker 5>we'll give you the foreign aid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1256
00:51:00.771 --> 00:51:01.340
<v Speaker 5>We'll give you a lot.</v>

1257
00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:03.200
<v Speaker 5>We're going to defend you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll send all this stuff free.</v>

1258
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:04.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then who do you have to call for the</v>

1259
00:51:04.761 --> 00:51:06.110
<v Speaker 5>spare parts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1260
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:08.750
<v Speaker 5>If you're using US jets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1261
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:10.970
<v Speaker 5>who's making the parts for those that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's selling them?</v>

1262
00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:13.610
<v Speaker 5>So when you sit there and realize how </v>
<v Speaker 5>much money is involved,</v>

1263
00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:16.100
<v Speaker 5>you're doubling down in a place like the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Middle East,</v>

1264
00:51:16.101 --> 00:51:17.750
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're doubling down because one,</v>

1265
00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:20.180
<v Speaker 5>you want to get the oil or you want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>have,</v>

1266
00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.880
<v Speaker 5>you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to negate what's called,</v>

1267
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:26.090
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>used to be called petro extortion.</v>

1268
00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.760
<v Speaker 5>Petro Black Male.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because in the 70s,</v>

1269
00:51:28.761 --> 00:51:30.170
<v Speaker 5>and you and I are old enough to remember</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1270
00:51:30.171 --> 00:51:31.970
<v Speaker 5>when you had the long gas lines and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1271
00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:35.720
<v Speaker 5>when OPEC punished countries like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>United States for supporting Israel,</v>

1272
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:38.390
<v Speaker 5>the first thing you realize when </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody can do that to you as,</v>

1273
00:51:38.391 --> 00:51:40.310
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>job number one has to be,</v>

1274
00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:42.080
<v Speaker 5>make sure no one can ever do that again.</v>

1275
00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:42.913
<v Speaker 5>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't control our foreign policy by </v>

1276
00:51:44.271 --> 00:51:46.280
<v Speaker 5>saying you'll cut off the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because if you do that,</v>

1277
00:51:46.281 --> 00:51:47.610
<v Speaker 5>we'll just come and take the oil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1278
00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:51.530
<v Speaker 5>We'll make sure you can't shut down the </v>
<v Speaker 5>western world because you don't like our</v>

1279
00:51:51.531 --> 00:51:52.760
<v Speaker 5>policies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1280
00:51:52.761 --> 00:51:54.380
<v Speaker 5>I understand that a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then you say,</v>

1281
00:51:54.381 --> 00:51:56.090
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not only are we in there for the oil,</v>

1282
00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.610
<v Speaker 5>but these countries that are our friends</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the region who help,</v>

1283
00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:04.940
<v Speaker 5>who helped keep open access to the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are places that should be using US</v>

1284
00:52:04.941 --> 00:52:06.830
<v Speaker 5>equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if they're using US equipment,</v>

1285
00:52:06.831 --> 00:52:08.360
<v Speaker 5>we can sell them us spare parts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're,</v>

1286
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:10.970
<v Speaker 5>you're not only keeping the oil access,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is important to us,</v>

1287
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:14.960
<v Speaker 5>but you're also keeping the one industry</v>
<v Speaker 5>in this country we still made make a ton</v>

1288
00:52:14.961 --> 00:52:15.794
<v Speaker 5>of money in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is we still sell great military </v>

1289
00:52:17.931 --> 00:52:21.770
<v Speaker 5>equipment and great military parts and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we send our advisers and our maintenance</v>

1290
00:52:21.771 --> 00:52:22.604
<v Speaker 5>crews in every place all over the world </v>
<v Speaker 5>to to keep that stuff in running </v>

1291
00:52:24.921 --> 00:52:25.754
<v Speaker 5>operation.</v>

1292
00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:28.490
<v Speaker 5>That's doubling down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you get the oil and you get the spare</v>

1293
00:52:28.491 --> 00:52:30.770
<v Speaker 5>parts that you give away to them to </v>
<v Speaker 5>protect the oil.</v>

1294
00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.900
<v Speaker 5>So you're in this meeting with these </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1295
00:52:32.901 --> 00:52:33.950
<v Speaker 5>How,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how'd you get,</v>

1296
00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:34.943
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I'll tell the story because it's a </v>

1297
00:52:35.481 --> 00:52:37.010
<v Speaker 5>fun story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it goes so,</v>

1298
00:52:37.011 --> 00:52:38.420
<v Speaker 5>so we get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know how it is,</v>

1299
00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:39.254
<v Speaker 5>we get emails,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we get an email one day and we get a </v>

1300
00:52:40.731 --> 00:52:41.564

<v Speaker 5>The letter looks like some of what were </v>

1308
00:52:51.921 --> 00:52:54.770
<v Speaker 5>It even goes deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to have a discussion board online</v>

1309
00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:55.903
<v Speaker 5>and some dude came on the discussion </v>

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:20.660
<v Speaker 5>It looked like my daughter did it on her</v>
<v Speaker 5>printer.</v>

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.033
<v Speaker 5>So I called the phone number and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't even ring once and a machine </v>

1329
00:53:34.381 --> 00:53:35.820
<v Speaker 5>picks it up and just leave a message at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the beep.</v>

1335
00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:50.010
<v Speaker 5>It's like some weird bad movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1336

1341

<v Speaker 5>just go to the airport when there's no </v>

1345
00:54:07.321 --> 00:54:08.670
<v Speaker 5>ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll know it's a scam.</v>

1346
00:54:08.671 --> 00:54:10.700
<v Speaker 5>So I go to the airport does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I get off the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no car.</v>

1352
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:21.780
<v Speaker 5>So I called my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

1353
00:54:21.781 --> 00:54:23.010
<v Speaker 5>there's no car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is all a scam.</v>

00:54:23.011 --> 00:54:26.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what this is a heck of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of trouble to go through to scam me.</v>

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:03.480
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

1372
00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:06.270
<v Speaker 5>I go up to the room,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I opened up this and it's all legit.</v>

1373
00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.860
<v Speaker 5>Long story short,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all,</v>

1374
00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:09.660
<v Speaker 5>and there's people at this meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not allowed to say,</v>

1375
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:12.420
<v Speaker 5>but there's people that if they sat next</v>
<v Speaker 5>to you would know exactly who they are.</v>

1376
00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:15.870
<v Speaker 5>And so I get to the meeting and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all like Pentagon milk,</v>

1377
00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:20.100
<v Speaker 5>everything's confiscated at the door and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get this military guy who walks with</v>

1378
00:55:20.101 --> 00:55:20.640
<v Speaker 5>you everywhere.</v>

1379
00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:21.473
<v Speaker 5>So if you have to go to the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this dude has to walk to the bathroom </v>

1380
00:55:22.861 --> 00:55:23.694
<v Speaker 5>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it's a table in this room and </v>

1381
00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:30.590
<v Speaker 5>madness is at the head of the table.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then a bunch of soldiers standing in</v>

1382
00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:33.240
<v Speaker 5>a circle around the table just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>standing there.</v>

1383
00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:34.163
<v Speaker 5>So you've got like a cordon of soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm sitting down there with all </v>

1384
00:55:36.661 --> 00:55:38.430
<v Speaker 5>these other people and I have no idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>why I'm there.</v>

1385
00:55:38.431 --> 00:55:39.264
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I opened up the packet and it's </v>

1386
00:55:39.601 --> 00:55:43.200
<v Speaker 5>everybody at the meeting and everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 5>got like three pages on their bio.</v>

1387
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:46.620
<v Speaker 5>This the honorable Dododododo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I opened it up and then there's</v>

1388
00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:48.840
<v Speaker 5>this little teeny piece of paper that </v>
<v Speaker 5>says Dan Carlin,</v>

1389
00:55:48.841 --> 00:55:51.570
<v Speaker 5>podcaster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they went to like Wikipedia,</v>

1390
00:55:51.571 --> 00:55:53.910
<v Speaker 5>which is all wrong anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and printed it.</v>

1391
00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:54.960
<v Speaker 5>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

1392
00:55:54.961 --> 00:55:55.794
<v Speaker 5>these August people at this meeting are </v>
<v Speaker 5>so excited to be at this meeting with </v>

1393
00:55:57.961 --> 00:55:59.250
<v Speaker 5>Dan Carlin podcaster.</v>

1394
00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:00.083
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the meeting goes on for awhile and </v>

1395
00:56:02.161 --> 00:56:03.900
<v Speaker 5>then it breaks up in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these people know each other,</v>

1396
00:56:03.901 --> 00:56:06.330
<v Speaker 5>so they go off in their little corners </v>
<v Speaker 5>to start talking during the lunch break.</v>

1397
00:56:06.331 --> 00:56:07.164
<v Speaker 5>I don't know anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sitting at this table by myself and </v>

1398
00:56:08.821 --> 00:56:11.910
<v Speaker 5>this officer comes up and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet you wonder why you're here.</v>

1399
00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:12.991
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1400
00:56:12.991 --> 00:56:14.040
<v Speaker 5>I really would love to know why I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

1401
00:56:14.041 --> 00:56:15.690
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's my fault.</v>

1402
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:16.583
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm the one.</v>

1403
00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:17.880
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we listened to the show.</v>

1404
00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:19.140
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're looking for out.</v>

1405
00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:20.003
<v Speaker 5>This was all about getting outside or </v>
<v Speaker 5>opinions on what you should do in the </v>

1406
00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:23.523
<v Speaker 5>Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he goes,</v>

1407
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:25.210
<v Speaker 5>it was my okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but here's the,</v>

1408
00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:26.073
<v Speaker 5>here's the other thing I was outside or </v>
<v Speaker 5>opinions on what you should do in the </v>

1409
00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:29.643
<v Speaker 5>Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's contact that guy does a history </v>

1410
00:56:30.641 --> 00:56:34.000
<v Speaker 5>pod,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's little fly him out to DC,</v>

1411
00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:35.800
<v Speaker 5>but here there's your tax dollars at </v>
<v Speaker 5>work.</v>

1412
00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:36.721
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

1413
00:56:36.721 --> 00:56:37.300
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1414
00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:38.133
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a little bit more sneaky than that </v>

1415
00:56:39.371 --> 00:56:41.650
<v Speaker 5>because I was there with a guy who knows</v>
<v Speaker 5>how this all runs,</v>

1416
00:56:41.651 --> 00:56:42.484
<v Speaker 5>another guest and we took the taxi cab </v>
<v Speaker 5>to this place together and he's a real </v>

1417
00:56:45.611 --> 00:56:46.510
<v Speaker 5>cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>

1418
00:56:46.511 --> 00:56:48.310
<v Speaker 5>let me tell you while you're here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is all a cover.</v>

1419
00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:49.510
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you mean it's a cover?</v>

1420
00:56:49.511 --> 00:56:50.344
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a cover because these guys are </v>

1421
00:56:51.671 --> 00:56:55.450
<v Speaker 5>required by law to solicit outside </v>
<v Speaker 5>opinions for some of this stuff.</v>

1422
00:56:55.451 --> 00:56:57.290
<v Speaker 5>So that's what we're here we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>get.</v>

1423
00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:59.930
<v Speaker 5>And what they're going to say is they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to do exactly what they were going</v>

1424
00:56:59.931 --> 00:57:00.764
<v Speaker 5>to do anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there'll be able to say we solicit </v>

1425
00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:04.420
<v Speaker 5>to the outside opinion from all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>different people.</v>

1426
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:08.890
<v Speaker 5>So I think that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>La Is it their radars?</v>

1427
00:57:08.891 --> 00:57:09.724
<v Speaker 5>Them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1428
00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:10.923
<v Speaker 5>But apparently they were supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>think outside the box and so they </v>

1429
00:57:12.581 --> 00:57:15.100
<v Speaker 5>invited and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't say mandated.</v>

1430
00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:16.810
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I was the real outlier.</v>

1431
00:57:16.811 --> 00:57:19.000
<v Speaker 5>All these other people made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was the guy that was like,</v>

1432
00:57:19.001 --> 00:57:19.834
<v Speaker 5>okay they really getting crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You wearing a suit or are you dressing </v>

1433
00:57:21.461 --> 00:57:22.294
<v Speaker 5>like that with a beach people wearing a </v>
<v Speaker 5>suit you wear was the last time I wore </v>

1434
00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:26.820
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1435
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:28.543
<v Speaker 5>it's funny cause they take this like </v>
<v Speaker 5>commemorative photo of you at the end </v>

1436
00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:32.770
<v Speaker 5>and then they say you can't show those </v>
<v Speaker 5>photos.</v>

1437
00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:33.980
<v Speaker 5>Anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why are you taking it?</v>

1438
00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:35.523
<v Speaker 5>So I could show my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you put it on the wall and your </v>

1439
00:57:36.911 --> 00:57:37.744
<v Speaker 5>house?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what's on the wall in my </v>

1440
00:57:38.291 --> 00:57:41.920
<v Speaker 5>house now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when you're standing there,</v>

1441
00:57:41.921 --> 00:57:43.640
<v Speaker 5>do you have like a badge on it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1442
00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:44.493
<v Speaker 5>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my name is Dan Carlin or it just says </v>

1443
00:57:45.581 --> 00:57:46.414
<v Speaker 5>Dan Carlin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then there's the dude who stands </v>

1444
00:57:47.741 --> 00:57:50.500
<v Speaker 5>behind you the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The military and say Dan Carlin.</v>

1445
00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:51.970
<v Speaker 5>Hardcore history.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does it say?</v>

1446
00:57:52.030 --> 00:57:52.721
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll show you.</v>

1447
00:57:52.721 --> 00:57:53.890
<v Speaker 5>It's on my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll show you later.</v>

1448
00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:54.960
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1449
00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:56.043
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was one of those get togethers </v>

1450
00:57:56.591 --> 00:57:57.424
<v Speaker 5>where you just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really wasn't as prepared as I should </v>

1451
00:57:59.551 --> 00:58:02.290
<v Speaker 5>have been because I was pretty darn sure</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing was a hoax,</v>

1452
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:03.610
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1453
00:58:03.611 --> 00:58:05.500
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to send me a letter,</v>

1454
00:58:05.501 --> 00:58:06.334
<v Speaker 5>could it look like a letter that the u s</v>
<v Speaker 5>does it have to look like something </v>

1455
00:58:08.411 --> 00:58:09.244
<v Speaker 5>where you printed the label on your </v>
<v Speaker 5>brother label maker printer or </v>

1456
00:58:12.341 --> 00:58:13.420
<v Speaker 5>something?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They always want to leave.</v>

1457
00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:14.283
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they have multiple filters to </v>
<v Speaker 5>leave in the possibility of plausible </v>

1458
00:58:16.781 --> 00:58:18.160
<v Speaker 5>deniability.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the German guy,</v>

1459
00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:20.200
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what turned out to be like a west German</v>

1460
00:58:20.201 --> 00:58:21.034
<v Speaker 5>general that was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was cooperating with the u s government </v>

1461
00:58:22.811 --> 00:58:25.870
<v Speaker 5>as part of an exchange program where we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I mean the whole thing seemed like,</v>

1462
00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:26.913
<v Speaker 5>I just thought it was this hacker dude </v>
<v Speaker 5>figuring out he's going to really </v>

1463

<v Speaker 5>might have been good for pr.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1484
00:59:12.881 --> 00:59:15.280
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they thought it shut me up with my</v>

1485
00:59:15.281 --> 00:59:16.120
<v Speaker 5>criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1486
00:59:16.121 --> 00:59:16.954
<v Speaker 5>Bring you on in the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're one of our buddies know now you </v>

1487
00:59:18.641 --> 00:59:19.474
<v Speaker 5>have to be quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember when Dennis Miller became with </v>

1488
00:59:21.381 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 5>George Bush</v>

1489
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:23.810
<v Speaker 3>and you wouldn't make jokes about George</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bush anymore.</v>

1490
00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.790
<v Speaker 3>He's my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I give him a pass.</v>

1491
00:59:25.791 --> 00:59:26.900
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1492
00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.760
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a fucking comic pal.</v>

1493
00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:29.990
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1494
00:59:29.991 --> 00:59:30.824
<v Speaker 3>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a fascinating thing that they </v>

1495
00:59:31.911 --> 00:59:34.010
<v Speaker 3>would bring you over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you got to meet Madis.</v>

1496
00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:37.010
<v Speaker 3>He not only was he cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1497
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:39.050
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knows his history,</v>

1498
00:59:39.051 --> 00:59:39.471
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1499
00:59:39.471 --> 00:59:41.570
<v Speaker 3>I have a soft spot in heart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was talking about,</v>

1500
00:59:41.810 --> 00:59:42.643
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about the Middle East and </v>

1501
00:59:43.161 --> 00:59:45.230
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about the history of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and history of that.</v>

1502
00:59:45.231 --> 00:59:46.490
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sitting here going,</v>

1503
00:59:46.491 --> 00:59:47.960
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that history pretty well.</v>

1504
00:59:48.310 --> 00:59:49.820
<v Speaker 3>And I was sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gee,</v>

1505
00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:51.710
<v Speaker 3>don't they call them the warrior monk?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1506
00:59:51.711 --> 00:59:54.150
<v Speaker 3>he said he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found him fascinating I think.</v>

1507
00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:57.710
<v Speaker 3>And I thought he really understood what </v>
<v Speaker 3>I always hope these people understand,</v>

1508
00:59:57.711 --> 00:59:59.120
<v Speaker 3>which is the limits of power.</v>

1509
00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:01.190
<v Speaker 3>So you would say madison was very good </v>
<v Speaker 3>about saying,</v>

1510
01:00:01.191 --> 01:00:02.024
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't keep doing this and we can't </v>

1511
01:00:03.171 --> 01:00:04.910
<v Speaker 3>keep doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought to myself,</v>

1512
01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:06.013
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much the president's </v>

1513
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:08.790
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean I remember thinking Madison's</v>

1514
01:00:08.810 --> 01:00:10.620
<v Speaker 3>right about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think he is listening.</v>

1515
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:14.690
<v Speaker 3>My friends that are in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost all of them universally,</v>

1516
01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.150
<v Speaker 3>we're very pleased that madness was </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking over.</v>

1517
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:18.530
<v Speaker 3>He's popular especially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1518
01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:20.960
<v Speaker 3>he's popular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Extremely popular because they feel like</v>

1519
01:00:20.961 --> 01:00:21.794
<v Speaker 3>they finally have support now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They felt like they were handcuffed </v>

1520
01:00:24.261 --> 01:00:27.530
<v Speaker 3>during the Obama administration and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was this,</v>

1521
01:00:27.531 --> 01:00:28.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1522
01:00:28.731 --> 01:00:31.860
<v Speaker 3>you had to go almost through a PR firm </v>
<v Speaker 3>before any decisions for me,</v>

1523
01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:35.150
<v Speaker 3>they had to like consult the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ramifications publicly is like that too.</v>

1524
01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:36.163
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lyndon Johnson was picking the specific </v>

1525
01:00:37.401 --> 01:00:38.510
<v Speaker 3>bombing targets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1526
01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:40.220
<v Speaker 3>but here's the problem you have.</v>

1527
01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:42.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you realize,</v>

1528
01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:43.430
<v Speaker 3>and if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're an idiot,</v>

1529
01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:47.480
<v Speaker 3>that you will actually hurt your </v>
<v Speaker 3>longterm goals.</v>

1530
01:00:47.481 --> 01:00:48.320
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1531
01:00:48.321 --> 01:00:51.050
<v Speaker 3>you hit a school and killed 200 little </v>
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>

1532
01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.190
<v Speaker 3>you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1533
01:00:52.191 --> 01:00:53.024
<v Speaker 3>the whole policy has really held hostage</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the potential for a disastrous </v>

1534
01:00:56.481 --> 01:00:59.960
<v Speaker 3>mistake because if the goal is to win </v>
<v Speaker 3>hearts and minds and listen,</v>

1535
01:00:59.961 --> 01:01:00.794
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the only way to win this kind of </v>

1536
01:01:02.091 --> 01:01:03.140
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1537
01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.470
<v Speaker 3>then you do damage to the goal with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mistake.</v>

1538
01:01:06.471 --> 01:01:07.304
<v Speaker 3>And mistakes in war are inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everybody I think is just trying to </v>

1539
01:01:10.381 --> 01:01:11.214
<v Speaker 3>be really careful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard to fight a war really </v>

1540
01:01:12.561 --> 01:01:13.394
<v Speaker 3>carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this war is particularly weird when </v>

1541
01:01:15.861 --> 01:01:17.930
<v Speaker 3>it comes to that because of the use of </v>
<v Speaker 3>drones.</v>

1542
01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:23.200
<v Speaker 3>The use of drones has changed the entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of what war is.</v>

1543
01:01:24.021 --> 01:01:27.500
<v Speaker 3>Because if you look at what happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the Obama administration,</v>

1544
01:01:27.501 --> 01:01:28.334
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the things that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't like to talk about their </v>

1545
01:01:29.601 --> 01:01:30.590
<v Speaker 3>supporters of Obama.</v>

1546
01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:32.623
<v Speaker 3>I believe the number is higher than 80% </v>
<v Speaker 3>of innocent civilians that were killed </v>

1547
01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:39.350
<v Speaker 3>by drones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1548
01:01:39.351 --> 01:01:40.184
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more than 80% imagine any </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of technique and war or anything </v>

1549
01:01:44.001 --> 01:01:45.920
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about policing?</v>

1550
01:01:45.921 --> 01:01:48.800
<v Speaker 3>Let's just go for policing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if there was some criminals that</v>

1551
01:01:48.801 --> 01:01:49.634
<v Speaker 3>were holed up in a building and you add </v>
<v Speaker 3>a hundred people in the building and 20 </v>

1552
01:01:52.881 --> 01:01:55.250
<v Speaker 3>of them were criminals and you killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>

1553
01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:56.293
<v Speaker 3>so you killed 80 people that were just </v>
<v Speaker 3>secretaries and plumbers and just folks </v>

1554
01:02:00.321 --> 01:02:02.780
<v Speaker 3>doing their job live in their life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>

1555
01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:03.883
<v Speaker 3>their families.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You killed all those people to get to </v>

1556
01:02:05.991 --> 01:02:10.250
<v Speaker 3>those 20 people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone would freak the fuck out if you</v>

1557
01:02:10.251 --> 01:02:13.570
<v Speaker 3>did it physically yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ran in with a machine gun and gun,</v>

1558
01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:14.630
<v Speaker 3>everybody down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just,</v>

1559
01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:15.464
<v Speaker 3>I had to kill everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only way to get to the bad </v>

1560
01:02:16.581 --> 01:02:18.320
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody would,</v>

1561
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:19.950
<v Speaker 3>nobody would forgive you</v>

1562
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:24.060
<v Speaker 4>and it would be front page news and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be a horrific crime,</v>

1563
01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:29.720
<v Speaker 4>but it happens constantly when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>to drone warfare in Yemen,</v>

1564
01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:32.820
<v Speaker 4>in parts of the world that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>even supposed to be at war with.</v>

1565
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:33.833
<v Speaker 4>We're sending these flying robots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they shoot something called Hell fire </v>

1566
01:02:37.351 --> 01:02:38.184
<v Speaker 4>missiles like Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're shooting Hellfire missiles at </v>

1567
01:02:41.131 --> 01:02:43.600
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these targets that they're looking at us</v>

1568
01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:46.490
<v Speaker 5>screen and they're often in like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>midwest.</v>

1569
01:02:46.491 --> 01:02:47.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's where some of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

1570
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:49.360
<v Speaker 5>you know what it is though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all part of it.</v>

1571
01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:49.910
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

1572
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:50.743
<v Speaker 5>there's a term and you military guys </v>
<v Speaker 5>listening will all know what it's </v>

1573
01:02:52.551 --> 01:02:53.780
<v Speaker 5>called,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rma.</v>

1574
01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:59.180
<v Speaker 5>A real revolution in military affairs </v>
<v Speaker 5>and RMA periods in time happens.</v>

1575
01:03:00.461 --> 01:03:01.294
<v Speaker 5>So you imagine the period between no </v>
<v Speaker 5>gunpowder and the mass use of gunpowder </v>

1576
01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.430
<v Speaker 5>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's an RMA period in history,</v>

1577
01:03:07.431 --> 01:03:11.180
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But normally what appears to be fast,</v>

1578
01:03:11.181 --> 01:03:12.014
<v Speaker 5>like the transition from no gunpowder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gunpowder is really relatively slow by </v>

1579
01:03:16.101 --> 01:03:16.934
<v Speaker 5>modern standards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you have several generations to get </v>

1580
01:03:19.641 --> 01:03:20.474
<v Speaker 5>used to the changes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the speed of the pace of change now </v>

1581
01:03:23.361 --> 01:03:25.640
<v Speaker 5>is so quickly that by the time you begin</v>
<v Speaker 5>to say,</v>

1582
01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:26.713
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've been using the current weapons </v>

1583
01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:28.723
<v Speaker 5>systems and set up for five years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now we think we're starting to </v>

1584
01:03:30.531 --> 01:03:31.280
<v Speaker 5>understand it.</v>

1585
01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.840
<v Speaker 5>It's obsolete.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1586
01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:33.793
<v Speaker 5>What I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is so long ago that we've been </v>

1587
01:03:35.541 --> 01:03:36.374
<v Speaker 5>podcasting a long time Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I remember years and years ago when </v>

1588
01:03:38.271 --> 01:03:40.040
<v Speaker 5>we first started using these drones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

1589
01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:44.360
<v Speaker 5>we're going to screw this up because </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're using them the same way the United</v>

1590
01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:47.510
<v Speaker 5>States used atomic weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is as though no one else will ever</v>

1591
01:03:47.511 --> 01:03:48.590
<v Speaker 5>get them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1592
01:03:48.770 --> 01:03:52.790
<v Speaker 5>We are establishing the rules and when </v>
<v Speaker 5>other people get this stuff,</v>

1593
01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:55.070
<v Speaker 5>those are going to be the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They operate under two.</v>

1594
01:03:55.071 --> 01:03:57.050
<v Speaker 5>But our attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I've never understood this,</v>

1595
01:03:57.051 --> 01:03:58.910
<v Speaker 5>but we have a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's the um,</v>

1596
01:03:59.060 --> 01:03:59.893
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's how democratic or republics </v>
<v Speaker 5>work in the sense that we can only </v>

1597
01:04:03.351 --> 01:04:04.184
<v Speaker 5>really think short term because the </v>
<v Speaker 5>politicians are only rewarded short </v>

1598
01:04:06.891 --> 01:04:08.600
<v Speaker 5>term.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean if you say,</v>

1599
01:04:08.601 --> 01:04:10.850
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are the goals of our drone program</v>

1600
01:04:10.851 --> 01:04:13.790
<v Speaker 5>for the next five years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not incorporating what's going to</v>

1601
01:04:13.791 --> 01:04:15.260
<v Speaker 5>happen when China gets drones.</v>

1602
01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:17.420
<v Speaker 5>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what I said at the time is,</v>

1603
01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:18.523
<v Speaker 5>do you know how mad we're going to be if</v>
<v Speaker 5>another major country uses drones the </v>

1604
01:04:21.231 --> 01:04:22.064
<v Speaker 5>way we're using them now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's the same thing with nuclear </v>

1605
01:04:24.141 --> 01:04:24.974
<v Speaker 5>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once other countries got nuclear </v>

1606
01:04:25.731 --> 01:04:26.720
<v Speaker 5>weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we backed off and went,</v>

1607
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:29.350
<v Speaker 5>oh well then we have to have some rules </v>
<v Speaker 5>governing this now.</v>

1608
01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:30.493
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when we were the only ones with </v>

1609
01:04:31.431 --> 01:04:32.264
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we would threaten to use them all the </v>

1610
01:04:32.631 --> 01:04:33.330
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1611
01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:34.310
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you better not do that.</v>

1612
01:04:34.311 --> 01:04:36.860
<v Speaker 5>We'll Nuku easy to say when you're the </v>
<v Speaker 5>only ones with it.</v>

1613
01:04:36.861 --> 01:04:38.570
<v Speaker 5>So when you talk about the drone </v>
<v Speaker 5>warfare,</v>

1614
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:40.910
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would suggest that the problem of,</v>

1615
01:04:40.911 --> 01:04:42.980
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of collateral damage,</v>

1616
01:04:42.981 --> 01:04:44.510
<v Speaker 5>for lack of a better word,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1617
01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.730
<v Speaker 5>is when we've been dealing with for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>long time now.</v>

1618
01:04:46.731 --> 01:04:47.564
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once you talk about the strategic </v>

1619
01:04:48.471 --> 01:04:50.660
<v Speaker 5>bombing of cities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1620
01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:53.090
<v Speaker 5>first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it started Second World War,</v>

1621
01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:54.440
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was massive.</v>

1622
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:56.380
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you,</v>

1623
01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:58.880
<v Speaker 5>then anything is a walk back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you say something like,</v>

1624
01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:00.110
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe Rogan,</v>

1625
01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:02.330
<v Speaker 5>sure we killed those 200 kids at that </v>
<v Speaker 5>school.</v>

1626
01:05:02.331 --> 01:05:04.190
<v Speaker 5>And it's regrettable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's an unusual thing.</v>

1627
01:05:04.191 --> 01:05:07.160
<v Speaker 5>It's not like world war two where we </v>
<v Speaker 5>carpet bombed whole cities.</v>

1628
01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:08.540
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're right.</v>

1629
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:10.820
<v Speaker 5>But is that the standard we can operate </v>
<v Speaker 5>with?</v>

1630
01:05:10.821 --> 01:05:12.620
<v Speaker 5>Will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would suggest that the question is,</v>

1631
01:05:12.890 --> 01:05:15.020
<v Speaker 5>is does it hurt or help what you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>really after?</v>

1632
01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.520
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if Joe Rogan's,</v>

1633
01:05:16.790 --> 01:05:18.430
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry for even going here,</v>

1634
01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:19.443
<v Speaker 5>but if Joe Rogan's children were killed </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a bombing raid that another country </v>

1635
01:05:22.601 --> 01:05:23.434
<v Speaker 5>launched,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is nothing that they could do to </v>

1636
01:05:25.181 --> 01:05:28.600
<v Speaker 5>stop Joe Rogan from hating them for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rest of his life.</v>

1637
01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:29.793
<v Speaker 5>And if Joe Rogan hating the means,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe Rogan's going to find a way to make </v>

1638
01:05:32.141 --> 01:05:35.980
<v Speaker 5>you feel his pain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just created another enemy while you</v>

1639
01:05:35.981 --> 01:05:36.814
<v Speaker 5>were trying to eliminate enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what's so scary about </v>

1640
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:39.960
<v Speaker 5>terrorists.</v>

1641
01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:43.030
<v Speaker 5>You just changed not just the people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that were directly affected,</v>

1642
01:05:43.031 --> 01:05:45.910
<v Speaker 5>but the people that saw the ripples of </v>
<v Speaker 5>pain.</v>

1643
01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:46.870
<v Speaker 5>Giant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1644
01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:47.733
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all I tell people and people get </v>

1645
01:05:50.171 --> 01:05:50.771
<v Speaker 5>offended,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

1646
01:05:50.771 --> 01:05:52.510
<v Speaker 5>I've never understood people get </v>
<v Speaker 5>offended where I say,</v>

1647
01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:56.650
<v Speaker 5>just put yourself in the other guy's </v>
<v Speaker 5>moccasins for a minute,</v>

1648
01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:57.980
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you say,</v>

1649
01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:58.953
<v Speaker 5>because what people say to me is I had </v>
<v Speaker 5>some guy get screaming mad at me saying </v>

1650
01:06:01.151 --> 01:06:03.070
<v Speaker 5>basically he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he followed the dominoes and saying,</v>

1651
01:06:03.071 --> 01:06:05.980
<v Speaker 5>are you saying we deserved nine 11 and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

1652
01:06:05.981 --> 01:06:09.100
<v Speaker 5>if that's really where you took that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if that's where your argument goes,</v>

1653
01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.020
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you totally misunderstood me.</v>

1654
01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:12.093
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying no one's saying deserved,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but saying this is probably what caused </v>

1655
01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:17.200
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I listen.</v>

1656
01:06:17.201 --> 01:06:19.030
<v Speaker 5>Why are we a target?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

1657
01:06:19.031 --> 01:06:20.800
<v Speaker 5>it's not wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As a matter of fact,</v>

1658
01:06:20.801 --> 01:06:24.430
<v Speaker 5>I would suggest it is freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does that even mean?</v>

1659
01:06:25.090 --> 01:06:27.730
<v Speaker 5>And I would suggest this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>while there are some people who say,</v>

1660
01:06:27.731 --> 01:06:28.564
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at the way you have women on </v>

1661
01:06:29.261 --> 01:06:30.520
<v Speaker 5>billboards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>scantily clad.</v>

1662
01:06:30.521 --> 01:06:32.140
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are people that hate that and that</v>

1663
01:06:32.141 --> 01:06:33.970
<v Speaker 5>they don't want that either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the same time,</v>

1664
01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:36.610
<v Speaker 5>in a lot of these countries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were talking about Iran earlier.</v>

1665
01:06:36.611 --> 01:06:39.970
<v Speaker 5>Let's talk about Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Iran has got two separate things going.</v>

1666
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:40.833
<v Speaker 5>They've got the countryside and they've </v>
<v Speaker 5>got the cities and they've got a ton of </v>

1667
01:06:43.301 --> 01:06:47.680
<v Speaker 5>the population that's under 30 and in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the cities they'd love to dance and they</v>

1668
01:06:47.681 --> 01:06:48.131
<v Speaker 5>loved,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1669
01:06:48.131 --> 01:06:49.900
<v Speaker 5>the Iranians are not like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1670
01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:51.910
<v Speaker 5>you said they all seem like Muslims to </v>
<v Speaker 5>us,</v>

1671
01:06:51.911 --> 01:06:53.270
<v Speaker 5>but they're all very different from each</v>
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

1672
01:06:53.271 --> 01:06:54.550
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the Arabians,</v>

1673
01:06:54.551 --> 01:06:55.384
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are known to be kind of Spartan and </v>

1674
01:06:57.191 --> 01:06:58.150
<v Speaker 5>Stoic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whereas the,</v>

1675
01:06:58.151 --> 01:07:00.100
<v Speaker 5>the Persians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as they used to be called,</v>

1676
01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:01.810
<v Speaker 5>are a fun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>loving food,</v>

1677
01:07:01.811 --> 01:07:02.980
<v Speaker 5>loving dance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>loving.</v>

1678
01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.110
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're very capitalistic.</v>

1679
01:07:05.111 --> 01:07:06.400
<v Speaker 5>So in a funny way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's an,</v>

1680
01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:08.140
<v Speaker 5>and that's why we were so close to them </v>
<v Speaker 5>for so long.</v>

1681
01:07:08.141 --> 01:07:12.610
<v Speaker 5>There's a natural affinity between us </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I always say it would be pretty darn</v>

1682
01:07:12.611 --> 01:07:15.400
<v Speaker 5>easy if we treated them right the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>way my Stepdad said,</v>

1683
01:07:15.401 --> 01:07:16.234
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can destroy the Soviet Union by </v>

1684
01:07:17.621 --> 01:07:21.070
<v Speaker 5>dumping Elvis records,</v>
<v Speaker 5>porn and blue jeans on them,</v>

1685
01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:22.203
<v Speaker 5>which kind of is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a way I think to approach this </v>

1686
01:07:25.061 --> 01:07:25.894
<v Speaker 5>Muslim world thing and let's not pretend</v>
<v Speaker 5>it won't be totally destabilizing </v>

1687
01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:31.450
<v Speaker 5>because if you drop porn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blue jeans and Elvis on those countries,</v>

1688
01:07:31.451 --> 01:07:32.284
<v Speaker 5>now you're going to have a counter </v>
<v Speaker 5>reaction with all these clerics and </v>

1689
01:07:34.811 --> 01:07:38.020
<v Speaker 5>whatever that are freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But at the end of the game,</v>

1690
01:07:38.290 --> 01:07:41.410
<v Speaker 5>you won't end up looking like the bad </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy if you're bombing them.</v>

1691
01:07:41.411 --> 01:07:42.244
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is so hard to look like the good guy </v>

1692
01:07:44.711 --> 01:07:46.570
<v Speaker 5>when you're bombing people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1693
01:07:46.690 --> 01:07:48.490
<v Speaker 5>And so if you could say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen Dan,</v>

1694
01:07:48.491 --> 01:07:51.070
<v Speaker 5>these are killers who want to hurt us </v>
<v Speaker 5>and we've got to take them out.</v>

1695
01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.050
<v Speaker 5>I totally get that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then I would say to you,</v>

1696
01:07:53.051 --> 01:07:56.200
<v Speaker 5>you have to take them out in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't screw up.</v>

1697
01:07:56.410 --> 01:07:57.610
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the main mission,</v>

1698
01:07:57.611 --> 01:08:00.250
<v Speaker 5>which is let's stop people from wanting </v>
<v Speaker 5>to kill us.</v>

1699
01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.233
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the way they took out Osama bin </v>

1700
01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:04.630
<v Speaker 5>Ladin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1701
01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:05.380
<v Speaker 5>that's about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1702
01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:06.300
<v Speaker 5>and listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are some,</v>

1703
01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:07.153
<v Speaker 5>what that showed us too is that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>these people that are supposedly our </v>

1704
01:08:09.191 --> 01:08:12.370
<v Speaker 5>friends in this war on terror aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we knew this has been the Pakistanis</v>

1705
01:08:12.371 --> 01:08:13.204
<v Speaker 5>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I mean they're not really that </v>

1706
01:08:14.471 --> 01:08:16.400
<v Speaker 5>close.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There'd be our friends because they want</v>

1707
01:08:16.401 --> 01:08:17.234
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the spare parts for the tanks we gave </v>

1708
01:08:18.831 --> 01:08:21.470
<v Speaker 5>them and all these kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I mean,</v>

1709
01:08:22.190 --> 01:08:24.270
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this global warfare things just,</v>

1710
01:08:25.190 --> 01:08:26.023
<v Speaker 5>you got to wonder at what point in time </v>
<v Speaker 5>is this ever gonna level is ever going </v>

1711
01:08:29.161 --> 01:08:29.920
<v Speaker 5>to normalize?</v>

1712
01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.440
<v Speaker 5>Is it ever going to calm down or what </v>
<v Speaker 5>does it get us?</v>

1713
01:08:33.530 --> 01:08:35.270
<v Speaker 5>What doesn't get us?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a song.</v>

1714
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:37.570
<v Speaker 5>Well look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know what it gets some people there,</v>

1715
01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:39.050
<v Speaker 5>and this is the problem our whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>country has,</v>

1716
01:08:39.051 --> 01:08:39.884
<v Speaker 5>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That that some people are able to get </v>

1717
01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:42.884
<v Speaker 5>government to respond to them because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they give government money or what have </v>

1718
01:08:46.131 --> 01:08:47.810
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they can get what they want.</v>

1719
01:08:47.811 --> 01:08:50.690
<v Speaker 5>But does that correspond to what we </v>
<v Speaker 5>need?</v>

1720
01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:53.060
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do we need these wars?</v>

1721
01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:54.043
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean when they say we need to protect </v>

1722
01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:55.641
<v Speaker 5>the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1723
01:08:55.641 --> 01:08:57.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole oil climate has really changed</v>

1724
01:08:58.130 --> 01:08:58.963
<v Speaker 5>since the 19th just to protect the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea is to keep these people at bay </v>

1725
01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:06.650
<v Speaker 5>so that none of them could ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>consolidate and become some gigantic,</v>

1726
01:09:06.651 --> 01:09:10.490
<v Speaker 5>huge war machine that could threaten us </v>
<v Speaker 5>globally.</v>

1727
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:11.580
<v Speaker 5>You know what's at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

1728
01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.220
<v Speaker 5>this is a military history major </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking,</v>

1729
01:09:13.221 --> 01:09:14.054
<v Speaker 5>so I think differently about this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in a sense that would be so much </v>

1730
01:09:16.671 --> 01:09:17.870
<v Speaker 5>easier for us to beat.</v>

1731
01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:19.123
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the funny thing is we know how to beat </v>

1732
01:09:19.941 --> 01:09:22.160
<v Speaker 5>big countries doing audit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if we're,</v>

1733
01:09:22.161 --> 01:09:24.350
<v Speaker 5>we're engaging in thermo nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 5>warfare,</v>

1734
01:09:24.351 --> 01:09:28.100
<v Speaker 5>nobody wins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we can stop them from ever getting to</v>

1735
01:09:28.101 --> 01:09:29.510
<v Speaker 5>that point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the success.</v>

1736
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:33.140
<v Speaker 5>The success is keeping them fragmented,</v>
<v Speaker 5>keeping them beaten down,</v>

1737
01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:35.900
<v Speaker 5>and that if we could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can keep them,</v>

1738
01:09:35.901 --> 01:09:38.060
<v Speaker 5>but they are showing that they can </v>
<v Speaker 5>destroy.</v>

1739
01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.171
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's funny,</v>

1740
01:09:39.171 --> 01:09:40.520
<v Speaker 5>there's two kinds of destroy your </v>
<v Speaker 5>country.</v>

1741
01:09:40.521 --> 01:09:42.560
<v Speaker 5>There's destroy your country and leave </v>
<v Speaker 5>it in rubble,</v>

1742
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:45.560
<v Speaker 5>which they can't do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's destroy your country.</v>

1743
01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:46.453
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the old line is if they hate our </v>

1744
01:09:47.181 --> 01:09:49.280
<v Speaker 5>freedoms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well they did a pretty good job limiting</v>

1745
01:09:49.281 --> 01:09:49.940
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't they?</v>

1746
01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:50.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because,</v>

1747
01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.360
<v Speaker 5>because we're eliminating them to </v>
<v Speaker 5>ourselves.</v>

1748
01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:55.310
<v Speaker 5>And I describes like fleas on a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1749
01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:59.780
<v Speaker 5>they're like fleas on a dog and yet the </v>
<v Speaker 5>dog can tear himself to pieces trying to</v>

1750
01:09:59.781 --> 01:10:02.180
<v Speaker 5>get rid of those fleas and still not get</v>
<v Speaker 5>rid of the fleas.</v>

1751
01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:03.210
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1752
01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:03.820
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1753
01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:04.551
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you really,</v>

1754
01:10:04.551 --> 01:10:05.384
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>terrorism is so effective because it </v>

1755
01:10:06.501 --> 01:10:09.620
<v Speaker 5>requires people to act against human </v>
<v Speaker 5>nature,</v>

1756
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:10.663
<v Speaker 5>which we can do as individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's very tough to get us all </v>

1757
01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:15.140
<v Speaker 5>collectively to not act like human </v>
<v Speaker 5>beings.</v>

1758
01:10:15.141 --> 01:10:17.540
<v Speaker 5>It requires us to act against our </v>
<v Speaker 5>nature,</v>

1759
01:10:17.541 --> 01:10:20.300
<v Speaker 5>which is you punched me on punching you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1760
01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:21.523
<v Speaker 5>And in a funny way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it requires us to be punched and to not </v>

1761
01:10:23.721 --> 01:10:25.010
<v Speaker 5>punch back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

1762
01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:26.750
<v Speaker 5>But how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1763
01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:27.673
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a book by Mark Kurlansky who's </v>

1764
01:10:28.851 --> 01:10:30.080
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's a leftist for sure.</v>

1765
01:10:30.081 --> 01:10:31.880
<v Speaker 5>So just know going into it what you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>dealing with.</v>

1766
01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:35.520
<v Speaker 5>But it's a book on nonviolence and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to,</v>

1767
01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:36.373
<v Speaker 5>to point out something which I've always</v>
<v Speaker 5>tried to point out to nonviolence is a </v>

1768
01:10:39.561 --> 01:10:44.270
<v Speaker 5>tactic and against certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's extremely effective,</v>

1769
01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:45.860
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not effective against everything,</v>

1770
01:10:45.861 --> 01:10:47.810
<v Speaker 5>but sometimes it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a fun,</v>

1771
01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:48.560
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mark,</v>

1772
01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:52.520
<v Speaker 5>if you could do to Martin Luther King </v>
<v Speaker 5>what we could do to people now his,</v>

1773
01:10:52.521 --> 01:10:53.354
<v Speaker 5>his sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1774
01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:54.253
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things you young people may </v>

1775
01:10:55.101 --> 01:10:58.010
<v Speaker 5>not know is one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his effective protest was to go to these</v>

1776
01:10:58.011 --> 01:10:59.390
<v Speaker 5>all white,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1777
01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:00.613
<v Speaker 5>counters in the south where they </v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't serve black folks and just sit </v>

1778
01:11:02.661 --> 01:11:04.100
<v Speaker 5>at the counter and wait to be arrested.</v>

1779
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:06.800
<v Speaker 5>And then when he was arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Time magazine would be there to get,</v>

1780
01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:07.813
<v Speaker 5>and there's a great photograph of him </v>
<v Speaker 5>being handcuffed just for the audacity </v>

1781
01:11:10.821 --> 01:11:12.320
<v Speaker 5>of sitting at a soda counter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1782
01:11:12.321 --> 01:11:13.154
<v Speaker 5>And it was very powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was powerful because you saw </v>

1783
01:11:15.781 --> 01:11:18.990
<v Speaker 5>violence initiated against somebody who </v>
<v Speaker 5>was totally peaceful,</v>

1784
01:11:18.991 --> 01:11:22.230
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If today you could go up to him and just</v>

1785
01:11:22.231 --> 01:11:23.064
<v Speaker 5>tase him or do something that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that was not physically violent </v>

1786
01:11:26.941 --> 01:11:29.040
<v Speaker 5>than he wouldn't get what he needed out </v>
<v Speaker 5>of that,</v>

1787
01:11:29.041 --> 01:11:29.874
<v Speaker 5>which is he needed that photograph of </v>
<v Speaker 5>him being physically manhandled for the </v>

1788
01:11:33.150 --> 01:11:33.983
<v Speaker 5>simple or like not to change subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the same subject but like the </v>

1789
01:11:36.421 --> 01:11:38.280
<v Speaker 5>pictures that were coming out when I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>a kid,</v>

1790
01:11:38.281 --> 01:11:39.114
<v Speaker 5>you can open up those giant life </v>
<v Speaker 5>magazine books with a great photos of </v>

1791
01:11:41.521 --> 01:11:45.980
<v Speaker 5>life and one of them was famous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a black protester in the south of</v>

1792
01:11:45.981 --> 01:11:49.350
<v Speaker 5>Alabama or Mississippi and he's standing</v>
<v Speaker 5>there with his arms at his side,</v>

1793
01:11:49.351 --> 01:11:50.220
<v Speaker 5>not resisting at all.</v>

1794
01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:51.053
<v Speaker 5>And the police officer has,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has sicked a German shepard on him who </v>

1795
01:11:53.461 --> 01:11:55.110
<v Speaker 5>was biting him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1796
01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:56.880
<v Speaker 5>And you look at yourself right there and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go,</v>

1797
01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:58.350
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that photograph,</v>

1798
01:11:58.351 --> 01:12:01.560
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're motivated so much public opinion</v>

1799
01:12:01.561 --> 01:12:02.394
<v Speaker 5>in a different direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what if they didn't need to use a </v>

1800
01:12:03.931 --> 01:12:04.764
<v Speaker 5>dog or a water cannon?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if they could have just injected </v>

1801
01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:08.920
<v Speaker 5>you from behind?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy falls limping.</v>

1802
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:09.783
<v Speaker 5>You just carry him off silently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Will you just diminished his power to </v>

1803
01:12:12.931 --> 01:12:13.681
<v Speaker 5>make a deal?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1804
01:12:13.681 --> 01:12:15.000
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it right there.</v>

1805
01:12:15.670 --> 01:12:16.503
<v Speaker 5>And you look how powerful that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's powerful because some guy is </v>

1806
01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:21.620
<v Speaker 5>being violently attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two appears to be new.</v>

1807
01:12:21.630 --> 01:12:23.300
<v Speaker 5>Nothing more than asking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1808
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:24.360
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for his rights.</v>

1809
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:26.670
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you didn't have that violence,</v>

1810
01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:29.480
<v Speaker 5>does that somehow change the message and</v>
<v Speaker 5>make it less powerful?</v>

1811
01:12:29.490 --> 01:12:31.260
<v Speaker 5>They could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could've just injected him quietly,</v>

1812
01:12:31.261 --> 01:12:32.490
<v Speaker 5>taken him off to jail.</v>

1813
01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:35.730
<v Speaker 5>This doesn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this made a big difference.</v>

1814
01:12:36.650 --> 01:12:39.120
<v Speaker 5>That's a very powerful photograph.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1815
01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:43.350
<v Speaker 5>it's people who aren't there get a </v>
<v Speaker 5>chance to understand the barbaric nature</v>

1816
01:12:43.351 --> 01:12:44.790
<v Speaker 5>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get to see your,</v>

1817
01:12:44.791 --> 01:12:45.624
<v Speaker 5>you're literally getting attacked by an </v>
<v Speaker 5>animal that's on a leash and being </v>

1818
01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.170
<v Speaker 5>black.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was going to say,</v>

1819
01:12:52.171 --> 01:12:52.681
<v Speaker 5>you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1820
01:12:52.681 --> 01:12:54.390
<v Speaker 5>what did that guy do if he just murdered</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody?</v>

1821
01:12:54.391 --> 01:12:55.230
<v Speaker 5>We're all going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1822
01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:56.330
<v Speaker 5>well that's what you get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pal.</v>

1823
01:12:56.331 --> 01:12:57.164
<v Speaker 5>But if all he's doing is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do I really have to sit at the back of </v>

1824
01:12:59.941 --> 01:13:03.640
<v Speaker 5>the bus in 1965 or something?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It this,</v>

1825
01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.580
<v Speaker 5>this kind of thing motivated a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1826
01:13:05.850 --> 01:13:09.570
<v Speaker 5>But if you know it's like 60 minutes did</v>
<v Speaker 5>a great piece,</v>

1827
01:13:09.571 --> 01:13:10.404
<v Speaker 5>I want to say 1992,</v>
<v Speaker 5>1993 where they were showing all of the </v>

1828
01:13:12.751 --> 01:13:16.320
<v Speaker 5>new anti protestor weapons that were in </v>
<v Speaker 5>development.</v>

1829
01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:18.780
<v Speaker 5>And what's funny is several of them have</v>
<v Speaker 5>arrived.</v>

1830
01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:22.410
<v Speaker 5>One of them is the sonic cannon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which they deployed against uh,</v>

1831
01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.700
<v Speaker 5>anti new world order protest or types </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1832
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.990
<v Speaker 5>isn't that what they used against people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that were in Cuba?</v>

1833
01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:29.940
<v Speaker 5>Wasn't that something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know there's a,</v>

1834
01:13:29.941 --> 01:13:30.774
<v Speaker 5>there's a rumor that there was something</v>
<v Speaker 5>used in people that hasn't been figured </v>

1835
01:13:33.091 --> 01:13:35.160
<v Speaker 5>out yet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this was the sonic canon thing where</v>

1836
01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:37.680
<v Speaker 5>you can target but something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Got You.</v>

1837
01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:39.510
<v Speaker 5>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well some people said,</v>

1838
01:13:39.511 --> 01:13:40.051
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Madsen,</v>

1839
01:13:40.051 --> 01:13:40.710
<v Speaker 5>Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1840
01:13:40.710 --> 01:13:41.101
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they will.</v>

1841
01:13:41.101 --> 01:13:41.934
<v Speaker 5>They said they lost their hearing or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something and they assume it was the </v>

1842
01:13:43.441 --> 01:13:45.910
<v Speaker 5>government that they were fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what the,</v>

1843
01:13:45.911 --> 01:13:48.480
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they couldn't physically here it is that</v>

1844
01:13:48.481 --> 01:13:50.850
<v Speaker 5>what it was like something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just that's not hearing damage,</v>

1845
01:13:51.690 --> 01:13:53.940
<v Speaker 5>but see if he could pull that up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out what the,</v>

1846
01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:56.940
<v Speaker 5>imagine instead of that power here photo</v>
<v Speaker 5>that made a difference.</v>

1847
01:13:56.941 --> 01:13:59.250
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if you could have just aim the </v>
<v Speaker 5>sonic cannon and,</v>

1848
01:13:59.251 --> 01:14:01.770
<v Speaker 5>and people leave because it's painful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1849
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:02.663
<v Speaker 5>does that reduce the value then of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>nonviolent protest that was so powerful </v>

1850
01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:06.851
<v Speaker 5>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is what they're,</v>

1851
01:14:06.851 --> 01:14:09.300
<v Speaker 5>they're doing this right here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

1852
01:14:09.301 --> 01:14:12.310
<v Speaker 5>this is really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1853
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:15.340
<v Speaker 1>so a group of American diplomats in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Havana,</v>

1854
01:14:15.341 --> 01:14:16.174
<v Speaker 1>Cuba have suffered severe and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unexplained hearing loss over the past </v>

1855
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:19.833
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which u s officials believe was caused </v>

1856
01:14:20.681 --> 01:14:25.240
<v Speaker 1>by a covert and advanced sonic device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is something that we're not even</v>

1857
01:14:25.241 --> 01:14:27.490
<v Speaker 1>aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have those devices.</v>

1858
01:14:27.491 --> 01:14:28.324
<v Speaker 1>That's why they might know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do they just not want to comment on </v>

1859
01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:32.200
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We possess these things.</v>

1860
01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:33.034
<v Speaker 1>He's able,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know we've deployed them rip into </v>

1861
01:14:34.121 --> 01:14:36.070
<v Speaker 1>this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what this one is.</v>

1862
01:14:36.071 --> 01:14:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they should know.</v>

1863
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the device admitted a sound that was not</v>

1864
01:14:40.121 --> 01:14:42.010
<v Speaker 1>audible to human ears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They added,</v>

1865
01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:43.233
<v Speaker 1>it would indicate that it was most </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely an infrasonic or ultrasonic </v>

1866
01:14:46.151 --> 01:14:46.984
<v Speaker 1>weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Infrasonic weapons can cause physical </v>

1867
01:14:48.341 --> 01:14:52.420
<v Speaker 1>pain without detection though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they usually target the entire body than</v>

1868
01:14:52.421 --> 01:14:53.920
<v Speaker 1>rather just the eardrums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1869
01:14:53.921 --> 01:14:56.260
<v Speaker 1>How fucking bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

1870
01:14:56.261 --> 01:14:59.440
<v Speaker 1>it's a different kind of origin bond out</v>
<v Speaker 1>control though,</v>

1871
01:14:59.441 --> 01:14:59.850
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1872
01:14:59.850 --> 01:15:00.910
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if,</v>

1873
01:15:00.911 --> 01:15:01.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1874
01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:04.270
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the famous Gandhi Salt March,</v>

1875
01:15:04.271 --> 01:15:06.210
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is considered a,</v>

1876
01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:07.083
<v Speaker 1>one of the big moments in nonviolent </v>
<v Speaker 1>history where he had all of his </v>

1877
01:15:09.011 --> 01:15:13.540
<v Speaker 1>supporters walk into the clubs of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>authorities and he told them,</v>

1878
01:15:13.541 --> 01:15:14.374
<v Speaker 1>don't resist it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just go down and then let the next </v>

1879
01:15:16.871 --> 01:15:18.250
<v Speaker 1>row get hit too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the neck,</v>

1880
01:15:18.370 --> 01:15:21.120
<v Speaker 1>because that was a powerful sign of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1881
01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:23.110
<v Speaker 1>who's right and who's wrong in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing.</v>

1882
01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:24.123
<v Speaker 1>But if you could just deploy that Sonic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canon and all those people had so much </v>

1883
01:15:26.681 --> 01:15:27.514
<v Speaker 1>pain in the rear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just had to leave and nobody got </v>

1884
01:15:28.601 --> 01:15:29.530
<v Speaker 1>beaten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no blood,</v>

1885
01:15:29.531 --> 01:15:31.540
<v Speaker 1>there was no dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were no water cannons.</v>

1886
01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:35.500
<v Speaker 1>Does that undercut the power of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonviolent protest to make change?</v>

1887
01:15:35.650 --> 01:15:36.483
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating that that might have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been in the minds of the people who </v>

1888
01:15:38.801 --> 01:15:39.970
<v Speaker 1>designed this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1889
01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so abstract,</v>

1890
01:15:41.501 --> 01:15:45.400
<v Speaker 1>the idea of this sonic weapon that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't hear,</v>

1891
01:15:45.670 --> 01:15:50.020
<v Speaker 1>but that affects your hearing and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes injury to your body,</v>

1892
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:53.380
<v Speaker 1>but you don't hear it like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to affect us because it</v>

1893
01:15:53.381 --> 01:15:54.430
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a bat,</v>

1894
01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:56.240
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bat that hits a person,</v>

1895
01:15:56.250 --> 01:15:59.380
<v Speaker 1>you understand it when you get a picture</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards that you can circulate.</v>

1896
01:15:59.381 --> 01:16:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Look what they did to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1897
01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:03.820
<v Speaker 1>remember the Chicago convention in 68 </v>
<v Speaker 1>that everybody,</v>

1898
01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:04.773
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the protesters were beaten so </v>

1899
01:16:05.861 --> 01:16:08.310
<v Speaker 1>badly on television and all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1900
01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:11.920
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't have to beat him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it lose a lot of its power?</v>

1901
01:16:11.921 --> 01:16:12.754
<v Speaker 1>If you just deployed the sonic cannon </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody goes away because it </v>

1902
01:16:14.381 --> 01:16:15.214
<v Speaker 1>hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me like you would've just </v>

1903
01:16:16.871 --> 01:16:19.370
<v Speaker 1>diffused one of the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

1904
01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:20.323
<v Speaker 1>I would call that one of the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>political things that happened in the </v>

1905
01:16:22.601 --> 01:16:24.130
<v Speaker 1>United States in the past 50 years.</v>

1906
01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:27.160
<v Speaker 1>And if you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there was no actual violence,</v>

1907
01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:31.600
<v Speaker 1>it's not a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it fascinating that we have to see</v>

1908
01:16:31.601 --> 01:16:33.640
<v Speaker 1>something where we go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1909
01:16:33.641 --> 01:16:35.490
<v Speaker 1>I know what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bad.</v>

1910
01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.530
<v Speaker 1>And then everybody gets outraged and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then then change happens.</v>

1911
01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that how the Arab spring stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1912
01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:41.770
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about drones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1913
01:16:42.010 --> 01:16:43.160
<v Speaker 1>We're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1914
01:16:43.290 --> 01:16:44.123
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one of the reasons why you can </v>

1915
01:16:44.651 --> 01:16:48.580
<v Speaker 1>justify this is it's not actually done </v>
<v Speaker 1>by a human who's on the premises.</v>

1916
01:16:48.610 --> 01:16:49.443
<v Speaker 1>There was talk during the big bombing </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaigns at the Second World War when </v>

1917
01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:52.774
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about the morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This and Churchill famously saw the </v>

1918
01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:58.450
<v Speaker 1>movies showing some of these German </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities just leveled.</v>

1919
01:16:58.451 --> 01:17:00.460
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we beasts now?</v>

1920
01:17:00.461 --> 01:17:01.780
<v Speaker 1>This is the guy who ordered it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1921
01:17:01.781 --> 01:17:03.730
<v Speaker 1>But when he actually saw what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1922
01:17:04.050 --> 01:17:05.640
<v Speaker 1>the guy I grew up next door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1923
01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.270
<v Speaker 1>to was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was almost an astronaut,</v>

1924
01:17:07.271 --> 01:17:08.320
<v Speaker 1>but he was a fighter pilot.</v>

1925
01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:10.610
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they conducted bombing runs in,</v>

1926
01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:13.070
<v Speaker 1>in Korea and Vietnam and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said to me,</v>

1927
01:17:13.071 --> 01:17:16.130
<v Speaker 1>if you actually had to see the people we</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed,</v>

1928
01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.240
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't have done this.</v>

1929
01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:19.070
<v Speaker 1>But you didn't have to see them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

1930
01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:21.050
<v Speaker 1>there was a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a distance and them,</v>

1931
01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:25.010
<v Speaker 1>and there's a book called on killing by </v>
<v Speaker 1>US army psychologist David Grossman's,</v>

1932
01:17:25.011 --> 01:17:28.430
<v Speaker 1>his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he talks about killing in terms of</v>

1933
01:17:28.431 --> 01:17:29.810
<v Speaker 1>distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is distance.</v>

1934
01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:32.450
<v Speaker 1>So there's intimacy range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when you're killing somebody with</v>

1935
01:17:32.451 --> 01:17:35.270
<v Speaker 1>a knife close up and then the farther </v>
<v Speaker 1>away you get,</v>

1936
01:17:35.271 --> 01:17:38.000
<v Speaker 1>the easier it is to do the deed he says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the less you,</v>

1937
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:40.310
<v Speaker 1>the less damage you have later </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologic.</v>

1938
01:17:40.311 --> 01:17:41.144
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there an analogy to social media </v>
<v Speaker 1>here about people that can say maybe </v>

1939
01:17:45.010 --> 01:17:45.843
<v Speaker 1>we'll cruel shit to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually on connection and they </v>

1940
01:17:48.201 --> 01:17:50.810
<v Speaker 1>can't do it in person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in person,</v>

1941
01:17:50.850 --> 01:17:51.683
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't even be in your character </v>

1942
01:17:52.570 --> 01:17:54.550
<v Speaker 1>doing a person that not even in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

1943
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:55.383
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you almost have like a dual character </v>

1944
01:17:57.231 --> 01:18:00.380
<v Speaker 1>that comes out when you know you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to see this person.</v>

1945
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:01.333
<v Speaker 1>And truthfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I really want from Joe Rogan has to </v>

1946
01:18:02.541 --> 01:18:03.374
<v Speaker 1>answer to answer me in the best way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can answer me as if I call him </v>

1947
01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:05.990
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1948
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Well anybody who does anything negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the public is aware of it.</v>

1949
01:18:10.791 --> 01:18:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say this Louis C.</v>

1950
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.903
<v Speaker 1>Case thing or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you can immediately find and target </v>

1951
01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:16.363
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I have a reason to go after this </v>

1952
01:18:18.471 --> 01:18:19.340
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

1953
01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:20.421
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1954
01:18:20.421 --> 01:18:21.254
<v Speaker 1>it's an acceptable target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an agreed upon target and then </v>

1955
01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:25.513
<v Speaker 1>people from all over the world could </v>
<v Speaker 1>just pour their vitriol and anger and </v>

1956
01:18:29.211 --> 01:18:33.050
<v Speaker 1>bitterness and whatever it is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have some sort of a righteous anger</v>

1957
01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.333
<v Speaker 1>that they could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's a reason I can be angry at </v>

1958
01:18:35.661 --> 01:18:36.494
<v Speaker 1>this person or I saw what a Kathy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Griffin did when she held up that head </v>

1959
01:18:40.731 --> 01:18:41.510
<v Speaker 1>of Donald Trump.</v>

1960
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:43.940
<v Speaker 1>But I have a reason now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't,</v>

1961
01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:46.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm not standing up for Kathy Griffin </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I think what she did was stupid,</v>

1962
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.863
<v Speaker 1>but she was just devastated by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they went after her like death </v>

1963
01:18:53.751 --> 01:18:56.040
<v Speaker 1>threats and hate and anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

1964
01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:58.250
<v Speaker 1>you've taught me a lot about the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>social media thing though,</v>

1965
01:18:58.251 --> 01:19:00.170
<v Speaker 1>because I would come in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience doesn't know this,</v>

1966
01:19:00.171 --> 01:19:01.700
<v Speaker 1>but I would have questions about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1967
01:19:01.701 --> 01:19:02.534
<v Speaker 1>And you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've thought more about this than I </v>

1968
01:19:03.681 --> 01:19:06.630
<v Speaker 1>have and you were able on several of k I</v>
<v Speaker 1>quoted you where I,</v>

1969
01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:07.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1970
01:19:07.401 --> 01:19:09.530
<v Speaker 1>cause I tried to make sense of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and like I said,</v>

1971
01:19:09.531 --> 01:19:10.364
<v Speaker 1>you're farther along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the road of thinking about some </v>

1972
01:19:11.661 --> 01:19:13.730
<v Speaker 1>of this stuff and it gave me some </v>
<v Speaker 1>shortcuts,</v>

1973
01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:14.773
<v Speaker 1>but I mean I do because I think it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating phenomenon because it's </v>

1974
01:19:17.841 --> 01:19:18.680
<v Speaker 1>never been available.</v>

1975
01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.630
<v Speaker 1>And when did people ever have this kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of power?</v>

1976
01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Your average guy locked in his basement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1977
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:27.170
<v Speaker 1>never goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he could still talk to the world.</v>

1978
01:19:27.171 --> 01:19:28.004
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the stereotype of this loser in </v>

1979
01:19:30.231 --> 01:19:31.750
<v Speaker 1>their basement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which basement?</v>

1980
01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:32.451
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1981
01:19:32.451 --> 01:19:34.700
<v Speaker 1>it could be a guy with a family who's at</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1982
01:19:34.730 --> 01:19:35.563
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was just his wife or his wife or </v>

1983
01:19:37.371 --> 01:19:40.160
<v Speaker 1>his kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody just saying horrible shit.</v>

1984
01:19:40.161 --> 01:19:45.161
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many options for people to be</v>

1985
01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:49.370
<v Speaker 1>nasty to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this absence of social cues,</v>

1986
01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:52.880
<v Speaker 1>absence of like being in the physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>presence of someone,</v>

1987
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:53.390
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1988
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:56.240
<v Speaker 1>this is an alien way of communicating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not normal.</v>

1989
01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:57.253
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why I always </v>
<v Speaker 1>hated the letters because people could </v>

1990
01:19:59.511 --> 01:20:00.344
<v Speaker 1>write some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'd get letters from an ex </v>

1991
01:20:01.401 --> 01:20:02.061
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1992
01:20:02.061 --> 01:20:03.680
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1993
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 1>this is a bullshit depiction of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship made this</v>

1994
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:11.430
<v Speaker 3>romanticized idea of what this is all </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

1995
01:20:11.431 --> 01:20:15.300
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't like letters because </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone can't be there to go,</v>

1996
01:20:15.301 --> 01:20:16.021
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1997
01:20:16.021 --> 01:20:17.660
<v Speaker 3>That didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah it did.</v>

1998
01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:19.290
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you remember you said this?</v>

1999
01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:20.153
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know there's a physical proximity </v>

2000
01:20:21.691 --> 01:20:22.524
<v Speaker 3>question too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not going to go up to this </v>

2001
01:20:23.311 --> 01:20:25.440
<v Speaker 3>guy and say this stuff to his face </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he might knock you in.</v>

2002
01:20:25.441 --> 01:20:26.274
<v Speaker 3>The head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can think about a letter is maybe if </v>

2003
01:20:28.231 --> 01:20:29.064
<v Speaker 3>someone is an honest person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can express themselves in a letter </v>

2004
01:20:31.770 --> 01:20:32.603
<v Speaker 3>in a way that they would have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult time doing it in first and </v>

2005
01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:36.840
<v Speaker 3>then cause they full too and they feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>embarrassed or they have,</v>

2006
01:20:37.290 --> 01:20:39.900
<v Speaker 3>when you're writing something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the opportunity to really think</v>

2007
01:20:39.901 --> 01:20:43.200
<v Speaker 3>about your words and edit and go over it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then decide,</v>

2008
01:20:43.201 --> 01:20:48.201
<v Speaker 3>this actually represents my real </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts and as imperfect as it is,</v>

2009
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:51.143
<v Speaker 3>send it.</v>

2010
01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.013
<v Speaker 3>But when you can do that any moment of </v>
<v Speaker 3>any day with your phone in the middle </v>

2011
01:20:57.661 --> 01:20:58.500
<v Speaker 3>like someone's talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2012
01:20:58.501 --> 01:20:59.580
<v Speaker 3>hold on a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold on a second.</v>

2013
01:20:59.581 --> 01:21:02.970
<v Speaker 3>Jump the fuck you fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just tweet the top of these athletes</v>

2014
01:21:02.971 --> 01:21:03.804
<v Speaker 3>or celebrities getting with with what </v>
<v Speaker 3>was obviously I'm just about to board </v>

2015
01:21:06.451 --> 01:21:07.284
<v Speaker 3>the plane so I'll just and boom they get</v>
<v Speaker 3>off the plane and there's a huge </v>

2016
01:21:08.911 --> 01:21:13.170
<v Speaker 3>firestorm cause cause something was </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken wrong or not the way you meant it.</v>

2017
01:21:13.171 --> 01:21:14.110
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2018
01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:15.233
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a weird time and I think </v>

2019
01:21:17.161 --> 01:21:17.994
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're at an adolescent stage of </v>

2020
01:21:21.211 --> 01:21:23.040
<v Speaker 3>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>

2021
01:21:23.041 --> 01:21:25.380
<v Speaker 3>I think we went through all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>rudimentary steps,</v>

2022
01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:26.214
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went through grunts and then we had </v>

2023
01:21:27.541 --> 01:21:28.374
<v Speaker 3>verbal language and then we had written </v>
<v Speaker 3>language and then we had the printing </v>

2024
01:21:30.811 --> 01:21:31.644
<v Speaker 3>press and then we had the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>broadcast and then then we had social </v>

2025
01:21:34.531 --> 01:21:35.250
<v Speaker 3>media.</v>

2026
01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:36.083
<v Speaker 3>The ability for anybody to broadcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think as we move into augmented </v>

2027
01:21:39.691 --> 01:21:40.524
<v Speaker 3>reality and what I've been thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about more and more is this Rosetta </v>

2028
01:21:43.381 --> 01:21:44.214
<v Speaker 3>stone idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This idea that we're going to come up </v>

2029
01:21:46.591 --> 01:21:47.424
<v Speaker 3>with some sort of a way of communicating</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas that's not limited and restricted </v>

2030
01:21:51.541 --> 01:21:54.750
<v Speaker 3>to language as a military history </v>
<v Speaker 3>fanatic.</v>

2031
01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:58.710
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I instantly think of?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I instantly think of the fact that could</v>

2032
01:21:58.711 --> 01:21:59.544
<v Speaker 3>you start a war if one country's average</v>
<v Speaker 3>joes and Janes on social media or </v>

2033
01:22:04.831 --> 01:22:05.664
<v Speaker 3>whatever passes or start really </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagreeing in their thousands and tens </v>

2034
01:22:09.901 --> 01:22:12.630
<v Speaker 3>of thousands and 50 thousands with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in another country.</v>

2035
01:22:12.631 --> 01:22:13.464
<v Speaker 3>And we could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could the Russian people via social </v>

2036
01:22:15.241 --> 01:22:16.074
<v Speaker 3>media anger the American people via </v>
<v Speaker 3>social media to such a degree that </v>

2037
01:22:19.531 --> 01:22:21.490
<v Speaker 3>countries get pulled into conflict?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even,</v>

2038
01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:24.780
<v Speaker 3>it's never been possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can't know.</v>

2039
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:25.471
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2040
01:22:25.471 --> 01:22:26.610
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you turn around and go,</v>

2041
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:28.810
<v Speaker 3>that would be an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you,</v>

2042
01:22:28.890 --> 01:22:32.460
<v Speaker 3>you point out quite correctly that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially Guinea pigs here right now.</v>

2043
01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:33.323
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is what I tried to explain to my </v>

2044
01:22:34.171 --> 01:22:38.040
<v Speaker 3>daughters that we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are in an era where we're seeing what</v>

2045
01:22:38.041 --> 01:22:41.700
<v Speaker 3>happens when you hand humanity these </v>
<v Speaker 3>tools that they've never had before.</v>

2046
01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:43.440
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's two ways of looking at it.</v>

2047
01:22:43.441 --> 01:22:45.420
<v Speaker 3>The optimistic one with this is going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>free up,</v>

2048
01:22:45.421 --> 01:22:48.600
<v Speaker 3>open up all or the pessimistic ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which say maybe something like,</v>

2049
01:22:48.601 --> 01:22:49.434
<v Speaker 3>Ken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our representative democracy handled </v>

2050
01:22:51.571 --> 01:22:54.990
<v Speaker 3>this and not because we can't handle </v>
<v Speaker 3>communication,</v>

2051
01:22:54.991 --> 01:22:55.824
<v Speaker 3>but maybe like you would say the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>communication that we have where these </v>

2052
01:22:59.281 --> 01:23:00.114
<v Speaker 3>are little teeny chunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not having deep philosophical </v>

2053
01:23:02.811 --> 01:23:04.890
<v Speaker 3>coffee house Ben Franklin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of calmer.</v>

2054
01:23:05.050 --> 01:23:06.280
<v Speaker 3>We're having 140</v>

2055
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:10.030
<v Speaker 1>character discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can you say at 140 characters other</v>

2056
01:23:10.031 --> 01:23:11.290
<v Speaker 1>than you're an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're wrong.</v>

2057
01:23:11.291 --> 01:23:14.170
<v Speaker 1>It's fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know in the story and where it to 80</v>

2058
01:23:14.171 --> 01:23:15.004
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that will make all the </v>

2059
01:23:16.271 --> 01:23:17.770
<v Speaker 1>difference in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it does.</v>

2060
01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:21.790
<v Speaker 1>I help me get clear my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't clear my throat 140 characters,</v>

2061
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:24.910
<v Speaker 1>so it'll help me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to cause a shift.</v>

2062
01:23:24.911 --> 01:23:25.744
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that the shift from one 40 to </v>

2063
01:23:28.061 --> 01:23:28.894
<v Speaker 1>two 80 will make people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll give people the opportunity to be </v>

2064
01:23:32.261 --> 01:23:35.980
<v Speaker 1>more clear with their ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will say that it's disheartening for a</v>

2065
01:23:35.981 --> 01:23:36.814
<v Speaker 1>person like myself who enjoys depth </v>
<v Speaker 1>because even the history shows her so </v>

2066
01:23:39.311 --> 01:23:40.144
<v Speaker 1>long as I enjoy the depth to see people </v>
<v Speaker 1>confronted with like a page of text </v>

2067
01:23:44.081 --> 01:23:47.110
<v Speaker 1>going on too long to read it funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you do go,</v>

2068
01:23:47.111 --> 01:23:47.944
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you really be a useful citizen as a </v>

2069
01:23:49.541 --> 01:23:52.400
<v Speaker 1>voting member of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an informed citizenry and do your job if</v>

2070
01:23:52.401 --> 01:23:54.240
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you see a page of text like Whoa,</v>

2071
01:23:54.370 --> 01:23:57.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean the constitution today would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be 140 characters,</v>

2072
01:23:57.340 --> 01:23:57.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

2073
01:23:57.860 --> 01:23:59.290
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for most of the people today to go,</v>

2074
01:23:59.291 --> 01:24:00.460
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll sit down and read that.</v>

2075
01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:01.413
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that your podcast has </v>
<v Speaker 1>done that's amazing has given people </v>

2076
01:24:03.911 --> 01:24:04.744
<v Speaker 1>information in a very entertaining form </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would never sit down and read </v>

2077
01:24:08.141 --> 01:24:09.910
<v Speaker 1>a book about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a ton of people,</v>

2078
01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:14.911
<v Speaker 1>probably me included that will never </v>
<v Speaker 1>read as much about Genghis Khan as I got</v>

2079
01:24:15.011 --> 01:24:17.470
<v Speaker 1>from your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you went to see,</v>

2080
01:24:17.471 --> 01:24:19.930
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I hope for because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>always say I don't,</v>

2081
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:22.990
<v Speaker 1>I liked the idea of being an appetizer </v>
<v Speaker 1>for people on history.</v>

2082
01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:24.033
<v Speaker 1>If I introduced somebody to the Hmong </v>
<v Speaker 1>goals and then they went and go to our </v>

2083
01:24:27.791 --> 01:24:28.624
<v Speaker 1>website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we put all of the materials we use and </v>

2084
01:24:29.801 --> 01:24:31.510
<v Speaker 1>we linked directly to a place where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get them.</v>

2085
01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:32.613
<v Speaker 1>So if you actually went out and bought </v>
<v Speaker 1>some books on the Mongols after that or </v>

2086
01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:40.070
<v Speaker 1>or that created an intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between you and the Mongols</v>

2087
01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:41.350
<v Speaker 1>were for the rest of your life.</v>

2088
01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:43.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh this is a mongols they found Genghis </v>
<v Speaker 1>Khan's tomb or something.</v>

2089
01:24:43.841 --> 01:24:48.220
<v Speaker 1>You're into it because you know about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I mean that's awesome.</v>

2090
01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.580
<v Speaker 1>In terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I heard 'em,</v>

2091
01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:51.453
<v Speaker 1>I got a great letter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the highlight of my career was </v>

2092
01:24:53.051 --> 01:24:57.130
<v Speaker 1>this letter from the wife of a historian</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we used in the world war one series</v>

2093
01:24:57.131 --> 01:24:59.290
<v Speaker 1>and she wrote me this letter saying you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have no,</v>

2094
01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:00.333
<v Speaker 1>this is like very self serving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have no idea what you're doing </v>

2095
01:25:02.650 --> 01:25:03.483
<v Speaker 1>because history is something that not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people were getting interested </v>

2096
01:25:05.531 --> 01:25:07.240
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now we have people showing up in the</v>

2097
01:25:07.241 --> 01:25:08.074
<v Speaker 1>classrooms becoming history majors </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they got interested in what you </v>

2098
01:25:10.701 --> 01:25:11.534
<v Speaker 1>were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we're poking people with a stick </v>

2099
01:25:14.021 --> 01:25:15.650
<v Speaker 1>and getting them interested in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject,</v>

2100
01:25:15.651 --> 01:25:17.500
<v Speaker 1>do you know how cool it would be to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

2101
01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:18.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

2102
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:19.900
<v Speaker 1>when you're all dead and gone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody says,</v>

2103
01:25:19.901 --> 01:25:20.770
<v Speaker 1>what did you do?</v>

2104
01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:21.800
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

2105
01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:24.280
<v Speaker 1>he got a lot of people really interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in history.</v>

2106
01:25:24.850 --> 01:25:26.680
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the coolest thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

2107
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:27.783
<v Speaker 1>They've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it dovetails with what we were </v>

2108
01:25:28.931 --> 01:25:30.340
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This whole new media.</v>

2109
01:25:30.341 --> 01:25:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Will it be good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would it be bad?</v>

2110
01:25:31.511 --> 01:25:32.890
<v Speaker 1>And it's probably going to be both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2111
01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:36.430
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that people could get </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in history again because some</v>

2112
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.040
<v Speaker 1>idiot in his garage was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2113
01:25:39.041 --> 01:25:41.170
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think could be everybody,</v>

2114
01:25:41.171 --> 01:25:42.004
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to be a lot of people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>for those people it is going to have a </v>

2115
01:25:44.201 --> 01:25:48.550
<v Speaker 1>profound effect and me included.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that ha this new media,</v>

2116
01:25:48.551 --> 01:25:52.030
<v Speaker 1>this thing where nobody is telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey dan,</v>

2117
01:25:52.090 --> 01:25:55.960
<v Speaker 1>it's time to do a podcast on blank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's time to,</v>

2118
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut back this edit that you're doing it </v>

2119
01:25:58.421 --> 01:25:59.254
<v Speaker 1>based on your interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your knowledge wouldn't have been this </v>

2120
01:26:00.871 --> 01:26:01.930
<v Speaker 1>show if we'd had yet.</v>

2121
01:26:01.930 --> 01:26:03.710
<v Speaker 1>There was anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wouldn't have been this show.</v>

2122
01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:05.540
<v Speaker 1>I would never been able to pull this </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

2123
01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:06.633
<v Speaker 1>Not in a hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what we have is this unique </v>

2124
01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:12.940
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to express ourselves in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2125
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with a,</v>

2126
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:17.750
<v Speaker 1>with a personal viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is,</v>

2127
01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:18.291
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2128
01:26:18.291 --> 01:26:20.160
<v Speaker 1>your personal interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that you're,</v>

2129
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:21.110
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a pure,</v>

2130
01:26:21.111 --> 01:26:21.944
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the difference between blended </v>

2131
01:26:22.731 --> 01:26:27.380
<v Speaker 1>whiskey and like a single malt where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where if like when I get these TV offers</v>

2132
01:26:27.381 --> 01:26:28.214
<v Speaker 1>and you've had zillions of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you go and you talk to these </v>

2133
01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:32.660
<v Speaker 1>people and you realize instantly if I go</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this with them,</v>

2134
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:35.060
<v Speaker 1>they're going to homogenize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb it down,</v>

2135
01:26:35.061 --> 01:26:36.650
<v Speaker 1>but they're going to check and you sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and go,</v>

2136
01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:37.573
<v Speaker 1>they're going to make something far </v>
<v Speaker 1>inferior to what I'm able to do myself </v>

2137
01:26:40.671 --> 01:26:43.330
<v Speaker 1>because they really don't understand why</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works in,</v>

2138
01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:44.091
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

2139
01:26:44.091 --> 01:26:45.620
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't have been able to do this </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

2140
01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:49.010
<v Speaker 1>It's funny to me that the industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2141
01:26:49.011 --> 01:26:51.920
<v Speaker 1>doesn't realize what it is that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like about what you do.</v>

2142
01:26:51.921 --> 01:26:53.290
<v Speaker 1>And figure out a way to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2143
01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:54.770
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not open minded enough to say,</v>

2144
01:26:54.771 --> 01:26:56.330
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe come under this TV show,</v>

2145
01:26:56.331 --> 01:26:58.300
<v Speaker 1>which is a lot like what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2146
01:26:58.380 --> 01:26:59.213
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand how people like you </v>

2147
01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:03.830
<v Speaker 1>and people like me and all the people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do what we do,</v>

2148
01:27:03.831 --> 01:27:07.730
<v Speaker 1>haven't created more of an understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the old media.</v>

2149
01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:09.110
<v Speaker 1>I think they're getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think?</v>

2150
01:27:09.111 --> 01:27:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually there was no way to avoid it.</v>

2151
01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:13.250
<v Speaker 1>They're getting it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

2152
01:27:13.550 --> 01:27:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Like when I get offers for things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand things like,</v>

2153
01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:16.910
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying,</v>

2154
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:18.650
<v Speaker 1>they're seeing what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're going,</v>

2155
01:27:18.651 --> 01:27:19.790
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want a piece of this.</v>

2156
01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:20.721
<v Speaker 1>How do we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

2157
01:27:20.721 --> 01:27:22.730
<v Speaker 1>but if you do a pan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pull it off.</v>

2158
01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be the same thing.</v>

2159
01:27:24.171 --> 01:27:25.760
<v Speaker 1>This is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they did this,</v>

2160
01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:27.080
<v Speaker 1>it's like say if say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2161
01:27:27.081 --> 01:27:28.590
<v Speaker 1>we want to put your podcast on blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2171
01:27:43.191 --> 01:27:44.540
<v Speaker 1>so finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the TV people,</v>

2172
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:46.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always promising things.</v>

2173
01:27:46.061 --> 01:27:46.894
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it any way you want you so </v>

2174
01:27:47.901 --> 01:27:48.770
<v Speaker 1>far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So finally,</v>

2175
01:27:48.771 --> 01:27:50.420
<v Speaker 1>one of these companies did it so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

2176
01:27:50.421 --> 01:27:50.961
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2177
01:27:50.961 --> 01:27:53.120
<v Speaker 1>I'll go forward with you and we'll start</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this project.</v>

2178
01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:54.193
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm in a particular us city in the </v>

2179
01:27:56.811 --> 01:27:59.390
<v Speaker 1>south and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're cutting the sizzle reel.</v>

2180
01:27:59.390 --> 01:28:01.490
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now this is going to be hardcore,</v>

2181
01:28:01.491 --> 01:28:02.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got me.</v>

2182
01:28:02.361 --> 01:28:03.650
<v Speaker 1>You want hardcore history?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2183
01:28:03.710 --> 01:28:05.540
<v Speaker 1>we all the history channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants it.</v>

2184
01:28:05.541 --> 01:28:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

2185
01:28:06.471 --> 01:28:08.170
<v Speaker 1>so here's what we're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

2186
01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:09.053
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sizzle reel was on the bombings in </v>

2187
01:28:11.511 --> 01:28:13.190
<v Speaker 1>the late sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early seventies,</v>

2188
01:28:13.191 --> 01:28:16.130
<v Speaker 1>of like the new left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the weather underground and all those</v>

2189
01:28:16.131 --> 01:28:16.964
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2190
01:28:17.090 --> 01:28:18.230
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

2191
01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:19.213
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the hardcore history way to do this </v>

2192
01:28:20.721 --> 01:28:21.554
<v Speaker 1>though is to imagine that era with </v>
<v Speaker 1>today's anti-terror laws and the way we </v>

2193
01:28:26.061 --> 01:28:26.894
<v Speaker 1>treat terrorists today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were filming like recreation's of </v>

2194
01:28:29.931 --> 01:28:30.764
<v Speaker 1>like Abbie Hoffman and his American tee </v>
<v Speaker 1>shirt being waterboarded by CIA agents </v>

2195
01:28:35.541 --> 01:28:36.374
<v Speaker 1>because if we applied to the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>anti-terror to the way that the </v>

2196
01:28:38.841 --> 01:28:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Americans and they out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

2197
01:28:42.261 --> 01:28:43.094
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of red southern states </v>

2198
01:28:44.871 --> 01:28:48.080
<v Speaker 1>that would not go for that and all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys and you wanted hardcore.</v>

2199
01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:49.220
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's no,</v>

2200
01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:50.083
<v Speaker 1>they didn't really want hardcore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to get me through the doors </v>

2201
01:28:52.251 --> 01:28:54.470
<v Speaker 1>and then we're going to make some group </v>
<v Speaker 1>think thing,</v>

2202
01:28:54.471 --> 01:28:56.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the group or no effort in group think</v>

2203
01:28:56.991 --> 01:28:57.824
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well group think would be fine if you </v>

2204
01:28:59.191 --> 01:29:03.330
<v Speaker 1>respected all the think in the group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think if they were all as good as you.</v>

2205
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:07.050
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the sensibility that not</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of these people,</v>

2206
01:29:07.051 --> 01:29:09.600
<v Speaker 1>most of them were kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From my standpoint as an old man,</v>

2207
01:29:09.601 --> 01:29:12.060
<v Speaker 1>now they're all counters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're bean counters that are trying to</v>

2208
01:29:12.061 --> 01:29:12.894
<v Speaker 1>protect their own jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they're worried about is the </v>

2209
01:29:14.191 --> 01:29:16.050
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got the dailies in,</v>

2210
01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:17.033
<v Speaker 1>we've got the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got the numbers in your trending </v>

2211
01:29:18.241 --> 01:29:19.074
<v Speaker 1>really well in 18 to 34 Dan Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not about building an audience </v>

2212
01:29:22.230 --> 01:29:23.760
<v Speaker 1>over the long haul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you said,</v>

2213
01:29:23.761 --> 01:29:24.594
<v Speaker 1>it's literally about the next rating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to jump in out of the gate </v>

2214
01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.540
<v Speaker 1>big time and you have to have billboards</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a big push.</v>

2215
01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:32.640
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you notice anytime a show </v>
<v Speaker 1>launches,</v>

2216
01:29:32.850 --> 01:29:33.683
<v Speaker 1>you'll see bill bill board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's this new show called white </v>

2217
01:29:35.911 --> 01:29:38.640
<v Speaker 1>famous and it's on showtime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everywhere you go,</v>

2218
01:29:38.641 --> 01:29:40.890
<v Speaker 1>this is giant billboards for white </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous.</v>

2219
01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.320
<v Speaker 1>They're not letting this thing build </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly.</v>

2220
01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:46.020
<v Speaker 1>They want to push it out of the gate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with gunpowder,</v>

2221
01:29:46.110 --> 01:29:46.943
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're hoping that with that </v>

2222
01:29:49.231 --> 01:29:52.260
<v Speaker 1>momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quality of this show will add to the</v>

2223
01:29:52.261 --> 01:29:53.094
<v Speaker 1>momentum and then you're going to build </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and a bunch of people catch on and </v>

2224
01:29:56.341 --> 01:29:58.680
<v Speaker 1>eventually we'll get rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in order to do that,</v>

2225
01:29:58.681 --> 01:30:01.320
<v Speaker 1>they want to take away all the jagged </v>
<v Speaker 1>edges,</v>

2226
01:30:01.321 --> 01:30:03.990
<v Speaker 1>smooth everything down to make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>aerodynamic,</v>

2227
01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:04.973
<v Speaker 1>make everything like super homogenize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what they do with every </v>

2228
01:30:07.351 --> 01:30:08.050
<v Speaker 1>single city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

2229
01:30:08.050 --> 01:30:08.883
<v Speaker 1>And what they'll do to your career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the last physical fight I almost </v>

2230
01:30:11.251 --> 01:30:14.730
<v Speaker 1>had with another adult male was a radio </v>
<v Speaker 1>program director.</v>

2231
01:30:15.330 --> 01:30:17.580
<v Speaker 1>And the radio program director came into</v>
<v Speaker 1>my town knew,</v>

2232
01:30:17.581 --> 01:30:18.930
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever been in radio,</v>

2233
01:30:18.931 --> 01:30:20.700
<v Speaker 1>when they come into town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew the first thing they're going to do</v>

2234
01:30:20.701 --> 01:30:21.534
<v Speaker 1>is change everything cause they got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>put their own stamp on it or why are </v>

2235
01:30:23.131 --> 01:30:25.080
<v Speaker 1>they there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this guy comes in and he goes,</v>

2236
01:30:25.081 --> 01:30:27.180
<v Speaker 1>we're going to rebrand you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2237
01:30:27.181 --> 01:30:30.450
<v Speaker 1>I want everyone to think of your name </v>
<v Speaker 1>and instantly think of the brand.</v>

2238
01:30:30.451 --> 01:30:31.780
<v Speaker 1>And I'm already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Brian?</v>

2239
01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:32.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2240
01:30:32.281 --> 01:30:33.114
<v Speaker 1>So here's what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I hate to say this because this will </v>

2241
01:30:34.651 --> 01:30:37.230
<v Speaker 1>become a meme online that I will have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>live with the rest of my life.</v>

2242
01:30:37.231 --> 01:30:39.690
<v Speaker 1>But it's an absolutely true story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the guy says to me,</v>

2243
01:30:39.691 --> 01:30:40.480
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2244
01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:41.313
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine a billboard that says Dan </v>

2245
01:30:43.290 --> 01:30:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fucks chickens.</v>

2246
01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:45.930
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me?</v>

2247
01:30:45.931 --> 01:30:46.381
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2248
01:30:46.381 --> 01:30:47.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that anytime anybody thought,</v>

2249
01:30:47.941 --> 01:30:48.511
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would think,</v>

2250
01:30:48.511 --> 01:30:49.344
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he used the chicken fucker and I'm </v>

2251
01:30:50.011 --> 01:30:50.880
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

2252
01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really said yes,</v>

2253
01:30:52.441 --> 01:30:53.340
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said to him,</v>

2254
01:30:53.341 --> 01:30:54.600
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said two things,</v>

2255
01:30:54.601 --> 01:30:55.530
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2256
01:30:55.531 --> 01:30:57.630
<v Speaker 1>the first thing is I got to live in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>town,</v>

2257
01:30:57.780 --> 01:30:58.613
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so really you want that to be the first </v>

2258
01:30:59.701 --> 01:31:00.690
<v Speaker 1>thing people think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2259
01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:01.553
<v Speaker 1>The second thing is I got to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>career after this stupid idea of yours </v>

2260
01:31:04.531 --> 01:31:08.970
<v Speaker 1>fails to understand where we're building</v>
<v Speaker 1>up a mental image.</v>

2261
01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:10.350
<v Speaker 1>You'll be a household name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2262
01:31:10.351 --> 01:31:11.520
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be the household name.</v>

2263
01:31:11.521 --> 01:31:13.100
<v Speaker 1>The guy who fucks chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2264
01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:15.020
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finding,</v>

2265

<v Speaker 1>he was.</v>

2266
01:31:15.391 --> 01:31:16.470
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find these guys.</v>

2267
01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:17.460
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2268
01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:18.293
<v Speaker 1>do you want to step outside right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean my wife laughed at me </v>

2269
01:31:21.091 --> 01:31:22.650
<v Speaker 1>because I'm already an old man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I'm saying,</v>

2270

<v Speaker 1>that would have been great.</v>

2271

01:31:24.091 --> 01:31:25.590
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy was as old as I was,</v>

2273
01:31:25.591 --> 01:31:29.760
<v Speaker 1>but I was so incensed and so angry that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy would,</v>

2274
01:31:29.761 --> 01:31:34.761
<v Speaker 1>would be so cavalier with your future </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being and every family,</v>

2275
01:31:35.401 --> 01:31:36.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my kicker,</v>

2276
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:38.700
<v Speaker 1>how are they going to spell fucker on </v>
<v Speaker 1>billboards?</v>

2277
01:31:38.701 --> 01:31:39.534
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good credit they might </v>

2278
01:31:40.261 --> 01:31:42.240
<v Speaker 1>have had is a euphemism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

2279
01:31:42.241 --> 01:31:43.170
<v Speaker 1>you think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

2280
01:31:43.171 --> 01:31:44.340
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>

2281
01:31:44.341 --> 01:31:47.100
<v Speaker 1>this guy's career depends on him making </v>
<v Speaker 1>a difference.</v>

2282
01:31:47.130 --> 01:31:50.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a tool in his career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2283
01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:54.150
<v Speaker 1>So you start to realize that when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>did the podcast and it's your podcast,</v>

2284
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:57.330
<v Speaker 1>the person that you're worried about </v>
<v Speaker 1>here is you.</v>

2285
01:31:57.570 --> 01:31:59.680
<v Speaker 1>And not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas that are coming from your,</v>

2286
01:31:59.681 --> 01:32:00.130
<v Speaker 1>not just</v>

2287
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:01.720
<v Speaker 3>yours alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you own them.</v>

2288
01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:02.530
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2289
01:32:02.530 --> 01:32:05.260
<v Speaker 3>so when I say something that's stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I own that.</v>

2290
01:32:05.261 --> 01:32:06.940
<v Speaker 3>It's not like some stations said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2291
01:32:06.941 --> 01:32:07.840
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't push.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2292
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:08.703
<v Speaker 3>I got to know fight over the Oj Simpson </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing when the Oj Simpson trials going </v>

2293
01:32:11.171 --> 01:32:12.940
<v Speaker 3>on and everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all you hear anywhere.</v>

2294
01:32:12.970 --> 01:32:13.803
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they got on me about not talking </v>

2295
01:32:16.451 --> 01:32:19.930
<v Speaker 3>about it and I had a big fight and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>walked into the studio and I said,</v>

2296
01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:20.860
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll talk about it.</v>

2297
01:32:20.861 --> 01:32:21.700
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2298
01:32:21.730 --> 01:32:23.500
<v Speaker 3>the whole topic was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it just too much?</v>

2299
01:32:23.501 --> 01:32:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Damn Oj Simpson everywhere you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh they were.</v>

2300
01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:27.520
<v Speaker 3>They were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were at the,</v>

2301
01:32:27.521 --> 01:32:28.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a window.</v>

2302
01:32:28.811 --> 01:32:30.550
<v Speaker 3>We were like zoo creatures and they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>this window.</v>

2303
01:32:30.551 --> 01:32:31.384
<v Speaker 3>They could bring all the sales clients </v>
<v Speaker 3>to watch us perform and I'm doing there </v>

2304
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:34.833
<v Speaker 3>and there's like five executives in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>window just waiting till the next </v>

2305
01:32:36.971 --> 01:32:38.310
<v Speaker 3>commercial break because we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>

2306
01:32:38.311 --> 01:32:40.660
<v Speaker 3>we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean that's why radio was so awful</v>

2307
01:32:40.661 --> 01:32:41.980
<v Speaker 3>for me and I didn't get fired.</v>

2308
01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:44.440
<v Speaker 3>I must have done a good enough job to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stay employed,</v>

2309
01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:47.740
<v Speaker 3>but it was go home and pull your hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] intention.</v>

2310
01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:50.740
<v Speaker 3>Constant 10 imagine this is a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>example for people.</v>

2311
01:32:50.741 --> 01:32:52.510
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you're a painting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a picture.</v>

2312
01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:53.373
<v Speaker 3>You had an idea to paint the Mona Lisa </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you got a bunch of people standing </v>

2313
01:32:55.751 --> 01:32:56.680
<v Speaker 3>over your shoulder like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2314
01:32:56.681 --> 01:32:58.510
<v Speaker 3>make her no small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly right.</v>

2315
01:32:58.570 --> 01:32:59.081
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to,</v>

2316
01:32:59.081 --> 01:33:01.690
<v Speaker 3>her eyebrows are too bushy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She looks to Italian and I'm like,</v>

2317
01:33:02.930 --> 01:33:06.940
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're dealing with these things that</v>

2318
01:33:06.941 --> 01:33:09.490
<v Speaker 3>are just essentially trying to justify </v>
<v Speaker 3>their jobs,</v>

2319
01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:11.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're always having that </v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever you're,</v>

2320
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:14.410
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with any sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>executive position and one of the things</v>

2321
01:33:14.411 --> 01:33:17.770
<v Speaker 3>that you realize is how many people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>unnecessary.</v>

2322
01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:18.753
<v Speaker 3>I did Bill Simmons Show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know Bill Simmons had a successful </v>

2323
01:33:21.521 --> 01:33:22.354
<v Speaker 3>podcast and that podcast that led to an </v>
<v Speaker 3>hbo show and I had a great time on the </v>

2324
01:33:25.991 --> 01:33:26.350
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

2325
01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:27.190
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2326
01:33:27.191 --> 01:33:28.420
<v Speaker 3>I like him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's very nice guy,</v>

2327
01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:31.000
<v Speaker 3>very smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when I did his show,</v>

2328
01:33:31.001 --> 01:33:33.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a hundred people working here.</v>

2329
01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:37.060
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking people everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get that you need cameraman.</v>

2330
01:33:37.090 --> 01:33:37.923
<v Speaker 3>I get the need sound men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then who are all these other </v>

2331
01:33:39.611 --> 01:33:40.444
<v Speaker 3>fuckers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got all these executive type people </v>

2332
01:33:42.851 --> 01:33:45.300
<v Speaker 3>and office people and all these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>running around.</v>

2333
01:33:45.310 --> 01:33:46.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>

2334
01:33:46.421 --> 01:33:47.254
<v Speaker 3>you've made this way too complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the reason why his podcast is so </v>

2335
01:33:50.981 --> 01:33:54.340
<v Speaker 3>successful is because it's him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's his singular vision.</v>

2336
01:33:54.341 --> 01:33:55.380
<v Speaker 3>His idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2337
01:33:55.381 --> 01:33:56.214
<v Speaker 3>you're getting it from this person and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you know that you're getting </v>

2338
01:33:58.661 --> 01:34:01.660
<v Speaker 3>something from a person and you like how</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy thinks,</v>

2339
01:34:01.810 --> 01:34:02.643
<v Speaker 3>then it becomes interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you're not really getting it </v>

2340
01:34:05.231 --> 01:34:07.420
<v Speaker 3>from that person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got a bunch of people holding cue</v>

2341
01:34:07.421 --> 01:34:12.421
<v Speaker 3>cards and standing behind them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're creating this bullshit thing.</v>

2342
01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:13.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife said today we're,</v>

2343
01:34:13.841 --> 01:34:14.674
<v Speaker 3>we're in the hotel room and she turns on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the TV and Ryan seacrest is on and he'd </v>

2344
01:34:17.821 --> 01:34:18.790
<v Speaker 3>liked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does 10,000</v>

2345
01:34:18.791 --> 01:34:19.640
<v Speaker 3>things a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2346
01:34:19.690 --> 01:34:20.920
<v Speaker 3>multiple shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she says,</v>

2347
01:34:21.130 --> 01:34:21.963
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how he does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing that he can do all these </v>

2348
01:34:23.021 --> 01:34:23.840
<v Speaker 3>kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2349
01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:26.750
<v Speaker 3>how much of it's really Ryan seacrest's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean how you,</v>

2350
01:34:26.770 --> 01:34:27.603
<v Speaker 3>you basically have to have everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>ready to go when you walk into a room </v>

2351
01:34:29.891 --> 01:34:30.724
<v Speaker 3>and who did that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I like listening to Ryan </v>

2352
01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:32.933
<v Speaker 3>seacrest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like listening to him on the radio </v>

2353
01:34:34.810 --> 01:34:35.643
<v Speaker 3>because it's almost like listening to an</v>
<v Speaker 3>alien that tries to be like a woman </v>

2354
01:34:41.141 --> 01:34:46.141
<v Speaker 3>who's a secretary because he does these </v>
<v Speaker 3>contests like cola call in right now and</v>

2355
01:34:47.681 --> 01:34:48.191
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2356
01:34:48.191 --> 01:34:49.024
<v Speaker 3>have someone to call him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the nagging or whack and then I </v>

2357
01:34:51.821 --> 01:34:54.160
<v Speaker 3>can go to the bathroom and look at my </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>

2358
01:34:54.190 --> 01:34:55.360
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody likes that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>nice talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2364
01:35:01.581 --> 01:35:03.680
<v Speaker 4>he's not even a fucking human on those </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

2365
01:35:03.681 --> 01:35:08.681
<v Speaker 4>It's like he's figured out a way to hit </v>
<v Speaker 4>this wall,</v>

2366
01:35:09.410 --> 01:35:14.410
<v Speaker 4>this droning sound that resonates with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that live in that existence.</v>

2367
01:35:14.731 --> 01:35:15.564
<v Speaker 4>So the people that are stuck in traffic </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that checking their phone every 15 </v>

2368
01:35:17.991 --> 01:35:18.824
<v Speaker 4>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are the people that are on </v>

2369
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:21.650
<v Speaker 4>instagram 35 times a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2370
01:35:21.651 --> 01:35:22.484
<v Speaker 4>That's the average amount of time a </v>
<v Speaker 4>person looks at instagram 35 times a </v>

2371
01:35:26.301 --> 01:35:28.280
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wool wool,</v>

2372
01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:30.290
<v Speaker 4>Ryan seacrest fucks chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

2373
01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:31.850
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he fuck chickens,</v>

2374
01:35:31.851 --> 01:35:34.830
<v Speaker 4>he would be like outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that would be like that.</v>

2375
01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:36.860
<v Speaker 4>The guy who said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be the chicken fucker.</v>

2376
01:35:37.130 --> 01:35:38.630
<v Speaker 4>He probably listened to Howard Stern.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2377
01:35:38.631 --> 01:35:39.464
<v Speaker 4>this guy is outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need to get Dan Carlin to be </v>

2378
01:35:41.001 --> 01:35:42.280
<v Speaker 4>outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a chicken farmer.</v>

2379
01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:43.320
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I it,</v>

2380
01:35:43.321 --> 01:35:45.420
<v Speaker 5>that is the other thing with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>homogenization talked to,</v>

2381
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:48.630
<v Speaker 5>it's always about imitating somebody </v>
<v Speaker 5>who's found a good formula.</v>

2382
01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:50.633
<v Speaker 5>I will say this about limbo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Limbo is right when he says that there </v>

2383
01:35:52.261 --> 01:35:55.320
<v Speaker 5>will be a wing in the talk radio museum </v>
<v Speaker 5>devoted to him one day,</v>

2384
01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:57.000
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what he always says,</v>

2385
01:35:57.210 --> 01:35:58.043
<v Speaker 5>which I find interesting is he tried to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do what he does now multiple times and </v>

2386
01:36:01.141 --> 01:36:04.560
<v Speaker 5>got fired because their attitude was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is the way and we're not taking any</v>

2387
01:36:04.561 --> 01:36:05.760
<v Speaker 5>chances with this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he says,</v>

2388
01:36:05.761 --> 01:36:06.594
<v Speaker 5>the minute I'm successful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every consultant out there is telling </v>

2389
01:36:09.121 --> 01:36:11.190
<v Speaker 5>everybody to be as just like him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

2390
01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:13.530
<v Speaker 5>if you really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you're a podcast are out there,</v>

2391
01:36:13.531 --> 01:36:15.420
<v Speaker 5>are thinking about doing something in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the new media,</v>

2392
01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:19.890
<v Speaker 5>understand that there is something so </v>
<v Speaker 5>valuable about what you specifically are</v>

2393
01:36:19.891 --> 01:36:21.030
<v Speaker 5>bringing to the table.</v>

2394
01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:23.340
<v Speaker 5>And the minute you ask these other </v>
<v Speaker 5>people what to do,</v>

2395
01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:25.830
<v Speaker 5>they're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't know what specific about it.</v>

2396
01:36:25.831 --> 01:36:26.850
<v Speaker 5>They're going to go and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2397
01:36:26.851 --> 01:36:29.910
<v Speaker 5>we can pull a little piece of what this </v>
<v Speaker 5>person does and eventually it's not even</v>

2398
01:36:29.911 --> 01:36:31.800
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the great things I always thought</v>

2399
01:36:31.801 --> 01:36:35.520
<v Speaker 5>about hardcore history is that over time</v>
<v Speaker 5>you self select your audience.</v>

2400
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:38.310
<v Speaker 5>I think you do that with every podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you say something like,</v>

2401
01:36:38.311 --> 01:36:39.144
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm only going to talk about the stuff </v>

2402
01:36:39.541 --> 01:36:40.374
<v Speaker 5>I'm interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well what you know then a year later is </v>

2403
01:36:42.271 --> 01:36:45.780
<v Speaker 5>whatever fans are listening to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a pretty good gauge because they're</v>

2404
01:36:45.781 --> 01:36:48.360
<v Speaker 5>there because they like what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I don't have to sit there and go,</v>

2405
01:36:48.510 --> 01:36:50.070
<v Speaker 5>gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this would be a popular topic.</v>

2406
01:36:50.071 --> 01:36:50.904
<v Speaker 5>I just do what I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And over time you developed an audience </v>

2407
01:36:53.761 --> 01:36:54.810
<v Speaker 5>that likes that.</v>

2408
01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:59.050
<v Speaker 4>I also think that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening when you do have this sing,</v>

2409
01:36:59.170 --> 01:37:02.380
<v Speaker 4>when you have a singular vision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like one person who's,</v>

2410
01:37:02.410 --> 01:37:04.570
<v Speaker 4>who's driving this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2411
01:37:05.230 --> 01:37:10.230
<v Speaker 4>And over time I feel like people get a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense of you in a way deeper sense.</v>

2412
01:37:11.651 --> 01:37:14.950
<v Speaker 4>And just listening to your words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're chunking data,</v>

2413
01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:17.950
<v Speaker 4>they're adding up all of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>communication that you've had.</v>

2414
01:37:17.951 --> 01:37:18.784
<v Speaker 4>They're seeing how you add,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're analyzing how you see different </v>

2415
01:37:23.081 --> 01:37:26.080
<v Speaker 4>scenarios.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're analyzing how you,</v>

2416
01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:30.190
<v Speaker 4>how you navigate certain and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing you when you're tired and they're</v>

2417
01:37:30.191 --> 01:37:33.550
<v Speaker 4>seeing you the way you're feeling in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>great mood and then maybe they're seeing</v>

2418
01:37:33.551 --> 01:37:35.440
<v Speaker 4>you when something bad happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't feel so good.</v>

2419
01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:35.951
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2420
01:37:35.951 --> 01:37:36.784
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2421
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:37.623
<v Speaker 4>and all this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they get to know you and there's </v>

2422
01:37:39.941 --> 01:37:41.350
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there they,</v>

2423
01:37:41.470 --> 01:37:44.110
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an intimate understanding of you</v>

2424
01:37:44.111 --> 01:37:44.944
<v Speaker 4>that is almost impossible to get when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're hosting the tonight show or </v>

2425
01:37:47.801 --> 01:37:49.480
<v Speaker 4>you're acting in a television show</v>

2426
01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:53.270
<v Speaker 5>or doing a five minute piece of content </v>
<v Speaker 5>opposed to a three hour piece of cotton.</v>

2427
01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:54.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a weird thing.</v>

2428
01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 4>I think that's one</v>

2429
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:58.380
<v Speaker 3>of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if people know me,</v>

2430
01:37:58.650 --> 01:38:00.090
<v Speaker 3>if you listen to his podcast long </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>

2431
01:38:00.091 --> 01:38:00.924
<v Speaker 3>you know me and you might not agree with</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and you might think I'm wrong or I'm </v>

2432
01:38:04.261 --> 01:38:06.030
<v Speaker 3>a blowhard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2433
01:38:06.031 --> 01:38:07.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2434
01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:08.161
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2435
01:38:08.161 --> 01:38:11.280
<v Speaker 3>I might be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll tell you if I think I'm wrong,</v>

2436
01:38:11.310 --> 01:38:13.560
<v Speaker 3>if I think I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the first person go,</v>

2437
01:38:13.890 --> 01:38:15.220
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2438
01:38:15.221 --> 01:38:16.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going to cover that up.</v>

2439
01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:18.840
<v Speaker 3>And you shouldn't believe people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think they're wrong.</v>

2440
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:21.300
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not good for you either.</v>

2441
01:38:21.301 --> 01:38:22.134
<v Speaker 3>The person who pulls it off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not good for you because you know </v>

2442
01:38:23.551 --> 01:38:24.384
<v Speaker 3>you're wrong and you're know you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>carrying that shit around your head all </v>

2443
01:38:26.071 --> 01:38:27.090
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Though I always say,</v>

2444
01:38:27.091 --> 01:38:29.330
<v Speaker 3>if you think if people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is again why,</v>

2445
01:38:29.331 --> 01:38:30.164
<v Speaker 3>why one of my current events,</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasts is not really happening right </v>

2446
01:38:32.251 --> 01:38:33.084
<v Speaker 3>now because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like when you're in absolutely </v>

2447
01:38:35.491 --> 01:38:38.040
<v Speaker 3>uncharted water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't know what's going on.</v>

2448
01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:41.940
<v Speaker 3>So that's how you feel right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're in uncharted and I think,</v>

2449
01:38:41.941 --> 01:38:43.100
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a combination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone,</v>

2450
01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:44.520
<v Speaker 3>everyone always thinks it's a trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

2451
01:38:44.521 --> 01:38:45.810
<v Speaker 3>but to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump is a vector.</v>

2452
01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:46.893
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

2453
01:38:47.070 --> 01:38:50.370
<v Speaker 3>what you were talking about with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>social media is as much a part of,</v>

2454
01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:51.253
<v Speaker 3>of what makes this an absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>unprecedented time and a bunch of other </v>

2455
01:38:54.751 --> 01:38:57.150
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The globalization of the earth.</v>

2456
01:38:57.151 --> 01:38:58.030
<v Speaker 3>Like you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2457
01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:00.570
<v Speaker 3>we're doing shows and hearing from </v>
<v Speaker 3>people from other countries,</v>

2458
01:39:00.571 --> 01:39:01.404
<v Speaker 3>I mean all this stuff interacting </v>
<v Speaker 3>together has created an absolutely </v>

2459
01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:05.453
<v Speaker 3>unprecedented situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe I just organize my thinking </v>

2460
01:39:08.371 --> 01:39:09.204
<v Speaker 3>differently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I organize it historically and </v>

2461
01:39:10.201 --> 01:39:14.130
<v Speaker 3>there's no way to put this into any box </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's ever existed before.</v>

2462
01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:15.293
<v Speaker 3>So when I watched these talk shows or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever with people who have no </v>

2463
01:39:17.911 --> 01:39:19.050
<v Speaker 3>choice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's 6:00</v>

2464
01:39:19.050 --> 01:39:19.883
<v Speaker 3>PM I have to be on the air and I have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have something to say to rile the </v>

2465
01:39:21.571 --> 01:39:22.110
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>

2466
01:39:22.110 --> 01:39:23.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2467
01:39:23.370 --> 01:39:24.960
<v Speaker 3>they have no options.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to,</v>

2468
01:39:25.110 --> 01:39:26.910
<v Speaker 3>their Gig is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what's going on in,</v>

2469
01:39:26.911 --> 01:39:27.744
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if they were honest with </v>

2470
01:39:29.251 --> 01:39:30.990
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they either would have to say,</v>

2471
01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:32.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's going on and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching too.</v>

2472
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:35.430
<v Speaker 3>Or if they really do believe they know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on,</v>

2473
01:39:35.730 --> 01:39:37.650
<v Speaker 3>well then you really shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>listened to them at all.</v>

2474
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:40.620
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there is no way they could,</v>

2475
01:39:40.650 --> 01:39:42.170
<v Speaker 3>there's no way they could know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2476
01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:43.073
<v Speaker 3>I think we're dealing with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ramifications of a bunch of different </v>

2477
01:39:45.061 --> 01:39:46.550
<v Speaker 3>pieces that are in play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2478
01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:47.393
<v Speaker 3>And I think one of those pieces that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in play and one of the reasons why </v>

2479
01:39:49.441 --> 01:39:52.770
<v Speaker 3>you see so much bitterness and anger and</v>
<v Speaker 3>social media and you know,</v>

2480
01:39:52.771 --> 01:39:53.604
<v Speaker 3>we talked about this mechanism that </v>
<v Speaker 3>social media allows people to </v>

2481
01:39:56.521 --> 01:39:57.354
<v Speaker 3>communicate in this really cruel way </v>
<v Speaker 3>without experiencing that person right </v>

2482
01:40:00.331 --> 01:40:00.870
<v Speaker 3>in front of you.</v>

2483
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:02.790
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think one of the reasons why these</v>

2484
01:40:02.791 --> 01:40:03.624
<v Speaker 3>people have this deep seated anger and </v>
<v Speaker 3>resentment is there's a bunch of people </v>

2485
01:40:06.331 --> 01:40:07.164
<v Speaker 3>out there that have these lives that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>deeply unsatisfying because I think </v>

2486
01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:12.893
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another through momentum and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just through just things falling into </v>

2487
01:40:16.741 --> 01:40:17.574
<v Speaker 3>place the way they are and people trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fit their lives around the way these </v>

2488
01:40:20.791 --> 01:40:21.624
<v Speaker 3>pieces have fallen into place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are so many people that are </v>

2489
01:40:23.791 --> 01:40:28.791
<v Speaker 3>working all day long doing something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is deeply unsatisfying and,</v>

2490
01:40:29.210 --> 01:40:31.210
<v Speaker 3>and almost painful to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2491
01:40:31.211 --> 01:40:32.610
<v Speaker 3>Soul killing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>soul killing.</v>

2492
01:40:32.611 --> 01:40:33.444
<v Speaker 3>They're stuck in traffic all day and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they're stuck in a cubicle after </v>

2493
01:40:36.151 --> 01:40:37.020
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2494
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.670
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2495
01:40:37.670 --> 01:40:41.490
<v Speaker 3>they relish the time to take a shit in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bathroom and look at their phone.</v>

2496
01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:42.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they literally do that.</v>

2497
01:40:42.871 --> 01:40:46.980
<v Speaker 3>That's a highlight of someone's day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get in traffic on the way home.</v>

2498
01:40:46.981 --> 01:40:47.814
<v Speaker 3>They get home after that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're watching television and they're </v>

2499
01:40:49.471 --> 01:40:51.450
<v Speaker 3>fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have deep debt.</v>

2500
01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 3>This is not like there's this soul </v>
<v Speaker 3>killing thing is not giving</v>

2501
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:55.690
<v Speaker 1>them any three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's huge and you know what?</v>

2502
01:40:55.730 --> 01:40:56.563
<v Speaker 1>You just sit there and go in and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at what people make and you sit </v>

2503
01:40:58.121 --> 01:40:58.954
<v Speaker 1>there and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make quite a lot of money by </v>

2504
01:41:01.481 --> 01:41:04.700
<v Speaker 1>average Joe Standards and still not be </v>
<v Speaker 1>in good shape.</v>

2505
01:41:05.050 --> 01:41:07.090
<v Speaker 1>So I know people turn around and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>good living,</v>

2506
01:41:07.091 --> 01:41:08.410
<v Speaker 1>really good living and turn around and </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

2507
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:11.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm just holding my head above water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you go,</v>

2508
01:41:11.111 --> 01:41:13.210
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're holding your head just barely,</v>

2509
01:41:13.450 --> 01:41:16.690
<v Speaker 1>what's a person making a third or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter of what you're making doing?</v>

2510
01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:18.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really,</v>

2511
01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:19.143
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about revolutions </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in [inaudible] and things </v>

2512
01:41:21.641 --> 01:41:23.410
<v Speaker 1>going down in weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable,</v>

2513
01:41:23.411 --> 01:41:26.080
<v Speaker 1>negative ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and we've talked about this before,</v>

2514
01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:27.033
<v Speaker 1>you let enough of your society fall into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the loser class for lack of a better </v>

2515
01:41:30.821 --> 01:41:32.380
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>winners and losers in society.</v>

2516
01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:33.453
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every society can suck up a certain </v>

2517
01:41:34.961 --> 01:41:38.830
<v Speaker 1>amount of people not able to to make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if that number gets large enough,</v>

2518
01:41:39.070 --> 01:41:40.060
<v Speaker 1>revolutions happen.</v>

2519
01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:41.073
<v Speaker 1>I think so too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the revolution doesn't </v>

2520
01:41:42.251 --> 01:41:43.084
<v Speaker 1>necessarily have to be violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the revolution can be a </v>

2521
01:41:45.221 --> 01:41:46.054
<v Speaker 1>revolution of action and ideas and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that there's a ton of people out </v>

2522
01:41:48.611 --> 01:41:49.444
<v Speaker 1>there that are probably listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this that would like to be able to do </v>

2523
01:41:51.911 --> 01:41:54.340
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's make furniture,</v>

2524
01:41:54.370 --> 01:41:55.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want a revolution.</v>

2525
01:41:55.481 --> 01:41:56.950
<v Speaker 1>They want to do something that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>sold.</v>

2526
01:41:57.670 --> 01:42:00.790
<v Speaker 1>If you make furniture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make furniture for a living and you,</v>

2527
01:42:00.791 --> 01:42:04.030
<v Speaker 1>you feel a great satisfaction out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and you sell that furniture.</v>

2528
01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Look man for making furniture feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2529
01:42:06.670 --> 01:42:07.750
<v Speaker 1>If you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

2530
01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:08.703
<v Speaker 1>you could cut those corners perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sand everything down nice and stain </v>

2531
01:42:11.471 --> 01:42:12.304
<v Speaker 1>it and then it's done and you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissatisfied and you sell it to someone </v>

2532
01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:15.633
<v Speaker 1>and that pays your bills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is infinitely more satisfying than </v>

2533
01:42:18.941 --> 01:42:19.774
<v Speaker 1>being stuck in some fucking cubicle </v>
<v Speaker 1>working for someone that you don't want </v>

2534
01:42:21.851 --> 01:42:22.510
<v Speaker 1>to work for.</v>

2535
01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Having to have these stupid fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>office meetings,</v>

2536
01:42:24.791 --> 01:42:29.080
<v Speaker 1>talking to people in human resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting down with your supervisor,</v>

2537
01:42:29.081 --> 01:42:31.960
<v Speaker 1>where they evaluate your job performance</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2538
01:42:31.961 --> 01:42:32.890
<v Speaker 1>you're not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2539
01:42:32.930 --> 01:42:36.100
<v Speaker 1>you really need to be enthusiastic about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this company,</v>

2540
01:42:36.101 --> 01:42:37.890
<v Speaker 1>this company is your future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This kind of like,</v>

2541
01:42:37.891 --> 01:42:38.830
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2542
01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:40.270
<v Speaker 1>kill me now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2543
01:42:40.271 --> 01:42:43.150
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people out there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would way rather do something else.</v>

2544
01:42:43.151 --> 01:42:45.940
<v Speaker 1>And I hope they understand that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

2545
01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:47.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's funny about that cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were in,</v>

2546
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:51.610
<v Speaker 1>because we've been talking about us and </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasting in new medium,</v>

2547
01:42:51.611 --> 01:42:52.180
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2548
01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:53.200
<v Speaker 1>but really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I tell,</v>

2549
01:42:53.201 --> 01:42:55.150
<v Speaker 1>I give,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I rarely like to give advice because you</v>

2550
01:42:55.151 --> 01:42:55.984
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't wanna you don't wanna be </v>

2551
01:42:56.291 --> 01:42:58.870
<v Speaker 1>responsible for people acting on it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>having it not turn out well.</v>

2552
01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:00.880
<v Speaker 1>But what I tell people is two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>

2553
01:43:00.881 --> 01:43:01.714
<v Speaker 1>the United States of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it's built is built to help </v>

2554
01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:08.140
<v Speaker 1>industry and corporations and companies.</v>

2555
01:43:08.410 --> 01:43:10.720
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't necessarily mean it has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be Microsoft.</v>

2556
01:43:10.721 --> 01:43:12.020
<v Speaker 1>It can be you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2557
01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:12.933
<v Speaker 1>You can have your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let's talk about the furniture </v>

2558
01:43:14.801 --> 01:43:15.850
<v Speaker 1>builder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once upon a time,</v>

2559
01:43:15.851 --> 01:43:16.684
<v Speaker 1>there are huge things in your way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including needing to get loans and all </v>

2560
01:43:19.631 --> 01:43:21.250
<v Speaker 1>these other things to just start a </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

2561
01:43:21.370 --> 01:43:23.840
<v Speaker 1>So you're behind the eight ball right </v>
<v Speaker 1>away and the pressures on,</v>

2562
01:43:23.841 --> 01:43:24.940
<v Speaker 1>because if it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in debt.</v>

2563
01:43:25.210 --> 01:43:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Whereas we started these podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no brick or mortar.</v>

2564
01:43:28.391 --> 01:43:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you've got just the,</v>

2565
01:43:29.630 --> 01:43:30.970
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Rogan Tower.</v>

2566
01:43:30.971 --> 01:43:31.804
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once upon a time it's like in the </v>

2567
01:43:33.701 --> 01:43:34.534
<v Speaker 1>back of your bedroom and you've got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>company and it's got a show and people </v>

2568
01:43:36.371 --> 01:43:38.560
<v Speaker 1>are listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you make your furniture and you don't</v>

2569
01:43:38.561 --> 01:43:41.110
<v Speaker 1>have to have a brick and mortar store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can put a website up,</v>

2570
01:43:41.330 --> 01:43:43.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it with squarespace or one of those</v>

2571
01:43:43.301 --> 01:43:46.810
<v Speaker 1>other things and all of a sudden you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a business out of your house.</v>

2572
01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:49.510
<v Speaker 1>The freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the satisfaction,</v>

2573
01:43:49.630 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 1>the ability to set your own hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the best part,</v>

2574
01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:53.053
<v Speaker 1>the fact that if you start making a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of money somehow you're not going to </v>

2575
01:43:56.061 --> 01:43:56.894
<v Speaker 1>have your boss cut your commissions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I knew sales guys who made so </v>

2576
01:43:59.391 --> 01:44:00.224
<v Speaker 1>much money that their bosses cut their </v>
<v Speaker 1>commissions cause you can't make more </v>

2577
01:44:02.541 --> 01:44:04.400
<v Speaker 1>than your bosses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well listen,</v>

2578
01:44:04.401 --> 01:44:06.530
<v Speaker 1>when you have your own small business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sky is the limit.</v>

2579
01:44:06.531 --> 01:44:09.050
<v Speaker 1>If you make $10 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make $10 million.</v>

2580
01:44:09.370 --> 01:44:10.203
<v Speaker 1>So I always tell people that if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not always something they can </v>

2581
01:44:12.801 --> 01:44:13.634
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you do it on the side when you've </v>

2582
01:44:14.301 --> 01:44:15.134
<v Speaker 1>got your regular job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Starting a small business now in this </v>

2583
01:44:18.021 --> 01:44:21.170
<v Speaker 1>climate that we have right now is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only possible,</v>

2584
01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:25.160
<v Speaker 1>it's not that much of a gamble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if worst comes to worst,</v>

2585
01:44:25.161 --> 01:44:25.994
<v Speaker 1>you didn't invest $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't have starting at all the </v>

2586
01:44:28.671 --> 01:44:29.504
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2587
01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:31.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean that website didn't cost you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

2588
01:44:31.371 --> 01:44:31.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2589
01:44:31.950 --> 01:44:34.220
<v Speaker 1>the investment for the tools you may </v>
<v Speaker 1>have had already.</v>

2590
01:44:34.330 --> 01:44:35.163
<v Speaker 1>Podcasting is a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We make business like my buddy says we </v>

2591
01:44:37.851 --> 01:44:40.610
<v Speaker 1>sell Zeros and ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we do.</v>

2592
01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:41.473
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been never been easier to have a </v>

2593
01:44:42.021 --> 01:44:44.420
<v Speaker 1>website either knows or with companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>like squarespace,</v>

2594
01:44:44.421 --> 01:44:45.254
<v Speaker 1>you can develop a website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could literally build amazing </v>

2595
01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:50.800
<v Speaker 1>website and sell your furniture and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a free online store with it and you</v>

2596
01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:51.673
<v Speaker 1>put you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have these drag and drop user </v>

2597
01:44:53.061 --> 01:44:53.894
<v Speaker 1>interfaces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You use photos and drag them onto their </v>

2598
01:44:55.761 --> 01:44:57.170
<v Speaker 1>sides and in place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

2599
01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Next thing you know you've got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>website,</v>

2600
01:44:58.671 --> 01:45:01.190
<v Speaker 1>so your furniture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whatever the fuck you make,</v>

2601
01:45:01.191 --> 01:45:04.520
<v Speaker 1>whether you make clothes or you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>designing backpacks or there's,</v>

2602
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:08.600
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people out there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have interests and they've never pursued</v>

2603
01:45:08.601 --> 01:45:13.601
<v Speaker 1>those interests because they're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>tired from doing some higher soul suck.</v>

2604
01:45:13.610 --> 01:45:14.443
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to go to work and put your </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort into that and then come home and </v>

2605
01:45:17.301 --> 01:45:18.980
<v Speaker 1>then work for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard.</v>

2606
01:45:18.981 --> 01:45:20.200
<v Speaker 1>But I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2607
01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:21.500
<v Speaker 1>there's a part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

2608
01:45:21.501 --> 01:45:25.130
<v Speaker 1>there's a part of it that once you start</v>
<v Speaker 1>making stuff for yourself,</v>

2609
01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:27.040
<v Speaker 1>that self motivating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2610
01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:27.973
<v Speaker 1>Like I told somebody to start a podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said the first time you get some </v>

2611
01:45:30.141 --> 01:45:33.530
<v Speaker 1>feedback email that will kick you in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rear end to keep doing the pie.</v>

2612
01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:34.850
<v Speaker 1>It becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes,</v>

2613
01:45:34.851 --> 01:45:35.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2614
01:45:35.450 --> 01:45:37.280
<v Speaker 1>life is a verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say.</v>

2615
01:45:37.281 --> 01:45:38.114
<v Speaker 1>And you have to actually act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by acting you change everything in </v>

2616
01:45:41.781 --> 01:45:43.010
<v Speaker 1>your future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2617
01:45:43.011 --> 01:45:44.330
<v Speaker 1>another guy said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great line.</v>

2618
01:45:44.331 --> 01:45:45.164
<v Speaker 1>He said with podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not always how many people are </v>

2619
01:45:46.491 --> 01:45:48.380
<v Speaker 1>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's who they are,</v>

2620
01:45:48.710 --> 01:45:49.543
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my grandmother's philosophy was </v>

2621
01:45:50.781 --> 01:45:52.550
<v Speaker 1>always that you should keep walking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>

2622
01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:53.413
<v Speaker 1>But in her era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking and talking meant going and </v>

2623
01:45:54.801 --> 01:45:58.160
<v Speaker 1>shaking people's hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now you can network like through the</v>

2624
01:45:58.161 --> 01:46:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Internet and you never really shaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's hands.</v>

2625
01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:02.780
<v Speaker 1>But you may have a podcast for the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred listeners,</v>

2626
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:05.480
<v Speaker 1>but if one of those listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just some guy somewhere else who says,</v>

2627
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:07.340
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's furniture is great,</v>

2628
01:46:07.341 --> 01:46:08.450
<v Speaker 1>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

2629
01:46:08.510 --> 01:46:09.343
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can come and start giving a </v>

2630
01:46:10.251 --> 01:46:11.840
<v Speaker 1>pottery barn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2631
01:46:11.841 --> 01:46:12.674
<v Speaker 1>Things open up in ways that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>predict because you started doing </v>

2632
01:46:15.531 --> 01:46:16.364
<v Speaker 1>something and because you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate passion for what you can in </v>

2633
01:46:19.081 --> 01:46:21.050
<v Speaker 1>that resonates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't it feel experience that?</v>

2634
01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they seem fine.</v>

2635
01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:23.473
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you how many artists that </v>

2636
01:46:24.531 --> 01:46:28.370
<v Speaker 1>I've discovered online just through </v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram or through twitter,</v>

2637
01:46:28.371 --> 01:46:31.340
<v Speaker 1>like this isn't sent me to creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution in a,</v>

2638
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:33.410
<v Speaker 1>in an amazing way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hope,</v>

2639
01:46:33.530 --> 01:46:36.260
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's way more creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>people out there,</v>

2640
01:46:36.261 --> 01:46:37.340
<v Speaker 1>then we realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>

2641
01:46:37.341 --> 01:46:39.590
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think they would love to have some</v>

2642
01:46:39.591 --> 01:46:41.030
<v Speaker 1>sort of an opportunity to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2643
01:46:41.031 --> 01:46:43.040
<v Speaker 1>And especially like an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who is an artist,</v>

2644
01:46:43.250 --> 01:46:44.083
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's never been a better time to be </v>

2645
01:46:45.021 --> 01:46:47.840
<v Speaker 1>an artist because you could showcase </v>
<v Speaker 1>your work and,</v>

2646
01:46:47.841 --> 01:46:48.830
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and look,</v>

2647
01:46:48.831 --> 01:46:50.220
<v Speaker 1>if you send me something cool</v>

2648
01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:53.920
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he sent it to me on twitter or I'll do,</v>

2649
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.823
<v Speaker 3>we treat things all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all that takes is someone else has </v>

2650
01:46:57.661 --> 01:46:58.471
<v Speaker 3>to see that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2651
01:46:58.471 --> 01:46:59.620
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then two,</v>

2652
01:46:59.621 --> 01:46:59.911
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

2655
01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:01.373

<v Speaker 3>different people's instagram feeds and </v>

<v Speaker 3>all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter feeds.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got a business and you're up and </v>

<v Speaker 3>and it's not going to be quick.</v>

2659
01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.050
<v Speaker 3>But the job you're doing now,</v>

<v Speaker 3>how long is it going to take?</v>

2663
01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:17.573
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know when you start out doing a </v>

2664
01:47:18.721 --> 01:47:20.640
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we got turned downloads,</v>

2665
01:47:20.850 --> 01:47:23.520
<v Speaker 3>well that's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next call where there was,</v>

2666
01:47:23.730 --> 01:47:24.870
<v Speaker 3>I was there once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

2667
01:47:24.871 --> 01:47:25.970
<v Speaker 3>when we first did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we,</v>

2668
01:47:25.971 --> 01:47:26.804
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Brian and I were first doing this </v>

2669
01:47:28.591 --> 01:47:31.320
<v Speaker 3>podcast and we were doing it on like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ustream,</v>

2670
01:47:31.321 --> 01:47:35.970
<v Speaker 3>we would have 200 viewers and I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it for money.</v>

2671
01:47:36.150 --> 01:47:39.810
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was literally doing it because my,</v>

2672
01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:41.033
<v Speaker 3>my wife had gotten pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had to move from Colorado back to La </v>

2673
01:47:44.941 --> 01:47:46.590
<v Speaker 3>and I was bummed out and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

2674
01:47:46.591 --> 01:47:49.830
<v Speaker 3>I thought I escaped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I got out of La,</v>

2675
01:47:49.831 --> 01:47:51.240
<v Speaker 3>I was living in the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2676
01:47:51.241 --> 01:47:52.920
<v Speaker 3>this is what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be in nature.</v>

2677
01:47:53.190 --> 01:47:54.023
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be back in this fucking </v>

2678
01:47:54.751 --> 01:47:56.100
<v Speaker 3>hell hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all right,</v>

2679
01:47:56.101 --> 01:47:56.934
<v Speaker 3>let's do something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we started doing podcasts just </v>

2680
01:47:58.921 --> 01:47:59.754
<v Speaker 3>for a goof cause I was doing stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was all well and good and how it </v>

2681
01:48:02.431 --> 01:48:03.950
<v Speaker 3>tied into your standups on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2682
01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:05.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it started,</v>

2683
01:48:05.971 --> 01:48:06.804
<v Speaker 3>my point is it didn't start out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't start out thinking this is </v>

2684
01:48:09.721 --> 01:48:12.360
<v Speaker 3>going to replace my income.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be,</v>

2685
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:17.390
<v Speaker 3>I just did it as a passion project and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think if people have a regular day job,</v>

2686
01:48:17.581 --> 01:48:18.414
<v Speaker 3>if you could just find some one thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you do as a passion project and </v>

2687
01:48:20.941 --> 01:48:24.780
<v Speaker 3>just keep building on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just keep at cheap watering it,</v>

2688
01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:27.330
<v Speaker 3>keep adding fertilizer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep giving it attention,</v>

2689
01:48:27.331 --> 01:48:28.164
<v Speaker 3>keep giving it focus and you can escape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can escape and you can be self </v>

2690
01:48:31.231 --> 01:48:31.650
<v Speaker 3>serving.</v>

2691
01:48:31.650 --> 01:48:33.240
<v Speaker 3>You could be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be okay.</v>

2692
01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:35.970
<v Speaker 3>I always ask people when they want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>start it like a podcast.</v>

2693
01:48:35.971 --> 01:48:36.804
<v Speaker 3>I'll say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many listeners would you have to </v>

2694
01:48:38.041 --> 01:48:40.140
<v Speaker 3>have for you to care?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2695
01:48:40.690 --> 01:48:42.900
<v Speaker 3>And that's an magic number that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>different for everybody,</v>

2696
01:48:42.901 --> 01:48:43.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2697
01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:44.633
<v Speaker 3>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's great about what we do that's </v>

2698
01:48:46.531 --> 01:48:51.000
<v Speaker 3>different from broadcasting is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a giant pie of people.</v>

2699
01:48:51.001 --> 01:48:51.834
<v Speaker 3>Let's pretend it's a billion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're going to do a podcast on </v>

2700
01:48:56.611 --> 01:48:57.444
<v Speaker 3>science fiction comic books from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>1950s or something that there's such a </v>

2701
01:49:00.421 --> 01:49:01.254
<v Speaker 3>narrow audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd never put it on television </v>

2702
01:49:02.321 --> 01:49:03.480
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too narrow.</v>

2703
01:49:03.810 --> 01:49:07.230
<v Speaker 3>You will be able,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you even get 0.01%</v>

2704
01:49:07.231 --> 01:49:08.064
<v Speaker 3>of that billion pie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not only going to be a decent </v>

2705
01:49:10.231 --> 01:49:13.380
<v Speaker 3>number of people in terms of what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would think is successful,</v>

2706
01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:14.453
<v Speaker 3>but they're going to be so enthusiastic </v>
<v Speaker 3>because this is an outlet that they </v>

2707
01:49:17.791 --> 01:49:19.260
<v Speaker 3>don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I always tell somebody,</v>

2708
01:49:19.261 --> 01:49:21.930
<v Speaker 3>if you're into Harry Potter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the TV networks given you?</v>

2709
01:49:22.170 --> 01:49:24.420
<v Speaker 3>But there's multiple Harry Potter </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasts.</v>

2710
01:49:24.450 --> 01:49:26.060
<v Speaker 3>Listen to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to hear something crazy.</v>

2711
01:49:26.150 --> 01:49:26.983
<v Speaker 3>Time magazine just had some top 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast thing and a buddy of mine who </v>

2712
01:49:30.391 --> 01:49:32.880
<v Speaker 3>was angry that he wasn't on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sent me some stuff about it.</v>

2713
01:49:33.210 --> 01:49:34.470
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things he said,</v>

2714
01:49:34.471 --> 01:49:35.304
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a fucking podcast on there </v>

2715
01:49:36.271 --> 01:49:37.104
<v Speaker 3>called the Gilmore boys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's guys two guys sitting around </v>

2716
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:43.650
<v Speaker 3>talking about the Gilmore Girls </v>
<v Speaker 3>Television show.</v>

2717
01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:47.710
<v Speaker 3>There's another one called something </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Richard Simmons where there's</v>

2718
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:49.540
<v Speaker 4>finding Richardson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Richard Simmons,</v>

2719
01:49:49.810 --> 01:49:53.050
<v Speaker 4>where they're trying to figure out why </v>
<v Speaker 4>Richard Simmons went into hiding.</v>

2720
01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:55.090
<v Speaker 4>What's so great about that idea though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

2721
01:49:55.091 --> 01:49:55.924
<v Speaker 4>and you at home can learn this too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's so great about that idea is that </v>

2722
01:49:58.631 --> 01:50:03.631
<v Speaker 4>they instantly tied their podcast to </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody who already had tons of fan,</v>

2723
01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:05.650
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you sit there and go,</v>

2724
01:50:05.651 --> 01:50:07.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who these guys are or what </v>
<v Speaker 4>this spot,</v>

2725
01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:09.220
<v Speaker 4>but I'm a huge Richard Simmons Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'll listen.</v>

2726
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:12.970
<v Speaker 4>And that's like instant audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't this another podcast called guys?</v>

2727
01:50:12.971 --> 01:50:16.060
<v Speaker 4>We fucked these girls cramp came up with</v>
<v Speaker 4>this podcast.</v>

2728
01:50:16.061 --> 01:50:20.080
<v Speaker 4>And this is one that I always use an as </v>
<v Speaker 4>example because these who were the girls</v>

2729
01:50:20.081 --> 01:50:20.920
<v Speaker 4>from God's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we fucked.</v>

2730
01:50:21.390 --> 01:50:22.240
<v Speaker 4>You see it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Find the names.</v>

2731
01:50:22.610 --> 01:50:23.590
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

2732
01:50:23.591 --> 01:50:25.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>comedians from New York,</v>

2733
01:50:25.061 --> 01:50:27.010
<v Speaker 4>they came and they actually going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the podcast Monday.</v>

2734
01:50:27.730 --> 01:50:29.020
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was a clever tie.</v>

2735
01:50:29.021 --> 01:50:32.620
<v Speaker 4>And I didn't mean to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I used them as an example because,</v>

2736
01:50:32.910 --> 01:50:35.770
<v Speaker 4>cause we just booked this earlier today.</v>

2737
01:50:36.190 --> 01:50:38.140
<v Speaker 4>Christina Hutchinson and Corinne </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>

2738
01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:39.093
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy Curran Fisher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they came up with this clever idea </v>

2739
01:50:41.831 --> 01:50:42.664
<v Speaker 4>for the title and it became huge and me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's always top 10 it's like one of the </v>

2740
01:50:46.841 --> 01:50:49.330
<v Speaker 4>top 10 comedy podcasts and people say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh well too,</v>

2741
01:50:49.331 --> 01:50:51.010
<v Speaker 4>it's a traded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No it's not stupid.</v>

2742
01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:52.750
<v Speaker 4>You just just to do something that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

2743
01:50:52.751 --> 01:50:54.460
<v Speaker 4>Stop saying it's saturated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're good,</v>

2744
01:50:54.461 --> 01:50:57.870
<v Speaker 4>it'll stand out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This idea that [inaudible],</v>

2745
01:50:58.150 --> 01:51:01.270
<v Speaker 4>everybody's got these stupid barriers </v>
<v Speaker 4>they put in their own head.</v>

2746
01:51:01.410 --> 01:51:02.243
<v Speaker 4>You've got to resist those goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 4>things cause they don't do you any good </v>

2747
01:51:04.450 --> 01:51:08.230
<v Speaker 4>and they certainly defined the potential</v>
<v Speaker 4>for your future in a negative way that's</v>

2748
01:51:08.231 --> 01:51:10.630
<v Speaker 4>not self serving and it's not even real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2749
01:51:10.631 --> 01:51:11.051
<v Speaker 4>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've,</v>

2750
01:51:11.051 --> 01:51:11.884
<v Speaker 4>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've put this artificial ceiling on </v>

2751
01:51:13.661 --> 01:51:16.660
<v Speaker 4>the potential for what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you hit a wall,</v>

2752
01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:17.673
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that just means you need to regroup and </v>

2753
01:51:18.761 --> 01:51:20.950
<v Speaker 4>rethink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean that wall's there.</v>

2754
01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:24.610
<v Speaker 4>Especially when it comes to something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like social media or like a podcast,</v>

2755
01:51:24.820 --> 01:51:27.190
<v Speaker 4>something where you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're putting out a piece of art,</v>

2756
01:51:27.191 --> 01:51:28.720
<v Speaker 4>you're putting out something that you've</v>
<v Speaker 4>created.</v>

2757
01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:29.793
<v Speaker 4>There's no wall as far as like how many </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are gonna enjoy it or how far </v>

2758
01:51:32.441 --> 01:51:33.700
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

2759
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:36.820
<v Speaker 4>it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if people don't like it,</v>

2760
01:51:36.821 --> 01:51:39.790
<v Speaker 4>make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they like it less fixed that,</v>

2761
01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:42.310
<v Speaker 4>figure out a way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do that.</v>

2762
01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:43.173
<v Speaker 4>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this idea that there's no way to get </v>

2763
01:51:45.461 --> 01:51:48.400
<v Speaker 4>past the starting block today is just </v>
<v Speaker 4>ludicrous.</v>

2764
01:51:48.401 --> 01:51:49.840
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's just this,</v>

2765
01:51:50.110 --> 01:51:55.030
<v Speaker 4>this poor thinking and people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>trapped in bad situations,</v>

2766
01:51:55.390 --> 01:51:58.810
<v Speaker 4>one of the problems is you feel like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is your future.</v>

2767
01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:00.850
<v Speaker 4>You feel like you're fucked and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't get out of that.</v>

2768
01:52:00.851 --> 01:52:01.684
<v Speaker 4>There's no hope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no light at the end of the </v>

2769
01:52:02.801 --> 01:52:03.190
<v Speaker 4>tunnel.</v>

2770
01:52:03.190 --> 01:52:06.130
<v Speaker 4>There's no rainbow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you feel like that,</v>

2771
01:52:06.131 --> 01:52:09.340
<v Speaker 4>that alone can be incredibly defining </v>
<v Speaker 4>and limiting.</v>

2772
01:52:09.580 --> 01:52:10.413
<v Speaker 4>But if you can look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at yourself objectively and </v>

2773
01:52:12.851 --> 01:52:13.330
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2774
01:52:13.330 --> 01:52:14.890
<v Speaker 4>I Connie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am fucked here.</v>

2775
01:52:15.070 --> 01:52:17.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm in credit card debt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm working in a shitty job.</v>

2776
01:52:18.050 --> 01:52:18.883
<v Speaker 4>I don't like what I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have some ideas I need to feed </v>

2777
01:52:22.781 --> 01:52:25.270
<v Speaker 4>those fucking ideas and that I need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>feed them.</v>

2778
01:52:25.271 --> 01:52:30.010
<v Speaker 4>And water them and I need to set aside a</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain amount of time every day to just</v>

2779
01:52:30.190 --> 01:52:32.890
<v Speaker 4>try to make those things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do that.</v>

2780
01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:35.410
<v Speaker 4>I have a wii.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like visual images.</v>

2781
01:52:35.411 --> 01:52:36.244
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we use that in the hardcore history a </v>

2782
01:52:36.641 --> 01:52:36.921
<v Speaker 4>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These,</v>

2783
01:52:36.921 --> 01:52:38.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's it like to fight an elephant with</v>

2784
01:52:38.321 --> 01:52:39.650
<v Speaker 4>a spear and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

2785
01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:41.950
<v Speaker 4>but the image to die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what it's like.</v>

2786
01:52:42.330 --> 01:52:44.260
<v Speaker 4>The image I have though for what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>

2787
01:52:44.261 --> 01:52:45.980
<v Speaker 4>I've always thought it's a little like a</v>

2788
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:50.330
<v Speaker 5>running back in football who takes the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ball and who goes forward and there's no</v>

2789
01:52:50.331 --> 01:52:50.871
<v Speaker 5>hole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2790
01:52:50.871 --> 01:52:53.000
<v Speaker 5>All you run into is the back of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>offensive linemen,</v>

2791
01:52:53.001 --> 01:52:56.370
<v Speaker 5>but if you keep hitting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if a hole is going to open up,</v>

2792
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:57.410
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll squirt through.</v>

2793
01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:59.630
<v Speaker 5>Now there's no guarantee in life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole will be there.</v>

2794
01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:02.720
<v Speaker 5>But there is a guarantee that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>not continually smacking at it,</v>

2795
01:53:02.930 --> 01:53:04.340
<v Speaker 5>then when it opens up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you won't be ready.</v>

2796
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:05.150
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2797
01:53:05.150 --> 01:53:06.620
<v Speaker 5>And so I don't know about you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe.</v>

2798
01:53:06.621 --> 01:53:08.960
<v Speaker 5>You've had a charmed life I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and how well you've done.</v>

2799
01:53:08.961 --> 01:53:10.700
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of us have failed many times.</v>

2800
01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:11.593
<v Speaker 5>I've failed at a bunch of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I guess what I'm saying is I </v>

2801
01:53:14.661 --> 01:53:17.000
<v Speaker 5>remember being a TV reporter at a small </v>
<v Speaker 5>station,</v>

2802
01:53:17.070 --> 01:53:17.510
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2803
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:20.630
<v Speaker 5>and I would get out of work at like </v>
<v Speaker 5>midnight and the Sh and the story that I</v>

2804
01:53:20.631 --> 01:53:23.030
<v Speaker 5>just spent all day on aired and it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>awful.</v>

2805
01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:25.430
<v Speaker 5>And I would get out and I would </v>
<v Speaker 5>literally,</v>

2806
01:53:25.431 --> 01:53:27.110
<v Speaker 5>this is when I still had quite a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 5>hair.</v>

2807
01:53:27.111 --> 01:53:29.300
<v Speaker 5>I would sit there and like you like pull</v>
<v Speaker 5>your hair out,</v>

2808
01:53:29.301 --> 01:53:30.530
<v Speaker 5>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what am I doing?</v>

2809
01:53:30.590 --> 01:53:31.011
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2810
01:53:31.011 --> 01:53:31.844
<v Speaker 5>This is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I look back on those now and I </v>

2811
01:53:34.191 --> 01:53:34.701
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2812
01:53:34.701 --> 01:53:38.030
<v Speaker 5>what if you had just given up then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

2813
01:53:38.310 --> 01:53:39.440
<v Speaker 5>or the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2814
01:53:39.710 --> 01:53:41.780
<v Speaker 5>do you know how my wife did a great </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing for me?</v>

2815
01:53:41.810 --> 01:53:42.171
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

2816
01:53:42.171 --> 01:53:43.004
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'd had that company that I just told </v>

2817
01:53:43.911 --> 01:53:45.410
<v Speaker 5>you about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were trying to do the new media thing</v>

2818
01:53:45.411 --> 01:53:48.200
<v Speaker 5>and it just fell apart like everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 5>companies were starting to do.</v>

2819
01:53:48.710 --> 01:53:49.543
<v Speaker 5>And I wasted a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of money in my life doing </v>

2820
01:53:51.111 --> 01:53:51.944
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she would have been totally </v>

2821
01:53:52.881 --> 01:53:53.714
<v Speaker 5>justified in saying that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know you're going to Indianapolis </v>

2822
01:53:55.911 --> 01:53:57.890
<v Speaker 5>gonna a talk radio show job wherever </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're higher.</v>

2823
01:53:58.130 --> 01:53:59.390
<v Speaker 5>But she did and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

2824
01:53:59.391 --> 01:54:01.280
<v Speaker 5>you tried to try this next thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could do it,</v>

2825
01:54:01.281 --> 01:54:03.560
<v Speaker 5>you can and here we are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think,</v>

2826
01:54:03.561 --> 01:54:05.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you hadn't tried,</v>

2827
01:54:05.330 --> 01:54:07.190
<v Speaker 5>it's that weird thing of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And folks,</v>

2828
01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:08.960
<v Speaker 5>I tried being a TV reporter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd try b.</v>

2829
01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:09.913
<v Speaker 5>You try all those things and either </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not successful or they're </v>

2830
01:54:11.901 --> 01:54:15.120
<v Speaker 5>moderately successful or they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>successful but not enough for you.</v>

2831
01:54:15.610 --> 01:54:17.780
<v Speaker 5>You got life is a verb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to,</v>

2832
01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:22.070
<v Speaker 5>you know the thing that people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>makes people the most sad in life.</v>

2833
01:54:22.071 --> 01:54:25.400
<v Speaker 5>And I already have a couple of friends </v>
<v Speaker 5>my own age who are there is the regrets,</v>

2834
01:54:25.610 --> 01:54:26.360
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't,</v>

2835
01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:27.860
<v Speaker 5>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not sorry,</v>

2836
01:54:27.861 --> 01:54:30.080
<v Speaker 5>they failed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're sorry they didn't try.</v>

2837
01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:33.170
<v Speaker 5>And the funny thing is there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of them are only 50 and they think,</v>

2838
01:54:33.171 --> 01:54:33.860
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my my,</v>

2839
01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:35.720
<v Speaker 5>my window to try is already gone.</v>

2840
01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:37.730
<v Speaker 5>And which is wrong too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But folks,</v>

2841
01:54:37.731 --> 01:54:38.564
<v Speaker 5>you will be so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so many things that have </v>

2842
01:54:39.441 --> 01:54:40.274
<v Speaker 5>happened in my life because I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I got my first talk radio show </v>

2843
01:54:42.291 --> 01:54:43.040
<v Speaker 5>job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

2844
01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:44.750
<v Speaker 5>I was a reporter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I covered the story.</v>

2845
01:54:44.751 --> 01:54:47.180
<v Speaker 5>There was some big guy showing up at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>local radio station.</v>

2846
01:54:47.490 --> 01:54:48.323
<v Speaker 5>As I was leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wrote a letter to the program </v>

2847
01:54:49.851 --> 01:54:51.680
<v Speaker 5>director.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just say thanks for having us to thought</v>

2848
01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:55.520
<v Speaker 5>do I may have this joint not mail it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do I mainly do it and just,</v>

2849
01:54:55.521 --> 01:54:56.354
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I closed my eyes and a male that he </v>

2850
01:54:57.111 --> 01:54:58.100
<v Speaker 5>called me two days later.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

2851
01:54:58.101 --> 01:55:00.950
<v Speaker 5>you want a job?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if you didn't send that letter?</v>

2852
01:55:00.951 --> 01:55:01.784
<v Speaker 5>It's a stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the little things that your life can </v>

2853
01:55:03.411 --> 01:55:08.411
<v Speaker 5>hinge on but if you don't do them you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't give and opportunity to intervene.</v>

2854
01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:11.700
<v Speaker 4>I think here's an important thing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>failure is important.</v>

2855
01:55:11.701 --> 01:55:12.534
<v Speaker 4>It is important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think failure teaches you things that </v>

2856
01:55:14.041 --> 01:55:17.670
<v Speaker 4>you don't learn from success.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think failure gives you an opportunity</v>

2857
01:55:17.671 --> 01:55:22.020
<v Speaker 4>for self examination and also gives you </v>
<v Speaker 4>a feeling that is very uncomfortable and</v>

2858
01:55:22.021 --> 01:55:22.854
<v Speaker 4>that very uncomfortable feeling helps </v>
<v Speaker 4>you grow that when you feel like shit </v>

2859
01:55:25.831 --> 01:55:28.320
<v Speaker 4>and you screw something up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when I've had bad podcasts,</v>

2860
01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:30.120
<v Speaker 4>my podcast has always gotten better </v>
<v Speaker 4>afterwards.</v>

2861
01:55:30.121 --> 01:55:30.954
<v Speaker 4>When I've had bad standup sets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always gotten better after that </v>

2862
01:55:33.001 --> 01:55:35.370
<v Speaker 4>because those bad sets motivate you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get,</v>

2863
01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:37.260
<v Speaker 4>they give you a perspective like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2864
01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:40.110
<v Speaker 4>here's some clear examples of where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked up,</v>

2865
01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:44.340
<v Speaker 4>what not to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't and don't look these failures</v>

2866
01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:45.173
<v Speaker 3>as like proof that you suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at them as opportunities for </v>

2867
01:55:48.451 --> 01:55:49.284
<v Speaker 3>growth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at them as opportunities to be </v>

2868
01:55:50.641 --> 01:55:51.474
<v Speaker 3>motivated to do better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Winston Churchill had a line about </v>

2869
01:55:53.611 --> 01:55:57.840
<v Speaker 3>reading quotes about how inspirational </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading famous quotes were.</v>

2870
01:55:58.170 --> 01:56:00.990
<v Speaker 3>And he says they motivate you from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of different ways,</v>

2871
01:56:00.991 --> 01:56:01.824
<v Speaker 3>including the idea that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think it's just you or you think </v>

2872
01:56:04.261 --> 01:56:07.800
<v Speaker 3>that these people who did so well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're so incredibly gifted or privileged</v>

2873
01:56:07.801 --> 01:56:09.270
<v Speaker 3>from the get go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you realize,</v>

2874
01:56:09.271 --> 01:56:09.521
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2875
01:56:09.521 --> 01:56:10.354
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're more like me than I think that </v>

2876
01:56:11.281 --> 01:56:12.900
<v Speaker 3>becomes inspirational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2877
01:56:13.050 --> 01:56:15.480
<v Speaker 3>You telling your audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is inspirational.</v>

2878
01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:17.450
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back to school,</v>

2879
01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:20.130
<v Speaker 3>go to this word note,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you hate your job,</v>

2880
01:56:20.131 --> 01:56:20.964
<v Speaker 3>that is like nature telling you to try </v>
<v Speaker 3>something different and it's motivating </v>

2881
01:56:23.971 --> 01:56:24.804
<v Speaker 3>because the motivation is you might not </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to do that soul killing job </v>

2882
01:56:27.121 --> 01:56:27.540
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

2883
01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:28.373
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at someone who's doing </v>

2884
01:56:28.921 --> 01:56:29.754
<v Speaker 3>really well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say if you focus on like Kevin Hart </v>

2885
01:56:31.921 --> 01:56:32.754
<v Speaker 3>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some very famous and successful </v>

2886
01:56:34.531 --> 01:56:35.364
<v Speaker 3>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you see is him now flying around on </v>

2887
01:56:38.221 --> 01:56:39.054
<v Speaker 3>private jets wearing a new pair of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sneakers every day driving around in </v>

2888
01:56:41.551 --> 01:56:43.410
<v Speaker 3>bentleys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just see that.</v>

2889
01:56:43.650 --> 01:56:47.190
<v Speaker 3>You don't see him being a young kid in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Philadelphia,</v>

2890
01:56:47.191 --> 01:56:50.760
<v Speaker 3>going to open mic nights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scratching and Clawing Mc Hammer selling</v>

2891
01:56:50.761 --> 01:56:52.370
<v Speaker 3>the tapes out of the hatchback.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2892
01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:53.460
<v Speaker 3>all of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2893
01:56:53.490 --> 01:56:54.323
<v Speaker 3>There's a path and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we think of people like you see an old </v>

2894
01:56:57.301 --> 01:56:58.800
<v Speaker 3>person walking down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

2895
01:56:58.801 --> 01:57:00.300
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that person's always been an old person.</v>

2896
01:57:00.301 --> 01:57:02.580
<v Speaker 3>Now that was a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a baby.</v>

2897
01:57:02.581 --> 01:57:04.440
<v Speaker 3>That became a 90 year old man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

2898
01:57:04.441 --> 01:57:07.200
<v Speaker 3>there's a progression that you are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>witnessed too.</v>

2899
01:57:07.260 --> 01:57:09.180
<v Speaker 3>You don't see it and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2900
01:57:09.181 --> 01:57:10.800
<v Speaker 3>that takes place in everything.</v>

2901
01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:14.460
<v Speaker 3>It takes place in author as it takes </v>
<v Speaker 3>place in comedians and musicians,</v>

2902
01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:19.410
<v Speaker 3>there is a starting point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then with time and focus and as long</v>

2903
01:57:19.411 --> 01:57:20.244
<v Speaker 3>as you reevaluate and reassess and </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly objectively look at what </v>

2904
01:57:24.181 --> 01:57:26.490
<v Speaker 3>you're doing and then pursue it with </v>
<v Speaker 3>passion and focus,</v>

2905
01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:28.560
<v Speaker 3>you get better at things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know what,</v>

2906
01:57:28.561 --> 01:57:30.390
<v Speaker 3>doing all those things ends up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2907
01:57:30.391 --> 01:57:32.580
<v Speaker 3>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your life experiences create who you</v>

2908
01:57:32.581 --> 01:57:35.700
<v Speaker 3>are and all those things actually make </v>
<v Speaker 3>you a more,</v>

2909
01:57:35.701 --> 01:57:37.020
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm speaking,</v>

2910
01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:37.873
<v Speaker 3>speaking to the choir here but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all those things make you a more </v>

2911
01:57:39.751 --> 01:57:44.260
<v Speaker 3>formidable person so that eventually </v>
<v Speaker 3>that next endeavor is,</v>

2912
01:57:44.290 --> 01:57:47.550
<v Speaker 3>is you're more prepared for and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>more formidable and,</v>

2913
01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:48.481
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2914
01:57:48.481 --> 01:57:49.314
<v Speaker 3>you turn around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

2915
01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:53.970
<v Speaker 3>what was I like as a 23 year old intern </v>
<v Speaker 3>compared to what I'm like now?</v>

2916
01:57:53.971 --> 01:57:57.510
<v Speaker 3>And I'm basically a different person and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a different person because of all</v>

2917
01:57:57.511 --> 01:57:58.650
<v Speaker 3>these life experiences.</v>

2918
01:57:58.650 --> 01:58:01.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean you go to a Centcom meeting with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the big breath,</v>

2919
01:58:01.090 --> 01:58:02.850
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're more formidable afterwards,</v>

2920
01:58:02.851 --> 01:58:03.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

2921
01:58:03.990 --> 01:58:06.300
<v Speaker 3>But if you don't put yourself in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>position,</v>

2922
01:58:06.301 --> 01:58:08.130
<v Speaker 3>you know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's life is like coming up to the,</v>

2923
01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:08.993
<v Speaker 3>to the plate and taking a swing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are no guarantees you're going to </v>

2924
01:58:10.861 --> 01:58:12.060
<v Speaker 3>get a hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no guarantee.</v>

2925
01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:13.860
<v Speaker 3>And you might even look foolish </v>
<v Speaker 3>swinging,</v>

2926
01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:16.620
<v Speaker 3>but there's no chance of it if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>get in the batter's box.</v>

2927
01:58:16.621 --> 01:58:17.850
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On hundred percent.</v>

2928
01:58:17.851 --> 01:58:21.660
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that I've found </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the last few years in particular,</v>

2929
01:58:21.970 --> 01:58:23.370
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done in the past,</v>

2930
01:58:23.371 --> 01:58:26.460
<v Speaker 3>but I did it because they were just </v>
<v Speaker 3>goals that I was pursuing on the side as</v>

2931
01:58:26.461 --> 01:58:28.710
<v Speaker 3>well as doing standup and all the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that I do with my life.</v>

2932
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:29.783
<v Speaker 3>But I've found that things that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely unrelated to my career that </v>

2933
01:58:32.821 --> 01:58:34.740
<v Speaker 3>are difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enhance what I do,</v>

2934
01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:40.100
<v Speaker 3>whether it's yoga or running hills or </v>
<v Speaker 3>archery or all these things</v>

2935
01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:45.460
<v Speaker 1>that I incorporate them into what you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of.</v>

2936
01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:46.980
<v Speaker 1>But that's just cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

2937
01:58:46.990 --> 01:58:49.630
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I do is just talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about things that I'm interested in,</v>

2938
01:58:49.930 --> 01:58:54.520
<v Speaker 1>but they make my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my focus better because they're hard and</v>

2939
01:58:54.521 --> 01:58:57.670
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not good at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like when I do yoga,</v>

2940
01:58:57.671 --> 01:58:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good at Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I do it,</v>

2941
01:59:00.040 --> 01:59:01.960
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking struggle.</v>

2942
01:59:01.961 --> 01:59:02.794
<v Speaker 1>And forcing myself to get through that </v>
<v Speaker 1>90 minute class and try a 100% with </v>

2943
01:59:07.511 --> 01:59:12.511
<v Speaker 1>every pose enhances my stamina for </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking and approaching other things.</v>

2944
01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:14.073
<v Speaker 1>Let's macro it out a little bit because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very interested in what you're </v>

2945
01:59:15.881 --> 01:59:16.510
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2946
01:59:16.510 --> 01:59:18.670
<v Speaker 1>so here you and I are talking to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>listeners,</v>

2947
01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:21.610
<v Speaker 1>many of whom were already accomplished </v>
<v Speaker 1>and well into their goals.</v>

2948
01:59:21.611 --> 01:59:23.440
<v Speaker 1>But if they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're listening to this.</v>

2949
01:59:23.441 --> 01:59:24.670
<v Speaker 1>And I'm thinking to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2950
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:27.700
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to design a society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2951
01:59:27.701 --> 01:59:28.990
<v Speaker 1>we had talked about revolution.</v>

2952
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:31.650
<v Speaker 1>If too many people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the losers in the society.</v>

2953
01:59:32.110 --> 01:59:32.943
<v Speaker 1>If you said to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what really matters in the society's </v>

2954
01:59:34.270 --> 01:59:37.180
<v Speaker 1>making more Americans who are happier </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their lives,</v>

2955
01:59:37.181 --> 01:59:38.800
<v Speaker 1>more successful doing what they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

2956
01:59:38.801 --> 01:59:41.560
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>empowering them to create.</v>

2957
01:59:42.460 --> 01:59:43.293
<v Speaker 1>How different is that in terms of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>setup from what our school system's </v>

2958
01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:48.670
<v Speaker 1>designed to do now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a hold over to essentially make</v>

2959
01:59:48.671 --> 01:59:50.650
<v Speaker 1>good factory workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2960
01:59:50.770 --> 01:59:52.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you said to somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2961
01:59:52.151 --> 01:59:52.984
<v Speaker 1>this entire country is built for you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a businessman with your own </v>

2962
01:59:56.021 --> 01:59:57.240
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Start Your own club.</v>

2963
01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:58.263
<v Speaker 1>If you taught that in the schools from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the get go and you had workshops all </v>

2964
02:00:01.871 --> 02:00:02.920
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's going to say,</v>

2965
02:00:02.921 --> 02:00:04.150
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we already do that in the schools.</v>

2966
02:00:04.151 --> 02:00:04.984
<v Speaker 1>I already know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean if that was the entire goal </v>

2967
02:00:06.941 --> 02:00:07.774
<v Speaker 1>of your education to turn every student </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that class and do a small business </v>

2968
02:00:10.841 --> 02:00:11.674
<v Speaker 1>person doing their own dreams someday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you do it differently than </v>

2969
02:00:15.131 --> 02:00:16.450
<v Speaker 1>what you do now?</v>

2970
02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:17.613
<v Speaker 1>Because to me the biggest crime isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we had the kind of system we have </v>

2971
02:00:19.931 --> 02:00:23.600
<v Speaker 1>is that we're not training people on how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to utilize it.</v>

2972
02:00:23.601 --> 02:00:23.831
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2973
02:00:23.831 --> 02:00:26.860
<v Speaker 1>we have all these opportunities there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it sounds like a cliche,</v>

2974
02:00:27.190 --> 02:00:29.710
<v Speaker 1>but we're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you go through it,</v>

2975
02:00:29.711 --> 02:00:30.640
<v Speaker 1>you say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2976
02:00:30.641 --> 02:00:32.560
<v Speaker 1>why can't more people do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2977
02:00:32.740 --> 02:00:34.840
<v Speaker 1>who told them they could?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who said,</v>

2978
02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:35.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2979
02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:36.273
<v Speaker 1>this is a little bit of a handholding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm teaching this to my kids right </v>

2980
02:00:38.531 --> 02:00:39.580
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2981
02:00:39.790 --> 02:00:40.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2982
02:00:40.781 --> 02:00:43.330
<v Speaker 1>don't go do the soul killing job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2983
02:00:43.331 --> 02:00:46.240
<v Speaker 1>work on this thing that you seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at and that you love and let's work</v>

2984
02:00:46.241 --> 02:00:47.470
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what the,</v>

2985
02:00:47.730 --> 02:00:49.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I'm saying is,</v>

2986
02:00:49.241 --> 02:00:51.650
<v Speaker 1>could we be doing a better job here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2987
02:00:51.670 --> 02:00:52.780
<v Speaker 1>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if so,</v>

2988
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.863
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you have to fight teachers unions </v>

2989
02:00:54.941 --> 02:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>to do it?</v>

2990
02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:56.333
<v Speaker 1>What do you have to do to break apart a </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that's 140 years old and not </v>

2991
02:00:59.471 --> 02:01:00.304
<v Speaker 1>working all that well right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two more correspond to the reality that </v>

2992
02:01:03.401 --> 02:01:04.960
<v Speaker 1>people are growing up in now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2993
02:01:04.961 --> 02:01:07.330
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with my daughter </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday about this,</v>

2994
02:01:07.331 --> 02:01:10.960
<v Speaker 1>my nine year old and she to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was saying,</v>

2995
02:01:10.990 --> 02:01:13.540
<v Speaker 1>she was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>school is so boring.</v>

2996
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:15.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go to school more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when she was laughing about,</v>

2997
02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:19.420
<v Speaker 1>I was picking her up from a class that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes to and uh,</v>

2998
02:01:19.421 --> 02:01:20.231
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2999
02:01:20.231 --> 02:01:21.370
<v Speaker 1>what's the most boring?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

3000
02:01:21.371 --> 02:01:24.070
<v Speaker 1>it's all boring to spend funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3001
02:01:24.071 --> 02:01:24.970
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

3002
02:01:24.971 --> 02:01:26.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like reading and you're,</v>

3003
02:01:26.581 --> 02:01:27.730
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really into reading.</v>

3004
02:01:27.731 --> 02:01:28.240
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3005
02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

3006
02:01:29.591 --> 02:01:31.810
<v Speaker 1>But they make it boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

3007
02:01:31.811 --> 02:01:33.520
<v Speaker 1>they make reading boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

3008
02:01:33.521 --> 02:01:34.211
<v Speaker 1>they make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3009
02:01:34.211 --> 02:01:35.320
<v Speaker 1>but you like writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3010
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:36.183
<v Speaker 1>You're like writing shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like writing what I want to write </v>

3011
02:01:38.171 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make writing bars,</v>

3012
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:42.590
<v Speaker 3>she's creative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was being silly.</v>

3013
02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:43.573
<v Speaker 3>But the wisdom from a nine year old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were just laughing and having fun </v>

3014
02:01:45.771 --> 02:01:46.604
<v Speaker 3>talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the wisdom from a nine year old </v>

3015
02:01:48.381 --> 02:01:52.640
<v Speaker 3>expressing how they make things that she</v>
<v Speaker 3>likes boring.</v>

3016
02:01:52.641 --> 02:01:53.474
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a certain amount that </v>

3017
02:01:55.641 --> 02:01:57.260
<v Speaker 3>you have to do that's boring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3018
02:01:57.261 --> 02:01:58.670
<v Speaker 3>There's a certain amount of the hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

3019
02:01:58.700 --> 02:02:01.400
<v Speaker 3>even in your business that you're sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning,</v>

3020
02:02:01.401 --> 02:02:02.540
<v Speaker 3>learning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grammar,</v>

3021
02:02:02.541 --> 02:02:04.550
<v Speaker 3>learning language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain amount of that stuff,</v>

3022
02:02:04.551 --> 02:02:05.384
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you get past that boring shit and </v>

3023
02:02:07.911 --> 02:02:11.150
<v Speaker 3>you have a base understanding of how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate and how to add,</v>

3024
02:02:11.151 --> 02:02:13.790
<v Speaker 3>how to count,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to multiply,</v>

3025
02:02:13.791 --> 02:02:14.624
<v Speaker 3>how government works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different things that you </v>

3026
02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:18.230
<v Speaker 3>should have sort of a base understanding</v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

3027
02:02:18.350 --> 02:02:21.140
<v Speaker 3>Then it's like everyone has a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality.</v>

3028
02:02:21.141 --> 02:02:23.330
<v Speaker 3>They have different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different interests,</v>

3029
02:02:23.331 --> 02:02:24.164
<v Speaker 3>different different things that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be really satisfied pursuing </v>

3030
02:02:27.290 --> 02:02:28.640
<v Speaker 3>that's not encouraged.</v>

3031
02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.250
<v Speaker 3>The what's encouraged encourages go find</v>
<v Speaker 3>a job.</v>

3032
02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:36.160
<v Speaker 3>What's encouraged is go find some place </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can shove yourself into.</v>

3033
02:02:36.170 --> 02:02:37.003
<v Speaker 3>Go find a square hole that you can stick</v>
<v Speaker 3>your round peg and just fucking jamming </v>

3034
02:02:41.331 --> 02:02:43.580
<v Speaker 3>in there and shave down the top and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom.</v>

3035
02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:44.533
<v Speaker 3>So you slide in with all this extra </v>
<v Speaker 3>space on the sides and feel like shit </v>

3036
02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:48.433
<v Speaker 3>for the rest of your life because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>need a job because you're in debt </v>

3037
02:02:51.500 --> 02:02:52.333
<v Speaker 3>because you have credit cards because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have student loans because that's </v>

3038
02:02:55.131 --> 02:02:57.230
<v Speaker 3>what everybody does and so you do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

3039
02:02:57.500 --> 02:02:58.333
<v Speaker 3>That's what's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong is that we don't like we </v>

3040
02:03:01.221 --> 02:03:04.250
<v Speaker 3>don't give,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like we met,</v>

3041
02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:07.460
<v Speaker 3>let them figure it out on their own and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it fucking takes forever.</v>

3042
02:03:07.670 --> 02:03:09.380
<v Speaker 3>It takes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it took forever for me.</v>

3043
02:03:09.530 --> 02:03:10.363
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only thing that I had going for me </v>

3044
02:03:11.361 --> 02:03:12.194
<v Speaker 3>that was that I was crazy and that I had</v>
<v Speaker 3>been spending most of my high school </v>

3045
02:03:15.681 --> 02:03:16.514
<v Speaker 3>years fighting so that I was already so </v>
<v Speaker 3>far outside of anybody that I was so </v>

3046
02:03:21.231 --> 02:03:22.064
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>

3047
02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:23.990
<v Speaker 3>I didn't fit in anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was weird too.</v>

3048
02:03:23.991 --> 02:03:26.240
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that funny?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't feel like I had a pot.</v>

3049
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:30.050
<v Speaker 3>I knew one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't work like a regular job.</v>

3050
02:03:30.051 --> 02:03:32.900
<v Speaker 3>Like I had to figure out something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I think there's the idea of,</v>

3051
02:03:33.050 --> 02:03:36.500
<v Speaker 3>it was literally the idea of being in an</v>
<v Speaker 3>office was like torture.</v>

3052
02:03:36.710 --> 02:03:38.630
<v Speaker 3>Can I just tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's the hinge point.</v>

3053
02:03:38.750 --> 02:03:40.430
<v Speaker 3>The difference between you and this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3054
02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:41.293
<v Speaker 3>so here's if I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was creating a fantasy educational </v>

3055
02:03:43.701 --> 02:03:44.534
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hinge point between what you just </v>

3056
02:03:46.101 --> 02:03:48.680
<v Speaker 3>said is that you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't stand this.</v>

3057
02:03:48.681 --> 02:03:50.870
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't work the real job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't fit into this.</v>

3058
02:03:51.020 --> 02:03:53.930
<v Speaker 3>So I did something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to find another way.</v>

3059
02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:57.860
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people get stuck with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I had to find another way apart.</v>

3060
02:03:57.920 --> 02:03:58.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3061
02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:01.430
<v Speaker 3>you know it's funny cause you know your </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids are young enough to,</v>

3062
02:04:01.431 --> 02:04:02.264
<v Speaker 3>so you went through this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean when my kids were really </v>

3063
02:04:03.651 --> 02:04:04.484
<v Speaker 3>young before they were in the school </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and now we put them in one of </v>

3064
02:04:05.631 --> 02:04:06.860
<v Speaker 3>those Montessori schools.</v>

3065
02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:09.650
<v Speaker 3>You know the ones that everybody goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

3066
02:04:09.940 --> 02:04:10.311
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3067
02:04:10.311 --> 02:04:12.110
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's different school to school.</v>

3068
02:04:12.140 --> 02:04:12.973
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the basic concept is that you don't </v>

3069
02:04:14.481 --> 02:04:16.970
<v Speaker 3>force the children to learn anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>specific.</v>

3070
02:04:16.971 --> 02:04:20.780
<v Speaker 3>You have all these things around and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>children go to work they want to do.</v>

3071
02:04:21.250 --> 02:04:22.083
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the upsides obviously that from the </v>

3072
02:04:23.421 --> 02:04:25.490
<v Speaker 3>get go they're only reading what they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>into.</v>

3073
02:04:25.491 --> 02:04:26.324
<v Speaker 3>Or the downside of course is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all this other stuff you're </v>

3074
02:04:27.951 --> 02:04:28.970
<v Speaker 3>supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to learn.</v>

3075
02:04:28.971 --> 02:04:29.804
<v Speaker 3>It's the Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the dichotomy between how do you </v>

3076
02:04:31.701 --> 02:04:31.951
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3077
02:04:31.951 --> 02:04:33.650
<v Speaker 3>you had talked about needing to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>these skills,</v>

3078
02:04:33.651 --> 02:04:35.870
<v Speaker 3>a little math skills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need some basic foundational stuff,</v>

3079
02:04:36.290 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 3>but something also happening at</v>

3080
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:38.903
<v Speaker 5>that level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is you're finding out which </v>

3081
02:04:40.051 --> 02:04:42.780
<v Speaker 5>students are into math and would like to</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a career in math.</v>

3082
02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:43.853
<v Speaker 5>Other people are being touched by a </v>
<v Speaker 5>foreign language in a way that they </v>

3083
02:04:45.601 --> 02:04:47.610
<v Speaker 5>think I'd like to learn more than I'd </v>
<v Speaker 5>like to speak in fluent.</v>

3084
02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:49.050
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to teach it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in a way,</v>

3085
02:04:49.051 --> 02:04:49.884
<v Speaker 5>you're already beginning to select what </v>
<v Speaker 5>kids are into by exposing them to this </v>

3086
02:04:52.501 --> 02:04:54.420
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most of us find it boring,</v>

3087
02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:57.630
<v Speaker 5>but there might be something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where I first found history as a,</v>

3088
02:04:57.660 --> 02:04:59.220
<v Speaker 5>as a discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3089
02:04:59.380 --> 02:05:00.810
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if most kids is,</v>

3090
02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:01.693
<v Speaker 5>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the last thing I want to hear some </v>

3091
02:05:02.131 --> 02:05:04.710
<v Speaker 5>history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I get turned on by it.</v>

3092
02:05:04.711 --> 02:05:05.544
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well we'll then it's worth exposing you </v>

3093
02:05:06.931 --> 02:05:08.370
<v Speaker 5>to all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3094
02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:11.040
<v Speaker 5>I think the problem is though is that it</v>
<v Speaker 5>would be great,</v>

3095
02:05:11.041 --> 02:05:13.740
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to have half your schooling,</v>

3096
02:05:13.741 --> 02:05:14.574
<v Speaker 5>maybe at that young age,</v>
<v Speaker 5>be sort of a Montessori model where you </v>

3097
02:05:16.531 --> 02:05:17.160
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3098
02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:18.510
<v Speaker 5>we spend our time on reading,</v>
<v Speaker 5>writing,</v>

3099
02:05:18.511 --> 02:05:19.320
<v Speaker 5>and arithmetic.</v>

3100
02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:21.570
<v Speaker 5>Now we want you to go around and it has </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be,</v>

3101
02:05:21.571 --> 02:05:22.404
<v Speaker 5>you can't be playing video games and </v>
<v Speaker 5>less playing video games is what you </v>

3102
02:05:24.241 --> 02:05:25.950
<v Speaker 5>want to do for a living and you're going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be able to,</v>

3103
02:05:26.060 --> 02:05:28.260
<v Speaker 5>to do some educational work on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>

3104
02:05:28.261 --> 02:05:31.170
<v Speaker 5>I would love to see more of a fostering </v>
<v Speaker 5>for the fact that,</v>

3105
02:05:31.171 --> 02:05:32.004
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're trying to create entrepreneurs </v>

3106
02:05:33.481 --> 02:05:37.740
<v Speaker 5>here rather than trying to create drone </v>
<v Speaker 5>workers on the Amazon assembly line.</v>

3107
02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:41.160
<v Speaker 5>Now if you end up on the Amazon assembly</v>
<v Speaker 5>line anyway,</v>

3108
02:05:41.161 --> 02:05:41.941
<v Speaker 5>great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good for you.</v>

3109
02:05:41.941 --> 02:05:42.774
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad you can bring some food home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the goal ought to be to let you </v>

3110
02:05:46.051 --> 02:05:48.360
<v Speaker 5>start a business and maybe employ a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch of other people,</v>

3111
02:05:48.361 --> 02:05:49.470
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3112
02:05:49.471 --> 02:05:53.040
<v Speaker 5>And the goal would be to have less </v>
<v Speaker 5>unhappy,</v>

3113
02:05:53.070 --> 02:05:56.340
<v Speaker 5>dissatisfied p that because it creates a</v>
<v Speaker 5>more stable society.</v>

3114
02:05:56.370 --> 02:05:57.690
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it also happier.</v>

3115
02:05:57.750 --> 02:06:00.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It creates more,</v>

3116
02:06:00.180 --> 02:06:03.570
<v Speaker 5>more satisfaction in the people that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>know that get to do what they want to do</v>

3117
02:06:03.571 --> 02:06:04.790
<v Speaker 5>for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like they're,</v>

3118
02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:07.190
<v Speaker 5>their lives are completely how </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's going to,</v>

3119
02:06:07.340 --> 02:06:09.990
<v Speaker 5>that's what its problems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No matter who you are,</v>

3120
02:06:10.370 --> 02:06:11.203
<v Speaker 5>you know what a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a Kanye west who said to rich </v>

3121
02:06:12.991 --> 02:06:14.610
<v Speaker 5>people have problems or just different </v>
<v Speaker 5>problems.</v>

3122
02:06:14.611 --> 02:06:17.250
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's got these challenges,</v>

3123
02:06:17.251 --> 02:06:18.084
<v Speaker 5>but like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's not a lot more more stressful </v>

3124
02:06:19.981 --> 02:06:22.230
<v Speaker 5>than having a ton of credit card debt </v>
<v Speaker 5>wondering,</v>

3125
02:06:22.231 --> 02:06:23.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to lose your house,</v>

3126
02:06:23.491 --> 02:06:25.440
<v Speaker 5>wondering how you're going to pay for </v>
<v Speaker 5>your kids' education.</v>

3127
02:06:25.441 --> 02:06:27.840
<v Speaker 5>I mean all those things are soul </v>
<v Speaker 5>crushing.</v>

3128
02:06:27.870 --> 02:06:29.730
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you're in debt,</v>

3129
02:06:29.731 --> 02:06:30.564
<v Speaker 5>you get nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it suppresses your ability to take </v>

3130
02:06:32.791 --> 02:06:34.320
<v Speaker 5>risks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take risks,</v>

3131
02:06:34.580 --> 02:06:36.930
<v Speaker 5>cause you're in your cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to lose your Gig.</v>

3132
02:06:36.930 --> 02:06:38.100
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3133
02:06:38.101 --> 02:06:40.440
<v Speaker 5>it's like man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you're tired,</v>

3134
02:06:40.830 --> 02:06:41.663
<v Speaker 5>you're tired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the one thing is as you get </v>

3135
02:06:43.141 --> 02:06:43.974
<v Speaker 5>older,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's funny because I'm getting </v>

3136
02:06:45.721 --> 02:06:48.630
<v Speaker 5>older is one of those things that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can only understand when you get there.</v>

3137
02:06:48.631 --> 02:06:50.910
<v Speaker 5>So I all through your life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going through these,</v>

3138
02:06:50.911 --> 02:06:52.800
<v Speaker 5>God isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Isn't this the interesting part of being</v>

3139
02:06:52.801 --> 02:06:55.920
<v Speaker 5>in your 30s or being in your foot?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So as I go into my 50s now,</v>

3140
02:06:55.921 --> 02:06:59.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm sitting here going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>energy is so under talked about,</v>

3141
02:07:00.290 --> 02:07:01.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ability to,</v>

3142
02:07:01.980 --> 02:07:03.960
<v Speaker 5>like my buddy who wrote me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3143
02:07:03.961 --> 02:07:06.270
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I screwed up my life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't take enough chances.</v>

3144
02:07:06.460 --> 02:07:09.180
<v Speaker 5>I played it safe and now I'm so unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

3145
02:07:09.181 --> 02:07:10.014
<v Speaker 5>and I just can't motivate myself at 50 </v>
<v Speaker 5>years old any more energy wise to start </v>

3146
02:07:14.551 --> 02:07:17.250
<v Speaker 5>over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>energy is underrepresented.</v>

3147
02:07:17.250 --> 02:07:19.410
<v Speaker 5>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guys got to fix his health.</v>

3148
02:07:19.890 --> 02:07:21.570
<v Speaker 5>I knew you were going to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See what it is.</v>

3149
02:07:21.571 --> 02:07:25.100
<v Speaker 5>Your health is your engine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It helped is literally the,</v>

3150
02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:26.940
<v Speaker 5>the chassis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tires,</v>

3151
02:07:26.941 --> 02:07:30.420
<v Speaker 5>the brakes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the engine of your vehicle that you move</v>

3152
02:07:30.421 --> 02:07:31.254
<v Speaker 5>through this life with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And too many people don't pay attention </v>

3153
02:07:33.481 --> 02:07:35.000
<v Speaker 5>to it at the end of the lack of energy </v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

3154
02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:37.420
<v Speaker 5>and as you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially not just that,</v>

3155
02:07:37.450 --> 02:07:40.300
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it changes your ability to do things.</v>

3156
02:07:40.630 --> 02:07:43.630
<v Speaker 5>If you don't have energy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not only will you not have the energy to</v>

3157
02:07:43.631 --> 02:07:44.920
<v Speaker 5>pursue things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you won't,</v>

3158
02:07:45.340 --> 02:07:47.440
<v Speaker 5>you won't be able to do them the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

3159
02:07:47.470 --> 02:07:48.303
<v Speaker 5>If you have energy and enthusiasm and </v>
<v Speaker 5>say like you're healthy and you want to </v>

3160
02:07:51.221 --> 02:07:52.054
<v Speaker 5>write a book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have thoughts that will </v>

3161
02:07:54.281 --> 02:07:58.000
<v Speaker 5>come into your mind that won't come into</v>
<v Speaker 5>your mind if you're exhausted.</v>

3162
02:07:58.060 --> 02:08:00.790
<v Speaker 5>Agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking huge.</v>

3163
02:08:01.090 --> 02:08:03.370
<v Speaker 5>That's huge for anything you're trying </v>
<v Speaker 5>to pursue.</v>

3164
02:08:03.371 --> 02:08:05.140
<v Speaker 5>Whether we're talking about furniture </v>
<v Speaker 5>making,</v>

3165
02:08:05.290 --> 02:08:06.940
<v Speaker 5>what they're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>being an author,</v>

3166
02:08:07.090 --> 02:08:07.923
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's talk about ideas for a minute </v>

3167
02:08:09.371 --> 02:08:10.204
<v Speaker 5>because I think that's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When we talk about small businesses or </v>

3168
02:08:11.771 --> 02:08:13.930
<v Speaker 5>starting as an entrepreneur,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3169
02:08:14.140 --> 02:08:14.973
<v Speaker 5>I'm one of those people that is not sure</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we don't have a finite number of </v>

3170
02:08:17.891 --> 02:08:18.724
<v Speaker 5>ideas to each of us and all of them are </v>
<v Speaker 5>valuable enough even if they don't </v>

3171
02:08:22.751 --> 02:08:24.700
<v Speaker 5>appear to be on the surface to write </v>
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>

3172
02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:26.580
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3173
02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:27.281
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a matter fact,</v>

3174
02:08:27.281 --> 02:08:29.740
<v Speaker 5>I keep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went to a business meeting a couple of</v>

3175
02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:32.680
<v Speaker 5>years ago with one of these TV guys I </v>
<v Speaker 5>was just talking about and we go to this</v>

3176
02:08:32.681 --> 02:08:35.110
<v Speaker 5>business meeting and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're all on our phones and whatever and</v>

3177
02:08:35.111 --> 02:08:35.944
<v Speaker 5>he pulls out an old fashioned journal </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you write in and he's just starts </v>

3178
02:08:39.581 --> 02:08:40.414
<v Speaker 5>writing.</v>

3179
02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:43.720
<v Speaker 5>And I looked at that and I thought in </v>
<v Speaker 5>one sense he looks like a dinosaur,</v>

3180
02:08:43.721 --> 02:08:48.520
<v Speaker 5>but I went out and bought one and now </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy how often,</v>

3181
02:08:48.550 --> 02:08:49.383
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all I do is write ideas in it and a lot </v>

3182
02:08:51.341 --> 02:08:52.930
<v Speaker 5>of them I look back on now and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3183
02:08:52.931 --> 02:08:55.300
<v Speaker 5>that's still stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But other ones I look back on and go,</v>

3184
02:08:55.301 --> 02:08:56.134
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know what this idea meant at </v>

3185
02:08:57.521 --> 02:08:58.354
<v Speaker 5>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but five years later this idea is </v>

3186
02:08:59.591 --> 02:09:00.424
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3187
02:09:00.670 --> 02:09:01.503
<v Speaker 5>I guess what I'm saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that if you wanted to take almost </v>

3188
02:09:03.011 --> 02:09:03.844
<v Speaker 5>like a religious view of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God only gives you somebody that right </v>

3189
02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:09.730
<v Speaker 5>down and cherish the ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there is something to that folks.</v>

3190
02:09:10.150 --> 02:09:10.983
<v Speaker 5>What really is going to make you unique </v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes is the way your brain works </v>

3191
02:09:13.901 --> 02:09:16.990
<v Speaker 5>differently than anyone's brain who's </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever existed on the planet.</v>

3192
02:09:17.410 --> 02:09:20.860
<v Speaker 5>That's valuable right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Write down what comes out of the brain.</v>

3193
02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:21.933
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you capture those calves are </v>

3194
02:09:23.371 --> 02:09:26.830
<v Speaker 5>don't tap to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They will slip around and sometimes,</v>

3195
02:09:26.980 --> 02:09:31.210
<v Speaker 5>sometimes the idea isn't good until you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>until the second half arrives later,</v>

3196
02:09:31.340 --> 02:09:32.173
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So idea number ones in your book from </v>

3197
02:09:33.641 --> 02:09:34.474
<v Speaker 5>five years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Idea number two that finally completes </v>

3198
02:09:35.891 --> 02:09:37.120
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Id arrives later.</v>

3199
02:09:37.420 --> 02:09:38.253
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a friend who was so creative and </v>

3200
02:09:39.041 --> 02:09:39.874
<v Speaker 5>he said he gets the best ideas at night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he just turns on the light and the </v>

3201
02:09:42.670 --> 02:09:43.503
<v Speaker 5>light at the side of the table writes it</v>
<v Speaker 5>down in the book and by morning there's </v>

3202
02:09:45.641 --> 02:09:49.780
<v Speaker 5>another idea down there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And quantity has a quality all its own.</v>

3203
02:09:49.781 --> 02:09:54.781
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes a book filled with </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting ideas out of your individual</v>

3204
02:09:55.091 --> 02:09:58.420
<v Speaker 5>unique head will help you later on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So write them down.</v>

3205
02:09:58.470 --> 02:09:58.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3206
02:09:58.870 --> 02:09:59.770
<v Speaker 5>There's no downside.</v>

3207
02:09:59.860 --> 02:10:02.560
<v Speaker 5>I have an APP on my phone where I can </v>
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

3208
02:10:02.561 --> 02:10:03.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know the notes app?</v>

3209
02:10:03.870 --> 02:10:06.250
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>use that microphone filled.</v>

3210
02:10:06.251 --> 02:10:07.930
<v Speaker 5>Let's talk into that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do too.</v>

3211
02:10:07.931 --> 02:10:10.510
<v Speaker 5>And it dictates it really almost </v>
<v Speaker 5>perfectly.</v>

3212
02:10:10.660 --> 02:10:12.910
<v Speaker 5>So I'll have an idea and I'll just be </v>
<v Speaker 5>driving down the road.</v>

3213
02:10:12.911 --> 02:10:15.100
<v Speaker 5>I just press that button.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I started talking into it and then I put</v>

3214
02:10:15.101 --> 02:10:16.180
<v Speaker 5>it down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got it.</v>

3215
02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:17.073
<v Speaker 5>Like I got that one a captured it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Think about people who've had one </v>

3216
02:10:19.421 --> 02:10:23.200
<v Speaker 5>fantastic idea and their life and built </v>
<v Speaker 5>their whole life on it.</v>

3217
02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:25.360
<v Speaker 5>And you never know which idea that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be.</v>

3218
02:10:25.361 --> 02:10:25.921
<v Speaker 5>And you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3219
02:10:25.921 --> 02:10:28.690
<v Speaker 5>I was an Improv again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know more about this than I do,</v>

3220
02:10:28.691 --> 02:10:31.500
<v Speaker 5>but I was a theater major for my first </v>
<v Speaker 5>two years of college and we,</v>

3221
02:10:31.530 --> 02:10:35.990
<v Speaker 5>we did improv comedy and the Guy who </v>
<v Speaker 5>taught us Improv in high school really?</v>

3222
02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:38.930
<v Speaker 5>He had a great line.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said that part of your brain,</v>

3223
02:10:38.931 --> 02:10:40.640
<v Speaker 5>like every part of your brain is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>muscle.</v>

3224
02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.650
<v Speaker 5>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more you're thinking,</v>

3225
02:10:42.651 --> 02:10:44.900
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to show this Friday that I have to</v>

3226
02:10:44.901 --> 02:10:46.910
<v Speaker 5>come up with something funny for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>better.</v>

3227
02:10:46.911 --> 02:10:48.360
<v Speaker 5>You get at it and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3228
02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:49.313
<v Speaker 5>and you start looking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your brain starts looking at things and </v>

3229
02:10:51.981 --> 02:10:52.814
<v Speaker 5>finding thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're almost like training it to </v>

3230
02:10:54.651 --> 02:10:58.700
<v Speaker 5>help you now in this new endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a very plastic sort of an approach.</v>

3231
02:10:58.701 --> 02:11:00.410
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's the same thing with the ideas.</v>

3232
02:11:00.710 --> 02:11:04.040
<v Speaker 5>One idea in your little book that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrote down could make your life,</v>

3233
02:11:04.041 --> 02:11:06.050
<v Speaker 5>your child.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you're a Henry Ford,</v>

3234
02:11:06.290 --> 02:11:07.123
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many people did you employ for </v>

3235
02:11:08.691 --> 02:11:11.270
<v Speaker 5>decades afterwards because of a good </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea.</v>

3236
02:11:11.271 --> 02:11:13.070
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our world is built on those things.</v>

3237
02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:18.100
<v Speaker 5>And also like the idea of having these </v>
<v Speaker 5>ideas and the enthusiasm that comes from</v>

3238
02:11:18.411 --> 02:11:18.560
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3239
02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:22.100
<v Speaker 5>Like it starts to escalate and you start</v>
<v Speaker 5>to calculate like,</v>

3240
02:11:22.130 --> 02:11:23.750
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I need more.</v>

3241
02:11:23.751 --> 02:11:25.420
<v Speaker 5>And I think this and maybe that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3242
02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:28.310
<v Speaker 5>and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the motivation and the momentum of these</v>

3243
02:11:28.311 --> 02:11:32.420
<v Speaker 5>ideas can lead to enthusiasm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You attract other people who have,</v>

3244
02:11:32.421 --> 02:11:33.254
<v Speaker 5>who can add,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is what we said about like </v>

3245
02:11:35.151 --> 02:11:38.030
<v Speaker 5>you start your website and you just do </v>
<v Speaker 5>it because things,</v>

3246
02:11:38.031 --> 02:11:38.864
<v Speaker 5>once you push the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the verb of living manages to create </v>

3247
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:45.830
<v Speaker 5>ripples into get ultimate metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 5>ubit ripples in time in front of you.</v>

3248
02:11:45.831 --> 02:11:48.620
<v Speaker 5>That open up possibilities and because </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone may,</v>

3249
02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:52.580
<v Speaker 5>if you only have one podcast listener </v>
<v Speaker 5>but that podcast listeners like,</v>

3250
02:11:52.581 --> 02:11:53.420
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's great.</v>

3251
02:11:53.421 --> 02:11:54.254
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to and gets a hold of you and </v>
<v Speaker 5>your life goes off in another different </v>

3252
02:11:56.301 --> 02:11:58.040
<v Speaker 5>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you have to try.</v>

3253
02:11:58.370 --> 02:11:59.810
<v Speaker 5>You have to try.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3254
02:11:59.811 --> 02:12:02.420
<v Speaker 5>well you don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could just drone on,</v>

3255
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:04.700
<v Speaker 5>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would recommend not doing that.</v>

3256
02:12:04.940 --> 02:12:08.510
<v Speaker 5>I would also suggest that you and I and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone has an interest in,</v>

3257
02:12:08.511 --> 02:12:11.120
<v Speaker 5>in not allowing people to drone on too </v>
<v Speaker 5>much because,</v>

3258
02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:13.480
<v Speaker 5>because for the same reason I talked </v>
<v Speaker 5>about Insta,</v>

3259
02:12:13.540 --> 02:12:17.360
<v Speaker 5>we did a common sense show once called </v>
<v Speaker 5>the revenge of the gangrenous finger.</v>

3260
02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:19.790
<v Speaker 5>And the idea was that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3261
02:12:19.791 --> 02:12:24.320
<v Speaker 5>if you ignore people in your society </v>
<v Speaker 5>that aren't doing well long enough,</v>

3262
02:12:24.350 --> 02:12:27.050
<v Speaker 5>it's a little like saying yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my finger has gang green,</v>

3263
02:12:27.051 --> 02:12:28.940
<v Speaker 5>but it's the little ones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so who the hell cares?</v>

3264
02:12:29.210 --> 02:12:31.430
<v Speaker 5>But eventually if you ignore it long </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough,</v>

3265
02:12:31.431 --> 02:12:34.310
<v Speaker 5>it will poison your bloodstream and </v>
<v Speaker 5>destroy the body itself.</v>

3266
02:12:34.730 --> 02:12:38.480
<v Speaker 5>If you have enough people in soul </v>
<v Speaker 5>crushing situations who can't,</v>

3267
02:12:38.570 --> 02:12:40.460
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a guy called me once on the radio when I</v>

3268
02:12:40.461 --> 02:12:43.430
<v Speaker 5>was preaching revolution in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 5>of 1990s and said,</v>

3269
02:12:43.790 --> 02:12:46.390
<v Speaker 5>you're an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said you're an idiot because no one's</v>

3270
02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:47.270
<v Speaker 5>going to face the bay.</v>

3271
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:48.103
<v Speaker 5>Annette's as long as they have enough </v>
<v Speaker 5>food in their bellies and they're doing </v>

3272
02:12:49.821 --> 02:12:50.870
<v Speaker 5>halfway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3273
02:12:51.110 --> 02:12:54.530
<v Speaker 5>But of course the implication there is </v>
<v Speaker 5>if they don't have food in their bellies</v>

3274
02:12:54.650 --> 02:12:57.740
<v Speaker 5>and they're not doing okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then all bets are off.</v>

3275
02:12:58.100 --> 02:12:58.933
<v Speaker 5>We all have a vested interest in seeing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that more of our country men do better </v>

3276
02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:02.743
<v Speaker 5>because it's better for the society as a</v>
<v Speaker 5>whole creates a better world for your </v>

3277
02:13:04.671 --> 02:13:06.020
<v Speaker 5>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Happier.</v>

3278
02:13:06.770 --> 02:13:07.790
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's so many.</v>

3279
02:13:07.791 --> 02:13:09.470
<v Speaker 5>And the one thing about our system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3280
02:13:09.471 --> 02:13:11.540
<v Speaker 5>people talk about patriotism all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

3281
02:13:11.930 --> 02:13:13.700
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but to me the real patriotism is saying,</v>

3282
02:13:13.701 --> 02:13:16.100
<v Speaker 5>we've created a system here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It works this way.</v>

3283
02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:18.410
<v Speaker 5>It encourages people to go do these </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

3284
02:13:18.770 --> 02:13:21.350
<v Speaker 5>So if the system's designed and set up </v>
<v Speaker 5>for that,</v>

3285
02:13:21.380 --> 02:13:23.720
<v Speaker 5>you ought to give it a try.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You ought to just see,</v>

3286
02:13:24.150 --> 02:13:24.983
<v Speaker 5>know the suggestion that I always give </v>
<v Speaker 5>to people is write down things that you </v>

3287
02:13:28.221 --> 02:13:29.300
<v Speaker 5>want to try to accomplish.</v>

3288
02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:31.010
<v Speaker 5>Just write them down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or a guy said to,</v>

3289
02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:31.913
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who said right the way you want your </v>

3290
02:13:33.121 --> 02:13:36.810
<v Speaker 5>obituary to appear?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now sit down,</v>

3291
02:13:36.811 --> 02:13:38.370
<v Speaker 5>write your obituary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

3292
02:13:38.371 --> 02:13:40.740
<v Speaker 5>because that'll show you how far off </v>
<v Speaker 5>your goals you are.</v>

3293
02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:42.360
<v Speaker 5>Here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's a better one.</v>

3294
02:13:42.690 --> 02:13:43.523
<v Speaker 5>Pretend there's a documentary crew </v>
<v Speaker 5>filming your success story and they're </v>

3295
02:13:46.381 --> 02:13:48.300
<v Speaker 5>following you around right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would you do?</v>

3296
02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:49.453
<v Speaker 5>What would you do if you knew that there</v>
<v Speaker 5>was a crew following you around with </v>

3297
02:13:51.991 --> 02:13:55.140
<v Speaker 5>cameras documenting your future?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Incredible success,</v>

3298
02:13:55.530 --> 02:13:57.450
<v Speaker 5>and they want to catch you in the act of</v>
<v Speaker 5>at all.</v>

3299
02:13:57.510 --> 02:13:59.130
<v Speaker 5>You would do all the right things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would have to do.</v>

3300
02:13:59.131 --> 02:14:00.510
<v Speaker 5>Think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>organize it.</v>

3301
02:14:00.511 --> 02:14:01.344
<v Speaker 5>But we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we are saddled down by so many doubts </v>

3302
02:14:03.870 --> 02:14:04.703
<v Speaker 5>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so much just mental horse shit that </v>

3303
02:14:07.831 --> 02:14:08.890
<v Speaker 5>keeps people from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3304
02:14:09.060 --> 02:14:10.950
<v Speaker 5>from action.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But look at the thing,</v>

3305
02:14:10.951 --> 02:14:11.784
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to me maybe the number one thing that's </v>

3306
02:14:13.141 --> 02:14:15.270
<v Speaker 5>the impediment and the make society </v>
<v Speaker 5>unequal.</v>

3307
02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:17.700
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the luck of who your parents are.</v>

3308
02:14:17.730 --> 02:14:18.780
<v Speaker 5>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3309
02:14:18.781 --> 02:14:19.380
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

3310
02:14:19.380 --> 02:14:20.370
<v Speaker 5>if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

3311
02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:21.353
<v Speaker 5>this guy grew up and started his own </v>
<v Speaker 5>business because his folks taught in </v>

3312
02:14:23.341 --> 02:14:26.760
<v Speaker 5>those kinds of things and encouraged him</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he is or she with her creativity.</v>

3313
02:14:27.150 --> 02:14:27.983
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a person that's got a huge </v>

3314
02:14:28.711 --> 02:14:29.544
<v Speaker 5>advantage in life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We talked about white privilege giving </v>

3315
02:14:30.571 --> 02:14:31.290
<v Speaker 5>you an advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3316
02:14:31.290 --> 02:14:33.420
<v Speaker 5>good parent privilege gives you an </v>
<v Speaker 5>advantage.</v>

3317
02:14:33.810 --> 02:14:34.643
<v Speaker 5>But then the question that as if you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at it macro in a society since </v>

3318
02:14:37.051 --> 02:14:38.070
<v Speaker 5>that comes up is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

3319
02:14:38.220 --> 02:14:42.540
<v Speaker 5>what can society do if you say this is a</v>
<v Speaker 5>real problem for the rest of us,</v>

3320
02:14:42.541 --> 02:14:45.240
<v Speaker 5>not enough good parents,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause those people never learned it.</v>

3321
02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:46.343
<v Speaker 5>How do you compensate for that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that almost gets a little </v>

3322
02:14:47.911 --> 02:14:51.450
<v Speaker 5>socialistic where you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>the state teaching you creativity and it</v>

3323
02:14:51.451 --> 02:14:52.740
<v Speaker 5>doesn't really make a whole lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>sense,</v>

3324
02:14:52.741 --> 02:14:53.574
<v Speaker 5>but there's got to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we decide that this is a national </v>

3325
02:14:55.261 --> 02:14:56.970
<v Speaker 5>security interest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3326
02:14:56.971 --> 02:15:00.150
<v Speaker 5>having more Americans live in the dream </v>
<v Speaker 5>have less losers.</v>

3327
02:15:00.780 --> 02:15:02.730
<v Speaker 5>But what if your parents are losers?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3328
02:15:02.731 --> 02:15:03.564
<v Speaker 5>well you can get past that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know a lot of people that are fucking </v>

3329
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:07.040
<v Speaker 5>losers for parents.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could we increase the,</v>

3330
02:15:07.070 --> 02:15:08.220
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the number of people,</v>

3331
02:15:08.340 --> 02:15:08.821
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you say,</v>

3332
02:15:08.821 --> 02:15:11.310
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>500 out of a thousand overcome that,</v>

3333
02:15:11.490 --> 02:15:12.323
<v Speaker 5>how do you get to 600 how do you get to </v>
<v Speaker 5>700 out of a thousand and if you say </v>

3334
02:15:14.851 --> 02:15:17.100
<v Speaker 5>it's a national security concern that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>

3335
02:15:17.430 --> 02:15:20.520
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think ambition is a gene.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really do.</v>

3336
02:15:20.521 --> 02:15:24.390
<v Speaker 5>And I think that that some of us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could be born into any circumstance,</v>

3337
02:15:24.391 --> 02:15:25.224
<v Speaker 5>but you've got this gene so you're going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be ambitious and you're going to </v>

3338
02:15:26.761 --> 02:15:27.594
<v Speaker 5>overcome it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then I think there's people who have no </v>

3339
02:15:28.891 --> 02:15:31.140
<v Speaker 5>ambition gene and there's nothing you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can do to help them.</v>

3340
02:15:31.350 --> 02:15:32.183
<v Speaker 5>And then I think there's a huge number </v>
<v Speaker 5>of people in the middle that could go </v>

3341
02:15:34.141 --> 02:15:34.920
<v Speaker 5>either way.</v>

3342
02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:37.620
<v Speaker 5>And the question I have is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to help the ones with the</v>

3343
02:15:37.621 --> 02:15:38.454
<v Speaker 5>gene.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't do anything for the ones </v>

3344
02:15:39.511 --> 02:15:40.344
<v Speaker 5>without the gene.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you increase the odds for the </v>

3345
02:15:41.821 --> 02:15:44.940
<v Speaker 5>people who could go either way?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you give them a template.</v>

3346
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:48.870
<v Speaker 5>You give them some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some markers that they can follow.</v>

3347
02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:49.890
<v Speaker 5>Who's we though?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3348
02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:51.450
<v Speaker 5>they're little me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

3349
02:15:51.451 --> 02:15:52.284
<v Speaker 5>it's yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3350
02:15:52.290 --> 02:15:55.020
<v Speaker 5>Anybody who has maybe gone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anybody who's ahead.</v>

3351
02:15:55.030 --> 02:15:55.681
<v Speaker 5>Here you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

3352
02:15:55.681 --> 02:15:56.880
<v Speaker 5>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come this way.</v>

3353
02:15:56.940 --> 02:15:57.773
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a responsibility that we have </v>

3354
02:15:59.071 --> 02:16:01.140
<v Speaker 5>for each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about last and Canadian businesses?</v>

3355
02:16:01.141 --> 02:16:01.561
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3356
02:16:01.561 --> 02:16:02.760
<v Speaker 5>you look at some of these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3357
02:16:02.850 --> 02:16:04.260
<v Speaker 5>in the little town where it was a little</v>
<v Speaker 5>town,</v>

3358
02:16:04.261 --> 02:16:04.951
<v Speaker 5>Eugene,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oregon,</v>

3359
02:16:04.951 --> 02:16:07.260
<v Speaker 5>where I live now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have a above Eugene,</v>

3360
02:16:07.261 --> 02:16:08.010
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3361
02:16:08.010 --> 02:16:11.180
<v Speaker 5>it's great if you're from Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>green,</v>

3362
02:16:11.210 --> 02:16:12.510
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked boulder where you live.</v>

3363
02:16:12.511 --> 02:16:13.640
<v Speaker 5>I went to college there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3364
02:16:13.890 --> 02:16:15.900
<v Speaker 5>but if you are living in a place like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3365
02:16:15.901 --> 02:16:16.734
<v Speaker 5>they have a venture capitalist angel </v>
<v Speaker 5>investor thing for people who are </v>

3366
02:16:19.861 --> 02:16:22.350
<v Speaker 5>starting small businesses and it's not a</v>
<v Speaker 5>government deal,</v>

3367
02:16:22.351 --> 02:16:24.060
<v Speaker 5>although the counties,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think of a little bit,</v>

3368
02:16:24.061 --> 02:16:24.894
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's one of those things where you </v>

3369
02:16:25.261 --> 02:16:25.921
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3370
02:16:25.921 --> 02:16:28.890
<v Speaker 5>if this is a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could we be doing more of this where you</v>

3371
02:16:29.410 --> 02:16:30.070
<v Speaker 5>joe blow</v>

3372
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:32.470
<v Speaker 3>wants to start a business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he needs $100,000</v>

3373
02:16:32.471 --> 02:16:33.304
<v Speaker 3>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3374
02:16:33.430 --> 02:16:34.263
<v Speaker 3>if you go to a bank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're never going to approve it </v>

3375
02:16:34.961 --> 02:16:36.220
<v Speaker 3>because you have too much credit card </v>
<v Speaker 3>debt.</v>

3376
02:16:36.221 --> 02:16:37.720
<v Speaker 3>Could we as a society say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3377
02:16:37.721 --> 02:16:39.700
<v Speaker 3>we have an interest in Joe blow doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3378
02:16:39.701 --> 02:16:41.950
<v Speaker 3>would that furniture company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what can we do to help?</v>

3379
02:16:42.550 --> 02:16:43.383
<v Speaker 3>I think the pie in the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the better thing would be the not have </v>

3380
02:16:45.701 --> 02:16:48.350
<v Speaker 3>alone to try to figure out how to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>without a alone.</v>

3381
02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:49.353
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful things about kickstarter and </v>

3382
02:16:51.071 --> 02:16:52.540
<v Speaker 3>go fund me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it,</v>

3383
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:53.621
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

3384
02:16:53.621 --> 02:16:56.230
<v Speaker 3>you could raise money now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't need a storefront.</v>

3385
02:16:56.260 --> 02:16:57.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need anything.</v>

3386
02:16:57.420 --> 02:16:58.121
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3387
02:16:58.121 --> 02:17:02.200
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like people need inspiration</v>

3388
02:17:02.201 --> 02:17:03.034
<v Speaker 3>and they need guidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if long as you could just start </v>

3389
02:17:06.341 --> 02:17:08.320
<v Speaker 3>moving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just get action.</v>

3390
02:17:08.321 --> 02:17:10.360
<v Speaker 3>Like you just getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just movement,</v>

3391
02:17:10.570 --> 02:17:12.730
<v Speaker 3>get such as a girl you got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3392
02:17:12.820 --> 02:17:14.830
<v Speaker 3>And folks listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the one thing you really take out</v>

3393
02:17:14.831 --> 02:17:17.830
<v Speaker 3>of this is that just try and see what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>

3394
02:17:17.831 --> 02:17:19.420
<v Speaker 3>And my stepfather had a great line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

3395
02:17:19.421 --> 02:17:21.120
<v Speaker 3>what's the worst that can happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3396
02:17:21.260 --> 02:17:22.093
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you have to think about that </v>

3397
02:17:22.991 --> 02:17:25.930
<v Speaker 3>to realize if you're scared about </v>
<v Speaker 3>failure,</v>

3398
02:17:25.931 --> 02:17:28.360
<v Speaker 3>don't be scared of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The greatest in the world have failed.</v>

3399
02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:30.820
<v Speaker 3>If you're worried about going into debt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that.</v>

3400
02:17:30.940 --> 02:17:33.550
<v Speaker 3>Don't be scared of failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think failure is awesome for you.</v>

3401
02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:35.290
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the reasons why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

3402
02:17:35.291 --> 02:17:37.670
<v Speaker 3>I like doing things that I suck at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3403
02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:38.513
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could get real complacent if you're </v>

3404
02:17:39.791 --> 02:17:42.400
<v Speaker 3>really good at something and you only do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing all the time.</v>

3405
02:17:42.401 --> 02:17:43.990
<v Speaker 3>Agree with that and you're not growing </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

3406
02:17:44.260 --> 02:17:46.210
<v Speaker 3>You're just not challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not like,</v>

3407
02:17:46.211 --> 02:17:47.860
<v Speaker 3>you're not at the bottom of the heap.</v>

3408
02:17:48.190 --> 02:17:49.023
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you start Jujitsu right now and </v>

3409
02:17:49.901 --> 02:17:50.890
<v Speaker 3>you're a white belt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

3410
02:17:50.891 --> 02:17:52.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

3411
02:17:52.421 --> 02:17:53.860
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can I ever get good at this?</v>

3412
02:17:54.130 --> 02:17:55.420
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's humbling.</v>

3413
02:17:55.540 --> 02:17:59.620
<v Speaker 3>But in that humbling thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you learn about yourself,</v>

3414
02:17:59.621 --> 02:18:02.470
<v Speaker 3>you learn about discipline and you build</v>
<v Speaker 3>up that engine,</v>

3415
02:18:02.471 --> 02:18:07.360
<v Speaker 3>that muscle that is trying to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>things out and figure things out,</v>

3416
02:18:07.361 --> 02:18:09.430
<v Speaker 3>creating a more formidable you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3417
02:18:09.490 --> 02:18:12.130
<v Speaker 3>It's a good way to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now as a historian,</v>

3418
02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:14.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and [inaudible] like to say that you are</v>

3419
02:18:14.590 --> 02:18:15.423
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would didn't teach teacher you </v>

3420
02:18:18.041 --> 02:18:20.620
<v Speaker 3>probably one of the most important </v>
<v Speaker 3>historians ever.</v>

3421
02:18:20.621 --> 02:18:21.700
<v Speaker 3>How about that fuck face.</v>

3422
02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:25.630
<v Speaker 3>Don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm speechless.</v>

3423
02:18:26.770 --> 02:18:29.620
<v Speaker 3>But as someone who is a fan of history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about this,</v>

3424
02:18:29.621 --> 02:18:31.240
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you got it more palatable for </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

3425
02:18:31.590 --> 02:18:33.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you look at,</v>

3426
02:18:33.791 --> 02:18:34.624
<v Speaker 3>what do you do you look at like what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on with this administration and </v>

3427
02:18:37.991 --> 02:18:39.820
<v Speaker 3>with this country and this the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3428
02:18:39.821 --> 02:18:44.200
<v Speaker 3>our president is he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he tweeted at the,</v>

3429
02:18:44.410 --> 02:18:48.700
<v Speaker 3>at Kim Jong [inaudible] saying that Kim </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jong owns said that I'm old.</v>

3430
02:18:48.701 --> 02:18:49.534
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why he said that because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>never say that he's short and fat and </v>

3431
02:18:51.881 --> 02:18:53.770
<v Speaker 3>like maybe we can be friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like,</v>

3432
02:18:53.771 --> 02:18:56.800
<v Speaker 3>he's like Don rickles as president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking hilarious.</v>

3433
02:18:56.801 --> 02:18:57.634
<v Speaker 3>But do you look at it in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>one day someone is going to do a </v>

3434
02:19:02.261 --> 02:19:06.850
<v Speaker 3>hardcore history series about the trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>administration?</v>

3435
02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.940
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever look at it that way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you look at it in terms of like,</v>

3436
02:19:10.330 --> 02:19:11.163
<v Speaker 3>like establishing a narrative or like </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to describe it to the two people </v>

3437
02:19:16.860 --> 02:19:19.810
<v Speaker 3>some day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're too in the Maelstrom,</v>

3438
02:19:19.830 --> 02:19:21.520
<v Speaker 3>like we said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me to figure that out,</v>

3439
02:19:21.521 --> 02:19:25.000
<v Speaker 3>I will say that I see a certain side </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefits.</v>

3440
02:19:25.001 --> 02:19:26.320
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3441
02:19:26.321 --> 02:19:28.010
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I've talked about</v>
<v Speaker 3>for many,</v>

3442
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:28.843
<v Speaker 5>many years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we did a whole six hour podcast on </v>

3443
02:19:30.411 --> 02:19:31.041
<v Speaker 5>it too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is the,</v>

3444
02:19:31.041 --> 02:19:35.270
<v Speaker 5>is the president's power to launch a </v>
<v Speaker 5>nuclear war all by himself or herself?</v>

3445
02:19:36.190 --> 02:19:36.770
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's,</v>

3446
02:19:36.770 --> 02:19:37.910
<v Speaker 5>here's the thing is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3447
02:19:37.930 --> 02:19:40.670
<v Speaker 5>that's an obvious flaw.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's,</v>

3448
02:19:40.840 --> 02:19:43.790
<v Speaker 5>and everybody understands it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but nobody's done anything about it.</v>

3449
02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:46.430
<v Speaker 5>So now because everyone's so scared of </v>
<v Speaker 5>trump,</v>

3450
02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:48.950
<v Speaker 5>they're talking about fixing a problem </v>
<v Speaker 5>that has,</v>

3451
02:19:48.951 --> 02:19:50.930
<v Speaker 5>should have been fixed decades and </v>
<v Speaker 5>decades ago.</v>

3452
02:19:51.170 --> 02:19:53.780
<v Speaker 5>Not because he's a great president and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're looking for,</v>

3453
02:19:53.870 --> 02:19:56.810
<v Speaker 5>but because they're so fricking scared </v>
<v Speaker 5>of him and he's so outside.</v>

3454
02:19:56.960 --> 02:19:57.531
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3455
02:19:57.531 --> 02:19:58.364
<v Speaker 5>it's funny because why these politicians</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they'll trust people from the other </v>

3456
02:20:02.181 --> 02:20:02.931
<v Speaker 5>parties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter.</v>

3457
02:20:02.931 --> 02:20:05.150
<v Speaker 5>You didn't hear the Democrats saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can't have George W.</v>

3458
02:20:05.150 --> 02:20:06.470
<v Speaker 5>Bush with his finger on the nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 5>button.</v>

3459
02:20:06.680 --> 02:20:07.830
<v Speaker 5>You didn't hear George W.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bush.</v>

3460
02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:10.700
<v Speaker 5>They were all fine with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As long as you're one of those insiders,</v>

3461
02:20:10.701 --> 02:20:13.220
<v Speaker 5>the first time you get an outsider in </v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

3462
02:20:13.490 --> 02:20:15.290
<v Speaker 5>now they're scared to death.</v>

3463
02:20:15.290 --> 02:20:17.810
<v Speaker 5>But they should have been scared to </v>
<v Speaker 5>death decades and decades ago.</v>

3464
02:20:18.020 --> 02:20:18.853
<v Speaker 5>So if you said that we have a trump </v>
<v Speaker 5>presidency and the only big thing that </v>

3465
02:20:21.411 --> 02:20:22.244
<v Speaker 5>comes out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as they finally fixed that one person </v>

3466
02:20:23.961 --> 02:20:26.750
<v Speaker 5>can't launch a nuclear war holocaust by </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves,</v>

3467
02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:29.450
<v Speaker 5>that's a pretty big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3468
02:20:29.451 --> 02:20:30.284
<v Speaker 5>The almost had to break a little aspect </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the system for people to freak out </v>

3469
02:20:32.781 --> 02:20:34.550
<v Speaker 5>enough to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when you think,</v>

3470
02:20:34.580 --> 02:20:36.140
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>worst case scenarios,</v>

3471
02:20:36.170 --> 02:20:37.003
<v Speaker 5>you think worst case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at World War One is a worst case </v>

3472
02:20:38.361 --> 02:20:39.600
<v Speaker 5>scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3473
02:20:39.710 --> 02:20:44.710
<v Speaker 5>if you have a person with the power to </v>
<v Speaker 5>launch a nuclear war by themselves,</v>

3474
02:20:47.090 --> 02:20:49.370
<v Speaker 5>if anybody can't see that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's an untenable,</v>

3475
02:20:49.371 --> 02:20:51.560
<v Speaker 5>horrible situation and you look at human</v>
<v Speaker 5>history and go,</v>

3476
02:20:51.561 --> 02:20:52.910
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a ticking time bomb.</v>

3477
02:20:52.940 --> 02:20:54.240
<v Speaker 5>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3478
02:20:54.320 --> 02:20:56.360
<v Speaker 5>then you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't own very much history.</v>

3479
02:20:56.510 --> 02:20:57.343
<v Speaker 5>And the fact that we've escaped decades </v>
<v Speaker 5>and decades without anybody fixing this </v>

3480
02:20:59.901 --> 02:21:00.770
<v Speaker 5>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Crazy.</v>

3481
02:21:00.830 --> 02:21:01.663
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so if the trump presidency alone caused </v>

3482
02:21:03.471 --> 02:21:06.710
<v Speaker 5>us to fix that problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd have to say that for no,</v>

3483
02:21:06.711 --> 02:21:09.470
<v Speaker 5>I mean this wasn't trump's side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he didn't want to fix that problem.</v>

3484
02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:12.590
<v Speaker 5>But as a byproduct of him getting into </v>
<v Speaker 5>office,</v>

3485
02:21:12.591 --> 02:21:13.424
<v Speaker 5>if we could fix that problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>depending on how history went in the </v>

3486
02:21:15.861 --> 02:21:17.750
<v Speaker 5>future,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could be saving 100 million lives.</v>

3487
02:21:17.820 --> 02:21:19.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could fix that problem.</v>

3488
02:21:19.501 --> 02:21:20.334
<v Speaker 3>But what if we get through the trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>administration and we move ourselves </v>

3489
02:21:22.711 --> 02:21:23.544
<v Speaker 3>into 2020 and someone really accepted </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the car dash in administration </v>

3490
02:21:27.280 --> 02:21:30.000
<v Speaker 3>after that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kanye will you do think,</v>

3491
02:21:30.001 --> 02:21:31.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a q rating,</v>

3492
02:21:31.351 --> 02:21:34.620
<v Speaker 3>the q rating is a is is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is how well your name is known,</v>

3493
02:21:34.621 --> 02:21:35.790
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if,</v>

3494
02:21:35.880 --> 02:21:36.713
<v Speaker 3>if what trump proved is that you do not </v>
<v Speaker 3>need a ton of money if you walk in the </v>

3495
02:21:40.441 --> 02:21:43.620
<v Speaker 3>door with a q rating because that's what</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other politicians wanted for.</v>

3496
02:21:43.621 --> 02:21:44.454
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he's uniquely good at ignoring his </v>

3497
02:21:47.161 --> 02:21:50.730
<v Speaker 3>fault and projecting his strengths and </v>
<v Speaker 3>being confident.</v>

3498
02:21:51.030 --> 02:21:53.310
<v Speaker 3>All those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he might be a sociopath,</v>

3499
02:21:53.640 --> 02:21:58.640
<v Speaker 3>but all those things that allow him to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that and completely ignore his faults</v>

3500
02:21:58.920 --> 02:22:03.540
<v Speaker 3>and keep constantly droning on about his</v>
<v Speaker 3>successes and how good he is.</v>

3501
02:22:03.541 --> 02:22:06.660
<v Speaker 3>It things that resonates with people in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a very weird way.</v>

3502
02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:11.670
<v Speaker 3>We respect and admire the strong man and</v>
<v Speaker 3>people give into him.</v>

3503
02:22:11.671 --> 02:22:13.980
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of halfass bay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The hate that,</v>

3504
02:22:13.981 --> 02:22:16.680
<v Speaker 3>that to me that's so anti-american </v>
<v Speaker 3>though is strong man.</v>

3505
02:22:16.710 --> 02:22:19.350
<v Speaker 3>But it is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is what happened.</v>

3506
02:22:19.351 --> 02:22:21.810
<v Speaker 3>That's why I find it distasteful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I will say this,</v>

3507
02:22:21.840 --> 02:22:22.673
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are certain things that he did </v>

3508
02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.130
<v Speaker 3>that are part of his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

3509
02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:26.993
<v Speaker 5>that worked really well because it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are so many Americans so upset </v>

3510
02:22:29.881 --> 02:22:32.600
<v Speaker 5>with the system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I remember one line from trumpet,</v>

3511
02:22:32.610 --> 02:22:35.520
<v Speaker 5>one of these debates that I thought was </v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the great lines of all time.</v>

3512
02:22:35.820 --> 02:22:39.810
<v Speaker 5>And when he turned to rand Paul after </v>
<v Speaker 5>Rand Paul slammed him and said,</v>

3513
02:22:39.811 --> 02:22:41.520
<v Speaker 5>you're not having a very good night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you?</v>

3514
02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:43.530
<v Speaker 5>And I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3515
02:22:43.531 --> 02:22:44.364
<v Speaker 5>they're not a lot of Americans who just </v>
<v Speaker 5>love anybody sticking it to these </v>

3516
02:22:48.181 --> 02:22:49.014
<v Speaker 5>politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now because everybody is so upset with </v>

3517
02:22:50.251 --> 02:22:51.084
<v Speaker 5>all the pollen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So here's a guy who's sticking it to </v>

3518
02:22:52.171 --> 02:22:52.980
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's a,</v>

3519
02:22:52.980 --> 02:22:56.130
<v Speaker 5>there's a cutting off your nose to spite</v>
<v Speaker 5>your face side of this.</v>

3520
02:22:56.131 --> 02:22:59.400
<v Speaker 5>Cause I've always wanted an outsider,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not this outsider.</v>

3521
02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:01.860
<v Speaker 5>So you say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3522
02:23:01.890 --> 02:23:04.800
<v Speaker 5>we could have had a normal human being.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause look,</v>

3523
02:23:04.980 --> 02:23:07.290
<v Speaker 5>if you want to say what trump has,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the guy,</v>

3524
02:23:07.291 --> 02:23:09.480
<v Speaker 5>so I can't diagram when he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's,</v>

3525
02:23:09.540 --> 02:23:11.580
<v Speaker 5>he's an extreme narcissist.</v>

3526
02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:12.673
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these people have narcissistic </v>

3527
02:23:14.401 --> 02:23:17.310
<v Speaker 5>complexes or you don't think I'm a good </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough guy to be president.</v>

3528
02:23:17.311 --> 02:23:18.240
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right there.</v>

3529
02:23:18.241 --> 02:23:21.120
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like you don't get through </v>
<v Speaker 5>the door without too much narcissism.</v>

3530
02:23:21.300 --> 02:23:22.920
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen this much from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3531
02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:24.090
<v Speaker 5>from anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is,</v>

3532
02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:26.130
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

3533
02:23:26.430 --> 02:23:27.263
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if if for a while that was working for </v>

3534
02:23:29.281 --> 02:23:33.510
<v Speaker 5>him because he was so outside the norms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are certain like unspoken rules of</v>

3535
02:23:33.511 --> 02:23:34.344
<v Speaker 5>things you do and behave and he violated</v>
<v Speaker 5>all those and it was refreshing to have </v>

3536
02:23:37.381 --> 02:23:39.010
<v Speaker 5>him violate them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3537
02:23:39.900 --> 02:23:40.733
<v Speaker 5>now we have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3538
02:23:41.310 --> 02:23:42.143
<v Speaker 5>well when he told Hillary Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you'd be in jail and everybody </v>

3539
02:23:44.281 --> 02:23:45.270
<v Speaker 5>went nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3540
02:23:45.271 --> 02:23:47.640
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because a lot of people cause people and</v>

3541
02:23:47.641 --> 02:23:48.660
<v Speaker 5>people and people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3542
02:23:48.690 --> 02:23:50.340
<v Speaker 5>the real thing I think a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

3543
02:23:50.341 --> 02:23:51.840
<v Speaker 5>which is tragic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I understand it,</v>

3544
02:23:51.841 --> 02:23:52.674
<v Speaker 5>is if we have to live with one of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>people for four years and listened to </v>

3545
02:23:55.351 --> 02:23:56.184
<v Speaker 5>them talk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd rather have somebody who's making </v>

3546
02:23:57.211 --> 02:23:59.010
<v Speaker 5>funny jokes that make me laugh rather </v>
<v Speaker 5>than,</v>

3547
02:23:59.250 --> 02:24:00.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody who's obviously reading another</v>

3548
02:24:00.931 --> 02:24:02.250
<v Speaker 5>prepared speech that they didn't.</v>

3549
02:24:02.260 --> 02:24:03.093
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or Sony where you really don't get a </v>

3550
02:24:04.951 --> 02:24:05.784
<v Speaker 5>sense of who they really are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a Hillary Clinton who is a career </v>

3551
02:24:07.981 --> 02:24:09.330
<v Speaker 5>politician,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a chameleon.</v>

3552
02:24:09.390 --> 02:24:13.500
<v Speaker 5>She's just saying what she thinks the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Poles are going to favor.</v>

3553
02:24:13.770 --> 02:24:15.380
<v Speaker 5>So then if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3554
02:24:16.530 --> 02:24:18.450
<v Speaker 5>if you know the part that drives me the </v>
<v Speaker 5>craziest,</v>

3555
02:24:18.490 --> 02:24:19.323
<v Speaker 5>it is 321 million people you said and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the two people that we're voting on at </v>

3556
02:24:22.801 --> 02:24:25.830
<v Speaker 5>the end of this thing or Hillary Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Donald Trump's hilarious.</v>

3557
02:24:25.860 --> 02:24:26.693
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well nobody wants that fucking </v>

3558
02:24:28.591 --> 02:24:31.140
<v Speaker 5>magnifying glass turned on their life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My stepdad said,</v>

3559
02:24:31.141 --> 02:24:34.210
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you are really August person and,</v>

3560
02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:35.153
<v Speaker 5>and you're going to sit there and say </v>
<v Speaker 5>the word to just means you're really </v>

3561
02:24:37.350 --> 02:24:39.510
<v Speaker 5>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>formidable human being.</v>

3562
02:24:39.690 --> 02:24:40.800
<v Speaker 5>How do you spell it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like August.</v>

3563
02:24:40.801 --> 02:24:41.550
<v Speaker 5>August.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3564
02:24:41.550 --> 02:24:42.920
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you sit down and if you're,</v>

3565
02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:43.943
<v Speaker 5>he said they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those kinds of people divide a piece of </v>

3566
02:24:45.451 --> 02:24:46.284
<v Speaker 5>paper in half and they write pros on one</v>
<v Speaker 5>side and cons on the other and they </v>

3567
02:24:49.651 --> 02:24:51.950
<v Speaker 5>running for president and they go down </v>
<v Speaker 5>the pros and the cons and go,</v>

3568
02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:53.210
<v Speaker 5>he goes to cons.</v>

3569
02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:57.130
<v Speaker 5>Outnumbered the pros five to one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might be 100 million.</v>

3570
02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:59.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to have as much power as I</v>
<v Speaker 5>have now.</v>

3571
02:24:59.220 --> 02:24:59.641
<v Speaker 5>I Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

3572
02:24:59.641 --> 02:24:59.921
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

3573
02:24:59.921 --> 02:25:00.930
<v Speaker 5>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's going to hate you.</v>

3574
02:25:00.931 --> 02:25:01.900
<v Speaker 5>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's so,</v>

3575
02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:04.950
<v Speaker 5>so people who are really intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they do that calculation,</v>

3576
02:25:04.951 --> 02:25:06.570
<v Speaker 5>the calculation says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't run for president.</v>

3577
02:25:06.571 --> 02:25:07.980
<v Speaker 5>You'd be an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now he says,</v>

3578
02:25:07.981 --> 02:25:08.814
<v Speaker 5>people though who run anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's because something on the pro side </v>

3579
02:25:12.181 --> 02:25:16.800
<v Speaker 5>outweighs everything on the con side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I want to be on tv all the time,</v>

3580
02:25:16.920 --> 02:25:18.660
<v Speaker 5>or I want to be the most powerful person</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the world,</v>

3581
02:25:18.690 --> 02:25:20.460
<v Speaker 5>or it's the natural extension.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been a senator,</v>

3582
02:25:20.461 --> 02:25:21.360
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is.</v>

3583
02:25:21.361 --> 02:25:24.250
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some ego question that's out</v>

3584
02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:26.920
<v Speaker 1>that that's drowning all the columns </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3585
02:25:27.100 --> 02:25:27.933
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why you have to be careful </v>

3586
02:25:29.051 --> 02:25:29.884
<v Speaker 1>because that's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so either have somebody who's not </v>

3587
02:25:31.121 --> 02:25:31.954
<v Speaker 1>intelligent enough to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to weigh the pros and cons or somebody </v>

3588
02:25:33.371 --> 02:25:34.204
<v Speaker 1>who's so smart that the cons outweigh </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pros and they choose to do it </v>

3589
02:25:37.070 --> 02:25:39.310
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a crazy system.</v>

3590
02:25:39.311 --> 02:25:40.144
<v Speaker 1>When you think that that is the way we </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop a person who is going to be in </v>

3591
02:25:43.811 --> 02:25:44.644
<v Speaker 1>control of nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a popularity contest where to </v>

3592
02:25:48.191 --> 02:25:50.800
<v Speaker 1>when the popularity contest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is totally,</v>

3593
02:25:51.220 --> 02:25:52.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a elective,</v>

3594
02:25:52.631 --> 02:25:54.470
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to join,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to,</v>

3595
02:25:54.480 --> 02:25:58.230
<v Speaker 1>to get into this contest and to win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna,</v>

3596
02:25:58.270 --> 02:26:00.310
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're life's going to be torn apart.</v>

3597
02:26:00.340 --> 02:26:01.173
<v Speaker 1>They're going to go over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are going to lie about you and </v>

3598
02:26:03.340 --> 02:26:05.160
<v Speaker 1>look at your favorite person and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

3599
02:26:05.161 --> 02:26:05.994
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go look at some of these candidates </v>

3600
02:26:06.551 --> 02:26:08.010
<v Speaker 1>from the past that we'd like to lionize.</v>

3601
02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Would they have even made it through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>process today?</v>

3602
02:26:09.821 --> 02:26:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Imagine what Kennedy would have had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>jog and then it with John Kennedy,</v>

3603
02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:13.953
<v Speaker 1>the kind of things that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd have all these women coming </v>

3604
02:26:15.401 --> 02:26:16.960
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine it?</v>

3605
02:26:16.961 --> 02:26:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Who had never made it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The doctor feelgood's would show up.</v>

3606
02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:20.741
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3607
02:26:20.741 --> 02:26:23.170
<v Speaker 1>They used to give him like amphetamines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3608
02:26:23.530 --> 02:26:26.580
<v Speaker 1>You had like some serious disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Addison's disease.</v>

3609
02:26:27.490 --> 02:26:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Glandula a problem with the glands where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not providing adrenaline.</v>

3610
02:26:30.971 --> 02:26:32.320
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't quote me on that.</v>

3611
02:26:32.350 --> 02:26:33.183
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they had him on some sort of </v>

3612
02:26:34.091 --> 02:26:35.330
<v Speaker 1>amphetamines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

3613
02:26:35.350 --> 02:26:36.183
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was apparently on a lot of </v>

3614
02:26:36.851 --> 02:26:37.684
<v Speaker 1>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he had the last rights given to </v>

3615
02:26:38.951 --> 02:26:41.320
<v Speaker 1>him once before because he came so close</v>
<v Speaker 1>to dying.</v>

3616
02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:42.873
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and truthfully I read that it impacted </v>

3617
02:26:45.251 --> 02:26:48.820
<v Speaker 1>the way he kind of saw his life cause he</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't expect it to be a long life.</v>

3618
02:26:49.090 --> 02:26:50.860
<v Speaker 1>And so it impacted on how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you,</v>

3619
02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:52.000
<v Speaker 1>if somebody told you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

3620
02:26:52.001 --> 02:26:52.834
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're not going to have a long </v>

3621
02:26:53.861 --> 02:26:54.694
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much does that change the way you </v>

3622
02:26:56.111 --> 02:26:58.450
<v Speaker 1>live the rest of your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably live crazy.</v>

3623
02:26:58.451 --> 02:26:59.284
<v Speaker 1>You probably go navy skiing every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd skydiving or maybe you try to try </v>

3624
02:27:02.411 --> 02:27:06.670
<v Speaker 1>to get the things on your bucket list in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of accomplishments done quick more</v>

3625
02:27:06.671 --> 02:27:07.850
<v Speaker 1>quickly or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3626
02:27:08.290 --> 02:27:09.123
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you look at someone like that and </v>

3627
02:27:09.641 --> 02:27:10.930
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could a guy like that it made it through</v>

3628
02:27:10.931 --> 02:27:12.640
<v Speaker 1>the process?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could Lyndon Johnson and made it through</v>

3629
02:27:12.641 --> 02:27:13.870
<v Speaker 1>the process get richer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3630
02:27:13.871 --> 02:27:14.704
<v Speaker 1>all those people lived at a time period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a lot less of a fishbowl than </v>

3631
02:27:17.891 --> 02:27:18.724
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you say that these great leaders </v>

3632
02:27:19.871 --> 02:27:22.330
<v Speaker 1>can't make it through the process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the only people that make it through</v>

3633
02:27:22.331 --> 02:27:24.160
<v Speaker 1>the process are the ones who've been so </v>
<v Speaker 1>careful,</v>

3634
02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:27.350
<v Speaker 1>never taken a risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lied like crazy co.</v>

3635
02:27:27.370 --> 02:27:28.203
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you say those are the only people </v>

3636
02:27:29.141 --> 02:27:29.974
<v Speaker 1>that can make it through the process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe that explains why we 321 </v>

3637
02:27:32.290 --> 02:27:35.020
<v Speaker 1>million people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the choice we end up with at the</v>

3638
02:27:35.020 --> 02:27:35.351
<v Speaker 1>end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3639
02:27:35.351 --> 02:27:36.184
<v Speaker 1>we also have this problem where we look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at someone's entire life and we look at </v>

3640
02:27:40.421 --> 02:27:41.254
<v Speaker 1>all the different things that they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we decide whether or not we accept </v>

3641
02:27:44.561 --> 02:27:45.394
<v Speaker 1>certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're not talking about whether or </v>

3642
02:27:46.961 --> 02:27:49.380
<v Speaker 1>not someone's honest with business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you,</v>

3643
02:27:49.420 --> 02:27:51.400
<v Speaker 1>we want you to be honest with </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

3644
02:27:51.430 --> 02:27:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be,</v>

3645
02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:54.770
<v Speaker 1>you gotta get c average and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have an a in here.</v>

3646
02:27:54.790 --> 02:27:57.280
<v Speaker 1>And it wouldn't be the truly great </v>
<v Speaker 1>people as we know,</v>

3647
02:27:57.290 --> 02:27:59.470
<v Speaker 1>often very flawed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very flawed.</v>

3648
02:27:59.471 --> 02:28:03.880
<v Speaker 1>And also like what percentage of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who want to be leaders.</v>

3649
02:28:03.881 --> 02:28:05.290
<v Speaker 1>I think about that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3650
02:28:05.470 --> 02:28:08.530
<v Speaker 1>You want to be the one on the podium </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling everybody what's up.</v>

3651
02:28:09.160 --> 02:28:11.410
<v Speaker 1>What percentage of those guys want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck other women?</v>

3652
02:28:11.560 --> 02:28:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Is it a hundred right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3653
02:28:14.710 --> 02:28:17.290
<v Speaker 1>I can't answer that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you think about like nature,</v>

3654
02:28:17.380 --> 02:28:21.860
<v Speaker 1>like the natural leader types,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like throughout human history,</v>

3655
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:24.530
<v Speaker 3>what percentage of those have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>monogamous?</v>

3656
02:28:24.800 --> 02:28:29.630
<v Speaker 3>Those ones who want to control the army,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones who want to run the thing.</v>

3657
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:34.370
<v Speaker 3>The ones who want to be at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting everybody to do their bidding.</v>

3658
02:28:34.490 --> 02:28:35.323
<v Speaker 3>The ones who want to have all the money </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the power and live in the </v>

3659
02:28:37.671 --> 02:28:41.600
<v Speaker 3>castle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys are almost all adulterers,</v>

3660
02:28:41.940 --> 02:28:42.950
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

3661
02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:43.813
<v Speaker 3>It does argue for the idea that it might</v>
<v Speaker 3>be better to appoint somebody who </v>

3662
02:28:48.021 --> 02:28:50.150
<v Speaker 3>doesn't want the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like somebody had talked to him,</v>

3663
02:28:50.151 --> 02:28:51.770
<v Speaker 3>he wants to talk about that with police </v>
<v Speaker 3>officers.</v>

3664
02:28:51.771 --> 02:28:52.940
<v Speaker 3>And they had said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

3665
02:28:53.300 --> 02:28:54.133
<v Speaker 3>there are all kinds of police officers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're the one who wants the job </v>

3666
02:28:57.530 --> 02:28:58.363
<v Speaker 3>because you're going to chase bad guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you want that adrenaline rush and </v>

3667
02:29:00.891 --> 02:29:01.724
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not the guy who should get the </v>

3668
02:29:02.151 --> 02:29:04.340
<v Speaker 3>job or if the guy wants respect.</v>

3669
02:29:04.340 --> 02:29:05.150
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But well like,</v>

3670
02:29:05.150 --> 02:29:08.210
<v Speaker 3>and you can see the funny thing is is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and somebody sent this to me a long time</v>

3671
02:29:08.211 --> 02:29:08.890
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they showed a,</v>

3672
02:29:08.890 --> 02:29:10.880
<v Speaker 3>there's all these different um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like um,</v>

3673
02:29:10.940 --> 02:29:13.670
<v Speaker 3>recruitment videos that the different </v>
<v Speaker 3>police agencies have.</v>

3674
02:29:13.671 --> 02:29:15.530
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some of them are more like,</v>

3675
02:29:15.650 --> 02:29:18.110
<v Speaker 3>you can get cats out of trees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can help old ladies.</v>

3676
02:29:18.260 --> 02:29:19.740
<v Speaker 3>And some of them are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can try traffic,</v>

3677
02:29:19.741 --> 02:29:20.574
<v Speaker 3>great car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3678
02:29:20.580 --> 02:29:21.940
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the funny thing is,</v>

3679
02:29:22.010 --> 02:29:26.450
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine that that influences the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of people that answer your ad.</v>

3680
02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:27.160
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

3681
02:29:27.160 --> 02:29:27.993
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have billboards in La for to try </v>

3682
02:29:30.141 --> 02:29:32.990
<v Speaker 3>where they used to at least to try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hire new cops.</v>

3683
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:34.910
<v Speaker 3>And they did it based on the money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3684
02:29:34.911 --> 02:29:35.744
<v Speaker 3>this is how much money you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>La PD is paying this mount and they'd </v>

3685
02:29:38.781 --> 02:29:40.220
<v Speaker 3>show and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drive by like,</v>

3686
02:29:40.250 --> 02:29:41.510
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can make that amount.</v>

3687
02:29:41.700 --> 02:29:43.160
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should try to do that.</v>

3688
02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:45.830
<v Speaker 3>John.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you appointed cops see a billboard,</v>

3689
02:29:45.831 --> 02:29:48.680
<v Speaker 3>what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you're advertising,</v>

3690
02:29:48.681 --> 02:29:51.590
<v Speaker 3>it's the same problem you have when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're advertising for drug companies.</v>

3691
02:29:51.860 --> 02:29:53.540
<v Speaker 3>You get people thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3692
02:29:53.541 --> 02:29:55.460
<v Speaker 3>maybe I need that abilify,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my life.</v>

3693
02:29:55.610 --> 02:29:57.160
<v Speaker 3>Oh humira.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woo.</v>

3694
02:29:57.170 --> 02:29:59.750
<v Speaker 3>I need that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that seems like I liked the music,</v>

3695
02:29:59.751 --> 02:30:01.850
<v Speaker 3>their plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like everybody's dancing.</v>

3696
02:30:01.970 --> 02:30:03.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like how that cop looks up there.</v>

3697
02:30:03.711 --> 02:30:05.210
<v Speaker 3>He looks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he looks for medieval.</v>

3698
02:30:05.300 --> 02:30:06.860
<v Speaker 3>He looks like Amanda gets respect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

3699
02:30:06.861 --> 02:30:07.694
<v Speaker 3>he's got his hands on his hips and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>got a nice car behind him and look as a </v>

3700
02:30:10.551 --> 02:30:13.760
<v Speaker 3>female co squad leader with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if he fucks her.</v>

3701
02:30:13.940 --> 02:30:14.773
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people start to look at an ad and </v>

3702
02:30:16.521 --> 02:30:20.120
<v Speaker 3>you start imagining yourself in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>position of that person,</v>

3703
02:30:20.121 --> 02:30:22.150
<v Speaker 3>in that Ad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then next thing you know,</v>

3704
02:30:22.151 --> 02:30:22.984
<v Speaker 3>you know you're the one who was going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go get the bad guys and you're the one </v>

3705
02:30:25.011 --> 02:30:25.844
<v Speaker 3>who's going to go.</v>

3706
02:30:25.940 --> 02:30:28.100
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you talk to a real cop,</v>

3707
02:30:28.101 --> 02:30:31.280
<v Speaker 3>like a good cop is someone who respects </v>
<v Speaker 3>community,</v>

3708
02:30:31.281 --> 02:30:32.114
<v Speaker 3>someone who wants to help someone who </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to establish some sort of a bond </v>

3709
02:30:35.661 --> 02:30:37.240
<v Speaker 3>with the people that are in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

3710
02:30:37.241 --> 02:30:38.074
<v Speaker 3>The patrols th like that's why they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to do in some neighborhoods are </v>

3711
02:30:40.881 --> 02:30:41.714
<v Speaker 3>trying to have more people on foot and </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually walk through the streets and </v>

3712
02:30:44.930 --> 02:30:47.030
<v Speaker 3>become a part of the community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like don't,</v>

3713
02:30:47.210 --> 02:30:49.340
<v Speaker 3>you're not an outsider that's patrolling</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3714
02:30:49.341 --> 02:30:50.930
<v Speaker 3>You're actually one of the people that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3715
02:30:51.260 --> 02:30:53.990
<v Speaker 3>It goes to what we were saying about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>politicians that are tied it all in.</v>

3716
02:30:54.020 --> 02:30:55.790
<v Speaker 3>Why are you doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3717
02:30:55.970 --> 02:30:56.803
<v Speaker 3>Are you doing this because you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be the person at the podium that </v>

3718
02:30:58.371 --> 02:30:59.001
<v Speaker 3>everybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3719
02:30:59.001 --> 02:30:59.834
<v Speaker 3>admiring the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to be the person that </v>

3720
02:31:00.531 --> 02:31:01.364
<v Speaker 3>everyone's talking about or are you </v>
<v Speaker 3>sincerely interested in public service </v>

3721
02:31:04.610 --> 02:31:05.630
<v Speaker 3>and helping things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3722
02:31:05.780 --> 02:31:06.613
<v Speaker 3>what if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can think of 20 people that you would </v>

3723
02:31:10.311 --> 02:31:11.144
<v Speaker 3>say got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be interesting to see what that </v>

3724
02:31:12.591 --> 02:31:14.990
<v Speaker 3>person would do in the presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3725
02:31:14.991 --> 02:31:16.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like you said,</v>

3726
02:31:16.280 --> 02:31:18.970
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine any of them wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do it to,</v>

3727
02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:20.040
<v Speaker 3>none of them are going to want to do</v>

3728
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:21.660
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mark Cuban has want to be the president.</v>

3729
02:31:21.690 --> 02:31:23.580
<v Speaker 4>Elon Musk's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want to be the president.</v>

3730
02:31:23.850 --> 02:31:28.170
<v Speaker 4>I think we really need a council.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the idea of one second,</v>

3731
02:31:29.020 --> 02:31:31.050
<v Speaker 5>that's what it's supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember,</v>

3732
02:31:31.220 --> 02:31:32.053
<v Speaker 5>we're supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if everybody remembers their founding </v>

3733
02:31:33.621 --> 02:31:36.830
<v Speaker 5>father federalist papers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the presidency was a much,</v>

3734
02:31:36.831 --> 02:31:38.540
<v Speaker 5>much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>much less powerful job.</v>

3735
02:31:38.570 --> 02:31:39.403
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was a country that was run by the </v>

3736
02:31:40.911 --> 02:31:43.700
<v Speaker 5>legislative branch basically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3737
02:31:43.730 --> 02:31:45.890
<v Speaker 5>we're not that way anymore because of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole bunch of things,</v>

3738
02:31:45.891 --> 02:31:47.960
<v Speaker 5>including the nuclear weapons thing we </v>
<v Speaker 5>talked about earlier.</v>

3739
02:31:48.260 --> 02:31:49.093
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3740
02:31:49.120 --> 02:31:54.120
<v Speaker 5>the atomic age changed the presidency </v>
<v Speaker 5>because of the need to have one person.</v>

3741
02:31:55.700 --> 02:31:59.270
<v Speaker 5>You couldn't declare war anymore because</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if the missiles are on their way to</v>

3742
02:31:59.271 --> 02:32:00.800
<v Speaker 5>you now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3743
02:32:00.860 --> 02:32:03.530
<v Speaker 5>Can you really go to Congress and debate</v>
<v Speaker 5>it and have the no,</v>

3744
02:32:03.531 --> 02:32:07.160
<v Speaker 5>you needed a person who within 10 </v>
<v Speaker 5>minutes could launch a counter strike.</v>

3745
02:32:07.370 --> 02:32:08.203
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well how much power does that take out </v>

3746
02:32:09.650 --> 02:32:13.220
<v Speaker 5>of the hands of the legislature who was </v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be running things?</v>

3747
02:32:13.221 --> 02:32:15.740
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why do we not declare war anymore?</v>

3748
02:32:16.310 --> 02:32:18.560
<v Speaker 5>We haven't declared war since the Second</v>
<v Speaker 5>World War.</v>

3749
02:32:18.770 --> 02:32:19.603
<v Speaker 5>We have a country that the constitution </v>
<v Speaker 5>says you can't go to war without a </v>

3750
02:32:22.251 --> 02:32:25.460
<v Speaker 5>declaration is certainly not that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can get some barbary pirates cleared out</v>

3751
02:32:25.461 --> 02:32:26.960
<v Speaker 5>of North Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can't,</v>

3752
02:32:26.961 --> 02:32:28.400
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why Congress,</v>

3753
02:32:28.401 --> 02:32:29.750
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the trump thing,</v>

3754
02:32:29.751 --> 02:32:30.584
<v Speaker 5>is they want to say that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>launch nuclear weapons unless less </v>

3755
02:32:33.171 --> 02:32:36.860
<v Speaker 5>congress has declared war first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which creates this wonderful thing about</v>

3756
02:32:36.861 --> 02:32:39.740
<v Speaker 5>trying to figure out if we can sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>retroactively,</v>

3757
02:32:40.030 --> 02:32:40.863
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>replace a power that's been gone since </v>

3758
02:32:43.311 --> 02:32:45.280
<v Speaker 5>1942.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3759
02:32:45.370 --> 02:32:46.203
<v Speaker 5>when we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we declared war on like Romania and </v>

3760
02:32:48.351 --> 02:32:49.184
<v Speaker 5>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You did the subsidiary powers in the </v>

3761
02:32:50.571 --> 02:32:52.520
<v Speaker 5>Second World War and that's the last </v>
<v Speaker 5>time it's been done.</v>

3762
02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:53.593
<v Speaker 5>But according to the constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we shouldn't have been able to fight a </v>

3763
02:32:55.281 --> 02:32:56.570
<v Speaker 5>war since without that.</v>

3764
02:32:56.960 --> 02:32:57.793
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be very interesting to see</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens in 2020 it's going to be </v>

3765
02:33:00.291 --> 02:33:04.280
<v Speaker 4>really interesting and I to to remove </v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the power that the president has</v>

3766
02:33:04.281 --> 02:33:05.114
<v Speaker 4>is going to be a really big uphill </v>
<v Speaker 4>battle unless some would actually drops </v>

3767
02:33:07.701 --> 02:33:11.600
<v Speaker 4>a nuke on somebody unless trump decides </v>
<v Speaker 4>to bomb North Korea.</v>

3768
02:33:11.870 --> 02:33:13.940
<v Speaker 4>Like Kim John owns says something about </v>
<v Speaker 4>his wife,</v>

3769
02:33:13.941 --> 02:33:14.960
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>could you piece of shit?</v>

3770
02:33:14.990 --> 02:33:15.823
<v Speaker 4>You fucking launches a bomb Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless it's something so egregious and </v>

3771
02:33:18.501 --> 02:33:19.334
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be really hard to dial </v>

3772
02:33:21.501 --> 02:33:22.334
<v Speaker 4>back the power without any real specific</v>
<v Speaker 4>need because people are going to </v>

3773
02:33:25.311 --> 02:33:28.160
<v Speaker 4>concentrate on all the other issues that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the country faces economically,</v>

3774
02:33:28.400 --> 02:33:30.800
<v Speaker 4>militarily,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the need for health care,</v>

3775
02:33:30.801 --> 02:33:32.120
<v Speaker 4>the need for to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3776
02:33:32.121 --> 02:33:32.954
<v Speaker 4>environmental standards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are we gonna do about global </v>

3777
02:33:34.281 --> 02:33:35.114
<v Speaker 4>warming?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many issues that take the </v>

3778
02:33:36.561 --> 02:33:40.100
<v Speaker 4>front stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea of someone actually launching a</v>

3779
02:33:40.101 --> 02:33:43.190
<v Speaker 4>nuclear attack seems so distant and </v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous,</v>

3780
02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:44.193
<v Speaker 4>but that's not going to be on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>forefront of everybody's like list of </v>

3781
02:33:46.101 --> 02:33:47.450
<v Speaker 4>priorities of things to handle.</v>

3782
02:33:47.640 --> 02:33:48.473
<v Speaker 5>Makes me think of Eisenhower ordering </v>
<v Speaker 5>the local German population at the end </v>

3783
02:33:54.001 --> 02:33:58.800
<v Speaker 5>of the Second World War to go tour the </v>
<v Speaker 5>death camps themselves and actually have</v>

3784
02:33:58.801 --> 02:33:59.634
<v Speaker 5>to walk past piles and piles and piles </v>
<v Speaker 5>of human bodies because he wanted them </v>

3785
02:34:03.571 --> 02:34:06.030
<v Speaker 5>to not forget why are going to look at </v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

3786
02:34:06.360 --> 02:34:06.871
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3787
02:34:06.871 --> 02:34:07.704
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know he did that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when you look at the end of the </v>

3788
02:34:09.151 --> 02:34:10.350
<v Speaker 5>world wars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

3789
02:34:10.351 --> 02:34:14.130
<v Speaker 5>in both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people were so shocked by what happened.</v>

3790
02:34:14.131 --> 02:34:16.050
<v Speaker 5>You get this idea that we're never </v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

3791
02:34:16.051 --> 02:34:17.680
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're never going to let this again.</v>

3792
02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:21.250
<v Speaker 1>But you get a generation later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two generations later.</v>

3793
02:34:21.251 --> 02:34:24.610
<v Speaker 1>How long does it take for those lessons </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fade away?</v>

3794
02:34:24.910 --> 02:34:25.743
<v Speaker 1>So when I hear or read on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably some 13 year old boy in </v>

3795
02:34:28.421 --> 02:34:29.590
<v Speaker 1>his basement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you never know.</v>

3796
02:34:29.800 --> 02:34:30.880
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the racial stuff,</v>

3797
02:34:30.881 --> 02:34:33.340
<v Speaker 1>I always think to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you only,</v>

3798
02:34:33.341 --> 02:34:35.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we need some dead bodies out there</v>

3799
02:34:35.441 --> 02:34:37.600
<v Speaker 1>so you can go see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what it looks like,</v>

3800
02:34:37.630 --> 02:34:39.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not fooling around here.</v>

3801
02:34:39.371 --> 02:34:41.930
<v Speaker 1>This kind of stuff leads to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3802
02:34:41.950 --> 02:34:45.340
<v Speaker 1>stop fooling around with 140 characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>and look at what real death tastes,</v>

3803
02:34:45.341 --> 02:34:46.174
<v Speaker 1>smells like and what the long term </v>
<v Speaker 1>ramifications of pushing these sorts of </v>

3804
02:34:49.751 --> 02:34:53.350
<v Speaker 1>attitudes can lead to and has over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over again.</v>

3805
02:34:53.470 --> 02:34:54.303
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a real problem with the </v>

3806
02:34:55.241 --> 02:34:58.990
<v Speaker 1>human condition when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>complacency and comfort.</v>

3807
02:34:59.050 --> 02:34:59.883
<v Speaker 1>And I think that we get real comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>in real complacent and we have a very </v>

3808
02:35:02.861 --> 02:35:05.830
<v Speaker 1>distorted idea of what life is without </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle.</v>

3809
02:35:06.070 --> 02:35:10.180
<v Speaker 1>And there's a great book by Sebastian </v>
<v Speaker 1>younger who was on last week and uh,</v>

3810
02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:13.300
<v Speaker 1>it's called tribe and he did a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>storm too,</v>

3811
02:35:13.301 --> 02:35:14.890
<v Speaker 1>is wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>

3812
02:35:15.130 --> 02:35:15.963
<v Speaker 1>But talking to him about what happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>when people overcome significant </v>

3813
02:35:22.361 --> 02:35:25.300
<v Speaker 1>tragedies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's war or whether it's natural</v>

3814
02:35:25.301 --> 02:35:27.760
<v Speaker 1>disasters or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in,</v>

3815
02:35:28.210 --> 02:35:32.530
<v Speaker 1>I was in New York right after nine 11 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was palpable,</v>

3816
02:35:32.590 --> 02:35:35.590
<v Speaker 1>the sense of community and how friendly </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were.</v>

3817
02:35:35.860 --> 02:35:36.693
<v Speaker 1>And it was because people had had their </v>
<v Speaker 1>world shaken up by an attack and it </v>

3818
02:35:40.241 --> 02:35:41.074
<v Speaker 1>literally did good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really did good for the people that </v>

3819
02:35:43.871 --> 02:35:44.704
<v Speaker 1>survive in a fucked up way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it makes me think of that project </v>

3820
02:35:47.051 --> 02:35:50.140
<v Speaker 1>for a new America document that before </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine 11 had said that there's,</v>

3821
02:35:50.380 --> 02:35:51.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without some kind of Pearl Harbor style </v>

3822
02:35:52.901 --> 02:35:53.734
<v Speaker 1>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American system is designed right </v>

3823
02:35:55.181 --> 02:35:57.550
<v Speaker 1>now in a way where people are gonna pull</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart more and more.</v>

3824
02:35:58.150 --> 02:35:59.140
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just saying,</v>

3825
02:35:59.141 --> 02:35:59.974
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can almost wish for something like </v>

3826
02:36:01.091 --> 02:36:01.924
<v Speaker 1>that to happen to pull us together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was horrible thought </v>

3827
02:36:04.571 --> 02:36:05.111
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3828
02:36:05.111 --> 02:36:05.944
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe maybe it's the only way we </v>

3829
02:36:07.121 --> 02:36:07.954
<v Speaker 1>learn and you need the refresher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I think people need war </v>

3830
02:36:10.511 --> 02:36:13.030
<v Speaker 1>in their own life and I think they need </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle.</v>

3831
02:36:13.090 --> 02:36:13.923
<v Speaker 1>I need structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need something to do in their own </v>

3832
02:36:16.001 --> 02:36:16.834
<v Speaker 1>life that's incredibly difficult to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>them from being this to many of us not </v>

3833
02:36:20.201 --> 02:36:21.850
<v Speaker 1>place it in mundane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was,</v>

3834
02:36:21.940 --> 02:36:24.600
<v Speaker 1>when I was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to localize the story from the,</v>

3835
02:36:24.601 --> 02:36:25.434
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Yugoslavian civil war that we were </v>

3836
02:36:26.561 --> 02:36:27.394
<v Speaker 1>just talking about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed a Croatian man in Eugene </v>

3837
02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:31.113
<v Speaker 1>and we were talking about it and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing up these age old hatreds and </v>

3838
02:36:33.641 --> 02:36:34.391
<v Speaker 1>basically saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3839
02:36:34.391 --> 02:36:35.920
<v Speaker 1>they've always hated each other and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped me.</v>

3840
02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:36.221
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3841
02:36:36.221 --> 02:36:36.671
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>

3842
02:36:36.671 --> 02:36:37.600
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

3843
02:36:37.601 --> 02:36:38.890
<v Speaker 1>we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

3844
02:36:39.130 --> 02:36:41.920
<v Speaker 1>up until recently we were intermarrying </v>
<v Speaker 1>with each other.</v>

3845
02:36:42.010 --> 02:36:43.870
<v Speaker 1>We got along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all working out.</v>

3846
02:36:43.871 --> 02:36:44.920
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know what changed?</v>

3847
02:36:44.921 --> 02:36:45.251
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3848
02:36:45.251 --> 02:36:46.390
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economy tanked.</v>

3849
02:36:46.750 --> 02:36:49.000
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden he goes,</v>

3850
02:36:49.001 --> 02:36:53.080
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that started to </v>
<v Speaker 1>resurface when everybody was just hating</v>

3851
02:36:53.081 --> 02:36:54.390
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives and the,</v>

3852
02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:55.930
<v Speaker 1>and everything he has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden,</v>

3853
02:36:55.931 --> 02:36:59.350
<v Speaker 1>all these old things that had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>buried just came right back.</v>

3854
02:36:59.710 --> 02:37:01.750
<v Speaker 1>And so that tribalism you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about were younger.</v>

3855
02:37:02.020 --> 02:37:03.760
<v Speaker 1>I think there are times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you had mentioned it,</v>

3856
02:37:03.761 --> 02:37:04.594
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>post postwar errors these times when </v>

3857
02:37:06.041 --> 02:37:07.420
<v Speaker 1>they go away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most disasters,</v>

3858
02:37:07.950 --> 02:37:10.270
<v Speaker 1>but then certain kinds of conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

3859
02:37:10.271 --> 02:37:12.460
<v Speaker 1>terrible economic conditions for too </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people.</v>

3860
02:37:12.670 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 1>It's funny how quickly the scape goats </v>
<v Speaker 1>come and and</v>

3861
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:17.670
<v Speaker 5>things that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean truthfully,</v>

3862
02:37:17.671 --> 02:37:20.510
<v Speaker 5>you mean the biggest thing that I've </v>
<v Speaker 5>missed politically in terms of just,</v>

3863
02:37:20.810 --> 02:37:23.540
<v Speaker 5>I just didn't see it was the resurgence </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the racism,</v>

3864
02:37:23.541 --> 02:37:24.710
<v Speaker 5>bigotry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>prejudice thing.</v>

3865
02:37:24.711 --> 02:37:25.790
<v Speaker 5>I mean I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3866
02:37:25.791 --> 02:37:26.624
<v Speaker 5>we grew up in the era where our country </v>
<v Speaker 5>was trying to figure out through things </v>

3867
02:37:28.851 --> 02:37:31.370
<v Speaker 5>like broadcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how we transition.</v>

3868
02:37:31.371 --> 02:37:33.260
<v Speaker 5>So you remember all in the family when </v>
<v Speaker 5>it started?</v>

3869
02:37:33.261 --> 02:37:34.094
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a show that doesn't even run very </v>

3870
02:37:34.881 --> 02:37:35.714
<v Speaker 5>much anymore because simply trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>address those issues is too hot button </v>

3871
02:37:39.171 --> 02:37:40.550
<v Speaker 5>for most advertisers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

3872
02:37:40.580 --> 02:37:42.580
<v Speaker 5>You could never have an archibald.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3873
02:37:42.590 --> 02:37:43.423
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that whole show was part of </v>

3874
02:37:44.661 --> 02:37:49.661
<v Speaker 5>society's attempt to transition from an </v>
<v Speaker 5>era where it wasn't that long beforehand</v>

3875
02:37:49.941 --> 02:37:53.390
<v Speaker 5>where you couldn't stay in a hotel that </v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't a black or a white person's hotel</v>

3876
02:37:53.391 --> 02:37:55.670
<v Speaker 5>in the south to one where we got now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I always thought,</v>

3877
02:37:55.671 --> 02:37:56.504
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the message of Archie bunker was they </v>

3878
02:37:57.771 --> 02:37:58.604
<v Speaker 5>would try to teach him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the young people would try to teach you </v>

3879
02:38:00.921 --> 02:38:01.754
<v Speaker 5>about how to be a more open human being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it didn't matter because the archie </v>

3880
02:38:04.761 --> 02:38:06.440
<v Speaker 5>bunker's of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to die off.</v>

3881
02:38:06.590 --> 02:38:08.330
<v Speaker 5>They were the dinosaurs from another </v>
<v Speaker 5>era.</v>

3882
02:38:08.331 --> 02:38:11.180
<v Speaker 5>And eventually that would be a way of </v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at things.</v>

3883
02:38:11.181 --> 02:38:12.900
<v Speaker 5>That was in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

3884
02:38:13.010 --> 02:38:14.750
<v Speaker 5>I thought that that was what it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be.</v>

3885
02:38:15.050 --> 02:38:17.090
<v Speaker 5>And I never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never saw the resurgence,</v>

3886
02:38:17.091 --> 02:38:17.924
<v Speaker 5>but like my Croatian friend had said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just maybe things had to get bad enough </v>

3887
02:38:21.231 --> 02:38:24.290
<v Speaker 5>economically and whatever for all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>tribal things to just come back.</v>

3888
02:38:24.291 --> 02:38:26.810
<v Speaker 5>Cause that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's something deep in us that that's</v>

3889
02:38:26.811 --> 02:38:29.780
<v Speaker 5>all embedded in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's far less of those people</v>

3890
02:38:29.790 --> 02:38:32.860
<v Speaker 5>that are allowed for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

3891
02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:34.100
<v Speaker 5>that's done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Me Too.</v>

3892
02:38:34.220 --> 02:38:35.053
<v Speaker 5>And it's so homogenized when he's seen </v>
<v Speaker 5>what they're fucking home depot torches </v>

3893
02:38:37.821 --> 02:38:38.654
<v Speaker 5>walking on this tree,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Tiki torches dorks that the whole </v>

3894
02:38:41.601 --> 02:38:43.580
<v Speaker 5>thing was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what did you hear Richard Spencer?</v>

3895
02:38:43.581 --> 02:38:44.351
<v Speaker 5>He did the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3896
02:38:44.351 --> 02:38:45.800
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the white supremacists.</v>

3897
02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:47.270
<v Speaker 5>But if he did it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he did an,</v>

3898
02:38:47.330 --> 02:38:48.163
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an interview about two weeks ago where </v>

3899
02:38:49.461 --> 02:38:50.294
<v Speaker 5>he was basically saying slavery was good</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all these kinds of things that </v>

3900
02:38:52.791 --> 02:38:55.070
<v Speaker 5>British man got the eds and stuff.</v>

3901
02:38:55.070 --> 02:38:56.630
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're an idiot or whatever.</v>

3902
02:38:56.780 --> 02:38:57.613
<v Speaker 5>But I mean it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

3903
02:38:57.910 --> 02:39:01.370
<v Speaker 5>it was a ridiculous thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And yet normally,</v>

3904
02:39:01.371 --> 02:39:03.860
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you remember 60 minutes used to have the</v>

3905
02:39:03.861 --> 02:39:08.420
<v Speaker 5>KKK white supremacists guys in the old </v>
<v Speaker 5>days on like once a year they didn't,</v>

3906
02:39:08.421 --> 02:39:09.254
<v Speaker 5>if you'd like the grand dragon or </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever and they give them a lot of </v>

3907
02:39:11.331 --> 02:39:14.180
<v Speaker 5>airtime and Mike Wallace would question </v>
<v Speaker 5>and at the end of that,</v>

3908
02:39:14.181 --> 02:39:17.120
<v Speaker 5>you just always thought the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These people are idiots,</v>

3909
02:39:17.180 --> 02:39:17.780
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

3910
02:39:17.780 --> 02:39:21.560
<v Speaker 5>it was the give them enough rope and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll hang themselves type journalism.</v>

3911
02:39:21.760 --> 02:39:22.593
<v Speaker 5>I thought that that the journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like everybody was talking about that </v>

3912
02:39:24.930 --> 02:39:26.690
<v Speaker 5>the guy did the perfect interview with </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

3913
02:39:26.691 --> 02:39:29.930
<v Speaker 5>But I honestly think that's not the way </v>
<v Speaker 5>to do the perfect interview with them.</v>

3914
02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:32.690
<v Speaker 5>I think that guy standing up there </v>
<v Speaker 5>standing up facing each other,</v>

3915
02:39:32.691 --> 02:39:34.790
<v Speaker 5>I think they'd be far better off if they</v>
<v Speaker 5>sat down.</v>

3916
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.863
<v Speaker 5>And if they talked for a long period of </v>
<v Speaker 5>time and I think there's plenty more </v>

3917
02:39:38.511 --> 02:39:40.550
<v Speaker 5>rope in that car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could've hung them way better.</v>

3918
02:39:40.840 --> 02:39:41.673
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a book by a black gentleman who </v>

3919
02:39:42.761 --> 02:39:45.170
<v Speaker 5>is a musician,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a Boogie woogie piano player.</v>

3920
02:39:45.171 --> 02:39:46.760
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember his name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what is that?</v>

3921
02:39:46.850 --> 02:39:47.900
<v Speaker 5>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a book on,</v>

3922
02:39:48.290 --> 02:39:49.580
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was a style.</v>

3923
02:39:49.581 --> 02:39:51.440
<v Speaker 5>It was a book on the class.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3924
02:39:51.510 --> 02:39:53.270
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he was a guy,</v>

3925
02:39:53.271 --> 02:39:56.240
<v Speaker 5>a black man who I'm going from memory </v>
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>

3926
02:39:56.241 --> 02:39:58.400
<v Speaker 5>but he likes set up an interview with </v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the heads of the,</v>

3927
02:39:58.401 --> 02:39:59.234
<v Speaker 5>of the state clan or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It didn't tell the guy who was coming </v>

3928
02:40:01.701 --> 02:40:02.534
<v Speaker 5>that he was a black man and they have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they had this interview and if this </v>

3929
02:40:05.061 --> 02:40:07.820
<v Speaker 5>interesting thing he says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but long story short,</v>

3930
02:40:07.821 --> 02:40:08.654
<v Speaker 5>he started to make friends with these </v>
<v Speaker 5>KKK members and it wasn't like rank and </v>

3931
02:40:11.331 --> 02:40:11.990
<v Speaker 5>file people.</v>

3932
02:40:11.990 --> 02:40:13.920
<v Speaker 5>It was like the Grand Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

3933
02:40:14.130 --> 02:40:14.963
<v Speaker 5>That's the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How one man convinced 200 Klu Klux Klan </v>

3934
02:40:17.971 --> 02:40:21.320
<v Speaker 5>members to give up their roles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That motherfucker.</v>

3935
02:40:21.420 --> 02:40:24.240
<v Speaker 5>But long story short is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean these were the cal Davis.</v>

3936
02:40:24.300 --> 02:40:26.730
<v Speaker 5>They didn't have any black people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They knew,</v>

3937
02:40:26.850 --> 02:40:29.070
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had stereotypes and things.</v>

3938
02:40:29.190 --> 02:40:31.620
<v Speaker 5>So he said once you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you had said,</v>

3939
02:40:31.621 --> 02:40:34.650
<v Speaker 5>when you're face to face with somebody </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you have to interact with them on an</v>

3940
02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:36.870
<v Speaker 5>eye to eye level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3941
02:40:37.590 --> 02:40:41.160
<v Speaker 5>it's very intriguing what he did because</v>
<v Speaker 5>you say to yourself,</v>

3942
02:40:41.161 --> 02:40:41.994
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can never reach these archie bunker </v>

3943
02:40:43.021 --> 02:40:45.190
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people have and do and,</v>

3944
02:40:45.191 --> 02:40:46.024
<v Speaker 5>and I do want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen for all of the white </v>

3945
02:40:47.251 --> 02:40:49.440
<v Speaker 5>supremacists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>other than think I'm being unfair,</v>

3946
02:40:49.950 --> 02:40:54.050
<v Speaker 5>this racial tribal thing is all over the</v>
<v Speaker 5>place because there are,</v>

3947
02:40:54.060 --> 02:40:54.893
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you will meet black folks who are </v>

3948
02:40:56.041 --> 02:40:56.874
<v Speaker 5>racist too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now what I always say to people though </v>

3949
02:40:58.321 --> 02:40:59.154
<v Speaker 5>is the one thing you have to understand </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a white person that's different is </v>

3950
02:41:01.711 --> 02:41:02.970
<v Speaker 5>we're the dominant culture.</v>

3951
02:41:03.270 --> 02:41:05.160
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It does make things different.</v>

3952
02:41:05.161 --> 02:41:07.950
<v Speaker 5>If you are a minority in any country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a tendency,</v>

3953
02:41:08.100 --> 02:41:08.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go to the place,</v>

3954
02:41:08.930 --> 02:41:10.260
<v Speaker 5>they'll have neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3955
02:41:10.261 --> 02:41:11.790
<v Speaker 5>Remember the Italian neighborhoods in </v>
<v Speaker 5>our country,</v>

3956
02:41:11.791 --> 02:41:13.290
<v Speaker 5>that Jewish neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Irish neighborhoods,</v>

3957
02:41:13.291 --> 02:41:15.090
<v Speaker 5>why did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where they racist?</v>

3958
02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:15.960
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

3959
02:41:15.960 --> 02:41:18.420
<v Speaker 5>there's some strength in gathering with </v>
<v Speaker 5>your own kind,</v>

3960
02:41:18.421 --> 02:41:21.300
<v Speaker 5>reading your own newspapers and keeping </v>
<v Speaker 5>your culture along language.</v>

3961
02:41:21.330 --> 02:41:21.990
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

3962
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:24.360
<v Speaker 5>but it's also a self defense mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3963
02:41:24.540 --> 02:41:26.640
<v Speaker 5>So it's a very different thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well listen,</v>

3964
02:41:26.641 --> 02:41:29.970
<v Speaker 5>there are being racist to okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're the dominant culture.</v>

3965
02:41:29.971 --> 02:41:30.804
<v Speaker 5>And it means that there's something a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little different when we say what's </v>

3966
02:41:32.671 --> 02:41:33.900
<v Speaker 5>wrong with saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3967
02:41:33.901 --> 02:41:36.930
<v Speaker 5>white people should be proud of their </v>
<v Speaker 5>heritage to theoretically nothing.</v>

3968
02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:38.153
<v Speaker 5>But historically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are some issues and you need to </v>

3969
02:41:40.111 --> 02:41:40.944
<v Speaker 5>recognize that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not can we ever get to a time when we </v>

3970
02:41:42.331 --> 02:41:44.490
<v Speaker 5>can judge people by the content of their</v>
<v Speaker 5>character.</v>

3971
02:41:44.970 --> 02:41:46.110
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think if,</v>

3972
02:41:46.170 --> 02:41:48.510
<v Speaker 5>I think even if white people said we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to do that right now,</v>

3973
02:41:48.511 --> 02:41:50.040
<v Speaker 5>there'd be people of other colors going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3974
02:41:50.041 --> 02:41:51.510
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't want to give up.</v>

3975
02:41:51.810 --> 02:41:52.351
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3976
02:41:52.351 --> 02:41:54.630
<v Speaker 5>some extra admissions into universities </v>
<v Speaker 5>and we don't,</v>

3977
02:41:55.050 --> 02:41:58.770
<v Speaker 5>it becomes a very difficult thing to </v>
<v Speaker 5>give up this racial identity.</v>

3978
02:41:59.130 --> 02:42:00.660
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the 60s,</v>

3979
02:42:00.661 --> 02:42:03.030
<v Speaker 5>that was the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now people on all sides,</v>

3980
02:42:03.031 --> 02:42:03.960
<v Speaker 5>it'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are you talking about?</v>

3981
02:42:03.961 --> 02:42:04.591
<v Speaker 5>It very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3982
02:42:04.591 --> 02:42:07.590
<v Speaker 5>the cultural appropriation thing drives </v>
<v Speaker 5>me crazy.</v>

3983
02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:08.633
<v Speaker 5>Like if you're going to have dreadlocks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't because that's a black </v>

3984
02:42:10.921 --> 02:42:11.754
<v Speaker 5>hairstyle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are we want to say is don't black </v>

3985
02:42:13.101 --> 02:42:15.400
<v Speaker 5>people want to try different hairstyles </v>
<v Speaker 5>to the cre?</v>

3986
02:42:15.630 --> 02:42:16.463
<v Speaker 5>Create creativity is putting things </v>
<v Speaker 5>together that never went together </v>

3987
02:42:19.381 --> 02:42:20.214
<v Speaker 5>before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is that it's not even a </v>

3988
02:42:21.721 --> 02:42:23.940
<v Speaker 5>historically correct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know as well as I do,</v>

3989
02:42:23.941 --> 02:42:24.774
<v Speaker 5>the dreadlocks had been around for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>long fucking time with white people </v>

3990
02:42:27.110 --> 02:42:30.250
<v Speaker 5>about how it just polarizes us even more</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you read this once.</v>

3991
02:42:30.350 --> 02:42:33.960
<v Speaker 5>Not Real though is people looking for </v>
<v Speaker 5>things to be polarized.</v>

3992
02:42:34.230 --> 02:42:34.950
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

3993
02:42:34.950 --> 02:42:35.783
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do think and I love academia and I </v>

3994
02:42:37.180 --> 02:42:38.580
<v Speaker 5>could've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could've got swept up.</v>

3995
02:42:38.581 --> 02:42:41.010
<v Speaker 5>I enjoyed school at the college level so</v>
<v Speaker 5>much.</v>

3996
02:42:41.011 --> 02:42:42.390
<v Speaker 5>I could still be there today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3997
02:42:42.391 --> 02:42:44.480
<v Speaker 5>I've never gotten a job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would just be one of those guys.</v>

3998
02:42:44.550 --> 02:42:47.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm a graduate student at 51 helping the</v>
<v Speaker 5>professors,</v>

3999
02:42:47.490 --> 02:42:48.690
<v Speaker 5>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

4000
02:42:48.900 --> 02:42:49.733
<v Speaker 5>we all understand that those people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>incentivized to come up with new </v>

4001
02:42:52.321 --> 02:42:53.400
<v Speaker 5>theories,</v>
<v Speaker 5>new ideas,</v>

4002
02:42:53.401 --> 02:42:54.570
<v Speaker 5>groundbreaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cutting edge,</v>

4003
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:55.703
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is what they're rewarded for with </v>

4004
02:42:56.551 --> 02:42:58.230
<v Speaker 5>the carrots and sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I get it.</v>

4005
02:42:58.380 --> 02:43:01.080
<v Speaker 5>It's different when it spreads to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>general culture a little bit though,</v>

4006
02:43:01.081 --> 02:43:04.140
<v Speaker 5>because now we're not in the ivory tower</v>
<v Speaker 5>having a theoretical debate.</v>

4007
02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:06.960
<v Speaker 5>We're sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>should that person be shamed on twitter?</v>

4008
02:43:06.961 --> 02:43:08.940
<v Speaker 5>Cause he's a Asian person with </v>
<v Speaker 5>dreadlocks.</v>

4009
02:43:09.180 --> 02:43:10.140
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Folks,</v>

4010
02:43:10.170 --> 02:43:13.300
<v Speaker 5>if you don't see that might backfire on </v>
<v Speaker 5>you down the road.</v>

4011
02:43:13.301 --> 02:43:14.134
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've all got to cut each other some </v>

4012
02:43:15.071 --> 02:43:17.350
<v Speaker 5>slack on all sides.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we're gonna make this work.</v>

4013
02:43:17.380 --> 02:43:18.213
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's cultural appropriation is one of </v>

4014
02:43:19.661 --> 02:43:21.940
<v Speaker 5>the things that makes America so </v>
<v Speaker 5>fascinating.</v>

4015
02:43:22.150 --> 02:43:22.983
<v Speaker 5>Literally the melting pot of humans all </v>
<v Speaker 5>together exploring each other's food </v>

4016
02:43:27.391 --> 02:43:28.224
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all the various aspects of their </v>

4017
02:43:29.921 --> 02:43:30.754
<v Speaker 5>communities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The funny part is the cultural </v>

4018
02:43:31.721 --> 02:43:35.470
<v Speaker 5>appropriators out there are sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 5>the most sympathetic to that side.</v>

4019
02:43:35.550 --> 02:43:37.210
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're willing to get,</v>

4020
02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:37.750
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4021
02:43:37.750 --> 02:43:38.583
<v Speaker 5>Rastafarians hairstyle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're probably not an anti black </v>

4022
02:43:41.171 --> 02:43:42.004
<v Speaker 5>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4023
02:43:42.130 --> 02:43:44.590
<v Speaker 5>So when you tell them that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't be doing that,</v>

4024
02:43:45.190 --> 02:43:46.023
<v Speaker 5>aren't you going after the people most </v>
<v Speaker 5>likely to see your side of things and </v>

4025
02:43:49.511 --> 02:43:51.040
<v Speaker 5>help you and push angels as to what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying?</v>

4026
02:43:51.041 --> 02:43:54.070
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like we're eating our own on</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

4027
02:43:54.180 --> 02:43:56.620
<v Speaker 5>And on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is particularly about eating your own</v>

4028
02:43:56.621 --> 02:43:59.760
<v Speaker 5>because you can't be progressive enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's always going to be someone who's</v>

4029
02:43:59.770 --> 02:44:01.660
<v Speaker 5>more progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that just how we think,</v>

4030
02:44:01.740 --> 02:44:04.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I was a punk back in the old days,</v>

4031
02:44:04.031 --> 02:44:04.864
<v Speaker 5>and I remember saying that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're killing the movement because the </v>

4032
02:44:06.941 --> 02:44:09.550
<v Speaker 5>biggest thing was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was this idea of a poser,</v>

4033
02:44:09.790 --> 02:44:11.220
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the first thing everybody said,</v>

4034
02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:12.880
<v Speaker 5>we didn't welcome you into the group.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We said,</v>

4035
02:44:12.881 --> 02:44:14.110
<v Speaker 5>when did you start wearing these </v>
<v Speaker 5>clothes?</v>

4036
02:44:14.111 --> 02:44:15.640
<v Speaker 5>When did you get that hairstyle?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You pose her,</v>

4037
02:44:15.641 --> 02:44:17.860
<v Speaker 5>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the entire thing was exclusive,</v>

4038
02:44:18.010 --> 02:44:19.840
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you tried to build this movement,</v>

4039
02:44:19.900 --> 02:44:22.450
<v Speaker 5>you have to be an Oji degree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was ridiculous.</v>

4040
02:44:22.451 --> 02:44:23.284
<v Speaker 5>And then many years you have to be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>punk for before you're allowed to be </v>

4041
02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:26.980
<v Speaker 5>upon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You go in slowly.</v>

4042
02:44:27.330 --> 02:44:28.001
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember them,</v>

4043
02:44:28.001 --> 02:44:30.200
<v Speaker 5>they were going after like John lied and</v>
<v Speaker 5>Johnny Rotten.</v>

4044
02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:32.800
<v Speaker 5>You're a poser.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay then what are we doing here?</v>

4045
02:44:33.720 --> 02:44:34.553
<v Speaker 5>But I mean in the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the one thing you have to do is cut </v>

4046
02:44:36.731 --> 02:44:37.564
<v Speaker 5>people some slack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the one thing we human beings seem </v>

4047
02:44:39.311 --> 02:44:41.210
<v Speaker 5>to have such a problem with is cutting </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

4048
02:44:41.211 --> 02:44:42.490
<v Speaker 5>Slack and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems to be,</v>

4049
02:44:42.970 --> 02:44:43.803
<v Speaker 5>if you say the social media seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>worse because you'll cut somebody slap </v>

4050
02:44:46.370 --> 02:44:49.000
<v Speaker 5>face to face more easily than you will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4051
02:44:49.001 --> 02:44:51.370
<v Speaker 5>when you can just throw 140 characters </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you go to bed.</v>

4052
02:44:51.371 --> 02:44:53.920
<v Speaker 5>But that comedian on the other side of </v>
<v Speaker 5>your hundred and 40 characters,</v>

4053
02:44:54.130 --> 02:44:55.180
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me just,</v>

4054
02:44:55.360 --> 02:44:56.193
<v Speaker 5>you've seen this and I've seen this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you've never been on the </v>

4055
02:44:57.341 --> 02:45:01.370
<v Speaker 5>receiving end of these things where Pete</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I've been very lucky and people have</v>

4056
02:45:01.371 --> 02:45:03.540
<v Speaker 5>been very nice and kind to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but even I,</v>

4057
02:45:03.550 --> 02:45:04.660
<v Speaker 5>when you read these things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go,</v>

4058
02:45:04.661 --> 02:45:06.160
<v Speaker 5>who is this person?</v>

4059
02:45:06.530 --> 02:45:08.710
<v Speaker 5>Why do they think that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did they,</v>

4060
02:45:08.740 --> 02:45:10.870
<v Speaker 5>did their lives get better?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause they texted me this.</v>

4061
02:45:10.871 --> 02:45:11.704
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you see what I'm saying?</v>

4062
02:45:11.920 --> 02:45:14.230
<v Speaker 5>I don't get the motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't even know it.</v>

4063
02:45:14.260 --> 02:45:16.540
<v Speaker 5>They don't even know thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just acting.</v>

4064
02:45:16.541 --> 02:45:19.240
<v Speaker 5>It's a human instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They hurt and they want to hurt others.</v>

4065
02:45:19.500 --> 02:45:21.460
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what you told me years ago.</v>

4066
02:45:21.790 --> 02:45:22.890
<v Speaker 5>You told me that that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

4067
02:45:22.960 --> 02:45:25.810
<v Speaker 5>you've helped me a lot when I look at </v>
<v Speaker 5>those things and I think he chose,</v>

4068
02:45:25.811 --> 02:45:28.810
<v Speaker 5>right Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is people that are angry with their</v>

4069
02:45:28.811 --> 02:45:30.700
<v Speaker 5>situation and their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what did,</v>

4070
02:45:30.820 --> 02:45:31.653
<v Speaker 5>what did they say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the crabs in a pot and one </v>

4071
02:45:33.350 --> 02:45:36.040
<v Speaker 5>crab crabs in a bucket and you pull the </v>
<v Speaker 5>crab down.</v>

4072
02:45:36.310 --> 02:45:38.380
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's too bad because you know what?</v>

4073
02:45:38.381 --> 02:45:41.160
<v Speaker 5>A lot of those people are the very </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who could be doing much better if</v>

4074
02:45:41.161 --> 02:45:41.994
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we could figure out a way to help </v>

4075
02:45:42.671 --> 02:45:47.671
<v Speaker 5>empower them to unleash their been </v>
<v Speaker 5>haters that aren't haters anymore.</v>

4076
02:45:48.190 --> 02:45:50.310
<v Speaker 5>And unfortunately a lot of people have </v>
<v Speaker 5>already blocked them.</v>

4077
02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:51.233
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

4078
02:45:51.310 --> 02:45:52.143
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just dissatisfied people that are so </v>

4079
02:45:53.081 --> 02:45:54.820
<v Speaker 5>upset with the way things are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I really,</v>

4080
02:45:55.480 --> 02:45:56.313
<v Speaker 5>I would love to see more effort made in </v>
<v Speaker 5>that regard because I think the </v>

4081
02:45:58.481 --> 02:46:02.080
<v Speaker 5>subsidiary down the road domino effects </v>
<v Speaker 5>would help us all so much.</v>

4082
02:46:02.081 --> 02:46:02.914
<v Speaker 5>But listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're a country that can't even get the </v>

4083
02:46:04.331 --> 02:46:05.164
<v Speaker 5>most basic things passed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How are we going to get something like </v>

4084
02:46:06.761 --> 02:46:09.010
<v Speaker 5>that done?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think change is happening.</v>

4085
02:46:09.050 --> 02:46:10.460
<v Speaker 5>I think it's happening incredibly</v>

4086
02:46:10.460 --> 02:46:12.800
<v Speaker 1>rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we're stuck in the mix of it</v>

4087
02:46:12.801 --> 02:46:13.634
<v Speaker 1>and we don't realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like when you come over </v>

4088
02:46:15.231 --> 02:46:16.064
<v Speaker 1>someone's house and you haven't been </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there house in like five years and </v>

4089
02:46:18.321 --> 02:46:19.700
<v Speaker 1>all of sudden their kid is 10 you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4090
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 10 now.</v>

4091
02:46:21.740 --> 02:46:26.740
<v Speaker 1>To them it just happened gradually and </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly and they barely have noticed.</v>

4092
02:46:27.411 --> 02:46:28.244
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to you when you take five years off </v>

4093
02:46:29.901 --> 02:46:30.980
<v Speaker 1>and then you see that kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

4094
02:46:30.981 --> 02:46:33.210
<v Speaker 1>holy sugar in the hot water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4095
02:46:33.650 --> 02:46:36.230
<v Speaker 1>It's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is happening,</v>

4096
02:46:36.530 --> 02:46:37.363
<v Speaker 1>but it's just how I see this is where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't again in the maelstrom trying to </v>

4097
02:46:39.591 --> 02:46:42.320
<v Speaker 1>analysts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is it positive or negative?</v>

4098
02:46:42.350 --> 02:46:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Now you're an author.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

4099
02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:44.421
<v Speaker 1>you're an optimist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

4100
02:46:44.421 --> 02:46:45.254
<v Speaker 1>We'd had this conversation before and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little bit more cynical and </v>

4101
02:46:47.090 --> 02:46:48.440
<v Speaker 1>misanthropic may be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4102
02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:50.870
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worry about,</v>

4103
02:46:50.900 --> 02:46:52.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring it out.</v>

4104
02:46:52.190 --> 02:46:53.023
<v Speaker 1>So if you say that human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>individually and as groups learn by </v>

4105
02:46:55.551 --> 02:46:56.700
<v Speaker 1>mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4106
02:46:56.720 --> 02:46:59.540
<v Speaker 1>So you have to have a Holocaust type </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake to,</v>

4107
02:46:59.580 --> 02:47:01.280
<v Speaker 1>to come out of this before we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4108
02:47:01.281 --> 02:47:02.114
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's where we screwed up on that </v>

4109
02:47:02.841 --> 02:47:04.400
<v Speaker 1>social media thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4110
02:47:04.401 --> 02:47:06.680
<v Speaker 1>I wonder whether we're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed.</v>

4111
02:47:06.681 --> 02:47:07.514
<v Speaker 1>I would not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you would turn the </v>

4112
02:47:08.121 --> 02:47:09.680
<v Speaker 1>genie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put the genie back in the bottle.</v>

4113
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:14.300
<v Speaker 1>But I mean at what point do terrorists </v>
<v Speaker 1>or dangerous people are,</v>

4114
02:47:14.301 --> 02:47:15.134
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the,</v>

4115
02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:16.273
<v Speaker 1>to go back to that weather underground </v>
<v Speaker 1>new left bombing thing that I said that </v>

4116
02:47:18.501 --> 02:47:20.150
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know the south,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd like me,</v>

4117
02:47:20.220 --> 02:47:21.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waterboarding Abbie Hoffman.</v>

4118
02:47:22.310 --> 02:47:24.770
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you'd had a bunch of people back then</v>

4119
02:47:25.010 --> 02:47:27.170
<v Speaker 1>with twitter saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I support the,</v>

4120
02:47:27.290 --> 02:47:28.880
<v Speaker 1>the Abby Hoffman's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I supported that.</v>

4121
02:47:29.330 --> 02:47:31.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At what point would the government first</v>

4122
02:47:31.551 --> 02:47:32.990
<v Speaker 1>of all get you on a watch list then?</v>

4123
02:47:32.990 --> 02:47:33.823
<v Speaker 1>Or Now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at what point would somebody have </v>

4124
02:47:34.971 --> 02:47:36.200
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen for our own good,</v>

4125
02:47:36.201 --> 02:47:37.034
<v Speaker 1>we can't have average Americans because </v>
<v Speaker 1>look how many terrorists are using this </v>

4126
02:47:39.981 --> 02:47:40.814
<v Speaker 1>tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4127
02:47:41.180 --> 02:47:42.013
<v Speaker 1>we'll see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you'd mentioned nine 11 and how you </v>

4128
02:47:44.071 --> 02:47:46.580
<v Speaker 1>know so much of that they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a feeling of community and all</v>

4129
02:47:46.581 --> 02:47:48.320
<v Speaker 1>that other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was other things too.</v>

4130
02:47:48.530 --> 02:47:50.300
<v Speaker 1>There were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was the government literally,</v>

4131
02:47:50.301 --> 02:47:51.134
<v Speaker 1>and I remember Peter Defazio's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the congressmen a up in Oregon who said </v>

4132
02:47:53.421 --> 02:47:54.410
<v Speaker 1>this to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

4133
02:47:54.411 --> 02:47:55.244
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said there were bills that had been </v>

4134
02:47:56.991 --> 02:47:57.824
<v Speaker 1>written and put on a shelf because there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was no way to pass them for the longest </v>

4135
02:48:01.251 --> 02:48:02.330
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

4136
02:48:02.331 --> 02:48:05.660
<v Speaker 1>when nine 11 happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pulled all those bills down,</v>

4137
02:48:05.930 --> 02:48:08.250
<v Speaker 1>cobbled them into one thing and send it </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

4138
02:48:08.510 --> 02:48:10.670
<v Speaker 1>And then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the real scandal.</v>

4139
02:48:10.671 --> 02:48:11.690
<v Speaker 1>And most people don't know this.</v>

4140
02:48:11.690 --> 02:48:12.523
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know how many parts that bill </v>

4141
02:48:13.431 --> 02:48:16.460
<v Speaker 1>were blank that we signed to be filled </v>
<v Speaker 1>in later?</v>

4142
02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:17.930
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not unusual.</v>

4143
02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:18.793
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we get a lot of bills that they </v>

4144
02:48:19.641 --> 02:48:22.310
<v Speaker 1>haven't figured out all the details </v>
<v Speaker 1>because most bills aren't as important.</v>

4145
02:48:22.311 --> 02:48:23.144
<v Speaker 1>Is that when he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we signed off to a bunch of things with </v>

4146
02:48:24.651 --> 02:48:27.500
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of blank categories to be filled</v>
<v Speaker 1>in later.</v>

4147
02:48:28.070 --> 02:48:28.903
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets us back to leadership right </v>

4148
02:48:30.141 --> 02:48:31.070
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with the country?</v>

4149
02:48:31.071 --> 02:48:33.650
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of people signing a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that have nothing in it yet.</v>

4150
02:48:34.640 --> 02:48:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Like I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about it,</v>

4151
02:48:36.631 --> 02:48:39.320
<v Speaker 1>like are you optimistic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you pessimistic?</v>

4152
02:48:39.321 --> 02:48:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Is it negative or is it positive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's both.</v>

4153
02:48:41.540 --> 02:48:45.350
<v Speaker 1>And I think the negative and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive are both necessary.</v>

4154
02:48:45.530 --> 02:48:46.363
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we're gonna live in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>utopian world where everybody's just </v>

4155
02:48:48.351 --> 02:48:49.184
<v Speaker 1>friendly to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people are going to make </v>

4156
02:48:50.241 --> 02:48:51.920
<v Speaker 1>mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be shitty.</v>

4157
02:48:52.100 --> 02:48:52.933
<v Speaker 1>They're going to realize that their </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty and the understanding of that </v>

4158
02:48:55.791 --> 02:48:56.624
<v Speaker 1>behavior and the ramifications of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior is becoming more and more </v>

4159
02:48:59.121 --> 02:48:59.954
<v Speaker 1>apparent every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we're seeing that and I </v>

4160
02:49:02.241 --> 02:49:03.074
<v Speaker 1>think we're caught up in this storm and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a fucking hurricane going on </v>

4161
02:49:06.261 --> 02:49:08.250
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This cows by and bathtubs</v>

4162
02:49:08.310 --> 02:49:11.760
<v Speaker 4>in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All this stuff is happening right now.</v>

4163
02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:13.910
<v Speaker 5>The hope is though that we could get to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the good cause.</v>

4164
02:49:13.940 --> 02:49:15.710
<v Speaker 5>I might agree with you at the long term,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4165
02:49:15.711 --> 02:49:17.630
<v Speaker 5>If you're saying optimistic real long </v>
<v Speaker 5>term,</v>

4166
02:49:18.020 --> 02:49:18.853
<v Speaker 5>but how many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you said in 1900 I'm </v>

4167
02:49:20.571 --> 02:49:24.140
<v Speaker 5>optimistic long term that by the year </v>
<v Speaker 5>2000 things will be better.</v>

4168
02:49:24.290 --> 02:49:25.123
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you have two world wars to go </v>

4169
02:49:26.091 --> 02:49:28.610
<v Speaker 5>through in the interim and the nude near</v>
<v Speaker 5>misses on nuclear wars.</v>

4170
02:49:28.820 --> 02:49:32.540
<v Speaker 5>So I can agree with you that long term </v>
<v Speaker 5>we may have a positive outcome here.</v>

4171
02:49:32.541 --> 02:49:33.374
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what our immediate short </v>
<v Speaker 5>term with you and I have 2030 40 you </v>

4172
02:49:36.471 --> 02:49:38.270
<v Speaker 5>probably have a hundred years left on </v>
<v Speaker 5>your lifespan,</v>

4173
02:49:38.450 --> 02:49:41.250
<v Speaker 5>but some of us are not in great shape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm hunt.</v>

4174
02:49:41.420 --> 02:49:42.253
<v Speaker 5>She said the next 2025 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you going to see good or bad from </v>

4175
02:49:45.201 --> 02:49:46.034
<v Speaker 5>this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We may have to go through some learning </v>

4176
02:49:47.301 --> 02:49:50.210
<v Speaker 5>experiences and those tend to not be so </v>
<v Speaker 5>fun to live through.</v>

4177
02:49:50.370 --> 02:49:51.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's that.</v>

4178
02:49:51.301 --> 02:49:54.360
<v Speaker 4>But also there's like how bout just </v>
<v Speaker 4>disengaged from that?</v>

4179
02:49:54.361 --> 02:49:55.950
<v Speaker 4>Every now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you.</v>

4180
02:49:55.980 --> 02:49:56.813
<v Speaker 4>Don't have your life completely </v>
<v Speaker 4>dependent upon the success and failures </v>

4181
02:49:59.611 --> 02:50:01.710
<v Speaker 4>of other people's emotions and ideas </v>
<v Speaker 4>like it.</v>

4182
02:50:01.711 --> 02:50:06.270
<v Speaker 4>Just go off on your own more often.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Spend more time by yourself,</v>

4183
02:50:06.271 --> 02:50:07.104
<v Speaker 4>more time pursuing your own activity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Spend more time in nature with your </v>

4184
02:50:09.571 --> 02:50:10.980
<v Speaker 4>phone off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Spend more time,</v>

4185
02:50:11.470 --> 02:50:13.590
<v Speaker 4>really good idea to cause giant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

4186
02:50:13.810 --> 02:50:15.120
<v Speaker 5>and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because folks,</v>

4187
02:50:15.121 --> 02:50:18.540
<v Speaker 5>that's what connects you to all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other human beings who ever lived before</v>

4188
02:50:18.541 --> 02:50:18.921
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That the,</v>

4189
02:50:18.921 --> 02:50:19.754
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing that makes our time period </v>

4190
02:50:20.521 --> 02:50:21.354
<v Speaker 5>different here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this vast human experiment is we've </v>

4191
02:50:23.221 --> 02:50:25.140
<v Speaker 5>never had a generation growing up with </v>
<v Speaker 5>mobile phones,</v>

4192
02:50:25.141 --> 02:50:26.700
<v Speaker 5>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does that mean?</v>

4193
02:50:26.701 --> 02:50:27.534
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one thing it does is it takes you away </v>

4194
02:50:28.651 --> 02:50:29.484
<v Speaker 5>from the part that your aunts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean looking up at a night sky with </v>

4195
02:50:32.971 --> 02:50:33.804
<v Speaker 5>nothing to do for hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just sitting there contemplating the </v>

4196
02:50:36.211 --> 02:50:38.490
<v Speaker 5>silence or the rustling of the trees or </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

4197
02:50:39.030 --> 02:50:40.890
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you get anything out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that or not,</v>

4198
02:50:40.920 --> 02:50:41.753
<v Speaker 5>but that's something that human beings </v>
<v Speaker 5>have done since caveman times that </v>

4199
02:50:44.851 --> 02:50:47.280
<v Speaker 5>you're sharing an experience that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>innately human.</v>

4200
02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:51.150
<v Speaker 5>If that becomes less and less common </v>
<v Speaker 5>because we're detached from that.</v>

4201
02:50:51.860 --> 02:50:52.920
<v Speaker 4>Does that mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we'd,</v>

4202
02:50:52.930 --> 02:50:55.070
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we talked about an experiment earlier,</v>

4203
02:50:55.071 --> 02:50:55.904
<v Speaker 4>that we're an experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it mean when people detach </v>

4204
02:50:57.891 --> 02:50:58.724
<v Speaker 4>from that part of the human existence to</v>
<v Speaker 4>spend more time in this new part of </v>

4205
02:51:02.121 --> 02:51:03.470
<v Speaker 4>human existence?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4206
02:51:03.530 --> 02:51:06.200
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that part of being a person,</v>

4207
02:51:06.201 --> 02:51:09.200
<v Speaker 4>like being in nature is an,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's part of us.</v>

4208
02:51:09.470 --> 02:51:10.303
<v Speaker 4>It's part of how we developed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's attached to our human reward </v>

4209
02:51:13.551 --> 02:51:14.384
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something that's deeply </v>

4210
02:51:15.081 --> 02:51:18.590
<v Speaker 4>satisfying about lying down in a field </v>
<v Speaker 4>and looking up at the stars.</v>

4211
02:51:18.591 --> 02:51:22.130
<v Speaker 4>And there's a reason for all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the more we detach from that,</v>

4212
02:51:22.131 --> 02:51:24.890
<v Speaker 4>the more you're going to get these </v>
<v Speaker 4>disenfranchised,</v>

4213
02:51:24.891 --> 02:51:25.724
<v Speaker 4>very unhappy people that feel like </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're a prisoner or a slave to some </v>

4214
02:51:28.941 --> 02:51:30.740
<v Speaker 4>system that doesn't give a fuck about </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

4215
02:51:30.741 --> 02:51:32.600
<v Speaker 4>Cause it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really doesn't.</v>

4216
02:51:32.810 --> 02:51:35.570
<v Speaker 4>What the people that give a fuck about </v>
<v Speaker 4>you or your community,</v>

4217
02:51:35.690 --> 02:51:37.100
<v Speaker 4>they're your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

4218
02:51:37.101 --> 02:51:37.670
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4219
02:51:37.670 --> 02:51:38.503
<v Speaker 4>the community of likeminded humans that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've bonded with that share your </v>

4220
02:51:43.221 --> 02:51:48.221
<v Speaker 4>occupation or share your interests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's how people develop satisfying</v>

4221
02:51:48.981 --> 02:51:50.870
<v Speaker 4>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And satisfying lives.</v>

4222
02:51:51.050 --> 02:51:56.050
<v Speaker 4>The more you put yourself connected to </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that doesn't even value you.</v>

4223
02:51:56.270 --> 02:52:01.270
<v Speaker 4>Some huge monolithic creation that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no one even running it.</v>

4224
02:52:02.270 --> 02:52:06.640
<v Speaker 4>It's not like some architect has figured</v>
<v Speaker 4>out a great to design civilization</v>

4225
02:52:06.790 --> 02:52:08.880
<v Speaker 1>to satisfy all the humans that are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it.</v>

4226
02:52:08.890 --> 02:52:09.723
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're feeding this machine and some </v>

4227
02:52:11.741 --> 02:52:15.610
<v Speaker 1>sort of a weird way that nobody really </v>
<v Speaker 1>understands the ramifications of because</v>

4228
02:52:15.760 --> 02:52:19.450
<v Speaker 1>we haven't done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There hasn't been this global connection</v>

4229
02:52:19.451 --> 02:52:23.080
<v Speaker 1>of cell phones for thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know how to manage it.</v>

4230
02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:25.360
<v Speaker 1>We know how to manage your time and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

4231
02:52:25.510 --> 02:52:26.200
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

4232
02:52:26.200 --> 02:52:28.690
<v Speaker 1>your emotions on social media now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all,</v>

4233
02:52:28.930 --> 02:52:29.763
<v Speaker 1>this is all experimental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all happening in the moment and </v>

4234
02:52:32.651 --> 02:52:33.484
<v Speaker 1>we're all a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's it going to be like three </v>

4235
02:52:34.691 --> 02:52:36.970
<v Speaker 1>generations from now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>

4236
02:52:37.060 --> 02:52:37.893
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared that we're eliminating as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much as possible boredom from our lives </v>

4237
02:52:41.670 --> 02:52:43.630
<v Speaker 1>because I think the boredom is </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

4238
02:52:43.990 --> 02:52:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid,</v>

4239
02:52:44.951 --> 02:52:47.230
<v Speaker 1>we talked about being weird when I was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

4240
02:52:47.270 --> 02:52:49.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a lot of free time on my hands.</v>

4241
02:52:49.180 --> 02:52:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Had to figure out ways to entertain </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

4242
02:52:52.210 --> 02:52:54.040
<v Speaker 1>no video games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

4243
02:52:54.070 --> 02:52:56.800
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you end up doing things that like,</v>

4244
02:52:56.860 --> 02:52:57.551
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4245
02:52:57.551 --> 02:52:58.770
<v Speaker 1>you had talked about your whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4246
02:52:58.990 --> 02:53:01.690
<v Speaker 1>we found this niche for me and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>history show thing cause it's what I was</v>

4247
02:53:01.691 --> 02:53:03.160
<v Speaker 1>born to do or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4248
02:53:03.161 --> 02:53:03.994
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it goes back to me trying to figure </v>

4249
02:53:05.711 --> 02:53:06.191
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4250
02:53:06.191 --> 02:53:08.260
<v Speaker 1>I've played with these toy plastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers,</v>

4251
02:53:08.430 --> 02:53:09.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single day,</v>

4252
02:53:09.461 --> 02:53:10.294
<v Speaker 1>how do I make something new so that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be entertained with these same toy </v>

4253
02:53:12.671 --> 02:53:13.504
<v Speaker 1>soldier?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4254
02:53:13.950 --> 02:53:15.920
<v Speaker 1>And I think that all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4255
02:53:15.950 --> 02:53:18.790
<v Speaker 1>if we think about building blocks in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain,</v>

4256
02:53:18.820 --> 02:53:21.580
<v Speaker 1>the need to overcome boredom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

4257
02:53:21.760 --> 02:53:23.650
<v Speaker 1>is a prime mover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're young,</v>

4258
02:53:23.651 --> 02:53:25.690
<v Speaker 1>you're not motivated by money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not motivate.</v>

4259
02:53:25.750 --> 02:53:26.410
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4260
02:53:26.410 --> 02:53:29.080
<v Speaker 1>you're not even motivated by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the opposite sex.</v>

4261
02:53:29.081 --> 02:53:29.861
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a kid,</v>

4262
02:53:29.861 --> 02:53:30.694
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do to fill this </v>

4263
02:53:32.290 --> 02:53:32.290
<v Speaker 1>afternoon?</v>

4264
02:53:32.290 --> 02:53:33.550
<v Speaker 1>And you find ways to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4265
02:53:33.551 --> 02:53:37.810
<v Speaker 1>I remember tearing up my mom's garden </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to create a giant river system,</v>

4266
02:53:37.811 --> 02:53:38.860
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4267
02:53:39.800 --> 02:53:41.560
<v Speaker 1>But would you do that today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was even bothered,</v>

4268
02:53:41.561 --> 02:53:43.120
<v Speaker 1>took hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would,</v>

4269
02:53:43.150 --> 02:53:44.680
<v Speaker 1>but maybe a kid would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's,</v>

4270
02:53:44.681 --> 02:53:46.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's an app where you can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

4271
02:53:46.240 --> 02:53:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Do the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the same thing on my point is,</v>

4272
02:53:48.121 --> 02:53:48.954
<v Speaker 1>is that there's these sorts of prime </v>
<v Speaker 1>movers end up creating their needs that </v>

4273
02:53:52.961 --> 02:53:55.930
<v Speaker 1>create the need for solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get rid of that need,</v>

4274
02:53:56.110 --> 02:53:57.850
<v Speaker 1>do you need the solution anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And did,</v>

4275
02:53:57.851 --> 02:53:58.684
<v Speaker 1>did the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did the need for the solution create a </v>

4276
02:54:00.201 --> 02:54:01.034
<v Speaker 1>different Joe Rogan Dan Carlin or Joe </v>
<v Speaker 1>blow out on the street then would have </v>

4277
02:54:04.091 --> 02:54:06.730

<v Speaker 1>creating a more formidable human being,</v>

4278
02:54:06.940 --> 02:54:11.800
<v Speaker 1>having to overcome my childhood boredom </v>
<v Speaker 1>created a more formidable human being.</v>

4279
02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.920
<v Speaker 1>It did Dan Carlin,</v>
