19
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:44.310
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do stand up and I know it's a problem.</v>

20
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

21
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You love it.</v>

23
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.580

<v Speaker 1>you think about it a lot.</v>

24
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:51.620
<v Speaker 1>When you think about a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and little.</v>

25
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Let me check twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's also such a safety kind of </v>

26
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>just move that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

27
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we talked about this before.</v>

28
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just like fucking you put up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put your phone down for a day.</v>

29
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 1>what I've been doing lately that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been more productive when I know I can't</v>

31
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>give in to go over my notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

32
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 1>What I find man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find that like what I'm,</v>

33
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.800
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing is just distracting my I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about this on my podcast,</v>

34
00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to,</v>

35
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.850
<v Speaker 1>I used to think I used to just spend </v>
<v Speaker 1>time thinking like just spend time in my</v>

36
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:26.430
<v Speaker 1>house or apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just thinking about things.</v>

37
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't do that as much anymore because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think what's,</v>

38
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.220
<v Speaker 1>what did this fucking guy stay on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter?</v>

39
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.470
<v Speaker 1>It robs you of your creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

40
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's hard to be prolific when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just looking at your phone and it</v>

41
00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 1>does something to you when you just get </v>
<v Speaker 1>mindless tweets and you're still looking</v>

42
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:44.570
<v Speaker 1>at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

43
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.140
<v Speaker 1>it's like a numbing agent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

44
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:47.380
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

45
00:01:47.381 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what are you going to see?</v>

46
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Somebody likes your special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

47
00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

48
00:01:50.731 --> 00:01:55.731
<v Speaker 1>I do follow a lot of cool people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will post up some cool shit and some </v>

49
00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>articles and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people send me those,</v>

50
00:01:57.271 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 1>I try to retreat the ones that I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>are interesting.</v>

51
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.960
<v Speaker 1>So there's a benefit to it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But sure.</v>

52
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.280
<v Speaker 1>The real you get lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like checking how people like things </v>

53
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.260
<v Speaker 1>that show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that a good channel Sharon?</v>

54
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>My tire now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But you're right.</v>

56
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Like your time is better spent trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do more stuff,</v>

57
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.980
<v Speaker 1>do more comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a thief of your time really is </v>

58
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.980
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>

59
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.690
<v Speaker 1>is it really is designed for them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

60
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.350
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

61
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

62
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to do.</v>

63
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.050
<v Speaker 1>I ever see a person who's got epilepsy </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they can't watch one of those </v>

64
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.261
<v Speaker 1>animated Gif files.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a buddy of mine and I thought he </v>

65
00:02:39.261 --> 00:02:40.530
<v Speaker 1>was joking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know was being honest.</v>

66
00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>I had this message board and on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>website,</v>

67
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:48.291
<v Speaker 1>a message board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone made me like this really flashy </v>

68
00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:49.200
<v Speaker 1>image for the face where it's like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns on and off.</v>

69
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:54.201
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulsates if an my friend's wife has </v>

70
00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:54.600
<v Speaker 1>epilepsy and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

71
00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:57.480
<v Speaker 1>you got to take that down because of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife looks at it.</v>

72
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.640
<v Speaker 1>She'll have a seizure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

75
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.770
<v Speaker 2>like an animated Gif or Jif or Gif or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jif.</v>

76
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:10.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a big debate,</v>

77
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.080
<v Speaker 2>jeff slash Gif,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he can't.</v>

78
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 2>She can't even look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looks at it.</v>

79
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:17.100
<v Speaker 2>She will go into an epileptic seizure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

80
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 2>how do you police that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just don't look online ever.</v>

81
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 2>I guess they have to be real careful of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like what she sees.</v>

82
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 2>I guess like maybe if she turns away </v>
<v Speaker 2>real quick,</v>

83
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.380
<v Speaker 2>maybe she'd be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

84
00:03:27.381 --> 00:03:32.381
<v Speaker 2>I really don't know how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she has to wear special glasses </v>

85
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 2>when she looks at a online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know what's like.</v>

86
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.610
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine you've got some sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a weird misfire were just lights will</v>

87
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 2>make your body shut off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like someone hacked your brain.</v>

88
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 2>He could shut it off with some light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some flashing shit.</v>

89
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 2>That's like some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

90
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 2>that's like the superheroes weakness </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're like,</v>

91
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get with flashing lights,</v>

92
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 2>crypto new.</v>

93
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because Kryptonite doesn't even work on </v>

94
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.030
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

95
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.180
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm such a pussy.</v>

96
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.070
<v Speaker 2>I ain't no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in one of the superman movies,</v>

97
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 2>they didn't even have Kryptonite in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>one in the one superman movie was.</v>

98
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 2>But before the one before it superman or</v>
<v Speaker 2>Batman,</v>

99
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 2>I saw it and the bad guy didn't even use</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kryptonite.</v>

100
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:12.660
<v Speaker 2>So you couldn't destroy Superman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is this what the fuck is this movie?</v>

101
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 2>Even a movie because people are stupider</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

102
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:17.740
<v Speaker 2>They had to tone it down to like back in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Christopher Reeve days,</v>

103
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 2>you need to have like an antagonist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>protagonist.</v>

104
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:21.670
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have a lot of people today </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

105
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want super cute.</v>

106
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.830
<v Speaker 2>Because then there'll be some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>group that finds it offensive.</v>

107
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true too,</v>

108
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

109
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.400
<v Speaker 2>So these flashing things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I found out about it that flashing </v>

110
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.451
<v Speaker 2>animated files and then I found out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a television show in Japan </v>

111
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 2>that they had to take off the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

112
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 2>because all these people were watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and having seizures in Japan.</v>

113
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.130
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like every show in Japan is </v>

114
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.531
<v Speaker 2>flashing lights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like they have a show called </v>

115
00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:52.531
<v Speaker 2>flashing lights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have the flush with athlete network</v>

116
00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:53.810
<v Speaker 2>and they're just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

117
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.950
<v Speaker 2>isn't it every every clip I've ever seen</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Japan is like pink and blue and like </v>

118
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.400
<v Speaker 2>what if all they saw us as fear factor.</v>

119
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.130
<v Speaker 2>That's probably what they would choose </v>
<v Speaker 2>to watch,</v>

120
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.920
<v Speaker 2>but maybe they have some cool shit over </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

121
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 2>but we're only seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

122
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:10.050
<v Speaker 2>like when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many donkey Dick Kenya smiles.</v>

123
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.560
<v Speaker 2>True what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

124
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.830
<v Speaker 2>And poking a band pokemon episode that </v>
<v Speaker 2>gave children's seizures.</v>

125
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean I thought the whole point was of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pokemon was to give people seizures.</v>

126
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.840
<v Speaker 2>My God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>700 children were on their way to the </v>

127
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.050
<v Speaker 2>hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After watching that,</v>

128
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.170
<v Speaker 2>30 minutes after the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>700 children went to the hospital for </v>

129
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 2>seizures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it's really saying?</v>

130
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.280
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine a room of 700 people?</v>

131
00:05:35.281 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're killing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

132
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:37.850
<v Speaker 2>If you have a stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

133
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.050
<v Speaker 2>If you had a stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always think of it in terms of that </v>

134
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.301
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always think of how many people in </v>

135
00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:47.221
<v Speaker 2>terms of like how big of a room with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Phil as a standup to say I got </v>

136
00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:48.520
<v Speaker 2>already should fear to feel really good </v>
<v Speaker 2>about his twitter following back when he</v>

137
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:49.330
<v Speaker 2>only had 2000.</v>

138
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.020
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

139
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.960
<v Speaker 2>you have a fucking sold out theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

140
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

141
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 2>you got to sold out theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are paying attention to you.</v>

142
00:05:56.711 --> 00:05:57.470
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

143
00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 2>well what am I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

144
00:05:59.001 --> 00:05:59.400
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>

145
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at Britney spears.</v>

146
00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 2>She can't do that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck your head up.</v>

147
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.550
<v Speaker 2>She has $100 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

148
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

149
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 2>there's something about that is crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

150
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 2>700 people having a seizure in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

151
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if you are on stage and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole audience just seizures.</v>

152
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 2>I would just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

153
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm next level band from New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>seizure and people,</v>

154
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.980
<v Speaker 2>we should have taped this one too to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Leanne's this pit.</v>

155
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.520
<v Speaker 2>He strips down to his underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's underwear,</v>

156
00:06:26.521 --> 00:06:29.170
<v Speaker 2>a bright silver and started doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>cartwheels and people seizure.</v>

157
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.710
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anything like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

158
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 2>that'd be a hell of a claim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

159
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 2>you could probably pull something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that off.</v>

160
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if you could make someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>seizure with comedy.</v>

161
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.290
<v Speaker 2>You would have to imagine if you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>like some sort of back screen on your </v>

162
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 2>punchline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your punchline,</v>

163
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.210
<v Speaker 2>you rip your track suit off like one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those velcro things.</v>

164
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.090
<v Speaker 2>Those basketball players have terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they pull their tear away.</v>

165
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:55.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And underneath it you have strobing </v>

166
00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:55.091
<v Speaker 2>lights on the punchline.</v>

167
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.780
<v Speaker 2>The punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

168
00:06:56.781 --> 00:06:57.550
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is.</v>

169
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.310
<v Speaker 2>And just everyone with epilepsy just </v>
<v Speaker 2>falls to the ground.</v>

170
00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:09.311
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if it would be silent though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to hear the noise whenever we </v>

171
00:07:09.311 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 2>would certainly hear thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that a group thought that </v>

172
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.990
<v Speaker 2>crosses across the city here the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

173
00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:18.470
<v Speaker 2>That would be 700 people falling down </v>
<v Speaker 2>their heads.</v>

174
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely don't want to flesh that out,</v>

175
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.560
<v Speaker 2>but I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

176
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Speaker 2>flashing lights anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's flashing lights.</v>

177
00:07:24.231 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm not epileptic anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's flashing lights.</v>

178
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:27.520
<v Speaker 2>I tend to avoid that place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

179
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.730
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what that's doing to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We May.</v>

180
00:07:29.731 --> 00:07:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if it's a person like you or </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have epilepsy,</v>

181
00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:34.340
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's just a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

182
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you could only endure a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount.</v>

183
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.860
<v Speaker 2>I would think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

184
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:39.380
<v Speaker 2>Because when they torture you seen those</v>
<v Speaker 2>videos and shit.</v>

185
00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:44.381
<v Speaker 2>Where do they like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean not torture videos but like re </v>

186
00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:47.020
<v Speaker 2>reenactments or like things in movies </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're flashing lights and </v>

187
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:47.020
<v Speaker 2>torturing the guy.</v>

188
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:47.020
<v Speaker 2>That's part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

189
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.000
<v Speaker 2>The senses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sensory deprivation,</v>

190
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:51.870
<v Speaker 2>the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese water torture.</v>

191
00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Every would just little drips drips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

192
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Have you read that Jon Ronson Book?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men who stare at goats?</v>

193
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've had them on here,</v>

194
00:07:58.011 --> 00:07:58.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>

195
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.390
<v Speaker 2>That book is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How they would torture people by playing</v>

196
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.530
<v Speaker 2>like hip hop music or whatever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

197
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.980
<v Speaker 2>There's been a well with Panama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is that guy?</v>

198
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.450
<v Speaker 2>Manuel Noriega what they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they used to play death metal.</v>

199
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:16.870
<v Speaker 2>I think they used to pay them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like that kind of shit,</v>

200
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.290
<v Speaker 2>but I get that because if I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere and then that happens.</v>

201
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:26.870
<v Speaker 2>I leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they played uptown girl too from</v>

202
00:08:26.871 --> 00:08:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Billy Joel and I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

203
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.110
<v Speaker 2>I think that was one of the things they </v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

204
00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:32.180
<v Speaker 2>They played uptown curl and bring beer </v>
<v Speaker 2>song too.</v>

205
00:08:32.181 --> 00:08:37.160
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a bad pr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good pr for them.</v>

206
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.680
<v Speaker 2>One side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

207
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.540
<v Speaker 2>One time you hear that song,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

208
00:08:41.541 --> 00:08:42.620
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember this song is good.</v>

209
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:47.770
<v Speaker 2>I have a theory about that song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What billy Joel is an incredibly </v>

210
00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:52.961
<v Speaker 2>talented musician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not the best looking guy in the </v>

211
00:08:52.961 --> 00:08:52.961
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we agree on that?</v>

212
00:08:52.961 --> 00:08:52.961
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

225
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Mood enhancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bastard.</v>

226
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Billy Joel is an average looking fella </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he hooked up with arguably one </v>

227
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:21.540
<v Speaker 1>of the hottest woman that stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

237
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Rectal couldn't handle it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

238
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.970
<v Speaker 1>But he got even bigger after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't matter.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear what you're saying and she was so</v>

241
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.550
<v Speaker 1>She's still hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like 17.</v>

242
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.640
<v Speaker 1>My favorite is her in the Chuck Norris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you call it?</v>

243
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Total gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

244
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they would do the little dude,</v>

245
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.230
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would watch that info.</v>

246
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:15.410
<v Speaker 1>I love infomercials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched them late at night and that </v>

247
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.050
<v Speaker 1>was my favorite infomercial and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they remade it.</v>

248
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't like it as much as the </v>

249
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.661
<v Speaker 1>original.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how much I watch because the </v>

250
00:10:23.661 --> 00:10:23.661
<v Speaker 1>original was so good because Chuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>Norris was like,</v>

251
00:10:23.661 --> 00:10:28.160
<v Speaker 1>let's just fucking get through this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Christie Brinkley was doing it </v>

252
00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.311
<v Speaker 1>really well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just so funny to see Chuck </v>

253
00:10:31.311 --> 00:10:31.311
<v Speaker 1>Norris has faced during that and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>read did it and he figured it out.</v>

254
00:10:31.311 --> 00:10:33.150
<v Speaker 1>He figured out how to do a little better</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't like that dude.</v>

255
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I met Chuck Norris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met him a couple times.</v>

256
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:39.240
<v Speaker 1>This was the proudest moment in my life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Chuck Norris knew who I was.</v>

257
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Real.</v>

258
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.110
<v Speaker 1>For real meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Chuck Norris,</v>

259
00:10:43.111 --> 00:10:44.520
<v Speaker 1>he comes and gives you a big hug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

260
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think about two years ago.</v>

266
00:10:57.841 --> 00:10:59.220
<v Speaker 1>I met him again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

267

280
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.441
<v Speaker 1>that he stayed current.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chuck Norris is a black belt in </v>

<v Speaker 1>high level and he can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was a world champion striker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chuck Norris has a bout as legit as any </v>

<v Speaker 1>Way more comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:12:49.031 --> 00:12:52.180
<v Speaker 1>I always got pants that were too big for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me just so I can kick people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever.</v>

315
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:00.760
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my buddy,</v>

316
00:13:00.761 --> 00:13:02.020
<v Speaker 1>when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I used to train,</v>

317
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I trained when I was like 20 to 26 and </v>

318
00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:07.160
<v Speaker 1>my buddy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you do that?</v>

319
00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:07.690
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

320
00:13:07.691 --> 00:13:09.250
<v Speaker 1>just to like protect myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

321
00:13:09.251 --> 00:13:10.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's happening to you?</v>

322
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:12.220
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

323
00:13:12.221 --> 00:13:13.570
<v Speaker 1>you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

324
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:15.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're kind of fucking right man.</v>

326
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of writing in these.</v>

327
00:13:20.381 --> 00:13:25.381
<v Speaker 1>Definitely not right all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>because obviously people get fucked up </v>

328
00:13:25.381 --> 00:13:25.381
<v Speaker 1>all the time of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was like,</v>

329
00:13:25.381 --> 00:13:30.001
<v Speaker 1>you kind of know where you're always </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be and it's going to be fine </v>

330
00:13:30.001 --> 00:13:30.001
<v Speaker 1>and it Kinda time.</v>

331
00:13:30.001 --> 00:13:30.130
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time I know you just meet </v>
<v Speaker 1>General.</v>

332
00:13:30.131 --> 00:13:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you never know what's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

333
00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:33.370
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's right in the sense that you put</v>

334
00:13:33.371 --> 00:13:37.380
<v Speaker 1>so much effort into self defense and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost never comes up.</v>

335
00:13:37.381 --> 00:13:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>something that never took place.</v>

338
00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:43.150
<v Speaker 1>And then you get to a point where if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're known for it,</v>

339
00:13:43.151 --> 00:13:44.890
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.940
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong if you met him on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>

351
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:07.900
<v Speaker 1>he's the nicest guy.</v>

352
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.700
<v Speaker 1>He's super friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saw his thing with,</v>

353
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:14.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like undisputed or whatever the hell </v>

354
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:14.850

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

355
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:14.850
<v Speaker 1>you seem like a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

356
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.050
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at a club with chocolate though,</v>

357
00:14:17.051 --> 00:14:22.000
<v Speaker 1>way back in the day when chuck was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC light heavyweight champ and some guy</v>

358
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.960
<v Speaker 1>said something to one of his friends and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like some douche moment who knows</v>

359
00:14:25.961 --> 00:14:29.630
<v Speaker 1>what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a bunch of silly pizza,</v>

360
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.340
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

361
00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:36.660
<v Speaker 1>his buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's meatheads meatheads on both </v>

362
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.901
<v Speaker 1>sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy came over and said something </v>

363
00:14:39.901 --> 00:14:41.680
<v Speaker 1>and Chuck Odell stood up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned around and looked at him and this</v>

364
00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:45.850
<v Speaker 1>guy looked like he saw a fucking ghost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked into chuck's eyes.</v>

365
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.200
<v Speaker 1>There's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

366
00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a type of dude that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>start fights with,</v>

367
00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:50.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

368
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.790
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile still people fuck with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

369
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.500
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people fuck with that.</v>

370
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.490
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's kind of the equivalent as </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody going up to a comedian thinking</v>

371
00:14:58.491 --> 00:15:03.491
<v Speaker 1>that they're funny and doing a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will walk up to the scariest </v>

372
00:15:03.621 --> 00:15:06.200
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker on the face of the planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>and start shit with them.</v>

373
00:15:06.201 --> 00:15:11.201
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid you bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be guys who do that to </v>

374
00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:12.110
<v Speaker 1>allister or brock lesnar people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>retarded.</v>

375
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:17.170
<v Speaker 1>So weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you gotta do is shake one of these </v>

376
00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:17.170
<v Speaker 1>guys' hands and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

377
00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:17.580
<v Speaker 1>you're a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>

378
00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Good tape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fletcher's hand.</v>

379
00:15:20.541 --> 00:15:21.650
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

380
00:15:21.651 --> 00:15:25.430
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking your cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

381
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.600
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

382
00:15:26.601 --> 00:15:28.440
<v Speaker 1>he's a small moose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even you do it.</v>

383
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.170
<v Speaker 1>I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the times we've said,</v>

384
00:15:30.171 --> 00:15:35.171
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I s I shit you not and I'm not blowing </v>

385
00:15:35.171 --> 00:15:35.171
<v Speaker 1>smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We said,</v>

386
00:15:35.171 --> 00:15:38.741
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did one of these and one of those </v>

387
00:15:38.741 --> 00:15:38.741
<v Speaker 1>fucking side hugs you my jaw hit your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking shoulder.</v>

388
00:15:38.741 --> 00:15:43.480
<v Speaker 1>And for two days I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's okay to kind of get out </v>

389
00:15:43.731 --> 00:15:44.370
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get it,</v>

390
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.260
<v Speaker 1>it's good for you to get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

391
00:15:48.261 --> 00:15:49.850
<v Speaker 1>it just hit the wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

392
00:15:49.851 --> 00:15:53.540
<v Speaker 1>It was like John's or weak man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just stupid design.</v>

393
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:57.180
<v Speaker 1>It's the unfair part of the human body </v>
<v Speaker 1>besides Dick and balls.</v>

394
00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been dropped?</v>

395
00:15:58.351 --> 00:16:00.140
<v Speaker 1>You ever been punched and dropped in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>balls?</v>

396
00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:00.990
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No children?</v>

397
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:01.670
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

398
00:16:01.671 --> 00:16:02.860
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the weirdest thing,</v>

399
00:16:02.861 --> 00:16:04.490
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been rocked before,</v>

400
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.780
<v Speaker 1>but I got dropped once in a kickboxing </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight and my legs just gave out.</v>

401
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:13.840
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's never happened like that before </v>

402
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:13.850
<v Speaker 1>where it's like a switch shut off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was totally conscious.</v>

403
00:16:13.851 --> 00:16:18.851
<v Speaker 1>I could see the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It clipped my chin and my legs just </v>

404
00:16:18.851 --> 00:16:20.360
<v Speaker 1>stopped working so it just went out from</v>
<v Speaker 1>under me and I see.</v>

405
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:23.540
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I got hit in the jaw with a foot,</v>

406
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.160
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>my job would just break.</v>

407
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a punch.</v>

408
00:16:26.181 --> 00:16:29.750
<v Speaker 1>I got hit with a left hook and a I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped.</v>

409
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:34.810
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was weirder than anytime I've ever </v>

410
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:34.810
<v Speaker 1>dropped before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

411
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.550
<v Speaker 1>it was a everything shut off like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my brain did,</v>

412
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.920
<v Speaker 1>but my legs just stopped working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so did you remember?</v>

413
00:16:39.921 --> 00:16:43.310
<v Speaker 1>It totally went unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was totally conscious.</v>

414
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.650
<v Speaker 1>It just my body went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once he clipped me,</v>

415
00:16:45.651 --> 00:16:50.420
<v Speaker 1>my body just wasn't working anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

416
00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.030
<v Speaker 1>took a break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to get up,</v>

417
00:16:53.031 --> 00:16:56.300
<v Speaker 1>my legs were rubber and I got up to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet and I covered up and he hit me with</v>

418
00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.250
<v Speaker 1>a couple of upper cuts and drop me </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

419
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the whole time,</v>

420
00:17:00.501 --> 00:17:02.110
<v Speaker 1>like my body was just not working </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

421
00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Once he clipped me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

422
00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>

423
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.900
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even minutes afterwards for sure.</v>

424
00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't move.</v>

425
00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Like I was trying to get up and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't working.</v>

426
00:17:11.841 --> 00:17:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

427
00:17:12.591 --> 00:17:14.390
<v Speaker 1>that's got to be frustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

428
00:17:14.391 --> 00:17:17.210
<v Speaker 1>if you get hit really hard there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the whole thing just shuts off.</v>

429
00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.380
<v Speaker 1>It's such a stupid design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

430
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it's relatively hard to knock </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone out unless you hit.</v>

431
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's weird.</v>

432
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Like people get caught in strange ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they get not like there's no science</v>

433
00:17:27.561 --> 00:17:30.260
<v Speaker 1>to when you get knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well also you've got to worry about like</v>

434
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.680
<v Speaker 1>when you're hitting the ground too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that could fuck you up.</v>

435
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a UFC fighter named Tim Hank </v>

436
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:39.380
<v Speaker 1>who just died a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a week or so ago,</v>

437
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.480
<v Speaker 1>about a week ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

438
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:46.510
<v Speaker 1>he was in a boxing match and apparently </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's suffered quite a few knockouts in </v>

439
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:47.150
<v Speaker 1>the last uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>year or so,</v>

440
00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.320
<v Speaker 1>and they really probably shouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been fighting it all.</v>

441
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.630
<v Speaker 1>And he got knocked out and as he got </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed,</v>

442
00:17:51.631 --> 00:17:54.630
<v Speaker 1>his head hit the ground hard because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was out cold.</v>

443
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.500
<v Speaker 1>He bounced off the canvas of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a boxing ring and it sounded horrible,</v>

444
00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:00.710
<v Speaker 1>but it was even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it was Kansas,</v>

445
00:18:00.711 --> 00:18:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>

446
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.800
<v Speaker 1>I think it's canvas over wood though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have like thin,</v>

447
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:08.670
<v Speaker 1>like a UFC belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a good thick,</v>

448
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:13.390
<v Speaker 1>fairly thick canvas because there's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many take downs and you know,</v>

449
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.710
<v Speaker 1>broader slams and stuff like that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>to give to that floor.</v>

450
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.100
<v Speaker 1>But on boxing rings it can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>considerably stiffer.</v>

451
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.740
<v Speaker 1>And there's different schools of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

452
00:18:22.741 --> 00:18:27.741
<v Speaker 1>like some people like a really soft </v>
<v Speaker 1>floor because it makes it harder for </v>

453
00:18:27.741 --> 00:18:29.160
<v Speaker 1>guys to run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's almost like running in sand,</v>

454
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:30.540
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

455
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.670
<v Speaker 1>and also safer if you get more of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>matte.</v>

456
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of a matte.</v>

457
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the UFC is like,</v>

458
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.680
<v Speaker 1>it's like a matte surface,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's covered in canvas,</v>

459
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.270
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of fucked up because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>never grapple on canvas until you fight.</v>

460
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.700
<v Speaker 1>And occasionally you'd get ripped up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets torn apart by the canvas.</v>

461
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went back rough.</v>

462
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:48.500
<v Speaker 1>I went back and did a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

463
00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.760
<v Speaker 1>you saw the video I did with the Joe </v>
<v Speaker 1>Garcia.</v>

464
00:18:50.761 --> 00:18:51.830
<v Speaker 1>You Know Joel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

465
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you guys met but we </v>

466
00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:56.840
<v Speaker 1>never met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

467
00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:56.840
<v Speaker 1>I was big fan of his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

468
00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.710
<v Speaker 1>He um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he submitted.</v>

469
00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Was it?</v>

470
00:18:59.641 --> 00:19:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Was it saccharide?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

471
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:02.220
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Asian guy.</v>

472
00:19:02.221 --> 00:19:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A room in a though he submitted to pen,</v>

473
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Ya know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

474
00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.970
<v Speaker 1>think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was in Japan.</v>

475
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.160
<v Speaker 1>He went overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

476
00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.560
<v Speaker 1>but it was a huge deal because Rwanda </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sato at the time was one of the biggest </v>

477
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:18.840
<v Speaker 1>mma fighters in the world.</v>

478
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Pull that up if that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly that I think it's ruined.</v>

479
00:19:22.141 --> 00:19:27.141
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's sotto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sotto was like a super high level </v>

480
00:19:27.141 --> 00:19:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu competitor as well as a mixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts fighter.</v>

481
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Joel said that he.</v>

482
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:36.120
<v Speaker 1>It was like the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember he was saying he wasn't</v>

483
00:19:36.121 --> 00:19:41.121
<v Speaker 1>sure how practical his knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting was until then.</v>

484
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting because he got the </v>

485
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:47.210
<v Speaker 1>guy in an arm bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

486
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:48.570
<v Speaker 1>after going right to the ground and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

487
00:19:48.571 --> 00:19:50.630
<v Speaker 1>it was over right then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

488
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:55.730
<v Speaker 1>you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's dudes out there that you don't </v>

489
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.221
<v Speaker 1>know the fucking world class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about Jujitsu is there's guys </v>

490
00:19:58.221 --> 00:19:59.190
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

491
00:19:59.191 --> 00:20:00.270
<v Speaker 1>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>

492
00:20:00.271 --> 00:20:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Is this it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

493
00:20:01.411 --> 00:20:01.840
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>

494
00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:04.170
<v Speaker 3>Um.</v>

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is good down.</v>

496
00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:10.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's four minutes,</v>

497
00:20:10.961 --> 00:20:13.660
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like this is the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

498
00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:19.020
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the one and he gets him </v>
<v Speaker 1>down on the ground and that doesn't </v>

499
00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:19.150
<v Speaker 1>honor bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

505
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:31.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he fucked his arm up and </v>

506
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.720
<v Speaker 4>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Dude,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but known for his grappling.</v>

514
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:59.190

582
00:23:52.881 --> 00:23:55.520
<v Speaker 2>It is standup as you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just you,</v>

583
00:23:55.521 --> 00:23:58.400
<v Speaker 2>you do what you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas these other things is.</v>

584
00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.650
<v Speaker 2>And that's a weird thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are like,</v>

585
00:24:00.651 --> 00:24:05.651
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should enjoy work with other people </v>

586
00:24:05.651 --> 00:24:05.651
<v Speaker 2>and sure and career to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's great.</v>

587
00:24:05.651 --> 00:24:09.401
<v Speaker 2>But there's something about like knowing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you put together your whole set </v>

588
00:24:09.401 --> 00:24:13.751
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you figured out which way the shit </v>

589
00:24:13.751 --> 00:24:13.751
<v Speaker 2>should go.</v>

590
00:24:13.751 --> 00:24:13.940
<v Speaker 2>And then like you go do somebody else's </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

591
00:24:13.941 --> 00:24:14.690
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>

592
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:19.280
<v Speaker 2>this isn't as engaging unless you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing for me.</v>

593
00:24:19.281 --> 00:24:24.281
<v Speaker 2>unless you're playing like a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>character or like a or something that's </v>

594
00:24:24.281 --> 00:24:24.800
<v Speaker 2>funny and you get to ad lib and fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

595
00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:25.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

597
00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:29.120
<v Speaker 2>It's a bit like some people thrive on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

598
00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Some kind of thrive on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

599
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.890
<v Speaker 2>I know I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you lose a lot of them.</v>

600
00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.410
<v Speaker 2>They start to just go to acting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay over there.</v>

601
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:40.870
<v Speaker 2>Somebody was telling me recently that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were bummed out about how and they.</v>

602
00:24:40.871 --> 00:24:44.660
<v Speaker 2>And it was a good point about how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

603
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:48.020
<v Speaker 2>people like fortune feemster who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hilarious,</v>

604
00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:53.050
<v Speaker 2>like she doesn't have an especial yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>because she's doing so much acting work </v>

605
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.060
<v Speaker 2>and she's like a true comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's really fucking funny,</v>

606
00:24:56.061 --> 00:25:01.061
<v Speaker 2>but It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well duncan trussell doesn't have a </v>

607
00:25:01.061 --> 00:25:01.061
<v Speaker 2>special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

608
00:25:01.061 --> 00:25:02.120
<v Speaker 2>There's another one that's insane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but does he act?</v>

609
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:03.620
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just does.</v>

610
00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:04.730
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck's he doing?</v>

611
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:09.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's funny as shit though.</v>

612

<v Speaker 2>It's the best.</v>

614
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.150
<v Speaker 2>But I mean for a guy that is as advanced</v>
<v Speaker 2>as he has,</v>

615
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:20.690
<v Speaker 2>he should absolutely have a special day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'd have another special for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>we rented a house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was me,</v>

871
00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.190
<v Speaker 1>my sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my parents.</v>

<v Speaker 1>my dad's rented one of the rooms in the </v>

873
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:20.781
<v Speaker 1>house upstairs and the next door is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very small house and next door was </v>

874
00:36:20.781 --> 00:36:22.650
<v Speaker 1>another small house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these young kids lived there.</v>

875
00:36:22.651 --> 00:36:27.651
<v Speaker 1>Like the downstairs people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a band and they were fucking </v>

876
00:36:27.651 --> 00:36:27.651
<v Speaker 1>horrible.</v>

877
00:36:27.651 --> 00:36:29.550
<v Speaker 1>But they were like super committed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they practice all the time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had carpet everywhere man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and pack the walls.</v>

881
00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:48.740
<v Speaker 1>And they essentially turned the basement</v>
<v Speaker 1>into like a practice soundproof thing.</v>

882
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:53.960

<v Speaker 2>school in 81,</v>

931
00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.440
<v Speaker 2>so that would make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like,</v>

932
00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:15.500
<v Speaker 2>so I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I was 13 and in a little later </v>

933
00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:15.500
<v Speaker 2>in the career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but dude,</v>

934
00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:19.360
<v Speaker 2>that's two years later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about [inaudible] 79 in </v>

935
00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:24.220
<v Speaker 2>1979.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure that was the age I was </v>

936
00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:24.220
<v Speaker 2>pretty crazy because I was 13.</v>

937
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:31.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was right when I first moved </v>

938
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:31.230
<v Speaker 2>to boston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were living in Jamaica plain.</v>

939
00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:36.450
<v Speaker 2>We were living on a god damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the name of the street </v>

940
00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:37.420
<v Speaker 2>for remember the name of the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would help,</v>

941
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:38.330
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll.</v>

942
00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.350
<v Speaker 2>That haunted me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those girls laughing in my face.</v>

943
00:39:41.351 --> 00:39:43.970
<v Speaker 2>Funny haunted me for years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still think about it.</v>

944
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:45.580
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about.</v>

945
00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.660
<v Speaker 2>I think about shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's I think about shit like that that</v>

946
00:39:49.661 --> 00:39:54.050
<v Speaker 2>like you carry with you like you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>how sometimes it's just.</v>

947
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:56.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it's just like that's.</v>

948
00:39:56.580 --> 00:40:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean nothing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what happened was you were too young</v>

949
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:02.920
<v Speaker 2>to have dealt with a situation like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

950
00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:04.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was why you remember it,</v>

951
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:05.980
<v Speaker 2>because you're still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

952

<v Speaker 2>this is new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh god.</v>

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:12.420
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was aware of personally aware of how </v>

954
00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:12.580
<v Speaker 2>we're stupid.</v>

955
00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:14.230
<v Speaker 2>I sounded right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which,</v>

956
00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:18.230
<v Speaker 2>but as a kid you don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

957
00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.420
<v Speaker 2>You knoW.</v>

958
00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.910

<v Speaker 2>so were both forgiven.</v>

959
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.910
<v Speaker 2>I remember that I had to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

960
00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:29.030

<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>

961
00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.380
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:04.310
<v Speaker 2>just stick with it because it's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

995
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:07.520
<v Speaker 2>And finally it was so sticky that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

996
00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:11.630
<v Speaker 2>I hope that this is like paying off </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I got to wipe my face.</v>

997
00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.100
<v Speaker 2>And so I asked the girl like really </v>
<v Speaker 2>insecurely,</v>

998
00:42:14.101 --> 00:42:14.990
<v Speaker 2>like next to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1003
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.540
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1004
00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.140
<v Speaker 2>And then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I go to the bathroom?</v>

1005
00:42:27.141 --> 00:42:29.570
<v Speaker 2>And I washed my face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what in the bathroom?</v>

1006
00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:32.000
<v Speaker 2>And then I looked at my face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just my face,</v>

1007
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.740
<v Speaker 2>zero purple.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but that was like an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those were actual thoughts that this </v>

1011
00:42:46.631 --> 00:42:47.741
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This moments you can remember when </v>

1012
00:42:47.741 --> 00:42:48.440
<v Speaker 2>you're just a little kid where you're so</v>

<v Speaker 2>think about that all the time.</v>

1014
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:55.190
<v Speaker 2>I think about all the time it's probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaped me,</v>

1015
00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:01.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it definitely has like one ass kicking </v>

1016
00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.260
<v Speaker 2>in highschool could turn you one way or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next left or right.</v>

1017
00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Like people have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people have been bullied in high </v>

1018
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.030
<v Speaker 2>school and it fucked him up for the rest</v>
<v Speaker 2>of their life.</v>

1019
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they a lot.</v>

1020
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:11.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean and even before high school,</v>

1021
00:43:11.371 --> 00:43:13.760
<v Speaker 2>like junior high in grammar school and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

1022
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:15.710
<v Speaker 2>some people just never recovered from </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1023
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:21.190
<v Speaker 2>So weird inclination that people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullies in schools like to find one kid </v>

1024
00:43:23.031 --> 00:43:25.040
<v Speaker 2>who fucking nervous and start fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>

1025
00:43:25.041 --> 00:43:26.450
<v Speaker 2>YeAh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very normal to me.</v>

1026
00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.190
<v Speaker 2>Where you going after school?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nelson?</v>

1027
00:43:28.191 --> 00:43:30.380
<v Speaker 2>Besides sucking my dick in the woods.</v>

1028
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:38.150
<v Speaker 2>I never understood that big giant gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude wants you to suck his dick in the </v>

1029
00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:41.090
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to go to high school with him,</v>

1030
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:43.100
<v Speaker 2>fight him off every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Parents don't believe you.</v>

1031
00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:45.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

1032
00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:48.710
<v Speaker 2>I loved always making fun of people but </v>
<v Speaker 2>not bullying.</v>

1033
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:50.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1034
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:54.380
<v Speaker 2>Well I think there's a lot of kids who </v>
<v Speaker 2>get physically abused at home.</v>

1035
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:59.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a Big fan and they get </v>

1036
00:43:59.410 --> 00:43:59.410
<v Speaker 2>their power back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1037
00:43:59.410 --> 00:43:59.600
<v Speaker 2>And then there's physical bullying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1038
00:43:59.601 --> 00:44:04.601
<v Speaker 2>but then the psychological bullying too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's a certain amount of </v>

1039
00:44:04.601 --> 00:44:06.020
<v Speaker 2>natural pecking order shit that kids do </v>
<v Speaker 2>to each other.</v>

1040
00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:11.210
<v Speaker 2>They're competitive with each other and </v>
<v Speaker 2>one will say something shitty and the </v>

1041
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:12.380
<v Speaker 2>next will say something shitty back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they form teams,</v>

1042
00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:13.670
<v Speaker 2>cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chris,</v>

1043
00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:14.530
<v Speaker 2>piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you're like,</v>

1047
00:44:22.251 --> 00:44:23.390
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1048
00:44:23.391 --> 00:44:28.391
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of animal behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I have chickens and one of my </v>

1049
00:44:28.391 --> 00:44:28.400
<v Speaker 2>chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of them,</v>

1050
00:44:28.401 --> 00:44:33.401
<v Speaker 2>something goes wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the other ones start fucking with </v>

1051
00:44:33.401 --> 00:44:33.401
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They peck at it.</v>

1052
00:44:33.401 --> 00:44:33.401
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1053
00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

1054
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't eat the chicken.</v>

1055
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Just eat their eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are non fertilized.</v>

1056
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:44.180
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you crazy vegans out there.</v>

1057
00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Not getting enough protein in the eggs </v>
<v Speaker 1>from chickens.</v>

1058
00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Throw your pets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to run around.</v>

1059
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.960
<v Speaker 1>You can even if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feed them vegetarian diets,</v>

1060
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:56.040
<v Speaker 1>which you really shouldn't because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not vegetarian is little fucking</v>

1061
00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:01.100
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is when they see like </v>

1062
00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:01.100
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with one of the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones,</v>

1063
00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them gets injured,</v>

1064
00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:04.560
<v Speaker 1>the other ones start pecking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weird.</v>

1065
00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>iT makes you think that that's how we </v>

1066
00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:09.650
<v Speaker 1>are secretively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1067
00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:09.660
<v Speaker 1>I think at our base level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1068
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:14.870
<v Speaker 1>but I think what is so like one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting about all these anti </v>

1069
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:18.381
<v Speaker 1>bullying campaigns is that they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist when we were younger and whether </v>

1070
00:45:18.381 --> 00:45:21.890
<v Speaker 1>or not you make an argument for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how to get along through </v>

1071
00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:23.280
<v Speaker 1>the natural methods that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>encountered,</v>

1072
00:45:23.281 --> 00:45:27.090
<v Speaker 1>like finding good people and bad people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and finding who you like and finding out</v>

1073
00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:29.340
<v Speaker 1>about your own behavior and how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>affects other people.</v>

1074
00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Either way it's a w,</v>
<v Speaker 1>w,</v>

1075
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.680
<v Speaker 1>w.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I think's going on is we don't want</v>

1076
00:45:34.681 --> 00:45:39.681
<v Speaker 1>people to fuck with people anymore and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think in the old days everybody just </v>

1077
00:45:39.681 --> 00:45:44.331
<v Speaker 1>accepted that people fucked up people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now we realized we're going older </v>

1078
00:45:44.331 --> 00:45:48.321
<v Speaker 1>were really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's crazy is that we're figuring </v>

1079
00:45:48.321 --> 00:45:48.480
<v Speaker 1>this out as a culture in the last 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>

1080
00:45:48.481 --> 00:45:51.990
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck years it's been human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings have been around now for.</v>

1081
00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:52.940
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1082
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:55.470
<v Speaker 1>it's social media though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is because now everything</v>

1083
00:45:55.471 --> 00:45:57.180
<v Speaker 1>is exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is thAt.</v>

1084
00:45:57.181 --> 00:46:02.181
<v Speaker 1>But I think it was on its way there just</v>
<v Speaker 1>through traditional methods like books </v>

1085
00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:05.340
<v Speaker 1>and regular media and colleges and </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities.</v>

1086
00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:10.610
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why college </v>
<v Speaker 1>and universities are so important for </v>

1087
00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:13.401
<v Speaker 1>changing thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially were there kind of in a </v>

1088
00:46:13.401 --> 00:46:16.101
<v Speaker 1>fucked up place now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a thing where you would </v>

1089
00:46:16.101 --> 00:46:17.520
<v Speaker 1>leave your environment and go to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>new environment,</v>

1090
00:46:17.521 --> 00:46:21.520
<v Speaker 1>right in this new environment would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>filled with intellectual,</v>

1091
00:46:21.521 --> 00:46:22.850
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>filled with people,</v>

1092
00:46:22.851 --> 00:46:27.851
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to change the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be exposed to ideas you never got </v>

1093
00:46:27.851 --> 00:46:30.741
<v Speaker 1>before and so through those ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you learn about your shit and then </v>

1094
00:46:30.741 --> 00:46:34.731
<v Speaker 1>you'd go out with this idea that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go do this or you're going to </v>

1095
00:46:34.731 --> 00:46:37.401
<v Speaker 1>go apply your knowledge now there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or get a degree here and everything </v>

1096
00:46:37.401 --> 00:46:41.751
<v Speaker 1>would sort of compound in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the world would be far </v>

1097
00:46:41.751 --> 00:46:41.751
<v Speaker 1>better than the people that came before </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1098
00:46:41.751 --> 00:46:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Because just the fact that humanity's </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulated 20,</v>

1099
00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:48.060
<v Speaker 1>30 plus years of information since the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time your parents were in school.</v>

1100
00:46:48.061 --> 00:46:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1101
00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:51.540
<v Speaker 1>so all that aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as that goes by,</v>

1102
00:46:51.541 --> 00:46:56.541
<v Speaker 1>that gets you a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets you a certain amount of steps </v>

1103
00:46:56.541 --> 00:46:58.410
<v Speaker 1>past the barbarians and the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>romans,</v>

1104
00:46:58.411 --> 00:47:02.820
<v Speaker 1>all the psychopaths of our history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now once social media kicks in,</v>

1105
00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:07.970
<v Speaker 1>now everything's accelerated in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't even control completely out </v>

1106
00:47:08.341 --> 00:47:12.030
<v Speaker 1>everybody's hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why trigger words and safe spaces</v>

1107
00:47:12.031 --> 00:47:15.870
<v Speaker 1>and everyone's going fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too fast for us to catch up with,</v>

1108
00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's moving in the right direction.</v>

1109
00:47:18.451 --> 00:47:21.630
<v Speaker 1>like even all the ridiculous like </v>
<v Speaker 1>trigger word safe space and stuff.</v>

1110
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:25.410
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in thE inclination is to be nicer.</v>

1111
00:47:25.411 --> 00:47:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing for sure.</v>

1112
00:47:27.001 --> 00:47:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some of it's ridiculous.</v>

1113
00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:33.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not well thought out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're better off having people </v>

1114
00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:34.450
<v Speaker 1>communicate and having safe spaces.</v>

1115
00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:39.450
<v Speaker 1>You better off figuring out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bake people just not shitty to each </v>

1116
00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:39.450
<v Speaker 1>other and screaming and yelling at each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

1117
00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:41.490
<v Speaker 1>like find a better method of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating now.</v>

1118
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:44.320
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is,</v>

1119
00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.210
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're moving in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

1120
00:47:46.211 --> 00:47:47.590
<v Speaker 1>They're moving in a really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

1121
00:47:47.591 --> 00:47:52.591
<v Speaker 1>Even these ridiculous like liberals at </v>
<v Speaker 1>shut down that evergreen college and </v>

1122
00:47:52.591 --> 00:47:56.041
<v Speaker 1>they're going nuts and they didn't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>white people to show up for work for a </v>

1123
00:47:56.041 --> 00:47:57.160
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their inclination is probably correct.</v>

1124
00:47:57.161 --> 00:47:59.920
<v Speaker 1>I just want to balance things out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when things are right now,</v>

1125
00:47:59.921 --> 00:48:04.921
<v Speaker 1>they feel like black people are still </v>
<v Speaker 1>like in a bad position as far as like </v>

1126
00:48:04.921 --> 00:48:08.571
<v Speaker 1>racial injustice and by pushing white </v>
<v Speaker 1>people down they're going to bounce a </v>

1127
00:48:08.571 --> 00:48:10.330
<v Speaker 1>black people out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they just don't understand humans.</v>

1128
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't.</v>

1129
00:48:11.381 --> 00:48:12.610
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that works.</v>

1130
00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:15.720
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're breaking it down crystal.</v>

1131
00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:20.200
<v Speaker 1>I know man on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it hard picking a name</v>

1132
00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.100
<v Speaker 2>for your special or this one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was not because you have a bit.</v>

1133
00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:23.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1134
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:25.590
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1135
00:48:25.591 --> 00:48:26.760
<v Speaker 2>I find it difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1136
00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:28.050
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1137
00:48:28.051 --> 00:48:30.240
<v Speaker 2>I was actually before yours came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1138
00:48:30.241 --> 00:48:35.241
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody should do like trigger warning </v>

1139
00:48:35.241 --> 00:48:35.241
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:48:35.241 --> 00:48:37.671
<v Speaker 2>I jUst did a great title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it because I knew what they were </v>

1141
00:48:37.671 --> 00:48:37.671
<v Speaker 2>upset some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's.</v>

1142
00:48:37.671 --> 00:48:38.340
<v Speaker 2>But that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's who you are though.</v>

1143
00:48:38.341 --> 00:48:39.570
<v Speaker 2>And that's what that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1144
00:48:39.571 --> 00:48:42.940
<v Speaker 2>you talk about all the things that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>trigger somebody well,</v>

1145
00:48:42.941 --> 00:48:47.070
<v Speaker 2>like just talk about what's ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 2>about those things and with that special</v>

<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>

1155
00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Like it started out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it started out a little different.</v>

1156
00:49:11.191 --> 00:49:16.191
<v Speaker 1>It started out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a little more calm and then I </v>

1157
00:49:16.191 --> 00:49:16.191
<v Speaker 1>realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1158
00:49:16.191 --> 00:49:18.840
<v Speaker 1>the only way this is gonna work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like worth people gonna really think I'm</v>

1159
00:49:18.841 --> 00:49:23.010
<v Speaker 1>a demon because I try to think this is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking goofy thing to admit,</v>

1160
00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:28.250
<v Speaker 1>but when I'm doing that bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do this bit about tigers </v>

1161
00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:31.611
<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the key that I figured out </v>

1162
00:49:31.611 --> 00:49:33.441
<v Speaker 1>the key to the bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At one point the key to the bit was to </v>

1163
00:49:33.441 --> 00:49:33.720
<v Speaker 1>think like a tiger and to move like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tie.</v>

1164
00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Not think of myself as a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I did that bit I was thinking of </v>

1165
00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:40.960
<v Speaker 1>myself as a demon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was thinking of myself as a card.</v>

1166
00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:45.330
<v Speaker 1>It kicks off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then my inclination was to just climb</v>

1167
00:49:45.331 --> 00:49:50.331
<v Speaker 1>on the stool and just like in getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>this weird sort of gollum hunched over </v>

1168
00:49:50.431 --> 00:49:55.431
<v Speaker 1>stance because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And plus I figured because I'm really </v>

1169
00:49:55.431 --> 00:49:55.431
<v Speaker 1>flexible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll look weird.</v>

1170
00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:57.600
<v Speaker 1>strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1171
00:49:58.170 --> 00:49:59.640
<v Speaker 2>that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My son was,</v>

1172
00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:04.650
<v Speaker 2>my opener is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you do like to act out like that </v>

1173
00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:06.771
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just believed that that's what you </v>

1174
00:50:06.771 --> 00:50:06.771
<v Speaker 2>are for a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

1175
00:50:06.771 --> 00:50:07.000
<v Speaker 1>it's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

1176
00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:11.210
<v Speaker 1>But if you could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could pull it off,</v>

1177
00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:16.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever see jimmy schubert's bit about </v>

1178
00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:16.650
<v Speaker 1>eagles meeting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1179
00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:18.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a hilarious bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when schubert's doing it,</v>

1180
00:50:18.891 --> 00:50:23.891
<v Speaker 1>it's becAuse eagles have this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing where they fuck while they're </v>

1181
00:50:23.891 --> 00:50:24.410
<v Speaker 1>flying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they fuck,</v>

1182
00:50:24.411 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 1>they stay connected untiL to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like they don't make it.</v>

1183
00:50:28.101 --> 00:50:29.900
<v Speaker 1>They fucking crashed into the ground and</v>
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>

1184
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Which is hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his bit,</v>

1185
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:37.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like got like while he's doing it,</v>

1186
00:50:37.971 --> 00:50:41.090
<v Speaker 1>even though you know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about,</v>

1187
00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:42.730
<v Speaker 1>thinking like an eagle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>

1188
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:44.290
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an eagle right now.</v>

1189
00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:45.830
<v Speaker 1>He's in his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in his element.</v>

1190

<v Speaker 2>Can we say z,</v>

1363
00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:11.560
<v Speaker 2>z,</v>
<v Speaker 2>z.</v>

<v Speaker 2>procedure is how much you've done 100 </v>

1369
00:58:33.071 --> 00:58:35.680
<v Speaker 2>procedures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 divided by 100 or 50,000</v>

1370
00:58:35.681 --> 00:58:37.000
<v Speaker 2>divided by 100.</v>

1373
00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:44.890
<v Speaker 2>100 procedures will go down as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>seizure is a thousand dollars.</v>

1374
00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:49.930
<v Speaker 2>It would be $100,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've done 100 procedures at $100 </v>

1375
00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:52.310
<v Speaker 2>each.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just $100,000</v>

1381
00:59:04.450 --> 00:59:06.940
<v Speaker 2>or $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a ledge right there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You have an idea what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think floyd mayweather.</v>

1501
01:03:54.871 --> 01:03:57.090
<v Speaker 1>It was going to win a boxing match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>

1502
01:03:57.110 --> 01:04:02.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like how he's going to win and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not he's he's challenged and </v>

1503
01:04:02.110 --> 01:04:03.750
<v Speaker 1>whether or not he's put in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could be put in danger for sure.</v>

1504
01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:09.200
<v Speaker 1>If connor puts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connor's got to put himself in danger </v>

1505
01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.830
<v Speaker 1>and he's got to be confident enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's got to get ahold of them.</v>

1506
01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:15.890
<v Speaker 1>I think he's got a rough him up and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely not going to win a straight </v>

1507
01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:17.400
<v Speaker 1>boxing match against the best boxer </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

1508
01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1509
01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he thinks he would do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

1510
01:04:20.581 --> 01:04:25.581
<v Speaker 1>I think what he wants to do is clip him </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like go after him making big sprint</v>

1511
01:04:25.831 --> 01:04:27.300
<v Speaker 1>right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to clip.</v>

1512
01:04:27.301 --> 01:04:29.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to hurt him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to rough him up.</v>

1513
01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:34.950
<v Speaker 1>The more time goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens with a guy like floyd is he</v>

1514
01:04:34.951 --> 01:04:37.250
<v Speaker 1>starts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's been boxing for so long,</v>

1515
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.660
<v Speaker 1>he starts doing things.</v>

1516
01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Then anticipating your reaction to those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1517
01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Timing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1518
01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.700
<v Speaker 1>she'll do things not even so that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>could hit you,</v>

1519
01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:49.850
<v Speaker 1>but to see how you react and how fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are and maybe if he did this and </v>

1520
01:04:49.850 --> 01:04:54.681
<v Speaker 1>then came over the top or maybe he did </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and stepped over here and hit you </v>

1521
01:04:54.681 --> 01:04:58.221
<v Speaker 1>with a left hook and he gets it in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>head and he starts moving around and he </v>

1522
01:04:58.221 --> 01:05:01.200
<v Speaker 1>puts you in like he sort of has these </v>
<v Speaker 1>parameters for your movements.</v>

1523
01:05:01.201 --> 01:05:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Almost like he's a super computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd see like anderson silva used to do</v>

1524
01:05:04.771 --> 01:05:07.470
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see him like measured timing.</v>

1525
01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:12.650
<v Speaker 1>He would see how you react that he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>just drop that front kick on your face </v>

1526
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:16.731
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just sees that there's an opening </v>

1527
01:05:16.731 --> 01:05:19.311
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows how fast he can execute a </v>

1528
01:05:19.311 --> 01:05:21.321
<v Speaker 1>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He how fast after watching a move for a </v>

1529
01:05:21.321 --> 01:05:21.790
<v Speaker 1>while that you can move and he knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you can get them.</v>

1530
01:05:21.790 --> 01:05:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Whether you can get to her like how </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>

1531
01:05:23.591 --> 01:05:28.591
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so once floyd has those numbers in his </v>

1532
01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:29.050
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you just get your face boxed off,</v>

1533
01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:34.890
<v Speaker 1>then you get your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that a guy can be so </v>

1534
01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:35.850
<v Speaker 1>good at that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1535
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
<v Speaker 1>and work so hard and not get brutally </v>
<v Speaker 1>ruined it to the point to become a and </v>

1536
01:05:43.901 --> 01:05:45.460
<v Speaker 1>then become a champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1537
01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.350
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the training and shit.</v>

1538
01:05:47.351 --> 01:05:50.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously guys get hurt and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>can become a true champion.</v>

1539
01:05:50.231 --> 01:05:55.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To be that guy that's gotten to that </v>

1540
01:05:55.231 --> 01:05:55.231
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just amazing.</v>

1541
01:05:55.231 --> 01:05:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Floyd's got a bunch of factors on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

1542
01:05:55.930 --> 01:06:00.930
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his uncle is a fantastic former </v>

1543
01:06:00.930 --> 01:06:01.600
<v Speaker 1>professional boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger may,</v>

1544
01:06:01.601 --> 01:06:03.940
<v Speaker 1>whether the black mamba corner guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a world champIon.</v>

1545
01:06:03.941 --> 01:06:07.120
<v Speaker 1>He was a bad motherfucker and he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>start guys with one punch,</v>

1546
01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:08.950
<v Speaker 1>but he had a totally different style.</v>

1547
01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:14.400
<v Speaker 1>And then his dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>floyd made with their senior phot sugar </v>

1548
01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.880
<v Speaker 1>ray leonard and had a really good fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>against sugar ray leonard,</v>

1549
01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.400
<v Speaker 1>if I want to remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was stopped,</v>

1550
01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:20.620
<v Speaker 1>laid in the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember when.</v>

1551
01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:24.760
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so his dad was an outstanding box or his</v>

1552
01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:29.790
<v Speaker 1>uncle was an outstanding boxer and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>grew up boxing,</v>

1553
01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:33.460
<v Speaker 1>so he grew up knowing technique at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very early age when,</v>

1554
01:06:33.461 --> 01:06:35.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a really early age you can get really</v>

1555
01:06:35.231 --> 01:06:37.720
<v Speaker 1>good at it because you can get good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it later.</v>

1556
01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:41.050
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of fucking unicorns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people that don't make any sense,</v>

1557
01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:44.020
<v Speaker 1>but when you're young you don't hit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

1558
01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you and your buddies and hit each </v>

1559
01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:49.930
<v Speaker 1>other and you don't hurt each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'll learn how to box and you don't</v>

1560
01:06:49.931 --> 01:06:54.931
<v Speaker 1>have the consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you learn how to box and you're 180 </v>

1561
01:06:54.931 --> 01:06:57.640
<v Speaker 1>pounds and you're boxing other dudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are 180 pounds,</v>

1562
01:06:57.930 --> 01:06:59.260
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking savages.</v>

1563
01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:02.380
<v Speaker 1>And you throw in lead at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're boxing scary and dangerous.</v>

1564
01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:04.120
<v Speaker 1>But when you're a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't even hear each other.</v>

1565
01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what actually joel carson was </v>

1566
01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:09.300
<v Speaker 1>saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1567
01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:10.420
<v Speaker 1>it's way easier to teach kids how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like throw.</v>

1568
01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know your,</v>

1569
01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:16.840
<v Speaker 1>your body fucks up when you're a 100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 pounds trying to throw somebody else</v>

1570
01:07:16.841 --> 01:07:17.770
<v Speaker 1>200 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1571
01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:22.800
<v Speaker 1>When you're 40 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you throw in another 40 pound or no one </v>

1572
01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:22.800
<v Speaker 1>gets hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1573
01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Floyd's just as good as they've ever </v>

1574
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.010
<v Speaker 1>been in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In terms of boxing.</v>

1575
01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:29.950
<v Speaker 1>He's got a unique style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't take a lot of damage.</v>

1576
01:07:29.951 --> 01:07:32.500
<v Speaker 1>He's the best defensive boxer of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1577
01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:34.630
<v Speaker 1>In terms of the amount of time that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets hit,</v>

1578
01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:37.570
<v Speaker 1>nobody gets hit less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1579
01:07:37.571 --> 01:07:40.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know much about boxing or </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting at all,</v>

1580
01:07:40.331 --> 01:07:42.080
<v Speaker 1>but the I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

1581
01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean I got to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a freak show.</v>

1582
01:07:44.590 --> 01:07:48.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not a boxing match because connor </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have a lot of boxing matches.</v>

1583
01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:51.640
<v Speaker 1>It's not like we're looking at canelo </v>
<v Speaker 1>alvarez when he was challenging floyd.</v>

1584
01:07:51.641 --> 01:07:53.710
<v Speaker 1>We're going home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think canelo can get to them?</v>

1585
01:07:53.711 --> 01:07:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can go back and look at this fight.</v>

1586
01:07:55.141 --> 01:07:57.030
<v Speaker 1>He did really well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't look at anything.</v>

1587
01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1588
01:07:58.270 --> 01:08:01.180
<v Speaker 1>AnD also look at anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't the wind the stamina?</v>

1589
01:08:01.181 --> 01:08:03.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean like a box or stamina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got to go 12 rounds,</v>

1590
01:08:03.971 --> 01:08:05.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>True she is what,</v>

1591
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:08.110
<v Speaker 1>a five rounds for championship fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right.</v>

1592
01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:13.350
<v Speaker 1>It's five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five minute rounds with kicking and </v>

1593
01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:13.350
<v Speaker 1>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1594
01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Fucking way easier to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three minutes boxing than it is to go </v>

1595
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:20.891
<v Speaker 1>five minutes of mma fucking ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I didn't know that.</v>

1596
01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:23.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm done grappling and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No comparison.</v>

1597
01:08:23.811 --> 01:08:25.670
<v Speaker 1>Now that I've done either one of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>professionally,</v>

1598
01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:31.120
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just telling you as far as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of work that you put out in a </v>

1599
01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.900
<v Speaker 1>three minute round with just using your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands versus wrestling,</v>

1600
01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.810
<v Speaker 1>fighting off submissions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting your legs kicked,</v>

1601
01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:41.200
<v Speaker 1>kicking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things require tremendous </v>

1602
01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:41.200
<v Speaker 1>amounts of energy.</v>

1603
01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.040
<v Speaker 1>I think ufc athletes are some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most conditioned athletes in the world.</v>

1604
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The high level.</v>

1605
01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Like when you get to like a mighty mouse</v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

1606
01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.830
<v Speaker 1>when you know he's that guy can go five </v>
<v Speaker 1>rounds,</v>

1607
01:08:48.831 --> 01:08:50.640
<v Speaker 1>full clip and never get done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guy.</v>

1608
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:55.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean we were talking about that guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows how much he gets hit.</v>

1609
01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Don't nobody hits my new mouse these </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

1610
01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:03.160
<v Speaker 1>He's on such another level right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's already several levels pass mighty </v>

1611
01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:03.680
<v Speaker 1>mouse,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1711

<v Speaker 1>that each guy is operating in is so </v>

1719
01:13:54.721 --> 01:13:56.280
<v Speaker 1>small and it's just two things.</v>

<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one guy's an expert and punching people </v>

1723
01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.541

<v Speaker 1>expert at punching people in the face </v>

1724
01:14:08.541 --> 01:14:11.150

<v Speaker 1>your openings and these like world class</v>

1725
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:17.160
<v Speaker 1>top of the food chain guys are trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>smash each other with their punches and </v>

1726
01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:20.560
<v Speaker 1>that's all they have to rely on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in making sometHing like very limited</v>

1727
01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:25.890
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because I've watched so much </v>

1728
01:14:25.890 --> 01:14:25.890
<v Speaker 1>mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes interesting because I'm like,</v>

1729
01:14:25.890 --> 01:14:30.031
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I don't have to think about leg </v>

1730
01:14:30.031 --> 01:14:30.031
<v Speaker 1>kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to think about takedowns.</v>

1731
01:14:30.031 --> 01:14:30.850
<v Speaker 1>All I have to think about is which guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1732
01:14:30.851 --> 01:14:32.620
<v Speaker 1>like which guy is gonna be able to solve</v>
<v Speaker 1>this puzzle.</v>

1733
01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:35.290
<v Speaker 1>And it's very fascinating to me to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point where people.</v>

1734
01:14:35.410 --> 01:14:37.620
<v Speaker 1>I like fights that people get mad at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they get,</v>

1735
01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:38.600
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fight suck,</v>

1736
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:41.440
<v Speaker 1>excited because they thought it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting or whatever.</v>

1737
01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1738
01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why I've always been a fan </v>

1739
01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:47.220
<v Speaker 1>of floyd mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1740
01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Because of what he's able to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>defensive,</v>

1741
01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:49.150
<v Speaker 1>like nobody can do what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

1742
01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He saId he's an amazing defensive boxer.</v>

1743
01:14:52.301 --> 01:14:56.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean every fighter should watch them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody should learn it.</v>

1744
01:14:56.051 --> 01:14:58.660
<v Speaker 1>Just like how he could stand right in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of you too.</v>

1745
01:14:58.930 --> 01:15:01.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean we stood right in front of guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>just fucking.</v>

1746
01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:04.420
<v Speaker 1>There was a video on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching where the guy was like,</v>

1747
01:15:04.421 --> 01:15:09.421
<v Speaker 1>I want to show you guys that had moved </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'll just make sure you don't want </v>

1748
01:15:09.421 --> 01:15:09.430
<v Speaker 1>to even block,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's how I'll never get hit in the</v>

1749
01:15:09.431 --> 01:15:10.170
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1750
01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:12.250
<v Speaker 1>and he goes up to random people on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street and he's like,</v>

1751
01:15:12.251 --> 01:15:13.650
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that guy.</v>

1752
01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:18.920
<v Speaker 1>It was like go ahead and try to punch me</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like a minute and I'm not going to </v>

1753
01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:18.920
<v Speaker 1>block.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew the guy was like,</v>

1754
01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:23.491
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he just never gets hit in the </v>

1755
01:15:23.491 --> 01:15:23.491
<v Speaker 1>face because you're doing this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>head bop.</v>

1756
01:15:23.491 --> 01:15:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's got to fInd the right guys.</v>

1757
01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's not finding professional </v>

1758
01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:29.920
<v Speaker 1>boxers and you roll up on deontay </v>
<v Speaker 1>wilder.</v>

1759
01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>

1760
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.680
<v Speaker 1>But still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1761
01:15:32.681 --> 01:15:34.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

1762
01:15:34.271 --> 01:15:35.950
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1763
01:15:35.951 --> 01:15:40.951
<v Speaker 1>A guy who could move his head like floyd</v>
<v Speaker 1>mayweather or wassily loma chenko like </v>

1764
01:15:40.951 --> 01:15:41.440
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of guy.</v>

1765
01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:44.830
<v Speaker 1>The guy who can stand right in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you can't hit them.</v>

1766
01:15:44.831 --> 01:15:46.570
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the most terrifying guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>to face.</v>

1767
01:15:46.571 --> 01:15:51.571
<v Speaker 1>Fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't hit them like it's just not </v>

1768
01:15:51.571 --> 01:15:52.690
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he's hitting you all the time.</v>

1769
01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:54.280
<v Speaker 1>He's sending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting frustrated and getting your.</v>

1770
01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:58.970
<v Speaker 1>When you're getting winded or missed a </v>
<v Speaker 1>punch and you realize your spiderweb.</v>

1771
01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're slowly getting lit up.</v>

1772
01:16:01.210 --> 01:16:02.360
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going to be interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

1773
01:16:02.370 --> 01:16:06.730
<v Speaker 1>to see what happens to connor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he does find himself in the web,</v>

1774
01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:12.040
<v Speaker 1>he finds himself in a web,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not he tries to distance </v>

1775
01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:12.820
<v Speaker 1>himself with floyd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>floyd and stay on the outside.</v>

1776
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not he tries to clinch up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them and bullying or whether he </v>

1777
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.610
<v Speaker 1>does something like really confusing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>floyd doesn't expect like it's like his </v>

1778
01:16:21.341 --> 01:16:22.690
<v Speaker 1>coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>john cavanaugh,</v>

1779
01:16:22.691 --> 01:16:25.300
<v Speaker 1>the guy who's coached him in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

1780
01:16:25.301 --> 01:16:29.730
<v Speaker 1>very smart guy and a brilliant tactician</v>
<v Speaker 1>and together their team is.</v>

1781
01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:31.250
<v Speaker 1>I liked their approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>

1782
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:36.270
<v Speaker 1>very unique approach and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things they do is they come up with </v>

1783
01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:39.241
<v Speaker 1>these really unorthodox training </v>
<v Speaker 1>routines because his statement that </v>

1784
01:16:39.241 --> 01:16:43.210
<v Speaker 1>really rings true with me is he says we </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to upgrade the hardware,</v>

1785
01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:45.760
<v Speaker 1>upgrade the software without damaging </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hardware.</v>

1786
01:16:45.790 --> 01:16:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Kevin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1787
01:16:46.121 --> 01:16:51.121
<v Speaker 1>says yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they do a lot of drills instead of </v>

1788
01:16:51.121 --> 01:16:53.251
<v Speaker 1>like constant hard sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that when you do hard </v>

1789
01:16:53.251 --> 01:16:56.431
<v Speaker 1>sparring all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is like it's hard for </v>

1790
01:16:56.431 --> 01:16:59.251
<v Speaker 1>experimentation because punished if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck up and it's hard to download new </v>

1791
01:16:59.951 --> 01:17:00.940
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other,</v>

1792
01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:05.260
<v Speaker 1>the other hand doing things like just </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing drills over and over again,</v>

1793
01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:10.340
<v Speaker 1>it can get kinda boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they come up with all these </v>

1794
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:13.110
<v Speaker 1>innovative cool to incorporate new kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of movements and a lot of it's weird,</v>

1795
01:17:13.191 --> 01:17:18.191
<v Speaker 1>like they throw throw cards at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got this guy throws cards out of </v>

1796
01:17:18.191 --> 01:17:18.191
<v Speaker 1>many punches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cardS.</v>

1797
01:17:18.191 --> 01:17:20.480
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that effective if at all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1798
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:23.780
<v Speaker 1>but it's a freak show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's.</v>

1799
01:17:25.010 --> 01:17:27.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crazy thing is what a fucking connor</v>

1800
01:17:27.531 --> 01:17:28.640
<v Speaker 1>when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1801
01:17:28.770 --> 01:17:31.670
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1802
01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.770
<v Speaker 1>that's like kind of bad for boxing.</v>

1803
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:35.510
<v Speaker 1>So awesome for conor mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1804
01:17:35.511 --> 01:17:40.511
<v Speaker 1>it's great for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's bad for boxing </v>

1805
01:17:40.511 --> 01:17:40.630
<v Speaker 1>because conor mcgregor can box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he really can boxer.</v>

1806
01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:43.410
<v Speaker 1>The question is can he box man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1807
01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:44.030
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1808
01:17:44.031 --> 01:17:44.840
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big difference.</v>

1809
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:48.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conor mcgregor is the biggest star ever.</v>

1810
01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>never if he knocks out.</v>

1811
01:17:50.871 --> 01:17:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Floyd mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the biggest athlete of all time.</v>

1812
01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:56.870
<v Speaker 1>He becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all in europe,</v>

1813
01:17:56.900 --> 01:18:01.900
<v Speaker 1>he becomes the king of europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just give him crowns and they make </v>

1814
01:18:01.971 --> 01:18:05.300
<v Speaker 1>a castle forum as crazy did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he,</v>

1815
01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:10.360
<v Speaker 1>if he knocks out floyd mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is like literally probably the most </v>

1816
01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:11.690
<v Speaker 1>popular athlete of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>HE might surpass like,</v>

1817
01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:14.300
<v Speaker 1>he's like in muhammad ali levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1818
01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:16.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's already.</v>

1819
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think mohammed ali was probably,</v>

1820
01:18:19.670 --> 01:18:22.610
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't our time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he was probably at a totally</v>

1821
01:18:22.611 --> 01:18:27.611
<v Speaker 1>different level because muhammad ali </v>
<v Speaker 1>also represented the civil rights </v>

1822
01:18:27.611 --> 01:18:27.611
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1823
01:18:27.611 --> 01:18:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Represented the bigger than just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance to the Vietnam war.</v>

1824
01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:32.810
<v Speaker 1>He lost his license to fight for three </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1825
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:34.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1826
01:18:34.101 --> 01:18:34.850
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

1827
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:39.710
<v Speaker 1>he's a symbol of a generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>connor is just an amazing fighter,</v>

1828
01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:43.940
<v Speaker 1>so takeaway muhammad ali,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think he's probably on his way,</v>

1829
01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:47.150
<v Speaker 1>but if he loses and he gets embarrassed </v>
<v Speaker 1>by floyd,</v>

1830
01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:49.520
<v Speaker 1>even still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a sport.</v>

1831
01:18:49.770 --> 01:18:52.610
<v Speaker 1>He's got nothing to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's making $100,000,000</v>

1832
01:18:52.611 --> 01:18:53.780
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows?</v>

1833
01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:56.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's a ton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1834
01:18:57.260 --> 01:18:59.690
<v Speaker 1>so many people are gonna be watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could it not be.</v>

1835
01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:02.840
<v Speaker 1>The craziest thing about connor is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>four years ago he,</v>

1836
01:19:02.930 --> 01:19:04.650
<v Speaker 1>nobody knew who the fuck he was.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He was so sucked in for that first </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

1971
01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks like he looks at the on the </v>

1972
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:45.841
<v Speaker 2>top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks like a guy that will like yell </v>

1973
01:24:45.841 --> 01:24:45.841
<v Speaker 2>at you on the street corner like a crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1974
01:24:45.841 --> 01:24:46.690
<v Speaker 2>You're on the bottom of his faces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice and full.</v>

1975
01:24:46.770 --> 01:24:48.070
<v Speaker 2>It looks so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to kill you.</v>

1976
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:50.440
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make a lot of money.</v>

1977
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:52.760
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not he could beat that guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>either way.</v>

1978
01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:55.230
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be fascinating to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be fast,</v>

1979
01:24:55.650 --> 01:25:00.650
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it not to talk about this too </v>

1980
01:25:00.650 --> 01:25:00.650
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't it,</v>

1981
01:25:00.650 --> 01:25:03.280
<v Speaker 2>isn't it like soon to have the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they didn't have time to train.</v>

1982
01:25:03.670 --> 01:25:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is why I think what flOyd wants,</v>

1983
01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:11.440
<v Speaker 2>like floyd was probably in great shape </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think I'm actually.</v>

1984
01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:15.130
<v Speaker 2>It's probably good to do it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they prepared for it for quite a</v>

1985
01:25:15.131 --> 01:25:17.080
<v Speaker 2>long time before they actually committed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

1986
01:25:17.081 --> 01:25:21.610
<v Speaker 2>I hope at least I know he was preparing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't take anY mma fights.</v>

1987
01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:24.880
<v Speaker 2>Didn't even think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This kind of soon though.</v>

1988
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:26.260
<v Speaker 2>August.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just around the corner.</v>

1989
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:28.010
<v Speaker 2>which she wasn't working well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so can't,</v>

1990
01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:31.390
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make so much money if they waited.</v>

1991
01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:32.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1992
01:25:32.441 --> 01:25:35.020
<v Speaker 2>This is such a freak show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it might be playing it,</v>

1993
01:25:35.021 --> 01:25:35.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1994
01:25:35.681 --> 01:25:36.370

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1995
01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:39.700
<v Speaker 2>because this ain't some thing like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna plan out for six months.</v>

1996
01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:41.860
<v Speaker 2>People might lose steam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1997
01:25:41.861 --> 01:25:42.980
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1998
01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:43.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

1999
01:25:43.391 --> 01:25:48.391

2068
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Why does it bother us?</v>

2070
01:28:42.831 --> 01:28:47.831

2071
01:28:47.831 --> 01:28:48.220
<v Speaker 2>could blow a fuse and then you're right </v>

<v Speaker 2>That was the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This face.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like they figured out a way to have the </v>

2098
01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:06.510
<v Speaker 2>perfect amount of masculine but not even</v>

<v Speaker 2>I feel like nice.</v>

2142
01:31:35.731 --> 01:31:37.590

<v Speaker 2>you just get in a boat.</v>

2143
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:40.860
<v Speaker 2>If shit gets rough and I have a load on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your deck,</v>

2144
01:31:41.190 --> 01:31:46.190
<v Speaker 2>like tie it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're just in santa monica or </v>

2145
01:31:46.190 --> 01:31:48.711
<v Speaker 2>like the valley as a tsunami hits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get indexed and you always like </v>

2146
01:31:48.711 --> 01:31:52.380
<v Speaker 2>freeze dried foods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you want to be the guy gets hIt in</v>

2147
01:31:52.381 --> 01:31:57.381
<v Speaker 2>the head by the asteroid or would you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be the guy that has to figure </v>

2148
01:31:57.381 --> 01:32:00.921
<v Speaker 2>out how to rebuild civilization again </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they get hit in the head.</v>

2149
01:32:01.650 --> 01:32:05.340
<v Speaker 2>The nice and quick view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you got to rebuild civilization,</v>

2150
01:32:05.490 --> 01:32:07.390
<v Speaker 2>count how many moving in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many?</v>

2151
01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:08.500
<v Speaker 2>Forty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 people.</v>

2152
01:32:08.770 --> 01:32:09.700
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2153
01:32:09.710 --> 01:32:11.650
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably won't get hit in the head.</v>

2154
01:32:11.651 --> 01:32:13.900
<v Speaker 2>Then you have to fuck your sister in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to make people.</v>

2155
01:32:13.901 --> 01:32:14.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't have one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank god.</v>

2156
01:32:17.050 --> 01:32:22.050
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's just you and your sister and </v>

2157
01:32:22.050 --> 01:32:23.230
<v Speaker 2>you're the only two people that want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get hit and head for sure,</v>

2158
01:32:23.790 --> 01:32:28.790
<v Speaker 2>but if you are alive right now and she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>alive and she wants to stay alive and </v>

2159
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.790
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2160
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:30.340
<v Speaker 2>there's only one way you can make more </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and just have people with that.</v>

2161
01:32:30.370 --> 01:32:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Don't you have kIds with down's syndrome</v>
<v Speaker 2>and shit?</v>

2162
01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:33.540
<v Speaker 2>Not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it takes a while.</v>

2163
01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Takes a few generations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even worse than that,</v>

2164
01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:40.920
<v Speaker 2>you bang each other and then you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bang your kids or the kids have to bang </v>

2165
01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:43.990
<v Speaker 2>after because otherwise that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It stops right there.</v>

2166
01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:49.140
<v Speaker 2>So then it has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to get to a certain point with </v>

2167
01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:52.170
<v Speaker 2>30 or 40 people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's fucking their kids and then </v>

2168
01:32:52.170 --> 01:32:52.170
<v Speaker 2>you have to make new rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2169
01:32:52.170 --> 01:32:53.860
<v Speaker 2>let that planet people who can't fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>your kids.</v>

2170
01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:56.800
<v Speaker 2>And right now your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

2171
01:32:56.801 --> 01:32:59.050
<v Speaker 2>this is how it used to be guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can do it.</v>

2172
01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:00.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when was this?</v>

2173
01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:03.120
<v Speaker 2>Four hundred years ago before the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>rock from the sky.</v>

2174
01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:05.830
<v Speaker 2>Shut off the power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't fill the Wifi,</v>

<v Speaker 2>comedies,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird,</v>

2207
01:34:42.341 --> 01:34:44.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny that like no Matter what else</v>

<v Speaker 2>happened and like coming on her chest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>

2209
01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:52.570
<v Speaker 2>You can have a scene where like you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

2210
01:34:52.571 --> 01:34:57.190
<v Speaker 2>like there's curtains you see is as you </v>

<v Speaker 1>she's kissing.</v>

2213
01:35:00.591 --> 01:35:05.591
<v Speaker 1>but if you actually see a prIus and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vagina or a penis and a mouth or it has </v>

2214

2215
01:35:07.281 --> 01:35:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Even if your penis and vagina is not </v>

<v Speaker 1>her dad.</v>

2222
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:28.310
<v Speaker 1>It's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Netflix will fucking show whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>at the coMedy store.</v>

2230
01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:48.860
<v Speaker 1>I guess once you get ramped up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're doing a special.</v>

2231
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.500
<v Speaker 1>It probably should have done it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was excited.</v>

2232
01:35:54.501 --> 01:35:55.700
<v Speaker 1>I was in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2233
01:35:55.701 --> 01:35:57.530

2234
01:35:58.340 --> 01:36:00.030
<v Speaker 1>There was a french.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>with your breasts out.</v>

2236
01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:08.860
<v Speaker 1>So there was this video that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>released online earlier today of this </v>

2237
01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:12.280
<v Speaker 1>woman activist who was being interviewed</v>
<v Speaker 1>by this guy and she says it's totally </v>

2238
01:36:12.471 --> 01:36:17.270
<v Speaker 1>legal to take your top off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she takes her top off and you know,</v>

2239
01:36:17.271 --> 01:36:19.910
<v Speaker 1>she's a feminist almost immediately </v>
<v Speaker 1>after she takes her top off.</v>

2240
01:36:20.210 --> 01:36:25.210
<v Speaker 1>This dude is black guys think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I have to say black </v>

2241
01:36:25.210 --> 01:36:25.210
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's headed to there.</v>

2242
01:36:25.210 --> 01:36:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Brazen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they hit on,</v>

2243
01:36:25.210 --> 01:36:27.050
<v Speaker 1>girls sneaks behind her and grabbed her </v>
<v Speaker 1>tits.</v>

01:36:27.070 --> 01:36:28.410
<v Speaker 1>No behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2245
01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:33.640
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she screaMs at him and they scream </v>

2246
01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:33.640
<v Speaker 1>at them and they blurred the black guy's</v>
<v Speaker 1>face out,</v>

2247
01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:38.021
<v Speaker 1>whIch is kind of funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't blow the titties outta </v>

2248
01:36:38.021 --> 01:36:38.021

2249
01:36:38.021 --> 01:36:38.021

<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

2250
01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:40.400
<v Speaker 1>That's very racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the black guy's face,</v>

2251
01:36:40.401 --> 01:36:43.970
<v Speaker 1>but not the titties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because whoever doesn't want that guy to</v>

2252
01:36:43.971 --> 01:36:45.860
<v Speaker 1>get implicated in a crime,</v>

01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:55.310
<v Speaker 1>So she's yelling and she takes her top </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

2257
01:36:55.311 --> 01:36:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see your full full breasts.</v>

2258
01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:59.060

<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You do not do that.</v>

2263
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:10.160

<v Speaker 1>they even lose track of him.</v>

2264
01:37:10.190 --> 01:37:13.220
<v Speaker 1>He sort of lingering in the background </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in fighting with each other.</v>

2265
01:37:13.221 --> 01:37:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Now tim,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2268
01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:19.040
<v Speaker 1>he's probably met girls like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

2269
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Next thing you know,</v>

2326
01:39:37.591 --> 01:39:40.470
<v Speaker 2>to let people know you're serious </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you have no shirt on at 5:00</v>

2332
01:39:51.151 --> 01:39:53.360
<v Speaker 2>If someone sees you at 7:30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they assume you just started.</v>

2333

2367
01:41:30.150 --> 01:41:30.640
<v Speaker 2>and every time greg would say something </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny,</v>

2368
01:41:30.670 --> 01:41:33.100
<v Speaker 2>dennis would like mock the fact that he </v>

2370
01:41:34.210 --> 01:41:39.210

<v Speaker 2>It's one of the weirdest interactions </v>

2371
01:41:39.210 --> 01:41:39.210
<v Speaker 2>between two comedians ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very odd.</v>

2372
01:41:39.210 --> 01:41:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Between geraldo and lyric.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2375
01:41:44.311 --> 01:41:45.180

<v Speaker 2>that's weirdly.</v>

2376
01:41:45.230 --> 01:41:47.030
<v Speaker 2>Or we will get yang yang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2377
01:41:47.230 --> 01:41:49.810
<v Speaker 2>Probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has that anymore?</v>

2378
01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:50.890
<v Speaker 2>That show was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2379
01:41:50.891 --> 01:41:52.810
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you do it?</v>

2380
01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:54.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I did it twice.</v>

2381
01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:59.470
<v Speaker 2>It was great fun show colin quinn's </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2382
01:41:59.550 --> 01:42:01.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just a great idea.</v>

2383
01:42:01.821 --> 01:42:04.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's basically like a podcast on </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy central.</v>

2384
01:42:04.230 --> 01:42:05.230
<v Speaker 2>It was before podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2385
01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:08.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean it really was kind of in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways like.</v>

2386
01:42:08.170 --> 01:42:09.660
<v Speaker 2>Well the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the original podcast,</v>

2387
01:42:09.661 --> 01:42:14.661
<v Speaker 2>the stern show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then once the stern show went to </v>

2388
01:42:14.661 --> 01:42:17.251
<v Speaker 2>satellite radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it became an uncensored and then </v>

2389
01:42:17.251 --> 01:42:18.310
<v Speaker 2>opie and anthony sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing,</v>

2390
01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:23.580
<v Speaker 2>but I'll open anthony even more like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast because you just shoot the shit </v>

2391
01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:25.990
<v Speaker 2>and then tough crowd came along and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on comedy central.</v>

2392
01:42:25.991 --> 01:42:27.580
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea why they stopped doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2393
01:42:27.930 --> 01:42:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Must have been a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that was.</v>

2394
01:42:29.250 --> 01:42:30.630
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of short lift.</v>

2395
01:42:30.850 --> 01:42:31.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it?</v>

2396
01:42:31.690 --> 01:42:33.550
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not.</v>

2397
01:42:33.551 --> 01:42:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's a few.</v>

2398
01:42:34.510 --> 01:42:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Maybe was like four or five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colin quinn's and interesting dude,</v>

2399

01:42:57.910 --> 01:43:02.910
<v Speaker 2>he is one of my best examples that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally use when I say you have to </v>

2409
01:43:02.951 --> 01:43:07.951
<v Speaker 2>see someone to stand up in the flash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>live in the flesh to understand how </v>

2410
01:43:07.951 --> 01:43:09.810
<v Speaker 2>funny they're like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of those guys,</v>

2411
01:43:09.811 --> 01:43:12.820
<v Speaker 2>just him because his act is so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so absurd.</v>

2412
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:17.920
<v Speaker 2>It's so silly and odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you almost have to see him live and</v>

2413
01:43:17.921 --> 01:43:20.680
<v Speaker 2>then you want to see a long set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to say like a headline set.</v>

2414
01:43:20.681 --> 01:43:25.681
<v Speaker 2>We see it filled up and get weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he got a lot of attention for the </v>

2415
01:43:25.681 --> 01:43:25.681
<v Speaker 2>last specialty you did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2416
01:43:25.870 --> 01:43:26.580
<v Speaker 2>He's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2417
01:43:26.590 --> 01:43:28.510
<v Speaker 2>It's a funny fucking dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's always been funny,</v>

2418
01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:31.510
<v Speaker 2>but that show was a great show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long was it on for jamie?</v>

2419
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:34.120
<v Speaker 2>Over?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just under two years to see.</v>

2420
01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would've thought it was like four </v>

2421
01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:40.140
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2422
01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:40.750
<v Speaker 2>That'd be a cool show to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2423
01:43:40.751 --> 01:43:42.730
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a wikipedia and that?</v>

2424
01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:46.000
<v Speaker 2>She must've been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is it not a hit?</v>

2425
01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was just too many shows back </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

2426
01:43:48.401 --> 01:43:49.940
<v Speaker 2>They were like a lot of shows though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2427
01:43:50.270 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 2>and like pits too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

2428
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:54.320
<v Speaker 1>feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess there's more shows now than ever</v>

2429
01:43:54.321 --> 01:43:54.800
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2430
01:43:54.860 --> 01:43:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only because of probably the </v>

2431
01:43:59.860 --> 01:43:59.860
<v Speaker 1>internet and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's too many channels.</v>

2432
01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Like when you found out something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not true tv,</v>

2433
01:44:01.431 --> 01:44:02.240
<v Speaker 1>like wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2434
01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is that right?</v>

2435
01:44:03.471 --> 01:44:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2436
01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:05.090
<v Speaker 1>How do we even find them in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2437
01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:07.560
<v Speaker 1>What is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tv land channel.</v>

2438
01:44:07.630 --> 01:44:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you watch tv?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't watch netflix and hbo.</v>

2439
01:44:12.030 --> 01:44:14.870
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And occasionally I watch hunting shows.</v>

2440
01:44:15.170 --> 01:44:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we got here?</v>

2441
01:44:16.101 --> 01:44:17.910
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it say why it,</v>

2442
01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:22.930
<v Speaker 1>why it ended up notes from comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>central at the same time the chappelle </v>

2443
01:44:22.930 --> 01:44:22.930
<v Speaker 1>show was on and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2444
01:44:22.930 --> 01:44:24.750
<v Speaker 1>no demographic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2445
01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they fucked it up.</v>

2446
01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:28.940
<v Speaker 1>The executives fucked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How we went and wrote a blog about it.</v>

2447
01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2448
01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Executive fucked it up.</v>

2449
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:37.810
<v Speaker 1>The last show contained a monologue by </v>
<v Speaker 1>quinn's who attacked his distractors,</v>

2450
01:44:38.410 --> 01:44:43.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as the New York times for being </v>

2451
01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:43.670
<v Speaker 1>hypocritical and elitist for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative reviews.</v>

2452
01:44:43.670 --> 01:44:48.670
<v Speaker 1>He also defined comedic integrity is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to critique the hypocrisy of </v>

2453
01:44:49.011 --> 01:44:54.011
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to be honest enough to admit that </v>

2454
01:44:54.011 --> 01:44:57.170
<v Speaker 1>you are just as guilty of it as anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

2455
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they fucked up.</v>

2456
01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:05.010
<v Speaker 1>That was a great show and it could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been an amazing show,</v>

2457
01:45:05.011 --> 01:45:06.230
<v Speaker 1>but they just bring it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring it back.</v>

2458
01:45:06.231 --> 01:45:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Comedy central.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to hit cancel the show.</v>

2459
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:14.350
<v Speaker 1>And also also you can just make a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he probably didn't want to do it </v>

2460
01:45:14.350 --> 01:45:14.350
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

2461
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Well it's just weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like got rid of moshe kasher shaw </v>

2462
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.510
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

2463
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:23.630
<v Speaker 1>I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might have fucking jumped the gun on </v>

2464
01:45:23.630 --> 01:45:23.630
<v Speaker 1>that one too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think actually,</v>

2465
01:45:23.630 --> 01:45:24.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I think.</v>

2466
01:45:24.111 --> 01:45:26.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like somebody else's show</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that exec,</v>

2467
01:45:27.290 --> 01:45:30.260
<v Speaker 1>whoever was running things is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2468
01:45:30.261 --> 01:45:31.880
<v Speaker 1>That shIt is be talking shit.</v>

2469
01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:33.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about show </v>
<v Speaker 1>business anymore.</v>

2470
01:45:33.921 --> 01:45:37.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm barely in show business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a non showbiz entity.</v>

2471
01:45:37.460 --> 01:45:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what's going on except of</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting fired from comedy central with </v>

2472
01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:43.890
<v Speaker 1>the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story telling you.</v>

2473
01:45:45.310 --> 01:45:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2474
01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:48.860
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely not nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying.</v>

2475
01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Did you do that show you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2476
01:45:50.980 --> 01:45:51.890
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not happening.</v>

2477
01:45:51.891 --> 01:45:53.870
<v Speaker 1>He always asks me to do it and I always </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do it,</v>

2478
01:45:53.871 --> 01:45:56.630
<v Speaker 1>but I never had a story that fit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>theme and then I was just like,</v>

2479
01:45:56.660 --> 01:45:58.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to do it and I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>never ended up doing it.</v>

2480
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.620
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a great.</v>

2481
01:46:00.621 --> 01:46:02.930
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a great fucking awesome </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

2482
01:46:03.010 --> 01:46:05.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a show designed for joey diaz.</v>

2483
01:46:05.810 --> 01:46:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because joey diaz has more stories than </v>

2484
01:46:10.810 --> 01:46:10.810
<v Speaker 1>any human being that's ever walked the </v>
<v Speaker 1>face of the planet.</v>

2485
01:46:10.810 --> 01:46:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2487
01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:16.240
<v Speaker 1>He is out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2490
01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:22.470
<v Speaker 1>the brazen attempt to craft a new hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2491
01:46:23.410 --> 01:46:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2492
01:46:23.931 --> 01:46:28.931
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you start a new one and then it's </v>

2493
01:46:28.931 --> 01:46:28.931
<v Speaker 1>like I have like 25 new minutes and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2494
01:46:28.931 --> 01:46:30.620
<v Speaker 1>is this stuff really though going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my hour?</v>

2495
01:46:30.621 --> 01:46:32.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You don't even know gettIng,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>

2497
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:37.760
<v Speaker 1>Do you write down physically do right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Physically never.</v>

2498
01:46:37.761 --> 01:46:40.490
<v Speaker 1>And I know it's a good idea to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2499
01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:41.240
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2500
01:46:41.570 --> 01:46:46.570
<v Speaker 1>it's so much less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so much more work for me to know </v>

2501
01:46:46.570 --> 01:46:49.560
<v Speaker 1>what I'm going to say and get up there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it</v>

2502
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:55.070
<v Speaker 2>than it is to go up with an idea and </v>
<v Speaker 2>work it out on stage and I have so much </v>

2503
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.330
<v Speaker 2>more fun doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2504
01:46:57.260 --> 01:46:58.380
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for me,</v>

2505
01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:00.060
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2506
01:47:00.850 --> 01:47:02.940
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like am able to,</v>

2507
01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:08.060
<v Speaker 2>not to get too heady but like explore </v>
<v Speaker 2>that bit way more onstage because I </v>

2508
01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:11.070
<v Speaker 2>fucking have to in that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're trapped.</v>

2509
01:47:11.071 --> 01:47:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's 250 people there for seven.</v>

2510
01:47:13.981 --> 01:47:15.210
<v Speaker 2>Even if there's a few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

2511
01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:17.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2512
01:47:17.310 --> 01:47:19.030
<v Speaker 2>I just liked doing that and that's how I</v>
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

2513
01:47:19.031 --> 01:47:21.120
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get like I have really long bits,</v>

2514
01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:22.990
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's how,</v>

2515
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:25.050
<v Speaker 2>that's how that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people do.</v>

2516
01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:30.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean everyBody's got their own style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the only thing that's really </v>

2517
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:31.770
<v Speaker 2>consistent is that you need to pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to it.</v>

2518
01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:33.670
<v Speaker 2>You can do like really focused on stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

2519
01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:34.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only thing.</v>

2520
01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:39.980
<v Speaker 2>That's really how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like whether you do it like in your car </v>

2521
01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:43.911
<v Speaker 2>while you're driving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shut the radio off and just think </v>

2522
01:47:43.911 --> 01:47:46.251
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But whether you do it in front of a </v>

2523
01:47:46.251 --> 01:47:46.251
<v Speaker 2>computer or whether you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2524
01:47:46.251 --> 01:47:47.040
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you do or you do a lot of sets,</v>

2525
01:47:47.041 --> 01:47:49.980
<v Speaker 2>you do a set of the improv instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the store and the set of the factory.</v>

2526
01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:53.100
<v Speaker 2>It's all just about how much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much energy,</v>

2527
01:47:53.670 --> 01:47:55.320
<v Speaker 2>how much focus put on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2528
01:47:55.321 --> 01:47:56.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you think about it,</v>

2529
01:47:56.221 --> 01:48:01.221
<v Speaker 2>really the only time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of time that you're actually </v>

2530
01:48:01.221 --> 01:48:01.221
<v Speaker 2>doing standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2531
01:48:01.221 --> 01:48:02.880
<v Speaker 2>An hour and a half at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you doing two sets a night,</v>

2532
01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:04.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why weekends are so good.</v>

2533
01:48:04.561 --> 01:48:06.340
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to do two on friday,</v>

2534
01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:08.530
<v Speaker 2>two on saturday and do an improv </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere or something.</v>

2535
01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:12.210
<v Speaker 2>But then like I came up with a new bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>two weeks ago.</v>

2536
01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:15.500
<v Speaker 2>That's like a six minute bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh and,</v>

2537
01:48:15.690 --> 01:48:16.290

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2538
01:48:16.291 --> 01:48:21.291
<v Speaker 2>it's fun finding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know something happened and now I'm </v>

2539
01:48:21.291 --> 01:48:23.940
<v Speaker 2>talking about us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The universe opened up an idea for you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Investigation fetish.</v>

2637
01:52:07.810 --> 01:52:09.580
<v Speaker 2>The only ones I like are the forensic </v>
<v Speaker 2>files,</v>

2638
01:52:09.581 --> 01:52:11.730
<v Speaker 2>the ones where they reenact it and they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they show.</v>

2639
01:52:11.870 --> 01:52:13.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are real stories.</v>

2640
01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:18.240
<v Speaker 2>I watched so many of those when marvin </v>
<v Speaker 2>hutchinson came home early evening to </v>

2641
01:52:19.541 --> 01:52:22.720
<v Speaker 2>find his girlfriend in bed with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>brother.</v>

2642
01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:27.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just always arrest the spouse because </v>

2643
01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:28.240
<v Speaker 2>it's them always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they always go to like the,</v>

2644
01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:32.740
<v Speaker 2>the most extreme lengths where it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>just arrest that person and then check.</v>

2645
01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:35.530
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's the creepy guy at work </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's in love with a woman,</v>

2646
01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:37.930
<v Speaker 2>but very rarely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2647
01:52:37.931 --> 01:52:38.950
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2648
01:52:38.951 --> 01:52:40.990
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those,</v>

2649
01:52:40.991 --> 01:52:43.030
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched so much forensic because by</v>

2650
01:52:43.031 --> 01:52:45.890
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're on the road hln the network,</v>

2651
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:48.450

<v Speaker 2>And then nancy grace for an hour.</v>

2653
01:52:50.210 --> 01:52:51.920

<v Speaker 2>Headline news.</v>

2654
01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:53.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

2655
01:52:53.451 --> 01:52:58.451
<v Speaker 2>Is that what that stands for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they give up on whatever this </v>

2656
01:52:58.451 --> 01:52:58.451
<v Speaker 2>format is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like country music,</v>

2657
01:52:58.451 --> 01:53:02.501
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do fucking drag races </v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give josh wolfe a show.</v>

2663
01:53:10.650 --> 01:53:13.180
<v Speaker 2>But he's not a country guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2664
01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:18.260
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched so much of that that all </v>

2665
01:53:18.260 --> 01:53:18.530
<v Speaker 2>see the same murder on the different </v>
<v Speaker 2>episodes,</v>

2666
01:53:18.531 --> 01:53:23.531
<v Speaker 2>like forensic files.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll do it and then I'll be watching </v>

2667
01:53:23.531 --> 01:53:23.531
<v Speaker 2>snap and I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2668
01:53:23.531 --> 01:53:23.531
<v Speaker 2>I saw this one on forensic files.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll get different reason.</v>

2669
01:53:23.531 --> 01:53:25.850
<v Speaker 2>They all have their own reenactment of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because it's the new.</v>

2670
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Because this topic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2671
01:53:27.170 --> 01:53:29.000
<v Speaker 2>it's not their subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like they wrote it.</v>

2672
01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2673
01:53:29.841 --> 01:53:32.600
<v Speaker 2>They have to allow another guy to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>another recreation.</v>

2674
01:53:32.930 --> 01:53:37.930
<v Speaker 2>They probably cheat like gold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what'd you get some of your </v>

2675
01:53:37.930 --> 01:53:38.030
<v Speaker 2>footage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2676
01:53:38.090 --> 01:53:39.940
<v Speaker 2>they did that with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the angle they,</v>

2677
01:53:40.020 --> 01:53:41.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show the murder.</v>

2678
01:53:41.210 --> 01:53:44.390
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a really good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a really good one on,</v>

2679
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:47.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what child part of the id </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel,</v>

2680
01:53:47.990 --> 01:53:52.990
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see no evil and they go through like </v>

2681
01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:53.670
<v Speaker 2>with forensic files,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all they do is um,</v>

2682
01:53:54.240 --> 01:53:59.240
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they work out who did the crime with </v>

2683
01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:01.301
<v Speaker 2>forensics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on this one they find out who did </v>

2684
01:54:01.301 --> 01:54:01.301
<v Speaker 2>the crime only using the security </v>
<v Speaker 2>footage.</v>

2685
01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:06.520
<v Speaker 2>And it's really creepy and really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting because like you'll see a </v>

2686
01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:10.421
<v Speaker 2>guy walk into the elevator and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave with a briefcase and shit or like </v>

2687
01:54:10.421 --> 01:54:11.120
<v Speaker 2>a suitcase and the bodies in there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

2688
01:54:11.150 --> 01:54:16.150
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really great because it's real </v>

2689
01:54:16.150 --> 01:54:16.150
<v Speaker 2>footage.</v>

2690
01:54:16.150 --> 01:54:17.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See no evil when you see a real body,</v>

2691
01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:21.590
<v Speaker 2>even if it's through a security camera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so clubs somebody over the head and drag</v>

2692
01:54:21.591 --> 01:54:22.470
<v Speaker 2>them backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2693
01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:24.870
<v Speaker 2>whew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a real body man.</v>

2694
01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Like what I don't understand is I like </v>
<v Speaker 2>heat of the moment.</v>

2695
01:54:30.741 --> 01:54:35.741
<v Speaker 2>Murderers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I can wrap my head around </v>

2696
01:54:35.741 --> 01:54:35.750
<v Speaker 2>because it's like you just got so mad at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person and it happened,</v>

2697
01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:39.320
<v Speaker 2>but like to plan it and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and think,</v>

2698
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:44.470
<v Speaker 2>oh good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make 20 grand off this or </v>

2699
01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:46.631
<v Speaker 2>the for the life insurance and to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get caught is like </v>

2700
01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:50.020
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get caught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2701
01:54:50.090 --> 01:54:52.190
<v Speaker 2>People get caught,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people are stupid as fuck.</v>

2702
01:54:52.191 --> 01:54:57.191
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people out there that </v>

2703
01:54:57.191 --> 01:54:59.180
<v Speaker 2>lie so much that they don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection to reality.</v>

2704
01:54:59.190 --> 01:55:04.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've severed their tether to reality </v>

2705
01:55:04.190 --> 01:55:07.510
<v Speaker 2>so they think they can bullshit people </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time and they think that they </v>

2706
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:09.590
<v Speaker 2>can sort of con artists people all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2707
01:55:09.590 --> 01:55:10.880
<v Speaker 2>I knew a guy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian kelly.</v>

2708
01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:11.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kidding.</v>

2709
01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:12.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm kidding with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm completely crazy.</v>

2710
01:55:13.460 --> 01:55:16.580
<v Speaker 2>This guy was a fake brazilian jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>black belt.</v>

2711
01:55:16.930 --> 01:55:19.630
<v Speaker 2>What have been fake fake wasn't really a</v>

<v Speaker 2>Told everybody he was.</v>

<v Speaker 2>a lot of them,</v>

2714

<v Speaker 1>So check this out.</v>

2770
01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:53.730

<v Speaker 1>gerald,</v>

2771
01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:57.690
<v Speaker 1>my friend gerald,</v>

2772
01:57:57.691 --> 01:58:00.960
<v Speaker 1>against him that he tried to pay him to </v>
<v Speaker 1>murder them.</v>

2773
01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to him about it on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone and the phone was being tapped.</v>

2774
01:58:05.610 --> 01:58:07.890
<v Speaker 1>So then the cops called me up and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

2775
01:58:07.891 --> 01:58:09.510
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you know about this?</v>

2776
01:58:09.710 --> 01:58:10.740
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you everything,</v>

2777
01:58:10.741 --> 01:58:15.741
<v Speaker 1>I don't know shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he'd already been arrested and it </v>

2778
01:58:15.741 --> 01:58:15.741
<v Speaker 1>was already like a thing where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to trial,</v>

2779
01:58:15.870 --> 01:58:20.870
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I know is that he was a fake black </v>

2780
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:23.001
<v Speaker 1>belt who lied about a lot of shit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>god at the time I didn't even know </v>

2781
01:58:23.001 --> 01:58:23.430
<v Speaker 1>whether or not he really killed the guy.</v>

2782
01:58:23.710 --> 01:58:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So full of shit.</v>

2783
01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:28.590
<v Speaker 1>If he told You that he killed his wife's</v>
<v Speaker 1>husband,</v>

2784
01:58:28.591 --> 01:58:30.460
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2785
01:58:30.570 --> 01:58:33.800
<v Speaker 1>just like you won the karate kuma tay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like you're a brazilian black belt.</v>

2786
01:58:33.810 --> 01:58:35.370
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to tell with a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2787
01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:39.780
<v Speaker 1>But then to do turned out to present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty much never can somebody who </v>

2789
01:58:44.781 --> 01:58:44.781
<v Speaker 1>brings a trophy out of the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2790
01:58:44.781 --> 01:58:47.680
<v Speaker 1>can you imagine the idea that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to take this fucking duffle bag,</v>

2791
01:58:47.681 --> 01:58:52.681
<v Speaker 1>put a trophy inside of it and no one's </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna notice when you jump back to the </v>

2792
01:58:52.681 --> 01:58:53.170
<v Speaker 1>duffle bags missed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really funny.</v>

2793
01:58:53.950 --> 01:58:57.710
<v Speaker 1>It was this big map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's shaped like a trophy.</v>

2794
01:58:58.070 --> 01:59:00.460
<v Speaker 1>She the fucking fence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the rocky statue,</v>

2795
01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:03.850
<v Speaker 1>this fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2796
01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:06.130
<v Speaker 1>But there was a lot of that back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2797
01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:09.430
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of fake martial artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like super common.</v>

2798
01:59:09.610 --> 01:59:14.610
<v Speaker 1>They still to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll catch a guy who's a fake black </v>

2799
01:59:14.610 --> 01:59:14.610
<v Speaker 1>belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2800
01:59:14.610 --> 01:59:15.010
<v Speaker 1>White belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like put a black belt on and go to a new</v>

2801
01:59:15.011 --> 01:59:16.390
<v Speaker 1>school and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he really doesn't know anything.</v>

2802
01:59:16.391 --> 01:59:18.100
<v Speaker 1>I can't go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're going to get exposed.</v>

2803
01:59:18.130 --> 01:59:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In jujitsu?</v>

2804
01:59:19.511 --> 01:59:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in other martial arts?</v>

2805
01:59:20.921 --> 01:59:22.360
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because they're mentally ill.</v>

2806
01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:23.620
<v Speaker 1>It's alwaYs because they're mentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>ill.</v>

2807
01:59:24.070 --> 01:59:26.890
<v Speaker 1>And this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rafael torres actually had a fake fight.</v>

2808
01:59:27.070 --> 01:59:32.070
<v Speaker 1>He had a fixed fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm king of the cage with one of his </v>

2809
01:59:32.070 --> 01:59:35.011
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he actually had a professional mma </v>

2810
01:59:35.011 --> 01:59:37.771
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know how my friend eddie knew </v>

2811
01:59:37.771 --> 01:59:37.771
<v Speaker 1>that he was full of shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2812
01:59:37.771 --> 01:59:41.190
<v Speaker 1>any new associate because eddie taught </v>
<v Speaker 1>them this super complicated move called </v>

2813
01:59:41.190 --> 01:59:45.991
<v Speaker 1>the twister twister is eddie's signature</v>
<v Speaker 1>move and it's basically the guillotine </v>

2814
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:49.470
<v Speaker 1>or the guillotine from wrestling with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2815
01:59:49.710 --> 01:59:52.200
<v Speaker 1>an added,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of added twist in the way.</v>

2816
01:59:52.210 --> 01:59:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Secure as the finish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie has like a very specific way of </v>

2817
01:59:57.210 --> 02:00:00.120
<v Speaker 1>escripting the top of the head and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>locking down the opposite pharcyde leg.</v>

2818
02:00:00.730 --> 02:00:05.730
<v Speaker 1>So when he does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a terrible position to be and </v>

2819
02:00:05.730 --> 02:00:08.491
<v Speaker 1>he's crushing your fucking neck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting all yanked up and it's </v>

2820
02:00:08.491 --> 02:00:11.491
<v Speaker 1>really rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to deal with and it's </v>

2821
02:00:11.491 --> 02:00:12.580
<v Speaker 1>hard to pull off on people super hard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull off,</v>

2822
02:00:12.910 --> 02:00:16.190
<v Speaker 1>like to just even to set it up and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>to roll into it you have to be a,</v>

2823
02:00:16.450 --> 02:00:20.170
<v Speaker 1>you could get a brazilian jiu jitsu </v>
<v Speaker 1>black belt who's a high level black belt</v>

2824
02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:25.320
<v Speaker 1>and you could teach them how to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could probably pull it off on </v>

2825
02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:27.661
<v Speaker 1>someone just because you understand how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to move his body and the grappling </v>

2826
02:00:27.661 --> 02:00:27.661
<v Speaker 1>scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for a guy like him,</v>

2827
02:00:27.661 --> 02:00:28.330
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't really a black male was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

2828
02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:29.200
<v Speaker 1>really clunky.</v>

2829
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>he went to Thailand and and fought in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some mma fighters.</v>

2830
02:00:32.491 --> 02:00:33.460
<v Speaker 1>That dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

2831
02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>one in Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pulled off the twister and eddie hung </v>

2832
02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>up the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2833
02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:39.220
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2834
02:00:39.970 --> 02:00:41.650
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2835
02:00:41.651 --> 02:00:46.651
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think something's got to be full of </v>

2836
02:00:46.651 --> 02:00:49.231
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was high as fuck what we're </v>

2837
02:00:49.231 --> 02:00:49.231
<v Speaker 1>saying having this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2838
02:00:49.231 --> 02:00:49.231
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

2839
02:00:49.231 --> 02:00:52.330
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell me he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe he did that and so I was</v>

2840
02:00:52.331 --> 02:00:57.331
<v Speaker 1>with eddie in the car when he confronted</v>
<v Speaker 1>him about being a fake black belt.</v>

2841
02:00:59.590 --> 02:01:01.330
<v Speaker 1>He confronted the three of you in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>car?</v>

2842
02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:02.710
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eddie was on the phone.</v>

2843
02:01:02.711 --> 02:01:07.711
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was driving and eddie was right next </v>

2844
02:01:07.711 --> 02:01:12.061
<v Speaker 1>to me in the passenger seat and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>confronting him about it and the guy,</v>

2845
02:01:14.510 --> 02:01:15.340
<v Speaker 1>the guy was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I really am.</v>

2847
02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:21.580

<v Speaker 1>the dudes in jail for murder.</v>

2848

<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

2864

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just like,</v>

2865

<v Speaker 1>It's really funny man.</v>

2866
02:01:56.120 --> 02:02:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Like these guys are acting here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he hits him with a couple of </v>

2867
02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:01.910
<v Speaker 1>punches but not hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2869
02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:09.910
<v Speaker 1>So he takes him down steps over the leg </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the guy's punching them.</v>

2870
02:02:10.130 --> 02:02:12.110
<v Speaker 1>But I think these are nothing punches </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2871
02:02:12.170 --> 02:02:14.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like nothing to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

2872
02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:15.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a fact this was.</v>

2873
02:02:15.330 --> 02:02:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

2874
02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2875
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:18.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows this is like,</v>

2876
02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:22.340
<v Speaker 1>they tried to make it what we would call</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hard shoot,</v>

2877
02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:27.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you make it look real like pro </v>

2878
02:02:27.700 --> 02:02:27.700
<v Speaker 1>wrestling style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then he just drops down,</v>

2879
02:02:27.700 --> 02:02:29.420
<v Speaker 1>it gets out leg and he's tapping these </v>
<v Speaker 1>tap in like right away,</v>

2880
02:02:29.670 --> 02:02:34.670
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back up a little sick and see the </v>

2881
02:02:34.670 --> 02:02:34.670
<v Speaker 1>setup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's set up is like what?</v>

2882
02:02:34.670 --> 02:02:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Like here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just grabs it.</v>

2883
02:02:35.300 --> 02:02:37.460
<v Speaker 1>That is so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so bad.</v>

2884
02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:41.090
<v Speaker 1>He's so high up on the knee that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't even be putting pressure on the</v>

2885
02:02:41.091 --> 02:02:44.060
<v Speaker 1>knee because he's not controlling the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lower leg or the upper leg.</v>

2886
02:02:44.061 --> 02:02:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's pulling on the lower leg,</v>

2887
02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:48.800
<v Speaker 1>but watch that again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when he's pulling on the upper leg,</v>

2888
02:02:48.830 --> 02:02:49.820
<v Speaker 1>look at the gap.</v>

2889
02:02:50.100 --> 02:02:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Watch when he goes out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could tell he's not a black belt </v>

2890
02:02:55.100 --> 02:02:55.100
<v Speaker 1>doing no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2891
02:02:55.100 --> 02:02:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Super sloppy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big,</v>

2892
02:02:55.100 --> 02:02:59.780
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big giant gap and see where he's </v>

2893
02:02:59.780 --> 02:02:59.780
<v Speaker 1>yanking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dude's already tapping.</v>

2894
02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:01.400
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have control of the upper leg</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

2895
02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:05.860
<v Speaker 1>He's just pulling on the shin like </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally his ass is with the knee is in</v>

2896
02:03:05.861 --> 02:03:06.890
<v Speaker 1>his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's pulling on the shin,</v>

2897
02:03:06.891 --> 02:03:08.750
<v Speaker 1>which means you wouldn't be putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure on the knee.</v>

2898
02:03:09.170 --> 02:03:11.600
<v Speaker 1>It's such horseshit and it's guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god.</v>

2899
02:03:11.601 --> 02:03:15.260
<v Speaker 1>He wrecked my knee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a total fake fight.</v>

2900
02:03:15.810 --> 02:03:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that guy went on to be a murderer.</v>

2901
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I think he might be up for parole soon </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

2902
02:03:22.060 --> 02:03:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Do it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's the crazy thing.</v>

2904
02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>People get out of jail for murder to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to jail for murder and you're in the </v>

2905
02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>back by the way.</v>

2917
02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:55.550
<v Speaker 1>people trying to concoct an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>

<v Speaker 1>afraid of being nothing.</v>

2920
02:04:08.241 --> 02:04:13.241
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that it or does he identify with a </v>

<v Speaker 1>brazilian jiu jitsu black belt?</v>

2922

<v Speaker 1>How much different is that than identify</v>

2923

<v Speaker 1>I might not trust you.</v>

2928
02:04:33.370 --> 02:04:38.370

<v Speaker 1>questions like he has adopted mommy and </v>

2929
02:04:38.370 --> 02:04:38.370

<v Speaker 1>and he's a comedian.</v>

2944

<v Speaker 1>He actually can draw the outlines of </v>
<v Speaker 1>each state.</v>

2949

<v Speaker 1>draws the United States and the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>shape,</v>

2954
02:05:33.031 --> 02:05:36.180

<v Speaker 1>to be the map maker.</v>

<v Speaker 1>size and shape and he does this all By </v>

2965
02:05:59.811 --> 02:06:03.150
<v Speaker 1>hand seat because a lot of people think </v>
<v Speaker 1>of al franken as you know,</v>

2966
02:06:03.151 --> 02:06:06.180
<v Speaker 1>he was a comedian and he's on saturday </v>
<v Speaker 1>night live people.</v>

2967
02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they truly appreciate his,</v>

2968
02:06:08.810 --> 02:06:11.160
<v Speaker 1>his intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a brilliaNt guy,</v>

2969
02:06:11.400 --> 02:06:16.400
<v Speaker 1>but he's also to self deprecating and </v>
<v Speaker 1>too wise,</v>

2970
02:06:17.100 --> 02:06:21.180
<v Speaker 1>too humble to want to be the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just doesN't have that desire in him.</v>

2971
02:06:21.430 --> 02:06:24.840
<v Speaker 1>That's such a shame because to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

2972
02:06:24.841 --> 02:06:28.500
<v Speaker 1>like you almost have to be the type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who would never.</v>

2973
02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Who should never be president in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to run?</v>

2974
02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2975
02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:38.180

<v Speaker 1>But like if he wanted to be the </v>

2976
02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:41.721
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he could be like our best </v>

2977
02:06:41.721 --> 02:06:42.630
<v Speaker 1>president ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck else could do this?</v>

2978
02:06:42.990 --> 02:06:45.870
<v Speaker 1>You want to talk about patriotism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking guy.</v>

2979
02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a good thing to run on.</v>

2980
02:06:48.121 --> 02:06:50.190
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could draw the pitch.</v>

2981
02:06:50.250 --> 02:06:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Hey Donald Trump draw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's crazy though.</v>

2982
02:06:53.291 --> 02:06:58.291
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He must have practiced this or he's got </v>

2983
02:06:58.291 --> 02:06:58.291
<v Speaker 1>to have a crazy mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just like.</v>

2984
02:06:58.291 --> 02:06:58.291
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2985
02:06:58.291 --> 02:06:59.880
<v Speaker 1>He just drew Alaska son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he comes Hawaii.</v>

2986
02:07:00.060 --> 02:07:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you crazy?</v>

2987
02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:05.730
<v Speaker 1>back that up to the 2009,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Minnesota state fair.</v>

2988
02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:06.900
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he loses points.</v>

2989
02:07:06.901 --> 02:07:09.440
<v Speaker 1>We're going to the Minnesota state fair.</v>

2990
02:07:11.970 --> 02:07:13.780
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2991
02:07:14.610 --> 02:07:19.610
<v Speaker 1>but also my views is that if I was to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a billion but it probably has a </v>

2992
02:07:20.050 --> 02:07:20.940
<v Speaker 1>million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2 million,</v>

2993
02:07:20.941 --> 02:07:23.140
<v Speaker 1>$300,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more than one video.</v>

2994
02:07:23.210 --> 02:07:24.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He it,</v>

2995
02:07:24.790 --> 02:07:25.790
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't like a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2996
02:07:25.791 --> 02:07:30.791
<v Speaker 1>so it's a lot of tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool parlor trick and he gets pushed </v>

2997
02:07:30.791 --> 02:07:32.760
<v Speaker 1>here for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably drives it all up,</v>

2998
02:07:32.761 --> 02:07:34.690
<v Speaker 1>but then this one is on me to draw </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

2999
02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:36.150
<v Speaker 1>I have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3000
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:37.990
<v Speaker 1>he's doing this one on a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cardboard.</v>

3001
02:07:38.010 --> 02:07:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do it on any surface.</v>

3002
02:07:39.910 --> 02:07:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

3003
02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:42.640
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he does it on the sidewalk </v>
<v Speaker 1>with chalk.</v>

3004
02:07:43.480 --> 02:07:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Can you do it in the sand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would be.</v>

3005
02:07:48.550 --> 02:07:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

3006
02:07:49.330 --> 02:07:52.030
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We definitely need a better president.</v>

3007
02:07:52.750 --> 02:07:54.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we definitely need something new.</v>

3008
02:07:55.350 --> 02:07:55.920
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3009
02:07:56.330 --> 02:07:58.260
<v Speaker 1>this system we've got going on right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

3010
02:07:58.320 --> 02:08:00.570
<v Speaker 1>just everybody hates each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a bad thing.</v>

3011
02:08:00.600 --> 02:08:05.600
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody on the left and everybody in </v>

3012
02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:05.600
<v Speaker 1>the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's at each other's throats.</v>

3013
02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:07.320
<v Speaker 1>I used to think it was the right that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the dangerous,</v>

3014
02:08:07.340 --> 02:08:12.340
<v Speaker 1>but now the left is so they're so mad </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit and they're responding to the </v>

3015
02:08:12.340 --> 02:08:13.180
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes this way.</v>

3016
02:08:13.181 --> 02:08:14.650
<v Speaker 1>And then it goes that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3017
02:08:14.651 --> 02:08:17.710
<v Speaker 1>people get super fucking angry when </v>
<v Speaker 1>obama's,</v>

3018
02:08:17.711 --> 02:08:22.711
<v Speaker 1>the president as the right you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>worry about and then try it comes the </v>

3019
02:08:22.711 --> 02:08:25.591
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets super aggressive on the </v>

3020
02:08:25.591 --> 02:08:25.591
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting is they said that gun</v>

3021
02:08:25.591 --> 02:08:27.520
<v Speaker 1>sales go up when a democratic president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they get scared.</v>

3022
02:08:27.970 --> 02:08:29.470
<v Speaker 1>People get scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to take your guns.</v>

3023
02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:31.900
<v Speaker 1>What's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as trump was a lifelong democrat,</v>

3024
02:08:32.260 --> 02:08:37.260
<v Speaker 1>I know life long democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if anybody's ever had like the back </v>

3025
02:08:37.260 --> 02:08:38.000
<v Speaker 1>of gun owners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3026
02:08:38.260 --> 02:08:41.950
<v Speaker 1>trump above all a lot because his sons </v>
<v Speaker 1>sons are hunters,</v>

3027
02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:45.970
<v Speaker 1>especially donald jr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big time sportsmen.</v>

3028
02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Conservationists very much into animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunts a lot.</v>

3029
02:08:50.590 --> 02:08:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Like legitimately he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3030
02:08:52.260 --> 02:08:54.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a respected hunter.</v>

3031
02:08:55.930 --> 02:08:58.060
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

3032
02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:01.930
<v Speaker 1>the doesn't shock me that people buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>more guns,</v>

3033
02:09:02.850 --> 02:09:04.240
<v Speaker 1>but I guess I didn't think of it like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3034
02:09:04.241 --> 02:09:05.020
<v Speaker 1>And then once I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3035
02:09:05.021 --> 02:09:05.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

3036
02:09:05.770 --> 02:09:10.770
<v Speaker 1>If that's the big fear that people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that one day the government's going </v>

3037
02:09:10.770 --> 02:09:14.571
<v Speaker 1>to step in and they're going to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>your guns away and they're going to </v>

3038
02:09:14.571 --> 02:09:14.980
<v Speaker 1>control you with an iron fist and tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>you what to do.</v>

3039
02:09:15.310 --> 02:09:16.330
<v Speaker 1>And people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>

3040
02:09:16.331 --> 02:09:21.331
<v Speaker 1>That's never gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not advocating everybody go out </v>

3041
02:09:21.821 --> 02:09:22.470
<v Speaker 1>and get a gun.</v>

3042
02:09:22.780 --> 02:09:24.550
<v Speaker 1>But if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could never happen,</v>

3043
02:09:24.580 --> 02:09:27.280
<v Speaker 1>what's happening right now with people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to North Korea,</v>

3044
02:09:27.281 --> 02:09:28.330
<v Speaker 1>it's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3045
02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's it?</v>

3046
02:09:29.230 --> 02:09:30.430
<v Speaker 1>How's that going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now?</v>

3047
02:09:30.431 --> 02:09:32.110
<v Speaker 1>In 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

3048
02:09:32.111 --> 02:09:34.150
<v Speaker 1>you don't have an armed population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

3049
02:09:34.151 --> 02:09:36.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a free press.</v>

3050
02:09:36.990 --> 02:09:38.140
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of factors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3051
02:09:38.260 --> 02:09:43.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the government could take it over </v>

3052
02:09:43.260 --> 02:09:45.901
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with saying that is we are </v>

3053
02:09:45.901 --> 02:09:48.751
<v Speaker 1>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you say the government can take </v>

3054
02:09:48.751 --> 02:09:48.751
<v Speaker 1>over the United States of America with </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers,</v>

3055
02:09:48.751 --> 02:09:51.310
<v Speaker 1>those soldiers are citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might be soldiers,</v>

3056
02:09:51.311 --> 02:09:52.810
<v Speaker 1>but there are people that like you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3057
02:09:52.900 --> 02:09:53.970
<v Speaker 1>they're not global.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

3058
02:09:53.980 --> 02:09:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not one percenters who own a,</v>

3059
02:09:56.140 --> 02:09:58.080
<v Speaker 1>like it's going to be very fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3060
02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:02.560
<v Speaker 1>Some young guy from Kentucky to pull a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun on his neighbors because in America,</v>

3061
02:10:02.620 --> 02:10:07.620
<v Speaker 1>dickhead in a suit that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know as a senator or whatever the </v>

3062
02:10:07.620 --> 02:10:07.620
<v Speaker 1>fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tells them what to do.</v>

3063
02:10:07.620 --> 02:10:10.360
<v Speaker 1>There's just a fine line of control that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have some really good.</v>

3064
02:10:10.361 --> 02:10:12.010
<v Speaker 1>When you say the military will take over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country,</v>

3065
02:10:12.011 --> 02:10:14.410
<v Speaker 1>the military is us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just regular people.</v>

3066
02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3067
02:10:15.390 --> 02:10:20.390
<v Speaker 1>It's when they get to the highest levels</v>
<v Speaker 1>of government that gets weird when </v>

3068
02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:22.150
<v Speaker 1>they're completely set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were in a war room and they've</v>

3069
02:10:22.151 --> 02:10:26.200
<v Speaker 1>never actually been in a war and making </v>
<v Speaker 1>politically based decisions,</v>

3070
02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:31.680
<v Speaker 1>that's when shit gets squirrely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the network as the executive </v>

3071
02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:33.200
<v Speaker 1>network executives because getting a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that though,</v>

3072
02:10:33.410 --> 02:10:35.090
<v Speaker 1>like getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially in America,</v>

3073
02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:37.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is not North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3074
02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:41.330
<v Speaker 1>We we have a way different attitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>about each other and about human beings.</v>

3075
02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:46.720
<v Speaker 1>It would be incredibly difficult to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>some regular kid from northern </v>

3076
02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:51.191
<v Speaker 1>California to join the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just shut down schools and take away </v>

3077
02:10:51.681 --> 02:10:53.330
<v Speaker 1>people's guns in a door to door raid.</v>

3078
02:10:53.390 --> 02:10:57.350
<v Speaker 1>I guess I just always feel that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are such followers that it would happen,</v>

3079
02:10:57.351 --> 02:10:58.690
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably fuck it.</v>

3080
02:10:58.700 --> 02:11:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Hope you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are followers until some shit </v>

3081
02:11:03.700 --> 02:11:06.371
<v Speaker 1>goes down and if some shit goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will rise to the occasion like </v>

3082
02:11:06.371 --> 02:11:07.660
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what happened after september 11</v>

3083
02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:12.680
<v Speaker 1>when they woke up a sleeping lion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were excited about going to war </v>

3084
02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:16.151
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets real dangerous when something </v>

3085
02:11:16.151 --> 02:11:17.930
<v Speaker 1>happens because people love like there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great book that I just read from,</v>

3086
02:11:17.931 --> 02:11:22.931
<v Speaker 1>I'm sebastian younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called tribe and it's all about </v>

3087
02:11:22.931 --> 02:11:26.860
<v Speaker 1>bonding during war time and now people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are losing their connection to each </v>

3088
02:11:27.111 --> 02:11:32.111
<v Speaker 1>other by not encountering difficulty and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not struggling and that he lives in a </v>

3089
02:11:33.501 --> 02:11:38.501
<v Speaker 1>poor neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's like a super world famous </v>

3090
02:11:38.501 --> 02:11:40.841
<v Speaker 1>writer and he lives in a poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood and the lower east side </v>

3091
02:11:40.841 --> 02:11:41.510
<v Speaker 1>because he likes being around like </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular people.</v>

3092
02:11:42.540 --> 02:11:44.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his books are very successful.</v>

3093
02:11:44.211 --> 02:11:49.211
<v Speaker 1>I got to imagine he makes a good living </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a very famous war journalists </v>

3094
02:11:49.211 --> 02:11:51.470
<v Speaker 1>and correspondent and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3095
02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:52.760
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got.</v>

3096
02:11:53.260 --> 02:11:58.260
<v Speaker 1>It's his idea is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that live soft lives and the </v>

3097
02:11:58.260 --> 02:12:00.080
<v Speaker 1>people that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body's on designed for it.</v>

3098
02:12:00.081 --> 02:12:05.081
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not healthy and that's why people </v>

3099
02:12:05.081 --> 02:12:06.971
<v Speaker 1>feel like shit and that the happier </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are the people that are under </v>

3100
02:12:06.971 --> 02:12:08.540
<v Speaker 1>stress and that if something did happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>to us,</v>

3101
02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:11.360
<v Speaker 1>we would probably feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And really they say,</v>

3102
02:12:11.361 --> 02:12:16.361
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say that their guy more likely to </v>

3103
02:12:16.361 --> 02:12:16.361
<v Speaker 1>kill himself as the businessman who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the top floor,</v>

3104
02:12:16.361 --> 02:12:20.510
<v Speaker 1>that fucking lost it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the guy who just kinda has had a </v>

3105
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:22.130
<v Speaker 1>rough life because it did not deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3106
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:25.460
<v Speaker 1>There was this bernie made off episode </v>

<v Speaker 1>and this guy made like a.</v>

3108
02:12:30.590 --> 02:12:33.920

<v Speaker 1>with bernie.</v>

3109
02:12:34.130 --> 02:12:36.020

<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

<v Speaker 1>$2,000,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not enough wonder if it was the shame </v>

3121

02:16:47.891 --> 02:16:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might be what?</v>

3204
02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Find out google that why two flashing </v>
<v Speaker 2>lights cause people to have seizures.</v>

3205
02:16:55.070 --> 02:16:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>

3206
02:16:56.231 --> 02:16:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Crystal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3207
02:16:57.430 --> 02:17:00.130
<v Speaker 2>but I think that I would never think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that in my life.</v>

3208
02:17:00.250 --> 02:17:03.160
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't think about that because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>would never affect me.</v>

3209
02:17:03.220 --> 02:17:08.220
<v Speaker 2>So I'd be interested in how the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind works and the flaws of the </v>

3210
02:17:08.220 --> 02:17:08.220
<v Speaker 2>operating system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am a little bit.</v>

3211
02:17:08.220 --> 02:17:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Not that much though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

3212
02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:11.440
<v Speaker 2>Well I want you to tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to have to look it up.</v>

3213
02:17:12.250 --> 02:17:17.250
<v Speaker 2>It says it's from epilepsy.com</v>
<v Speaker 2>for about three percent of people with </v>

3214
02:17:17.471 --> 02:17:22.471
<v Speaker 2>epilepsy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exposure of flashing lights as certain </v>

3215
02:17:22.471 --> 02:17:22.471
<v Speaker 2>intensities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slow.</v>

3216
02:17:22.471 --> 02:17:22.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not even.</v>

3217
02:17:22.550 --> 02:17:27.550
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that makes sense because I would </v>

3218
02:17:27.550 --> 02:17:27.550
<v Speaker 2>have heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3219
02:17:27.550 --> 02:17:28.960
<v Speaker 2>You think you would have heard of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for my friend it was his wife.</v>

3220
02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:30.670
<v Speaker 2>He's got the thing to you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

3221
02:17:30.671 --> 02:17:32.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just gonna forget this anyway.</v>

3222
02:17:32.651 --> 02:17:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Which sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't remember.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you remember that.</v>

3225
02:17:37.330 --> 02:17:41.170
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really impressive.</v>

3226
02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:44.230
<v Speaker 2>If you're out there boys.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3310
02:21:27.531 --> 02:21:30.230
<v Speaker 2>that is not a real kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could just lie man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it was so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His leg fucking went up in the air.</v>

3315
02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:44.390
<v Speaker 2>It just was so ineffective in a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>life scenario.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

3327
02:22:10.310 --> 02:22:15.310
<v Speaker 2>it's all essentially about how there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain things where you know </v>

3328
02:22:15.310 --> 02:22:15.310
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

02:22:15.310 --> 02:22:20.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just finished the audio but we're </v>

3330
02:22:20.050 --> 02:22:20.050
<v Speaker 2>conditioned to cover it up and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3331
02:22:20.050 --> 02:22:20.210
<v Speaker 2>that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>

3332
02:22:20.420 --> 02:22:22.010
<v Speaker 2>that's why you talked to all these women</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were like,</v>

3333
02:22:22.011 --> 02:22:24.260
<v Speaker 2>I knew something was wrong before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

3334
02:22:24.261 --> 02:22:24.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3335
02:22:24.860 --> 02:22:26.130
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times you know something.</v>

3336
02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:31.400
<v Speaker 1>And there's one great story in the book </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they were talking about this </v>

3337
02:22:31.400 --> 02:22:34.641
<v Speaker 1>statue that was this incredible ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>roman stat from roland or ancient greek.</v>

3338
02:22:35.220 --> 02:22:37.020
<v Speaker 1>I forget which one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

3339
02:22:37.050 --> 02:22:40.470
<v Speaker 1>it was a forgery and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was perfect,</v>

3340
02:22:40.500 --> 02:22:42.240
<v Speaker 1>like the way it looked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was amazing,</v>

3341
02:22:42.241 --> 02:22:47.241
<v Speaker 1>but they brought in front of these art </v>
<v Speaker 1>collectors and they looked at it for a </v>

3342
02:22:47.241 --> 02:22:47.241
<v Speaker 1>second and went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not,</v>

3343
02:22:47.241 --> 02:22:48.450
<v Speaker 1>this is not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not good.</v>

3344
02:22:48.451 --> 02:22:50.640
<v Speaker 1>ThIs is fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the immediately there was something</v>

3345
02:22:50.641 --> 02:22:55.641
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they had done testing on the </v>

3346
02:22:55.641 --> 02:22:55.641
<v Speaker 1>surface of it and know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it was.</v>

3347
02:22:55.641 --> 02:22:55.950
<v Speaker 1>They knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they felt it.</v>

3348
02:22:56.340 --> 02:23:01.340
<v Speaker 1>They knew that the stone came from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain part of the world is ancient </v>

3349
02:23:01.340 --> 02:23:04.710
<v Speaker 1>part of the world that was ancient stone</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the amount of some sort of a mineral.</v>

3350
02:23:04.770 --> 02:23:09.770
<v Speaker 1>While on the outside of it they realized</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it had been sitting in the ground </v>

3351
02:23:09.770 --> 02:23:10.320
<v Speaker 1>for thousands of years.</v>

3352
02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:12.330
<v Speaker 1>They thought turned out bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just do.</v>

3353
02:23:12.480 --> 02:23:15.480
<v Speaker 1>There's a method that they use to create</v>
<v Speaker 1>this artificial surface.</v>

3354
02:23:15.481 --> 02:23:18.180
<v Speaker 1>And the whole thing was a fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all fake and they,</v>

3355
02:23:18.240 --> 02:23:23.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put it in like famous museums and </v>

3356
02:23:23.240 --> 02:23:23.240
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating story.</v>

3357
02:23:23.240 --> 02:23:25.110
<v Speaker 1>But the art experts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just whatever the fuck it was,</v>

3358
02:23:25.111 --> 02:23:30.111
<v Speaker 1>they just knew immediately and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>called bullshit on it when all these </v>

3359
02:23:30.111 --> 02:23:33.741
<v Speaker 1>other people had already signed off on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and even paid for it and even asked </v>

3360
02:23:33.741 --> 02:23:33.750
<v Speaker 1>one of the experts asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you get your money back?</v>

3361
02:23:34.080 --> 02:23:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3422
02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:49.800
<v Speaker 2>in the book a gift of fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say that like you always knew </v>

<v Speaker 2>somehow though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3424
02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:50.860
<v Speaker 2>But I think you always think that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit goes wrong.</v>

<v Speaker 2>True retrospect.</v>
