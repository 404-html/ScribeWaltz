00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.680
Oh,
let me tell these fucking freak pitches that were doing it already.
Okay.

2
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:08.550
Hold on.
Hello Freak bitches.
I'm putting this on Twitter.
As I say,

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.750
how the freak bitch is me and when I say that folks,
um,

4
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.840
I'm being so nice.
Trust me.
I mean it in the nicest way possible.
Um,

5
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.090
Duncan trussell's and the Buddhism there a little dark controls.

6
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.710
How are you my brother?
I'm good.

7
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.290
Dunkin has traveled all across this great land in recent months.

8
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:32.760
Ladies and gentlemen,
he's gained newfound perspective.
He's been squashing.

9
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.470
There's been many,
many things in the wonderful world of talking Trussell.

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.810
I have squatch it to it.

11
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.320
There was this episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by

12
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:48.090
legal zoom.
If you have never heard of legal zoom,

13
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:50.670
what they are is they're not,
it's not a law firm,

14
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.720
but it allows you to do legal things online.

15
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.830
They provide self-help services at your specific direction and you can save a

16
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.730
lot of money as opposed to going to a lawyer like you see their last will and

17
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:10.470
testament 69 bucks.
Yeah,
you can form an LLC.

18
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:15.090
You can become incorporated.
99 bucks.
It's a suite service.

19
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.070
The way it's set up is they give you this,

20
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.410
this pattern to follow.
They show you how to get through it.

21
00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:26.880
They show it's a self help type service,
but if shit goes wrong,

22
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.420
they can also connect you with an independent tourney if you need additional

23
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:32.070
guidance.
So if you get to a position,
you're like,

24
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.760
I don't know if I did this right and I'm fucking panicking and I don't want to

25
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:40.140
go to jail.
They come with a list of,

26
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.060
I mean I'll come with the list.

27
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.530
They connect you with a list of independent attorneys.

28
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.920
So if you need additional guidance,
you can get it that way.

29
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.100
And they're online process couldn't be much easier.

30
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.050
They'll take care of you from start to finish.

31
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.770
So checkout legal zoom and see if they can help you today.

32
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.630
And they want you to,
they have a thing that you have to say.
It's not a law firm.

33
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.820
So they provide self-help services at your specific direction.
Uh,

34
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.630
and if you use the code name Rogan,
you will save some money and check it out.

35
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:13.800
So it's an excellent company.
69 bucks for a last will and testament,
man.
Yeah,

36
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.730
it's pretty bad ass.
It's,
it's just how much that it's usually costs.

37
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.640
You would have to go to a lawyer and whatever the lawyer charges an hour,

38
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:21.750
who knows how long it would take,

39
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:24.420
but it wouldn't be a lot more than fucking 69 bucks to mint.

40
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.110
Pranks can be made after you're dead.
You can even get divorced,

41
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.770
have to do what you say and it lasts long testament or they feel guilty only

42
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:34.410
tells us none of your Duncan Trussell.
They're like,

43
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.770
fuck that asshole doing that.
I bet you would.

44
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.850
If you ever die and I'm alive,
I'm going to hear it,
boy.
Anyway,

45
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.790
go to legalzoom.com.
Use the cardboard Rogan.
Uh,

46
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:49.770
we're also brought to you by a new sponsor this week,

47
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:54.140
which is lumosity.com and Duncan Trussell.
This would interest you.
Um,

48
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.210
it is a website that's set up with exercises for your brain

49
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.850
<v 1>and they have all sorts of cool games you can play and it only takes a few</v>

50
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.631
minutes each day.

51
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:11.920
And they're designed to improve your brain's performance based on your goals.

52
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.790
Be Sharper,
more focused in meetings,
a better problem solver.

53
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.800
I love the idea of this.
So I'm,
I'm starting to use it and you know,
I,

54
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:25.210
what I'm going to want to do is I'm going to do this sponsor once a week and I'm

55
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:27.760
going to commit to doing it several times a week.

56
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.230
And I'll tell you if I feel anything.

57
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.310
But listen to me right now when I tell you that I am a dummy and,
uh,

58
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.550
<v 2>I,
I might be in the middle of Doulas and I'll,</v>

59
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:39.610
I'll have to check Twitter or there'd be a,

60
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.690
some fights I'll be watching in the background and I'll focus on that for a

61
00:03:42.691 --> 00:03:45.990
little.
Okay.
So I might not be your best spokesperson.

62
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.460
What I'm saying is I'm going to be honest about it.
And,
um,
I love exercise.

63
00:03:50.461 --> 00:03:54.120
So I think I'd practically actually probably love exercise with my brain.

64
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.150
It's actually one of the reasons why I consider getting into chess because uh,

65
00:03:58.151 --> 00:03:59.520
uh,
from what I've heard,

66
00:03:59.521 --> 00:04:03.660
it is like the ultimate brain exercises as far as like being able to calculate

67
00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:04.494
and see things like,

68
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.330
it literally does open like new realms of possibility for the way you think.

69
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.780
Yeah,
but I'm scared of chess.
What do you don't play at all?
No,
no,
no.

70
00:04:12.781 --> 00:04:14.640
I'm scared of chess the same way.
I'm scared of video games.

71
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.580
I think I'd become obsessed sucked into chess.
I think so.

72
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.030
Pretty sure I've seen people do it.
I've seen it at cafes,

73
00:04:21.031 --> 00:04:23.210
the people that bring those roll out boards.

74
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.390
I've seen that in Denver.
They have that.

75
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.110
What does that promenade Brian in Denver where everybody walks through.

76
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.770
I don't remember,
but it's not Pearl Street that's done.
That's boulder,
right?

77
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.630
What the fuck is it?
Whatever it is.
Sixth Street know that Santa Monica,
right,

78
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.470
right.
Whatever it is and whatever it is.
In Denver,

79
00:04:43.471 --> 00:04:46.800
they have this outside area and there's always these dudes with the timers.

80
00:04:46.801 --> 00:04:49.650
They're playing that time sounded guys,
or

81
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.350
those guys are animals are playing that crazy timer chat,
smoking.
Do you no good.

82
00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:59.580
You have to be a chest to play time or chess.
This is like,
I mean,

83
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.890
I pawned her,
I used to play when I was a kid,

84
00:05:01.891 --> 00:05:05.580
but I couldn't take it anymore because I played with my stepdad and he was,

85
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.350
he was ridiculous.
He would wait like five minutes for his move.
He was like,
man,

86
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.580
that's how we consider this.
And he would talk and I'd be like,
come on,

87
00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:18.600
you're killing me.
Way to add for chest back then.

88
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.020
But now I think I would actually get into it and that's the problem.
Well,

89
00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:24.520
I think that's a good thing to get into.
You know,
it's really into chess.

90
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.790
Stanley Kubrick.
Oh,
did you hear about that?

91
00:05:26.791 --> 00:05:31.530
They said that he shut down shooting on the shining for an entire day because

92
00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:34.980
one of the actors like to play chess and he would just stop everything and just

93
00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:38.310
played chess with a guy all day.
That's bad ass.

94
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.610
I would be like,
Dad,
if I was a kid

95
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.760
<v 1>director and someone could play nine ball,
I be like,
how good are you play?</v>

96
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.240
I'd be like,
come on,
let's go.
Let's play.

97
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.870
I have a few friends that play pool like really good and I get to hang out with

98
00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:54.330
them every now and then and shoot pool with them.
It's so exciting.

99
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.790
It's like at all my pool playing friends is dom.
I rare uh,
um,

100
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.120
Adam for our place.
Really good.
Of course.
Uh,

101
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.350
Ari Shaffir our sphere can play pretty good.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.

102
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.650
He plays pretty bar.
He's a smart dude.
He figures things out,
you know,
he gets,

103
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.380
he figures things out and then he gets better at stuff.
Really good,
cool.
Uh,

104
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.960
but Max,
everybody is course one of my very good friends in these top level world

105
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.510
professional.
He's,
he's bad ass.

106
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.230
But when you watch guys who are really good and they play really good,

107
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.140
complete mental game,
they're making geometric patterns as there.

108
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.200
We're looking at the table.

109
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.410
It's not just about the execution of like hitting the ball on the right spot.

110
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.050
It's about these geometric patterns that you're laying out,
your seeing the,
the,

111
00:06:37.051 --> 00:06:39.980
the path of the ball is going to take and whether or not there's going to be

112
00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:43.310
problems,
collisions and bad angles.
And all this different shit.

113
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:45.770
So it's a constant calculation that people who don't really know how to play

114
00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:48.270
don't really understand like how the guys play at a high,

115
00:06:48.271 --> 00:06:51.920
high level and it becomes really fascinating.
Um,

116
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.150
so I would imagine chess would be this same fucking thing and worse because you

117
00:06:56.151 --> 00:06:59.000
could play anytime you want everywhere on the what.

118
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:02.180
You just get online and you play.
And if you don't want to play online,

119
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.350
<v 3>play with your computer.
Smart.
Yeah.
When you,
when you play chess,
you seem smart.</v>

120
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.560
If you play star craft a game here with slen times better than chess or bull

121
00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:15.800
combined,
you seem like the ultimate

122
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.580
<v 1>door pull is one where it bothers you.
If people beat you.</v>

123
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.450
If you beat me in starcraft,
I don't know how to play starcraft.
I can't.

124
00:07:24.451 --> 00:07:27.540
Everybody kind of thinks they know how to play pool a little bit.
Not everybody,

125
00:07:27.541 --> 00:07:28.830
but a lot of people do.

126
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.830
<v 3>Yeah.
It's the investment of time.
There's,
it's,
that's a funny thing,
man,</v>

127
00:07:32.831 --> 00:07:37.610
that feeling that comes from losing a game,
which is ultimately meaningless in,

128
00:07:37.611 --> 00:07:38.441
in the world.

129
00:07:38.441 --> 00:07:42.490
In the grand scheme of things from the beginning of time to the end of time,

130
00:07:42.491 --> 00:07:45.750
some individual star craft game has is bad.

131
00:07:45.751 --> 00:07:50.470
As much impact on things is a Gnat Fart,
but at the end of it,

132
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:54.560
if you get beaten,
I,
it stings,
man.

133
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.520
I'm bummed.
I got dropped from silver to bronze league.

134
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.290
I'm back down like number 73 and the bronze,

135
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:06.100
we got to get back on your horse.
I get fucking up,
man.
I give up.

136
00:08:06.101 --> 00:08:09.270
Fuck you blizzard.
I'm done with your game.
The

137
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:14.130
<v 1>reason why pool always had significance to it is because either the name pool is</v>

138
00:08:14.131 --> 00:08:18.570
not the real term for the real term is pocket billiards named pool was created

139
00:08:18.571 --> 00:08:22.530
because it was about money.
They would pull up their money and bet on games.

140
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.440
That's cool.
So that's where the term pool came from.
Actually,

141
00:08:25.441 --> 00:08:27.570
when you go to play pool,
you're going to gamble.

142
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.680
It's one of the most gambling associated games there are for people to play one

143
00:08:31.681 --> 00:08:32.250
on one.

144
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.880
Like you could walk into any pool hall in the country and you just start hitting

145
00:08:35.881 --> 00:08:38.220
balls around and if you play pretty decent,

146
00:08:38.221 --> 00:08:40.860
someone's going to come up to you and like you want to do something and then

147
00:08:40.861 --> 00:08:44.760
boom,
you got an action.
I got,
I haven't happened me everywhere I go,
that's cool.

148
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.970
Every pool hall,
there's some dude who will,

149
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.310
they always sleep think that like some celebrities willing to gamble with them

150
00:08:50.311 --> 00:08:52.740
and lose all their money too.
And that's always a nice assumption.

151
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.070
What's a standard bed?
Okay.
It can be anything it could

152
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.240
<v 0>be betting for is time.</v>

153
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:01.230
Time is like a nice nice when the people do or they're being friendly where like

154
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:04.290
a you and I would,
it would cost like $20 an hour or whatever it is.

155
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:08.700
High seed and we would gamble so that I would pay the bill.
I see.
Yeah.

156
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.880
I don't think it's $20 an hour and maybe it might be in like Manhattan or

157
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:14.880
something like that,
but whatever it is,
that's like a nice one.

158
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.830
Or sometimes people just split time.
They just play for the fun of it.
All right.

159
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.150
But sometimes the gamble and gamble or 20 bucks,
50 bucks.

160
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:22.700
But I've seen people play for 10,000

161
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.530
<v 4>mine.
Yeah.
It's a real mind.
Fuck man.</v>

162
00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.400
Crazy.

163
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:35.460
Did you ever hear about that guy who took all of his money and bet it on a dice?

164
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.720
You know that poem by?
I can't remember.
It's no,
not because of a poem.
Yes.

165
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.560
That point.
I'm like,
if you can take your life in bed it on the roll of a dice,

166
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:52.750
then you sir are a man do that hurts my feelings.
Just thinking about doing that.

167
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:57.040
Well he did it.
I think he won.
What?
Yeah,
I think he won.

168
00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.130
I hope I didn't make his story a little better.
He's still an idiot,

169
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.090
but at least nobody suffers.
Least nobody suffers.

170
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.290
Um,

171
00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:09.010
<v 0>this is supposed to be a Lumosity commercial.
That's how we do shit.
Lumosity.</v>

172
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:13.090
Lumosity is like,
I'm not sure if this is really still a commercial,
but yes,

173
00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:18.130
it is.
The idea behind this,
what we're talking about,
mental games,

174
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:19.090
um,
new ma,

175
00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.420
Lumosity has it set up where it doesn't take very much time to do every day.

176
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.080
They have it set up like exercises,

177
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.400
take them a few minutes a day and it's designed to improve your brain's

178
00:10:27.401 --> 00:10:31.990
performance.
Uh,
based on your goals.
They have be sharper,

179
00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.610
be more focused in meetings,

180
00:10:33.611 --> 00:10:38.611
a better problem solver or remember more and think more clearly.

181
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.470
I'm really interested in this because I'm trying,

182
00:10:41.471 --> 00:10:45.010
I'm going to try it as I'm endorsing it.
I've heard nothing but good things.

183
00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.970
I've heard nothing.
I looked it up online and people think,

184
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.240
seem to think that it helped them.

185
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.350
<v 4>I think it's interesting man,
I should do it man,</v>

186
00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:56.880
because I can not remember people's names and that is so upsetting to people

187
00:10:56.881 --> 00:10:57.990
when you don't remember their names.

188
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.560
I have people like I've lived in front of people and talk to them for eight

189
00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:08.580
months straight,
never saying their name because I couldn't remember it.

190
00:11:08.581 --> 00:11:09.900
And after a certain amount of time,

191
00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:13.650
if you ask someone their name after you've been talking to them for six months,

192
00:11:13.651 --> 00:11:15.440
they're like,
what is wrong with you?

193
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.620
<v 0>Yeah,
I think it's a,
it's sort of a very,
it's like everything else.</v>

194
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.900
If you don't use it,
it gets weak.
No Shit.
Everything.
The,

195
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:27.660
the mind is just like everything else.
Um,
it's like your body,
it's like you,

196
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:32.730
my mind works better when I'm thinking about interesting things too.
You know,

197
00:11:32.731 --> 00:11:36.900
when I'm focusing on problems or games or things like that,
it works better.
Yeah.

198
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.240
It's getting a workout,
you know?

199
00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:44.010
So I think it's really cool that these guys put together these gals.

200
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.030
I Dunno,
it might be all gals,
um,
put together this,
uh,

201
00:11:48.031 --> 00:11:51.720
this website where it's just designed to improve your brain performance.

202
00:11:51.721 --> 00:11:55.900
So I'm going to use it.
Uh,
I'm going to use it and report on it.
Um,
and uh,

203
00:11:55.901 --> 00:11:59.230
I'll let you know,
but I think it's going to help.
I'm going to actually try it.

204
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.660
You should do it too,
bitch.
I ain't doing that.

205
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.530
That's going to interfere my star craft man.

206
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.580
And tell them you heard it from me,
Joe Rogan.
There's no coat.
Just a,

207
00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.420
maybe it asks you,
where did you hear about it?
Telling me.
All right,
my friends,

208
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.360
we love the shit out of you and uh,
you already know it on it is.

209
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.420
So let's just roll this pitch.
Duncan trussell's in the his house.

210
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.120
Those commercials were already too long,
even though they're acquiring town

211
00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.890
<v 4>experience.
Happy with them.</v>

212
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.740
<v 0>So did you run out and get a new iPhone today?</v>

213
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.750
<v 4>Daca,
tropical timber,
20 seconds.
You're going to camp out?
Wait,
no,</v>

214
00:12:40.751 --> 00:12:43.990
but I need to ice shattered this fucking phone.
I got to get another phone.
Oh,

215
00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:46.960
what'd you do?
I nothing special.

216
00:12:46.961 --> 00:12:50.350
I just pushed it off a shelf accidentally and it broke.

217
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.720
Do you try to go gangster and use no case?
Is that what you're doing?
Yeah.

218
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.390
That's a silly man.
Smoke.
Well,
no,
it's because I eat,

219
00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.670
it is stupid to not have a case and I always,
it happens where I'll have a case,

220
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.240
but there's always some necessity to take the case off.
I don't.

221
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.910
It's something we'll always have more.
I have to take off the case,

222
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:12.150
like to put in one of those new charging cases or to switch cases and then I

223
00:13:12.221 --> 00:13:16.660
just,
it breaks,
my phone's always break.
Never had a broken iPhone ever,

224
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.670
ever.
I've had every single iPhone,
never had one cracked screen.

225
00:13:20.671 --> 00:13:22.200
I've never had an uncrack submarine,
Bro.

226
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:26.990
<v 0>At least one.
At least one.
Yeah.</v>

227
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.210
They feel really nice when they're like this.

228
00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.450
When it's like this and it's just raw.
When you're holding it raw dog,

229
00:13:32.451 --> 00:13:34.100
you feel like a gangster.
Yeah.

230
00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:38.990
Just holding that metal and glass phone in that sense.
The iPhones,
the shit,

231
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.050
and then it's like the,
the build quality.
It doesn't,

232
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:45.580
it actually is like pleasing to hold onto.
Like,
I,

233
00:13:45.581 --> 00:13:49.890
I feel like I made a smart move and having a fun.
It's this cool.
Okay.

234
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:54.630
<v 4>I am.
Yeah.
I'm,
I can't wait.
I am excited about the new Siri.</v>

235
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.360
Fuck out of here.
Here's the new Siri.
I didn't watch it through series.

236
00:13:58.650 --> 00:13:59.610
The new Siri.

237
00:13:59.611 --> 00:14:04.611
You can actually ask Siri what lady Gaga his tweets are and it'll tell you

238
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.500
what happens if you do that now.
I don't know.
Let's find out.

239
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.950
What's Lady Gaga?
Lady Gaga.
His tweets.

240
00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:16.243
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

241
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.350
<v 4>Okay.
But first you need to install the Twitter app.</v>

242
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.130
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

243
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.940
<v 0>Oh,
that a web search Twitter APP.
I don't use the Twitter APP.</v>

244
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:30.000
Oh,
well install the Twitter APP,
bitch.
What's my,
what's my name?

245
00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:32.510
<v 6>Okay,</v>

246
00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:37.130
<v 4>you're Brian.
Wow.
That's Kinda crazy.
On your doctor.
Fudge packer.</v>

247
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.170
You have that program?
Yeah.
How'd you do that?

248
00:14:42.171 --> 00:14:45.620
Because all you have to do is just go to Syria and go from now on,
call me,

249
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.790
Fuck Mcpherson.
And then,
then from now on they'll be like,
all right,
fuck,

250
00:14:49.791 --> 00:14:53.000
motherfuckers in here is your,
and stuff like that.
That's ridiculous.

251
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:58.280
I don't use Siri ever.
I've been using it more from now on.
Call me Amanda.

252
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.570
<v 7>Okay.</v>

253
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:00.510
<v 0>What good does it do you?</v>

254
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.170
<v 7>I don't know who you are,
but you can tell me,</v>

255
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.303
<v 4>Oh,
I see</v>

256
00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.150
<v 7>mine.</v>

257
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:11.100
<v 4>Ah,
and settings.
You got to go to settings.
You wants to go wants to do that.
Hey,</v>

258
00:15:11.101 --> 00:15:14.960
can I make it?
Can I announce this thing that I'm working on?
Um,

259
00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.150
so I told him sexy,
got their son.

260
00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.040
I told you this thing about the ordering an oculus rift.

261
00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.710
I ordered an oculus rift.
I'm scared.
I'm gonna lose you.

262
00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.980
So here's what I want to do.
And I made this announcement on my podcast.

263
00:15:28.981 --> 00:15:30.540
I don't know how to do this shit,

264
00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:34.920
but I suddenly realized that I could crowd source this thing that I want to do

265
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:38.280
and get help from the podcast community to help me do this thing,

266
00:15:38.281 --> 00:15:41.850
which is I want to combine like second life,

267
00:15:41.851 --> 00:15:46.851
three d virtual environments with doing live podcasts with the oculus rift and

268
00:15:48.751 --> 00:15:53.490
some kind of motion sensing technologies so that the movement of people doing

269
00:15:53.491 --> 00:15:57.120
the podcast get translated to the avatars on stage.

270
00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:01.590
So basically the idea would be in second wife or some other virtual environment,

271
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:06.830
you and I could put on oculus rifts and stare out at alive audience of avatars

272
00:16:08.131 --> 00:16:13.131
who are watching the podcast in three d space because I think if we could pull

273
00:16:14.041 --> 00:16:14.610
that off,

274
00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:19.080
it would be one of the most psychedelic bad ass things because something I

275
00:16:19.081 --> 00:16:21.570
always remember is the time we were in Chicago.

276
00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:26.750
That's the biggest crowd I ever performed for is like 3000 people or 3,400

277
00:16:27.091 --> 00:16:29.400
people.
It was fucking crazy for me,
man.

278
00:16:29.401 --> 00:16:32.370
I'd never performed for that many people.

279
00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.780
Just that wall of humanity in front of you.

280
00:16:36.781 --> 00:16:39.810
It was insane.
And with podcasts,

281
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.900
it's curious because you sort of in the back of your head,

282
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.340
you know that there's some massive audience listening to this,
to your podcast.

283
00:16:47.341 --> 00:16:52.341
You know a lot of people and if you could just get a visual representation of

284
00:16:52.351 --> 00:16:55.860
that.
If like 5% of your audience or 10% of your audience,

285
00:16:56.130 --> 00:17:00.630
we're able to access this technology and watch the podcast so that you could

286
00:17:00.631 --> 00:17:05.631
then look out at the crowd of like thirty thousand fifty thousand avatars,

287
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:09.060
robots,
vampires,
Unicorns,
whatever.

288
00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:12.930
People decided to be via a rift man.

289
00:17:12.931 --> 00:17:17.400
That would be fucking cool.
That would be so cool.
If oculus rift catches on,

290
00:17:17.401 --> 00:17:18.810
I don't see myself wearing that shit.

291
00:17:18.811 --> 00:17:20.530
It's going to like kind of when they can connect.

292
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:25.920
<v 0>Are you even talking about if Oculus riff capture?
Yeah.
Do you,</v>

293
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:30.400
do you know what you think this rift catches on?

294
00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.690
You think that when this comes out it's going to go crazy.

295
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:33.530
Let's going to blow up.

296
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:36.230
It's going to be the craziest thing that humanity's ever seen.

297
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.560
You think you're going to have three d environment so people can create and you

298
00:17:39.561 --> 00:17:41.240
can go into and with virtual reality,

299
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:45.200
it's a thing that people thought the future was going to be way back in 1980.

300
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.610
Yeah,
I had movies about it.

301
00:17:46.611 --> 00:17:50.010
They would put on virtual reality helmets and enter into these different

302
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:50.670
<v 2>worlds.</v>

303
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:54.180
Everybody thought that Vr was going to be something that was mastered by now,

304
00:17:54.181 --> 00:17:58.110
but up until now it's been pretty crude and yep.
And goof,
inexpensive.

305
00:17:58.111 --> 00:18:00.870
It's been really big.
If you wanted to do it,
Brian,

306
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:05.220
this people I know have put this thing on right?
Oh yeah.
They say that.
It's like,

307
00:18:05.221 --> 00:18:07.170
uh,
it's supposedly awesome.
I,
I agree.

308
00:18:07.171 --> 00:18:09.570
Like Sony has supposedly a better one coming out next year though.

309
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:14.040
They say the impact is going to be akin to the invent to TV.

310
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:17.910
It's basically like the ATV.
Sony's going to hook one up to their playstations.

311
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:21.690
Supposedly their new place station.
They're having my more accurate,
uh,

312
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.540
their version of one,
which I still think it's awesome.

313
00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:29.130
I can't wait to play with it,
but I also don't see it changing the world.

314
00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:32.040
Like an iPhone or cell phone or something.
Well,

315
00:18:32.041 --> 00:18:34.680
maybe not that extreme because of the connectivity that we have.

316
00:18:34.681 --> 00:18:38.910
A cell phone is pretty incredible with cell phones have been able to do connect

317
00:18:38.911 --> 00:18:39.870
people all across.

318
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.940
<v 4>Oh yeah.
I think it will be that information.
It'll be that extreme.</v>

319
00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:46.470
It'll fit that.
Yeah.
I think it'd be more extreme.
I think it's getting here,

320
00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.160
follow this.
This is what happens.
Here's the,
here's what's going to happen.
Is it?

321
00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:50.990
It's the,

322
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:55.870
it'll go from development into a being applied to certain games like it,

323
00:18:55.871 --> 00:18:58.930
it'll become access.
You can play borderlands on it or something like that.

324
00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.640
And the description of this is like,

325
00:19:00.641 --> 00:19:05.350
so you put this thing on and now you are in the video game,

326
00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.560
so it's perfectly tracking your head movement.
At first it's going to be,

327
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:12.010
it won't be perfect.
I Bet I've heard it's pretty damn close though,
right?

328
00:19:12.011 --> 00:19:16.120
At first it's going to be a little off,
but as the thing develops and improves,

329
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.130
it's not just going to track your head movement.

330
00:19:18.131 --> 00:19:20.830
It's going to track your eye movement,
you know?

331
00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:25.180
And then this combines with something called haptic technology,
which is this,

332
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:30.370
if you've seen this man,
these new air guns that like blast out air,

333
00:19:30.371 --> 00:19:33.490
it's specific parts of your body.
So if you're getting shot,

334
00:19:33.491 --> 00:19:36.190
you can actually feel yourself getting shot.
Wow.

335
00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:41.250
Then you combine that with this omnidirectional treadmill and now you are fully

336
00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:46.960
immersed in a different universe.
So that is going to be,

337
00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.640
it's going to be fun,
but I think it's the right one.

338
00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:49.410
I think it's gonna be like a,

339
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:52.390
you go to an arcade to have this experience that I don't think it's going to be

340
00:19:52.391 --> 00:19:54.970
in everybody's house and people are going to have treadmills in their house and

341
00:19:54.971 --> 00:19:59.140
doing arrogant on this treadmill is really small and you could just park it in

342
00:19:59.141 --> 00:20:02.470
front of a TV,
just like you have a chair in front of a TV.
It's portable.

343
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.060
And the in the,
the,

344
00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:07.630
what's going to happen is this is going to keep improving.

345
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:12.400
It's not just going to stop at like borderlands are stop it.
Uh,
uh,

346
00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.930
world of Warcraft.

347
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.700
It's gonna get better and better and better till games become indistinguishable

348
00:20:18.701 --> 00:20:19.391
from reality.

349
00:20:19.391 --> 00:20:23.800
So you put this thing on and you're no longer be in this world,

350
00:20:23.801 --> 00:20:27.640
but you'll be in another world that's crossed that uncanny valley as they call

351
00:20:27.641 --> 00:20:29.140
it.
Yeah,
and seems real.

352
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:33.070
And that's where we'll start seeing the first legal cases of people who

353
00:20:33.071 --> 00:20:37.000
committed crimes because they thought that they had taken off there or they'd

354
00:20:37.001 --> 00:20:41.140
put on a VR device and they had an APP.
That's what's gonna start happening.
Well,

355
00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:46.140
<v 2>that would have to be far more interactive than this current level of technology</v>

356
00:20:46.541 --> 00:20:47.980
you'd have to have.
That gets into your

357
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.410
<v 0>actual mind itself and the changes the way you feel.
Thing.</v>

358
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:54.500
<v 3>I have people who come over and play grand theft auto with me who haven't played</v>

359
00:20:54.501 --> 00:20:58.190
it before and they leave.
I in called call me and they're like,
man,

360
00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.670
I want to run over people now.
That game makes me want to run over people.

361
00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.890
They're joking of course,
but it does.

362
00:21:03.891 --> 00:21:07.430
When you're driving after playing that game,
it kind of pops into your head like,

363
00:21:07.431 --> 00:21:09.970
oh,
that's it.
Look at that crowd of people you could plow down.

364
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:13.280
<v 0>Do you play it with a steering wheel or do you use one of those?
Um,</v>

365
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:16.880
grand theft auto uses?
Uh,
I,
I it might have a steering wheel function,

366
00:21:16.881 --> 00:21:21.320
but I think it uses the x box controller cause you could always get those like

367
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.730
additional controllers.
Right.

368
00:21:22.731 --> 00:21:25.790
Don't they make those for driving games does mean it's not really a driving game

369
00:21:25.791 --> 00:21:27.960
that grand theft auto is oh no,
no,
no.

370
00:21:27.961 --> 00:21:31.450
So the running people over in consequential,
it's just the violence.
Yeah,

371
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:34.110
<v 3>it's just a May.
It's a may him engine.</v>

372
00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:39.000
So like you end up like inevitably doing something that makes you get chased by

373
00:21:39.001 --> 00:21:41.760
the cops and then you flee from the cops.

374
00:21:41.761 --> 00:21:45.300
And during that time you plow down as many people as you can.

375
00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:50.450
You can do shit like run someone over or hurt someone and then an ambulance will

376
00:21:50.581 --> 00:21:54.560
come to take him to the hospital.
The new one coming out looks incredible.

377
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:56.930
<v 0>What a strange desire.</v>

378
00:21:56.931 --> 00:22:01.880
We have to do horrible things to people with no consequence to just run around

379
00:22:01.881 --> 00:22:05.330
and brain people with fucking crowbars and run over him.

380
00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:10.490
Like that is such a strange desire.
Yeah.
It's fun.
Yeah.
Woo.

381
00:22:10.491 --> 00:22:12.950
You do it in games.
Yeah.
Ooh,
yeah,

382
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:18.330
<v 3>it is.
It is a big part of us for sure.
Why?
What is that?</v>

383
00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:22.770
Well,
I mean,
we come from,
we're,
we're a predatorial creature.

384
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.800
Everything for us to survive,
we have to kill.

385
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:29.670
The only way to survive on this planet is to kill plants or animals.

386
00:22:29.671 --> 00:22:34.080
But you got to kill something if you want to live.
Oh,
we're predatorial.

387
00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:39.270
<v 0>Yeah.
My goodness.
This comes out next week.
Fascinating.
Because it's so,</v>

388
00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:43.560
it's such an exciting thing to play like a really good video game,

389
00:22:43.561 --> 00:22:47.190
especially against other people like,
uh,
you know,
what are those?
What's,

390
00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.670
what's the big one call of duty that everybody plays?
I don't,
yeah,
call of duty.

391
00:22:50.671 --> 00:22:53.760
Yeah.
College.
Each one huge.
Ron writes,
the guys get together,

392
00:22:53.761 --> 00:22:56.940
they link TVs up and they get fucking nutty with each other and,
and,

393
00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.370
and play these like really,
really intense games.
Yeah.

394
00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:04.500
I guess the intensity of like really competitive games like that,

395
00:23:04.501 --> 00:23:07.890
especially those super immersive ones and the high graphics and the huge screen.

396
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.440
It's like how are you going to get that in the regular world?

397
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.560
What are you going to do this going to get you feeling like you're actually in a

398
00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:17.060
firefight like besides actually going to want to fucking fire.

399
00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.660
That's is going to give you that kind of stimulation.
Nothing.
Hey,

400
00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:20.990
you're not going to get a driving.

401
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.520
<v 3>Nothing.
We're taught.
What we're doing here is we're tunneling into,
uh,</v>

402
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:29.730
we're tunneling into space digitally and creating these alternative universes

403
00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:34.300
that we're using technology to port ourselves into.
Yeah.
What the fuck is that?

404
00:23:34.301 --> 00:23:36.640
That's what's happening.
It's the impulse to travel.

405
00:23:36.641 --> 00:23:41.641
It's the impulse to explore being inverted and telescoping into itself instead

406
00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:46.100
of going out.
Cause there's nowhere else to go.
We don't have access to rockets.

407
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:50.270
Most of us don't.
Space Tourism is going to happen,
but it's extremely dangerous.

408
00:23:50.271 --> 00:23:54.290
So to satisfy that wandering pilgrim,

409
00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:58.460
hunter gatherers spirit that caused us to populate the entire planet,

410
00:23:58.461 --> 00:24:03.461
where now actually ballooning reality out digitally and filling that space in

411
00:24:04.881 --> 00:24:09.680
with experiences that people can have.
The generally involve traveling,
exploring,

412
00:24:09.681 --> 00:24:13.640
discovering new stuff,
new terrain and part of,
and also killing.

413
00:24:13.641 --> 00:24:16.910
Cause that's also what we did back in the day when we explored it was gives you

414
00:24:16.911 --> 00:24:20.480
a Christopher Columbus,
it was grand theft auto except you had a boat,

415
00:24:20.481 --> 00:24:23.450
but you are still like running around shopping peoples' arms off.

416
00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:25.710
<v 1>Yeah.
And when you really think about that,</v>

417
00:24:25.711 --> 00:24:29.670
that is how this country was kind of founded by a bunch of really crazy people

418
00:24:29.671 --> 00:24:33.210
that got on boats with guns and swords.
And when they got here,

419
00:24:33.211 --> 00:24:38.160
there was all our idea that we're taught in school of what Christopher Columbus

420
00:24:38.161 --> 00:24:41.040
and all those people did.
And,
and the,
the actual,

421
00:24:41.041 --> 00:24:44.780
like really graphic depictions that have been attributed to be,

422
00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:48.750
it's really terrifying,
terrifying,
horrific genocidal shit.

423
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:53.480
<v 3>Yes,
that's true.
Yeah.
People don't like to,
uh,
they,</v>

424
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:56.780
most people don't like to think about the fact that the,

425
00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.170
what we emerge from is such a violent,

426
00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:05.440
violent history that is violence beyond anything happening in the world right

427
00:25:06.501 --> 00:25:08.120
now.
I mean,
they were giving,

428
00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:13.600
weren't they giving blankets with smallpox on it to Indians?
Isn't that,
wasn't,

429
00:25:13.601 --> 00:25:13.940
that was,

430
00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:17.400
<v 1>I think that's much later.
I think that's the,
the actual United States governor.</v>

431
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:22.180
<v 3>Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And then that's,
then you keep going back and it's like one,</v>

432
00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:24.120
a atrocity after another.

433
00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.860
<v 1>Yeah,
that was most certainly done.
Um,
this guy,
uh,</v>

434
00:25:27.861 --> 00:25:32.480
has a really interesting article about stock guy,
Ben Cohen that's in the,
uh,

435
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:33.950
the daily banter,

436
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:37.610
so saying should a mass murderer really be celebrated?

437
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.050
And that's about Christopher Columbus.
Yeah,
it's really interesting.

438
00:25:42.051 --> 00:25:45.710
We get a day off school,
you get a day off work.
But uh,

439
00:25:45.711 --> 00:25:48.380
he did some horrible things in his quest for gold.

440
00:25:48.381 --> 00:25:52.730
Columbus seeing bits of gold amongst the Indians concluded that there were huge

441
00:25:52.731 --> 00:25:53.391
amounts of it.

442
00:25:53.391 --> 00:25:56.570
He ordered the natives to find a certain amount of gold within a certain period

443
00:25:56.571 --> 00:26:00.830
of time.
And if they did not meet their quota,
their arms were hacked off.

444
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:05.840
The others were to learn from this and deliver the gold.
Whoa,
man.

445
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:11.540
Fucking whoa.
Their arms were hacked off.
The others were to learn from this.

446
00:26:11.541 --> 00:26:16.310
I mean,
they went brutal gangster eval right away.
Yep.

447
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:19.520
It's incredible.
For Gold.
Yeah.

448
00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:22.730
Listen,
this is crazy shit,
man.

449
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:27.970
Documenting an eye witness account of the Spanish soldiers by Bartolome de Las

450
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.810
Casas,
a Dominican priest Zin continues.

451
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:36.080
Last Casas saw soldier stabbing Indians for sport,

452
00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.280
dashing babies' heads under rocks,
and when the Indians resisted,

453
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:44.070
the Spanish hunted them down.
Equipped for killing with horses,
armor

454
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:48.990
<v 0>plate Lance's pikes rifles,
crossbows and vicious dogs,</v>

455
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.900
Indians who took things belonging to the Spaniards,

456
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:56.070
they were not accustomed to the concept of private ownership and gave freely of

457
00:26:56.071 --> 00:26:59.940
their own possessions were beheaded or burned at the stake.

458
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:04.930
This is crazy.
Las Casitas testimony was corroborated by other eyewitnesses.

459
00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:10.080
A group of Dominican friars addressing the Spanish monarchy and 1519 hoping for

460
00:27:10.201 --> 00:27:13.890
Spanish government to intercede,
told about unspeakable atrocities.

461
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.590
Children thrown the dogs to be devoured.

462
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:21.660
Newborn babies born to women,
prisoners flung into the jungle.
To die.

463
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:26.160
Ah,
this is Christopher Columbus.
I mean,
this is insane.
I mean,

464
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:28.650
whether or not this loss cost,
this guy,

465
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:32.580
just that Columbus is an asshole and I'm just going to fucking tell people and

466
00:27:32.581 --> 00:27:34.380
he's killing paintings.
I mean,

467
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.110
I don't think that that happened and I don't think he talked like that.

468
00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.900
Why would you make him talk like that?
Just a,

469
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.490
just a real country priest isn't house Deg Tyrese Shit.

470
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.180
How many people do you think Columbus Celt?
Oh,
who knows?

471
00:27:48.181 --> 00:27:51.630
Man obviously killed more than one,
right?
Yeah.

472
00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:56.340
It seems like he was a killer chopping arms off.
Yeah,

473
00:27:56.341 --> 00:27:57.270
it really did happen.

474
00:27:57.271 --> 00:28:00.180
If they cut people's arms off to get more gold out of them a whole week,

475
00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.770
they do it today,
baby.

476
00:28:01.771 --> 00:28:04.950
Every time they drop one of those fucking hell fire missiles on people,

477
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.900
they do worse than chop their arms off.

478
00:28:06.901 --> 00:28:10.470
They hamburger eyes them and they get money for that hell fire missile that's

479
00:28:10.471 --> 00:28:15.471
direct conversion of a human body into gold or whatever we use for gold.

480
00:28:15.751 --> 00:28:19.200
Now,
depending on where you're from,
well now it's even more crazy.
Right?

481
00:28:19.201 --> 00:28:22.850
Because you,
you don't have to actually see it take place.
Nope.
You know the,

482
00:28:22.851 --> 00:28:25.980
the drone thing is one of the weirdest things that a human being has ever

483
00:28:25.981 --> 00:28:29.040
invented.
The ability to fly something somewhere,

484
00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.210
launch these things from it and then you don't even have to see it.

485
00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:35.490
Like you're not even there using an oculus probably.

486
00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:40.050
Well that's probably going to happen,
right.
Who knows what kind of stuff.
Look,

487
00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:43.830
if they're working on Oculus rift for sure that government must be using that

488
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:46.680
because if they can map out the world,
think about this.

489
00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.350
If you could map out the world with a computer,

490
00:28:49.351 --> 00:28:52.620
if we get to the point where computers are so powerful that they can literally

491
00:28:52.621 --> 00:28:55.440
Google earth the entire planet,
every inch,
not,

492
00:28:55.441 --> 00:28:58.250
not inconceivable within our lifetime.
Right.

493
00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.920
If you think about what know current state of technology,

494
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:05.730
if they could get that program that into the rift and you could see the

495
00:29:05.731 --> 00:29:09.240
environment,
everything.
Yeah.
All as one.
Incredible.

496
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:13.650
I mean they go what that does to education just instead of like remember like

497
00:29:13.651 --> 00:29:16.260
science.
Science can be so fucking boring.

498
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.250
Even though what the teacher is talking about is some of the most insane things

499
00:29:20.251 --> 00:29:22.770
ever.
You know,
like the notion of a,

500
00:29:22.771 --> 00:29:25.170
even I think back then they didn't even know this,
but you know,

501
00:29:25.171 --> 00:29:28.500
the idea that I Adams uh,

502
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.650
function as particles and waves simultaneously,

503
00:29:31.651 --> 00:29:35.720
like weird shit like that or the idea amoeba describing it to me,

504
00:29:35.721 --> 00:29:39.120
but this giant blob that just kind of sucks things into itself.

505
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.070
It's so flat and boring when you hear someone talk about it.

506
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:46.840
<v 4>But if you've got a rift in your desk and you put that shit on and suddenly</v>

507
00:29:46.841 --> 00:29:50.350
you're looking at an Amoeba from the perspective of being much smaller than an

508
00:29:50.351 --> 00:29:53.920
Amoeba,
just some giant glistening thing.

509
00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:58.630
Watching it absorb something as though you're a yes.
Then suddenly it's like,

510
00:29:58.631 --> 00:30:02.260
Holy Shit,
this is an incredible planet wearing well,
you know,

511
00:30:02.261 --> 00:30:04.540
because you can only do so much with a description.

512
00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:06.100
That's one thing that it's going to do.

513
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:09.220
There's a lot of amazing thing that's going to do.
It's a really good point.

514
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.800
I never even thought of that.
Yeah.
Education,

515
00:30:11.801 --> 00:30:13.180
it's going to be really good for education.

516
00:30:13.181 --> 00:30:15.790
Really good for like training people to shoot.

517
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.310
I think it's going to be a really good for marksmanship.

518
00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.680
Well you know what the guy from the float lab has been doing,

519
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:25.600
he's been working on a technology that allows you to look at videos from inside

520
00:30:25.601 --> 00:30:28.030
the tank and he's patented I think,

521
00:30:28.031 --> 00:30:30.580
and he's kind of like all these different versions of it that he's been working

522
00:30:30.581 --> 00:30:31.160
on it.

523
00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:36.160
He calls it like the cellular into cid cellular influenced device and the idea

524
00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.680
is that in the darkness of the tank,

525
00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.920
the tank is so dark that you can,

526
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:46.430
you'll have this image in front of you with like the lowest light emission

527
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.290
possible coming from the screen and you'll be floating in the tank so you're not

528
00:30:50.291 --> 00:30:53.830
feeling your body and just the information is right in front of your face and

529
00:30:53.831 --> 00:30:54.220
it's,

530
00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:57.040
the light emission is so low that you actually can't even see the television.

531
00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:01.300
You only can see the image and you can watch documentaries.
That's super cool.

532
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:03.100
It's pretty bad ass.
Yeah,
that might be,

533
00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:08.460
that might be like a step on the way to this like rifting because obviously it

534
00:31:09.971 --> 00:31:12.790
can't give you the three d immersive technology feeling,

535
00:31:12.791 --> 00:31:16.760
but then the rift is not giving you floating.
Well it's not you,

536
00:31:16.761 --> 00:31:18.580
you don't get what the problem with the rift is.

537
00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.570
You're not experiencing the environment with your,

538
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:26.290
with your eye.
You're not feeling the touch of the environment really.

539
00:31:26.291 --> 00:31:29.080
You're not feeling like when you go outside,
do you feel the wind blow?

540
00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:33.730
You can smell,
you know,
the rift hasn't,
we can't hit that yet,

541
00:31:33.731 --> 00:31:38.731
but what the rift is just one piece of the puzzle leading us in the direction of

542
00:31:39.491 --> 00:31:44.120
full immersion into technology.
Well that's it dude.
Dude.
That's it.
The,

543
00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:44.621
what is it?

544
00:31:44.621 --> 00:31:48.580
His warehouses where people come and bring their rifts and you set up an

545
00:31:48.581 --> 00:31:53.581
environmental like in environmental reaction place where you have wind and

546
00:31:55.570 --> 00:32:00.570
leaves blow around and we have noises programmed into the walls and you're in

547
00:32:01.001 --> 00:32:05.200
this thing plugged into this machine that interacts with you.
Yes.
Yeah.

548
00:32:05.201 --> 00:32:09.520
That's the idea,
man.
It's,
it's,
it's,
um,
and I think it's going to,
you know,

549
00:32:09.521 --> 00:32:10.810
gradually get there,

550
00:32:10.811 --> 00:32:14.890
but you really just the idea of full immersion and the idea of like,

551
00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:18.130
how am I mean?
I don't know.
Can you talk,
I don't know what your audience is,

552
00:32:18.131 --> 00:32:22.030
but let's say it's over.
Let's say it's over a hundred thousand.

553
00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.650
Let's say it's over a hundred thousand.

554
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:29.190
Imagine sitting and putting on this fucking rift and looking out at 100,000

555
00:32:29.651 --> 00:32:30.880
people watching you.

556
00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.340
I don't know how many people are watching this stream right now.

557
00:32:33.341 --> 00:32:36.880
How many people are watching this dream to a few thousand million?
How many?

558
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:39.010
A couple thousand?
Probably 2000.

559
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:43.400
2000 if you could just look out at 2000 people.
Yeah,

560
00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:48.050
it'd be weird as far it would be amazing.
It'd be amazing.
And I,

561
00:32:48.051 --> 00:32:51.710
and I think there's,
if people worked,

562
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:53.810
I think that this is something we could actually make.

563
00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.620
It's probably going to happen whether they want to or not.
Well,

564
00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.580
I've see that's the thing I was thinking.
It's like,
well,

565
00:32:58.581 --> 00:33:02.960
someone's eventually going to make a podcast auditorium that works with the rift

566
00:33:02.961 --> 00:33:04.760
or at least works in three d space.

567
00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:08.300
Then I realized why not like be part of the thing that gets shipped moving in

568
00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:10.370
that direction.
I don't know how to code,

569
00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:15.320
but certainly like we have an audience of people who have coders within it and

570
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:20.590
know how to organize digital projects and could open source of thing that maybe

571
00:33:21.051 --> 00:33:22.310
works in second life.

572
00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:27.380
You some uses like emotion sensing technology to immediately transfer your

573
00:33:27.381 --> 00:33:28.730
gestures to your avatar.

574
00:33:28.731 --> 00:33:32.090
I think that's really important because other otherwise you just have the static

575
00:33:32.091 --> 00:33:34.910
thing that's limited to really shitty animations.

576
00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:40.160
It needs to be able to translate your hand movements and ultimately your smiles

577
00:33:40.161 --> 00:33:43.760
and frowns.
I think we're far away from that.
I don't think we're that far away,

578
00:33:43.761 --> 00:33:45.200
man.
Well,
I think if everyone,

579
00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.780
I think if everyone would just listen to your podcast of the people who like our

580
00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:52.960
programmers decided to work together.
We could be there in a couple of weeks.

581
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.810
They're probably already working on all this stuff because when I went to Nvidia

582
00:33:56.811 --> 00:34:00.190
for the show,
for the,
yeah,
the Scifi show,
there was,
um,

583
00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.580
a guy we met,
God,
I wish I could remember his name.
I apologize.
Uh,

584
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:08.420
very nice guy to give us a tour of the latest greatest technology that bridges

585
00:34:08.421 --> 00:34:13.010
that uncanny valley.
And it was incredible.
I mean the,
the,
the,

586
00:34:13.011 --> 00:34:17.120
what they can do now with mimicking human movement,
they can't get tongues.

587
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:19.930
Tongues don't come out right.
And uh,

588
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:23.360
like why it just because it's just too weird.
All right.

589
00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.960
It's your tongue's moving around.
Yeah.

590
00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.050
They're not so good with hair yet either.
Like full heads of hair.

591
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.670
Me If you're a woman either,

592
00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:35.850
but if you're a woman and you have beautiful hair falls out,

593
00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:39.500
they can't quite get that down.
Yeah.
That's pretty cool man.

594
00:34:39.501 --> 00:34:42.410
Cause there's a lot going on there,
man.
There's a lot going on.

595
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:47.240
Amazing amount of calculations,
but they're all,
they are very close.
Yeah.

596
00:34:47.241 --> 00:34:47.511
Man,

597
00:34:47.511 --> 00:34:52.511
we are moving in the direction of this happening and uh,

598
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
we and also moving the direction of being able to do comedy shows from your

599
00:34:58.761 --> 00:35:03.010
house with this kind of technology or you could like project a comedy show and

600
00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.990
uh,
uh,
uh,
virtual space.

601
00:35:05.991 --> 00:35:10.130
Second life already has a lot of this stuff.
The ability to do this.
It just,

602
00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:14.510
I don't think it's been refined to the point where it could,

603
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:20.450
it would be worth doing is it podcast because otherwise it's just too cartoony

604
00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:25.370
things sitting on a stage.
If also you would have to like ask people to,

605
00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.660
to join it and to buy it and to get in there and it doesn't really justify that

606
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:31.850
they don't need the rift.
You the rift,

607
00:35:31.851 --> 00:35:34.820
it would not be necessary for people because they could come and just like watch

608
00:35:34.821 --> 00:35:38.110
it on their computer screen.
Oh,
you know,
Ryan,
pull

609
00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:42.510
<v 0>this up,
pull up.
Uh,
Invidia face works.</v>

610
00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:44.940
Real time performance capture,

611
00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:48.980
face works.

612
00:35:48.981 --> 00:35:53.750
Is there a there I believe is their name,

613
00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:58.580
their proprietary name?
I guess for a what this thing does he got it?

614
00:35:58.581 --> 00:36:03.200
Yeah.
This way to see this.
This is fucking incredible.
This,

615
00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:07.850
this guy can move and talk and it's so God damn close.

616
00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:12.260
Yeah,
that's,
that's it.
That's so fucking crazy,
man.
Yeah.
Look,

617
00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.400
the cow fucking close.
That is,

618
00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:20.320
it's even weirder when you're seeing it in high def up close.

619
00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:25.480
It's really good.
It's bad ass.
It's really good.
But it look no tongue.

620
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:30.310
You don't see his tongue.
They can't get the tongue and he's bald.
So see,

621
00:36:30.311 --> 00:36:32.700
but even as like there's a weirdness to it.

622
00:36:32.701 --> 00:36:37.701
Just a little bit of weirdness to it still where you would be pretty sure that

623
00:36:37.841 --> 00:36:42.370
it wasn't a guy,
but if you are alone in a prison and that thing talk to you,

624
00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:46.330
you might actually have a friend.
He might actually like don't go anywhere.
Hey,

625
00:36:46.331 --> 00:36:47.480
stay with,
talk to me man.

626
00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.940
If it talked back like one day you're going to get a computer that's so smart,

627
00:36:51.941 --> 00:36:55.270
you're not even going to care that it's a computer.
Right?
If you have no friends,

628
00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.650
like in the future,

629
00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:00.460
everyone will have friends and you you'll be able to,

630
00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:04.900
you'll be able to judge people based on like how subservient they're robotic

631
00:37:04.901 --> 00:37:05.970
friends are.
You know,

632
00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:10.240
if you come over your house and you open the door and the robotic servants or on

633
00:37:10.241 --> 00:37:13.000
their knees with their mouth open and you're like,
what the fuck?
Oh,

634
00:37:13.001 --> 00:37:16.270
they didn't know I had company.
That's how you want to be greeted.

635
00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.440
You want your robotic servant to just on their knees with their mouth open as

636
00:37:20.441 --> 00:37:22.800
you come to the door and just fucked their face.
Oh Man.

637
00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:26.440
That's who wouldn't want that.
You wouldn't even have to feel bad about it.

638
00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:31.180
I guess it depends on what mood you're in when you come inside.
It also depends.

639
00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:35.800
See that that feeling of being on your knees and sucking a dick to someone

640
00:37:35.801 --> 00:37:38.350
that's like really exciting and that's something they want to do.

641
00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:42.070
So I'm saying is that if it's as if it's a bad thing for a person to do and

642
00:37:42.071 --> 00:37:43.690
that's why you're getting your robot to do it.

643
00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:46.720
Whereas there's some freaky people out there that would love that and there's

644
00:37:46.721 --> 00:37:50.140
nothing wrong with her,
right?
Yeah,
you can.
You don't need a robot today.

645
00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:54.070
There's people who will just,
it act like a robot and no,
it's not even that.

646
00:37:54.071 --> 00:37:57.160
It's people that like that they,
they'll,
they'll like to suck a dick.

647
00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:00.980
I like to get on their knees and like the whole naughtiness of it.
This,

648
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.490
this people that get off on that,
guys and girls,

649
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:08.530
so better off finding them then getting a robot as well.
My point cheaper.

650
00:38:08.531 --> 00:38:11.650
You don't have to charge him well and you never know man.
You know,

651
00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:16.270
people can be real expensive.
They won't rust.
That's well,
yeah,

652
00:38:16.271 --> 00:38:17.290
this might not rust either.

653
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:23.650
Jizzing in it all the time and it's going to throw it to be like,

654
00:38:23.651 --> 00:38:27.130
you're fucked.
All that sweet.
That's what keeps it alive.

655
00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.700
Think of this stinker,
your robot's a breath.

656
00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:32.920
He'd come over to your friend's house and he smelled their robots breath and you

657
00:38:32.921 --> 00:38:35.260
just know it's stomachs filled with old judges

658
00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.680
<v 1>testing boar or not.</v>

659
00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:42.070
Or it's like it's hungry for ges because it's battery acid.

660
00:38:42.071 --> 00:38:43.960
Stomach is burning through the lining.

661
00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:47.610
It was the last time you came inside your robot,
man.
You need to feed your robot.

662
00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:51.430
You have to come in them all the time.
You can't just not come in your robot.

663
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:54.730
If you ever smelled someone's breath,
it doesn't eat right.
Yes.

664
00:38:54.731 --> 00:38:57.160
If someone has a dietary thing,
sure they don't eat,

665
00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:01.030
they starve themselves correctly.
It's a really weird ketosis.

666
00:39:01.031 --> 00:39:03.070
Isn't that what we call it?
Some weird name for it.

667
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.890
People that have like complete empty stomachs for long periods of time,

668
00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:07.490
get some really funky breath shit,

669
00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:12.350
<v 3>man.
I told there was a girl I was seeing once and I told her no,
her mom,</v>

670
00:39:12.351 --> 00:39:14.870
I was like,
your mom's breast smells like the ocean.

671
00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.660
I didn't think it is popped out.
Right,

672
00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:22.770
<v 1>right.
PTOSIS.
Pull ahead on that video.
I'm Wa,</v>

673
00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:27.800
I was still watching that nvidia video and it gets even crazier at the end.

674
00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.500
I forgot about this.
They do a whole thing with lighting.

675
00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.770
This is going to blow you away.
This is what's really,

676
00:39:33.771 --> 00:39:35.660
really freaky about this technology.

677
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:39.650
The way they can move the light as if there was like a spotlight around it.

678
00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:43.460
Like watch as it goes further,
like much like three quarters of the way in

679
00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:50.780
oh three quarters of the way and not seven A's.
Three quarters.
There you go.

680
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:55.070
When you see the light,
like look at the,
look at the difference,
the variations,

681
00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:59.090
the light,
all the shit they can do now is shadows.
Super Cool.

682
00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.570
And they show you like what the Mesh is like underneath.

683
00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:08.090
<v 3>Praise God,
I'm so happy this is happening.
So credible.</v>

684
00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.080
<v 1>It's,
it's so hard for us to grasp it dude.</v>

685
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:15.820
It's happening right in front of our faces.
And we're like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I love,

686
00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:16.663
it's just normal.

687
00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:17.670
<v 3>I love it.</v>

688
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:22.670
You can go to Oculus rift.com and for 300 bucks you can get one of these things,

689
00:40:22.741 --> 00:40:27.270
man.
And I just ordered one [inaudible] man,

690
00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:32.190
they're irresistible like in and it's only gonna get better.

691
00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.430
It's only going to get better.
And plus you can mildly contribute to this.

692
00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:40.440
This is what's really cool about the rift.
A window at the new windows connect.

693
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:44.070
Um,
all these things like the corporation's open them,

694
00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:48.840
open them up for developers and like just let whoever can work on it,
work on it.

695
00:40:48.841 --> 00:40:51.350
And that's where all the innovation happens.
Yeah.
You know,

696
00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:53.970
which is why I'm saying if we created,

697
00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:58.800
all we need is three components of virtual space to do the podcast in uh,

698
00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:03.980
the motion sensing technology to in some way translate hand gestures and hand

699
00:41:04.201 --> 00:41:08.580
movements to the avatars and the virtual space and a way to access the space

700
00:41:08.581 --> 00:41:10.740
with a rift.
Those three components.

701
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:13.440
If we could figure out a way to merge those things together,

702
00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:17.730
then we could do the first podcast.
As far as I'm aware,

703
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.860
in a rift space.
Yeah.

704
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:22.730
<v 1>I think it should be possible.
I mean,
it only makes sense that we'd be able,</v>

705
00:41:22.731 --> 00:41:26.000
I mean the studio can be really simple,
right?
It's used to be an empty space.

706
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:28.990
This space.
Oh,
the space we in virtuals yeah.

707
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:31.490
Do you have to actually have a it does it have to be detailed?

708
00:41:31.491 --> 00:41:33.980
Does it have to be constructed?
I think will be the easiest

709
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.530
<v 3>thing because you could just build whatever you wanted in there.
I mean,</v>

710
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:41.060
on my website they have a Minecraft server that's like insane.

711
00:41:41.061 --> 00:41:44.930
The shit that they've built in there.
How do you build it with textures?
Yeah,

712
00:41:44.931 --> 00:41:46.430
they just construct weird,

713
00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:50.810
just weird things in buildings and temples and castles.

714
00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:54.440
So you could build the space.
Could be insane,
like whatever you want it.

715
00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:56.450
But that will,
that's the easiest part.

716
00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.300
I think the hardest part is the motion tracking.

717
00:41:59.301 --> 00:42:03.800
And I already heard that they've ported a second life with the re the re the

718
00:42:03.801 --> 00:42:08.150
rift can get into second life already.
Wow.
It's going to be so weird.
Brian.

719
00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:12.640
Turn vacation off though.
That is cool though,
because those,
those uh,

720
00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.990
bodies that he's looking at,
ah,

721
00:42:14.991 --> 00:42:17.990
those are these hyper realistic digital scans.

722
00:42:17.991 --> 00:42:19.670
Three d digital scans of naked people.

723
00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.250
<v 1>Brian has a video.
I saw that hand.
I know it's going up some dudes.</v>

724
00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:27.860
<v 3>No,
no,
no.
That's what I thought on.</v>

725
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:28.950
This is insane.
No,

726
00:42:28.951 --> 00:42:32.570
but that they apparently like getting really close to these hyperrealistic

727
00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:34.020
characters is uncomfortable.

728
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:35.110
<v 1>What is this?</v>

729
00:42:35.111 --> 00:42:40.111
This is nuts and we're seeing right now is a really insane glimpse at what the

730
00:42:40.541 --> 00:42:44.260
future is going to be.
A really insane glimpse.

731
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:46.090
This is some strange stuff.

732
00:42:46.091 --> 00:42:51.091
My friends were going to enter into a very strange new era.

733
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:56.810
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
It's very weird and it's weird to watch that guy minus the MHC,</v>

734
00:42:56.811 --> 00:42:57.320
which is,

735
00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:01.500
since it's such a strange thing to see someone just kind of just stick your

736
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:03.140
waiting in there empty apartment.

737
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:09.370
<v 1>Wow.
This is amazing.
Yup.
It's so God damn close.
Yeah.</v>

738
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:14.900
He's looking at,
this is incredible.
He got it.
He got onto a ladder,

739
00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:17.410
a step ladder and it changed his perspective.

740
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:21.300
Now he's looking in this woman's ear.
This is amazing.
Yeah.

741
00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:25.130
This is amazing.
Yeah.
Wow.

742
00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:26.990
<v 3>Yeah man.
That's what I'm saying.</v>

743
00:43:26.991 --> 00:43:31.850
We could look out and then virtual audience and do the podcast in front of a

744
00:43:31.851 --> 00:43:35.960
virtual audience in three d space and that will be fun.

745
00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:40.990
<v 1>This is going to be incredible.
This is going to be really incredible.</v>

746
00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:44.920
It's going to be terrifying,
man.
I mean incredible,

747
00:43:44.921 --> 00:43:49.390
but so alien from the life that we're living now,
it's curved Fox.

748
00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.550
<v 3>It looks exactly like a flags and could be,</v>

749
00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.160
it's like Kirk Fox had sex with wolverine.

750
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.260
It's probably going to happen,
right.

751
00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:06.220
Kirk's Fox no longer having sex with wolverine.
Yeah,

752
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:13.750
no.
This,
uh,
this,
this rift becoming like a new version of reality.
Yes.

753
00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:18.170
Yes.
And,
and it won't just be games like they already have apparently.
Um,

754
00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:22.270
let's see.
Brian,
see if you can find the gete rift Ghia,
teen experience.

755
00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:27.430
They apparently have an experience of getting your head cut off.
Oh,
you put,
yeah.

756
00:44:27.431 --> 00:44:31.680
So it's like,
it won't just be games.
There'll be experiences that you can like,

757
00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:32.070
you

758
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.280
<v 4>know,
like those guys who fly in wing suits,
you know,</v>

759
00:44:35.281 --> 00:44:40.190
it could be like experienced that Pov of being in a wingsuit or,
you know,

760
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:45.020
experience what it's like to,
you know,
goes flying office,

761
00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:48.900
uh,
for a ship into orbit.
Like in that movie that's coming out.
Yeah.
That's it.

762
00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:53.250
Yeah.
It simulates a execution.

763
00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:57.630
You can look around to everyone watching you.
Oh yeah.

764
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.800
But see,

765
00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:02.130
see what's interesting about the rift is you could see how like the Ndis there

766
00:45:02.131 --> 00:45:07.131
becomes this need for like blocks and actual shapes in three d and in our

767
00:45:07.411 --> 00:45:09.720
reality to really pull it off,

768
00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:14.730
this is may actually giving me anxiety.
Yeah,
it's,
well,
it's,
you know,

769
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:18.000
this is definitely the one of the,
um,

770
00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:21.480
it's the emergence of the great tech.
No,
Jesus here.

771
00:45:21.481 --> 00:45:25.950
That's what you're seeing the extrusion of this insane new reality into our,

772
00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.990
uh,
you know,
what's going to become really,

773
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:32.130
really popular is fat chicks because then you'll be able to put like the shit on

774
00:45:32.131 --> 00:45:35.580
and then like have it like be like Jenna Jamison or someone like that and the

775
00:45:35.581 --> 00:45:38.820
whole time or just on him like this blob of a woman,
kind of like a shape.

776
00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:42.180
That's an interesting point man.
Because the physical form,

777
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:46.470
it will begin to become less and less important where this technology almost

778
00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:50.940
nothing,
almost nothing if people choose to live in.
Well,
here's the,

779
00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.530
here's the real crazy one.

780
00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:57.150
If that gets to the point where it can figure out how to mimic actual physical

781
00:45:57.151 --> 00:46:01.290
feelings,
intimacy,
touch,
sex,
things along those lines,

782
00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:05.820
then it'll all be about get really good at that and it would almost be like a

783
00:46:05.821 --> 00:46:10.140
call to abandon the material world.
Yep.
Yes.
Christ.

784
00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:13.440
That's a matrix shit,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

785
00:46:13.441 --> 00:46:18.300
I know we're just talking nonsense.
I don't,
Holy Shit.
It's not really nonsense.

786
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:22.710
There's already,
I mean,
you've seen what's already happening.
It's not nonsense.

787
00:46:22.711 --> 00:46:23.161
In fact,

788
00:46:23.161 --> 00:46:28.161
it's almost like knowing that this tsunami is about to come pouring over our

789
00:46:28.411 --> 00:46:32.040
reality,
which is a tsunami of telescoping realities,

790
00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:37.370
infinite little mini digital wormholes that go off into all these various

791
00:46:37.441 --> 00:46:42.441
designer based realities that allow you to be whatever it is you want to allow

792
00:46:42.781 --> 00:46:44.880
you to be whatever form that you want.

793
00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:49.350
When I watched the video that was playing on the screen and listened to what you

794
00:46:49.351 --> 00:46:51.900
were talking about,
listen to your words,

795
00:46:51.901 --> 00:46:53.550
the way you were saying what you were saying,

796
00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:59.120
it felt to me like the narration of the beginning of an apocalyptic Scifi movie.

797
00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.910
I'm not bullshitting.
It totally did.
I was looking at the video and I was saying,

798
00:47:02.911 --> 00:47:03.510
man,

799
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:08.510
this is really like a scene in a movie where people describe how the world

800
00:47:08.791 --> 00:47:12.750
changed because of this seemingly innocent piece of technology and you're just

801
00:47:12.751 --> 00:47:16.890
completely changed everything.
Yeah,
well,
you know,
man,
it's just another,

802
00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:21.030
it's another paradigm and it's just more freedom for humanity because we're,

803
00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:25.440
we are so limited right now,
but maybe not my,

804
00:47:25.441 --> 00:47:29.740
my point being that the real issue is like,
what do people say television?

805
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.800
<v 1>Oh,
people just sit in front of the TV eight hours a day.</v>

806
00:47:32.801 --> 00:47:34.900
They're just sitting in front of the TV not doing nothing.

807
00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:37.720
And if they're not doing that,
they're playing video games.

808
00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:39.580
All they're doing is staring off.

809
00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:42.400
But what is what is really going on while you're watching TV?

810
00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:46.690
What's really going on?
When you're playing video games,
you're not in this world.

811
00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:50.740
That's right.
You're in another world.
You might just be sitting down,

812
00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:53.110
but that's the point is that you've given up your body,

813
00:47:53.111 --> 00:47:57.880
you've given up all your movement to exist in a world that's only sight and

814
00:47:57.881 --> 00:48:01.360
sound,
just just those two,
just those two dimensions.

815
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:05.020
But if we can offer you a more compelling world,

816
00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:08.890
it's completely three dimensional.
And in fact,

817
00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:13.580
eventually when the technology arises can affect your moods and your way you

818
00:48:13.581 --> 00:48:16.810
feel,
and you can get Billy bad ass at it,

819
00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:22.020
just like you are at fucking Madden football and be the ultimate person in this

820
00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:25.030
new dimension.
When you just can't get your life in order.

821
00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.770
Here in the wrangler world,

822
00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:31.660
you're just a mess trying to interact with people.
You know,
maybe you're,
you're,

823
00:48:31.661 --> 00:48:36.661
you're physically frail or small or a feminine or picked on or bullied or what

824
00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:40.090
happened.
But that doesn't mean shit.

825
00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:44.320
You can literally recreate yourself with your mind and your will in the wrist.

826
00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:45.440
<v 3>Yeah,
it will.</v>

827
00:48:45.441 --> 00:48:50.441
The focus will go to your personality and your ability to be creative.

828
00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:53.930
Your mind,
creativity will become,
uh,

829
00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:58.040
one of the most important facets if this new,
a renaissance,

830
00:48:58.041 --> 00:48:59.150
this digital renaissance.

831
00:48:59.151 --> 00:49:03.860
And it will be your ability to manifest environment and,

832
00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.073
um,

833
00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:09.980
situations that are unique and creative and expressive.
You know?

834
00:49:09.981 --> 00:49:12.980
And if you can't do that,
you will seem,
you'll,
who knows,

835
00:49:12.981 --> 00:49:16.100
you'll probably just have like,
you'll,
I don't know.

836
00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.740
I think everyone's going to benefit from this technology.

837
00:49:18.741 --> 00:49:19.670
And I do know what you mean.

838
00:49:19.671 --> 00:49:24.671
There's a swooning feeling when you consider the that for the first time,

839
00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:29.900
um,
and,
and,
and human in the history of humanity,

840
00:49:29.901 --> 00:49:34.550
we are going to be able to travel to alternate dimensions,

841
00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:39.490
uh,
and,
and be fully immersed within them.
Cause you know,
we,

842
00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:43.460
our minds are made to do this like our minds,
when you read a book,

843
00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:47.510
your mind will do the same thing.
You will go into this space of the book.

844
00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:48.171
It has to,

845
00:49:48.171 --> 00:49:51.350
it's a little more difficult and you'll have to sort of learn to be a reader.

846
00:49:51.351 --> 00:49:54.440
But once you get into a book,
you're in that reality.

847
00:49:54.441 --> 00:49:59.000
You are experiencing that reality.
You're feeling that reality.
You're hypnotized.

848
00:49:59.001 --> 00:50:01.730
It's a hypnotic state.
If it's a good book,
if it's a good book,

849
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:06.180
when you're watching TV,
it's the same thing.
Video Games,
it's the same thing.

850
00:50:06.181 --> 00:50:09.380
And in all of these things,
what's happening is your identity,

851
00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:14.650
the idea of who you are is no longer existing in this reality but has been

852
00:50:14.661 --> 00:50:17.720
projected and do a different reality.

853
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:20.530
<v 1>And the reality of imagination interacting with someone else's.
Yeah,</v>

854
00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:25.780
<v 3>that's it.
That's exactly it.
Our identity itself are,
we aren't,
you know,</v>

855
00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:29.480
this is like the first things they tell when you get in the eastern religion.

856
00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:32.690
Eastern philosophy is a,
you are not your body.

857
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:37.280
That's the first thing they try to teach you is that your identification with

858
00:50:37.281 --> 00:50:41.660
your bodies.
In fact,
one of the great causes of suffering,
uh,

859
00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:46.370
for a human being is the idea that you identify with yourself and you then begin

860
00:50:46.371 --> 00:50:47.930
to think that the self is permanent.

861
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:51.560
And inevitably you find out that that is not the case at all.

862
00:50:51.561 --> 00:50:55.280
When your hair starts falling out and you start getting old and your parents
die,

863
00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:59.630
you begin to realize like,
Oh shit,
we're all crumbling and dissolving.

864
00:50:59.631 --> 00:51:02.330
And if you think you are the thing that's dissolving and crumbling,

865
00:51:02.331 --> 00:51:06.410
and if you think you are the thing that's going to turn to dust,
then um,

866
00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:10.510
you will suffer a great deal and feeling a tremendous amount of anxiety and,

867
00:51:10.511 --> 00:51:14.780
and um,
but the idea is well that's not your,
not your body.

868
00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:16.220
You're just identified with your body.

869
00:51:16.221 --> 00:51:17.780
And the same way that when you read a book,

870
00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:21.740
you identify with the characters in the book and become fixated in that place.

871
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:26.910
We also identify with the character of ourself and you get so stuck in this idea

872
00:51:26.911 --> 00:51:30.560
of this is who I am.
I'm Dunkin or I'm Joe or I'm Brian.

873
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:34.160
And that's when you find yourself getting in arguments and fights,

874
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:38.960
sticking up for ways that of being that you don't even believe in any way that's

875
00:51:38.961 --> 00:51:43.220
identification with the self and it causes a lot of problems.
So this is uh,

876
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:47.260
another version of a,
the self being transferred to um,

877
00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:49.520
alternate states,
alternate identities.

878
00:51:49.521 --> 00:51:54.521
I mean what's more exciting than the idea that you can assume a brand new form

879
00:51:54.711 --> 00:51:58.820
of brand new life.
No one knows who you are.
You can do whatever you want,

880
00:51:58.821 --> 00:52:02.390
completely new,
create whatever history you want for yourself.

881
00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:05.990
You're not locked into this one.
Meet Avatar.

882
00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:10.160
<v 1>Not only that,
but you really are that person in the world.</v>

883
00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:14.030
Like your,
your material world is inconsequential.

884
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:17.810
Like if you were a loser in your material world for most of your life,

885
00:52:17.811 --> 00:52:20.900
if you did time in prison,
if you,
you know,

886
00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:25.460
beat up your ex girlfriend and you went to jail for it and you know,

887
00:52:25.461 --> 00:52:29.600
and you got raped in jail all,
what am I doing?
I'm going to just keep going here.

888
00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:33.740
You've got an a traffic accident and you've washed your left knee.
My point is,

889
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:36.410
in that world you're not,
you're not that guy.

890
00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:39.830
You're a totally different things like your,
this thing that you create.

891
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:43.870
<v 3>You're born again.
Joe,
did you see this video of this drunk guy trying to do it?</v>

892
00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:44.830
A roller

893
00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:45.723
<v 5>coaster?</v>

894
00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.470
Tavis his computer.

895
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:06.310
He's just hanging on right now is just the beginning where it gets crazy.
Yeah.

896
00:53:06.311 --> 00:53:08.200
This is right where it gets crazy when it gets down to

897
00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:15.010
how drunk is this cat?

898
00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:23.290
Wow.
That's incredible,

899
00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:30.613
dude.

900
00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:37.380
Holy Shit.
That's incredible.

901
00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:43.100
<v 3>That's it.
That's it.
I don't know if drunk is what that guy was and he was like,</v>

902
00:53:43.101 --> 00:53:46.970
he's been snorting meth.
I just think it's the experience itself.
Well,

903
00:53:46.971 --> 00:53:49.580
that's what they say.
The experience is pretty intense,
man.

904
00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:55.230
<v 1>This week I went to Disneyland,
took the,
took the wee ones to Disney land blood.</v>

905
00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:00.310
Yeah.
Were there,
it was hot as fuck dog got so dehydrated and uh,

906
00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:04.350
then I had a massive headache the next day cause I did just didn't drink enough

907
00:54:04.351 --> 00:54:07.020
water.
Um,
actually it made me really tired.

908
00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:10.950
Like Saturday I was exhausted because of it.
My fucking head was pounding.

909
00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:13.590
I tried to work out and I couldn't,
it was just a,

910
00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:16.350
when you're out in the hundred degree temperature all day,

911
00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:19.260
like from like 10:00 AM all day,
you don't really,

912
00:54:19.261 --> 00:54:20.940
you're having fun because it's Disneyland.

913
00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:24.540
You don't realize you're just drenched with sweat,
you know?

914
00:54:24.541 --> 00:54:28.470
And I only drank a couple with those fucking smart wars.
But,
uh,
anyway,

915
00:54:28.471 --> 00:54:32.240
my point was I went on this thing on great adventure,
California adventure,

916
00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:35.490
whatever it is.
Yeah.
It's called a soaring over California.

917
00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:40.230
It's worth going there and waiting in line and doing it over and over and over

918
00:54:40.231 --> 00:54:44.120
and over.
And now really it's fogging incredible.
What is,

919
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:48.810
it's a giant screen that you fly into.
This is what happens.

920
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.450
You sit down,
it's called soaring over California.

921
00:54:51.451 --> 00:54:56.430
So it's basically this three dimensional ride.
We sore all over,
uh,
the,
you know,

922
00:54:56.460 --> 00:55:00.480
those mountains and the ocean,
the redwood trees and shit like that.

923
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:02.400
You sit in this thing,
they,
they,

924
00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:07.490
they strap you in and then the machine lifts up and pushes you forward over this

925
00:55:07.801 --> 00:55:09.960
giant concave screen.

926
00:55:09.961 --> 00:55:14.010
So you can look down the screen projects down to projects forward and it

927
00:55:14.011 --> 00:55:18.390
projects up and it projects all around you.
It's a,
it's a massive,
massive screen.

928
00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:21.480
And as you're,
the only problem is you can actually see the grid.

929
00:55:21.481 --> 00:55:23.310
So you'd probably try not to see the grid,

930
00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:27.090
but it's not perfect if they could figure out how to do it,
update it.

931
00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:32.040
So there's no grid,
there's no actual lines.
But my God,
this is what it's like.

932
00:55:32.041 --> 00:55:36.270
You fly down above these people kayaking and these people skiing in the

933
00:55:36.271 --> 00:55:39.570
mountains.
It's not going to do it any justice,
what you're looking at.

934
00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:40.441
But when your,

935
00:55:40.441 --> 00:55:43.830
when your feet are dangling and you're hanging over this thing and you're

936
00:55:43.831 --> 00:55:47.850
looking down,
it's amazing.
And it's so cool.
It's,

937
00:55:47.851 --> 00:55:52.170
it feels great.
It feels like you're flying.
You're like,
ah,
yeah,

938
00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:56.060
<v 3>yeah man,
I can't wait for this.
It's going to be so cool.</v>

939
00:55:56.061 --> 00:55:59.240
And it's not just like aside from like entertaining stoners,

940
00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:04.400
it's also going to be really bad ass for people who are paralyzed and for people

941
00:56:04.401 --> 00:56:06.830
who aren't able to get out,
you know,

942
00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:09.410
because of physical limitations there.

943
00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:13.770
This is going to free a lot of people from shitty existences man.
And,

944
00:56:13.771 --> 00:56:17.480
and that's something that's quite beautiful about it cause if you've happened to

945
00:56:17.481 --> 00:56:19.370
have popped out in the wrong body,

946
00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:23.470
you know you don't get to know what it's like to ski or you don't get to know

947
00:56:23.471 --> 00:56:23.980
what it's like to

948
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:24.641
<v 4>ride a bike.</v>

949
00:56:24.641 --> 00:56:28.330
And a lot of people are going to get to experience that and that is really

950
00:56:28.331 --> 00:56:31.510
beautiful when I'm worried about it,
I'm not necessarily worried about,

951
00:56:31.511 --> 00:56:36.511
but at least I'm apprehensive or Lisa have my mind open to the possibility is

952
00:56:36.851 --> 00:56:40.600
that that's going to be more enticing than regular life to the point where

953
00:56:40.601 --> 00:56:44.140
people are going to abandon regular life.
Like a real matrix scenario.

954
00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:48.340
Is that good?
Yes.
It's going to be more people not going outside.

955
00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:51.700
To me mark that shoulder and it's going to be,
no,
it's going to be,
you know what?

956
00:56:51.701 --> 00:56:54.010
It's going to be less fucking cars on the road.

957
00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:59.270
And you know we have too many people carousing around and worldwide and they're

958
00:56:59.891 --> 00:57:02.200
not doing a great job.
They're polluting shit.

959
00:57:02.201 --> 00:57:07.090
They leave their god Damn Mcdonald's bags all over the place and cigarette butts

960
00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:11.070
let them float into Narnia and exist there for the rest of their lives.

961
00:57:11.070 --> 00:57:15.100
So why do we need them parading around in the national parks and the streets?

962
00:57:15.101 --> 00:57:19.180
Let them incubate and their shadow little apartments.
What's the big deal?

963
00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:23.800
Cause it sounds like the apocalypse,
it's the apocalypse for nobody.

964
00:57:23.801 --> 00:57:26.320
It's this is the,
this is the segment coming man.

965
00:57:26.321 --> 00:57:29.710
It's going to be the apocalypse to clear out the malls.

966
00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:31.810
I feel like it's the apocalypse

967
00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:35.260
is going to clear out the most and was going to buy anything.

968
00:57:35.261 --> 00:57:38.820
I went to sit at home and fucking,
well I think there'll be no buying things.

969
00:57:38.821 --> 00:57:41.680
Well,
a certain point in time,
everything you'll have will be virtual.

970
00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:44.470
Well you'll use matter as simulators.
So like what Matt,

971
00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:48.040
what you'll do is these three d printers is,
there's a great video it,

972
00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:52.720
if you look up Elan Musk,
um,
I don't know,
three d printer,

973
00:57:52.721 --> 00:57:56.500
I think there's a really cool video or he shows out him building an engine part

974
00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:00.700
by like modeling this thing in three d space and then printing it out in a

975
00:58:00.701 --> 00:58:04.960
titanium or some kind of three d printer that uses a metallic alloy.

976
00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:08.650
It's just beautiful.
Yeah,
that's really fucking scary movie.

977
00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:13.480
What a bunch of people who are addicted to this virtual reality games get stuck

978
00:58:13.481 --> 00:58:14.860
in the virtual reality game.

979
00:58:15.130 --> 00:58:19.450
They're addicted to it and they keep getting home invaded by people who aren't

980
00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:23.110
just want their shit.
And you know,
these,
these,

981
00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:28.170
these carefree geeks have to fight for their lives to get away from these angry

982
00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:33.070
hood apocalyptic future.
So easy to rob people.

983
00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:37.180
You just walk in there like gesturing around you.
Just take your TV,

984
00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:41.330
take anything you want.
I won't probably won't be TVs anymore,
you know,

985
00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.510
think of this game.
Here's one of the outlaws.

986
00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:46.840
They're going to have to start outlawing certain types of games once that

987
00:58:46.841 --> 00:58:48.570
uncanny valley goes away.
So that,

988
00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:53.050
let's just imagine that the technology has gotten to the place where VR reality

989
00:58:53.051 --> 00:58:56.440
and our reality are indistinguishable.
Think of a game that starts,

990
00:58:56.441 --> 00:58:58.150
the moment you turn the game on,

991
00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:02.050
the game starts by you turning the game back off again.

992
00:59:02.410 --> 00:59:05.860
So when you turn the game on,
you think that you've turned,

993
00:59:05.861 --> 00:59:08.980
that you've decided to turn the game off and now you're existing in a virtual

994
00:59:08.981 --> 00:59:12.070
reality inside of video game,
but you think it's your real life.

995
00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:15.820
You don't realize that you've gone,
you're,
you're still in the game.

996
00:59:16.330 --> 00:59:18.250
That's going to be the problem.
It's like it'll start,

997
00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:22.160
there will be games that you into thinking

998
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:26.000
<v 2>that you are in your living room,
that you didn't even start playing it.</v>

999
00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:29.970
You'll look down and see the goggles sitting there.
You know what,

1000
00:59:29.971 --> 00:59:31.570
if like it had a camera on the,

1001
00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:35.960
on the front and then so like it looks like we're in this room and then somebody

1002
00:59:35.961 --> 00:59:39.170
opens the door that that doesn't exist.
You know what I mean?

1003
00:59:39.171 --> 00:59:42.500
So word adds things to your real life and you could just walk it around,

1004
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:46.040
walk around because it's plugged into your iPhone or your future or something

1005
00:59:46.041 --> 00:59:48.140
like that.
Yes.
You're walking around in the real world.

1006
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:52.900
The half the shit have to shit's not real.
Yeah,
it's very possible.

1007
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:54.050
It's going to happen,
man,

1008
00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:57.950
and that's when we're going to have these amazing court cases where it's like,

1009
00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:01.400
your honor,
I thought the little girl was in a game.

1010
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:05.900
That's why I threw her in the alligator pit.
Oh God.

1011
01:00:05.901 --> 01:00:09.020
That's why I eat the mushroom.
Yeah.

1012
01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:15.070
Well there will be no illegal drugs by the time the other half of the band and

1013
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.750
all that,
there was no one around for fucking police keeping,

1014
01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:19.790
like take whatever you can get your hands on.

1015
01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:22.160
It used to be like freely cooking meth.
Right.

1016
01:00:22.161 --> 01:00:26.060
And like a few blocks from the fucking road was pulled over on a trail or

1017
01:00:26.061 --> 01:00:29.090
smoking like crazy.
Nobody cares anymore.
No one knows.

1018
01:00:29.091 --> 01:00:32.990
Like you're almost always going to have to ask her,
you will this game.

1019
01:00:32.991 --> 01:00:35.860
Are we in the world one?
Which world are we in?
Oh God.

1020
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:37.760
What's your favorite designer?
Reality.

1021
01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:41.090
Speaking of a special effects and you know,

1022
01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.420
the ability to recreate worlds.
I watched some old school,

1023
01:00:44.421 --> 01:00:47.870
twilight zone's last night,
which ones watched two of them.

1024
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:52.520
I watched a nightmare at 20,000 feet and I watched um,

1025
01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:56.780
the second one that I don't remember the name of it is the guy had an eval dummy

1026
01:00:56.930 --> 01:01:00.380
who told them what to do.
Yeah.
Have you seen that one?
You need to see that one.

1027
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:03.060
I think I have seen that one yet.
But it's been awhile.

1028
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:07.140
<v 0>I forget his name.
I forgot the,
the dummies name,
but it's uh,</v>

1029
01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:14.140
I dunno,
but it's incredible.
It was amazing cause it's,
it's like,

1030
01:01:14.141 --> 01:01:18.160
uh,
it's a period piece.
You know,
it's like a time capsule.

1031
01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:21.100
It's not just,
you're not,
I mean,
first of all,

1032
01:01:21.130 --> 01:01:25.780
like William Shatner is about to light up on the plane and there's a no smoking

1033
01:01:25.781 --> 01:01:29.080
sign.
And the wife says to him,
honey,
don't like that.

1034
01:01:29.081 --> 01:01:30.520
Now wait till we get in the air.

1035
01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.650
And you're like,
what?
Like that's normal honey.

1036
01:01:38.651 --> 01:01:40.420
Don't like the wait till we get in the air.

1037
01:01:40.421 --> 01:01:44.360
And they had curtains in front of the windows.
Ah,

1038
01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:48.430
that's a good puppet there.
And it was a,
uh,
an airplane.

1039
01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:53.390
Look with propellers.
It was a propeller plane in 1963,
man.

1040
01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:59.680
And it was the worst special effects you've ever seen in your life.

1041
01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:04.630
The,
the,
the Gremlin that's on the wing of the plane is fucking hilarious.

1042
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:08.260
He looks like he's from Yoga,
Gaba.
And I'm not kidding you pull that up.

1043
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:12.970
Pull up the Gremlin.
Uh,
I mean,
it's so bad,
but it was awesome.

1044
01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:17.470
I was loving it.
I was like a little child,
like giggling at the TV.

1045
01:02:17.770 --> 01:02:21.390
It was amazing that William Shatner,
right?
Yeah.

1046
01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.290
There's a man on the wig of this plane

1047
01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:29.220
and like be a Kremlin.
It was awesome.

1048
01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:30.930
It was awesome because,

1049
01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:35.400
because of the fact that it all sort of fell into that time period.

1050
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:39.990
You almost felt like you yourself were in that time period watching it.

1051
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:42.870
It's,
it's really good.

1052
01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:48.090
<v 2>Oh,
come on.
That totally looks like Yo.
Gabba.</v>

1053
01:02:48.091 --> 01:02:52.110
Gabba it's incredible.
And wait til he gets close up.

1054
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:56.250
There's a closeup of watch this.
Are you fucking kidding me?

1055
01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.290
That is fucking scary.

1056
01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.080
<v 0>Ramblin.
Oh,
that's right.</v>

1057
01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:07.200
He calls over the lady every time he calls over the lady,
look,
I don't allow,
oh,

1058
01:03:07.201 --> 01:03:10.050
he's right there.
He flies over and lands.

1059
01:03:10.051 --> 01:03:13.290
He sticks his hands and their propellers.
He's lifting up the shit.

1060
01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:18.320
It's such a great episode and it's all about William Shatner is getting on the

1061
01:03:19.201 --> 01:03:23.550
plane for the first time since recovering in a mental hospital hospital with his

1062
01:03:23.551 --> 01:03:26.460
nervous breakdown.
Right.
His wife has had to take care of the kids.

1063
01:03:26.461 --> 01:03:30.060
He feels like a total coward.
He can't believe this happened,
but he's vowed,

1064
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:34.620
honey.
MMM,
I'm fine now.
I'm not a coward anymore.
I got it together,

1065
01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:39.390
but there really is a fucking man and the wing of the plane.
That is bad luck.

1066
01:03:39.450 --> 01:03:42.310
It's just that man fucking with them.
That is bad.

1067
01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:48.480
It's amazing.
It's so good.
It's so fun.

1068
01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:53.330
It's so fun.
It's such a fucking fun movie or

1069
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:58.240
<v 2>Oh hell yeah.
It is.
Oh,
that's not a good,
watch this.
Look at this.</v>

1070
01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:02.450
He opens the window.
You could.
You could just do that.
I'm planes.

1071
01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:05.170
You can open the windows.
I don't want to tell anybody who would have happened.

1072
01:04:05.171 --> 01:04:06.640
I want to give any spoilers.

1073
01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:08.760
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1074
01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:13.110
<v 0>Oh bad.
Look at that outfit.
The outfit so bad.</v>

1075
01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:19.590
<v 2>That's so cool.
So credible.</v>

1076
01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:22.560
<v 0>Ah,
man.
That's a great app.
Yeah.</v>

1077
01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:27.220
Though all the twilight zones were amazing.
The one that,
uh,

1078
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:29.430
I really thought about you though was the dummy one.

1079
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:32.310
Evil dolls are my specialty.

1080
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:38.610
Yeah.
It was fun.
It was fun to watch two of them last night.
I was like,
wow.

1081
01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:42.840
It's like,
it's so strange when you think that that was what,
60 years ago was it?

1082
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:46.650
No,
not even.
I didn't even 60 years ago.
It was like 50 something.

1083
01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:48.500
63 is that what it is?

1084
01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:53.870
<v 2>51 years ago,
man,
it was not long ago.
It's 51 years ago.</v>

1085
01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:59.000
Yeah.
Not Very long ago.
And look how far we've come.
That's crazy.
That's crazy.

1086
01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:02.500
That's hard to believe.
It's 2000 yeah,

1087
01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:04.880
2013 what the fuck?

1088
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:09.380
It's very interesting and I love that this is a,
you know,
this,
this stuff is,

1089
01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.090
people are mostly unaware of it.

1090
01:05:11.091 --> 01:05:13.750
Like a lot of people that I talk to you or mentioned it to,

1091
01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:18.220
they have no idea about any of this stuff that's coming.
It's like so

1092
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:23.220
<v 3>in the periphery somehow that people aren't aware of the rise of three d</v>

1093
01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:28.370
printers.
People aren't aware of the new gesture based,
uh,

1094
01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:32.020
uh,
technology that's coming out.
You know,
they know that there's a connect,

1095
01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:35.080
but they don't realize that pretty soon you're going to be able to model.
I mean,

1096
01:05:35.081 --> 01:05:40.081
imagine just like having some digital clay that you can model into some thing,

1097
01:05:40.691 --> 01:05:43.210
whatever it was you wanted,
you know,
whatever the thing is,

1098
01:05:43.211 --> 01:05:46.870
you want a little knife or a,
uh,
you know,
and a spoon,

1099
01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.610
whatever little tools,

1100
01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:53.170
and then you could immediately print that out and something in your living room

1101
01:05:53.171 --> 01:05:58.110
or something in your house could determine what alloy you wanted to use that

1102
01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.560
that's totally going to happen.

1103
01:05:59.561 --> 01:06:03.430
I remember when I was watching Star Trek,

1104
01:06:03.431 --> 01:06:06.970
the new generation way back when they have those fucking matter as simulators

1105
01:06:06.971 --> 01:06:09.550
that I always thought,
man,
what would that do to society?

1106
01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:14.830
If you could immediately create anything that you could think of in real,

1107
01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:18.280
in this reality.
What's that?
What's that gonna do?

1108
01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:22.960
How are they gonna keep pirates from pirating phones and pirates from pirating

1109
01:06:23.410 --> 01:06:25.840
computers or whatever.
The thing is you want.

1110
01:06:26.110 --> 01:06:30.460
You can you can or guns that's already happening.
You know,
three d,

1111
01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:34.240
three d printing guns.
You can just print your bullets printed gun.

1112
01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:37.160
<v 0>Can you print bullets?
I think you can print the shells.</v>

1113
01:06:37.161 --> 01:06:41.390
You'd have to get the gun powder.
Oh,
can you print shells?

1114
01:06:41.391 --> 01:06:43.380
You can make shells on a plastic shells.
Really?

1115
01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.180
<v 3>No,
this is going to have to be metal.</v>

1116
01:06:45.181 --> 01:06:49.110
But that a printer that Ilan Musk is using in that video he's telling you about

1117
01:06:49.111 --> 01:06:53.850
it.
Prints and metallic alloys.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
That's,
you know,

1118
01:06:53.851 --> 01:06:55.530
that's an inevitability to,
it's just,

1119
01:06:55.590 --> 01:06:59.580
those things are probably not going to be accessible to the consumer for a

1120
01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:03.330
couple of weeks.
For a couple of weeks.
Printing,
skin printing,
skin

1121
01:07:04.830 --> 01:07:07.350
<v 0>gone to combine skin with spider silk.</v>

1122
01:07:07.351 --> 01:07:12.000
They've already begun work and trying to combine human skin with spider silk and

1123
01:07:12.001 --> 01:07:13.260
they believe they're going to be able to do it.

1124
01:07:13.261 --> 01:07:16.350
They're going to be able to make bulletproof skin.
Wow.
That's awesome.

1125
01:07:16.351 --> 01:07:18.120
They're going to be able to fillet you,

1126
01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:22.830
pull your skin off and then spray some bulletproof skin all over you and you'll,

1127
01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:26.430
you'll have the face of a 20 year old God.
Yeah.

1128
01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:29.730
It would be just perfect and wonderful.
Still sweat though.

1129
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.060
What the spider spider skin.
Maybe you only have to,

1130
01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:36.180
you can only have at certain spots,
like where are you really vulnerable?

1131
01:07:36.181 --> 01:07:37.050
Like around your neck.

1132
01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:41.160
Like you need to like be like you need like a certain amount of your body open

1133
01:07:41.370 --> 01:07:45.780
to perspire him.
Does that make any sense?
Yeah,
it makes a lot of fucking sense.

1134
01:07:45.810 --> 01:07:47.910
Well then they'll figure out how to make it so it does sweat.

1135
01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:52.980
They'll make it exactly like human skin.
Just have this incredible material.
Yeah.

1136
01:07:52.981 --> 01:07:57.660
There's also that the idea that you're going to be able to have synthetic red

1137
01:07:57.661 --> 01:08:01.650
blood cells so that you can run faster or unfair.

1138
01:08:01.651 --> 01:08:03.510
There are without having to take a break.

1139
01:08:03.570 --> 01:08:06.750
Isn't it amazing that one of the most powerful things,

1140
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:10.650
pound for pound known to man is made by a spider.

1141
01:08:11.550 --> 01:08:16.010
How evil are fucking spiders.
Think about how small they are and all

1142
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:21.010
<v 2>they have to do is just jump on top of you and spray you with this sticky shit</v>

1143
01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:25.850
that you cannot get away from you.
There's no way you can get away.

1144
01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:29.270
And then they are done.
They wait to eat.
You sometimes are spiders,

1145
01:08:29.271 --> 01:08:33.360
have they ever lose?
Aren't spiders like a million and a hoe?
I mean,
how many,

1146
01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:38.210
when was the last time at spider loss to a bug?
The bug lands in the net.

1147
01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:42.800
The spider never loses.
I guess a spider ever got its ass kicked.

1148
01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:45.260
I'm sure they must have fucked up every now and then.

1149
01:08:45.261 --> 01:08:48.950
Like try to capture a bird or something like that or you can't pick what gets in

1150
01:08:48.951 --> 01:08:50.180
the nat manages things.

1151
01:08:50.181 --> 01:08:53.810
Get in their bird pro birds land in your shit all the time.
That's a problem.

1152
01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:57.740
Yeah.
But the birds probably can get free or people walk through.
I mean,

1153
01:08:57.741 --> 01:09:02.660
I've destroyed right weeks of spider work.
Yeah,
but you're a person.
I mean a bug.

1154
01:09:02.690 --> 01:09:06.170
If a bug lands there and a spider goes to eat it.
Does a spider ever get Eaton?

1155
01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:10.490
Does it ever,
does he ever fuck up and pick somebody who's his ass?
He can't kick.

1156
01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:12.330
Uh,

1157
01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:17.240
I would say it happens probably spider fucked up and bit off more than he can

1158
01:09:17.241 --> 01:09:22.190
chew.
It's
man.
How horrible is that?

1159
01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:25.620
I phone announcement today.
That was just such a dip.

1160
01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:29.890
No,
I mean they had the eye that just the,

1161
01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:34.100
the what they announced like the iPhone is so that's so boring.

1162
01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:37.940
Yeah.
I think it's kind of sad.
What were you,
what were you hoping for?

1163
01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:42.860
Honestly bigger like Joe is this screen not bigger screens.
Exactly the same.

1164
01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:47.360
The only thing that it has is that fingerprint scanner,
which to me is,

1165
01:09:47.361 --> 01:09:50.040
I don't give a shit about the camera's supposed to be much better.
Yeah,

1166
01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:54.380
but you're going to get the gold one Joe.
Um,
yes.

1167
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:58.140
If they have a philosophy or one,
I'll get that one.

1168
01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:02.480
Philosophy philosophy had to be let them bitches.
No,
I got the gems

1169
01:10:06.010 --> 01:10:07.340
be dazzled and be better.

1170
01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:11.810
Is the Samsung bad because I've been thinking about jumping ship and buying one

1171
01:10:11.811 --> 01:10:14.990
of those.
It's pretty bad as the new ones,
especially with that accessories watch.

1172
01:10:14.991 --> 01:10:15.890
I don't know if you've seen that.

1173
01:10:15.891 --> 01:10:20.000
The new galaxy note has a watch that you can buy to go with it,

1174
01:10:20.001 --> 01:10:23.330
which has a camera on the watch so you can just sit around and take pictures.

1175
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:26.960
I want to know when you're playing videos on youtube,

1176
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:29.870
it's not going through the soundboard.
It is.

1177
01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.700
These people are complaining that it's not.

1178
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:35.660
They're saying they don't hear anything.
Huh?
You fixed it.
Yeah,

1179
01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:38.510
it's just quiet.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah,

1180
01:10:38.511 --> 01:10:42.140
and if like if you downloaded yesterday's episode and it was too quiet,

1181
01:10:42.141 --> 01:10:44.300
if you re download it right now,
it's fixed.

1182
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:49.610
I can't help but think that someone like Steve Jobs who was so fucking powerful

1183
01:10:49.611 --> 01:10:54.611
and crazy and influential and so obsessive that when that guy's gone,

1184
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:59.780
everybody just takes naps.
They just slapped the fuck off.

1185
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:02.510
I mean they,
I end,
they'll probably let you,

1186
01:11:02.511 --> 01:11:05.810
like if anybody works for apple is listening to this right now and they're like,

1187
01:11:05.811 --> 01:11:09.470
fuck you man,
we're fucking working hard hat we have the best phone.

1188
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:13.350
I wouldn't even necessarily say that anybody from apple actually talks like
that.

1189
01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:14.790
It's just for the purpose of humor.

1190
01:11:14.791 --> 01:11:19.791
I went that way but my point is like you guys used to be like way out ahead and

1191
01:11:21.211 --> 01:11:23.600
it's very clear you're not anymore mean.

1192
01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:27.590
64 bit processor is the only thing what happened and then the Ipad,

1193
01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:29.220
I thought that was supposed to be announced,

1194
01:11:29.221 --> 01:11:31.200
you know like a new iPad or something.
I didn't,

1195
01:11:31.201 --> 01:11:33.240
I don't think they ever announced what they're going to announce Brian and you

1196
01:11:33.241 --> 01:11:36.900
just know.
I mean rumors,
the rumors are wrong.

1197
01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:38.910
They didn't announce anything.

1198
01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:45.170
What kind of stuff with the 64 bit processor,
Brian,

1199
01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:46.780
what kind of stuff can I look forward to it?

1200
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:51.790
This will show up 1000002nd quicker with the 64 bit processor and your phone.

1201
01:11:52.021 --> 01:11:52.750
That's all.

1202
01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:56.550
I mean it can't be leaps and bounds over everything else because you know then

1203
01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:59.880
it will ruin all the programs,
you know for all other phones.

1204
01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:03.450
I have no problem with the process from my phone.
I never,
I never say damn,

1205
01:12:03.451 --> 01:12:07.860
I wish my phone process things quicker.
What do I do with it besides,
you know,

1206
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:11.070
make calls and go on the web occasionally.
But when you,

1207
01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:15.000
I just want a bigger screen.
I want a bigger screen and I don't know,

1208
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:16.290
that camera seems like it's better,

1209
01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:20.010
but why not take it up more higher than eight megapixels?
You know,

1210
01:12:20.011 --> 01:12:21.630
they didn't go any higher than the megapixels.

1211
01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.550
There's ones that are coming out right now with what,

1212
01:12:23.551 --> 01:12:25.400
42 megapixels or something like that.

1213
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.740
That's not that important for images quite honestly.

1214
01:12:28.741 --> 01:12:32.070
Because how big do you want the image?
Well,
it's the number one phone.

1215
01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:35.550
It's the number one camera in the road now is the iPhone world.

1216
01:12:35.670 --> 01:12:39.060
And if you,
if you look at the images though,

1217
01:12:39.061 --> 01:12:41.890
if you take them and blow them up on your screen,
they look great.
Yeah.

1218
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:45.480
But you still want them big because what have you,
they're big sizes.

1219
01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:48.000
That's the other problem.
They eat up data,

1220
01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:51.060
they eat up memory rather like these things only have 64.

1221
01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:55.340
This is 64 gigs and that's the best one.
The,
the uh,

1222
01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:58.650
like the galaxy that doesn't even have 64 is 32.

1223
01:12:58.651 --> 01:13:02.130
A lot of these guys have 30 to 32 gigs is not enough.

1224
01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:05.250
If you have your songs on it and photos,
you need more than that.

1225
01:13:05.251 --> 01:13:08.780
And especially down that they're using these a four K uh,

1226
01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:13.560
the new galaxy three is going to film in forecasts going to be giant file sizes.

1227
01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:17.160
I can only imagine.
Come on Tim,
get it.
I don't know how long you could,

1228
01:13:17.470 --> 01:13:19.980
I mean how long would 32 gigs last?

1229
01:13:19.981 --> 01:13:23.190
If you're filming in four K it might be like 32 minutes.

1230
01:13:23.210 --> 01:13:26.190
I don't have less than that now.
It's less than that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1231
01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:30.390
Well it's going to suck then because like what if you actually want to make a

1232
01:13:30.391 --> 01:13:31.920
movie with that thing like we were talking about,

1233
01:13:31.921 --> 01:13:36.010
you'd have to have a million fucking cards pop 'em out every five minutes.
Yeah.

1234
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:38.250
Does it have memory?
I just didn't note have assist.

1235
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:40.440
So that's what apple needs to do is just come on man,

1236
01:13:40.441 --> 01:13:44.130
just get a little SD card on the side there.
Yeah,
that would be nice.

1237
01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:47.340
It'd be nice if there was some sort of alternative storage.

1238
01:13:47.341 --> 01:13:48.810
We could enhance the storage.

1239
01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:52.350
Like if you get 62 but you could bump it up to 128 or something like that,

1240
01:13:52.351 --> 01:13:56.340
or 6,428 that would be nice.
It would ruin the style of the fund.

1241
01:13:56.610 --> 01:14:01.170
I just think that with that guy gone,
there was a big void in the company.

1242
01:14:01.230 --> 01:14:03.120
I also think that's just the way it is.

1243
01:14:03.121 --> 01:14:06.900
The world is there's ups and there's downs.
Things maintain.

1244
01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:09.380
They don't charismatic leaders,
you know,

1245
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:13.300
push past a certain boundary where the people are willing to go and in their

1246
01:14:13.301 --> 01:14:15.520
absence there's a void.
You know,

1247
01:14:15.521 --> 01:14:18.810
it's so many companies have risen and fallen like that.

1248
01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:22.510
Let me just so many like companies that are even successful that at one point in

1249
01:14:22.511 --> 01:14:26.230
time they were on hard times and they were doing badly.
Well,
what is the,
I mean,

1250
01:14:26.290 --> 01:14:29.010
what would you want a phone to do or is it maybe,

1251
01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:32.140
what if you could just a lot of things that these android phones do that I

1252
01:14:32.141 --> 01:14:35.230
phones can't,
they will act as an IRR.
The act as remote control.

1253
01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:37.750
You could program your phone to be a remote control for your television.

1254
01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:40.600
That's pretty nice.
It's pretty dope.
Use that.
That's great.

1255
01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:42.220
It's amazing because it has an IRA.
You don't,

1256
01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:47.200
you don't ever have to like have a Samsung galaxy four s for as for and note

1257
01:14:47.201 --> 01:14:50.000
three.
What do you want to get the note three Duncan again,

1258
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:51.610
if you're going to get Andrew,
I'd get the note.

1259
01:14:51.611 --> 01:14:56.410
Three three films in four k four K it's big.
Galaxy s three is big,

1260
01:14:56.411 --> 01:14:59.270
but I still want to be able to fit in my pocket though.

1261
01:14:59.830 --> 01:15:04.820
We might be able to fit in your pocket.
It's big.
It's big.
Yeah,

1262
01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:09.550
it's,
it's almost silly but not quite.
It's like,
but when you see it you go,

1263
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:14.200
Ooh,
La one one.

1264
01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.450
Let me tell you something.
Friends.

1265
01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:21.600
I just played Skyrim on ultra HD on my new fucking PC and that is crazy.

1266
01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:25.750
What kind of pizza do you end up getting?
I can't remember the name of it.

1267
01:15:25.810 --> 01:15:28.390
It's just I got the the,
I can't remember.

1268
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:31.930
You just went to like a best buy or something.
Not best buy.

1269
01:15:31.931 --> 01:15:36.130
I went to Fry's some Russian,
sold this thing to me.
He's like,

1270
01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:39.640
this will do everything.
But it is,
it truly,

1271
01:15:39.641 --> 01:15:44.170
it's crazy cause you blink game.
Yeah.
You mail,
go to my website,

1272
01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:47.440
you'll pill Dick.
You need help.

1273
01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:49.690
I have both Dick in here.

1274
01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:55.360
Come on Duncan Trussell pre order Deakin hair.
I put you on,

1275
01:15:55.690 --> 01:15:59.000
listen brothers subscribe every month.
Come new bill.

1276
01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:04.900
That would be a cool month.
10% of every month.

1277
01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:08.670
That would be such a great service man.
Psychedelic of the month club.

1278
01:16:09.370 --> 01:16:13.780
Just new designer psychedelics that like,
or you get a basket of psychedelics,

1279
01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:16.780
you know like depending on like what kind of trips you like.

1280
01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:20.350
I quite honestly feel like the next decade we're going to see some big movement

1281
01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:24.400
in that regard because I think once the door's been opened,
like with this uh,

1282
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:27.030
Eric Holder cat is saying about marijuana now that they're,

1283
01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:30.880
they're essentially not going to go after Colorado and Washington state and

1284
01:16:30.881 --> 01:16:33.250
they're opening the door to other states do the same thing and they're not going

1285
01:16:33.251 --> 01:16:35.200
to act like they were almost abandoning it.

1286
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:37.870
And it's almost a resource thing at a certain point in time.

1287
01:16:37.871 --> 01:16:42.220
It's like how do you justify that resource when it's so obvious that we have so

1288
01:16:42.221 --> 01:16:45.550
many other real significant problems and in doing so,

1289
01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:48.430
then it opens up the doors for MDM,

1290
01:16:48.431 --> 01:16:52.510
a for post traumatic stress because a lot of veterans of finding great relief

1291
01:16:52.511 --> 01:16:55.300
with mdms and then there's Iowasca,

1292
01:16:55.301 --> 01:17:00.280
which can also function much the same way I begin,
which can get people I began,

1293
01:17:00.281 --> 01:17:03.370
which would the be the big one to get people off these God damn pills.

1294
01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:08.170
That vice on Ibogaine is great.
It's amazing.
But yeah,
Lsd for alcoholism,

1295
01:17:08.171 --> 01:17:10.340
LSD treats,
alcoholism apparently.

1296
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:13.880
<v 3>So yeah,
there's a lot of uses for these things that are going to be emerging.</v>

1297
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:17.690
Man,
I'm,
Obama's confused the shit out of me,
man,

1298
01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.310
because now I'm starting to wonder.

1299
01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:23.630
Maybe he's like really smart because if we don't go to war with Syria,

1300
01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:25.670
what if we don't go to war with Syria?

1301
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:29.720
What if the whole thing was some weird faint where he tricks he likes,

1302
01:17:29.721 --> 01:17:33.110
scared them that we were going to.
Now,
look,
I'm being very optimistic.

1303
01:17:33.111 --> 01:17:37.250
For those of you shrieking out there,
hate Obama,
he,
but what if it was,

1304
01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:40.310
if we don't go to war with Syria and they actually do dump all their chemical

1305
01:17:40.311 --> 01:17:41.144
weapons,

1306
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:45.530
then that's an amazing maneuver that he did strategically.

1307
01:17:45.531 --> 01:17:49.070
If his real goal was to stop chemical weapons attacks,

1308
01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:53.390
Mike and the conspiracy theory side of me believes otherwise,

1309
01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:57.130
thinks it's more to sell weapons or it has something to do with upsetting

1310
01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:59.320
whatever.
Uh,
the,
uh,

1311
01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:03.440
relationships Syria and Russia have,

1312
01:18:04.090 --> 01:18:04.923
<v 2>but</v>

1313
01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:10.510
it's scary now available without even trying.
Wow.

1314
01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:14.260
He turned it in and think about that.
True.
Well,

1315
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:17.980
it said that it's a picture that says apple introduces fingerprint scanning,

1316
01:18:18.190 --> 01:18:22.840
world's largest name to fingerprint database now available without even trying

1317
01:18:22.841 --> 01:18:26.410
and it has a raccoon rubbing his fingers.
He was evil.

1318
01:18:26.411 --> 01:18:29.930
Fucking face teeth,
creepy ass.

1319
01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:34.480
All these scary raccoons are fucking terrifying.
They will fuck you up to man.

1320
01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:37.750
Especially those big urban raccoons are used to being around people.

1321
01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:42.520
That's scary.
Things created.
Dig.
Yes.
Amazing hurling.

1322
01:18:42.521 --> 01:18:45.100
That rack and Kevin Rose,
that guy's got balls

1323
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:47.160
<v 3>that fucking poor dog men.</v>

1324
01:18:47.161 --> 01:18:51.030
That's the last thing you want to see is a raccoon mall and your little dog.

1325
01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:54.050
Yeah,
no kidding man.
And those things can do a lot of damage.
They're real.

1326
01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:57.190
They've killed daughter's fucking rabies.
Don't forget the disease.
Yeah,

1327
01:18:57.290 --> 01:18:58.123
<v 2>yeah,
absolutely.</v>

1328
01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:02.160
This is a Skyrim that they have a new mod that's ultra realistic mod,

1329
01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:07.220
so it makes all the characters just re ridiculously like over a holy shit.

1330
01:19:08.041 --> 01:19:11.550
What mod is this high resolution or something?

1331
01:19:12.150 --> 01:19:15.720
What's the mod called?
Red Bag?
Real vision is,

1332
01:19:15.721 --> 01:19:18.420
I want to see how the combination of a bunch of mods look at that.

1333
01:19:18.421 --> 01:19:23.190
That's pretty sweet.
You can't,
it's hard to tell.
I need to see like,

1334
01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:26.550
Whoa,
that does look pretty bad ass.
You just see like a a character.

1335
01:19:26.551 --> 01:19:28.780
They have any characters you can see a person or something,

1336
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:29.850
find a person for you.

1337
01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:36.030
So this is just requires more processing power.
Video card.

1338
01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:39.720
You'd probably have to have like Sil Lai video cars.
Is it one of those things?

1339
01:19:39.721 --> 01:19:44.550
We have to sell some shit.
I can't remember the,
yeah,
that looks great man.

1340
01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:47.370
That's,
that looks really good.
She looks a little too hot.

1341
01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:51.260
It's going to confuse young boys.
Confuses

1342
01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:52.990
<v 3>me.
The girl who,</v>

1343
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.210
there's some girl running around with me right now named Lydia and she's hot

1344
01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:58.250
like she's very attractive

1345
01:19:59.870 --> 01:20:02.810
<v 2>in this fucking game and Skyrim bow.
Okay,
I got it.</v>

1346
01:20:02.811 --> 01:20:05.330
I got a new tell us you're still in the game.
He did.

1347
01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.190
He's separated that he sounded like he talking about real life.

1348
01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:12.780
He didn't sound like you were talking about a game
dude.

1349
01:20:12.781 --> 01:20:15.390
But the funny thing is that they were there.
The girls probably like,

1350
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:19.560
like some guy like me sitting there going,
no,
it's a,
it's not,
it's artificial.

1351
01:20:19.561 --> 01:20:23.910
It's not.
Skyrim has an online,
unfortunately it's not.
No.

1352
01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:27.840
Why isn't it on online?
I Dunno.
You just playing by yourself.

1353
01:20:27.841 --> 01:20:31.560
You fucking door in front of a computer playing a game.

1354
01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:32.940
I'm the only one in America.

1355
01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:42.440
To me it's just not as same.
Playing against another person is what's fun.
Yeah.

1356
01:20:42.930 --> 01:20:47.700
Playing against the bots.
The game itself,
like you don't understand.

1357
01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:51.060
Oh,
when you see this shit man,
it's so cool.

1358
01:20:51.061 --> 01:20:53.400
The thing that you were saying where you start thinking,
fuck,

1359
01:20:53.401 --> 01:20:54.234
it's the end of the world.

1360
01:20:54.330 --> 01:20:59.330
It does kind of make you think that is just so high tech and while it's the end

1361
01:20:59.881 --> 01:21:04.770
of the world as we know it.
Yeah,
and I feel fine in the end.

1362
01:21:04.850 --> 01:21:05.970
It kinda is,

1363
01:21:05.971 --> 01:21:09.360
but it kind of isn't because the end of the world wasn't when they invented fire

1364
01:21:09.361 --> 01:21:10.110
either.

1365
01:21:10.110 --> 01:21:12.760
The end of the world wasn't when they figured out how to sharpen metal and turn

1366
01:21:12.761 --> 01:21:16.140
it into blades,
the end of the world,
all these things that changed everything.

1367
01:21:16.141 --> 01:21:18.420
When people start cutting people up with sorts for the first time,

1368
01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:20.810
I bet a lot of people like it's the end of the world sharing,

1369
01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:23.520
figured out guns and they start shooting at people and they're like,

1370
01:21:23.521 --> 01:21:25.020
oh this is the end of the world and the world.

1371
01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:27.000
They probably thought it from the Mama.

1372
01:21:27.001 --> 01:21:31.170
We dropped the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
I think it's always,

1373
01:21:31.171 --> 01:21:33.300
we were always thinking it's the end of the,
what is the end of the world?

1374
01:21:33.301 --> 01:21:36.000
If you're a human being,
it's the end of the world cause you're going to die.

1375
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:40.660
It's sort of is the end of the world.
It's true.
Everything.
Everything dies.
Yeah.

1376
01:21:40.670 --> 01:21:43.320
Your subjective world,
we'll uh,

1377
01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:48.330
go by by inevitably now we might be able to extend our life spans a great deal,

1378
01:21:48.410 --> 01:21:52.470
uh,
without this stuff that's coming.
I have hopes for that,
but no matter what,

1379
01:21:52.471 --> 01:21:53.610
if you're a human being,

1380
01:21:53.850 --> 01:21:57.600
there is a subjective apocalypse that you have to look forward to.
Um,

1381
01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:01.170
and there's no way around that.
Yeah,
there's a,
what goes up must come down.

1382
01:22:01.171 --> 01:22:05.000
There's Kevin Rose throwing the fucking,
he that killed that raccoon.

1383
01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:09.240
I hope it to been private.
I don't know man.
It looks like it broke.
It's back.

1384
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:13.920
Like he didn't have,
he like gangster.
That's a guy who loves his fucking animal.

1385
01:22:13.921 --> 01:22:16.740
Cause even put that thing over his head for more velocity.

1386
01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:21.090
He didn't just push it off.
He threw that thing that was a death row.

1387
01:22:21.330 --> 01:22:24.420
That's what it deserves,
man.
I'm all in a Chihuahua.
I know,
but look at it.

1388
01:22:24.421 --> 01:22:28.140
It doesn't even know what's going on.
He fucking gang death thing.
Okay.

1389
01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:31.650
And it hits the side of the,
I think it killed it.
Hopefully they got his eyes.

1390
01:22:31.651 --> 01:22:34.140
He can follow his little laser eyes all the way down to conti.

1391
01:22:34.141 --> 01:22:38.970
Fucking dog killing last one.
Did the dog,
his dog.
His dog.
Okay.

1392
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:43.720
I don't know who.
Okay.
He is.
Okay.
Yeah.

1393
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:45.840
Everybody knows he's okay.

1394
01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:50.460
Did you hear about that hundred and 70 107 year old dude who died in a police

1395
01:22:50.461 --> 01:22:52.080
shootout?
No,

1396
01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:57.960
that's a Monroe is a door.

1397
01:22:57.961 --> 01:23:02.961
107 year old man had died in a shootout with the Swat team Saturday and

1398
01:23:02.971 --> 01:23:06.010
Arkansas.
He'd been asked to Moodle that move out of

1399
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:06.371
<v 0>the house.</v>

1400
01:23:06.371 --> 01:23:11.350
He was living in into an apartment and a detailed comes from is the doors

1401
01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:15.310
roommate.
Who says that the,
that he was very angry.

1402
01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:18.870
<v 2>His roommate,
apparently his roommate was trying to kick them out.</v>

1403
01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:22.500
Can you imagine being roommates with 107 year old?
Well,

1404
01:23:22.501 --> 01:23:26.110
I mean command to be 107 year old and being told you have to find new places to

1405
01:23:26.111 --> 01:23:28.370
play.
Hundred 70 he's still have a fucking roommate.

1406
01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:37.590
That was a,
that would be my peanut butter man.
Wow.

1407
01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:39.900
This sucks.
Dude

1408
01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:44.620
<v 0>himself in the room refused to come out and that's when his granddaughter fall</v>

1409
01:23:44.621 --> 01:23:48.560
down to open the door.
He pointed a gun at her and stated,

1410
01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:52.870
you better stop breaking into my house.
And then,
uh,

1411
01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:58.000
the police arrived and then three hours later a swat team stormed his room.

1412
01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:02.810
That's sucks.
It just has a swat team.
Stormed his room is the door was dead.

1413
01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:06.020
Lewis and the police say that is a door was the first to open fire.

1414
01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:07.550
They didn't even say the SWAT team shot him.

1415
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:12.110
They're like trying to not say they shot this 107 year old guy.

1416
01:24:12.170 --> 01:24:14.990
That sucks.
It does suck.
It's,
it'd be,

1417
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:18.110
it would suck if it was your dad would suck if it was you.

1418
01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:23.300
I hate all of that stuff is tired of that.
It's also,
there's a real sadness.

1419
01:24:23.690 --> 01:24:26.240
There's a real reality,
um,
about mental health.

1420
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:27.740
When people get to be a certain age,

1421
01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:30.920
like there's a lot of people who are old that are delirious,

1422
01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:35.360
like really delirious.
Like their,
their mental function is severely compromised.

1423
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:39.350
And when something like this happens,
that easily could be the case.

1424
01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:43.910
The guy is 107.
What are the odds that he's thinking,
Claire,

1425
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.960
<v 2>Oh,
I'm not leaving my nest.
You know,
who knows?
This is my idea.</v>

1426
01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:55.200
<v 0>And plus he survived 107 years in Arkansas.
I mean,
what,</v>

1427
01:24:55.230 --> 01:24:58.260
what kind of be survives 107 years old.

1428
01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.500
<v 2>You'll never get me out of this shell.</v>

1429
01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:07.580
It's just the shell man.
Everyone gets tell attached to their shit.

1430
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.570
Did you hear her?
The isolated,
the strongest organism on earth.
And it's,

1431
01:25:12.170 --> 01:25:15.020
I don't have a joke for that.
Gonorrhea.
Oh really?

1432
01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:18.190
Strongest organism on earth has gonorrhea.
Whoa.
Wow.

1433
01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.170
I can move something like 100,000 times their body weight.

1434
01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:25.880
What gonorrhea can move stuff.
Yeah.
Well here I'm,
I'm a read the road.

1435
01:25:26.150 --> 01:25:29.180
I've never heard that before.
Gonorrhea could be our new fuels.

1436
01:25:29.210 --> 01:25:32.690
Your keys getting dragged
nukes,

1437
01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:37.520
grass fed gonorrhea.
I don't want to slut shame.
So I met male sluts.

1438
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:42.070
Maria dip.
This is uh,
this is incredible stuff,
man.

1439
01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:46.310
It's a science world report.
Uh,
no,
that's on it.

1440
01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:49.810
That's the gonorrhea carries things.
Um,

1441
01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:53.570
I'm trying to find it real quick so I can give you the low down.

1442
01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:57.560
Did you hear that?
It's like a fourth person with AIDS and the porn industry,

1443
01:25:57.561 --> 01:25:59.810
they just announced.
Yeah.
Here it is.

1444
01:25:59.970 --> 01:26:03.980
Gonorrhea is the strongest living creature.
It says,
scientists

1445
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:07.370
<v 0>have recently discovered the gonorrhea bacterium is pound for pound,</v>

1446
01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:11.090
the strongest living creature on earth capable of pulling up to 100,000 times

1447
01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:15.200
its body weight filaments called uh,
I believe it's Pili,

1448
01:26:15.201 --> 01:26:18.290
p I l I which grow from the bacteria.

1449
01:26:18.291 --> 01:26:23.291
It can be up to 10 times as long as the bacteria itself and our what Ghana Rhea

1450
01:26:24.231 --> 01:26:27.380
uses to move itself or pull other organisms.

1451
01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:32.690
I had no idea gonorrhea could carry things,
which is a bad ass.
That's incredible.

1452
01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:35.780
That's so scary.
Well then think about this.

1453
01:26:35.781 --> 01:26:39.080
What about the new bell gonorrhea that they said that they were getting in Asia.

1454
01:26:39.081 --> 01:26:41.450
That's like killing people that they can't cure.

1455
01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:45.720
We're here to here now has been cases in California.
Jesus Louisa's yeah,

1456
01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:50.620
keep it in your pants.
Duncan Trussell there's a serious one out there.
Don and I,

1457
01:26:50.630 --> 01:26:53.120
this is a serious one.
My Skyrim has gone.

1458
01:26:53.121 --> 01:26:55.580
Arianna and I'm fine to then is terrifying.

1459
01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:00.710
Jesus Louisa's now Brian,
what do you know about this aids thing and porn?

1460
01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:07.600
Dunkin's plans for wedding.
They just found.

1461
01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:11.620
Can we tell about who we tell about your love?
No,
let's not Sara Nay.
What?

1462
01:27:11.650 --> 01:27:14.780
Love your love.
Your pouring love.
Oh No,

1463
01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:19.100
absolutely not.
What happened?
Nothing.
Nothing happened.

1464
01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:22.220
It's just someone that he admires her very deeply.
No,

1465
01:27:22.221 --> 01:27:25.130
I've got a favorite porn star.
I'll admit it.
I'm not ashamed.

1466
01:27:25.131 --> 01:27:29.690
You Hook up with her.
Know who's,
who's the porn girl?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,

1467
01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:33.230
no.
Neef doesn't matter.
Don't even dated porn girls.
That's all right.
Brian,

1468
01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:36.090
are you worried about the super gonorrhea?
No.
What about this?

1469
01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:39.410
They all sent me like every time there's like one of these cases,

1470
01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:43.760
like every girl that I've ever dated in porn like does like a mass text of like

1471
01:27:43.761 --> 01:27:47.510
screenshots of their aids tests.
Yeah,
that's great.
That's great.

1472
01:27:47.511 --> 01:27:50.630
If they got an age test right before you met him and then they got the results

1473
01:27:50.631 --> 01:27:54.800
right before you met him because you're,
if you're having sex,

1474
01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:58.640
like say if you get an aids test,
especially if you're in that business and look,

1475
01:27:58.641 --> 01:28:00.110
I'm clean area.
I'm cleaning.

1476
01:28:00.111 --> 01:28:03.590
You show up at work and how long ago did you get that test?

1477
01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:06.140
Did you get it yesterday?
Did you get it a day before yesterday?

1478
01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:08.970
How many people are you fucking that time?
How many you like,

1479
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:13.400
are those guys clean but they pouring guys or did you get drunk at a bar and

1480
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:15.210
pick someone up like,
uh,
did,

1481
01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:18.860
did you have a boyfriend that you hook up with or you guys monogamous where,

1482
01:28:18.890 --> 01:28:22.040
where's your vagina been?
Yeah.
You don't know where's your penis?

1483
01:28:22.190 --> 01:28:24.530
You don't know man.
I know.
Especially this is,

1484
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:29.060
I believe that this super gonorrhea is going to be a bad one.
I'm really,

1485
01:28:29.150 --> 01:28:34.020
I'm really nervous about humanity because a of that episode that we did of a

1486
01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:34.953
Scifi show,

1487
01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:40.100
when I started talking to people about pandemic diseases and diseases like mers

1488
01:28:40.101 --> 01:28:43.970
or some shit called Murs,
it's killing 50% of the people that get it.
Yeah.

1489
01:28:44.330 --> 01:28:46.520
I don't know what it means.
I don't know what [inaudible] means.
It's [inaudible],

1490
01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:49.520
but it's not like Murcia.
It's a m r s like SARS,

1491
01:28:49.521 --> 01:28:53.000
like I don't know what it stands for.
Google what it stands for,

1492
01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:56.120
but what they were telling me was absolutely fucking terrifying.

1493
01:28:56.570 --> 01:29:00.020
What they were telling me is that shit just changes.
It just,

1494
01:29:00.050 --> 01:29:01.980
they morph things morph like

1495
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:06.690
<v 2>that guy that we,
when we went to that,
that lab in uh,
in,
in Texas and Galveston.</v>

1496
01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:11.370
How fucking freaky was that?
I was freaky.
I hated that.

1497
01:29:11.371 --> 01:29:14.460
I didn't like being around that Shit,
man.
Yeah.
That's a,

1498
01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:16.290
that's a spooky ass thing.

1499
01:29:16.291 --> 01:29:20.160
And Connor like incurable gonorrhea doesn't gone it.
What is,

1500
01:29:20.161 --> 01:29:21.690
what are the symptoms of gonorrhea?

1501
01:29:22.530 --> 01:29:26.950
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome is what this Mersch.

1502
01:29:26.951 --> 01:29:30.690
It is one of the symptoms.
Symptoms of gonorrhea.

1503
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:33.420
I thought it was always like green ship Chirp and I have your pussy.

1504
01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:37.500
I thought it was for doors they start wearing for doors.
I that's not true.

1505
01:29:37.501 --> 01:29:41.820
Grow a beard.
No.
Now,
yeah,
this Saudi Arabia,

1506
01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:47.670
the Saudi Arabia thing,
this Merce things apparently incredibly deadly.

1507
01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:51.990
So it's called a corona virus.
Yeah.

1508
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:56.370
Fuck man.
It's killed.
Some people man,
cure it with a line.

1509
01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:58.290
I don't think that many people have it,

1510
01:29:58.770 --> 01:30:01.860
but I think the people that are getting it are having a really hard time.

1511
01:30:02.370 --> 01:30:05.520
And this is a fairly recent articles to September article.

1512
01:30:05.730 --> 01:30:10.590
This is some scary shit,
man.
Sure.
And the,
the super gonorrhea.
I mean,
look,

1513
01:30:11.010 --> 01:30:14.280
it could be that,
it could be a new thing.
It could be a new super herpes.

1514
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:18.100
It could be a new thing that comes after that.
We are there,

1515
01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:20.320
they're fighting it tooth and nail.

1516
01:30:20.350 --> 01:30:25.120
All these people that are trying to develop vaccines and,
and different,
uh,

1517
01:30:25.290 --> 01:30:29.700
different cures very selves.
But the way they were describing it to me,
like,

1518
01:30:29.701 --> 01:30:31.060
we can never win this.
Like,

1519
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:33.300
you don't understand these things change all the time.

1520
01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:35.130
Like they're more morphing up.

1521
01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:38.760
Like all of a sudden the Spanish flu comes out blank now.
There it is.

1522
01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:41.550
That does it.
I mean,
look,
there's no way to keep that from happening.

1523
01:30:41.551 --> 01:30:45.330
That does happen,
happened plus the plague.

1524
01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:48.420
The black plague always.
This shit always happens.

1525
01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:50.700
It's just part of being on a planet.
You know,
it's gonna,

1526
01:30:50.730 --> 01:30:53.540
there's gonna be some disease that emerges.
Um,

1527
01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:57.510
that said this is the best time ever,
ever for that,

1528
01:30:57.570 --> 01:31:00.900
for not getting sick like that.
And that's why,
you know,

1529
01:31:00.901 --> 01:31:04.920
like the whole anti vaccine thing,
it's a very tricky thing.

1530
01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:08.820
It's a very tricky conversation to have because I don't believe that's a black

1531
01:31:08.821 --> 01:31:10.150
and white issue.
You know?

1532
01:31:10.170 --> 01:31:12.870
I know people personally who have been harmed by vaccines.

1533
01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:18.380
My friend's dad has Lyme disease cause he took a Lyme disease vaccine.

1534
01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:22.260
Wow.
Yeah.
They don't give it out anymore.
Well anything that comes out,

1535
01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:25.800
no matter what it is,
no matter what it is.
Red Bull for example,

1536
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:30.690
anything that's released to a massive amount of people statistically is going to

1537
01:31:30.691 --> 01:31:33.480
fuck some people up.
Absolutely.
No matter what it is,

1538
01:31:33.481 --> 01:31:37.440
whether it's vaccines you need asprin.
Some people die from aspirin,
pencils,

1539
01:31:37.441 --> 01:31:40.770
some people allergic to peanut butter.
Yeah,
they're dead.
That's a weird thing.

1540
01:31:40.771 --> 01:31:43.320
You know,
when you mass manufacturer anything,

1541
01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:46.350
you just kind of have to accept the fact that it's going to kill a certain

1542
01:31:46.351 --> 01:31:49.620
percentage of that.
Your consumers and then nuts.
Yeah.
That's nuts.

1543
01:31:49.650 --> 01:31:52.620
Or like contingency plans at amusement parks.
Like,

1544
01:31:52.621 --> 01:31:55.230
when you build an amusement park,
you know,

1545
01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:58.350
statistically someone's going to die in this place.

1546
01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.490
You've got to have these contingency

1547
01:32:00.490 --> 01:32:03.910
<v 3>plans.
That's just the funny part of mass producing things is there,</v>

1548
01:32:03.911 --> 01:32:06.370
will it to mass produce a thing,

1549
01:32:06.430 --> 01:32:11.430
a human sacrifices always necessary in some way a human will die because of the

1550
01:32:11.531 --> 01:32:14.960
fucking thing.
Guaranteed someone's died from Legos.
You know,

1551
01:32:14.961 --> 01:32:16.570
a kid's choked on Legos,

1552
01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:19.990
I'm sure guaranteed someone's died from like a hammock.

1553
01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:23.380
How many kids have died from bikes?
Think of trampolines.
Oh,

1554
01:32:23.381 --> 01:32:27.460
we could probably fill a hundred graveyards where the corpses of kids killed on

1555
01:32:27.461 --> 01:32:32.170
trampolines.
Paralyzed swimming pools.
Yup.
Diving boards.
Yup.

1556
01:32:32.230 --> 01:32:35.580
The world is a mine field.
Yup.
There's no way to avoid it.

1557
01:32:35.670 --> 01:32:39.010
<v 1>You're right.
Yeah.
There is no way to avoid it.
Um,</v>

1558
01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:43.620
but they're trying hardest fuck with,
with vaccines and that's,
you know,

1559
01:32:43.710 --> 01:32:46.650
there's a lot of people that think that it's a big conspiracy that is a big

1560
01:32:46.651 --> 01:32:48.330
conspiracy to vaccinate kids.

1561
01:32:48.331 --> 01:32:52.620
And the real issue is that there is a lot of fucking money involved in vaccine

1562
01:32:52.621 --> 01:32:53.910
and cap.
That's a fact.

1563
01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:57.770
And we all know that when there is a lot of money involved in things,
that the,

1564
01:32:57.771 --> 01:33:01.860
the decisions that are made don't often reflect the health and welfare of the

1565
01:33:01.861 --> 01:33:06.570
people as much as they reflect the ability for these things to generate income

1566
01:33:06.571 --> 01:33:09.390
for the people who make the laws.
That's why cigarettes are still legal

1567
01:33:09.490 --> 01:33:13.540
<v 3>fact.
I just have to,
you know,
in situations like vacs,</v>

1568
01:33:13.570 --> 01:33:17.760
vaccinations,
I deferred to people like that.
Don't know.
Yeah.

1569
01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:21.250
Doctor that we interviewed.
I don't,
I don't know for sure.
I don't know.

1570
01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:25.540
I don't think that guy is making money from vaccines.
But when we're off camera,

1571
01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:29.980
I asked him about what he thinks about people who aren't taking vaccines and he

1572
01:33:29.981 --> 01:33:31.630
got,
you know,
he got mad.

1573
01:33:31.631 --> 01:33:35.080
He was like his face got sad and pissed off at the same time.

1574
01:33:35.081 --> 01:33:40.081
Like we're doing all this fucking work to try to keep you assholes from dying of

1575
01:33:40.841 --> 01:33:45.841
diseases and you've liked managed to like scare off people from doing,

1576
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:50.530
uh,
from,
from taking the steps to prevent these diseases from spreading.
Yeah.

1577
01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:55.560
He didn't seem to me like a some kind of conniving vaccine salesman.

1578
01:33:55.780 --> 01:33:59.470
He just seemed like a scientist who's trying to prevent disease from spreading.

1579
01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:02.200
Oh,
of course.
So I defer to that guy.
Well,

1580
01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:06.240
<v 1>no,
the real issue is I defer to that guy as well of course.</v>

1581
01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:11.420
But the real issue is what is the evidence of any actual damage being done by

1582
01:34:13.201 --> 01:34:16.410
vaccines?
What are the actual numbers?
And when you go into the numbers,

1583
01:34:16.710 --> 01:34:18.990
that's when you go,
oh wow.

1584
01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:24.320
$2 billion was paid out in vaccine court.

1585
01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:29.520
There's been,
there's been many multiple million dollar,
um,

1586
01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:34.580
fuck cases that have been paid out in vaccine court to a new Peter's for,

1587
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.460
here's one from 2013.
Ready for this.

1588
01:34:38.461 --> 01:34:41.550
Two autistic children awarded millions by vaccine court.

1589
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:48.330
Oh No,
this is,
it's not just a few,
a few people.

1590
01:34:48.510 --> 01:34:52.920
It's uh,
there's,
there's quite a few.
I mean there's many,
many cases.

1591
01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:54.540
That's where it's kind of crazy.

1592
01:34:54.541 --> 01:34:58.190
It's like this is the vaccine court awarded money

1593
01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:02.990
<v 0>where did millions of dollars to two children who rapidly regressed and became</v>

1594
01:35:02.991 --> 01:35:07.970
autistic after around of routine childhood vaccinations.
Wow.
Why is,

1595
01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:11.330
how does that work?
How do they,
if,
if,

1596
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:13.610
if vaccines don't cause autism,

1597
01:35:13.611 --> 01:35:18.410
then how did this money get lob passed out?
And if vaccines do,

1598
01:35:18.411 --> 01:35:22.640
but they only do it for a certain number of people.
How,
I mean,

1599
01:35:22.670 --> 01:35:25.190
how do we recognize who they do it for?

1600
01:35:25.191 --> 01:35:27.740
Is it people who have a very specific gene?

1601
01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:31.310
Cause that's what the issue was with the uh,
I'm disease.

1602
01:35:31.490 --> 01:35:35.690
People had a very specific gene or a tendency or the ones who want up testing

1603
01:35:35.691 --> 01:35:39.590
positive for it or wound up while,
while the,
excuse me wound up getting it.

1604
01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:43.970
That is so awful to think that you fucking take your kid in to protect him and

1605
01:35:43.971 --> 01:35:48.560
they become autistic and now I'm man having kids.
It must be terrifying.

1606
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:51.860
That's what it is.
In a way.
It's also awesome,

1607
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:55.820
but when you take them to get vaccinated,
some part of you is like,
oh is this,

1608
01:35:55.910 --> 01:36:00.320
most vaccines are safe.
Most vaccines are very safe.
I thrive.
I thought there,

1609
01:36:00.321 --> 01:36:03.980
there are people that I have that are very good friends that said they're chill,

1610
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:07.790
they're children changed after vaccinations and people say that that's just

1611
01:36:07.791 --> 01:36:10.220
anecdotal.
And then they were changing anyway.

1612
01:36:10.221 --> 01:36:15.070
And people have a way of looking at the past and rationalizing,
and I go,
maybe.

1613
01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:20.110
But when you see rulings like that where there's billions of dollars have been

1614
01:36:20.721 --> 01:36:23.810
handed out,
it's kind of weird,
man.
Here's another one.

1615
01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:28.070
2008 the federal government agreed to award damages to the family of this young

1616
01:36:28.071 --> 01:36:29.120
girl's name and what's her name,

1617
01:36:29.121 --> 01:36:33.440
who developed an autistic like symptoms after receiving a series of vaccines in

1618
01:36:33.441 --> 01:36:36.830
a single day,
the vaccines were given,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1619
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:41.210
She was diagnosed months later with encephalopathy and cephalopathy.
Yeah,

1620
01:36:41.211 --> 01:36:44.060
but Google is Google search.
How many people have died of measles?

1621
01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:46.190
But hold on a second.
All right,
hold on a second.

1622
01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:50.990
She was diagnosed with whatever this two degrees did.
Uh,
diseases.

1623
01:36:50.991 --> 01:36:55.100
It says brain disease caused by mitochondrial enzyme deficit,

1624
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:56.990
a mitochondrial disorder.

1625
01:36:56.991 --> 01:37:01.070
It's not unusual for children with such deficits develop neurological signs

1626
01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:03.080
between their first and second years.

1627
01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:05.630
Very little scientific research in this area.

1628
01:37:05.631 --> 01:37:09.590
And no scientific studies show whether childhood vaccines can cause or

1629
01:37:09.591 --> 01:37:11.870
contribute to mitochondrial disease.

1630
01:37:11.930 --> 01:37:14.570
So I don't understand how they wanted the money.
Yeah.

1631
01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:17.840
It's probably like a peanut allergy.
It's just,
you know,
some people,
right?

1632
01:37:18.090 --> 01:37:21.410
It's probably so small though with the amount of people that don't have any

1633
01:37:21.411 --> 01:37:24.920
effects.
Well,
I think,
but for a lot of people that are really scared,

1634
01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:28.340
and that's what your point was,
your point was,
yeah.
People with kids,

1635
01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:32.120
they get terrified.
What if their kid thousand people died of measles?

1636
01:37:33.170 --> 01:37:38.000
That's a lot.
158,000 how many people croaked from vaccines?

1637
01:37:38.590 --> 01:37:42.080
Well,
let's see.
Let's ask how,
no,
it's [inaudible] one,
three.
Brian,

1638
01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:45.020
how many people had been damaged from 17 million people,
if that?

1639
01:37:48.570 --> 01:37:50.990
The vacs vaccine is actually just a bullet.

1640
01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:55.980
You'll never get sick again.
We got

1641
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:58.710
<v 2>to shoot it in vaccine injury.</v>

1642
01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:04.100
5,000 families of children diagnosed with autism have claims for compensation.

1643
01:38:06.090 --> 01:38:10.110
5,000 [inaudible] though,
man,
I gotta Piss.
Go ahead.

1644
01:38:10.111 --> 01:38:13.950
Go make your PPS.
You warned us before.

1645
01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:18.250
Dark posts.
Really good for a doctor.

1646
01:38:18.290 --> 01:38:22.320
I'm glad you're being unhealthy as I slurp down bulletproof coffee,

1647
01:38:22.650 --> 01:38:27.120
I feel fat.
Butter.
Can I get,
can I talk about my show real quick?

1648
01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:30.500
What show are you talking about?
Standup life's.
Yeah,
sure.
Uh,

1649
01:38:30.690 --> 01:38:33.960
me and Tony Hinchcliffe,
we're going to be in a Phoenix,
Arizona,

1650
01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:38.460
September 26 at stand up live and then the following day in Columbus,

1651
01:38:38.461 --> 01:38:42.740
Ohio at a,
with Tom's a Gra and Christina Biedrzycki and,

1652
01:38:43.170 --> 01:38:47.850
and all the tickets.
Right desk.
What that TV sweet baby.
Jesus.
That should be fun.

1653
01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:50.670
Yeah.
Columbus,
Ohio is always a good time to,
yeah.

1654
01:38:50.770 --> 01:38:53.190
It's going to be weird seeing Mike and I have two.

1655
01:38:53.191 --> 01:38:56.940
My sister has two kids now and they send me these videos and they're already

1656
01:38:56.941 --> 01:38:58.500
like using iPads and they're like,

1657
01:38:58.501 --> 01:39:03.090
these kids are like two and they know how to use the iPad in like the remote

1658
01:39:03.091 --> 01:39:06.450
control and they know how to like record programs on the DVR.

1659
01:39:06.450 --> 01:39:07.500
And it's like they're too,

1660
01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:09.610
and they know how to record the program getting there flip.

1661
01:39:09.611 --> 01:39:12.360
It's like ridiculous flipping through shit.
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1662
01:39:12.361 --> 01:39:15.030
How can they read and how can they record programs?
They don't read.

1663
01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:16.920
I think my sister just says,
you know,

1664
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:21.260
highlight red button to record or something.
I have.
Wow,
that's fascinating.
We'll,

1665
01:39:21.261 --> 01:39:23.880
she probably talks them through it.
Yeah.
It's not like they're like a bitch.

1666
01:39:23.881 --> 01:39:28.500
I got this.
I'll bring some videos.
It's actually,
bitch,
I got this.
It's weird.

1667
01:39:28.530 --> 01:39:32.610
Really.
They're like,
I got it.
Yeah.
At two and I think it's two and three.

1668
01:39:32.730 --> 01:39:37.050
That's insane.
That's,
I have a hard time to believe in that,
but it's coming.

1669
01:39:37.710 --> 01:39:41.150
Everybody's going to be like weaned on it from the womb.
The beginning.
Yeah.

1670
01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:45.330
They're going to just dangle an iPod over your crib when you're a baby or an

1671
01:39:45.331 --> 01:39:47.790
iPad.
Rather,
you're going to be watching little kids movies.

1672
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:52.110
Do you think school is going to be somehow phased out in the future?

1673
01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:54.980
Like with like,
you know,
virtual classrooms or,
or,

1674
01:39:55.010 --> 01:39:58.710
or something like that because it seems like nowadays that uh,

1675
01:39:58.830 --> 01:39:59.870
everything's on your iPad.

1676
01:39:59.871 --> 01:40:03.030
It's like there's a school that in Los Angeles where all your work is done on

1677
01:40:03.031 --> 01:40:05.730
your iPad,
all your books or on your Ipad,
you just have an iPad.
Now,

1678
01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:10.110
I don't think that that's ever going to be the case where you don't go to
school.

1679
01:40:10.150 --> 01:40:13.590
Right.
Because there's a real need for,
with kids,
for social interaction.

1680
01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:18.660
It's a community and social interaction.
It's a huge part of being a human being.

1681
01:40:18.930 --> 01:40:22.170
And people don't think about that when they like homeschool their kids.

1682
01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:24.210
But when you're homeschooling,
you're kid,

1683
01:40:24.211 --> 01:40:28.470
you're taking your kid out of a community of peers and you're isolating them.

1684
01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:29.131
You know,

1685
01:40:29.131 --> 01:40:33.630
it's a weird thing and I could get it if there's no good teachers near you and

1686
01:40:33.631 --> 01:40:33.821
your,

1687
01:40:33.821 --> 01:40:37.020
your kids struggling and you really want to do it your way and help them and

1688
01:40:37.021 --> 01:40:41.670
then you real patient about,
you know,
bringing him around other kids maybe for,

1689
01:40:41.770 --> 01:40:44.550
you know,
a school activity type shit that other places would do.

1690
01:40:44.551 --> 01:40:47.760
But I just feel like kids need to be around kids,
man.

1691
01:40:47.761 --> 01:40:52.070
You need to learn what the fucks out there need to be around crazy dudes need to

1692
01:40:52.130 --> 01:40:54.040
be around crazy.
Girls need

1693
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.710
<v 1>to be around really nice people.
You gravitate towards him.</v>

1694
01:40:56.711 --> 01:40:59.800
You need to be around people or manipulative.
So you see what it feels like.

1695
01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:03.880
That's like the training wheels of life when you're going to school,

1696
01:41:03.881 --> 01:41:07.810
the training wheels of social interaction and in an unrestricted group,

1697
01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:09.850
or at least unmonitored group,

1698
01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:13.600
when kids get together and giant groups and they're 14 they're there somewhere.

1699
01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:17.080
No,
they learn who the fuck they are.
You learn who you really are,

1700
01:41:17.081 --> 01:41:19.530
who you're pretending to be.
You,
you know,

1701
01:41:19.950 --> 01:41:24.100
the interaction between men and women and people attracted to each other.

1702
01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:28.930
The rejection that you experienced that way for the first time or the acceptance

1703
01:41:29.110 --> 01:41:31.600
and the,
the addiction of a relationship,

1704
01:41:31.630 --> 01:41:33.670
you need to experience that for the first time.
Right.

1705
01:41:33.730 --> 01:41:37.600
And then the social dynamic of doing that and school and all the different,

1706
01:41:37.601 --> 01:41:40.720
are you in with this click or that click and these people are cool where these

1707
01:41:40.721 --> 01:41:45.430
people are not,
you know,
that's,
that's a massive part of uh,

1708
01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:46.900
becoming a human being.

1709
01:41:47.690 --> 01:41:50.840
<v 4>Yeah.
I just don't think you got to do it.
And I mean,
I think public schools are,</v>

1710
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:54.620
I don't know,
I,
you know,
some places public schools are bad,

1711
01:41:54.650 --> 01:41:57.620
but if you're like boulder,
Colorado public schools are not bad.

1712
01:41:57.980 --> 01:42:01.850
Is this places in this country with,
it's still have good public schools.
Yeah,

1713
01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:06.170
La.
Yeah.
I went to a public school.
It's fine.
I went to public school too.

1714
01:42:06.171 --> 01:42:09.620
I went to Newton south where I went to high school still to this day.

1715
01:42:09.621 --> 01:42:13.190
He's a good post.
I still remember that stink at the cafeteria.
Oh,
you know,

1716
01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:16.270
I mean look,
there's,
it's not the best thing.
And remember that old smell,

1717
01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:20.140
our cafeteria in high school had pizza hut and shit like that.
It was great guys.

1718
01:42:20.150 --> 01:42:21.500
Damn.
How did you have that

1719
01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:26.410
cake with spaghetti sauce on it.
We have those weird

1720
01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:30.710
<v 1>cheeseburgers.
It seemed like they were all punched out in one cube.</v>

1721
01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:34.580
Like it was like the cheese and the bond that we're all one thing.

1722
01:42:34.850 --> 01:42:36.410
We were almost like baked in together.

1723
01:42:36.411 --> 01:42:39.470
It never felt like a bond that was and it was always wrapped in aluminum foil

1724
01:42:39.471 --> 01:42:43.040
and you get it and just squirt a lot of ketchup and mustard and that thing to

1725
01:42:43.041 --> 01:42:43.874
give it some flavor.

1726
01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:48.540
<v 4>How much did your meal cost?
My ours was a dollar 25 yeah.</v>

1727
01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:52.820
And there was this humiliating thing before you would go to the lunch room where

1728
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.830
the poor kids would have to get the,

1729
01:42:54.831 --> 01:42:57.470
you get cards based on what your parents had paid.

1730
01:42:57.471 --> 01:43:00.480
So it's like a cards and then the poor kids in front of everybody,

1731
01:43:00.481 --> 01:43:03.590
you have to get the cards,
you know,
so that they have to,

1732
01:43:03.591 --> 01:43:06.620
so everybody knows they can't pay.
There are so poor,

1733
01:43:06.621 --> 01:43:11.450
they can't pay a dollar 25 for this in front of everyone.
Yeah.
That's fucked up,

1734
01:43:11.451 --> 01:43:14.200
man.
That is fucked up.
And that's a,
uh,

1735
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:18.440
that's just one little piece of what public schools do.
And I agree with you,
man.

1736
01:43:18.441 --> 01:43:20.670
Kids need to interact.
People need to interact,

1737
01:43:20.671 --> 01:43:22.880
people need to play games and interact socially.

1738
01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:28.180
But sometimes the way the interaction happens in public schools is brutal,

1739
01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:31.220
vicious,
terrible.

1740
01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:35.540
And I think ultimately very destructive for certain kids.

1741
01:43:35.850 --> 01:43:39.290
I think it certainly can be.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I,
and,
and,
and,

1742
01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:43.280
and unregulate cause the,
a lot of these teachers,
man,
they're fucking assholes.

1743
01:43:43.281 --> 01:43:47.630
And they believe that kids,
you know,
some teachers might do,

1744
01:43:47.631 --> 01:43:49.850
when I was in school,
there was still corporal punishment.

1745
01:43:50.150 --> 01:43:54.140
Kids would get paddled in the hallway.
I remember that.
So kid had paddled once.

1746
01:43:54.340 --> 01:43:57.100
I got paddle when I live in Florida.
So think about that.
So you,
your,

1747
01:43:57.110 --> 01:44:02.110
your kid legally has to go to this facility where a stranger that said,

1748
01:44:02.230 --> 01:44:02.480
um,

1749
01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:07.480
gets to hit them now that is fucking crazy and fucking pissed when she found out

1750
01:44:08.511 --> 01:44:13.040
that she was so mad because a,
it was just me and this boy got in an altercation.

1751
01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:14.510
I don't even know.
I think we hit each other.

1752
01:44:14.511 --> 01:44:16.100
We like push each other around or something like that.

1753
01:44:16.370 --> 01:44:20.360
And they sent us both to the principal's office and we got paddled handled as an

1754
01:44:20.361 --> 01:44:23.780
m style,
like with a,
yeah,
it was a big,
like a,
like a squash power or something.

1755
01:44:23.781 --> 01:44:28.760
Yeah.
Hurting you.
They're hurting you and humiliating you,
teaching you that.

1756
01:44:28.761 --> 01:44:33.050
If you don't bow down to authority than they can hit you legally.
Fuck that man.

1757
01:44:33.051 --> 01:44:36.200
That is,
and it's state sponsored.
You have to go there.

1758
01:44:36.201 --> 01:44:41.060
They bus you in on these weird fucking vehicles.
It's not the,
you know,

1759
01:44:41.061 --> 01:44:43.220
I think that it's necessary for people to be around each other.

1760
01:44:43.221 --> 01:44:47.120
But fucking public schools,
man,
when did they stop the paddling thing?

1761
01:44:47.121 --> 01:44:50.100
I remember that in elementary school,
but then I didn't,
it just seemed like a,

1762
01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:53.230
they stopped doing it maybe around that time.
I don't know.

1763
01:44:53.250 --> 01:44:56.090
He just gradually phased it out.
Yeah.

1764
01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:59.690
I think people just got really furious about the idea,

1765
01:44:59.691 --> 01:45:02.960
especially when people realize how bad it is to hit kids.
I had a friend,

1766
01:45:02.961 --> 01:45:04.400
Eric Norman,
when he,

1767
01:45:04.401 --> 01:45:07.520
and he was always getting into trouble and when he would get paddled,

1768
01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:09.080
which was an inevitability,

1769
01:45:09.081 --> 01:45:13.340
they take them in the hallway and he didn't tensional he scream as loud as he

1770
01:45:13.341 --> 01:45:16.670
could at the top of his lungs.
He'd be sitting there and you'd hear this like,

1771
01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:22.010
I mean it sounded like someone was getting beheaded,
but he,

1772
01:45:22.050 --> 01:45:24.890
it wasn't really hurt.
He was just doing it I think,
for the show.

1773
01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:29.180
But I don't know,
man.
That's pretty brutal.
The show.
Yeah.
No,

1774
01:45:29.181 --> 01:45:32.390
he's doing that because he knew it was upsetting to the teacher,
you know,

1775
01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:36.800
cause he naturally kind of cool.
It was pretty smart.
Yeah.

1776
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:40.430
I thought it was really disgusting.
Kids were always puking.

1777
01:45:40.431 --> 01:45:43.760
I remember that man that was a big part of public schools inevitably walking

1778
01:45:43.761 --> 01:45:48.220
down the hallway and somewhat scattered the puke dust,
many meant shit.

1779
01:45:48.230 --> 01:45:52.220
That's like a mint mixed with fucking throw up.
You know,
I told you that stuff,

1780
01:45:52.221 --> 01:45:56.420
um,
that uh,
that smell that you would get when you would go outside.

1781
01:45:56.730 --> 01:45:58.640
I would got cure to that from fear factor,

1782
01:45:58.810 --> 01:46:02.150
but you could throw up right in front of me.
It doesn't bother me at all.

1783
01:46:03.170 --> 01:46:05.960
The went away completely.
But when I was in high school,

1784
01:46:05.961 --> 01:46:09.740
if someone threw up in the hallway,
I was done.
I couldn't,
I couldn't hold it in.

1785
01:46:09.741 --> 01:46:12.880
I would just start throwing up in my mouth.
It's a lunatic asylum man.

1786
01:46:12.890 --> 01:46:15.710
And then think about how they are making you sit in a fucking chair and they're

1787
01:46:15.711 --> 01:46:18.080
telling you Christopher Columbus,
he's a wonderful man.

1788
01:46:19.370 --> 01:46:21.830
I don't remember what they told us about Christopher Columbus,

1789
01:46:21.831 --> 01:46:24.950
but I do remember that they were saying that he didn't really land in America.

1790
01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:28.790
Literally figured that out.
I was like,
what?
And they were like,
yeah,

1791
01:46:28.791 --> 01:46:32.240
you landed in like with The Bahamas or some shit like the West indies.

1792
01:46:32.270 --> 01:46:36.710
How about where he landed?
How about the pledge of allegiance?
How about that?

1793
01:46:36.711 --> 01:46:40.860
What else?
Fun Component of how it changed.
The pledge of allegiance changed.

1794
01:46:42.030 --> 01:46:45.020
It became undergone during the commie scare.

1795
01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:50.130
It used to be one nation indivisible with liberty and justice

1796
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:54.480
<v 0>for all,
and then it became one nation under God,
indivisible,</v>

1797
01:46:54.481 --> 01:46:57.540
with liberty and justice for all.
It was a Christian cool.

1798
01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:02.400
In order to ward off that dirty communists as dirty Red Russians.

1799
01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:04.590
They want to take away your cigars,

1800
01:47:04.650 --> 01:47:06.910
<v 3>but I really love that they,
when people,</v>

1801
01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:10.390
there's a spacial relationship that fundamentalists have with God.

1802
01:47:10.391 --> 01:47:14.020
He's like lives in the top floor apartment and they're under God.

1803
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:18.490
Isn't that a strange,
yeah.
It's like God,
God,
God doesn't say hang out down here.

1804
01:47:18.491 --> 01:47:21.890
This is kind of like the the,
I guess it's like a,

1805
01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:26.650
the fucking bad part of town or something.
He barely comes here.
He's above us.

1806
01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:30.990
<v 0>Did it once and we didn't listen.
We didn't tell each other.</v>

1807
01:47:30.991 --> 01:47:33.840
He told us to tell each other and we did a shit job of it.

1808
01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:37.530
And because of that suffer.
Oh yeah.
By the way,
because of Adam and eve suffer,

1809
01:47:37.531 --> 01:47:41.400
suffer,
live with sin.
Live cover your clothes,
your cover herself with calls.

1810
01:47:41.430 --> 01:47:42.750
You're naked.
You're disgusting.

1811
01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:47.700
That was because of two people 6,000 years ago.
We're all still fucked.

1812
01:47:48.260 --> 01:47:53.180
Yeah.
They fucked up.
They,
she that crazy bitch.
Eight the snake.
And it's always

1813
01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:59.020
apple.
We'd be happen.
Yeah.

1814
01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:02.840
If she's like,
oh,
I shouldn't eat the apple,
I should eat the apple.
She goes,

1815
01:48:02.841 --> 01:48:04.170
how about if I eat you stupid?

1816
01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:09.300
She figures out how to make fire and she cooks this snake over a stick.

1817
01:48:10.670 --> 01:48:15.140
Adam comes back.
Did you really Cameron yourself to show you so blowing yourself?

1818
01:48:15.170 --> 01:48:19.280
No,
I was doing deep throating this.
Now I know what you're doing.
Um,

1819
01:48:19.670 --> 01:48:24.200
the uh,
the,
the story is so ridiculous and that's the,
that is the story.

1820
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:25.303
I mean that is,

1821
01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:27.900
<v 3>well,
the literal translation of the story is ridiculous,</v>

1822
01:48:27.901 --> 01:48:32.060
but what it's talking about isn't that ridiculous.
It's talking about the,
uh,

1823
01:48:32.230 --> 01:48:36.180
development of the neocortex so that people gained awareness of their,

1824
01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:39.230
of themselves.
You know,
that's what it's talking.
So eating of the apples,

1825
01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:40.720
developing the NEOCORTEX.
Yeah.

1826
01:48:40.830 --> 01:48:45.570
Eating of the apple is the thing where we go from background actors and nature

1827
01:48:45.571 --> 01:48:48.330
to foreground actors where we're separated from nature.

1828
01:48:48.331 --> 01:48:52.020
We don't now we're what now we're,
we don't,
we were individuals.

1829
01:48:52.021 --> 01:48:54.870
Cause when if you're an individual then that's when all the shame and feeling

1830
01:48:54.871 --> 01:48:59.250
weird about being naked comes from identifying yourself as a self.

1831
01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:01.600
You know,
that's when you start like paying it to,

1832
01:49:01.601 --> 01:49:04.140
you're paying attention to yourself.
If you want to start wearing clothes,

1833
01:49:04.190 --> 01:49:08.840
<v 0>then what is the forbidden fruit represent?
Because the,
the,
the,
you know,</v>

1834
01:49:08.841 --> 01:49:13.660
if you want to go deep,
the um,
what the fuck's guy's name?
The guy that,

1835
01:49:13.810 --> 01:49:16.190
there was a guy who died,
who was it,

1836
01:49:16.191 --> 01:49:18.920
not to just the John Marco Allegro version of it,

1837
01:49:18.921 --> 01:49:23.680
but several other biblical scholars want to point to the fact that the Amanita

1838
01:49:23.690 --> 01:49:27.140
miscarry looks like an apple and that that represents the apple.

1839
01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:32.070
<v 3>Sure.
I,
it could be.
I saw it's v I mean it seems like a Psychedelic,</v>

1840
01:49:32.071 --> 01:49:34.080
doesn't it?
They say when you drink Iowasca,

1841
01:49:34.350 --> 01:49:37.520
you tend to see a serpent thing and uh,

1842
01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:42.060
you see a giant serpent and here's a serpent telling people eat of this fruit.

1843
01:49:42.330 --> 01:49:47.330
So it seems like it's this invitation from nature to wake up or do evolve

1844
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:52.120
<v 1>and could also just be incredibly shitty story that's being told down by people</v>

1845
01:49:52.121 --> 01:49:55.960
were scared of snakes,
you know,
I don't think you're scary.

1846
01:49:55.961 --> 01:50:00.880
They fuck you up there?
I don't think so.
I think it's,
I think it's primitive.

1847
01:50:01.150 --> 01:50:02.260
I think it's a primitive story.

1848
01:50:02.261 --> 01:50:07.210
But I think symbolically a dude had an apple and he didn't want people eating

1849
01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:10.000
his apples and they said,
listen,
if you come near that motherfucker,

1850
01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:13.780
a snake's gonna get ya.
Yeah,
yeah.
I don't know.

1851
01:50:14.830 --> 01:50:18.010
I'm sorry.
Symbolically you said you think symbolically.
Yeah.

1852
01:50:18.011 --> 01:50:22.070
I think that that's some pretty,
I think it's,
you know,
mythology has got all,

1853
01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:25.810
not the symbols and mythology or if literally are always ridiculous,

1854
01:50:25.811 --> 01:50:27.340
but when you go to the deeper levels,

1855
01:50:27.341 --> 01:50:31.450
they're pretty interesting because there it's still the human mind trying to

1856
01:50:31.451 --> 01:50:34.520
make sense of this thing that we're in.
You know,
and it's,
and,

1857
01:50:34.521 --> 01:50:36.790
and people have always been smart.

1858
01:50:36.970 --> 01:50:39.880
It's just the symbols that they have to articulate their understanding of the

1859
01:50:39.881 --> 01:50:44.080
universe change from generation to generation.

1860
01:50:44.470 --> 01:50:45.190
Not only that,

1861
01:50:45.190 --> 01:50:50.190
it's incredibly difficult to decipher in an ancient language and figure out how

1862
01:50:52.151 --> 01:50:53.800
to represent that today.

1863
01:50:54.010 --> 01:50:57.610
Completely out of the cultural context of the times we were talking about

1864
01:50:57.611 --> 01:51:01.270
watching the twilight zone from 1963 puts you in that time.

1865
01:51:01.870 --> 01:51:05.650
It's like this weirdness about the way they communicate with each other,

1866
01:51:05.651 --> 01:51:08.470
the way the guys will lighting a cigarette on the plane,
the whole thing.

1867
01:51:08.770 --> 01:51:12.190
It's a time capsule.
Exactly.
It's a time capsule.

1868
01:51:12.330 --> 01:51:15.160
And as is any biblical work,

1869
01:51:15.161 --> 01:51:20.161
any religious texts and even shittier version of it cause it's so hard.

1870
01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:21.430
It's so fascinating.

1871
01:51:21.431 --> 01:51:24.940
It's so interesting if you really stop to think about it that these people were

1872
01:51:24.941 --> 01:51:26.490
so involved in these thoughts.

1873
01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:30.010
They had to write them down back when they barely knew how to write anything

1874
01:51:30.011 --> 01:51:34.060
down.
If you look at cuneiform and those ancient Sumerian tablets,

1875
01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:36.850
that is some fascinating shit man.

1876
01:51:36.851 --> 01:51:41.620
Because it's just like lines that go this way and that way and down.
Yeah.

1877
01:51:41.710 --> 01:51:43.390
Like old school,
he nails.

1878
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:46.800
You ever see an old house like an old New England house?
They,

1879
01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:49.030
when people do construction on those houses,

1880
01:51:49.031 --> 01:51:52.090
they'll pull them apart and they have these weird nails and the nails.

1881
01:51:52.091 --> 01:51:54.810
They don't look like the nails that we have today because they were all like

1882
01:51:54.820 --> 01:51:55.900
handmade.
Yeah.

1883
01:51:55.930 --> 01:52:00.190
Or with a press and melted into a thing and when the the nails were,

1884
01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:05.220
they were more like a like almost like all like an letter I without the dot on

1885
01:52:05.351 --> 01:52:07.360
the end of it.
It was like a weird looking nail.

1886
01:52:07.450 --> 01:52:09.010
Well that's what the cuneiform looks like.

1887
01:52:09.011 --> 01:52:12.070
It just looks like a bunch of nails like this way,
nails and that way,

1888
01:52:12.071 --> 01:52:14.920
nails and you got to figure out what the fuck that means.

1889
01:52:14.921 --> 01:52:18.940
And translated into modern day English.
Yeah,
that's nuts.

1890
01:52:18.970 --> 01:52:23.560
It's impossible for us to really grasp what's in the Dead Sea scrolls when

1891
01:52:23.561 --> 01:52:27.640
they're talking about reading Aramaic that was written on animal skins and

1892
01:52:27.641 --> 01:52:32.140
hidden in caves in Qumran.
God knows when,
literally,

1893
01:52:32.410 --> 01:52:36.760
and they find these things thousands of years older than any version of the

1894
01:52:36.761 --> 01:52:39.670
Bible that we,
you know,
have ever read before.

1895
01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:41.740
I think it's like a thousand years old,

1896
01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:44.860
older than the oldest versions of some of these stories.

1897
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:47.640
<v 2>Yeah.
There.
Yeah.
You know,</v>

1898
01:52:47.650 --> 01:52:52.650
what was that lifelike men that was a car that was a bizarre life.

1899
01:52:53.151 --> 01:52:55.520
And where were our brains?
How much,
you know,

1900
01:52:55.521 --> 01:52:58.910
because we do know that the human brain evolves.
The human brain has developed.

1901
01:52:58.911 --> 01:53:02.560
How much does,
uh,
how thousand 5,000 years ago,

1902
01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:07.190
how similar to the way brains are now.
We're brains then.

1903
01:53:07.550 --> 01:53:10.680
You know,
we,
we know that just in medieval times,
people,

1904
01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:14.510
people were much smaller than they are now because of nutritional deficiencies.

1905
01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:16.580
What were their brains like?
Well,

1906
01:53:16.581 --> 01:53:20.780
they're saying that our brains are actually shrinking.
Um,

1907
01:53:20.890 --> 01:53:24.240
this is an interesting thing.
Uh,
the,
the,

1908
01:53:24.250 --> 01:53:28.530
it's in discover magazine,
they're talking about how,
um,

1909
01:53:28.610 --> 01:53:33.590
there's leading theories about why human brains have,
uh,
become,

1910
01:53:34.730 --> 01:53:36.830
become smaller since the stone age.

1911
01:53:37.130 --> 01:53:39.790
And here's something cool for all you people that hate apple.
My,

1912
01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:45.360
my browser is crashed.
So it was like fuck,

1913
01:53:46.110 --> 01:53:50.390
fuck.
And to use a PC Dunkin's gun gun PC.
By the way,

1914
01:53:50.450 --> 01:53:54.920
I have gone PC.
I'm born again.
Pieces like apple or others.
No,
it's not.

1915
01:53:54.921 --> 01:53:55.850
I don't like apple.

1916
01:53:55.851 --> 01:53:59.930
It's just I like being free to use any kind of software.

1917
01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:06.710
I don't want to be sucked into something.
Any kind of sashes,
techno pit.

1918
01:54:07.580 --> 01:54:11.510
Steve Jobs is dancing with Jesus anyway.
You sound like a Tom Mccormick.

1919
01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:12.590
He says that shit too.

1920
01:54:12.710 --> 01:54:16.100
We're going to figure out that like the apple back in the day was actually apple

1921
01:54:16.101 --> 01:54:20.060
and then like the tablets were actually I pads and all this shit like that.
No,

1922
01:54:20.061 --> 01:54:24.530
we're not.
No.
You know when your job's just created this whole entire room,

1923
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:27.590
Steve Jobs is God.
Yeah.
He totally,

1924
01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:33.080
Oh,
here's my issue.
Ready for this.
Here's my beautiful issue.

1925
01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:37.770
Flash has crashed.
Yeah.
He shift saw that coming.
Wait,

1926
01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:40.610
where are you getting flashed on?
I usually home Google chrome,

1927
01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:44.030
so it was a Google sad,
sad,
and it's not even a Google thing.

1928
01:54:44.031 --> 01:54:46.790
It's just flash itself.
I still like apple man,

1929
01:54:46.791 --> 01:54:50.960
but my experience with this new PC I,
it's,
it's so amazing.

1930
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:53.990
It's just so amazing.
What's so amazing about it?
Video Games.

1931
01:54:53.991 --> 01:54:58.660
He's just talking about video.
I want to say that's not the case.
Well,

1932
01:54:58.670 --> 01:55:00.530
I told them,
wait till you get to the first virus.

1933
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:03.270
Wait to get your first virus and you send everyone,

1934
01:55:03.290 --> 01:55:07.030
you know ads to get condoms at a discount.
Yeah,

1935
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:11.810
I already got one of those.
You've got a virus.
I got a virus in apple.

1936
01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:13.730
Did you really got some kind of thing?

1937
01:55:13.731 --> 01:55:18.731
I sent my dad like some ad for vacuum cleaners or do you have a hotmail or Gmail

1938
01:55:20.250 --> 01:55:24.410
email?
Yeah.
You got hacked son.
I got hacked.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look,

1939
01:55:24.411 --> 01:55:26.000
I know there's dangerous,
but guess what?

1940
01:55:26.001 --> 01:55:28.080
There's dangerous and all great endeavors.
I don't need,

1941
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:32.900
I don't need Steve jobs to wrap his fucking nerf around my experience of the

1942
01:55:32.901 --> 01:55:36.350
Internet.
I want to be able to fuck up my machine.
Wow.
Well,

1943
01:55:36.351 --> 01:55:38.750
you say that before you lose your first manuscript.

1944
01:55:39.670 --> 01:55:41.000
I'm not going to do something.

1945
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:43.980
What if you're writing something brilliant and that gets eaten up?
It's in my,

1946
01:55:43.981 --> 01:55:47.790
it's in the cloud or somebody hacks in your easily hackable computer and it

1947
01:55:47.791 --> 01:55:50.940
turns on your Webcam and records everything you do at night and sells it as a

1948
01:55:50.941 --> 01:55:54.660
podcast.
I promise you,
you can already imagine what that is.

1949
01:55:54.661 --> 01:55:56.820
It's me dumb Lee staring into the computer

1950
01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:03.150
drinking beer,
a string of drool running down my face is,

1951
01:56:03.151 --> 01:56:04.980
I pretend to be a fantasy warrior,

1952
01:56:05.010 --> 01:56:09.940
so it started off the number one game that you play now.
Do you play starcraft?

1953
01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:11.670
Oh really?
I'm over.

1954
01:56:11.671 --> 01:56:16.200
I've been humiliated by star calls because so many levels I'll never play again.

1955
01:56:16.230 --> 01:56:19.320
I failed the creator.
A creator of a venture time kicked your ass.

1956
01:56:19.321 --> 01:56:22.570
I heard Neil Neil.

1957
01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:27.300
He was the first game that we played.
He shocked me.

1958
01:56:27.301 --> 01:56:30.650
Pendleton Ward sharked me.
He acted like he hadn't played star craft,

1959
01:56:30.651 --> 01:56:32.580
so I was just fucking around and he did.

1960
01:56:32.581 --> 01:56:37.440
He did a ridiculous mutualist Grush and expanded as basis to the point where

1961
01:56:37.441 --> 01:56:42.270
there is no way that I could overcome as the economy.
You're such a Dork.
Second,

1962
01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:46.860
the second,
our second bat battle,
which is on line,

1963
01:56:46.861 --> 01:56:47.760
you can watch it.

1964
01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.920
I destroyed him and humiliated him is on twitch or something like that.

1965
01:56:52.921 --> 01:56:55.590
Or twitch TV or it's on twitch TV.

1966
01:56:56.850 --> 01:56:58.500
Actually watched a little bit of it.
That was fun.

1967
01:57:00.510 --> 01:57:04.740
You watch the actual contest itself?
No,
it,
that's when you really a loser.

1968
01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:08.320
You're not even playing a video game.
You're watching Dunkin playbook.

1969
01:57:08.330 --> 01:57:12.440
We love watching people play video,
man.
No,
we got,

1970
01:57:12.441 --> 01:57:16.590
we had a professional starcraft commentator who commentate for us and he was

1971
01:57:16.591 --> 01:57:19.620
just like rolling his eyes the whole time.
Like,
what are you a terrible,

1972
01:57:20.150 --> 01:57:22.980
we are terrible.
So it's a very sarcastic,

1973
01:57:23.190 --> 01:57:27.630
it's like you doing UFC commentary.
If me and Ari started wrestling,

1974
01:57:28.070 --> 01:57:32.250
it's like that.
I would be very enthusiastic about that.
I'm a professional.

1975
01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:36.900
I'm a professional man.
Well he,
he um,

1976
01:57:38.130 --> 01:57:42.420
he definitely should have.
The way he cast it was funny and it was good.
Yeah.

1977
01:57:42.421 --> 01:57:46.380
There's a bunch of comics fighting next Sunday.
Russell pewters.
Oh yeah.

1978
01:57:46.381 --> 01:57:49.770
What does that about?
Those guys are going to get hurt.
Yeah,
they have like boom,

1979
01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:54.510
Shaka Laka.
[inaudible] going to have actual fights.
Joshua,
where boxing matches.

1980
01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:57.830
It's at a gym here.
I'll find out,
but it's a,
yeah,
it's,

1981
01:57:57.870 --> 01:58:01.680
it's actually going to be funny.
PJ's fighting.
Oh God.

1982
01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:06.150
Just fighting a date.
That one guy that has the date cerebral palsy.

1983
01:58:06.580 --> 01:58:09.280
That's so wrong.
Lord of the flies,
man.

1984
01:58:09.290 --> 01:58:14.010
How can you have a guy with cerebral palsy box?
Have you ever heard PJ cough,

1985
01:58:15.110 --> 01:58:18.180
coughing fit?
You can move for a couple seconds and hit that guy.

1986
01:58:18.181 --> 01:58:20.880
All you have to do is hit them.
Once you guys get cerebral palsy.

1987
01:58:20.900 --> 01:58:25.430
It's so fucked up.
It's really fucked up.
That's so wrong.
I'm not even,

1988
01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:27.840
I don't even want to talk about,
don't.
We'll talk about that.

1989
01:58:27.850 --> 01:58:30.180
You guys are going to start.
I didn't know that they were going to do that.

1990
01:58:30.210 --> 01:58:31.290
I don't know they were going to do that.

1991
01:58:31.291 --> 01:58:34.530
I don't want to be a part of the Mondays on junk.
I don't care.
I don't want it.

1992
01:58:34.860 --> 01:58:36.930
I think that's fucked up.
I didn't know they were doing that.

1993
01:58:36.931 --> 01:58:40.320
That shit's ridiculous.
Well,
stop talking about it.

1994
01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:42.070
I have to to Russell and see what

1995
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:46.360
<v 0>the fuck he's thinking.
He's crazy.
If that's true.
Davies strong man.</v>

1996
01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:48.070
He's been in a lot of fights

1997
01:58:52.090 --> 01:58:55.970
and actually I think he's going to beat Pj.
Dude,
a guy with cerebral palsy.

1998
01:58:55.971 --> 01:58:57.160
You shouldn't be fighting somebody.

1999
01:58:57.310 --> 01:58:59.580
It doesn't already have a problem with his brain of theirs.

2000
01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:03.940
There's a possibility that he can get hit.
It's really too nervous system.
Right.

2001
01:59:04.030 --> 01:59:06.520
The thing,
man,
Guy was the center of your nervous system.

2002
01:59:07.140 --> 01:59:08.530
To me it doesn't sound appealing,

2003
01:59:08.531 --> 01:59:13.480
but if a guy with cerebral palsy wants to fight,
he gets to fight.

2004
01:59:13.690 --> 01:59:16.750
You know,
I,
I'm sure that he's making the decision himself.

2005
01:59:16.751 --> 01:59:21.250
He's like people rebo palsy or they have,
they're thinking it's fine.

2006
01:59:21.251 --> 01:59:25.300
They just have this unfortunate,
um,
disability.
So if he wants to fight,

2007
01:59:25.301 --> 01:59:27.220
he should be allowed to fight.
You know,

2008
01:59:27.221 --> 01:59:31.030
it's kind of empowering in a weird way though.
I wouldn't want to watch it and I,

2009
01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:33.130
I wouldn't want to watch it.
I just think it's,

2010
01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:37.330
I just think it's not right to explore the guy if he wants to go do it on his

2011
01:59:37.331 --> 01:59:41.800
own.
But to offer him like some sort of a situation where this is occurring for

2012
01:59:41.801 --> 01:59:45.760
someone to do that I think is,
it's probably he probably wants to do it.

2013
01:59:45.761 --> 01:59:49.450
I bet he does.
I mean,
but whatever.
I wouldn't want to be a part of it.

2014
01:59:50.470 --> 01:59:53.230
I wouldn't want to be a part of it either,
but I wouldn't want to tell.
I mean,

2015
01:59:53.231 --> 01:59:55.270
then again,
what if he was super enthusiastic about it?

2016
01:59:55.271 --> 01:59:56.980
I don't really know about training and everything.

2017
01:59:57.670 --> 02:00:01.030
You can train if you have cerebral palsy.
He's fine.
He walks a fine.

2018
02:00:01.290 --> 02:00:03.760
Brian's a doctor.
The only thing he does is,
you know,
he has that little,

2019
02:00:03.761 --> 02:00:06.880
like when he walks he has like kind of little like kind of thing like that.

2020
02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:10.980
But I mean he,
you know,
he was normal.
Look,
if I,
if I,

2021
02:00:10.990 --> 02:00:12.280
if I had cerebral palsy,

2022
02:00:12.281 --> 02:00:17.220
I would want it to be able to fight if I wanted to fight,
that's for sure.
But,
uh,

2023
02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:21.550
I wouldn't,
I don't know.
He's cool.
I love that guy.
Yeah.
He's a nice guy.

2024
02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:24.640
Funny too also.
Well,

2025
02:00:24.910 --> 02:00:27.130
I hate to see somebody like that.

2026
02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:30.190
I hate to see somebody who can't move correctly,
you know,

2027
02:00:30.191 --> 02:00:31.960
get involved in something that can get them hurt.

2028
02:00:32.250 --> 02:00:35.230
But it's like the whole idea of a combat sports,

2029
02:00:35.231 --> 02:00:37.900
whether it's boxing or something,
it's being able to move your body correctly.

2030
02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:42.700
Otherwise it's not really fair.
I don't know exactly how cerebral palsy ails you,

2031
02:00:42.701 --> 02:00:46.000
so maybe I'm talking out of my ass,
but it seems like a,

2032
02:00:46.170 --> 02:00:48.460
it wouldn't be a great fucking idea.
Yeah.
You just have more,

2033
02:00:48.461 --> 02:00:52.540
probably more familiarity with what damage can happen to a person and a fight.

2034
02:00:52.570 --> 02:00:56.140
How about death?
Yeah,
I mean they have people who can pretty big gloves on.

2035
02:00:56.170 --> 02:01:01.060
That means nothing.
The women,
a woman,
uh,
who was,
uh,
a father or a mother of,

2036
02:01:01.061 --> 02:01:05.980
um,
uh,
at least one child died recently at a tough woman contest.

2037
02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:09.280
She didn't have any money.
She stepped in big giant pillow,
gloves,

2038
02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:13.210
got knocked out and died.
It happens,
it fucking happens.

2039
02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:17.440
And I'm sure the woman who killed her probably doesn't hit as hard as PJ.

2040
02:01:18.100 --> 02:01:22.900
Weird Shit happens to the human body when it gets hit.
You Fall,

2041
02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:25.960
you hit your head on the ground,
you can get knocked out by a punch.

2042
02:01:25.961 --> 02:01:29.230
It's not even that hard and fall and bang your head off the ground and die.

2043
02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:33.100
It happens all the time.
All the time.

2044
02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:35.110
And when you're talking about a boxer dying,

2045
02:01:35.111 --> 02:01:38.260
what's been a long time since boxers have died because they're really good at

2046
02:01:38.261 --> 02:01:39.190
stopping fights.

2047
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:44.090
They're really good at doing cat scans and all these different Mris to make sure

2048
02:01:44.091 --> 02:01:45.770
that you're safe before you go in there.

2049
02:01:45.890 --> 02:01:47.660
And they found a bunch of things doing that.

2050
02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:50.900
Athletic commissions have found during their examinations.
They found like,

2051
02:01:51.170 --> 02:01:54.500
like blood clots that have ended guys' careers because they didn't even know

2052
02:01:54.501 --> 02:01:57.200
they had them in there.
And if they burst it would be an aneurysm.

2053
02:01:57.320 --> 02:01:59.480
This is like real issues that people have found.

2054
02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:03.830
So to take these guys and just throw them in there without any proper physical

2055
02:02:03.831 --> 02:02:08.630
examination to me is ridiculous.
Yeah,
you're right.
That's dangerous.

2056
02:02:08.970 --> 02:02:13.270
They're very fragile people.
These are not like robust,
healthy people.
My,
my,

2057
02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:15.750
I had a roommate once who,
uh,

2058
02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:19.760
whose brother went to jail because he punched the guy in front of a bar and the

2059
02:02:19.761 --> 02:02:22.820
guy fell backwards,
hit his head on the concrete and died right there.

2060
02:02:24.020 --> 02:02:27.110
Shattered his little bird shella head.

2061
02:02:28.670 --> 02:02:31.250
Wow.
Yeah.
It can happen,
man.

2062
02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:34.310
It most certainly can happen and most certainly can happen.

2063
02:02:34.311 --> 02:02:38.600
There's just no doubt about it.
If you get hit and you fall down.

2064
02:02:39.060 --> 02:02:41.930
It happened to a guy that Kevin James used to work with.

2065
02:02:42.290 --> 02:02:46.100
He was a bouncer in Long Island and the guy hit a guy,
guy falls back,

2066
02:02:46.190 --> 02:02:50.210
bangs his head off the concrete and that's it.
I hate that.
And fight videos.

2067
02:02:50.211 --> 02:02:53.540
When you see the fuck,
did you see that fight video,
uh,

2068
02:02:53.541 --> 02:02:58.400
where the guy actually knocks the guy down then runs backwards and jumps on his

2069
02:02:58.401 --> 02:03:02.390
head?
No.
Oh,
it's nasty,
man.

2070
02:03:02.391 --> 02:03:04.730
It's nasty.
I don't even want to see it.

2071
02:03:04.731 --> 02:03:09.050
I've seen so many horrible things that people have done to each other on the

2072
02:03:09.051 --> 02:03:11.630
Internet.
I mean,
if you watch enough of that world star hip hop,

2073
02:03:11.660 --> 02:03:15.120
there's a certain point in time where you're just give up on people.
There's,

2074
02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:19.220
there's so many times where guys got knocked out in these videos and then people

2075
02:03:19.221 --> 02:03:21.020
just take shots at them while they're out cold,

2076
02:03:21.021 --> 02:03:25.010
like random people run up and kick him in the head and not just one.
I mean many,

2077
02:03:25.011 --> 02:03:29.570
many,
many people do it.
There's this one guy who got fucking pounded on.

2078
02:03:29.571 --> 02:03:31.700
It was horrific.
People just,

2079
02:03:31.701 --> 02:03:35.600
everybody just took turns running over to this guy and kicking him in the head

2080
02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:40.760
and you're watching this video of just miss and you would like what creates a

2081
02:03:40.761 --> 02:03:42.650
human being so cruel?

2082
02:03:43.010 --> 02:03:46.460
What creates a human being that's just seeking to hurt?

2083
02:03:46.490 --> 02:03:50.120
Like that hurt just some random person.
This guy gets the green light,

2084
02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:55.610
stomp,
kick,
punch.
I mean it's horrific shit man.

2085
02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:59.450
What do you think creates a human being?
Has to be the way they're developed,

2086
02:03:59.510 --> 02:04:01.460
the way they're,
they're growing up,
the way the,

2087
02:04:01.461 --> 02:04:03.170
the what they're exposed to as children.

2088
02:04:03.410 --> 02:04:05.630
It has to be what they're exposed to in high school and what,

2089
02:04:05.631 --> 02:04:07.970
how much love do they have in their community,
how much,

2090
02:04:07.971 --> 02:04:09.680
how much hatred and anger,
how much,

2091
02:04:09.890 --> 02:04:12.320
how much danger is there and everyday life for them.

2092
02:04:12.321 --> 02:04:13.970
It seems to be incredibly high.

2093
02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:18.650
That's the only way you could imagine that someone would be doing something

2094
02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:23.360
openly and wantonly so cruel knowing that it will be embraced by all the people

2095
02:04:23.361 --> 02:04:24.194
around him.

2096
02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:28.010
It wasn't like one person kicked the guy while he was down and everybody jumped.

2097
02:04:28.011 --> 02:04:31.520
That guy,
no,
everybody went,
you got knocked the fuck out

2098
02:04:33.770 --> 02:04:38.100
and they run around and punch and kick and and they know that they're going to

2099
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:40.950
<v 1>be accepted by their peers.</v>

2100
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:44.400
All the people that are around them or allowing them to do this freely.

2101
02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:48.780
No one has stepped up for humanity because they haven't experienced it.

2102
02:04:49.140 --> 02:04:53.970
They don't even know humanity.
They know a hard scrabble world fucked up people,

2103
02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:59.240
drug addicts and drug dealers and criminals and poverty and lies and rape and

2104
02:04:59.971 --> 02:05:02.770
that's all they know.
They you what it,

2105
02:05:03.150 --> 02:05:08.150
what it is is they are reacting to anger and they're reacting to anger and they,

2106
02:05:12.810 --> 02:05:15.180
they have an ethic,
whoever it is.

2107
02:05:15.210 --> 02:05:20.210
Many people have the ethic of one upping the other person they want to one up.

2108
02:05:20.370 --> 02:05:22.020
You know what I'm saying?
It's a vengeance ethic.

2109
02:05:22.021 --> 02:05:25.530
People have a vengeance ethic where you know that thing where you get in an

2110
02:05:25.531 --> 02:05:30.150
argument with somebody and you say some particularly cutting thing and then you

2111
02:05:30.151 --> 02:05:35.151
walk away and for a second year egos like you really got them.

2112
02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:39.240
They're going to be wincing now that that part of yourself.

2113
02:05:39.660 --> 02:05:43.650
People live in that state constantly where when they move through the world,

2114
02:05:43.651 --> 02:05:46.710
they're always trying to hurt and to get a one up on another person.

2115
02:05:46.711 --> 02:05:49.950
It's that always one.
It's not being able to let go of anger.
That's what it is.

2116
02:05:49.951 --> 02:05:53.980
Yeah.
Oh,
I've had huge problems with that in my life.
Me Too.
Well,

2117
02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:58.410
me in particular because I developed as a high school person,

2118
02:05:58.411 --> 02:06:02.910
I went from being someone who was incredibly insecure and very nervous about

2119
02:06:02.940 --> 02:06:04.980
just social interaction.
Very,
very,

2120
02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:07.950
I did not feel like a worthy,

2121
02:06:07.980 --> 02:06:12.900
worthwhile person to becoming obsessed with martial arts too.

2122
02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:18.080
Most of my high school time and well into my early twenties was spent constantly

2123
02:06:18.571 --> 02:06:20.370
fighting,
constantly going to tournament's,

2124
02:06:20.371 --> 02:06:24.870
constantly competing in this really high level,
high stressful situation.

2125
02:06:25.230 --> 02:06:27.000
So I got to see this,

2126
02:06:27.150 --> 02:06:32.150
this benefit of having this explosive side of me that I could just turn on.

2127
02:06:32.310 --> 02:06:37.310
I literally developed being the one who was willing to embrace violence at a

2128
02:06:37.381 --> 02:06:40.620
moment's notice,
knowing if it's coming,
if something happens,

2129
02:06:40.650 --> 02:06:42.060
I gotta be ready right now.

2130
02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:47.120
So I was always ready to go because my mind had me programmed like in order to

2131
02:06:47.191 --> 02:06:50.910
be successful that I was always ready to go so I would have a real problem,

2132
02:06:50.940 --> 02:06:54.400
not escalating things because I was always like I,
yes,
I,

2133
02:06:54.480 --> 02:06:57.810
there was an eventuality to escalation that I had already come to grips with

2134
02:06:57.930 --> 02:07:00.270
that maybe other people were like two or three steps away from,

2135
02:07:00.630 --> 02:07:04.950
but I was there immediately and I wasn't,
didn't want to let it go and it's bad.

2136
02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:06.810
It's a bad aspect of my personality.

2137
02:07:06.811 --> 02:07:11.811
That was mainly based on developing as a person and as a,

2138
02:07:12.211 --> 02:07:16.680
a person who just began to respect myself through competition.

2139
02:07:16.860 --> 02:07:19.470
So if I felt like it was a competition,
any kind of competition,

2140
02:07:19.471 --> 02:07:23.840
they sort of social competition,
I was like fuck you,
I wanted to take it to,

2141
02:07:23.910 --> 02:07:28.830
you know,
def con four and wanting to win.
Yeah.
And it's that desire to win.

2142
02:07:28.980 --> 02:07:32.280
It's that weird desire.
It's not,
it's fun to win.
That's fine.

2143
02:07:32.281 --> 02:07:36.070
Nothing wrong with winning,
but it's that desire to always be

2144
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:39.670
<v 4>the victor to always win.
That is a poisonous,</v>

2145
02:07:39.850 --> 02:07:44.170
poisonous aspect of the self.
And when you start wetting yourself,

2146
02:07:44.171 --> 02:07:47.620
lose,
you know,
arguments in particular,
you know,

2147
02:07:47.621 --> 02:07:50.290
if someone's mad at you and they're saying shitty things to you instead of like

2148
02:07:50.291 --> 02:07:52.270
trying to one up them with some shitty your thing,

2149
02:07:53.110 --> 02:07:55.360
this is something I'm working on,
we'll hear about even better.

2150
02:07:55.361 --> 02:07:58.930
Don't even participate in it.
Yeah.
That's the best part.
If someone look,

2151
02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:03.160
I have been,
I'm the last person to talk about talking shit to people.

2152
02:08:03.161 --> 02:08:06.190
There's a hundred videos online you could find if me talking shit to people.

2153
02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:09.190
For the most part though,
I rarely ever do it.

2154
02:08:09.430 --> 02:08:12.100
There just happens to be videos of it.
So if you add it up,

2155
02:08:12.190 --> 02:08:14.950
and I'm way less active at it today than ever before,

2156
02:08:15.190 --> 02:08:20.190
but what I tried to do always is just get out of it and I don't,

2157
02:08:20.890 --> 02:08:24.100
the last thing I want to do at this point in my life is hurt someone's feelings.

2158
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:27.790
If I think they'll laugh,
I'll say something fucked up like at a comedy show.

2159
02:08:27.850 --> 02:08:29.320
If someone had goals,
I'll say something fucked up.

2160
02:08:29.470 --> 02:08:31.000
But I'm hoping they're laughing at it.

2161
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:33.610
I don't want anybody to get their feelings hurt.
No,

2162
02:08:33.611 --> 02:08:35.110
I don't think you're like that man.

2163
02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:39.660
But I think that all of us at one point were like that and have been like that.

2164
02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:40.691
Yeah.
And you know what?

2165
02:08:40.691 --> 02:08:43.650
An interesting thing that you said once that I think is really important.

2166
02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:47.890
I'm going to remind you of it.
You said that you are not the guy that you are.

2167
02:08:47.891 --> 02:08:50.020
When you're angry,
you're not the guy.
Like,

2168
02:08:50.021 --> 02:08:53.560
it's not just because you did something stupid wants or said something he

2169
02:08:53.561 --> 02:08:55.450
shouldn't have said or been mean once.

2170
02:08:55.730 --> 02:09:00.730
It doesn't mean you're a mean guy and people try to define you by one action or

2171
02:09:01.451 --> 02:09:06.451
by one one behavior that you exhibited and they'll try to define you forever by

2172
02:09:06.641 --> 02:09:09.880
that.
And it's,
it's a,
it's a weird thing that we do to each other.

2173
02:09:10.030 --> 02:09:13.660
It's almost like,
no,
you lost.
Yeah,
it's a form of competition.

2174
02:09:13.810 --> 02:09:16.690
I got the score right there.
You said this,

2175
02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:18.310
you shouldn't have said that because you know,

2176
02:09:18.311 --> 02:09:21.660
I feel about this news and there's no,
you know,

2177
02:09:21.661 --> 02:09:24.500
there's almost a no compromise situation there.
Yeah.

2178
02:09:24.550 --> 02:09:28.510
Well that's that same thing man.
That's that thing of like wanting to win.

2179
02:09:28.750 --> 02:09:29.830
Like I was,

2180
02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:34.060
I went to eat dinner at this bar and I was sitting next to this lady and you

2181
02:09:34.061 --> 02:09:37.360
know how like sometimes you're sitting next to somebody and you can tell they

2182
02:09:37.361 --> 02:09:41.850
have some,
they,
they,
they're,
they're having a problem in life or something.
You,

2183
02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:43.690
you either kind of looking for help.

2184
02:09:43.691 --> 02:09:46.040
Sometimes they get around people and you can just feel it.
They,

2185
02:09:46.041 --> 02:09:49.360
they're lost or they want something and like I'm just sitting there eating and

2186
02:09:49.361 --> 02:09:50.860
she starts talking to me.
Right.

2187
02:09:50.861 --> 02:09:55.861
And then right away she's goes into talking about how her sister was getting

2188
02:09:56.231 --> 02:10:01.231
married and her sister invited her up to big Sur to go to the wedding and got

2189
02:10:02.231 --> 02:10:05.440
there and there was nowhere to stay.
And her sister,

2190
02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:09.450
her steps or her sister in law's a bitch.
That was the story she was telling.

2191
02:10:09.670 --> 02:10:13.210
But you're looking at someone who's like caught.

2192
02:10:13.211 --> 02:10:16.150
That's just one little piece of the puzzle for them.

2193
02:10:16.250 --> 02:10:19.360
They are locked into this world view of fighting.

2194
02:10:19.361 --> 02:10:22.120
They're constantly on the offensive,

2195
02:10:22.121 --> 02:10:25.720
trying to like poke back at the world and that's the one little symbol of a

2196
02:10:25.721 --> 02:10:27.640
thing that she could,
she,
she could give me,

2197
02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:31.870
but then she said something shitty to the bartender and then she likes said

2198
02:10:31.871 --> 02:10:33.410
something Shitty to somebody out.
I was like,

2199
02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:38.150
oh this person's just going through the world trying to shank every living part

2200
02:10:38.151 --> 02:10:42.290
of the world.
She wants to cut and Shank and hurt.
She's shut down.

2201
02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:46.190
But inside of her,
cause I,
that's what I recognize.
I'm like,
shit,

2202
02:10:46.191 --> 02:10:50.600
this is like an sometimes the cruelest sort of person is someone who started off

2203
02:10:50.601 --> 02:10:54.710
trying to be nice and then got shut down for being nice sometimes.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2204
02:10:54.711 --> 02:10:58.490
And I could see all this used to be a very sweet,
nice person.
So I said to her,

2205
02:10:58.560 --> 02:10:59.780
you know what you should start doing,

2206
02:10:59.781 --> 02:11:04.100
you should start doing like service work or missionary work.
And she's like,

2207
02:11:05.060 --> 02:11:09.020
I used to do that.
I used to do that.
I spent years doing that and she was,

2208
02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:12.680
and it was like I could see that part of her,
you know?

2209
02:11:12.681 --> 02:11:16.220
And then I could see she thought that by doing good things in the world,

2210
02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:20.600
she should get some reward for it,
but instead of getting a reward for it,

2211
02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:21.680
she got hurt,

2212
02:11:21.860 --> 02:11:25.040
whatever it was that happened during the course of her serving the universe,

2213
02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:28.520
she got less of what she wanted or didn't get what she expected.

2214
02:11:28.730 --> 02:11:30.500
And because of that,
she's like,
fuck it,

2215
02:11:30.710 --> 02:11:35.330
I'm going to be a bitch from now on because I tried to be good and I got

2216
02:11:35.331 --> 02:11:36.200
punished for it.

2217
02:11:36.660 --> 02:11:41.390
<v 0>Hi,
my wife has a friend that's religious and her and her friend,
um,</v>

2218
02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:45.650
her and this other friend were um,
going to,
uh,

2219
02:11:45.710 --> 02:11:47.740
this woman in her other friend.
We're going to,
uh,

2220
02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:50.400
get like a real estate license and uh,

2221
02:11:50.460 --> 02:11:53.820
she didn't get it and she passed.
She failed her test,

2222
02:11:53.850 --> 02:11:57.180
but her friend passed and she was complaining about it and the,

2223
02:11:57.181 --> 02:12:01.960
what she was complaining about,
she goes,
I don't get it.
I am a good person.
Yes.

2224
02:12:02.190 --> 02:12:04.740
Why didn't you know,
why didn't God hooked me up with this?

2225
02:12:05.010 --> 02:12:06.460
She literally said that.
That's it

2226
02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:07.341
<v 4>right there.
See,</v>

2227
02:12:07.341 --> 02:12:12.260
that is the great fallacy of being a good person is the moment you start doing

2228
02:12:12.261 --> 02:12:13.940
it,
being a good person as a job,

2229
02:12:14.150 --> 02:12:17.660
and you're supposed to get these fortune paychecks from the universe in the form

2230
02:12:17.661 --> 02:12:22.250
of locker,
good things coming to you.
That's the moment you fail.
You fail.

2231
02:12:22.370 --> 02:12:26.030
You really have to resign yourself to the idea that mostly if you're being nice

2232
02:12:26.031 --> 02:12:27.880
to people,
they're going to hurt you.

2233
02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:32.940
<v 0>But how about the hypocrisy of not thinking that God perhaps has a message to</v>

2234
02:12:33.701 --> 02:12:38.701
the millionaire that you have to work to pass your real estate license so that

2235
02:12:40.481 --> 02:12:44.910
you can go make more money from overvalued houses?
Yeah.

2236
02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:49.420
By the way,
right before the subprime mortgage crisis,
it's hilarious.

2237
02:12:49.421 --> 02:12:52.420
Like why doesn't,
why didn't God reward me?

2238
02:12:52.930 --> 02:12:57.610
Like as if you wouldn't think that God is brilliant and God has a plan,

2239
02:12:57.970 --> 02:13:02.290
you wouldn't ordinarily go,
well God must be telling me something.
Which,

2240
02:13:02.710 --> 02:13:03.220
you know,

2241
02:13:03.220 --> 02:13:07.450
people who are legitimately Christian and benefit from that ideology can do.

2242
02:13:07.660 --> 02:13:08.171
They can,

2243
02:13:08.171 --> 02:13:12.340
they can decide that it works for them and they can see that God has a plan and

2244
02:13:12.341 --> 02:13:14.200
any form of adversity that they encounter,

2245
02:13:14.201 --> 02:13:16.960
it's just God's setting them up so that they can figure out what's,

2246
02:13:16.961 --> 02:13:19.960
what's to be done with that.
That's the book of job is all about

2247
02:13:20.690 --> 02:13:24.490
<v 4>no job.
You know the story of Joe.
Yes.
Job.
For those of you don't know,</v>

2248
02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:28.000
summary of the book of job.
Job is like this great servant of God.

2249
02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:32.240
Satan bets with God.
Hey,
I bet I can him,
um,

2250
02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:37.580
<v 3>do horrible things or not be your servant or so it's a really shit bet and God's</v>

2251
02:13:38.041 --> 02:13:42.120
like,
sure,
whatever,
do your best.
And so like job's kids,
I don't know.

2252
02:13:42.121 --> 02:13:45.080
I don't remember from there there he's kids like get eaten or get set on.

2253
02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:49.770
They get skin,
he's job,
gets a skin disease.
He's like,
you know,

2254
02:13:49.771 --> 02:13:54.600
just like basically gets completely fucked up and he's like supposed to be this,

2255
02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:58.350
the ultimate servant of God.
And the idea behind it is like,
no,

2256
02:13:58.740 --> 02:14:00.060
you don't understand.

2257
02:14:00.450 --> 02:14:05.450
This is like the God that made tigers and cyclones and tornadoes with the fuck.

2258
02:14:05.761 --> 02:14:09.060
Do you think you think you can comprehend what's happening?

2259
02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:13.110
The movement of this is the thing that made the big bang happened,
asshole.

2260
02:14:13.230 --> 02:14:16.020
You think it can evaporate your sons if it feels like it.

2261
02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:19.470
You're applying your little ant logic to the thing.
Guess what?

2262
02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:21.570
You were just some little thing crawling on the window.

2263
02:14:21.571 --> 02:14:24.180
I decided to spray you with Windex.
Big Deal.

2264
02:14:24.390 --> 02:14:28.000
You don't understand the true ethics of the world.
So it sounds this

2265
02:14:28.340 --> 02:14:31.770
<v 0>phrasing from ancient Hebrew to Latin to Greek too.</v>

2266
02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:36.640
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah.
Hipster,
the hipster taught.
But the uh,
the whole point,</v>

2267
02:14:36.641 --> 02:14:39.790
I really loved the whole point of the thing because it's like if you drop the

2268
02:14:39.791 --> 02:14:44.791
luggage that contains the idea that from being kind,

2269
02:14:44.981 --> 02:14:48.580
you deserve something back.
It's such a big relief man.

2270
02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:50.710
Cause then when you start doing things for people,

2271
02:14:50.711 --> 02:14:52.780
you're not doing them with some expectation of a roots.

2272
02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:55.360
<v 0>Well isn't that what most of us do with our lives?</v>

2273
02:14:55.361 --> 02:14:58.840
It's sort of a form of prostitution.
We're doing something for money,

2274
02:14:59.290 --> 02:15:03.820
trying to get money and that's why we put in the effort or we're trying to get

2275
02:15:03.821 --> 02:15:04.780
something out of it.

2276
02:15:04.990 --> 02:15:08.050
And that's why we put in the effort when we don't get what we wanted.

2277
02:15:08.260 --> 02:15:12.580
And we'd been worshiping God all this time and I still didn't get my real estate

2278
02:15:12.581 --> 02:15:17.440
license.
You,
you feel like you got gypped.
I shouldn't say gyp.

2279
02:15:17.441 --> 02:15:21.400
Gypsies don't like that.
If you want to use the gun,
if you can say Jude,
you can,

2280
02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:24.880
you can't say jipped.
No,
you shouldn't say gypped.
Like you shouldn't say Jude,

2281
02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:27.760
are you shitting me?
I said,
Jude all the time when I was a kid.

2282
02:15:27.761 --> 02:15:30.760
And then one time my friend Brian,
it was pretty much a hothead,
but uh,

2283
02:15:30.800 --> 02:15:33.060
but he was right and he goes,
he goes,
you know how,

2284
02:15:33.340 --> 02:15:37.780
how racist that is that you said that?
And I was like,
you know what it is.
It is.

2285
02:15:37.781 --> 02:15:41.860
I said,
Julia down is racist.
I go,

2286
02:15:41.861 --> 02:15:45.910
he's gonna try to Jew you down the price.
And then I realized,
I was like,
wow.

2287
02:15:46.150 --> 02:15:48.550
I didn't even think about it because it was just like everybody said it.

2288
02:15:48.700 --> 02:15:51.040
Even Jews said it.
Like my Jewish friends,

2289
02:15:51.220 --> 02:15:55.720
we'll crack the most Jewish jokes the most,
like,
you know,
look,
I'm a Jew,

2290
02:15:55.721 --> 02:15:58.880
all jewelry out of it,
especially our Jewish friends who were all comics.

2291
02:15:58.950 --> 02:16:02.250
I just use the word shift,
feared now shift fear.
It's better.

2292
02:16:02.260 --> 02:16:05.820
And ours is not cheap at all.
What are you talking about?
What you think are,

2293
02:16:05.821 --> 02:16:10.650
he's cheap.
Yes he is.
Why do you say that?
He's always like penny pinching.
No,

2294
02:16:10.660 --> 02:16:14.380
no,
no,
no.
You did wrong.
You're dead wrong.
He's not cheap.

2295
02:16:14.381 --> 02:16:17.890
He's smart with his money.
Ari Smart with his money.

2296
02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:20.490
Ari has a budget and he stays within his budget.
That's not

2297
02:16:20.850 --> 02:16:25.850
<v 3>did an RFI TV red band didn't already give you like a big TV for designing is a</v>

2298
02:16:26.521 --> 02:16:30.100
website.
I remember walking into your house and you had some kind of huge

2299
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:34.840
<v 0>TV or something.
I thought our aid given them to you.
Oh,
I must've been confused.</v>

2300
02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:40.000
Or high.
Yeah,
I must have been high.
But when whatever,

2301
02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:43.960
always on a budget or was on a budget.
He's balling now living in New York City.

2302
02:16:43.961 --> 02:16:47.920
He's bi coastal,
asexual.
He's a great,
no,
he's not anymore.

2303
02:16:48.220 --> 02:16:52.720
He's a grown man.
That's,
that's funny to people.

2304
02:16:53.010 --> 02:16:56.530
Why aren't why except bisexual?
She was like,
fuck you man.

2305
02:16:57.460 --> 02:17:01.090
I'm fucking tired of the homophobia on the Joe Rogan experience.

2306
02:17:03.220 --> 02:17:06.040
We spent the first 30 episodes talking about big Blackhawks fan.

2307
02:17:06.850 --> 02:17:09.430
The homophobia is,
it's just a balancing act.

2308
02:17:09.790 --> 02:17:14.170
We're just still trying to right the wrongs of the early days.
Um,

2309
02:17:14.380 --> 02:17:17.680
if you rewatched you claim lately,
I don't want to watch any of that stuff.

2310
02:17:17.730 --> 02:17:21.520
I move on recently watched it chew that Shit.

2311
02:17:21.521 --> 02:17:25.750
Especially the part where he's just showing us his balls and zero fucks.

2312
02:17:26.190 --> 02:17:30.550
She didn't care that he'll just show you his butt hole.
He doesn't care at all.

2313
02:17:30.750 --> 02:17:34.660
He's free.
He's a free man.
Unless he's at the airport.
Yeah,

2314
02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:39.490
he gives no fucks.
Well,
you know what?
He's living life like a real comedian.

2315
02:17:39.520 --> 02:17:42.040
I mean,
that's what he's doing.
He's out there trying to be a standup.

2316
02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:46.790
Hari Krishna.
Ari Shaffir.
We love you.
Yeah.
So,
uh,

2317
02:17:46.810 --> 02:17:51.810
somebody reported that John McAfee died of from cocaine at a hotel in New York

2318
02:17:53.171 --> 02:17:57.400
City lies.
So just so everybody knows lies.

2319
02:17:57.790 --> 02:18:02.260
He's alive.
Yes.
Yes.
It's a lie.
Have you watched any of that's insane.
Yeah,

2320
02:18:02.261 --> 02:18:06.190
they're funny.
That's insane.
But here's something way more insane.

2321
02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:10.240
Way More insane though.
This is a Fox News anchor.
Okay.

2322
02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:13.490
His name is Neil Cavuto.
You ever seen that guy?
No.
Okay.

2323
02:18:13.630 --> 02:18:18.630
He looks like he looks like your typical American with a bad diet.

2324
02:18:19.570 --> 02:18:23.410
Who Loves God?
Let me look him up real quick,
right Neil?
Anyway,
sure.

2325
02:18:23.411 --> 02:18:24.244
He's a nice guy.

2326
02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:29.520
But one of the things that he said he asked viewers to consider if bombing Syria

2327
02:18:30.100 --> 02:18:34.330
is a harbinger harbinger of the second.
I never say that word.

2328
02:18:34.331 --> 02:18:37.900
I only read it harbinger of the second coming of Christ.

2329
02:18:39.010 --> 02:18:39.843
Dude,

2330
02:18:40.090 --> 02:18:45.090
he asked on TV if you would consider if bombing Syria is a harbinger of the

2331
02:18:47.091 --> 02:18:51.670
second coming of Christ.
Like you have to ask this.
It's a harbinger.

2332
02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:56.770
This is his quote.
The serious stuff is way old.
Kabuto explained.
I mean,

2333
02:18:56.800 --> 02:19:01.450
Old Testament old.
That's how old I'm talking about.
Don't laugh,

2334
02:19:02.920 --> 02:19:07.300
don't laugh.
He says that he's,
if he's preparing us,
don't laugh.
Oh,
I was Gunna,

2335
02:19:07.301 --> 02:19:11.110
you called it though.
You call it you called.
Don't laugh.
Um,

2336
02:19:12.190 --> 02:19:13.780
yeah.
He said,
don't laugh.

2337
02:19:13.781 --> 02:19:18.220
Some biblical scholars say it's all there in black and white.
Sure.
Oh,

2338
02:19:18.221 --> 02:19:21.730
do they really?
They say that.
That's what they say.
Hey,
biblical scholar.

2339
02:19:21.731 --> 02:19:25.710
What do you think about Syria?
It's all there in black and white.
That's why.

2340
02:19:25.830 --> 02:19:30.590
All right.
Surya,
black and white,
Neil covered.
Uh Oh God.

2341
02:19:30.591 --> 02:19:31.311
He's so crazy.

2342
02:19:31.311 --> 02:19:35.210
He invited author Joel Rosenberg to weigh in on the link between the Syrian

2343
02:19:35.211 --> 02:19:39.500
conflict and the Bible passage,
which he said were uncanny and kind of scary.

2344
02:19:39.530 --> 02:19:42.890
What are the passages?
Let's here.

2345
02:19:43.670 --> 02:19:47.330
These are prophecies more than 2,700 years old.
Some of them,

2346
02:19:47.690 --> 02:19:51.140
but they have not actually been fulfilled.
Rosenberg said,
oh,

2347
02:19:51.141 --> 02:19:53.330
well isn't that funny?

2348
02:19:53.331 --> 02:19:56.600
You could just make a prophecy and one day trust me,

2349
02:19:57.120 --> 02:19:59.120
like they haven't been fulfilled.
This could be it.
Yeah.

2350
02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:00.990
<v 3>This can be the one.
Hey,
what about this?</v>

2351
02:20:00.991 --> 02:20:03.330
The Rosenbergs hazards could be the one that can be the one.

2352
02:20:03.390 --> 02:20:07.530
Let me tell you something,
man.
Once we get that temple where it belongs,

2353
02:20:08.520 --> 02:20:10.170
the new temple rise,

2354
02:20:10.340 --> 02:20:14.530
<v 0>which is such goobers,
they're just such dorks and goobers.
Well,</v>

2355
02:20:14.531 --> 02:20:15.830
we're going to be fascinating though.

2356
02:20:16.130 --> 02:20:21.020
If the reason why ancient civilization is based in the Middle East is because

2357
02:20:21.021 --> 02:20:22.340
they've always had the most oil.

2358
02:20:22.580 --> 02:20:26.270
And we've just known about that and forgotten it throughout human history.

2359
02:20:26.330 --> 02:20:29.270
Like maybe they found oil thousands and thousands of years before we thought

2360
02:20:29.271 --> 02:20:32.420
they did.
Do you want to hear the apocalyptic verse,
my friend?
Sure.

2361
02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:37.920
So this is from Isaiah 17 one.
How do you know that's it?
Uh,
it's,

2362
02:20:37.940 --> 02:20:40.010
I looked up Syria apocalypse.

2363
02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:44.670
The burden of Damascus.
Behold,
yeah.

2364
02:20:44.790 --> 02:20:49.080
<v 3>Damascus is taken away from being a city and it shall be a ruinous</v>

2365
02:20:49.400 --> 02:20:54.260
<v 0>heap.
Isaiah 17 one apparently Damascus is Syria.</v>

2366
02:20:54.740 --> 02:20:59.120
There's another one.
Jeremiah 49 says that people will flee,

2367
02:20:59.150 --> 02:21:02.060
but there will still be people in Damascus when the prophecy happens.

2368
02:21:02.090 --> 02:21:05.630
So the bottom line is that we don't know if these two prophecies,

2369
02:21:05.631 --> 02:21:10.040
Isaiah 17 in Jeremiah 49 will happen in our lifetime or soon.

2370
02:21:10.190 --> 02:21:13.640
But they could happen because they haven't happened yet.
Listen to that.

2371
02:21:13.790 --> 02:21:16.760
They could have them because they haven't happened yet.
Well,
that's,

2372
02:21:16.850 --> 02:21:17.683
that makes sense,

2373
02:21:17.860 --> 02:21:20.740
<v 3>man.
That shit gives me the creeps though,
man.
That's creepy.</v>

2374
02:21:20.741 --> 02:21:24.830
Because if you do think about it,
it's like,
okay,
worst case scenario,
uh,

2375
02:21:24.910 --> 02:21:29.020
Obama blasts and Hellfire missiles into Syria and for whatever reason,

2376
02:21:29.021 --> 02:21:32.930
Russia and China decided to retaliate.
Then we have world war three.
It.

2377
02:21:32.940 --> 02:21:36.310
What do they do?
They bomb Hawaii.
What do you think they do?
What?
What do they do?

2378
02:21:36.340 --> 02:21:38.740
Something like that.
Attack.
They attack Israel.

2379
02:21:39.190 --> 02:21:43.270
They just blast Israel with Sarah and gas.
Just fucking,
oh,
you're,

2380
02:21:43.271 --> 02:21:46.360
you know the,
basically the idea is they decide,

2381
02:21:46.361 --> 02:21:48.100
let's just let the configuration happen.

2382
02:21:48.101 --> 02:21:51.280
Let's roll the dice and see what's left and then whatever's left.

2383
02:21:51.310 --> 02:21:54.970
That's the world we're going to be living in.
But that,
so it's,
I mean,

2384
02:21:55.160 --> 02:21:59.480
I'm obviously biblical prophecy.
Who the fuck knows,
but I don't need it.

2385
02:21:59.481 --> 02:22:04.360
God Damn old dusty scrolled as tell that it ain't a good thing.

2386
02:22:04.590 --> 02:22:08.590
<v 0>What's really fucked up about biblical prophecy when it comes to like,
uh,</v>

2387
02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:10.230
the apocalyptic stuff.
Yeah.

2388
02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:13.940
A lot of it takes place in the area where the shit is going down.

2389
02:22:14.390 --> 02:22:19.390
I mean there is kind of fucked up when you think about like Israel and the

2390
02:22:19.850 --> 02:22:21.980
Middle East and all this shit that's in the Bible.
Well,

2391
02:22:21.981 --> 02:22:25.980
Israel is a state wasn't even created to,
was I 1947?
Is that what it is?

2392
02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:30.960
It was Palestine before then,
but it was Israel before that.
Yeah.
The,

2393
02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:31.230
the,

2394
02:22:31.230 --> 02:22:36.230
the earth itself like has like a place where the conflict oriented the tumor,

2395
02:22:38.140 --> 02:22:42.910
<v 3>that's the brain tumor and,
and,
and yeah,
it's nice.
That's where every,</v>

2396
02:22:42.911 --> 02:22:45.550
that's where the knot is tightening every single day.

2397
02:22:45.630 --> 02:22:48.330
<v 0>And ironically,
that's where it all started.
Yeah.</v>

2398
02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:53.340
I mean when they talk about human beings and ironically,
oh,
is it a rock?

2399
02:22:53.930 --> 02:22:57.570
Sorry.
Yeah,
right.
Well I rack is the big one.
Right?

2400
02:22:57.600 --> 02:22:59.460
That's like where Merrill was.

2401
02:22:59.870 --> 02:23:04.250
<v 3>Uh,
yeah man.
And it's to that.
So I don't like,</v>

2402
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:09.550
I don't really understand why Obama wants to bomb those people because it's an

2403
02:23:10.731 --> 02:23:13.160
interesting thing when you consider if you slowed down,

2404
02:23:13.161 --> 02:23:16.490
what happens when you blow someone up with a conventional weapon to like a five

2405
02:23:16.491 --> 02:23:20.420
hour period.
So there are so some bomb that you could drop on.

2406
02:23:20.421 --> 02:23:24.530
People are a weapon that you could disperse that over the course of five hours

2407
02:23:24.531 --> 02:23:29.330
caused your body to gradually separate from itself and incinerate at the same

2408
02:23:29.331 --> 02:23:33.230
time.
That would be an illegal weapon.
Yes.

2409
02:23:33.260 --> 02:23:36.260
But because bombs work instantaneously,

2410
02:23:36.380 --> 02:23:41.380
somehow they are less brutal than the serin gas,

2411
02:23:41.751 --> 02:23:45.950
which is awful.
But what's his name?
Neil degrasse Tyson.

2412
02:23:46.340 --> 02:23:50.330
He tweeted,
just so you guys know,
all bombs or chemical weapons,

2413
02:23:50.331 --> 02:23:52.520
they're all like the instability of chemicals.

2414
02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:55.520
And I think that's a very smart point to make,

2415
02:23:55.880 --> 02:23:59.300
which is that if you damn this one thing is like,
oh,

2416
02:23:59.301 --> 02:24:03.860
this monster is way of killing people versus this other way of killing people,

2417
02:24:03.861 --> 02:24:05.480
which happens instantaneous lease.

2418
02:24:05.481 --> 02:24:09.650
You don't have to slowly watch them char and incinerate and watch their arm

2419
02:24:09.651 --> 02:24:13.520
gradually break and bones shatter into the air.

2420
02:24:14.020 --> 02:24:19.020
<v 0>There's a study from Columbia law school's human rights institute to find the</v>

2421
02:24:19.331 --> 02:24:22.960
number of Pakistani civilians killed by drone strikes.

2422
02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:28.920
So here then what they said is they have been significantly and consistently

2423
02:24:30.191 --> 02:24:33.250
underestimated.
What do you think the number,

2424
02:24:33.251 --> 02:24:36.520
the percentage of civilians killed by drone strikes are?

2425
02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:41.100
<v 3>Fuck,
I have no idea,
man.
I don't take again,
I don't want to know.</v>

2426
02:24:41.250 --> 02:24:42.980
He's like say tannic prices,
right?

2427
02:24:43.340 --> 02:24:46.430
<v 0>Just take a guess.
1200 no,
no,
no.
The percentage.</v>

2428
02:24:46.431 --> 02:24:50.090
What's the percentage of people that are civilians?
Oh,

2429
02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:52.640
98% 98 wow.
Yup.

2430
02:24:53.450 --> 02:24:57.320
The actual innocence that were killed by at of all the drone attacks,

2431
02:24:57.470 --> 02:24:59.510
98% of the people died were innocent.

2432
02:24:59.810 --> 02:25:04.340
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's such,
so that's why it's really a spooky thing when Obama,</v>

2433
02:25:04.530 --> 02:25:08.690
you know,
takes this like stance against these chemical weapons when it's like,

2434
02:25:08.691 --> 02:25:09.520
well,

2435
02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:13.120
<v 0>killing people to listen to this man.
This is,
this is insane.</v>

2436
02:25:13.540 --> 02:25:18.540
Obama has authorized 193 drone strikes in Pakistan,

2437
02:25:18.970 --> 02:25:22.120
four times the amount authorized by George W.
Bush.

2438
02:25:22.450 --> 02:25:23.980
According to research

2439
02:25:24.130 --> 02:25:25.510
<v 4>over the past four years,</v>

2440
02:25:25.511 --> 02:25:30.511
Obama has authorized attacks in Pakistan which have killed more than 800

2441
02:25:30.971 --> 02:25:35.160
innocent civilians and just 22 al Qaeda officers,

2442
02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:39.550
800 800800800 people.

2443
02:25:40.780 --> 02:25:43.530
That is a lot of people.
That's incredible.

2444
02:25:43.570 --> 02:25:46.240
Two sold out shows that a our improv on the road,

2445
02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:50.470
that means 36 civilians per target were killed.

2446
02:25:51.100 --> 02:25:55.630
That's incredible man.
They have a list of all these people on this website.

2447
02:25:55.631 --> 02:25:59.590
Everyone who's been killed by a drone that was a civilian and it's fucking dark

2448
02:25:59.591 --> 02:26:02.230
man,
but doesn't it seem like we're not going to bomb Syria?

2449
02:26:02.231 --> 02:26:05.020
Joe Isn't this new thing that like,
oh,

2450
02:26:05.021 --> 02:26:09.910
after realizing that the public was sick of their idiotic wars and realizing

2451
02:26:09.911 --> 02:26:14.110
that the house is probably going to vote against this war and recognizing that

2452
02:26:14.111 --> 02:26:16.480
no one on the planet wants to the war to happen,
the pope,

2453
02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:20.950
the new bad ass pope asked if the reason we're going to wars to sell weapons.

2454
02:26:21.310 --> 02:26:23.380
He asked that.
So like,
you know,

2455
02:26:23.470 --> 02:26:28.180
I think that the popular public opinion all over the planet is so against this

2456
02:26:28.181 --> 02:26:32.050
in every single way that they realize that this shit isn't working anymore.

2457
02:26:32.051 --> 02:26:36.130
And so they had to have a back door and he went and met with Putin and Putin is

2458
02:26:36.131 --> 02:26:39.610
like,
here's how we're going to get you out of your stupid,
Shitty,
dumb mess.

2459
02:26:40.230 --> 02:26:42.550
You know,
we're going to just take their chemical weapons away,

2460
02:26:42.700 --> 02:26:44.140
will be in charge of the deal.

2461
02:26:44.260 --> 02:26:49.260
You guys don't bomb Syria and we get to keep our strategic stronghold in the

2462
02:26:49.330 --> 02:26:53.410
Middle East that you assholes failed to take away from us with your crap policy.

2463
02:26:53.980 --> 02:26:55.900
Who,
I think that's what happened.

2464
02:26:56.260 --> 02:27:00.910
I think it's also Putin comes off looking reasonable and that's what's really

2465
02:27:00.911 --> 02:27:05.740
weird,
looking reasonable a bunch except for the,
uh,
making homosexuality illegal.

2466
02:27:05.741 --> 02:27:08.410
He's,
yeah.
What is that about?
Where you think that's coming from?

2467
02:27:08.570 --> 02:27:12.640
So bad shit place,
man.
It's coming from someplace wrong.
I don't know where,

2468
02:27:12.641 --> 02:27:16.210
but he's doing it and it's fucking wrong with Putin's just super good.
He's,

2469
02:27:16.350 --> 02:27:20.170
he's gotta be,
if you say that Brian,
no,
you don't know shit.

2470
02:27:20.740 --> 02:27:23.380
You're going to get us in trouble.
Stop it.
Can you get him?
Don't say that.

2471
02:27:23.381 --> 02:27:25.980
Can you get in trouble for saying Putin's Gal?
She came.
Who was,

2472
02:27:25.981 --> 02:27:30.520
want to hear that shit.
I'm sorry.
Bladimir Vladimir.
Yeah.
Listen,

2473
02:27:30.620 --> 02:27:33.520
my name is Joe Rogan.
This is my voice.
I don't think you guys are.

2474
02:27:33.820 --> 02:27:38.740
I just said it could be shut the fuck up.
Hive.
Mr Putin.

2475
02:27:38.741 --> 02:27:41.350
It's Duncan Trussell.
I want you to know,
I don't think you're gay.

2476
02:27:41.351 --> 02:27:44.260
Would love to go fishing with you.
I'd like to go swimming in a lake with you.

2477
02:27:44.261 --> 02:27:46.960
Stop arresting Gaze Mr Food and don't do that anymore.

2478
02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:49.990
It's what's the one thing that's fucking up your big plan?
Well,

2479
02:27:49.991 --> 02:27:54.991
there's a bunch of people who are threatening to out closeted politicians know

2480
02:27:55.420 --> 02:27:58.660
that have supported this,
uh,
this new legislature in Russia.

2481
02:27:58.870 --> 02:28:01.360
I just don't understand how it happens.

2482
02:28:01.510 --> 02:28:06.220
That seems to me it would be a really tough pill to swallow in 2013 and they're

2483
02:28:06.221 --> 02:28:10.390
going backwards and it's brutal and they're beating up gay people and just

2484
02:28:10.510 --> 02:28:13.900
fucked up shit over there,
man.
Fucked up shit.
Meanwhile,

2485
02:28:13.901 --> 02:28:16.440
they're the ones who are like letting you know,

2486
02:28:16.710 --> 02:28:19.150
a whistleblower giving him safe haven.

2487
02:28:19.420 --> 02:28:22.070
They're the ones who like apparently averted this

2488
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:25.460
<v 3>stupid brand new American war.
You know,</v>

2489
02:28:25.461 --> 02:28:29.410
like it sucks.
You know,
I,
it's like you everything.
When I was a kid,

2490
02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:32.450
it was all just so black and white,
you know?

2491
02:28:32.451 --> 02:28:37.451
Now we're the ones who seem unreasonable and irrational and insane and that's

2492
02:28:37.461 --> 02:28:38.720
such a bummer,
man.

2493
02:28:38.721 --> 02:28:42.830
That's such a Shitty fucking bummer and history is going to wonder why we didn't

2494
02:28:42.860 --> 02:28:43.693
do more.

2495
02:28:43.970 --> 02:28:48.890
You know that that's a history is going to look back and wonder why the citizens

2496
02:28:48.891 --> 02:28:51.460
didn't do more to stop this shit.
Even though we,

2497
02:28:51.530 --> 02:28:56.390
we may have done enough to stop this from the public outcry from calling

2498
02:28:56.391 --> 02:28:59.450
constituents,
it might've actually worked,
I don't know.

2499
02:28:59.451 --> 02:29:02.900
I think Obama was about to give a speech today about this nonsense.

2500
02:29:03.810 --> 02:29:05.820
<v 1>Yeah.
The,
the,
even CNN,</v>

2501
02:29:05.821 --> 02:29:10.821
the front of it is like Obama's challenge convincing you on Syria now it's 0% of

2502
02:29:11.761 --> 02:29:12.930
the public thinks we should do it.

2503
02:29:12.931 --> 02:29:16.740
I haven't seen one person argue that we should attack Syria.
Literally,

2504
02:29:16.770 --> 02:29:20.490
my mom even said she didn't want to go to war and she was always backing up all

2505
02:29:20.500 --> 02:29:23.740
the other words.
I think people are just learning.
It's just we've been hoarse,

2506
02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:25.530
fucked for so many years now.

2507
02:29:25.650 --> 02:29:29.580
We've been horse fucks since 2001 I mean that's really hard to believe.

2508
02:29:29.790 --> 02:29:33.030
It's really hard to believe that it's been 12 years of horse fucking the whole

2509
02:29:33.031 --> 02:29:36.600
world's been horse fucked and at this point in time,

2510
02:29:36.601 --> 02:29:41.601
especially with this second term of this supposedly liberal and ordering drone

2511
02:29:42.721 --> 02:29:47.470
strikes like crazy threatening military action for this one.
Ambiguous,

2512
02:29:47.471 --> 02:29:49.770
straight.
I mean,
I don't know who the fuck caused that strike,

2513
02:29:49.771 --> 02:29:53.910
but I know Ron Paul says that it was a false flag.
Is Ron Paul,
right?

2514
02:29:54.270 --> 02:29:55.440
What the fuck do I know?

2515
02:29:55.560 --> 02:29:59.760
But if somebody wanted us to go to Syria for some other reason and they decided

2516
02:29:59.761 --> 02:30:01.200
to orchestrate and attack,

2517
02:30:01.201 --> 02:30:05.370
that would force the United States hand and to going into Syria.
Shit,
dude,

2518
02:30:05.371 --> 02:30:08.040
that's possible.
If you don't pay attention to history,

2519
02:30:08.041 --> 02:30:11.580
you might think it's not possible.
But if you do pay attention to history,
it's,

2520
02:30:11.620 --> 02:30:14.570
it's happened.
It happened with the Gulf of Tonkin,
it,
it,

2521
02:30:14.610 --> 02:30:17.040
and then that was even Shaker.
It was even faker than this.

2522
02:30:17.130 --> 02:30:19.830
<v 3>Well,
look from the Pov of,
uh,
some,</v>

2523
02:30:19.831 --> 02:30:24.831
some are revolutionary fundamentalist Islamic,

2524
02:30:24.930 --> 02:30:29.020
uh,
person who's planning these attacks.
We know that,
uh,

2525
02:30:29.340 --> 02:30:33.360
a lot of people,
uh,
people who are fundamentalist Islamic,

2526
02:30:33.610 --> 02:30:34.950
what we call terrorists,

2527
02:30:35.010 --> 02:30:38.820
they don't have a problem putting dynamite in their body and blowing themselves

2528
02:30:38.821 --> 02:30:39.031
up.

2529
02:30:39.031 --> 02:30:43.980
So it's not beyond the Pale to think that in the scheme of things,

2530
02:30:44.220 --> 02:30:47.490
once they realized that they do a Sarah and attack,

2531
02:30:47.730 --> 02:30:52.730
it could possibly cause the United States to attack and unleash hell on Assad.

2532
02:30:53.220 --> 02:30:55.320
Well,
yeah,
that's a logical decision to make.

2533
02:30:55.500 --> 02:30:59.850
And why would a sod knowing that if he did a chemical attack,

2534
02:30:59.851 --> 02:31:00.990
it could cause the,

2535
02:31:01.040 --> 02:31:06.040
all the gains he's made in his shitty Goddamn a civil war to go away.

2536
02:31:06.480 --> 02:31:10.500
Why would he do that?
Doesn't make any sense.
And he see,
I don't,
he seems,

2537
02:31:10.530 --> 02:31:13.350
I think he's a vicious piece of shit from what I've read.

2538
02:31:13.530 --> 02:31:14.940
But he doesn't seem stupid.

2539
02:31:15.150 --> 02:31:18.830
And apparently he was already kind of winning that war as it were,

2540
02:31:18.850 --> 02:31:20.520
are making great advances,

2541
02:31:20.880 --> 02:31:23.670
<v 4>you know,
so I don't know why suddenly he's like,
yeah,
release the gas,</v>

2542
02:31:23.671 --> 02:31:27.440
the gas that will make it so that we get in at a super power to stop,
bomb,

2543
02:31:27.450 --> 02:31:29.790
start bombing us.
And who was he fighting against?

2544
02:31:29.791 --> 02:31:32.670
Isn't he finding against the Taliban?
Uh,

2545
02:31:32.700 --> 02:31:35.440
well it's a make fighting against al Qaeda.
It's not just al-Qaida,

2546
02:31:35.520 --> 02:31:38.910
it's a mixture.
From what I saw,
there was this,
uh,
I can't remember.
It was on,

2547
02:31:38.970 --> 02:31:42.100
it wasn't on scene and it was on one of these weird news channels.

2548
02:31:42.110 --> 02:31:46.890
It was just a conference with a,
uh,
analysts talking about what Syria,

2549
02:31:47.190 --> 02:31:50.100
what the revolution or the civil wars comprised of.

2550
02:31:50.370 --> 02:31:53.790
And it's not all al Qaeda and it's not all Taliban.
And it's not all,

2551
02:31:53.940 --> 02:31:57.030
it's different.
It's different groups.
Just in the same way,

2552
02:31:57.031 --> 02:32:01.290
if there was a revolution in the United States,
it wouldn't just be one group.

2553
02:32:01.290 --> 02:32:05.310
It wouldn't just be the tea party.
It would be anarchistic.
It would be,

2554
02:32:05.580 --> 02:32:10.080
uh,
you occupy wall streeters.
It would be environmentalist.

2555
02:32:10.081 --> 02:32:14.400
It would be fundamentalist Christians.
That's what a civil war really is,

2556
02:32:14.401 --> 02:32:19.401
is just this shattering of people into groups with one initial main goal,

2557
02:32:20.010 --> 02:32:22.650
which is get Assad out of power and then the next,

2558
02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:27.090
that's where revolution can really suck or a civil work and really suck because

2559
02:32:27.091 --> 02:32:29.910
then the thing collapses on itself and they all start attacking each other.

2560
02:32:30.120 --> 02:32:34.500
Did you see the John Kerry used a fake photo to fuel the Syrian war?

2561
02:32:34.590 --> 02:32:37.170
I heard him as to the photo of the bodies.
Yeah,
I heard about the,

2562
02:32:37.200 --> 02:32:38.130
this was the photo.

2563
02:32:38.590 --> 02:32:43.590
It's a photo from 2003 from the Iraq war of a little boy jumping over these

2564
02:32:43.591 --> 02:32:48.180
lines of bodies and he used that in a speech.
I'll try to beat the war drums.

2565
02:32:48.330 --> 02:32:52.500
How the fuck could he know or how could he not know rather that that's a bad

2566
02:32:52.501 --> 02:32:55.200
photo to use.
Yeah,
no shit,
man.
Of course he knew,
right?

2567
02:32:55.230 --> 02:32:58.460
How about McCain playing fucking video poker?
Yeah.

2568
02:32:58.800 --> 02:33:02.280
When they were talking about bugs,
these are thugs,
man.
They're,

2569
02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:06.540
they're talking about evaporating human beings and the guy so comfortable these

2570
02:33:06.541 --> 02:33:07.980
fucking playing video poker.

2571
02:33:08.010 --> 02:33:11.310
The only thing that he thinks we should go doesn't mean he was.
Yeah,

2572
02:33:11.311 --> 02:33:15.360
he loves war McCain's a big,
he's a big fan of war.
He think he supporting it,

2573
02:33:15.361 --> 02:33:19.230
right?
He supported like seven wars.
Yeah.
Oh hell yeah.
Here he comes.

2574
02:33:21.060 --> 02:33:25.590
This is the live.
Yeah,
look at him.
He has to walk down a red carpet.
How dramatic

2575
02:33:26.190 --> 02:33:29.940
<v 8>my fellow Americans.
Hello President.
I don't want to talk to you about Syria.</v>

2576
02:33:30.300 --> 02:33:33.330
Oh boy.
Why it matters and where we go from here.

2577
02:33:34.800 --> 02:33:36.210
Over the past two years,

2578
02:33:36.211 --> 02:33:40.350
what began as a series of peaceful protests against the repressive regime of

2579
02:33:40.351 --> 02:33:43.650
Bashar al Assad has turned into a brutal civil war.

2580
02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:49.380
Over a hundred thousand people have been killed.
Millions have fled the country,

2581
02:33:50.400 --> 02:33:53.970
and that time America's worked with allies to provide humanitarian support,

2582
02:33:54.510 --> 02:33:58.470
to help the moderate opposition and to shape a political settlement.

2583
02:33:59.610 --> 02:34:04.610
But I have resisted calls for military action because we cannot resolve someone

2584
02:34:04.801 --> 02:34:06.870
else's civil war through force,

2585
02:34:07.650 --> 02:34:10.860
particularly after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan.

2586
02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:17.720
The situation profoundly changed though on August 21st when Assad's government

2587
02:34:18.371 --> 02:34:22.930
gassed to death over a thousand people,
including hundreds of children.

2588
02:34:24.370 --> 02:34:28.810
The images from this massacre are sickening.
Men,

2589
02:34:28.811 --> 02:34:32.560
women,
children,
lying and rose killed by poison gas.

2590
02:34:33.550 --> 02:34:36.340
Others foaming at the mouth,
gasping for breath,

2591
02:34:37.780 --> 02:34:42.010
father clutching his bed show,
imploring them to get up in the wall.

2592
02:34:42.010 --> 02:34:43.780
It's better to set them on fire

2593
02:34:46.330 --> 02:34:49.240
and gruesome detail.
The ticket,
my mixture of chemicals.

2594
02:34:49.990 --> 02:34:54.990
How crazy giving these images of father clutching his children like what do you

2595
02:34:56.111 --> 02:34:57.970
do?
Are you,
what do you,
are you an actor?

2596
02:34:58.150 --> 02:35:02.710
Like what's with the dramatic narrative of father clutching his children?

2597
02:35:03.010 --> 02:35:05.410
Babies could be your baby.

2598
02:35:05.411 --> 02:35:09.670
American Gis work on the many thousands killed by deadly gas in the trenches of

2599
02:35:09.671 --> 02:35:12.440
Europe.
In World War II,

2600
02:35:12.910 --> 02:35:16.920
the Nazis used gassed and flicked the horror of the Holocaust.
We must use fire,

2601
02:35:16.930 --> 02:35:21.280
not gas.
Fire use weapons can kill dude.
What the fuck?

2602
02:35:21.530 --> 02:35:23.400
They killed him.
Mass chill.

2603
02:35:23.650 --> 02:35:27.880
No distinction between soldier and infants like drones,
drones.

2604
02:35:27.881 --> 02:35:32.200
What about Hiroshima?
97 what about the 98% civilian rate?

2605
02:35:32.260 --> 02:35:35.980
Your drones have killed international agreement prohibiting the use of chemical

2606
02:35:35.981 --> 02:35:39.140
weapons.
We set him on fire.
It's the moral thing on governments.

2607
02:35:40.360 --> 02:35:43.750
Is there any international agreement that we shouldn't use drones because I

2608
02:35:43.751 --> 02:35:45.330
would think that that would be a bad thing to you.

2609
02:35:45.331 --> 02:35:48.640
It's to these basic rules were violated.
Oh Man.

2610
02:35:48.641 --> 02:35:51.250
Pong with our sense of common humanity of murder.

2611
02:35:52.090 --> 02:35:55.480
No one disputes that chemical weapons were used in Syria.

2612
02:35:56.770 --> 02:36:00.100
The world saw thousands of videos,
cell phone pictures,

2613
02:36:00.280 --> 02:36:04.690
and social media accounts from the attack and humanitarian organizations told

2614
02:36:04.691 --> 02:36:08.740
stories of hospitals packed with people who had symptoms of poison gas.

2615
02:36:10.810 --> 02:36:11.560
Moreover,

2616
02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:16.560
we know the Assad regime was responsible in the days leading up to August 21st

2617
02:36:17.531 --> 02:36:22.090
we know that Assad's chemical weapons personnel prepared for an attack near an

2618
02:36:22.091 --> 02:36:24.250
area where they mix serin gas.

2619
02:36:24.550 --> 02:36:27.970
Could you imagine they distributed gas mess to their trial.
Paranoid.

2620
02:36:27.971 --> 02:36:31.060
This dude gets it and they fired rockets from a regime concept area.

2621
02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:34.480
Fucking all the kids,
he's killed tap dance on his head.
All the kids.

2622
02:36:35.470 --> 02:36:36.730
That's just one part of it.

2623
02:36:37.090 --> 02:36:42.090
But just imagine all the conflict that he's engaged in mortal death con all over

2624
02:36:44.501 --> 02:36:47.620
the globe.
It's really gross,
man.

2625
02:36:47.621 --> 02:36:52.400
If you have to like work on your speech to tell people to go to war and kill it,

2626
02:36:53.710 --> 02:36:56.020
you don't want to hear what he says.
I don't hear it.
This shit,
but he says,

2627
02:36:56.050 --> 02:36:57.850
do you want to keep going on?
I just want to know if,

2628
02:36:57.851 --> 02:37:00.610
what if we're going to start bombing,
which start bombing.

2629
02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:03.240
He's going to start doing something.
I think he might say,
we're going to come.

2630
02:37:03.430 --> 02:37:06.790
I don't know.
Maybe listen to what he's saying.
There's commit atrocities.

2631
02:37:07.780 --> 02:37:11.950
They depend upon the world to look the other way and until those horrifying

2632
02:37:11.951 --> 02:37:16.790
pictures fade from memory,
what about us,
man,
but these things happened.
We burn,

2633
02:37:16.791 --> 02:37:18.500
we didn't fax cannot be denied.

2634
02:37:20.120 --> 02:37:24.170
The question now is what the United States of America and the international

2635
02:37:24.171 --> 02:37:28.280
community is prepared to do about it.
What do you mean France and Saudi Arabia?

2636
02:37:28.281 --> 02:37:31.190
What happened to those people?
To those children?

2637
02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:34.010
There's not only a violation of international law,

2638
02:37:35.300 --> 02:37:37.240
it's also a danger to our security.
Well,

2639
02:37:37.241 --> 02:37:39.410
it's cool that the bombs he's gonna drop aren't going to kill them.

2640
02:37:39.420 --> 02:37:43.190
Explain why they don't kill any kids.
Two magnets coming together.

2641
02:37:43.580 --> 02:37:47.130
They repel the Pumpkin made that actually repels innocence.

2642
02:37:47.131 --> 02:37:49.910
It's baby is the ban against these weapons roads.

2643
02:37:50.420 --> 02:37:54.950
Other tyrants will have no reason to think twice about acquiring poison gas and

2644
02:37:54.951 --> 02:37:59.480
using them cheese over time.
Your troops would again face the prospect.

2645
02:37:59.510 --> 02:38:01.160
Honestly,
if we don't attack Syria,

2646
02:38:01.161 --> 02:38:05.130
I'm going to get some poison gas organizations.
It's obtaining

2647
02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:13.010
fucking liberal Plessy spills beyond,
I knew poison gas pistol.

2648
02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:16.730
That is how someone who was a tea party,
Manchurian candidate would react.

2649
02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:19.790
They would be like,
you know,
Obama wants to be such a fucking pussy.

2650
02:38:19.970 --> 02:38:23.030
I had to teach this country lesson on my own because none of those terrorists

2651
02:38:23.031 --> 02:38:26.300
have the balls to fucking go after Americans to keep America strong.

2652
02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:29.570
I went after America and keep America strong.

2653
02:38:30.940 --> 02:38:33.380
<v 0>Dude,
I can't listen to it man pitch.</v>

2654
02:38:34.150 --> 02:38:37.870
I'm sure that is going to take a long ass time and then it's going to freak

2655
02:38:37.871 --> 02:38:41.270
everybody out and it's going to be the subject of discussion tomorrow.
Um,

2656
02:38:41.290 --> 02:38:46.290
I think it's very unfortunate that we live in this world and to listen to that,

2657
02:38:46.660 --> 02:38:47.070
to,
to,

2658
02:38:47.070 --> 02:38:52.070
to think that he could be so free in talking about this sort of moralization is

2659
02:38:53.971 --> 02:38:58.660
in a word of warfare when we've killed so many fucking people.

2660
02:38:59.020 --> 02:39:00.820
It's just really hard to believe.

2661
02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:05.230
And those numbers that we read off about deaths,
those are just drones.

2662
02:39:05.470 --> 02:39:09.160
That's just drone deaths.
The 98% is just drone desks.

2663
02:39:09.161 --> 02:39:12.340
It doesn't even factor in how many innocent people were killed in the wars in

2664
02:39:12.341 --> 02:39:13.660
Afghanistan and Iraq.

2665
02:39:13.750 --> 02:39:15.130
<v 8>But yeah,
and,
and again,
yeah,</v>

2666
02:39:15.131 --> 02:39:18.250
it is the hypocrisy that it's okay to kill people with fire.

2667
02:39:18.251 --> 02:39:19.960
It's not okay to kill people with gas.

2668
02:39:20.140 --> 02:39:25.090
And this being s coming out of the mouth of man who regularly kills people with

2669
02:39:25.091 --> 02:39:25.650
fire.

2670
02:39:25.650 --> 02:39:27.690
<v 0>Have you seen the video of the guys,</v>

2671
02:39:27.691 --> 02:39:31.270
the rebels in the street and get hit by a missile now pull that shit up,
Brian.

2672
02:39:31.730 --> 02:39:36.600
They start screaming a lot of walk,
blah,
blah.
Walk Fire Gas,

2673
02:39:36.660 --> 02:39:41.460
which is search for madness.
Um,
how about Syrian rebels?
Hit with a bomb.
Maybe.

2674
02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:43.170
Let's see.
Syrian rebels

2675
02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:46.360
<v 9>with bom.</v>

2676
02:39:47.330 --> 02:39:50.840
<v 0>Let me find out.
It's fucking madness.
It's a video.</v>

2677
02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:54.500
Let's see.
Yeah,
Syrian rebels.

2678
02:39:55.740 --> 02:39:56.573
<v 9>MMM</v>

2679
02:39:57.210 --> 02:39:59.850
<v 0>HM.
People are all listening to this speech right now,
man.</v>

2680
02:39:59.851 --> 02:40:04.020
We should just be with Syrian rebels.
Almost hit by bomb.
Let them listen,
man.

2681
02:40:04.021 --> 02:40:08.250
This,
uh,
this is being recorded.
It'll be gone forever.
No,
that's not it.

2682
02:40:09.060 --> 02:40:11.070
There's one is one recent,

2683
02:40:11.071 --> 02:40:14.100
one of these guys in the street and there's bomb.

2684
02:40:14.170 --> 02:40:16.690
<v 8>That's not that.
Our troops are coming home from Afghanistan,</v>

2685
02:40:17.350 --> 02:40:20.320
Afghanistan under the Americans want all of us in Washington,

2686
02:40:20.980 --> 02:40:25.390
especially me to concentrate on the task of building our nation here at home.

2687
02:40:25.420 --> 02:40:29.320
But I have to kill people back to work.
Educating our kids.

2688
02:40:30.560 --> 02:40:32.840
<v 2>Kids.
Oh God.
Demands blood.</v>

2689
02:40:34.770 --> 02:40:37.880
Molik demands sacrifice.
I don't feed the owl God.

2690
02:40:37.881 --> 02:40:41.720
He comes to me and my dreams and if I don't participate in the sacrifice,

2691
02:40:41.721 --> 02:40:46.190
I won't get the mansion.
They have reserved a mansion for me on a hundred acres

2692
02:40:47.810 --> 02:40:52.460
constantly.
I've,
okay.
Yeah.
This is the one thrown of diamonds.
The throne.

2693
02:40:52.461 --> 02:40:55.430
One of diamonds.
Wait for me at the end of the black tunnel.
I must feed the owl.

2694
02:40:55.431 --> 02:40:56.264
God.

2695
02:40:59.860 --> 02:41:04.610
<v 9>Yeah.
What the fuck man?
Really?
Is that what we've come?</v>

2696
02:41:04.890 --> 02:41:06.780
<v 2>Yeah.
That is it,
man.</v>

2697
02:41:08.770 --> 02:41:10.330
<v 9>Now what now?
Hmm?</v>

2698
02:41:10.660 --> 02:41:13.580
<v 2>The beep.
The Lord desires blood.
If you've,</v>

2699
02:41:14.020 --> 02:41:15.790
he's so beautiful as words.

2700
02:41:16.940 --> 02:41:20.870
<v 9>How do you spell,
I'll walk Bob.
Uh,
let me look at my tattoo.</v>

2701
02:41:25.660 --> 02:41:28.300
<v 2>90% of your butthole joke.
Rabo</v>

2702
02:41:32.070 --> 02:41:36.720
great ground.
I can't find this fucking thing.
These guys,
Yo,

2703
02:41:36.820 --> 02:41:41.370
<v 8>members of Congress have said there's no point in simply doing a pinprick strike</v>

2704
02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:42.380
pinprick.
Yeah.

2705
02:41:42.490 --> 02:41:45.550
<v 2>Oh nope.
I never end up in one of his pinprick strikes</v>

2706
02:41:46.380 --> 02:41:49.350
<v 8>the United States military doesn't do pinpricks.</v>

2707
02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:53.230
We're just going to go down there and pinch people.
Limited stroke people's ears,

2708
02:41:53.231 --> 02:41:57.330
Saad,
even no other nation can deliver.
Yeah.
No,

2709
02:41:57.331 --> 02:42:01.360
other than he's talking about another dictator with force and we learned from a

2710
02:42:01.370 --> 02:42:05.100
rock.
The doing so makes us responsible for all that comes next though.

2711
02:42:05.610 --> 02:42:10.610
But if targeted strike can make Assad or any other dictator think twice before

2712
02:42:11.100 --> 02:42:12.020
using chemical weapons,

2713
02:42:12.120 --> 02:42:14.400
dictators are thinking about using chemical weapons right now.

2714
02:42:14.910 --> 02:42:17.670
Other questions involve the dangerous or retaliation.

2715
02:42:19.170 --> 02:42:20.550
We don't dismiss any threats,

2716
02:42:21.060 --> 02:42:24.360
but the Assad regime does not have the ability to seriously threatened our

2717
02:42:24.361 --> 02:42:26.370
military.
And the other,

2718
02:42:26.550 --> 02:42:30.900
any other retaliation they might seek is in line with threats that we face every

2719
02:42:30.900 --> 02:42:31.733
day.

2720
02:42:32.010 --> 02:42:35.670
So we're basically saying they're wheeler Assad nor his allies have any interest

2721
02:42:35.671 --> 02:42:39.570
in escalation that would lead to his demise and our ally.

2722
02:42:39.570 --> 02:42:42.690
Israel can defend itself with overwhelming force.

2723
02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:46.830
We just want to kick those guys unconscious kind of face the United States of

2724
02:42:46.830 --> 02:42:50.890
America.
Yeah.
What is,
what the fuck is that?
And asked

2725
02:42:52.970 --> 02:42:57.970
if we get involved at all in a place that's so complicated where there's one

2726
02:42:58.291 --> 02:43:03.060
person wrote to me,
those who come after Assad may be enemies of human rights.

2727
02:43:03.090 --> 02:43:04.290
You can write to Obama.

2728
02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:09.810
It's true that some of us are extremists.
He'll listen,
he'll change it.

2729
02:43:09.811 --> 02:43:13.750
I'll cut up,
will only draw strength in a more chaotic Syria.

2730
02:43:14.530 --> 02:43:18.700
If people there see the world doing nothing to prevent innocent civilians from

2731
02:43:18.701 --> 02:43:21.420
being gassed to death,
we burned them.
We don't gas.

2732
02:43:21.421 --> 02:43:24.940
The majority of the Syrian people and the Syrian opposition we work with,

2733
02:43:25.690 --> 02:43:29.020
just want to live in peace
and freedom.

2734
02:43:30.220 --> 02:43:32.290
And the day after any military action,

2735
02:43:32.740 --> 02:43:37.300
we would redouble our efforts to achieve a political solution that strengthens

2736
02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:40.640
those who reject the forces of tyranny and extremism.

2737
02:43:40.710 --> 02:43:44.100
<v 2>Joe Biden beat me a poker.
He used to run Raytheon.
They sell how it,</v>

2738
02:43:44.101 --> 02:43:48.960
how far muscles.
I mean,
listen to what he just said,

2739
02:43:49.140 --> 02:43:52.230
like what we're trying to stomp out is exactly what we're doing.
I mean,
the,
the,

2740
02:43:52.231 --> 02:43:54.240
the massive amount of hypocrisy.

2741
02:43:54.430 --> 02:43:57.000
<v 0>We should not be the world's policeman.
Okay.</v>

2742
02:43:57.250 --> 02:43:58.600
<v 2>We should be the world's dragon</v>

2743
02:43:58.970 --> 02:44:02.720
<v 8>and I have a deeply held preference for peaceful solution,</v>

2744
02:44:02.840 --> 02:44:07.310
<v 2>right?
Pull up this video.
Syrian soldiers,
my administrative hit Syrian rebels</v>

2745
02:44:10.540 --> 02:44:11.740
<v 0>by street crossing.</v>

2746
02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:14.593
<v 5>Wow.</v>

2747
02:44:17.220 --> 02:44:21.690
<v 0>Oh,
wait a minute.
That's not the one
I'm trying to find the right one.
Oh,</v>

2748
02:44:21.691 --> 02:44:26.520
here it is.
Oh Damn.
And it doesn't have a,
it has a crazy Arab name to it.

2749
02:44:27.940 --> 02:44:31.780
Go back to this cosmopolitan poke.
The Russian ghost is the video,

2750
02:44:31.800 --> 02:44:36.800
your willingness to join if you could find it in pushing aside to give up his

2751
02:44:36.961 --> 02:44:38.280
chemical.
Wow.
Look at this video.

2752
02:44:39.270 --> 02:44:42.540
The Assad regime has now admitted these guys are a weapons shooting in the

2753
02:44:42.541 --> 02:44:45.410
street and they get jacked by a mess.

2754
02:44:45.411 --> 02:44:48.100
All this is what they're dealing with.

2755
02:44:48.110 --> 02:44:52.290
You got these guys who have guns and like Duh,
Duh Duh Duh Duh.

2756
02:44:52.320 --> 02:44:54.060
They pull up in a pickup truck.
Wow.

2757
02:44:54.120 --> 02:44:56.850
And then like we have an even bigger gun in your pickup truck.

2758
02:44:58.470 --> 02:45:02.220
They're going to kick some ass and uh hmm.

2759
02:45:02.430 --> 02:45:06.900
Watch how the shit hits the fan here,
man.
Siding,
siding day,

2760
02:45:06.901 --> 02:45:11.820
everyone's about to half.
These are,
uh,
who's side are we on here?

2761
02:45:11.940 --> 02:45:16.470
I guess we're on the side of the guys who are avowed to get jacked.
I,

2762
02:45:16.500 --> 02:45:19.990
who knows
the shocks.

2763
02:45:21.150 --> 02:45:23.190
So they back,
the guy backs up his truck

2764
02:45:25.350 --> 02:45:29.280
and they don't even have a chance to respond.
What?
Wash?
Look at this.

2765
02:45:29.460 --> 02:45:34.460
They're trying to move Christ uhmm and the guy's just screaming.

2766
02:45:34.830 --> 02:45:39.790
Allah Akbar Allahu Akbar.
Washout again.
Backed that up again.
Uh,

2767
02:45:39.830 --> 02:45:44.610
you,
you're actually controlling it.
Oh,
sorry.
Rice 10.
I do that.

2768
02:45:46.620 --> 02:45:49.800
I don't want to go to another fucking war man.
One more time.

2769
02:45:49.830 --> 02:45:51.810
We did a good job of filling the screen there,
buddy.
Yeah,

2770
02:45:51.811 --> 02:45:55.110
that's actually really good.
All right.
Watch this one more time.
Look,

2771
02:45:55.111 --> 02:45:59.160
they sort of realize it's happening.
Like look at them,
their body language like,

2772
02:45:59.161 --> 02:46:03.660
like they're like,
oh shit.
Oh Shit.
Watch that.
Sarah.
You got the running.
Boom.

2773
02:46:04.600 --> 02:46:07.840
<v 2>Are you fucking kidding me man?
That's an ethical way to blow people up.</v>

2774
02:46:07.900 --> 02:46:11.090
It's way better than chemical.
That was a beautiful thing.
Those guys are lucky.

2775
02:46:11.210 --> 02:46:13.490
That was like being killed by an American Eagle.

2776
02:46:13.520 --> 02:46:17.540
That's like getting killed by gourmet chef.
So precision

2777
02:46:19.100 --> 02:46:21.440
the United States doesn't do pinpoint.

2778
02:46:23.060 --> 02:46:28.010
I have miss seven.
Let's hear.
He's about to wrap it up.

2779
02:46:28.220 --> 02:46:31.310
<v 8>Yeah.
Knowing more than 40 hours a week,
national agreements,</v>

2780
02:46:32.210 --> 02:46:33.650
it has meant enforcing them.

2781
02:46:35.530 --> 02:46:37.630
<v 2>The burdens of leadership are often heavy.</v>

2782
02:46:37.750 --> 02:46:41.320
I can't get it up unless I'm Caroline Lee's because we have born them.

2783
02:46:42.760 --> 02:46:43.290
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2784
02:46:43.290 --> 02:46:44.850
<v 8>And so to my friends on the right,</v>

2785
02:46:44.940 --> 02:46:49.470
I asked you to reconcile your commitment to America's military might with a

2786
02:46:49.471 --> 02:46:52.370
failure to act when a cause is so plainly just,

2787
02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:56.570
<v 2>okay,
let's stop.
So he's probably though is he's,
is he the worst president?</v>

2788
02:46:56.571 --> 02:46:59.720
We've ever had.
He's the most disappointing for sure,

2789
02:47:00.100 --> 02:47:02.060
because Bush was scary from the jump,

2790
02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:05.270
and he was scary when he was going to war and scary when he was misspelling

2791
02:47:05.271 --> 02:47:09.620
words.
He was always scary,
but Obama was promising and now he's,

2792
02:47:09.650 --> 02:47:14.480
he's terrible.
That was awful.
That was awful.
And it was so corny.

2793
02:47:14.481 --> 02:47:17.600
It was so,
it was like watching that show.

2794
02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:21.140
What was that old a show that used to be on Jag?

2795
02:47:21.380 --> 02:47:26.030
Remember Jag is a military show on like NBC or CBS,

2796
02:47:26.031 --> 02:47:28.910
CBS,
CBS.
It was like,
you know,

2797
02:47:29.060 --> 02:47:33.800
it was fucking real clear.
The good guys,
bad guys,
good guys.

2798
02:47:33.801 --> 02:47:37.940
Always one.
Everything was,
it was a episode of Walker,
Texas Ranger.

2799
02:47:38.210 --> 02:47:41.310
That's what that was.
And he would just gave us,
I love,

2800
02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:45.020
what I really love is they try to give the illusion that there's such thing as a

2801
02:47:45.021 --> 02:47:47.060
safe or that's what's really funny.
He's like,

2802
02:47:47.061 --> 02:47:50.120
I'm just gonna stick this stake in the Hornet's nest.

2803
02:47:50.150 --> 02:47:53.000
The Hornets can't fly over here.
You're going to be fine.

2804
02:47:53.030 --> 02:47:57.350
There'll be no retaliation.
They can't even retaliate and it's no need to worry.

2805
02:47:57.351 --> 02:48:02.060
And it's the same kind of retaliation.
That's Chad,
but how crazy is that?

2806
02:48:02.090 --> 02:48:02.471
How would the,

2807
02:48:02.471 --> 02:48:05.120
the idea that you could just retaliate and you could do that and not,

2808
02:48:05.150 --> 02:48:06.610
not face retaliation.

2809
02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:11.480
What if we attack Syria and Russia decides to put missiles,
shields up?

2810
02:48:11.960 --> 02:48:15.260
Now what does out now we have Obama leading us in a fucking world war three

2811
02:48:15.261 --> 02:48:20.150
against that crocodile Putin.
That's scary.
That's scary to think about,

2812
02:48:20.151 --> 02:48:21.770
man.
I don't know,
man.
I just,

2813
02:48:21.771 --> 02:48:26.771
I'm so disappointed in the whole way this is laid out or the whole way this is

2814
02:48:27.560 --> 02:48:29.690
taking place.
Don't do that prior.
We're going to get flagged.

2815
02:48:30.380 --> 02:48:33.650
Flagged for changing his color.
Yeah,
we did flag terrorist activities,

2816
02:48:33.930 --> 02:48:37.340
not flagged doorway.
We're not doing anything wrong.

2817
02:48:37.341 --> 02:48:40.280
God Damn and I pay my taxes and I doing something wrong.

2818
02:48:40.281 --> 02:48:41.750
If you protest against war,

2819
02:48:41.751 --> 02:48:45.620
I can't believe you support a man who would use chemicals to kill children.

2820
02:48:46.730 --> 02:48:50.450
Let's smoke them out in that funny you support the other guy.

2821
02:48:50.540 --> 02:48:53.000
If you don't think that you should fire missiles,
oh,

2822
02:48:53.001 --> 02:48:56.900
now he's leaving the same way came in.
Oh my God.
I some dramatic that.

2823
02:48:56.901 --> 02:49:00.620
Just that alone,
all of this react trickle shit was orchestrated.
Folks,

2824
02:49:00.830 --> 02:49:03.500
I guarantee you there are some people that are involved in this.

2825
02:49:03.501 --> 02:49:07.200
There's some producers,
there's some,
there's an artistic director they want.

2826
02:49:07.201 --> 02:49:07.980
That was a,
that was a

2827
02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:12.180
<v 1>well planned out scene.
He walks up,
he walks back.</v>

2828
02:49:12.330 --> 02:49:15.480
The fact that they do it in this ancient stupid house where he supposedly lives.

2829
02:49:15.750 --> 02:49:19.490
Meanwhile,
you know,
he's in some fucking seven mile thick bunker down,
you know,

2830
02:49:19.820 --> 02:49:20.850
deep into the ground,

2831
02:49:20.851 --> 02:49:24.450
the bowels of the Earth where Dick Cheney was hiding all throughout the Iraq
war.

2832
02:49:25.140 --> 02:49:29.130
There's just a metal slide.
He jumps in the shoot,
like a laundry chute,

2833
02:49:30.630 --> 02:49:33.030
jumps in and slides through the lens and the towels

2834
02:49:33.400 --> 02:49:37.830
<v 4>and just go some cell phone off and surrounded by lizards who are like excellent</v>

2835
02:49:37.831 --> 02:49:39.810
work.
Yeah,
it's bad.
It's Batman's layer.

2836
02:49:39.920 --> 02:49:43.600
It's about got Batman's layer and he says,
I have,

2837
02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:46.390
you know,
I guess we got wrap this up,
but

2838
02:49:46.470 --> 02:49:50.400
<v 1>in closing,
I have this conflicted,</v>

2839
02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:54.420
this conflicted view of life.
I have this massive hope for people.

2840
02:49:54.421 --> 02:49:57.210
I see all this change in people.
I know.

2841
02:49:57.211 --> 02:50:02.211
I see people growing and progressing and I see people communicating with each

2842
02:50:02.941 --> 02:50:06.930
other online and exchanging information in a way that's never existed before and

2843
02:50:06.931 --> 02:50:09.060
I'm so encouraged by it and I'm so hopeful about it.

2844
02:50:09.390 --> 02:50:12.930
I see people being overly sensitive online,

2845
02:50:13.110 --> 02:50:16.050
which I think is a sign of the right kind of thinking.

2846
02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:19.710
I think the right kind of thinking is is is there's a balance issue going on and

2847
02:50:19.711 --> 02:50:20.670
the over sensitivity,

2848
02:50:20.671 --> 02:50:24.060
whether it's in feminism or whether it's a progressive thinking,

2849
02:50:24.061 --> 02:50:29.061
I think it's in in balance that people who didn't feel like they were

2850
02:50:29.671 --> 02:50:33.000
represented now feel aggressive with their representation,

2851
02:50:33.150 --> 02:50:35.460
aggressive about their ideas and putting them forward.

2852
02:50:35.610 --> 02:50:40.610
And I think this is just some signaling of some new age of expression and that

2853
02:50:41.911 --> 02:50:42.161
we're,

2854
02:50:42.161 --> 02:50:47.161
we're learning about ourselves and life in a way that we never were even capable

2855
02:50:48.331 --> 02:50:50.820
of understanding before and it's so,

2856
02:50:50.950 --> 02:50:53.580
it's so incredible to be alive in this time,

2857
02:50:53.850 --> 02:50:58.590
but yet the same old stupid shit is going on the same power,

2858
02:50:58.591 --> 02:51:01.350
grab the same resource monopolization,

2859
02:51:01.351 --> 02:51:04.200
the same justification of murder,

2860
02:51:04.380 --> 02:51:09.380
the same rationalization of killing innocence one way as opposed to another.

2861
02:51:10.560 --> 02:51:14.490
The moral high ground that this one murderer takes over other murderers.

2862
02:51:15.120 --> 02:51:19.320
It's madness and that,
that it's shocking to me.

2863
02:51:19.390 --> 02:51:22.030
<v 4>That's so funny you say that,
man,
because it really is funny.</v>

2864
02:51:22.031 --> 02:51:26.230
It's like a serial killer judging another serial killer because Obama has
killed.

2865
02:51:26.440 --> 02:51:29.490
How many people is that?
Let's stop worrying about it.

2866
02:51:29.500 --> 02:51:31.780
Where are you gonna do this weekend doing comedy?
I,
I'm going to be,

2867
02:51:31.930 --> 02:51:34.900
I'm going to be at the comedy store this Thursday.

2868
02:51:35.630 --> 02:51:38.850
<v 1>Dunkin's give them some love.
Brian,

2869
02:51:39.690 --> 02:51:42.990

2870
02:51:42.991 --> 02:51:46.560
And then September 27th that you can just go to [inaudible] dot com or just go

2871
02:51:46.561 --> 02:51:49.350

2872
02:51:49.351 --> 02:51:51.340
And then Friday me,
Tony Thompson and,

2873
02:51:51.440 --> 02:51:55.080
and Pitch Christina [inaudible] Jetski also Joe,
uh,
uh,

2874
02:51:55.110 --> 02:51:57.180
La Pod fest is the first week of October.

2875
02:51:57.181 --> 02:51:59.700
I don't know if you're going to be doing or not.
No,
not doing it,
but yeah,

2876
02:51:59.940 --> 02:52:00.990
thanks to [inaudible] Dot Com

2877
02:52:01.540 --> 02:52:06.100
<v 1>25th,
uh,
I'm in Manchester at a the house.
Not that I have anything</v>

2878
02:52:06.100 --> 02:52:07.390
<v 0>wrong with pod fest,
but I can't,</v>

2879
02:52:07.450 --> 02:52:10.350
I got too much shit to do and I'm going to see honey honey that night.
Oh honey,

2880
02:52:10.380 --> 02:52:15.100
honey is in town.
You guys should come if you want your pod.
Festing uh,

2881
02:52:15.101 --> 02:52:19.660
October 1st.
Um,
Manchester,
uh,
I'm doing the dance house.

2882
02:52:19.661 --> 02:52:22.780
I think the first show might be sold out or are real close.
Well,

2883
02:52:22.781 --> 02:52:24.160
we're going to try to add a second show,

2884
02:52:24.280 --> 02:52:25.660
although they don't like to do that in England.

2885
02:52:25.661 --> 02:52:28.570
They like to do one show and then go home.
So I don't know how that works.

2886
02:52:28.571 --> 02:52:30.760
But Manchester,
England,
um,

2887
02:52:30.790 --> 02:52:34.330
October 25th and it's an eight o'clock show.

2888
02:52:34.331 --> 02:52:39.300
So I'll see about doing another one if at all possible.
Um,
and uh,

2889
02:52:39.310 --> 02:52:43.270
I also added a bunch of dates.
I had a good time and Breyer this weekend,

2890
02:52:43.330 --> 02:52:46.750
but I was a little rusty on Saturday night.
My second show,
especially,

2891
02:52:47.260 --> 02:52:52.070
I was burnt out from walking around Disneyland and,
uh,
I think I,

2892
02:52:52.130 --> 02:52:55.970
I had kind of a sloppy show in the second set and I got bummed out about it.
And,

2893
02:52:55.971 --> 02:52:58.630
uh,
someone wrote about it on reddit too and I kind of agreed with them a little

2894
02:52:58.631 --> 02:53:02.620
bit.
So I decided to start doing more,
more gigs.
And A,

2895
02:53:02.621 --> 02:53:06.250
I've got the Ontario Improv that I booked for the first week in October,

2896
02:53:06.670 --> 02:53:11.380
and then the Irvine Improv for the first week in November.

2897
02:53:11.500 --> 02:53:15.220
So the first weekend in November,
what?
Ontario.
It's fucking awesome.
Yeah,

2898
02:53:15.221 --> 02:53:18.700
it's awesome.
So as Irvine,
uh,
so first weekend in October,

2899
02:53:18.701 --> 02:53:20.830
the Ontario Improv thing,
tickets are on sale already.

2900
02:53:20.831 --> 02:53:25.150
And then the first weekend in November,
