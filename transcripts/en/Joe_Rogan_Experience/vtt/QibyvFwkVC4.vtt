00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Freak bitches</v>

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.140
<v Speaker 2>for the social justice warrior types out there who might be listening.</v>

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:07.651
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

4
00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:08.010
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>

5
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 2>are you really willing to say that every single person who's accomplished</v>

6
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 2>something as done that as a consequence of oppression,</v>

7
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.510
<v Speaker 2>that that's again what the Soviets claimed with regards to the to the successful</v>

8
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:19.740
<v Speaker 2>peasants in the 19,</v>

9
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.900
<v Speaker 2>in the just before the 19 twenties.</v>

10
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

11
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

12
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.400
<v Speaker 2>the peasants were in demand,</v>

13
00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:24.781
<v Speaker 2>some painted.</v>

14
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:28.030
<v Speaker 2>They were serfs until about 30 years before that they were served.</v>

15
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.100
<v Speaker 2>They were basically slaves and some of them had clambered up to the point where</v>

16
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 2>maybe they could have owned their hot and a cow and couldn't.</v>

17
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 2>You don't employ someone while the Soviet claim was,</v>

18
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

19
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 2>that's all theft.</v>

20
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.091
<v Speaker 2>You got that all [inaudible],</v>

21
00:00:40.091 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 2>you're an oppressor.</v>

22
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.090
<v Speaker 2>And so then the Soviet intellectuals went into the villages and just imagine how</v>

23
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:45.611
<v Speaker 2>this happened.</v>

24
00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 2>So imagine a village,</v>

25
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 2>small town where everyone knows everybody and there's maybe 10,</v>

26
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:52.890
<v Speaker 2>20 people there who are moderately successful.</v>

27
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.491
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

28
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 2>And so you can imagine that those 20 people have like 100 enemies at the bottom</v>

29
00:00:57.931 --> 00:00:59.760
<v Speaker 2>of the socioeconomic distribution.</v>

30
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 2>Useless,</v>

31
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.841
<v Speaker 2>horrible.</v>

32
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 2>People who are jealous and resentful about the fact that these people have been</v>

33
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:05.304
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>

34
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.641
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

35
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 2>so now the intellectuals come in and say property is theft,</v>

36
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 2>success is oppression,</v>

37
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.830
<v Speaker 2>and then they looked for the people in the village who are willing to move</v>

38
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 2>against those 20 successful people.</v>

39
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 2>Well those guys at the bottom,</v>

40
00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:19.230
<v Speaker 2>those 100 resentful,</v>

41
00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 2>jealous,</v>

42
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.850
<v Speaker 2>murderous people at the bottom there just waiting for an opportunity to go kick</v>

43
00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 2>down some doors and that's exactly what they did in the 19 twenties.</v>

44
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:27.631
<v Speaker 2>And as I said,</v>

45
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 2>they wiped out all their productive peasants and then 6 million Ukrainian starve</v>

46
00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:32.184
<v Speaker 2>to death.</v>

47
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 2>They had posters.</v>

48
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 2>The Soviets produced posters in the 19 thirties that said,</v>

49
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.613
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>

50
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.680
<v Speaker 2>don't forget it's wrong to eat your children.</v>

51
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 2>So whoa.</v>

52
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

53
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:46.014
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

54
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.130
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing about the Soviet.</v>

55
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing that you can imagine that's horrible enough so that it matched</v>

56
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 2>the reality of what happened in the Soviet Union between 19,</v>

57
00:01:57.091 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 2>19 in 1959.</v>

58
00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

59
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.310
<v Speaker 1>I think also technology is just,</v>

60
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.480
<v Speaker 1>it's just trying to get us more and more addicted to it.</v>

61
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.840
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking of this the other day and I was flying back from Hawaii.</v>

62
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.400
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking of how many people I see stare at a phone at the airport,</v>

63
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.400
<v Speaker 1>at the fucking mall,</v>

64
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.220
<v Speaker 1>at a restaurant myself.</v>

65
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm staring at my own phone and I'm not immune to it.</v>

66
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.590
<v Speaker 1>We're all staring at fucking phones and I'm like,</v>

67
00:02:23.591 --> 00:02:25.270
<v Speaker 1>if I was a pilgrim,</v>

68
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.493
<v Speaker 1>if you took,</v>

69
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.970
<v Speaker 1>you went back in a time machine,</v>

70
00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:31.750
<v Speaker 1>you grabbed a pilgrim and dragged them to 2016 and he said,</v>

71
00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:32.584
<v Speaker 1>what are you saying?</v>

72
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.321
<v Speaker 1>It be like,</v>

73
00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:34.240
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

74
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.330
<v Speaker 1>they're all prisoners to the looking glass.</v>

75
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.380
<v Speaker 1>He'd been captured like slipped runners spell under a spell.</v>

76
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.650
<v Speaker 1>They stare at a fucking glass screen first thing in the morning.</v>

77
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.240
<v Speaker 1>They check their email to go to work.</v>

78
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.230
<v Speaker 1>They stare at a screen.</v>

79
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.920
<v Speaker 1>They look at their navigation system while they're fucking driving to work.</v>

80
00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:51.670
<v Speaker 1>They get home,</v>

81
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.410
<v Speaker 1>they watch tv before they go to bed.</v>

82
00:02:53.411 --> 00:02:54.670
<v Speaker 1>They check their email again.</v>

83
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.920
<v Speaker 1>They're just staring at fucking screens.</v>

84
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.870
<v Speaker 1>They're living their lives through screens.</v>

85
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>I would think that looking glass,</v>

86
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>it's captivated though.</v>

87
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I would think they were under the spell of glass,</v>

88
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 1>like there was something about something bond.</v>

89
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>They're not moving.</v>

90
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>They're just sitting there in front of this fucking thing all day.</v>

91
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.510
<v Speaker 1>They're almost.</v>

92
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 1>There's almost no movement.</v>

93
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Almost all the time you're in front of a screen.</v>

94
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.860
<v Speaker 1>You're just sitting there.</v>

95
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

96
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 1>If you saw that and you had no idea what the fuck a television was or a phone,</v>

97
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 1>you were just a person from another time period and he said,</v>

98
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:26.704
<v Speaker 1>what do you think's going on?</v>

99
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Like with these fucking people are under a spell.</v>

100
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>They're clearly under a spell.</v>

101
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Like it's given them something.</v>

102
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

103
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.430
<v Speaker 1>but that's what a spell his fucking.</v>

104
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>When the,</v>

105
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.100
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

106
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.391
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

107
00:03:35.391 --> 00:03:38.950
<v Speaker 1>the hypnotic dancer dances in front of you and then all of a sudden you don't</v>

108
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:39.970
<v Speaker 1>even know where you are anymore.</v>

109
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:42.220
<v Speaker 1>It's because you're looking at something cool at the Strip club.</v>

110
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

111
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.961
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

112
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:44.794
<v Speaker 1>Nowhere you are.</v>

113
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

114
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.800
<v Speaker 1>You ate the edible.</v>

115
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Did Joey Diaz gave you that was mislabeled on purpose.</v>

116
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 1>This is what you're seeing.</v>

117
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.950
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing something amazing and that amazing thing is making you want more</v>

118
00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>of it so you're.</v>

119
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.370
<v Speaker 1>You're spending more money to get a better computer to make better explosions on</v>

120
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:07.660
<v Speaker 1>the bigger screen that has the better sound and it keeps going deeper and deeper</v>

121
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:11.470
<v Speaker 1>and every fucking new phone has some new way to get you excited and you keep.</v>

122
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.530
<v Speaker 1>You're staring at the newest and best screen and it just locked into this sort</v>

123
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 1>of hypnotic trance of technology.</v>

124
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.011
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

125
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:21.540
<v Speaker 1>it allows.</v>

126
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.630
<v Speaker 1>It allows you to Bluetooth with your navigation so it syncs up to your car and</v>

127
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 1>like you're still staring at a fucking screen and not doing anything.</v>

128
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what's happening.</v>

129
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>The same effect is taking place.</v>

130
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.780
<v Speaker 1>You're staring at a screen.</v>

131
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.770
<v Speaker 2>I've identified this sort of thing.</v>

132
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:37.663
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

133
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.480
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

134
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.630
<v Speaker 2>an idea I've been working on called Yellowstone Syndrome though,</v>

135
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.010
<v Speaker 2>is where people,</v>

136
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Americans,</v>

137
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.290
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

138
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.920
<v Speaker 2>so many of them,</v>

139
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.670
<v Speaker 2>their only idea about wildlife and wildlife politics and wildlife management</v>

140
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.790
<v Speaker 2>comes from the yellowstone story.</v>

141
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.830
<v Speaker 2>That they wind up having a difficult time understanding wildlife and wildlife</v>

142
00:04:57.831 --> 00:05:01.100
<v Speaker 2>management in situations that are outside of a national park setting.</v>

143
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.920
<v Speaker 2>Which is to say they don't have a very good grasp on the inevitable conflicts</v>

144
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.100
<v Speaker 2>that are going to arise between wildlife and society and that's a large chunk of</v>

145
00:05:13.851 --> 00:05:16.370
<v Speaker 2>ground where you just do not have those sorts of conflicts.</v>

146
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of conflicts were talking about.</v>

147
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.231
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

148
00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:19.370
<v Speaker 2>like for instance,</v>

149
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.660
<v Speaker 2>a thing has been very difficult and very vexing for wildlife managers is what</v>

150
00:05:23.661 --> 00:05:27.860
<v Speaker 2>happens to what happens to buffalo when they leave national.</v>

151
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.480
<v Speaker 2>The yellowstone national park.</v>

152
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

153
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

154
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:32.813
<v Speaker 2>tobacco on the,</v>

155
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.700
<v Speaker 2>on the yellowstone is she goes to get a sense for how revolutionary that idea</v>

156
00:05:37.701 --> 00:05:38.534
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

157
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:39.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

158
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.770
<v Speaker 2>there was the Indian wars weren't even over when they made yellowstone.</v>

159
00:05:42.771 --> 00:05:43.604
<v Speaker 2>Yellowstone,</v>

160
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

161
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.390
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

162
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.680
<v Speaker 2>we were still battling American Indians on the great plains.</v>

163
00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:49.700
<v Speaker 2>When you also want it to affect,</v>

164
00:05:49.701 --> 00:05:50.061
<v Speaker 2>matter of fact,</v>

165
00:05:50.061 --> 00:05:55.061
<v Speaker 2>yellowstone was a park when the Nez perce were chased through by the US army and</v>

166
00:05:57.201 --> 00:06:01.490
<v Speaker 2>they actually killed a couple terrorists in yellowstone bright as some of the</v>

167
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 2>buildings that are still there.</v>

168
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.500
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

169
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

171
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.930
<v Speaker 2>you went to yellowstone and got shot by Indians who were engaged in a war with</v>

172
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:12.524
<v Speaker 2>the US army.</v>

173
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.890

179
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:27.680
<v Speaker 2>settled and they were made and they made a national park and then Roosevelt went</v>

180
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:28.250
<v Speaker 2>there and uh,</v>

188
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.510
<v Speaker 2>but the only thing that I did was I took appeal that I thought was gonna give me</v>

00:06:50.501 --> 00:06:51.221
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>

195
00:06:51.221 --> 00:06:53.530
<v Speaker 1>When someone gives you this pill and you don't know where it came from,</v>

203
00:06:58.101 --> 00:06:59.360
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think of it because,</v>

204
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:00.194
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

205
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.630
<v Speaker 2>I had been dealing with the athletic commission.</v>

206
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 2>I've been in the UFC for a long time and I've taken a little gas station,</v>

207
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:07.581
<v Speaker 2>take pills before,</v>

208
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:08.090

213
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:15.321
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

214
00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:16.160
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think I got lucky.</v>

215
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:18.620
<v Speaker 2>I thought that you failed drug tests when you're doing sketchy shit.</v>

216
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:18.921
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's a really well done video.</v>

244
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:52.930
<v Speaker 1>She's very,</v>

245
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:57.930
<v Speaker 1>it's very smartly edited and very smartly narrated and she starts talking about</v>

246
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:00.140
<v Speaker 1>the Turkey industry,</v>

247
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:01.520
<v Speaker 1>but she sets it up really well.</v>

248
00:08:01.521 --> 00:08:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Like what did we just sort of do it,</v>

00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:07.520
<v Speaker 1>like why do we turn and then she takes you to this Mike Rowe episode where they</v>

250
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:12.050
<v Speaker 1>show how they get Turkey come and that all these turkeys are so they're so</v>

252
00:08:14.611 --> 00:08:17.760
<v Speaker 1>you literally can't physically have sex and they can watch on the catwalk.</v>

253
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:22.370
<v Speaker 1>And so these artificial insemination and so this guy has to literally talk,</v>

254
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:23.990
<v Speaker 1>talk sweet to them.</v>

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.840
<v Speaker 1>They have this Turkey's legs clamp down on this machine and then he's like</v>

258
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.140
<v Speaker 1>touching it and with a tube.</v>

262
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Turkey's got to be like,</v>

263
00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:42.800
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck going.</v>

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:44.870
<v Speaker 1>He's getting settled.</v>

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:45.763
<v Speaker 1>He's coming.</v>

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.030
<v Speaker 1>This guy has a tube.</v>

268
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.030
<v Speaker 1>He's sucking the come out of this Turkey's whole,</v>

269
00:08:50.031 --> 00:08:50.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

270
00:08:50.211 --> 00:08:53.480
<v Speaker 1>because they have like that one sort of universal whole for everything.</v>

271
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

272
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.470
<v Speaker 1>And as he sucking to out of it,</v>

273
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:56.191
<v Speaker 1>he has a glass,</v>

274
00:08:56.191 --> 00:08:58.590
<v Speaker 1>a bottle of water with them because sometimes it gets in his mouth.</v>

275
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:00.200
<v Speaker 1>So he has to clean it out,</v>

276
00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 1>like kind of a fucking job,</v>

277
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:03.570
<v Speaker 1>but this is the only way you can get this stuff.</v>

278
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 1>This dude Turkey rape should be illegal,</v>

279
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.960
<v Speaker 1>totally illegal.</v>

280
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.820
<v Speaker 1>But it's amazing that nobody talks about that.</v>

281
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.470
<v Speaker 1>But everybody talks about like force feeding ducks to get fog wall.</v>
