00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Fairly Lockhart,</v>

3
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:03.991
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

4
00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:05.970
<v Speaker 1>A used to be on the Frank Kelly endo shown is,</v>

5
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.111
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

6
00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:08.820
<v Speaker 1>one of the best impression is out there.</v>

7
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.350
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

8
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>you do impressions that are very weird man.</v>

9
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 1>You do some impressions that no one else does.</v>

10
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.700
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

11
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.650
<v Speaker 1>I figured that that's what you should do.</v>

12
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:17.490
<v Speaker 1>I always figured it's like,</v>

13
00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>why get in and do something?</v>

14
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.461
<v Speaker 1>The Nicholson,</v>

15
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:21.091
<v Speaker 1>the ones like that,</v>

16
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>it's like I try to find a strange one and I do it like [inaudible] man,</v>

17
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>don't nobody do it.</v>

18
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Bunch of bitches.</v>

19
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I do it better than I to t man,</v>

20
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:32.930
<v Speaker 1>not to his voiceover work and whatnot.</v>

21
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.780
<v Speaker 1>I love to say what not do you know at the Lisbon everything?</v>

22
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.570
<v Speaker 1>I tried to make a little list there and he fights a little lift,</v>

23
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of gangster and it works for him.</v>

24
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:42.091
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

25
00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Pitch us,</v>

26
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.293
<v Speaker 1>dig it.</v>

27
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.550
<v Speaker 1>I used to do that at the comedy store.</v>

28
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:50.100
<v Speaker 1>I used to call the comedy store is ice tea in this poor guy,</v>

29
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:50.791
<v Speaker 1>Kenny Tenney.</v>

30
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:52.260
<v Speaker 1>This guy used to work the phones there.</v>

31
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember this guy?</v>

32
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.360
<v Speaker 1>He was Mitsis Pool Guy and there was something,</v>

33
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.420
<v Speaker 1>something was off with him.</v>

34
00:00:57.421 --> 00:00:58.141
<v Speaker 1>Definitely say,</v>

35
00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:58.411
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

36
00:00:58.411 --> 00:00:59.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say what he had,</v>

37
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:01.070
<v Speaker 1>but he definitely wasn't one of us.</v>

38
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

39
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't thinking right,</v>

40
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>but he was,</v>

41
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.991
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

42
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:04.660
<v Speaker 1>he got,</v>

43
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.461
<v Speaker 1>he made money.</v>

44
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:05.850
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

45
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>he had a pool company,</v>

46
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:08.400
<v Speaker 1>he cleaned pulls and he did it well,</v>

47
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.560
<v Speaker 1>but he'd function like an eight year old and a,</v>

48
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>I would call him every time he would pick up the phone,</v>

49
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Speaker 1>I would call them and I would be ice tea and he would fall for it every time.</v>

50
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:16.291
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

51
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:16.621
<v Speaker 1>Yo man,</v>

52
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm bringing 30 people in tonight,</v>

53
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:18.960
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

54
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.690
<v Speaker 1>What you got on my booth that you would</v>

55
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.790
<v Speaker 1>like?</v>

56
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>I Miss Jay,</v>

57
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 1>we don't have a booth at six 30 I'm like,</v>

58
00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:27.150
<v Speaker 1>you better build one for me.</v>

59
00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Well I'll see if we can,</v>

60
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

61
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.573
<v Speaker 1>ah.</v>

62
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>That's how I would brush up on the impression as if I could pull Kenny Turney.</v>

63
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.730
<v Speaker 1>I felt like it was golden.</v>

64
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:37.410
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>

66
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>do you work impressions of you practice them at home and then eventually bring</v>

67
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>them this stage or do you know when you hear somebody whether or not you can do</v>

68
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

69
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.921
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

70
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

71
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.410
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people,</v>

72
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.740
<v Speaker 1>if you hear them right away,</v>

73
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:47.271
<v Speaker 1>I know I can do it.</v>

74
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>If somebody that tends to have a deeper voice or something like that or if</v>

75
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:50.820
<v Speaker 1>there's a weird thing about them,</v>

76
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>I know I can do it,</v>

77
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:54.690
<v Speaker 1>but I always more so than the way it sounds,</v>

78
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:57.840
<v Speaker 1>it's the way somebody looks when they talk because people move their mouth a</v>

79
00:01:57.841 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 1>certain way that will reveal half the impression.</v>

80
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

81
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.370
<v Speaker 1>I just realized talking to you about impressions,</v>

82
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:03.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

84
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.150
<v Speaker 1>I've never practiced any of the impressions that I've done.</v>

85
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I just do them like with Joey Diaz or something like that.</v>

86
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:10.050
<v Speaker 1>I just know I can do it and I just do it.</v>

87
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

88
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.281
<v Speaker 1>are you that way too?</v>

89
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Like you hear someone talk?</v>

90
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

91
00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like you got to get out of your own way.</v>

92
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.340
<v Speaker 1>You've just let it filter in and come out.</v>

93
00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Come out of here,</v>

94
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Speaker 1>cause it's like,</v>

96
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>like you'll hear it if you should try to scrutinize it,</v>

97
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:23.070
<v Speaker 1>you'll really start to fuck it up.</v>

98
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.913
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

99
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.691
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

101
00:02:25.691 --> 00:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>I'll listen to them on headphones and if I don't hear my voice anymore and that</v>

102
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:29.604
<v Speaker 1>means I've matched it,</v>

103
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.630
<v Speaker 1>wo it means I've matched it.</v>

104
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:35.480
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the Morgan Freeman when I started working on an eighth grade,</v>

105
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:36.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm here that way.</v>

106
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.040
<v Speaker 1>I now hold on Joe Rogan.</v>

107
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.113
<v Speaker 1>Let me get to that.</v>

108
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.643
<v Speaker 1>Let's see here.</v>

109
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.250
<v Speaker 1>There's a fella named Morgan Freeman and I started working on the impression</v>

110
00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:45.270
<v Speaker 1>when I was in the eighth grade.</v>

111
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.283
<v Speaker 1>Yes sir.</v>

112
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>I was about 14 years old,</v>

113
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>jerked off seven times a day.</v>

114
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.161
<v Speaker 1>She's had,</v>

115
00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:52.590
<v Speaker 1>it's creepy and it took me forever.</v>

116
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.371
<v Speaker 1>What happens,</v>

117
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:53.731
<v Speaker 1>creep.</v>

118
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>And the way I finally perfected it,</v>

119
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:57.990
<v Speaker 1>when I was like 22 I saw Ben Affleck on,</v>

120
00:02:57.991 --> 00:02:58.201
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

121
00:02:58.201 --> 00:02:58.531
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

122
00:02:58.531 --> 00:02:59.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

123
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.681
<v Speaker 1>Dave Letterman.</v>

124
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 1>And he was doing it a Morgan Freeman impression,</v>

125
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.291
<v Speaker 1>but it was horrible.</v>

126
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 1>But he was doing one thing.</v>

127
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't doing it right.</v>

128
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.260
<v Speaker 1>It's that thing.</v>

129
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:06.094
<v Speaker 1>It's all in here.</v>

130
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>He was adding that everything else was wrong.</v>

131
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 1>And I married the two and I was talking like Morgan Freeman all day.</v>

132
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 1>I was calling restaurants,</v>

133
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 1>but like I'd like to get a table for two planes and was like,</v>

134
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:16.301
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

135
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:16.841
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Freeman.</v>

136
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>I was testing it out and I was like,</v>

137
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:18.784
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

138
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

139
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.261
<v Speaker 1>So when I nail one,</v>

140
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:23.410
<v Speaker 1>I've been working on a Tom Hanks for years and I still can't get it.</v>

141
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 1>There's something,</v>

142
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>but he's one of those like ice tea,</v>

143
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 1>like Morgan Freeman.</v>

144
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows who he is,</v>

145
00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>but nobody does.</v>

146
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>And you know it's somewhere in here.</v>

147
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:32.134
<v Speaker 1>I found that I can,</v>

148
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>I can go back and forth with it,</v>

149
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:34.561
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

150
00:03:34.561 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

151
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.920
<v Speaker 1>you miss it a little.</v>

152
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:36.754
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

153
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm game show hosts d with it right now,</v>

154
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:39.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's like there's,</v>

155
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 1>there's World War II,</v>

156
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 1>Tom Hanks who's very solemn and talks about World War II,</v>

157
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.150
<v Speaker 1>but then there's,</v>

158
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm on Conan O'brien.</v>

160
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>The shape of your head is wrong,</v>

161
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 1>but I can't make that noise.</v>

162
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 1>I think that is,</v>

163
00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 1>I think that has lots to do with impressions because there's certain impressions</v>

164
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 1>that I can do that other people can't do.</v>

165
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

166
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the shape of my face.</v>

167
00:03:56.591 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>There's money,</v>

168
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.460
<v Speaker 1>there's ways to manipulate your throat.</v>

169
00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

170

184
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:34.150

202
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.760
<v Speaker 1>I took bong rips out of a homemade bomb and I blew them.</v>

203
00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.590
<v Speaker 1>And to everybody on the floors,</v>

204
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.453

207
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 1>One of the best documentaries I've seen in pro Bobby Lee's recommendation.</v>

208
00:05:08.831 --> 00:05:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Funny enough.</v>

209
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

210
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.280
<v Speaker 1>And not funny enough because sometimes he recommends really good stuff,</v>

211
00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:13.810
<v Speaker 1>but other times he recommends horrible.</v>

212
00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:15.250
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst thing he's ever recommended.</v>

213
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.203
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

214

00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:23.771
<v Speaker 1>It was awful.</v>

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.733
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't brilliant.</v>

228
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.770
<v Speaker 1>A lot of his stuff.</v>

229
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.290
<v Speaker 1>He bought impressions.</v>

230
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.240

256
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.100

257
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 1>to stand down.</v>

258

<v Speaker 1>Niche almost sounds a little Sam Elliott in there too,</v>

259
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.990
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>

260
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Raj Realm.</v>

261
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.510
<v Speaker 1>If you don't get any roadhouse quotes in,</v>

262
00:06:27.511 --> 00:06:32.510
<v Speaker 1>you show that man to the door and if he doesn't go quietly,</v>

263
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.720
<v Speaker 1>what does it use this truck and head and by yourself at dodge ram pickup with</v>

264
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 1>all the torque and you definitely know how to stretch his words out.</v>

265
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.120
<v Speaker 1>The waist turns his words and rocky get on the bike.</v>

266
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.983
<v Speaker 1>Rocky.</v>

267
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.711
<v Speaker 1>Rocky.</v>

<v Speaker 1>tea and cocoa?</v>

271
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 1>What did you do recently?</v>

272
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.163
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

273
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.090
<v Speaker 1>triply show.</v>

274
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

275
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe ball baby pool.</v>

276
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

277
00:06:56.211 --> 00:06:58.550
<v Speaker 1>we did an ice tea commercial with,</v>

278
00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.493
<v Speaker 1>with a coco.</v>

279
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Great Cocoa Look alike my way.</v>

280
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.281
<v Speaker 1>Did she look just like,</v>

281
00:07:03.281 --> 00:07:03.411
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

282
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:03.741
<v Speaker 1>go for it.</v>

283
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:04.670
<v Speaker 1>She was built like her.</v>

284
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:06.530
<v Speaker 1>She was an anomaly like this huge ass.</v>

285
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Huge boobs and this tiny waist.</v>

286
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Now granted it was all sculpted that way,</v>

287
00:07:09.441 --> 00:07:10.700
<v Speaker 1>but it was still this anomaly.</v>

288
00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:11.210
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

289
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.043
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

290
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.050
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous.</v>

291
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Sculptors meaning like operations,</v>

292
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.550
<v Speaker 1>operations at top.</v>
