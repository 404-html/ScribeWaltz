00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.460
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:03.830
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

3
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I was 22,</v>

4
00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:05.670
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

5
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.870
<v Speaker 1>my wife left me,</v>

6
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>I moved to Boise just cause it sounded funny because I was still in that fraud</v>

7
00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>telemarketing so I could do it anywhere.</v>

8
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 1>There's a phone,</v>

9
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.400
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

10
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm in business.</v>

11
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:15.991
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

12
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>after we moved to Boise and immediately my wife left me for my best friend.</v>

14
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:25.170
<v Speaker 1>We all moved out there together and then my other buddy that moved with us</v>

15
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>couldn't handle the stress,</v>

16
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>so he went back to Vegas.</v>

17
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.830
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>

18
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.281
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

19
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>it was all my shit to Boise and within two weeks I'm alone.</v>

20
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.410
<v Speaker 1>So I moved up to this fucking,</v>

21
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>I bought a cabin like a</v>

22
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.840
<v Speaker 1>for sale by owner.</v>

23
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:40.674
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

24
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.060
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't get a loan.</v>

25
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

26
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to give you,</v>

27
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.840
<v Speaker 1>what did he,</v>

28
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.673
<v Speaker 1>what do you call it?</v>

29
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.553
<v Speaker 1>We're</v>

30
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.340
<v Speaker 1>just signed a contract and I'll pay you,</v>

31
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:55.341
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go through a bank owner financed owner finance and a little cabin,</v>

32
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>two bars in town and you are either a long branch guy or you're the dirty shame</v>

33
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:02.820
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

34
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>And I was a dirty shame saloon guy and I would drive back and forth cause in a</v>

35
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:12.801
<v Speaker 1>small town they open around noon but not necessarily at noon.</v>

36
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 1>And how old were you then?</v>

37
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.630
<v Speaker 1>22 that's hilarious.</v>

38
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>No fucking chicks there.</v>

39
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.100
<v Speaker 1>So you were would drive back and forth in front of the bar until Jolene showed</v>

40
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:22.951
<v Speaker 1>up to open.</v>

41
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:24.570
<v Speaker 1>So if it's 1215,</v>

42
00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:28.720
<v Speaker 1>I've been just driving back and forth waiting for it to open and I would uh,</v>

43
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.230
<v Speaker 1>I lasted like six months and then I had to ditch out on the fucking there by his</v>

44
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 1>owner financing.</v>

45
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

46
00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>At one point my buddy that moved back to Vegas came up and he was there for a</v>

47
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 1>couple months,</v>

48
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.520
<v Speaker 1>but we'd get on the phone just enough to pay our bar tab.</v>

49
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.061
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

50
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:45.894
<v Speaker 1>my bar tab,</v>

51
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>I traded out like furniture when I,</v>

52
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.381
<v Speaker 1>when I bailed,</v>

53
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:54.381
<v Speaker 1>six months later I traded Jolene like my furniture in the cabin for my bar tab.</v>

54
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.940
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>

55
00:01:56.941 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking crazy.</v>

56
00:01:57.961 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>So you could set your own hours when you're doing that scam telemarketing stuff.</v>

57
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:02.560
<v Speaker 1>He just did it whenever you want it to.</v>

58
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 1>And they just got like you clocked in,</v>

59
00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:06.101
<v Speaker 1>he got pay?</v>

60
00:02:06.101 --> 00:02:06.301
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

61
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 1>I was doing it out of my cabin.</v>

62
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 1>This was just pick up the phone.</v>

63
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I had leads I stole from Vegas.</v>

64
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:13.314
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

65
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.701
<v Speaker 1>and what did you do?</v>

66
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Like how did that work?</v>

67
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I'd call up businesses and the dad the pitch and you won one of these awards and</v>

68
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>you just have to buy this many,</v>

79
00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:38.754

<v Speaker 1>and you're guaranteed to win this big award.</v>

82
00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:42.790
<v Speaker 1>That's worth way,</v>

83
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.623
<v Speaker 1>boy.</v>

84
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.731
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

85
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:46.320
<v Speaker 1>So it was just a total scam.</v>

86
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

87
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.053
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

88
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.730
<v Speaker 1>But cleverly phrased,</v>

89
00:02:50.731 --> 00:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>so to stay in that gray area of legal,</v>

90
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.020
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

91
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.853
<v Speaker 1>where like,</v>

92
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>I knew a dude who had an really interesting scam.</v>

93
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>He had a scam</v>

94
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 2>where they were making a,</v>

95
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 2>it was a company that would allow you to fix your credit,</v>

96
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 2>so they would give you a line of credit.</v>

97
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 2>And a,</v>

98
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.920
<v Speaker 2>you would buy things and then pay off the credit and it would boost your credit</v>

99
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:18.131
<v Speaker 2>backs.</v>

100
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 2>If you had fucked up credit.</v>

101
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.961
<v Speaker 2>It was all,</v>

102
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 2>it was allowing you to fix your credit.</v>

103
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 2>But the catch was the only things you could buy with their credit card was</v>

104
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 2>things from their catalog.</v>

105
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 2>So my soul to the company's story,</v>

106
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.800
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

107
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 2>you know those things.</v>

108
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.580
<v Speaker 2>So they had these Camelot scam,</v>

109
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 2>but I'm catalepsy and words go with stuff.</v>

110
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 2>But say if something costs,</v>

111
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.471
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

112
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:38.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

113
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was,</v>

114
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.490
<v Speaker 2>toenail clipper for cost like $3 at the grocery store there is $25.</v>

115
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.870
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to buy it,</v>

116
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.201
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

117
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:47.441
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

118
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 2>you're giving them a giant chunk of profit.</v>

119
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 2>So they would ship these terrible little items and it would really actually</v>

120
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 2>boost these people's credit.</v>

121
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:57.840
<v Speaker 2>It actually did work wear boot.</v>

122
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.270
<v Speaker 2>So it was enough that,</v>

123
00:03:59.271 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 2>but it was a total scam.</v>

124
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

125
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.780
<v Speaker 2>you're the only shit they can buy with your credit cards is stuff from your</v>

126
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 2>catalog and everything's marked up through the fucking roof.</v>

127
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 2>And this dude made millions on that made millions</v>

128
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.753
<v Speaker 1>products.</v>

129
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was working for a company originally we have the uh,</v>

130
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.133
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

131
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

132
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.303
<v Speaker 1>black matte,</v>

133
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.350
<v Speaker 1>a pen with the gold middle Florentine Trim and five lines of your ad copy on it</v>

134
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:33.121
<v Speaker 1>and we'd be selling these fucking 25 cent pens for like $4 a piece.</v>

135
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 1>So it was put the scan that I was just getting into when I started doing comedy</v>

136
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 1>and then bailed out then went full time in comedy was the uh,</v>

137
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.690
<v Speaker 1>the invention once like the George Foreman.</v>

138
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.711
<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>

139
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:48.370
<v Speaker 1>the grill.</v>

140
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.203
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

141
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Do you have an invention it and it's a fucking guy.</v>

142
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.530
<v Speaker 1>It's just such a great scam because egos involved and it's getting,</v>

143
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:59.320
<v Speaker 1>everyone thinks they should be on shark tank,</v>

145
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.120
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of people.</v>

146
00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:01.421
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>

147
00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 1>I can't say,</v>

148
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.730
<v Speaker 1>but I think what you have here and the,</v>

149
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:09.610
<v Speaker 1>and then it's a multilevel where vent help.</v>

150
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.150
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

151
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Submit your invention idea to companies.</v>

152
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying invent help is a scam.</v>

153
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying scams of that.</v>

154
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you have an invention?</v>

155
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.130
<v Speaker 1>And then there's step one is we're going to do a,</v>

156
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.760
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

157
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

158
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:24.730
<v Speaker 1>patent,</v>

159
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:25.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

160
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

161
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.850
<v Speaker 1>research to see,</v>

162
00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:29.230
<v Speaker 1>and this is going to cost you this,</v>

163
00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>but honestly,</v>

164
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:31.384
<v Speaker 1>Phil,</v>

165
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.310
<v Speaker 1>I think you're onto something.</v>

166
00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:36.610
<v Speaker 1>I can't say that this is $1 million idea,</v>

167
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.473
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

168
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.830
<v Speaker 1>I know when I have a feeling it's the way you say it,</v>

169
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.160
<v Speaker 1>but you can look at examples where the United States has imposed a minimum wage</v>

170
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.430
<v Speaker 1>on other countries.</v>

171
00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean the minimum wage did a lot of damage in Puerto Rico.</v>

172
00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:51.341
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

173
00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:52.960
<v Speaker 1>look at another American territory.</v>

174
00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:55.780
<v Speaker 1>American Samoa or in American Samoa.</v>

175
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 1>We basically American Samoa</v>

176
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 3>with our minimum wage.</v>

177
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:00.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's Samoans or you know,</v>

178
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:01.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

179
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:01.270
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

180
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 3>are furious about it.</v>

181
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 3>This happened years ago actually.</v>

182
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

183
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.380
<v Speaker 3>the reason I even found out about it,</v>

184
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.970
<v Speaker 3>I was watching 60 minutes and they were doing a report about I think football</v>

185
00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 3>players in Samoa.</v>

186
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

187
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.820
<v Speaker 3>and during their report they mentioned that there was like a depression going on</v>

188
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:20.600
<v Speaker 3>in Samoa and it was like there was 30% unemployment and really high inflation.</v>

189
00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:21.050
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

190
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.190
<v Speaker 3>what the hell is going on in Samoa?</v>

191
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.140
<v Speaker 3>So I wanted to research that on my own.</v>

192
00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:28.060
<v Speaker 3>And I found out that we impose the minimum wage on Samoa and we destroyed all</v>

193
00:06:28.061 --> 00:06:28.760
<v Speaker 3>their jobs.</v>

194
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.140
<v Speaker 3>They're the two biggest employers were to a chicken of the sea and starkist,</v>

195
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.500
<v Speaker 3>they were canning tuna and then they were shipping the tuna back to the</v>

196
00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 3>mainland.</v>

197
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.140
<v Speaker 3>But the minute they raised the minimum wage,</v>

198
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 3>they made the production,</v>

199
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

200
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 3>uncompetitive because now you had to pay the higher wages,</v>

201
00:06:44.151 --> 00:06:45.200
<v Speaker 3>plus the shipping costs.</v>

202
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.580
<v Speaker 3>They get the tuna back to the mainland.</v>

203
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:47.990
<v Speaker 3>So they all,</v>

204
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:51.140
<v Speaker 3>the canneries shut down and then it created massive unemployment.</v>

205
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.830
<v Speaker 3>And then prices went way up on the island because they no longer had boats</v>

206
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.660
<v Speaker 3>coming back and forth to pick up the tuna.</v>

207
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 3>So now all of a sudden the shipping cost of imports went way up.</v>

208
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:01.100
<v Speaker 3>So they had massive inflation,</v>

209
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.600
<v Speaker 3>sky high unemployment,</v>

210
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.010
<v Speaker 3>all because the minimum wage.</v>

211
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:09.020
<v Speaker 3>So you could look at examples of how minimum wage destroys jobs.</v>

212
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:09.740
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

213
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:09.951
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

214
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:10.521
<v Speaker 3>right there,</v>

215
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:14.750
<v Speaker 3>yet they continue to advocate for these higher wages because it sounds good.</v>

216
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:14.961
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

217
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:17.360
<v Speaker 3>everybody should earn a decent living.</v>

218
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.721
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

219
00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:17.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

220
00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:18.201
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

221
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:19.370
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have any skills,</v>

222
00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:20.204
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>

223
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.630
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of course you know a lot of kids here,</v>

224
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:22.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

225
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:23.661
<v Speaker 3>they're 16,</v>

226
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:24.141
<v Speaker 3>17,</v>

227
00:07:24.141 --> 00:07:24.471
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>

228
00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:24.861
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>

229
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:25.221
<v Speaker 3>20.</v>

230
00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:27.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean people live with their parents still.</v>

231
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

232
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.510
<v Speaker 3>the most important thing is getting a job so you can acquire the skills to get a</v>

233
00:07:32.511 --> 00:07:33.620
<v Speaker 3>better job to,</v>

234
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:33.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

235
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.340
<v Speaker 3>to move up the ladder in an organization to enhance your,</v>

236
00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:37.581
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

237
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:40.160
<v Speaker 3>your value to employers in general.</v>

238
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.660
<v Speaker 2>The argument against this,</v>

239
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.340
<v Speaker 2>short against what you're saying about minimum wage against to all of these</v>

240
00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:47.630
<v Speaker 2>ideas that you're,</v>

241
00:07:47.631 --> 00:07:48.590
<v Speaker 2>you're just proposing,</v>

242
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:50.090
<v Speaker 2>do you do get a lot of pushback?</v>

243
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.541
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

244
00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:52.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure what you're saying,</v>

245
00:07:52.161 --> 00:07:54.990
<v Speaker 2>this free market capitalism approach is,</v>

246
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:55.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

247
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:56.780
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that oppose it.</v>

248
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.831
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

249
00:07:57.831 --> 00:07:59.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean know there's a lot of people that don't think it out.</v>

250
00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:01.580
<v Speaker 3>They think with their mind or their,</v>

251
00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:02.080
<v Speaker 3>or their,</v>

252
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.210
<v Speaker 3>their heart and they don't even get there.</v>

253
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.430
<v Speaker 3>The re the origin of the minimum wage was racism.</v>

254
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:07.791
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

255
00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:09.260
<v Speaker 3>the first minimum wage is here.</v>

256
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 3>It was designed to keep employers from hiring.</v>

257
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:12.860
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

258
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.440
<v Speaker 3>the Chinese are from hiring blacks because they,</v>

259
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:15.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

260
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.750
<v Speaker 3>that that's where the minimum wage came from,</v>

261
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.171
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

262
00:08:18.171 --> 00:08:20.720
<v Speaker 3>to try to prevent employers from hiring certain people.</v>

263
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.261
<v Speaker 3>So they said,</v>

264
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:21.351
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

265
00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:25.280
<v Speaker 3>let's have a minimum wage and that will reduce a hiring of people who have less</v>

266
00:08:25.281 --> 00:08:26.090
<v Speaker 3>skills.</v>

267
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:26.481
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

268
00:08:26.481 --> 00:08:27.021
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

269
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:28.100
<v Speaker 3>and the labor unions,</v>

270
00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:31.850
<v Speaker 3>the biggest supporters of the minimum wage are the labor unions.</v>

271
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.900
<v Speaker 3>And none of the labor unions workers earn the minimum wage.</v>

272
00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:36.441
<v Speaker 3>So you might think,</v>

273
00:08:36.441 --> 00:08:37.274
<v Speaker 3>why are they,</v>

274
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.990
<v Speaker 3>did they still care about the minimum wage?</v>

275
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.520
<v Speaker 3>If they don't,</v>

276
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.210
<v Speaker 3>they'll get paid a lot higher than minimum wage.</v>

277
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.770
<v Speaker 3>And it's because you always have a competition between skilled labor and</v>

278
00:08:45.771 --> 00:08:46.760
<v Speaker 3>unskilled labor,</v>

279
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.001
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

280
00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:48.680
<v Speaker 3>So let's say a business,</v>

281
00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:52.730
<v Speaker 3>a business man has the option of hiring a skilled person to do something.</v>

282
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.060
<v Speaker 3>And let's say the skilled person is going to charge quite hours an hour or an</v>

283
00:08:58.261 --> 00:08:59.280
<v Speaker 3>unskilled person.</v>

284
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 3>And let's say I can hire three on skilled people for $5 an hour,</v>

285
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.980
<v Speaker 3>and that equals 15.</v>

286
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:05.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

287
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:05.731
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

288
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:07.410
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather hire the unskilled worker.</v>

289
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:11.340
<v Speaker 3>I can pay three $5 an hour to do the same job of one skilled worker.</v>

290
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.260
<v Speaker 3>But now if the skilled worker can,</v>

291
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.630
<v Speaker 3>could lobby for $7 minimum wage,</v>

292
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.880
<v Speaker 3>now if I have to hire three unskilled people,</v>

293
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:19.770
<v Speaker 3>it costs $21 Aha.</v>

294
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.611
<v Speaker 3>Now all of a sudden,</v>

295
00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:22.020
<v Speaker 3>I hire the guy with skills.</v>

296
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:27.410
<v Speaker 3>So the labor unions benefit by keeping unskilled people unemployed because they</v>

297
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:30.840
<v Speaker 3>have more skills and therefore they can,</v>

298
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

299
00:09:31.081 --> 00:09:32.100
<v Speaker 3>they can get more work.</v>

300
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.860
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like a complicated mess to me.</v>

301
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.730
<v Speaker 3>It is a mess for the,</v>

302
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:37.590
<v Speaker 3>for the,</v>

303
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Speaker 3>for the people that get get priced out of a job.</v>

304
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:40.763
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

305
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:50.520
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
