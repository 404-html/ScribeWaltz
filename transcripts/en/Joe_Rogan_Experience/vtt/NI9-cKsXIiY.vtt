00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.140
<v Speaker 1>So he was the problem on the plane because what happened was he's walking down</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.880
<v Speaker 1>and then they get them into a chair and the foot felt better.</v>

59
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

60
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.920

62
00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.711
<v Speaker 1>He had,</v>

63
00:01:58.711 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 1>that was the gift.</v>

64
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 1>You get to fly for nothing and get a hotel room,</v>

65
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>bring them in and you cause a problem on the fucking airline.</v>

66
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.100
<v Speaker 1>But that's done.</v>

67
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

68
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.340
<v Speaker 1>that's who he is.</v>

69
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he was his practical joking with,</v>

70
00:02:11.321 --> 00:02:11.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:02:11.741 --> 00:02:12.574
<v Speaker 1>he was</v>

72
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.710
<v Speaker 1>laying at norms.</v>

73
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.201
<v Speaker 1>No Nigga,</v>

74
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:16.034
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>

75
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.190
<v Speaker 1>it really goes,</v>

76
00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 1>his foot really goes,</v>

77
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.180
<v Speaker 1>is it a broken foot?</v>

78
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:22.014
<v Speaker 1>Is it a ligament?</v>

79
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he'd like chips,</v>

80
00:02:23.491 --> 00:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>something in his ankle and he just wouldn't go to the house.</v>

81
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:26.731
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

82
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 1>well they're going to do to me,</v>

83
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:28.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 1>he turns into this baby,</v>

85
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.193
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

86
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.711
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

87
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:33.060
<v Speaker 1>And he would do the road with me,</v>

88
00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:33.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>and I had it when he would do the road with,</v>

90
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I would just take them with me when he would do the road.</v>

91
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.323
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

92
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.850
<v Speaker 1>at that time I had Eddie Griffin with me.</v>

93
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.751
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

94
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

95
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.070
<v Speaker 1>So Eddie Griffin was like the real open,</v>

96
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.080
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

97
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>And so what would happen is I give don 10 minutes right upfront.</v>

98
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>So we'd be on a big tour bus,</v>

99
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>traveling the country and one time he's on the bus and he's like,</v>

100
00:02:57.751 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 1>you know how he gets down on himself,</v>

101
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>like almost like that,</v>

103
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 1>that he's not crying with tears.</v>

104
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 1>But I'm going well down.</v>

105
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>It's because the crowd doesn't respond the way he wants.</v>

106
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

107
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>cause he would come out singing,</v>

108
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 1>tie a yellow ribbon,</v>

109
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.513
<v Speaker 1>you know with the,</v>

111
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 1>with the music over it and get the crowd clapping.</v>

112
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:22.110
<v Speaker 1>And so now the song ends and then he goes into another one.</v>

113
00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 1>I'll go into like Copa Cabana.</v>

114
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.640
<v Speaker 1>So now he's on the bus complaining about that.</v>

115
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Go Don,</v>

116
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 1>it's you a 10 minutes after they get the joke of who you are that you're this</v>

117
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:33.130

<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

120
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:36.910
<v Speaker 1>And he would go,</v>

121
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:37.151
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

122
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:37.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 1>I went into the other,</v>

124
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:38.801
<v Speaker 1>so I go,</v>

125
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to hear another,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

175
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.160
<v Speaker 1>it was a crazy set,</v>

176
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:48.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

178
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 1>I never went through anything like this in a film ever.</v>

179
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.031
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

180
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:53.950
<v Speaker 1>what went on in those five weeks.</v>

181
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.530
<v Speaker 1>And so he's gone,</v>

182
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

183
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.740
<v Speaker 1>two to five weeks.</v>

184
00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:58.330
<v Speaker 1>I've got to hear how they're not going to pay me.</v>

185
00:04:58.331 --> 00:04:58.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

186
00:04:58.601 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>he's just on me that the,</v>

187
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.280
<v Speaker 1>and of course they give me the money and dawn had a tape it up,</v>

188
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:04.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

189
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:05.260
<v Speaker 1>all over my body.</v>

190
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Like that movie midnight express.</v>

191
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.013
<v Speaker 1>Did you really?</v>

192
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

193
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

194
00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:14.161
<v Speaker 1>it was a part of Mexico that we actually thought that the director was going to</v>

195
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.520
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

196
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.910
<v Speaker 1>He stopped at the airport,</v>

197
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

198
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:19.030
<v Speaker 1>so you know with thinking,</v>

199
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.331
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

200
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:19.810
<v Speaker 1>how am I gay?</v>

201
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Cause she not allowed more than like $10,000 in cash and it was a lot of money,</v>

202
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:29.941
<v Speaker 1>so he was taping it with this like paper tape to my chest to my thought.</v>

204
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.890
<v Speaker 1>You know that when I got home and when we're going through the airport,</v>

205
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm gone,</v>

206
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.210
<v Speaker 1>they're going to stop me,</v>

207
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be in jail and whoever stops and he's going to be rich,</v>

208
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

209
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:42.160
<v Speaker 1>it's that simple.</v>

210
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.480
<v Speaker 1>But they didn't stop us.</v>

211
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:48.481
<v Speaker 1>And now I get home and I take off my shirt and my wife sees all this money taped</v>

212
00:05:48.971 --> 00:05:50.350
<v Speaker 1>to my chest and she's going,</v>

213
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.760
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

214
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:52.991
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

215
00:05:52.991 --> 00:05:53.531
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going,</v>

216
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:53.741
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

217
00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:54.640
<v Speaker 1>they paid me.</v>

218
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.533
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

219
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 1>that's how they pay you in Mexico.</v>

220
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 1>But Dom was just so sure.</v>

221
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Then I pay me for them.</v>

222
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 1>It was just crazy.</v>

223
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

224
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.773
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't eat,</v>

225
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 1>we only had one meal a day because everybody on the set was getting sick.</v>

226
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.101
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

227
00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:11.980
<v Speaker 1>everybody was going to the hospital and it,</v>

228
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.460
<v Speaker 1>and all we had every day was um,</v>

229
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.450
<v Speaker 1>we went to the same restaurant about four o'clock every day.</v>

230
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 1>We had pasta with sauce,</v>

231
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 1>garlic bread and Coca Cola with purified ice.</v>

232
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.230
<v Speaker 1>And we would eat til the next day at the same time.</v>

233
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Cause we figured we'd make it the middle of the day because we're only getting</v>

234
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:31.191
<v Speaker 1>that one meal.</v>

235
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 1>We're not eating any of the food there.</v>

236
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

237
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

238
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 1>And he lost like 30 pounds.</v>

239
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

240
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:37.600
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

241
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.150
<v Speaker 1>he's gone.</v>

242
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.200
<v Speaker 1>I got to eat something,</v>

243
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

244
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:41.613
<v Speaker 1>he's going,</v>

245
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.730
<v Speaker 1>this is ridiculous.</v>

246
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.060
<v Speaker 1>We're not eating food,</v>

247
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:44.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

248
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.820
<v Speaker 1>but everybody's fallen at the waist side.</v>

249
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:47.511
<v Speaker 1>What are we going to do?</v>

250
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 1>We got no choice.</v>

251
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.130
<v Speaker 1>This is survival,</v>

252
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:49.701
<v Speaker 1>my friend.</v>

253
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:53.120
<v Speaker 1>Would those be movie sets can be very fucking sketchy.</v>

254
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 1>And it was for a long time,</v>

255
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.430
<v Speaker 1>was hit five weeks of the same food.</v>

256
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:59.800
<v Speaker 1>But I'm a cringe Mexico.</v>

257
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.950
<v Speaker 1>I could do that.</v>

258
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.560
<v Speaker 1>I could eat the same thing every single day,</v>

259
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.660
<v Speaker 1>but you want it like twice a day.</v>

260
00:07:05.661 --> 00:07:06.411
<v Speaker 1>But the restaurant,</v>

261
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:07.910
<v Speaker 1>we're close like nine at night,</v>

262
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.780
<v Speaker 1>so we'd have to wait till the next day at four o'clock to have the next meal.</v>

263
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

264
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.660
<v Speaker 1>So it was bottled water,</v>

265
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

266
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:16.244
<v Speaker 1>and that was it.</v>

267
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Bottled water and pasta once a day.</v>

268
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.490
<v Speaker 1>What's the name of it was called the good life.</v>

269
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.280
<v Speaker 1>It never came out.</v>

270
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.113
<v Speaker 1>Ah.</v>

271
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.451
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

272
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:25.010
<v Speaker 1>and I always talked to frank Stallone.</v>

273
00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:28.040
<v Speaker 1>He always says he should release like pieces of it on the Internet.</v>

274
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

275
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.890
<v Speaker 1>It was the craziest thing,</v>

276
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.470
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

277
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.303
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

278
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.190
<v Speaker 1>I wanted it to be a comedy.</v>

279
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Frank Stallone wanted it to be a drama,</v>

280
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

281
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:38.730
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

282
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:39.400
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

283
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:39.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

284
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.000
<v Speaker 1>I would tell the producers,</v>

285
00:07:41.001 --> 00:07:41.361
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

286
00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:41.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

287
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.310
<v Speaker 1>it's really a funny movie,</v>

288
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:44.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

289
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.410
<v Speaker 1>and comedy cells.</v>

290
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.780
<v Speaker 1>So when frank would do a scene,</v>

291
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.330
<v Speaker 1>he'd come over to the director and go,</v>

292
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

293
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:51.771
<v Speaker 1>how was that?</v>

294
00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:52.400
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

295
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:52.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

296
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 1>it was very dramatic,</v>

297
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.633
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

298
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.300
<v Speaker 1>and he's gone,</v>

299
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.451
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

300
00:07:56.451 --> 00:07:57.590
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be a drama.</v>

301
00:07:57.591 --> 00:07:58.011
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

302
00:07:58.011 --> 00:07:58.461
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

303
00:07:58.461 --> 00:07:59.780
<v Speaker 1>I think it should be funnier.</v>

304
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:00.780
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

305
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.050
<v Speaker 1>put the movies a fucking drama.</v>

306
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:03.711
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

307
00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:04.930
<v Speaker 1>so he was flipping out it.</v>

308
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.440
<v Speaker 1>We had a big fight over that movie.</v>

309
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:07.303
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

310
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.310
<v Speaker 1>but the producers now wanted to just be like a comedy.</v>

311
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Dennis Hopper's in it.</v>

312
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.710
<v Speaker 1>It was supposed to be,</v>

313
00:08:12.711 --> 00:08:13.640
<v Speaker 1>you know what it was supposed to be.</v>

314
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.670
<v Speaker 1>It was supposed to be Goodfellas on a golf course.</v>

315
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:17.990
<v Speaker 1>So Dennis Hopper,</v>

316
00:08:17.991 --> 00:08:18.441
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

317
00:08:18.441 --> 00:08:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Dennis Hopper was in it,</v>

318
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.750
<v Speaker 1>but it was filming.</v>

319
00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:21.584
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

320
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Can you find it anywhere?</v>

321
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:24.920
<v Speaker 1>It's snow would be,</v>

322
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:25.820
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't.</v>

323
00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:26.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

324
00:08:26.011 --> 00:08:26.844
<v Speaker 1>It's not online,</v>

325
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.040
<v Speaker 1>but no one put it online.</v>

326
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.560
<v Speaker 1>But David Carradine was in it too.</v>

327
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

328
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.430
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people were in is really the Angelos alone,</v>

329
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:34.850
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

330
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

331
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.530
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

332
00:08:36.531 --> 00:08:37.400
<v Speaker 1>He didn't never made it.</v>

333
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.430
<v Speaker 1>You should never know shit to Netflix or something like that.</v>

334
00:08:40.431 --> 00:08:40.890
<v Speaker 1>You make,</v>

335
00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:41.510
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

336
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:41.691
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

337
00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:42.890
<v Speaker 1>it's not my movie to sell,</v>

338
00:08:42.891 --> 00:08:44.120
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

339
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.930
<v Speaker 1>it just wound up the whole time in Ixtapa was drama,</v>

340
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:48.810
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

341
00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.140
<v Speaker 1>But the movie's hysterical.</v>

342
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.063
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

343
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.990
<v Speaker 1>it was just movie sets.</v>

344
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I've only been on one.</v>

345
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:55.770
<v Speaker 1>I've been on,</v>

346
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.920
<v Speaker 1>well to be movie.</v>

347
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.080
<v Speaker 1>But you know what happened?</v>

348
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:03.110
<v Speaker 1>We had a good director at the beginning and then the producer who was an</v>

349
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:08.301
<v Speaker 1>attorney fired the director and he'd decided to direct a no.</v>

350
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.500
<v Speaker 1>So now what happens is,</v>

351
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:12.480
<v Speaker 1>this is where it starts going a little crazy.</v>

352
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

353
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.771
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

354
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:14.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

355
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:14.910
<v Speaker 1>I can't play golf.</v>

356
00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:16.050
<v Speaker 1>I hate fucking golf.</v>

357
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't have patience to hit a one little ball,</v>

358
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:19.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

359
00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:20.370
<v Speaker 1>of course the pork,</v>

360
00:09:20.371 --> 00:09:21.204
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

361
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.223
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

362
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.600
<v Speaker 1>So I wasn't really good at playing the golf,</v>

363
00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:24.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

364
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:26.730
<v Speaker 1>so we would make it that they make fun of me.</v>

365
00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:29.610
<v Speaker 1>But I had some like golf material at the time.</v>

366
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:31.080
<v Speaker 1>We had talked about hating golf.</v>

367
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.670
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

368
00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:33.504
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

369
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:38.550
<v Speaker 1>this new director makes me do some of that material on like the master shot,</v>

370
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.540
<v Speaker 1>like on a crane.</v>

371
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:40.711
<v Speaker 1>So he goes,</v>

372
00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:42.840
<v Speaker 1>I want you to do that monologue every time,</v>

373
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:43.951
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

374
00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:44.550
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

375
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.701
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

376
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:47.390
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not doing that monologue every time I did a few,</v>

377
00:09:47.391 --> 00:09:52.020
<v Speaker 1>cause you asked me to do it in the mass to shut just so he gets them talking and</v>

378
00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:52.530
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

379
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:52.741
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

380
00:09:52.741 --> 00:09:53.360
<v Speaker 1>I want you to do it.</v>

381
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:53.581
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

382
00:09:53.581 --> 00:09:55.140
<v Speaker 1>that's my material from my act.</v>

383
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it.</v>

384
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.260
<v Speaker 1>You know you're not paying me for it all year.</v>

385
00:09:58.830 --> 00:09:59.520
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

386
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.510
<v Speaker 1>you'll do what I say.</v>

387
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:02.250
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm not going to do a fucking thing.</v>

388
00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:03.084
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

389
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.670
<v Speaker 1>I go and don't ever tell me what to do again.</v>

390
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Ever in front of the camera.</v>

391
00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Which Dom Barris is falling down laughing as he's making a little documentary</v>

392
00:10:12.181 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Speaker 1>movie with my camera,</v>

393
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.600
<v Speaker 1>because I was always filming.</v>

394
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:14.941
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

395
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:15.751
<v Speaker 1>He literally say,</v>

396
00:10:15.751 --> 00:10:16.740
<v Speaker 1>you'll do as I say,</v>

397
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:17.161
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

398
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:18.000
<v Speaker 1>whoever lands.</v>

399
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:18.900
<v Speaker 1>And he goes and he,</v>

400
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:19.560
<v Speaker 1>and he says,</v>

401
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.341
<v Speaker 1>if you don't like it,</v>

402
00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:21.174
<v Speaker 1>you could leave.</v>

403
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:21.900
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

404
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.231
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

405
00:10:22.231 --> 00:10:22.681
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave.</v>

406
00:10:22.681 --> 00:10:23.281
<v Speaker 1>I go done.</v>

407
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:23.761
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>

408
00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:24.660

<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

413
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:26.491
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

414
00:10:26.491 --> 00:10:26.671
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

415

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:28.290
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You don't want me in the movie,</v>

420
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:35.310
<v Speaker 1>if I don't want to do my own material and I don't want to do it,</v>

421
00:10:35.311 --> 00:10:38.880
<v Speaker 1>so don't fucking tell me what to do and I'll stay and that's it.</v>

422
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:39.930
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

423
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.120
<v Speaker 1>And what don loved is,</v>

424
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:43.800
<v Speaker 1>no matter what the guy did,</v>

425
00:10:43.801 --> 00:10:44.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

426
00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:45.330
<v Speaker 1>for his main profession,</v>

427
00:10:45.331 --> 00:10:46.164
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

428
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:47.750
<v Speaker 1>you're telling you director,</v>

429
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.850
<v Speaker 1>the guy that's supposed to tell you what to do,</v>

430
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.220
<v Speaker 1>don't ever tell me what to do again,</v>

431
00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:57.300
<v Speaker 1>but that's his only job right now is telling you what to do.</v>

432
00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:57.841
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

433
00:10:57.841 --> 00:10:58.021
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

434
00:10:58.021 --> 00:10:58.851
<v Speaker 1>but you heard what?</v>

435
00:10:58.851 --> 00:10:59.880
<v Speaker 1>When went down,</v>

436
00:10:59.881 --> 00:11:00.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

437
00:11:00.121 --> 00:11:01.140
<v Speaker 1>and he agreed with it.</v>

438
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.350
<v Speaker 1>And then I decided to direct part of the special,</v>

439
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.330
<v Speaker 1>it's not the special the movie.</v>

440
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:07.620
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

446
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:15.630
<v Speaker 1>he had a funny character.</v>

447
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:20.630
<v Speaker 1>He was very low keyed with a sombrero cause it was Mexico and it was always hot.</v>

448
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.291
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

451
00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:24.564
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

452
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

453
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:27.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

454
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.223
<v Speaker 1>and I go,</v>

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.090
<v Speaker 1>do you want me to set the shot up?</v>

456
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:31.500
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

457
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.400
<v Speaker 1>what'd you please?</v>

458
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.530
<v Speaker 1>This is the director now.</v>

459
00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:35.580
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

460
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:36.413
<v Speaker 1>just tapped out.</v>

461
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:36.960
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

462
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.450
<v Speaker 1>I just want to finish the movie and go home.</v>

463
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's how he would talk.</v>

464
00:11:40.891 --> 00:11:42.330
<v Speaker 1>That's like an impression of the guy.</v>

465
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:44.490
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm directing,</v>

466
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm directing the movie.</v>

467
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.390
<v Speaker 1>And that was a scene I directed.</v>

468
00:11:48.391 --> 00:11:53.160
<v Speaker 1>This was great because I was like a little at wool with frank stuff at the time</v>

469
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.003
<v Speaker 1>on the set.</v>

470
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.500
<v Speaker 1>So I was shooting a scene that I needed dawn Barris for and now I decided to</v>

471
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:00.071
<v Speaker 1>club soda.</v>

472
00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Kenny will be in the movie also,</v>

473
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:02.830
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

474
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:07.830
<v Speaker 1>So frank is shooting a scene where he's like playing a guitar in his underwear,</v>

475
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:12.010
<v Speaker 1>talking to some girl he was with in bed the night before.</v>

476
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.280
<v Speaker 1>So I come in there and I take the sound guys,</v>

477
00:12:15.281 --> 00:12:15.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

478
00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:16.783
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

479
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.830
<v Speaker 1>just come with me.</v>

480
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.350
<v Speaker 1>So now I get the sound guy.</v>

481
00:12:20.351 --> 00:12:24.130
<v Speaker 1>So he winds up shooting this whole scene that he's doing and he doesn't know,</v>

482
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:25.300
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have sound.</v>

483
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.790
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden coming from this house,</v>

484
00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:29.140
<v Speaker 1>you hear him screaming,</v>

485
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.720
<v Speaker 1>he talked the fucking sound,</v>

486
00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:32.554
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

487
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.790
<v Speaker 1>you made me do all these takes and we don't even have fucking sound.</v>

488
00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.310
<v Speaker 1>And then the director's going,</v>

489
00:12:39.311 --> 00:12:39.551
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

490
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:41.800
<v Speaker 1>diocese directing a scene right now,</v>

491
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.120
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

492
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:43.571
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

493
00:12:43.571 --> 00:12:46.300
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck is he directing anything?</v>

494
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not his movie to direct.</v>

495
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:48.941
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

496
00:12:48.941 --> 00:12:49.660
<v Speaker 1>people were having,</v>

497
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.640
<v Speaker 1>and then we crashed the golf carts,</v>

498
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.230
<v Speaker 1>which I got in trouble for.</v>

499
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.150
<v Speaker 1>I play chicken with the,</v>

500
00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:55.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

501
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.111
<v Speaker 1>Peter Dobson,</v>

502
00:12:56.111 --> 00:12:56.830
<v Speaker 1>he's an actor.</v>

503
00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:57.500
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

504
00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

505
00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.980
<v Speaker 1>he's been in a lot of stuff anyway,</v>

506
00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:01.870
<v Speaker 1>so it's an Ian Dobson.</v>

507
00:13:01.871 --> 00:13:05.050
<v Speaker 1>We're good friends and decide to play chicken with the golf carts.</v>

508
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.680
<v Speaker 1>And I turn it the last second and my golf cart gets completely destroyed.</v>

509
00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:14.170
<v Speaker 1>And frank goes flying out of it because he's with me going,</v>

510
00:13:14.171 --> 00:13:15.240
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing as what?</v>

511
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.610
<v Speaker 1>Going towards each other and I'm going to just stick with me on this.</v>

512
00:13:18.611 --> 00:13:18.851
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

513
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:19.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to stick with you.</v>

514
00:13:19.991 --> 00:13:21.100
<v Speaker 1>Stopped driving,</v>

515
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:21.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

516
00:13:21.761 --> 00:13:23.320
<v Speaker 1>but we wouldn't stop driving.</v>

517
00:13:23.321 --> 00:13:24.770
<v Speaker 1>And I turned and they smash him.</v>

518
00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:25.190
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

519
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:26.160
<v Speaker 1>so now I'm not allowed to.</v>

520
00:13:26.161 --> 00:13:27.640
<v Speaker 1>You play golf cart chicken.</v>

521
00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:27.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

522
00:13:27.881 --> 00:13:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Chicken to see who turns first,</v>

523
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

524
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.820
<v Speaker 1>and then we're having sword fights with the golf clubs.</v>

525
00:13:33.821 --> 00:13:34.091
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

526
00:13:34.091 --> 00:13:35.080
<v Speaker 1>it was ridiculous.</v>

527
00:13:35.081 --> 00:13:36.100
<v Speaker 1>What was going on.</v>

528
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:36.691
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

529
00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Beverly Deangelo's in the movie,</v>

530
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:39.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

531
00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Frank Pash is in the move towards your war with a frank Stallone.</v>

532
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:43.370
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

533
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Just that I believe the movie should be a comedy,</v>

534
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:46.810
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

535
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:51.750
<v Speaker 1>So I started doing like an impression of him on screen goes,</v>

536
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.870
<v Speaker 1>I could do him really well the way he stands and Oh,</v>

537
00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:55.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

538
00:13:55.181 --> 00:13:57.100
<v Speaker 1>so now he sees the final cut and he goes,</v>

539
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.260
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing behind me?</v>

540
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

541
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.020
<v Speaker 1>I go an impression of you.</v>

542
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:02.891
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

543
00:14:02.891 --> 00:14:04.930
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to be doing an impression of me.</v>

544
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.221
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

545
00:14:05.221 --> 00:14:07.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm the leader of the gang I got,</v>

546
00:14:07.661 --> 00:14:08.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's funny.</v>

547
00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:10.420
<v Speaker 1>And he goes to put the movie's not funny,</v>

548
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:11.291
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

549
00:14:11.291 --> 00:14:13.250
<v Speaker 1>And of course we all made up after them,</v>

550
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:13.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

551
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.440
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

552
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

553
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:15.940
<v Speaker 1>never came out,</v>

554
00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:17.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

555
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.080

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Make up with Paul.</v>

557
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.840
<v Speaker 1>You may not put that guy.</v>

558
00:14:19.841 --> 00:14:20.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

559
00:14:20.081 --> 00:14:20.741
<v Speaker 1>Because it's,</v>

560
00:14:20.741 --> 00:14:22.210
<v Speaker 1>it's more fun to have your friends.</v>

561
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to make them laugh about it?</v>

562
00:14:23.621 --> 00:14:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
