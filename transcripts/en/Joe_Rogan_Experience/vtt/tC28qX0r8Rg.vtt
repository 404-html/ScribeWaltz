<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

53
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Tatum,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Tatum O'Neal or whatever the guy's name is.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This guy.</v>

00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:28.710
<v Speaker 1>I hung out with him in Vegas for a weekend and women literally stopped just</v>

62
00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:30.780
<v Speaker 1>obviating and his presence and he's a great guy.</v>

63
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.643
<v Speaker 1>They must panic.</v>

64
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.570
<v Speaker 1>There's certain types of comedy where,</v>

65
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:33.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:01:33.931 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>you and I were talking also about how,</v>

67
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>what a privilege it is to feel it,</v>

68
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:41.370
<v Speaker 1>to be a headliner and to be somebody who gets to perform all of the country.</v>

69
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.130
<v Speaker 1>And like sometimes I look at it,</v>

70
00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>I was in Miami and Fort Lauderdale and I just,</v>

71
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>

73
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.450
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

74
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>I got at one point,</v>

75
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:50.090
<v Speaker 1>I just had them going pretty strong and I just looked at it.</v>

76
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.341
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

77
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>I felt like the luckiest human being in the fucking world.</v>

78
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:57.741
<v Speaker 1>That's why when I watch Matt Mcconahey fucking Magic Mike and he's fucking</v>

79
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.440
<v Speaker 1>leather chest girdle and it's fucking hot pants and any and he's coming off</v>

80
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>

81
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.970
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

82
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

83
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.250

85
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:11.430
<v Speaker 1>You fucking idiot.</v>

86
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't jump off stage like I just did an hour and a half and crush.</v>

87
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Somebody hugged me hard so I can kiss your mouth.</v>

88
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>This animosity,</v>

89
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm attracted to him.</v>

90
00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:21.114
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

91
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

92
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.351
<v Speaker 1>I hate him.</v>

93
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:22.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean I hate him.</v>

94
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:23.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean I hate him.</v>

95
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

96
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.390
<v Speaker 1>I was just thinking about how you know,</v>

97
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.940
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

98
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.780
<v Speaker 1>you're an actor and you,</v>

99
00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:30.030
<v Speaker 1>you have five scenes in a movie and be like,</v>

100
00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:30.361
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

101
00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:31.260
<v Speaker 1>you were great in that movie.</v>

102
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.250
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

103
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.720
<v Speaker 1>collectively are probably doing 10 or 15 minutes of actual activity.</v>

104
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.010
<v Speaker 1>Whereas when you do stand up,</v>

105
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 1>you're up there for,</v>

106
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

107
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Speaker 1>it's just a different,</v>

108
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.280
<v Speaker 1>it's just a different thing.</v>

109
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.851
<v Speaker 1>It feels,</v>

110
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:42.530
<v Speaker 1>it feels a little,</v>

111
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.370
<v Speaker 1>why would you care though that he wants to be?</v>

112
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Cause I mean him so much and as a matter what's going on now.</v>

113
00:02:48.931 --> 00:02:50.190
<v Speaker 1>I just saw the movie and I was just,</v>

114
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:50.911
<v Speaker 1>I was just looking at,</v>

115
00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:51.210

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

149
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:30.641
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

150
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:30.731
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

151
00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>because I wanted to know myself more and more.</v>

152
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Although I thought the movie was good and I liked that.</v>

153
00:03:34.561 --> 00:03:35.140
<v Speaker 1>I liked,</v>

154
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I liked Channing Tatum.</v>

155
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean I had my hands.</v>

156
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 1>That movie looks so gay that I was flipping through the channels.</v>

157
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.230
<v Speaker 1>I was flipping through the channels and I saw it.</v>

158
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 1>It popped up and I went,</v>

159
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.801
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

160
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:46.420
<v Speaker 1>change a quick like,</v>

161
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:48.740
<v Speaker 1>you know how you're flipping through like you have preview,</v>

162
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 1>next preview.</v>

163
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.330
<v Speaker 1>I get in a hotel,</v>

164
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 1>it was chilling at a hotel and there's like,</v>

165
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.011
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

166
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:54.790
<v Speaker 1>this is so gay.</v>

167
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.623
<v Speaker 1>I can get it off.</v>

168
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Like dudes were like s gyrating back and forth.</v>

169
00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Which by the way,</v>

170
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't think women like that.</v>

171
00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 1>I think that motion is really just isolated.</v>

172
00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Someone Riding Dicks.</v>

173
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.341
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that,</v>

174
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:09.160
<v Speaker 1>I know gyrating like the way a guy's doing it.</v>

175
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Women like the rusting,</v>

176
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:11.750
<v Speaker 1>they like to get fucked.</v>

177
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

178
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.131
<v Speaker 1>they want you,</v>

179
00:04:13.131 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>you're are you Dick Riding circled man.</v>

180
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.401
<v Speaker 1>Dick Riding,</v>

181
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 1>sweaty circle moon.</v>

182
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Makani he's doing,</v>

183
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 1>he's got a fucking a leather thong and he's doing back bends and shaving and,</v>

184
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:26.380
<v Speaker 1>but the character I was watching,</v>

185
00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

186
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 1>what bothered me was I was watching,</v>

187
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:28.180
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

188
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

189
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

190
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 1>that's an actor.</v>

191
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.230
<v Speaker 1>If I took that role there,</v>

192
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.871
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot.</v>

193
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:32.621
<v Speaker 1>I do have that role.</v>

194
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

195
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't because there's not a lot to do like he played at just one note.</v>

196
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:37.370
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up bitch.</v>

197
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.020
<v Speaker 1>She would take that role on a god heart.</v>

198
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.170
<v Speaker 1>You and Channing Tatum and your underwear can,</v>

199
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 1>that guy would be your boyfriend.</v>

200
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 1>He be carrying around like he was crossing the,</v>

201
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 1>the wedding nuptials I would look like I have fucking rickets next to that guy,</v>

202
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:50.150
<v Speaker 1>so I don't want to deal with,</v>

203
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.831
<v Speaker 1>do the movie with him.</v>

204
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:50.961
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

205
00:04:50.961 --> 00:04:51.310
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

206
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.940
<v Speaker 1>you would do it.</v>

207
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 1>So shut the fuck up.</v>

208
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 1>You've given Matthew Mcconaughey a hard time and you're doing the movie.</v>

209
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he just wanted to meet Jenny channel to</v>

210
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Matthew.</v>

211
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.173
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

212
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to put you down.</v>

213
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.090
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of like a nice enough guy.</v>

214
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.310
<v Speaker 1>I hear he's a very nice guy.</v>

215
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

216
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:07.151
<v Speaker 1>Here's the Nice car.</v>

217
00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:09.370
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean he's not really vain and not an annoying,</v>

218
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:10.031
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

219
00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:10.451
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

220
00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:11.284
<v Speaker 1>he's playing a part.</v>

221
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.680
<v Speaker 1>How could you like if you judged me based on the movies,</v>

222
00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:14.291
<v Speaker 1>zookeeper,</v>

223
00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 1>you'd push ups by the fucking conveyance in Malibu.</v>

224
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.410
<v Speaker 1>He does with his shirt off.</v>

225
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:20.531
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

226
00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:20.920
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

227
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.240
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

228
00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:25.210
<v Speaker 1>If I see you and you're doing pushups in front of the pavilion in Malibu,</v>

229
00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:26.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take your back.</v>

230
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.153
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

231
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take you back and I'm going to get their hooks in my fryer.</v>

232
00:05:29.931 --> 00:05:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Just kick him in the ribs.</v>

233
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to hold.</v>

234
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.560
<v Speaker 1>He can scream all you want.</v>

235
00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:33.830
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't have been doing pushups.</v>

236
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Do that with a knapsack on,</v>

237
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:37.510
<v Speaker 1>with a knapsack on and a Bandana.</v>

238
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Wah Wah tourists take pictures of you.</v>

239
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.083
<v Speaker 1>Is that what he was doing?</v>

240
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.530
<v Speaker 1>That annoys me.</v>

241
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.300
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to be really fit for this movie.</v>

242
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was like something he was white working on.</v>

243
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of exhibitionist could he become because he was playing a part in</v>

244
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:49.841
<v Speaker 1>a movie,</v>

245
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:50.260
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

246
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.891
<v Speaker 1>Did you murder?</v>

247
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:52.030
<v Speaker 1>He could look,</v>

248
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:52.864
<v Speaker 1>think about liquid.</v>

249
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.580
<v Speaker 1>What's his name does when he does.</v>

250
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

251
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

252
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.021
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Day Lewis,</v>

253
00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:57.350
<v Speaker 1>when he gets immersed in a role,</v>

254
00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's unbelievably immersive.</v>

255
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's where Matthew mcconaughey was done.</v>

256
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:01.630
<v Speaker 1>It was just being a douchebag.</v>

257
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.770
<v Speaker 1>He's playing a Douche bag in the movie man.</v>

258
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:04.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's douchebag activity.</v>

259
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Have the role was in so much of a Douche bag.</v>

260
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:07.281
<v Speaker 1>The role was more of a,</v>

261
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 1>just think he's supposed to be the club owner,</v>

262
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 1>but you'll see what I mean.</v>

263
00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Would it be okay if he did pushups in a way,</v>

264
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.690
<v Speaker 1>in a place where nobody could say like say if it was like his,</v>

265
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.540
<v Speaker 1>there was like some grass in front of his car and nobody could see and he</v>

266
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:18.620
<v Speaker 1>dropped down for a quick 15.</v>

267
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.483
<v Speaker 1>Here's the box.</v>

268
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.363
<v Speaker 1>That's what bothers me.</v>

269
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.171
<v Speaker 1>There I am.</v>

270
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 1>And here's what bothers me.</v>

271
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.370
<v Speaker 1>If you work out just for the sake of vanity to and then,</v>

272
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:25.740
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

273
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.770
<v Speaker 1>and then when I,</v>

274
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>when I see what you're doing is just,</v>

275
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 1>you're just sculpting for,</v>

276
00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 1>for to be a peacock.</v>

277
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:32.531
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

278
00:06:32.531 --> 00:06:32.661
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

279
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:33.171
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

280
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 1>I get staying in shape and there's something about it.</v>

281
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 1>If it's not for something functional,</v>

282
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.170
<v Speaker 1>it was not for something like that you're doing.</v>

283
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 1>I immediately,</v>

284
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying,</v>

285
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 1>you can do it.</v>

286
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.883
<v Speaker 1>You're not my friend.</v>

287
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:43.251
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

288
00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:44.084
<v Speaker 1>I said.</v>

289
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.851
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

290
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:50.240
<v Speaker 1>What about a guy who's just doing like bench presses and curls never touches the</v>

291
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:50.721
<v Speaker 1>legs.</v>

292
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Just wants to look good in a tight shirt,</v>

293
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.151
<v Speaker 1>but it he's doing it.</v>

294
00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:53.800
<v Speaker 1>You know what you know?</v>

295
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.680
<v Speaker 1>You know why I like that?</v>

296
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.831
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

297
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:55.670
<v Speaker 1>I've got no problem with that.</v>

298
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 1>He's doing it so we can go out and get laid on a Saturday night.</v>

299
00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Fucking,</v>

300
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Hey God bless you.</v>

301
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.801
<v Speaker 1>What do you think Nancy?</v>

302
00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 1>What kind of haze doing when he's wearing leather underwear doing that so he can</v>

303
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:08.840
<v Speaker 1>fucking get the the dailies and jerk off to himself.</v>

304
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 1>That's why he's fucking doing it and there's a difference.</v>

305
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.640
<v Speaker 1>I see Matt mcconahey doing a role like that and Magic Mike all,</v>

306
00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing something masturbatory I watched Channing Tatum.</v>

307
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.690
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to do something.</v>

308
00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:23.450
<v Speaker 1>He's actually playing a character who's fucking conflicted about being a 30 year</v>

309
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:24.830
<v Speaker 1>old stripper and it's fucking great.</v>

310
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Mcconahey is is.</v>

311
00:07:26.771 --> 00:07:29.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a masturbatory performance.</v>

312
00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:30.500
<v Speaker 1>He's watching himself.</v>

313
00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:32.090
<v Speaker 1>He's not trying to do anything.</v>

314
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.380
<v Speaker 1>He's not trying to express anything that's he's trying to play.</v>

315
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean the guy has shown a pretty broad range of gray in the world.</v>

316
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

317
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Miriam,</v>

318
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to marry him,</v>

319
00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:46.680
<v Speaker 1>but it was really good and contact the house going on.</v>

320
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.450
<v Speaker 1>He was all right.</v>

321
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.680
<v Speaker 1>He was good in contact.</v>

322
00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:49.281
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed him.</v>

323
00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:51.710
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was sensitive without town.</v>

324
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:54.470
<v Speaker 1>Seemed like the type of guy that would fall in love with Jodie foster.</v>

325
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.670
<v Speaker 1>That was a long time ago.</v>

326
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

327
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.140
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck?</v>

328
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't you watch that?</v>

329
00:07:58.101 --> 00:07:59.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened to you.</v>

330
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:00.680
<v Speaker 1>I was robbed on your head.</v>

331
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Is Cal on Mrs Kellen Warner to watch and he's blaming it on wow.</v>

332
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:06.861
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

333
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.600
<v Speaker 1>I might have to get high and watch it,</v>

334
00:08:08.601 --> 00:08:09.980
<v Speaker 1>but I'll probably get really scared.</v>

335
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably have to get my blankie.</v>

336
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:15.130
<v Speaker 1>You get a little jealous and you better be inside of a pussy when you watch it</v>

337
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.153
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

338
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that kind of stamina or desire of,</v>

339
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:20.940
<v Speaker 1>I was about sex or will.</v>

340
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.980
<v Speaker 1>That's why you need to give a fuck.</v>

341
00:08:21.981 --> 00:08:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I got tricked early on in life and I figured it out.</v>

342
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm,</v>

343
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.031
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine.</v>

344
00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Just beaten off and then going about my business all mine.</v>
