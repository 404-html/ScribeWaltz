<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

11
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>if you're listening to this for the first time,</v>

12
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.680
<v Speaker 1>this is what's called a fight companion podcast.</v>

13
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:18.660
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is we don't really talk about anything that's going to</v>

14
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:20.610
<v Speaker 1>expand your mind or if we do,</v>

15
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:21.750
<v Speaker 1>it's totally by accident.</v>

16
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

17
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>We don't talk about,</v>

18
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.573
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.670

<v Speaker 1>Tudes</v>

24
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.470
<v Speaker 1>as long as it was like medium,</v>

25
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:38.520
<v Speaker 1>so I can bust out of it.</v>

26
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.450
<v Speaker 1>We might lead a little gay if we all got him on what I'm saying to my party.</v>

27
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.890
<v Speaker 1>We're trying hard.</v>

28
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.400
<v Speaker 1>we can't wait.</v>

30
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.590
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go into this podcast.</v>

31
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>What we're going to do is we're gonna Watch some old school fights,</v>

32
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.370
<v Speaker 1>but we can't,</v>

33
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>we can't really talk about fights until we talk about our last podcast together</v>

35
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>because it kind of became the biggest podcast in the history of MMA.</v>

36
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 1>How many you can take,</v>

37
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker 1>you can take kind of out of that sentence.</v>

38
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:01.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 1>It's off the charts off the charts,</v>

40
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

41
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not ours.</v>

42
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.490
<v Speaker 1>It's theirs.</v>

43
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

44
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.661
<v Speaker 1>it's a fighter.</v>

45
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:07.111
<v Speaker 1>And the kid,</v>

46
00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:07.944
<v Speaker 1>these fucking,</v>

47
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.783
<v Speaker 1>oh</v>

48
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.813
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

49
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 1>we just did in his studio.</v>

50
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>We had Joe on and this studio.</v>

51
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.000
<v Speaker 1>But your podcast.</v>

52
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.331
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

53
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:19.010
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

54
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.843
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

55
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>and so Joe kind of spoke,</v>

56
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 1>his mind would just sit there and neither one of us actually.</v>

57
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 1>And then it's just a chair.</v>

59
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>She watched it.</v>

60
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.670
<v Speaker 1>I watched it but youtube and I thought the whole time it was jre probably that</v>

61
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.161
<v Speaker 1>whole tickets.</v>

62
00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:38.010
<v Speaker 1>It's the same studio.</v>

63
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:39.410
<v Speaker 1>That's all I was sitting in there.</v>

64
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>It would look like the same show.</v>

65
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.590
<v Speaker 1>You can just do it.</v>

66
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Be a red behind me instead of a,</v>

67
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.501
<v Speaker 1>if you yeah,</v>

68
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Brian behind there you would go,</v>

69
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:45.151
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

70
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:45.984
<v Speaker 1>The what the fuck?</v>

71
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

72
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.810
<v Speaker 1>now and he's all concerned with them.</v>

73
00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:52.811
<v Speaker 1>Like just Eddie Bravo might be a little high talk shit could go off the rails.</v>

74
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 1>All I wanted to know is the views,</v>

75
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.540
<v Speaker 1>what kind of feature to the New Yorker magazine and it got all this stuff.</v>

76
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.500
<v Speaker 1>We're number one on,</v>

77
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.250
<v Speaker 1>on every chart on the dunes.</v>

78
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>So it was a blessing in disguise.</v>

79
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.540
<v Speaker 1>But it's huge though.</v>

80
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.080
<v Speaker 1>It's huge.</v>

81
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.040
<v Speaker 1>It was great for Brian Right now.</v>

82
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.711
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>

83
00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>It was great for your podcast and in a lot of ways it's an important</v>

84
00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:25.030
<v Speaker 1>conversation that needs to be had about MMA and about fighting gree.</v>

85
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Part of the issue with it was having it having a really honest conversation in</v>

86
00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:31.020
<v Speaker 1>front of the whole world.</v>

87
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the issue with it.</v>

88
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>If I could do it again,</v>

89
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>I definitely wouldn't have done that.</v>

90
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.583
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

91
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.730
<v Speaker 1>the good part about doing that is that it gets this conversation out there.</v>

92
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.280
<v Speaker 1>The bad part about doing that is you took a lot of heat and I,</v>

93
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.460
<v Speaker 1>I feel real bad for that.</v>

94
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.490
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I really fucked up for that and I didn't go into that and tending to</v>

95
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>like approach it like that.</v>

96
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>But it seemed like when we started talking I started worried</v>

97
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.220
<v Speaker 2>more worried that your perception of like how the fight went down and the future</v>

98
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 2>and what's going on as far as like the amount of damage that you've taken is</v>

99
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 2>very different than how I see it and how a lot of other people see it.</v>

100
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's a certain number that every fighter has,</v>

101
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

102
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 2>like a certain amount of times they can get hit a certain amount of concussions</v>

103
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:25.624
<v Speaker 2>they could face.</v>

104
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 2>And if I don't know a guy and I see that,</v>

105
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 2>I just know,</v>

106
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:32.351
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

107
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 2>this guy's Chiney,</v>

108
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

109
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 2>and I've called a lot of fights like that.</v>

110
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 2>I've called a lot of fights where I know if this guy gets tagged,</v>

111
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.011
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

112
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 2>his legs are going to go,</v>

113
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.451
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

114
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 2>we've all seen it.</v>

115
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.650
<v Speaker 2>We know and I've called a lot of fights where a guy was a young,</v>

116
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 2>fresh fighter and then I've called the same guy fighting seven,</v>

117
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:50.771
<v Speaker 2>eight years later,</v>

118
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:51.490
<v Speaker 2>six years later,</v>

119
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

120
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 2>And it's a different human being.</v>

121
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

122
00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.400
<v Speaker 2>it's everyone's choice and I'm not trying to impose anyone's choices or my</v>

123
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:02.440
<v Speaker 2>choices on anyone else,</v>

124
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.363
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

125
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 2>there's some things that we've talked about and one of the things that we've</v>

126
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.490
<v Speaker 2>talked about before is you,</v>

127
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 2>you were talking really open and honestly about some of the losses that you had.</v>

128
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 2>And you said,</v>

129
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.500
<v Speaker 2>why didn't anybody tell me?</v>

130
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.450
<v Speaker 2>You kept saying that?</v>

131
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't anybody tell me this kid down?</v>

132
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 2>Tell him,</v>

133
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.140
<v Speaker 2>why didn't anybody tell me I shouldn't be fighting Nogueira my third,</v>

134
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 2>my air time out.</v>

135
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

136
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.530
<v Speaker 2>you were like,</v>

137
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was going to kick his ass.</v>

138
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:31.871
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

139
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

140
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.940
<v Speaker 2>why didn't anybody tell me?</v>

141
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.301
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>

142
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 2>you kept saying that it was funny and you were being self deprecating,</v>

143
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.130
<v Speaker 2>joking around you being self deprecating is very funny.</v>

144
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.740
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that uh,</v>

145
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

146
00:04:46.051 --> 00:04:51.051
<v Speaker 2>you see time and time again about being a fighter is that that same kind of</v>

147
00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:55.600
<v Speaker 2>belief in yourself that makes you want to get into that fucking cage in front of</v>

148
00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:55.931
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

149
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 2>in your underwear and throw bones at some other dude.</v>

150
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.540
<v Speaker 2>That same kind of belief in yourself can get in the way if things aren't going</v>

151
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:04.960
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

152
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.930
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like so many fighters like have this ability to put blinders on and</v>

153
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 2>not see the danger and not see,</v>

154
00:05:11.831 --> 00:05:15.280
<v Speaker 2>do not see what other other people are saying and</v>

155
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.680
<v Speaker 2>is as a person who is around it all the time,</v>

156
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.693
<v Speaker 2>it gets,</v>

157
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 2>it gets super disturbing.</v>

158
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.960
<v Speaker 2>Like you see it time and time again.</v>

159
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.471
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

160
00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:30.310
<v Speaker 2>one of the best things that Dana white ever did in all the Times that I've known</v>

161
00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 2>him is stopped chocolate Dell from fighting.</v>

162
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the best things he ever did because it was,</v>

163
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:39.580
<v Speaker 2>he could have made a fucking fortune off chocolate Dell just pair them up with</v>

164
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:40.660
<v Speaker 2>someone who's not going to knock them out,</v>

165
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 2>pair him up with some dude's going to grapple with them,</v>

166
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 2>pair him up with some dude,</v>

167
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

168
00:05:45.201 --> 00:05:45.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

169
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.180
<v Speaker 2>who's not a,</v>

170
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.530
<v Speaker 2>not a big striker guy,</v>

171
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 2>was a real good wrestler.</v>

172
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

173
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.751
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

174
00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 2>there's guys like that out there.</v>

175
00:05:50.831 --> 00:05:55.780
<v Speaker 2>You should find a comeback opponent for chuck and just make ungodly amounts of</v>

176
00:05:55.781 --> 00:05:56.290
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

177
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Rich Franklin wasn't supposed</v>

178
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 3>to be that dangerous on his feet,</v>

179
00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:01.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

180
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.750
<v Speaker 3>it was like you'd think,</v>

181
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.200
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

182
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 3>chuck can out strike.</v>

183
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.833
<v Speaker 3>Frankly,</v>

184
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 3>that's a good,</v>

185
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:07.723
<v Speaker 3>good fight for sure.</v>

186
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 3>And then what we saw was as rich Franklin dropped him,</v>

187
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:11.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

188
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

189
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.513
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

190
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 3>Joe has seen what he's talking about when he sees,</v>

191
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.680
<v Speaker 3>when he meets all these guys,</v>

192
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:20.630
<v Speaker 3>the new fresh crop from tough,</v>

193
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.871
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

194
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 3>here's the new guys.</v>

195
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.581
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

196
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 3>when I worked with Joe,</v>

197
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.960
<v Speaker 3>I would watch tough cause it was entertaining but also to remember all these new</v>

198
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 3>guys that I'm going to meet backstage,</v>

199
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to meet all these dude I worked with the UFC eight years and you meet</v>

200
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:37.430
<v Speaker 3>this new crop,</v>

201
00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 3>these new fighters and you feel like you have to be on top of everything.</v>

202
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.420
<v Speaker 3>They'll,</v>

203
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.080
<v Speaker 3>it's embarrassing when one of these new guys from the ultimate fighter season</v>

204
00:06:45.081 --> 00:06:45.321
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

205
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 3>season seven,</v>

206
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 3>six today,</v>

207
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.100
<v Speaker 3>they come up to you backstage and you have no idea who they are.</v>

208
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.160
<v Speaker 3>There was a couple of seasons that I missed and it's embarrassing,</v>

209
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:52.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

210
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.690
<v Speaker 3>You see them come and go and Joe really is concerned when,</v>

211
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.831
<v Speaker 3>when he see,</v>

212
00:06:57.831 --> 00:07:00.920
<v Speaker 3>when he meets a guy and they come in and like he sees like,</v>

213
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:01.320
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

214
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.020
<v Speaker 3>how much damage is this going to take?</v>

215
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.760
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

216
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 3>is this guy going to be one of the elite than make it through or is it going to</v>

217
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:10.460
<v Speaker 3>be like most fighters that don't go all the way through and then they go</v>

218
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:11.000
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>

219
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.680
<v Speaker 3>they go through some tough times and all that.</v>

220
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.260
<v Speaker 3>I S I see the exact same thing,</v>

221
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.890
<v Speaker 3>but I look at it just a little bit different because I,</v>

222
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:20.331
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

223
00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:20.811
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

224
00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:21.980
<v Speaker 3>you know it's dangerous.</v>

225
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.731
<v Speaker 3>You're getting in the,</v>

226
00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 3>in the octagon.</v>

227
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:24.920
<v Speaker 3>If you wanna,</v>

228
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 3>if you wanna put your brain in jeopardy,</v>

229
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.850
<v Speaker 3>go for it.</v>

230
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.260
<v Speaker 3>I look at it as why these guys came in and why they got cut.</v>

231
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.120
<v Speaker 3>Like when you look at all these fighters,</v>

232
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:35.451
<v Speaker 3>they get,</v>

233
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:36.260
<v Speaker 3>why did he get cut?</v>

234
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.650
<v Speaker 3>Why did he lose that last fight that got him cut?</v>

235
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm always looking at what,</v>

236
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.340
<v Speaker 3>who's trainers war?</v>

237
00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:44.420
<v Speaker 3>What does training was?</v>

238
00:07:44.421 --> 00:07:46.070
<v Speaker 3>What does Jujitsu was like,</v>

239
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 3>who was he training with his wrestling and as for investing and striking and</v>

240
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:50.900
<v Speaker 3>what went wrong there.</v>

241
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.900
<v Speaker 3>And cause most people that come into the UFC,</v>

242
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.150
<v Speaker 3>Devin even get to the main card.</v>

243
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:57.391
<v Speaker 3>Most people that are,</v>

244
00:07:57.391 --> 00:07:57.650
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

245
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.160
<v Speaker 3>aren't even aware of these hundreds of fighters that come through never make it</v>

246
00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:02.540
<v Speaker 3>to the main card and they're gone.</v>

247
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:04.040
<v Speaker 3>They're cut you out.</v>

248
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.360
<v Speaker 3>You lose two fights in a row.</v>

249
00:08:05.361 --> 00:08:07.400
<v Speaker 3>In the prelims they're going to cut you generally.</v>

250
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:08.030
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

251
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:12.410
<v Speaker 3>But you know how many wins you have to line up in a road to get to the main</v>

252
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:12.681
<v Speaker 3>card,</v>

253
00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:16.100
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're under one 70 you have to put like eight or nine wins</v>

254
00:08:16.101 --> 00:08:18.140
<v Speaker 3>together before it's like,</v>

255
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.220
<v Speaker 3>it's like getting,</v>

256
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:20.900
<v Speaker 3>getting into the UFC,</v>

257
00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:25.901
<v Speaker 3>getting signed by the UFC is easier than going from the prelims to the main guy.</v>

258
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:27.880
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] back.</v>

259
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.820
<v Speaker 3>The easy part happened,</v>

260
00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:30.080
<v Speaker 3>you got signed with UFC,</v>

261
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.490
<v Speaker 3>here comes the hard part.</v>

262
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:32.870
<v Speaker 3>Let's see you last,</v>

263
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:33.570
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say it to</v>

264
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.110
<v Speaker 4>piggyback on that and I think what you are saying and what I took away from it</v>

265
00:08:37.111 --> 00:08:39.060
<v Speaker 4>was was the fact that look,</v>

266
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.850
<v Speaker 4>to get to the belt,</v>

267
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:46.500
<v Speaker 4>you are going to have to take a certain number of fights and just because of the</v>

268
00:08:46.501 --> 00:08:47.610
<v Speaker 4>way this sport is,</v>

269
00:08:47.611 --> 00:08:49.800
<v Speaker 4>you're going to take damage no matter who you are.</v>

270
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.880
<v Speaker 4>And the question is,</v>

271
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.080
<v Speaker 4>is it worth it?</v>

272
00:08:52.081 --> 00:08:53.670
<v Speaker 4>And you were speaking specifically to Brenton,</v>

273
00:08:53.671 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 4>is it worth it to go through that</v>

274
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.993
<v Speaker 2>journey,</v>

275
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:01.980
<v Speaker 2>go through that journey and possibly do real damage to yourself when there's a</v>

276
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:03.620
<v Speaker 2>bridge to cross that and,</v>

277
00:09:03.621 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 2>and I that I took.</v>

278
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:07.380
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's a question that every fighter has to ask themselves.</v>

279
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

280
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.220
<v Speaker 2>and I think it requires being very honest with yourself.</v>

281
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.230
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of what I,</v>

282
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:14.190
<v Speaker 2>that's what I,</v>

283
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:18.240
<v Speaker 2>why I thought the conversation was very relevant to anybody who is in,</v>

284
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.710
<v Speaker 2>in combat sports.</v>

285
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.570
<v Speaker 2>Look at your look at your brain this way.</v>

286
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

287
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Pretend your brain is a rock,</v>

288
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.260
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to carve a sculpture of.</v>

289
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:27.383
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

290
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.573
<v Speaker 2>And you're chipping.</v>

291
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.330
<v Speaker 2>You want to do,</v>

292
00:09:30.331 --> 00:09:34.380
<v Speaker 2>if you have one sculpture that you can make with your whole life with this</v>

293
00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:35.100
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>

294
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.560
<v Speaker 2>you want to make the very best sculpture possible.</v>

295
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.150
<v Speaker 2>You can't chip too much shit away from it and then try to put rock back on.</v>

296
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.050
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work.</v>

297
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.290
<v Speaker 2>You only have a certain amount of rock to work with.</v>

298
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.310
<v Speaker 2>And I look at fighting in the same way.</v>

299
00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:55.311
<v Speaker 2>You have a certain amount of brain that you could take damage with before you,</v>

300
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.900
<v Speaker 2>you start seeing weird shit with guys.</v>

301
00:09:57.901 --> 00:10:00.900
<v Speaker 2>You start seeing guys get knocked out by punches.</v>

302
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:01.800
<v Speaker 2>It looked like nothing.</v>

303
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.750
<v Speaker 2>You start seeing guys,</v>

304
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:04.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

305
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.330
<v Speaker 2>just a normal shot that they would have taken.</v>

306
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:08.910
<v Speaker 2>You saw this with chuck in his early career.</v>

307
00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:11.970
<v Speaker 2>He would eat nothing like candy and just blast you right in the face.</v>

308
00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:12.804
<v Speaker 2>Like it was nothing.</v>

309
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:17.280
<v Speaker 2>It was very demoralizing when guys would fight chuck cause they would clip him</v>

310
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.520
<v Speaker 2>right in the Chin and he would just fucking break your face in.</v>

311
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean he just was so tough,</v>

312
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.180
<v Speaker 2>so tough and so mean.</v>

313
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.050
<v Speaker 2>You know when chuck,</v>

314
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:28.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a very nice guy but when he's competing he was just for Rosha and he</v>

315
00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:32.270
<v Speaker 2>was also known for having any credible chin.</v>

316
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.310
<v Speaker 2>Incredible Chicken Club,</v>

317
00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:33.621
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

318
00:10:33.621 --> 00:10:38.610
<v Speaker 2>and he went from having one of the best chins in the game and we saw it to man.</v>

319
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.770
<v Speaker 2>He went through what most fighters go through.</v>

320
00:10:40.771 --> 00:10:41.910
<v Speaker 2>A lot of fighters,</v>

321
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.130
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

322
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:46.500
<v Speaker 2>they go through their career and they try to piece things together as it goes</v>

323
00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:46.890
<v Speaker 2>along.</v>

324
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:47.490
<v Speaker 2>Try to get,</v>

325
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:47.970
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

326
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:48.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

327
00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:49.050
<v Speaker 2>maybe I should,</v>

328
00:10:49.051 --> 00:10:49.471
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

329
00:10:49.471 --> 00:10:49.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

330
00:10:49.801 --> 00:10:51.870
<v Speaker 2>work with more wrestlers and maybe I should,</v>

331
00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:52.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

332
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:52.890
<v Speaker 2>work with,</v>

333
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:53.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

334
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.240
<v Speaker 2>good kickbox and coach or it's f I believe.</v>

335
00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.740
<v Speaker 2>I really strongly believe in this,</v>

336
00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:00.300
<v Speaker 2>that in the future we're going to have,</v>

337
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.360
<v Speaker 2>every fighter is going to have like a Matt Hume or for Rasa Hobby or a guy like</v>

338
00:11:05.521 --> 00:11:06.960
<v Speaker 2>that who's like a maestro,</v>

339
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.930
<v Speaker 2>a guy who looks at you actively.</v>

340
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.820
<v Speaker 2>And those are the best guys out in my opinion,</v>

341
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:12.361
<v Speaker 2>those two guys.</v>

342
00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:14.280
<v Speaker 2>There's a few other guys that John Crouch is great at it,</v>

343
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.210
<v Speaker 2>but a guy who looks at you objectively and finds what's wrong,</v>

344
00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:23.211
<v Speaker 2>what's right and moves you into position slowly gets you fights with the right</v>

345
00:11:24.151 --> 00:11:27.570
<v Speaker 2>caliber opponent and gets you to a place where you need to be.</v>

346
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.100
<v Speaker 2>Very few guys have the luxury that very few guys ever get to that.</v>

347
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:37.430
<v Speaker 2>And I think that along the way a lot of guys take some damage in training that's</v>

348
00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:42.180
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary or that they could have avoided they.</v>

349
00:11:42.181 --> 00:11:43.260
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>

350
00:11:43.261 --> 00:11:43.401
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

351
00:11:43.401 --> 00:11:43.651
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

352
00:11:43.651 --> 00:11:45.000
<v Speaker 2>you factor in life,</v>

353
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:45.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

354
00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:48.900
<v Speaker 2>you factor in like with you especially you factor in how many years of football?</v>

355
00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 2>20 how many time do you think you got your bell rang?</v>

356
00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.360
<v Speaker 2>20 years of football.</v>

357
00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.413
<v Speaker 2>Maybe six.</v>

358
00:11:59.020 --> 00:11:59.530
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

359
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:00.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

360
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.750
<v Speaker 2>like flat lined or just,</v>

361
00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:02.340
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

362
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:02.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

363
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:03.763
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

364
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:05.703
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

365
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.870
<v Speaker 2>that's how many times you get hit in the head.</v>

366
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.150
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that goes on in football,</v>

367
00:12:10.151 --> 00:12:13.590
<v Speaker 2>it's really crazy that people don't think about its chest when you're going</v>

368
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:14.021
<v Speaker 2>chat.</v>

369
00:12:14.021 --> 00:12:15.550
<v Speaker 2>When you get hit in the chest,</v>

370
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.400
<v Speaker 2>it seems like an impact that's just on your chest,</v>

371
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.490
<v Speaker 2>but a large amount of concussions,</v>

372
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:26.491
<v Speaker 2>even concussions at windup in depression or from chest injuries from getting hit</v>

373
00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:31.621
<v Speaker 2>in the body because your brain and you snap back your head even though you're</v>

374
00:12:32.171 --> 00:12:33.040
<v Speaker 2>not getting hit in the head,</v>

375
00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:37.600
<v Speaker 2>your brain smashes around inside of your head and it causes some serious injury</v>

376
00:12:37.601 --> 00:12:39.120
<v Speaker 2>to the brain and they're,</v>

377
00:12:39.121 --> 00:12:41.050
<v Speaker 2>they're doing all these different tests on like,</v>

378
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.790
<v Speaker 2>like what is important?</v>

379
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Is it head contact,</v>

380
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.830
<v Speaker 2>his head moving.</v>

381
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:49.830
<v Speaker 2>A lot of soccer players have issues with the CTE as they get older from heading</v>

382
00:12:50.171 --> 00:12:50.800
<v Speaker 2>the ball,</v>

383
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.740
<v Speaker 2>just heading a fucking rubber ball.</v>

384
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.750
<v Speaker 2>It that much doesn't matter.</v>

385
00:12:54.751 --> 00:12:55.331
<v Speaker 2>And it was not,</v>

386
00:12:55.331 --> 00:12:55.750
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>

387
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:56.261
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

388
00:12:56.261 --> 00:12:56.530
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

389
00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:56.801
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

390
00:12:56.801 --> 00:12:57.611
<v Speaker 2>they do a lot,</v>

391
00:12:57.611 --> 00:12:58.680
<v Speaker 2>but it's a matter of that,</v>

392
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:00.430
<v Speaker 2>that thump,</v>

393
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:01.323
<v Speaker 2>that jolt,</v>

394
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.410
<v Speaker 2>that sharp jolt.</v>

395
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:07.270
<v Speaker 2>It's your brain moving around inside of your head and it's not designed for</v>

396
00:13:07.271 --> 00:13:07.571
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

397
00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:08.350
<v Speaker 2>And at a certain,</v>

398
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.470
<v Speaker 2>it has a certain amount of those you can give it and then it just starts going.</v>

399
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:16.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like a fucking transmission that you just jam into fucking first when</v>

400
00:13:16.361 --> 00:13:17.194
<v Speaker 2>you're on the highway.</v>

401
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.100
<v Speaker 2>After a while,</v>

402
00:13:18.101 --> 00:13:18.581
<v Speaker 2>it's that thing.</v>

403
00:13:18.581 --> 00:13:19.121
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

404
00:13:19.121 --> 00:13:19.721
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

405
00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:20.051
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

406
00:13:20.051 --> 00:13:20.381
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

407
00:13:20.381 --> 00:13:21.191
<v Speaker 2>hey gears.</v>

408
00:13:21.191 --> 00:13:21.971
<v Speaker 2>Start breaking.</v>

409
00:13:21.971 --> 00:13:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Shit starts falling off.</v>

410
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.310
<v Speaker 2>If I didn't know you and you were just another fighter and you asked me for</v>

411
00:13:27.311 --> 00:13:28.144
<v Speaker 2>advice,</v>

412
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.420
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably be a lot nicer about how I gave you that advice.</v>

413
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:37.140
<v Speaker 2>I did that cause I'm fucking terrified I did that because I'm seeing you're a</v>

414
00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:38.980
<v Speaker 2>smart dude.</v>

415
00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.960
<v Speaker 2>You're a funny dude and you're,</v>

416
00:13:40.961 --> 00:13:42.850
<v Speaker 2>you're like fun to be around.</v>

417
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.480
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to go.</v>

418
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.281
<v Speaker 2>That goes with no,</v>

419
00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:44.350
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

420
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.471
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

421
00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:45.304
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

422
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.050
<v Speaker 2>We're going to good place if that,</v>

423
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:48.460
<v Speaker 2>if that goes away,</v>

424
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.840
<v Speaker 2>if that goes away,</v>

425
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:52.390
<v Speaker 2>I would be horrified.</v>

426
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:53.800
<v Speaker 2>I'd be fucking horrified.</v>

427
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.060
<v Speaker 2>I would have a real problem.</v>

428
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.270
<v Speaker 2>I've had problems call and fights with people I barely know.</v>

429
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.640
<v Speaker 2>And then I see them get to that point where they're,</v>

430
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.340
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

431
00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:01.600
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

432
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.480
<v Speaker 2>they start slurring and they started having a hard time.</v>

433
00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:05.890
<v Speaker 2>I see it in interviews.</v>

434
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:07.810
<v Speaker 2>I see them like struggle in interviews.</v>

435
00:14:07.811 --> 00:14:08.110
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

436
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

437
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:09.250
<v Speaker 2>look at him.</v>

438
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:10.900
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes it's just a guy's tired.</v>

439
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.793
<v Speaker 2>That's possible.</v>

440
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.101
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

441
00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:12.934
<v Speaker 2>If you catch me,</v>

442
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.350
<v Speaker 2>if I'm really tired,</v>

443
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

444
00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.150
<v Speaker 2>in some of the interviewed me,</v>

445
00:14:16.151 --> 00:14:18.730
<v Speaker 2>I bet I'd probably look like I was fucked up.</v>

446
00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:20.170
<v Speaker 2>You can usually,</v>

447
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

448
00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.430
<v Speaker 2>there's just a thing that happens where I go,</v>

449
00:14:24.431 --> 00:14:25.264
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

450
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:26.613
<v Speaker 2>he's gone.</v>

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.101
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

452
00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:27.410
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:28.930
<v Speaker 2>I've seen too many guys,</v>

454
00:14:28.931 --> 00:14:29.111

<v Speaker 2>I've seen too many guys.</v>

457
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:38.260
<v Speaker 2>But it's more dangerous when you're not considering the danger.</v>

458
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:39.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

459
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:39.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

460
00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:42.490

<v Speaker 2>he can't recover from this fucking concussion.</v>

465
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.850
<v Speaker 2>He's got to look this year long.</v>

466
00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:54.320
<v Speaker 2>Headache is all fucked up,</v>

468
00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:57.740

469
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.970
<v Speaker 2>fucks him up again.</v>

470
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:00.140
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

471
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:00.681

00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:00.921

00:15:01.151 --> 00:15:02.270
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to figure out what to do.</v>

475
00:15:02.271 --> 00:15:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Like this might be over,</v>

476
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.270
<v Speaker 2>he was in line for a title shot a year and a half ago,</v>

477
00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:05.760
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

478
00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.740
<v Speaker 2>A year and a half million.</v>

479
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.870
<v Speaker 2>And then the guy who was fighter who fought before he got that shot of the title</v>

480
00:15:10.871 --> 00:15:11.704
<v Speaker 2>is Gray Maynard,</v>

481
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:11.901
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

482
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:16.010
<v Speaker 2>gray Maynard with grain or is a fucking animal guy comes off.</v>

483
00:15:16.011 --> 00:15:16.460
<v Speaker 2>Tough,</v>

484
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.300
<v Speaker 2>tough wrestler,</v>

485
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.253
<v Speaker 2>a hard punch,</v>

486
00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:19.323
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

487
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.960
<v Speaker 2>but it goes through these wars.</v>

488
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:22.730
<v Speaker 2>She got wars with Frankie Edgar.</v>

489
00:15:22.731 --> 00:15:24.140
<v Speaker 2>He started off with a great chin too.</v>

490
00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

491
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:25.490
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

492
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:25.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

493
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:26.030
<v Speaker 2>the side,</v>

494
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.050
<v Speaker 2>the last fight when Nate Diaz,</v>

495
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.490
<v Speaker 2>he gets tagged and he just,</v>

496
00:15:28.491 --> 00:15:29.720
<v Speaker 2>his body freezes.</v>

497
00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:30.554
<v Speaker 2>You could tell,</v>

498
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.790
<v Speaker 2>you could see it in his face.</v>

499
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.940
<v Speaker 2>His body freezes and he like this guy just is not taking shots the way he used</v>

500
00:15:37.851 --> 00:15:38.660
<v Speaker 2>to tag them,</v>

501
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

502
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:40.640
<v Speaker 2>and maybe he's okay.</v>

503
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.481
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you know,</v>

504
00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:42.410
<v Speaker 2>he went into that fight.</v>

505
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.960
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing guys go into fight with injuries already.</v>

506
00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.220
<v Speaker 2>Like you were talking about,</v>

507
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:47.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

508
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.740
<v Speaker 2>your fight with Ben Rothwell,</v>

509
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:49.400
<v Speaker 2>the UN,</v>

510
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.290
<v Speaker 2>that fight we were talking about on the podcast,</v>

511
00:15:51.291 --> 00:15:56.291
<v Speaker 2>you'd got tagged by Corwin and training up to that and you're going in already</v>

512
00:15:56.871 --> 00:15:57.560
<v Speaker 2>diminished.</v>

513
00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.960
<v Speaker 2>You going in like with a weakened chin already.</v>

514
00:15:59.961 --> 00:16:00.440
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

515
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:00.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

516
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.830
<v Speaker 2>if somebody tags you,</v>

517
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:02.391
<v Speaker 2>you're already,</v>

518
00:16:02.391 --> 00:16:03.500
<v Speaker 2>it's like you hurt your knee.</v>

519
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.780
<v Speaker 2>So when he gets you in a knee bar and your knees tweaked already,</v>

520
00:16:05.781 --> 00:16:06.740
<v Speaker 2>like you're fucked.</v>

521
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:07.640
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

522
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.410
<v Speaker 2>that's the same way with everything</v>

523
00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:11.080
<v Speaker 3>Brandon.</v>

524
00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you decided or are you like on the fence or you for sure fighting for</v>

525
00:16:15.161 --> 00:16:15.401
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

526
00:16:15.401 --> 00:16:16.020
<v Speaker 3>Fighting,</v>

527
00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.140
<v Speaker 3>not even up for discussion.</v>

528
00:16:17.141 --> 00:16:17.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

529
00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:18.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean you guys can keep talking about it.</v>

530
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:19.600
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

531
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.433
<v Speaker 3>At this point,</v>

532
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.333
<v Speaker 3>at this point.</v>

533
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:26.340
<v Speaker 3>That's defensive Brendan Tone know at this point it would be about,</v>

534
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:27.670
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

535
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:28.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

536
00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:29.023
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

537
00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:35.580
<v Speaker 3>if Brian started hanging out with any other fighter who just got into the UFC,</v>

538
00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.330
<v Speaker 3>whoever it was,</v>

539
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.250
<v Speaker 3>there's a good chance,</v>

540
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.810
<v Speaker 3>80% chance.</v>

541
00:16:40.811 --> 00:16:43.760
<v Speaker 3>I would say that we'd be going through the exact same thing at,</v>

542
00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.990
<v Speaker 3>at whenever a,</v>

543
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.050
<v Speaker 3>that person's career,</v>

544
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:47.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

545
00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.410
<v Speaker 3>whenever there was like two or three losses and are big losses,</v>

546
00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:51.220
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>

547
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.870
<v Speaker 3>That would mean if you're around Brian,</v>

548
00:16:52.871 --> 00:16:57.040
<v Speaker 3>that means Joe likes you too and what you're hanging out and he gets to know you</v>

549
00:16:57.041 --> 00:16:57.360
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

550
00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.300
<v Speaker 3>and he's just,</v>

551
00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.030
<v Speaker 3>it really is.</v>

552
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.621
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

553
00:16:59.621 --> 00:17:00.131
<v Speaker 3>you know this,</v>

554
00:17:00.131 --> 00:17:02.650
<v Speaker 3>it really is just him like loving you.</v>

555
00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:03.923
<v Speaker 3>That's all it is.</v>

556
00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:05.920
<v Speaker 3>Zero fence for me.</v>

557
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:06.500
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>

558
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:06.821
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

559
00:17:06.821 --> 00:17:07.001
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

560
00:17:07.001 --> 00:17:08.020
<v Speaker 3>if you want to still fight,</v>

561
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.010
<v Speaker 3>this is what I think.</v>

562
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.540
<v Speaker 3>I think you,</v>

563
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.610
<v Speaker 3>if you just say fuck the brain injury,</v>

564
00:17:12.611 --> 00:17:13.241
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a shit.</v>

565
00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:13.781
<v Speaker 3>I'm going,</v>

566
00:17:13.781 --> 00:17:14.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm going for,</v>

567
00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:16.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fucking savage and this is what I was born to do.</v>

568
00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if my brain starts going bad at at 50.</v>

569
00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.393
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to do that,</v>

570
00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:22.383
<v Speaker 3>then this is,</v>

571
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:23.680
<v Speaker 3>this is what I would say,</v>

572
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.823
<v Speaker 3>just</v>

573
00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:28.163
<v Speaker 3>get out of here,</v>

574
00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:28.541

<v Speaker 3>some fighters asking me for advice,</v>

578
00:17:34.031 --> 00:17:35.190
<v Speaker 3>what they should do and,</v>

579
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.480
<v Speaker 3>and everything that he said about like,</v>

580
00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:38.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

581
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.090
<v Speaker 3>like your footwork for example,</v>

582
00:17:40.091 --> 00:17:41.350
<v Speaker 3>and kind of lunging with your punches.</v>

583
00:17:41.351 --> 00:17:41.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

584
00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:46.270
<v Speaker 3>Obviously you're not as smooth as Anderson Silva on your feet.</v>

585
00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.193
<v Speaker 3>That's obvious.</v>

586
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:48.970
<v Speaker 3>The goal I would say,</v>

587
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.830
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to keep going,</v>

588
00:17:49.831 --> 00:17:50.071
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

589
00:17:50.071 --> 00:17:54.690
<v Speaker 3>let's fucking get that foot work and the movement</v>

590
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.330
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

591
00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.070
<v Speaker 3>let's strive to move.</v>

592
00:17:59.071 --> 00:17:59.640
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

593
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.061
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

594
00:18:00.061 --> 00:18:00.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

595
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

596
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:01.890
<v Speaker 3>John Jones,</v>

597
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.480
<v Speaker 3>whatever John Jones has stolen,</v>

598
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:04.680
<v Speaker 3>however he's moving.</v>

599
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.270
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you'll never be Jon Jones,</v>

600
00:18:06.271 --> 00:18:09.180
<v Speaker 3>but you strive for excellence.</v>

601
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.500
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you get halfway there,</v>

602
00:18:10.501 --> 00:18:11.610
<v Speaker 3>but you're in,</v>

603
00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:12.331
<v Speaker 3>in your pursuit,</v>

604
00:18:12.331 --> 00:18:13.710
<v Speaker 3>you get 70% of the way there.</v>

605
00:18:13.711 --> 00:18:15.410
<v Speaker 3>But I think you're a,</v>

606
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.980
<v Speaker 3>you're a tremendous athlete.</v>

607
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:17.970
<v Speaker 3>You play football,</v>

608
00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.110
<v Speaker 3>you can do anything.</v>

609
00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:19.770
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

610
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:20.603
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

611
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

612
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.610
<v Speaker 3>just critiquing your last fights,</v>

613
00:18:22.611 --> 00:18:26.730
<v Speaker 3>it's like spend extra time getting your footwork professional,</v>

614
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:27.810
<v Speaker 3>rocky three,</v>

615
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.040
<v Speaker 3>Rocky Balboa,</v>

616
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:29.880
<v Speaker 3>Mr t,</v>

618
00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:31.390
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

619
00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:36.390
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

620
00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.600
<v Speaker 3>was about about him getting his foot work together.</v>

621
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.020
<v Speaker 3>He gets his footwork together and then he beats Mr t get,</v>

622
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.330
<v Speaker 3>you can get smooth if you remember it.</v>

623
00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:49.350
<v Speaker 3>Anybody can do it.</v>

624
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.960
<v Speaker 3>If you pay attention to fiber Eastover doing.</v>

625
00:18:51.961 --> 00:18:52.471
<v Speaker 3>For instance,</v>

626
00:18:52.471 --> 00:18:52.861
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

627
00:18:52.861 --> 00:18:53.371
<v Speaker 3>he's a killer.</v>

628
00:18:53.371 --> 00:18:55.440
<v Speaker 3>Stryker with great footwork and great movement.</v>

629
00:18:55.441 --> 00:18:56.310
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking people up.</v>

630
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:57.600
<v Speaker 3>But he wasn't like that for awhile.</v>

631
00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:01.380
<v Speaker 3>He was the classic Jujitsu guy like Hadzic Gracie when he came out,</v>

632
00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.150
<v Speaker 3>super good Jujitsu Guy,</v>

633
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.790
<v Speaker 3>they'd had zero stand up and there they,</v>

634
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.520
<v Speaker 3>you don't think I take one punch that really shaky.</v>

635
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:10.200
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to get the fight to the match.</v>

636
00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:10.920
<v Speaker 3>They lose,</v>

637
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.720
<v Speaker 3>lose some decisions that get taken down.</v>

638
00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:13.291
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

639
00:19:13.291 --> 00:19:13.670
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

640
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:14.010
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

641
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.110
<v Speaker 3>they really don't have anything to offer on their feet.</v>

642
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.980
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

643
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:17.191
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

644
00:19:17.191 --> 00:19:18.024
<v Speaker 3>but then you,</v>

645
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.910
<v Speaker 3>what Felicia over doom did than most other Jujitsu fighters didn't do a lot of</v>

646
00:19:22.911 --> 00:19:23.744
<v Speaker 3>judges to fighters.</v>

647
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.950
<v Speaker 3>They poked him into the MMA world.</v>

648
00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.041
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

649
00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:26.331
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

650
00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:29.430
<v Speaker 3>on this is gonna take way too long to way too scary.</v>

651
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:32.010
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm going to open up an academy and fucking make money.</v>

652
00:19:32.011 --> 00:19:35.920
<v Speaker 3>Just [inaudible] a lot of guys that did that and some Jujitsu guys have,</v>

653
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:36.511
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

654
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:36.930
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

655
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.250
<v Speaker 3>they lasted a few fights,</v>

656
00:19:38.251 --> 00:19:39.840
<v Speaker 3>but they can never get their stand up together.</v>

657
00:19:39.841 --> 00:19:40.080
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

658
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.520
<v Speaker 3>it was started looking okay,</v>

659
00:19:41.521 --> 00:19:44.310
<v Speaker 3>but then it was just condemn and then they didn't have the wrestling to take</v>

660
00:19:44.311 --> 00:19:44.971
<v Speaker 3>down these wrestlers.</v>

661
00:19:44.971 --> 00:19:48.070
<v Speaker 3>So they're stuck standing and they can't take these wrestlers down there,</v>

662
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.670
<v Speaker 3>not that pro pulling guard.</v>

663
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.190
<v Speaker 3>So they get caught in this mess and then they get cut in the UFC,</v>

664
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:53.700
<v Speaker 3>UFC,</v>

665
00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.870
<v Speaker 3>all these black belts in,</v>

666
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.290
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

667
00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:55.650
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

668
00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:56.960
<v Speaker 3>out and out by bt.</v>

669
00:19:56.961 --> 00:19:58.200
<v Speaker 3>Super Doom and out.</v>

670
00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:58.741
<v Speaker 3>But you know what?</v>

671
00:19:58.741 --> 00:19:59.574
<v Speaker 3>He stuck it out.</v>

672
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:02.220
<v Speaker 3>He stuck it out camp working on his footwork,</v>

673
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:03.600
<v Speaker 3>kept working on a strikes,</v>

674
00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.070
<v Speaker 3>the power and the combinations.</v>

675
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.310
<v Speaker 3>Look at Fabius we're,</v>

676
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:07.110
<v Speaker 3>we're doing now.</v>

677
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:08.100
<v Speaker 3>He stuck it out.</v>

678
00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.960
<v Speaker 3>People don't remember those dark ages he started working with,</v>

679
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.810
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't that good.</v>

680
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.570
<v Speaker 3>His standup wasn't that good and it takes so long.</v>

681
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:20.750
<v Speaker 3>I just think you gotta get the ultimate standup coach do you could find,</v>

682
00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:22.110
<v Speaker 3>and it was just like rocky three,</v>

683
00:20:22.111 --> 00:20:24.630
<v Speaker 3>the focus on lids and then work with,</v>

684
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:25.111
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:45.803
<v Speaker 3>You just gotta practice.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I believe you can.</v>

707
00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.400

708
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:02.520

<v Speaker 3>the real and then,</v>

711
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.490

<v Speaker 3>to release the stuff.</v>

714
00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:10.690
<v Speaker 3>That's that.</v>

715
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:15.690
<v Speaker 3>That's that whole whatever is keeping you from opening your mind to the best</v>

716
00:21:15.821 --> 00:21:19.240
<v Speaker 3>possible Jujitsu every seen Ben Saunders his last fight with drill rigs,</v>

717

<v Speaker 3>oil rigs.</v>

718
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:21.740

719
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.830
<v Speaker 3>but you just see how Ben Saunders was about to eat him up right away.</v>

720
00:21:24.831 --> 00:21:27.190
<v Speaker 3>You just see that you can do that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Just the focus,</v>

823
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.380
<v Speaker 5>the focus should be the foot work and the combos and,</v>

00:25:37.931 --> 00:25:38.860
<v Speaker 6>I can't do that.</v>

869
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:41.380
<v Speaker 6>What you mean brother also told you that he agreed with me?</v>

870
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.273
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

871
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:44.171
<v Speaker 6>He agrees to.</v>

872
00:25:44.171 --> 00:25:45.470
<v Speaker 6>As far as he,</v>

873
00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.313
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

874
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.250
<v Speaker 6>he thinks I can be champ.</v>

875
00:25:48.251 --> 00:25:49.270
<v Speaker 6>I could fight for a title,</v>

876
00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:54.400
<v Speaker 6>but he thinks that I could make more money being a doing podcasts in my shows.</v>

877
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.140
<v Speaker 6>But he's also worried about you?</v>

878
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:56.680
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

879
00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.071
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

880
00:25:57.071 --> 00:25:57.461
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

881
00:25:57.461 --> 00:25:58.810
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to see you get punched in the face.</v>

882
00:25:59.000 --> 00:25:59.380
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

883
00:25:59.380 --> 00:25:59.740
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

884
00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.480
<v Speaker 6>He doesn't think I'm like washed up and I'll shitty.</v>

885
00:26:01.481 --> 00:26:05.260
<v Speaker 6>Like you really could become like you guys together,</v>

886
00:26:05.261 --> 00:26:06.190
<v Speaker 6>especially as a team.</v>

887
00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.750
<v Speaker 6>You guys can become a huge force.</v>

888
00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:08.441
<v Speaker 6>That's the other thing.</v>

889
00:26:08.441 --> 00:26:08.740
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

890
00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:09.490
<v Speaker 6>like you're hilarious,</v>

891
00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:09.911
<v Speaker 6>like doing,</v>

892
00:26:09.911 --> 00:26:10.481
<v Speaker 6>doing this,</v>

893
00:26:10.481 --> 00:26:15.220
<v Speaker 6>doing the podcast with you is by far by far the biggest thing we've ever done.</v>

894
00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:19.930
<v Speaker 6>And just the notoriety and the amount of love I get now is insane.</v>

895
00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.440
<v Speaker 6>Like I,</v>

896
00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.590
<v Speaker 6>I was walking down the street from Starbucks and this construction workers,</v>

897
00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.390
<v Speaker 6>three of them came up to me and gave me a big hug.</v>

898
00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:25.841
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

899
00:26:25.841 --> 00:26:26.651
<v Speaker 6>don't stop man.</v>

900
00:26:26.651 --> 00:26:27.401
<v Speaker 6>We love you man.</v>

901
00:26:27.401 --> 00:26:28.234
<v Speaker 6>Don't stop.</v>

902
00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:28.930
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

903
00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:29.763
<v Speaker 6>it's insane.</v>

904
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.660
<v Speaker 6>And then you see the article in the New Yorker.</v>

905
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:32.591
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

906
00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:35.320
<v Speaker 6>it's just the coverage we got from it.</v>

907
00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.273
<v Speaker 6>And honestly,</v>

908
00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:37.840
<v Speaker 6>when I left here,</v>

909
00:26:37.841 --> 00:26:39.010
<v Speaker 6>I texted Brian right away.</v>

910
00:26:39.011 --> 00:26:39.340
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

911
00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:40.330
<v Speaker 6>we're not posting that man.</v>

912
00:26:40.331 --> 00:26:41.350
<v Speaker 6>I'm super embarrassed.</v>

913
00:26:41.351 --> 00:26:42.220
<v Speaker 6>I'm crying right now.</v>

914
00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:43.083
<v Speaker 6>Do not post.</v>

915
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.940
<v Speaker 6>And I got home again,</v>

916
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:45.810
<v Speaker 6>cried some more,</v>

917
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:46.763
<v Speaker 6>and I was like,</v>

918
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.870
<v Speaker 6>I think you and I started talking.</v>

919
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:49.501
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

920
00:26:49.501 --> 00:26:50.070
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

921
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.341
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

922
00:26:50.341 --> 00:26:50.460
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

923
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.250
<v Speaker 6>we probably should post it because there's an unselfish way.</v>

924
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:54.901
<v Speaker 6>I've had a lot,</v>

925
00:26:54.901 --> 00:26:55.860
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to mention names.</v>

926
00:26:55.861 --> 00:26:57.990
<v Speaker 6>I've had a lot of fighters reach out to me who were like,</v>

927
00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:58.830
<v Speaker 6>thanks dude,</v>

928
00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:59.191
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>

929
00:26:59.191 --> 00:27:00.660
<v Speaker 6>That went a long ways man.</v>

930
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.070
<v Speaker 6>I needed to hear that.</v>

931
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:03.460
<v Speaker 6>I can't believe you've stood in,</v>

932
00:27:03.461 --> 00:27:04.470
<v Speaker 6>took it like a man,</v>

933
00:27:04.471 --> 00:27:05.160
<v Speaker 6>blah blah blah.</v>

934
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:09.000
<v Speaker 6>So I have these people who are in the business reaching out to me now and I have</v>

935
00:27:09.001 --> 00:27:09.511
<v Speaker 6>big shoulders,</v>

936
00:27:09.511 --> 00:27:09.720
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

937
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.471
<v Speaker 6>have thick skin.</v>

938
00:27:10.471 --> 00:27:12.540
<v Speaker 6>I'd be shorts for a reason cause they can take all this shit.</v>

939
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:13.310
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying?</v>

940
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.890
<v Speaker 6>It,</v>

941
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.690
<v Speaker 6>I took it as you just reaching out to me.</v>

942
00:27:15.691 --> 00:27:17.250
<v Speaker 6>So we spoke about,</v>

943
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:18.680
<v Speaker 6>hold on top that I'm talking.</v>

944
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.040
<v Speaker 6>I was going to say what he said about,</v>

945
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:24.030
<v Speaker 6>we talked about releasing it and you kind of said this is part of,</v>

946
00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:26.130
<v Speaker 6>this is part of my thought process.</v>

947
00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:30.780
<v Speaker 6>This is part of the experience of fighting and that's why he kind of decided why</v>

948
00:27:30.781 --> 00:27:31.530
<v Speaker 6>hide this?</v>

949
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:34.830
<v Speaker 6>Let's not to let this out there and get the debate I talked about on our</v>

950
00:27:34.831 --> 00:27:35.311
<v Speaker 6>podcasts.</v>

951
00:27:35.311 --> 00:27:36.510
<v Speaker 6>Like it's like a journey.</v>

952
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:40.560
<v Speaker 6>Like the reason the show so big and the reason why when you do a show I walk in,</v>

953
00:27:40.561 --> 00:27:42.090
<v Speaker 6>people are cheering big brown.</v>

954
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.530
<v Speaker 6>It's insane man.</v>

955
00:27:43.531 --> 00:27:43.740
<v Speaker 6>When I,</v>

956
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:44.700
<v Speaker 6>when I go to anything.</v>

957
00:27:44.701 --> 00:27:48.540
<v Speaker 6>So the reason why is because they're on this journey with me like they care,</v>

958
00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:49.800
<v Speaker 6>like they literally care about me.</v>

959
00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:52.140
<v Speaker 6>So I talk about signing a fight.</v>

960
00:27:52.141 --> 00:27:53.130
<v Speaker 6>I talked about getting the trash,</v>

961
00:27:53.131 --> 00:27:53.641
<v Speaker 6>Brown fight,</v>

962
00:27:53.641 --> 00:27:54.570
<v Speaker 6>how excited I am.</v>

963
00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.750
<v Speaker 6>I tell you about going through training camp and the buildup,</v>

964
00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:01.350
<v Speaker 6>how excited and nervous and scared and then after the fight win or lose,</v>

965
00:28:01.351 --> 00:28:02.460
<v Speaker 6>there's still a part of this journey.</v>

966
00:28:02.461 --> 00:28:03.320
<v Speaker 6>So I'm just going to leave it.</v>

967
00:28:03.321 --> 00:28:04.890
<v Speaker 6>And this was a huge part of it.</v>

968
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.120
<v Speaker 6>Good or bad.</v>

969
00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:06.961
<v Speaker 6>It does.</v>

970
00:28:06.961 --> 00:28:11.010
<v Speaker 6>I think it does wonders for not only me but other fighters out there or</v>

971
00:28:11.011 --> 00:28:11.371
<v Speaker 6>football.</v>

972
00:28:11.371 --> 00:28:12.900
<v Speaker 6>I've had football guys reach out to me.</v>

973
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:16.830
<v Speaker 6>I had a ton of people reach out to me and thank me for having that conversation.</v>

974
00:28:16.831 --> 00:28:17.641
<v Speaker 6>Both fighters,</v>

975
00:28:17.641 --> 00:28:18.690
<v Speaker 6>trainers,</v>

976
00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.520
<v Speaker 6>former fighters,</v>

977
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.900
<v Speaker 6>just across the board.</v>

978
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:23.063
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

979
00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:26.520
<v Speaker 6>so many people don't want to have that conversation.</v>

980
00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.300
<v Speaker 6>They just don't because we all know it's real and it's the monster in the room</v>

981
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:31.550
<v Speaker 6>that nobody talks about you.</v>

982
00:28:31.551 --> 00:28:32.670
<v Speaker 6>You know what it has done though.</v>

983
00:28:32.671 --> 00:28:33.570
<v Speaker 6>It's like a,</v>

984
00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:33.751
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

985
00:28:33.751 --> 00:28:34.920
<v Speaker 6>obviously you're a powerful dude,</v>

986
00:28:34.921 --> 00:28:38.340
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think you realize on when you say something,</v>

987
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:41.070
<v Speaker 6>these fucking people jump on it man.</v>

988
00:28:41.071 --> 00:28:45.750
<v Speaker 6>But it's opened up a weird door because people don't realize that you and I are</v>

989
00:28:45.751 --> 00:28:46.590
<v Speaker 6>good friends.</v>

990
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.111
<v Speaker 6>They think,</v>

991
00:28:47.111 --> 00:28:47.271
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

992
00:28:47.271 --> 00:28:48.930
<v Speaker 6>like they see me on here whatever,</v>

993
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:50.790
<v Speaker 6>six times a year,</v>

994
00:28:50.791 --> 00:28:51.720
<v Speaker 6>whenever the fuck I'm here.</v>

995
00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:53.490
<v Speaker 6>So they think we're just whatever.</v>

996
00:28:53.491 --> 00:28:55.050
<v Speaker 6>And you call my fights in the UFC.</v>

997
00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.020
<v Speaker 6>So it's opened up this door where like the fucking guy at uh,</v>

998
00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:00.520
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

999
00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.530
<v Speaker 6>Bennigan's or whatever.</v>

1000
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:02.790
<v Speaker 6>I hop my waiters like,</v>

1001
00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:03.361
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1002
00:29:03.361 --> 00:29:03.691
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

1003
00:29:03.691 --> 00:29:04.890
<v Speaker 6>heard the podcast.</v>

1004
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:05.600
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

1005
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.330
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1006
00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:06.900
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

1007
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.250
<v Speaker 6>I think you might want to give it up</v>

1008
00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:10.763
<v Speaker 6>for sure.</v>

1009
00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:11.913
<v Speaker 6>Starts with,</v>

1010
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:12.780
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

1011
00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:12.961
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1012
00:29:12.961 --> 00:29:13.381

1057
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:24.940
<v Speaker 2>And I say it's because you don't know.</v>

1058
00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:26.030
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1059

<v Speaker 2>You're a real nice guy.</v>

1070
00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:41.771
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1071
00:30:41.771 --> 00:30:45.460
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's one of the hard things about,</v>

1072
00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:46.323
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1073
00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:48.540
<v Speaker 2>being in a position where you're,</v>

1074
00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:48.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1075
00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.790
<v Speaker 2>you're exposed to the public because you're just going to get a bunch of</v>

1076
00:30:51.791 --> 00:30:52.760
<v Speaker 2>opinions you're going to,</v>

1077
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.250
<v Speaker 2>but I get it no matter what,</v>

<v Speaker 2>anything I talk about,</v>

1079
00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:56.410
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1080
00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:57.550
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the weirdest things.</v>

1081
00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Like you'll be in line at Starbucks and someone will try to bring up some shit</v>

1082
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:01.661
<v Speaker 2>that happened to you,</v>

1083
00:31:01.661 --> 00:31:04.540
<v Speaker 2>like some personal shit from like 10 years ago or something.</v>

1084
00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:05.920
<v Speaker 2>And I'll talk to you about it.</v>

1085
00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.131
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1086
00:31:06.131 --> 00:31:06.371

1088
00:31:08.141 --> 00:31:08.410
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

1089
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:08.890
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1090
00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:09.071
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1091
00:31:09.071 --> 00:31:10.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to get a coughing.</v>

1092
00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:10.871
<v Speaker 2>Get out of here.</v>

1093
00:31:10.871 --> 00:31:12.730
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to go into some weird shit about my dad.</v>

1094
00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:13.680
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1095
00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.441
<v Speaker 2>I don't know you.</v>

1096
00:31:14.441 --> 00:31:15.274
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy.</v>

1097
00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:15.770
<v Speaker 2>He's cause that,</v>

1098
00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:16.870
<v Speaker 2>talk about some shit</v>

1099
00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:20.050
<v Speaker 2>and I think you mean a way.</v>

1100
00:31:20.051 --> 00:31:20.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1101
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:21.423
<v Speaker 2>in a way.</v>

1102
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.310
<v Speaker 2>But you don't know someone unless they know you too.</v>

1103
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.690
<v Speaker 2>You do know them,</v>

1104
00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:29.380
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know them in terms of like how you guys interact with each other,</v>

1105
00:31:29.381 --> 00:31:33.430
<v Speaker 2>especially if not accusing these people being clueless.</v>

1106
00:31:33.431 --> 00:31:35.140
<v Speaker 2>But if you run into a clueless person,</v>

1107
00:31:35.141 --> 00:31:39.490
<v Speaker 2>they think they have this idea of who you are based entirely on your</v>

1108
00:31:39.491 --> 00:31:40.690
<v Speaker 2>interactions with other people.</v>

1109
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.170
<v Speaker 2>They're not taking into account how that person would react to you.</v>

1110
00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:45.220
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

1111
00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:48.700
<v Speaker 2>you think you have this idea of who the fuck Brian Callan is and how to fix</v>

1112
00:31:48.701 --> 00:31:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Brian Cowen.</v>

1113
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:50.500
<v Speaker 2>But Brian County will be like,</v>

1114
00:31:50.501 --> 00:31:50.701
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1115
00:31:50.701 --> 00:31:50.851
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1116
00:31:50.851 --> 00:31:51.031
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1117
00:31:51.031 --> 00:31:51.211
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1118
00:31:51.211 --> 00:31:51.421
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

1119
00:31:51.421 --> 00:31:51.641
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1120
00:31:51.641 --> 00:31:52.180
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1121
00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.350
<v Speaker 2>How about you look in a mirror,</v>

1122
00:31:53.351 --> 00:31:54.184
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>

1123
00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:55.870
<v Speaker 2>You know you're talking all this shit about me.</v>

1124
00:31:55.871 --> 00:31:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you look at yourself like this is a crazy conversation that you're not</v>

1125
00:31:59.801 --> 00:32:02.800
<v Speaker 2>qualified to be doling out advice to Brian can.</v>

1126
00:32:02.801 --> 00:32:05.690
<v Speaker 2>That's why podcasts are so big and that's why people buy it.</v>

1127
00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Because those same people are going to listen to every show you do what Rogan</v>

1128
00:32:09.941 --> 00:32:10.211
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

00:32:10.211 --> 00:32:11.080

1136
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:16.083
<v Speaker 2>It's a numbers thing.</v>

1137
00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:19.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're dealing with millions of people now and when you're dealing with</v>

1138
00:32:19.631 --> 00:32:20.291

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.280
<v Speaker 2>they talk out of character when they're around you.</v>

1144
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.610
<v Speaker 2>That would never bough too.</v>

1145
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.180

1150
00:32:42.051 --> 00:32:42.831
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know what to do.</v>

1151
00:32:42.831 --> 00:32:43.664
<v Speaker 2>They are like that.</v>

1152

1155
00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:48.651
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1156
00:32:48.651 --> 00:32:49.490
<v Speaker 2>it's overwhelming.</v>

1157
00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.060
<v Speaker 2>And I've,</v>

1158
00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:50.960
<v Speaker 2>I've experienced it,</v>

1159
00:32:50.961 --> 00:32:52.610
<v Speaker 2>I've been lit up for,</v>

1160
00:32:52.611 --> 00:32:54.470
<v Speaker 2>and I met someone that I really admire and like,</v>

1161
00:32:54.471 --> 00:32:55.191
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1162
00:32:55.191 --> 00:32:55.930
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking die.</v>

1163
00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:56.763
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1164
00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:57.410
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1165
00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:57.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1166
00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:02.920
<v Speaker 2>the only time I ever experienced anything close to real faith was when I did one</v>

1167
00:33:03.351 --> 00:33:06.230
<v Speaker 2>episode of sex in the city when it was the biggest show.</v>

1168
00:33:06.231 --> 00:33:08.750
<v Speaker 2>And I walked through New York City and I am,</v>

1169
00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:09.420
<v Speaker 2>I am nodding,</v>

1170
00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.720
<v Speaker 2>I was with Jimmy Burke and I am not exaggerating.</v>

1171
00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Literally every woman that came by,</v>

1172
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.810
<v Speaker 2>every woman was like,</v>

1173
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:16.063
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1174
00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.000
<v Speaker 2>you were so funny.</v>

1175
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.300
<v Speaker 2>Last night I started dragging Jimmy into bars just to see,</v>

1176
00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.620
<v Speaker 2>just to have this experience.</v>

1177
00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:21.921
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1178
00:33:21.921 --> 00:33:23.450
<v Speaker 2>women and girls would get drunk.</v>

1179
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.310
<v Speaker 2>They dragged me and I was a prop.</v>

1180
00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.570
<v Speaker 2>I was basically a prop.</v>

1181
00:33:26.571 --> 00:33:27.560
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know my name or anything,</v>

1182
00:33:27.561 --> 00:33:28.394
<v Speaker 2>but just,</v>

1183
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:30.030
<v Speaker 2>but we're talking about dudes,</v>

1195
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.960

1196
00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.093
<v Speaker 2>Choking them.</v>

1197

1199
00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.070
<v Speaker 2>I do a terrible choke just so they can't sue me.</v>

1200
00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:00.303
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1201
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:04.460
<v Speaker 2>Well you know the UFC actually told people to not take pictures with people</v>

1202
00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:05.010
<v Speaker 2>choking him.</v>

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:05.660
<v Speaker 2>She has chocolate.</v>

1204
00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Dale and Matt Hughes both got suit.</v>

1205
00:34:07.791 --> 00:34:10.970
<v Speaker 2>I tell this to people when they asked me to take a picture choking them and a</v>

1206
00:34:10.971 --> 00:34:11.301
<v Speaker 2>picture,</v>

1207
00:34:11.301 --> 00:34:11.490
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

1208
00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:12.860
<v Speaker 2>I literally can't.</v>

1209
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:15.200
<v Speaker 2>I've been told not to good scam.</v>

1210
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Can you take a picture of me choking me?</v>

1211
00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.240
<v Speaker 2>A guy left a guide to do with Matt Hughes,</v>

1212
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.990
<v Speaker 2>listen to this.</v>

1213
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:22.880
<v Speaker 2>And the guy was a fucking bad cop.</v>

1214
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.620
<v Speaker 2>The guy was a fucking dirty cop.</v>

1215
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:26.520
<v Speaker 2>So he takes his picture with Matt Hughes.</v>

1216
00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:27.950
<v Speaker 2>Mad is choking him in the picture,</v>

1217
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1218
00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:29.240
<v Speaker 2>and look,</v>

1219
00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Matt's a fucking hard ass in a,</v>

1220
00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:35.270
<v Speaker 2>in a wrestler and one of the greatest welterweight world champions ever.</v>

1221
00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.630
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sure he fucking really choked this dude.</v>

1222
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:38.991
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1223
00:34:38.991 --> 00:34:39.824
<v Speaker 2>all right dude.</v>

1224
00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:40.851
<v Speaker 2>You want it?</v>

1225
00:34:40.851 --> 00:34:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1226
00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:42.660
<v Speaker 2>Country fucking farmer strong.</v>

1227
00:34:42.661 --> 00:34:42.891
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1228
00:34:42.891 --> 00:34:43.341
<v Speaker 2>all right dude,</v>

00:34:43.341 --> 00:34:44.180
<v Speaker 2>you want to get silly.</v>

1230
00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Just fucking gave him the clamp down,</v>

1231
00:34:46.911 --> 00:34:48.260
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't hurt the guy.</v>

1232
00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.210
<v Speaker 2>At the very least,</v>

1233
00:34:50.211 --> 00:34:51.044
<v Speaker 2>the guy got it.</v>

1234
00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:54.200
<v Speaker 2>He got to experience what it feels like to get choked by a fucking world</v>

1235
00:34:54.201 --> 00:34:54.830
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>

1236
00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:59.120
<v Speaker 2>So this guy goes and he's files this lawsuit because he's got the photo of Matt.</v>

1237
00:34:59.121 --> 00:34:59.954
<v Speaker 2>He was choking him.</v>

1238
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:02.510
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile everybody around says the guy asked Matt,</v>

1239
00:35:02.511 --> 00:35:05.600
<v Speaker 2>he was to choke him in the picture and then they start looking into this dude</v>

1240
00:35:05.601 --> 00:35:06.680
<v Speaker 2>because the dude soon,</v>

1241
00:35:06.681 --> 00:35:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Matt Hughes and they find out he's dirties doing all sorts of illegal shit and</v>

1242
00:35:10.011 --> 00:35:10.850
<v Speaker 2>now the guy's in jail.</v>

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:15.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh guy went to jail because of that shows people in pictures and then chuck</v>

1245
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:18.680
<v Speaker 2>I believe I might be talking about a school here,</v>

1246
00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:20.840
<v Speaker 2>but I'm almost positive he settled.</v>

1247
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:24.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost positive they had to settle because it was some stupid number,</v>

1248
00:35:24.111 --> 00:35:25.610
<v Speaker 2>like 10,000 and the lawyers like,</v>

1249
00:35:25.611 --> 00:35:25.761
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1250
00:35:25.761 --> 00:35:27.950

1251
00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.270

1256
00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.410
<v Speaker 2>This is a long time ago.</v>

1257
00:35:36.411 --> 00:35:39.450
<v Speaker 2>This is a long time ago while he was a world champion.</v>

1297
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.141
<v Speaker 2>but when,</v>

1298
00:36:31.141 --> 00:36:34.040
<v Speaker 2>when I had this opportunity to go hunting for that show meter,</v>

1299
00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:35.670
<v Speaker 2>it's only one guy called,</v>

1300
00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:37.590
<v Speaker 2>cause I know that Brian would go camping,</v>

1301
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.420
<v Speaker 2>he'll fucking,</v>

1302
00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:38.620
<v Speaker 2>he'll,</v>

1303
00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.080
<v Speaker 2>he'll sleep in the snow.</v>

1304
00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:40.771
<v Speaker 2>Like he's,</v>

1305
00:36:40.771 --> 00:36:41.250
<v Speaker 2>he's just,</v>

1306
00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:42.720
<v Speaker 2>he just can go through shit.</v>

1307
00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:43.740
<v Speaker 2>He ain't calling me.</v>

1308
00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.253
<v Speaker 2>I called Eddie,</v>

1309
00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:46.950
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo be like,</v>

1310
00:36:46.951 --> 00:36:47.291
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1311
00:36:47.291 --> 00:36:52.291
<v Speaker 2>you can go to the supermart heading off [inaudible] Brian's.</v>

1312
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:56.430
<v Speaker 2>Brian is there for you too.</v>

1313
00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:00.540
<v Speaker 2>And Brian is also never angry at you and never in a bad mood.</v>

1314
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:01.890
<v Speaker 2>He's a very unique guy,</v>

1315
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.000
<v Speaker 2>is a very unique guy.</v>

1316
00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:03.481
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1317
00:37:03.481 --> 00:37:04.490
<v Speaker 2>like Eddie Bravo and I,</v>

1318
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.370
<v Speaker 2>I love Eddie.</v>

1319
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.260
<v Speaker 2>He's my pride.</v>

1320
00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.200
<v Speaker 2>And these guys are both,</v>

1321
00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:08.340
<v Speaker 2>they're both my brothers,</v>

1322
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:09.720
<v Speaker 2>but Eddie,</v>

1323
00:37:09.721 --> 00:37:14.190
<v Speaker 2>the difference between them is like Eddie can get upset at people about shit,</v>

1324
00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:18.810
<v Speaker 2>but I've never seen you upset anyone in my life where you're like,</v>

1325
00:37:18.811 --> 00:37:20.130
<v Speaker 2>fuck that guy man.</v>

1326
00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:21.240
<v Speaker 2>If whatever reason,</v>

1327
00:37:21.241 --> 00:37:22.620
<v Speaker 2>whatever you have in you,</v>

1328
00:37:22.621 --> 00:37:24.210
<v Speaker 2>you have this weird thing and you man will,</v>

1329
00:37:24.211 --> 00:37:24.990
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

1330
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:26.040
<v Speaker 2>you're like a duck.</v>

1331
00:37:26.041 --> 00:37:27.690
<v Speaker 2>Water just rolls off your back,</v>

1332
00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.230
<v Speaker 2>shake that shit and you keep on going.</v>

1333
00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:31.083
<v Speaker 2>I can't stay.</v>

1334
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.920
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1335
00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.220
<v Speaker 2>it's an amazing positive quality because Eddie and I are very similar in a way.</v>

1336
00:37:35.221 --> 00:37:37.050
<v Speaker 2>We're both really nice,</v>

1337
00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:38.400
<v Speaker 2>but deep,</v>

1338
00:37:38.401 --> 00:37:41.790
<v Speaker 2>deep down inside we have some weird resentment shit because of our dads.</v>

1339
00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:42.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1340
00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:44.070
<v Speaker 2>there's like this anger shit.</v>

1341
00:37:44.071 --> 00:37:47.220
<v Speaker 2>We both have one of this weird abandonment,</v>

1342
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:48.730
<v Speaker 2>anger shit where we're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1344
00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.070
<v Speaker 2>fuck the world,</v>

1345
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:50.490
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1346
00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:52.650
<v Speaker 2>But it's also one of the reasons why we're brothers.</v>

1347
00:37:52.651 --> 00:37:53.484
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1348
00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:54.960
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1349
00:37:54.961 --> 00:37:56.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm like the same with you man.</v>

1350
00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:57.900
<v Speaker 2>When we met each other,</v>

1351
00:37:57.901 --> 00:37:58.950
<v Speaker 2>we became best friends,</v>

1352
00:37:58.951 --> 00:38:00.810
<v Speaker 2>like instantaneous.</v>

1353

00:38:01.591 --> 00:38:03.960
<v Speaker 2>with you and with Eddie was exactly the same thing.</v>

1356
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.971
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

1357
00:38:04.971 --> 00:38:06.020
<v Speaker 2>you could sleep in my house,</v>

1358
00:38:06.021 --> 00:38:07.200
<v Speaker 2>you can do whatever the fuck you want to do.</v>

1359
00:38:07.201 --> 00:38:07.951
<v Speaker 2>You want to borrow my car,</v>

1360
00:38:07.951 --> 00:38:08.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1361
00:38:08.131 --> 00:38:11.910
<v Speaker 2>it's instantaneously because we have this,</v>

1362
00:38:11.911 --> 00:38:12.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1363
00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:13.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1364
00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.630
<v Speaker 2>I know when dudes are real,</v>

1365
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:16.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1366
00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:18.030
<v Speaker 2>I know when no one's going to fuck me.</v>

1367
00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:18.571
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1368
00:38:18.571 --> 00:38:19.404
<v Speaker 2>I know when I,</v>

1369
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:23.430
<v Speaker 2>when you have love for someone and you know it's reciprocated and you know,</v>

1370
00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:24.630
<v Speaker 2>I would do anything for you.</v>

1371
00:38:24.631 --> 00:38:25.280
<v Speaker 2>You know that.</v>

1372
00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.180
<v Speaker 2>And I would do anything for you and I would do anything for you.</v>

1373
00:38:27.181 --> 00:38:28.830
<v Speaker 2>It's if I really would.</v>

1374
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:33.360
<v Speaker 2>And so being in this situation where you're watching someone and they're,</v>

1375
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.620
<v Speaker 2>they're going down a path you'd like,</v>

1376
00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:36.790
<v Speaker 2>God dammit,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you talked to him today.</v>

1401
00:39:07.271 --> 00:39:08.260
<v Speaker 2>He's sharp as a tack.</v>

1402
00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:09.423
<v Speaker 2>He's fine,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's fine.</v>

1404
00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.440
<v Speaker 2>And he was never a great striker,</v>

00:39:18.401 --> 00:39:19.001
<v Speaker 2>like standing.</v>

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.280
<v Speaker 2>you have a rock.</v>

1441
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:55.540
<v Speaker 2>We're all born with a rock.</v>

1442
00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:57.250
<v Speaker 2>Different people's rocks are different size.</v>

1443
00:39:57.251 --> 00:39:59.320
<v Speaker 2>Mark Hunt's rock is as big as this fucking room.</v>

1444
00:39:59.650 --> 00:39:59.951
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1445
00:39:59.951 --> 00:40:01.350
<v Speaker 2>he's got a different size of the rock.</v>

1446
00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:04.300
<v Speaker 2>Some guys have a rock that's like really small man.</v>

1447
00:40:04.301 --> 00:40:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Some guys rock like you gotta be careful what your sculpture,</v>

1448
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.900
<v Speaker 2>you're designing something and you should design that to the best of your</v>

1449
00:40:10.901 --> 00:40:13.360
<v Speaker 2>possible abilities and with you,</v>

1450
00:40:13.361 --> 00:40:15.310
<v Speaker 2>you're a very high profile dude,</v>

1451
00:40:15.311 --> 00:40:16.990
<v Speaker 2>not just because of the UFC,</v>

1452
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.850
<v Speaker 2>but now because of the podcast.</v>

1453
00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.320
<v Speaker 2>You have the opportunity.</v>

1454
00:40:20.321 --> 00:40:24.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could get guys who would be more than happy to take partial credit</v>

1455
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.610
<v Speaker 2>for turning your striking around for turning you into an elite kickboxer.</v>

1456
00:40:28.611 --> 00:40:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1457
00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.000
<v Speaker 2>Duane Ludwig is the motherfucking man.</v>

1458
00:40:31.001 --> 00:40:31.301
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

1459
00:40:31.301 --> 00:40:35.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'd never met a guy who was more obsessed with taking fighters and</v>

1460
00:40:35.381 --> 00:40:40.381
<v Speaker 2>turning them into like prodigies based on all of the information that he has in</v>

1461
00:40:40.961 --> 00:40:41.350
<v Speaker 2>his head.</v>

1462
00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:46.350
<v Speaker 2>He's texted me several times right before we came in here and we've talked about</v>

1463
00:40:46.361 --> 00:40:46.470
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1464
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.690
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>

1465
00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Dwayne and I have talked about you to Dwayne and I talked about you before I</v>

1466
00:40:50.771 --> 00:40:52.120
<v Speaker 2>brought him in to work with you.</v>

1467
00:40:52.121 --> 00:40:55.630
<v Speaker 2>I brought him in to work with you because I have a deep,</v>

1468
00:40:55.631 --> 00:40:59.590
<v Speaker 2>tremendous respect for Dwayne's knowledge and also his obsession.</v>

1469
00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:00.760
<v Speaker 2>Dwayne's a nut.</v>

1470
00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1471
00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:02.290
<v Speaker 2>He's a nuts.</v>

1472
00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:05.230
<v Speaker 2>You get that Tj Dillashaw foot work together.</v>

1473
00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:05.830
<v Speaker 2>You could do that.</v>

1474
00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.150
<v Speaker 2>It's just going to take a lot of work,</v>

1475
00:41:07.151 --> 00:41:08.260
<v Speaker 2>but anybody could do it.</v>

1476
00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.071
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

1477
00:41:09.071 --> 00:41:10.270
<v Speaker 2>Duane is Dwayne,</v>

1478
00:41:10.271 --> 00:41:12.160
<v Speaker 2>doesn't sugarcoat Jack Shit.</v>

1479
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:15.370
<v Speaker 2>Dwayne won't sugarcoat and he won't even sugarcoat sugar.</v>

1480
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:16.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1481
00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Dwayne's like that's planted sugar.</v>

1482
00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.610
<v Speaker 2>It is what it is.</v>

1483
00:41:18.611 --> 00:41:19.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1484
00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:19.691
<v Speaker 2>I love you.</v>

1485
00:41:19.691 --> 00:41:20.530
<v Speaker 2>You're my mother Fucker,</v>

1486
00:41:20.531 --> 00:41:21.490
<v Speaker 2>but this is wrong.</v>

1487
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:24.670
<v Speaker 2>You're lifting your back foot off off when you throw in right hands.</v>

1488
00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:28.360
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck kind of shit is that like Dwayne will go and then you do it right?</v>

1489
00:41:28.361 --> 00:41:28.631
<v Speaker 2>He like,</v>

1490
00:41:28.631 --> 00:41:28.961
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1491
00:41:28.961 --> 00:41:29.794
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker,</v>

1492
00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.411
<v Speaker 2>I kill.</v>

1493
00:41:30.411 --> 00:41:32.890
<v Speaker 2>He'll give you all the positive reinforcement when you do it right,</v>

1494
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 2>but if you do it wrong,</v>

1495
00:41:34.071 --> 00:41:34.311
<v Speaker 2>Dwayne,</v>

1496
00:41:34.311 --> 00:41:35.390
<v Speaker 2>what's a shit in your mouth?</v>

1497
00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:35.841
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1498
00:41:35.841 --> 00:41:36.260
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't,</v>

1499
00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.160
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't give a fuck.</v>

1500
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:37.341
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1501
00:41:37.341 --> 00:41:41.720
<v Speaker 2>he's a guy who's fought for world titles and kickboxing was a elite MMA fighter</v>

1502
00:41:41.721 --> 00:41:42.890
<v Speaker 2>for a long time,</v>

1503
00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:43.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1504
00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.330
<v Speaker 2>has been down.</v>

1505
00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:45.021
<v Speaker 2>He's been up,</v>

1506
00:41:45.021 --> 00:41:47.780
<v Speaker 2>he's been Kod Kaos guys been submitted,</v>

1507
00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:48.710
<v Speaker 2>seen it all.</v>

1508
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:49.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1509
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.701
<v Speaker 2>no crazy.</v>

1510
00:41:49.701 --> 00:41:52.460
<v Speaker 2>Would it be if Duane Ludwig got his shit together?</v>

1511
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:54.200
<v Speaker 2>He's coming out looking smooth.</v>

1512
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:55.280
<v Speaker 2>That would be amazing.</v>

1513
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.851
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1514
00:41:55.851 --> 00:41:56.390
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>

1515
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:57.800
<v Speaker 2>it's all just about numbers.</v>

1516
00:41:57.910 --> 00:42:02.330
<v Speaker 2>And I was say that fighting in a lot of ways,</v>

1517
00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.800
<v Speaker 2>it's like having a conversation.</v>

1518
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.360
<v Speaker 2>Someone could shout you down.</v>

1519
00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:06.131
<v Speaker 2>You know someone,</v>

1520
00:42:06.131 --> 00:42:07.460
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know how to deal with it,</v>

1521
00:42:07.461 --> 00:42:08.630
<v Speaker 2>someone can shout you down.</v>

1522
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:12.080
<v Speaker 2>But if you'd know how to deal with it and someone tries to shout you down,</v>

1523
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:12.860
<v Speaker 2>you'll like,</v>

1524
00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:15.050
<v Speaker 2>you'll slip away and then they'll get tired of,</v>

1525
00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:16.250
<v Speaker 2>and you down and you go,</v>

1526
00:42:16.251 --> 00:42:17.330
<v Speaker 2>what did you just say now?</v>

1527
00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:18.320
<v Speaker 2>What'd you say?</v>

1528
00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:21.650
<v Speaker 2>You basically said nothing and here's why he said nothing cause you're a fucking</v>

1529
00:42:21.651 --> 00:42:23.600
<v Speaker 2>idiot and this is why you're a fucking idiot.</v>

1530
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:27.280
<v Speaker 2>And then you start hitting him with all these words that they don't know and all</v>

1531
00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.690
<v Speaker 2>these sentences they couldn't possibly form.</v>

1532
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:30.151
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>

1533
00:42:30.151 --> 00:42:32.900
<v Speaker 2>you barrage them with a,</v>

1534
00:42:32.901 --> 00:42:35.990
<v Speaker 2>a verbal assault of intelligence and of,</v>

1535
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:38.630
<v Speaker 2>of articulation that they're not capable of.</v>

1536
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:40.640
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of ways fighting is like that.</v>

1537
00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:44.090
<v Speaker 2>There's some guys that could storm out of the gate and they have one technique</v>

1538
00:42:44.091 --> 00:42:45.350
<v Speaker 2>and they throw it out here and they fucking,</v>

1539
00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:47.300
<v Speaker 2>but if you're skilled,</v>

1540
00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:52.480
<v Speaker 2>you move and you slip and you slide and eventually you start Anderson Silva and</v>

1541
00:42:53.111 --> 00:42:53.750
<v Speaker 2>a motherfucker.</v>

1542
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:55.640
<v Speaker 2>Like when Anderson Silva fought Stephan Bonner,</v>

1543
00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:00.170
<v Speaker 2>one of the best examples is like force it guy or Forrest Griffin.</v>

1544
00:43:00.171 --> 00:43:01.790
<v Speaker 2>Both of them are good both to stem the bar.</v>

1545
00:43:01.791 --> 00:43:05.660
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy because he backed his body up against the cage that we,</v>

1546
00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.630
<v Speaker 2>me and forth.</v>

1547
00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:07.911
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1548
00:43:07.911 --> 00:43:09.130
<v Speaker 2>Well he just left for it.</v>

1549
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Perfect example in another way in that forest got Kol dose times in training.</v>

1550
00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:16.370
<v Speaker 2>He got knocked out twice in training.</v>

1551
00:43:16.371 --> 00:43:16.760
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

1552
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1553
00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:17.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1554
00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:17.961
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1555
00:43:17.961 --> 00:43:18.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1556
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:21.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure had people telling him to not fight.</v>

1557
00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:22.251
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1558
00:43:22.251 --> 00:43:22.461
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1559
00:43:22.461 --> 00:43:24.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he,</v>

1560
00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:29.350
<v Speaker 2>it's just what you know also forces a good example of a guy who won a world</v>

1561
00:43:29.451 --> 00:43:31.220
<v Speaker 2>title came off the ultimate fighter,</v>

1562
00:43:31.221 --> 00:43:32.990
<v Speaker 2>got fed immediately to the dogs.</v>

1563
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was fighting like elite guys,</v>

1564
00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:35.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1565
00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:36.800
<v Speaker 2>like right off the bat.</v>

1566
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:38.160
<v Speaker 2>And then you look at forest now.</v>

1567
00:43:38.161 --> 00:43:38.994
<v Speaker 2>I mean for us,</v>

1568
00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:40.910
<v Speaker 2>he's physically in a lot of trouble.</v>

1569
00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.190
<v Speaker 2>Like he can't even brush his teeth with his right hand.</v>

1570
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:44.840
<v Speaker 2>He's talked about it pretty openly.</v>

1571
00:43:44.841 --> 00:43:47.180
<v Speaker 2>He's bodies like really fucked up his shoulders.</v>

1572
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:49.340
<v Speaker 2>He's taken a lot of punishment to the head.</v>

1573
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:51.350
<v Speaker 2>He was a big dude to cut to a five though.</v>

1574
00:43:51.351 --> 00:43:51.770
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

1575
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:52.521
<v Speaker 2>That was my size,</v>

1576
00:43:52.521 --> 00:43:53.121
<v Speaker 2>if not bigger.</v>

1577
00:43:53.121 --> 00:43:54.470
<v Speaker 2>And he said he's a big dude.</v>

1578
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:56.270
<v Speaker 2>So cutting down for that many years.</v>

1579
00:43:56.271 --> 00:43:56.510

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:07.680
<v Speaker 7>What did you think watching that fight?</v>

1627
00:45:07.681 --> 00:45:12.040
<v Speaker 7>What a God damn slobber knocker steep bay and junior dos sites and how they can</v>

1628
00:45:12.041 --> 00:45:12.841
<v Speaker 7>take that much punishment.</v>

1629

1633
00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:17.910
<v Speaker 7>He looked bigger.</v>

1634
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:19.940
<v Speaker 7>What's weird is that he weighed,</v>

1635
00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:21.540
<v Speaker 7>weighed the same.</v>

1636
00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.030
<v Speaker 7>You wait around while he looked 40 might've been leaner.</v>

1637
00:45:24.031 --> 00:45:28.640
<v Speaker 7>Like he look more shredded and this they just look like he looked perhaps better</v>

1638
00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:31.320
<v Speaker 7>to what might've been leaner John Fish's body.</v>

1639
00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:32.040
<v Speaker 7>Did you say John?</v>

1640

<v Speaker 7>I was crazy.</v>

1641
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:33.490
<v Speaker 7>Crazy.</v>

1642
00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:34.323
<v Speaker 7>Shredded,</v>

1643
00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:35.540
<v Speaker 7>shredded.</v>

1644
00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:37.580
<v Speaker 7>I never seen him like he used to be like Mike.</v>

1645
00:45:37.581 --> 00:45:38.111
<v Speaker 7>Just see,</v>

1646
00:45:38.111 --> 00:45:38.944
<v Speaker 7>I know I,</v>

1647
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:39.750
<v Speaker 7>he stopped.</v>

1648
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:40.710
<v Speaker 7>He stopped being a Vegan,</v>

1649
00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:41.670
<v Speaker 7>started eating meat again.</v>

1650
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:43.200
<v Speaker 7>Oh God.</v>

1651
00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:45.391
<v Speaker 7>She'll,</v>

1652
00:45:45.391 --> 00:45:46.690
<v Speaker 7>she'll stop being a vegan doe.</v>

1653
00:45:46.691 --> 00:45:47.170
<v Speaker 7>He's still a,</v>

1654
00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:48.003
<v Speaker 7>and I just talked to him.</v>

1655
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:49.410
<v Speaker 7>What'd you guys think of that?</v>

1656
00:45:49.411 --> 00:45:49.880
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1657
00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:50.501
<v Speaker 7>Rusa Mark Paul,</v>

1658
00:45:50.501 --> 00:45:55.501
<v Speaker 7>Horace minibar nasty trash dude monsters and he gets a hold of it.</v>

1659
00:45:55.741 --> 00:45:56.640
<v Speaker 7>You know what?</v>

1660
00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:57.030
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>

1661
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.301
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

1662
00:45:57.301 --> 00:46:01.890
<v Speaker 7>I think he's held on to submissions way too long in the past.</v>

1663
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:03.340
<v Speaker 7>But this one was saying it is,</v>

1664
00:46:03.341 --> 00:46:03.780
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

1665
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:04.890
<v Speaker 7>People were saying it was too long.</v>

1666
00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:05.581
<v Speaker 7>Here's the deal.</v>

1667
00:46:05.581 --> 00:46:06.750
<v Speaker 7>If it was any other submission,</v>

1668
00:46:06.751 --> 00:46:08.670
<v Speaker 7>it was an arm bar or rear naked choke.</v>

1669
00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:09.790
<v Speaker 7>No one have a problem with it.</v>

1670
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:13.320
<v Speaker 7>It's the fact that it's a heal hook and then it transitioned to a knee bar and</v>

1671
00:46:13.321 --> 00:46:17.280
<v Speaker 7>everybody's thinking about their knee exploding and you know that where the heel</v>

1672
00:46:17.281 --> 00:46:17.491
<v Speaker 7>hook,</v>

1673
00:46:17.491 --> 00:46:18.324
<v Speaker 7>especially,</v>

1674
00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:19.350
<v Speaker 7>you don't have any time,</v>

1675
00:46:19.351 --> 00:46:20.184
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

1676
00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:21.570
<v Speaker 7>by the time you're hurting.</v>

1677
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:22.201
<v Speaker 7>Oh Jesus.</v>

1678
00:46:22.201 --> 00:46:22.671
<v Speaker 7>Too late.</v>

1679
00:46:22.671 --> 00:46:23.431
<v Speaker 7>How has his knee,</v>

1680
00:46:23.431 --> 00:46:23.821
<v Speaker 7>it's okay,</v>

1681
00:46:23.821 --> 00:46:24.180
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1682
00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.013
<v Speaker 7>It's fucked.</v>

1683
00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:26.080
<v Speaker 7>Fucked.</v>

1684
00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.180
<v Speaker 7>I look at the position as needs in price.</v>

1685
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:29.310
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't mean anything.</v>

1686
00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:30.153
<v Speaker 7>Tour,</v>

1687
00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:34.620
<v Speaker 7>try to need someone in the face.</v>

1688
00:46:34.621 --> 00:46:35.670
<v Speaker 7>They're not holding back.</v>

1689
00:46:35.671 --> 00:46:36.990
<v Speaker 7>It's not 80% power.</v>

1690
00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.530
<v Speaker 7>It's either trying to put their knee through your faith,</v>

1691
00:46:39.531 --> 00:46:40.380
<v Speaker 7>100% power,</v>

1692
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:43.680
<v Speaker 7>as many motherfucking times they can and the referee stops it.</v>

1693
00:46:43.681 --> 00:46:43.980
<v Speaker 7>It's fine.</v>

1694
00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:45.120
<v Speaker 7>So when you get injured with,</v>

1695
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:46.290
<v Speaker 7>with little joint locks,</v>

1696
00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:47.760
<v Speaker 7>personally for me,</v>

1697
00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:49.320
<v Speaker 7>I do Jujitsu.</v>

1698
00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:50.370
<v Speaker 7>That's just part of the game.</v>

1699
00:46:50.371 --> 00:46:50.791
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>

1700
00:46:50.791 --> 00:46:50.971
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1701
00:46:50.971 --> 00:46:52.440
<v Speaker 7>He held it on a little bit long,</v>

1702
00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:53.580
<v Speaker 7>but that's MMA.</v>

1703
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:54.720
<v Speaker 7>It was a Jujitsu match.</v>

1704
00:46:54.721 --> 00:46:55.260
<v Speaker 7>That's a big,</v>

1705
00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:56.460
<v Speaker 7>he's so good at that.</v>

1706
00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:57.323
<v Speaker 7>His opponent,</v>

1707
00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.280
<v Speaker 7>his face.</v>

1708
00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:59.610
<v Speaker 7>But he didn't even in this fight,</v>

1709
00:46:59.710 --> 00:46:59.970
<v Speaker 7>he,</v>

1710
00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:02.880
<v Speaker 7>I mean it was like literally he's holding onto it.</v>

1711
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.100
<v Speaker 7>John fitches tapping the referee grabs.</v>

1712
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.983
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1713
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.480
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1714
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.200
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's not,</v>

1715
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:11.580
<v Speaker 7>he's in the past held on the shift and the referees pulling on his arms and he</v>

1716
00:47:11.581 --> 00:47:12.420
<v Speaker 7>won't let go.</v>

1717
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:13.680
<v Speaker 7>He doesn't do that.</v>

1718
00:47:13.681 --> 00:47:15.080
<v Speaker 7>And then the issue they have is because,</v>

1719
00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:15.570
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1720
00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:17.130
<v Speaker 7>fitches tapping and you didn't let go.</v>

1721
00:47:17.131 --> 00:47:19.050
<v Speaker 7>He doesn't like go to the ref stops you.</v>

1722
00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:19.831
<v Speaker 7>You're not supposed to.</v>

1723
00:47:19.831 --> 00:47:20.221
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

1724
00:47:20.221 --> 00:47:21.570
<v Speaker 7>What people don't know is in the back.</v>

1725
00:47:21.571 --> 00:47:22.680
<v Speaker 7>The Ref says that,</v>

1726
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:23.790
<v Speaker 7>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1727
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:25.590
<v Speaker 7>So he's trained to do that.</v>

1728
00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:29.410
<v Speaker 7>He's so strong.</v>

1729
00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:30.310
<v Speaker 7>He's five</v>

1730
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:32.410
<v Speaker 5>foot seven and a half or something like that.</v>

1731
00:47:32.411 --> 00:47:35.680
<v Speaker 5>So he's all muscle and all gorilla bones.</v>

1732
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:37.750
<v Speaker 5>And did he see how we drive the rail tendons?</v>

1733
00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.130
<v Speaker 5>Did you notice that he pulled guard?</v>

1734
00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:39.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1735
00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:40.090
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1736
00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:41.700
<v Speaker 5>He was not John Fitch down.</v>

1737
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:41.891
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

1738
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:42.040
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1739
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.360
<v Speaker 5>he needs John Pitch on the ground.</v>

1740
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:47.510
<v Speaker 5>How the fuck is a Brazilian gonna take a wrestler down if you're not Damien</v>

1741
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.560
<v Speaker 5>Meyer,</v>

1742
00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.700
<v Speaker 5>he's the only guy that's doing it.</v>

1743
00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:49.151
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1744
00:47:49.151 --> 00:47:49.500
<v Speaker 5>he did it.</v>

1745
00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.730
<v Speaker 5>You're just like stupid little single shot.</v>

1746
00:47:51.731 --> 00:47:54.340
<v Speaker 5>And then he pulled guard right into a heel.</v>

1747
00:47:54.341 --> 00:47:58.480
<v Speaker 5>So I don't think anybody knows what a heel hook really feels like until that guy</v>

1748
00:47:58.481 --> 00:47:59.410
<v Speaker 5>gets a hold of your legs.</v>

1749
00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.680
<v Speaker 5>So people that are against pulling guard right there.</v>

1750
00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:06.790
<v Speaker 5>That was a perfect example of a guy he could not take down,</v>

1751
00:48:06.791 --> 00:48:08.380
<v Speaker 5>but he's still got them down anyways.</v>

1752
00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:09.880
<v Speaker 5>He's so dangerous.</v>

1753
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:11.650
<v Speaker 5>It's one of those things that people forget about.</v>

1754
00:48:11.651 --> 00:48:12.221
<v Speaker 5>Horrifying.</v>

1755
00:48:12.221 --> 00:48:13.080
<v Speaker 5>I was scared.</v>

1756
00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.400
<v Speaker 5>He's horrifying cause he's going to mangle your leg.</v>

1757
00:48:15.401 --> 00:48:16.310
<v Speaker 5>You're not even gonna train.</v>

1758
00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:17.170
<v Speaker 5>Never going to be the same.</v>

1759
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:18.200
<v Speaker 5>You won't even try.</v>

1760
00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:20.410
<v Speaker 5>You know what you can be as they're going to fight.</v>

1761
00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:21.011
<v Speaker 5>Rusa Marple,</v>

1762
00:48:21.011 --> 00:48:22.480
<v Speaker 5>Horace tap early.</v>

1763
00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:30.810
<v Speaker 5>Alan Belcher not only did the best anybody's ever done at dealing with his</v>

1764
00:48:31.061 --> 00:48:33.760
<v Speaker 5>ground game and being caught up in it and defending,</v>

1765
00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:37.000
<v Speaker 5>he also put out a video on what John Fitch did wrong,</v>

1766
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:38.080
<v Speaker 5>which John Fitch should have done.</v>

1767
00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:38.280
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1768
00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:38.940
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1769
00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:39.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1770
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:39.560
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1771
00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:39.860
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1772
00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:40.000
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1773
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:40.240
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1774
00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:43.690
<v Speaker 5>He went into the fire and literally stopped all of Paula Harris stuff.</v>

1775
00:48:43.691 --> 00:48:44.730
<v Speaker 5>Literally caught up.</v>

1776
00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:45.940
<v Speaker 5>Not too long to see that.</v>

1777
00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:47.140
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1778
00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:47.950
<v Speaker 5>pull it up.</v>

1779
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:48.610
<v Speaker 5>Pull that up.</v>

1780
00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:49.150
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1781
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:51.220
<v Speaker 5>Alan Belcher versus who?</v>

1782
00:48:51.221 --> 00:48:51.970
<v Speaker 5>Some Paul.</v>

1783
00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:52.121
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1784
00:48:52.121 --> 00:48:54.070
<v Speaker 5>You put it on that because we don't want to steal any,</v>

1785
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:55.960
<v Speaker 5>any hitters from your computer.</v>

1786
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.141
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1787
00:48:56.141 --> 00:48:56.510
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>

1788
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.891
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1789
00:48:56.891 --> 00:48:57.700
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

1790
00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:57.971
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1791
00:48:57.971 --> 00:48:58.990
<v Speaker 5>let's see what we could find it here.</v>

1792
00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:02.740
<v Speaker 5>I saw him like two weeks after that event and I was like,</v>

1793
00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:03.800
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1794
00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:04.660
<v Speaker 5>just something like that.</v>

1795
00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:05.150
<v Speaker 5>Branding,</v>

1796
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.411
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

1797
00:49:05.411 --> 00:49:06.244
<v Speaker 5>just the,</v>

1798
00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:10.610
<v Speaker 5>you can get as good with leg blocks as recent,</v>

1799
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:11.320
<v Speaker 5>more porous.</v>

1800
00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.730
<v Speaker 5>You can get that good.</v>

1801
00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:16.660
<v Speaker 5>And if you are in a situation where you needed to get this fight to the ground,</v>

1802
00:49:16.661 --> 00:49:18.490
<v Speaker 5>the guy was too much dangerous of the striker.</v>

1803
00:49:18.491 --> 00:49:19.470
<v Speaker 5>But you couldn't take him down to him.</v>

1804
00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:19.720
<v Speaker 5>Go.</v>

1805
00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:21.310
<v Speaker 5>You could pull guard with those heel hooks.</v>

1806
00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:22.060
<v Speaker 5>You can do it.</v>

1807
00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:22.661
<v Speaker 5>Anybody can do it.</v>

1808
00:49:22.661 --> 00:49:23.500
<v Speaker 5>They just got to work on it.</v>

1809
00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:24.423
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1810
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:25.743
<v Speaker 5>Let's see this now.</v>

1811
00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.420
<v Speaker 5>Profit Alan Belcher.</v>

1812
00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:31.730
<v Speaker 5>Let me kill us all on this motherfucker.</v>

1813
00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.370
<v Speaker 5>He's a good dude too.</v>

1814
00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:36.490
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

1815
00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:38.010
<v Speaker 5>the Brendan Schaub comeback.</v>

1816
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:39.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't hear anything in this.</v>

1817
00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:43.560
<v Speaker 5>This is the first 45 minutes of the movie rise of the night rising.</v>

1818
00:49:43.561 --> 00:49:44.021
<v Speaker 5>Good Brown.</v>

1819
00:49:44.021 --> 00:49:44.780
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

1820
00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:47.780
<v Speaker 9>And then also I'm going to show how maybe you could get,</v>

1821
00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:51.140
<v Speaker 9>do something a little bit better amount of say John Fish did something wrong.</v>

1822
00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:56.000
<v Speaker 9>A lot of people made the same mistake and a couple of days and look out for it.</v>

1823
00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:57.410
<v Speaker 9>So first off,</v>

1824
00:49:58.180 --> 00:49:58.650
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1825
00:49:58.650 --> 00:49:59.440
<v Speaker 9>probably ours,</v>

1826
00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:02.690
<v Speaker 9>the way that he gets to the leg locks a lot of times is he got the attacks the</v>

1827
00:50:02.691 --> 00:50:05.690
<v Speaker 9>legs on a single leg or double leg and then drops under this.</v>

1828
00:50:05.691 --> 00:50:07.790
<v Speaker 9>Take him that he did and was on the outside.</v>

1829
00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:12.350
<v Speaker 9>And then he started lifting the leg almost like he was going to switch to a</v>

1830
00:50:12.351 --> 00:50:13.184
<v Speaker 9>double leg.</v>

1831
00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:16.940
<v Speaker 9>And he does it with the perfect Tommy with a lot of his tech techniques.</v>

1832
00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:21.890
<v Speaker 9>He does a really good like set up by faking the take down.</v>

1833
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:25.190
<v Speaker 9>It lifts a leg or right when the guy just to it,</v>

1834
00:50:25.191 --> 00:50:27.260
<v Speaker 9>that's when he dropped underneath.</v>

1835
00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 9>Yup.</v>

1836
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.270
<v Speaker 9>Right under the leg and starts to attack the,</v>

1837
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:32.150
<v Speaker 9>the a leg lock right here.</v>

1838
00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:33.800
<v Speaker 9>So John Fitch did a good job</v>

1839
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.400
<v Speaker 9>to put his weight on the leg and,</v>

1840
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:38.960
<v Speaker 9>and start to go like this.</v>

1841
00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:42.410
<v Speaker 9>So my rs locks his legs over here.</v>

1842
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:44.330
<v Speaker 9>Can you come around this side for me?</v>

1843
00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Alan Belcher really breaks down who some are.</v>

1844
00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:52.370
<v Speaker 1>Paul Horez versus John Fitch.</v>

1845
00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:53.383
<v Speaker 1>The knee inside.</v>

1846
00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:56.280
<v Speaker 1>I know you're not going to spell this right.</v>

1847
00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:57.961
<v Speaker 1>Alan Belcher.</v>

1848
00:50:57.961 --> 00:50:58.794
<v Speaker 1>John Fitch</v>

1849
00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.240
<v Speaker 9>move and I have it trapped here.</v>

1850
00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:07.080
<v Speaker 9>So part of ours continues to twist here until he finally knocks Fitch down.</v>

1851
00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:10.840
<v Speaker 9>And then he starts to attack this hill,</v>

1852
00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.510
<v Speaker 9>but bringing his wrist underneath here,</v>

1853
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:16.990
<v Speaker 9>but his hand and then pulling on his hand like this right here.</v>

1854
00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:22.480
<v Speaker 9>And what he wants to do is tighten up the legs and push the toes back and get a</v>

1855
00:51:22.481 --> 00:51:23.740
<v Speaker 9>heel hook just like that.</v>

1856
00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:25.263
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

1857
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:29.500
<v Speaker 9>So what Fitch was doing here was unraveling his feet a little bit,</v>

1858
00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:30.251
<v Speaker 9>openness feed up,</v>

1859
00:51:30.251 --> 00:51:32.170
<v Speaker 9>trying to take this off by artist,</v>

1860
00:51:32.171 --> 00:51:34.300
<v Speaker 9>wants to bring this over,</v>

1861
00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:35.500
<v Speaker 9>just like that.</v>

1862
00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:38.650
<v Speaker 9>And he was making space cutting his knee across,</v>

1863
00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.250
<v Speaker 9>and then Fitch was also straightened his leg out.</v>

1864
00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:42.560
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

1865
00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:47.560
<v Speaker 9>What pilates does though is he squeezes the knees and he brings this,</v>

1866
00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:51.250
<v Speaker 9>he keeps twisting it even though it's straight and he's expecting the guy to</v>

1867
00:51:51.251 --> 00:51:54.040
<v Speaker 9>roll out because the pressure I'm putting makes them spin.</v>

1868
00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:55.480
<v Speaker 9>But as he spins,</v>

1869
00:51:55.481 --> 00:51:56.770
<v Speaker 9>I turned back the other way,</v>

1870
00:51:57.250 --> 00:51:59.830
<v Speaker 9>which helps break his knee more,</v>

1871
00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:03.850
<v Speaker 9>but also puts me right into a physician for a knee bar.</v>

1872
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:09.150
<v Speaker 9>So now he locks his figure four right above the knee and he keeps this grew up</v>

1873
00:52:10.391 --> 00:52:15.340
<v Speaker 9>here and he can thrust his hips down while I pull in this street and actually</v>

1874
00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.380
<v Speaker 9>twist in the hill.</v>

1875
00:52:16.381 --> 00:52:17.340
<v Speaker 9>Also at the same time.</v>

1876
00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:22.030
<v Speaker 9>It helps if you don't have side a little bit and you can see in the fight</v>

1877
00:52:22.031 --> 00:52:23.230
<v Speaker 9>pirates got on his side.</v>

1878
00:52:23.231 --> 00:52:27.280
<v Speaker 9>I think it might've been all the way go this way to this side here</v>

1879
00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:31.410
<v Speaker 1>was actually elevated that he actually elevated me hands back,</v>

1880
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.701
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

1881
00:52:31.701 --> 00:52:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I can feel more room.</v>

1882
00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:36.520
<v Speaker 9>It's almost as if I have this behind my arm.</v>

1883
00:52:36.521 --> 00:52:41.470
<v Speaker 9>It shows really strong and I twist the hill booming and I fussed my hips.</v>

1884
00:52:41.471 --> 00:52:42.380
<v Speaker 9>They're getting the tap.</v>

1885
00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:44.620
<v Speaker 9>All right.</v>

1886
00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:46.060
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

1887
00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:46.893
<v Speaker 9>So</v>

1888
00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:51.060
<v Speaker 1>they probably too long for us to want to see what he should have done though.</v>

1889
00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1890
00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:54.970
<v Speaker 1>but this is going to be so long time for people that are listening to this</v>

1891
00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:56.163
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

1892
00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:58.900
<v Speaker 1>Go Watch it.</v>

1893
00:52:58.930 --> 00:52:59.890
<v Speaker 1>We'll watch it after the show,</v>

1894
00:52:59.891 --> 00:53:00.820
<v Speaker 1>but I want to give a,</v>

1895
00:53:00.821 --> 00:53:03.820
<v Speaker 1>I also want to get Alan as many hits on this as possible.</v>

1896
00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:05.440
<v Speaker 1>So if you go to Alan Belcher's,</v>

1897
00:53:05.441 --> 00:53:06.640
<v Speaker 1>a youtube page,</v>

1898
00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:08.620
<v Speaker 1>it's Alan Belcher breaks down who?</v>

1899
00:53:08.621 --> 00:53:09.401
<v Speaker 1>Some are Paul Harris.</v>

1900
00:53:09.401 --> 00:53:11.740
<v Speaker 1>But this shit is like 1520 minutes long or something.</v>

1901
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:14.370
<v Speaker 1>It actually,</v>

1902
00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:16.380
<v Speaker 1>it's only 11 minutes but</v>

1903
00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:20.613
<v Speaker 1>pretty dope though.</v>

1904
00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to sell it Belcher.</v>

1905
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:23.320
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see how he defends it.</v>

1906
00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Who did a better,</v>

1907
00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 1>no one's a better job at defending</v>

1908
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:26.933
<v Speaker 3>leg locks,</v>

1909
00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:27.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1910
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:27.751
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1911
00:53:27.751 --> 00:53:28.680
<v Speaker 3>in the octagon,</v>

1912
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:29.610
<v Speaker 3>in front of the world.</v>

1913
00:53:29.611 --> 00:53:31.110
<v Speaker 3>Millions of people pay per view.</v>

1914
00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:32.340
<v Speaker 3>Then Alan Belcher,</v>

1915
00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:33.360
<v Speaker 3>he rusa,</v>

1916
00:53:33.361 --> 00:53:35.460
<v Speaker 3>Marco Horace was all over his legs.</v>

1917
00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:38.370
<v Speaker 3>He had five different intents that his legs.</v>

1918
00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:43.380
<v Speaker 3>And what Alan Belcher did is he flew dean lister in for that camp and he flew in</v>

1919
00:53:43.381 --> 00:53:44.670
<v Speaker 3>a guy named Davi Ramos,</v>

1920
00:53:44.671 --> 00:53:46.590
<v Speaker 3>who's a leg lock wizards.</v>

1921
00:53:46.591 --> 00:53:51.480
<v Speaker 3>And he just had those guys jump on his legs for two months straight.</v>

1922
00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:54.120
<v Speaker 3>And he said the first couple of weeks he was tapping left and right.</v>

1923
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:57.090
<v Speaker 3>But after a while he learned how to stop that.</v>

1924
00:53:57.091 --> 00:53:57.780
<v Speaker 3>And I have,</v>

1925
00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:01.530
<v Speaker 3>and then it just became instinct and then he became impossible to tap with,</v>

1926
00:54:01.531 --> 00:54:01.841
<v Speaker 3>like lost.</v>

1927
00:54:01.841 --> 00:54:03.210
<v Speaker 3>So you just have to walk through the fire.</v>

1928
00:54:03.211 --> 00:54:05.880
<v Speaker 3>You just have to go through all those taps and not worry about it.</v>

1929
00:54:05.881 --> 00:54:06.960
<v Speaker 3>Just know you're going to get through it.</v>

1930
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:08.503
<v Speaker 3>And no matter what,</v>

1931
00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:09.683
<v Speaker 3>no matter what,</v>

1932
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:12.870
<v Speaker 3>unless you have some kind of brain defect,</v>

1933
00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:15.480
<v Speaker 3>you put yourself in those bad spots long enough,</v>

1934
00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.920
<v Speaker 3>you will figure it out.</v>

1935
00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:17.531
<v Speaker 3>It was a stress,</v>

1936
00:54:17.531 --> 00:54:18.090
<v Speaker 3>the Ba.</v>

1937
00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:19.110
<v Speaker 3>Then after a while you're like,</v>

1938
00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:20.141
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1939
00:54:20.141 --> 00:54:21.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm worried about this at all.</v>

1940
00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:22.800
<v Speaker 3>Not only do I not worry about it,</v>

1941
00:54:22.801 --> 00:54:24.060
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to attack from there.</v>

1942
00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1943
00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Someone's an alcoholic.</v>

1944
00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:30.750
<v Speaker 2>Dee Dee Dee Dee.</v>

1945
00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:32.260
<v Speaker 2>I got a drink and a couple of bottles.</v>

1946
00:54:32.261 --> 00:54:33.094
<v Speaker 2>Deep Humbug.</v>

1947
00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:33.933
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1948
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1949
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:39.750
<v Speaker 2>so I think we probably talked enough about Brendan shop and branch ops career.</v>

1950
00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:40.893
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1951
00:54:41.290 --> 00:54:42.123
<v Speaker 2>I love you guys.</v>

1952
00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:43.510
<v Speaker 2>Are you guys allowed to pull out,</v>

1953
00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:43.841
<v Speaker 2>pull out?</v>

1954
00:54:43.841 --> 00:54:45.220
<v Speaker 2>You have to shoot right past fights.</v>

1955

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is fade or versus Nogueira.</v>

1982
00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:24.730
<v Speaker 2>This is the first one.</v>

1983
00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:25.983
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1984
00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:27.370

00:55:27.521 --> 00:55:28.110
<v Speaker 2>We can hear it.</v>

1987
00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:28.360
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1988
00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:30.580
<v Speaker 2>so Wilfredo was a sambo world champion.</v>

1989
00:55:30.581 --> 00:55:31.750
<v Speaker 2>What is his background?</v>

1990
00:55:31.751 --> 00:55:32.590
<v Speaker 2>Combat Samba,</v>

1991
00:55:32.591 --> 00:55:33.850
<v Speaker 2>which is a different style.</v>

1992
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:34.380
<v Speaker 2>Sambo.</v>

1993
00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:34.890
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

1994
00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:35.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1995
00:55:35.410 --> 00:55:36.910
<v Speaker 2>a samba that also has,</v>

1996
00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:37.773
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1997
00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:38.980
<v Speaker 2>they have a lot of,</v>

1998
00:55:38.981 --> 00:55:39.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1999
00:55:39.790 --> 00:55:43.870
<v Speaker 2>strikes in it and they were the geek jacket and a head gear.</v>

2000
00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:44.471
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2001
00:55:44.471 --> 00:55:44.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2002
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:47.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how long they've been competing like that,</v>

2003
00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:50.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's essentially like MMA and a lot of ways</v>

2004
00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:53.691
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2005
00:55:53.691 --> 00:55:55.040
<v Speaker 1>So he's a good fight.</v>

2006
00:55:55.041 --> 00:55:57.390
<v Speaker 1>The great fight that he's kept that have hands in a</v>

2007

2011

<v Speaker 1>This was 10 years ago.</v>

2012
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:12.670
<v Speaker 1>I think I got a little bit more technically even stayed my favorite Brazilian</v>

2013
00:56:13.071 --> 00:56:16.760
<v Speaker 1>fighter of all time by far back in the day.</v>

2014
00:56:16.761 --> 00:56:18.350
<v Speaker 1>He was a motherfucker.</v>

2015
00:56:18.590 --> 00:56:22.640
<v Speaker 1>He was the first heavyweight that came along and it showed like real legit</v>

2016
00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:23.513
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>

00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:24.480

2018
00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2019
00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:25.181
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2020
00:56:25.181 --> 00:56:26.200
<v Speaker 1>We can go through all this.</v>

2021
00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:29.700
<v Speaker 1>That'll shut God fatal or looks yelling to babyface.</v>

2022
00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:31.513
<v Speaker 1>Huddle shy.</v>

2023
00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:33.053
<v Speaker 1>Not</v>

2024
00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:38.920
<v Speaker 1>Missing a lot of the uh,</v>

2025
00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:42.880
<v Speaker 1>the big scars that he developed later in his career.</v>

2026
00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2027
00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:44.201
<v Speaker 1>really bad,</v>

2028
00:56:44.201 --> 00:56:44.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2029
00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:44.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2030
00:56:44.891 --> 00:56:45.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2031
00:56:45.101 --> 00:56:46.810
<v Speaker 1>He got Scott some scar tissue,</v>

2032
00:56:46.811 --> 00:56:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Russian mafia eyes also.</v>

2033
00:56:48.431 --> 00:56:49.750
<v Speaker 1>His body changed.</v>

2034
00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:49.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2035
00:56:49.991 --> 00:56:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Look how calm he is.</v>

2036
00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:54.100
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the weirdest things about fate or when he would fight.</v>

2037
00:56:54.130 --> 00:56:55.270
<v Speaker 1>That's like Carla Esparza.</v>

2038
00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Did you see her when she came out and fought Bros?</v>

2039
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:59.303
<v Speaker 1>Nama jewelry?</v>

2040
00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Does she actually,</v>

2041
00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:01.300
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2042
00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:02.111
<v Speaker 1>it was almost,</v>

2043
00:57:02.111 --> 00:57:03.160
<v Speaker 1>she was so calm.</v>

2044
00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:06.250
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't know that was like her little thing,</v>

2045
00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:08.410
<v Speaker 1>you would think she was petrified.</v>

2046
00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:09.333
<v Speaker 1>She was just like the,</v>

2047
00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:11.643
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2048
00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:16.250
<v Speaker 1>and rose is all like just dancing around and just shaking on her side.</v>

2049
00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Carla's not even moving,</v>

2050
00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:18.850
<v Speaker 1>not even an inch.</v>

2051
00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:19.571
<v Speaker 1>Look at this shit.</v>

2052
00:57:19.571 --> 00:57:21.280
<v Speaker 1>They have the national anthem back then.</v>

2053
00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Did you remember that?</v>

2054
00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:23.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't say that.</v>

2055
00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:25.610
<v Speaker 1>That's a booster Martha,</v>

2056
00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:25.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2057
00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Amarillo Bustamonte Mario Sperry with fucking black hair.</v>

2058
00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:29.680
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

2059
00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.230
<v Speaker 1>There's little cheerio.</v>

2060
00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:32.423
<v Speaker 1>Cheerio man.</v>

2061
00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:34.863
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

2062
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:36.140
<v Speaker 1>Got a nose on</v>

2063
00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:38.720
<v Speaker 1>trials off.</v>

2064
00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:41.620
<v Speaker 1>It'd be trade shit.</v>

2065
00:57:41.621 --> 00:57:42.101
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>

2066
00:57:42.101 --> 00:57:43.060
<v Speaker 1>why did you lose weight?</v>

2067
00:57:43.061 --> 00:57:43.894
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

2068
00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Did you just forget?</v>

2069
00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:49.600
<v Speaker 1>I put the pressure on you,</v>

2070
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:50.703
<v Speaker 1>the hips,</v>

2071
00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:51.880
<v Speaker 1>or you can get that crowd.</v>

2072
00:57:51.881 --> 00:57:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Look how quiet the crowd is.</v>

2073
00:57:53.051 --> 00:57:56.530
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing that was weird about watching fights in Japan when we were</v>

2074
00:57:56.531 --> 00:57:57.520
<v Speaker 1>there for the UFC.</v>

2075
00:57:57.790 --> 00:57:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was told me it was like that.</v>

2076
00:57:59.171 --> 00:58:00.160
<v Speaker 1>But when you see it live,</v>

2077
00:58:00.161 --> 00:58:00.971
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

2078
00:58:00.971 --> 00:58:01.411
<v Speaker 1>they would just,</v>

2079
00:58:01.411 --> 00:58:01.691
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2080
00:58:01.691 --> 00:58:03.730
<v Speaker 1>they've changed since the old days.</v>

2081
00:58:03.731 --> 00:58:05.050
<v Speaker 1>The old days it was dead silent.</v>

2082
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Now they clap and cheer a little bit because it's becoming a little bit more</v>

2083
00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:09.340
<v Speaker 1>auditions and stuff.</v>

2084
00:58:09.341 --> 00:58:11.310
<v Speaker 1>That's trendy thing now.</v>

2085
00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:12.633
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

2086
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.541
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

2087
00:58:13.541 --> 00:58:14.440
<v Speaker 1>We gotta go to the beginning.</v>

2088
00:58:14.441 --> 00:58:14.901
<v Speaker 1>I just want to see,</v>

2089
00:58:14.901 --> 00:58:17.260
<v Speaker 1>to take how to fight or to kind of talk.</v>

2090
00:58:17.370 --> 00:58:18.570
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't look out and look at it.</v>

2091
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:19.270
<v Speaker 1>He'll get it.</v>

2092
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:20.230
<v Speaker 1>He's tired or back then.</v>

2093
00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:22.631
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

2094
00:58:22.631 --> 00:58:23.820
<v Speaker 1>He never used to look.</v>

2095
00:58:23.821 --> 00:58:24.730
<v Speaker 1>He always looks down.</v>

2096
00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:26.450
<v Speaker 1>He was thick back then.</v>

2097
00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:29.560
<v Speaker 1>It was later in his career fate or like slimmed out.</v>

2098
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:31.210
<v Speaker 1>He got a lot smaller,</v>

2099
00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:32.770
<v Speaker 1>super thick back then.</v>

2100
00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:37.120
<v Speaker 1>He sees a lot of kettle bells and a lot of power lifting back then,</v>

2101
00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:40.300
<v Speaker 1>but he decided somewhere along the line that's skill training was more</v>

2102
00:58:40.301 --> 00:58:41.134
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>

2103
00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:42.850
<v Speaker 1>but I think that you need both,</v>

2104
00:58:42.851 --> 00:58:43.121
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2105
00:58:43.121 --> 00:58:43.954
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

2106
00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2107
00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:49.240
<v Speaker 1>but I mean there's all so many variables involved in old fader that made him a</v>

2108
00:58:49.241 --> 00:58:50.074
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>

2109
00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Just a strength is only one of them.</v>

2110
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:54.400
<v Speaker 1>The other thing was just,</v>

2111
00:58:54.401 --> 00:58:59.401
<v Speaker 1>he was just so fucking ferocious tiger mom time and fast too for heavyweight</v>

2112
00:58:59.621 --> 00:58:59.831
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2113
00:58:59.831 --> 00:59:01.060
<v Speaker 1>deceptively fast.</v>

2114
00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Stand right there.</v>

2115
00:59:02.591 --> 00:59:03.424
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

2116
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:07.330
<v Speaker 1>He also had a really good technical approach to MMA man.</v>

2117
00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:10.660
<v Speaker 1>He just would explode so fast,</v>

2118
00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:11.770
<v Speaker 1>so fast,</v>

2119
00:59:11.771 --> 00:59:12.604
<v Speaker 1>but he's fucking,</v>

2120
00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:15.020
<v Speaker 1>and it's everything he throws is like a Mac out.</v>

2121
00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:15.911
<v Speaker 1>What's the latest?</v>

2122
00:59:15.911 --> 00:59:16.780
<v Speaker 1>He's still retired.</v>

2123
00:59:16.781 --> 00:59:17.620
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want to come back.</v>

2124
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:19.480
<v Speaker 1>He's done man.</v>

2125
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:20.081
<v Speaker 1>He's smart.</v>

2126
00:59:20.081 --> 00:59:22.090
<v Speaker 1>He knew that those last few fights,</v>

2127
00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:24.560
<v Speaker 1>just not the same guys we're looking at right here.</v>

2128
00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.390
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at the dude in his prime here.</v>

2129
00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:29.000
<v Speaker 1>This is 2000 for 10 fucking years ago.</v>

2130
00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:34.060
<v Speaker 1>Brain was pictures thing is the 2004 there was nobody like him.</v>

2131
00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Nobody had come along before like him.</v>

2132
00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Nobody,</v>

2133
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:42.980
<v Speaker 1>nobody could whip off arm bars off their back the way he could and still throw</v>

2134
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:45.440
<v Speaker 1>fucking serious hands on their feet.</v>

2135
00:59:45.441 --> 00:59:46.274
<v Speaker 1>The way he cooks.</v>

2136
00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:47.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we've seen anyone like him.</v>

2137
00:59:47.931 --> 00:59:50.690
<v Speaker 1>As far as the light changes and UFC fight,</v>

2138
00:59:50.691 --> 00:59:52.310
<v Speaker 1>his face stays completely the same.</v>

2139
00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Well he always said that they'll like showing emotion is showing weakness.</v>

2140
00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2141
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Nogueira with that fucking wrist control setup,</v>

2142
00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:58.671

<v Speaker 1>that was his shit.</v>

2144
00:59:59.490 --> 01:00:00.860
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even look like you warmed up.</v>

2145
01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:01.281
<v Speaker 1>Like he just,</v>

2146
01:00:01.281 --> 01:00:02.001

<v Speaker 1>Take my shower.</v>

2150
01:00:05.661 --> 01:00:07.190
<v Speaker 1>I was playing cards about 10 minutes ago.</v>

2151
01:00:07.850 --> 01:00:08.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fight.</v>

2152
01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.530
<v Speaker 1>I had to fight hard to see,</v>

2153
01:00:09.531 --> 01:00:09.840
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2154
01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean if we remember his brother and his gnarliest tat,</v>

2155
01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I was like the grim reaper holding a baby right now.</v>

2156
01:00:17.241 --> 01:00:19.580
<v Speaker 1>He's in jail right now I think for rape.</v>

2157
01:00:19.581 --> 01:00:20.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he got out.</v>

2158
01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:22.610
<v Speaker 1>His brother did a lot of crazy shit.</v>

2159
01:00:22.611 --> 01:00:24.770
<v Speaker 1>There's some video of his brother drunk off his ass.</v>

2160
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Magic.</v>

2161
01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:29.040
<v Speaker 1>That guy being drunk and being mad at you crust raping you</v>

2162
01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.550
<v Speaker 1>or be mad at you and raping you.</v>

2163
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:34.543
<v Speaker 1>No thank you.</v>

2164
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:36.230
<v Speaker 1>And I mean you</v>

2165
01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>don't even meet a girl.</v>

2166
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:40.850
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about as me was framed.</v>

2167
01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.980
<v Speaker 1>I believe he was framed by the Illuminati.</v>

2168
01:00:42.981 --> 01:00:44.600
<v Speaker 1>I think he was going to drop the bomb.</v>

2169
01:00:44.601 --> 01:00:45.434
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

2170
01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:47.060
<v Speaker 1>You don't what?</v>

2171
01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.700
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get some girls you're fucked.</v>

2172
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:50.540
<v Speaker 1>That's what I,</v>

2173
01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:51.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he did that.</v>

2174
01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:59.090
<v Speaker 1>He was going to drop a bomb about the CIA's involvement in Oh shit.</v>

2175
01:00:59.091 --> 01:01:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Cause cause you want we're listen,</v>

2176
01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:05.540
<v Speaker 1>listen failure with some fucking ferocious ground and pound from inside the big</v>

2177
01:01:05.541 --> 01:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Nog got those scars from being run over by a truck I think as a kid was just the</v>

2178
01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:09.441
<v Speaker 1>one on his back.</v>

2179
01:01:09.441 --> 01:01:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2180
01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah it is back.</v>

2181
01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:15.080
<v Speaker 1>He was in a coma for like a long time or in the hospital I think for like a</v>

2182
01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:15.913
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

2183
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:19.080
<v Speaker 1>But they do feed him vitamins and milk won't happen.</v>

2184
01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Vitamins and milk,</v>

2185
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:22.210
<v Speaker 1>milk,</v>

2186
01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:23.043
<v Speaker 1>milk,</v>

2187
01:01:23.590 --> 01:01:24.740
<v Speaker 1>milk to a baby.</v>

2188
01:01:24.850 --> 01:01:25.683
<v Speaker 1>It's bones.</v>

2189
01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:27.411
<v Speaker 1>It's got to think about this.</v>

2190
01:01:27.411 --> 01:01:29.450
<v Speaker 1>The last thing you want to give was a baby's milk.</v>

2191
01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh goodness.</v>

2192
01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just what everybody gives babies.</v>

2193
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>This is what gay guys love.</v>

2194
01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.133
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>

2195
01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.470
<v Speaker 1>That's not why they,</v>

2196
01:01:37.471 --> 01:01:39.440
<v Speaker 1>why they like him and maybe cause they think of a fucking,</v>

2197
01:01:39.441 --> 01:01:41.480
<v Speaker 1>these guys know that that's aggressive.</v>

2198
01:01:42.090 --> 01:01:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Super aggressive.</v>

2199
01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:43.910
<v Speaker 1>That's why gay guys like him.</v>

2200
01:01:43.911 --> 01:01:47.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know a gay man who is a comic who is very in love with a brand.</v>

2201
01:01:47.991 --> 01:01:50.990
<v Speaker 1>And why isn't there Gage Jujitsu?</v>

2202
01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:52.341
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2203
01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:54.290
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you would think like he's always like,</v>

2204
01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:55.533
<v Speaker 1>where's your dad too?</v>

2205
01:01:55.690 --> 01:01:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2206
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:58.070
<v Speaker 1>They probably not enough of them.</v>

2207
01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.113
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't there more?</v>

2208
01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't there a gay Jujitsu Academy?</v>

2209
01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>They're probably,</v>

2210
01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:03.140
<v Speaker 1>they would love it.</v>

2211
01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:04.490
<v Speaker 1>They would love it.</v>

2212
01:02:04.491 --> 01:02:05.360
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine?</v>

2213
01:02:05.361 --> 01:02:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Put out an advertisement,</v>

2214
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:12.010
<v Speaker 1>but even even in the class even engage you just so you don't think about the</v>

2215
01:02:12.621 --> 01:02:14.300
<v Speaker 1>sexual aspect of the positions.</v>

2216
01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Even engage,</v>

2217
01:02:15.450 --> 01:02:17.960
<v Speaker 1>know you don't want the guy to tap you out.</v>

2218
01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:20.370
<v Speaker 1>So even if you are attracted to the guy,</v>

2219
01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:22.440
<v Speaker 5>he was dudes beating you up.</v>

2220
01:02:23.350 --> 01:02:24.390
<v Speaker 5>I Francis Bacon,</v>

2221
01:02:24.391 --> 01:02:24.880
<v Speaker 5>the painter.</v>

2222
01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:28.590
<v Speaker 5>I think she gets too important not to get tapped out that no matter what</v>

2223
01:02:28.591 --> 01:02:29.460
<v Speaker 5>position you're in,</v>

2224
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.980
<v Speaker 5>you're not picking about sex ever.</v>

2225
01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:34.260
<v Speaker 5>You're thinking about not getting tapped out.</v>

2226
01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:35.280
<v Speaker 5>Even if you're gay,</v>

2227
01:02:35.281 --> 01:02:37.170
<v Speaker 5>you're not thinking about sex in Jujitsu.</v>

2228
01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.153
<v Speaker 5>That's what I believe</v>

2229
01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.840
<v Speaker 5>the move them to some of the [inaudible] podcast called.</v>

2230
01:02:42.841 --> 01:02:46.410
<v Speaker 5>That's what I believe we're thinking about fighting in the ring,</v>

2231
01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.710
<v Speaker 5>that they kept moving people to the center in the same position.</v>

2232
01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:52.530
<v Speaker 5>There should.</v>

2233
01:02:52.530 --> 01:02:56.760
<v Speaker 5>Good thing about the ring is that it plays less of a factor,</v>

2234
01:02:57.330 --> 01:02:58.650
<v Speaker 5>like as far as the environment.</v>

2235
01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.080
<v Speaker 5>Then the cage does cause the cage.</v>

2236
01:03:01.081 --> 01:03:02.680
<v Speaker 5>You didn't push a guy against it.</v>

2237
01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:06.930
<v Speaker 5>It's the whole sport cage wrestling that is so different than regular wrestling,</v>

2238
01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:11.580
<v Speaker 5>wrestling off the cage and all the possible positions against the cage.</v>

2239
01:03:11.581 --> 01:03:12.450
<v Speaker 5>When you're wrestling,</v>

2240
01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:17.520
<v Speaker 5>there's only so many positions against the cage and Kenny Johnson,</v>

2241
01:03:17.521 --> 01:03:20.760
<v Speaker 5>he's a wrestler who's science septic about it.</v>

2242
01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:24.090
<v Speaker 5>He trains Alan [inaudible] who's one of my guys and they're,</v>

2243
01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:25.613
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2244
01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:28.410
<v Speaker 5>here's a question I have.</v>

2245
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:32.730
<v Speaker 5>If they don't training and mostly Sam and training in Russia.</v>

2246
01:03:32.731 --> 01:03:35.040
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't have a lot of Jujitsu guys to train with probably.</v>

2247
01:03:35.041 --> 01:03:35.550
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2248
01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:40.020
<v Speaker 5>So how was he so good at defending against all these trauma has submissions but</v>

2249
01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:43.430
<v Speaker 5>it's not the most of the leg locks and well their bars.</v>

2250
01:03:43.431 --> 01:03:45.090
<v Speaker 5>Farmers especially Camorra's.</v>

2251
01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:45.983
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2252
01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:47.190
<v Speaker 5>which is what it was just going for.</v>

2253
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:51.210
<v Speaker 5>I mean Fado is one a lot of fight by straight arm bar and a lot of fights by our</v>

2254
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:52.380
<v Speaker 5>Kimora over doom.</v>

2255
01:03:52.381 --> 01:03:53.850
<v Speaker 5>Used to be a cro cups,</v>

2256
01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.650
<v Speaker 5>Jiu Jitsu instructor.</v>

2257
01:03:57.290 --> 01:03:58.230
<v Speaker 5>She what?</v>

2258
01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.320
<v Speaker 5>Croatia to help him with his defense.</v>

2259
01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:05.790
<v Speaker 5>Well even though sambos like a Mo,</v>

2260
01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:10.620
<v Speaker 5>it's mostly a leg lock system and catch wrestling as like this kind of system</v>

2261
01:04:10.621 --> 01:04:11.454
<v Speaker 5>without a guard.</v>

2262
01:04:12.450 --> 01:04:13.081
<v Speaker 5>Since hoists,</v>

2263
01:04:13.081 --> 01:04:13.914
<v Speaker 5>Gracie,</v>

2264
01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:19.730
<v Speaker 5>all grappling styles have adopted or filled the holes that were glaring since</v>

2265
01:04:20.761 --> 01:04:22.200
<v Speaker 5>UFC one like oh shit,</v>

2266
01:04:22.201 --> 01:04:26.190
<v Speaker 5>we actually do need a guard cause catch wrestling didn't have a guard.</v>

2267
01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:26.521
<v Speaker 5>Eddie,</v>

2268
01:04:26.521 --> 01:04:27.211
<v Speaker 5>when you see this,</v>

2269
01:04:27.211 --> 01:04:28.980
<v Speaker 5>what do you think here about his guard?</v>

2270
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.971
<v Speaker 5>I mean when you see this,</v>

2271
01:04:29.971 --> 01:04:33.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is obviously 2004 but when you know your guard and your style,</v>

2272
01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:37.380
<v Speaker 5>you mean he must be seeing so many goddamn openings in this.</v>

2273
01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:38.161
<v Speaker 5>It just didn't.</v>

2274
01:04:38.161 --> 01:04:41.820
<v Speaker 5>People weren't aware of back then as far as like when he can control his</v>

2275
01:04:41.821 --> 01:04:42.420
<v Speaker 5>posture.</v>

2276
01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:42.691
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2277
01:04:42.691 --> 01:04:47.691
<v Speaker 5>Nogueira was the first guy to come along since hoists Gracie to be known for his</v>

2278
01:04:47.971 --> 01:04:52.320
<v Speaker 5>guard there we went and hoists Gracie who tapped everyone out in the beginning</v>

2279
01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.560
<v Speaker 5>and then people got hip to Jujitsu.</v>

2280
01:04:54.570 --> 01:04:55.410
<v Speaker 5>Then they started training it.</v>

2281
01:04:55.411 --> 01:04:58.590
<v Speaker 5>They learn the defense and then we had a long period where like Mark Coleman</v>

2282
01:04:58.591 --> 01:05:02.940
<v Speaker 5>came in and the wrestler started dominating and we didn't have any Jujitsu guys</v>

2283
01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:07.890
<v Speaker 5>in there that knew how to submit people off their back when there was punches</v>

2284
01:05:07.891 --> 01:05:09.900
<v Speaker 5>and elbows and there's no key,</v>

2285
01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:10.943
<v Speaker 5>it was just,</v>

2286
01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.113
<v Speaker 5>it was too much.</v>

2287
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:15.900
<v Speaker 5>It was like a riddle that needed to be solved and then Nogueira comes along and</v>

2288
01:05:15.901 --> 01:05:16.231
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>

2289
01:05:16.231 --> 01:05:17.064
<v Speaker 5>just like that.</v>

2290
01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:19.150
<v Speaker 5>He was the only guy out there,</v>

2291
01:05:19.151 --> 01:05:22.930
<v Speaker 5>especially especially for a heavyweight to finish people off their back.</v>

2292
01:05:22.931 --> 01:05:24.790
<v Speaker 5>He was known for his guard.</v>

2293
01:05:24.791 --> 01:05:25.624
<v Speaker 5>When you talk,</v>

2294
01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:29.020
<v Speaker 5>when you're talking about a MMA guards back then,</v>

2295
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:34.120
<v Speaker 5>most of the time people said Nogueira had the best guard in MMA.</v>

2296
01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:38.710
<v Speaker 5>He was the only guy going after this and a man fitters getting out of a lot of</v>

2297
01:05:38.711 --> 01:05:39.010
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

2298
01:05:39.010 --> 01:05:40.870
<v Speaker 5>It's squishy and it's really,</v>

2299
01:05:40.871 --> 01:05:41.704
<v Speaker 5>really greasy.</v>

2300
01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:44.950
<v Speaker 5>It's greasy and he's strong and he's also by the way,</v>

2301
01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:46.480
<v Speaker 5>might've been oiled up.</v>

2302
01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:47.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2303
01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:48.310
<v Speaker 5>How about that?</v>

2304
01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:50.340
<v Speaker 5>Mark Coleman told me that he was backstage.</v>

2305
01:05:50.370 --> 01:05:52.040
<v Speaker 5>He saw Vandelay oiling up.</v>

2306
01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:53.790
<v Speaker 5>Vandalism,</v>

2307
01:05:53.790 --> 01:05:54.623
<v Speaker 5>a fight.</v>

2308
01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:56.043
<v Speaker 5>Fair.</v>

2309
01:05:56.350 --> 01:05:57.190
<v Speaker 5>Listen brother,</v>

2310
01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.530
<v Speaker 5>this is bad.</v>

2311
01:05:59.531 --> 01:06:00.364
<v Speaker 5>It's using.</v>

2312
01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:01.593
<v Speaker 5>He was Alex.</v>

2313
01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:03.101
<v Speaker 5>You can't do that.</v>

2314
01:06:03.101 --> 01:06:03.790
<v Speaker 5>I'd be shocked.</v>

2315
01:06:03.790 --> 01:06:04.450
<v Speaker 5>You'd be surprise.</v>

2316
01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:05.740
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2317
01:06:05.741 --> 01:06:07.750
<v Speaker 5>these fucking shots he hit no.</v>

2318
01:06:07.751 --> 01:06:09.070
<v Speaker 5>Carol with this was,</v>

2319
01:06:09.071 --> 01:06:12.490
<v Speaker 5>this is the roughest part of this fight and Nogueira was another guy who was</v>

2320
01:06:12.491 --> 01:06:14.440
<v Speaker 5>known for his chin based on these fights.</v>

2321
01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:17.630
<v Speaker 5>He had the strongest Chin in MMA.</v>

2322
01:06:17.631 --> 01:06:18.040
<v Speaker 5>If you,</v>

2323
01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.900
<v Speaker 5>if you talked about the best guards in MMA.</v>

2324
01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:20.111
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2325
01:06:20.111 --> 01:06:20.950
<v Speaker 5>Garrett is going to be up there.</v>

2326
01:06:20.951 --> 01:06:22.990
<v Speaker 5>Back then you'd be talking about the best chins and MMA.</v>

2327
01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:23.460
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2328
01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:24.640
<v Speaker 5>isn't going to be back there and I'm like,</v>

2329
01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:26.290
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about the best chins now.</v>

2330
01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:27.190
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2331
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:28.090
<v Speaker 5>Has been around,</v>

2332
01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:28.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2333
01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:33.520
<v Speaker 5>th the sports so long that his chin clearly isn't as strong as it was back then</v>

2334
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:34.743
<v Speaker 5>to a war.</v>

2335
01:06:34.810 --> 01:06:38.780
<v Speaker 5>I think he's going to do what he's doing to watch for next guru.</v>

2336
01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:44.080
<v Speaker 5>Next know who is going to make millions is the guru who could turn you from,</v>

2337
01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:44.500
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2338
01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:48.970
<v Speaker 5>turn your Chin around and strengthen your Chin and make yourself and turn you</v>

2339
01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:49.804
<v Speaker 5>into a guy.</v>

2340
01:06:50.530 --> 01:06:52.240
<v Speaker 5>There's gotta be some kind of technique,</v>

2341
01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:52.980
<v Speaker 5>not a group,</v>

2342
01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:53.261
<v Speaker 5>bro.</v>

2343
01:06:53.261 --> 01:06:54.490
<v Speaker 5>That's so fucking wizard.</v>

2344
01:06:56.530 --> 01:06:58.060
<v Speaker 5>He's going to come in on the Dragon.</v>

2345
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:59.380
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>

2346
01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:00.640
<v Speaker 5>What if that happens?</v>

2347
01:07:00.641 --> 01:07:01.990
<v Speaker 5>What if there's something that would have missed it?</v>

2348
01:07:01.991 --> 01:07:06.040
<v Speaker 5>I can make your Dick bigger and you give up on fighting because Dick is so big.</v>

2349
01:07:06.041 --> 01:07:07.590
<v Speaker 5>You just check it out,</v>

2350
01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:08.011
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2351
01:07:08.011 --> 01:07:10.740
<v Speaker 5>When your Chin by or breathe underwater underwater,</v>

2352
01:07:10.770 --> 01:07:12.310
<v Speaker 5>why would you fire taking these shots?</v>

2353
01:07:12.311 --> 01:07:14.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to bring your Chin back and I'm gonna make your Dick Three inches</v>

2354
01:07:14.981 --> 01:07:15.460
<v Speaker 5>bigger.</v>

2355
01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:16.293
<v Speaker 5>Trust me.</v>

2356
01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.193
<v Speaker 5>Trust.</v>

2357
01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:19.191
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2358
01:07:19.191 --> 01:07:21.830
<v Speaker 2>you know what's going to be really interesting when they do come up with</v>

2359
01:07:21.831 --> 01:07:25.880
<v Speaker 2>genetically engineered human beings where people have just unbelievably freakish</v>

2360
01:07:25.881 --> 01:07:26.780
<v Speaker 2>athletic ability.</v>

2361
01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:31.130
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to care as much about like athletics and won't mean as much.</v>

2362
01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:31.941
<v Speaker 2>Like right now,</v>

2363
01:07:31.941 --> 01:07:35.570
<v Speaker 2>what it means is a representative patient of your character,</v>

2364
01:07:35.810 --> 01:07:36.680
<v Speaker 2>of your will,</v>

2365
01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:39.010
<v Speaker 2>of your ability to do something that most people won't do.</v>

2366
01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:40.280
<v Speaker 2>When you see a guy who was built,</v>

2367
01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:41.540
<v Speaker 2>you think two things.</v>

2368
01:07:41.541 --> 01:07:43.490
<v Speaker 2>One is the old folk would steroids,</v>

2369
01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:45.050
<v Speaker 2>but the other thing you think is like,</v>

2370
01:07:45.051 --> 01:07:45.231
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2371
01:07:45.231 --> 01:07:47.010
<v Speaker 2>that guy has put in some fucking work like this.</v>

2372
01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:48.770
<v Speaker 2>Even when a guy is on steroids,</v>

2373
01:07:48.771 --> 01:07:49.604
<v Speaker 2>if a guy is big,</v>

2374
01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:53.660
<v Speaker 2>the only way you get big is by putting in the kind of work that most people are</v>

2375
01:07:53.661 --> 01:07:54.500
<v Speaker 2>not willing to do.</v>

2376
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:55.600
<v Speaker 2>So when you see somebody,</v>

2377
01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:56.443
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2378
01:07:56.850 --> 01:08:00.340
<v Speaker 5>look at this man that was at a Brazilian Electric Char.</v>

2379
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:00.761
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2380
01:08:00.761 --> 01:08:01.594
<v Speaker 5>it was beautiful.</v>

2381
01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:04.000
<v Speaker 5>So when you see someone that they look at this,</v>

2382
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:07.790
<v Speaker 5>he's trying to pass instantly trying to pass that era.</v>

2383
01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:12.150
<v Speaker 5>That was a beautiful thing about Nogueira his Jujitsu so smoothly that half a</v>

2384
01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.300
<v Speaker 5>side control immediately.</v>

2385
01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:14.880
<v Speaker 5>Look at this.</v>

2386
01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:15.231
<v Speaker 5>Look at this.</v>

2387
01:08:15.231 --> 01:08:17.380
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible]</v>

2388
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:18.680
<v Speaker 1>her man so strong,</v>

2389
01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>so strong.</v>

2390
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.040
<v Speaker 1>It's such a good grasp.</v>

2391
01:08:22.110 --> 01:08:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Pausing Brian Jenny,</v>

2392
01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:25.093
<v Speaker 1>first time.</v>

2393
01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:28.420
<v Speaker 1>He's never satisfied.</v>

2394
01:08:28.790 --> 01:08:29.623
<v Speaker 1>He's never seen it,</v>

2395
01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:36.230
<v Speaker 1>but just the way he's been reacting.</v>

2396
01:08:36.231 --> 01:08:37.250
<v Speaker 1>There's no way he's ever seen.</v>

2397
01:08:37.251 --> 01:08:38.510
<v Speaker 1>He said MMA fan the way.</v>

2398
01:08:38.511 --> 01:08:43.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a fan of politics and every now and then,</v>

2399
01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:45.260
<v Speaker 1>why'd you have to call me out?</v>

2405
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Mark Fitch used to fight in the UFC.</v>

2412
01:09:09.230 --> 01:09:10.063
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

2413
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:12.140

2414
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:13.850
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have a scratch on his face.</v>

2415
01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Even in between rounds.</v>

2416
01:09:15.291 --> 01:09:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Calm as a cucumber.</v>

2417
01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:18.230
<v Speaker 1>The thing about these fights,</v>

2430
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think as aggressive as he was in his ground,</v>

2431
01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:43.611
<v Speaker 1>a pounds.</v>

2432
01:09:43.611 --> 01:09:46.850
<v Speaker 1>The same reason down the road when he felt a guy like we're doomed.</v>

2433
01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:47.660
<v Speaker 1>Submitted.</v>

01:09:51.070 --> 01:09:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Agree.</v>

2437
01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Whom?</v>

2438
01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Condom Verdugo tricked him.</v>

2439
01:09:54.050 --> 01:09:56.030
<v Speaker 1>He made it seem like you went down and got hurt.</v>

2440
01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:58.250
<v Speaker 1>He pulled guard in a different kind of way.</v>

2441
01:09:58.370 --> 01:09:58.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2442
01:09:58.670 --> 01:09:59.370
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2443

01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:03.383
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

2447
01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I think he would have been knocked.</v>

2448
01:10:10.381 --> 01:10:11.214
<v Speaker 1>You're still hitting him.</v>

2449
01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:12.713
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>

2450

01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:00.693
<v Speaker 1>He deserves that.</v>

2489
01:11:00.710 --> 01:11:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

2490
01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:02.900
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who's a warrior deserves that.</v>

2491
01:11:02.901 --> 01:11:03.231
<v Speaker 1>Know us.</v>

2492
01:11:03.231 --> 01:11:03.621
<v Speaker 1>No other.</v>

2493
01:11:03.621 --> 01:11:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2494
01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.080
<v Speaker 1>I hear that Putin really likes</v>

2495
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:10.161
<v Speaker 1>watching this,</v>

2496
01:11:10.161 --> 01:11:13.560
<v Speaker 1>but so let's pay attention to fade wars physique because it will show some later</v>

2497
01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 1>fade or</v>

2498
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:14.580
<v Speaker 5>fights.</v>

2499
01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:15.660
<v Speaker 5>He's never been lean.</v>

2500
01:11:16.050 --> 01:11:16.501
<v Speaker 5>Well No,</v>

2501
01:11:16.501 --> 01:11:16.681
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2502
01:11:16.681 --> 01:11:16.831
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2503
01:11:16.831 --> 01:11:17.371
<v Speaker 5>never lean.</v>

2504
01:11:17.371 --> 01:11:19.560
<v Speaker 5>But his bulk dropped substantially.</v>

2505
01:11:19.561 --> 01:11:20.520
<v Speaker 5>His amount of mass,</v>

2506
01:11:20.521 --> 01:11:21.660
<v Speaker 5>like his muscle power,</v>

2507
01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:23.200
<v Speaker 5>it drops shredder.</v>

2508
01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:24.630
<v Speaker 5>That would have been,</v>

2509
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:27.480
<v Speaker 5>we should have been to a five to a five the whole time.</v>

2510
01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:27.871
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2511
01:11:27.871 --> 01:11:30.120
<v Speaker 5>He was two 30 and at least 20 pounds overweight,</v>

2512
01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:31.710
<v Speaker 5>like easily.</v>

2513
01:11:31.711 --> 01:11:33.380
<v Speaker 5>Could have been to 10 lean,</v>

2514
01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:33.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2515
01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:34.141
<v Speaker 5>if like,</v>

2516
01:11:34.141 --> 01:11:35.520
<v Speaker 5>if Fado was like,</v>

2517
01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:36.541
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2518
01:11:36.541 --> 01:11:37.440
<v Speaker 5>find a fighter,</v>

2519
01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:38.730
<v Speaker 5>a Russian guy,</v>

2520
01:11:38.731 --> 01:11:41.460
<v Speaker 5>like a poly bag routine off was shredded.</v>

2521
01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:45.060
<v Speaker 5>It fade or like got down to that lean body mass.</v>

2522
01:11:45.061 --> 01:11:45.930
<v Speaker 5>He'd be two or three,</v>

2523
01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.340
<v Speaker 5>like without even cutting weight.</v>

2524
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:48.210
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy,</v>

2525
01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:50.910
<v Speaker 5>but it's gut guys got a little bit of a bad ass.</v>

2526
01:11:50.911 --> 01:11:53.400
<v Speaker 5>Was Carlson fucking Gracie man.</v>

2527
01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:54.313
<v Speaker 5>Who's your grandma's grandma?</v>

2528
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:58.830
<v Speaker 5>When you look into the history of what happened in Brazil,</v>

2529
01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:01.860
<v Speaker 5>Carlson Gracie was the man,</v>

2530
01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:02.280
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

2531
01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.120
<v Speaker 5>that was the round.</v>

2532
01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:04.200
<v Speaker 5>His whole pain.</v>

2533
01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:05.640
<v Speaker 5>They wouldn't know [inaudible].</v>

2534
01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.230
<v Speaker 5>They weren't on their boxing.</v>

2535
01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:09.840
<v Speaker 5>Look at all their guys and their boxing Merola booster month.</v>

2536
01:12:09.841 --> 01:12:11.490
<v Speaker 5>They had some serious boxing,</v>

2537
01:12:11.610 --> 01:12:12.770
<v Speaker 5>so did the Noguera's.</v>

2538
01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:15.630
<v Speaker 5>I was like a throw down with their feet and that was all Carlson Gracie.</v>

2539
01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:16.810
<v Speaker 5>How about fucking veto bro?</v>

2540
01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:22.160
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] was the first guy to come along see 12 the only Gracie's that had</v>

2541
01:12:22.711 --> 01:12:26.970
<v Speaker 5>really real hands or Carlson Gracie's got that clan,</v>

2542
01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:30.390
<v Speaker 5>that Brazilian top team clan that Carlson Gracie brought up.</v>

2543
01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:31.530
<v Speaker 5>That guy was the man.</v>

2544
01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:34.350
<v Speaker 5>That guy was the unsung hero of the Gracies.</v>

2545
01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:39.380
<v Speaker 5>I'm shocked at how much bigger fade or is physically like his muscles and his</v>

2546
01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.020
<v Speaker 5>old fights in awhile.</v>

2547
01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:41.850
<v Speaker 5>Much bigger.</v>

2548
01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:44.430
<v Speaker 5>Swole like 20 plus pounds of muscle.</v>

2549
01:12:44.431 --> 01:12:45.000
<v Speaker 5>Bigger.</v>

2550
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.440
<v Speaker 5>Like if you look at him towards the end,</v>

2551
01:12:46.441 --> 01:12:47.970
<v Speaker 5>like when he fought Dan Henderson,</v>

2552
01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.130
<v Speaker 5>he's a shell of himself.</v>

2553
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:53.130
<v Speaker 5>It makes me wonder like how the states,</v>

2554
01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:54.510
<v Speaker 5>that's true.</v>

2555
01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:59.010
<v Speaker 5>When you're hoists Gracie saying stuff like you don't need to a trained boxing</v>

2556
01:12:59.011 --> 01:12:59.491
<v Speaker 5>or wrestling,</v>

2557
01:12:59.491 --> 01:13:01.590
<v Speaker 5>you just need you Jitsu like all your needs is Jujitsu.</v>

2558
01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:03.600
<v Speaker 5>When you hear who I say stuff like that,</v>

2559
01:13:03.601 --> 01:13:04.320
<v Speaker 5>what do you think?</v>

2560
01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.900
<v Speaker 5>I think it's crazy you're saying that to the other Gracie's though,</v>

2561
01:13:06.901 --> 01:13:07.141
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2562
01:13:07.141 --> 01:13:10.420
<v Speaker 5>He's not saying that for everything I can on Roger Gracie for working on is</v>

2563
01:13:10.421 --> 01:13:11.550
<v Speaker 5>restructuring box.</v>

2564
01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:16.560
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile Roger Crazy saying that now as he's saying that slowly he's turning</v>

2565
01:13:16.561 --> 01:13:18.510
<v Speaker 5>into a decent strikers fucked up,</v>

2566
01:13:18.511 --> 01:13:20.700
<v Speaker 5>changed six screening dude,</v>

2567
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.000
<v Speaker 5>how'd you Gracie is is turning into [inaudible] if he just fucking turns that</v>

2568
01:13:26.881 --> 01:13:29.670
<v Speaker 5>striking training up the coaches and he's got,</v>

2569
01:13:29.671 --> 01:13:31.110
<v Speaker 5>he's got the jazz athletic.</v>

2570
01:13:31.111 --> 01:13:34.790
<v Speaker 5>Is he saying he's saying that now he's saying that today.</v>

2571
01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:38.790
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to listen to hoist today because it makes me sad because I think you</v>

2572
01:13:38.791 --> 01:13:39.840
<v Speaker 5>know is just,</v>

2573
01:13:39.930 --> 01:13:41.520
<v Speaker 5>I dunno what's going on with him,</v>

2574
01:13:41.521 --> 01:13:43.170
<v Speaker 5>but all the shit that he said about you,</v>

2575
01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.820
<v Speaker 5>I put hoists in a new category.</v>

2576
01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:45.241
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm like,</v>

2577
01:13:45.241 --> 01:13:45.781
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2578
01:13:45.781 --> 01:13:46.614
<v Speaker 5>he's that guy.</v>

2579
01:13:46.710 --> 01:13:47.041
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2580
01:13:47.041 --> 01:13:48.090
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what's going on.</v>

2581
01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:50.850
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's emotions or if it's anger,</v>

2582
01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:54.150
<v Speaker 5>but all the shit that he said about you after you beat Heuler the second time.</v>

2583
01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.730
<v Speaker 5>I know you didn't win a decision cause it was a draw.</v>

2584
01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:57.930
<v Speaker 5>You dominated him in that fight.</v>

2585
01:13:57.931 --> 01:14:00.870
<v Speaker 5>Let's just say that you dominated him in that match a hundred percent everybody</v>

2586
01:14:00.871 --> 01:14:03.750
<v Speaker 5>knows it and you never said a bad thing about the Gracies leading up to it.</v>

2587
01:14:03.751 --> 01:14:05.310
<v Speaker 5>You guys were very respectful to each other,</v>

2588
01:14:05.490 --> 01:14:07.110
<v Speaker 5>you and heuler where before the match,</v>

2589
01:14:07.111 --> 01:14:07.921
<v Speaker 5>even after the match,</v>

2590
01:14:07.921 --> 01:14:09.390
<v Speaker 5>you gave it up to a boiler in the Gracies.</v>

2591
01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:10.201
<v Speaker 5>You always did.</v>

2592
01:14:10.201 --> 01:14:10.711
<v Speaker 5>You always have.</v>

2593
01:14:10.711 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 5>You always really cognizant about</v>

2594
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:12.101
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2595
01:14:12.101 --> 01:14:14.080
<v Speaker 2>So when he got super upset about that,</v>

2596
01:14:14.081 --> 01:14:14.320
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

2597
01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:14.950
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2598
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:16.570
<v Speaker 2>this is like a non rational person.</v>

2599
01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.130
<v Speaker 2>There's a person who's not thinking straight.</v>

2600
01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:22.090
<v Speaker 2>So when he starts talking about like all you need is Jujitsu Mike.</v>

2601
01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2602
01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:23.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2603
01:14:23.530 --> 01:14:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Until you fight someone like Anthony Rumble,</v>

2604
01:14:26.561 --> 01:14:27.520
<v Speaker 2>fucking Johnson.</v>

2605
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Good luck with all that.</v>

2606
01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:30.520
<v Speaker 2>Good luck when you Jujitsu,</v>

2607
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:35.140
<v Speaker 2>when you get knocked into the fucking next dimension with every Jabie throws.</v>

2608
01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2609
01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:36.011
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

2610
01:14:36.011 --> 01:14:37.090
<v Speaker 2>Try that out.</v>

2611
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:38.110
<v Speaker 2>The reality,</v>

2612
01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:43.140
<v Speaker 2>the reality cold hard reality is hoists Gracie in his prime UFC one.</v>

2613
01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:44.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2614
01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:45.880
<v Speaker 2>fights Anthony Rumble Johnson,</v>

2615
01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:48.400
<v Speaker 2>he gets put to sleep in 20 seconds.</v>

2616
01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:52.060
<v Speaker 2>That's a reality because the game has changed.</v>

2617
01:14:52.061 --> 01:14:56.380
<v Speaker 2>It is a fucking whole new world and when you deal with a guy like rumble</v>

2618
01:14:56.381 --> 01:14:56.801
<v Speaker 2>Johnson,</v>

2619
01:14:56.801 --> 01:14:57.700
<v Speaker 2>hate to keep bringing him up,</v>

2620
01:14:57.701 --> 01:15:01.690
<v Speaker 2>but he's a perfect example of a wrestler who's a strong wrestler,</v>

2621
01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.460
<v Speaker 2>wicked takedown defense,</v>

<v Speaker 2>strong as shit and has that God given power.</v>

2623
01:15:09.190 --> 01:15:11.410
<v Speaker 2>God Given Power with good coaching.</v>

2624
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:12.670
<v Speaker 2>He's got Henri Hooft,</v>

2625
01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:16.060
<v Speaker 2>one of the best fucking striking coaches in MMA period,</v>

2626
01:15:16.061 --> 01:15:20.610
<v Speaker 2>a real Dutch kickboxing striking coach and he's teaching those fucking guys had</v>

2627
01:15:20.611 --> 01:15:23.140
<v Speaker 2>a throw combinations that are technical,</v>

2628
01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:24.460
<v Speaker 2>put strikes together,</v>

2629
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:28.540
<v Speaker 2>be in the right position to land bombs and he's dealing with this like super</v>

2630
01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:29.890
<v Speaker 2>athlete and Rumble Johnson.</v>

2631
01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:30.940
<v Speaker 2>If voice had a fight,</v>

2632
01:15:30.941 --> 01:15:31.600
<v Speaker 2>that guy,</v>

2633
01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:32.500
<v Speaker 2>he would have a different,</v>

2634
01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:33.610
<v Speaker 2>a difference of opinion.</v>

2635
01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:34.473
<v Speaker 2>He would realize like,</v>

2636
01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:34.691
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2637
01:15:34.691 --> 01:15:37.840
<v Speaker 2>you're different when you're dealing with a completely different species of</v>

2638
01:15:37.841 --> 01:15:38.321
<v Speaker 2>human.</v>

2639
01:15:38.321 --> 01:15:40.420
<v Speaker 2>These are these super athletes of today.</v>

2640
01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:41.350
<v Speaker 2>They're just on a,</v>

2641
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:42.520
<v Speaker 2>what would he do against Jon Jones?</v>

2642
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:43.750
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu's all your nude.</v>

2643
01:15:43.810 --> 01:15:44.141

01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Good luck using your Jujitsu on John Jones.</v>

2646
01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.140
<v Speaker 2>How do you explain that?</v>

2647
01:15:50.141 --> 01:15:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't,</v>

2648
01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.010
<v Speaker 2>you don't bother with someone says the earth is 10,000 years old.</v>

2649
01:15:54.170 --> 01:15:54.580
<v Speaker 2>You get it.</v>

2650
01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:55.120
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2651
01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:55.690
<v Speaker 2>I got to go.</v>

2652
01:15:55.690 --> 01:15:59.140

2653
01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:00.050
<v Speaker 2>Agrees with them.</v>

2654
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:01.620
<v Speaker 2>Nobody agrees with them.</v>

2655
01:16:01.621 --> 01:16:02.454
<v Speaker 2>That one.</v>

2656
01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:06.790
<v Speaker 2>And he's the biggest UFC legend of all time.</v>

2657
01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:09.120
<v Speaker 2>What was his Jujitsu?</v>

2658
01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:10.680
<v Speaker 2>What was the context of what I'm saying?</v>

2659
01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:16.390
<v Speaker 2>He says that he saying that Roger Gracie was spending too much time working on</v>

2660
01:16:16.391 --> 01:16:16.960
<v Speaker 2>his striking.</v>

2661
01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.430
<v Speaker 2>That's why he's not successful.</v>

2662
01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:19.481
<v Speaker 2>He met him.</v>

2663
01:16:19.481 --> 01:16:21.280
<v Speaker 2>King Mo is a perfect example.</v>

2664
01:16:21.281 --> 01:16:23.200
<v Speaker 2>Why had to work on other shit?</v>

2665
01:16:23.410 --> 01:16:24.820
<v Speaker 2>King Mo put him to sleep.</v>

2666
01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:28.570
<v Speaker 2>You know why could really be King Mo is a fucking elite wrestler.</v>

2667
01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Good luck trying to take king mowed down Gould that he's ever been taken down if</v>

2668
01:16:33.690 --> 01:16:35.680
<v Speaker 2>he's cause he's Slippy.</v>

2669
01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:36.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2670
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:37.570
<v Speaker 2>King Moses</v>

2671
01:16:39.550 --> 01:16:41.350
<v Speaker 2>and one of the best coaches I've ever seen.</v>

2672
01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:41.830
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

2673
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:43.150
<v Speaker 2>you can coat some wrestling,</v>

2674
01:16:43.151 --> 01:16:44.140
<v Speaker 2>very technical,</v>

2675
01:16:44.141 --> 01:16:44.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2676
01:16:44.411 --> 01:16:45.490
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of how he guy.</v>

2677
01:16:46.090 --> 01:16:47.590
<v Speaker 2>He's had a rough career man.</v>

2678
01:16:47.591 --> 01:16:51.700
<v Speaker 2>You know he's had some real ups and real downs but I always like King Mo and I</v>

2679
01:16:51.701 --> 01:16:52.390
<v Speaker 2>always thought he's like,</v>

2680
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:53.380
<v Speaker 2>he's gotten massive,</v>

2681
01:16:53.381 --> 01:16:54.670
<v Speaker 2>massive fucking potential.</v>

2682
01:16:54.671 --> 01:16:55.810
<v Speaker 2>He hit that electric chair again.</v>

2683
01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:57.850
<v Speaker 2>Eddie hit that electric chair again,</v>

2684
01:16:57.970 --> 01:17:00.070
<v Speaker 2>but king mo also has,</v>

2685
01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:03.510
<v Speaker 2>he has some serious knockout power man and he knocked Haji route with him.</v>

2686
01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Bomb of a right hand cause the common quietly looking around see the problem</v>

2687
01:17:08.231 --> 01:17:09.830
<v Speaker 2>with saying you only you Jitsu.</v>

2688
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

2689
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.150
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do with King Mo?</v>

2690
01:17:11.151 --> 01:17:13.310
<v Speaker 3>You gotta Take Tango Down Wet slippery body.</v>

2691
01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:18.340
<v Speaker 3>Well it boys had this curriculum in this system mastered of pulling guard and</v>

2692
01:17:20.241 --> 01:17:25.241
<v Speaker 3>then another system master to finishing people off his back in this MMA way.</v>

2693
01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:29.510
<v Speaker 3>If he had those two systems then I would say,</v>

2694
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:30.561
<v Speaker 3>I see what it Sam,</v>

2695
01:17:30.561 --> 01:17:32.060
<v Speaker 3>because a guy like Paul Sas,</v>

2696
01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:36.140
<v Speaker 3>only guy in UFC history who had the strategy,</v>

2697
01:17:36.141 --> 01:17:38.570
<v Speaker 3>every fight was the shoot,</v>

2698
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:41.810
<v Speaker 3>make you sprawl and then pull guard and finish you off his back.</v>

2699
01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:44.900
<v Speaker 3>He's the only fighter I think and UFC history.</v>

2700
01:17:44.901 --> 01:17:45.710
<v Speaker 3>I could be wrong.</v>

2701
01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:47.420
<v Speaker 3>Dean Thomas was another guy like that.</v>

2702
01:17:47.421 --> 01:17:47.531
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

2703
01:17:47.531 --> 01:17:50.090
<v Speaker 3>he strategically went out to throw some,</v>

2704
01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:51.530
<v Speaker 3>throw some strikes,</v>

2705
01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:52.131
<v Speaker 3>shoot,</v>

2706
01:17:52.131 --> 01:17:52.821
<v Speaker 3>make you sprawl,</v>

2707
01:17:52.821 --> 01:17:53.840
<v Speaker 3>pull guard and then fuck,</v>

2708
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:54.890
<v Speaker 3>fuck you up off the back.</v>

2709
01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:56.120
<v Speaker 3>In that case,</v>

2710
01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:57.890
<v Speaker 3>if that's what voice is doing,</v>

2711
01:17:58.010 --> 01:18:00.230
<v Speaker 3>then I understand where he's coming from,</v>

2712
01:18:00.231 --> 01:18:02.180
<v Speaker 3>but I don't hear any of that from him.</v>

2713
01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:05.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't ever hear them talking about different strategies to pull guard and the</v>

2714
01:18:05.841 --> 01:18:07.190
<v Speaker 3>best ways there should be.</v>

2715
01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:08.270
<v Speaker 3>There's at least five,</v>

2716
01:18:08.271 --> 01:18:08.571
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

2717
01:18:08.571 --> 01:18:11.960
<v Speaker 3>seven different ways to strategically pull guard and I'm not hearing Hawaii.</v>

2718
01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:13.390
<v Speaker 3>Think when it comes to hodge,</v>

2719
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:16.880
<v Speaker 3>he's saying Hodges never going to fight for a belt or whatever.</v>

2720
01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:19.910
<v Speaker 3>He has these crazy skills in Jujitsu.</v>

2721
01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:23.000
<v Speaker 3>Quit wasting time on working on your striking wrestling.</v>

2722
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:24.440
<v Speaker 3>Just win by Jitsu.</v>

2723
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:25.303
<v Speaker 3>That's retarded.</v>

2724
01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:27.210
<v Speaker 3>You got to get your striking together.</v>

2725
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:28.850
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to be an MMA fighter,</v>

2726
01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:29.991
<v Speaker 3>regardless,</v>

2727
01:18:29.991 --> 01:18:31.400
<v Speaker 3>I think he's saying focus on,</v>

2728
01:18:31.401 --> 01:18:32.234
<v Speaker 3>do you know well,</v>

2729
01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:36.230
<v Speaker 3>well Haji Gracie has one of the best motherfuckers ever,</v>

2730
01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:36.580
<v Speaker 3>ever,</v>

2731
01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:36.960
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

2732
01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:37.460
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

2733
01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:39.370
<v Speaker 3>so when Omar would tell you what I,</v>

2734
01:18:39.371 --> 01:18:40.820
<v Speaker 3>what I would tell Joe Hodrick Gracie,</v>

2735
01:18:40.821 --> 01:18:44.210
<v Speaker 3>based on my experience and watching fighters coming in the UFC and kind of,</v>

2736
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:45.223
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

2737
01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:46.880
<v Speaker 3>don't get frustrated.</v>

2738
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.460
<v Speaker 3>The strikings going to take about five or six years.</v>

2739
01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:50.960
<v Speaker 3>Don't get frustrated.</v>

2740
01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:54.770
<v Speaker 3>You got to get your fuck and striking to get there.</v>

2741
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:57.020
<v Speaker 3>You got to keep pushing.</v>

2742
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:59.660
<v Speaker 3>You can't give up no matter how many losses.</v>

2743
01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:03.260
<v Speaker 3>There's no way you're going to get to the top with suspect striking and you're</v>

2744
01:19:03.261 --> 01:19:04.490
<v Speaker 3>on your feet and you're scared.</v>

2745
01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:07.400
<v Speaker 3>There's no way you keep working on your striking.</v>

2746
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:09.110
<v Speaker 3>You strive to be Jon Jones.</v>

2747
01:19:09.111 --> 01:19:10.640
<v Speaker 3>You strive to be Anderson Silva,</v>

2748
01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:11.990
<v Speaker 3>whether you reach them or not,</v>

2749
01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:12.501
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2750
01:19:12.501 --> 01:19:13.340
<v Speaker 3>At least you're trying.</v>

2751
01:19:13.341 --> 01:19:17.950
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to close the Tko James McSweeney that he's turning into property.</v>

2752
01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:18.670
<v Speaker 3>Superdome.</v>

2753
01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:19.730
<v Speaker 3>Haji Gracie.</v>

2754
01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:21.710
<v Speaker 3>I would say keep working that striking.</v>

2755
01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:23.870
<v Speaker 3>Even if he loses his next two fights,</v>

2756
01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:24.560
<v Speaker 3>striking,</v>

2757
01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:25.040
<v Speaker 3>give them the right.</v>

2758
01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.180
<v Speaker 3>What's the chief's going?</v>

2759
01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.800
<v Speaker 3>Who Cares about your record?</v>

2760
01:19:27.801 --> 01:19:31.520
<v Speaker 3>No one knows anybody's record and it's not like box room boxing.</v>

2761
01:19:31.521 --> 01:19:32.420
<v Speaker 3>It's all about the record.</v>

2762
01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:33.413
<v Speaker 3>MMA,</v>

2763
01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm a huge MMA fan.</v>

2764
01:19:34.581 --> 01:19:35.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anybody's record.</v>

2765
01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:36.681
<v Speaker 3>Emma is like,</v>

2766
01:19:36.681 --> 01:19:39.890
<v Speaker 3>how did you do your last couple of fights and there's so much to learn.</v>

2767
01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:42.160
<v Speaker 3>You got to understand that people are co,</v>

2768
01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:46.370
<v Speaker 3>the fighters are constantly in stages of development.</v>

2769
01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:49.910
<v Speaker 3>You're not done it when you think you're done in development,</v>

2770
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:52.100
<v Speaker 3>you are done in your career.</v>

2771
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:53.780
<v Speaker 3>You've got to remain a student.</v>

2772
01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:55.070
<v Speaker 3>There's too much to learn.</v>

2773
01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.290
<v Speaker 3>You can't think even even John Jones,</v>

2774
01:19:57.291 --> 01:19:58.370
<v Speaker 3>the baddest motherfucker out there,</v>

2775
01:19:58.490 --> 01:19:59.780
<v Speaker 3>he's still got,</v>

2776
01:19:59.781 --> 01:20:01.280
<v Speaker 3>there's still a lot did you get to to learn.</v>

2777
01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:02.440
<v Speaker 3>There's still what?</v>

2778
01:20:02.441 --> 01:20:03.950
<v Speaker 3>He's not Olympic caliber wrestling,</v>

2779
01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:04.850
<v Speaker 3>so you strive,</v>

2780
01:20:04.851 --> 01:20:07.470
<v Speaker 3>you keep learning new take downs off cage,</v>

2781
01:20:07.471 --> 01:20:08.304
<v Speaker 3>new takedowns,</v>

2782
01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:12.240
<v Speaker 5>different little takedowns off the cage and and different setups off strikes.</v>

2783
01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:13.680
<v Speaker 5>It's endless.</v>

2784
01:20:13.710 --> 01:20:14.790
<v Speaker 5>You never stopped.</v>

2785
01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:15.653
<v Speaker 5>I was impressive.</v>

2786
01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:19.160
<v Speaker 5>Junior dos Santos is a clinch work and he was much better than Steve Bay.</v>

2787
01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:20.690
<v Speaker 5>The zoot cheese in your mouth while you're talking.</v>

2788
01:20:20.710 --> 01:20:21.543
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2789
01:20:21.690 --> 01:20:22.523
<v Speaker 5>it's a cracker.</v>

2790
01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.590
<v Speaker 5>It was more dramatic.</v>

2791
01:20:25.610 --> 01:20:25.731
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2792
01:20:25.731 --> 01:20:27.790
<v Speaker 5>her brother's a junior Terramark mark.</v>

2793
01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:29.273
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>

2794
01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:30.300
<v Speaker 5>did you hear about it?</v>

2795
01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:34.100
<v Speaker 5>How about Nate Diaz versus a on Joe Sanchez?</v>

2796
01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:35.760
<v Speaker 5>Dos Anjos.</v>

2797
01:20:35.761 --> 01:20:36.720
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

2798
01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:41.790
<v Speaker 5>I think we not talked about dose Angeles and not so much amazing button.</v>

2799
01:20:41.890 --> 01:20:43.920
<v Speaker 5>Then the other problem with that,</v>

2800
01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:44.150
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2801
01:20:44.150 --> 01:20:45.960
<v Speaker 5>that he puts a lot of weight on that front leg.</v>

2802
01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:48.870
<v Speaker 5>He comes in strong with that jab cause he's got good reach,</v>

2803
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:50.580
<v Speaker 5>but every time I've seen him I was like,</v>

2804
01:20:50.581 --> 01:20:51.001
<v Speaker 5>my God,</v>

2805
01:20:51.001 --> 01:20:52.450
<v Speaker 5>why isn't someone leg kicking the shit out?</v>

2806
01:20:52.451 --> 01:20:54.990
<v Speaker 5>They're just not adapting to the evolution of the game.</v>

2807
01:20:54.991 --> 01:20:55.171
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2808
01:20:55.171 --> 01:20:55.620
<v Speaker 5>They're really not.</v>

2809
01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:56.870
<v Speaker 5>We're kind of kicks wrestling.</v>

2810
01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:57.320
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2811
01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.480
<v Speaker 5>Bostik's almost disdainfully like he's joking around with you.</v>

2812
01:21:00.630 --> 01:21:01.820
<v Speaker 5>Like he throws these like,</v>

2813
01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:02.940
<v Speaker 5>like his brother does.</v>

2814
01:21:03.090 --> 01:21:04.290
<v Speaker 5>They both do the same thing.</v>

2815
01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:07.410
<v Speaker 5>They'll throw at kicks when you're nowhere near him because I like,</v>

2816
01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:11.130
<v Speaker 5>he'll like when you find across and Nick Diaz kind kinda.</v>

2817
01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:13.590
<v Speaker 5>He just threw like the sloppy round house.</v>

2818
01:21:13.890 --> 01:21:14.211
<v Speaker 5>I tell you,</v>

2819
01:21:14.211 --> 01:21:14.431
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>

2820
01:21:14.431 --> 01:21:14.671
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>

2821
01:21:14.671 --> 01:21:14.791
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2822
01:21:14.791 --> 01:21:15.750
<v Speaker 5>we're throwing spent shit.</v>

2823
01:21:15.751 --> 01:21:18.540
<v Speaker 5>Now I tell all my fighters coming through my gym.</v>

2824
01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:20.460
<v Speaker 5>I tell him all whether they want to hear it or not.</v>

2825
01:21:20.730 --> 01:21:22.500
<v Speaker 5>I pull out my disclaimer.</v>

2826
01:21:22.530 --> 01:21:23.910
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a strike route or no shit.</v>

2827
01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:24.990
<v Speaker 5>This is just my opinion.</v>

2828
01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:30.030
<v Speaker 5>But if you're not striving to be a striker like Conor McGregor or like John</v>

2829
01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:30.270
<v Speaker 5>Jones,</v>

2830
01:21:30.270 --> 01:21:30.850
<v Speaker 5>damn,</v>

2831
01:21:30.850 --> 01:21:31.683
<v Speaker 5>you're old school.</v>

2832
01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:34.290
<v Speaker 5>You've got to strike everything that they're throwing.</v>

2833
01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:35.431
<v Speaker 5>Break it down.</v>

2834
01:21:35.431 --> 01:21:36.210
<v Speaker 5>Technically.</v>

2835
01:21:36.210 --> 01:21:37.080
<v Speaker 5>What is John Johnson?</v>

2836
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:38.610
<v Speaker 5>He's still spinning elbows.</v>

2837
01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:39.840
<v Speaker 5>He's throwing sidekicks.</v>

2838
01:21:40.410 --> 01:21:44.100
<v Speaker 5>Spinning kicks the leg telling me we'll kicks.</v>

2839
01:21:44.101 --> 01:21:44.431
<v Speaker 5>Don't work.</v>

2840
01:21:44.431 --> 01:21:45.810
<v Speaker 5>And you're watching Edson Barboza.</v>

2841
01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:49.830
<v Speaker 5>You're watching Vito Belfort who never throw kicks before you saw him in his</v>

2842
01:21:49.831 --> 01:21:50.370
<v Speaker 5>career.</v>

2843
01:21:50.370 --> 01:21:52.860
<v Speaker 5>Add a dangerous weapon like a spinning heel.</v>

2844
01:21:52.861 --> 01:21:53.370
<v Speaker 5>Crazy.</v>

2845
01:21:53.370 --> 01:21:54.203
<v Speaker 5>Everybody.</v>

2846
01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:55.680
<v Speaker 5>Alan Jobe on one of my fighters,</v>

2847
01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:56.910
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't throw a spinning heel,</v>

2848
01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:57.840
<v Speaker 5>heel kicks.</v>

2849
01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:58.550
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't do,</v>

2850
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:59.383
<v Speaker 5>we'll kicks.</v>

2851
01:21:59.430 --> 01:22:00.510
<v Speaker 5>I constantly tell him,</v>

2852
01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:01.200
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

2853
01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:02.280
<v Speaker 5>add that shit.</v>

2854
01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:03.600
<v Speaker 5>You could do it.</v>

2855
01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:04.650
<v Speaker 5>You're very athletic.</v>

2856
01:22:04.770 --> 01:22:05.910
<v Speaker 5>It's going to take a little while,</v>

2857
01:22:05.911 --> 01:22:06.661
<v Speaker 5>maybe six months,</v>

2858
01:22:06.661 --> 01:22:07.470
<v Speaker 5>a year and a half,</v>

2859
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.951
<v Speaker 5>two years.</v>

2860
01:22:07.951 --> 01:22:08.641
<v Speaker 5>Time flies.</v>

2861
01:22:08.641 --> 01:22:09.540
<v Speaker 5>We all know time flies.</v>

2862
01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:10.171
<v Speaker 5>But man,</v>

2863
01:22:10.171 --> 01:22:11.004
<v Speaker 5>before you know it,</v>

2864
01:22:11.190 --> 01:22:12.930
<v Speaker 5>you got to fucking wheel kicked it.</v>

2865
01:22:13.050 --> 01:22:16.800
<v Speaker 5>Your opponent has to train for and prepare for and it throws them off balance.</v>

2866
01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:18.060
<v Speaker 5>You got to turn in psychic.</v>

2867
01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:18.811
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>

2868
01:22:18.811 --> 01:22:22.410
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm Dee Diego Brandao.</v>

2869
01:22:22.411 --> 01:22:23.160
<v Speaker 5>What's his name?</v>

2870
01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:23.520
<v Speaker 5>And he said,</v>

2871
01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:23.801
<v Speaker 5>Brenda,</v>

2872
01:22:23.801 --> 01:22:25.320
<v Speaker 5>I was gather fought Conor McGregor.</v>

2873
01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:25.591
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2874
01:22:25.591 --> 01:22:26.820
<v Speaker 5>those guys to steal everything.</v>

2875
01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:27.331
<v Speaker 5>You never know.</v>

2876
01:22:27.331 --> 01:22:28.200
<v Speaker 5>They're just like right here.</v>

2877
01:22:28.270 --> 01:22:29.840
<v Speaker 5>You don't know what the fuck they're going to throw.</v>

2878
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:31.170
<v Speaker 5>Spinning back fist.</v>

2879
01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:35.010
<v Speaker 5>We'll kick sidekick Conor McGregor thrown couple of lyric kicks.</v>

2880
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:36.450
<v Speaker 5>In my opinion,</v>

2881
01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:38.000
<v Speaker 5>that's the future right there.</v>

2882
01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:39.750
<v Speaker 5>A guy that can throw any kick,</v>

2883
01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:40.890
<v Speaker 5>any punch,</v>

2884
01:22:41.010 --> 01:22:42.960
<v Speaker 5>any spinning elbow,</v>

2885
01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:43.980
<v Speaker 5>all that shit.</v>

2886
01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:45.270
<v Speaker 5>You've got to strive.</v>

2887
01:22:45.271 --> 01:22:49.710
<v Speaker 5>Anybody listening out to strive for that don't be one of those guys who just</v>

2888
01:22:49.711 --> 01:22:50.730
<v Speaker 5>sticks with boxing.</v>

2889
01:22:51.090 --> 01:22:55.200
<v Speaker 5>That's the other problem is guys get into MMA and they get into MMA after a</v>

2890
01:22:55.201 --> 01:22:57.180
<v Speaker 5>lifetime of one style.</v>

2891
01:22:57.390 --> 01:22:57.721
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2892
01:22:57.721 --> 01:23:01.560
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes it's very difficult for them to incorporate other techniques.</v>

2893
01:23:01.561 --> 01:23:04.830
<v Speaker 5>Like say if you spend a lifetime of just wrestling,</v>

2894
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.500
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2895
01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.240
<v Speaker 5>and you've never thrown a kick in your life.</v>

2896
01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:08.350
<v Speaker 5>And then someone was saying,</v>

2897
01:23:08.351 --> 01:23:08.531
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2898
01:23:08.531 --> 01:23:09.490
<v Speaker 5>you should throw head kicks.</v>

2899
01:23:09.491 --> 01:23:11.980
<v Speaker 5>Like why the fuck I could barely touch my toes as long time.</v>

2900
01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:13.150
<v Speaker 5>That's a lot of these guys.</v>

2901
01:23:13.450 --> 01:23:17.080
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're dealing with an elite athlete in one area.</v>

2902
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:19.750
<v Speaker 5>But when it comes to like the ability to learn how to kick,</v>

2903
01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:20.681
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2904
01:23:20.681 --> 01:23:23.170
<v Speaker 5>I mean some work needs to be done for sure.</v>

2905
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:24.010
<v Speaker 5>Do you stretch?</v>

2906
01:23:24.010 --> 01:23:24.850
<v Speaker 5>Are you stretching now?</v>

2907
01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:25.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah man.</v>

2908
01:23:25.490 --> 01:23:26.323
<v Speaker 5>He's stretching now.</v>

2909
01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:26.750
<v Speaker 5>Promise.</v>

2910
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:27.583
<v Speaker 5>Promise.</v>

2911
01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:28.713
<v Speaker 5>How much?</v>

2912
01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:29.673
<v Speaker 5>How much does that change?</v>

2913
01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:32.230
<v Speaker 5>Get obsessed with them up.</v>

2914
01:23:32.231 --> 01:23:32.650
<v Speaker 5>So that's what,</v>

2915
01:23:32.650 --> 01:23:32.780
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2916
01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:33.910
<v Speaker 5>but he didn't use a stretch.</v>

2917
01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:35.013
<v Speaker 5>A tall.</v>

2918
01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:36.700
<v Speaker 5>Did you use a stretch at all?</v>

2919
01:23:37.770 --> 01:23:38.131
<v Speaker 5>Crazy.</v>

2920
01:23:38.131 --> 01:23:43.131
<v Speaker 5>With my system come through my system and when I tell people,</v>

2921
01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:44.830
<v Speaker 5>when people ask me,</v>

2922
01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:46.390
<v Speaker 5>I want to learn the rubber guard,</v>

2923
01:23:46.391 --> 01:23:47.620
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to do that flexible stuff.</v>

2924
01:23:47.621 --> 01:23:48.550
<v Speaker 5>What do I have to do?</v>

2925
01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:49.811
<v Speaker 5>All I tell him,</v>

2926
01:23:49.811 --> 01:23:50.644
<v Speaker 5>I tell everyone,</v>

2927
01:23:50.650 --> 01:23:51.340
<v Speaker 5>every guy,</v>

2928
01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:54.220
<v Speaker 5>just all you gotta do is be able to get into the Bolus.</v>

2929
01:23:54.221 --> 01:23:56.290
<v Speaker 5>Basic Yoga positions of all time.</v>

2930
01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:57.790
<v Speaker 5>It is in a rubber guard position.</v>

2931
01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:00.460
<v Speaker 5>You're doing a lot of yoga.</v>

2932
01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:01.541
<v Speaker 5>I don't do yoga.</v>

2933
01:24:01.541 --> 01:24:02.560
<v Speaker 5>I do yoga stretches.</v>

2934
01:24:02.561 --> 01:24:02.830
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2935
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:04.150
<v Speaker 5>But what I'm saying is if you get,</v>

2936
01:24:04.210 --> 01:24:09.010
<v Speaker 5>if you can get into the most basic yoga position of all time load is full lotus,</v>

2937
01:24:09.250 --> 01:24:12.790
<v Speaker 5>it's a position that you have to learn in yoga.</v>

2938
01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:18.820
<v Speaker 5>I'll do some yoga and nobody has done yoga for 10 years and not been able to get</v>

2939
01:24:18.821 --> 01:24:19.570
<v Speaker 5>into Lotus.</v>

2940
01:24:19.570 --> 01:24:21.610
<v Speaker 5>Eventually you get into whether it's four years,</v>

2941
01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:22.181
<v Speaker 5>eight years,</v>

2942
01:24:22.181 --> 01:24:22.760
<v Speaker 5>six years.</v>

2943
01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:24.040
<v Speaker 5>It all depends on your work ethic.</v>

2944
01:24:24.190 --> 01:24:24.521
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

2945
01:24:24.521 --> 01:24:25.780
<v Speaker 5>But what I tell people,</v>

2946
01:24:25.781 --> 01:24:27.730
<v Speaker 5>if you can get into that basic,</v>

2947
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:30.970
<v Speaker 5>the most basic like Buddhas in the Lotus,</v>

2948
01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:32.110
<v Speaker 5>if you can get into that,</v>

2949
01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:35.680
<v Speaker 5>you can play all positions in grappling,</v>

2950
01:24:35.890 --> 01:24:36.820
<v Speaker 5>not just rubber guard,</v>

2951
01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:38.680
<v Speaker 5>very pliable.</v>

2952
01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:41.770
<v Speaker 5>And the real issue is there's a bunch of studies that have been done on</v>

2953
01:24:41.771 --> 01:24:44.470
<v Speaker 5>flexibility and there are a lot of them,</v>

2954
01:24:44.471 --> 01:24:45.221
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't say they're all,</v>

2955
01:24:45.221 --> 01:24:47.140
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of them are very flawed.</v>

2956
01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:50.440
<v Speaker 5>And I say this from a lifetime of working out with people,</v>

2957
01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:51.970
<v Speaker 5>teaching people,</v>

2958
01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.050
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2959
01:24:53.050 --> 01:24:53.651
<v Speaker 5>techniques,</v>

2960
01:24:53.651 --> 01:24:55.180
<v Speaker 5>especially kicking techniques,</v>

2961
01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:59.620
<v Speaker 5>seeing guys become more flexible and knowing my own flexibility limits that I</v>

2962
01:24:59.621 --> 01:25:04.030
<v Speaker 5>became very flexible and I became very flexible by going through pain.</v>

2963
01:25:04.150 --> 01:25:06.850
<v Speaker 5>So when they say like someone is only able to,</v>

2964
01:25:06.851 --> 01:25:07.151
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2965
01:25:07.151 --> 01:25:08.500
<v Speaker 5>get a certain amount of flexibility,</v>

2966
01:25:08.501 --> 01:25:08.950
<v Speaker 5>I say,</v>

2967
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:09.783
<v Speaker 5>how do you know?</v>

2968
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:10.271
<v Speaker 5>Did you,</v>

2969
01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:12.010
<v Speaker 5>do you know how much effort they put into it?</v>

2970
01:25:12.011 --> 01:25:14.770
<v Speaker 5>How much time are they putting in there to tell you what I did?</v>

2971
01:25:14.771 --> 01:25:18.970
<v Speaker 5>I put a fucking shit load of effort into the reason why I could do a full splits</v>

2972
01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:22.000
<v Speaker 5>like this way and this way and this way is because I didn't,</v>

2973
01:25:22.030 --> 01:25:23.860
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't do it when I first started doing taekwondo.</v>

2974
01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:25.090
<v Speaker 5>So Bro,</v>

2975
01:25:25.090 --> 01:25:25.923
<v Speaker 5>black forced it.</v>

2976
01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:28.553
<v Speaker 5>He's got better.</v>

2977
01:25:28.570 --> 01:25:32.140
<v Speaker 5>We were at a meeting one time and TV meeting and he and we were just like these,</v>

2978
01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:33.010
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2979
01:25:33.010 --> 01:25:36.160
<v Speaker 5>some people did a lot of TV and he just grabbed both his ankles.</v>

2980
01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:36.993
<v Speaker 5>I'm like hey,</v>

2981

2982
01:25:38.891 --> 01:25:39.724
<v Speaker 5>well I didn't like,</v>

2983
01:25:39.810 --> 01:25:41.200
<v Speaker 5>but I don't remember why I did it.</v>

2984
01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:42.700

2987
01:25:44.411 --> 01:25:45.071
<v Speaker 5>I'm really flexible.</v>

2989

01:25:48.881 --> 01:25:49.421
<v Speaker 5>Cause I don't know.</v>

2997
01:25:49.421 --> 01:25:50.254
<v Speaker 5>I just do it all.</v>

2998
01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:52.090
<v Speaker 5>And they asked me to show them something.</v>

2999
01:25:52.110 --> 01:25:52.943
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3000
01:25:53.070 --> 01:25:54.040
<v Speaker 5>We want to see some crazy,</v>

3001
01:25:54.041 --> 01:25:54.560
<v Speaker 5>watch this.</v>

3002
01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:57.700
<v Speaker 5>I grabbed both my ankles and I pulled them apart like this.</v>

3003
01:25:57.730 --> 01:25:59.550
<v Speaker 5>I can grab my ankles and I think you want to grow in this.</v>

3004
01:25:59.551 --> 01:26:02.280
<v Speaker 5>And now that picture is used for gate gifts.</v>

3005
01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:03.020
<v Speaker 5>And so that's a,</v>

3006
01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:04.850
<v Speaker 5>that's from a men's fitness.</v>

3007
01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:05.301
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>

3008
01:26:05.301 --> 01:26:05.481
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3009
01:26:05.481 --> 01:26:06.710
<v Speaker 5>when I did it was just for,</v>

3010
01:26:07.090 --> 01:26:09.220
<v Speaker 5>well congratulations out of the way you've got that.</v>

3011
01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:10.063
<v Speaker 5>You've held onto it.</v>

3012
01:26:10.330 --> 01:26:11.420
<v Speaker 5>We'll still do that.</v>

3013
01:26:11.490 --> 01:26:12.323
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3014
01:26:14.630 --> 01:26:15.381
<v Speaker 5>that was a war.</v>

3015
01:26:15.381 --> 01:26:15.991
<v Speaker 5>How long has that been?</v>

3016
01:26:15.991 --> 01:26:17.610
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3017
01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:20.180
<v Speaker 5>you can kick like a mule.</v>

3018
01:26:20.210 --> 01:26:20.421
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3019
01:26:20.421 --> 01:26:21.200
<v Speaker 5>I've seen he kicked,</v>

3020
01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.460
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen you do the legs.</v>

3021
01:26:22.461 --> 01:26:25.610
<v Speaker 5>Like you can't kick like that unless you're flexible.</v>

3022
01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:27.283
<v Speaker 5>You don't have that.</v>

3023
01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:30.020
<v Speaker 5>This is like a witness and a fluidity is part.</v>

3024
01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:32.960
<v Speaker 5>It's like when you see a guy who really knows how to punch,</v>

3025
01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:36.620
<v Speaker 5>one of the things you realize is they're not tense the whole way.</v>

3026
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:39.900
<v Speaker 5>It's not like it's like there's a,</v>

3027
01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:46.370
<v Speaker 5>at the end of it there's like boom and that's the same with kicking at the end</v>

3028
01:26:46.371 --> 01:26:46.790
<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>

3029
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:47.510
<v Speaker 5>There's like a,</v>

3030
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:50.150
<v Speaker 5>there's a witness and a crack.</v>

3031
01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:52.550
<v Speaker 5>It comes over and the the the,</v>

3032
01:26:52.551 --> 01:26:52.941
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3033
01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:57.941
<v Speaker 5>the amount of fluidity that you get and you're kicking is directly proportionate</v>

3034
01:26:58.341 --> 01:27:01.130
<v Speaker 5>to the amount of effort you put into your body type.</v>

3035
01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:03.050
<v Speaker 5>The bone structure is a lot of variables,</v>

3036
01:27:03.230 --> 01:27:05.060
<v Speaker 5>but a big one is flexibility.</v>

3037
01:27:05.061 --> 01:27:05.990
<v Speaker 5>That's a big one.</v>

3038
01:27:06.230 --> 01:27:07.910
<v Speaker 5>The more flexible you are,</v>

3039
01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:09.990
<v Speaker 5>the more you can fucking crack.</v>

3040
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:14.030
<v Speaker 5>It's going to sound as good a sound gay as fuck Brandon,</v>

3041
01:27:14.031 --> 01:27:14.900
<v Speaker 5>but man,</v>

<v Speaker 5>They always trip</v>

3048
01:27:38.210 --> 01:27:40.610
<v Speaker 5>where everybody trips the fuck out,</v>

3049
01:27:40.611 --> 01:27:41.000
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

01:27:44.181 --> 01:27:44.571

01:33:49.630 --> 01:33:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Gina said I was doing movies.</v>

3285
01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:51.813
<v Speaker 1>Fucking,</v>

3286
01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:53.890
<v Speaker 1>it was like a Brittany Spears concert.</v>

3287
01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:54.973
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

3288
01:33:55.330 --> 01:33:57.180
<v Speaker 1>There's never been a fight like that before.</v>

3289
01:33:57.181 --> 01:33:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Where did just chicks.</v>

3290
01:33:58.330 --> 01:33:58.421
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3291
01:33:58.421 --> 01:34:00.290
<v Speaker 1>this is pride bad to the bone,</v>

3292
01:34:00.330 --> 01:34:01.163
<v Speaker 1>handsome.</v>

3293
01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:03.670
<v Speaker 1>All Morocco was fighting somebody else back then.</v>

3294
01:34:03.671 --> 01:34:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

3295
01:34:04.010 --> 01:34:05.560
<v Speaker 1>he looked fucking different.</v>

3296
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:08.740
<v Speaker 1>He looked like street fighter Bolus.</v>

3297
01:34:08.741 --> 01:34:09.574
<v Speaker 1>We're done.</v>

3298
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.150
<v Speaker 1>It's really a shame that bus route and never fought in pride.</v>

3299
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:15.910
<v Speaker 1>It would have been really interesting to see him fight in pride.</v>

3300
01:34:16.150 --> 01:34:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Boss was a fucking murderer.</v>

3301
01:34:17.950 --> 01:34:18.783
<v Speaker 1>Do like,</v>

3302
01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:19.713
<v Speaker 1>whew.</v>

3303
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:20.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3304
01:34:20.330 --> 01:34:25.330
<v Speaker 1>was watching her real athlete first real striker in MMA when he fought in,</v>

3305
01:34:25.771 --> 01:34:26.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3306
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.861
<v Speaker 1>pancreas.</v>

3307
01:34:26.861 --> 01:34:27.520
<v Speaker 1>He got seat,</v>

3308
01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:28.990
<v Speaker 1>he threw kicks the guys like,</v>

3309
01:34:28.991 --> 01:34:30.690
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>

3310
01:34:30.850 --> 01:34:33.730
<v Speaker 1>I watched him hit a bad kick a bag with his shin.</v>

3311
01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:35.080
<v Speaker 1>It was the craziest thing I've ever started.</v>

3312
01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:36.940
<v Speaker 1>It sounded like a gun was going off.</v>

3313
01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:38.770
<v Speaker 1>You Never Seen Pedro his,</v>

3314
01:34:38.771 --> 01:34:38.871
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3315
01:34:38.871 --> 01:34:39.460
<v Speaker 1>kick her back.</v>

3316
01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:40.090
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3317
01:34:40.090 --> 01:34:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Pedro his own throw some life changing kicks on the bag.</v>

3318
01:34:43.150 --> 01:34:43.990
<v Speaker 1>His coach said he won't,</v>

3319
01:34:43.991 --> 01:34:45.050
<v Speaker 1>he won't hold myths warm.</v>

3320
01:34:45.810 --> 01:34:46.643
<v Speaker 1>What</v>

3321
01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:50.440
<v Speaker 1>he said he did it once with the hips are about this wide.</v>

3322
01:34:50.441 --> 01:34:50.771
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>

3323
01:34:50.771 --> 01:34:52.540
<v Speaker 1>They're literally about a quarter mile.</v>

3324
01:34:52.570 --> 01:34:54.670
<v Speaker 1>He's got God damn tree trunks for legs too.</v>

3325
01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:55.870
<v Speaker 1>But the thing about Pedro,</v>

3326
01:34:55.871 --> 01:34:56.110
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

3327
01:34:56.110 --> 01:34:56.943
<v Speaker 1>oh his man,</v>

3328
01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:58.460
<v Speaker 1>he would like,</v>

3329
01:34:58.550 --> 01:35:01.940
<v Speaker 1>he had really good technique to Real Holland style kickboxing,</v>

3330
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:06.020
<v Speaker 1>but he would hit guys with one leg kick and you would see them go like what?</v>

3331
01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:07.153
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3332
01:35:07.330 --> 01:35:10.280
<v Speaker 1>Because guys were used to eating a certain amount of leg kicks.</v>

3333
01:35:10.750 --> 01:35:11.161
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3334
01:35:11.161 --> 01:35:15.560
<v Speaker 1>like guys were hit anybody kicked legs the way Ernesto hoost does though I was</v>

3335
01:35:15.561 --> 01:35:16.394
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>

3336
01:35:16.930 --> 01:35:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Nesto was a technician,</v>

3337
01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:21.250
<v Speaker 1>but Ernesto hoost didn't have the kind of power that his overhead,</v>

3338
01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:22.520
<v Speaker 1>his jab,</v>

3339
01:35:22.521 --> 01:35:25.970
<v Speaker 1>right kick to the body and freakish power when his,</v>

3340
01:35:25.971 --> 01:35:26.091
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3341
01:35:26.091 --> 01:35:28.190
<v Speaker 1>fought Rico Rodriguez in um,</v>

3342
01:35:28.610 --> 01:35:29.443
<v Speaker 1>in the UFC,</v>

3343
01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:32.220
<v Speaker 1>he hit Rico with one leg kick like early in the fight.</v>

3344
01:35:32.221 --> 01:35:33.054
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

3345
01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:36.740
<v Speaker 1>and you could see the look on Rico's facing like fuck all this.</v>

3346
01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:40.070
<v Speaker 1>And Rico just completely adjusted and decided to survive.</v>

3347
01:35:40.130 --> 01:35:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3348
01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:44.930
<v Speaker 1>I key literally decided to survive from like the opening moments of that fight</v>

3349
01:35:45.230 --> 01:35:45.600
<v Speaker 1>he got.</v>

3350
01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.180
<v Speaker 1>It'll change your career so ruined your whole,</v>

3351
01:35:47.210 --> 01:35:47.510
<v Speaker 1>it'll,</v>

3352
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:48.320
<v Speaker 1>they'll just change everything.</v>

3353
01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:48.471
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3354
01:35:48.471 --> 01:35:49.131
<v Speaker 1>he fucked up.</v>

3355
01:35:49.131 --> 01:35:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Randleman so bad.</v>

3356
01:35:50.091 --> 01:35:50.391
<v Speaker 1>Random.</v>

3357
01:35:50.391 --> 01:35:52.580
<v Speaker 1>His legs are still damaged to this day.</v>

3358
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.690
<v Speaker 1>He's go,</v>

3359
01:35:53.690 --> 01:35:54.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3360
01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:57.080
<v Speaker 1>he's got crazy all over his leg.</v>

3361
01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:58.070
<v Speaker 1>He's got,</v>

3362
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:59.060
<v Speaker 1>who'd you say fade or?</v>

3363
01:35:59.690 --> 01:35:59.931
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3364
01:35:59.931 --> 01:36:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Randy couture.</v>

3365
01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3366
01:36:01.721 --> 01:36:02.554
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3367
01:36:02.810 --> 01:36:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Crazy dense Aly and I'm weird vein.</v>

3368
01:36:06.250 --> 01:36:06.800
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

3369
01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:08.350
<v Speaker 1>he broke their veins open.</v>

3370
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:09.830
<v Speaker 1>The veins recuperate,</v>

3371
01:36:09.831 --> 01:36:10.151
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

3372
01:36:10.151 --> 01:36:11.450
<v Speaker 1>they form new channels.</v>

3373
01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:12.470
<v Speaker 1>So like all over,</v>

3374
01:36:12.471 --> 01:36:12.981
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

3375
01:36:12.981 --> 01:36:13.171
<v Speaker 1>he has,</v>

3376
01:36:13.171 --> 01:36:18.171
<v Speaker 1>he's gnarly bubbling veins all over his leg where his oak kicked him.</v>

3377
01:36:18.710 --> 01:36:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that all over his leg.</v>

3378
01:36:20.931 --> 01:36:21.681
<v Speaker 1>I'm sick in the car.</v>

3379
01:36:21.681 --> 01:36:22.580
<v Speaker 1>I was going to get an MMA.</v>

3380
01:36:22.581 --> 01:36:23.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna stick to comedy.</v>

3381
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:26.600
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe he honest with me,</v>

3382
01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:27.470
<v Speaker 1>don't play with me.</v>

3383
01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:29.030
<v Speaker 1>See this is fade or versus fruit.</v>

3384
01:36:29.031 --> 01:36:29.361
<v Speaker 1>Geeta.</v>

3385
01:36:29.361 --> 01:36:31.610
<v Speaker 1>And this is like a fight where he got in the worst,</v>

3386
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:33.160
<v Speaker 1>the worst fatal.</v>

3387
01:36:33.161 --> 01:36:36.350
<v Speaker 1>It looks at these before and after in a body contest.</v>

3388
01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:37.730
<v Speaker 1>This looks like it before.</v>

3389
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3390
01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:38.810
<v Speaker 1>he's got,</v>

3391
01:36:38.810 --> 01:36:40.370
<v Speaker 1>he's got a bad stomach,</v>

3392
01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:41.293
<v Speaker 1>but look at this.</v>

3393
01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:42.433
<v Speaker 1>Watch this.</v>

3394
01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:43.880
<v Speaker 1>He knows how to throw those hammers.</v>

3395
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude.</v>

3396
01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:46.430
<v Speaker 1>He also knows how to surprise you.</v>

3397
01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:47.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean metal,</v>

3398
01:36:47.151 --> 01:36:48.330
<v Speaker 1>that soccer ticklish,</v>

3399
01:36:48.331 --> 01:36:50.790
<v Speaker 1>big soccer kicks for big and properly,</v>

3400
01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:51.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3401
01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Totally different experience,</v>

3402
01:36:52.401 --> 01:36:52.950
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3403
01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:53.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3404
01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:54.673
<v Speaker 1>not a good thing.</v>

3405
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:57.560
<v Speaker 1>And you could need of the head right when something's on the hasp knees.</v>

3406
01:36:58.120 --> 01:36:58.430
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3407
01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:59.270
<v Speaker 1>that's devastating.</v>

3408
01:36:59.271 --> 01:37:00.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised they don't have that.</v>

3409
01:37:00.231 --> 01:37:03.500
<v Speaker 1>And you have to say that that changed with cages.</v>

3410
01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:04.161
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>

3411
01:37:04.161 --> 01:37:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Why is that the cage?</v>

3412
01:37:05.151 --> 01:37:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Because you could trap a guy up,</v>

3413
01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:08.840
<v Speaker 1>stomp them soccer,</v>

3414
01:37:08.841 --> 01:37:09.290
<v Speaker 1>kick him.</v>

3415
01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3416
01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:12.530
<v Speaker 1>The thing about the ropes as you can slide around underneath it and avoid stuff,</v>

3417
01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:12.890
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3418
01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:14.300
<v Speaker 1>It's good in that respect.</v>

3419
01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:17.010
<v Speaker 1>There's probably a better solution.</v>

3420
01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:18.290
<v Speaker 1>Someone hasn't figured out yet.</v>

3421
01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:19.153
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is,</v>

3422
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:20.211
<v Speaker 1>but here's a,</v>

3423
01:37:20.211 --> 01:37:25.010
<v Speaker 1>here's where it gets rocked like fate or comes in on Fujita and Fujita throws a</v>

3424
01:37:25.011 --> 01:37:27.920
<v Speaker 1>fucking hammer his way and Fujita look at the sides of his head.</v>

3425
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:29.660
<v Speaker 1>He was a big dude.</v>

3426
01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:31.070
<v Speaker 1>He's all fucked up too.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Put a black suit on him and he's the odd job.</v>

3434
01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:44.180
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad guy from James Bond.</v>

3442
01:37:57.691 --> 01:37:58.950
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get them off him with grief.</v>

3443

<v Speaker 1>Hook was so strong.</v>

3446
01:38:02.250 --> 01:38:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Then when he got hit,</v>

3447
01:38:03.151 --> 01:38:03.630
<v Speaker 1>he just took off.</v>

3448
01:38:03.630 --> 01:38:04.650
<v Speaker 1>He was able to hold on.</v>

3449
01:38:04.651 --> 01:38:05.940
<v Speaker 1>There's the ref cam right there.</v>

3450
01:38:06.210 --> 01:38:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He just took a bad,</v>

3452
01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:11.430
<v Speaker 1>the ref cam is pretty bad ass Christ and if they had a ref cam today it would be</v>

3573
01:41:06.641 --> 01:41:08.590
<v Speaker 1>especially was a real,</v>

3574
01:41:08.591 --> 01:41:13.591
<v Speaker 1>it was a real education in what happens when an elite striker gets good at</v>

3575
01:41:14.651 --> 01:41:16.000
<v Speaker 1>takedown defense.</v>

3576
01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:17.500
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

3577
01:41:17.501 --> 01:41:18.221
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

3578
01:41:18.221 --> 01:41:21.220
<v Speaker 1>There's something that happens to these guys when they get really good at</v>

3579
01:41:21.221 --> 01:41:23.470
<v Speaker 1>takedown defense where they start,</v>

3580
01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:27.760
<v Speaker 1>they start figuring it all out and then they get loose on their feet and then</v>

3581
01:41:27.761 --> 01:41:32.200
<v Speaker 1>you see the gap between them and an other people.</v>

3582
01:41:32.380 --> 01:41:34.420
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

3583
01:41:34.421 --> 01:41:34.571
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3585
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:36.670
<v Speaker 1>did Vandelay fight?</v>

3586
01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:40.490
<v Speaker 1>I have to start taking my take down defense and my deep,</v>

3587
01:41:40.650 --> 01:41:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I take down defense a lot more seriously.</v>

3588
01:41:42.161 --> 01:41:42.820
<v Speaker 1>That happened.</v>

3589
01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:43.780
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>

3590
01:41:43.810 --> 01:41:44.643

3591
01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:45.920
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck.</v>

3592
01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:47.410
<v Speaker 1>This is the big one.</v>

3593

<v Speaker 1>This is when,</v>

3594
01:41:48.370 --> 01:41:48.611
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3595
01:41:48.611 --> 01:41:53.590
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason Vandelay decided that he was going to go up to heavyweight.</v>

3596
01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:54.920
<v Speaker 1>Is there going to be a hangover?</v>

01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:22.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3614
01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:24.640
<v Speaker 1>but this is Vandelay as a heavyweight.</v>

3615
01:42:24.641 --> 01:42:25.750
<v Speaker 1>He was two 18 here.</v>

01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:36.760
<v Speaker 1>This is when he was sponsored by Purina.</v>

3623
01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:37.751

<v Speaker 1>That shit was on.</v>

3632
01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:48.550
<v Speaker 1>He was so gangster.</v>

3633
01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:50.800
<v Speaker 1>He was so much better before the tattoo.</v>

3634
01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:52.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

01:42:54.071 --> 01:42:54.821
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about Cro.</v>

3638
01:42:54.821 --> 01:42:55.091
<v Speaker 1>Cop.</v>

3639
01:42:55.091 --> 01:42:55.924
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

3640
01:42:56.110 --> 01:42:58.060
<v Speaker 1>look at this hammer fist.</v>

3641
01:42:58.510 --> 01:42:59.343
<v Speaker 1>He was just,</v>

3642
01:42:59.410 --> 01:43:00.131
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3643
01:43:00.131 --> 01:43:03.190
<v Speaker 1>He was just fucking Vandelay up in this fight.</v>

3644
01:43:03.191 --> 01:43:04.024
<v Speaker 1>So strong.</v>

3645
01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:05.680
<v Speaker 1>He was so good back then.</v>

3646
01:43:07.690 --> 01:43:10.030
<v Speaker 1>He would just that kick to the body and the opening round.</v>

3647
01:43:10.031 --> 01:43:11.320
<v Speaker 1>I could watch that all day long.</v>

3648
01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:14.290
<v Speaker 1>That shit was ridiculous for sure.</v>

3649
01:43:14.291 --> 01:43:16.060
<v Speaker 1>The greatest left kicker ever.</v>

3650
01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:17.013
<v Speaker 1>Ever.</v>

3651
01:43:19.110 --> 01:43:21.220
<v Speaker 1>How much different is wonderland look now?</v>

3652
01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Driving a different face lift or whatever he did?</v>

3653
01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3654
01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:24.071
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3655
01:43:24.071 --> 01:43:29.071
<v Speaker 1>it is a piece of rib taken out to reconstruct his nose and he had his nose made</v>

3656
01:43:29.351 --> 01:43:31.510
<v Speaker 1>extra large so he'd get more air in it.</v>

3657
01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:33.430
<v Speaker 1>You know what have they got a more pussy.</v>

3658
01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

3659
01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:34.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it did.</v>

3660
01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:36.680
<v Speaker 1>He's always agree with it,</v>

3661
01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:40.120
<v Speaker 1>but watch this shit man.</v>

3662
01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:43.390
<v Speaker 1>This is rough because he was already beaten up.</v>

3663
01:43:43.391 --> 01:43:44.370
<v Speaker 1>He was already beating out.</v>

3664
01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:45.101
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>

3665
01:43:45.101 --> 01:43:45.934
<v Speaker 1>straight left.</v>

3666
01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Mirko was so goddamn laser beam accurate back then too.</v>

3667
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:54.260
<v Speaker 1>He's just fucking going off on Vandelay.</v>

3668
01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:56.600
<v Speaker 1>There's also the first fight,</v>

3669
01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:59.810
<v Speaker 1>which is maybe the scariest fucking stare down ever.</v>

3670
01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Ever.</v>

3671
01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Hands down when Vandelay and cro cop was standing vandelays doing all his normal</v>

3674
01:44:10.850 --> 01:44:11.121

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3677
01:44:13.041 --> 01:44:16.070
<v Speaker 1>That was the only time Vander Lee has ever been out.</v>

3678
01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3684
01:44:20.630 --> 01:44:21.463
<v Speaker 1>It was the only time.</v>

3685
01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Usually we see cro go still finding he's fighting.</v>

3686
01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:26.421

3692
01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:35.601
<v Speaker 1>The heavyweight one.</v>

3693
01:44:35.601 --> 01:44:37.550
<v Speaker 1>A version of a Grand Prix.</v>

3694
01:44:37.610 --> 01:44:38.443
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3695
01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Like a year ago.</v>

3696
01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:39.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3697
01:44:39.971 --> 01:44:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Look at Vandalia</v>

3698
01:44:42.850 --> 01:44:43.970
<v Speaker 1>knows how to curve.</v>

3699
01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:45.500
<v Speaker 1>It was mashed.</v>

3700
01:44:45.650 --> 01:44:47.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of guys like that,</v>

3701
01:44:47.190 --> 01:44:48.680
<v Speaker 1>so they get that sense that,</v>

3702
01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.470
<v Speaker 1>that smash part of the middle of the nose.</v>

3703
01:44:52.350 --> 01:44:52.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3704
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:53.180
<v Speaker 1>he wants to fight.</v>

3705
01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:54.013
<v Speaker 1>Look in his eyes.</v>

3706
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:55.970
<v Speaker 1>The doctor's going to stop it.</v>

3707
01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:57.673
<v Speaker 1>That's all fake.</v>

3708
01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:00.600
<v Speaker 1>They very rarely kind of dots in Japan for</v>

3709
01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:03.320
<v Speaker 1>giving him a break</v>

3710
01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:05.750
<v Speaker 1>to let them recharge.</v>

3711
01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Make the fight better.</v>

3712
01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3713
01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:08.780
<v Speaker 1>So they create some drama.</v>

3714
01:45:08.781 --> 01:45:09.460
<v Speaker 1>They make it look great.</v>

3715
01:45:09.460 --> 01:45:10.293
<v Speaker 1>They might stop it.</v>

3716
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's horrifying.</v>

3863
01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3864
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Well he was one of those dudes,</v>

3865
01:48:51.921 --> 01:48:55.850
<v Speaker 1>man that's caught me with that kick the way he moved and that's awful.</v>

3866
01:48:55.851 --> 01:48:56.870
<v Speaker 1>So different.</v>

3867
01:48:57.170 --> 01:48:58.220
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't no world.</v>

3868
01:48:58.250 --> 01:49:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

3869
01:49:00.530 --> 01:49:01.341
<v Speaker 1>Oh Christ.</v>

3870
01:49:01.341 --> 01:49:02.060
<v Speaker 1>That's so bad.</v>

3871
01:49:02.060 --> 01:49:03.530
<v Speaker 1>He moved so different back.</v>

3872
01:49:03.531 --> 01:49:04.460
<v Speaker 1>He looks dead dude.</v>

3873
01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:08.330
<v Speaker 1>By the time he got into the UFC and you kind of wonder,</v>

3874
01:49:08.450 --> 01:49:08.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3875
01:49:08.721 --> 01:49:09.500
<v Speaker 1>because of the,</v>

3876
01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:12.770
<v Speaker 1>what they did in pride as far as like the drug testing and shit.</v>

3877
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:16.670
<v Speaker 1>You gotta wonder what these guys were and weren't on back then.</v>

3878
01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:20.980
<v Speaker 1>And then you get off of it and there's this like this period where your body's</v>

3879
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.990
<v Speaker 1>just not the same.</v>

3880
01:49:21.991 --> 01:49:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3881
01:49:22.490 --> 01:49:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Like a perfect example that I always use is Roy Jones Jr.</v>

3882
01:49:26.270 --> 01:49:28.460
<v Speaker 1>When Roy Jones jr fought John Ruiz,</v>

3883
01:49:28.610 --> 01:49:32.000
<v Speaker 1>he got up to like 199 pounds,</v>

3884
01:49:32.001 --> 01:49:33.050
<v Speaker 1>like ripped,</v>

3885
01:49:33.170 --> 01:49:33.981
<v Speaker 1>shredded.</v>

3886
01:49:33.981 --> 01:49:38.810
<v Speaker 1>And then he got to go all the way down to one 75 when he fought Antonio Tarver</v>

3887
01:49:38.811 --> 01:49:41.210
<v Speaker 1>after that and he looked like dog.</v>

3888
01:49:41.211 --> 01:49:41.471
<v Speaker 1>She just,</v>

3889
01:49:41.471 --> 01:49:42.350
<v Speaker 1>when he got knocked out,</v>

3890
01:49:42.351 --> 01:49:46.070
<v Speaker 1>right Tarver was the first guy to stop him and Tara didn't just knock them out.</v>

3891
01:49:46.071 --> 01:49:46.940
<v Speaker 1>He changed his career,</v>

3892
01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:47.853
<v Speaker 1>changed everything.</v>

3893
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Then after that he fucked Glen Johnson.</v>

3894
01:49:49.631 --> 01:49:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Glen Johnson knocked him out bad.</v>

3895
01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:52.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3896
01:49:52.151 --> 01:49:52.641
<v Speaker 1>they said that,</v>

3897
01:49:52.641 --> 01:49:53.020
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3898
01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:58.020
<v Speaker 1>that he was so gifted physically and so fast that he actually did he that when</v>

3899
01:49:58.031 --> 01:50:01.660
<v Speaker 1>he lost a step because he didn't really have to work on fundamentals the way</v>

3900
01:50:01.661 --> 01:50:03.610
<v Speaker 1>somebody who wasn't that fast fasted.</v>

3901
01:50:03.970 --> 01:50:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Once he lost his step,</v>

3902
01:50:04.991 --> 01:50:07.360
<v Speaker 1>he was getting knocked out by guys who were really educated.</v>

3903
01:50:07.361 --> 01:50:08.320
<v Speaker 1>It was so fun to watch,</v>

3904
01:50:08.321 --> 01:50:08.650
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3905
01:50:08.650 --> 01:50:08.801
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3906
01:50:08.801 --> 01:50:09.634
<v Speaker 1>he's the best.</v>

3907
01:50:09.730 --> 01:50:10.563
<v Speaker 1>My favorite ever.</v>

3908
01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:11.490
<v Speaker 1>I hate her.</v>

3909
01:50:11.490 --> 01:50:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Not that Mayweather pack yell.</v>

3910
01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:13.541
<v Speaker 1>Foot's going to happen.</v>

3911
01:50:13.541 --> 01:50:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

3912
01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

3913
01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:15.220
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're saying.</v>

3914
01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Whether you call them out,</v>

3915
01:50:17.890 --> 01:50:19.060
<v Speaker 1>call them out and then pack.</v>

3916
01:50:19.070 --> 01:50:19.331
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3917
01:50:19.331 --> 01:50:19.571
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

3918
01:50:19.571 --> 01:50:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Money's not an issue.</v>

3919
01:50:20.411 --> 01:50:21.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about the money.</v>

3920
01:50:21.281 --> 01:50:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Let's just make it out because money was what was holding it up.</v>

3921
01:50:24.580 --> 01:50:28.660
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be the biggest money making papers they've done about five years</v>

3922
01:50:28.661 --> 01:50:29.494
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

3923
01:50:29.530 --> 01:50:29.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3924
01:50:29.741 --> 01:50:30.940
<v Speaker 1>But this is a good time for it.</v>

3925
01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.830
<v Speaker 1>It would have been better five years ago,</v>

3926
01:50:32.831 --> 01:50:33.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's still really good.</v>

3927
01:50:33.740 --> 01:50:34.650
<v Speaker 1>So what he did to,</v>

3928
01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:35.411
<v Speaker 1>to Algeria,</v>

3929
01:50:35.411 --> 01:50:36.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's just took his whole game.</v>

3930
01:50:36.551 --> 01:50:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Well Algeria not on his level.</v>

3931
01:50:39.221 --> 01:50:43.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'll do it really do I really know that before the fight when you listen</v>

3932
01:50:43.211 --> 01:50:43.631
<v Speaker 1>to people,</v>

3933
01:50:43.631 --> 01:50:46.030
<v Speaker 1>they weren't saying that he was going to get out class that everyone knew was</v>

3934
01:50:46.031 --> 01:50:47.560
<v Speaker 1>too big of a jump for Algeria though.</v>

3935
01:50:47.890 --> 01:50:48.910
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hear that.</v>

3936
01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:49.773
<v Speaker 1>I heard,</v>

3937
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:52.320
<v Speaker 1>think about first off,</v>

3938
01:50:52.350 --> 01:50:53.270
<v Speaker 1>personal drunk guys,</v>

3939
01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:55.143
<v Speaker 1>vertical hunter,</v>

3940
01:50:55.380 --> 01:50:55.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3941
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:56.351
<v Speaker 1>Bradley,</v>

3942
01:50:56.351 --> 01:51:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Tim Bradley and they were talking and they were very respectful of Algeria.</v>

3943
01:51:00.710 --> 01:51:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Like a plus 1200 underdog.</v>

3944
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:06.250
<v Speaker 1>No one gave him a shot like Vegas.</v>

3945
01:51:06.251 --> 01:51:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Like he's exactly how you would think of a guy.</v>

3946
01:51:08.150 --> 01:51:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Lived with his parents,</v>

3947
01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:11.553
<v Speaker 1>which he does.</v>

3948
01:51:13.090 --> 01:51:13.650
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>

3949
01:51:13.650 --> 01:51:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3950
01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:15.730
<v Speaker 1>He lives with his parents in the basement,</v>

3951
01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:16.630
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have,</v>

3952
01:51:16.630 --> 01:51:17.410
<v Speaker 1>he has money now.</v>

3953
01:51:17.410 --> 01:51:18.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean he beat providing the cough.</v>

3954
01:51:18.701 --> 01:51:20.650
<v Speaker 1>I know he made some money and decide he's going to keep us</v>

3955
01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:24.100
<v Speaker 1>200,000 miles.</v>

3956
01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:25.660
<v Speaker 1>I like him even more.</v>

3957
01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:28.080
<v Speaker 1>He just said it likes to be around his family plot.</v>

3958
01:51:28.090 --> 01:51:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Mayweather.</v>

3959
01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Don't be a box in a humbug.</v>

3960
01:51:30.070 --> 01:51:32.020
<v Speaker 1>Give the fans the fight they want.</v>

3961
01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:33.820
<v Speaker 1>They have waited long enough.</v>

3962
01:51:33.821 --> 01:51:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3963
01:51:34.450 --> 01:51:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Dang son.</v>

3964
01:51:35.670 --> 01:51:37.820
<v Speaker 1>I like the dot right before Floyd Mayweather.</v>

3965
01:51:38.050 --> 01:51:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Let everybody know.</v>

3966
01:51:39.630 --> 01:51:41.720
<v Speaker 1>We'll put the little period before for Amanda,</v>

3967
01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:43.990
<v Speaker 1>so it's not just in his APP mentions.</v>

3968
01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:44.291
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3969
01:51:44.291 --> 01:51:45.330
<v Speaker 1>so if you go dot.</v>

3970
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:47.580
<v Speaker 1>I just learned that it's kind of a lame,</v>

3971
01:51:48.010 --> 01:51:48.820
<v Speaker 1>that call out.</v>

3972
01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Don't be a humbug.</v>

3973
01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:50.793
<v Speaker 1>Cute.</v>

3974
01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:51.491
<v Speaker 1>That's what he is.</v>

3975
01:51:51.491 --> 01:51:52.051
<v Speaker 1>He's a nice guy.</v>

3976
01:51:52.051 --> 01:51:52.450
<v Speaker 1>His yes.</v>

3977
01:51:52.450 --> 01:51:53.111
<v Speaker 1>He's a nice guy.</v>

3978
01:51:53.111 --> 01:51:53.980
<v Speaker 1>That fucks people up.</v>

3979
01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3980
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:55.450
<v Speaker 1>He's an interesting guy.</v>

3981
01:51:55.451 --> 01:51:57.710
<v Speaker 1>They did a thing on skeleton.</v>

3982
01:51:57.720 --> 01:51:58.553
<v Speaker 1>These facial hair</v>

3983
01:52:00.190 --> 01:52:01.023
<v Speaker 1>feel</v>

3984
01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Bieber haircut with a gang gets Khan</v>

3985
01:52:05.710 --> 01:52:06.400
<v Speaker 1>who stops.</v>

3986
01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:09.940
<v Speaker 1>They did a analysis of like his skeleton apparently has a very,</v>

3987
01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:11.440
<v Speaker 1>very large wrists,</v>

3988
01:52:11.710 --> 01:52:12.543
<v Speaker 1>big bones.</v>

3989
01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:13.930
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about like the d.</v>

3990
01:52:14.010 --> 01:52:17.800
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why he's been able to carry his punching power up through the</v>

3991
01:52:17.801 --> 01:52:21.130
<v Speaker 1>ranks and why he's so successful and knocking guys out and they,</v>

3992
01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:21.491
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3993
01:52:21.491 --> 01:52:25.180
<v Speaker 1>there's a direct correlation between the size of certain parts of your bones,</v>

3994
01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:26.890
<v Speaker 1>particularly like wrist size,</v>

3995
01:52:27.450 --> 01:52:28.470
<v Speaker 1>like wrist size is like,</v>

3996
01:52:28.750 --> 01:52:30.230
<v Speaker 1>his cats are huge,</v>

3997
01:52:30.970 --> 01:52:31.803
<v Speaker 1>huge lessons.</v>

3998
01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:32.673
<v Speaker 1>Manny Pacquiao,</v>

3999
01:52:32.730 --> 01:52:33.620
<v Speaker 1>his speed,</v>

4000
01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:34.533
<v Speaker 1>his speed,</v>

4001
01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:35.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's speed.</v>

4002
01:52:35.710 --> 01:52:36.580
<v Speaker 1>It's just so awkward.</v>

4003
01:52:36.730 --> 01:52:37.660
<v Speaker 1>He's just a beast.</v>

4004
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:40.240

01:56:09.301 --> 01:56:10.290
<v Speaker 3>he's making all this money.</v>

4152
01:56:10.410 --> 01:56:11.400
<v Speaker 3>He's taken people down.</v>

4153
01:56:11.401 --> 01:56:12.234
<v Speaker 3>You could do this.</v>

4154
01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:14.070
<v Speaker 3>And then they twisted his arm.</v>

4155
01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:17.820
<v Speaker 3>He signed a deal with the UFC and then backed out of it cause he,</v>

4156
01:56:17.821 --> 01:56:19.500
<v Speaker 3>he just was not confident.</v>

4157
01:56:19.710 --> 01:56:20.790
<v Speaker 3>And then he decided,</v>

4158
01:56:20.791 --> 01:56:21.330
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>

4159
01:56:21.330 --> 01:56:25.830
<v Speaker 3>maybe all he got off an offer in Brazil to do an eight man tournament.</v>

4160
01:56:26.070 --> 01:56:26.461
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

4161
01:56:26.461 --> 01:56:26.880
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4162

<v Speaker 3>See how I do and then now we'll evaluate.</v>

4166
01:56:34.650 --> 01:56:35.071
<v Speaker 3>After that,</v>

4167
01:56:35.071 --> 01:56:36.150
<v Speaker 3>he went down to Brazil.</v>

4168
01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:37.800
<v Speaker 3>He was scared shitless.</v>

4169
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:39.150
<v Speaker 3>Mark Kerr was scared shitless,</v>

4170
01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:40.710

4186
01:57:03.390 --> 01:57:04.230
<v Speaker 3>It was terrible.</v>

4187
01:57:04.260 --> 01:57:07.290
<v Speaker 3>He was supposed to win $20,000 a promoter of the show said,</v>

4188
01:57:07.490 --> 01:57:07.710
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

4193
01:57:14.610 --> 01:57:15.510
<v Speaker 3>When he finally got home,</v>

4194
01:57:15.511 --> 01:57:15.721
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

4195
01:57:15.721 --> 01:57:16.980
<v Speaker 3>I'll never do this again.</v>

4196
01:57:16.981 --> 01:57:18.760
<v Speaker 3>But he started reading stuff on the Internet about,</v>

4197
01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:21.310
<v Speaker 3>they started calling him the smashing machine and,</v>

4198
01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:22.220
<v Speaker 3>and in Brazil,</v>

4200
01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:26.880
<v Speaker 3>and all of a sudden he thought,</v>

01:57:26.881 --> 01:57:27.714
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>

4202

01:57:31.141 --> 01:57:32.240
<v Speaker 3>And then that is funny.</v>

4205

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4206
01:57:32.610 --> 01:57:33.720
<v Speaker 1>If you want to freak out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean he's allowed to take whatever he wants.</v>

4232
01:58:19.770 --> 01:58:20.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's just,</v>

4233
01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:21.750
<v Speaker 1>he was so much bigger.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He was a hundred pounds.</v>

4235
01:58:22.670 --> 01:58:24.420

4240
01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:32.070
<v Speaker 1>We see it all the Tate Tate was in that movie,</v>

4241
01:58:32.071 --> 01:58:34.250
<v Speaker 1>the longest yard with him and a tape.</v>

4242
01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Tate was like,</v>

4243
01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:37.620
<v Speaker 1>the dude carries around doctor's bag everywhere he goes.</v>

4244
01:58:38.250 --> 01:58:39.083
<v Speaker 1>He's just got,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You</v>

4247
01:58:42.190 --> 01:58:42.591
<v Speaker 5>can hear it.</v>

4248
01:58:42.591 --> 01:58:44.080
<v Speaker 5>He was terrified to fight.</v>

4249
01:58:44.290 --> 01:58:48.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure they said he'd be in the back like just a super nice guy.</v>

4250
01:58:48.250 --> 01:58:49.540
<v Speaker 5>Super Nice Guy.</v>

4251
01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:50.890
<v Speaker 5>Like a smart,</v>

4252
01:58:51.490 --> 01:58:51.880
<v Speaker 5>smart.</v>

4253
01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:55.600
<v Speaker 5>Ivan salivary is a friend of mine and he's really close with Bob Sapp and he's</v>

4254
01:58:55.601 --> 01:58:56.620
<v Speaker 5>just like the sweetest,</v>

4255
01:58:56.650 --> 01:59:00.250
<v Speaker 5>nicest guy ever who just found a way to make cash.</v>

4256
01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:02.770
<v Speaker 5>I heard he made a killing and ships in Japan.</v>

4257
01:59:02.790 --> 01:59:03.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4258
01:59:03.110 --> 01:59:04.180
<v Speaker 5>But then it all went away,</v>

4259
01:59:04.230 --> 01:59:04.531
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4260
01:59:04.531 --> 01:59:06.150
<v Speaker 2>It all went away in a big way.</v>

4261
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:07.290
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>

4262
01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:07.680
<v Speaker 2>when he,</v>

4263
01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:09.150
<v Speaker 2>when he backed out of k one,</v>

4264
01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:09.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4265
01:59:09.511 --> 01:59:10.111
<v Speaker 2>that whole deal,</v>

4266
01:59:10.111 --> 01:59:10.510
<v Speaker 2>like they were,</v>

4267
01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:13.230
<v Speaker 2>they the Yakuza apparently allegedly,</v>

4268
01:59:13.410 --> 01:59:14.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4269
01:59:14.010 --> 01:59:14.641
<v Speaker 2>due to,</v>

4270
01:59:14.641 --> 01:59:14.721
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4271
01:59:14.721 --> 01:59:15.554
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4272
01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:19.680
<v Speaker 2>unforeseen circumstances did not have the contract ready for him.</v>

4273
01:59:20.190 --> 01:59:22.710
<v Speaker 2>And they were trying to get them to fight without a contract.</v>

4274
01:59:22.711 --> 01:59:23.041
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

4275
01:59:23.041 --> 01:59:23.641
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

4276
01:59:23.641 --> 01:59:24.890
<v Speaker 2>So he backed out of the,</v>

4277
01:59:24.891 --> 01:59:27.700
<v Speaker 2>the main event and like they don't play that shit.</v>

4278
01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:28.590
<v Speaker 2>Don't play that shit.</v>

4279
01:59:28.591 --> 01:59:30.030
<v Speaker 2>Like he was worried about his life.</v>

4280
01:59:30.090 --> 01:59:30.271
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4281
01:59:30.271 --> 01:59:31.680
<v Speaker 2>look at the size of him here.</v>

4282
01:59:32.070 --> 01:59:32.970
<v Speaker 2>Good Lord.</v>

4283
01:59:35.210 --> 01:59:37.230
<v Speaker 2>No Garris still trying for that takedown.</v>

4284
01:59:37.290 --> 01:59:38.750
<v Speaker 2>And that gets probably all jacked up.</v>

4285
01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:39.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4286
01:59:39.351 --> 01:59:41.540
<v Speaker 2>But if he was who some are Paul Harvest it,</v>

4287
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:42.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4288
01:59:42.710 --> 01:59:44.150
<v Speaker 2>he could have at least grabbed a hold of</v>

4289
01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:46.220
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4290
01:59:46.220 --> 01:59:46.601
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

4291
01:59:46.601 --> 01:59:47.411
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to go through them.</v>

4292
01:59:47.411 --> 01:59:48.101
<v Speaker 5>I got to pull guard,</v>

4293
01:59:48.101 --> 01:59:49.810

02:09:15.551 --> 02:09:16.211
<v Speaker 4>I was fighting.</v>

4689
02:09:16.211 --> 02:09:17.200
<v Speaker 4>I have a whole story about it.</v>

02:09:19.210 --> 02:09:19.931
<v Speaker 4>no it wasn't,</v>

4693
02:09:19.931 --> 02:09:21.040
<v Speaker 4>but that wasn't,</v>

4694
02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:22.870
<v Speaker 4>I was not trying to pick up prostitutes.</v>

4695
02:09:23.230 --> 02:09:25.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm see the story that you tell me what he was doing it,</v>

4696
02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:26.980
<v Speaker 4>I have paid for sex.</v>

4697
02:09:27.010 --> 02:09:27.221
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

4698
02:09:27.221 --> 02:09:29.110
<v Speaker 4>Anyone who knows me knows that and I believe in it.</v>

4699
02:09:29.111 --> 02:09:29.944
<v Speaker 4>I just haven't done it.</v>

4700
02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:31.330
<v Speaker 4>I believe it,</v>

4701
02:09:31.331 --> 02:09:31.781
<v Speaker 4>believe in it.</v>

4702
02:09:31.781 --> 02:09:33.160
<v Speaker 4>I think it really does exist.</v>

4703
02:09:33.161 --> 02:09:34.210
<v Speaker 4>It's not Santa Claus.</v>

4704
02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:34.930
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

4705
02:09:34.930 --> 02:09:35.281
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

4706
02:09:35.281 --> 02:09:36.310
<v Speaker 4>and I don't do it.</v>

4707
02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:39.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't do it in my adult years because I don't want to.</v>

4708
02:09:39.610 --> 02:09:40.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

4709
02:09:40.020 --> 02:09:40.151
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4710
02:09:40.151 --> 02:09:40.871
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't turn me on.</v>

4711
02:09:40.871 --> 02:09:41.710
<v Speaker 4>And for a lot of reasons,</v>

4712
02:09:41.711 --> 02:09:42.640
<v Speaker 4>I just don't want to be part of it.</v>

4713
02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:43.473
<v Speaker 4>But you're married.</v>

4714
02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:44.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4715
02:09:44.020 --> 02:09:44.231
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4716
02:09:44.231 --> 02:09:45.041
<v Speaker 4>but even if I wasn't married,</v>

4717
02:09:45.041 --> 02:09:47.290
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't do it because I have my own spot.</v>

4718
02:09:47.630 --> 02:09:49.450
<v Speaker 4>You want someone to be attracted to?</v>

4719
02:09:49.460 --> 02:09:51.610
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what it is.</v>

4720
02:09:52.410 --> 02:09:54.790
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to contribute to someone else's destruction.</v>

4721
02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:55.601
<v Speaker 4>There are a lot of reasons.</v>

4722
02:09:55.601 --> 02:09:56.560
<v Speaker 4>I have a philosophy behind it.</v>

4723
02:09:56.561 --> 02:09:57.120
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter.</v>

4724
02:09:57.120 --> 02:09:57.470
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

4725
02:09:57.470 --> 02:09:57.800

02:13:10.690 --> 02:13:11.523
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

4874
02:13:12.620 --> 02:13:13.160
<v Speaker 4>I really didn't.</v>

4875
02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:13.581

02:13:16.770 --> 02:13:17.720
<v Speaker 4>actually take credit cards.</v>

4881
02:13:17.721 --> 02:13:18.850
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like the way she did it.</v>

4882
02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:21.530
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't like the way she was trying to pull a fast one on me.</v>

4883
02:13:21.890 --> 02:13:23.240
<v Speaker 4>That is hilarious.</v>

4884
02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:23.541
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

4885
02:13:23.541 --> 02:13:24.830
<v Speaker 4>you gotta be careful these days.</v>

4886
02:13:24.860 --> 02:13:26.030
<v Speaker 4>These hoes ain't loyal</v>

4887
02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:31.870
<v Speaker 4>their John.</v>

4888
02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:32.953
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4889
02:13:33.620 --> 02:13:34.453
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>

4890
02:13:35.190 --> 02:13:38.760
<v Speaker 2>my real problem with all of it is when you make something illegal,</v>

4891
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:43.770
<v Speaker 2>it puts all this extra energy in something because you create consequences.</v>

4892
02:13:43.771 --> 02:13:46.830
<v Speaker 2>The consequences being you could go to jail,</v>

4893
02:13:46.831 --> 02:13:47.790
<v Speaker 2>crime,</v>

4894
02:13:47.791 --> 02:13:48.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4895
02:13:48.210 --> 02:13:49.830
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of issues can happen.</v>

4896
02:13:49.950 --> 02:13:50.311
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

4897
02:13:50.311 --> 02:13:50.910
<v Speaker 2>is it a,</v>

4898
02:13:50.910 --> 02:13:51.840
<v Speaker 2>it's a misdemeanor.</v>

4899
02:13:51.841 --> 02:13:52.770
<v Speaker 2>So as a prostitution,</v>

4900
02:13:52.771 --> 02:13:53.100
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

4901
02:13:53.100 --> 02:13:54.000
<v Speaker 2>that's not a felonies.</v>

4902
02:13:54.001 --> 02:13:57.930
<v Speaker 2>She still get knocked down to carry a gun and you could still vote,</v>

4903
02:13:57.931 --> 02:13:58.764
<v Speaker 2>but either way,</v>

4904
02:13:58.950 --> 02:13:59.990
<v Speaker 2>the idea behind her,</v>

4905
02:14:00.130 --> 02:14:03.030
<v Speaker 2>they're taking what your freedom and putting you in the system.</v>

4906
02:14:03.210 --> 02:14:06.230
<v Speaker 2>You also probably have to register as some sort of a sex offender</v>

4907
02:14:07.980 --> 02:14:08.560
<v Speaker 2>dates.</v>

4908
02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:09.160
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>

4909
02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:11.940
<v Speaker 2>I had a bed in some states in Calabasas for sure.</v>

4910
02:14:12.690 --> 02:14:13.141
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

4911
02:14:13.141 --> 02:14:15.000
<v Speaker 2>You're not a street man.</v>

4912
02:14:15.001 --> 02:14:17.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean it depends on what the fuck you're doing.</v>

4913
02:14:17.130 --> 02:14:17.461
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4914
02:14:17.461 --> 02:14:19.950
<v Speaker 2>like what are you doing with the prostitute and you get this figured out.</v>

4915
02:14:19.950 --> 02:14:22.960
<v Speaker 2>You're still making a fire from your job and kind of big consequences.</v>

4916
02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:27.120
<v Speaker 2>Here's the point is in countries like Australia where they have legalized</v>

4917
02:14:27.121 --> 02:14:27.954
<v Speaker 2>prostitution,</v>

4918
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:29.880
<v Speaker 2>they're divorce rate is way lower.</v>

4919
02:14:29.900 --> 02:14:30.550
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

4920
02:14:30.550 --> 02:14:35.550
<v Speaker 2>They don't have like all this violent crime and prostitution need.</v>

4921
02:14:36.301 --> 02:14:37.134
<v Speaker 2>First of all the,</v>

4922
02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:38.670
<v Speaker 2>with the violent crime,</v>

4923
02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:40.230
<v Speaker 2>they don't need John's.</v>

4924
02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:40.980
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4925
02:14:40.980 --> 02:14:44.820
<v Speaker 2>They work in these places where they have security to get people tested.</v>

4926
02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:46.380
<v Speaker 2>When people walk through the door,</v>

4927
02:14:46.381 --> 02:14:46.981
<v Speaker 2>they know,</v>

4928
02:14:46.981 --> 02:14:48.390
<v Speaker 2>you know they take their id.</v>

4929
02:14:48.391 --> 02:14:49.320
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like the way to go.</v>

4930
02:14:49.730 --> 02:14:50.940
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do it regardless.</v>

4933
02:14:57.690 --> 02:15:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't it legal to fuck someone for money?</v>

4934
02:15:00.540 --> 02:15:01.373
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference?</v>

4935
02:15:01.380 --> 02:15:05.580
<v Speaker 2>If it's legal to give someone a massage for money,</v>

4936
02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:10.760
<v Speaker 2>why isn't it legal to stick to [inaudible] guys consensual and all free him free</v>

02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:19.920
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

4971
02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:20.071
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

02:16:20.071 --> 02:16:21.090
<v Speaker 2>it's just as ridiculous.</v>

4973
02:16:21.091 --> 02:16:22.320
<v Speaker 2>If there's 400 million,</v>

4974
02:16:22.620 --> 02:16:25.860
<v Speaker 2>it's just as ridiculous a grown adult telling another grown adult,</v>

4975
02:16:25.950 --> 02:16:27.720
<v Speaker 2>whether it's male or female,</v>

4976
02:16:27.810 --> 02:16:30.190
<v Speaker 2>what they can do or do that harms</v>

4977
02:16:30.190 --> 02:16:30.730
<v Speaker 4>no one.</v>

4978
02:16:30.730 --> 02:16:34.510
<v Speaker 4>The woman makes a decision whether for whatever reason decides she wants to have</v>

4979
02:16:34.511 --> 02:16:36.460
<v Speaker 4>sex with a man and she wants to get paid for it.</v>

4980
02:16:36.700 --> 02:16:37.990
<v Speaker 4>The man makes a decision.</v>

4981
02:16:38.110 --> 02:16:38.890
<v Speaker 4>He decides,</v>

4982
02:16:38.890 --> 02:16:40.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm tired of dealing with this bullshit.</v>

4983
02:16:40.301 --> 02:16:41.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't want a relationship.</v>

4984
02:16:41.441 --> 02:16:42.670
<v Speaker 4>I just want to pay for sex.</v>

4985
02:16:42.880 --> 02:16:43.713
<v Speaker 4>And these women,</v>

4986
02:16:43.780 --> 02:16:46.210
<v Speaker 4>they pretend that they liked me and they really don't.</v>

4987
02:16:46.211 --> 02:16:47.440
<v Speaker 4>So I'll just give them what they want.</v>

4988
02:16:47.441 --> 02:16:48.220
<v Speaker 4>Which is money,</v>

4989
02:16:48.220 --> 02:16:48.520
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4990
02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:51.100
<v Speaker 4>That for guys who are unattractive,</v>

4991
02:16:51.250 --> 02:16:53.920
<v Speaker 4>that is the only way bang hot shit.</v>

4992
02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:55.090
<v Speaker 4>It's easier to control.</v>

4993
02:16:55.230 --> 02:16:56.220
<v Speaker 4>And there's nothing wrong with that.</v>

4994
02:16:56.240 --> 02:16:57.280
<v Speaker 4>Have a personality.</v>

4995
02:16:57.340 --> 02:17:01.360
<v Speaker 4>It's easier to control people even that are married with kids than single dudes</v>

4996
02:17:01.361 --> 02:17:02.230
<v Speaker 4>banging prostitutes.</v>

4997
02:17:02.231 --> 02:17:03.370
<v Speaker 4>You can't control those dudes.</v>

4998
02:17:03.371 --> 02:17:03.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4999

02:17:04.271 --> 02:17:05.710
<v Speaker 4>So you've got to make that shit illegal.</v>

02:17:07.141 --> 02:17:07.690
<v Speaker 4>It's illegal.</v>

5004
02:17:07.690 --> 02:17:08.291
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

5005
02:17:08.291 --> 02:17:09.430
<v Speaker 4>It's a pure technical law.</v>

5006
02:17:09.610 --> 02:17:10.600
<v Speaker 4>It goes back to,</v>

<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

5011
02:17:13.901 --> 02:17:14.141
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5012
02:17:14.141 --> 02:17:16.840
<v Speaker 4>you don't want your daughter Toby man doing prostitution.</v>

5013
02:17:16.841 --> 02:17:18.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't want my daughter doing prostitution.</v>

5014
02:17:18.430 --> 02:17:23.140
<v Speaker 4>But the reality is people are going to have sex with people.</v>

5015
02:17:23.141 --> 02:17:26.500
<v Speaker 4>And one of the reasons why prostitution has a stigma attached to it is the</v>

5016
02:17:26.501 --> 02:17:27.640
<v Speaker 4>legality of it.</v>

5017
02:17:27.820 --> 02:17:29.440
<v Speaker 4>That's the one of the main reasons.</v>

5018
02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:32.440
<v Speaker 4>It's just we're all for it.</v>

5019
02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:34.320
<v Speaker 4>We're fucking weird with sex man.</v>

5020
02:17:34.330 --> 02:17:36.880
<v Speaker 4>Varying things always happened.</v>

5021
02:17:36.881 --> 02:17:37.960
<v Speaker 4>I think it goes back though,</v>

5022
02:17:37.961 --> 02:17:42.610
<v Speaker 4>I think it goes back to the kinds of diseases we didn't have cures for.</v>

5023
02:17:42.611 --> 02:17:45.610
<v Speaker 4>I think about antibiotics only been around for about 60 years,</v>

5024
02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:46.990
<v Speaker 4>maybe even less.</v>

5025
02:17:47.020 --> 02:17:47.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5026
02:17:47.580 --> 02:17:50.200
<v Speaker 4>when you got syphilis and gonorrhea and you got other diseases,</v>

5027
02:17:50.201 --> 02:17:51.970
<v Speaker 4>it was no joke.</v>

5028
02:17:52.150 --> 02:17:52.400
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>

5029
02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:53.051
<v Speaker 4>no one knew.</v>

5030
02:17:53.051 --> 02:17:54.760
<v Speaker 4>If you're a stigma,</v>

5031
02:17:54.761 --> 02:17:55.990
<v Speaker 4>there was a stigma too.</v>

5032
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.920
<v Speaker 4>Especially syphilis.</v>

5033
02:17:56.921 --> 02:17:57.754
<v Speaker 4>She went crazy.</v>

5034
02:17:58.030 --> 02:17:58.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5035
02:17:58.630 --> 02:17:59.381
<v Speaker 4>I mean you did.</v>

5036
02:17:59.381 --> 02:18:01.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean there was a stigma to sexual,</v>

5037
02:18:02.020 --> 02:18:02.853
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5038
02:18:03.940 --> 02:18:07.390
<v Speaker 4>liberal sexual activity because it was in many cases,</v>

5039
02:18:07.391 --> 02:18:11.830
<v Speaker 4>very unhealthy in the way these systems in like some kind of institution.</v>

5040
02:18:11.831 --> 02:18:12.011
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5041
02:18:12.011 --> 02:18:12.521
<v Speaker 4>that's what happened.</v>

5042
02:18:12.521 --> 02:18:13.354
<v Speaker 4>How could you do?</v>

5043
02:18:13.370 --> 02:18:15.160
<v Speaker 4>That's what happened at alcohol and people die.</v>

5044
02:18:15.190 --> 02:18:16.060
<v Speaker 4>What happened in Nietzsche,</v>

5045
02:18:16.061 --> 02:18:17.370
<v Speaker 4>Nietzsche would became simplitic.</v>

5046
02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:19.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean a lot of things,</v>

5047
02:18:19.350 --> 02:18:20.183
<v Speaker 4>modern days,</v>

5048
02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:21.820
<v Speaker 4>celebrities coming down with,</v>

5049
02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:23.530
<v Speaker 4>well now they hit you with antibiotics.</v>

5050
02:18:23.531 --> 02:18:25.060
<v Speaker 4>Penicillin actually clears it up right away.</v>

5051
02:18:25.061 --> 02:18:25.900
<v Speaker 4>You got a shot in your ass.</v>

5052
02:18:25.960 --> 02:18:27.340
<v Speaker 4>They can cure that shit quick.</v>

5053
02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:29.500
<v Speaker 4>But until penicillin came along,</v>

5054
02:18:29.690 --> 02:18:34.690
<v Speaker 4>syphilis was awful because what happened was you would get Soren from your deck.</v>

5055
02:18:35.710 --> 02:18:36.040
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5056
02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:36.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

5057
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:39.050
<v Speaker 4>So on the end of your deck and then you would go then,</v>

5058
02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:40.960
<v Speaker 4>then incubate for a long time,</v>

5059
02:18:40.961 --> 02:18:43.240
<v Speaker 4>like 10 years and then you would start to lose your fucking mind.</v>

5060
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:45.400
<v Speaker 4>There's no way can incubator for 10 fucking years.</v>

5061
02:18:45.730 --> 02:18:46.411
<v Speaker 4>There is a way in.</v>

5062
02:18:46.411 --> 02:18:47.244
<v Speaker 4>It did.</v>

5063
02:18:47.530 --> 02:18:48.363
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of,</v>

5064
02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:51.790
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot know about it could be in your body for a long time.</v>

5065
02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:52.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5066
02:18:52.510 --> 02:18:56.200
<v Speaker 4>That was the thing about HIV was that the incubation people see the incubation</v>

5067
02:18:56.201 --> 02:18:57.730
<v Speaker 4>period is what scared the fuck out of it.</v>

5068
02:18:57.731 --> 02:18:59.510
<v Speaker 4>What about that teaching is on HIV counts.</v>

5069
02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:01.900
<v Speaker 4>Really interesting because of the protease inhibitors and stuff.</v>

5070
02:19:01.901 --> 02:19:06.490
<v Speaker 4>It's had to mutate so many times that it actually has weakened itself that make</v>

5071
02:19:06.491 --> 02:19:07.540
<v Speaker 4>so many compromises.</v>

5072
02:19:07.810 --> 02:19:09.150
<v Speaker 4>You born at a time come it,</v>

5073
02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:09.460
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5074
02:19:09.460 --> 02:19:10.211
<v Speaker 4>No HIV,</v>

5075
02:19:10.211 --> 02:19:10.761
<v Speaker 4>you're straight.</v>

5076
02:19:10.761 --> 02:19:15.340
<v Speaker 4>You believe that Michael Jordan's the virus is actually weakened over time.</v>

5077
02:19:15.341 --> 02:19:18.880
<v Speaker 4>You have to listen to this radio lab podcast called patient zero.</v>

5078
02:19:18.881 --> 02:19:20.650
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking amazing.</v>

5079
02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:25.680
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing because they tracked HIV from the top.</v>

5080
02:19:25.930 --> 02:19:28.070
<v Speaker 4>They used to have this guy they thought was patient</v>

5081
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.640
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>

5082
02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:32.000
<v Speaker 2>He was a gay guy that was having sex with all these people and he knew that he</v>

5083
02:19:32.001 --> 02:19:37.001
<v Speaker 2>was infected with it was the early days of aids in America for like in the 1980s</v>

5084
02:19:37.580 --> 02:19:41.300
<v Speaker 2>and everybody thought this guy was patient zero and he was infecting all these</v>

5085
02:19:41.301 --> 02:19:41.810
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

5086
02:19:41.810 --> 02:19:44.090
<v Speaker 2>Then they found out they trace the lineage back.</v>

5087
02:19:44.091 --> 02:19:45.470
<v Speaker 2>I want to encourage everybody,</v>

5088
02:19:45.471 --> 02:19:48.020
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't listened to radio lab,</v>

5089
02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:50.750
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking amazing podcast.</v>

5090
02:19:50.751 --> 02:19:51.920
<v Speaker 2>It's so good.</v>

5091
02:19:52.040 --> 02:19:56.570
<v Speaker 2>It's so consistently good and really well produced and really well edited.</v>

5092
02:19:56.571 --> 02:19:57.440
<v Speaker 2>It's genius.</v>

5093
02:19:57.770 --> 02:19:59.060
<v Speaker 2>And they had this,</v>

5094
02:19:59.061 --> 02:19:59.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5095
02:19:59.570 --> 02:20:00.170
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

5096
02:20:00.170 --> 02:20:01.400
<v Speaker 2>these doctors,</v>

5097
02:20:01.490 --> 02:20:04.940
<v Speaker 2>the scientists that traced the lineage of the,</v>

5098
02:20:04.941 --> 02:20:05.330
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5099
02:20:05.330 --> 02:20:06.163
<v Speaker 2>the disease,</v>

5100
02:20:06.290 --> 02:20:09.900
<v Speaker 2>they brought it all the way back to the early 19 hundreds monkeys,</v>

5101
02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:11.233
<v Speaker 2>well the rig,</v>

5102
02:20:11.240 --> 02:20:11.581
<v Speaker 2>they will,</v>

5103
02:20:11.581 --> 02:20:11.721
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>

5104
02:20:11.721 --> 02:20:15.530
<v Speaker 2>they brought it all the way back to the early 19 hundreds in America and then</v>

5105
02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:17.320
<v Speaker 2>they brought it all the way back to uh,</v>

5106
02:20:17.450 --> 02:20:19.580
<v Speaker 2>even earlier than that in Africa.</v>

5107
02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:21.500
<v Speaker 2>It came from a hunter and the,</v>

5108
02:20:21.501 --> 02:20:25.820
<v Speaker 2>the number one theory is a cut hunter like a hunter because in Africa they kill</v>

5109
02:20:25.821 --> 02:20:26.631
<v Speaker 2>a lot of monkeys.</v>

5110
02:20:26.631 --> 02:20:27.770
<v Speaker 2>They eat them,</v>

5111
02:20:27.950 --> 02:20:28.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5112
02:20:28.161 --> 02:20:28.301
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

5113
02:20:28.301 --> 02:20:29.240
<v Speaker 2>they call it Bushmeat,</v>

5114
02:20:29.241 --> 02:20:34.241
<v Speaker 2>they'll kill monkeys and chimps and that someone killed a monkey or a chimp.</v>

5115
02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:35.570
<v Speaker 2>And that champ,</v>

5116
02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:36.830
<v Speaker 2>as they were cutting it,</v>

5117
02:20:36.831 --> 02:20:41.240
<v Speaker 2>they cut themselves and they got the blood in the cut and that chimp had killed</v>

5118
02:20:41.241 --> 02:20:45.740
<v Speaker 2>a neat and two different types of monkeys that had two different types of</v>

5119
02:20:45.741 --> 02:20:47.210
<v Speaker 2>infectious diseases.</v>

5120
02:20:47.270 --> 02:20:49.020
<v Speaker 2>So different types of virus,</v>

5121
02:20:49.630 --> 02:20:52.400
<v Speaker 2>two different types of immune if immunodeficiency,</v>

5122
02:20:52.401 --> 02:20:53.210
<v Speaker 2>diseases.</v>

5123
02:20:53.210 --> 02:20:58.210
<v Speaker 2>And those two mutated inside that chimps body and then got into a person and</v>

5124
02:20:58.311 --> 02:21:02.600
<v Speaker 2>then it became loud and know how hard that is to believe that they nailed that</v>

5125
02:21:02.601 --> 02:21:03.590
<v Speaker 2>shit down to subdue,</v>

5126
02:21:03.620 --> 02:21:04.770
<v Speaker 2>to go listen.</v>

5127
02:21:06.320 --> 02:21:07.760
<v Speaker 2>If you listen to the podcast,</v>

5128
02:21:07.761 --> 02:21:09.470
<v Speaker 2>they explain the lineage,</v>

5129
02:21:09.471 --> 02:21:11.420
<v Speaker 2>they explain how they did it is,</v>

5130
02:21:11.510 --> 02:21:12.520
<v Speaker 2>and it is fascinating.</v>

5131
02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:13.281
<v Speaker 2>Also isolated.</v>

5132
02:21:13.281 --> 02:21:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5133
02:21:13.680 --> 02:21:14.650
<v Speaker 4>Which I thought was fascinating.</v>

5134
02:21:14.651 --> 02:21:16.900
<v Speaker 4>Why didn't HIV,</v>

5135
02:21:16.901 --> 02:21:18.280
<v Speaker 4>why was it a disease,</v>

5136
02:21:18.281 --> 02:21:22.020
<v Speaker 4>a heterosexual disease in Africa and not an in among your northern Europeans and</v>

5137
02:21:22.030 --> 02:21:22.960
<v Speaker 4>Europeans in general?</v>

5138
02:21:23.140 --> 02:21:23.291
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5139
02:21:23.291 --> 02:21:23.981
<v Speaker 4>it didn't make any sense.</v>

5140
02:21:23.981 --> 02:21:26.620
<v Speaker 4>They kept thinking as our secondary infections and stuff and what they found was</v>

5141
02:21:26.621 --> 02:21:28.960
<v Speaker 4>that anybody of European lineage,</v>

5142
02:21:29.060 --> 02:21:29.651
<v Speaker 4>black plague,</v>

5143
02:21:29.651 --> 02:21:29.801
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5144
02:21:29.801 --> 02:21:30.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5145
02:21:30.430 --> 02:21:31.600
<v Speaker 4>If you survive the black played,</v>

5146
02:21:31.601 --> 02:21:35.440
<v Speaker 4>you had a mutation in your gene that made you resistance to the HIV virus,</v>

5147
02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:38.110
<v Speaker 4>which is wild and they've isolated that.</v>

5148
02:21:38.500 --> 02:21:43.270
<v Speaker 4>And so what's really wild is like I'm always encouraged people to read a book</v>

5149
02:21:43.271 --> 02:21:44.590
<v Speaker 4>called why evolution is true.</v>

5150
02:21:44.591 --> 02:21:49.591
<v Speaker 4>Evolution is true by Jerry Coyne and he's at an evolutionary biologist and a</v>

5151
02:21:50.230 --> 02:21:50.711
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

5152
02:21:50.711 --> 02:21:53.230
<v Speaker 4>When you really look at the science of how they isolate these things.</v>

5153
02:21:53.231 --> 02:21:57.880
<v Speaker 4>When they look at the genome and they look at like what they can read on a gene</v>

5154
02:21:58.060 --> 02:21:58.811
<v Speaker 4>like viruses,</v>

5155
02:21:58.811 --> 02:22:00.520
<v Speaker 4>that word that that were dormant,</v>

5156
02:22:00.670 --> 02:22:01.171
<v Speaker 4>that you,</v>

5157
02:22:01.171 --> 02:22:03.240
<v Speaker 4>you share the same kind of viruses that uh,</v>

5158
02:22:03.350 --> 02:22:03.700
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

5159
02:22:03.700 --> 02:22:04.720
<v Speaker 4>you're like ancestors,</v>

5160
02:22:04.721 --> 02:22:07.420
<v Speaker 4>your monkey ancestors did really fascinating stuff.</v>

5161
02:22:07.720 --> 02:22:09.850
<v Speaker 4>The overwhelming evidence,</v>

5162
02:22:10.060 --> 02:22:12.430
<v Speaker 4>like as we learn more about evolution,</v>

5163
02:22:12.431 --> 02:22:13.480
<v Speaker 4>it becomes more true,</v>

5164
02:22:13.481 --> 02:22:14.171
<v Speaker 4>not less true,</v>

5165
02:22:14.171 --> 02:22:15.340
<v Speaker 4>which is fascinating to me.</v>

5166
02:22:15.700 --> 02:22:16.071
<v Speaker 4>So there,</v>

5167
02:22:16.071 --> 02:22:18.640
<v Speaker 4>there are a lot of things when then evolution,</v>

5168
02:22:18.640 --> 02:22:21.370
<v Speaker 2>but the whole HIV thing,</v>

5169
02:22:21.400 --> 02:22:21.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5170
02:22:21.670 --> 02:22:24.270
<v Speaker 2>I listened to Duisburg and that guy,</v>

5171
02:22:24.271 --> 02:22:25.530
<v Speaker 2>rex is a good for him.</v>

5172
02:22:25.710 --> 02:22:26.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5173
02:22:26.460 --> 02:22:26.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5174
02:22:26.731 --> 02:22:27.370
<v Speaker 2>You know what man?</v>

5175
02:22:27.370 --> 02:22:27.890
<v Speaker 2>A lot of sense.</v>

5176
02:22:27.890 --> 02:22:28.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5177
02:22:28.110 --> 02:22:28.741
<v Speaker 2>But here's the problem.</v>

5178
02:22:28.741 --> 02:22:30.150
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense to biologist,</v>

5179
02:22:30.180 --> 02:22:31.120
<v Speaker 2>not a biologist.</v>

5180
02:22:31.420 --> 02:22:32.990
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't make sense to viral ologists.</v>

5181
02:22:33.210 --> 02:22:36.120
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't make sense to any of the researchers that have been working for</v>

5182
02:22:36.121 --> 02:22:36.954
<v Speaker 2>decades.</v>

5183
02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:38.250
<v Speaker 2>If it was a really,</v>

5184
02:22:38.251 --> 02:22:41.520
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was with you before I talked to Duisburg and then talk to other</v>

5185
02:22:41.521 --> 02:22:42.450
<v Speaker 2>scientists about it.</v>

5186
02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:47.840
<v Speaker 2>And if it was a real issue where they really couldn't understand the differences</v>

5187
02:22:47.911 --> 02:22:52.080
<v Speaker 2>between with Duesberg was saying and with other biologists are saying it would</v>

5188
02:22:52.081 --> 02:22:52.800
<v Speaker 2>make sense,</v>

5189
02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:53.421
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

5190
02:22:53.421 --> 02:22:54.061
<v Speaker 2>it's out there.</v>

5191
02:22:54.061 --> 02:22:56.550
<v Speaker 2>All the information's out there and it's hotly disputed.</v>

5192
02:22:56.551 --> 02:23:01.170
<v Speaker 2>Like Duesberg is wrong about so many different things about how viruses behave</v>

5193
02:23:01.171 --> 02:23:05.010
<v Speaker 2>and about HIV in general on a specialty man.</v>

5194
02:23:05.070 --> 02:23:05.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5195
02:23:05.491 --> 02:23:05.760
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

5196
02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:09.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty convinced that he made some pretty critical errors in the early days</v>

5197
02:23:09.361 --> 02:23:13.690
<v Speaker 2>of HIV and then stayed with that also testify with Maddie.</v>

5198
02:23:13.691 --> 02:23:13.861
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5199
02:23:13.861 --> 02:23:14.131
<v Speaker 2>Wrath.</v>

5200
02:23:14.131 --> 02:23:14.351
<v Speaker 2>Matty.</v>

5201
02:23:14.351 --> 02:23:19.110
<v Speaker 2>His wrath who was pushing his vitamins on South Africans and telling them not to</v>

5202
02:23:19.111 --> 02:23:20.360
<v Speaker 2>go with regular um,</v>

5203
02:23:20.460 --> 02:23:20.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5204
02:23:20.900 --> 02:23:22.710
<v Speaker 2>produce protocols and he said,</v>

5205
02:23:22.711 --> 02:23:25.860
<v Speaker 2>take my vitamins and that's how you'll cure your disease.</v>

5206
02:23:25.861 --> 02:23:30.861
<v Speaker 2>HIV and Duesberg was with him when he testified and you can see the people in</v>

5207
02:23:31.330 --> 02:23:31.540
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

5208
02:23:31.540 --> 02:23:34.030
<v Speaker 2>They were talking about the people that working on the ground with these things</v>

5209
02:23:34.031 --> 02:23:35.130
<v Speaker 2>and they were like shaking their head going,</v>

5210
02:23:35.140 --> 02:23:35.973
<v Speaker 2>this guy has an ego.</v>

5211
02:23:36.090 --> 02:23:37.020
<v Speaker 2>He just flew in.</v>

5212
02:23:37.021 --> 02:23:38.400
<v Speaker 2>He has no idea what we're dealing with.</v>

5213
02:23:38.490 --> 02:23:39.210
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't know.</v>

5214
02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:41.520
<v Speaker 2>He's just not see what we're dealing with on the ground.</v>

5215
02:23:41.700 --> 02:23:44.910
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't see the kind of the kind of disaster we're dealing with.</v>

5216
02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:49.860
<v Speaker 2>The health crisis disaster and watching people die and get sick and stuff and</v>

5217
02:23:49.861 --> 02:23:54.550
<v Speaker 2>this Guy Duesberg is coming in and testifying that that wells well of Duisburg</v>

5218
02:23:54.551 --> 02:23:55.384
<v Speaker 2>is wrong.</v>

5219
02:23:55.500 --> 02:23:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Then we basically stopped aids,</v>

5220
02:23:58.830 --> 02:24:01.370
<v Speaker 2>like aids was going to be a thing that affected in the nut.</v>

5221
02:24:01.400 --> 02:24:04.590
<v Speaker 2>If the in the 80s when you heard all the predictions one out,</v>

5222
02:24:04.591 --> 02:24:09.591
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people are hit dot four but they predicted one out of four people</v>

5223
02:24:09.781 --> 02:24:13.020
<v Speaker 2>between the ages of 18 and 35 something like that.</v>

5224
02:24:13.140 --> 02:24:13.973
<v Speaker 2>It was going to be,</v>

5225
02:24:14.100 --> 02:24:19.100
<v Speaker 2>it was going to be like the black plague and if Duesberg is wrong then man we'd</v>

5226
02:24:19.950 --> 02:24:20.783
<v Speaker 2>licked aids.</v>

5227
02:24:22.530 --> 02:24:23.370
<v Speaker 2>When you say that,</v>

5228
02:24:23.371 --> 02:24:24.300
<v Speaker 2>like people saying that,</v>

5229
02:24:24.510 --> 02:24:27.780
<v Speaker 2>you know who was saying that shit the media and you know the media,</v>

5230
02:24:27.781 --> 02:24:29.010
<v Speaker 2>if it bleeds it leads.</v>

5231
02:24:29.011 --> 02:24:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Anything that's controversial it everybody was going to die but everybody's</v>

5232
02:24:32.190 --> 02:24:33.570
<v Speaker 2>going to be talked to health like nationals.</v>

5233
02:24:33.850 --> 02:24:34.411
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people,</v>

5234
02:24:34.411 --> 02:24:34.771
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

5235
02:24:34.771 --> 02:24:38.050
<v Speaker 2>did die in Africa a lot and and a lot of people in this country.</v>

5236
02:24:38.051 --> 02:24:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what is killed?</v>

5237
02:24:39.330 --> 02:24:42.690
<v Speaker 2>Half of the people that have ever died ever wait,</v>

5238
02:24:43.860 --> 02:24:44.280
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

5239
02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:45.120
<v Speaker 2>malaria.</v>

5240
02:24:45.240 --> 02:24:46.110
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say I,</v>

5241
02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:49.500
<v Speaker 2>the malaria is a mother familiar by far.</v>

5242
02:24:49.501 --> 02:24:51.720
<v Speaker 2>It kills more than a million people year.</v>

5243
02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:53.490
<v Speaker 2>Malaria kills the shit out.</v>

5244
02:24:53.491 --> 02:24:54.030
<v Speaker 2>I everybody.</v>

5245
02:24:54.030 --> 02:24:56.160
<v Speaker 2>That's why Bill Gates was so instrumental in,</v>

5246
02:24:56.161 --> 02:24:56.670
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

5247
02:24:56.670 --> 02:24:58.080
<v Speaker 2>what you really need is mosquito nets.</v>

5248
02:24:58.500 --> 02:24:58.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5249
02:24:58.980 --> 02:25:01.320
<v Speaker 2>I had a dude on my podcast that had fucking malaria.</v>

5250
02:25:01.321 --> 02:25:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it.</v>

5251
02:25:01.770 --> 02:25:03.060
<v Speaker 2>I've seen malaria with my own eyes.</v>

5252
02:25:03.090 --> 02:25:04.470
<v Speaker 2>I've seen somebody suffer from that.</v>

5253
02:25:04.500 --> 02:25:05.490
<v Speaker 2>Malaria is terrifying.</v>

5254
02:25:05.530 --> 02:25:05.971
<v Speaker 2>I was a kid.</v>

5255
02:25:05.971 --> 02:25:07.020
<v Speaker 2>I went from the mosquitoes.</v>

5256
02:25:08.610 --> 02:25:10.370
<v Speaker 2>You shake your so called Ooh,</v>

5257
02:25:10.650 --> 02:25:12.480
<v Speaker 2>and you could fucking die easy.</v>

5258
02:25:12.481 --> 02:25:15.990
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people die from a good percentage of the people that get malaria.</v>

5259
02:25:15.991 --> 02:25:16.230
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

5260
02:25:16.230 --> 02:25:17.460
<v Speaker 2>Ebola is another one.</v>

5261
02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Both fucking terrifying.</v>

5262
02:25:19.890 --> 02:25:23.040
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about this Ebola shit that's been going on in the last couple</v>

5263
02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:23.050
<v Speaker 2>of months?</v>

5264
02:25:23.050 --> 02:25:23.860
<v Speaker 2>Pretty contagious.</v>

5265
02:25:23.860 --> 02:25:24.010
<v Speaker 2>You</v>

5266
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:24.401
<v Speaker 4>know what,</v>

5267
02:25:24.401 --> 02:25:24.710
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

5268
02:25:24.710 --> 02:25:26.200
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of shit that's going on.</v>

5269
02:25:26.290 --> 02:25:27.123
<v Speaker 4>It's not hype.</v>

5270
02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:27.470
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

5271
02:25:27.470 --> 02:25:28.151
<v Speaker 4>it's real.</v>

5272
02:25:28.151 --> 02:25:29.290
<v Speaker 4>It's contagious as fuck.</v>

5273
02:25:29.291 --> 02:25:30.880
<v Speaker 4>Cause AIDS workers are getting it.</v>

5274
02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:33.630
<v Speaker 4>People that are giving people that are medical people,</v>

5275
02:25:33.940 --> 02:25:34.660
<v Speaker 4>aid workers,</v>

5276
02:25:34.660 --> 02:25:36.970
<v Speaker 4>people that are medical professionals are getting it.</v>

5277
02:25:37.300 --> 02:25:37.931
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

5278
02:25:37.931 --> 02:25:38.171
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

5279
02:25:38.171 --> 02:25:40.720
<v Speaker 4>they're dealing with situations that we're trying to help people.</v>

5280
02:25:40.721 --> 02:25:44.230
<v Speaker 4>And you're around people all the time because they figured out a way to close it</v>

5281
02:25:44.231 --> 02:25:45.160
<v Speaker 4>off in the United States.</v>

5282
02:25:45.161 --> 02:25:46.780
<v Speaker 4>It's so very few cases</v>

5283
02:25:48.590 --> 02:25:49.780
<v Speaker 4>of dying for me.</v>

5284
02:25:49.781 --> 02:25:51.800
<v Speaker 4>Bolas so I mean the chances,</v>

5285
02:25:51.801 --> 02:25:54.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean other countries in other countries,</v>

5286
02:25:54.790 --> 02:25:55.630
<v Speaker 4>if you get it,</v>

5287
02:25:55.660 --> 02:25:57.070
<v Speaker 4>it's almost a death sentence.</v>

5288
02:25:57.090 --> 02:25:57.430
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5289
02:25:57.430 --> 02:26:01.750
<v Speaker 4>But in America it's about 40% 40% of the people that get American men,</v>

5290
02:26:01.810 --> 02:26:02.643
<v Speaker 4>it's very hot.</v>

5291
02:26:02.860 --> 02:26:04.030
<v Speaker 4>But 40% of the people,</v>

5292
02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:06.700
<v Speaker 4>the people that have all come over from Africa that had had it,</v>

5293
02:26:06.701 --> 02:26:07.450
<v Speaker 4>they're all fine.</v>

5294
02:26:07.450 --> 02:26:08.283
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5295
02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:10.210
<v Speaker 4>They all know they were talking about it.</v>

5296
02:26:10.211 --> 02:26:12.520
<v Speaker 4>They were trying to isolate why some people survive and others don't.</v>

5297
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:13.271
<v Speaker 4>They actually don't know.</v>

5298
02:26:13.271 --> 02:26:14.380
<v Speaker 4>They think it is genetic.</v>

5299
02:26:14.381 --> 02:26:17.290
<v Speaker 4>They think you had to have a genetic resistance to it.</v>

5300
02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:19.750
<v Speaker 4>Where because typically the overall,</v>

5301
02:26:19.751 --> 02:26:23.530
<v Speaker 4>if you look at the grants statistic 70 you got a 70% chance I believe of dying.</v>

5302
02:26:23.531 --> 02:26:24.460
<v Speaker 4>If you get Ebola.</v>

5303
02:26:24.670 --> 02:26:26.230
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the broad statistic,</v>

5304
02:26:26.620 --> 02:26:27.453
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>

5305
02:26:27.910 --> 02:26:30.440
<v Speaker 4>what are the odds that the Ebola thing all over the news?</v>

5306
02:26:30.460 --> 02:26:34.630
<v Speaker 4>It was a distraction from like let's say Syria is that that I don't think the</v>

5307
02:26:34.631 --> 02:26:37.450
<v Speaker 4>news can work that way because there's so many different independent outlets,</v>

5308
02:26:37.660 --> 02:26:40.720
<v Speaker 4>so many different independent in remember let people on the ground like the</v>

5309
02:26:40.721 --> 02:26:43.180
<v Speaker 4>doctors that are going there and making no money and just going there.</v>

5310
02:26:43.420 --> 02:26:45.190
<v Speaker 4>That's where we're getting a lot of our information.</v>

5311
02:26:45.460 --> 02:26:48.180
<v Speaker 4>We're also getting our information from mostly health workers aren't getting our</v>

5312
02:26:48.190 --> 02:26:53.190
<v Speaker 4>information from CNN and Fox News turned to get America to panic all the time.</v>

5313
02:26:53.640 --> 02:26:55.720
<v Speaker 4>There's a possibility that's all a distraction.</v>

5314
02:26:55.750 --> 02:26:59.920
<v Speaker 4>I think the media makes money by sewing fear I think.</v>

5315
02:26:59.960 --> 02:27:00.793
<v Speaker 4>I think the meaning.</v>

5316
02:27:01.580 --> 02:27:04.360
<v Speaker 4>You don't think the media is controlled by whoever's running everything.</v>

5317
02:27:04.570 --> 02:27:07.570
<v Speaker 4>You think that people that are running everything half don't.</v>

5318
02:27:07.900 --> 02:27:11.830
<v Speaker 4>I think think about control too complicated and there are too many other</v>

5319
02:27:11.831 --> 02:27:13.120
<v Speaker 4>interests for anybody to run everything.</v>

5320
02:27:13.121 --> 02:27:13.571
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

5321
02:27:13.571 --> 02:27:14.560
<v Speaker 4>take the administration,</v>

5322
02:27:14.590 --> 02:27:15.190
<v Speaker 4>take a pray,</v>

5323
02:27:15.190 --> 02:27:16.090
<v Speaker 4>take a presidency.</v>

5324
02:27:16.340 --> 02:27:17.950
<v Speaker 4>First thing any president always says what?</v>

5325
02:27:17.951 --> 02:27:18.430
<v Speaker 4>I had no car.</v>

5326
02:27:18.430 --> 02:27:19.091
<v Speaker 4>I had no control,</v>

5327
02:27:19.091 --> 02:27:19.511
<v Speaker 4>no power.</v>

5328
02:27:19.511 --> 02:27:22.420
<v Speaker 4>Why so many different people in his cabinet have different agendas.</v>

5329
02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:26.320
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's undermining everybody and so I think it's very difficult for any one</v>

5330
02:27:26.321 --> 02:27:28.750
<v Speaker 4>group to take total control and they usually get found out.</v>

5331
02:27:28.780 --> 02:27:30.750
<v Speaker 4>I just think the media usually eat out.</v>

5332
02:27:32.350 --> 02:27:33.140
<v Speaker 4>Typically.</v>

5333
02:27:33.140 --> 02:27:33.973
<v Speaker 4>What do you,</v>

5334
02:27:34.390 --> 02:27:35.223
<v Speaker 4>what do you think?</v>

5335
02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:37.560
<v Speaker 4>I think that you can't trust,</v>

5336
02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:39.191
<v Speaker 4>it's not a bad,</v>

5337
02:27:39.191 --> 02:27:40.990
<v Speaker 4>you see a CNN Fox,</v>

5338
02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:46.000
<v Speaker 4>I think everything that's coming through the major news that works all have an</v>

5339
02:27:46.001 --> 02:27:47.200
<v Speaker 4>agenda behind it.</v>

5340
02:27:47.290 --> 02:27:48.520
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's district,</v>

5341
02:27:48.730 --> 02:27:50.080
<v Speaker 4>because if I was running shit,</v>

5342
02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:51.010
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>

5343
02:27:51.010 --> 02:27:52.150
<v Speaker 4>if I was wearing this shit and they said,</v>

5344
02:27:52.151 --> 02:27:52.510
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

5345
02:27:52.510 --> 02:27:53.380
<v Speaker 4>what do you think we should do?</v>

5346
02:27:53.381 --> 02:27:53.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

5347
02:27:53.980 --> 02:27:54.410
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>

5348
02:27:54.410 --> 02:27:55.750
<v Speaker 4>Are you guys controlling the media?</v>

5349
02:27:55.810 --> 02:27:56.530
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

5350
02:27:56.530 --> 02:27:58.210
<v Speaker 4>if they say no,</v>

5351
02:27:58.211 --> 02:27:59.560
<v Speaker 4>we're not really controlling the media.</v>

5352
02:27:59.561 --> 02:28:00.460
<v Speaker 4>They do whatever they want.</v>

5353
02:28:00.790 --> 02:28:03.190
<v Speaker 4>I would say control the goddamn media.</v>

5354
02:28:03.191 --> 02:28:04.150
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck are you guys,</v>

5355
02:28:04.180 --> 02:28:05.700
<v Speaker 4>how would you control me to explain to me how,</v>

5356
02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:07.300
<v Speaker 4>how do you think you would control the media?</v>

5357
02:28:07.301 --> 02:28:08.134
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

5358
02:28:08.170 --> 02:28:09.460
<v Speaker 4>like the Ebola thing for example,</v>

5359
02:28:09.461 --> 02:28:09.671
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

5360
02:28:09.671 --> 02:28:13.600
<v Speaker 4>like when you have all those different people dying,</v>

5361
02:28:13.601 --> 02:28:14.410
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5362
02:28:14.410 --> 02:28:17.660
<v Speaker 4>And you have people getting more people dying than the Fluor you,</v>

5363
02:28:17.680 --> 02:28:17.831
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

5364
02:28:17.831 --> 02:28:17.901
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

5365
02:28:17.901 --> 02:28:18.071
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

5366
02:28:18.071 --> 02:28:18.281
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

5367
02:28:18.281 --> 02:28:18.431
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

5368
02:28:18.431 --> 02:28:19.264
<v Speaker 4>but Ebola same.</v>

5369
02:28:19.270 --> 02:28:20.090
<v Speaker 4>Devastating.</v>

5370
02:28:20.090 --> 02:28:20.890
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

5371
02:28:20.890 --> 02:28:21.723
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

5372
02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:24.440
<v Speaker 5>Because Evil Ebola is,</v>

5373
02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:28.160
<v Speaker 5>his heart is very difficult to cure and probably a uncurable.</v>

5374
02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:32.090
<v Speaker 5>And also because it's so devastating and it's so contagious and it,</v>

5375
02:28:32.091 --> 02:28:35.480
<v Speaker 5>and it spreads like wildfire because a lot of these people who were there were,</v>

5376
02:28:35.500 --> 02:28:37.340
<v Speaker 5>were when their loved ones was sick,</v>

5377
02:28:37.460 --> 02:28:40.690
<v Speaker 5>they would take care of their loved one and they would absorb the fluid.</v>

5378
02:28:40.691 --> 02:28:45.691
<v Speaker 5>And why isn't the news covering all the innocent women and children dying in</v>

5379
02:28:47.841 --> 02:28:51.290
<v Speaker 5>these Middle Eastern countries through US bombs?</v>

5380
02:28:51.350 --> 02:28:52.820
<v Speaker 5>Why are they not covering that?</v>

5381
02:28:53.150 --> 02:28:53.331
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5382
02:28:53.331 --> 02:28:54.560
<v Speaker 5>I think they are.</v>

5383
02:28:54.590 --> 02:28:55.090
<v Speaker 5>They're not.</v>

5384
02:28:55.090 --> 02:28:55.620
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

5385
02:28:55.620 --> 02:28:58.310
<v Speaker 5>I think that sometimes the news can be sanitized.</v>

5386
02:28:58.311 --> 02:28:59.144
<v Speaker 5>And I agree with you.</v>

5387
02:28:59.150 --> 02:29:00.710
<v Speaker 5>But what I'm saying is that I think,</v>

5388
02:29:00.711 --> 02:29:03.020
<v Speaker 5>and I agree that I think that how many people die,</v>

5389
02:29:04.020 --> 02:29:04.720
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5390
02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:05.450
<v Speaker 5>On the trust.</v>

5391
02:29:05.450 --> 02:29:06.590
<v Speaker 5>How many people died in Iraq?</v>

5392
02:29:07.100 --> 02:29:07.940
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

5393
02:29:07.941 --> 02:29:10.250
<v Speaker 5>But a lot over 1 million civilians.</v>

5394
02:29:10.340 --> 02:29:11.440
<v Speaker 5>Over 1 million civilians.</v>

5395
02:29:12.190 --> 02:29:13.120
<v Speaker 5>A lot of different,</v>

5396
02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:14.240
<v Speaker 5>I've heard a lot of 1 million.</v>

5397
02:29:14.241 --> 02:29:15.500
<v Speaker 5>How many people have died of Ebola?</v>

5398
02:29:16.100 --> 02:29:16.970
<v Speaker 5>Not many fucks.</v>

5399
02:29:16.971 --> 02:29:17.910
<v Speaker 5>Zach thousand</v>

5400
02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:22.850
<v Speaker 5>over 1 million civilians died in Iraq.</v>

5401
02:29:22.970 --> 02:29:25.580
<v Speaker 5>You don't hear you heard about that?</v>

5402
02:29:25.940 --> 02:29:26.870
<v Speaker 5>They're not covering that.</v>

5403
02:29:26.990 --> 02:29:27.620
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

5404
02:29:27.620 --> 02:29:29.000
<v Speaker 5>that's a holocaust right there.</v>

5405
02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:30.080
<v Speaker 5>Why aren't we,</v>

5406
02:29:30.540 --> 02:29:31.160
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5407
02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:32.900
<v Speaker 5>aiding the families,</v>

5408
02:29:33.260 --> 02:29:34.071
<v Speaker 5>families of these people?</v>

5409
02:29:34.071 --> 02:29:35.000
<v Speaker 5>Why aren't we talking about this?</v>

5410
02:29:35.001 --> 02:29:35.151
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

5411
02:29:35.151 --> 02:29:35.984
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about some.</v>

5412
02:29:36.140 --> 02:29:37.160
<v Speaker 5>So to me,</v>

5413
02:29:37.460 --> 02:29:38.060
<v Speaker 5>to me,</v>

5414
02:29:38.060 --> 02:29:39.350
<v Speaker 5>if I was running shit,</v>

5415
02:29:39.530 --> 02:29:42.470
<v Speaker 5>I would have the media on motherfucking lock.</v>

5416
02:29:42.500 --> 02:29:47.450
<v Speaker 5>I would have the movie industry on lock out out of the TB easy.</v>

5417
02:29:47.510 --> 02:29:52.510
<v Speaker 5>The CIA's been in checking scripts since the 50s to make sure that communism</v>

5418
02:29:54.770 --> 02:29:56.440
<v Speaker 5>doesn't infect,</v>

5419
02:29:56.550 --> 02:30:00.620
<v Speaker 5>Louise has no say and could never tell a studio.</v>

5420
02:30:02.510 --> 02:30:03.440
<v Speaker 5>That's ridiculous.</v>

5421
02:30:03.441 --> 02:30:04.274
<v Speaker 5>You don't know that.</v>

5422
02:30:04.540 --> 02:30:05.373
<v Speaker 5>You're not a what?</v>

5423

<v Speaker 2>When?</v>

5424
02:30:06.460 --> 02:30:09.670
<v Speaker 2>One of the things about wikileaks and one of the things about finding out more</v>

5425
02:30:09.671 --> 02:30:12.580
<v Speaker 2>about what kind of information the CIA,</v>

5426
02:30:12.910 --> 02:30:13.241
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5427
02:30:13.241 --> 02:30:15.910
<v Speaker 2>or what kind of a operations CIA has been involved with.</v>

5428
02:30:15.911 --> 02:30:18.850
<v Speaker 2>They've been involved with the influence of Hollywood movies forever.</v>

5429
02:30:18.910 --> 02:30:21.970
<v Speaker 5>Operation mockingbird operation mockingbird is a real</v>

5430
02:30:24.970 --> 02:30:25.301
<v Speaker 5>jerk.</v>

<v Speaker 5>A lot of these guys,</v>

5432
02:30:27.090 --> 02:30:27.923
<v Speaker 5>these guys,</v>

5436
02:30:33.741 --> 02:30:34.574
<v Speaker 2>Studios.</v>

5437
02:30:34.580 --> 02:30:35.360
<v Speaker 2>They also,</v>

5438
02:30:35.360 --> 02:30:37.510
<v Speaker 2>they want access to information.</v>

5439
02:30:37.511 --> 02:30:40.130
<v Speaker 2>It's going to allow them to make a very realistic film.</v>

5440
02:30:40.131 --> 02:30:42.470
<v Speaker 2>They want the government to be behind it.</v>

5441
02:30:42.471 --> 02:30:44.300
<v Speaker 2>So if you're doing a movie like on,</v>

5447
02:30:51.021 --> 02:30:53.900
<v Speaker 2>intelligence community got in trouble because it was so real.</v>

5448
02:30:54.230 --> 02:30:55.430
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of those things,</v>

02:31:05.630 --> 02:31:06.740
<v Speaker 5>it's not one guy.</v>

5458
02:31:06.770 --> 02:31:08.480
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about dozens of students,</v>

5459
02:31:09.250 --> 02:31:10.940
<v Speaker 5>parents and producers,</v>

<v Speaker 5>And it's,</v>

5476

5491
02:32:00.450 --> 02:32:01.110
<v Speaker 5>The CIA,</v>

02:34:51.650 --> 02:34:54.560
<v Speaker 5>what happens if someone is trying to kidnap the president,</v>

5591
02:34:54.561 --> 02:34:55.061
<v Speaker 5>his family?</v>

5594
02:35:00.821 --> 02:35:01.001
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

5595
02:35:01.001 --> 02:35:04.240
<v Speaker 5>so there is without a doubt some discussion.</v>

5596
02:35:04.241 --> 02:35:07.000
<v Speaker 5>I mean they've had some discussion of us had been laid bare,</v>

5597
02:35:07.001 --> 02:35:10.690
<v Speaker 5>haven't they in this past like look at how bad they look with this torture</v>

5599
02:35:11.500 --> 02:35:12.660
<v Speaker 5>from the intelligence committee.</v>

5600
02:35:12.680 --> 02:35:13.710
<v Speaker 5>I have a Mike big way.</v>

5601
02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:14.553
<v Speaker 5>What do you think of that?</v>

5602
02:35:15.220 --> 02:35:16.960
<v Speaker 5>Because the CIA was,</v>

5603
02:35:17.250 --> 02:35:20.800
<v Speaker 5>is is the one everyone blames?</v>

5604
02:35:20.830 --> 02:35:21.371
<v Speaker 5>It's okay.</v>

5605
02:35:21.371 --> 02:35:22.710
<v Speaker 5>The people above the theater,</v>

5606
02:35:22.711 --> 02:35:23.620
<v Speaker 5>they're like playing the Thea.</v>

5607
02:35:23.621 --> 02:35:24.454
<v Speaker 5>I looked at CIO,</v>

5608
02:35:24.730 --> 02:35:26.800
<v Speaker 5>so the CIO has different directors.</v>

5609
02:35:26.801 --> 02:35:27.790
<v Speaker 5>They keep rotating.</v>

5610
02:35:27.940 --> 02:35:29.470
<v Speaker 5>Nobody's accountable for anything.</v>

5611
02:35:29.560 --> 02:35:30.790
<v Speaker 5>It's just CIA,</v>

5612
02:35:30.940 --> 02:35:31.550
<v Speaker 5>the CIA's,</v>

5613
02:35:31.550 --> 02:35:31.961
<v Speaker 5>but you know what?</v>

5614
02:35:31.961 --> 02:35:36.961
<v Speaker 5>The Iran Contra Contra scandal with George Sr was the vice president was the</v>

5615
02:35:38.261 --> 02:35:39.490

<v Speaker 5>became vice president.</v>

5617
02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:45.130
<v Speaker 5>There was a assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan who is known as one of the</v>

5618
02:35:45.250 --> 02:35:46.031
<v Speaker 5>most oblivious,</v>

5619
02:35:46.031 --> 02:35:46.390
<v Speaker 5>dumb,</v>

5620
02:35:46.390 --> 02:35:47.260
<v Speaker 5>dumbest presidents.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Only second to George W and George singer becomes president.</v>

5622
02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:56.260
<v Speaker 5>The head of the the the CIA,</v>

5623
02:35:56.320 --> 02:35:59.770
<v Speaker 5>his father Prescott Bush started the CIA,</v>

<v Speaker 5>notes.</v>

5631
02:36:14.980 --> 02:36:15.840
<v Speaker 5>So it's the CIO.</v>

5632
02:36:15.850 --> 02:36:16.880
<v Speaker 5>You're saying it's not the CIA,</v>

5633
02:36:16.881 --> 02:36:17.530
<v Speaker 5>there's somebody.</v>

5634
02:36:17.530 --> 02:36:19.190
<v Speaker 5>The CIA is just this,</v>

5635
02:36:19.260 --> 02:36:20.320
<v Speaker 5>the whipping boy.</v>

5636
02:36:20.410 --> 02:36:23.710
<v Speaker 5>There's nobody accountable in this who's really running this shit.</v>

5637
02:36:23.711 --> 02:36:26.200
<v Speaker 5>Then who knows the people with all the money,</v>

5638
02:36:26.210 --> 02:36:27.610
<v Speaker 5>the Rockefellers,</v>

<v Speaker 5>JP Morgan on the international bankers,</v>

5640
02:36:29.890 --> 02:36:30.730
<v Speaker 5>but the CIS,</v>

5641
02:36:30.731 --> 02:36:31.420
<v Speaker 5>perfect.</v>

5642
02:36:31.420 --> 02:36:33.220
<v Speaker 5>The CIO has been busted many times.</v>

5643
02:36:33.460 --> 02:36:34.840
<v Speaker 5>The CIO has been busted,</v>

5644
02:36:34.841 --> 02:36:35.674

5646
02:36:38.470 --> 02:36:41.740
<v Speaker 5>The CIA is the biggest drug dealer in the United States.</v>

5647
02:36:41.770 --> 02:36:42.700
<v Speaker 5>How crazy is that?</v>

5648
02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:44.080
<v Speaker 5>That's not a conspiracy theory.</v>

5649
02:36:44.200 --> 02:36:49.200
<v Speaker 5>They brought over $5 billion a coke in the 80s feel Brazilian,</v>

5653
02:36:58.360 --> 02:36:59.260
<v Speaker 5>That's a distraction.</v>

5654
02:36:59.410 --> 02:36:59.861
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile,</v>

5655
02:36:59.861 --> 02:37:03.460
<v Speaker 5>the CIS bringing him coke by the military.</v>

5656
02:37:03.550 --> 02:37:04.870
<v Speaker 5>This is not conspiracy theory.</v>

5657
02:37:05.050 --> 02:37:06.220
<v Speaker 5>You don't see anything wrong with that.</v>

5658
02:37:06.790 --> 02:37:09.850
<v Speaker 5>Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan dare to keep kids off drugs.</v>

5659
02:37:10.060 --> 02:37:14.050
<v Speaker 5>Yet the vice president of bringing in all the drugs to MENA,</v>

5660
02:37:14.051 --> 02:37:14.884
<v Speaker 5>Arkansas,</v>

02:37:14.900 --> 02:37:17.420
<v Speaker 5>bill vice president is bringing in drugs.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I like.</v>

5663
02:37:18.970 --> 02:37:19.803
<v Speaker 5>He's</v>

5664
02:37:22.370 --> 02:37:23.203
<v Speaker 5>busted.</v>

5665
02:37:23.240 --> 02:37:24.690
<v Speaker 5>His legs are almost off.</v>

5666
02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:29.710
<v Speaker 5>George senior got busted all over north Iran Contra 1980</v>

5667
02:37:31.770 --> 02:37:33.230
<v Speaker 5>that was about Steven.</v>

5668
02:37:33.520 --> 02:37:34.353
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>

5669
02:37:34.460 --> 02:37:37.460
<v Speaker 5>that was about bringing drugs in selling arms.</v>

5670
02:37:37.850 --> 02:37:38.900
<v Speaker 5>Well busted.</v>

5671
02:37:39.020 --> 02:37:39.890
<v Speaker 5>It's a fact.</v>

5672
02:37:39.891 --> 02:37:40.970
<v Speaker 5>That wasn't the con.</v>

5673
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:43.760
<v Speaker 5>The Iran Contra scandal wasn't actually about drugs,</v>

5674
02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:49.630
<v Speaker 5>guns and drugs.</v>

5675
02:37:49.631 --> 02:37:50.464
<v Speaker 5>The drugs,</v>

5676
02:37:50.510 --> 02:37:51.650
<v Speaker 5>they got busted</v>

02:37:53.780 --> 02:37:54.380
<v Speaker 5>selling.</v>

5678
02:37:54.380 --> 02:37:56.540
<v Speaker 5>Real question is how far up does it go?</v>

5679
02:37:56.541 --> 02:37:59.120
<v Speaker 5>The guy who was getting the drugs to Rick Ross,</v>

5680
02:37:59.121 --> 02:38:01.870
<v Speaker 5>who was he actually being green liberal,</v>

5681
02:38:01.900 --> 02:38:05.660
<v Speaker 5>dropping off the gloves and Mena Arkansas bill officers.</v>

5682
02:38:05.690 --> 02:38:07.070
<v Speaker 5>Is it the head of the CIA?</v>

5683
02:38:07.071 --> 02:38:08.470
<v Speaker 5>That's where it gets you say,</v>

5684
02:38:08.510 --> 02:38:12.020
<v Speaker 5>why would the CIA do that for money?</v>

5685
02:38:12.200 --> 02:38:14.590
<v Speaker 5>They can make us about money finance,</v>

5686
02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:15.673
<v Speaker 5>the Iran Contra,</v>

5687
02:38:16.050 --> 02:38:16.883
<v Speaker 5>he hit in the haunt,</v>

5688
02:38:17.030 --> 02:38:17.660
<v Speaker 5>the CIA,</v>

02:38:17.660 --> 02:38:21.110
<v Speaker 5>the CIA had and getting all the money they want from us because they do</v>

5695
02:38:24.381 --> 02:38:25.214
<v Speaker 5>you know what their budget,</v>

5696
02:38:25.330 --> 02:38:27.430

<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

5702
02:38:36.490 --> 02:38:36.741
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

5703
02:38:36.741 --> 02:38:38.960
<v Speaker 5>so let's say they sell drugs and they get that money.</v>

5704
02:38:39.110 --> 02:38:39.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5705
02:38:39.710 --> 02:38:40.340
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

02:38:40.340 --> 02:38:41.650
<v Speaker 5>So they played hard.</v>

5707
02:38:41.660 --> 02:38:42.590
<v Speaker 5>They did it illegally.</v>

5708
02:38:42.591 --> 02:38:43.160
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

5709
02:38:43.160 --> 02:38:43.550
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>

5710
02:38:43.550 --> 02:38:44.030
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

5711
02:38:44.030 --> 02:38:45.180
<v Speaker 5>so now,</v>

5712
02:38:45.230 --> 02:38:45.920
<v Speaker 5>now hold on.</v>

5713
02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:46.401
<v Speaker 5>Who,</v>

02:38:46.401 --> 02:38:47.840
<v Speaker 5>what do they do with that cash?</v>

5715
02:38:48.680 --> 02:38:49.040
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5716
02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:49.873
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>

5717
02:38:50.210 --> 02:38:51.260
<v Speaker 5>We don't know what they do with it,</v>

5718
02:38:51.261 --> 02:38:51.921
<v Speaker 5>so fuck it.</v>

5719
02:38:51.921 --> 02:38:52.754
<v Speaker 5>It's not real.</v>

5720
02:38:53.240 --> 02:38:56.630
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying that the CIA is such a big bureaucracy,</v>

5721
02:38:56.660 --> 02:39:00.440
<v Speaker 5>so you need their tent and everything they do basically is under civilian</v>

5722
02:39:00.441 --> 02:39:00.981
<v Speaker 5>control.</v>

5723
02:39:00.981 --> 02:39:01.310
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5724
02:39:01.310 --> 02:39:02.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying technically.</v>

5725
02:39:02.980 --> 02:39:03.231
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5726
02:39:03.231 --> 02:39:03.460
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5727
02:39:03.460 --> 02:39:05.790
<v Speaker 5>So what's the word they get as many they get,</v>

5728
02:39:05.810 --> 02:39:06.560
<v Speaker 5>they get,</v>

5729
02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:06.821
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

5730
02:39:06.821 --> 02:39:08.950
<v Speaker 5>the Senate intelligence committee gives them any,</v>

5731
02:39:09.050 --> 02:39:12.140
<v Speaker 5>pretty much they went outside to check.</v>

5732
02:39:12.141 --> 02:39:13.080
<v Speaker 5>They have a lot of money.</v>

5733
02:39:13.081 --> 02:39:14.420
<v Speaker 5>That's not true.</v>

5734
02:39:14.450 --> 02:39:18.910
<v Speaker 5>They don't get all the money for through Congress that they get it all black ops</v>

5735
02:39:18.911 --> 02:39:19.250
<v Speaker 5>style.</v>

5736
02:39:19.250 --> 02:39:20.350
<v Speaker 5>They sell drugs,</v>

5737
02:39:20.351 --> 02:39:21.380
<v Speaker 5>sell arms.</v>

5738
02:39:21.470 --> 02:39:22.281
<v Speaker 5>That's what they do.</v>

5739
02:39:22.281 --> 02:39:24.020
<v Speaker 5>Have ovens that it's already,</v>

5740
02:39:24.021 --> 02:39:25.850
<v Speaker 5>it's an it's buff to just Google it.</v>

5741
02:39:25.851 --> 02:39:26.481
<v Speaker 5>Look it up.</v>

5742
02:39:26.481 --> 02:39:26.871
<v Speaker 5>Google,</v>

5743
02:39:26.871 --> 02:39:27.890
<v Speaker 5>Iran Contra.</v>

5744
02:39:27.980 --> 02:39:30.260
<v Speaker 5>They got busted and the crazy thing about that,</v>

5745
02:39:30.860 --> 02:39:35.860
<v Speaker 5>not only did George senior get busted doing it as a vice president,</v>

5746
02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:38.450
<v Speaker 5>but he became president.</v>

5747
02:39:38.510 --> 02:39:40.940
<v Speaker 5>He got Boston and then the dude,</v>

5748
02:39:41.130 --> 02:39:42.050
<v Speaker 5>he didn't get busted.</v>

5749
02:39:42.620 --> 02:39:43.580
<v Speaker 5>He got busted,</v>

5750
02:39:43.610 --> 02:39:45.140
<v Speaker 5>but nobody gets indicted.</v>

5751
02:39:45.170 --> 02:39:46.850
<v Speaker 5>Nobody is held accountable.</v>

5752
02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:47.240
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5753
02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:48.730
<v Speaker 5>all of the waste of time they put up</v>

5754
02:39:50.510 --> 02:39:51.500
<v Speaker 5>all over north.</v>

5755
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:52.670
<v Speaker 5>When you say busted,</v>

5756
02:39:52.700 --> 02:39:54.470
<v Speaker 5>like in what way was he busted?</v>

5757
02:39:54.500 --> 02:39:54.891
<v Speaker 5>Busted.</v>

5758
02:39:54.891 --> 02:39:55.701
<v Speaker 5>Everybody knows that,</v>

5759
02:39:55.701 --> 02:39:58.640
<v Speaker 5>looks into it and and doesn't trust the fucking government.</v>

5760
02:39:58.641 --> 02:39:58.881
<v Speaker 5>They go,</v>

5761
02:39:58.881 --> 02:40:00.110
<v Speaker 5>you fucking criminal.</v>

5762
02:40:00.200 --> 02:40:01.070
<v Speaker 5>He's a criminal.</v>

5763
02:40:01.820 --> 02:40:04.250
<v Speaker 5>There's a criminal or all the press and throw a criminal.</v>

5764
02:40:04.450 --> 02:40:06.380
<v Speaker 5>You can't be a president unless you're a criminal.</v>

5765
02:40:06.410 --> 02:40:07.220
<v Speaker 5>I understand that.</v>

5766
02:40:07.220 --> 02:40:08.600
<v Speaker 5>But when you say busted,</v>

5767
02:40:08.601 --> 02:40:13.601
<v Speaker 5>like what specifically points to the fact that George Bush was involved in</v>

5768
02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:14.993
<v Speaker 5>selling drugs?</v>

5769
02:40:15.570 --> 02:40:16.141
<v Speaker 5>He was,</v>

5770
02:40:16.141 --> 02:40:18.810
<v Speaker 5>his boss was George Sr.</v>

5771
02:40:18.870 --> 02:40:20.040
<v Speaker 5>He was the vice president.</v>

5772
02:40:20.041 --> 02:40:21.380
<v Speaker 5>Everything was wanting towards,</v>

5773
02:40:21.810 --> 02:40:24.240
<v Speaker 5>Oliver North has never said anything about drugs.</v>

5774
02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:28.110
<v Speaker 5>I'll never admitted that he was an art of selling drugs.</v>

5775
02:40:28.140 --> 02:40:28.973
<v Speaker 5>What do you think?</v>

5776
02:40:29.220 --> 02:40:29.851
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

5777
02:40:29.851 --> 02:40:31.410
<v Speaker 5>But the point is when you say busted,</v>

5778
02:40:31.411 --> 02:40:32.520
<v Speaker 5>like if you're going to point,</v>

5779
02:40:32.550 --> 02:40:34.710
<v Speaker 5>like if you were in a court of law and you said this,</v>

5780
02:40:34.711 --> 02:40:39.270
<v Speaker 5>you said that he was mentioned drugs and when they didn't go to jail for</v>

5781
02:40:39.271 --> 02:40:40.680
<v Speaker 5>murdering a Nicole,</v>

5782
02:40:40.681 --> 02:40:41.140
<v Speaker 5>but we,</v>

5783
02:40:41.140 --> 02:40:42.780
<v Speaker 5>we know he did it right.</v>

5784
02:40:42.900 --> 02:40:43.321
<v Speaker 5>Don't do,</v>

5785
02:40:43.321 --> 02:40:44.640
<v Speaker 5>do believe that he did or didn't.</v>

5786
02:40:44.730 --> 02:40:49.440
<v Speaker 5>Well this is a really distorted argument though because you know when you say</v>

5787
02:40:49.441 --> 02:40:54.120
<v Speaker 5>George Bush was busted for selling drugs or George Bush was busted for enabling</v>

5788
02:40:54.121 --> 02:40:57.030
<v Speaker 5>Oliver North to let drugs go through south central La,</v>

5789
02:40:57.720 --> 02:40:58.860
<v Speaker 5>I don't really think he was,</v>

5790
02:40:58.920 --> 02:40:59.510
<v Speaker 5>I mean it would,</v>

5791
02:40:59.510 --> 02:41:00.660
<v Speaker 5>did he have anything to do with it?</v>

5792
02:41:00.690 --> 02:41:05.610
<v Speaker 5>If the CIA had something to do with drugs and they use that money to fund the,</v>

5793
02:41:05.611 --> 02:41:06.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5794
02:41:06.050 --> 02:41:07.380
<v Speaker 5>theory conscious versus</v>

5795
02:41:10.650 --> 02:41:14.580
<v Speaker 5>using that money for our list hill on a boat they got caught.</v>

5796
02:41:14.581 --> 02:41:15.540
<v Speaker 5>Who want to believe that shit.</v>

5797
02:41:15.541 --> 02:41:18.240
<v Speaker 5>You can believe it then nobody,</v>

5798
02:41:18.300 --> 02:41:20.790
<v Speaker 5>nobody will ever be accountable for that shit.</v>

5799
02:41:20.820 --> 02:41:22.680
<v Speaker 5>No one gets thrown in prison for that.</v>

5800
02:41:22.681 --> 02:41:26.160
<v Speaker 5>Show me just note on the message board that we need to fight companion for this</v>

5801
02:41:26.161 --> 02:41:26.994
<v Speaker 5>fight companion.</v>

5802
02:41:28.670 --> 02:41:29.503
<v Speaker 5>No</v>

5803
02:41:31.890 --> 02:41:33.420
<v Speaker 5>gets accountable for shit.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I</v>

5864
02:43:12.010 --> 02:43:12.701
<v Speaker 4>don't believe in anything.</v>

5865
02:43:12.701 --> 02:43:13.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm just trying to smell question.</v>

5866
02:43:13.630 --> 02:43:16.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm just trying to appreciate it that you just love you.</v>

5867
02:43:16.210 --> 02:43:17.043
<v Speaker 4>I love you and you are.</v>

5868
02:43:17.290 --> 02:43:18.670
<v Speaker 4>But here's what I always,</v>

5869
02:43:18.740 --> 02:43:20.510
<v Speaker 4>when whenever you guys like and,</v>

5870
02:43:20.550 --> 02:43:20.961
<v Speaker 4>and you,</v>

5871
02:43:20.961 --> 02:43:21.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5872
02:43:21.220 --> 02:43:23.050
<v Speaker 4>you'll have a guy you're talking about who,</v>

5873
02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:25.840
<v Speaker 4>who admits all of these things and there's video on it that,</v>

5874
02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:28.090
<v Speaker 4>the only thing that I always go back to is this.</v>

5875
02:43:28.480 --> 02:43:30.700
<v Speaker 4>There are so many investigative journalists,</v>

5876
02:43:30.760 --> 02:43:33.130
<v Speaker 4>so many who are good people who are trying to find the truth.</v>

5877
02:43:33.131 --> 02:43:33.880
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people,</v>

5878
02:43:33.880 --> 02:43:35.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you look at the New York Times and economist,</v>

5879
02:43:35.800 --> 02:43:36.160
<v Speaker 4>let me just,</v>

5880
02:43:36.160 --> 02:43:37.810
<v Speaker 4>let me just listen to NPR,</v>

5881
02:43:37.870 --> 02:43:38.620
<v Speaker 4>New York Times,</v>

5882
02:43:38.620 --> 02:43:39.453
<v Speaker 4>The economist,</v>

5883
02:43:39.700 --> 02:43:40.361
<v Speaker 4>Wall Street Journal,</v>

5884
02:43:40.361 --> 02:43:41.380
<v Speaker 4>these people don't make a lot of money,</v>

5885
02:43:41.740 --> 02:43:43.210
<v Speaker 4>but they do go to countries.</v>

5886
02:43:43.211 --> 02:43:44.450
<v Speaker 4>They risked their own lives and they,</v>

5887
02:43:44.470 --> 02:43:47.650
<v Speaker 4>they are as concerned with the truth and exposing the truth as they,</v>

5888
02:43:48.130 --> 02:43:48.810
<v Speaker 4>as anybody.</v>

5889
02:43:48.810 --> 02:43:50.110
<v Speaker 4>A lot of going to amber Lyon.</v>

5890
02:43:50.170 --> 02:43:50.680
<v Speaker 4>But hold on,</v>

5891
02:43:50.680 --> 02:43:51.031
<v Speaker 4>hold on,</v>

5892
02:43:51.031 --> 02:43:51.630
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

5893
02:43:51.630 --> 02:43:52.000
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

5894
02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:57.000
<v Speaker 4>and what happens the way the way an editorial board works is when you go and you</v>

5895
02:43:57.521 --> 02:43:57.701
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

5896
02:43:57.701 --> 02:43:58.540
<v Speaker 4>here's my story.</v>

5897
02:43:58.541 --> 02:44:00.850
<v Speaker 4>The first thing your editor says in a credible newspaper,</v>

5898
02:44:00.851 --> 02:44:02.620
<v Speaker 4>like the economist is the oldest magazine.</v>

5899
02:44:02.621 --> 02:44:03.454
<v Speaker 4>How do you know this?</v>

5900
02:44:03.760 --> 02:44:04.750
<v Speaker 4>How do you know what's the first night?</v>

5901
02:44:04.751 --> 02:44:04.960
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

5902
02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:07.430
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of journalists I've interviewed and I've interviewed,</v>

5903
02:44:07.450 --> 02:44:09.320
<v Speaker 4>the first thing we say is what the first thing they say,</v>

5904
02:44:10.350 --> 02:44:11.470
<v Speaker 4>let them finish man.</v>

5905
02:44:11.500 --> 02:44:16.330
<v Speaker 4>And the first thing they say is what you need at least I believe it's three</v>

5906
02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:20.740
<v Speaker 4>credible sources that we can check up on before we can run a newspaper,</v>

5907
02:44:20.810 --> 02:44:21.070
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5908
02:44:21.070 --> 02:44:21.341
<v Speaker 4>Max.</v>

5909
02:44:21.341 --> 02:44:22.750
<v Speaker 4>And they're very careful about that.</v>

5910
02:44:22.751 --> 02:44:23.340
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

5911
02:44:23.340 --> 02:44:23.860
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

5912
02:44:23.860 --> 02:44:27.790
<v Speaker 4>so when you have that much information and you have the mainstream media,</v>

5913
02:44:28.180 --> 02:44:30.490
<v Speaker 4>which is the economist that NPR that makes no money,</v>

5914
02:44:30.540 --> 02:44:35.540
<v Speaker 4>they rely on public funding and stuff when everybody is essentially sharing the</v>

5915
02:44:35.681 --> 02:44:37.870
<v Speaker 4>same story and checking these things out.</v>

5916
02:44:37.870 --> 02:44:39.220
<v Speaker 4>These guys are so credible.</v>

5917
02:44:39.670 --> 02:44:40.361
<v Speaker 4>But they are,</v>

5918
02:44:40.361 --> 02:44:41.194
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5919
02:44:41.660 --> 02:44:45.840
<v Speaker 4>so you were saying that these journalists that are risking their lives are,</v>

5920
02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:48.970
<v Speaker 4>are lying and you're one guy is the one who has the truth.</v>

5921
02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:50.830
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're talking about.</v>

5922
02:44:50.831 --> 02:44:51.680
<v Speaker 4>Some black and white.</v>

5923
02:44:52.180 --> 02:44:52.840
<v Speaker 4>This one,</v>

5924
02:44:52.840 --> 02:44:53.571
<v Speaker 4>I said that there's,</v>

5925
02:44:53.571 --> 02:44:55.540
<v Speaker 4>there's one guy who has all the truth.</v>

5926
02:44:55.541 --> 02:44:57.310
<v Speaker 4>I said that this one guy will do,</v>

5927
02:44:57.460 --> 02:45:00.100
<v Speaker 4>and these journalists that you'll know so well aren't full of shit.</v>

5928
02:45:01.120 --> 02:45:01.960
<v Speaker 4>I believe you that you,</v>

5929
02:45:01.961 --> 02:45:03.970
<v Speaker 4>all these journals that you know aren't full of Shit.</v>

5930
02:45:04.180 --> 02:45:06.850
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about what journalists with the,</v>

5931
02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:07.713
<v Speaker 4>with the,</v>

5932
02:45:08.230 --> 02:45:11.800
<v Speaker 4>with the CNN ask them is give me three credible sources.</v>

5933
02:45:12.070 --> 02:45:13.600
<v Speaker 4>You don't know that yet.</v>

5934
02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:15.430
<v Speaker 4>How do you know that CNN,</v>

5935
02:45:15.550 --> 02:45:19.040
<v Speaker 4>he's talking about the times you want to,</v>

5936
02:45:19.160 --> 02:45:23.440
<v Speaker 4>but what really I think the reality is that uh,</v>

5937
02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:26.680
<v Speaker 4>the major networks are full of shit.</v>

5938
02:45:27.310 --> 02:45:32.290
<v Speaker 4>The government at the high levels is solely corrupt and you could just follow</v>

5939
02:45:32.291 --> 02:45:35.590
<v Speaker 4>the money and find out how corrupt everyone is.</v>

5940
02:45:35.740 --> 02:45:40.180
<v Speaker 4>And the people at the top and politics are not waking up thinking about what can</v>

5941
02:45:40.181 --> 02:45:41.350
<v Speaker 4>I do for the people.</v>

5942
02:45:41.530 --> 02:45:42.610
<v Speaker 4>They're not thinking about that shit.</v>

5943
02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:46.300
<v Speaker 4>They're thinking about how I keep my power and how I make money.</v>

5944
02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:47.470
<v Speaker 4>That's my guests.</v>

5945
02:45:47.530 --> 02:45:49.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe any of those mother fuckers.</v>

5946
02:45:49.151 --> 02:45:51.670
<v Speaker 4>So you don't think anybody is in the news?</v>

5947
02:45:51.671 --> 02:45:52.451
<v Speaker 4>I didn't say anybody.</v>

5948
02:45:52.451 --> 02:45:53.020
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

5949
02:45:53.020 --> 02:45:57.580
<v Speaker 4>But you don't think the majority of journalists have have the interest of the</v>

5950
02:45:57.581 --> 02:45:58.540
<v Speaker 4>truth in mind?</v>

5951
02:45:58.541 --> 02:46:00.250
<v Speaker 4>You think I'm being paid by somebody else.</v>

5952
02:46:00.300 --> 02:46:00.700
<v Speaker 4>Phone.</v>

5953
02:46:00.700 --> 02:46:01.960
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever read the New York Times?</v>

5954
02:46:01.961 --> 02:46:04.080
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever read the New York Times or the economist or,</v>

5955
02:46:04.081 --> 02:46:05.080
<v Speaker 4>or do you listen to NPR?</v>

5956
02:46:05.081 --> 02:46:05.741
<v Speaker 4>Do you listen to,</v>

5957
02:46:05.741 --> 02:46:06.730
<v Speaker 4>do you read in The Wall Street Journal?</v>

5958
02:46:06.731 --> 02:46:09.010
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever I watch CNN.</v>

5959
02:46:10.210 --> 02:46:12.280
<v Speaker 3>Do you read those identifications?</v>

5960
02:46:12.350 --> 02:46:13.183
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

5961
02:46:13.190 --> 02:46:18.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't watch CNN on a regular basis because I feel that I'm getting fed an</v>

5962
02:46:18.891 --> 02:46:19.480
<v Speaker 3>agenda.</v>

5963
02:46:19.480 --> 02:46:19.880
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5964
02:46:19.880 --> 02:46:21.230
<v Speaker 3>Every now and then I'll watch it.</v>

5965
02:46:21.320 --> 02:46:23.180
<v Speaker 3>Why would I re read the New York Times?</v>

5966
02:46:23.430 --> 02:46:26.390
<v Speaker 3>I think that the people at the top have all that shit on lock.</v>

5967
02:46:26.450 --> 02:46:27.830
<v Speaker 3>So why would I waste my time?</v>

5968
02:46:27.950 --> 02:46:32.630
<v Speaker 3>The only time I do read New York Times or watch the CNN report,</v>

5969
02:46:32.780 --> 02:46:33.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm always watching and going,</v>

5970
02:46:34.100 --> 02:46:35.300
<v Speaker 3>what are these motherfuckers,</v>

5971
02:46:35.301 --> 02:46:40.070
<v Speaker 3>what is their agenda and how are they trying to steer the public into a certain</v>

5972
02:46:40.071 --> 02:46:40.670
<v Speaker 3>opinion?</v>

5973
02:46:40.670 --> 02:46:41.503
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe,</v>

5974
02:46:41.630 --> 02:46:43.160
<v Speaker 3>I think they're all fucking corrupt.</v>

5975
02:46:43.310 --> 02:46:46.990
<v Speaker 3>I think they're all full of shit and it's been like that for 35 40</v>

5976
02:46:47.700 --> 02:46:48.151
<v Speaker 4>at all.</v>

5977
02:46:48.151 --> 02:46:49.050
<v Speaker 4>And I think you're,</v>

5978
02:46:49.230 --> 02:46:53.340
<v Speaker 4>I think that's very arrogant to conciliate think that you somehow have the truth</v>

5979
02:46:53.341 --> 02:46:54.330
<v Speaker 4>and all these people,</v>

5980
02:46:54.380 --> 02:46:54.470
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

5981
02:46:54.470 --> 02:46:55.303
<v Speaker 7>I never</v>

5982
02:46:56.430 --> 02:46:58.220
<v Speaker 7>have the truth and shakers.</v>

5983
02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:03.020
<v Speaker 7>Are you using like mechanisms to fuel your argument instead of it's fun.</v>

5984
02:47:03.450 --> 02:47:04.920
<v Speaker 7>I'm not using anything.</v>

5985
02:47:04.921 --> 02:47:05.754
<v Speaker 7>I'm not sure.</v>

5986
02:47:06.010 --> 02:47:06.960
<v Speaker 7>I'm just saying you will.</v>

5987
02:47:06.961 --> 02:47:07.910
<v Speaker 7>You just did his,</v>

5988
02:47:07.930 --> 02:47:12.330
<v Speaker 7>his death because he never said that you have all the truth that when people,</v>

5989
02:47:12.331 --> 02:47:13.164
<v Speaker 7>I love people.</v>

5990
02:47:14.990 --> 02:47:16.380
<v Speaker 7>You're saying all these journalists,</v>

5991
02:47:17.010 --> 02:47:21.600
<v Speaker 7>Howard Hunt's deathbed confession and we were talking about the CIA's admitted</v>

5992
02:47:21.601 --> 02:47:22.860
<v Speaker 7>role in Hollywood.</v>

5993
02:47:23.070 --> 02:47:25.980
<v Speaker 7>You tend to like not want to buy into any of that stuff.</v>

5994
02:47:26.040 --> 02:47:27.540
<v Speaker 7>I tend to be the middle ground,</v>

5995
02:47:27.541 --> 02:47:27.840
<v Speaker 7>so we,</v>

5996
02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:30.000
<v Speaker 7>what we have is the mama bear,</v>

5997
02:47:30.001 --> 02:47:30.541
<v Speaker 7>papa bear,</v>

5998
02:47:30.541 --> 02:47:31.374
<v Speaker 7>baby bear.</v>

5999
02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:34.950
<v Speaker 7>I'm the middle there</v>

6000
02:47:35.230 --> 02:47:40.230
<v Speaker 3>because my podcast host is you times 10 he will not,</v>

6001
02:47:40.990 --> 02:47:43.030
<v Speaker 3>he think he was day.</v>

6002
02:47:43.100 --> 02:47:44.180
<v Speaker 3>He'll say stuff like that.</v>

6003
02:47:44.181 --> 02:47:45.330
<v Speaker 3>He will say stuff like,</v>

6004
02:47:46.170 --> 02:47:46.801
<v Speaker 3>trust me,</v>

6005
02:47:46.801 --> 02:47:48.420
<v Speaker 3>I know the government's full of shit.</v>

6006
02:47:48.720 --> 02:47:49.161
<v Speaker 3>I know that.</v>

6007
02:47:49.161 --> 02:47:50.250
<v Speaker 3>It's always been that way.</v>

6008
02:47:50.580 --> 02:47:51.510
<v Speaker 3>I know that,</v>

6009
02:47:51.680 --> 02:47:52.860
<v Speaker 3>that they're fucking us.</v>

6010
02:47:52.890 --> 02:47:53.670
<v Speaker 3>I know that.</v>

6011
02:47:53.670 --> 02:47:57.930
<v Speaker 3>But he says that and then he believes no conspiracy,</v>

6012
02:47:57.960 --> 02:47:59.250
<v Speaker 3>government conspiracy theories.</v>

6013
02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:00.233
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of weird.</v>

6014
02:48:00.300 --> 02:48:02.580
<v Speaker 3>So it's way more over the top.</v>

6015
02:48:02.630 --> 02:48:02.941
<v Speaker 7>The new,</v>

6016
02:48:02.941 --> 02:48:04.400
<v Speaker 7>I think for me the fun</v>

6017
02:48:05.990 --> 02:48:06.980
<v Speaker 7>is Brian reads.</v>

6018
02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:08.000
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

6019
02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:08.800
<v Speaker 7>And you know what,</v>

6020
02:48:08.800 --> 02:48:09.650
<v Speaker 7>Zach reads a lot</v>

6021
02:48:11.710 --> 02:48:13.550
<v Speaker 7>to educate yourself.</v>

6022
02:48:13.551 --> 02:48:13.840
<v Speaker 7>Grind.</v>

6023
02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:15.260
<v Speaker 7>Zach reads a lot of books too.</v>

6024
02:48:15.261 --> 02:48:15.610
<v Speaker 7>Dude.</v>

6025
02:48:15.610 --> 02:48:16.443
<v Speaker 7>Zach,</v>

6026
02:48:17.150 --> 02:48:19.400
<v Speaker 7>the problems that might be the problem,</v>

6027
02:48:20.350 --> 02:48:20.720
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6028
02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:23.030
<v Speaker 4>That I think is that sometimes when we,</v>

6029
02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:24.080
<v Speaker 4>and we all do this,</v>

6030
02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:25.340
<v Speaker 4>when we,</v>

6031
02:48:25.340 --> 02:48:26.173
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

6032
02:48:26.210 --> 02:48:27.980
<v Speaker 4>we decide that this is the enemy,</v>

6033
02:48:28.250 --> 02:48:28.580
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6034
02:48:28.580 --> 02:48:29.091
<v Speaker 4>When we go,</v>

6035
02:48:29.091 --> 02:48:29.330
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

6036
02:48:29.330 --> 02:48:29.931
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

6037
02:48:29.931 --> 02:48:30.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe any of this.</v>

6038
02:48:30.921 --> 02:48:31.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to read any of this.</v>

6039
02:48:31.911 --> 02:48:32.744
<v Speaker 4>And I think they're all,</v>

6040
02:48:32.780 --> 02:48:33.171
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6041
02:48:33.171 --> 02:48:33.261
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

6042
02:48:33.261 --> 02:48:34.140
<v Speaker 4>most of them are,</v>

6043
02:48:34.141 --> 02:48:35.240
<v Speaker 4>are not trustworthy.</v>

6044
02:48:35.870 --> 02:48:39.740
<v Speaker 4>I think that you do several of the surface in some ways because I think the real</v>

6045
02:48:39.741 --> 02:48:40.280
<v Speaker 4>enemy is,</v>

6046
02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:43.670
<v Speaker 4>is a lot less insidious and a lot less glamorous.</v>

6047
02:48:43.880 --> 02:48:45.410
<v Speaker 4>And I think the real enemy for example,</v>

6048
02:48:45.411 --> 02:48:45.831
<v Speaker 4>is like,</v>

6049
02:48:45.831 --> 02:48:47.540
<v Speaker 4>let's just take campaign finance reform.</v>

6050
02:48:47.820 --> 02:48:48.150
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

6051
02:48:48.150 --> 02:48:52.160
<v Speaker 4>which is probably the most important thing to talk about the money in politics</v>

6052
02:48:52.310 --> 02:48:56.810
<v Speaker 4>and the way basically somebody in Congress has to spend 40 to 60% of his time</v>

6053
02:48:56.811 --> 02:48:59.660
<v Speaker 4>calling people he doesn't know just to get enough money to get reelected.</v>

6054
02:49:00.050 --> 02:49:01.250
<v Speaker 4>Now you got a problem.</v>

6055
02:49:01.280 --> 02:49:02.031
<v Speaker 4>Or for example,</v>

6056
02:49:02.031 --> 02:49:02.990
<v Speaker 4>here's a huge enemy</v>

6057
02:49:04.020 --> 02:49:05.090
<v Speaker 7>disagreeing with that at all.</v>

6058
02:49:06.450 --> 02:49:06.691
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

6059
02:49:06.691 --> 02:49:07.524
<v Speaker 7>And so in thousand</v>

6060
02:49:08.100 --> 02:49:08.933
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

6061
02:49:09.470 --> 02:49:09.810
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

6062
02:49:09.810 --> 02:49:11.430
<v Speaker 4>leafs in 2010 for example,</v>

6063
02:49:11.431 --> 02:49:13.980
<v Speaker 4>this is fascinating that we had some real problems in this country,</v>

6064
02:49:13.981 --> 02:49:16.860
<v Speaker 4>some real challenges and the thing that they were arguing about on the floor and</v>

6065
02:49:16.861 --> 02:49:21.240
<v Speaker 4>congress was swipe swipe fees for a tms swipe fees.</v>

6066
02:49:21.450 --> 02:49:22.110
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

6067
02:49:22.110 --> 02:49:23.730
<v Speaker 4>Because you had corporate behemoths,</v>

6068
02:49:23.820 --> 02:49:27.810
<v Speaker 4>they were arguing about their bottom line and influencing congress because they</v>

6069
02:49:27.811 --> 02:49:31.920
<v Speaker 4>wanted to make more money and they didn't give a shit about the real issues that</v>

6070
02:49:31.921 --> 02:49:32.461
<v Speaker 4>faced you.</v>

6071
02:49:32.461 --> 02:49:33.780
<v Speaker 4>Me and the average person,</v>

6072
02:49:33.781 --> 02:49:35.150
<v Speaker 4>I guess what I'm talking about,</v>

6073
02:49:35.160 --> 02:49:36.480
<v Speaker 4>I've totally believe right and,</v>

6074
02:49:36.481 --> 02:49:36.821
<v Speaker 4>and but,</v>

6075
02:49:36.821 --> 02:49:38.370
<v Speaker 4>but remember now that was very,</v>

6076
02:49:38.371 --> 02:49:42.270
<v Speaker 4>very much dilated and really exposed by some of the mainstream media is like</v>

6077
02:49:42.271 --> 02:49:43.340
<v Speaker 4>look for New York Times,</v>

6078
02:49:43.341 --> 02:49:44.550
<v Speaker 4>said some great stuff on that.</v>

6079
02:49:44.670 --> 02:49:49.620
<v Speaker 4>Lawrence Lessig who's a Harvard lawyer and wrote a great book called Republic</v>

6080
02:49:49.621 --> 02:49:50.100
<v Speaker 4>loss.</v>

6081
02:49:50.100 --> 02:49:53.640
<v Speaker 4>So there's really great information out there and if you know where to look,</v>

6082
02:49:53.850 --> 02:49:57.180
<v Speaker 4>I think that a lot of people in earnest and a lot of great journalists do a</v>

6083
02:49:57.181 --> 02:49:59.970
<v Speaker 4>great job trying to expose what the real enemy is.</v>

6084
02:49:59.970 --> 02:50:03.240
<v Speaker 4>And I'm always fascinated with the fact that it's not even so much the CIA.</v>

6085
02:50:03.241 --> 02:50:05.370
<v Speaker 4>I though I'll say they come out looking terrible in this,</v>

6086
02:50:05.371 --> 02:50:06.030
<v Speaker 4>what they did.</v>

6087
02:50:06.030 --> 02:50:07.830
<v Speaker 4>You know that he's 39 detainees and stuff,</v>

6088
02:50:07.831 --> 02:50:09.480
<v Speaker 4>but how many people were involved?</v>

6089
02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:10.633
<v Speaker 4>That's what I want to know.</v>

6090
02:50:10.650 --> 02:50:11.401
<v Speaker 4>We don't want to know,</v>

6091
02:50:11.401 --> 02:50:12.001
<v Speaker 4>like when you,</v>

6092
02:50:12.001 --> 02:50:14.880
<v Speaker 4>when you leave someone alone with detainees,</v>

6093
02:50:14.881 --> 02:50:18.180
<v Speaker 4>like how many people are involved in the decision to torture them,</v>

6094
02:50:18.390 --> 02:50:21.930
<v Speaker 4>how many people or shield themselves from that to protect themselves?</v>

6095
02:50:22.020 --> 02:50:22.853
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to know.</v>

6096
02:50:23.130 --> 02:50:24.330
<v Speaker 4>They just want the information.</v>

6097
02:50:24.420 --> 02:50:24.931
<v Speaker 4>I wonder,</v>

6098
02:50:24.931 --> 02:50:25.261
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6099
02:50:25.261 --> 02:50:27.000
<v Speaker 4>they did a five year study and one of the things that,</v>

6100
02:50:27.001 --> 02:50:31.770
<v Speaker 4>one of the reasons to see I got caught was because a lot of CIA officers were,</v>

6101
02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:34.770
<v Speaker 4>were sending emails back to their superior saying,</v>

6102
02:50:34.830 --> 02:50:35.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't like this.</v>

6103
02:50:35.970 --> 02:50:37.200
<v Speaker 4>This is really bad.</v>

6104
02:50:37.230 --> 02:50:37.351
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

6105
02:50:37.351 --> 02:50:38.184
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6106
02:50:38.280 --> 02:50:39.570
<v Speaker 4>arrested was the whistle blower.</v>

6107
02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:40.890
<v Speaker 4>The whistle blows and Jay,</v>

6108
02:50:41.610 --> 02:50:43.140
<v Speaker 4>the whistle blowers in jail.</v>

6109
02:50:43.350 --> 02:50:45.360
<v Speaker 4>Everybody else who fucking froze,</v>

6110
02:50:45.361 --> 02:50:46.140
<v Speaker 4>none of them.</v>

6111
02:50:46.140 --> 02:50:48.240
<v Speaker 4>None of them frozen stuff frozen.</v>

6112
02:50:48.241 --> 02:50:48.490
<v Speaker 4>Got It.</v>

6113
02:50:48.490 --> 02:50:49.440
<v Speaker 4>I did awful stuff.</v>

6114
02:50:49.980 --> 02:50:50.370
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

6115
02:50:50.370 --> 02:50:50.840
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

6116
02:50:50.840 --> 02:50:54.140
<v Speaker 4>and the other issue from what I understand is that a lot of this world will</v>

6117
02:50:54.270 --> 02:50:56.100
<v Speaker 4>contract was subcontracted out,</v>

6118
02:50:56.370 --> 02:50:57.360
<v Speaker 4>put them in a room naked.</v>

6119
02:50:57.361 --> 02:50:58.680
<v Speaker 4>They chained him to a wall,</v>

6120
02:50:58.800 --> 02:51:01.200
<v Speaker 4>they changed the law and he was naked and it was cold.</v>

6121
02:51:01.250 --> 02:51:02.083
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6122
02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:02.890
<v Speaker 4>Anytime.</v>

6123
02:51:02.890 --> 02:51:03.680
<v Speaker 4>Anytime.</v>

6124
02:51:03.680 --> 02:51:03.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6125
02:51:03.960 --> 02:51:04.793
<v Speaker 4>Died overnight.</v>

6126
02:51:06.870 --> 02:51:08.400
<v Speaker 4>And we don't really know,</v>

6127
02:51:08.401 --> 02:51:09.120
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

6128
02:51:09.120 --> 02:51:14.120
<v Speaker 4>we don't really know how many people this happened to and we don't know a lot.</v>

6129
02:51:14.300 --> 02:51:15.420
<v Speaker 4>Got To get that info.</v>

6130
02:51:15.930 --> 02:51:16.763
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

6131
02:51:16.770 --> 02:51:17.340
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

6132
02:51:17.340 --> 02:51:20.460
<v Speaker 4>but I worked off does Eddie probably he probably just for everyone else at home</v>

6133
02:51:20.640 --> 02:51:22.410
<v Speaker 4>and he probably just went to Pete's fantastic.</v>

6134
02:51:22.411 --> 02:51:23.970
<v Speaker 4>He gets so worked up.</v>

6135
02:51:23.971 --> 02:51:26.540
<v Speaker 4>I was hoping you'd jump over here and choke the shit out of room.</v>

6136
02:51:26.670 --> 02:51:28.800
<v Speaker 4>He loves conspiracy theories.</v>

6137
02:51:28.950 --> 02:51:30.890
<v Speaker 4>He gets upset if there's a rational,</v>

6138
02:51:30.950 --> 02:51:31.340
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

6139
02:51:31.340 --> 02:51:33.810
<v Speaker 4>I hope he gets upset and I love him.</v>

6140
02:51:33.811 --> 02:51:34.680
<v Speaker 4>I love my Eddie Brock.</v>

6141
02:51:34.690 --> 02:51:35.700

6142
02:51:35.760 --> 02:51:37.410
<v Speaker 4>He loves his conspiracy theories.</v>

6143
02:51:37.430 --> 02:51:38.960
<v Speaker 4>I nobody loves conspiracy theories</v>

6183
02:52:54.910 --> 02:52:57.550
<v Speaker 3>JFK didn't support them,</v>

02:53:28.420 --> 02:53:33.190
<v Speaker 3>The vice president Lyndon B Johnson was about to be indicted for two murders.</v>

6197
02:53:33.370 --> 02:53:36.580
<v Speaker 3>Mac Wallace was his bodyguard who murdered people for Lyndon.</v>

02:53:36.581 --> 02:53:37.210
<v Speaker 3>B Johnson.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Lyndon B Johnson was a known gangster.</v>

02:53:39.400 --> 02:53:41.470
<v Speaker 3>He mingled with the top mobster.</v>

6201
02:53:41.500 --> 02:53:42.370
<v Speaker 3>He was so,</v>

6202
02:53:42.460 --> 02:53:43.330
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

6203

<v Speaker 3>he decided the budget on the CIA and the FBI and it was really close to,</v>

6204
02:53:47.200 --> 02:53:48.033
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

02:53:49.480 --> 02:53:50.650
<v Speaker 3>When you look at the,</v>

6208
02:53:50.651 --> 02:53:51.610
<v Speaker 3>what went down,</v>

6209
02:53:51.790 --> 02:53:55.750
<v Speaker 3>the only reason Lyndon B Johnson didn't go to prison for two murders that he</v>

6210
02:53:55.751 --> 02:53:58.060
<v Speaker 3>ordered at Mac Wallace on to kill people.</v>

6211
02:53:58.060 --> 02:54:00.970

02:56:53.011 --> 02:56:57.000
<v Speaker 2>So they sent me information about Seaberry seals.</v>
