19
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.033
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've run in the mornings and then you </v>

20
00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:37.981
<v Speaker 1>run at night too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

21
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a problem.</v>

22
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

23
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.290
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:42.430
<v Speaker 1>That's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

25
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.370
<v Speaker 1>I just fell back on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moderation is for cowards.</v>

26
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.630
<v Speaker 1>So that like pretty much covers any </v>
<v Speaker 1>psycho over doing in excess.</v>

27
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm like just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can be like,</v>

28
00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:54.580
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not a coward.</v>

29
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.500
<v Speaker 1>And what about overtraining?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that bullshit?</v>

30
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.200
<v Speaker 1>It's totally bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you were saying before,</v>

32
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.940
<v Speaker 1>that's when you were 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're 50 now,</v>

33
00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:01.774
<v Speaker 1>but when you were 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could never do what you can do now </v>

34
00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:06.670
<v Speaker 1>when you're 50 now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you tried to do what you do now at</v>

35
00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:09.220
<v Speaker 1>50 when you were 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be overtraining?</v>

36
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

37
00:01:13.541 --> 00:01:15.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you weren't in shape enough,</v>

38
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.950
<v Speaker 1>obviously you're in great shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you do this all the time?</v>

39
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.053
<v Speaker 1>But if you weren't sure</v>

40
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.490
<v Speaker 2>and you tried to keep this up like what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing right now?</v>

41
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

42
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.770
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel,</v>

43
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.030
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel good.</v>

44
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.040
<v Speaker 2>Who was here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

45
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:30.590
<v Speaker 2>Somebody just walked in delivery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

46
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:31.910
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

47
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.880
<v Speaker 2>so when you were 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you do anything?</v>

48
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

49
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:38.780
<v Speaker 2>I've always been active.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

50
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:39.663
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always played sports and ran at 10 k </v>

51
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:42.404
<v Speaker 2>in the summers and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just worked out a little or </v>

52
00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:45.710
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

53
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to lift a little bit,</v>

54
00:01:47.331 --> 00:01:50.440
<v Speaker 2>but not to the level I'm at now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

55
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I look at your instagram,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

57
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.030
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're doing all that shit,</v>

58
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.540
<v Speaker 2>especially that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with a outlaw strength.</v>

59
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric.</v>

60

<v Speaker 2>Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

61
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost trength on instagram.</v>

62
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.540
<v Speaker 2>You guys are doing ridiculous amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>reps.</v>

63
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do.</v>

64
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.930
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all about the reps and it's like,</v>

65
00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:10.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

66
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.583
<v Speaker 2>And like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body gets used to what you ask of </v>

67
00:02:12.981 --> 00:02:13.700
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

68
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.580
<v Speaker 2>If I would have tried to do that exact </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing when I was young,</v>

69
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:17.601
<v Speaker 2>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

70
00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:20.090
<v Speaker 2>it'd be probably be so sore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do anything for a week.</v>

71
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was thinking.</v>

72
00:02:21.321 --> 00:02:22.400
<v Speaker 2>Also when I was looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

73
00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:23.234
<v Speaker 2>if you stopped doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long will it take before it slides </v>

74
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:27.344
<v Speaker 2>off a one day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when I don't work out for one </v>

75
00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:32.570
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm skinny,</v>

76
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:35.180
<v Speaker 2>fat and weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How might no for real?</v>

77
00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:36.014
<v Speaker 2>Like how many days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the longest you've ever taken </v>

78
00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:40.430
<v Speaker 2>off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

79
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.060
<v Speaker 2>probably hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

80
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.040
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm at home,</v>

81
00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:45.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never take any time off.</v>

82
00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:46.760
<v Speaker 2>But when I'm hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's what I'm,</v>

83
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore.</v>

84
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you're hunting,</v>

85
00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:49.814
<v Speaker 2>at least you're hiking a lot of physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>activity and there's a lot going on </v>

86
00:02:53.421 --> 00:02:55.700
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I want to watch your videos,</v>

87
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.740
<v Speaker 2>those instagram videos of you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

88
00:02:57.741 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do a hundred reps of dog </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do a hundred reps</v>

89
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.023
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

90
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.103
<v Speaker 3>Cause right now I told you I'm suffering</v>
<v Speaker 3>through this little tendinitis things </v>

91
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.970
<v Speaker 3>I've been trying to fight off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw,</v>

92
00:03:05.971 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 3>I see all those reps and my elbow starts</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurting when I'm looking at the screen.</v>

93
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.491
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

94
00:03:10.491 --> 00:03:13.400
<v Speaker 4>people ask me about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my joints are about,</v>

95
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.503
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause they're battling different things </v>

96
00:03:15.471 --> 00:03:17.120
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I have no idea.</v>

97
00:03:17.121 --> 00:03:20.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have,</v>

98
00:03:20.061 --> 00:03:22.640
<v Speaker 4>I've been lucky where I don't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>injuries.</v>

99
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.190
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's very disappointing.</v>

100
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.053
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>

101
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my banged up a little bit,</v>

102
00:03:29.691 --> 00:03:31.610
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

103
00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:32.444
<v Speaker 4>I've talked to you before where I've had</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take an advil every day and I'm not </v>

104
00:03:36.231 --> 00:03:36.960
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

105
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.793
<v Speaker 3>Well w tell that story because that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy story and I've talked about it on </v>

106
00:03:40.771 --> 00:03:44.670
<v Speaker 3>the podcast without you being here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I called you after Rhonda.</v>

107
00:03:44.671 --> 00:03:49.020
<v Speaker 3>Patrick did a podcast with me and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>was telling me about the dangers of what</v>

108
00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:51.440
<v Speaker 3>they call nonsteroidal </v>
<v Speaker 3>antiinflammatories.</v>

109
00:03:51.441 --> 00:03:53.680
<v Speaker 3>That's what I can profane is right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she was saying it,</v>

110
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.750
<v Speaker 3>it ruins your gut biome and then it </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually causes inflammation.</v>

111
00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.273
<v Speaker 3>And so that people that are taking advil</v>
<v Speaker 3>every day for inflammation don't even </v>

112
00:04:01.651 --> 00:04:05.370
<v Speaker 3>realize that taking all that advil </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually is causing inflammation.</v>

113
00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:06.204
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

114
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.133
<v Speaker 3>So you quit.</v>

115
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 4>I quit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

116
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:09.664
<v Speaker 4>then I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I almost think it was maybe placebo </v>

117
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 4>a little bit because it's like not only </v>
<v Speaker 4>did it not help after a while,</v>

118
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 4>but it made it worse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially the inflammation.</v>

119
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.330
<v Speaker 4>So after hearing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

120
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 4>who's ever going to question Rhonda </v>
<v Speaker 4>Patrick,</v>

121
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 4>and I would never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm like,</v>

122
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:28.240
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd better stop that.</v>

123
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:29.940
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

124
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 4>since then I haven't been taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

125
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 4>And then I have taken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this,</v>

126
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Speaker 4>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get at the health food store.</v>

127
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 4>It's called Kratom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

128
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.090
<v Speaker 4>You ever heard of that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

129
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that seems to help.</v>

130
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.310
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to outlaw that stuff.</v>

131
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

132
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.710
<v Speaker 3>Apparently that's that Kratom stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had Chris Bell on the podcast,</v>

133
00:04:48.711 --> 00:04:53.711
<v Speaker 3>he's doing a documentary about Kratom </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he did that documentary bigger,</v>

134
00:04:53.781 --> 00:04:54.650
<v Speaker 3>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>faster.</v>

135
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.840
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know who he is.</v>

136
00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.580
<v Speaker 3>He brought in some guys that sell Kratom</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were explaining what it does.</v>

137
00:05:01.581 --> 00:05:06.581
<v Speaker 3>And I tried it and when I tried it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently if you take it in low doses,</v>

138
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.610
<v Speaker 3>it's like almost a mild stimulant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what it felt like to me.</v>

139
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.593
<v Speaker 3>But if you take it in higher doses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it relaxes you and it's really good for </v>

140
00:05:14.691 --> 00:05:17.900
<v Speaker 3>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Chris has had a hip replacements.</v>

141
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.240
<v Speaker 3>What'd he say about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was a positive or not positive?</v>

142
00:05:20.241 --> 00:05:23.060
<v Speaker 3>There's no negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no downsides to it.</v>

143
00:05:23.061 --> 00:05:25.520
<v Speaker 3>It's not addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not bad for you.</v>

144
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.660
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an herb.</v>

145
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.640
<v Speaker 3>It's not toxic at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

146
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:29.860
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if it,</v>

147
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:31.370
<v Speaker 3>so of course the government's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make it illegal.</v>

148
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.950
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

149
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.950
<v Speaker 3>you can't have stuff out there that </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually helps.</v>

150
00:05:33.951 --> 00:05:34.784
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to label it with fucking </v>

151
00:05:35.391 --> 00:05:37.820
<v Speaker 3>heroin and shit and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so crazy.</v>

152
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

153
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:39.683
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

154
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.360
<v Speaker 4>but I think that's helped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But other than that,</v>

155
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.110
<v Speaker 4>I don't take any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean nothing and I feel great.</v>

156
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.240
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

157
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.970
<v Speaker 3>So when you're doing all these reps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

158
00:05:50.971 --> 00:05:51.804
<v Speaker 3>so you do and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do these crazy things on like the </v>

159
00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:56.610
<v Speaker 3>lat pull down machine where you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do the whole stack,</v>

160
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The goal</v>

161
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 5>is 20 of the stack of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking ridiculous.</v>

162
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 5>So how do you not get like joint pain </v>
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't have anything?</v>

163
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:06.350
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So just because you do it all the time,</v>

164
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Addition to it.</v>

165
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 5>I can't make me want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know it's,</v>

166
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 5>but I don't want people to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

167
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's taken a while to work up </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

168
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.801
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

169
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:16.280
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

170
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.113
<v Speaker 5>I don't want people to go and try to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>that right out of the gate and then get </v>

171
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:20.474
<v Speaker 5>hurt because that's what I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>what frustrates people more than </v>

172
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:24.224
<v Speaker 5>anything is when they're excited to make</v>
<v Speaker 5>a change of lifestyle change and then </v>

173
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something happens and then,</v>

174
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.973
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get hurt.</v>

175
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was doing chin ups,</v>

176
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.313
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three or four times a week I decided I </v>

177
00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:38.400
<v Speaker 5>was going to do 50 chin ups,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

178
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 5>at least three or four times a week.</v>

179
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.200
<v Speaker 5>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just make sure I did them all the time.</v>

180
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:45.080
<v Speaker 5>And then on top of that I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>heavy cleans,</v>

181
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.990
<v Speaker 5>90 pound cleans with kettlebells,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cleans and presses.</v>

182
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.900
<v Speaker 5>I started getting this whole nagging </v>
<v Speaker 5>elbow pain.</v>

183
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I didn't want to be a pussy,</v>

184
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 5>so I kept working out through it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

185
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 5>It would be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

186
00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.150
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>during the workout it'd be fine.</v>

187
00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 5>Like it would start to hurt at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>beginning of the workout,</v>

188
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.010
<v Speaker 5>but then once the blood would get flown,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then it would be fine.</v>

189
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.980
<v Speaker 5>And then after a couple of weeks of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

190
00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:08.300
<v Speaker 5>it my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my arms like,</v>

191
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:09.320
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck head.</v>

192
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is enough of this.</v>

193
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cleans their tough though,</v>

194
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.060
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things are hard.</v>

195
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

196
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.300
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know what I can get away with.</v>

197
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.000
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't do dead lifts,</v>

198
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:21.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to do dead lifts.</v>

199
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:22.280
<v Speaker 5>I used to do all this stuff.</v>

200
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.380
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

201
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.263
<v Speaker 5>even though I want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to maybe every once in a while </v>

202
00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:30.770
<v Speaker 5>tried dead lift and cause I know it </v>
<v Speaker 5>feels good.</v>

203
00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:33.260
<v Speaker 5>I mean my hamstrings feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my back feels strong when you're all,</v>

204
00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:35.180
<v Speaker 5>everything works right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I just know that it's just,</v>

205
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.380
<v Speaker 5>it's just not smart because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>high possibility that the chick,</v>

206
00:07:38.381 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 5>you go sell something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something gets tweaked in the bottom and</v>

207
00:07:41.751 --> 00:07:44.110
<v Speaker 5>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one side and then it's,</v>

208
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel it down my leg and I'm like not,</v>

209
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.600
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're taking that hundred 30 pound rock</v>

210
00:07:50.601 --> 00:07:53.480
<v Speaker 5>and throw it in a backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Going up mountains with that.</v>

211
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.010
<v Speaker 5>You still doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

212
00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:57.230
<v Speaker 5>it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My rocks gone.</v>

213
00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:57.951
<v Speaker 5>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Rock,</v>

214
00:07:57.951 --> 00:07:58.784
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody stole it I guess so you will </v>

215
00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:02.870
<v Speaker 5>even in the same spot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>roller it off the side of the mountain.</v>

216
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.490
<v Speaker 5>There's some due to probably jerks off </v>
<v Speaker 5>on that rock and away.</v>

217
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.440
<v Speaker 5>This is Kim Haines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rough sounds fun.</v>

218
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.970
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't be surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen a lot of things online.</v>

219
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.590
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's some,</v>

220
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.750
<v Speaker 5>there's some great people and there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>some crazy people.</v>

221
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.560
<v Speaker 5>Oh this is mostly great people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

222
00:08:19.561 --> 00:08:20.394
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I find that my interactions online or </v>

223
00:08:22.761 --> 00:08:25.780
<v Speaker 5>almost mostly positive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fuck.</v>

224
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.940
<v Speaker 5>Like by far the problem is that's like </v>
<v Speaker 5>having mostly non poisonous food.</v>

225
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:33.951
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

226
00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:36.800
<v Speaker 5>A little bit of poison enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

227
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:37.634
<v Speaker 5>you'd have to do is go to this </v>
<v Speaker 5>restaurant one out of 10 times they </v>

228
00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:40.184
<v Speaker 5>fucking poison.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd never go back to that restaurant </v>

229
00:08:41.361 --> 00:08:42.194
<v Speaker 5>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even think it's one out of 10 I </v>

230
00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:46.070
<v Speaker 5>think that the interactions that I have </v>
<v Speaker 5>online that are negative,</v>

231
00:08:46.071 --> 00:08:48.530
<v Speaker 5>it's not even one out of 100 now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

232
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.030
<v Speaker 5>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for me,</v>

233
00:08:50.031 --> 00:08:52.940
<v Speaker 5>those are the ones that I am drawn to </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I find myself,</v>

234
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.520
<v Speaker 5>I see the negative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go pass all these positive</v>

235
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 2>and then I'll say something because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

236
00:08:58.711 --> 00:08:59.544
<v Speaker 2>if I'm in a bad mood after a whole day </v>
<v Speaker 2>of getting beat down by stupid comments </v>

237
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:06.930
<v Speaker 2>and I'll have to do something and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be like,</v>

238
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.453
<v Speaker 2>why did I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then I go back and like try to </v>

239
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.440
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge some positive ones because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel guilty.</v>

240
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.503
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw you post a picture of a bear that </v>

241
00:09:17.131 --> 00:09:19.800
<v Speaker 2>you shot the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a video of a berry shot.</v>

242
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:20.634
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

243
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.050
<v Speaker 2>I looked at those comments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

244
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:23.530
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which one was,</v>

245
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 2>it was a you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

246
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:27.210
<v Speaker 2>you shot a bear and you were opening its</v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>

247
00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:28.760
<v Speaker 2>The children's teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

248
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:29.520
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

249
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.191
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

250
00:09:30.191 --> 00:09:32.070
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I saw that video and I was like,</v>

251
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:33.900
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a landmine right there.</v>

252
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.930
<v Speaker 2>I know bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

253
00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.560
<v Speaker 2>bears crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

254
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:38.723
<v Speaker 2>That is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one animal that I think people have </v>

255
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:43.920
<v Speaker 2>the most distorted perceptions up cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>it teddy bears.</v>

256
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:44.783
<v Speaker 2>Because Yogi and because I really want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take anybody who has these weird </v>

257
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:51.240
<v Speaker 2>thoughts about bears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just really want to bring them to John</v>

258
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:53.850
<v Speaker 2>and John's place in Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I want to say,</v>

259
00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:57.150
<v Speaker 2>why don't you are going to come hang </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and if we're lucky we're going to</v>

260
00:09:57.151 --> 00:10:01.260
<v Speaker 2>see a bear tear apart a baby bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they do that every day.</v>

261
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.153
<v Speaker 2>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get up out of their dens and they </v>

262
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:04.570
<v Speaker 2>go looking for baby bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

263
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe if we're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll see a bear get ahold of a fawn and</v>

264
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.060
<v Speaker 2>it'll be crying and it'll eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat,</v>

265
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.550
<v Speaker 2>eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat that thing alive.</v>

266
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.640
<v Speaker 2>They'll have a different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll have a different take on it.</v>

267
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.750
<v Speaker 2>They'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill that.</v>

268
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or just people are nuts.</v>

269
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.080
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to bring wolves into </v>
<v Speaker 2>California or Colorado Rather.</v>

270
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.310
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about bringing wolves into</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorado.</v>

271
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.151
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

272
00:10:24.151 --> 00:10:25.860
<v Speaker 2>listen folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to do that.</v>

273
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:27.630
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you already have bears.</v>

274
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw this the other day.</v>

275
00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:30.234
<v Speaker 2>I think I've put up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was what inspired me to put </v>

276
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:32.964
<v Speaker 2>up there was a wolf video I posted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some great wildlife videos out </v>

277
00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:37.111
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

278
00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:37.820
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

279
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

280
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

281
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:42.720
<v Speaker 2>they can be emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like with that bear kill on the,</v>

282
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.570
<v Speaker 2>the delcath was crying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was really,</v>

283
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't even like to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm a hunter,</v>

284
00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:49.434
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

285
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.160
<v Speaker 2>there's one or these wolves were chasing</v>
<v Speaker 2>down this calwell elk.</v>

286
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.260
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a quick process.</v>

287
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.213
<v Speaker 2>And I put that up because I had seen a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of celebrities and I don't even </v>

288
00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:02.910
<v Speaker 2>know who the hell they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Movie Stars I think or something.</v>

289
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:08.120
<v Speaker 2>But they're saved the wolf fond or some </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolf bullshit and they're like Halloween</v>

290
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.690
<v Speaker 2>there to humans and they were howling </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they were wolves.</v>

291
00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Woof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

292
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.273
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean wolves are great wills or I had </v>

293
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.140
<v Speaker 2>wolves or one of my favorite animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

294
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.720
<v Speaker 2>called the Wild White Fang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those books.</v>

295
00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:27.030
<v Speaker 2>I love those Jack London books when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was young.</v>

296
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.970
<v Speaker 2>So wolves have always held a special </v>
<v Speaker 2>place in my heart,</v>

297
00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:32.460
<v Speaker 2>but if they're straight killers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

298
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:36.930
<v Speaker 2>So I mean I'm not hating on him for </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that,</v>

299
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.780
<v Speaker 2>but you just can't have wolves running </v>
<v Speaker 2>around everywhere.</v>

300
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.650
<v Speaker 2>We can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can understand right.</v>

301
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.330
<v Speaker 2>In my neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

302
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.970
<v Speaker 2>I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at home the other,</v>

303
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.290
<v Speaker 2>I made a recording of this cause I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>at home.</v>

304
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:50.124
<v Speaker 2>My dogs are barking like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like nine o'clock at night just </v>

305
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.760
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what the fuck is going on?</v>

306
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:59.910
<v Speaker 2>And I step outside and these coyotes are</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a half a block away from my house.</v>

307
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Just scream,</v>

308
00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:02.933
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

309
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.300
<v Speaker 2>Those are wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are little wools.</v>

310
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they got ahold of something and then</v>

311
00:12:09.291 --> 00:12:14.291
<v Speaker 2>celebrating some dude sent me a video </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's on his page of a,</v>

312
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:19.600
<v Speaker 2>it's a compilation of all these videos </v>
<v Speaker 2>from security cameras of coyotes killing</v>

313
00:12:20.241 --> 00:12:21.680
<v Speaker 2>cats and dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

314
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are wolves.</v>

315
00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.750
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the little bulbs.</v>

316
00:12:25.751 --> 00:12:28.190
<v Speaker 2>That's all they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can breed with wolves.</v>

317
00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they literally are wolves.</v>

318
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:31.063
<v Speaker 2>It's a it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fascinating thing that the </v>

319
00:12:33.381 --> 00:12:35.690
<v Speaker 2>disconnect that people have with </v>
<v Speaker 2>predators,</v>

320
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I look,</v>

321
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.880
<v Speaker 2>if I was in Idaho or Montana and I saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves,</v>

322
00:12:40.881 --> 00:12:42.200
<v Speaker 2>I'd be pumped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

323
00:12:42.201 --> 00:12:43.034
<v Speaker 2>I would think it would be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he got to keep an eye on those </v>

324
00:12:45.681 --> 00:12:46.390
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>folks.</v>

325
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

326
00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.103
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason why they killed him off</v>
<v Speaker 2>150 years ago and it wasn't because </v>

327
00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:54.380
<v Speaker 2>they're awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because they will kill people.</v>

328
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.050
<v Speaker 2>They will kill your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will kill your dog.</v>

329
00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.610
<v Speaker 2>They will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will.</v>

330
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:59.271
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

331
00:12:59.271 --> 00:13:00.104
<v Speaker 2>I've seen wolves in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw a pack on Prince of Wales Island </v>

332
00:13:03.981 --> 00:13:05.330
<v Speaker 2>one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They came down to the,</v>

333
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.250
<v Speaker 2>to the water once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen him,</v>

334
00:13:07.251 --> 00:13:08.084
<v Speaker 2>I had a wolf tag actually when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>British Columbia hunting buffalo and I </v>

335
00:13:11.781 --> 00:13:13.710
<v Speaker 2>thought it was going to get a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a shot at a wolf,</v>

336
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:14.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up there.</v>

337
00:13:14.901 --> 00:13:15.734
<v Speaker 2>But I never have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they give tags up there because </v>

338
00:13:17.271 --> 00:13:19.570
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to diminish the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>

339
00:13:19.571 --> 00:13:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have too many.</v>

340
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.700
<v Speaker 2>It's 50 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same as in Alberta.</v>

341
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

342
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.183
<v Speaker 2>you would get our bear tags to go when </v>
<v Speaker 2>we go up there to John and gins and you </v>

343
00:13:26.741 --> 00:13:28.490
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$50 for a wolf tag also.</v>

344
00:13:28.491 --> 00:13:32.180
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like there's a low number of</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves,</v>

345
00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but every time I've seen him,</v>

346
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.560
<v Speaker 2>I have been in a certain amount of awe </v>
<v Speaker 2>just because had been like this,</v>

347
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.620
<v Speaker 2>this amazing animal for my entire life.</v>

348
00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.513
<v Speaker 2>And I've just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard not to look at a wolf and not </v>

349
00:13:46.221 --> 00:13:49.550
<v Speaker 2>think regal and wild and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

350
00:13:49.551 --> 00:13:51.220
<v Speaker 2>there's that saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

351
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:52.303
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see bears and lions in the </v>

352
00:13:53.571 --> 00:13:55.340
<v Speaker 2>circus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you'll never see a wolf.</v>

353
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>

354
00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.380
<v Speaker 2>and I did the commercial with the wolf </v>
<v Speaker 2>to was amazing,</v>

355
00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.573
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then under armor commercial you </v>

356
00:14:02.571 --> 00:14:03.404
<v Speaker 2>told him it was pretty crazy because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had this scene where the wolf </v>

357
00:14:05.901 --> 00:14:09.970
<v Speaker 2>snarls and they had a save that scene </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the very end.</v>

358
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:11.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it was,</v>

359
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.960
<v Speaker 2>they said it was supposed to be me </v>
<v Speaker 2>against a wolf going after this hill.</v>

360
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:21.640
<v Speaker 2>And then I ended up winning that little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the story as it was told and um,</v>

361
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.350
<v Speaker 2>they needed to get to wolf snarling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they brought some meat out,</v>

362
00:14:27.351 --> 00:14:28.880
<v Speaker 2>gave it some meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they said,</v>

363
00:14:28.881 --> 00:14:31.400
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually gave it then took it away.</v>

364
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.530
<v Speaker 2>And obviously that's going to make any </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal upset,</v>

365
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.930
<v Speaker 2>especially a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they said,</v>

366
00:14:35.931 --> 00:14:39.260
<v Speaker 2>once we do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're done with the wolf because it's,</v>

367
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.330
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to just snap out of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just going to,</v>

368
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.430
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be it's mindset for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>while about it's not going to be happy.</v>

369
00:14:46.431 --> 00:14:47.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>

370
00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go back to that.</v>

371
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.150
<v Speaker 2>I think it shows that end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should.</v>

372
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

373
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:56.503
<v Speaker 4>And that was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean people thought that that was </v>

374
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:00.560
<v Speaker 4>edited and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it wasn't,</v>

375
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.753
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right there with me knowledge right </v>

376
00:15:02.811 --> 00:15:04.160
<v Speaker 4>there with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

377
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:05.143
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did a great job of putting that </v>

378
00:15:05.991 --> 00:15:07.650
<v Speaker 4>commercial together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

379
00:15:07.651 --> 00:15:11.060
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't necessarily snarling up me or </v>
<v Speaker 4>growling at me,</v>

380
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.320
<v Speaker 4>but it was there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

381
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.480
<v Speaker 4>it was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a big was at wolf.</v>

382
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.570
<v Speaker 4>I think it was about 130 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's tall that,</v>

383
00:15:18.571 --> 00:15:19.404
<v Speaker 4>that's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what surprised me is how tall </v>

384
00:15:21.411 --> 00:15:23.060
<v Speaker 4>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Long legs.</v>

385
00:15:23.061 --> 00:15:23.571
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

386
00:15:23.571 --> 00:15:24.560
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

387
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.140
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as endurance goes,</v>

388
00:15:27.141 --> 00:15:27.974
<v Speaker 4>wolves I believe are the number one </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal out there as far as they can run </v>

389
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.550
<v Speaker 4>miles and miles and miles and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>tall and they can just,</v>

390
00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:36.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their gate is uh,</v>

391
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:37.813
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it allows them to go for hours </v>

392
00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:40.100
<v Speaker 4>and miles.</v>

393
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about running with my dog,</v>

394
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.673
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's only a year old and he's in </v>

395
00:15:44.901 --> 00:15:48.140
<v Speaker 3>such good shape now cause he runs with </v>
<v Speaker 3>me all the time.</v>

396
00:15:48.141 --> 00:15:50.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if we run two miles,</v>

397
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.940
<v Speaker 3>I run two miles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he runs seven or eight.</v>

398
00:15:52.941 --> 00:15:53.774
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause he's running over and back and up </v>

399
00:15:55.281 --> 00:15:58.610
<v Speaker 3>and back and up and back and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's amazing.</v>

400
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.160
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how good a shape they're in right out of</v>

401
00:16:01.161 --> 00:16:02.110
<v Speaker 3>the box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

402
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.073
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking puppy and he just books </v>

403
00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:06.230
<v Speaker 3>it up that hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>

404
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.300
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He turns around and looks at me like,</v>

405
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:09.500
<v Speaker 3>come on bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

406
00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:11.390
<v Speaker 3>And he comes running back to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

407
00:16:11.391 --> 00:16:12.000
<v Speaker 3>Animals,</v>

408
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:12.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

409
00:16:12.841 --> 00:16:16.980
<v Speaker 4>animals pretty much have the advantage </v>
<v Speaker 4>over us on everything other than,</v>

410
00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:17.371
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

411
00:16:17.371 --> 00:16:18.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're stronger,</v>

412
00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.390
<v Speaker 4>stronger jaws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

413
00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:21.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Ma,</v>

414
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.880
<v Speaker 4>you're their muscles stronger for what </v>
<v Speaker 4>they have.</v>

415
00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:28.800
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have an endurance as a advantage over</v>

416
00:16:28.801 --> 00:16:31.080
<v Speaker 4>most animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like elk.</v>

417
00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:32.243
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

418
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.290
<v Speaker 4>luckily we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

419
00:16:34.291 --> 00:16:35.280
<v Speaker 4>we can use our minds.</v>

420
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the reason why we're so weak.</v>

421
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:38.503
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so fascinating how things balance </v>

422
00:16:40.461 --> 00:16:43.010
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the US using our mind,</v>

423
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:48.730
<v Speaker 3>creating houses and cities and cars and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just sitting in a chair all day.</v>

424
00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.173
<v Speaker 3>It makes you soft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you figured out how to make a </v>

425
00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:53.270
<v Speaker 3>gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

426
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.490
<v Speaker 3>And that balances everything out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

427
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.630
<v Speaker 3>Unless the gun jams and then nature </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes back into play.</v>

428
00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:00.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

429
00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.420
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these people that are,</v>

430
00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the wolf,</v>

431
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:06.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>save the wolf,</v>

432
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.540
<v Speaker 3>the wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

433
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:08.653
<v Speaker 3>Like you guys go to Idaho,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people are freaking out up there </v>

434
00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.270
<v Speaker 3>like the wolves are okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

435
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.133
<v Speaker 3>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

436
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.590
<v Speaker 3>they're starting to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

437
00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:16.760
<v Speaker 3>you go to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

438
00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.133
<v Speaker 3>Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in a park city recently in Utah </v>

439
00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.660
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was there,</v>

440
00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:24.321
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

441
00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:26.930
<v Speaker 3>we went to a store that had a wolf rug </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

442
00:17:26.931 --> 00:17:29.900
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like yourself selling a wolf rug.</v>

443
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.790
<v Speaker 3>And the guy explained to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

444
00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:32.653
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these wolves are all shot by the </v>

445
00:17:34.791 --> 00:17:38.450
<v Speaker 3>government in Alaska because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>overpopulated.</v>

446
00:17:38.451 --> 00:17:39.284
<v Speaker 3>So they're in these areas where they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to protect the Moose population </v>

447
00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:42.411
<v Speaker 3>for these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

448
00:17:42.411 --> 00:17:43.244
<v Speaker 3>the indigenous people that are so </v>
<v Speaker 3>subsistence hunters and live up there </v>

449
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.800
<v Speaker 3>and they have like a certain quota.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

450
00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:50.340
<v Speaker 3>so it's actually</v>

451
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.173
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a good thing to sell these rugs </v>

452
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:54.390
<v Speaker 5>because they're going to shoot these </v>
<v Speaker 5>wolves no matter what.</v>

453
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.280
<v Speaker 5>They're trying to keep the populations </v>
<v Speaker 5>in check.</v>

454
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:57.383
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's something that these people that </v>

455
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.220
<v Speaker 5>have the pictures see that problem of </v>
<v Speaker 5>like celebrities,</v>

456
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:03.563
<v Speaker 5>missoula.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They probably didn't think that shit </v>

457
00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:05.664
<v Speaker 5>through it all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just think this is a cool thing to </v>

458
00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:08.124
<v Speaker 5>be a part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course everybody wants wolves to </v>

459
00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:10.554
<v Speaker 5>live.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll just go and say we've got to </v>

460
00:18:11.671 --> 00:18:13.530
<v Speaker 5>support the wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've got to save the wolf.</v>

461
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.770
<v Speaker 5>And so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looks like a cool thing for you to be</v>

462
00:18:16.771 --> 00:18:18.210
<v Speaker 5>a part of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think one of them was,</v>

463
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.930
<v Speaker 5>would have been Lisa Bonet Aa isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's like kind of a hippie.</v>

464
00:18:21.931 --> 00:18:23.400
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's a super hippie.</v>

465
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:24.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's got a nose ring.</v>

466
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:25.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything.</v>

467
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:27.870
<v Speaker 5>She's always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's pretty,</v>

468

<v Speaker 5>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

474
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.880
<v Speaker 5>Funny how things work out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's ironical.</v>

475
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:46.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is ironical.</v>

476
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I look,</v>

477
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.300
<v Speaker 5>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think wolves are awesome.</v>

478
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:53.160
<v Speaker 5>Don't get me wrong folks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just,</v>

479
00:18:53.161 --> 00:18:55.110
<v Speaker 5>I just don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is,</v>

480
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.170
<v Speaker 5>this was me too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>before I started hunting for,</v>

481
00:18:58.171 --> 00:19:00.510
<v Speaker 5>I started taking regular trips into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>woods.</v>

482
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:01.890
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't get it.</v>

483
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.510
<v Speaker 5>You just don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to go there.</v>

484
00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.100
<v Speaker 5>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you don't go there,</v>

485
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:06.660
<v Speaker 5>you don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

486
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:07.281
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

487
00:19:07.281 --> 00:19:08.750
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we try to tell the story,</v>

488
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.300
<v Speaker 5>we're telling the story and it's getting</v>
<v Speaker 5>through to some people.</v>

489
00:19:12.301 --> 00:19:13.230
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can see it,</v>

490
00:19:13.231 --> 00:19:15.810
<v Speaker 5>I can see the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's education there.</v>

491
00:19:15.811 --> 00:19:16.644
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm sure you get messages every day </v>

492
00:19:18.121 --> 00:19:20.640
<v Speaker 5>from people who have never hunted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who are interested in it,</v>

493
00:19:20.641 --> 00:19:22.500
<v Speaker 5>who just want to know what the lifestyle</v>
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

494
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.333
<v Speaker 5>Because we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've sort of romanticize the lifestyle </v>

495
00:19:26.071 --> 00:19:26.904
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's,</v>

496
00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.900
<v Speaker 5>and it's easy to do because it's the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mountains and the mountains are,</v>

497
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get that connection and you get that</v>

498
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.730
<v Speaker 5>empowerment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

499
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:35.873
<v Speaker 5>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we are kind of turning the tide </v>

500
00:19:37.981 --> 00:19:38.814
<v Speaker 5>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got a message from a guy a while back </v>

501
00:19:42.001 --> 00:19:45.510
<v Speaker 5>maybe four or five months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who was a Vegan for a long time,</v>

502
00:19:45.511 --> 00:19:47.100
<v Speaker 5>started listening to the podcast at </v>
<v Speaker 5>first,</v>

503
00:19:47.101 --> 00:19:50.910
<v Speaker 5>was upset about the talk about hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ran into some health issues.</v>

504
00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.450
<v Speaker 5>His doctor recommended.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He started eating animal products again,</v>

505
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.633
<v Speaker 5>started with eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>worked his way back up to meet eight </v>

506
00:19:58.651 --> 00:20:00.090
<v Speaker 5>meet again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was getting,</v>

507
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>healthy grass fed,</v>

508
00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:04.950
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

509
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.280
<v Speaker 5>ethically sustained animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ethically raised animals,</v>

510
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:12.000
<v Speaker 5>decided to go hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>became a hunter,</v>

511
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.510
<v Speaker 5>shot his first deer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ate as far as deer and now he's going to</v>

512
00:20:15.511 --> 00:20:15.990
<v Speaker 5>be a hunter.</v>

513
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this guy went full circle,</v>

514
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.550
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And part of the journey of him going for</v>

515
00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.413
<v Speaker 5>full circle was listening to people talk</v>
<v Speaker 5>about it on the podcast and realizing </v>

516
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:25.973
<v Speaker 5>this idea that he had in his head that </v>
<v Speaker 5>these people that are out there hunting </v>

517
00:20:28.681 --> 00:20:29.514
<v Speaker 5>are all people that hate animals and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're cruel and they're just rednecks </v>

518
00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:33.774
<v Speaker 5>that are going out there drinking beer </v>
<v Speaker 5>and shooting these animals and laughing </v>

519
00:20:36.421 --> 00:20:38.110
<v Speaker 5>and hooting and hollering about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

520
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.293
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well there's a couple of points I want </v>

521
00:20:40.831 --> 00:20:41.664
<v Speaker 5>to make there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of them is your podcast has been </v>

522
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.920
<v Speaker 5>amazing for the education part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I</v>

523
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.090
<v Speaker 4>mentioned this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

524
00:20:49.091 --> 00:20:52.030
<v Speaker 4>Adam and I did a podcast at the gritty </v>
<v Speaker 4>bowman and,</v>

525
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.020
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

526
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe's podcast,</v>

527
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:57.440
<v Speaker 4>just because the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the type of person Joe is,</v>

528
00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.140
<v Speaker 4>is as far as being open minded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

529
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:01.690
<v Speaker 4>and giving everything a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

530
00:21:01.691 --> 00:21:04.480
<v Speaker 4>not coming in with biases or the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>type of listeners you have,</v>

531
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:07.660
<v Speaker 4>you've kind of cultivated or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you know,</v>

532
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.660
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they like you because I don't know,</v>

533
00:21:10.661 --> 00:21:12.310
<v Speaker 4>they see themselves in you may be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but anyway,</v>

534
00:21:12.311 --> 00:21:16.750
<v Speaker 4>so those people have come in and listen </v>
<v Speaker 4>to these podcasts like this without that</v>

535
00:21:16.751 --> 00:21:17.584
<v Speaker 4>bias.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you listen to it and listened </v>

536
00:21:20.651 --> 00:21:22.900
<v Speaker 4>to us talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not the Redneck,</v>

537
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:23.913
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>laughing cause they're killing things </v>

538
00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:27.610
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They may have thought it's,</v>

539
00:21:27.611 --> 00:21:28.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this whole thing,</v>

540
00:21:28.631 --> 00:21:29.464
<v Speaker 4>this whole thing we talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so this podcast in particular is I </v>

541
00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:33.724
<v Speaker 4>think been a huge tool as far as </v>
<v Speaker 4>promoting hunting and ethical hunting </v>

542
00:21:37.121 --> 00:21:41.080
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the empowerment of being a hunter.</v>

543
00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.480
<v Speaker 4>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

544
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:45.970
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just this venue.</v>

545
00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.013
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno if we could ever done that </v>

546
00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.810
<v Speaker 4>without,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

547
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.880
<v Speaker 4>the Joe Rogan podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been amazing.</v>

548
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.460
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

549
00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.250
<v Speaker 4>have you noticed that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean with,</v>

550
00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.720
<v Speaker 4>with other things besides hunting?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

551
00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:00.960
<v Speaker 3>I think floating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

552
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:02.910
<v Speaker 3>that's a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

553
00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:06.420
<v Speaker 3>Sensory deprivation tanks that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>business was going under.</v>

554
00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.720
<v Speaker 3>There was virtually no tank centers in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

555
00:22:09.721 --> 00:22:10.554
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one of them in Burbank and I had </v>

556
00:22:12.811 --> 00:22:15.630
<v Speaker 3>heard one of them was in San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just,</v>

557
00:22:15.631 --> 00:22:17.790
<v Speaker 3>they were hard to find.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was none in New York.</v>

558
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.540
<v Speaker 3>Like one guy had one in an apartment in </v>
<v Speaker 3>New York that you could rent out.</v>

559
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.750
<v Speaker 3>A guy had one like that in his house in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vegas that you could rent out.</v>

560
00:22:24.751 --> 00:22:28.170
<v Speaker 3>There was none.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now there's hundreds of data centers</v>

561
00:22:28.171 --> 00:22:30.210
<v Speaker 3>all over the world and we've been using </v>
<v Speaker 3>the form.</v>

562
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.850
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got one in 2002.</v>

563
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.553
<v Speaker 3>I bought a house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the house had a basement and I bought </v>

564
00:22:36.781 --> 00:22:39.690
<v Speaker 3>the house with the basement just being </v>
<v Speaker 3>for two reasons.</v>

565
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.700
<v Speaker 3>One.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

566
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.080
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

567
00:22:43.081 --> 00:22:47.070
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to put a tank in there and two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the yard was big so I could have</v>

568
00:22:47.071 --> 00:22:48.450
<v Speaker 3>my dogs running around the yard.</v>

569
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:49.333
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just wanted to have a yard with the </v>

570
00:22:50.341 --> 00:22:51.160
<v Speaker 3>dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could run around.</v>

571
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.550
<v Speaker 3>Those are my two requirements for house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything else was like,</v>

572
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.720
<v Speaker 3>I really don't give a shit about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as long as there's the TV sits there</v>

573
00:22:57.721 --> 00:22:59.370
<v Speaker 3>and okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's where the bed goes.</v>

574
00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

575
00:23:00.471 --> 00:23:01.304
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's things that are living in deal </v>

576
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.310
<v Speaker 3>sweat when it comes to houses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That dude's just don't sweat.</v>

577
00:23:05.311 --> 00:23:06.660
<v Speaker 3>But for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big one was,</v>

578
00:23:06.661 --> 00:23:07.494
<v Speaker 3>I tried to tank a couple of times at </v>
<v Speaker 3>this place called soothing solutions in </v>

579
00:23:10.681 --> 00:23:11.514
<v Speaker 3>Burbank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if it's around </v>

580
00:23:11.911 --> 00:23:13.830
<v Speaker 3>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

581
00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:15.260
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

582
00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.093
<v Speaker 3>I put a tank in my basement and then I </v>
<v Speaker 3>started ranting and raving about it and </v>

583
00:23:18.931 --> 00:23:22.380
<v Speaker 3>doing these youtube videos about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I got a new tank from the float</v>

584
00:23:22.381 --> 00:23:25.020
<v Speaker 3>lab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I gave my old tank away online.</v>

585
00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.090
<v Speaker 3>It had like a raffle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not raffle,</v>

586
00:23:27.091 --> 00:23:28.830
<v Speaker 3>but like a random draw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

587
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:29.753
<v Speaker 3>just send me an email.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gave an email address out and I'll </v>

588
00:23:31.831 --> 00:23:32.664
<v Speaker 3>just pick a random person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I literally just scroll through my </v>

589
00:23:35.161 --> 00:23:35.994
<v Speaker 3>email.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like bank right there and pick this </v>

590
00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:38.634
<v Speaker 3>guy out and set my tank to him and had </v>
<v Speaker 3>it set up and sent the salt down to </v>

591
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:42.583
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the little deal.</v>

592
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:43.930
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

593
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:44.813
<v Speaker 3>that alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just having that contest and given away </v>

594
00:23:47.001 --> 00:23:47.930
<v Speaker 3>a tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

595
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.003
<v Speaker 3>And then putting together this video for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tank at red band put together this </v>

596
00:23:52.401 --> 00:23:55.250
<v Speaker 3>really cool video about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these tank centers,</v>

597
00:23:55.251 --> 00:23:56.750
<v Speaker 3>because we talking about it on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>

598
00:23:56.751 --> 00:23:57.584
<v Speaker 3>started opening up all over the world to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the point where now when you sign up at </v>

599
00:24:00.471 --> 00:24:02.780
<v Speaker 3>a lot of tank centers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first time you go there they say,</v>

600
00:24:02.781 --> 00:24:05.450
<v Speaker 3>how'd you hear about us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether it was through the Internet,</v>

601
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.310
<v Speaker 3>through books or Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm one of their,</v>

602
00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.520
<v Speaker 3>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the options on a lot of their</v>

603
00:24:10.521 --> 00:24:11.354
<v Speaker 3>questionnaires and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that probably has had even more of an </v>

604
00:24:14.841 --> 00:24:16.190
<v Speaker 3>impact than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than hunting.</v>

605
00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.673
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

606
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing.</v>

607
00:24:18.911 --> 00:24:20.470
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hear it all the time.</v>

608
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.880
<v Speaker 4>Well people have told me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

609
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:24.790

<v Speaker 4>Rogan.</v>

610
00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.380
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's some comments that I've gotten.</v>

611
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:28.843
<v Speaker 3>Go again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're concentrating on the negative </v>

612
00:24:29.541 --> 00:24:30.351
<v Speaker 3>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

613
00:24:30.351 --> 00:24:32.450
<v Speaker 3>but I wouldn't be bow on it if it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

614
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:33.523
<v Speaker 3>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I wouldn't be me if it wasn't for </v>

615
00:24:35.031 --> 00:24:37.010
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be the me that I am now.</v>

616
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:37.780
<v Speaker 3>So there you go.</v>

617
00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:41.020
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I put it cause I was like,</v>

618
00:24:41.021 --> 00:24:42.280
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

619
00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we've talked about it before,</v>

620
00:24:45.131 --> 00:24:50.131
<v Speaker 4>but this podcast gets to more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more people than CNN.</v>

621
00:24:50.231 --> 00:24:51.130
<v Speaker 4>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

622
00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.053
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

623
00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.013
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I heard a Jordan Peterson talking </v>

624
00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:59.570
<v Speaker 4>about we don lemon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>

625
00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.200
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause I,</v>

626
00:25:01.201 --> 00:25:04.200
<v Speaker 4>I I trust this more than CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 4>CNN,</v>

627
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.073
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a redneck.</v>

628
00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.110
<v Speaker 4>You're on that Fox news tip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

629
00:25:08.111 --> 00:25:11.530
<v Speaker 4>Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that's where you get your news solid</v>

630
00:25:11.531 --> 00:25:13.540
<v Speaker 4>reporting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is legit.</v>

631
00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.160
<v Speaker 4>That's Sean Hannity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy.</v>

632
00:25:15.161 --> 00:25:17.050
<v Speaker 4>I trust him with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep,</v>

633
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:19.450
<v Speaker 4>I hear Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

634
00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:19.841
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

635
00:25:19.841 --> 00:25:20.674
<v Speaker 4>and I heard Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were talking about his recent </v>

636
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:24.610
<v Speaker 4>trajectory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

637
00:25:24.611 --> 00:25:26.010
<v Speaker 4>he's been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

638
00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:27.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm assuming you've been brilliant in </v>
<v Speaker 4>his whole life.</v>

639
00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:29.253
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the last 18 months or two years or </v>

640
00:25:30.401 --> 00:25:31.234
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think a lot of that is because of </v>

641
00:25:33.161 --> 00:25:35.260
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I put in my phone,</v>

642
00:25:35.261 --> 00:25:36.094
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do some research on Joe </v>

643
00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:39.880
<v Speaker 4>Rogan before this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to turn the tables on him,</v>

644
00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:43.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to podcast him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was like putting it in there,</v>

645
00:25:43.961 --> 00:25:47.200
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan influence or Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

646
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:49.870
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fact or whatever.</v>

647
00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:51.820
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't find anything.</v>

648
00:25:51.821 --> 00:25:52.660
<v Speaker 4>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

649
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:56.920
<v Speaker 4>I think I need to write something to </v>
<v Speaker 4>quantify that,</v>

650
00:25:56.921 --> 00:25:58.780
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

651
00:25:58.810 --> 00:25:59.643
<v Speaker 4>this gets to so many,</v>

652
00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:02.110
<v Speaker 3>it gets so a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in all honesty,</v>

653
00:26:02.111 --> 00:26:03.400
<v Speaker 3>like just being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

654
00:26:03.401 --> 00:26:04.234
<v Speaker 3>not even just trying to be humble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all I'm doing is talking about shit </v>

655
00:26:07.541 --> 00:26:09.400
<v Speaker 3>that's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's real simple.</v>

656
00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:14.080
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm not really doing anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>unusual other than that,</v>

657
00:26:14.081 --> 00:26:17.440
<v Speaker 3>just being open minded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I try very hard to do.</v>

658
00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:18.413
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you say you just do this and just </v>

659
00:26:20.171 --> 00:26:21.820
<v Speaker 3>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody else does that.</v>

660
00:26:21.821 --> 00:26:23.650
<v Speaker 3>They come in with these biases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

661
00:26:23.651 --> 00:26:25.390
<v Speaker 3>so you say that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

662
00:26:25.391 --> 00:26:27.250
<v Speaker 3>You say you just do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big thing.</v>

663
00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.210
<v Speaker 3>I think people need to stop doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a big part of the problem</v>

664
00:26:31.211 --> 00:26:33.910
<v Speaker 3>we have in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was talking with,</v>

665
00:26:33.911 --> 00:26:35.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

666
00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.200
<v Speaker 3>Dan Harris from good morning America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he's on,</v>

667
00:26:38.201 --> 00:26:40.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

668
00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was,</v>

669
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:45.960
<v Speaker 3>he used a word that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love a term that I love.</v>

670
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.790
<v Speaker 3>Toxic tribalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

671
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I mean,</v>

672
00:26:49.201 --> 00:26:50.034
<v Speaker 3>you see that with CNN versus Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like neither one of them want to </v>

673
00:26:52.681 --> 00:26:53.514
<v Speaker 3>look at things subjectively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fox News has a very clear right wing </v>

674
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:57.063
<v Speaker 3>bias.</v>
<v Speaker 3>CNN has a very clear left wing bias and </v>

675
00:26:59.341 --> 00:27:00.780
<v Speaker 3>they just go to war with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

676
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:03.840
<v Speaker 3>And then the president's call and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody fake news and you know,</v>

677
00:27:03.841 --> 00:27:05.550
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to,</v>

678
00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:10.590
<v Speaker 3>to see what's really going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People want to look at their side,</v>

679
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.110
<v Speaker 3>they want to defend their side and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>never want to say,</v>

680
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.490
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see this guy's point.</v>

681
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:15.383
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you gotta be able to see people's </v>

682
00:27:15.991 --> 00:27:17.010
<v Speaker 3>points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

683
00:27:17.011 --> 00:27:20.610
<v Speaker 3>that's one thing that I always say about</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegans after I make fun of them.</v>

684
00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:21.773
<v Speaker 3>I say I s I understand why you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to do that and I think it's a </v>

685
00:27:25.891 --> 00:27:28.050
<v Speaker 3>compassionate choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

686
00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.060
<v Speaker 3>I totally understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I do and I,</v>

687
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.943
<v Speaker 3>I support their decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

688
00:27:34.081 --> 00:27:34.914
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you should be real careful with </v>

689
00:27:36.091 --> 00:27:38.550
<v Speaker 3>your health if you're doing that though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not bullshitting.</v>

690
00:27:38.551 --> 00:27:43.110
<v Speaker 3>This is not me being facetious or yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not being a meathead.</v>

691
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.153
<v Speaker 3>You should be careful with your health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of things that you should </v>

692
00:27:45.901 --> 00:27:48.150
<v Speaker 3>probably check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>B 12 is a big one.</v>

693
00:27:48.151 --> 00:27:50.710
<v Speaker 3>That's a huge issue with vegans is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>b,</v>

694
00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.520
<v Speaker 3>12 deficiencies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think if you,</v>

695
00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:54.383
<v Speaker 3>if you are a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should consider supplementing with </v>

696
00:27:56.371 --> 00:27:58.020
<v Speaker 3>things that you don't have a problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>with eating.</v>

697
00:27:58.021 --> 00:28:02.590
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe even some cricket protein or </v>
<v Speaker 3>mollusks like cell shelf.</v>

698
00:28:02.591 --> 00:28:04.830
<v Speaker 3>If people should look into shellfish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shellfish.</v>

699
00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:08.130
<v Speaker 3>Not only is it are they sustainable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're so primitive.</v>

700
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.830
<v Speaker 3>They don't even have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a neurological system.</v>

701
00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.600
<v Speaker 3>Like they don't feel any fucking pain.</v>

702
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.070
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could eat clams all day long.</v>

703
00:28:14.071 --> 00:28:15.420
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what the fuck is going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

704
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.433
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have this idea about clams because </v>

705
00:28:18.361 --> 00:28:21.220
<v Speaker 3>they do that cause they close that </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow now.</v>

706
00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:22.083
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the poor little thing is just trying to </v>

707
00:28:22.681 --> 00:28:25.140
<v Speaker 3>hide like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that in there,</v>

708
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:26.610
<v Speaker 3>the oysters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

709
00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.100
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know anything about it either.</v>

710
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.160
<v Speaker 3>I know about bow hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes you do.</v>

711
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.320
<v Speaker 3>Yes you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to me,</v>

712
00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:36.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meat tastes better.</v>

713
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel better to know.</v>

714
00:28:39.271 --> 00:28:41.080
<v Speaker 3>But as you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

715
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:44.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a problem with vegans or </v>
<v Speaker 3>their diet or,</v>

716
00:28:44.251 --> 00:28:45.630
<v Speaker 3>and I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

717
00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:48.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think about,</v>

718
00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.580
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing an animal,</v>

719
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.280
<v Speaker 3>nobody wants to kill animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

720
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:54.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not,</v>

721
00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.330
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's never,</v>

722
00:28:56.331 --> 00:28:58.020
<v Speaker 3>he didn't want to kill an animal for no </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>

723
00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:58.913
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want the meat of the animal and </v>

724
00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:03.900
<v Speaker 3>killing it and just not enjoyable.</v>

725
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

726
00:29:04.831 --> 00:29:07.650
<v Speaker 3>it's part of the process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird sense of loss,</v>

727
00:29:07.651 --> 00:29:08.180
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

728
00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I get that.</v>

729
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:10.471
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

730
00:29:10.471 --> 00:29:12.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to kill any animals.</v>

731
00:29:12.451 --> 00:29:13.980
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

732
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:15.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

733
00:29:15.211 --> 00:29:17.370
<v Speaker 3>just having that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

734
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.620
<v Speaker 3>the biases that come with it or is what </v>
<v Speaker 3>causes problems?</v>

735
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:21.463
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there they're doing what they think is </v>

736
00:29:23.431 --> 00:29:27.120
<v Speaker 3>good to shame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who eat meat or attack people who</v>

737
00:29:27.121 --> 00:29:27.954
<v Speaker 3>eat meat and especially attack people </v>
<v Speaker 3>actively go out and kill the animals </v>

738
00:29:30.931 --> 00:29:31.764
<v Speaker 3>themselves because they think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another it will lessen the </v>

739
00:29:34.891 --> 00:29:37.620
<v Speaker 3>amount of animals that are killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the opposite happens.</v>

740
00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:41.530
<v Speaker 3>I think it shores up people's aggression</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards vegans get it.</v>

741
00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:42.643
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they firmly plant their heels on the </v>

742
00:29:44.501 --> 00:29:46.840
<v Speaker 3>other side of the line and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>

743
00:29:46.841 --> 00:29:50.320
<v Speaker 3>hippie [inaudible] asshole tree hug and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pitches.</v>

744
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:51.730
<v Speaker 3>Go eat your sprouts.</v>

745
00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go over here and eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>burger.</v>

746
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:54.783
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that go out and </v>

747
00:29:55.151 --> 00:29:57.130
<v Speaker 3>eat burgers because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

748
00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.580
<v Speaker 3>I probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

749
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:59.463
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend Mike Hockridge from BC met </v>

750
00:30:00.461 --> 00:30:01.210
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

751
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:02.043
<v Speaker 3>Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike was dealing with people from </v>

752
00:30:04.301 --> 00:30:05.134
<v Speaker 3>Vancouver that were sending him hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>mail because of wolves now where he </v>

753
00:30:09.071 --> 00:30:09.904
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lives in the real British Columbia </v>

754
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:15.820
<v Speaker 3>where there's fucking while olds and </v>
<v Speaker 3>grizzly bears everywhere.</v>

755
00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:16.693
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We found a a wolf kill while we were up </v>

756
00:30:19.001 --> 00:30:19.870
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty wild.</v>

757
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.060
<v Speaker 3>Wolf had got ahold of a moose calf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just tore it apart.</v>

758
00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.090
<v Speaker 3>The pack of wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all over the place and it,</v>

759
00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:26.293
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty fresh too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's shot a bunch of them and </v>

760
00:30:30.281 --> 00:30:31.114
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some group of people found out that he </v>

761
00:30:34.841 --> 00:30:35.674
<v Speaker 3>shot wolves and where he lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get an unlimited amount of wolf </v>

762
00:30:38.711 --> 00:30:39.340
<v Speaker 3>tags,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

763
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.173
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to kill wolves as much as</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible that you can kill a hundred </v>

764
00:30:41.741 --> 00:30:42.574
<v Speaker 3>words a day if you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then that's totally legal because they </v>

765
00:30:45.221 --> 00:30:48.760
<v Speaker 3>have ranchers up there and like one of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of his neighbors,</v>

766
00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.370
<v Speaker 3>they wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a in the middle of the winter,</v>

767
00:30:51.371 --> 00:30:53.740
<v Speaker 3>wolf got ahold of one of the cows and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>got a bunch of wolves,</v>

768
00:30:53.741 --> 00:30:55.600
<v Speaker 3>a pack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these people are in their house.</v>

769
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:59.050
<v Speaker 3>They listened to a pack of wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terror plot and cow that's like,</v>

770
00:30:59.051 --> 00:31:00.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hundred yards from their fucking bed.</v>

771
00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.000
<v Speaker 3>Scary freaky shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

772
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:03.903
<v Speaker 3>They live in the real while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these people were sending him all </v>

773
00:31:05.951 --> 00:31:08.170
<v Speaker 3>these death threats and so he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

774
00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.060
<v Speaker 3>every time you guys send me one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

775
00:31:10.061 --> 00:31:12.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to shoot a wolf in the guts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

776
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.580
<v Speaker 3>Radio silence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They stopped.</v>

777
00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:16.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said to this lady,</v>

778
00:31:16.961 --> 00:31:18.490
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time you send me an email,</v>

779
00:31:18.491 --> 00:31:19.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to shoot a wolf in the guts.</v>

780
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

781
00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:22.443
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was probably in front of a keyboard </v>

782
00:31:23.231 --> 00:31:25.240
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

783
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.960
<v Speaker 3>it's a tough one though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a tough one.</v>

784
00:31:28.961 --> 00:31:29.651
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

785
00:31:29.651 --> 00:31:30.484
<v Speaker 3>You know the BC was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just outlawed grizzly hunting up </v>

786
00:31:33.851 --> 00:31:36.880
<v Speaker 3>there because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did a poll in,</v>

787
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.920
<v Speaker 3>I think Vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not only that,</v>

788
00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:44.260
<v Speaker 3>they did a very limited email poll with </v>
<v Speaker 3>about 3000 participants.</v>

789
00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.113
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And 76% of 3000 people said that they </v>

790
00:31:48.761 --> 00:31:49.594
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were opposed to grizzly bear </v>

791
00:31:50.681 --> 00:31:51.514
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think if you're going to have any </v>

792
00:31:53.711 --> 00:31:54.544
<v Speaker 3>kind of a poll like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should have to have these people </v>

793
00:31:57.941 --> 00:31:59.920
<v Speaker 3>educated first as to what their voting </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

794
00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.920
<v Speaker 3>Do you really understand what it's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>up there?</v>

795
00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.570
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause if you talk to Mike,</v>

796
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.433
<v Speaker 3>Mike shot a grizzly bear in the head </v>
<v Speaker 3>from like 20 feet away as it was trying </v>

797
00:32:09.611 --> 00:32:10.444
<v Speaker 3>to get into his cabin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they are fucking ferocious and </v>

798
00:32:14.231 --> 00:32:15.064
<v Speaker 3>they're huge and there's a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no shortage of grizzly bears in </v>

799
00:32:18.941 --> 00:32:21.670
<v Speaker 3>British Columbia now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's that whole education piece.</v>

800
00:32:21.671 --> 00:32:22.750
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

801
00:32:22.751 --> 00:32:25.870
<v Speaker 3>you could take that to even voting in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our elections.</v>

802
00:32:25.871 --> 00:32:29.500
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we need to educate people.</v>

803
00:32:29.501 --> 00:32:31.060
<v Speaker 3>People need to be educated on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>topics,</v>

804
00:32:31.061 --> 00:32:34.510
<v Speaker 3>not just hunting but everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they can vote.</v>

805
00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:35.403
<v Speaker 3>Their vote still counts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you can't tell people they </v>

806
00:32:37.301 --> 00:32:39.100
<v Speaker 3>can't vote because that's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>

807
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:40.310
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to</v>

808
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:42.860
<v Speaker 5>have a certain amount of education or </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't vote.</v>

809
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.310
<v Speaker 5>But what they need to do is trust the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who do now.</v>

810
00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:47.283
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

811
00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.273
<v Speaker 5>like up there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the biologist who are actually have </v>

812
00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:53.690
<v Speaker 5>boots on the ground or but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there are no,</v>

813
00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:56.480
<v Speaker 5>the what grizzly are doing and how many </v>
<v Speaker 5>there are.</v>

814
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:58.770
<v Speaker 5>Let's go ahead and trust those people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

815
00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.530
<v Speaker 5>hard to see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you're in Vancouver though.</v>

816
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:03.980
<v Speaker 5>The problem is you're in Vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're eating at a nice Sushi restaurant</v>

817
00:33:03.981 --> 00:33:05.720
<v Speaker 5>and hanging out with friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

818
00:33:05.721 --> 00:33:07.850
<v Speaker 5>he'd go into the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything's beautiful.</v>

819
00:33:07.851 --> 00:33:09.000
<v Speaker 5>Vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so nice.</v>

820
00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:12.380
<v Speaker 5>So that you look at the mountains to </v>
<v Speaker 5>whistler off in the distance.</v>

821
00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.340
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's so pretty.</v>

822
00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to kill a bear.</v>

823
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:15.763
<v Speaker 5>Don't kill the best and now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you just go on a six hour car </v>

824
00:33:18.801 --> 00:33:19.634
<v Speaker 5>ride,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just go.</v>

825
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:21.170
<v Speaker 5>Just keep going north.</v>

826
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.153
<v Speaker 5>Keep going north and I you car and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>want you to go for a two mile hike into </v>

827
00:33:25.611 --> 00:33:27.410
<v Speaker 5>the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just go for a two mile hike.</v>

828
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.860
<v Speaker 5>And I want you to sit there for a day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just sit there for a day.</v>

829
00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:32.900
<v Speaker 5>You're going to see some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

830
00:33:32.901 --> 00:33:34.970
<v Speaker 5>And you will realize you will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

831
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.910
<v Speaker 5>this is a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This world is,</v>

832
00:33:37.911 --> 00:33:40.850
<v Speaker 5>this is a wild world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like these things out here.</v>

833
00:33:40.851 --> 00:33:43.100
<v Speaker 5>They don't give a shit if people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>real or not.</v>

834
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.140
<v Speaker 5>They are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're doing what they've always done.</v>

835
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:47.360
<v Speaker 5>The bear running around looking for shit</v>
<v Speaker 5>to eat,</v>

836
00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.313
<v Speaker 5>the animals running around looking to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get the fuck away from things that are </v>

837
00:33:49.911 --> 00:33:52.490
<v Speaker 5>trying to eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is how they've always existed.</v>

838
00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:53.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

839
00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:54.373
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's,</v>

840
00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:56.120
<v Speaker 5>you know those bare and it's just like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

841
00:33:56.121 --> 00:33:59.330
<v Speaker 5>the wolves killing the cow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You said 20 feet from the,</v>

842
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.320
<v Speaker 5>wherever they lived.</v>

843
00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.760
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's just what they do.</v>

844
00:34:01.761 --> 00:34:03.740
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's what grizzlies do.</v>

845
00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:05.510
<v Speaker 5>Grizzlies are going to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're can,</v>

846
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.823
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they can kill a moose calf or an elk </v>

847
00:34:08.911 --> 00:34:09.744
<v Speaker 5>cath or a deer fon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not wasting a bunch of energy </v>

848
00:34:12.321 --> 00:34:15.320
<v Speaker 5>chasing a full grown animal around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they're using less energy,</v>

849
00:34:15.321 --> 00:34:17.360
<v Speaker 5>burning less calories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get an easy kill.</v>

850
00:34:17.361 --> 00:34:19.760
<v Speaker 5>They get high protein.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just what they do.</v>

851
00:34:19.761 --> 00:34:22.970
<v Speaker 5>But the reason why we need to kill them </v>
<v Speaker 5>is we're not,</v>

852
00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:25.010
<v Speaker 5>they're never going to stop doing what </v>
<v Speaker 5>they do.</v>

853
00:34:25.011 --> 00:34:27.680
<v Speaker 5>We just need to control the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So how often that's happening.</v>

854
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:28.543
<v Speaker 5>If that's happening too often,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because there's too many of them will </v>

855
00:34:30.741 --> 00:34:32.690
<v Speaker 5>then the Moose and elk numbers go down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

856
00:34:32.691 --> 00:34:34.610
<v Speaker 5>and it's this balancing act and people </v>
<v Speaker 5>will say,</v>

857
00:34:34.611 --> 00:34:35.444
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just let animals take care of </v>

858
00:34:37.821 --> 00:34:39.590
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They always have been and it's like,</v>

859
00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:40.931
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've,</v>

860
00:34:40.931 --> 00:34:42.410
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've always hunted.</v>

861
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.230
<v Speaker 5>It's just now that people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well we shouldn't hunt.</v>

862
00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.910
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they're trying to take man out of the</v>

863
00:34:46.911 --> 00:34:47.744
<v Speaker 5>equation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

864
00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.850
<v Speaker 5>Man's always been in the equation as far</v>
<v Speaker 5>as hunting.</v>

865
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:50.833
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think people have an idea about it </v>

866
00:34:52.341 --> 00:34:55.820
<v Speaker 5>based on the excess that people have </v>
<v Speaker 5>committed.</v>

867
00:34:55.821 --> 00:34:56.654
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people have committed some atrocities </v>

868
00:34:57.441 --> 00:34:59.090
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to animals in this country</v>
<v Speaker 5>alone.</v>

869
00:34:59.091 --> 00:35:01.640
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's seen those stacks of buffalo </v>
<v Speaker 5>heads.</v>

870
00:35:01.641 --> 00:35:06.190
<v Speaker 5>And when they were doing market hunting </v>
<v Speaker 5>in particular in the 18 hundreds and ma,</v>

871
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:08.980
<v Speaker 5>many people attribute that to hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

872
00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.690
<v Speaker 5>erroneous Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not really what it was.</v>

873
00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:16.130
<v Speaker 5>What killed off all those animals was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing called market hunting.</v>

874
00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:17.413
<v Speaker 5>And this is back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People have to realize there's no </v>

875
00:35:18.711 --> 00:35:20.930
<v Speaker 5>refrigerators back then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

876
00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:21.793
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you weren't like getting steaks and </v>

877
00:35:22.791 --> 00:35:23.624
<v Speaker 5>freezing them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there was not a lot of like large </v>

878
00:35:25.341 --> 00:35:27.680
<v Speaker 5>scale agriculture back then either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

879
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:28.743
<v Speaker 5>there was a few ranchers and farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when people had all these animals </v>

880
00:35:32.481 --> 00:35:33.314
<v Speaker 5>that were out in the wild and they could</v>
<v Speaker 5>hire these people that were in the </v>

881
00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 5>military,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had just gotten done</v>

882
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:40.650
<v Speaker 3>with the war and they were good shots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would,</v>

883
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.513
<v Speaker 3>this would be a good way to make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>living and go out there and shoot some </v>

884
00:35:42.901 --> 00:35:43.734
<v Speaker 3>buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring back the tongues buffalo and </v>

885
00:35:45.071 --> 00:35:45.904
<v Speaker 3>tongue was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would shoot a giant buffalo and </v>

886
00:35:47.971 --> 00:35:51.810
<v Speaker 3>just take the tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd take the hides and you know,</v>

887
00:35:51.811 --> 00:35:54.390
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they would take the meat and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some and then they,</v>

888
00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.660
<v Speaker 3>they wiped out almost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wiped out most of the deere,</v>

889
00:35:57.661 --> 00:35:58.494
<v Speaker 3>most of the elk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the antelope until guys like </v>

890
00:36:00.631 --> 00:36:02.430
<v Speaker 3>Teddy Roosevelt came along well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

891
00:36:02.431 --> 00:36:03.121
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

892
00:36:03.121 --> 00:36:04.990
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit the fucking brakes.</v>

893
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.310
<v Speaker 3>Like we've got to protect these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got to protect this land.</v>

894
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:09.383
<v Speaker 3>We've got to protect these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to set up private or public land </v>

895
00:36:12.091 --> 00:36:15.030
<v Speaker 3>rather were will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do anything to it where people</v>

896
00:36:15.031 --> 00:36:15.864
<v Speaker 3>could just roam and hike and camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And fish and hunt and do whatever you </v>

897
00:36:19.411 --> 00:36:21.660
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we got to make sure we protect these</v>

898
00:36:21.661 --> 00:36:22.494
<v Speaker 3>animal populations because they got down</v>
<v Speaker 3>to some incredibly low number of elk at </v>

899
00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:28.350
<v Speaker 3>the turn of the century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

900
00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:29.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

901
00:36:29.151 --> 00:36:31.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean they almost wiped out buffalo </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>

902
00:36:31.131 --> 00:36:33.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the hell got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know,</v>

903
00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is as you know,</v>

904
00:36:35.571 --> 00:36:36.404
<v Speaker 2>as conservationists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we like to say that hunters are </v>

905
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:38.833
<v Speaker 2>conservationists now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so one of the figures that we share </v>

906
00:36:43.431 --> 00:36:46.610
<v Speaker 2>is that there's more animals now than </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a hundred years ago,</v>

907
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:48.680
<v Speaker 2>so I dunno know what they were a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

908
00:36:48.681 --> 00:36:50.360
<v Speaker 2>what the numbers were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

909
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:51.860
<v Speaker 2>very low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

910
00:36:51.861 --> 00:36:55.500
<v Speaker 2>there's more whitetail deer today than </v>
<v Speaker 2>when Columbus landed,</v>

911
00:36:56.090 --> 00:37:00.830
<v Speaker 2>although Columbus road didn't really get</v>
<v Speaker 2>here when Columbus landed in The Bahamas</v>

912
00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:06.520
<v Speaker 2>is more white tail deer here than now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And part of that is because of farming,</v>

913
00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:09.110
<v Speaker 2>which is real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

914
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.000
<v Speaker 2>like a white tail deer is a weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

915
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're kind of a farm animal a lot of a</v>

916
00:37:13.461 --> 00:37:14.360
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

917
00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.860
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's almost like,</v>

918
00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.113
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing it right as far as </v>

919
00:37:18.591 --> 00:37:21.080
<v Speaker 2>killing the older bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're almost farming.</v>

920
00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:21.973
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not harvesting when they're </v>

921
00:37:22.611 --> 00:37:24.980
<v Speaker 2>young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're waiting till they're mature.</v>

922
00:37:24.981 --> 00:37:26.420
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like,</v>

923
00:37:26.421 --> 00:37:27.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're letting that crop,</v>

924
00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:29.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>age essentially.</v>

925
00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:32.000
<v Speaker 2>What does this Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1910,</v>

926
00:37:32.001 --> 00:37:32.834
<v Speaker 2>the u s forest service estimated there </v>
<v Speaker 2>were only between 501,000 elk in </v>

927
00:37:37.131 --> 00:37:38.150
<v Speaker 2>Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

928
00:37:38.151 --> 00:37:40.700
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now there's a hundred and what?</v>

929
00:37:40.701 --> 00:37:42.340
<v Speaker 2>25,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

930
00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:44.920
<v Speaker 2>150,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

931
00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.980
<v Speaker 2>There was a fuck a lot more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The numbers of fuckload.</v>

932
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:50.660
<v Speaker 2>There's 10 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

933
00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.381
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

934
00:37:51.381 --> 00:37:52.214
<v Speaker 2>the elk population North America stood </v>
<v Speaker 2>at about 10 million animals before </v>

935
00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:58.910
<v Speaker 2>European settlers came and systematic </v>
<v Speaker 2>wholesale hunting began.</v>

936
00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.250
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

937
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:02.203
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] Colorado became famous for </v>
<v Speaker 2>his trophy hunting and European </v>

938
00:38:04.311 --> 00:38:07.250
<v Speaker 2>gentleman traveled here to try their </v>
<v Speaker 2>luck,</v>

939
00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:10.190
<v Speaker 2>Sir George Gore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard that guy was a con.</v>

940
00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:12.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm just making that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a trophy hunter.</v>

941
00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:16.430
<v Speaker 2>He's a trophy hunter for whom Gore pass </v>
<v Speaker 2>near.</v>

942
00:38:16.431 --> 00:38:17.264
<v Speaker 2>Kremmling is named,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came from Ireland to hunt in western </v>

943
00:38:20.271 --> 00:38:21.104
<v Speaker 2>Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He shot elk and deer from the bed of a </v>

944
00:38:23.091 --> 00:38:24.350
<v Speaker 2>wagon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a Dick.</v>

945
00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.113
<v Speaker 2>That's real honey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He only took prime hides and large </v>

946
00:38:28.791 --> 00:38:32.480
<v Speaker 2>antlers and left amit to rot a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a bad person.</v>

947
00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 2>That's that sentence right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's when people think happens</v>

948
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.710
<v Speaker 5>that I don't know anybody who ever does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's illegal.</v>

949
00:38:38.711 --> 00:38:40.260
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>coaching.</v>

950
00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:41.123
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a good thing.</v>

951
00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:46.000
<v Speaker 5>The good thing to point out is illegal </v>
<v Speaker 5>to not take the meat rallies illegal.</v>

952
00:38:46.001 --> 00:38:46.834
<v Speaker 5>To not take the mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to take the neck meet in </v>

953
00:38:48.521 --> 00:38:50.050
<v Speaker 5>Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to cut out the neck,</v>

954
00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:52.030
<v Speaker 5>all edible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you got all the edible meat.</v>

955
00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:55.660
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and even between the ribs,</v>

956
00:38:55.661 --> 00:38:56.494
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I dunno about if that's a law in </v>

957
00:38:58.091 --> 00:39:00.250
<v Speaker 5>Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know in Alaska.</v>

958
00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:01.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you killed a moose.</v>

959
00:39:01.901 --> 00:39:02.734
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're even taking that meat in between </v>

960
00:39:03.851 --> 00:39:04.571
<v Speaker 5>the ribs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

961
00:39:04.571 --> 00:39:07.600
<v Speaker 5>you're taking all edible meat there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so people say,</v>

962
00:39:07.601 --> 00:39:09.730
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you one of those trophy hunters?</v>

963
00:39:09.731 --> 00:39:10.564
<v Speaker 5>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just don't take the head and leave </v>

964
00:39:12.101 --> 00:39:12.934
<v Speaker 5>it to rot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

965
00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.490
<v Speaker 5>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would you do that anyway?</v>

966
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:18.580
<v Speaker 5>It's so stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's illegal anyway.</v>

967
00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.110
<v Speaker 5>If you walked down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

968
00:39:20.111 --> 00:39:20.944
<v Speaker 5>if you eat steak and you walked down the</v>
<v Speaker 5>street and you saw like for some reason </v>

969
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:29.530
<v Speaker 5>someone had put coolers of prime rib </v>
<v Speaker 5>eyes,</v>

970
00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:31.870
<v Speaker 5>it just sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd be like,</v>

971
00:39:31.871 --> 00:39:34.360
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is this here for?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once we'd look around,</v>

972
00:39:34.361 --> 00:39:36.370
<v Speaker 5>is there anybody here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got to take this.</v>

973
00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This can just leave this here.</v>

974
00:39:38.351 --> 00:39:39.460
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I have to do to rot,</v>

975
00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.080
<v Speaker 5>so let's just do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you're hunting,</v>

976
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.480
<v Speaker 5>that's just you finding it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

977
00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:46.930
<v Speaker 5>Probably you would not eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now that I think about it,</v>

978
00:39:46.931 --> 00:39:47.500
<v Speaker 5>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

979
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:51.880
<v Speaker 5>what is this a trap I get the point you </v>
<v Speaker 5>were making that when I was making is if</v>

980
00:39:51.881 --> 00:39:55.120
<v Speaker 5>you go through all the effort to go hunt</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you do eat meat,</v>

981
00:39:55.121 --> 00:39:56.080
<v Speaker 5>of course you're going to eat the meat.</v>

982
00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:56.943
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the meat you're eating is incredibly </v>

983
00:39:59.231 --> 00:40:00.140
<v Speaker 5>precious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

984
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:03.400
<v Speaker 5>like elk meat is incredibly proud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so delicious.</v>

985
00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.091
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's,</v>

986
00:40:04.091 --> 00:40:06.940
<v Speaker 5>here's what I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so when we go hunting,</v>

987
00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.580
<v Speaker 5>and I can speak for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure I can speak for you too.</v>

988
00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:10.613
<v Speaker 5>For when you go hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you bring back all the Mutu can you eat </v>

989
00:40:14.771 --> 00:40:15.604
<v Speaker 5>all the Mutu Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that animal you like sharing it that </v>

990
00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.410
<v Speaker 5>typical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll just say American,</v>

991
00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.170
<v Speaker 5>but waste 40% of their food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

992
00:40:23.171 --> 00:40:24.490
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to stop this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What they buy.</v>

993
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.640
<v Speaker 5>You know how what I'm done now in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>garbage type thing,</v>

994
00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:30.640
<v Speaker 5>so hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know I don't do that.</v>

995
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:33.910
<v Speaker 5>If I kill a bowl and I bring all that </v>
<v Speaker 5>meat home,</v>

996
00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:36.970
<v Speaker 5>40% of that is not going in the garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

997
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.530
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's because we,</v>

998
00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:42.490
<v Speaker 5>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have that connection with the animal.</v>

999
00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.670
<v Speaker 5>To me it'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I'm thinking about it,</v>

1000
00:40:45.671 --> 00:40:47.380
<v Speaker 5>it'd be disrespectful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I just,</v>

1001
00:40:47.381 --> 00:40:50.680
<v Speaker 5>it's so it's worth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are so much value in it.</v>

1002
00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:53.590
<v Speaker 5>I would never throw it in the garbage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

1003
00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:57.310
<v Speaker 5>But when you buy it at a store,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

1004
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:59.590
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying people are putting,</v>

1005
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:02.380
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>40% of prime rib and the garbage,</v>

1006
00:41:02.381 --> 00:41:05.560
<v Speaker 5>but just as a rule,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we waste a lot of food.</v>

1007
00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:06.753
<v Speaker 5>I think it would be a good thing for </v>
<v Speaker 5>every single human being to grow some </v>

1008
00:41:11.801 --> 00:41:14.560
<v Speaker 5>vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you eat meat too,</v>

1009
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:16.660
<v Speaker 5>once in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kill an animal.</v>

1010
00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.180
<v Speaker 5>I think everyone should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really do.</v>

1011
00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:22.030
<v Speaker 5>There was an article that I tweeted </v>
<v Speaker 5>today about,</v>

1012
00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:22.990
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1013
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:25.720
<v Speaker 5>I forget the subject,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that title of it rather,</v>

1014
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:28.270
<v Speaker 5>but it was something along the lines of </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>

1015
00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:32.940
<v Speaker 5>it's not healthy to hide from the fact </v>
<v Speaker 5>that there's,</v>

1016
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:35.470
<v Speaker 5>there's death involved in eating meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1017
00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.360
<v Speaker 5>I did a terrible job of paraphrasing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1018
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:40.550
<v Speaker 5>Fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What that title is.</v>

1019
00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:41.900
<v Speaker 5>So article.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1020
00:41:41.901 --> 00:41:46.100
<v Speaker 5>We shouldn't hide the gory details of </v>
<v Speaker 5>how meet reaches our plate.</v>

1021
00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:48.050
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are the chickens?</v>

1022
00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:52.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's very,</v>

1023
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:53.533
<v Speaker 5>very important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that like what I'm looking </v>

1024
00:41:54.921 --> 00:41:56.750
<v Speaker 5>at right there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>life is fucking gross.</v>

1025
00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.310
<v Speaker 4>That's her life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1026
00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:00.783
<v Speaker 5>It's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause I eat chickens but I don't eat my </v>

1027
00:42:02.171 --> 00:42:03.830
<v Speaker 5>chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like someone said,</v>

1028
00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.430
<v Speaker 5>do you eat those chickens Mike?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now there's like my pets.</v>

1029
00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:08.140
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1030
00:42:08.141 --> 00:42:10.000
<v Speaker 5>But I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll eat the shit out of some chicken.</v>

1031
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you,</v>

1032
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:14.000
<v Speaker 4>but when you think of it like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1033
00:42:14.001 --> 00:42:15.590
<v Speaker 4>so when we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're looking at this picture,</v>

1034
00:42:15.591 --> 00:42:18.860
<v Speaker 4>I know people looking at or listening to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the podcast can't see the picture,</v>

1035
00:42:18.861 --> 00:42:19.694
<v Speaker 4>but I mean</v>

1036
00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:23.030
<v Speaker 5>we're looking at an enormous warehouse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean enormous.</v>

1037
00:42:23.031 --> 00:42:23.864
<v Speaker 5>It looks like several football fields </v>
<v Speaker 5>long and it's filled with chickens that </v>

1038
00:42:26.961 --> 00:42:29.390
<v Speaker 5>are just stuffed on top of each other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1039
00:42:29.391 --> 00:42:29.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1040
00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.530
<v Speaker 4>And that's their life until they get </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed.</v>

1041
00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.000
<v Speaker 4>And when you think of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1042
00:42:33.001 --> 00:42:37.530
<v Speaker 4>would I rather do that or would I rather</v>
<v Speaker 4>procure my own meat hunting?</v>

1043
00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.650
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody would say that's not right.</v>

1044
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:46.410
<v Speaker 4>And I believe hunting is a noble way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>procuring me.</v>

1045
00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:50.640
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think when you look at that,</v>

1046
00:42:50.641 --> 00:42:51.474
<v Speaker 4>but people don't see that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't think about that when they </v>

1047
00:42:52.741 --> 00:42:54.090
<v Speaker 4>order their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1048
00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:57.120
<v Speaker 4>chick chicken nuggets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not thinking about that.</v>

1049
00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.073
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1050
00:42:58.110 --> 00:42:59.430
<v Speaker 5>just hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just hungry.</v>

1051
00:42:59.431 --> 00:43:02.160
<v Speaker 5>It's just too easy to get food mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's too easy to get food.</v>

1052
00:43:02.161 --> 00:43:04.500
<v Speaker 5>That's why we're such fat toes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a big problem.</v>

1053
00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:05.693
<v Speaker 5>But it's also just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's also too easy psychologically </v>

1054
00:43:08.221 --> 00:43:10.410
<v Speaker 5>because we just don't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any connect.</v>

1055
00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:14.250
<v Speaker 5>I think you should have a connection if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're eating a living thing just seems,</v>

1056
00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.130
<v Speaker 5>it just seems like you should understand</v>
<v Speaker 5>what it is.</v>

1057
00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.140
<v Speaker 5>Just for your own mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for you,</v>

1058
00:43:19.141 --> 00:43:20.520
<v Speaker 5>for your own,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for just a,</v>

1059
00:43:20.521 --> 00:43:25.030
<v Speaker 5>for a sense of balance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And 97% of Americans eat meat,</v>

1060
00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:30.000
<v Speaker 5>meat and something like 65% of vegans </v>
<v Speaker 5>when they get drunk eat meat.</v>

1061
00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:33.230
<v Speaker 5>It really has some crazy number.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some crate,</v>

1062
00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.680
<v Speaker 5>it might,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might be higher than that.</v>

1063
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.590
<v Speaker 5>I think I read it was like 84% of </v>
<v Speaker 5>vegans.</v>

1064
00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:38.723
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just making up numbers at this </v>

1065
00:43:39.421 --> 00:43:40.254
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fine.</v>

1066
00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:41.790
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mean it might've been a tweet</v>
<v Speaker 5>I read.</v>

1067
00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:43.620
<v Speaker 5>Somebody might have just made that up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just going to audit us.</v>

1068
00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:44.483
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but so a Vegan drunk meets like an ex </v>

<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

1139
00:46:24.631 --> 00:46:27.510
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in Brazil,</v>

1140
00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:28.373
<v Speaker 3>they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know how to do it and they have </v>

1141
00:46:29.911 --> 00:46:32.880
<v Speaker 3>grass fed meat over there too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not fucking around with the corn</v>

1142
00:46:32.881 --> 00:46:33.714
<v Speaker 3>fed and all that.</v>

1143
00:46:35.521 --> 00:46:36.354
<v Speaker 3>we have over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it is weird how you get a lot of </v>

1144
00:46:38.641 --> 00:46:39.474
<v Speaker 3>hate from people over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's because of the propaganda and </v>

1145
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:46.680
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the negative aspects of trophy hunting.</v>

1146
00:46:46.681 --> 00:46:47.514
<v Speaker 3>Like when you see a guy standing there </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a dead elephant or some shit like </v>

1147
00:46:50.791 --> 00:46:51.031

00:46:51.631 --> 00:46:54.360
<v Speaker 3>would you kill an elephant?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that kind of stuff in people's mind</v>

1150
00:46:54.361 --> 00:46:55.350
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a giraffe.</v>

1151
00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:56.183
<v Speaker 3>Why the fuck would you kill a giraffe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people have this idea that these </v>

1152
00:46:58.141 --> 00:46:59.760
<v Speaker 3>people just go over there to kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1153
00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:03.690
<v Speaker 3>And so this is what trophy hunting is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they see you with an elk,</v>

1154
00:47:03.691 --> 00:47:04.111

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:15.240
<v Speaker 3>What do you think you're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're killing,</v>

1161
00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.380
<v Speaker 3>killing with your credit card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now it's a,</v>

1162
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:19.433
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all we can do is try to educate and </v>

1163
00:47:21.031 --> 00:47:23.580
<v Speaker 3>share the sh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>share the lifestyle.</v>

1164
00:47:23.581 --> 00:47:25.500
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important,</v>

1165
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:28.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be leaders and,</v>

1166
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 3>and how we share that,</v>

1167
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:30.843
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I see things that I wish weren't </v>

1168
00:47:32.771 --> 00:47:34.210
<v Speaker 2>shared sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1169
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:35.830
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've even made mistakes.</v>

1170
00:47:35.831 --> 00:47:36.664
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to say that I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm dialed in and I never make them a </v>

1171
00:47:39.101 --> 00:47:42.310
<v Speaker 2>shit mistake on what I post or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1172
00:47:42.311 --> 00:47:43.144
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think we need to be stewards of </v>

1173
00:47:44.411 --> 00:47:46.600
<v Speaker 2>hunting and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if we do it right,</v>

1174
00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:47.763
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to get everybody and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to educate everybody </v>

1175
00:47:49.331 --> 00:47:51.400
<v Speaker 2>because there's some that just won't </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen.</v>

1176
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:54.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can make some inroads.</v>

1177
00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.650
<v Speaker 2>I think we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>

1178
00:47:56.651 --> 00:47:57.484
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's important to relay </v>

1179
00:47:59.171 --> 00:47:59.630
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

1180
00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:01.040
<v Speaker 3>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think there's,</v>

1181
00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:01.903
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's things to be learned from a lot </v>

1182
00:48:04.491 --> 00:48:05.900
<v Speaker 3>of experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1183
00:48:05.901 --> 00:48:09.890
<v Speaker 3>like talking to you and talking to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Courtney Galt,</v>

1184
00:48:09.891 --> 00:48:14.000
<v Speaker 3>doe Walter about just ultra marathons </v>
<v Speaker 3>and endurance running.</v>

1185
00:48:14.001 --> 00:48:14.834
<v Speaker 3>There's something to be learned from </v>
<v Speaker 3>that about the kind of mindset that it </v>

1186
00:48:16.851 --> 00:48:17.684
<v Speaker 3>takes to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think having these conversations with </v>

1187
00:48:19.521 --> 00:48:22.400
<v Speaker 3>you guys has changed the way I look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>those things.</v>

1188
00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:23.271
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and it was,</v>

1238
00:50:21.511 --> 00:50:22.650
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1239
00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:23.690
<v Speaker 2>he wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1240
00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:26.280
<v Speaker 2>his brother wanted to make it be </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1241

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1242
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.140

<v Speaker 4>it's hard to say.</v>

1243
00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:31.773
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he ran into the problem that I've seen </v>

1244
00:50:33.251 --> 00:50:35.770
<v Speaker 3>many people run into those goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 3>prescription pills.</v>

1245
00:50:35.771 --> 00:50:37.300
<v Speaker 3>They're so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are.</v>

1246
00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:40.330
<v Speaker 3>They're one of the scariest things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are in modern society.</v>

1247
00:50:40.331 --> 00:50:42.190
<v Speaker 3>And it's something that's not talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about enough.</v>

1248
00:50:42.191 --> 00:50:46.150
<v Speaker 3>You only hear it talked about from </v>
<v Speaker 3>family members of people that have lost.</v>

1249
00:50:46.151 --> 00:50:48.850
<v Speaker 3>People are close friends and people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>have lost people.</v>

1250
00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:52.450
<v Speaker 3>But it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a giant problem in this country.</v>

1251
00:50:52.451 --> 00:50:55.360
<v Speaker 3>We're losing thousands of people every </v>
<v Speaker 3>day too.</v>

1252
00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:56.530
<v Speaker 4>Pain pills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1253
00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.240
<v Speaker 4>Well I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1254
00:50:58.450 --> 00:50:59.283
<v Speaker 4>I put something up not long ago about </v>
<v Speaker 4>suicide and it was amazing how many </v>

1255
00:51:03.851 --> 00:51:05.830
<v Speaker 4>people sent me messages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1256
00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:06.693
<v Speaker 4>how many people are affected or just are</v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with negative thoughts of their </v>

1257
00:51:11.891 --> 00:51:16.780
<v Speaker 4>own and then a little mini battles and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just like that one post.</v>

1258
00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:18.333
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people just need to know that </v>

1259
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:21.500
<v Speaker 4>there's people out there that care,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1260
00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:25.450
<v Speaker 4>But I don't know how with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they get into that cycle of pills,</v>

1261
00:51:25.451 --> 00:51:28.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a doctor.</v>

1262
00:51:28.571 --> 00:51:31.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how that works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what they're dealing with.</v>

1263
00:51:31.301 --> 00:51:32.970
<v Speaker 4>I just know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1264
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:37.630
<v Speaker 4>social media can be used.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can be irritating sometimes,</v>

1265
00:51:37.631 --> 00:51:38.920
<v Speaker 4>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can be good,</v>

1266
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:42.310
<v Speaker 4>especially for people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's able to reach out and maybe,</v>

1267
00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:43.503
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get some support or encouragement or </v>

1268
00:51:45.521 --> 00:51:46.750
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1269
00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:47.613
<v Speaker 4>And it's</v>

1270
00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:49.750
<v Speaker 3>well for someone that they admire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you,</v>

1271
00:51:49.751 --> 00:51:51.010
<v Speaker 3>that's gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1272
00:51:51.011 --> 00:51:52.780
<v Speaker 3>if they can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can read something like that.</v>

1273
00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.660
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes that's all people need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a little wind in their sail.</v>

1274
00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.033
<v Speaker 3>Just a little something.</v>

1275
00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:59.350
<v Speaker 4>So something I'm gonna say I dorm thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

1276
00:51:59.351 --> 00:52:00.131
<v Speaker 4>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1277
00:52:00.131 --> 00:52:01.930
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was in the news.</v>

1278
00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:05.290
<v Speaker 4>There's a quarterback up at Washington </v>
<v Speaker 4>state that killed himself.</v>

1279
00:52:05.291 --> 00:52:06.124
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to be the starting </v>

1280
00:52:06.191 --> 00:52:09.010
<v Speaker 4>quarterback on the football team,</v>
<v Speaker 4>21 years old.</v>

1281
00:52:09.011 --> 00:52:12.010
<v Speaker 4>And he shot himself a few weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I didn't want,</v>

1282
00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:15.580
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to say that well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I don't want to say that.</v>

1283
00:52:15.581 --> 00:52:17.140
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's because it's an athlete.</v>

1284
00:52:17.141 --> 00:52:18.790
<v Speaker 4>That's why anybody cares,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1285
00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:21.940
<v Speaker 4>But it's anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's any person who's 21 years old.</v>

1286
00:52:21.941 --> 00:52:24.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking what a tragedy that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it just,</v>

1287
00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:26.920
<v Speaker 4>that was in the new,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it happened.</v>

1288
00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:29.230
<v Speaker 4>And so that's why I put it up and for </v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1289
00:52:29.231 --> 00:52:31.210
<v Speaker 4>or I can't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like I'm,</v>

1290
00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:32.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1291
00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:36.020
<v Speaker 4>I just want people to be aware and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>to have that number to call.</v>

1292
00:52:36.021 --> 00:52:36.854
<v Speaker 4>And the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a 21 year old feeling that </v>

1293
00:52:38.501 --> 00:52:42.520
<v Speaker 4>exact same way and there's this </v>
<v Speaker 4>seemingly some kid who had everything.</v>

1294
00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:46.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean the co a college quarterback and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just like,</v>

1295
00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:50.860
<v Speaker 4>it just breaks my heart to think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they would get to,</v>

1296
00:52:50.861 --> 00:52:54.700
<v Speaker 4>that he would get to that point where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1297
00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:55.593
<v Speaker 4>killing himself was the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's just harder for younger people </v>

1298
00:52:58.751 --> 00:52:59.600
<v Speaker 4>because they don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a</v>

1299
00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:03.860
<v Speaker 3>lot of life experiences and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know that like a guy like you or I who's</v>

1300
00:53:03.861 --> 00:53:04.694
<v Speaker 3>lived a long time and I've seen a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit that you've gone through your ups </v>

1301
00:53:07.821 --> 00:53:09.490
<v Speaker 3>and downs and when you hit it down you </v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

1302
00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:13.940
<v Speaker 3>well this sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know it's going to get better.</v>

1303
00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:15.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just got to figure out why it sucks.</v>

1304
00:53:15.801 --> 00:53:17.420
<v Speaker 3>Address why it sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1305
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:18.463
<v Speaker 3>apologize if you need to correct </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the issue is that's making you </v>

1306
00:53:22.431 --> 00:53:24.830
<v Speaker 3>feel like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pull yourself out of it,</v>

1307
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:25.913
<v Speaker 3>do a bunch of positive things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next thing you know you're going to be </v>

1308
00:53:27.811 --> 00:53:28.644
<v Speaker 3>okay again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1309
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:31.010
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes when you're 21 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do,</v>

1310
00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.850
<v Speaker 3>you think the world's over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1311
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:33.713
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when my girlfriend dumped me </v>

1312
00:53:34.501 --> 00:53:37.350
<v Speaker 3>when I was 18 I was so fucking bummed </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1313
00:53:37.351 --> 00:53:41.130
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't imagine living without her.</v>

1314
00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:44.430
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe that this is over.</v>

1315
00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:47.790
<v Speaker 3>I can't put you so devastated cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking Europe baby.</v>

1316
00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:50.880
<v Speaker 3>18 year old baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know Jack Shit.</v>

1317
00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:55.980
<v Speaker 3>But when you get older and you've had </v>
<v Speaker 3>more life experiences and more things,</v>

1318
00:53:55.981 --> 00:53:59.850
<v Speaker 3>you get more perspective and you kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand like what this feeling is bad</v>

1319
00:53:59.851 --> 00:54:01.200
<v Speaker 3>feeling and you just know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1320
00:54:01.201 --> 00:54:02.034
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just gotta get the fuck out of the </v>

1321
00:54:02.311 --> 00:54:03.720
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to go hang out with my friends,</v>

1322
00:54:03.721 --> 00:54:06.240
<v Speaker 3>got to go do a bunch of positive things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go hit the gym,</v>

1323
00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:08.850
<v Speaker 3>take a yoga class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do something fun,</v>

1324
00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:10.980
<v Speaker 3>and then everything's going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You realize,</v>

1325
00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:11.940
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1326
00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:15.810
<v Speaker 3>life's not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no such thing as a perfect life.</v>

1327
00:54:15.811 --> 00:54:17.730
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have ups,</v>

1328
00:54:17.731 --> 00:54:20.640
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have downs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you're 21 years old,</v>

1329
00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:21.503
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also who knows what else was going </v>

1330
00:54:24.391 --> 00:54:25.224
<v Speaker 3>on in his life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it was pills or whether it's a </v>

1331
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:28.133
<v Speaker 3>head trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of football players wind up </v>

1332
00:54:30.151 --> 00:54:32.070
<v Speaker 3>killing themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a coincidence.</v>

1333
00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:34.170
<v Speaker 3>It's directly related to head drama.</v>

1334
00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:35.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

1335
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:36.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to speculate.</v>

1336
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:37.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't eat that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

1337
00:54:37.951 --> 00:54:38.784
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1338
00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:39.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1339
00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:43.180
<v Speaker 4>it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get a lot of,</v>

1340
00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:44.930
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you said,</v>

1341
00:54:44.931 --> 00:54:47.600
<v Speaker 4>well you go hang out with your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sometimes,</v>

1342
00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:51.710
<v Speaker 4>cause I've been in certain groups where </v>
<v Speaker 4>even my friends aren't positive,</v>

1343
00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:53.630
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're like,</v>

1344
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:55.490
<v Speaker 4>that even makes it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can.</v>

1345
00:54:55.491 --> 00:54:56.324
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where I see the positives of </v>

1346
00:54:57.831 --> 00:54:58.664
<v Speaker 4>social media and I wish I could respond </v>
<v Speaker 4>to everybody who sends me a message and </v>

1347
00:55:01.731 --> 00:55:02.564
<v Speaker 4>just say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1348
00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:03.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

1349
00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:05.630
<v Speaker 4>it's Cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep hammering or whatever.</v>

1350
00:55:05.631 --> 00:55:06.464
<v Speaker 4>But I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I get inspiration from people </v>

1351
00:55:08.751 --> 00:55:11.300
<v Speaker 4>online and if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1352
00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:14.210
<v Speaker 4>I get a shout out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it feels good.</v>

1353
00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:16.430
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where's your t shirt?</v>

1354
00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:18.140
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it means it doesn't mean</v>

1355
00:55:18.141 --> 00:55:19.140
<v Speaker 4>anything but eat some.</v>

1356
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:20.990
<v Speaker 4>But it does to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1357
00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:25.550
<v Speaker 4>And so I just know what it's like to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a small town and to not,</v>

1358
00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:28.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying I didn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 4>positive friends or whatever,</v>

1359
00:55:28.251 --> 00:55:31.460
<v Speaker 4>but I would know what it feel like to </v>
<v Speaker 4>not have anybody to really lean on,</v>

1360
00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:32.340
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1361
00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:37.340
<v Speaker 4>And so I tried to think about maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>people like I was and a man.</v>

1362
00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:41.990
<v Speaker 4>I just think we can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno together Shit we can,</v>

1363
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:44.210
<v Speaker 4>we can do a lot of positive things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1364
00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:45.650
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

1365
00:55:45.651 --> 00:55:47.730
<v Speaker 4>it breaks my heart to think of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1366
00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:49.880
<v Speaker 4>living negative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1367
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:50.790
<v Speaker 4>Each day.</v>

1368
00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:51.623
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's one of the things </v>

1369
00:55:52.501 --> 00:55:56.610
<v Speaker 3>that social media can do that's positive</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also podcasts can do that's positive</v>

1370
00:55:56.970 --> 00:55:57.803
<v Speaker 3>is it exposes you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's people that are listening </v>

1371
00:56:00.151 --> 00:56:03.900
<v Speaker 3>to this conversation right now that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're taking comfort from it.</v>

1372
00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:04.763
<v Speaker 3>Like they might be either stuck in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shitty job or they might be alone and </v>

1373
00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:09.383
<v Speaker 3>they're here with us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're here hanging out and they </v>

1374
00:56:10.621 --> 00:56:12.960
<v Speaker 3>realize those people like us out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is friendly,</v>

1375
00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:16.620
<v Speaker 3>positive people out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're alone,</v>

1376
00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:19.410
<v Speaker 3>at least you're not around negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>twats,</v>

1377
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:20.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1378
00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:20.893
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of negative people around </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's unfortunate that they're </v>

1379
00:56:23.321 --> 00:56:25.780
<v Speaker 3>negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish you could fix them all,</v>

1380
00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:27.033
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes life gives you these </v>
<v Speaker 3>lessons in the form of disastrous lives </v>

1381
00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:35.170
<v Speaker 3>that you witness and you see these </v>
<v Speaker 3>disasters lives and you just go,</v>

1382
00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:36.033
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get the fuck away from this </v>

1383
00:56:37.631 --> 00:56:41.620
<v Speaker 3>crazy ass hole and live my life in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>more positive,</v>

1384
00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:42.513
<v Speaker 3>productive way because I see what can </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen if you blame the world for all </v>

1385
00:56:45.551 --> 00:56:46.384
<v Speaker 3>your problems and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you do is hate and you hate on </v>

1386
00:56:49.001 --> 00:56:53.920
<v Speaker 3>people that are successful and you hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>on people that are whatever wealthy,</v>

1387
00:56:53.921 --> 00:56:55.440
<v Speaker 3>good looking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fic pick,</v>

1388
00:56:55.450 --> 00:56:56.140
<v Speaker 3>pick the thing.</v>

1389
00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:59.290
<v Speaker 3>Girls that are thin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the thing is that you hate on,</v>

1390
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:02.950
<v Speaker 3>there's so many people out there that </v>
<v Speaker 3>waste all of their energy doing that.</v>

1391
00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:05.140
<v Speaker 3>And if you're around them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't fix them.</v>

1392
00:57:05.141 --> 00:57:05.974
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard to fix people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what you can do is see what they're </v>

1393
00:57:09.821 --> 00:57:10.654
<v Speaker 3>doing that's so negative and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely degrade the quality of their </v>

1394
00:57:17.381 --> 00:57:19.840
<v Speaker 3>life and just don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Recognize,</v>

1395
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:21.790
<v Speaker 3>recognize that this is not the way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>

1396
00:57:21.791 --> 00:57:25.090
<v Speaker 3>And then go listen to a podcast with </v>
<v Speaker 3>some positive people and say,</v>

1397
00:57:25.091 --> 00:57:28.450
<v Speaker 3>look at this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy's out there eating healthy,</v>

1398
00:57:28.451 --> 00:57:30.580
<v Speaker 3>doing good things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lost 15 pounds.</v>

1399
00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:31.533
<v Speaker 3>She went running and just decided to </v>
<v Speaker 3>start doing marathons and he did this </v>

1400
00:57:35.111 --> 00:57:37.360
<v Speaker 3>and this guy's building a fucking house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can.</v>

1401
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:41.920
<v Speaker 3>You can find a lot of positive examples </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people online today.</v>

1402
00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:42.813
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the reasons why I'm so </v>

1403
00:57:44.411 --> 00:57:46.450
<v Speaker 4>drawn to ultra running.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1404
00:57:46.451 --> 00:57:47.284
<v Speaker 4>because whether you like running or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that do that are some great </v>

1405
00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.380
<v Speaker 4>positive people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1406
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:54.640
<v Speaker 4>they're savages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

1407
00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:55.683
<v Speaker 4>But they're also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get so use of winning those many </v>

1408
00:57:58.871 --> 00:58:01.270
<v Speaker 4>battles in the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you,</v>

1409
00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:02.373
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to and you get strength from </v>

1410
00:58:04.211 --> 00:58:07.450
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So at the finish line or during the race</v>

1411
00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:09.740
<v Speaker 4>is you can get a bond.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1412
00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:11.020
<v Speaker 4>there's a saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1413
00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:14.080
<v Speaker 4>he sheds his blood with me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will be my brother.</v>

1414
00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:15.730
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

1415
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:18.590
<v Speaker 4>that's probably derive from war and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I get that.</v>

1416
00:58:18.591 --> 00:58:20.410
<v Speaker 4>And it's not like a war or anything like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1417
00:58:20.411 --> 00:58:21.244
<v Speaker 4>but it's going through a mini battle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you do that with somebody and </v>

1418
00:58:24.551 --> 00:58:27.070
<v Speaker 4>you share that experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get that connection.</v>

1419
00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:28.593
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's why even though I don't know </v>

1420
00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.740
<v Speaker 4>courtney that well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1421
00:58:32.741 --> 00:58:37.741
<v Speaker 4>I know what she does and I really look </v>
<v Speaker 4>up to her ability to just be a beast and</v>

1422
00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:41.193
<v Speaker 4>that whole environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ultra running environment and </v>

1423
00:58:43.061 --> 00:58:47.140
<v Speaker 4>community is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is empowering for me for sure.</v>

1424
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:48.070
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

1425
00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:51.550
<v Speaker 4>that's why I love even just being around</v>
<v Speaker 4>people like that,</v>

1426
00:58:51.610 --> 00:58:52.990
<v Speaker 4>it just makes you better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1427
00:58:52.991 --> 00:58:54.430
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're exceptional.</v>

1428
00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:54.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1429
00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:58.710
<v Speaker 3>Those are exceptional people there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have an exceptional mind to be able</v>

1430
00:58:58.711 --> 00:59:03.030
<v Speaker 3>to endure something like a 238 mile race</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the Moab desert.</v>

1431
00:59:03.450 --> 00:59:05.070
<v Speaker 3>You've got to be something special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1432
00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:06.213
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a little thing in the back of </v>

1433
00:59:07.281 --> 00:59:08.550
<v Speaker 3>has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has want to just sit down,</v>

1434
00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:09.763
<v Speaker 4>lunches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quit.</v>

1435
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:11.520
<v Speaker 4>I says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough's enough.</v>

1436
00:59:11.521 --> 00:59:13.420
<v Speaker 4>We're already ran five miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where do you want it?</v>

1437
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:14.241
<v Speaker 4>This is enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1438
00:59:14.241 --> 00:59:15.860
<v Speaker 4>You ran a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I isn't enough.</v>

1439
00:59:16.070 --> 00:59:17.810
<v Speaker 4>You had two marathons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you sit the fuck down.</v>

1440
00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:19.250
<v Speaker 4>We just sit the fuck down and take a </v>
<v Speaker 4>nap.</v>

1441
00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:22.100
<v Speaker 4>But you have to be able to shut off and </v>
<v Speaker 4>most people</v>

1442
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:23.950
<v Speaker 2>can't shut that off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't,</v>

1443
00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:25.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1444
00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:26.150
<v Speaker 2>it's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1445
00:59:26.151 --> 00:59:27.320
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1446
00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:28.523
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brother was with me on that last one </v>

1447
00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:31.490
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1448
00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:33.590
<v Speaker 2>and it's weird to share,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1449
00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:38.450
<v Speaker 2>an experience like that with somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can be similar,</v>

1450
00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:41.900
<v Speaker 2>but in the course of something at three </v>
<v Speaker 2>days like that,</v>

1451
00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:44.840
<v Speaker 2>you're in low points at different times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1452
00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:45.913
<v Speaker 2>And so it's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to win each of those </v>

1453
00:59:50.331 --> 00:59:52.430
<v Speaker 2>battles because at one time when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might,</v>

1454
00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:53.840
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1455
00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:57.710
<v Speaker 2>it seems like that'd be easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think in,</v>

1456
00:59:57.770 --> 01:00:00.050
<v Speaker 2>in some respects it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1457
01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:01.780
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does,</v>

1458
01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:04.370
<v Speaker 2>it's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was tough all the way around.</v>

1459
01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.130
<v Speaker 2>So when you're going through a three </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

1460
01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:11.770
<v Speaker 2>238 mile run does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1461
01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:17.360
<v Speaker 2>it gets bad at certain times where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just feel like shit and then if you keep</v>

1462
01:00:17.421 --> 01:00:20.900
<v Speaker 2>going it gets better and then it gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad again.</v>

1463
01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it gets better.</v>

1464
01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:23.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're up and down,</v>

1465
01:00:23.511 --> 01:00:25.370
<v Speaker 2>up and down the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1466
01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:29.270
<v Speaker 2>but you know that if you keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even when you feel like dog shit,</v>

1467
01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:33.710
<v Speaker 2>you'll eventually break through and </v>
<v Speaker 2>start feeling okay again.</v>

1468
01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:35.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no guarantee.</v>

1469
01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.380
<v Speaker 2>There's no guarantee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1470
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:37.243
<v Speaker 2>there's no you hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever gone through a whole long </v>

1471
01:00:39.681 --> 01:00:41.660
<v Speaker 2>race and felt like dog shit the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>

1472
01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:43.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which one of those?</v>

1473
01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.890
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well like the 24 hour run,</v>

1474
01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:49.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause that's usually like my first tough</v>

1475
01:00:49.071 --> 01:00:53.090
<v Speaker 2>one of the years in June.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I haven't really prepared for it.</v>

1476
01:00:53.091 --> 01:00:53.924
<v Speaker 2>And now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm always after spring bear and </v>

1477
01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.393
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been training because I've </v>

1478
01:00:58.791 --> 01:00:59.624
<v Speaker 2>been up in bear camp and doing whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's always one where I know I'm </v>

1479
01:01:03.441 --> 01:01:05.450
<v Speaker 2>just pretty much going to be miserable </v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole time.</v>

1480
01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.420
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be no light at the end </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the tunnel,</v>

1481
01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:11.660
<v Speaker 2>other than one of the 24 hours is up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that one,</v>

1482
01:01:11.661 --> 01:01:13.790
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm just going to have to grind </v>
<v Speaker 2>it out.</v>

1483
01:01:13.791 --> 01:01:14.960
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1484
01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:17.960
<v Speaker 2>that's where I'm like [inaudible] it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1485
01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.020
<v Speaker 2>this is one day out of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just do it.</v>

1486
01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:22.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to be miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1487
01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:24.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

1488
01:01:24.261 --> 01:01:27.800
<v Speaker 2>on Moab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one started off and I felt terrible</v>

1489
01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:30.140
<v Speaker 2>right out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I felt,</v>

1490
01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:31.423
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were God don't want to think like 19 </v>

1491
01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:37.310
<v Speaker 2>or maybe 15 miles in something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1492
01:01:37.311 --> 01:01:38.510
<v Speaker 2>An aid station.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's crazy as you were running a </v>

1494
01:01:43.851 --> 01:01:45.650
<v Speaker 2>marathon a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1495
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:48.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why was 15 miles so bad?</v>

1496
01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:50.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

1497
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:51.703
<v Speaker 2>There's sometimes when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you ever go on a run and your legs </v>

1498
01:01:53.341 --> 01:01:55.790

<v Speaker 2>So that's what that,</v>

1500
01:01:58.700 --> 01:01:59.960
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1501
01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.273
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be fresh and I want it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel light on my feet and I want to get </v>

1502
01:02:05.061 --> 01:02:06.980
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1503
01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.950
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good sign when I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

1504
01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:12.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just essentially started the race and</v>

1505
01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:16.250
<v Speaker 2>it was hot and I had run out of water </v>
<v Speaker 2>already one time.</v>

1506
01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:17.563
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1507
01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.400
<v Speaker 2>my legs felt heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was a,</v>

1508
01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:22.593
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't looking good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then courtney was way out ahead and </v>

1509
01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're saying I,</v>

1510
01:02:27.871 --> 01:02:28.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1511
01:02:28.801 --> 01:02:30.660
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really know who she was at that</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1512
01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.790
<v Speaker 2>So we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and my brother Taylor,</v>

1513
01:02:33.110 --> 01:02:36.990
<v Speaker 2>we were thinking we'll 70 in the 70s </v>
<v Speaker 2>would win the race.</v>

1514
01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:38.430
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1515
01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:42.750
<v Speaker 2>I want to go out and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and aim for finishing in the 70s.</v>

1516
01:02:42.751 --> 01:02:44.520
<v Speaker 2>And when you say seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean,</v>

1517
01:02:44.521 --> 01:02:45.510
<v Speaker 2>70 hours?</v>

1518
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:47.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I figured,</v>

1519
01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:48.773
<v Speaker 2>because what usually one big foot was </v>
<v Speaker 2>high sixties in big foot's two oh five </v>

1520
01:02:52.830 --> 01:02:54.150
<v Speaker 2>two oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is,</v>

1521
01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:56.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>close to 35 miles further.</v>

1522
01:02:56.641 --> 01:02:58.230
<v Speaker 2>So we just figured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1523
01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:00.450
<v Speaker 2>probably seventies is going to get it </v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

1524
01:03:01.170 --> 01:03:02.003
<v Speaker 2>And so she went out and she had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an under a couple of other guys </v>

1525
01:03:04.321 --> 01:03:05.190
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I think,</v>

1526
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:07.770
<v Speaker 2>and they went out pretty hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1527
01:03:07.771 --> 01:03:09.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1528
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:12.000
<v Speaker 2>there's updates and where they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't know,</v>

1529
01:03:12.001 --> 01:03:12.834
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know at that time she was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>American record holder for the hundred </v>

1530
01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.153
<v Speaker 2>20 or the 24 hour run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'd run 160 miles I think in 24 hours </v>

1531
01:03:21.741 --> 01:03:25.080
<v Speaker 2>this Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I was like,</v>

1532
01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:27.430
<v Speaker 2>oh well they just went too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1533
01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:31.920
<v Speaker 2>cause I had done that before and like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>big foot the year before and I thought,</v>

1534
01:03:31.921 --> 01:03:33.450
<v Speaker 2>well they'll come back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1535
01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:36.180
<v Speaker 2>so meaning it'll balance out.</v>

1536
01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.700
<v Speaker 2>We'd catch up or they come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1537
01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:39.803
<v Speaker 2>I think the guys with her ended up </v>
<v Speaker 2>dropping off a little bit and then she </v>

1538
01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:44.280
<v Speaker 2>never came back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She just,</v>

1539
01:03:44.330 --> 01:03:46.740
<v Speaker 2>well one of them dropped out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally tried to keep up with her and he</v>

1540
01:03:46.741 --> 01:03:48.210
<v Speaker 2>couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he wound up dropping out.</v>

1541
01:03:48.211 --> 01:03:49.044
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a monster and she's eating Nachos </v>

1542
01:03:51.301 --> 01:03:52.620
<v Speaker 2>and candy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was crazy.</v>

1543
01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:53.820
<v Speaker 2>Drinking beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1544
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.983
<v Speaker 2>all these people are on like all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>diets watching their macro nutrients </v>

1545
01:03:58.321 --> 01:03:58.711
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1546
01:03:58.711 --> 01:04:00.500
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't want to say that is cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1547
01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:05.130
<v Speaker 2>cause I listened to you talk to her </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that and excuse me,</v>

1548
01:04:05.131 --> 01:04:09.720
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a lot of comments about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what you got to keep in mind is the,</v>

1549
01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.030
<v Speaker 2>her training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't say,</v>

1550
01:04:12.031 --> 01:04:15.420
<v Speaker 2>well I run 15 miles a week and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to eat Nachos and beer.</v>

1551
01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's running 120 miles a week.</v>

1552
01:04:19.170 --> 01:04:21.750
<v Speaker 2>Probably you can eat pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want.</v>

1553
01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.333
<v Speaker 2>So I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also like I was asking her </v>

1554
01:04:25.711 --> 01:04:29.040
<v Speaker 2>about like the nutritional content of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our food.</v>

1555
01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.233
<v Speaker 2>You really monitoring how much protein </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get versus Fido nutrients and </v>

1556
01:04:33.931 --> 01:04:36.000
<v Speaker 2>minerals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1557
01:04:36.001 --> 01:04:37.500
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's gotten it out.</v>

1558
01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.630
<v Speaker 2>She probably just needs calories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1559
01:04:39.631 --> 01:04:40.710
<v Speaker 2>she just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

1560
01:04:40.711 --> 01:04:43.470
<v Speaker 2>It didn't matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how she gets them just needs calories to</v>

1561
01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:45.540
<v Speaker 2>sustain herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just think for just a,</v>

1562
01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:48.570
<v Speaker 2>the cells of your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would need more nutrients.</v>

1563
01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:51.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's obviously a fucking savage.</v>

1564
01:04:51.350 --> 01:04:52.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But who knows if she really monitored </v>

1565
01:04:54.691 --> 01:04:58.800
<v Speaker 2>her diet and ate super healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she might be better maybe,</v>

1566
01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:01.290
<v Speaker 2>which is just terrifying maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1567
01:05:01.291 --> 01:05:02.640
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's amazing.</v>

1568
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:06.030
<v Speaker 2>She's so normal to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hang out with her.</v>

1569
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:08.960
<v Speaker 2>Like when she did the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's just fun and laugh and look,</v>

1570
01:05:08.961 --> 01:05:13.920
<v Speaker 2>you would never imagine that Jesus like </v>
<v Speaker 2>elite ultra marathon runner,</v>

1571
01:05:13.921 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 2>I would think you'd have to be like </v>
<v Speaker 2>super stoic and intense and just,</v>

1572
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:21.520
<v Speaker 2>and when you see her she's wearing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like basketball shorts.</v>

1573
01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:22.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1574
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:23.441
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1575
01:05:23.441 --> 01:05:25.420
<v Speaker 2>Shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>

1576
01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:28.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see some of these track athletes and</v>

1577
01:05:28.331 --> 01:05:31.240
<v Speaker 2>they got the tight little shorts on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1578
01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.390
<v Speaker 2>and the singlet and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1579
01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:35.623
<v Speaker 2>she does like it with a kind of a baggy </v>
<v Speaker 2>shirt and baggy shorts and then just </v>

1580
01:05:39.311 --> 01:05:40.840
<v Speaker 2>crushing people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

1581
01:05:40.930 --> 01:05:41.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

1582
01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:44.200
<v Speaker 2>but I love that though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love outliers.</v>

1583
01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.510
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people that come along with </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't make any sense.</v>

1584
01:05:46.511 --> 01:05:47.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

1585
01:05:47.531 --> 01:05:50.110
<v Speaker 2>Like did she so much better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody else?</v>

1586
01:05:50.290 --> 01:05:55.290
<v Speaker 2>She won that 238 mile race by 22 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1587
01:05:56.951 --> 01:05:57.784
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>22 miles ahead of the second place </v>

1588
01:05:59.621 --> 01:06:00.454
<v Speaker 2>winner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy who got second is this done </v>

1589
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:07.480
<v Speaker 2>fucking animal has done as an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was 22 miles ahead of him.</v>

1590
01:06:07.481 --> 01:06:10.540
<v Speaker 2>Now imagine get whupped not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>whooped,</v>

1591
01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:11.583

<v Speaker 2>eating Nachos and drink beer and eat </v>

1592
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:16.063
<v Speaker 2>candy.</v>

1593
01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:18.723
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love someone that doesn't make any </v>

1594
01:06:20.051 --> 01:06:21.850
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is just so much better.</v>

1595
01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:23.260
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1596
01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.393
<v Speaker 2>we got to fucking throw the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw a monkey wrench into this whole </v>

1597
01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:27.274
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing I got on anybody is can </v>

1598
01:06:29.351 --> 01:06:31.260
<v Speaker 2>they pack out an elk there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to,</v>

1599
01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:32.820
<v Speaker 2>you got to sit on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1600
01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:35.050
<v Speaker 2>if that was the race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd fuck them all up.</v>

1601
01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:39.070
<v Speaker 2>But what I like about her also is I flew</v>
<v Speaker 2>home the other day,</v>

1602
01:06:39.071 --> 01:06:44.020
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember where it was from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I flew over like there's some in the</v>

1603
01:06:44.050 --> 01:06:46.450
<v Speaker 2>cascades of Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a middle sister,</v>

1604
01:06:46.451 --> 01:06:47.800
<v Speaker 2>north sister,</v>
<v Speaker 2>south sister,</v>

1605
01:06:47.801 --> 01:06:48.634
<v Speaker 2>and then bachelor's where everybody goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and skis and then broken tops right </v>

1606
01:06:50.951 --> 01:06:52.300
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I filmed it and I'm like,</v>

1607
01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:55.240
<v Speaker 2>I tagged my brother Taylor and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1608
01:06:55.241 --> 01:06:58.690
<v Speaker 2>can we knock off all five of these peaks</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 24 hours?</v>

1609
01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:01.090
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it would be,</v>

1610
01:07:01.690 --> 01:07:02.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be a test,</v>

1611
01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:06.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she commented and said she wants to,</v>

1612
01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:08.770
<v Speaker 2>she joined us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she wants to come do it.</v>

1613
01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:10.720
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just love that.</v>

1614
01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:11.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even,</v>

1615
01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:14.290
<v Speaker 2>she's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's amazing.</v>

1616
01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:17.110
<v Speaker 2>But that type of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1617
01:07:17.111 --> 01:07:20.170
<v Speaker 2>I guess I kind of goes hand in hand with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the eating.</v>

1618
01:07:20.171 --> 01:07:22.360
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you want is also doing whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want.</v>

1619
01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:25.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of these elite athletes,</v>

1620
01:07:25.061 --> 01:07:26.230
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would be like,</v>

1621
01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:29.950
<v Speaker 2>have a schedule of races and my training</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this and that and I,</v>

1622
01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:31.043
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1623
01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:34.060
<v Speaker 2>I like that she's would just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1624
01:07:34.061 --> 01:07:35.170
<v Speaker 2>I'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1625
01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.290
<v Speaker 2>It's not a race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just we're just having fun.</v>

1626
01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:39.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or just a test.</v>

1627
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:42.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an unofficial test and to,</v>

1628
01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:43.023
<v Speaker 2>for her to want to join in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably what I love the most </v>

1629
01:07:45.581 --> 01:07:46.414
<v Speaker 2>about her and I are there established </v>
<v Speaker 2>trails that you guys could run over all </v>

1630
01:07:49.151 --> 01:07:49.790
<v Speaker 2>those peaks.</v>

1631
01:07:49.790 --> 01:07:50.623
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did the south sister in the middle </v>

1632
01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:57.880
<v Speaker 2>sister last year and now it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting off the south sister towards the</v>

1633
01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.530
<v Speaker 2>middle sister is sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1634
01:07:59.531 --> 01:08:00.850
<v Speaker 2>there's no trails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1635
01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:02.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you just run it through the woods?</v>

1636
01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:04.900
<v Speaker 2>It's on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no trees.</v>

1637
01:08:04.901 --> 01:08:07.670
<v Speaker 2>It's all inside of a mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a shale and oh,</v>

1638
01:08:07.810 --> 01:08:09.250
<v Speaker 2>even more sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1639
01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.113
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather run over trees yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of now you would because you know </v>

1640
01:08:13.991 --> 01:08:15.680
<v Speaker 2>if there's trees are there solid ground </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1641
01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:16.551
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1642
01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:18.470
<v Speaker 2>so with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the rocks up there,</v>

1643
01:08:18.471 --> 01:08:21.350
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to be stepping over shit.</v>

1644
01:08:21.351 --> 01:08:22.184
<v Speaker 2>If there's trees there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might want it to a bunch of places </v>

1645
01:08:23.931 --> 01:08:26.360
<v Speaker 2>where all the trees have fallen down </v>
<v Speaker 2>generally.</v>

1646
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there can be a windfall in there,</v>

1647
01:08:28.881 --> 01:08:33.350
<v Speaker 2>but generally you can get on animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>trail and find your way through,</v>

1648
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:36.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it's just rocks,</v>

1649
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:38.510
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably the most sketchy cause.</v>

1650
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause just because there's a,</v>

1651
01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1652
01:08:42.261 --> 01:08:43.094
<v Speaker 2>a thousand pound rock sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could just just be balanced </v>

1653
01:08:46.851 --> 01:08:48.740
<v Speaker 2>perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might step on it.</v>

1654
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:49.783
<v Speaker 2>That could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no guarantee that those rocks </v>

1655
01:08:50.931 --> 01:08:52.310
<v Speaker 2>are staying there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1656
01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:53.233
<v Speaker 2>falls all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's with rocks and that type of </v>

1657
01:08:56.241 --> 01:08:57.680
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super steep.</v>

1658
01:08:57.830 --> 01:08:59.810
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as part of it,</v>

1659
01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:03.020
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating to me that that is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>appeal of sheep hunting too,</v>

1660
01:09:03.021 --> 01:09:03.854
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people is that it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly dangerous that being up in </v>

1661
01:09:06.381 --> 01:09:10.670
<v Speaker 2>those high peaks and stepping on shale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like on these,</v>

1662
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:14.370
<v Speaker 2>these crazy peaks where to the left is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just a,</v>

1663
01:09:14.371 --> 01:09:15.204
<v Speaker 2>a steep drop off to the right is a steep</v>
<v Speaker 2>drop off and you have a very narrow </v>

1664
01:09:18.111 --> 01:09:20.570
<v Speaker 2>place to navigate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1665
01:09:20.571 --> 01:09:22.370
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1666
01:09:22.371 --> 01:09:23.204
<v Speaker 2>she punning they say it's not the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the animal that's the most </v>

1667
01:09:27.951 --> 01:09:28.620
<v Speaker 2>wary.</v>

1668
01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:32.180
<v Speaker 2>It's just the country that makes it so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1669
01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:35.800
<v Speaker 2>they're expensive that the hunts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just what they did to that.</v>

1670
01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:39.150
<v Speaker 2>It's just where they live is the draw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1671
01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:41.970
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with the bow,</v>

1672
01:09:41.971 --> 01:09:46.670
<v Speaker 2>definitely a tough animal with a rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mostly it's just kind of getting in.</v>

1673
01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:49.550
<v Speaker 2>If you can get your body within a range,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1674
01:09:49.551 --> 01:09:51.610
<v Speaker 2>you can usually get one done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

1675
01:09:51.611 --> 01:09:53.240
<v Speaker 2>it's just where they live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1676
01:09:53.241 --> 01:09:54.040
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1677
01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:57.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben O'Brien and a green tree,</v>

1678
01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:59.630
<v Speaker 2>we're hunting tar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1679
01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:00.533
<v Speaker 2>Similar thing New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then these crazy peaks and super </v>

1680
01:10:04.731 --> 01:10:05.564
<v Speaker 2>dangerous sketchy territory and people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating to me how people get </v>

1681
01:10:09.531 --> 01:10:12.680
<v Speaker 2>addicted to incredibly difficult things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do it.</v>

1682
01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:13.611
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1683
01:10:13.611 --> 01:10:15.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm never doing this again because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

1684
01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:17.540
<v Speaker 2>And then they get back in a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks later,</v>

1685
01:10:17.541 --> 01:10:18.071
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

1686
01:10:18.071 --> 01:10:20.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1687
01:10:20.211 --> 01:10:22.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a god.</v>

1688
01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:22.993
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what type of analogy to </v>

1689
01:10:24.621 --> 01:10:25.760
<v Speaker 2>make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1690
01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:26.773
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

1691
01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:30.830
<v Speaker 2>when you've done say maybe ultras are </v>
<v Speaker 2>marathons,</v>

1692
01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:32.930
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard to get excited for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>five k,</v>

1693
01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.870
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you do your key Pam and five k,</v>

1694
01:10:35.871 --> 01:10:38.290
<v Speaker 2>how boring is that for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1695
01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:39.293
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me this is more about the people </v>

1696
01:10:40.311 --> 01:10:41.270
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1697
01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:45.010
<v Speaker 2>It's not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that stupid.</v>

1698
01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.670
<v Speaker 2>Race is the reason why I got started </v>
<v Speaker 2>running.</v>

1699
01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:51.920
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe how hard it was to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>with zero running folks.</v>

1700
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ran zero and then I ran a five k.</v>

1701
01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the end of that I was like,</v>

1702
01:10:56.271 --> 01:10:58.820
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta start running shit.</v>

1703
01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it feels great now,</v>

1704
01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:01.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes it does.</v>

1705
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.823
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing that feels better to me than </v>

1706
01:11:04.551 --> 01:11:06.290
<v Speaker 2>being older run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1707
01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.020
<v Speaker 2>you know what's crazy is my endurance </v>
<v Speaker 2>for kickboxing is way better.</v>

1708
01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean way better.</v>

1709
01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:11.533
<v Speaker 2>Way Better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I could do a hard three minute </v>

1710
01:11:13.591 --> 01:11:14.370
<v Speaker 2>round.</v>

1711
01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.560
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1712
01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:18.940
<v Speaker 3>And it's just from running these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>hills changes your lung capacity.</v>

1713
01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:21.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your lungs just expand and then contract</v>

1714
01:11:21.751 --> 01:11:24.630
<v Speaker 3>and you just used to get any more oxygen</v>
<v Speaker 3>in there,</v>

1715
01:11:24.631 --> 01:11:25.580
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1716
01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:26.573
<v Speaker 3>Well still it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've seen those trails that I'm </v>

1717
01:11:27.781 --> 01:11:28.620
<v Speaker 3>running on to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>

1718
01:11:28.621 --> 01:11:31.620
<v Speaker 3>they're so steep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so much of it is just pushing,</v>

1719
01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:32.431
<v Speaker 3>pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing,</v>

1720
01:11:32.431 --> 01:11:33.264
<v Speaker 3>pushing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're sprinting up these </v>

1721
01:11:34.321 --> 01:11:37.740
<v Speaker 3>hills and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body's just used to those bursts,</v>

1722
01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:38.723
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so now when I go crazy on the heavy </v>

1723
01:11:41.101 --> 01:11:42.680
<v Speaker 3>bag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I buy,</v>

1724
01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:42.961
<v Speaker 3>buy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buy,</v>

1725
01:11:42.961 --> 01:11:43.530
<v Speaker 3>buy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

1726
01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:44.940
<v Speaker 3>And then the bell would go off and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1727
01:11:45.250 --> 01:11:46.830
<v Speaker 3>oh good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1728
01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:49.020
<v Speaker 3>Like it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1729
01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:51.690
<v Speaker 3>and it does so much for your legs to Oh </v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1730
01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:53.550
<v Speaker 3>People always ask me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1731
01:11:53.551 --> 01:11:56.550
<v Speaker 3>what I do for legs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like I just run mountains.</v>

1732
01:11:56.850 --> 01:11:57.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

1733
01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:58.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1734
01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:01.170
<v Speaker 3>There was a famous kickboxer from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Montreal,</v>

1735
01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:02.063
<v Speaker 3>his name was John Eve terrio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like the most scary kickboxer in </v>

1736
01:12:05.491 --> 01:12:09.150
<v Speaker 3>the world in the PKA karate days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1737
01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:12.080
<v Speaker 3>all he did was he would run stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that was the,</v>

1738
01:12:12.081 --> 01:12:16.650
<v Speaker 3>the big workout that he ran.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wrote a book on training and uh,</v>

1739
01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:18.900
<v Speaker 3>you know what it takes to be a world </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion.</v>

1740
01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:21.270
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that he's saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>is you got to run stairs.</v>

1741
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:23.180
<v Speaker 3>He's like running stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1742
01:12:23.181 --> 01:12:26.100
<v Speaker 3>have been the best thing for his kicking</v>
<v Speaker 3>power for his endurance,</v>

1743
01:12:26.101 --> 01:12:27.690
<v Speaker 3>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember thinking that.</v>

1744
01:12:27.691 --> 01:12:31.190
<v Speaker 3>And you're just talking about how just </v>
<v Speaker 3>put inches on his thighs and it's just,</v>

1745
01:12:31.191 --> 01:12:34.980
<v Speaker 3>it radically increased his lung capacity</v>
<v Speaker 3>and kicking power.</v>

1746
01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.530
<v Speaker 3>Speaking of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1747
01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:39.570
<v Speaker 3>endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno if we were,</v>

1748
01:12:39.571 --> 01:12:42.740
<v Speaker 3>but I will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Francis and Ghana,</v>

1749
01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:45.330
<v Speaker 3>he got gassed out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did well.</v>

1750
01:12:45.330 --> 01:12:47.820
<v Speaker 3>He tried to take steep pay out in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first round.</v>

1751
01:12:47.850 --> 01:12:48.780
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was his,</v>

1752
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:51.400
<v Speaker 3>his thought was that steep pace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to be a survivor.</v>

1753
01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:52.560
<v Speaker 3>Didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>

1754
01:12:52.561 --> 01:12:53.370
<v Speaker 3>It's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1755
01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:54.780
<v Speaker 3>And he doesn't know how to wrestle that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

1756
01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:58.320
<v Speaker 3>He's doesn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't have a long background in,</v>

1757
01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:00.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in martial arts at all.</v>

1758
01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:01.133
<v Speaker 3>And Steve Bay was a very good college </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestler and obviously a bad </v>

1759
01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:05.320
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1760
01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:08.100
<v Speaker 3>he took some hard shots to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did.</v>

1761
01:13:08.130 --> 01:13:09.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing about Steve paid.</v>

1762
01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:12.330
<v Speaker 3>It's not just that he knows how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>

1763
01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:15.360
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just fucking tough.</v>

1764
01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:17.790
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of shit going on there.</v>

1765
01:13:17.791 --> 01:13:18.624
<v Speaker 3>It's experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just sheer toughness and grit and </v>

1766
01:13:21.151 --> 01:13:23.730
<v Speaker 3>determination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he also,</v>

1767
01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:27.840
<v Speaker 3>he knows how to ride out bad moments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Francis had never had a bad moment.</v>

1768
01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:29.610
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't know what the fuck to do.</v>

1769
01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:31.730
<v Speaker 3>I think most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you,</v>

1770
01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:33.450
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't,</v>

1771
01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.640
<v Speaker 3>but I think most people had kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>assumed,</v>

1772
01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.320
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frances is gonna win this fight.</v>

1773
01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.660
<v Speaker 3>I thought it's very possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Francis could win.</v>

1774
01:13:39.661 --> 01:13:40.494
<v Speaker 3>The fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was very possible that </v>

1775
01:13:41.341 --> 01:13:43.770
<v Speaker 3>Francis could just newcomb in the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>round.</v>

1776
01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.380
<v Speaker 3>He's just so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1777
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just takes one.</v>

1778
01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:47.423
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen anyone in all of my </v>

1779
01:13:50.071 --> 01:13:54.060
<v Speaker 3>history of watching mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so terrifying with one punch.</v>

1780
01:13:54.061 --> 01:13:54.894
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1781
01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:57.370
<v Speaker 3>And he's just punching to this kicks or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1782
01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:58.910
<v Speaker 3>they're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not,</v>

1783
01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:00.750
<v Speaker 3>but he's not like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1784
01:14:00.751 --> 01:14:03.870
<v Speaker 3>he's not Edson Barboza or someone who </v>
<v Speaker 3>could put you to sleep with one kick.</v>

1785
01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:04.883
<v Speaker 3>He's not kicking people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just moving towards you throwing a </v>

1786
01:14:07.021 --> 01:14:07.854
<v Speaker 3>few kicks maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what he's trying to do is hit you </v>

1787
01:14:09.991 --> 01:14:14.390
<v Speaker 3>with those giant fucking canned hams </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he calls his fists.</v>

1788
01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:18.520
<v Speaker 3>And even when he was so gassed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could barely do anything.</v>

1789
01:14:18.521 --> 01:14:22.270
<v Speaker 3>I was taking up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just taste still one big tired heavy arm</v>

1790
01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:23.830
<v Speaker 3>could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1791
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:29.310
<v Speaker 3>100% that guy still has unbelievable </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential if he could get it together.</v>

1792
01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.980
<v Speaker 3>But when he needs to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is critical,</v>

1793
01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:34.623
<v Speaker 3>he needs to work on his ground game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>needs to work on his wrestling and he </v>

1794
01:14:36.851 --> 01:14:41.851
<v Speaker 3>needs to be with a real top flight mma </v>
<v Speaker 3>camp who's trains him now he trains with</v>

1795
01:14:44.381 --> 01:14:46.090
<v Speaker 3>the guy who found him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1796
01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:48.800
<v Speaker 3>I forgot the gentleman's name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1797
01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:52.960
<v Speaker 3>the guy's done an amazing job of </v>
<v Speaker 3>building his skills up and you know,</v>

1798
01:14:52.961 --> 01:14:53.794
<v Speaker 3>in five years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is Frances is so goddamn </v>

1799
01:14:56.470 --> 01:15:00.220
<v Speaker 3>good that most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he spars with most people,</v>

1800
01:15:00.221 --> 01:15:01.054
<v Speaker 3>he fights with our fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when buddy runs the top of the food </v>

1801
01:15:04.781 --> 01:15:05.614
<v Speaker 3>chain and got like Steve Bay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve Bay can avoid all the dangerous </v>

1802
01:15:08.471 --> 01:15:10.390
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drag them into deep water,</v>

1803
01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:12.250
<v Speaker 3>get his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get him diminished,</v>

1804
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:15.670
<v Speaker 3>diminishes his endurance and his ability</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then overwhelm them,</v>

1805
01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:16.780
<v Speaker 3>which is what Steve Bay did.</v>

1806
01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:20.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Francis can learn from that.</v>

1807
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:21.183
<v Speaker 3>He can learn from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can learn from that and he can get </v>

1808
01:15:22.841 --> 01:15:25.230
<v Speaker 3>better at all those areas that he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems with.</v>

1809
01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:26.680
<v Speaker 3>Tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1810
01:15:26.770 --> 01:15:29.050
<v Speaker 3>But he can get the endurance is </v>
<v Speaker 3>something you can work on.</v>

1811
01:15:29.051 --> 01:15:31.270
<v Speaker 3>You can work on all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know how.</v>

1812
01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:33.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he worked hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm absolutely sure,</v>

1813
01:15:34.150 --> 01:15:34.983
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know how hard he was pushed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a difference between working </v>

1814
01:15:37.661 --> 01:15:39.430
<v Speaker 3>hard and being pushed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1815
01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:40.413
<v Speaker 3>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he's trained with a guy like Cain </v>

1816
01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:43.053
<v Speaker 3>Velasquez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

1817
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:44.530
<v Speaker 3>prime time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cain Velasquez,</v>

1818
01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:47.770
<v Speaker 3>if keynes in his prime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kate's taking him down left and right,</v>

1819
01:15:47.771 --> 01:15:49.360
<v Speaker 3>he's going to try to have to get up all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

1820
01:15:49.361 --> 01:15:52.090
<v Speaker 3>He's doing rounds of cane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going through how you get through</v>

1821
01:15:52.091 --> 01:15:55.360
<v Speaker 3>five minutes of hell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when that bell goes off to it to end</v>

1822
01:15:55.361 --> 01:15:57.040
<v Speaker 3>the five minutes of hell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just like,</v>

1823
01:15:57.041 --> 01:15:58.180
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

1824
01:15:58.200 --> 01:15:58.781
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1825
01:15:58.781 --> 01:15:59.650
<v Speaker 3>you've watched the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1826
01:15:59.690 --> 01:16:04.620
<v Speaker 3>the training camps with Daniel Cormier </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Luke rockhold and Cain Velasquez,</v>

1827
01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:05.463
<v Speaker 3>some of the footage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason why those guys are so </v>

1828
01:16:07.211 --> 01:16:10.000
<v Speaker 3>God damn good because iron sharpens </v>
<v Speaker 3>iron.</v>

1829
01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:10.863
<v Speaker 3>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys are in their world champions </v>

1830
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:15.880
<v Speaker 3>going at it with each other on a daily </v>
<v Speaker 3>basis and because of that,</v>

1831
01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:21.120
<v Speaker 3>that's what turned them into those </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking monsters they are today.</v>

1832
01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frances is just a physical freak.</v>

1833
01:16:24.190 --> 01:16:26.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if he was in that camp,</v>

1834
01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:28.480
<v Speaker 3>whole leash shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1835
01:16:28.481 --> 01:16:29.820
<v Speaker 3>that'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be amazing.</v>

1836
01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.780
<v Speaker 3>It'd be amazing to see what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he could do.</v>

1837
01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:32.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1838
01:16:32.710 --> 01:16:35.260
<v Speaker 3>The problem is sparring with that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're,</v>

1839
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:38.650
<v Speaker 3>if Francis spars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they spar because dcs,</v>

1840
01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:39.990
<v Speaker 3>they go hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't go.</v>

1841
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:42.820
<v Speaker 3>They go a little hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that kind of maybe too hard?</v>

1842
01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:45.610
<v Speaker 3>That's the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just two arguments.</v>

1843
01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:46.473
<v Speaker 3>There's one argument is that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going through that is why they're so </v>

1844
01:16:49.241 --> 01:16:52.730
<v Speaker 3>successful in world championship fights </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they know what to buy.</v>

1845
01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:54.850
<v Speaker 3>They know what the fire feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1846
01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:58.500
<v Speaker 3>The other thing is that they're also </v>
<v Speaker 3>increase their,</v>

1847
01:16:58.510 --> 01:16:59.840
<v Speaker 3>they get injured a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1848
01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:02.260
<v Speaker 3>That camp gets injured a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also,</v>

1849
01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:05.140
<v Speaker 3>there are so fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who could,</v>

1850
01:17:05.141 --> 01:17:05.974
<v Speaker 3>they got hubby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've never come at off Luke rockhold </v>

1851
01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:10.270
<v Speaker 3>Daniel Cormier Day</v>

1852
01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:11.780
<v Speaker 5>cane,</v>
<v Speaker 5>motherfucking Velasquez.</v>

1853
01:17:11.781 --> 01:17:12.614
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't argue with that one camp in </v>

1854
01:17:14.661 --> 01:17:17.180
<v Speaker 5>San Jose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's because some of the best fighters</v>

1855
01:17:17.181 --> 01:17:19.910
<v Speaker 5>that have ever done the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then on top of that,</v>

1856
01:17:19.911 --> 01:17:21.470
<v Speaker 5>Josh Thompson,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1857
01:17:21.471 --> 01:17:24.380
<v Speaker 5>they had Josh Koscheck for a while and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he was at the top of his game.</v>

1858
01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:29.720
<v Speaker 5>Some fucking killers have come from Aka,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you could look at it two ways.</v>

1859
01:17:29.721 --> 01:17:30.554
<v Speaker 5>You could say one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're beating each other up too much </v>

1860
01:17:32.151 --> 01:17:34.070
<v Speaker 5>or too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what you gotta do.</v>

1861
01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:37.340
<v Speaker 5>You gotta do to be a world champion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's uh,</v>

1862
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:39.020
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1863
01:17:39.230 --> 01:17:41.750
<v Speaker 5>I was still to this day when Kane was in</v>
<v Speaker 5>his prime,</v>

1864
01:17:41.751 --> 01:17:43.810
<v Speaker 5>I never saw a heavyweight like that </v>
<v Speaker 5>before ever.</v>

1865
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.640
<v Speaker 5>The fucking endurance that guy had was </v>
<v Speaker 5>off the charts.</v>

1866
01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:47.913
<v Speaker 5>It's not like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would see guys just should be </v>

1867
01:17:49.730 --> 01:17:50.563
<v Speaker 5>overwhelmed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They couldn't imagine how the fuck he </v>

1868
01:17:52.671 --> 01:17:53.504
<v Speaker 5>could do this.</v>

1869
01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:54.433
<v Speaker 5>Like where's he getting his second round</v>
<v Speaker 5>would come around and have this look on </v>

1870
01:17:56.881 --> 01:17:59.150
<v Speaker 5>their face and cain would just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you just woke up.</v>

1871
01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.880
<v Speaker 5>Like he's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's not even starting to really sweat.</v>

1872

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Beat the shit out him for the second </v>

1873

<v Speaker 5>they would just wilt under the pressure.</v>

1875
01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:09.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see those fights where,</v>

1876
01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:11.000
<v Speaker 5>I mean not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not him,</v>

1877
01:18:11.001 --> 01:18:12.970
<v Speaker 5>but I mean even now or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1878

<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1883
01:18:25.371 --> 01:18:26.204
<v Speaker 5>can this fight get over?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because they should have stopped that </v>

1884
01:18:27.831 --> 01:18:30.110
<v Speaker 5>fight a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Moodle.</v>

1885
01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:32.870

<v Speaker 5>times.</v>

1886
01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:34.910

01:18:37.881 --> 01:18:39.380
<v Speaker 5>opportunity to be a warrior.</v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1926
01:20:19.591 --> 01:20:21.960
<v Speaker 3>there's not a lot of women that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw down like that.</v>

1927
01:20:21.961 --> 01:20:22.794
<v Speaker 3>And I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Valentino is one of the most well </v>

01:20:24.271 --> 01:20:25.580
<v Speaker 3>rounded women in the sport.</v>

<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>She went toe to toe with some of the </v>

1933
01:20:38.791 --> 01:20:41.100
<v Speaker 3>best kick boxers in the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a world champion,</v>

1934
01:20:41.101 --> 01:20:43.850
<v Speaker 3>Moy Thai fighter,</v>

1935
01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:48.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All around just bad bad ass fighter.</v>

1936
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:50.850
<v Speaker 3>There was an argument that she won that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1937
01:20:51.210 --> 01:20:54.630
<v Speaker 3>for the championship against doing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>super close fight.</v>

1938
01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:57.660
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think it was a bad decision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I thought it was a,</v>

1939
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:58.830
<v Speaker 3>it was a very close fight.</v>

1940
01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:00.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard,</v>

1941
01:21:00.061 --> 01:21:00.894
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's hard for me calling fights </v>

1942
01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:06.360
<v Speaker 3>because of I'm calling them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just looking at what's happening.</v>

1943
01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:08.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not scoring it,</v>

1944
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:10.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't score it.</v>

1945
01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:11.613
<v Speaker 3>Score it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta keep your mouth shut and you </v>

1946
01:21:12.511 --> 01:21:14.400
<v Speaker 3>should have a piece of paper in front of</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1947
01:21:14.730 --> 01:21:16.650
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Bravo used to do it.</v>

1948
01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:17.730
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the UFC,</v>

1949
01:21:17.731 --> 01:21:21.030
<v Speaker 3>he used to score in between rounds and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a great system where he would put</v>

1950
01:21:21.031 --> 01:21:21.864
<v Speaker 3>a line down the center of a paper and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be like one opponent on the left </v>

1951
01:21:25.711 --> 01:21:27.600
<v Speaker 3>side and the other one on the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>

1952
01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:28.673
<v Speaker 3>And then he would write down like kicks </v>
<v Speaker 3>takedowns submission attempts and all </v>

1953
01:21:32.821 --> 01:21:33.990
<v Speaker 3>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then defense,</v>

1954
01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:37.580
<v Speaker 3>those are little categories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they would put checkmarks Hash marks</v>

1955
01:21:37.581 --> 01:21:38.340
<v Speaker 3>to one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1956
01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:39.173
<v Speaker 3>And then he would go over why he thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone won and what kind of score he </v>

1957
01:21:42.461 --> 01:21:42.570
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>

1958
01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:43.403
<v Speaker 3>He had a very good system and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the only way to fairly judge a </v>

1959
01:21:47.911 --> 01:21:48.691
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1960
01:21:48.691 --> 01:21:49.524
<v Speaker 3>When your class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like Valentino Shift Gencos fight </v>

1961
01:21:52.111 --> 01:21:53.640
<v Speaker 3>where you just go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

1962
01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:57.060
<v Speaker 3>I gave her like 10 to two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was,</v>

1963
01:21:57.061 --> 01:21:59.760
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't so overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1964
01:21:59.761 --> 01:22:00.151
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 10,</v>

1965
01:22:00.151 --> 01:22:02.070
<v Speaker 3>eight round is a disgrace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a 10,</v>

1966
01:22:02.071 --> 01:22:03.840
<v Speaker 3>six or if you gave it just a 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

1967
01:22:03.841 --> 01:22:04.980
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck are you?</v>

1968
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:06.720
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>judge you God,</v>

1969
01:22:06.721 --> 01:22:08.220
<v Speaker 3>that was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1970
01:22:08.370 --> 01:22:09.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1971
01:22:09.690 --> 01:22:10.411
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1972
01:22:10.411 --> 01:22:11.244
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a bad matchup because that girl </v>

1973
01:22:13.291 --> 01:22:15.780
<v Speaker 3>was there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that was her ufc debut.</v>

1974
01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:16.763
<v Speaker 3>So to have a UFC debut against a woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>who has fought for the title against a </v>

1975
01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:21.743
<v Speaker 3>world class striker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean literally one of the very best </v>

1976
01:22:25.411 --> 01:22:30.040
<v Speaker 3>strikers on the planet earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>male or female and just on,</v>

1977
01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:31.073
<v Speaker 3>it's not fair.</v>

1978
01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:33.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was her first fight at one 25,</v>

1979
01:22:33.241 --> 01:22:34.440
<v Speaker 3>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Valentina's yes.</v>

1980
01:22:34.441 --> 01:22:35.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1981
01:22:35.130 --> 01:22:35.791
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1982
01:22:35.791 --> 01:22:37.460
<v Speaker 3>Valentine fought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1983
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:40.440
<v Speaker 3>you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and Jay check in Moitai Thai and uh,</v>

1984
01:22:40.441 --> 01:22:42.580
<v Speaker 3>so she beat her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1985
01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:44.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1986
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:49.710
<v Speaker 3>I think they fought more than once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I believe Valentino beater.</v>

1987
01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:53.250
<v Speaker 3>I hope I'm not wrong because I'm around </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot.</v>

1988
01:22:53.850 --> 01:22:55.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm excited for that arose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1989
01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:58.260
<v Speaker 3>now in unison you want to and Jay check </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you met.</v>

1990
01:22:58.270 --> 01:22:58.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1991
01:22:58.891 --> 01:23:01.260
<v Speaker 3>you know rose trains with Valentino.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1992
01:23:01.290 --> 01:23:02.520
<v Speaker 3>that's her main sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1993
01:23:02.521 --> 01:23:03.354
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1994
01:23:03.570 --> 01:23:04.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good camp.</v>

1995
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:06.100
<v Speaker 3>Then just those having those</v>

1996
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:09.830
<v Speaker 5>two there dough to work off each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1997
01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:11.860
<v Speaker 5>Phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For rose and for Valentino,</v>

1998
01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:16.540
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be tough for rose to come </v>
<v Speaker 5>now as the champion.</v>

1999
01:23:17.050 --> 01:23:17.883
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'd be interesting to see how if it </v>

2000
01:23:20.351 --> 01:23:23.020
<v Speaker 5>changes at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2001
01:23:23.050 --> 01:23:26.140
<v Speaker 5>It will definitely be interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming into this fight,</v>

2002
01:23:26.190 --> 01:23:27.023
<v Speaker 5>what's fascinating to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though rose one by first round </v>

2003
01:23:28.781 --> 01:23:30.850
<v Speaker 5>knockout,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's the the underdog.</v>

2004
01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:32.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well it's,</v>

2005
01:23:32.650 --> 01:23:37.650
<v Speaker 5>I put up that clip of it when she was </v>
<v Speaker 5>like saying the Lord's prayer there.</v>

2006
01:23:37.781 --> 01:23:41.290
<v Speaker 5>When you're up there in years talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about how it was terrifying or something</v>

2007
01:23:41.291 --> 01:23:42.820
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I put up that little quip.</v>

<v Speaker 5>want to put her fist on her nose.</v>

2020
01:24:14.291 --> 01:24:17.110
<v Speaker 5>And she didn't even flinch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the only one that,</v>

2021

2040
01:25:09.251 --> 01:25:10.084
<v Speaker 5>to him while he was yelling that out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause it was just pure excitement and </v>

<v Speaker 5>appreciation and joy,</v>

2059
01:25:51.671 --> 01:25:54.580
<v Speaker 5>and then landed one big one or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the other way around.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He got some of the best leg kicks I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever seen.</v>

2073
01:26:22.671 --> 01:26:25.490
<v Speaker 3>The heavyweight division.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are,</v>

2074
01:26:25.730 --> 01:26:28.880
<v Speaker 3>those are those lake you into that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>just heard you talk about the other day.</v>

2075
01:26:28.881 --> 01:26:31.400
<v Speaker 3>But those low leg kicks her new thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>nowadays.</v>

2076
01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:34.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well Benson Henderson started doing that</v>

2077
01:26:34.461 --> 01:26:35.294
<v Speaker 3>a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was one of the first guys to </v>

2078
01:26:36.321 --> 01:26:38.690
<v Speaker 3>introduce it to mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2079
01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:41.840
<v Speaker 3>he had some success with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But not like you've seen today.</v>

2080
01:26:41.841 --> 01:26:45.080
<v Speaker 3>Like you're seeing guys getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>debilitated like really quickly.</v>

2081
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:49.460
<v Speaker 3>It must be a new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's a weak spot for on humans,</v>

2082
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:50.570
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2083
01:26:50.571 --> 01:26:51.404
<v Speaker 3>a hard discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their loans that Moitai fighters known </v>

2084
01:26:54.921 --> 01:26:55.754
<v Speaker 3>about forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that MMA fighters are just starting to </v>

2085
01:26:57.291 --> 01:27:00.500
<v Speaker 3>figure out the same as with kickboxing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and karate.</v>

2086
01:27:00.710 --> 01:27:04.100
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of karate moves that MMA </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters don't,</v>

2087
01:27:04.130 --> 01:27:06.960
<v Speaker 3>are not good at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but karate guys are and karate guys come</v>

2088
01:27:06.961 --> 01:27:09.110
<v Speaker 3>into mma like Steven Tompkins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uhs,</v>

2089
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:11.090
<v Speaker 3>Thompson Thompson's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderboy,</v>

2090
01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:12.500
<v Speaker 3>wonderboy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tompkin,</v>

2091
01:27:12.710 --> 01:27:13.543
<v Speaker 3>Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she keeps saying Tompkins cause of Sean </v>

2092
01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:17.660
<v Speaker 3>Tompkins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2093
01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:18.493
<v Speaker 3>but a wonderboy is doing things from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sideways karate stance that a lot of </v>

2094
01:27:24.411 --> 01:27:27.200
<v Speaker 3>people aren't just don't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>handle.</v>

2095
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:28.263
<v Speaker 3>Like wonderboy has these crazy front leg</v>
<v Speaker 3>side kicks in front leg roundhouse </v>

2096
01:27:31.341 --> 01:27:32.174
<v Speaker 3>kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you ever watched his fight with </v>

2097
01:27:33.741 --> 01:27:35.930
<v Speaker 3>a Johnny Hendricks is one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>examples.</v>

2098
01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:38.560
<v Speaker 3>He hits Johnny Hendricks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gut with a sidekick.</v>

2099
01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:40.070
<v Speaker 3>And then Johnny Hendricks cause is still</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2100
01:27:40.071 --> 01:27:43.410
<v Speaker 3>So he roundhouse kicks him in the face </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the same leg and you see Johnny,</v>

2101
01:27:43.411 --> 01:27:44.570
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck?</v>

2102
01:27:45.230 --> 01:27:48.110
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's just something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing to see that and training.</v>

2103
01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:52.900
<v Speaker 3>You don't know a lot of guys that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to get a really good karate guy and</v>

2104
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:54.980
<v Speaker 3>most really good karate guys.</v>

2105
01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:56.720
<v Speaker 3>He's just gonna be able to take them </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

2106
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:58.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2107
01:27:59.450 --> 01:28:04.450
<v Speaker 3>wonderboy is just got that style just </v>
<v Speaker 3>dialed in and nailed and he moves like a</v>

2108
01:28:04.461 --> 01:28:07.510
<v Speaker 3>snake from the waist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he moves backwards from the weight,</v>

2109
01:28:07.511 --> 01:28:09.950
<v Speaker 3>like he gets away from Shit and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>fires back at Ya.</v>

2110
01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:12.170
<v Speaker 3>He looked good and that last fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2111
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:13.800
<v Speaker 3>it gets jorge him on speed dial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2112
01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:14.631
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2113
01:28:14.631 --> 01:28:17.120
<v Speaker 3>So that's a different style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so these,</v>

2114
01:28:17.150 --> 01:28:17.983
<v Speaker 3>these techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's exceptionally good at those </v>

2115
01:28:21.141 --> 01:28:24.320
<v Speaker 3>karate techniques and a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't.</v>

2116
01:28:24.530 --> 01:28:29.060
<v Speaker 3>And so with Moitai most of the time when</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys were learning more time,</v>

2117
01:28:29.061 --> 01:28:32.090
<v Speaker 3>bringing it into mma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were doing a few things.</v>

2118
01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:32.953
<v Speaker 3>They were throwing the leg kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were throwing the knees to the </v>

2119
01:28:34.431 --> 01:28:35.480
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the elbows,</v>

2120
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:37.730
<v Speaker 3>normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>normal Moitai techniques.</v>

2121
01:28:37.970 --> 01:28:39.650
<v Speaker 3>But they're missing some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>subtleties.</v>

2122
01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:40.573
<v Speaker 3>So some of the better Moyie Thai </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters started training with some of </v>

2123
01:28:42.771 --> 01:28:43.604
<v Speaker 3>the better MMA fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then slowly but surely those </v>

2124
01:28:45.291 --> 01:28:46.880
<v Speaker 3>techniques started leaking in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

2125
01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:50.430
<v Speaker 3>And then the big one now is that low </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Kik,</v>

2126
01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:52.860
<v Speaker 3>that low leg kicks motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2127
01:28:52.861 --> 01:28:56.180
<v Speaker 3>it just takes out your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't condition your lower leg.</v>

2128
01:28:56.210 --> 01:28:57.210
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in,</v>

2129
01:28:57.211 --> 01:28:58.580
<v Speaker 3>it feels like it's a weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2130
01:28:58.581 --> 01:29:00.140
<v Speaker 3>cause I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2131
01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:02.190
<v Speaker 3>Michael Chandler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got</v>

2132
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:03.023
<v Speaker 5>caught with that and that's how we lost </v>
<v Speaker 5>the belt and kill the nerves in his </v>

2133
01:29:06.061 --> 01:29:06.780
<v Speaker 5>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>

2134
01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:10.890
<v Speaker 5>it looked like his leg was broke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his ankle is flopping all around.</v>

2135
01:29:10.891 --> 01:29:11.724
<v Speaker 5>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would swear that that leg was broke </v>

2136
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:14.423
<v Speaker 5>and it must've just been those low leg </v>
<v Speaker 5>kicks down there and just deaden the </v>

2137
01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:18.130
<v Speaker 5>nerve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2138
01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:20.700
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>

2139
01:29:20.701 --> 01:29:21.534
<v Speaker 5>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2140
01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:22.910
<v Speaker 5>how many fighter like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2141
01:29:23.010 --> 01:29:24.510
<v Speaker 5>Gilbert Melendez,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2142
01:29:24.511 --> 01:29:25.344
<v Speaker 5>when he fought Jeremy Stevens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jeremy Stephens cracked him real early </v>

2143
01:29:28.621 --> 01:29:29.454
<v Speaker 5>in the first round without low leg kick </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you see it immediately swelling up </v>

2144
01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:34.200
<v Speaker 5>and then Gilbert has fallen down on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He keeps,</v>

2145
01:29:34.201 --> 01:29:35.990
<v Speaker 5>can't stand up on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

2146
01:29:35.991 --> 01:29:38.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Douglas Lema and Rory Macdonald,</v>

01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:43.790
<v Speaker 5>Rory Macdonald in Beltour right into the</v>
<v Speaker 5>same thing right into the lower leg.</v>

2148
01:29:44.190 --> 01:29:45.960
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had a giant Hematoma.</v>

2149
01:29:46.110 --> 01:29:48.260
<v Speaker 5>He was fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2150
01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:50.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a devastating technique.</v>

2151
01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:51.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2152

<v Speaker 5>I just love that.</v>

2154
01:29:53.851 --> 01:29:58.620
<v Speaker 5>I love when new elements get brought </v>
<v Speaker 5>into this very complex sport.</v>

01:31:07.230 --> 01:31:09.390
<v Speaker 5>if it's the same place as last year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's this,</v>

2187
01:31:09.391 --> 01:31:10.170
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Lake Capitol building,</v>

2189
01:31:13.831 --> 01:31:15.690
<v Speaker 5>and then you run a five k from there.</v>

2205
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:48.120
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we were hoping to have,</v>

2206
01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:50.910
<v Speaker 5>kind of want to think we had a few </v>
<v Speaker 5>hundred last year,</v>

<v Speaker 5>so yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Remember El Canyon in Utah?</v>

2213
01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:04.193

<v Speaker 2>We're going to do a podcast when we get </v>

2214

2216
01:32:12.881 --> 01:32:15.100

<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

2217
01:32:16.150 --> 01:32:18.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're hoping to do a podcast when it hit</v>

2218
01:32:18.161 --> 01:32:20.350
<v Speaker 2>500,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it petered out.</v>

2219
01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:24.370
<v Speaker 2>It did petered out at about four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four 71 to 70.</v>

2220
01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:28.150
<v Speaker 2>So we got a thousand today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we just need a few more days.</v>

2221
01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But end of the month.</v>

2222
01:32:31.530 --> 01:32:32.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll cut and close.</v>

2223
01:32:33.190 --> 01:32:35.050
<v Speaker 2>We'll hit it by the end of the month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey.</v>

2224
01:32:35.051 --> 01:32:36.280
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then also,</v>

2225
01:32:36.281 --> 01:32:38.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this weekend,</v>

2226
01:32:38.110 --> 01:32:38.943
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the secretary of the Interior Zinky on </v>

2227
01:32:42.221 --> 01:32:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Friday is going to announce a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a a big,</v>

2228
01:32:46.690 --> 01:32:49.840
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a big win for </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservationists and,</v>

2229
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:51.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2230
01:32:51.970 --> 01:32:52.803
<v Speaker 2>we're going to protect the winter </v>
<v Speaker 2>migration routes for deer and elk from </v>

2231
01:32:56.141 --> 01:32:58.540
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's been a big thing that,</v>

2232
01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:00.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2233
01:33:00.190 --> 01:33:02.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told,</v>

2234
01:33:02.591 --> 01:33:04.810
<v Speaker 2>I told them when I met with them back in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegas,</v>

2235
01:33:04.811 --> 01:33:07.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know when it was a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks ago that it feels like we've taken</v>

2236
01:33:07.901 --> 01:33:09.970
<v Speaker 2>some hits as sportsman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as,</v>

2237
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:13.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the national monuments being shrunk,</v>

2238
01:33:13.331 --> 01:33:15.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can argue that both ways,</v>

2239
01:33:15.970 --> 01:33:17.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drilling on the,</v>

2240
01:33:17.450 --> 01:33:18.400
<v Speaker 2>on the coast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2241
01:33:18.401 --> 01:33:20.980
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people don't like the prospects</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>

2242
01:33:21.370 --> 01:33:22.420
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2243
01:33:22.450 --> 01:33:26.240
<v Speaker 2>we could use it when and brought up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>winter migration routes and uh,</v>

2244
01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:27.273
<v Speaker 2>protecting those from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from any development just so those </v>

2245
01:33:29.531 --> 01:33:32.140
<v Speaker 2>animals can get down and get to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>winter range.</v>

2246
01:33:32.490 --> 01:33:34.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when food is hard to come by.</v>

2247
01:33:34.421 --> 01:33:35.254
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be announced on Friday </v>

2248
01:33:36.911 --> 01:33:39.880
<v Speaker 2>that he's going to make that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

2249
01:33:39.881 --> 01:33:43.060
<v Speaker 2>And now you have a position there as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

2250
01:33:43.061 --> 01:33:44.770
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is your official position?</v>

2251
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:46.263
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the International Wildlife </v>

2252
01:33:50.050 --> 01:33:50.930
<v Speaker 2>Conservation Council,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has,</v>

2253
01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:53.410
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have anything to do with North </v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

2254
01:33:53.411 --> 01:33:58.411
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just kind of using that as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse to talk about North America.</v>

2255
01:33:58.510 --> 01:34:00.070
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have anything to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>North America.</v>

2256
01:34:00.130 --> 01:34:02.200
<v Speaker 2>Now what does it have to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2257
01:34:02.210 --> 01:34:03.043
<v Speaker 2>with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's about like the trophy export ban </v>

2258
01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:08.470
<v Speaker 2>from Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2259
01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:13.300
<v Speaker 2>so international hunting basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it,</v>

2260
01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:14.313
<v Speaker 2>it's a weighing in on that because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you go to Australia and you </v>

2261
01:34:18.281 --> 01:34:20.320
<v Speaker 2>shoot some animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't bring the meat back.</v>

2262
01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:21.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2263
01:34:21.581 --> 01:34:23.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's different.</v>

2264
01:34:23.410 --> 01:34:24.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's different.</v>

2265
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:25.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2266
01:34:25.210 --> 01:34:27.730
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't have anything to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on right now.</v>

2267
01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:30.700
<v Speaker 2>It's Africa and like with elephants </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming back,</v>

2268
01:34:30.701 --> 01:34:33.580
<v Speaker 2>so when you can't bring your trophy </v>
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>

2269
01:34:33.730 --> 01:34:34.563
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to want to go shoot and not </v>

2270
01:34:35.871 --> 01:34:38.590
<v Speaker 2>just elephants because elephants are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole different category,</v>

2271
01:34:38.591 --> 01:34:41.140
<v Speaker 2>but who's going to go want to shoot a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gazelle?</v>

2272
01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:42.121
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

2273
01:34:42.121 --> 01:34:44.230
<v Speaker 2>if you can't bring it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2274
01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:47.620
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if those are regulated,</v>

2275
01:34:47.621 --> 01:34:52.621
<v Speaker 2>but it's mostly elephants and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in lions and lions they reversed it.</v>

2276
01:34:54.130 --> 01:34:57.380
<v Speaker 2>And then trump said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that trump doesn't like it.</v>

2277
01:34:57.410 --> 01:34:58.340
<v Speaker 2>Which is fascinating</v>

2278
01:34:58.340 --> 01:34:59.173
<v Speaker 3>because his sons,</v>

2279
01:34:59.390 --> 01:35:00.470
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big hunters.</v>

2280
01:35:00.490 --> 01:35:01.310
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2281
01:35:01.310 --> 01:35:03.500
<v Speaker 4>He called it a horror show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did.</v>

2282
01:35:03.501 --> 01:35:06.200
<v Speaker 4>And that's what got my attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because he said that he doesn't see</v>

2283
01:35:06.201 --> 01:35:09.260
<v Speaker 4>how conservation helps elephants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

2284
01:35:09.290 --> 01:35:10.280
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one thing.</v>

2285
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:12.830
<v Speaker 4>But then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or any other animals and I'm like,</v>

2286
01:35:12.831 --> 01:35:14.210
<v Speaker 4>wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2287
01:35:14.211 --> 01:35:15.044
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can't say conservation hunting as a </v>

2288
01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:18.163
<v Speaker 4>conservation tool doesn't help any other</v>
<v Speaker 4>animals because we've proven here in </v>

2289
01:35:20.151 --> 01:35:22.760
<v Speaker 4>North America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that it's a model that works.</v>

2290
01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:26.990
<v Speaker 4>So I didn't like how he worded that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>lump that all on together.</v>

2291
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.760
<v Speaker 4>Now Mike was that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

2292
01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:31.640
<v Speaker 4>was that just a poorly worded tweet?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going on here?</v>

2293
01:35:32.330 --> 01:35:34.880
<v Speaker 4>So then he said he's going to look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>that ban,</v>

2294
01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:37.430
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>regarding elephants because,</v>

2295
01:35:37.431 --> 01:35:38.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's no value on the animals,</v>

2296
01:35:38.991 --> 01:35:40.790
<v Speaker 4>we know it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know what happens.</v>

2297
01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:43.910
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if there is no hunting,</v>

2298
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.160
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty much the death sentence of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the animal.</v>

2299
01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:47.553
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd probably have to explain that to a </v>

2300
01:35:48.731 --> 01:35:50.560
<v Speaker 3>lot of people that don't know what we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>

2301
01:35:50.561 --> 01:35:51.394
<v Speaker 3>But Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of animals in Africa that </v>

2302
01:35:53.651 --> 01:35:56.650
<v Speaker 3>were on the verge of extinction just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>few decades ago.</v>

2303
01:35:57.070 --> 01:36:00.370
<v Speaker 3>And what they did was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very controversial thing to,</v>

2304
01:36:00.371 --> 01:36:03.400
<v Speaker 3>especially to people that don't hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what they did was they created a lot</v>

2305
01:36:03.401 --> 01:36:04.234
<v Speaker 3>of these game preserves where they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>these animals and they had a financial </v>

2306
01:36:09.701 --> 01:36:13.180
<v Speaker 3>interest in keeping these animals alive </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause people paid a lot of money to come</v>

2307
01:36:13.181 --> 01:36:14.014
<v Speaker 3>over there and hunt them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now these animals that were on the </v>

2308
01:36:16.031 --> 01:36:16.864
<v Speaker 3>verge of extinction just a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>decades ago are thriving in record </v>

2309
01:36:19.961 --> 01:36:22.240
<v Speaker 3>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they get hunted.</v>

2310
01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:23.103
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for people that are concerned about </v>

2311
01:36:26.261 --> 01:36:28.630
<v Speaker 3>the welfare of these animals and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2312
01:36:28.631 --> 01:36:29.464
<v Speaker 3>they're wa wildlife lovers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're in a weird predicament because </v>

2313
01:36:32.081 --> 01:36:34.480
<v Speaker 3>it's hunting that's keeping these </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals alive.</v>

2314
01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:39.040
<v Speaker 3>And it seems like a contradiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how could hunting be conservation,</v>

2315
01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:40.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even in this country,</v>

2316
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:43.870
<v Speaker 3>11% taxes on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on bullets,</v>

2317
01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:44.913
<v Speaker 3>on hunting equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on all the different things that people </v>

2318
01:36:46.901 --> 01:36:47.734
<v Speaker 3>buy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was a self imposed tax that </v>

2319
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:50.183
<v Speaker 3>sportsmen put on the purchase of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>goods so that it would go towards </v>

2320
01:36:54.101 --> 01:36:54.934
<v Speaker 3>wildlife and billions of dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>billions of dollars have gone to </v>

2321
01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:02.920
<v Speaker 3>preserving wetlands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>preserving wildlife habitat,</v>

2322
01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:04.373
<v Speaker 3>reestablishing populations of animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all these different areas where </v>

2323
01:37:07.091 --> 01:37:07.924
<v Speaker 3>they're diminished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The amount of money that has gone </v>

2324
01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:11.673
<v Speaker 3>towards conservation from hunters versus</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Peta or the humane society or any </v>

2325
01:37:18.011 --> 01:37:22.330
<v Speaker 3>other welfare group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not even remotely comparable.</v>

2326
01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:25.870
<v Speaker 4>Hunters are making the difference there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we put our money where our mouth is,</v>

2327
01:37:25.871 --> 01:37:27.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we say we care about it,</v>

2328
01:37:27.041 --> 01:37:28.180
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we pay for it.</v>

2329
01:37:28.181 --> 01:37:29.014
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we put money there to help conservation </v>

2330
01:37:30.521 --> 01:37:31.354
<v Speaker 4>and pay for the biologists and pay for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the studies and pay for habitat </v>

2331
01:37:35.231 --> 01:37:36.064
<v Speaker 4>enhancement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that essentially is the same </v>

2332
01:37:38.711 --> 01:37:40.420
<v Speaker 4>thing that needs to happen in Africa is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

2333
01:37:40.421 --> 01:37:41.254
<v Speaker 4>it's weird to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well how can the United States regulate </v>

2334
01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:46.150
<v Speaker 4>what happens in Africa because we can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

2335
01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:49.960
<v Speaker 4>but we can say we're not going to allow </v>
<v Speaker 4>the trophies you come home.</v>

2336
01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:53.110
<v Speaker 4>So that pretty much stops a hunting in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Africa.</v>

2337
01:37:53.111 --> 01:37:53.501
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2338
01:37:53.501 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 4>we're not saying you can or can't hunt </v>
<v Speaker 4>can still go do it.</v>

2339
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:56.813
<v Speaker 2>You just can't bring them home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which essentially stops a hunting </v>

2340
01:37:59.130 --> 01:38:01.250
<v Speaker 2>without hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those animals don't have value.</v>

2341
01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:02.093
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And no matter how you want to slice it </v>

2342
01:38:04.590 --> 01:38:07.680
<v Speaker 2>or phrase it or whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they don't have value,</v>

2343
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:09.383
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be the detriment of the </v>

2344
01:38:10.741 --> 01:38:12.360
<v Speaker 2>animal of the specie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2345
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:13.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenya,</v>

2346
01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:18.200
<v Speaker 2>they stopped hunting in 1973 and 70% of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the animals are gone with no hunting.</v>

2347
01:38:21.930 --> 01:38:23.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very confusing.</v>

2348
01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:25.890
<v Speaker 2>It's as it seems contradictory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

2349
01:38:25.891 --> 01:38:27.120
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2350
01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:28.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to with,</v>

2351
01:38:28.141 --> 01:38:28.921
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2352
01:38:28.921 --> 01:38:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Zinky about this also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what this,</v>

2353
01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:32.513
<v Speaker 2>this council was about to try to make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good decision on how best to regulate </v>

2354
01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:37.253
<v Speaker 2>the trophies coming home and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe we can help promote hunting </v>

2355
01:38:41.531 --> 01:38:43.230
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how to do a ride and,</v>

2356
01:38:43.231 --> 01:38:44.970
<v Speaker 2>and what it means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2357
01:38:44.971 --> 01:38:45.750
<v Speaker 2>as a council.</v>

2358
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:47.910
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm involved in that.</v>

2359
01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:48.923
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use that opportunity to talk to them </v>

2360
01:38:51.201 --> 01:38:53.160
<v Speaker 2>about other things too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2361
01:38:53.161 --> 01:38:54.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I dunno,</v>

2362
01:38:54.510 --> 01:38:57.030
<v Speaker 2>I dunno where it's all gonna Kinda lead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2363
01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:58.313
<v Speaker 2>it's a fascinating subject because </v>
<v Speaker 2>elephants are endangered in some parts </v>

2364
01:39:01.951 --> 01:39:02.784
<v Speaker 2>of Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Africa is an enormous place and in </v>

2365
01:39:05.131 --> 01:39:08.010
<v Speaker 2>other parts of Africa they have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with elephants.</v>

2366
01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:08.873
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So going to those places and shooting </v>

2367
01:39:10.741 --> 01:39:13.650
<v Speaker 2>elephants to most people is a horrific </v>
<v Speaker 2>offense.</v>

2368
01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2369
01:39:15.090 --> 01:39:15.923
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see the amount of money that </v>

2370
01:39:18.751 --> 01:39:20.880
<v Speaker 2>someone has to pay to go and shoot an </v>
<v Speaker 2>elephant.</v>

2371
01:39:21.230 --> 01:39:24.360
<v Speaker 2>It's a crazy amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>75,000 that's a lot of fucking money.</v>

2372
01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:28.350
<v Speaker 2>How many people are spending $75,000 to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go look at them or help them?</v>

2373
01:39:28.650 --> 01:39:30.360
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to know.</v>

2374
01:39:30.361 --> 01:39:31.410
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you say,</v>

2375
01:39:31.411 --> 01:39:34.140
<v Speaker 2>well that money could come from photo </v>
<v Speaker 2>safaris?</v>

2376
01:39:34.230 --> 01:39:35.063
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also with the one's going to pay 75 </v>

2377
01:39:36.811 --> 01:39:39.960
<v Speaker 2>grand to take a picture and for a photo </v>
<v Speaker 2>safari,</v>

2378
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:43.020
<v Speaker 2>where they have them set up is that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>go on the pretty much the same route.</v>

2379
01:39:43.021 --> 01:39:44.790
<v Speaker 2>So the habitat just gets hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2380
01:39:44.791 --> 01:39:48.900
<v Speaker 2>you know what a national monument or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>national park here,</v>

2381
01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:51.180
<v Speaker 2>the most popular places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what those look like?</v>

2382
01:39:51.610 --> 01:39:52.443
<v Speaker 2>Fricking dump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you have those photos far as </v>

2383
01:39:54.661 --> 01:39:57.690
<v Speaker 2>they go on the same track,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically you're hammering the habitat,</v>

2384
01:39:57.720 --> 01:39:58.553
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting back to the back </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaches where the poachers are killing </v>

2385
01:40:00.421 --> 01:40:01.350
<v Speaker 2>the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2386
01:40:01.351 --> 01:40:06.351
<v Speaker 2>that's still happening back there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then to get a pride of lion in tour,</v>

2387
01:40:06.370 --> 01:40:07.203
<v Speaker 2>you can take pictures of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're still going out and shooting </v>

2388
01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:10.300
<v Speaker 2>zebras and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2389
01:40:10.330 --> 01:40:13.440
<v Speaker 2>and Paula and in different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buffalo throwing them out there.</v>

2390
01:40:13.441 --> 01:40:14.790
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the lions are,</v>

2391
01:40:14.791 --> 01:40:15.540
<v Speaker 2>they're eating.</v>

2392
01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:18.000
<v Speaker 2>So there's still animals dying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're just,</v>

2393
01:40:18.001 --> 01:40:22.800
<v Speaker 2>the animals aren't benefiting from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you think of like in the Bush of</v>

2394
01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:24.490
<v Speaker 2>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if uh,</v>

2395
01:40:25.170 --> 01:40:27.880
<v Speaker 2>a farmer there has a crop and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>elephants getting in,</v>

2396
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:31.920
<v Speaker 2>they're thrashing his crop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the elephant has no value to them.</v>

2397
01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:35.550
<v Speaker 2>What has value as a crop?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if the animal,</v>

2398
01:40:35.610 --> 01:40:37.920
<v Speaker 2>if the elephants in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trampling it.</v>

2399
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:40.110
<v Speaker 2>He just wants to elfant debt once </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've gone.</v>

2400
01:40:40.111 --> 01:40:41.370
<v Speaker 2>So he's going to shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to lay there.</v>

2401
01:40:41.371 --> 01:40:42.204
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to benefit anybody but </v>

2402
01:40:43.591 --> 01:40:44.424
<v Speaker 2>his crop grows and that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just very hard for people to look </v>

2403
01:40:47.581 --> 01:40:50.130
<v Speaker 2>at it that way because they look at it </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2404
01:40:50.190 --> 01:40:51.690
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want an elephant to die.</v>

2405
01:40:52.610 --> 01:40:53.950
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want a lion to die.</v>

2406
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:54.430
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2407
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:55.263
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want a zebra to die and I don't </v>

2408
01:40:56.171 --> 01:40:59.200
<v Speaker 5>want to draft a die and we can go ahead </v>
<v Speaker 5>and shoot that other thing.</v>

2409
01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:00.730
<v Speaker 5>That wart hog,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ugly thing,</v>

2410
01:41:01.210 --> 01:41:02.043
<v Speaker 5>nobody gives a fuck about warhawks you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can shoot warhawks and smile and take a </v>

2411
01:41:04.931 --> 01:41:05.764
<v Speaker 5>picture and people are racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were racist against certain </v>

2412
01:41:08.621 --> 01:41:10.270
<v Speaker 5>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a fact.</v>

2413
01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:11.081
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

2414
01:41:11.081 --> 01:41:12.010
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fact,</v>

2415
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:13.840
<v Speaker 5>is it racism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>racism,</v>

2416
01:41:14.250 --> 01:41:18.670
<v Speaker 5>race of speciesism or you speciest I am.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I sent you a video about that.</v>

2417
01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:21.250
<v Speaker 5>Speciesist that's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

2418
01:41:21.450 --> 01:41:23.290
<v Speaker 5>and people way more than I like </v>
<v Speaker 5>goldfish.</v>

2419
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:25.480
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and with regard to lions,</v>

2420
01:41:25.481 --> 01:41:26.314
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so if lions are coming in and killing </v>

2421
01:41:27.431 --> 01:41:31.300
<v Speaker 5>the goats or whatever that the say in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Tanzania that they're raising,</v>

2422
01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:34.450
<v Speaker 5>they're just going to put,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there'll be a dead goat.</v>

2423
01:41:34.451 --> 01:41:35.580
<v Speaker 5>They'll put poison in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

2424
01:41:35.581 --> 01:41:37.090
<v Speaker 5>the pride will come in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eat it,</v>

2425
01:41:37.091 --> 01:41:37.780
<v Speaker 5>they'll go die.</v>

2426
01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:41.290
<v Speaker 5>Then no more goats are getting killed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All those lines are dead.</v>

2427
01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:43.600
<v Speaker 5>Well that was one of the things about </v>
<v Speaker 5>Zimbabwe,</v>

2428
01:41:43.601 --> 01:41:44.740
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2429
01:41:44.770 --> 01:41:47.680
<v Speaker 5>was it Zimbabwe where that guy killed </v>
<v Speaker 5>that lion?</v>

2430
01:41:47.710 --> 01:41:49.180
<v Speaker 5>The Cecil?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2431
01:41:49.181 --> 01:41:50.014
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2432
01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:51.153
<v Speaker 5>That place they had to kill a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>lions because people stopped lion </v>

2433
01:41:55.181 --> 01:41:58.300
<v Speaker 5>hunting there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so because they stopped line hunting</v>

2434
01:41:58.301 --> 01:41:59.134
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had this excess of lions and they </v>

2435
01:42:00.521 --> 01:42:01.354
<v Speaker 5>were destroying the Angelo population.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they had to go in and just slaughter </v>

2436
01:42:03.581 --> 01:42:04.470
<v Speaker 5>these lions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2437
01:42:04.810 --> 01:42:08.320
<v Speaker 5>So the $50,000 per line that they would </v>
<v Speaker 5>have made,</v>

2438
01:42:08.321 --> 01:42:11.380
<v Speaker 5>that would have gone towards all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 5>of different things,</v>

2439
01:42:11.381 --> 01:42:13.480
<v Speaker 5>protection of the habitat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2440
01:42:13.481 --> 01:42:16.930
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the different conservation officers that</v>

2441
01:42:16.931 --> 01:42:17.764
<v Speaker 5>work in that area instead that there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>no money and then they actually have to </v>

2442
01:42:20.981 --> 01:42:23.980
<v Speaker 5>hire someone to go and do that job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2443
01:42:24.190 --> 01:42:26.650
<v Speaker 5>And this is the argument about British </v>
<v Speaker 5>Columbia as well.</v>

2444
01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:29.290
<v Speaker 5>This is exactly what's going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 5>up there.</v>

2445
01:42:29.291 --> 01:42:30.124
<v Speaker 5>That the argument that you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 5>from the people that are in the field </v>

2446
01:42:31.901 --> 01:42:35.050
<v Speaker 5>that are out there every day is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>what's going to have to happen is you're</v>

2447
01:42:35.051 --> 01:42:35.884
<v Speaker 5>going to have a bunch of problem bears.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're going to have to hire people </v>

2448
01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:41.290
<v Speaker 5>that go out to these problem bears and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's incredibly expensive and very,</v>

2449
01:42:41.291 --> 01:42:42.620
<v Speaker 5>very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2450
01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:45.400
<v Speaker 5>And bears are going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2451
01:42:45.450 --> 01:42:47.790
<v Speaker 5>So still still going to have of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of them are still going to die.</v>

2452
01:42:47.850 --> 01:42:49.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But animals are going to die.</v>

2453
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:50.583
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you get mad when a bear kills an </v>

2454
01:42:53.051 --> 01:42:55.350
<v Speaker 5>antelope or when a bear kills a giraffe </v>
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

2455
01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:55.811
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2456
01:42:55.811 --> 01:42:56.950
<v Speaker 5>they don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not over there.</v>

2457
01:42:57.310 --> 01:42:58.840
<v Speaker 5>But if they were over here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2458
01:42:58.870 --> 01:43:01.120
<v Speaker 5>if a bear kills a Moose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you upset?</v>

2459
01:43:01.150 --> 01:43:03.190
<v Speaker 5>Are you only upset when a person killed </v>
<v Speaker 5>a moose?</v>

2460
01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:04.930
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2461
01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:08.230
<v Speaker 5>in Africa too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so those animals are dying.</v>

2462
01:43:08.530 --> 01:43:09.363
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and w when it's hunters that are doing </v>

2463
01:43:11.351 --> 01:43:13.120
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the numbers are very controlled.</v>

2464
01:43:13.121 --> 01:43:17.200
<v Speaker 5>The harvest is very controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can take x amount of animals out and</v>

2465
01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:19.620
<v Speaker 5>this money will go towards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2466
01:43:19.810 --> 01:43:23.540
<v Speaker 5>this enhancement of a waterhole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this pain for um,</v>

2467
01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:27.070
<v Speaker 5>the anti poaching unit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which when I was over there was $1,000 a</v>

2468
01:43:27.071 --> 01:43:29.950
<v Speaker 5>day to pay for guys to come in to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to control,</v>

2469
01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:33.160
<v Speaker 5>keep the poachers out of there without </v>
<v Speaker 5>that money.</v>

2470
01:43:33.290 --> 01:43:34.720
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>none of that's happening.</v>

2471
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:39.100
<v Speaker 5>So there instead of having a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>regulated harvest number,</v>

2472
01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:41.550
<v Speaker 5>the poachers will kill hell over mini.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2473
01:43:41.890 --> 01:43:42.723
<v Speaker 5>And let's be honest about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the vast majority of the money is going </v>

2474
01:43:44.711 --> 01:43:49.530
<v Speaker 5>towards whatever lodge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the owners of that for sure area.</v>

2475
01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:52.160
<v Speaker 5>But they're also hiring people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are hiring people,</v>

2476
01:43:52.161 --> 01:43:54.650
<v Speaker 5>but they have a financial incentive to </v>
<v Speaker 5>keep these animals alive.</v>

2477
01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:55.753
<v Speaker 5>It's very peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very problematic for a lot of </v>

2478
01:43:57.621 --> 01:43:58.730
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't like to hear it.</v>

2479
01:43:58.910 --> 01:44:00.770
<v Speaker 5>And I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've read this article that's ridiculous</v>

2480
01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:04.550
<v Speaker 5>article that said that that's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that trophy hunting is not what sustains</v>

2481
01:44:04.551 --> 01:44:05.870
<v Speaker 5>these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2482
01:44:05.871 --> 01:44:08.990
<v Speaker 5>you can get just as much from a safari.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's not true.</v>

2483
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:13.730
<v Speaker 5>What you're saying is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That CNN thing handled it pretty well.</v>

2484
01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:16.430
<v Speaker 5>Did you watch that tracks?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What did you think about that?</v>

2485
01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:18.140
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2486
01:44:18.150 --> 01:44:19.370
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a hunter.</v>

2487
01:44:19.371 --> 01:44:21.490
<v Speaker 5>Said some stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't God,</v>

2488
01:44:21.530 --> 01:44:22.161
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2489
01:44:22.161 --> 01:44:24.110
<v Speaker 5>we talked about this earlier in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast,</v>

2490
01:44:24.111 --> 01:44:25.220
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when people say,</v>

2491
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:26.143
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just want to go kill stuff and this </v>

2492
01:44:27.021 --> 01:44:27.854
<v Speaker 5>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't really like when whoever the </v>

2493
01:44:30.801 --> 01:44:31.790
<v Speaker 5>hunter was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2494
01:44:31.791 --> 01:44:35.270
<v Speaker 5>It's probably a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he shot a crocodile and he says,</v>

2495
01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:36.740
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mother effer.</v>

2496
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:39.260
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is going on there?</v>

2497
01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:40.393
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never done anything like that and </v>

2498
01:44:41.931 --> 01:44:43.070
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that seemed,</v>

2499
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:46.250
<v Speaker 5>that isn't like the honorable hunter </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I know,</v>

2500
01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:47.810
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that seems a little weird.</v>

2501
01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:49.790
<v Speaker 5>I don't like crocodiles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might say.</v>

2502
01:44:49.791 --> 01:44:50.541
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mother fucker.</v>

2503
01:44:50.541 --> 01:44:53.690
<v Speaker 5>If I shot the crocodile crocodile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>scare the shit out of me.</v>

2504
01:44:54.110 --> 01:44:54.943
<v Speaker 5>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The one thing that scares me more than </v>

2505
01:44:56.301 --> 01:44:58.100
<v Speaker 5>any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty much any animal on the planet.</v>

2506
01:44:58.130 --> 01:44:58.611
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

2507
01:44:58.611 --> 01:44:59.410
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2508
01:44:59.410 --> 01:45:01.820
<v Speaker 5>I still feel a lot of respect for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>animal.</v>

2509
01:45:01.821 --> 01:45:03.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm joking around most of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

2510
01:45:03.530 --> 01:45:04.363
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I did just seem like a weird </v>

2511
01:45:05.511 --> 01:45:06.620
<v Speaker 5>reaction to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2512
01:45:06.621 --> 01:45:09.140
<v Speaker 5>especially knowing that the world is </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to see that reaction.</v>

2513
01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:09.831
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2514
01:45:09.831 --> 01:45:11.690
<v Speaker 5>if he was just by himself and he said </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2515
01:45:11.691 --> 01:45:12.524
<v Speaker 5>and that was an honest reaction and </v>
<v Speaker 5>who's still had respect for the animal </v>

2516
01:45:16.191 --> 01:45:18.230
<v Speaker 5>and it was just the fact that he pulled </v>
<v Speaker 5>it off.</v>

2517
01:45:18.710 --> 01:45:19.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's unfortunate.</v>

2518
01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.440
<v Speaker 5>It's unfortunate as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2519
01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:25.160
<v Speaker 5>it's unfortunate to broadcast that for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the world to see.</v>

2520
01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:26.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

2521
01:45:26.930 --> 01:45:27.763
<v Speaker 5>I thought it could have been a lot worse</v>
<v Speaker 5>with regard to how hunters were </v>

2522
01:45:30.501 --> 01:45:31.610
<v Speaker 5>portrayed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2523
01:45:31.611 --> 01:45:32.444
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2524
01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:36.590
<v Speaker 5>even the guy who killed the lion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he did get emotional.</v>

2525
01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:38.870
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he showed some reverence there,</v>

2526
01:45:38.871 --> 01:45:40.010
<v Speaker 5>which,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I liked.</v>

2527
01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:42.260
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it could have been worse.</v>

2528
01:45:42.370 --> 01:45:45.710
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they talked about how it's animals are,</v>

2529
01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:48.590
<v Speaker 5>I guess a commodity in some respects </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the rhinos.</v>

2530
01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:49.460
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2531
01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:51.740
<v Speaker 5>I think that guy had 1500 rhinos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't he,</v>

2532
01:45:51.741 --> 01:45:54.380
<v Speaker 5>on his property and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2533
01:45:54.381 --> 01:45:55.214
<v Speaker 5>so what's better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>1500 rhinos for him to have and raise </v>

2534
01:45:57.930 --> 01:46:01.190
<v Speaker 5>and cut off the horns or zero.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2535
01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:02.870
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's better to have 1500.</v>

2536
01:46:02.871 --> 01:46:03.681
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2537
01:46:03.681 --> 01:46:04.514
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely better for the </v>

2538
01:46:04.851 --> 01:46:05.684
<v Speaker 5>population of rhinos as a whole because </v>
<v Speaker 5>people don't like the idea of raising </v>

2539
01:46:09.111 --> 01:46:12.410
<v Speaker 5>something as a commodity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>raising wildlife as a commodity.</v>

2540
01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:13.333
<v Speaker 5>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever see the Louis through </v>

2541
01:46:14.421 --> 01:46:18.830
<v Speaker 5>documentary about wildlife in Africa </v>
<v Speaker 5>about those,</v>

2542
01:46:19.780 --> 01:46:22.160
<v Speaker 5>I forget what it was called,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can watch it on youtube.</v>

2543
01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:24.770
<v Speaker 5>That to me was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a better piece.</v>

2544
01:46:24.771 --> 01:46:29.360
<v Speaker 5>And one of the most interesting things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because Louie is a,</v>

2545
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:31.970
<v Speaker 5>he's a very smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's also a very nice guy.</v>

2546
01:46:32.350 --> 01:46:33.183
<v Speaker 5>He just kept asking questions and </v>
<v Speaker 5>pestering people and getting to the </v>

2547
01:46:35.151 --> 01:46:35.984
<v Speaker 5>heart of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he also showed like these fenced in </v>

2548
01:46:38.151 --> 01:46:41.300
<v Speaker 5>Lyons and they're throwing a dead cow </v>
<v Speaker 5>over the top of the fence.</v>

2549
01:46:41.301 --> 01:46:42.770
<v Speaker 5>And the lines have been tearing it </v>
<v Speaker 5>apart.</v>

2550
01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:44.450
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't see it.</v>

2551
01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:46.490
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's weird because the,</v>

2552
01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:49.740
<v Speaker 5>these lions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're never like,</v>

2553
01:46:49.741 --> 01:46:50.400
<v Speaker 5>they're feeding</v>

2554
01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:53.940
<v Speaker 3>him and then people go over there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunt them as if it's like a wild lion.</v>

2555
01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:54.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2556
01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:58.430
<v Speaker 2>it's super weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't hunt and offense.</v>

2557
01:46:58.690 --> 01:47:00.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot align in a fence.</v>

2558
01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:03.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know.</v>

2559
01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:05.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

2560
01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:08.080
<v Speaker 3>it's not what we call over here in </v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

2561
01:47:08.081 --> 01:47:09.280
<v Speaker 3>Fair Chase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2562
01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:10.690
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a term,</v>

2563
01:47:10.691 --> 01:47:14.830
<v Speaker 3>that term fair chase is synonymous with </v>
<v Speaker 3>ethical hunters in America.</v>

2564
01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:16.053
<v Speaker 3>And this is something that most people </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't aware of that there's a code and </v>

2565
01:47:20.770 --> 01:47:21.603
<v Speaker 3>that code the code very slightly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in some places you can use </v>

2566
01:47:24.371 --> 01:47:25.204
<v Speaker 3>electronic communication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning you can use walkie talkies to </v>

2567
01:47:27.101 --> 01:47:29.170
<v Speaker 3>locate an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a,</v>

2568
01:47:29.171 --> 01:47:32.860
<v Speaker 3>I believe you can do that in Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You definitely could do that in Nevada.</v>

2569
01:47:33.130 --> 01:47:34.950
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2570
01:47:34.951 --> 01:47:35.784
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's different things of what people </v>

2571
01:47:37.121 --> 01:47:37.954
<v Speaker 3>decide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fair chase or ethical and it </v>

2572
01:47:39.821 --> 01:47:41.050
<v Speaker 3>depends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Colorado,</v>

2573
01:47:41.051 --> 01:47:43.870
<v Speaker 3>they won't even let you use a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a light on your site,</v>

2574
01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:46.360
<v Speaker 3>on your both site can have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>electronics,</v>

2575
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:47.783
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attached to your site for whatever </v>

2576
01:47:48.611 --> 01:47:51.220
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just started allowing lighted nocks</v>

2577
01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:52.213
<v Speaker 2>well that was just an Oregon too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they've been outlawed in Oregon I </v>

2578
01:47:54.650 --> 01:47:55.520
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2579
01:47:55.521 --> 01:47:56.960
<v Speaker 2>I haven't used them in Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2580
01:47:56.961 --> 01:47:58.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they are legal now.</v>

2581
01:47:58.461 --> 01:48:00.530
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean as far as,</v>

2582
01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:03.230
<v Speaker 2>so you're trying to define what is fair </v>
<v Speaker 2>chase.</v>

2583
01:48:03.231 --> 01:48:03.951
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah,</v>

2584
01:48:03.951 --> 01:48:06.050
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of these electronics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this or that.</v>

2585
01:48:06.051 --> 01:48:09.440
<v Speaker 2>But what we say is fair chase is not in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a high fence.</v>

2586
01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:14.720
<v Speaker 3>Well it's definitely not feeding a lion </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a cage and then opening up the door.</v>

2587
01:48:14.721 --> 01:48:18.050
<v Speaker 3>Right when the hunter pulls up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is due to,</v>

2588
01:48:18.110 --> 01:48:19.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is what they do.</v>

2589
01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:22.850
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the reasons why a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these lines that get shot,</v>

2590
01:48:22.851 --> 01:48:24.860
<v Speaker 3>they don't know what the fuck is going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

2591
01:48:24.890 --> 01:48:27.800
<v Speaker 3>They're bedded somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just lay down cause they're outside</v>

2592
01:48:27.801 --> 01:48:29.480
<v Speaker 3>in this new environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like where am I?</v>

2593
01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:30.423
<v Speaker 3>And even know what it is because they've</v>
<v Speaker 3>been living in this very small </v>

2594
01:48:31.821 --> 01:48:32.654
<v Speaker 3>environment and they let them out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they let him out right when the hunter </v>

2595
01:48:35.531 --> 01:48:35.980
<v Speaker 3>gets,</v>

2596
01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:37.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2597
01:48:38.050 --> 01:48:40.510
<v Speaker 2>that's tougher to justify.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very tough to justify.</v>

2598
01:48:40.511 --> 01:48:40.911
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2599
01:48:40.911 --> 01:48:42.030
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2600
01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:44.140
<v Speaker 2>it's not justifiable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2601
01:48:44.350 --> 01:48:46.810
<v Speaker 2>You're not hunting anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just murdering an animal.</v>

2602
01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:47.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm murder.</v>

2603
01:48:47.961 --> 01:48:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Murder is a person right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to,</v>

2604
01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:51.873
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to not address that part and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just address hunting in general and </v>

2605
01:48:55.571 --> 01:49:00.571
<v Speaker 2>hunting in general is what's necessary </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>

2606
01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:03.400
<v Speaker 2>the future of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2607
01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:04.653
<v Speaker 2>you had until it gets down to a number </v>
<v Speaker 2>where maybe the white or black or </v>

2608
01:49:07.991 --> 01:49:11.020
<v Speaker 2>whatever rhino that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's only down to a hound handful.</v>

2609
01:49:11.021 --> 01:49:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Obviously you're not going to hunt </v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

2610
01:49:13.150 --> 01:49:16.390
<v Speaker 2>But by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting is what keeps these animals,</v>

2611
01:49:16.930 --> 01:49:18.490
<v Speaker 2>the population viable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2612
01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:19.353
<v Speaker 2>and then there was also the case of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Corey Knowles who went over there and </v>

2613
01:49:22.421 --> 01:49:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Knowlton no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nolan.</v>

2614
01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Corey Knowlton Knowlton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2615
01:49:27.420 --> 01:49:28.310
<v Speaker 2>Does that he say his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2616
01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:29.433
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Corey.</v>

2617
01:49:30.460 --> 01:49:31.540
<v Speaker 2>Corey Knowlton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got it.</v>

2618
01:49:31.570 --> 01:49:33.230
<v Speaker 2>Why does he noise?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2619
01:49:33.231 --> 01:49:35.020
<v Speaker 2>I have too many names in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

2620
01:49:35.021 --> 01:49:36.310
<v Speaker 2>when cory went over there in </v>
<v Speaker 2>cornerstone,</v>

2621
01:49:36.330 --> 01:49:38.260
<v Speaker 2>the hotspot smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think so?</v>

2622
01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:41.020
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what people like to say,</v>

2623
01:49:41.021 --> 01:49:41.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2624
01:49:41.590 --> 01:49:44.720
<v Speaker 2>People would see a lot of stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven pop quiz motherfucker.</v>

2625
01:49:46.030 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when cory went</v>

2626
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.903
<v Speaker 5>over there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he spent a quarter of a million dollars </v>

2627
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:56.470
<v Speaker 5>to shoot an endangered rhino,</v>
<v Speaker 5>think it was 350,000 was it that much?</v>

2628
01:49:57.310 --> 01:49:59.260
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of money,</v>

2629
01:49:59.590 --> 01:50:00.423
<v Speaker 5>hundreds of thousands of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he said that it was undervalued and </v>

2630
01:50:03.701 --> 01:50:04.534
<v Speaker 5>he said the reason why the bidding </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't get higher it was because there </v>

2631
01:50:06.371 --> 01:50:07.204
<v Speaker 5>was so much pressure on people to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he explained very eloquently and </v>

2632
01:50:11.741 --> 01:50:15.970
<v Speaker 5>very clearly on CNN and when he did my </v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast about all the death threats that</v>

2633
01:50:15.971 --> 01:50:16.391
<v Speaker 5>he got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what he said,</v>

2634
01:50:16.391 --> 01:50:19.870
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that rhino was killing other rhinos.</v>

2635
01:50:20.050 --> 01:50:22.360
<v Speaker 5>That is why not breeding,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not breeding.</v>

2636
01:50:22.361 --> 01:50:23.194
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was an old rhino that was past its </v>

2637
01:50:25.121 --> 01:50:25.954
<v Speaker 5>breeding prime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't breeding anymore and it was </v>

2638
01:50:27.911 --> 01:50:30.880
<v Speaker 5>killing the young rhinos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had killed a female that had tried to</v>

2639
01:50:30.881 --> 01:50:34.600
<v Speaker 5>mate with and it had killed another male</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it was,</v>

2640
01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:35.493
<v Speaker 5>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these was,</v>

2641
01:50:35.530 --> 01:50:39.460
<v Speaker 5>this is an endangered animal and this </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing was killing other animals.</v>

2642
01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:40.601
<v Speaker 5>They had decided,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2643
01:50:40.601 --> 01:50:43.060
<v Speaker 5>we have to take this out of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>population,</v>

2644
01:50:43.450 --> 01:50:44.283
<v Speaker 5>so what is the best money for it to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>a tremendous amount of money that could </v>

2645
01:50:47.861 --> 01:50:50.500
<v Speaker 5>go for anti poaching efforts and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these different things.</v>

2646
01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:52.540
<v Speaker 5>And so he explained it like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

2647
01:50:52.541 --> 01:50:53.374
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is an animal that they were going </v>

2648
01:50:55.511 --> 01:50:56.344
<v Speaker 5>to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had to kill it because it was </v>

2649
01:50:58.151 --> 01:50:58.984
<v Speaker 5>threatening this endangered population </v>
<v Speaker 5>of only like a couple of thousand </v>

2650
01:51:01.331 --> 01:51:02.164
<v Speaker 5>rhinos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

2651
01:51:02.230 --> 01:51:03.640
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2652
01:51:03.850 --> 01:51:04.683
<v Speaker 5>It's a really interesting situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And people would like it if that wasn't </v>

2653
01:51:09.701 --> 01:51:10.960
<v Speaker 5>the case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would like it if no,</v>

2654
01:51:10.961 --> 01:51:11.794
<v Speaker 5>the money is actually coming from animal</v>
<v Speaker 5>welfare groups and from wildlife lovers </v>

2655
01:51:16.150 --> 01:51:17.950
<v Speaker 5>who just want to see these animals </v>
<v Speaker 5>alive.</v>

2656
01:51:18.190 --> 01:51:23.190
<v Speaker 5>The difference is it's very rare that </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone is going to give you $350,000 to</v>

2657
01:51:23.381 --> 01:51:25.030
<v Speaker 5>keep a rhino a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh.</v>

2658
01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:27.790
<v Speaker 5>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a magnified example,</v>

2659
01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:31.120
<v Speaker 5>but that's pretty much what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 5>with all the animals.</v>

2660
01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:32.470
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not getting that much money,</v>

2661
01:51:32.471 --> 01:51:35.230
<v Speaker 5>but you're getting money in exchange for</v>
<v Speaker 5>their life,</v>

2662
01:51:35.231 --> 01:51:37.570
<v Speaker 5>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's for the betterment of the herd.</v>

2663
01:51:37.630 --> 01:51:38.441
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2664
01:51:38.441 --> 01:51:40.030
<v Speaker 5>that's hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2665
01:51:40.090 --> 01:51:40.661
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2666
01:51:40.661 --> 01:51:41.740
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's like,</v>

2667
01:51:42.730 --> 01:51:43.563
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very magnified because you're getting a </v>

2668
01:51:44.561 --> 01:51:46.510
<v Speaker 5>huge amount of money and there's only a </v>
<v Speaker 5>few animals,</v>

2669
01:51:46.511 --> 01:51:48.370
<v Speaker 5>but you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's easy to see,</v>

2670
01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:49.413
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>killing this one is going to save </v>

2671
01:51:50.471 --> 01:51:52.210
<v Speaker 5>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's really easy to see.</v>

2672
01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:54.700
<v Speaker 5>But that's pretty much what happens with</v>
<v Speaker 5>all animals.</v>

2673
01:51:54.701 --> 01:51:56.170
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're balancing that heard.</v>

2674
01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:59.710
<v Speaker 5>The other thing is they ate that rhino </v>
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of people at that Rhino,</v>

2675
01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:00.573
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they give you a need a way to villages </v>

2676
01:52:01.391 --> 01:52:05.230
<v Speaker 5>and people don't know you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You not only can you eat rhinos,</v>

2677
01:52:05.231 --> 01:52:07.570
<v Speaker 5>apparently they taste good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Same thing with elephant.</v>

2678
01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:09.700
<v Speaker 5>Elephant apparently tastes delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2679
01:52:09.701 --> 01:52:12.760
<v Speaker 5>do you remember in the trophy movie </v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2680
01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:16.540
<v Speaker 5>they could care less what elephant that </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy killed,</v>

2681
01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:19.150
<v Speaker 5>but they didn't like that it was small.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2682
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:21.040
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember that in me?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because they wanted more meat.</v>

2683
01:52:21.490 --> 01:52:23.200
<v Speaker 5>They don't care about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they want it.</v>

2684
01:52:23.230 --> 01:52:24.790
<v Speaker 5>They care about eating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2685
01:52:24.910 --> 01:52:28.270
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So as far as the locals go,</v>

2686
01:52:29.050 --> 01:52:31.540
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we here in America,</v>

2687
01:52:31.541 --> 01:52:33.310
<v Speaker 5>it feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2688
01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:36.760
<v Speaker 5>we take up these causes and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2689
01:52:36.761 --> 01:52:40.210
<v Speaker 5>we're the social justice warriors for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the world.</v>

2690
01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:41.433
<v Speaker 5>It's like we ought to probably check in </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the people that actually live </v>

2691
01:52:43.871 --> 01:52:44.411
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2692
01:52:44.411 --> 01:52:45.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want to kill the lions.</v>

2693
01:52:46.580 --> 01:52:47.840
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sees a kid.</v>

2694
01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:50.600
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an article in the New York Times shortly</v>

2695
01:52:50.601 --> 01:52:53.870
<v Speaker 3>after the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Lion Cecil the lion controversy.</v>

2696
01:52:54.170 --> 01:52:57.010
<v Speaker 3>It said a in Zimbabwe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did not cry for lions.</v>

2697
01:52:57.090 --> 01:52:57.980
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that.</v>

2698
01:52:57.981 --> 01:52:58.820
<v Speaker 3>Read that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2699
01:52:58.850 --> 01:52:59.451
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2700
01:52:59.451 --> 01:53:01.040
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's real life.</v>

2701
01:53:01.041 --> 01:53:02.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over here,</v>

2702
01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:04.161
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lion,</v>

2703
01:53:04.161 --> 01:53:06.800
<v Speaker 3>king,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything lives everybody's friends.</v>

2704
01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:10.130
<v Speaker 3>But Simba is my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2705
01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:12.530
<v Speaker 3>No one's saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lions need to die.</v>

2706
01:53:12.610 --> 01:53:14.300
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look,</v>

2707
01:53:14.301 --> 01:53:15.134
<v Speaker 3>I'm not in favor of those high fence </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and the way they keep those </v>

2708
01:53:17.901 --> 01:53:20.630
<v Speaker 3>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of things you've told me before,</v>

2709
01:53:20.631 --> 01:53:21.730
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't have on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2710
01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:22.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No desire.</v>

2711
01:53:22.850 --> 01:53:23.390
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2712
01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:26.490
<v Speaker 3>but you understand teen and how it works</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2713
01:53:26.491 --> 01:53:28.430
<v Speaker 3>and how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we need.</v>

2714
01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:29.313
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2715
01:53:29.330 --> 01:53:30.163
<v Speaker 3>it's just a weird facet of human nature </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we've sort of boxed ourselves into </v>

2716
01:53:35.181 --> 01:53:37.830
<v Speaker 3>this situation with Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Africa I think is,</v>

2717
01:53:38.450 --> 01:53:39.283
<v Speaker 3>you could look to that example and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and see how it's is a very complex </v>

2718
01:53:43.761 --> 01:53:44.594
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

2719
01:53:44.990 --> 01:53:46.820
<v Speaker 3>Especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's take all the woods.</v>

2720
01:53:46.821 --> 01:53:47.654
<v Speaker 3>Steve Rinella calls the charismatic </v>
<v Speaker 3>megafauna out of the equation like </v>

2721
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:52.820
<v Speaker 3>giraffes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which everybody loves.</v>

2722
01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:53.953
<v Speaker 3>Like I had a whole bit about giraffes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of my comedy specials that </v>

2723
01:53:56.480 --> 01:53:57.313
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one animal that you can't say is </v>

2724
01:54:00.710 --> 01:54:02.960
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not better off in the zoo.</v>

2725
01:54:03.330 --> 01:54:05.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because like other animals,</v>

2726
01:54:05.211 --> 01:54:08.270
<v Speaker 3>they look like captive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're contained.</v>

2727
01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:11.240
<v Speaker 3>But giraffes are so happy babies </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom.</v>

2728
01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:14.720
<v Speaker 3>Like I used to take my kids to the zoo </v>
<v Speaker 3>when my daughter was,</v>

2729
01:54:15.050 --> 01:54:15.883
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think she was two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's holding out of a piece of lettuce </v>

2730
01:54:18.921 --> 01:54:23.921
<v Speaker 3>and a fucking giraffe comes out to hedge</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge giant Tang wraps around the lettuce</v>

2731
01:54:24.351 --> 01:54:26.450
<v Speaker 3>and takes it from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's giggling and laughing,</v>

2732
01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:32.020
<v Speaker 3>but they're so confident in giraffe </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior that they let babies feed them.</v>

2733
01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:33.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's impressive.</v>

2734
01:54:33.390 --> 01:54:34.600
<v Speaker 3>Or animal like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the zoo.</v>

2735
01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:38.030
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because animals are wild animals,</v>

2736
01:54:38.031 --> 01:54:39.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>done all that they're going to do.</v>

2737
01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:43.490
<v Speaker 3>But what I said was that a giraffe wakes</v>
<v Speaker 3>up every day in the zoo and goes another</v>

2738
01:54:43.490 --> 01:54:45.550
<v Speaker 3>day with no lions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

2739
01:54:45.790 --> 01:54:48.180
<v Speaker 3>And just sort of wanders around the zoo </v>
<v Speaker 3>having a,</v>

2740
01:54:48.310 --> 01:54:51.740
<v Speaker 3>they look like they're having a blast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have not a care in the world.</v>

2741
01:54:51.770 --> 01:54:54.800
<v Speaker 3>They don't mind at all being in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>fence long as you keep chucking that,</v>

2742
01:54:54.801 --> 01:54:56.240
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the side there are good.</v>

2743
01:54:56.241 --> 01:54:57.500
<v Speaker 3>Keep it coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep dead.</v>

2744
01:54:57.501 --> 01:54:58.370
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on baby.</v>

2745
01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:00.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good to go.</v>

2746
01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:03.470
<v Speaker 3>We have connections with certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

2747
01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:05.960
<v Speaker 3>Elephants are a big one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2748
01:55:05.980 --> 01:55:07.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lions are a big one.</v>

2749
01:55:08.060 --> 01:55:10.460
<v Speaker 3>Giraffes for whatever reason are a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

2750
01:55:10.461 --> 01:55:11.630
<v Speaker 3>Even zebras,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like,</v>

2751
01:55:11.631 --> 01:55:14.180
<v Speaker 3>why are you shooting at a zebra?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too much like a horse.</v>

2752
01:55:14.210 --> 01:55:15.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we have these,</v>

2753
01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:20.510
<v Speaker 3>but if it's like an antelope like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you eat like,</v>

2754
01:55:20.511 --> 01:55:21.620
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kinda makes sense.</v>

2755
01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:22.493
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we have these kind of makes sense </v>

2756
01:55:23.241 --> 01:55:24.020
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

2757
01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:26.630
<v Speaker 3>wart hogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody gives a fuck about warthogs.</v>

2758
01:55:26.810 --> 01:55:28.780
<v Speaker 3>There's no one out there trying to save </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Warhawk.</v>

2759
01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:30.170
<v Speaker 3>People don't even know how many there </v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

2760
01:55:30.171 --> 01:55:31.750
<v Speaker 3>They don't care and care less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2761
01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:32.653
<v Speaker 3>This is not like people worried about </v>
<v Speaker 3>lions and no one is out there wondering </v>

2762
01:55:36.111 --> 01:55:38.180
<v Speaker 3>how many ward hogs are all left in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa.</v>

2763
01:55:38.540 --> 01:55:40.730
<v Speaker 3>I see it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like people will comment,</v>

2764
01:55:40.731 --> 01:55:41.720
<v Speaker 3>not hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>IVC,</v>

2765
01:55:41.721 --> 01:55:43.770
<v Speaker 3>but they'll be like on my page and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2766
01:55:43.890 --> 01:55:44.150
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2767
01:55:44.150 --> 01:55:45.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a problem if you kill deer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and elk,</v>

2768
01:55:45.931 --> 01:55:47.960
<v Speaker 2>but there's no reason to kill a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2769
01:55:48.180 --> 01:55:50.280
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever had bear sausage?</v>

2770
01:55:50.490 --> 01:55:51.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2771
01:55:51.061 --> 01:55:53.600
<v Speaker 2>if you've had bear saw and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably happen.</v>

2772
01:55:53.610 --> 01:55:54.480
<v Speaker 2>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2773
01:55:54.730 --> 01:55:56.880
<v Speaker 2>if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Goddamn good.</v>

2774
01:55:57.210 --> 01:56:00.720
<v Speaker 2>And why is it any different?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same.</v>

2775
01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Why is it any different?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2776
01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:03.120
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2777
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:07.440
<v Speaker 2>so it's just what they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just what they're ingrained to feel</v>

2778
01:56:07.441 --> 01:56:08.640
<v Speaker 2>about an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2779
01:56:09.010 --> 01:56:09.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2780
01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:12.900
<v Speaker 2>they seem to dog like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

2781
01:56:12.901 --> 01:56:13.734
<v Speaker 2>that's a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing with people that bears </v>

2782
01:56:15.631 --> 01:56:16.464
<v Speaker 2>or seem dog like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well they're portrayed as being nice </v>

2783
01:56:19.351 --> 01:56:20.184
<v Speaker 2>and the people have them for pets too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of people that have </v>

2784
01:56:22.861 --> 01:56:23.694
<v Speaker 2>bears pets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a of Russian design up people and </v>

2785
01:56:25.761 --> 01:56:27.810
<v Speaker 2>man on instagram.</v>

2786
01:56:27.810 --> 01:56:28.530
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Them.</v>

2787
01:56:28.530 --> 01:56:29.363
<v Speaker 2>This is one motherfucker as a giant </v>
<v Speaker 2>grizzly bear that he cuddles with and </v>

2788
01:56:32.370 --> 01:56:33.990
<v Speaker 2>people keep sending me videos of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

2789
01:56:33.991 --> 01:56:35.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day,</v>

2790
01:56:35.220 --> 01:56:37.890
<v Speaker 2>I know I say this video is going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>dark.</v>

2791
01:56:38.180 --> 01:56:39.870
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2792
01:56:39.871 --> 01:56:42.100
<v Speaker 2>look at this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got a sweet bear.</v>

2793
01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:45.120
<v Speaker 2>Just chilling with this bird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this bird month moon.</v>

2794
01:56:45.410 --> 01:56:49.350
<v Speaker 2>When we hung out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my girlfriend,</v>

2795
01:56:49.670 --> 01:56:52.860
<v Speaker 2>no rubbers back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one day my baby.</v>

2796
01:56:53.070 --> 01:56:57.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2797
01:56:57.180 --> 01:57:00.330
<v Speaker 2>It looks like it looks like a cool bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dope bear.</v>

2798
01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:02.090
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking awesome animals man.</v>

2799
01:57:02.430 --> 01:57:04.620
<v Speaker 2>I love all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2800
01:57:04.740 --> 01:57:07.710
<v Speaker 2>But here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had a thousand of those living in</v>

2801
01:57:07.711 --> 01:57:09.330
<v Speaker 2>your neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to thin the herd.</v>

2802
01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:10.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just have to,</v>

2803
01:57:10.630 --> 01:57:11.463
<v Speaker 2>and the reality of all this stuff is </v>
<v Speaker 2>super complex and I just do not think </v>

2804
01:57:15.961 --> 01:57:18.660
<v Speaker 2>you get an understanding of it from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2805
01:57:19.170 --> 01:57:21.000
<v Speaker 2>in front of your laptop in Vancouver.</v>

2806
01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:22.680
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know for sure.</v>

2807
01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:24.870
<v Speaker 2>What I like is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2808
01:57:25.050 --> 01:57:25.883
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with regard to like this international </v>

2809
01:57:28.411 --> 01:57:30.990
<v Speaker 2>wildlife council or even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2810
01:57:31.230 --> 01:57:32.063
<v Speaker 2>it just seems like with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration and people say good or </v>

2811
01:57:35.761 --> 01:57:39.540
<v Speaker 2>bad or mostly bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels like you're listening to about,</v>

2812
01:57:39.870 --> 01:57:40.703
<v Speaker 2>and that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing that I would read cnn </v>

2813
01:57:42.641 --> 01:57:45.150
<v Speaker 2>and I listened to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the same topic,</v>

2814
01:57:45.540 --> 01:57:47.850
<v Speaker 2>two totally different slants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like what the hell?</v>

2815
01:57:48.150 --> 01:57:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Who Do you believe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I was happy to be involved</v>

2816
01:57:50.731 --> 01:57:54.030
<v Speaker 2>so I can actually hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But still it's still hard.</v>

2817
01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:57.210
<v Speaker 2>It's still hard to listen and think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2818
01:57:57.211 --> 01:57:58.830
<v Speaker 2>so what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2819
01:57:58.890 --> 01:57:59.723
<v Speaker 2>but with my whole thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of look at it is if I got </v>

2820
01:58:05.551 --> 01:58:10.551
<v Speaker 2>somebody online giving me advice or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>give me advice,</v>

2821
01:58:11.370 --> 01:58:13.080
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well Joe knows me.</v>

2822
01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:14.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to listen to him.</v>

2823
01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:15.173
<v Speaker 2>That's why I kind of want her to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in these councils and in this </v>

2824
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:19.223
<v Speaker 2>part of this decision making because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can listen to all of this people </v>

2825
01:58:21.631 --> 01:58:22.464
<v Speaker 2>talking shit all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I'm there and can actually weigh </v>

2826
01:58:26.161 --> 01:58:27.570
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll then they know me.</v>

2827
01:58:27.571 --> 01:58:28.410
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2828
01:58:28.650 --> 01:58:29.483
<v Speaker 2>it might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should weigh a little more and they </v>

2829
01:58:31.021 --> 01:58:32.120
<v Speaker 2>know your experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2830
01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:33.353
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why I want to be involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying I'm going to agree and </v>

2831
01:58:37.461 --> 01:58:39.210
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be exactly what I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>every time.</v>

2832
01:58:39.211 --> 01:58:41.070
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2833
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:42.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how else</v>

2834
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.450
<v Speaker 4>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how else to do it.</v>

2835
01:58:43.451 --> 01:58:46.060
<v Speaker 4>And I know that with my voice because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2836
01:58:46.210 --> 01:58:49.630
<v Speaker 4>they have trusted me about whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if they agree or don't agree,</v>

2837
01:58:49.631 --> 01:58:52.540
<v Speaker 4>I'll at least get to share my thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's what I did.</v>

2838
01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:53.433
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when I talked with Zinky the other </v>

2839
01:58:55.570 --> 01:58:56.440
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does he like?</v>

2840
01:58:57.640 --> 01:58:59.020
<v Speaker 4>That's what he's an avid hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2841
01:58:59.080 --> 01:58:59.913
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what,</v>

2842
01:59:00.040 --> 01:59:02.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've read all these man,</v>

2843
01:59:03.220 --> 01:59:06.850
<v Speaker 4>you'd think he was the word just like </v>
<v Speaker 4>trump,</v>

2844
01:59:06.910 --> 01:59:07.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

2845
01:59:07.660 --> 01:59:09.940
<v Speaker 4>you'd think they were saddened to some </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2846
01:59:10.270 --> 01:59:11.920
<v Speaker 4>But to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2847
01:59:11.921 --> 01:59:15.180
<v Speaker 4>I read the outside magazine article on </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2848
01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:17.500
<v Speaker 4>It sounded terrible and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

2849
01:59:17.501 --> 01:59:20.230
<v Speaker 4>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read a few other things about them.</v>

2850
01:59:20.231 --> 01:59:24.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to me personally is seamed,</v>

2851
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:26.680
<v Speaker 4>would listen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2852
01:59:27.070 --> 01:59:27.903
<v Speaker 4>seemed like somebody who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we were sitting there talking about </v>

2853
01:59:29.501 --> 01:59:31.750
<v Speaker 4>something and we came to a decision and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it made sense,</v>

2854
01:59:31.900 --> 01:59:34.030
<v Speaker 4>that's what it seemed like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a normal,</v>

2855
01:59:34.150 --> 01:59:36.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a well thought out person.</v>

2856
01:59:37.230 --> 01:59:38.063
<v Speaker 3>Well I think he's probably got a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount of pressure on him </v>

2857
01:59:40.591 --> 01:59:42.530
<v Speaker 3>from a bunch of different angles for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

2858
01:59:42.540 --> 01:59:43.373
<v Speaker 3>All interested in making money for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they think of someone that is pro </v>

2859
01:59:48.241 --> 01:59:51.600
<v Speaker 3>wildlife as being a roadblock to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

2860
01:59:51.710 --> 01:59:52.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2861
01:59:52.140 --> 01:59:52.973
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fucking green house loving hippy </v>

2862
01:59:56.580 --> 01:59:57.750
<v Speaker 3>tree hugging asshole.</v>

2863
01:59:58.600 --> 01:59:59.433
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he told me is he's concerned he </v>

2864
02:00:02.471 --> 02:00:06.250
<v Speaker 4>wants to increase hunting opportunities </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2865
02:00:07.020 --> 02:00:09.760
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>public land opportunities,</v>

2866
02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:12.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's,</v>

2867
02:00:12.580 --> 02:00:14.530
<v Speaker 4>and that's kind of what I want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>

2868
02:00:14.531 --> 02:00:16.570
<v Speaker 4>maybe what would of who you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

2869
02:00:16.571 --> 02:00:20.710
<v Speaker 4>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it sounds as sounds good.</v>

2870
02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:21.573
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gave me a better feeling talking to </v>

2871
02:00:23.281 --> 02:00:26.500
<v Speaker 4>them then reading the other articles and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the articles about him.</v>

2872
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:27.460
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2873
02:00:27.461 --> 02:00:29.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the,</v>

2874
02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:31.450
<v Speaker 4>his staff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great people,</v>

2875
02:00:31.690 --> 02:00:32.523
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like we'd sit here and talk and it </v>

2876
02:00:34.221 --> 02:00:35.054
<v Speaker 4>makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even talking with Donald Trump jr </v>

2877
02:00:36.851 --> 02:00:38.410
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

2878
02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:39.813
<v Speaker 4>I wish we could just do this right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's like you can actually come </v>

2879
02:00:42.701 --> 02:00:45.310
<v Speaker 4>to a consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make a decision,</v>

2880
02:00:45.670 --> 02:00:48.130
<v Speaker 4>talk it through and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how it should be,</v>

2881
02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:49.460
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it seems,</v>

2882
02:00:49.510 --> 02:00:50.343
<v Speaker 4>it feels like it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Politics are different because </v>

2883
02:00:53.530 --> 02:00:54.970
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

2884
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:59.860
<v Speaker 4>there's pressure from different places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when I think of a politician,</v>

2885
02:00:59.861 --> 02:01:00.521
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2886
02:01:00.521 --> 02:01:03.480
<v Speaker 4>special interest groups and these other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that,</v>

2887
02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:04.413
<v Speaker 4>that are influenced him and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>wondering why is this for their own </v>

2888
02:01:07.330 --> 02:01:09.670
<v Speaker 4>benefit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you don't really know with this,</v>

2889
02:01:09.730 --> 02:01:10.563
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't feel like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels like it's trying to make the </v>

2890
02:01:13.661 --> 02:01:15.100
<v Speaker 4>right decision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2891
02:01:15.101 --> 02:01:15.934
<v Speaker 4>without being influenced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know there's always gonna be </v>

2892
02:01:17.321 --> 02:01:18.154
<v Speaker 4>influenced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but without like the special interest </v>

2893
02:01:19.511 --> 02:01:20.344
<v Speaker 4>type influence,</v>

2894
02:01:20.530 --> 02:01:21.281
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2895
02:01:21.281 --> 02:01:25.060
<v Speaker 3>I think the more people like you that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are involved in this and the more people</v>

2896
02:01:25.061 --> 02:01:26.500
<v Speaker 3>like you have a say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least,</v>

2897
02:01:26.501 --> 02:01:27.334
<v Speaker 3>or they'd come to you for advice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get it at least a more </v>

2898
02:01:31.091 --> 02:01:31.924
<v Speaker 3>balanced perspective of what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential hazards are and what's </v>

2899
02:01:35.621 --> 02:01:37.660
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we need to concentrate on.</v>

2900
02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:40.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think regardless</v>

2901
02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:44.990
<v Speaker 5>of what you sing about trump,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what people were excited about about him</v>

2902
02:01:44.991 --> 02:01:48.440
<v Speaker 5>as a president would be that the economy</v>
<v Speaker 5>would have an upswing and it did.</v>

2903
02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:49.933
<v Speaker 5>But lately the last couple of days has </v>
<v Speaker 5>been a massive decline in the stock </v>

2904
02:01:53.301 --> 02:01:54.134
<v Speaker 5>market.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Has been yesterday I think was the </v>

2905
02:01:55.551 --> 02:01:58.580
<v Speaker 5>biggest loss ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand the stock market.</v>

2906
02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:00.093
<v Speaker 5>I really don't get it at a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>assholes throwing their hands in the </v>

2907
02:02:01.911 --> 02:02:02.744
<v Speaker 5>air.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's computers that are doing a lot </v>

2908
02:02:03.501 --> 02:02:07.700
<v Speaker 5>of the calculation that's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's too fucking confusing.</v>

2909
02:02:07.730 --> 02:02:09.980
<v Speaker 5>I feel like if I just went down that </v>
<v Speaker 5>rabbit hole,</v>

2910
02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:10.993
<v Speaker 5>I'd be stuck studying the stock market </v>
<v Speaker 5>for weeks upon weeks and I just don't </v>

2911
02:02:13.941 --> 02:02:15.110
<v Speaker 5>have that kind of time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

2912
02:02:15.111 --> 02:02:18.530
<v Speaker 5>I gotta play techno hunt with Cam hands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well and I like,</v>

2913
02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:19.910
<v Speaker 5>I like reading stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2914
02:02:20.050 --> 02:02:20.883
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the stock market's at an all time high </v>

2915
02:02:22.130 --> 02:02:23.180
<v Speaker 5>and he's making money.</v>

2916
02:02:23.250 --> 02:02:24.890
<v Speaker 5>That's all I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I heard that.</v>

2917
02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:26.690
<v Speaker 5>Nothing but that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like jobs,</v>

2918
02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:29.300
<v Speaker 5>like more jobs than ever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2919
02:02:29.301 --> 02:02:31.220
<v Speaker 5>Unemployments and all time low.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2920
02:02:31.221 --> 02:02:32.210
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2921
02:02:32.211 --> 02:02:37.160
<v Speaker 5>when you have a guy who was just so hell</v>
<v Speaker 5>bent on making money in business,</v>

2922
02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:38.840
<v Speaker 5>it's good for business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2923
02:02:38.841 --> 02:02:41.330
<v Speaker 5>So like that would be the benefit of </v>
<v Speaker 5>having a guy like that.</v>

2924
02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:45.710
<v Speaker 5>But then apparently there's some </v>
<v Speaker 5>downsides to that shit and the downsides</v>

2925
02:02:45.711 --> 02:02:46.544
<v Speaker 5>are inflation and a panic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then once the stock market starts </v>

2926
02:02:51.171 --> 02:02:53.600
<v Speaker 5>going south and people start freaking </v>
<v Speaker 5>out,</v>

2927
02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:57.560
<v Speaker 5>then it really goes south and now it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>really gone south.</v>

2928
02:02:57.620 --> 02:02:58.453
<v Speaker 5>Well last couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's like I live in the moment </v>

2929
02:03:02.191 --> 02:03:03.024
<v Speaker 5>and campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not here for your fucking rosy view </v>

2930
02:03:05.991 --> 02:03:07.400
<v Speaker 5>of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>

2931
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:09.050
<v Speaker 5>I don't even understand the stock </v>
<v Speaker 5>market.</v>

2932
02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:10.820
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2933
02:03:10.821 --> 02:03:12.320
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like hearing good news.</v>

2934
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:13.190
<v Speaker 5>That's what I like hearing.</v>

2935
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:14.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>

2936
02:03:14.460 --> 02:03:17.030
<v Speaker 5>I like I get comforted here and people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2937
02:03:17.210 --> 02:03:18.043
<v Speaker 5>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not wondering about what their </v>

2938
02:03:20.331 --> 02:03:21.890
<v Speaker 5>intentions are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2939
02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:22.753
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why I enjoyed the discussions </v>

2940
02:03:24.171 --> 02:03:25.640
<v Speaker 5>with those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Yeah.</v>

2942
02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:28.660
<v Speaker 5>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just said,</v>

2943
02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:29.673
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it feels like as sportsman we took a </v>

2944
02:03:30.561 --> 02:03:31.394
<v Speaker 5>couple of hits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we could use something on the positive </v>

2945
02:03:32.991 --> 02:03:34.820
<v Speaker 5>side and I think we're getting that on </v>
<v Speaker 5>Friday.</v>

2946
02:03:34.821 --> 02:03:35.654
<v Speaker 5>So that's so on Friday are they gonna </v>
<v Speaker 5>make new rules in terms of what you can </v>

2947
02:03:38.931 --> 02:03:41.300
<v Speaker 5>bring back and what you can't bring back</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea behind it?</v>

2948
02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:42.830
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not about the international.</v>

2949
02:03:42.831 --> 02:03:45.210
<v Speaker 5>This is about the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the core doors.</v>

2950
02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:46.393
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 5>So protection per protecting migration </v>
<v Speaker 5>routes for the big game animals here.</v>

2952
02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:54.830
<v Speaker 5>That's very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very important.</v>

2953
02:03:55.220 --> 02:03:56.053
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially for animals like mule deer </v>

2954
02:03:57.981 --> 02:03:59.930
<v Speaker 5>whose populations aren't really that </v>
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>

2955
02:03:59.931 --> 02:04:00.730
<v Speaker 5>But now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2956
02:04:00.730 --> 02:04:04.070
<v Speaker 5>the elk elk still need to be able to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of the high country out from,</v>

2957
02:04:04.090 --> 02:04:06.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where they breed down when the weather,</v>

2958
02:04:06.710 --> 02:04:10.880
<v Speaker 5>when the weather hits to get down to </v>
<v Speaker 5>where the feed is and if there's a bunch</v>

2959
02:04:10.881 --> 02:04:13.580
<v Speaker 5>of gas rigs in there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>knock me able to do it.</v>

2965
02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:24.433
<v Speaker 5>And they're huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These people are just hanging out near </v>

2966
02:04:28.341 --> 02:04:29.174
<v Speaker 5>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know they have zero fear of people I </v>

2967
02:04:31.911 --> 02:04:32.744
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they know that once they're in the </v>

2968
02:04:33.261 --> 02:04:35.670
<v Speaker 5>town that's like they're on home base </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2969
02:04:35.780 --> 02:04:38.010
<v Speaker 5>They're safe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird how they know that,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I did.</v>

2972
02:04:40.410 --> 02:04:41.243
<v Speaker 5>I did see that there are some nice </v>
<v Speaker 5>animals in their crazy beautiful people </v>

2973
02:04:44.581 --> 02:04:47.760

<v Speaker 5>they're screaming and running.</v>

2974
02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:50.790
<v Speaker 5>We're that they just migrate right </v>
<v Speaker 5>through the town.</v>

2975
02:04:50.850 --> 02:04:53.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they probably figured out a long time</v>

2976
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:54.030
<v Speaker 5>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2983
02:05:05.371 --> 02:05:07.650
<v Speaker 5>property,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's like more than an acre.</v>

2986
02:05:13.740 --> 02:05:14.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2987
02:05:14.670 --> 02:05:16.920
<v Speaker 5>I think that's exactly why they made </v>
<v Speaker 5>those rules.</v>

2988
02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:20.130
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's by section,</v>

2989
02:05:20.150 --> 02:05:21.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by unit,</v>

2990
02:05:21.330 --> 02:05:23.130
<v Speaker 5>depending upon where you're at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2991
02:05:23.220 --> 02:05:26.610
<v Speaker 5>But in some places you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you literally can hunt in your backyard.</v>

2992
02:05:26.611 --> 02:05:29.940
<v Speaker 5>So I would imagine the elk avoid those </v>
<v Speaker 5>places.</v>

2993
02:05:30.420 --> 02:05:32.090
<v Speaker 5>I would think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They live pretty quick.</v>

2994
02:05:32.550 --> 02:05:33.383
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it interesting they learn quick?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's the one of the things that </v>

2995
02:05:35.491 --> 02:05:37.740
<v Speaker 5>they said about reintroduction of wolves</v>
<v Speaker 5>into yellowstone,</v>

2996
02:05:37.741 --> 02:05:40.020
<v Speaker 5>they figured it out after awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They look okay.</v>

2997
02:05:40.410 --> 02:05:43.290
<v Speaker 5>Like for in the beginning they were just</v>
<v Speaker 5>sitting ducks.</v>

2998
02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:43.921
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2999
02:05:43.921 --> 02:05:44.754
<v Speaker 5>but that was in the 90s and now we're in</v>
<v Speaker 5>2018 it's essentially the ecosystem has </v>

3000
02:05:49.591 --> 02:05:50.424
<v Speaker 5>sorted itself out and there's some good </v>
<v Speaker 5>arguments that it's sorted itself out </v>

3001
02:05:53.941 --> 02:05:54.650
<v Speaker 5>for the better.</v>

3002
02:05:54.650 --> 02:05:55.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3003
02:05:55.590 --> 02:05:56.423
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3004
02:05:56.670 --> 02:06:01.380
<v Speaker 5>for the betterment of other wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 5>other plant species of the elk word,</v>

3005
02:06:01.460 --> 02:06:02.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eating a shit load of them.</v>

3006
02:06:03.210 --> 02:06:04.740
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's interesting,</v>

3007
02:06:04.830 --> 02:06:08.250
<v Speaker 5>but also you should know that where they</v>
<v Speaker 5>brought those wolves back,</v>

3008
02:06:08.251 --> 02:06:09.440
<v Speaker 5>you can't hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3009
02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:12.780
<v Speaker 5>Cause this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the greater yellowstone eco systems,</v>

3010
02:06:12.781 --> 02:06:14.940
<v Speaker 5>like it's all protected.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3011
02:06:14.970 --> 02:06:16.620
<v Speaker 5>So maybe they needed him there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3012
02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:18.230
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3013
02:06:18.780 --> 02:06:20.730
<v Speaker 5>Just don't bring them Colorado fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't do it.</v>

3014
02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:22.140
<v Speaker 5>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tell him to it.</v>

3015
02:06:22.860 --> 02:06:25.800
<v Speaker 5>So what else are you going to discuss </v>
<v Speaker 5>with Zinky?</v>

3016
02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:26.753
<v Speaker 5>How often do you meet?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what does this job entail or this </v>

3017
02:06:29.311 --> 02:06:33.240
<v Speaker 5>position entails on that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Council says there's,</v>

3018
02:06:33.630 --> 02:06:34.463
<v Speaker 5>you meet twice a year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I didn't really know what about or </v>

3019
02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:40.020
<v Speaker 5>when that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

3020
02:06:40.021 --> 02:06:42.340
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for me and my,</v>

3021
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:44.890
<v Speaker 5>my whole thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3022
02:06:44.910 --> 02:06:48.360
<v Speaker 5>if I want to get to know somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to have them do what I do.</v>

3023
02:06:48.780 --> 02:06:49.613
<v Speaker 5>It's like you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so he says he has a bow and I'm </v>

3024
02:06:52.771 --> 02:06:53.604
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

3025
02:06:53.760 --> 02:06:54.720
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what kind of bow?</v>

3026
02:06:54.810 --> 02:06:56.160
<v Speaker 5>He told me kind of battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3027
02:06:56.310 --> 02:06:56.880
<v Speaker 5>what kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3028
02:06:56.880 --> 02:06:57.750
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3029
02:06:57.751 --> 02:07:00.390
<v Speaker 5>what did he have?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a horse got one.</v>

3030
02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:03.060
<v Speaker 5>Now it's an old ball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

3031
02:07:03.090 --> 02:07:05.160
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can eat like a high country,</v>

3032
02:07:05.250 --> 02:07:06.180
<v Speaker 5>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3033
02:07:06.210 --> 02:07:07.960
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'm like [inaudible].</v>

3034
02:07:08.210 --> 02:07:09.001
<v Speaker 5>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

3035
02:07:09.001 --> 02:07:09.870
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

3036
02:07:09.871 --> 02:07:11.220
<v Speaker 5>you want to shoot that Bo?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

3037
02:07:11.221 --> 02:07:11.761
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

3038
02:07:11.761 --> 02:07:14.190
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll hook them up with hoyt.</v>

3041
02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:20.030
<v Speaker 5>I can't take gifts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I said,</v>

3042
02:07:20.060 --> 02:07:21.390
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause I said that and I,</v>

3043
02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:22.380
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

3044
02:07:22.381 --> 02:07:23.520
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't worry about that.</v>

3045
02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:25.260
<v Speaker 5>I go to shoot your bow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

3046
02:07:25.261 --> 02:07:28.800
<v Speaker 5>how about if I come back in a two d c </v>
<v Speaker 5>there and we,</v>

3047
02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:32.640
<v Speaker 5>and we shoot bows and can't give,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't give him a gift as a friend.</v>

3048
02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:36.130
<v Speaker 5>I don't know that it's maybe from a </v>
<v Speaker 5>would be an issue.</v>

3049
02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:37.810
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3050
02:07:37.811 --> 02:07:40.900
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taking whatever you can only take bribes</v>

3051
02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:43.690
<v Speaker 2>under the table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take gifts,</v>

3052
02:07:43.720 --> 02:07:45.880
<v Speaker 2>can't have that actual bow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that funny?</v>

3053
02:07:45.881 --> 02:07:48.580
<v Speaker 2>You could take campaign contributions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3054
02:07:48.610 --> 02:07:50.310
<v Speaker 2>But not about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't take a boat.</v>

3055
02:07:50.311 --> 02:07:51.144
<v Speaker 2>You could have lobbyists that are on </v>
<v Speaker 2>staff that are trying to get cached and </v>

3056
02:07:54.401 --> 02:07:56.770
<v Speaker 2>working those special interest groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on baby.</v>

3057
02:07:56.890 --> 02:07:57.723
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so next is a bow we talked about next </v>

<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3063
02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:10.270
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3064
02:08:10.300 --> 02:08:12.130
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to make that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3065
02:08:12.131 --> 02:08:12.964
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3066
02:08:13.060 --> 02:08:13.893
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

3067
02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:14.793
<v Speaker 2>if you have somebody's ear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just want to be able to tell them </v>

3068
02:08:17.261 --> 02:08:18.820
<v Speaker 2>what's important to you and that's all I</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to do.</v>

3069
02:08:18.821 --> 02:08:23.020
<v Speaker 2>But I can do that generally better over </v>
<v Speaker 2>something I care about,</v>

3070
02:08:23.021 --> 02:08:27.940
<v Speaker 2>like archery or running or lifting </v>
<v Speaker 2>weights or whatever like that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>in talking to you,</v>

3104
02:09:38.891 --> 02:09:41.560
<v Speaker 2>I said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems weird to say,</v>

3105
02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:46.510
<v Speaker 2>but seem like a normal gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is your dad's a billionaire.</v>

3106
02:09:46.511 --> 02:09:47.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is he a billionaire?</v>

3107
02:09:47.441 --> 02:09:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3108
02:09:48.550 --> 02:09:52.330
<v Speaker 2>So doesn't that seem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems surprising.</v>

3109
02:09:52.331 --> 02:09:55.820
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems like just like we would be right.</v>

3110
02:09:55.960 --> 02:09:58.420
<v Speaker 2>Total normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>

3111
02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:00.820
<v Speaker 2>I fall on my instagram.</v>

3112
02:10:00.820 --> 02:10:03.550
<v Speaker 2>I see that the pictures of his daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super cute,</v>

3113
02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:04.413
<v Speaker 2>the fishing pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I saw him on Tucker Carlson the </v>

3114
02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:10.570
<v Speaker 2>other night and I told them this and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were talking in Vegas and he was like,</v>

3115
02:10:11.020 --> 02:10:11.853
<v Speaker 2>just laying it down for a one minute </v>
<v Speaker 2>clip on instagram on Tucker Carlson was </v>

3116
02:10:15.791 --> 02:10:18.670
<v Speaker 2>to Fox News and laying it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3117
02:10:18.730 --> 02:10:19.563
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never really had followed his </v>

3118
02:10:21.581 --> 02:10:24.700
<v Speaker 2>political or is his public speaking type</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

3119
02:10:24.970 --> 02:10:26.680
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy crap,</v>

3120
02:10:26.681 --> 02:10:27.514
<v Speaker 2>this guy is pretty dialed in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably the plan it takes over </v>

3121
02:10:30.281 --> 02:10:31.990
<v Speaker 2>when he might retire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might,</v>

3122
02:10:31.991 --> 02:10:33.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's 40 so he's just kind of getting his</v>

3123
02:10:33.741 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 2>feet</v>

3124
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:34.813
<v Speaker 5>under slides right in and that world and</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump dynasty just like they did with </v>

3125
02:10:38.271 --> 02:10:40.180
<v Speaker 5>the bushes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

3126
02:10:40.181 --> 02:10:42.910
<v Speaker 5>Just know all of up Clinton's clenches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3127
02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:43.753
<v Speaker 5>once you're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like that's all they want is not </v>

3128
02:10:45.590 --> 02:10:47.060
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

3129
02:10:47.061 --> 02:10:48.950
<v Speaker 5>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would feel,</v>

3130
02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:52.510
<v Speaker 5>I mean man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that's what said electrical guy.</v>

3131
02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:55.130
<v Speaker 5>I wish the don junior was running for </v>
<v Speaker 5>president.</v>

3132
02:10:55.190 --> 02:10:57.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's don junior is very reasonable.</v>

3133
02:10:57.200 --> 02:10:58.500
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>

3134
02:10:58.710 --> 02:11:01.220
<v Speaker 5>Totally funny if he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if he says one thing wrong,</v>

3135
02:11:01.250 --> 02:11:03.890
<v Speaker 5>one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one slip up of a word,</v>

3136
02:11:03.891 --> 02:11:05.870
<v Speaker 5>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody does every day.</v>

3137
02:11:05.871 --> 02:11:06.890
<v Speaker 5>I do it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3138
02:11:06.891 --> 02:11:07.724
<v Speaker 5>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One one slip up of the word Corey </v>

3139
02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:12.740
<v Speaker 5>Knowlton right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One fuck up like that.</v>

3140
02:11:12.980 --> 02:11:14.900
<v Speaker 5>And then this done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3141
02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:17.240
<v Speaker 5>you see all this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this magnified,</v>

3142
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:22.100
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous hate that comes his way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the attacks against him.</v>

3143
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:24.020
<v Speaker 5>And people are people right now </v>
<v Speaker 5>listening to this,</v>

3144
02:11:24.021 --> 02:11:27.010
<v Speaker 5>probably yelling at them because they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking Joe's to Ford.</v>

3145
02:11:28.090 --> 02:11:31.510
<v Speaker 5>Here's a show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's yet.</v>

3146
02:11:31.660 --> 02:11:32.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

3147
02:11:32.170 --> 02:11:33.050
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3148
02:11:33.170 --> 02:11:36.860
<v Speaker 5>I mean it is really hard not to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>pissed off.</v>

3149
02:11:36.890 --> 02:11:37.723
<v Speaker 5>What's really hard to be unbiased?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really hard to just have enough </v>

3150
02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:41.853
<v Speaker 5>amounts perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I don't think anybody does a good </v>

3151
02:11:43.431 --> 02:11:44.264
<v Speaker 5>job as president.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen a single person do it </v>

3152
02:11:45.711 --> 02:11:49.010
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen Obama give very good speeches.</v>

3153
02:11:49.011 --> 02:11:51.520
<v Speaker 5>I think he's very statesman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I think he's,</v>

3154
02:11:51.521 --> 02:11:52.354
<v Speaker 5>he's very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what Obama did that was a excellent was </v>

3155
02:11:55.611 --> 02:11:56.444
<v Speaker 5>he was very composed and articulate and </v>
<v Speaker 5>smooth and he represented a highly </v>

3156
02:12:03.531 --> 02:12:04.364
<v Speaker 5>educated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a high level of human being in </v>

3157
02:12:07.851 --> 02:12:10.340
<v Speaker 5>terms of his intellect and the way he </v>
<v Speaker 5>carries himself.</v>

3158
02:12:10.730 --> 02:12:13.070
<v Speaker 5>And I think that that's good for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>country,</v>

3159
02:12:13.340 --> 02:12:14.173
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think the way you look at the </v>

3160
02:12:15.291 --> 02:12:17.690
<v Speaker 5>drone attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you look at the attacks on,</v>

3161
02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:18.853
<v Speaker 5>on whistle blowers and on the press,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there was a lot of bad shit about </v>

3162
02:12:22.161 --> 02:12:22.994
<v Speaker 5>the Obama administration and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 5>wants to sleep sweep under the rug </v>

3163
02:12:25.101 --> 02:12:27.050
<v Speaker 5>because I think nobody's a good </v>
<v Speaker 5>president.</v>

3164
02:12:27.050 --> 02:12:29.780
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a terrible job at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't like how he,</v>

3165
02:12:29.810 --> 02:12:33.260
<v Speaker 5>he sort of started a war on cops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You remember when he was,</v>

3166
02:12:33.380 --> 02:12:34.940
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cruise fine,</v>

3167
02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:37.910
<v Speaker 5>some of the arrest they had and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>started,</v>

3168
02:12:38.060 --> 02:12:38.893
<v Speaker 5>people were looking at cops thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are the good guys are the bad </v>

3169
02:12:40.521 --> 02:12:41.354
<v Speaker 5>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't like that because maybe there </v>

3170
02:12:43.401 --> 02:12:45.230
<v Speaker 5>are some bad cops,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's bad.</v>

3171
02:12:45.260 --> 02:12:47.420
<v Speaker 5>Everything you do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every job has bad,</v>

3172
02:12:47.421 --> 02:12:48.530
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So hundred percent.</v>

3173
02:12:48.531 --> 02:12:52.350
<v Speaker 5>Instead of highlighting that people out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there protecting our interests in,</v>

3174
02:12:52.351 --> 02:12:55.810
<v Speaker 5>in serving the public,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was highlighting the quote,</v>

3175
02:12:55.850 --> 02:12:59.270
<v Speaker 5>bad cops I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it put them all in a bad light.</v>

3176
02:12:59.271 --> 02:13:01.190
<v Speaker 5>I didn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas trump,</v>

3177
02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:02.840
<v Speaker 5>he knows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3178
02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:08.200
<v Speaker 5>he's highlighting good police work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's highlighting the military.</v>

3179
02:13:08.451 --> 02:13:09.320
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3180
02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:10.870
<v Speaker 5>pride in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in Ah,</v>

3181
02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:13.760
<v Speaker 5>the good old United States of America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like that.</v>

3182
02:13:14.060 --> 02:13:16.100
<v Speaker 5>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I dunno.</v>

3183
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:16.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3184
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:18.800
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing that drove me nuts,</v>

3185
02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:22.100
<v Speaker 5>the most nuts about Obama was that crazy</v>
<v Speaker 5>speech that he said,</v>

3186
02:13:22.130 --> 02:13:24.830
<v Speaker 5>if you have a business that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>choose the highway,</v>

3187
02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:25.970
<v Speaker 5>you didn't build up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3188
02:13:25.980 --> 02:13:27.260
<v Speaker 5>You didn't build that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>build that business.</v>

3189
02:13:27.700 --> 02:13:29.990
<v Speaker 5>You don't build that like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is,</v>

3190
02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:32.730
<v Speaker 5>that is the craziest way to look at </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

3191
02:13:32.750 --> 02:13:34.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I was his friend,</v>

3192
02:13:34.771 --> 02:13:35.640
<v Speaker 5>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3193
02:13:36.930 --> 02:13:37.763
<v Speaker 5>this is not the way to say what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he started like highlight the </v>

3194
02:13:41.611 --> 02:13:43.650
<v Speaker 5>victim mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's a victim.</v>

3195
02:13:43.830 --> 02:13:46.380
<v Speaker 5>Whereas I like trump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

3196
02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:49.050
<v Speaker 5>you're in control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's your opportunity.</v>

3197
02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:52.350
<v Speaker 5>Make the most of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would see it very differently.</v>

3198
02:13:52.351 --> 02:13:53.184
<v Speaker 5>I would have said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have a business and you start at </v>

3199
02:13:55.141 --> 02:13:56.520
<v Speaker 5>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>congratulations.</v>

3200
02:13:56.521 --> 02:13:58.680
<v Speaker 5>This is what American ingenuity is all </v>
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

3201
02:13:58.681 --> 02:13:59.514
<v Speaker 5>but we all have to be aware,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not just you not singing that person so </v>

3202
02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:03.510
<v Speaker 5>you didn't build up.</v>

3203
02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:04.433
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say we all have to be aware of </v>

3204
02:14:06.241 --> 02:14:07.980
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Without our infrastructure,</v>

3205
02:14:07.981 --> 02:14:09.360
<v Speaker 5>we would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>none of us would be able to do that.</v>

3206
02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:14.340
<v Speaker 5>So we all have to support this beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 5>system that we have in an empowering way</v>

3207
02:14:14.341 --> 02:14:15.600
<v Speaker 5>instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't do it,</v>

3208
02:14:15.780 --> 02:14:16.900
<v Speaker 5>you didn't build it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3209
02:14:17.790 --> 02:14:20.190
<v Speaker 5>Taking credit away from people who </v>
<v Speaker 5>worked their ass off.</v>

3210
02:14:20.540 --> 02:14:23.880
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a guy who's never been in business,</v>

3211
02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:24.733
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just,</v>

3212
02:14:24.900 --> 02:14:25.733
<v Speaker 5>he's a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He went from being a lawyer to being a </v>

3213
02:14:27.690 --> 02:14:29.850
<v Speaker 5>professional politician to being the </v>
<v Speaker 5>president.</v>

3214
02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:30.271
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bam,</v>

3215
02:14:30.271 --> 02:14:31.104
<v Speaker 5>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bam.</v>

3216
02:14:31.110 --> 02:14:31.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

3217
02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:34.230
<v Speaker 5>that's one thing I don't like is people </v>
<v Speaker 5>who are like,</v>

3218
02:14:34.260 --> 02:14:37.080
<v Speaker 5>their goal is to be a politician.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3219
02:14:37.170 --> 02:14:39.660
<v Speaker 5>I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd like it if they were awesome at it,</v>

3220
02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:43.050
<v Speaker 5>but no one that I like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like the best.</v>

3221
02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:44.640
<v Speaker 5>Like even back in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3222
02:14:44.641 --> 02:14:45.331
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3223
02:14:45.331 --> 02:14:46.640
<v Speaker 5>when our country was founded,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

3224
02:14:46.710 --> 02:14:48.090
<v Speaker 5>those weren't politicians.</v>

3225
02:14:48.090 --> 02:14:48.923
<v Speaker 5>Those were guys who had influenced,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who made good decisions and then they </v>

3226
02:14:51.721 --> 02:14:53.640
<v Speaker 5>were politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3227
02:14:54.630 --> 02:14:57.210
<v Speaker 5>I've been watching vikings a lot lately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's new.</v>

3228
02:14:57.211 --> 02:14:58.830
<v Speaker 5>Show up and watch him gay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3229
02:14:58.831 --> 02:15:02.430
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems like there's no good leaders in</v>

3230
02:15:02.431 --> 02:15:04.080
<v Speaker 5>the Viking world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was bad leaders.</v>

3231
02:15:04.230 --> 02:15:05.730
<v Speaker 5>This leader suck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants,</v>

3232
02:15:05.790 --> 02:15:06.623
<v Speaker 5>nobody wants a Goddamn leader.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when you're a leader of 350 million </v>

3233
02:15:10.261 --> 02:15:11.610
<v Speaker 5>people or whatever the hell we have </v>
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>

3234
02:15:13.020 --> 02:15:13.853
<v Speaker 5>it's just impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make any sense what's going </v>

3235
02:15:15.421 --> 02:15:16.254
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie?</v>

3236
02:15:16.380 --> 02:15:19.050
<v Speaker 5>I just looked up that quote out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>context,</v>

3237
02:15:20.580 --> 02:15:22.890
<v Speaker 5>but he said it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said those two sentences,</v>

3238
02:15:22.891 --> 02:15:24.570
<v Speaker 5>but not in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3239
02:15:24.571 --> 02:15:28.790
<v Speaker 5>if you've got a business they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and build up a fake news.</v>

3240
02:15:29.340 --> 02:15:31.170
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what is the actual quote?</v>

3241
02:15:31.700 --> 02:15:33.180
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's her?</v>

3242
02:15:33.181 --> 02:15:34.014
<v Speaker 5>The real quote.</v>

3243
02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:38.850
<v Speaker 5>If you were successful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody lung,</v>

3244
02:15:38.851 --> 02:15:39.321
<v Speaker 5>lung,</v>

<v Speaker 5>there was a great teacher,</v>

3246
02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:42.630
<v Speaker 5>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what does it,</v>

3247
02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:44.490
<v Speaker 5>if you've got a business,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't build that.</v>

3248
02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:47.130
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody invested in roads and bridges.</v>

3249
02:15:47.250 --> 02:15:48.090
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here it is.</v>

3250
02:15:48.810 --> 02:15:52.980
<v Speaker 5>Somebody helped create this unbelievable</v>
<v Speaker 5>American system that we have allowed you</v>

3251
02:15:52.981 --> 02:15:53.814
<v Speaker 5>to throw that have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3252
02:15:54.210 --> 02:15:55.043
<v Speaker 5>that we have that allowed you to thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody invested in the roads and </v>

3253
02:15:58.741 --> 02:16:00.660
<v Speaker 5>bridges.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you've got a business,</v>

3254
02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:03.700
<v Speaker 5>you didn't build that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just a shitty way to say it.</v>

3255
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:05.970
<v Speaker 5>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even in context.</v>

3256
02:16:06.150 --> 02:16:07.830
<v Speaker 5>Somebody else made that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3257
02:16:07.860 --> 02:16:09.090
<v Speaker 5>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not somebody else.</v>

3258
02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:14.100
<v Speaker 5>We all chipped in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did I know that's what he's saying.</v>

3259
02:16:14.101 --> 02:16:14.934
<v Speaker 5>But it's a shit way to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a shit disempowering way to say it </v>

3260
02:16:18.631 --> 02:16:19.610
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I don't like.</v>

3261
02:16:19.630 --> 02:16:22.650
<v Speaker 5>Takes credit away from the people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a way to do that.</v>

3262
02:16:22.651 --> 02:16:25.110
<v Speaker 5>There's a way to phrase that that needs </v>
<v Speaker 5>an edit and rewrite.</v>

3263
02:16:25.290 --> 02:16:26.123
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the fuck could even have time to do </v>

3264
02:16:28.411 --> 02:16:30.190
<v Speaker 5>that when you're writing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3265
02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:31.053
<v Speaker 3>you're writing under the pressure of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being the president of the United </v>

3266
02:16:33.370 --> 02:16:34.600
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally sympathize.</v>

3267
02:16:34.990 --> 02:16:37.480
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying I would have done better.</v>

3268
02:16:37.481 --> 02:16:39.670
<v Speaker 3>I would have done way worse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it still sucks.</v>

3269
02:16:39.910 --> 02:16:41.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not a good way to say things.</v>

3270
02:16:43.510 --> 02:16:45.040
<v Speaker 3>You're going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3271
02:16:45.460 --> 02:16:48.370
<v Speaker 3>you said you said disempowering and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly right.</v>

3272
02:16:48.371 --> 02:16:49.810
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3273
02:16:50.500 --> 02:16:53.320
<v Speaker 3>it feels like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a different tone right now.</v>

3274
02:16:53.350 --> 02:16:55.000
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3275
02:16:55.060 --> 02:16:57.220
<v Speaker 3>our president is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just say white people.</v>

3276
02:16:57.250 --> 02:16:59.470
<v Speaker 3>You like my people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that at all.</v>

3277
02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:03.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just saying nobody's perfect.</v>

3278
02:17:03.761 --> 02:17:06.550
<v Speaker 3>But I liked that part of the message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3279
02:17:06.551 --> 02:17:08.110
<v Speaker 3>he definitely has that part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>message,</v>

3280
02:17:08.111 --> 02:17:10.030
<v Speaker 3>but he's obviously said a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid shit too,</v>

3281
02:17:10.180 --> 02:17:13.240
<v Speaker 3>but he's also a guy flies off the cuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this,</v>

3282
02:17:13.660 --> 02:17:17.470
<v Speaker 3>we have to take into consideration what </v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy was his entire career.</v>

3283
02:17:17.740 --> 02:17:21.910
<v Speaker 3>He's a giant larger than life </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality with crazy hair,</v>

3284
02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:25.060
<v Speaker 3>who puts his name on everything and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>he ran for president.</v>

3285
02:17:25.420 --> 02:17:29.170
<v Speaker 3>Of course he's going to stay that guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he becomes president.</v>

3286
02:17:29.171 --> 02:17:31.240
<v Speaker 3>We go down to know now that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>

3287
02:17:31.390 --> 02:17:33.490
<v Speaker 3>it's like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're in,</v>

3288
02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:35.950
<v Speaker 3>if you're playing beauty and the beast </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're the beast,</v>

3289
02:17:36.130 --> 02:17:36.963
<v Speaker 3>you've got to act like the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you've got the role and actually at </v>

3290
02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:39.713
<v Speaker 3>the like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you still acting like hugh </v>

3291
02:17:40.631 --> 02:17:41.464
<v Speaker 3>grant?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3292
02:17:41.510 --> 02:17:42.343
<v Speaker 3>You know you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's the role of being the </v>

3293
02:17:45.401 --> 02:17:47.110
<v Speaker 3>president is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3294
02:17:47.130 --> 02:17:50.920
<v Speaker 3>this majestic top of the mountain that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we look at like,</v>

3295
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:52.100
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the guy.</v>

3296
02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:55.930
<v Speaker 3>He's the main dude where you're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to act like the president.</v>

3297
02:17:55.931 --> 02:17:56.290
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3298
02:17:56.290 --> 02:17:58.120
<v Speaker 3>that's what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not presidential.</v>

3299
02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:00.670
<v Speaker 3>He never has been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know what?</v>

3300
02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:02.630
<v Speaker 3>He's been a leader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3301
02:18:02.650 --> 02:18:04.300
<v Speaker 3>so here's what I know.</v>

3302
02:18:04.510 --> 02:18:05.343
<v Speaker 3>I don't see anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see isis over here bombing the </v>

3303
02:18:07.601 --> 02:18:10.270
<v Speaker 3>shit out of the United States anymore </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause they're almost,</v>

3304
02:18:10.390 --> 02:18:12.300
<v Speaker 3>they're all dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot.</v>

3305
02:18:12.340 --> 02:18:13.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot,</v>

3306
02:18:13.181 --> 02:18:16.180
<v Speaker 3>but they were never bombing the shit out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the United States and trying to a few</v>

3307
02:18:16.181 --> 02:18:19.120
<v Speaker 3>dummies that snuck over here and did </v>
<v Speaker 3>some stupid shit here.</v>

3308
02:18:19.150 --> 02:18:20.410
<v Speaker 3>Horrible Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3309
02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:23.770
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one thing that the military has said</v>

3310
02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:24.633
<v Speaker 3>and friends of mine that are in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>military and guys like Tim Kennedy that </v>

3311
02:18:27.281 --> 02:18:28.270
<v Speaker 3>rejoined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3312
02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:33.840
<v Speaker 3>he said that they feel like for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first time in a long time,</v>

3313
02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:35.313
<v Speaker 3>the military is basically got the </v>
<v Speaker 3>handcuffs off and that they are allowed </v>

3314
02:18:40.361 --> 02:18:44.080
<v Speaker 3>to do things the way they think would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>best.</v>

3315
02:18:44.081 --> 02:18:44.914
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of people don't like to hear </v>

3316
02:18:46.241 --> 02:18:46.991
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like to say,</v>

3317
02:18:46.991 --> 02:18:47.824
<v Speaker 3>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the politicians are supposed to control </v>

3318
02:18:49.361 --> 02:18:50.194
<v Speaker 3>the military and it's supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to allow the </v>

3319
02:18:52.361 --> 02:18:53.950
<v Speaker 3>generals to make the decisions.</v>

3320
02:18:54.350 --> 02:18:56.200
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a debate back we need,</v>

3321
02:18:56.260 --> 02:19:00.040
<v Speaker 3>and this is again like a lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>things because a very complex,</v>

3322
02:19:00.041 --> 02:19:03.100
<v Speaker 3>nuanced conversation that you'd have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have all the facts at your disposal.</v>

3323
02:19:03.340 --> 02:19:04.173
<v Speaker 3>I don't know either do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can say they're not bombing the </v>

3324
02:19:06.371 --> 02:19:09.070
<v Speaker 3>shit of the United States and sound like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a complete redneck.</v>

3325
02:19:09.390 --> 02:19:11.050
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's how I see it.</v>

3326
02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:12.153
<v Speaker 3>But I understand there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you need a stride a military </v>

3327
02:19:14.980 --> 02:19:15.813
<v Speaker 3>because the world has some dark places </v>
<v Speaker 3>and anybody who doesn't think that you </v>

3328
02:19:18.401 --> 02:19:19.234
<v Speaker 3>need a strong military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to pay attention to what the </v>

3329
02:19:21.041 --> 02:19:23.770
<v Speaker 3>fuck is going on in Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in North Korea,</v>

3330
02:19:23.771 --> 02:19:28.771
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of parts of the world where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they there chaos and this is a,</v>

3331
02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:34.160
<v Speaker 3>an entirely real possibility anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere that exists,</v>

3332
02:19:34.400 --> 02:19:35.233
<v Speaker 3>it can exist here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you see horrible tyranny and </v>

3333
02:19:37.731 --> 02:19:39.860
<v Speaker 3>destruction and chaos and other parts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>

3334
02:19:40.040 --> 02:19:43.130
<v Speaker 3>the only reason why it's not here is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of geography.</v>

3335
02:19:43.490 --> 02:19:45.560
<v Speaker 3>If they can get there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can get here.</v>

3336
02:19:45.561 --> 02:19:45.990
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

3337
02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:50.540
<v Speaker 3>if things can go sideways in Iran or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iraq or wherever the fuck it is,</v>

3338
02:19:50.690 --> 02:19:51.523
<v Speaker 3>they can go sideways in America too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't think that we need </v>

3339
02:19:53.780 --> 02:19:54.613
<v Speaker 3>military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your God damn crazy cause I would love </v>

3340
02:19:57.951 --> 02:19:58.784
<v Speaker 3>it if we didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love it if we lived in this </v>

3341
02:19:59.601 --> 02:20:01.760
<v Speaker 3>utopian world where everybody treats </v>
<v Speaker 3>people the way you were.</v>

3342
02:20:01.761 --> 02:20:02.594
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you don't have to worry about if </v>

3343
02:20:03.711 --> 02:20:04.544
<v Speaker 3>you were in our neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never worry about you invading </v>

3344
02:20:05.871 --> 02:20:06.704
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know I'd be like Oh cam is never </v>

3345
02:20:08.211 --> 02:20:10.760
<v Speaker 3>going to like bring a gun over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking take over my house.</v>

3346
02:20:10.761 --> 02:20:13.670
<v Speaker 3>He's a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the world was like that,</v>

3347
02:20:13.700 --> 02:20:15.620
<v Speaker 3>it would be wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be wonderful.</v>

3348
02:20:15.621 --> 02:20:16.454
<v Speaker 3>But right now it's not currently right </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that and people that I know like </v>

3349
02:20:19.730 --> 02:20:22.910
<v Speaker 3>Tim Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy who's been there,</v>

02:20:23.060 --> 02:20:25.190
<v Speaker 3>I was done that got like Jocko willink.</v>

3351
02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:29.150
<v Speaker 3>The guy has been there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the guys that I turned to when</v>

3352
02:20:29.151 --> 02:20:31.070
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I want to know like what's going on</v>

3353
02:20:31.071 --> 02:20:33.740
<v Speaker 3>over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to get a real perspective.</v>

3354
02:20:34.040 --> 02:20:34.873
<v Speaker 3>You want to get a real perspective for </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's been in active duty in a </v>

3355
02:20:38.481 --> 02:20:39.314
<v Speaker 3>combat situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's been to these horrific parts of </v>

3356
02:20:41.571 --> 02:20:42.404
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3357
02:20:42.950 --> 02:20:43.783
<v Speaker 3>They can tell you what's going on and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they tell you that it's a better </v>

3358
02:20:46.491 --> 02:20:49.220
<v Speaker 3>situation that the military has the </v>
<v Speaker 3>handcuffs off.</v>

3359
02:20:49.310 --> 02:20:51.230
<v Speaker 3>I listened to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good sign.</v>

3360
02:20:51.480 --> 02:20:52.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3361
02:20:53.060 --> 02:20:55.100
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to Tim at shot show and he,</v>

3362
02:20:55.130 --> 02:20:55.963
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I about going back in and he said that </v>

3363
02:20:57.891 --> 02:20:59.040
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3364
02:20:59.840 --> 02:21:00.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

3365
02:21:01.610 --> 02:21:04.070
<v Speaker 3>it feels like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

3366
02:21:04.130 --> 02:21:08.180
<v Speaker 3>it feels better that we're not having </v>
<v Speaker 3>the terrorist issues over here anymore.</v>

3367
02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:08.661
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3368
02:21:08.661 --> 02:21:10.670
<v Speaker 3>I really wish that everyone would come </v>
<v Speaker 3>back home.</v>

3369
02:21:10.670 --> 02:21:12.470
<v Speaker 3>I really wished that no one was in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan.</v>

3370
02:21:12.471 --> 02:21:14.660
<v Speaker 3>I really wished that we weren't the </v>
<v Speaker 3>police people for the world.</v>

3371
02:21:14.661 --> 02:21:15.494
<v Speaker 3>I really wished that we're not sending </v>
<v Speaker 3>young people to die and in foreign wars </v>

3372
02:21:18.861 --> 02:21:19.694
<v Speaker 3>that don't make any sense to you or I or</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody that really knows what the fuck </v>

3373
02:21:22.101 --> 02:21:22.934
<v Speaker 3>is going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is the world we live in right </v>

3374
02:21:25.161 --> 02:21:26.020
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3375
02:21:26.110 --> 02:21:28.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy it the best we can protect us,</v>

3376
02:21:28.760 --> 02:21:30.770
<v Speaker 3>protect people here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3377
02:21:30.830 --> 02:21:33.440
<v Speaker 3>And hopefully protect people there too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3378
02:21:33.441 --> 02:21:34.274
<v Speaker 3>it's just now that's why you got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>respect the people that are over there </v>

3379
02:21:37.221 --> 02:21:39.320
<v Speaker 3>doing that and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he does just like,</v>

3380
02:21:39.860 --> 02:21:42.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a sacrifice,</v>

3381
02:21:42.540 --> 02:21:43.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's uh,</v>

3382
02:21:44.660 --> 02:21:48.170
<v Speaker 3>I want to never take it for granted that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>

3383
02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:50.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're safe here.</v>

3384
02:21:50.091 --> 02:21:50.924
<v Speaker 3>Things are going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just what's the sacrifices made by </v>

3385
02:21:53.631 --> 02:21:54.710
<v Speaker 3>people in the military?</v>

3386
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:56.240
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never want to forget it.</v>

3387
02:21:56.900 --> 02:21:57.733
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a very controversial subject with </v>

3388
02:22:00.831 --> 02:22:03.620
<v Speaker 3>people because um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're on the left,</v>

3389
02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:06.680
<v Speaker 3>you want less military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want less war,</v>

3390
02:22:06.681 --> 02:22:09.260
<v Speaker 3>you want less violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want less everything and that,</v>

3391
02:22:09.261 --> 02:22:10.094
<v Speaker 3>that's a totally reasonable position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think in a lot of ways it's like </v>

3392
02:22:13.671 --> 02:22:14.504
<v Speaker 3>wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're talking about it as someone </v>

3393
02:22:16.971 --> 02:22:20.180
<v Speaker 3>who's never experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think once you experience it,</v>

3394
02:22:20.210 --> 02:22:22.100
<v Speaker 3>and once you've been to these parts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>

3395
02:22:22.101 --> 02:22:22.934
<v Speaker 3>at least my perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on the descriptions that I've </v>

3396
02:22:25.861 --> 02:22:28.440
<v Speaker 3>gotten from people that have been there </v>
<v Speaker 3>or that it's,</v>

3397
02:22:28.510 --> 02:22:29.343
<v Speaker 3>it's way more complex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are just parts of the world that </v>

3398
02:22:32.221 --> 02:22:33.580
<v Speaker 3>are fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3399
02:22:34.230 --> 02:22:35.063
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3400
02:22:35.150 --> 02:22:36.390
<v Speaker 3>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not black and white,</v>

3401
02:22:36.391 --> 02:22:37.890
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's going to take many,</v>

3402
02:22:37.891 --> 02:22:38.724
<v Speaker 3>many generations for those parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world to become a better place for </v>

3403
02:22:43.411 --> 02:22:48.410
<v Speaker 3>people to live in and then sort of catch</v>
<v Speaker 3>up to what we think of as civilization,</v>

3404
02:22:48.430 --> 02:22:49.260
<v Speaker 3>the Western world.</v>

3405
02:22:49.260 --> 02:22:50.640
<v Speaker 3>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3406
02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:51.713
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at parts of the Middle </v>

3407
02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:53.153
<v Speaker 3>East where the women in Iran are risking</v>
<v Speaker 3>their lives and their safety by not </v>

3408
02:22:57.301 --> 02:22:59.160
<v Speaker 3>wearing a religious outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3409
02:22:59.190 --> 02:23:00.023
<v Speaker 3>There's all these protests where these </v>
<v Speaker 3>women are on the streets were not </v>

3410
02:23:02.461 --> 02:23:03.294
<v Speaker 3>wearing the hijab and they're walking </v>
<v Speaker 3>around and they risk being imprisoned </v>

3411
02:23:06.330 --> 02:23:07.500
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

3412
02:23:07.530 --> 02:23:10.830
<v Speaker 3>Fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these women are brave as hell,</v>

3413
02:23:10.831 --> 02:23:11.664
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're out there just saying fuck </v>

3414
02:23:12.661 --> 02:23:13.494
<v Speaker 3>this enough already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're taking pictures like that </v>

3415
02:23:16.171 --> 02:23:17.004
<v Speaker 3>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're putting it up on social media </v>

3416
02:23:18.421 --> 02:23:19.770
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

3417
02:23:19.771 --> 02:23:24.180
<v Speaker 3>a big revolt there right now where </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are just tired of it.</v>

3418
02:23:24.210 --> 02:23:26.730
<v Speaker 3>They want fucking freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3419
02:23:26.731 --> 02:23:28.740
<v Speaker 3>and they see what's going on in the rest</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the world.</v>

3420
02:23:28.741 --> 02:23:29.574
<v Speaker 3>They have the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't get a chance to see what's </v>

3421
02:23:31.201 --> 02:23:32.034
<v Speaker 3>going on in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the things that we </v>

3422
02:23:33.721 --> 02:23:36.020
<v Speaker 3>always have to remember about America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3423
02:23:36.030 --> 02:23:38.310
<v Speaker 3>America might be fucked in some ways and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

3424
02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:39.583
<v Speaker 3>we definitely have issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is more opportunity and more </v>

3425
02:23:44.281 --> 02:23:45.114
<v Speaker 3>possibility for you to do what you want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do here than almost anywhere on the </v>

3426
02:23:48.511 --> 02:23:50.790
<v Speaker 3>planet earth as a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a fact.</v>

3427
02:23:50.810 --> 02:23:51.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a fact.</v>

3428
02:23:51.901 --> 02:23:52.734
<v Speaker 3>And there's more art that comes out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>here and there's more comedy that comes </v>

3429
02:23:55.381 --> 02:23:56.850
<v Speaker 3>out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's more,</v>

3430
02:23:56.910 --> 02:23:59.790
<v Speaker 3>there's so much shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more movies.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of great shit that comes </v>

3432
02:24:02.371 --> 02:24:03.450
<v Speaker 3>out of this one spot.</v>

3433
02:24:03.700 --> 02:24:04.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

3434
02:24:04.571 --> 02:24:06.250
<v Speaker 4>it's a great place to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're,</v>

3435
02:24:06.251 --> 02:24:09.880
<v Speaker 4>we're blessed to live here and have w </v>
<v Speaker 4>we've only known this,</v>

3436
02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:10.833
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I couldn't imagine living someplace </v>

3437
02:24:12.791 --> 02:24:17.140
<v Speaker 4>where it wouldn't matter how smart or </v>
<v Speaker 4>how hard of a worker you are or how,</v>

3438
02:24:17.950 --> 02:24:20.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever talented you were,</v>

3439
02:24:20.681 --> 02:24:23.590
<v Speaker 4>you weren't getting out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's how it is in some places.</v>

3440
02:24:23.591 --> 02:24:24.600
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3441
02:24:24.601 --> 02:24:28.060
<v Speaker 4>in here it's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Man,</v>

3442
02:24:28.061 --> 02:24:29.860
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just hope we never,</v>

3443
02:24:29.920 --> 02:24:32.980
<v Speaker 4>I never need to forget that and I never </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to forget that.</v>

3444
02:24:32.981 --> 02:24:33.814
<v Speaker 4>And I just hope other people just </v>
<v Speaker 4>realize that because it's not like I've </v>

3445
02:24:36.671 --> 02:24:38.080
<v Speaker 4>been everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I just,</v>

3446
02:24:38.140 --> 02:24:38.973
<v Speaker 4>I know that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the challenge is like the women have </v>

3447
02:24:41.710 --> 02:24:43.600
<v Speaker 4>that you were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3448
02:24:44.500 --> 02:24:46.090
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3449
02:24:46.170 --> 02:24:46.700
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

3450
02:24:46.700 --> 02:24:50.300
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why I'm Pro America </v>
<v Speaker 3>is cause I'm pro human being.</v>

3451
02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:51.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's more,</v>

3452
02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:52.993
<v Speaker 3>there's more chances for people to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>who they really want to be and become </v>

3453
02:24:56.151 --> 02:24:58.100
<v Speaker 3>what they really want to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3454
02:24:58.101 --> 02:25:03.101
<v Speaker 3>And I support a lot of left wing ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>equality and freedom and gay marriage.</v>

3455
02:25:05.740 --> 02:25:08.090
<v Speaker 3>I think he should be able to do whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck you want to do.</v>

3456
02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:09.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go have fun,</v>

3457
02:25:09.351 --> 02:25:12.020
<v Speaker 3>just be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't just do b,</v>

3458
02:25:12.021 --> 02:25:15.320
<v Speaker 3>you just go be you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you know,</v>

3459
02:25:15.321 --> 02:25:16.154
<v Speaker 3>people see me and they like spent like </v>
<v Speaker 3>to see this giant American flag behind </v>

3460
02:25:19.941 --> 02:25:22.250
<v Speaker 3>me and they think immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3461
02:25:22.251 --> 02:25:23.590
<v Speaker 3>right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3464
02:25:25.961 --> 02:25:27.730
<v Speaker 3>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you support?</v>

3465
02:25:27.731 --> 02:25:29.110
<v Speaker 3>Imperialism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you support this?</v>

3466
02:25:29.111 --> 02:25:33.040
<v Speaker 3>Like no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I support the idea of what America is.</v>

3467
02:25:33.070 --> 02:25:34.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I support.</v>

3468
02:25:34.810 --> 02:25:35.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>same spot going to the desert rat.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that locked in?</v>

3473
02:25:48.670 --> 02:25:50.560
<v Speaker 3>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was crazy.</v>

3474
02:25:50.770 --> 02:25:52.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a beautiful place.</v>

3475
02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:53.193
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

3476
02:25:53.230 --> 02:25:54.940
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the most fun times I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever had.</v>

3477
02:25:54.970 --> 02:25:56.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well we're getting it.</v>

3478
02:25:56.200 --> 02:25:57.940
<v Speaker 3>We're going to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm excited.</v>

3479
02:25:58.380 --> 02:26:00.520
<v Speaker 3>Me Too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>470,000 views.</v>

3480
02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:04.060
<v Speaker 3>That video was a lot of fun to make too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3481
02:26:04.090 --> 02:26:05.770
<v Speaker 3>I just wish that they had put in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3482
02:26:05.830 --> 02:26:08.920
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the elk that you shot your elk,</v>

3483
02:26:09.130 --> 02:26:11.350
<v Speaker 3>you did wind up shooting out a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an elk,</v>

3484
02:26:11.351 --> 02:26:12.184
<v Speaker 3>but did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did the,</v>

3485
02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:16.090
<v Speaker 3>the video that did not get the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>Arrow hitting the elk on camera.</v>

3486
02:26:16.091 --> 02:26:17.980
<v Speaker 3>So what the issue was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's tough.</v>

3487
02:26:18.010 --> 02:26:20.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bow hunting is hard,</v>

3488
02:26:20.790 --> 02:26:24.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in film and so it's,</v>

3489
02:26:24.251 --> 02:26:25.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3490
02:26:25.151 --> 02:26:28.120
<v Speaker 3>we do the best we can to tell the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3491
02:26:29.500 --> 02:26:31.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it does tell the story </v>
<v Speaker 3>very well.</v>

3492
02:26:31.540 --> 02:26:32.920
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we do the best we can.</v>

3493
02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:34.020
<v Speaker 3>It is hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3494
02:26:34.050 --> 02:26:36.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean she'd be a lot longer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>

3495
02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:37.480
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3496
02:26:37.540 --> 02:26:40.390
<v Speaker 3>I think that things should have been at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least an hour and I think,</v>

3497
02:26:40.391 --> 02:26:41.224
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even then it wouldn't have told the </v>

3498
02:26:41.921 --> 02:26:44.920
<v Speaker 3>whole story because you look at it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the things that uh,</v>

3499
02:26:44.930 --> 02:26:47.610
<v Speaker 3>I've told a friend when we were watching</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3500
02:26:47.620 --> 02:26:49.030
<v Speaker 3>a hunting show before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

3501
02:26:49.031 --> 02:26:49.870
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks so easy.</v>

3502
02:26:49.871 --> 02:26:51.460
<v Speaker 3>They just go out there and they always </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot something.</v>

3503
02:26:51.461 --> 02:26:52.294
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3504
02:26:52.510 --> 02:26:54.940
<v Speaker 3>to shoot one of these shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we were watching meat eater.</v>

3505
02:26:55.720 --> 02:26:56.620
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meat eaters,</v>

3506
02:26:56.621 --> 02:26:59.260
<v Speaker 3>one of the rare shows that they'll have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of shows where they don't,</v>

3507
02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:00.153
<v Speaker 3>they're not successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I've done two different shows with </v>

3508
02:27:03.011 --> 02:27:04.210
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were weren't successful.</v>

3509
02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:07.390
<v Speaker 3>We just go out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are seven days most hunting,</v>

3510
02:27:07.391 --> 02:27:08.050
<v Speaker 3>most hunting.</v>

3511
02:27:08.050 --> 02:27:08.883
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you boil all that down to 22 </v>

3512
02:27:10.841 --> 02:27:12.320
<v Speaker 3>minutes with commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3513
02:27:12.370 --> 02:27:16.000
<v Speaker 3>It just looks like it inevitably you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get to about 18 minutes in,</v>

3514
02:27:16.001 --> 02:27:18.040
<v Speaker 3>someone's going to shoot something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yay.</v>

3515
02:27:18.041 --> 02:27:18.874
<v Speaker 3>They got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like you're shooting things </v>

3516
02:27:21.071 --> 02:27:23.110
<v Speaker 3>that are definitely going to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not,</v>

3517
02:27:23.380 --> 02:27:24.930
<v Speaker 3>that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

3518
02:27:24.940 --> 02:27:26.830
<v Speaker 3>There's no guarantee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially with the ball,</v>

3519
02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:29.680
<v Speaker 3>especially with the bow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I and I think,</v>

3520
02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:31.690
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we can film on ourselves.</v>

3521
02:27:31.691 --> 02:27:33.970
<v Speaker 3>We can feel ourselves as long as we </v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

3522
02:27:34.030 --> 02:27:34.863
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think we should do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking about that a lot </v>

3523
02:27:36.531 --> 02:27:37.364
<v Speaker 3>because I was frustrated by that whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and this archaic idea that </v>

3524
02:27:40.151 --> 02:27:40.984
<v Speaker 3>everything has to be 10 minutes long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking to a guy that does a </v>

3525
02:27:42.551 --> 02:27:43.384
<v Speaker 3>three hour podcasts that talking for </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite a while today and millions of </v>

3526
02:27:47.141 --> 02:27:48.550
<v Speaker 3>people listen to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I just,</v>

3527
02:27:48.940 --> 02:27:49.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy it.</v>

3528
02:27:49.690 --> 02:27:53.290
<v Speaker 3>I think it's an archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>antiquated way of looking at things.</v>

3529
02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:56.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's right and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea that people have an incredibly</v>

3530
02:27:56.831 --> 02:27:58.750
<v Speaker 3>short attention span.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

3531
02:27:59.170 --> 02:28:04.170
<v Speaker 3>people are consumers of entertainment </v>
<v Speaker 3>and especially people who love hunting.</v>

3532
02:28:04.690 --> 02:28:08.230
<v Speaker 3>I watch a lot of videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watch a lot of hunting videos.</v>

3533
02:28:08.231 --> 02:28:12.040
<v Speaker 3>I'll watch a lot of videos on science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I launch a lot of shit.</v>

3534
02:28:12.041 --> 02:28:15.040
<v Speaker 3>I watch hours and hours of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that I'm interested in.</v>

3535
02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:17.110
<v Speaker 3>The people that are interested in elk </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>

3536
02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:18.273
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to just see a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys laughing and joking around and an </v>

3537
02:28:20.831 --> 02:28:21.980
<v Speaker 3>Arrow hits a big bowl</v>

3538
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:23.300
<v Speaker 5>and everybody's happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3539
02:28:23.301 --> 02:28:24.770
<v Speaker 5>They want to see like what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

3540
02:28:24.860 --> 02:28:26.330
<v Speaker 5>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what was the struggle?</v>

3541
02:28:26.331 --> 02:28:28.570
<v Speaker 5>There was a lot of struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a lot of damage.</v>

3542
02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:31.130
<v Speaker 5>We did have to keep hammering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was fun.</v>

3543
02:28:31.490 --> 02:28:33.470
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was that one clip was hilarious.</v>

3544
02:28:33.950 --> 02:28:34.910
<v Speaker 5>That was told,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

3545
02:28:34.911 --> 02:28:36.920
<v Speaker 5>folks who listen to this or watching </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

3546
02:28:36.921 --> 02:28:39.920
<v Speaker 5>if you watch that clip of Cam and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was not rehearsed now.</v>

3547
02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:41.900
<v Speaker 5>That just came out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were just fucking around.</v>

3548
02:28:42.330 --> 02:28:44.780
<v Speaker 5>We will keep hammering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's been around a little while,</v>

3549
02:28:44.781 --> 02:28:47.320
<v Speaker 5>so he's been around a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They thought that was the origins of it.</v>

3550
02:28:47.470 --> 02:28:50.120
<v Speaker 5>Did that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was because that's how good we sold</v>

3551
02:28:50.121 --> 02:28:51.230
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3552
02:28:52.010 --> 02:28:54.650
<v Speaker 5>That's how good we sold that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3553
02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:58.260
<v Speaker 5>Well that's your sense of humor and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think most people are not aware of that.</v>

3554
02:28:58.270 --> 02:28:59.230
<v Speaker 5>This is what you say.</v>

3555
02:28:59.230 --> 02:29:00.063
<v Speaker 5>That's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have a very funny dry sense of </v>

3556
02:29:01.941 --> 02:29:03.230
<v Speaker 5>humor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

3557
02:29:03.810 --> 02:29:05.000
<v Speaker 5>That was a,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we can,</v>

3575
02:29:37.140 --> 02:29:38.630
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just want to,</v>

3576
02:29:38.780 --> 02:29:39.613
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've always wanted to just share a </v>

3577
02:29:42.561 --> 02:29:46.900
<v Speaker 5>hunting adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just the real hunger adventure.</v>

3578
02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:50.000
<v Speaker 5>Give it to constant content.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3579
02:29:50.390 --> 02:29:52.940
<v Speaker 5>the time to develop the story.</v>

3580
02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:55.460
<v Speaker 5>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just let it evolve.</v>

3581
02:29:55.670 --> 02:29:58.310
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you watch those hush and guys on a,</v>

3582
02:29:58.311 --> 02:30:01.430
<v Speaker 5>on youtube now I have great videos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are they good?</v>

3583
02:30:01.460 --> 02:30:03.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they've got a lot of content in.</v>

3584
02:30:03.711 --> 02:30:07.190
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that you really get </v>
<v Speaker 5>out of their content is you really get a</v>

3585
02:30:07.191 --> 02:30:08.024
<v Speaker 5>sense of how difficult it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And mostly what they're doing is public </v>

3586
02:30:10.791 --> 02:30:11.571
<v Speaker 5>land hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3587
02:30:11.571 --> 02:30:13.300
<v Speaker 5>born and raised.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's that stuff,</v>

3588
02:30:13.301 --> 02:30:14.310
<v Speaker 5>that group of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3589
02:30:14.420 --> 02:30:16.430
<v Speaker 5>I'll watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I watched those guys too.</v>

3590
02:30:16.490 --> 02:30:17.323
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But one of the beautiful things about </v>

3591
02:30:18.561 --> 02:30:21.040
<v Speaker 5>youtube is there's no time parameters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3592
02:30:21.410 --> 02:30:22.820
<v Speaker 5>And people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3593
02:30:22.850 --> 02:30:23.683
<v Speaker 5>I mean we are just kind of locked into </v>
<v Speaker 5>this 22 minutes with the commercials </v>

3594
02:30:26.841 --> 02:30:29.810
<v Speaker 5>type thing from the outdoor channel and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't need to be,</v>

3595
02:30:29.811 --> 02:30:30.644
<v Speaker 5>like I was talking with a brand and </v>
<v Speaker 5>shockey about this back at [inaudible] </v>

3596
02:30:34.940 --> 02:30:38.810
<v Speaker 5>and he's so talented as far as a film </v>
<v Speaker 5>maker goes and,</v>

3597
02:30:39.080 --> 02:30:39.913
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even in womack who put together our </v>

3598
02:30:41.631 --> 02:30:42.464
<v Speaker 5>Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean without the handcuffs of a time </v>

3599
02:30:44.121 --> 02:30:44.960
<v Speaker 5>restraint.</v>

3600
02:30:45.440 --> 02:30:47.690
<v Speaker 5>I just think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the sky's the limit.</v>

3601
02:30:47.930 --> 02:30:48.763
<v Speaker 5>I agree too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the story should be what the </v>

3602
02:30:50.631 --> 02:30:54.230
<v Speaker 5>story is and just say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just make it what it is.</v>

3603
02:30:54.231 --> 02:30:55.064
<v Speaker 5>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck of it's 40 minutes </v>

3604
02:30:56.451 --> 02:30:58.580
<v Speaker 5>or an hour and 40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People will watch it.</v>

3605
02:30:58.640 --> 02:30:59.940
<v Speaker 5>People will watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3606
02:31:00.110 --> 02:31:03.050
<v Speaker 5>And the ones who don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they weren't going to watch it anyway.</v>

3607
02:31:03.440 --> 02:31:04.273
<v Speaker 5>The ones that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea that like you get it in 10 </v>

3608
02:31:05.961 --> 02:31:08.690
<v Speaker 5>minutes and somehow or another it's more</v>
<v Speaker 5>digestible in 10 minutes.</v>

3609
02:31:08.691 --> 02:31:11.690
<v Speaker 5>Like stop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not real.</v>

3610
02:31:11.930 --> 02:31:12.763
<v Speaker 5>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people have these weird ideas in their </v>

3611
02:31:14.601 --> 02:31:16.670
<v Speaker 5>head about things like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3612
02:31:16.671 --> 02:31:19.470
<v Speaker 5>but the statistics show that more people</v>
<v Speaker 5>watch 10 minute videos.</v>

3613
02:31:19.890 --> 02:31:20.723
<v Speaker 5>Well if you want him watch videos about </v>
<v Speaker 5>babies chewing bubblegum or some stupid </v>

3614
02:31:23.731 --> 02:31:24.810
<v Speaker 5>shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3615
02:31:25.140 --> 02:31:26.070
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the 10 minutes.</v>

3616
02:31:26.220 --> 02:31:27.053
<v Speaker 5>But you're supposed to be showing </v>
<v Speaker 5>respect to what is one of the more </v>

3617
02:31:31.621 --> 02:31:36.110
<v Speaker 5>difficult and misunderstood pursuits in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the United States.</v>

3618
02:31:36.110 --> 02:31:37.760
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's bow hunting,</v>

3619
02:31:37.770 --> 02:31:40.410
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's incredibly difficult and incredibly</v>

3620
02:31:40.411 --> 02:31:41.244
<v Speaker 5>misunderstood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think it's a noble pursuit and I </v>

3621
02:31:44.461 --> 02:31:45.294
<v Speaker 5>think it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the more intriguing things </v>

3622
02:31:48.660 --> 02:31:50.850
<v Speaker 5>and more interesting things I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>done in my life.</v>

3623
02:31:51.300 --> 02:31:52.380
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

3624
02:31:52.381 --> 02:31:54.510
<v Speaker 5>and I don't know if you captured all in </v>
<v Speaker 5>one film,</v>

3625
02:31:54.511 --> 02:31:55.660
<v Speaker 5>but I just know that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3626
02:31:55.710 --> 02:31:56.543
<v Speaker 5>if somehow we could capture the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just the more of the journey because </v>

3627
02:32:00.361 --> 02:32:02.280
<v Speaker 5>there's people that don't know anything </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>

3628
02:32:02.340 --> 02:32:06.210
<v Speaker 5>This one or know how to get started.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you'd have one film that</v>

3629
02:32:06.211 --> 02:32:07.044
<v Speaker 5>I'd do all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I just know that there's people </v>

3630
02:32:08.311 --> 02:32:10.440

<v Speaker 5>ever said.</v>

3655
02:33:09.330 --> 02:33:10.850
<v Speaker 5>He was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3656
02:33:10.920 --> 02:33:12.600
<v Speaker 5>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his dog was,</v>

3657
02:33:12.680 --> 02:33:15.270
<v Speaker 5>my dogs killed a few chickens and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3658
02:33:15.271 --> 02:33:16.104
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how'd you get your dog to stop killing </v>

3659
02:33:16.831 --> 02:33:18.030
<v Speaker 5>chickens?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

3660
02:33:18.060 --> 02:33:18.893
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we tied a dead chicken to his neck and </v>

3661
02:33:21.181 --> 02:33:23.460
<v Speaker 5>cam goes and she's tired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dead stripper to your neck.</v>

3662
02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:30.810
<v Speaker 5>And it was just out of the blue and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>was fucking crying,</v>

3663
02:33:30.811 --> 02:33:31.644
<v Speaker 5>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that,</v>

3664
02:33:31.740 --> 02:33:33.150
<v Speaker 5>that was one of the funniest things you </v>
<v Speaker 5>said.</v>

3665
02:33:33.151 --> 02:33:35.130
<v Speaker 5>But there was one other one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was the other one?</v>

3666
02:33:35.131 --> 02:33:37.710
<v Speaker 5>We had a hard time remembering it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember the other one that you had said</v>

3667
02:33:37.711 --> 02:33:38.910
<v Speaker 5>before?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3668
02:33:39.150 --> 02:33:43.470
<v Speaker 5>it was even funnier than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But my point is he's got fucking standup</v>

3669
02:33:43.471 --> 02:33:45.660
<v Speaker 5>comedy timing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That sounds like something that,</v>

3670
02:33:45.661 --> 02:33:47.220
<v Speaker 5>like one of my comic friends would've </v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

3671
02:33:47.250 --> 02:33:48.150
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3672
02:33:48.390 --> 02:33:50.830
<v Speaker 5>I wish I could remember the other one </v>
<v Speaker 5>was another one that was funny.</v>

3673
02:33:50.830 --> 02:33:53.910
<v Speaker 5>Or I now fuck I now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God dammit,</v>

3674
02:33:54.640 --> 02:33:55.473

<v Speaker 5>The dead stripper tied your neck for a </v>

3675
02:33:57.391 --> 02:33:58.500
<v Speaker 5>long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many times.</v>

3676
02:33:58.501 --> 02:34:00.090
<v Speaker 5>Many times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also too,</v>

3677
02:34:00.091 --> 02:34:04.140
<v Speaker 5>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of exhaust higher delirious dinner.</v>

3678
02:34:04.290 --> 02:34:06.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's sort of,</v>

3679
02:34:06.311 --> 02:34:08.430
<v Speaker 5>the timing comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

3680
02:34:08.580 --> 02:34:09.413
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like those hunting camps are so </v>

3681
02:34:10.741 --> 02:34:12.680
<v Speaker 5>much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you at the end of the day,</v>

3682
02:34:12.730 --> 02:34:15.200
<v Speaker 5>you and me and Ben sitting around </v>
<v Speaker 5>laughing,</v>

3683
02:34:15.210 --> 02:34:17.660
<v Speaker 5>cracking jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's half fun of it.</v>

3684
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:18.963
<v Speaker 5>The family up there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the land family love those guys of the </v>

3685
02:34:21.730 --> 02:34:22.110
<v Speaker 5>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3686
02:34:22.110 --> 02:34:24.790
<v Speaker 5>Tom Land and his boys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just,</v>

3687
02:34:25.090 --> 02:34:26.620
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just fun to be,</v>

3688
02:34:26.621 --> 02:34:28.290
<v Speaker 5>they feel like family when you go back </v>
<v Speaker 5>up there.</v>

3689
02:34:28.310 --> 02:34:30.100
<v Speaker 5>He'll feel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>feel that this year,</v>

3690
02:34:30.101 --> 02:34:31.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a great guy.</v>

3691
02:34:31.571 --> 02:34:34.180
<v Speaker 5>The whole staff they had there was </v>
<v Speaker 5>fantastic.</v>

3692
02:34:34.181 --> 02:34:35.014
<v Speaker 5>It says a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an awesome place and it's such a </v>

3693
02:34:37.031 --> 02:34:39.010
<v Speaker 5>beautiful piece of land.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3694
02:34:39.011 --> 02:34:42.910
<v Speaker 5>this is 240,000 acres.</v>

3695
02:34:43.210 --> 02:34:43.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>

3696
02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:44.980
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3697
02:34:45.070 --> 02:34:45.903
<v Speaker 5>I know we're probably wrapping this up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but so when you talk about hunting and </v>

3698
02:34:48.611 --> 02:34:49.750
<v Speaker 5>conservation real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3699
02:34:49.751 --> 02:34:54.190
<v Speaker 5>on that piece of property 240 they could</v>
<v Speaker 5>make more money by running cattle on it,</v>

3700
02:34:54.370 --> 02:34:55.450
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you realize that?</v>

3701
02:34:55.750 --> 02:34:56.583
<v Speaker 5>But if they ran cattle on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the habitat would be thrashed right </v>

3702
02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:01.720
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The water sources,</v>

3703
02:35:01.721 --> 02:35:04.330
<v Speaker 5>it'd be thrashed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All those flowers,</v>

3704
02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:07.540
<v Speaker 5>the grouse that lived there gone because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just cattle.</v>

3705
02:35:07.541 --> 02:35:09.790
<v Speaker 5>But if his goal was making money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they could just do that.</v>

3706
02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:10.833
<v Speaker 5>But the goal is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is to make money but also enhance the </v>

3707
02:35:13.271 --> 02:35:14.950
<v Speaker 5>habitat and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3708
02:35:14.951 --> 02:35:16.900
<v Speaker 5>hunting is the best way to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3709
02:35:16.901 --> 02:35:18.970
<v Speaker 5>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just a magical place.</v>

3710
02:35:18.971 --> 02:35:19.804
<v Speaker 5>Like the mule deer that we saw wandering</v>
<v Speaker 5>around his big mule deer and they have </v>

3711
02:35:23.111 --> 02:35:25.330
<v Speaker 5>everything there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all sorts of different wildlife.</v>

3712
02:35:25.331 --> 02:35:27.190
<v Speaker 5>It's this and it's gorgeous country to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

3713
02:35:27.220 --> 02:35:29.080
<v Speaker 5>It is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3714
02:35:29.250 --> 02:35:31.720
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's wrap this bitch up.</v>
