00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Three to Jamie with the quick count.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Dore.</v>

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.163
<v Speaker 1>We're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're live.</v>

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.011
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic.</v>

4
00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you use headsets or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No?</v>

5
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

6
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.551
<v Speaker 1>Headset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's up to you.</v>

7
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>I just feel lonely if I'm the only guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>with headsets.</v>

8
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.151
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

9
00:00:14.151 --> 00:00:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Is there a better trigger?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

10
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what jobs did it's one,</v>

11
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>one minute after 1159 minutes before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top 12 hours.</v>

12
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.493
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever do like a regular radio </v>

13
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:24.960
<v Speaker 1>show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had in college.</v>

14
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>I had a radio show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't real.</v>

15
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>It was just broadcast to no one actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turned out to the campus.</v>

16
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:32.514
<v Speaker 1>It was it just to the campus we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be going out to the campus </v>

17
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:35.720
<v Speaker 1>and then we found out about three months</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

18
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:36.554
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't going out to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always had dreams of doing a radio </v>

19
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:39.894
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I always knew that I would fuck it </v>

20
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:41.491
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:43.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm like I'd get fired or something.</v>

22
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>I never and I never thought anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>would hire me.</v>

23
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.960
<v Speaker 1>I got in trouble at that station for a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

24
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>for playing the same song three times in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a row.</v>

25
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.231
<v Speaker 1>It was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

26
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a song,</v>

27
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:54.174
<v Speaker 1>I don't even remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like some off brand and I never </v>

28
00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:56.604
<v Speaker 1>heard of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like the Rabbini brothers and I was </v>

29
00:00:57.631 --> 00:00:58.540
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this a fun song.</v>

30
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.690
<v Speaker 1>They fired you from a college station,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire me.</v>

31
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:02.550
<v Speaker 1>They came in and he yelled at me and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

32
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:07.551
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't even go and go to anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it was a nice day and I had to do</v>

33
00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:11.130
<v Speaker 1>my radio shift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just come in and simulcasts with</v>

34
00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:11.964
<v Speaker 1>the FM because that was on am simulcasts</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the FM station because I wanted to </v>

35
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 1>go out in the quad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to sit in the studio.</v>

36
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>It was next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if anybody has done this.</v>

37
00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't think you could do it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>put ads on it,</v>

38
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.250
<v Speaker 1>but you could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just a fun project.</v>

39
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 1>Have your own radio show on a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd just play songs.</v>

40
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Could you do that Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

41
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>I think because you can't give.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you give people a download of a song.</v>

42
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.860
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

43
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.780
<v Speaker 1>So you could stream it though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe like stream it on youtube,</v>

45
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe but not,</v>

46
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>but you'd still have to pay some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>royalties for those songs.</v>

47
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you weren't making any money off</v>

48
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:51.870
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to pay.</v>

49
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.200
<v Speaker 1>I think so if someone is streaming your </v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes,</v>

50
00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>they have to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

51
00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:59.370
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is nobody wants to hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>your jokes more than once.</v>

52
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem with jokes.</v>

53
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.710
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

54
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright for first of all,</v>

55
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.390
<v Speaker 1>let me blow smoke up your ass a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

56
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:07.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just sincere.</v>

57
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>So I've seen you do comedy before I saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

58
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:13.770
<v Speaker 1>We did the 2004,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the aspen festival.</v>

59
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 1>We were on the opening night show at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wheeler Opera House.</v>

60
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:21.060
<v Speaker 1>And then I saw you do sets at the Improv</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I always thought you were funny,</v>

61
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.430
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

62
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.270
<v Speaker 1>but I never remembered any of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes.</v>

63
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.703
<v Speaker 1>And then I saw you at the comedy store a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks ago and I've been doing </v>

64
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>your act ever since.</v>

65
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.353
<v Speaker 1>I've been telling you jokes everywhere I</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to anybody who will listen and </v>

66
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.150
<v Speaker 1>everybody falls down laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those jokes that you have,</v>

67
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.840
<v Speaker 1>first of all of the joke about Weinstein</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just so God damn funny.</v>

68
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.460
<v Speaker 1>And then the joke about the wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn it.</v>

69
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

70
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.443
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for me to not say them right </v>

71
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:50.514
<v Speaker 1>in your face right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how that would be not good if I </v>

72
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>did your jokes right to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't not do.</v>

73
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.960
<v Speaker 1>Those are some of the funniest jokes </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard in a long time.</v>

74
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I know</v>

75
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 2>people are going to be saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

76
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 2>he's such a kiss ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>

77
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:03.484
<v Speaker 2>I love comedy and I love jokes and I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember jokes that I like and a few </v>

78
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:10.444
<v Speaker 2>whites theme that's so rushed to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>that onto a netflix special because I'm </v>

79
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 2>worried it's going to get old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

80
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:17.321
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

81
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

82
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 2>it's like it happened a couple of months</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

83
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 2>It's still okay and I'm recording in </v>
<v Speaker 2>April and one.</v>

84
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:23.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

85
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 2>April is like the wire that's like under</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wire.</v>

86
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.853
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it'll be okay because they're </v>

87
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 2>not going to be a bigger rapper or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

88
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 2>Then Harvey Weinstein could come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>

89
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.340
<v Speaker 2>He's the pinnacle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

90
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.193
<v Speaker 2>Like if you had a cosby joke today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still okay because he's such a </v>

91
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 2>raper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

92
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 2>I forgot cosby your ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You forget.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We're cosby was at a barber shop.</v>

94
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 2>There's videos of him hanging out at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>barber shop talking about jazz,</v>

95
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 2>a trivia barber shop guys and Philly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

96
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he actually performed recently at a jazz</v>

97
00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 2>club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

98
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:58.174
<v Speaker 2>He showed up at this jazz club and </v>
<v Speaker 2>perform and then announced that he was </v>

99
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:03.050
<v Speaker 2>going to perform at another place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

100
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 2>he's back while he's in between trials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

101
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 2>So see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the weird thing.</v>

102
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.730
<v Speaker 2>I always wondered like he was still </v>
<v Speaker 2>selling tickets.</v>

103
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.933
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people will still show up to see </v>

104
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before no one before anyone knew for</v>

105
00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:18.604
<v Speaker 2>sure what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a couple of accusations and </v>

106
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:21.760
<v Speaker 2>everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

107
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this really?</v>

108
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Is this real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this someone doing a shake down?</v>

109
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.733
<v Speaker 2>And then they started the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the fucking tsunami of accusation </v>

110
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:30.904
<v Speaker 2>started piling in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really incredible when you </v>

111
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:34.960
<v Speaker 2>think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many years that guy was doing that.</v>

112
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.410
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievable how he could get away </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that for so long and terrifying and</v>

113
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:42.304
<v Speaker 2>then something and then now it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just go on a bad date and year you </v>

114
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.800
<v Speaker 2>get in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Aziz Ansari.</v>

115
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.810
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

116
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's the pendulum swings,</v>

117
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:52.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

118
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.533
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of open season on men right </v>

119
00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:58.430
<v Speaker 2>now and it'll swing back around and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be normal again and you know,</v>

120
00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.420
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

121
00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.920
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

122
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.110
<v Speaker 2>there's so many of these accusations </v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened.</v>

123
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.303
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after awhile they pile up and then </v>

124
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:05.974
<v Speaker 2>there's this like anti male resentment </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it'll swing back and it'll </v>

125
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 2>normalize and people were sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reacting theses thing and they say,</v>

126
00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:14.194
<v Speaker 2>well that went a little too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the woman who was in charge of </v>

127
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 2>the California woman who was a big me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>support her,</v>

128
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:21.790
<v Speaker 2>she got busted and you see that?</v>

129
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:22.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

130
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:25.380
<v Speaker 2>She was grabbing some dude's Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his ass.</v>

131
00:05:25.381 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 2>And she was drunk and she's just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>congresswoman.</v>

132
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.470
<v Speaker 2>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

133
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.710

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

135
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 2>I've been grabbed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

136
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:38.290
<v Speaker 2>like bill burr said this famously in was</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent correct.</v>

137
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:41.800
<v Speaker 2>It's after shows drunk women in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>forties.</v>

138
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.873
<v Speaker 2>They get a little liquored up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get crazy and they just get a </v>

139
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:47.290
<v Speaker 2>little grabby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They grabbed that ass,</v>

140
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.360
<v Speaker 2>they'll go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

141
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.560
<v Speaker 2>uh.</v>

142
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.980
<v Speaker 2>did you feel violated?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

143
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.380
<v Speaker 2>it's anybody who says it's not different</v>
<v Speaker 2>for men is just a liar.</v>

144
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.273
<v Speaker 2>It's not physically scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if my daughter comes and </v>

145
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:03.740
<v Speaker 2>punches me and kicks me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

146
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 2>like she'll do that for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just as a joke.</v>

147
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 2>It's not threatening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

148
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.800
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's silly.</v>

149
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 2>But if you did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

150
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking hit me.</v>

151
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 2>Like a man hits you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's different.</v>

152
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Like if a man is trying to grab a </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman's ass,</v>

153
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:20.780
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about someone larger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grabbing someone smaller.</v>

154
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:22.760
<v Speaker 2>It's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dangerous.</v>

155
00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:27.350
<v Speaker 2>The real threat of rape is actually know</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 year old lady's gonna rape me.</v>

156
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.053
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to happen unless I want </v>

157
00:06:30.211 --> 00:06:31.400
<v Speaker 2>her to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not.</v>

158
00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:32.234
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to go down that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really sick to be something </v>

159
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:38.810
<v Speaker 2>really wrong with me.</v>

160
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.253
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was this guy and see this how I </v>

161
00:06:41.311 --> 00:06:42.144
<v Speaker 3>like remembering jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen this guy probably tell </v>

162
00:06:43.621 --> 00:06:44.454
<v Speaker 3>jokes for 25 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His name is Paul Kelly and it was right </v>

163
00:06:47.251 --> 00:06:48.084
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the eighties or at the end of the </v>

164
00:06:49.351 --> 00:06:52.680
<v Speaker 3>eighties when when women were in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>workforce and that was like one day at a</v>

165
00:06:52.681 --> 00:06:53.514
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that show was all about women </v>

166
00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.670
<v Speaker 3>and so things were weird in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>workplace.</v>

167
00:06:56.671 --> 00:06:59.430
<v Speaker 3>Men didn't know how to talk to women and</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to act,</v>

168
00:06:59.431 --> 00:07:00.120
<v Speaker 3>and then they would go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

169
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.160
<v Speaker 3>she's just like one of the guys remember</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

170
00:07:02.161 --> 00:07:04.800
<v Speaker 3>They would say that that was the highest</v>
<v Speaker 3>compliment you could give a woman.</v>

171
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.330
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the guys,</v>

172
00:07:06.331 --> 00:07:09.720
<v Speaker 3>we don't have to act weird around her </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this Guy Paul Kelly,</v>

173
00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:12.420
<v Speaker 3>that's when people started talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual harassment and he said,</v>

174
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.550
<v Speaker 3>see men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't understand what that is.</v>

175
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.080
<v Speaker 3>It's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>

180
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:29.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do know who he is.</v>

181
00:07:29.581 --> 00:07:31.260
<v Speaker 3>I've seen his show woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm</v>

182
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.740
<v Speaker 2>to a very funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

183
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.170
<v Speaker 2>He told me and he's kind of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>introvert.</v>

184
00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:36.850
<v Speaker 2>He told me that he was working in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>office,</v>

185
00:07:36.851 --> 00:07:37.684
<v Speaker 2>wants in a woman who was his boss was </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually harassing him and it was </v>

186
00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:41.584
<v Speaker 2>completely unwanted and she would grab </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and he would lock up or freeze and </v>

187
00:07:44.411 --> 00:07:46.900
<v Speaker 2>be uncomfortable and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was gross.</v>

188
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said it was.</v>

189
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.240
<v Speaker 2>He was real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a big guy.</v>

190
00:07:49.241 --> 00:07:51.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't physically in danger.</v>

191
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it felt super uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's always going to be a notch.</v>

192
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.150
<v Speaker 2>Several notches less scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

193
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.220
<v Speaker 2>because she can't take out her dick and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stick it in you.</v>

194
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.970
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big difference.</v>

195
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.093
<v Speaker 2>The thing is the violation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like the fact that someone could </v>

196
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.970
<v Speaker 2>physically hold you against your will </v>
<v Speaker 2>and denigrate menu.</v>

197
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.130
<v Speaker 2>Take.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

199
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Inside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of you,</v>

200
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.600
<v Speaker 2>like a woman literally can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She can engulf you.</v>

201
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.050
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could be scary.</v>

202
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:24.790
<v Speaker 2>So when engulfing you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus just doesn't seem as scary though.</v>

203
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.260
<v Speaker 2>Just the same violation.</v>

204
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.770
<v Speaker 3>What happened officer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

205
00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:29.210

<v Speaker 3>he said he wasn't gulped.</v>

206
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.850

<v Speaker 2>engulfed my dick with his ass.</v>

207
00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:37.180
<v Speaker 2>He just took it over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just tell you Weinstein joke.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Just tell it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

209
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.400
<v Speaker 2>it will be on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

210
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm recording in April.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's close.</v>

211
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.020
<v Speaker 2>We're only two months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what have you done that rustling joke</v>

212
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.390
<v Speaker 2>on a special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now that's all.</v>

213
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.090
<v Speaker 2>All this stuff's new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all this stuff is from my,</v>

214
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.360
<v Speaker 2>from my last special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was last year to now.</v>

215
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.181
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

216
00:08:53.181 --> 00:08:54.940
<v Speaker 3>I have been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it,</v>

217
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.823
<v Speaker 3>what makes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that sets stick in my mind also </v>

218
00:08:57.631 --> 00:08:59.550
<v Speaker 3>is that it made me jealous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

219
00:08:59.551 --> 00:08:59.941
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

220
00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:01.170
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you get Jello,</v>

221
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:03.880
<v Speaker 3>I still get jealous when I see someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing something better than me.</v>

222
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.850
<v Speaker 3>I want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

223
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:07.700
<v Speaker 3>God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

224
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:08.543
<v Speaker 3>it made me want to get out and calm </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I haven't been doing comedy as </v>

225
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:11.731
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

226
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:13.830
<v Speaker 3>it's like a muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Jerry Seinfeld said,</v>

227
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 3>if I don't do comedy for about four </v>
<v Speaker 3>days,</v>

228
00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:18.660
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I notice a difference.</v>

229
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:21.150
<v Speaker 3>And if I don't do comedy for five days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can notice.</v>

230
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.300
<v Speaker 3>So I haven't been since I started my </v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube show,</v>

231
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.900
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been to a standup as much as I</v>

232
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:30.880
<v Speaker 3>should and I stopped touring like I </v>
<v Speaker 3>should and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Was standup comedy and like being a </v>

249
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:08.540
<v Speaker 3>standup comic to me was like being </v>
<v Speaker 3>really Yoda in goodfellows,</v>

250
00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:09.001
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

251
00:10:09.001 --> 00:10:11.520
<v Speaker 3>I didn't wait in line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking wanted something.</v>

252
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.900
<v Speaker 3>I took it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking follow rules or listen to your</v>

253
00:10:15.901 --> 00:10:17.640
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking do what I want.</v>

254
00:10:17.641 --> 00:10:20.520
<v Speaker 3>I say what I want and they pay me for it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

255
00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:23.080
<v Speaker 3>I just fucking love that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

256
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:24.443
<v Speaker 3>in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I started doing the youtube </v>

257
00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:27.234
<v Speaker 3>show and it becomes a job for me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a grind in a sense and doing </v>

258
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.223
<v Speaker 3>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I so miss sleeping till noon and then </v>

259
00:10:36.061 --> 00:10:37.260
<v Speaker 3>getting up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>working out,</v>

260
00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:39.870
<v Speaker 3>having all you had to do is figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>who am I going to have lunch with today.</v>

261
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:42.400
<v Speaker 3>That was my big decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who am I going to have lunch with?</v>

262
00:10:42.401 --> 00:10:44.130
<v Speaker 3>Then I go home after the lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a nap,</v>

263
00:10:44.131 --> 00:10:45.400
<v Speaker 3>then I go out and do a show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fun.</v>

264
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.900
<v Speaker 3>It was the greatest life in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did I fuck it up?</v>

265
00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.140
<v Speaker 3>But you must enjoy doing your youtube </v>
<v Speaker 3>show too.</v>

266
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:57.170
<v Speaker 3>I do because it helps me to discover who</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am more because as a standup,</v>

267
00:10:58.921 --> 00:10:59.660
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

268
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.493
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Hicks was my favorite guy when I </v>

269
00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:02.514
<v Speaker 3>saw bill Hicks in Chicago almost quit </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was in comedy about three or </v>

270
00:11:07.351 --> 00:11:08.340
<v Speaker 3>four years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

271
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.050
<v Speaker 3>I fucking know what I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

272
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.970
<v Speaker 3>before I got on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

273
00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:13.260
<v Speaker 3>wait till they get a load of me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

274
00:11:13.261 --> 00:11:14.100
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy,</v>

275
00:11:14.101 --> 00:11:16.380
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking baddest ass in Chicago.</v>

276
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:18.870
<v Speaker 3>And then everybody's talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>

277
00:11:18.871 --> 00:11:19.710
<v Speaker 3>Bill Hicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

278
00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:20.201
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

279
00:11:20.201 --> 00:11:21.034
<v Speaker 3>I'll have to check this guy out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I sat down and he starts to set and </v>

280
00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:26.124
<v Speaker 3>about two minutes in I started drinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then about five minutes and I </v>

281
00:11:30.361 --> 00:11:32.940
<v Speaker 3>started drinking more and about 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

282
00:11:32.941 --> 00:11:37.200
<v Speaker 3>And I was convinced I was going to quit </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy because my whole life,</v>

283
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:38.543
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always thought like George Carlin was </v>

284
00:11:40.201 --> 00:11:41.370
<v Speaker 3>my hero and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

285
00:11:41.371 --> 00:11:43.500
<v Speaker 3>if I do everything right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

286
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.800
<v Speaker 3>I could maybe be like George Carlin for </v>
<v Speaker 3>one special.</v>

287
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.200
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe if I get everything right and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really work at.</v>

288
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.350
<v Speaker 3>And I saw Bill Hicks and I knew that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't,</v>

289
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:56.450
<v Speaker 3>I was always going to be competing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>second place and so when he died it made</v>

290
00:11:56.471 --> 00:11:57.400
<v Speaker 3>me feel a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

291
00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:02.401
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm with the saddest thing.</v>

292
00:12:03.041 --> 00:12:04.630
<v Speaker 3>When he died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course he was my hero.</v>

293
00:12:04.631 --> 00:12:06.220
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

294
00:12:06.221 --> 00:12:09.100
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really know him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew him tangentially and it was weird</v>

295
00:12:09.101 --> 00:12:12.010
<v Speaker 3>to feel that kind of sadness for someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>who you don't know personally.</v>

296
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.280
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that was a big deal to me.</v>

297
00:12:15.281 --> 00:12:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Watching Bill Hicks had totally changed </v>
<v Speaker 3>my life and I tried to be like him,</v>

298
00:12:18.251 --> 00:12:20.140
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an idiot.</v>

299
00:12:20.141 --> 00:12:22.870
<v Speaker 3>I tried to be like him in you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>write.</v>

300
00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:26.050
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then one time I was dating this girl</v>

301
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.540
<v Speaker 3>and might be my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who told me this,</v>

302
00:12:28.541 --> 00:12:29.374
<v Speaker 3>but she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't look like you where you come </v>

303
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:34.680
<v Speaker 3>from because I come from the south side </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Chicago,</v>

304
00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:38.170
<v Speaker 3>grew up poor 12 kids drinking powdered </v>
<v Speaker 3>milk,</v>

305
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.033
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and having the Shit beat out of me from </v>

306
00:12:40.681 --> 00:12:41.980
<v Speaker 3>the fucking morning till night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

307
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.110
<v Speaker 3>Because I went to Catholic school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tough neighborhood and my,</v>

308
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:45.590
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

309
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:46.573
<v Speaker 3>and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't be angry like bill Hicks </v>

310
00:12:48.161 --> 00:12:51.400
<v Speaker 3>because you look like you come from </v>
<v Speaker 3>privilege money and you're dressed well.</v>

311
00:12:51.401 --> 00:12:53.260
<v Speaker 3>I always like to dress nice because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>grew up poor.</v>

312
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:55.470
<v Speaker 3>I was wanting to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

313
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.720
<v Speaker 3>so that's when I had to like pull back </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the anger on stage.</v>

314
00:12:58.721 --> 00:12:59.554
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you watch my specials on comedy </v>

315
00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:02.620
<v Speaker 3>central,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very nice.</v>

316
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.950
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the youtube show is what,</v>

317
00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:10.030
<v Speaker 3>let me connect with my anger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is always what drives me.</v>

318
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:14.020
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is what has connected with people.</v>

319
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.970
<v Speaker 3>And that's when I really started selling</v>
<v Speaker 3>tickets and my everything,</v>

320
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.833
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

321
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:26.230
<v Speaker 3>in a sense I got from this youtube show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now I can go wherever I want and do a</v>

322
00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:28.090
<v Speaker 3>show and my fans will show up.</v>

323
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.190
<v Speaker 3>It's the greatest thing that ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened in my life.</v>

324
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:33.490
<v Speaker 3>You're very good on your youtube show </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're also very fair.</v>

325
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:34.383
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I really like </v>

<v Speaker 3>but you very balanced in your criticism </v>

328
00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:44.730
<v Speaker 3>of the left and you criticism of </v>
<v Speaker 3>criticism of the left and well,</v>

329
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.290
<v Speaker 3>if you have to lie to make your point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a good point.</v>

330
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.153
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you a thousand percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such an important thing that's </v>

331
00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:52.090
<v Speaker 3>being missed today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>heart I get,</v>

342
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:14.950
<v Speaker 3>I get more of a hard time from people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who consider themselves on the left than</v>

343
00:14:14.951 --> 00:14:17.170
<v Speaker 3>people who consider themselves on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right today.</v>

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

346
00:14:21.071 --> 00:14:23.040

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.190
<v Speaker 3>it really started with Bill Clinton in </v>
<v Speaker 3>92,</v>

349
00:14:27.191 --> 00:14:28.024
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't get really ramped up until</v>
<v Speaker 3>Barack Obama in 2010 when it was clear </v>

350
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.113
<v Speaker 3>that Barack Obama was a neo liberal </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporatist who was going to do the </v>

351
00:14:37.931 --> 00:14:40.810
<v Speaker 3>bidding of the war machine and Wall </v>
<v Speaker 3>Street and big Pharma,</v>

352
00:14:40.811 --> 00:14:44.440
<v Speaker 3>which is why when the Democrats got </v>
<v Speaker 3>control of government,</v>

353
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:49.450
<v Speaker 3>they had the presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Senate filibuster proof Senate for a</v>

354
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 3>few months and they had the congress and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the house and</v>

355
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.320
<v Speaker 1>they didn't pass single payer or even a </v>
<v Speaker 1>public option.</v>

356
00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:55.154
<v Speaker 1>What did we get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got a right wing healthcare plan </v>

357
00:14:56.631 --> 00:14:57.464
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a giveaway to the Pharma and </v>

358
00:14:58.971 --> 00:15:01.600
<v Speaker 1>health insurance companies that left out</v>
<v Speaker 1>$28,</v>

359
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:04.940
<v Speaker 1>million fucking paper and infuriated </v>
<v Speaker 1>small business owners,</v>

360
00:15:04.941 --> 00:15:08.270
<v Speaker 1>infuriated people that were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had a small practice.</v>

361
00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.393
<v Speaker 1>There were doctors and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all sorts sorts of people that are </v>

362
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.620
<v Speaker 1>better than what we had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a bad solution.</v>

363
00:15:15.621 --> 00:15:16.454
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it was was a solution for the </v>

364
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.320
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies and the health </v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance company.</v>

365
00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:23.160
<v Speaker 1>That was it better than what we had way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

366
00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.330
<v Speaker 1>because you before there was preexisting</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions and you couldn't get covered,</v>

367
00:15:26.331 --> 00:15:27.164
<v Speaker 1>so then it was supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you can always get coverage and </v>

368
00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:29.883
<v Speaker 1>that part was better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get covered even if you had an </v>

369
00:15:32.751 --> 00:15:33.590
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

370
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.180
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you could go and you could go on</v>

371
00:15:35.181 --> 00:15:36.500
<v Speaker 1>an exchange and stuff like that.</v>

372
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.950
<v Speaker 1>I didn't ever had to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always got through my wife's employer.</v>

373
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.050
<v Speaker 1>I'd always had my health insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

374
00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:42.884
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having health insurance is doesn't </v>

375
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.410
<v Speaker 1>really mean that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got really sick until you were talking</v>

376
00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:50.390
<v Speaker 1>about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a different thing,</v>

377
00:15:50.391 --> 00:15:51.640
<v Speaker 1>but I got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a,</v>

378
00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:52.683
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an illness that they couldn't diagnose </v>

379
00:15:53.541 --> 00:15:56.630
<v Speaker 1>for a few years and it almost killed me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

380
00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:57.523
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was called hypophosphatemic </v>

381
00:15:59.031 --> 00:16:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Osteomalacia and it'll be on late night </v>
<v Speaker 1>TV.</v>

382
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.720
<v Speaker 1>One of those commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have Osceola?</v>

383
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Trisha was side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Side effects include death.</v>

384
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:10.833
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

385
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.500
<v Speaker 1>what is it a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

386
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:17.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a bone disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my bones were admitting to the bottom</v>

387
00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:22.670
<v Speaker 1>line is my bones were having a bone </v>
<v Speaker 1>disintegration woe.</v>

388
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.470
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to be much taller.</v>

389
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.361
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds funny,</v>

390
00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:27.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has actually true.</v>

391
00:16:27.231 --> 00:16:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we met I was taller than you.</v>

392
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

393
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.790
<v Speaker 1>How tall were you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was around five.</v>

394
00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:33.560
<v Speaker 1>10 and you'd shrank to five?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight.</v>

395
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:34.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little,</v>

396
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.140
<v Speaker 1>little under five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight.</v>

397
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

398
00:16:38.151 --> 00:16:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

399
00:16:39.681 --> 00:16:40.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

400
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.713
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when that happened I was going to </v>

401
00:16:42.651 --> 00:16:46.230
<v Speaker 1>kill myself trying to stretch yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

402
00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.620
<v Speaker 1>One of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use the medieval torture devices.</v>

403
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:56.270
<v Speaker 1>So I'm one of those guys who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I want something,</v>

404
00:16:56.271 --> 00:16:59.090
<v Speaker 1>no matter what price I have to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical,</v>

405
00:16:59.091 --> 00:16:59.924
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll pay it and I'll do and I'll get </v>

406
00:17:01.101 --> 00:17:02.330
<v Speaker 1>that thing I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

407
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get it.</v>

408
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.750
<v Speaker 1>But this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you mind elaborating on this thing?</v>

409
00:17:05.751 --> 00:17:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

410
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.360
<v Speaker 1>so I couldn't fix it by stretching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't.</v>

411
00:17:09.361 --> 00:17:10.760
<v Speaker 1>It makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just joking about that.</v>

412
00:17:10.761 --> 00:17:11.594
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

413
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:12.463
<v Speaker 1>so what does it do to your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's making your bones shrink so it </v>

414
00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:18.230
<v Speaker 1>gives you osteoporosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then my bones got hollow,</v>

415
00:17:18.231 --> 00:17:20.570
<v Speaker 1>like a Old Lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

416
00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:22.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my spine collapsed when I stepped off.</v>

417
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.460
<v Speaker 1>I stepped off a curb and too hard and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

418
00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:26.810
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know what it was.</v>

419
00:17:26.811 --> 00:17:28.940
<v Speaker 1>I like talking about too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

420
00:17:28.941 --> 00:17:30.590
<v Speaker 1>they told me all different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

421
00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your muscles?</v>

422
00:17:31.581 --> 00:17:33.440
<v Speaker 1>It's their nerves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit in your head.</v>

423
00:17:33.441 --> 00:17:34.350
<v Speaker 1>It's in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

424
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.713
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was limping for a few years when </v>

425
00:17:37.131 --> 00:17:38.360
<v Speaker 1>people were always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you doing?</v>

426
00:17:38.361 --> 00:17:38.811
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

427
00:17:38.811 --> 00:17:40.490
<v Speaker 1>I'll be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

428
00:17:40.491 --> 00:17:41.324
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because no one likes to hear about </v>

429
00:17:41.691 --> 00:17:43.460
<v Speaker 1>anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

430
00:17:43.461 --> 00:17:44.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then now when that happened,</v>

431
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.661
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

432
00:17:45.661 --> 00:17:46.790
<v Speaker 1>what's your bones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

433
00:17:46.791 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 1>you motherfuckers so everybody me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should go.</v>

434
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:50.843
<v Speaker 3>So I started going to bone doctors and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody told me I should go see this </v>

435
00:17:52.981 --> 00:17:54.270
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr Charles Sharpe.</v>

436
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:57.840
<v Speaker 3>And I called him and he was expensive </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he didn't take insurance.</v>

437
00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:59.220
<v Speaker 3>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

438
00:17:59.221 --> 00:18:01.800
<v Speaker 3>I'll go to someone he trained so I will </v>
<v Speaker 3>go to someone who trained.</v>

439
00:18:01.801 --> 00:18:04.560
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't get any better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After six months I go to someone else,</v>

440
00:18:04.561 --> 00:18:05.730
<v Speaker 3>he trained,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't get any better.</v>

441
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:10.680
<v Speaker 3>So if I was just about to die and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to him to see him.</v>

442
00:18:10.681 --> 00:18:11.514
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to pay the money and go see </v>

443
00:18:12.481 --> 00:18:14.070
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

444
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.890
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he figured out what it was like that.</v>

445
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.390
<v Speaker 3>And he says to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

446
00:18:18.391 --> 00:18:21.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one in the nowhere you go,</v>

447
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.590
<v Speaker 3>no one's going to know where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what this is.</v>

448
00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:23.011
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

449
00:18:23.011 --> 00:18:25.170
<v Speaker 3>I know I've already been everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

450
00:18:25.171 --> 00:18:27.300
<v Speaker 3>I only saw this once before in 1968.</v>

451
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.360
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you haven't.</v>

452
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.011
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

453
00:18:32.011 --> 00:18:33.720
<v Speaker 3>So then any causes it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

454
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.830
<v Speaker 3>it was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

455
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.420
<v Speaker 3>my own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't know at the time,</v>

456
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:37.913
<v Speaker 3>he thought I was a tumor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they fit since figured out it was </v>

457
00:18:39.631 --> 00:18:44.150
<v Speaker 3>just my own bones leaching of hormone </v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes your body a leach,</v>

458
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.160
<v Speaker 3>the chemicals that I need to make bone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

459
00:18:47.161 --> 00:18:48.450
<v Speaker 3>this is boring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

460
00:18:48.451 --> 00:18:50.040
<v Speaker 3>it's not boring at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

461
00:18:50.041 --> 00:18:52.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he fixed me and I started to fix you.</v>

462
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.350
<v Speaker 3>He just diagnosed me what was wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I needed.</v>

463
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.480
<v Speaker 3>And so I need to take supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

464
00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.790
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for my bones to make bone,</v>

465
00:18:59.791 --> 00:19:00.624
<v Speaker 3>like some people take calcium.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I take this thing called phosphorous </v>

466
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.430
<v Speaker 3>because phosphorous and calcium and </v>
<v Speaker 3>vitamin D to make bone,</v>

467
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.750
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

468
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:10.110
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we did that and it was amazingly,</v>

469
00:19:10.111 --> 00:19:10.944
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just an amazing doctor and he's </v>

470
00:19:13.201 --> 00:19:14.260
<v Speaker 3>very right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

471
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:15.660
<v Speaker 3>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

472
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.070
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

473
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.880
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't like to talk politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

474
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.793
<v Speaker 3>it comes up and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was in the military and all this </v>

475
00:19:22.711 --> 00:19:25.500
<v Speaker 3>stuff and he's just a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just love him.</v>

476
00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:29.490
<v Speaker 3>He's so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so smart and he fixed me,</v>

477
00:19:29.491 --> 00:19:31.590
<v Speaker 3>so getting back to what I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill myself.</v>

478
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:37.280
<v Speaker 3>So when I stepped off the curb and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>shrunk and shrunk even more,</v>

479
00:19:37.831 --> 00:19:39.750
<v Speaker 3>they did an operation that gave me about</v>
<v Speaker 3>an inch back.</v>

480
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.250
<v Speaker 3>I was even shorter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

481
00:19:41.251 --> 00:19:42.390
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy fuck.</v>

482
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

483
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.710
<v Speaker 3>this is like I wanted to kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was literally going to kill myself.</v>

484
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.573
<v Speaker 3>What was the operation they did?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had to put some high four slash </v>

485
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.220
<v Speaker 3>steam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so bar or something like that.</v>

486
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.690
<v Speaker 3>They collapse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they puff it up and then they stick some</v>

487
00:19:54.691 --> 00:19:55.990
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>

488
00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.250
<v Speaker 3>But I saw I was serious.</v>

489
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:01.080
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cried one day.</v>

490
00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:02.250
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

491
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:07.270
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know how to stop and my eyes </v>
<v Speaker 3>puffed up like I couldn't see almost and</v>

492
00:20:07.501 --> 00:20:08.334
<v Speaker 3>I was going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

493
00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.990
<v Speaker 3>I'll just kill myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

494
00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.093
<v Speaker 3>and the only thing that kept me from not</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing myself was my manager called me </v>

495
00:20:16.021 --> 00:20:16.681
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You've got no right to wheat pasta.</v>

581
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not any better.</v>

582
00:23:36.131 --> 00:23:37.150
<v Speaker 1>It's not better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

583
00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.590
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible for you.</v>

584
00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Whole Wheat Pasta is the same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>gluten in it.</v>

585
00:23:40.691 --> 00:23:42.760
<v Speaker 1>It's the same amount of sugars in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

586
00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 1>it's maybe slightly better than refined </v>
<v Speaker 1>pasta.</v>

587
00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.830
<v Speaker 2>Like wheat bread is slightly better than</v>
<v Speaker 2>white bread,</v>

588
00:23:48.831 --> 00:23:53.450
<v Speaker 2>but it's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all just filler like nutrients,</v>

589
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:55.880
<v Speaker 2>but seven grain bread is better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>horse shit.</v>

590
00:23:55.881 --> 00:23:57.290
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bread is horseshit.</v>

591
00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.260
<v Speaker 2>It's not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do this to me it just is.</v>

592
00:24:00.261 --> 00:24:03.380
<v Speaker 2>Wheat is just not a good food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good filler.</v>

593
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're starving,</v>

594
00:24:04.551 --> 00:24:05.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep you alive.</v>

595
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's literally what are.</v>

596
00:24:07.041 --> 00:24:12.041
<v Speaker 2>They invented it for the ground up wheat</v>
<v Speaker 2>and figured out a way to cook it and the</v>

597
00:24:12.051 --> 00:24:14.420
<v Speaker 2>wheat that we're eating today is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>heirloom wheat.</v>

598
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:15.283
<v Speaker 2>It's all wheat that's been adjusted and </v>
<v Speaker 2>genetically modified so that it has </v>

599
00:24:18.141 --> 00:24:21.290
<v Speaker 2>higher yield and smaller areas like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

600
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.390
<v Speaker 2>there's a documentary called what's with</v>
<v Speaker 2>wheat.</v>

601
00:24:23.391 --> 00:24:24.720
<v Speaker 2>It's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

602
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they go over the details of what </v>

603
00:24:26.511 --> 00:24:27.344
<v Speaker 2>happened with wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at somewhere around the early 19th </v>

604
00:24:29.241 --> 00:24:32.990
<v Speaker 2>century or 20th century rather than </v>
<v Speaker 2>early 19 hundreds,</v>

605
00:24:32.991 --> 00:24:33.824
<v Speaker 2>they started altering wheat and they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>it so that they can get higher yield in </v>

606
00:24:37.071 --> 00:24:37.904
<v Speaker 2>a smaller area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by doing that you increase the </v>

607
00:24:41.001 --> 00:24:42.710
<v Speaker 2>amount of complex glutens and the weed.</v>

608
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:43.543
<v Speaker 2>It makes it much more difficult for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to digest and then that's where </v>

609
00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.400
<v Speaker 2>you see like the elevation of all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>gluten sensitivity issues and people are</v>

610
00:24:49.401 --> 00:24:49.671
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

611
00:24:49.671 --> 00:24:51.230
<v Speaker 2>I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no gluten sensitivity.</v>

612
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.060
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody knew what the fuck happened.</v>

613
00:24:53.061 --> 00:24:54.830
<v Speaker 2>He got fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a heart attack and die.</v>

614
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:56.750
<v Speaker 2>They really didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't.</v>

615
00:24:56.751 --> 00:24:59.780
<v Speaker 2>They were much less aware of why people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are fat,</v>

616
00:24:59.781 --> 00:25:00.614
<v Speaker 2>but sugar's wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are two of the biggest problems </v>

617
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.210
<v Speaker 2>hitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

618
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:06.043
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I went to this Chinese medicine </v>

619
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.690
<v Speaker 2>doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

620
00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:10.773
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was back when I was feeling sick and </v>

621
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:13.573
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I went to somebody recommended you </v>

622
00:25:15.741 --> 00:25:16.820
<v Speaker 2>should go to this Chinese man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

623
00:25:16.821 --> 00:25:20.180
<v Speaker 2>I'll try whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what he did was he changed my diet,</v>

624
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:22.730
<v Speaker 2>so he got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got me off of white sugar,</v>

625
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.610
<v Speaker 2>dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even brown sugar is terrible for you and</v>

626
00:25:25.611 --> 00:25:26.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

627
00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

628
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.480
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and carbs basically.</v>

629
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:32.780
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he told me not to drink soda and I said,</v>

630
00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:33.381
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drink diet.</v>

631
00:25:33.381 --> 00:25:35.930
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's worse because of the chemicals in</v>

632
00:25:35.931 --> 00:25:37.400
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

633
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:38.960
<v Speaker 2>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

634
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.280
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

635
00:25:40.281 --> 00:25:41.114
<v Speaker 2>So then he sells he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these herbs for 800 bucks a month </v>

636
00:25:43.581 --> 00:25:44.414
<v Speaker 2>supply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I realized that's all I ate when I </v>

637
00:25:46.731 --> 00:25:47.810
<v Speaker 2>got out of his office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

638
00:25:47.811 --> 00:25:51.890
<v Speaker 2>every time I eat I'm eating white flour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting bread or a pizza or a pasta or a</v>

639
00:25:51.891 --> 00:25:54.230
<v Speaker 2>cheese or everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything he told me not to eat,</v>

640
00:25:54.231 --> 00:25:55.820
<v Speaker 2>that's all I ate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

641
00:25:55.821 --> 00:25:57.260
<v Speaker 2>they go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember my girlfriend said,</v>

642
00:25:57.261 --> 00:26:00.980
<v Speaker 2>how long are you going to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go at least for a month because that's</v>

643
00:26:00.981 --> 00:26:03.050
<v Speaker 2>how much these herbs are and the $800 </v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks I don't want.</v>

644
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:07.700
<v Speaker 2>So by the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By Day three I was leaping out of bed.</v>

645
00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.770
<v Speaker 2>I could not get over how much energy I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>

646
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's because you don't have that big </v>

647
00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:14.330
<v Speaker 2>insulin crash when you're eating all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sugar and all that bread.</v>

648
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.193
<v Speaker 2>Your body's just fighting that shit off </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time trying to process it and </v>

649
00:26:18.621 --> 00:26:22.580
<v Speaker 2>then there's this big crash boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to take a nap.</v>

650
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:23.443
<v Speaker 2>What do you eat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat mostly meat and Aviva cahtos and </v>

651
00:26:27.231 --> 00:26:29.920
<v Speaker 2>healthy fats and vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I.</v>

652
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.180
<v Speaker 2>I hunt so I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything I eat is wild,</v>

653
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.433
<v Speaker 2>so when I'm eating meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm eating elk or deer or something </v>

654
00:26:35.811 --> 00:26:36.644
<v Speaker 2>along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't feel bad when you see the </v>

655
00:26:38.661 --> 00:26:39.251
<v Speaker 2>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just.</v>

656
00:26:39.251 --> 00:26:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do feel a sense of loss,</v>

657
00:26:41.871 --> 00:26:44.190
<v Speaker 2>but I do also know that there's a wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal</v>

658
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 4>that had no idea what was going on until</v>
<v Speaker 4>an arrow hit it.</v>

659
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:47.543
<v Speaker 4>It's not like something that's living in</v>
<v Speaker 4>some pen and being tortured and </v>

660
00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:54.000
<v Speaker 4>genetically modified and filled with </v>
<v Speaker 4>antibiotics and hormones.</v>

661
00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:57.660
<v Speaker 4>It's a wild animal and their life </v>
<v Speaker 4>expectancy is very short.</v>

662
00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:02.250
<v Speaker 4>They get taken out by bears and wolves </v>
<v Speaker 4>and coyotes and Pumas.</v>

663
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.080
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not making it.</v>

664
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:06.660
<v Speaker 4>None of them are making zero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>zero percent.</v>

665
00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.300
<v Speaker 4>They're starving to death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're freezing to death.</v>

666
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:13.950
<v Speaker 4>What you're doing is just dipping your </v>
<v Speaker 4>foot in the wild world.</v>

667
00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.650
<v Speaker 4>You are taking part in the cycle of </v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

668
00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.440
<v Speaker 4>so your against factory farming and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred percent.</v>

669
00:27:19.441 --> 00:27:20.274
<v Speaker 4>That's why I became a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was going either going to become a </v>

670
00:27:21.751 --> 00:27:24.870
<v Speaker 4>vegetarian or I was going to hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are my two options.</v>

671
00:27:24.871 --> 00:27:25.704
<v Speaker 4>I had to figure out what I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do and I experimented with vegetarian </v>

672
00:27:27.871 --> 00:27:32.310
<v Speaker 4>back when I was fighting to try to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>a weight class and I didn't like it.</v>

673
00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.710
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when I started eating meat,</v>

674
00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.553
<v Speaker 4>I did it for like six months and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I started eating meat I got way </v>

675
00:27:38.611 --> 00:27:39.990
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like instantly,</v>

676
00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:43.800
<v Speaker 4>like instantly started gaining muscle </v>
<v Speaker 4>instantly was fighting better,</v>

677
00:27:43.801 --> 00:27:46.950
<v Speaker 4>instantly competed better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I moved up a weight class and that's</v>

678
00:27:46.951 --> 00:27:50.430
<v Speaker 4>when I became my very best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you re class?</v>

679
00:27:50.431 --> 00:27:53.220
<v Speaker 4>What did you fight at?</v>
<v Speaker 4>One 54 is when I moved up to.</v>

680
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.350
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to stay at 1:40 and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>

681
00:27:55.351 --> 00:27:58.290
<v Speaker 4>I fought at 1:40 only for a year when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was 18.</v>

682
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:59.303
<v Speaker 4>I just couldn't do it</v>

683
00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:00.183
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you bring your power with Easyjet </v>

684
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Joe when you went up to 1:54 yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whilst I was 18 I was still growing.</v>

685
00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Still Thick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's young.</v>

686
00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:08.343
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

687
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.610
<v Speaker 4>So it was artificially keeping my body </v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

688
00:28:10.611 --> 00:28:12.050
<v Speaker 4>very thin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a very lean.</v>

689
00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:17.320
<v Speaker 4>But my point is that I knew that when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>watched too many of those videos,</v>

690
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:18.523
<v Speaker 4>factory farming videos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>factory farming should be mean fuck </v>

691
00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.280
<v Speaker 4>insider trading and all the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems that we have in the world.</v>

692
00:28:25.281 --> 00:28:26.520
<v Speaker 4>That's all terrible stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

693
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:30.380
<v Speaker 4>Terrible stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Factory farming is a goddamn crime.</v>

694
00:28:30.381 --> 00:28:34.970
<v Speaker 4>It's a horrible crime against life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that we just do it and then</v>

695
00:28:34.971 --> 00:28:36.950
<v Speaker 4>we have ag gag laws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

696
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.280
<v Speaker 4>That's what's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they're insane.</v>

697
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Laws are fucking criminal.</v>

698
00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:43.180
<v Speaker 4>They're insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

699
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.320
<v Speaker 1>not America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the America I thought about.</v>

700
00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.160
<v Speaker 1>I thought you always supposed to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>free press.</v>

701
00:28:47.161 --> 00:28:49.470
<v Speaker 1>That's the equalizer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's different about us.</v>

702
00:28:49.471 --> 00:28:51.850
<v Speaker 1>And now they gag the press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't talk about craft.</v>

703
00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could.</v>

704
00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.510
<v Speaker 1>They could sue you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could put you in jail if you feel.</v>

705
00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:58.590
<v Speaker 1>If you have tortured animal criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you film a crime.</v>

706
00:28:58.620 --> 00:28:59.453
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

707
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.680
<v Speaker 1>So they've made a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's,</v>

708
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.250
<v Speaker 1>there's some famous saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>

709
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:06.270
<v Speaker 1>what is exposing a crime is a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're ruled by criminals.</v>

710
00:29:06.271 --> 00:29:08.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's the quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something like that.</v>

711
00:29:08.911 --> 00:29:09.410
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

712
00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:10.990
<v Speaker 1>by the way we are being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

713
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.370
<v Speaker 1>we're living in a this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lawless time,</v>

714
00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:17.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the old law only applies to the poor.</v>

715
00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.130
<v Speaker 1>It does not apply to a war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Criminals.</v>

716
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:23.400
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't apply to Wall Street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't apply to anybody.</v>

717
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Giant corporations have figured out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to skirt the law is money.</v>

718
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:29.430
<v Speaker 1>If you steal from rich people that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>will get upset.</v>

719
00:29:29.431 --> 00:29:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Like Bernie madoff stole from rich </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

720
00:29:32.071 --> 00:29:33.390
<v Speaker 1>That was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fucked up.</v>

721
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.313
<v Speaker 1>But if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're jamie diamond or a fear of </v>

722
00:29:36.381 --> 00:29:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Goldman Sachs and you steal from poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are veterans or a lady,</v>

723
00:29:40.141 --> 00:29:41.010
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

724
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 1>That done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You become secretary</v>

725
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.430
<v Speaker 3>of the treasury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve Mnuchin with Mnuchin is</v>

726
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:47.680
<v Speaker 4>one of my favorite evil characters of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the 21st century.</v>

727
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:48.633
<v Speaker 4>When you see him with his wife and his </v>
<v Speaker 4>wife has gloves on and they're holding </v>

728
00:29:52.511 --> 00:29:53.344
<v Speaker 4>the money and he's smiling and when she </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking tags like Gucci and cardiac and </v>

729
00:29:58.241 --> 00:30:01.660
<v Speaker 4>all these different like big time </v>
<v Speaker 4>companies and our instagram posts,</v>

730
00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:03.880
<v Speaker 4>when she stepping off of a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>private jet,</v>

731
00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:05.680
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>

732
00:30:05.681 --> 00:30:06.820
<v Speaker 4>look at that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love,</v>

733
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:09.790
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that she would fuck him.</v>

734
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.100
<v Speaker 4>That's a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That woman is a thief.</v>

735
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:13.960
<v Speaker 4>That's the power of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

736
00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also prostitution.</v>

737
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.560
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a crime.</v>

738
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.810
<v Speaker 4>You don't think she's hot?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

739
00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:21.610
<v Speaker 4>I do not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing.</v>

740
00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:24.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if you were there,</v>

741
00:30:24.851 --> 00:30:27.610
<v Speaker 4>I'd say okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got a funny personalities.</v>

742
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.080
<v Speaker 4>Good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She probably enjoys it.</v>

743
00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:32.290
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

744
00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me see.</v>

745
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.033
<v Speaker 3>Let me just say this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's now Steven Mnuchin is horrible </v>

746
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.450
<v Speaker 3>and he should probably be in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but guess what?</v>

747
00:30:38.451 --> 00:30:39.710
<v Speaker 3>He's not in jail because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

748
00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:40.573
<v Speaker 3>Because a Democrat didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't prosecute him when she was </v>

749
00:30:42.171 --> 00:30:43.670
<v Speaker 3>supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's Kamala Harris.</v>

750
00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:47.150
<v Speaker 3>So she's corrupted by Wall Street too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can point your finger at him.</v>

751
00:30:47.151 --> 00:30:47.481
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

752
00:30:47.481 --> 00:30:50.360
<v Speaker 3>the reason why he's there is because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Democratic party is corrupted.</v>

753
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:51.463
<v Speaker 3>That's why he's there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what did he do that he should have </v>

754
00:30:52.751 --> 00:30:55.790
<v Speaker 3>gone so well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kamala Harris is um,</v>

755
00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:59.030
<v Speaker 3>so he ran one West Bank and they enter </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

756
00:30:59.120 --> 00:30:59.953
<v Speaker 3>investigated his bank and they found a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand instances of criminality and </v>

757
00:31:03.471 --> 00:31:04.304
<v Speaker 3>they said if we had thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands and anything less than a </v>

758
00:31:09.921 --> 00:31:11.930
<v Speaker 3>million instances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what the fuck?</v>

759
00:31:11.931 --> 00:31:13.820
<v Speaker 3>It's water under the bridge can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>picky.</v>

760
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:15.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to break a few eggs.</v>

761
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:18.643
<v Speaker 3>So they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if we investigated we would find a </v>

762
00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.170
<v Speaker 3>thousand more instances of criminality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said don't go.</v>

763
00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:25.100
<v Speaker 3>That was that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she never had an answer for it.</v>

764
00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.473
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now she's the darling of the </v>

765
00:31:28.011 --> 00:31:29.120
<v Speaker 3>corporate class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

766
00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:29.983
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same people who anointed Barack </v>

767
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:34.790
<v Speaker 3>Obama and Bill Clinton are the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are annoying her.</v>

768
00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:36.770
<v Speaker 3>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the problem.</v>

769
00:31:36.771 --> 00:31:37.820
<v Speaker 3>That's why I get so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

770
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:39.740
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brock Obama's entire cabinet,</v>

771
00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:42.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>came from an email from Citi group,</v>

772
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:43.543
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people trying to say that somehow </v>

773
00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:46.123
<v Speaker 3>corruption started on January 20th,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2017 are fooling themselves and that's </v>

774
00:31:50.991 --> 00:31:53.220
<v Speaker 3>what I'm fighting against on my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

775
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:53.320
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

776
00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.880
<v Speaker 4>you're one of the only people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing that.</v>

777
00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.900
<v Speaker 4>You're one of the only people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>online that you,</v>

778
00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:58.773
<v Speaker 4>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not obligated to shill for the </v>

779
00:32:02.951 --> 00:32:03.940
<v Speaker 4>left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not,</v>

780
00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:06.790
<v Speaker 4>you're not doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everybody else seems to be.</v>

781
00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:08.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean to everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're one of the people that are not</v>

782
00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:09.430
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you,</v>

783
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:10.263
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it just a handful of people who are </v>

784
00:32:11.571 --> 00:32:12.404
<v Speaker 4>not just so few.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so few that are calling out </v>

785
00:32:15.371 --> 00:32:18.260
<v Speaker 4>people in the Democratic Party for what </v>
<v Speaker 4>really is going on.</v>

786
00:32:18.261 --> 00:32:23.140
<v Speaker 4>Like I was infuriated when people that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>knew that I was friends with were trying</v>

787
00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:26.320
<v Speaker 4>to tell me that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Hillary Clinton was a good choice.</v>

788
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.240
<v Speaker 4>That's the same choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

789
00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.820
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if she's murdered people,</v>

790
00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:33.400
<v Speaker 4>but I know that I worried that she's </v>
<v Speaker 4>murdered people.</v>

791
00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:34.803
<v Speaker 4>That's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really wonder like this seth rich </v>

792
00:32:37.391 --> 00:32:38.224
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

793
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:39.703
<v Speaker 4>First of all</v>

794
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.080
<v Speaker 3>just lead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even need to go there.</v>

795
00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many other things,</v>

796
00:32:43.631 --> 00:32:44.464
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many other things that we know for a </v>

797
00:32:45.411 --> 00:32:47.210
<v Speaker 3>fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Clinton Foundation for instance,</v>

798
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:51.830
<v Speaker 3>so the Iraq war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm old enough to remember one being for</v>

799
00:32:51.831 --> 00:32:54.530
<v Speaker 3>the Iraq war was a disqualifier in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>democratic primary.</v>

800
00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

801
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.470

<v Speaker 3>That's why she lost a Bruck Obama,</v>

802
00:32:57.471 --> 00:33:01.640
<v Speaker 3>the first God time she ran and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden we're supposed to now people like</v>

<v Speaker 3>that was a long time ago.</v>

804

<v Speaker 3>Forget about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you go tell that to his </v>

805
00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:07.730
<v Speaker 3>soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a mother who's got a dead soldier?</v>

806
00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.010
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you go tell them out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>little girl just died an illegal war.</v>

807
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:13.430
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you go tell that to a couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred thousand Iraqis who are dead?</v>

808
00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:14.790
<v Speaker 3>Get over.</v>

00:33:14.791 --> 00:33:16.250
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

810
00:33:16.251 --> 00:33:18.070
<v Speaker 3>so I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

811
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:20.000
<v Speaker 3>also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

812
00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.550
<v Speaker 3>the Bill Clinton was no friend to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>working man.</v>

813
00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:23.383
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was this demise starting of the </v>

814
00:33:24.651 --> 00:33:27.700
<v Speaker 3>demise of this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So bill,</v>

815
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:28.663
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ronald Reagan's scared the shit out of </v>

816
00:33:29.481 --> 00:33:31.880
<v Speaker 3>the Democrat so much they decided to </v>
<v Speaker 3>become like them.</v>

817
00:33:31.881 --> 00:33:34.850
<v Speaker 3>And so what Bill Clinton did was he got </v>
<v Speaker 3>in bed with Wall Street,</v>

818
00:33:34.851 --> 00:33:37.940
<v Speaker 3>the military industrial complex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big Pharma health insurance,</v>

819
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:41.660
<v Speaker 3>and the Koch brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He started a thing called the Democratic</v>

820
00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:42.493
<v Speaker 3>Leadership Council with Al Gore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had executives from the Koch </v>

821
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:45.950
<v Speaker 3>Brothers on the Democratic Leadership </v>
<v Speaker 3>Council.</v>

822
00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.440
<v Speaker 3>They completely turned their back on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>working man.</v>

823
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:51.590
<v Speaker 3>And what happens when you have two </v>
<v Speaker 3>parties that are in bed with management,</v>

824
00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:54.200
<v Speaker 3>you get Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's exactly what happened.</v>

825
00:33:54.201 --> 00:33:55.034
<v Speaker 3>They gutted welfare at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They explored the prison population </v>

826
00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:00.170
<v Speaker 3>called black kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super predators at the same time,</v>

827
00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:01.004
<v Speaker 3>they did Nafta and then they deregulated</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wall Street which crashed the economy </v>

828
00:34:04.371 --> 00:34:06.830
<v Speaker 3>within 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what Democrats did.</v>

829
00:34:06.831 --> 00:34:07.664
<v Speaker 3>Democrats did shit that Ronald Reagan </v>
<v Speaker 3>could only dream about and his wet </v>

830
00:34:11.001 --> 00:34:11.510
<v Speaker 3>dreams.</v>

831
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:13.790
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't pass Nafta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>George Bush couldn't pass.</v>

832
00:34:13.791 --> 00:34:17.560
<v Speaker 3>Nafta took Bill Clinton to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Clinton gave the cover to the other</v>

833
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:21.710
<v Speaker 3>corporate democrats to go along with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that was the beginning of the end for</v>

834
00:34:21.711 --> 00:34:23.360
<v Speaker 3>the working class in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

835
00:34:23.361 --> 00:34:24.194
<v Speaker 3>now you know I wouldn't vote for Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clinton and that's why a lot of people </v>

836
00:34:27.021 --> 00:34:29.210
<v Speaker 3>on the left came after me and they still</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

837
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:30.163
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was confusing to me that you were </v>

838
00:34:31.071 --> 00:34:31.611
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

839
00:34:31.611 --> 00:34:33.770
<v Speaker 3>if you want to vote for a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive.</v>

840
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:34.870
<v Speaker 3>What about Jill Stein?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

841
00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.610
<v Speaker 3>If you vote for a party boat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a program.</v>

842
00:34:37.611 --> 00:34:39.200
<v Speaker 3>You actually agree with the grand new </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal,</v>

843
00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.070
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

844
00:34:40.071 --> 00:34:41.250
<v Speaker 3>And we know what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

845
00:34:41.251 --> 00:34:42.710
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're throwing away your </v>
<v Speaker 3>vote.</v>

846
00:34:42.711 --> 00:34:45.020
<v Speaker 3>Like how?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How will your throwing away your vote?</v>

847
00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:45.973
<v Speaker 3>So we all know for a fact because of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wikileaks emails that Hillary Clinton </v>

848
00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.710
<v Speaker 3>had a thing called the Pied Piper </v>
<v Speaker 3>strategy,</v>

849
00:34:51.711 --> 00:34:54.950
<v Speaker 3>which was she told her minions in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>press,</v>

850
00:34:54.951 --> 00:34:56.540
<v Speaker 3>please prop up Donald Trump.</v>

851
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:57.643
<v Speaker 3>Prop him up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did she want Donald Trump to be </v>

852
00:34:59.061 --> 00:34:59.894
<v Speaker 3>propped up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you want it to run against </v>

853
00:35:00.621 --> 00:35:01.454
<v Speaker 3>Donald trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because she knew that she was so </v>

854
00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:04.634
<v Speaker 3>repulsive to most of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She needed someone who was more </v>

855
00:35:06.591 --> 00:35:09.680
<v Speaker 3>repulsive than hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turns out that was a bad calculation,</v>

856
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:12.650
<v Speaker 3>is terrible calculus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's called the Pied Piper strategy</v>

857
00:35:12.651 --> 00:35:13.484
<v Speaker 3>and everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why the you turn on Chris Hayes </v>

858
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:15.913
<v Speaker 3>and he would show donald trump's empty </v>
<v Speaker 3>podium for an hour instead of a Bernie </v>

859
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.113
<v Speaker 3>Sanders and then he wagged his finger at</v>
<v Speaker 3>people with no money and no power for </v>

860
00:35:22.461 --> 00:35:25.580
<v Speaker 3>not voting for a corporatist warmonger </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Hillary Clinton who just.</v>

861
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:26.623
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think the people in Michigan </v>

862
00:35:28.161 --> 00:35:28.994
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe because she put half of them in </v>

863
00:35:30.321 --> 00:35:31.154
<v Speaker 3>fucking prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because she passed Nafta and Barack </v>

864
00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:37.380
<v Speaker 3>Obama was trying to sell tpp at the top </v>
<v Speaker 3>of his lungs at the same time was trying</v>

865
00:35:37.381 --> 00:35:38.190
<v Speaker 3>to get people</v>

866
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.800
<v Speaker 1>to vote for her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know what the fuck was going on and</v>

867
00:35:40.801 --> 00:35:42.270
<v Speaker 1>that's why half the country doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>vote,</v>

868
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:45.030
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to wag their finger at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who actually do vote,</v>

869
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:48.930
<v Speaker 1>who come out and vote their conscience </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't fucking prop up evil.</v>

870
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:49.853
<v Speaker 1>You know what the voting for the lesser </v>
<v Speaker 1>of two evils gets you donald fucking </v>

871
00:35:52.291 --> 00:35:53.124
<v Speaker 1>trump with is also a really sneaky thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens where you have two parties </v>

872
00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:03.630
<v Speaker 1>and one of them you think of as this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative warmongering party,</v>

873
00:36:03.631 --> 00:36:06.960
<v Speaker 1>which automatically makes the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>party the the enemy of that.</v>

874
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not.</v>

875
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:08.521
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

876
00:36:08.521 --> 00:36:10.250
<v Speaker 1>we have two pro war parties and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the point.</v>

877
00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:13.860
<v Speaker 1>There's not an opposition party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They oppose trump on the most ridiculous</v>

878
00:36:13.861 --> 00:36:14.694
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just voted for an extra </v>

879
00:36:15.271 --> 00:36:18.060
<v Speaker 1>$160,000,000,000 to go to the war </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>

880
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:19.770
<v Speaker 1>One hundred 60 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's remember.</v>

881
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders wanted to pay for free </v>
<v Speaker 1>college,</v>

882
00:36:21.871 --> 00:36:23.940
<v Speaker 1>which was somewhere around $65,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars.</v>

883
00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:26.490
<v Speaker 1>So and everybody said he's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

884
00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:29.580
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to pay for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just did that in a blink of an eye.</v>

885
00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:30.443
<v Speaker 1>They passed $160,000,000,000 to a war </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine that we don't have an enemy to </v>

886
00:36:33.361 --> 00:36:33.991
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

887
00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Russia spending $65,000,000,000 a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>on their military.</v>

888
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.270
<v Speaker 1>There are paper tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got no fucking enemies out there.</v>

889
00:36:39.271 --> 00:36:41.460
<v Speaker 1>We have to keep inventing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the last,</v>

890
00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:44.280
<v Speaker 1>the last enemy they invented was isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis.</v>

891
00:36:44.281 --> 00:36:46.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were supposed to shit our pants over</v>

892
00:36:46.111 --> 00:36:46.441
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

893
00:36:46.441 --> 00:36:49.590
<v Speaker 1>because they have kitchen knives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll cut your head off with a kitchen</v>

894
00:36:49.591 --> 00:36:50.424
<v Speaker 1>knife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm supposed to be afraid </v>

895
00:36:51.301 --> 00:36:52.650
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

896
00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:53.940
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

897
00:36:53.941 --> 00:36:58.290
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how they can keep us scared</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they can keep perpetual war going.</v>

898
00:36:58.291 --> 00:37:01.170
<v Speaker 1>This isn't Orwellian nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Democrats right now,</v>

899
00:37:01.171 --> 00:37:03.090
<v Speaker 1>she'd be screaming about the Pentagon </v>
<v Speaker 1>budget,</v>

900
00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.760
<v Speaker 1>but they're not screaming about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're complicit.</v>

901
00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.373
<v Speaker 1>They're in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's wrong with this </v>

902
00:37:08.761 --> 00:37:10.770
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we can't have nice things.</v>

903
00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.520
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they tell you that you were broken,</v>

904
00:37:14.521 --> 00:37:17.220
<v Speaker 1>we can't afford stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't mean we can't afford trillion</v>

905
00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.810
<v Speaker 1>dollar war is trillion dollar bank </v>
<v Speaker 1>bailout.</v>

906
00:37:18.811 --> 00:37:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Billion dollar oil subsidies and prison </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction.</v>

907
00:37:21.451 --> 00:37:22.284
<v Speaker 1>That's not what they mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They mean we can't afford shit like </v>

908
00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:24.553
<v Speaker 1>healthcare or education or roads or </v>
<v Speaker 1>bridges or firemen or libraries or </v>

909
00:37:27.571 --> 00:37:29.250
<v Speaker 1>anything that makes your fucking life </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

910
00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.140
<v Speaker 1>Because whenever they need bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got it.</v>

911
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're broke for social security.</v>

912
00:37:32.641 --> 00:37:33.870
<v Speaker 1>We're booked for Medicare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>

913
00:37:33.871 --> 00:37:34.681
<v Speaker 1>Above for bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

914
00:37:34.681 --> 00:37:35.514
<v Speaker 1>we got bond money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we keep it running because we're not </v>

915
00:37:37.951 --> 00:37:42.951
<v Speaker 1>really in a war in the sense of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>world war two or World War One,</v>

916
00:37:43.141 --> 00:37:43.974
<v Speaker 1>we're in this weird war of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a calculated through all </v>

917
00:37:47.401 --> 00:37:48.900
<v Speaker 1>economic words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're all.</v>

918
00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:49.753
<v Speaker 1>So we went into Iraq for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the oil Libya based because he </v>

919
00:37:52.921 --> 00:37:57.180
<v Speaker 1>wanted to go off the petrodollar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is stunning how much funding this</v>

920
00:37:57.181 --> 00:37:58.014
<v Speaker 1>kind of war gets versus all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different social programs that we need </v>

921
00:38:00.511 --> 00:38:01.050
<v Speaker 1>in this country.</v>

922
00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Yet infrastructure programs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

923
00:38:03.091 --> 00:38:05.850
<v Speaker 1>We and people always think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how are you going to pay for that?</v>

924
00:38:05.851 --> 00:38:06.684
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to spend any more money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can actually spend less and less </v>

925
00:38:09.211 --> 00:38:11.630
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to spend $750,</v>

926
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.500
<v Speaker 1>million dollars a year on a military </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bloated.</v>

927
00:38:13.501 --> 00:38:15.270
<v Speaker 1>We have thousand bases around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

928
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.133
<v Speaker 1>around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know how many bases there </v>

929
00:38:17.521 --> 00:38:18.354
<v Speaker 1>are because lots of them are secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you say to the argument that </v>

930
00:38:20.821 --> 00:38:23.340
<v Speaker 1>we need them in order to stay safe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>

931
00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:25.020
<v Speaker 1>That's the big argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

932
00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:28.980
<v Speaker 1>The big argument is this is the way we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've destroyed Isis because isis was on</v>

933
00:38:28.981 --> 00:38:30.820
<v Speaker 1>their way to building up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We invented this,</v>

934
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:33.690
<v Speaker 1>we invented al Qaeda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we invented isis.</v>

935
00:38:33.691 --> 00:38:37.840
<v Speaker 1>We certainly aided in their development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their development,</v>

936
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:38.733
<v Speaker 1>and we then we directly funded them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know the whole Mujahideen </v>

937
00:38:42.761 --> 00:38:45.700
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was Osama bin Laden was our guy.</v>

938
00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:49.080
<v Speaker 1>He's our guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't t Russian terror,</v>

939
00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:53.230
<v Speaker 1>anti Russian freedom fighter is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they called Osama bin Laden and then all</v>

940
00:38:53.231 --> 00:38:54.730
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden they didn't need them </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

941
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:55.833
<v Speaker 1>So why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're still in Afghanistan 17 years </v>

942
00:38:58.061 --> 00:38:58.960
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three more years.</v>

943
00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:02.230
<v Speaker 1>That word gets a gold watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what did they do?</v>

944
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

945
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:06.220
<v Speaker 1>what did they do to get us out of there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally what is,</v>

946
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:09.970
<v Speaker 1>what is there is none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no exit strategy.</v>

947
00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:11.283
<v Speaker 1>Exit strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no exit strategy from the </v>

948
00:39:12.461 --> 00:39:13.294
<v Speaker 1>Mideast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

949
00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:15.640
<v Speaker 1>they just announced we're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>permanently in Syria.</v>

950
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:17.470
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

951
00:39:17.471 --> 00:39:20.080
<v Speaker 1>the Syrian war is complete bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those gas attacks.</v>

952
00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Now I've been completely debunked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't believe him the first time.</v>

953
00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:27.430
<v Speaker 1>What happened during those guests tax?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that's called a false flag.</v>

954
00:39:27.431 --> 00:39:31.270
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is they wanted the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States to come in on their side,</v>

955
00:39:31.271 --> 00:39:32.830
<v Speaker 1>the Obama side to overthrow him.</v>

956
00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:36.100
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what they would do is they would do a</v>

957
00:39:36.101 --> 00:39:38.620
<v Speaker 1>gas attack on their own people and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>blame it on his side.</v>

958
00:39:38.621 --> 00:39:41.120
<v Speaker 1>And then this has been proven be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

959
00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.310
<v Speaker 1>they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

960
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.450
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

961
00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:47.410
<v Speaker 1>and the first time was the night think </v>
<v Speaker 1>2013 in Barack Obama wanted to bomb.</v>

962
00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:50.920
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I knew it was bullshit then.</v>

963
00:39:50.921 --> 00:39:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when everybody freaked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out about that?</v>

964
00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:53.960
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he didn't bomb them.</v>

965
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Remember he didn't get to bomb them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was like,</v>

966
00:39:55.961 --> 00:39:57.040
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

967
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:57.883
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's put it to a vote in the congress </v>

968
00:39:58.661 --> 00:40:01.240
<v Speaker 1>and the people don't want war Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the people said,</v>

969
00:40:01.241 --> 00:40:02.074
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes like,</v>

970
00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:03.493
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess what they did it anyway they </v>

971
00:40:05.141 --> 00:40:07.270
<v Speaker 1>bought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they dropped so many bombs on Syria.</v>

972
00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:09.820
<v Speaker 1>They ran out of bumps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact,</v>

973
00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:10.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

974
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:12.370
<v Speaker 1>So the air force was out of box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which year was this?</v>

975
00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:13.523
<v Speaker 1>So was it 2015?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That dropped so many bombs in the </v>

976
00:40:16.241 --> 00:40:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Mideast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ran out of bombs.</v>

977
00:40:17.351 --> 00:40:18.790
<v Speaker 1>That just a fucking fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

978
00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:21.210
<v Speaker 1>if you buy all these bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to use those.</v>

979
00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do with them?</v>

980
00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:24.803
<v Speaker 1>They're just going to sit around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what if somebody accidentally sets </v>

981
00:40:26.591 --> 00:40:27.424
<v Speaker 1>one off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether an American soil and I don't </v>

982
00:40:29.051 --> 00:40:30.550
<v Speaker 1>want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have that happen.</v>

983
00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.980
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the weird thing that the left</v>

984
00:40:32.981 --> 00:40:33.814
<v Speaker 1>is doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're attacking Donald Trump from the </v>

985
00:40:35.621 --> 00:40:38.050
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do I mean by that?</v>

986
00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.930
<v Speaker 1>So when they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they say,</v>

987
00:40:40.931 --> 00:40:41.764
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump is a Putin puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only way you can prove you're </v>

988
00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:48.070
<v Speaker 1>not a Putin puppet is you've got a bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody you got to bomb Syria.</v>

989
00:40:48.071 --> 00:40:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

990
00:40:49.211 --> 00:40:50.044
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's president today because he bombed </v>

991
00:40:50.801 --> 00:40:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Syria.</v>

992
00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Remember that fucking Brian Williamson </v>
<v Speaker 1>was nothing in his pants.</v>

993
00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:57.250
<v Speaker 1>All he bombed was airstrips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what they're saying.</v>

994
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:58.263
<v Speaker 1>So they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

995
00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:00.000
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bombed airstrips.</v>

996
00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:00.873
<v Speaker 1>Oh you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bombed the old planes and not the </v>

997
00:41:02.111 --> 00:41:03.400
<v Speaker 1>new plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that is,</v>

998
00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.353
<v Speaker 1>you're attacking Donald Trump from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right because left people are supposed </v>

999
00:41:07.061 --> 00:41:12.061
<v Speaker 1>to be for detente and you're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be antiwar and anti and anti empire.</v>

1000
00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what new attack Donald trump going,</v>

1001
00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.480
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't really bomb them.</v>

1002
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:17.373
<v Speaker 1>You're attacking them from the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying he should be more </v>

1003
00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.890
<v Speaker 1>militaristic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fucked up.</v>

1004
00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it supports the argument that everything</v>

1005
00:41:22.571 --> 00:41:23.381
<v Speaker 1>is circular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1006
00:41:23.381 --> 00:41:25.950
<v Speaker 1>That as far right as you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far left as you get,</v>

1007
00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:30.280
<v Speaker 1>you really come to some sort of strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological point zero point.</v>

1008
00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:31.143
<v Speaker 1>That can't be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not in this instance because what's </v>

1009
00:41:33.141 --> 00:41:33.974
<v Speaker 1>happening there is corporate right wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats are attacking trump for not </v>

1010
00:41:38.121 --> 00:41:38.954
<v Speaker 1>being right enough.</v>

1011
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:41.150
<v Speaker 1>When you're talking about is where I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

1012
00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.013
<v Speaker 1>where I'm antiwar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's also anti war anti </v>

1013
00:41:44.211 --> 00:41:45.044
<v Speaker 1>intervention as people on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people voted for Donald </v>

1014
00:41:47.361 --> 00:41:48.194
<v Speaker 1>trump because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he always said he was an anti </v>

1015
00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:51.074
<v Speaker 1>interventionists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to get us out of the Middle </v>

1016
00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.233
<v Speaker 1>East.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy to be there and bring our </v>

1017
00:41:54.591 --> 00:41:55.424
<v Speaker 1>boys home and all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why a lot of people did vote </v>

1018
00:41:56.781 --> 00:41:59.420
<v Speaker 1>for trump because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1019
00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:00.373
<v Speaker 1>and that's why a lot of people said they</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt more comfortable voting for trump </v>

1020
00:42:02.961 --> 00:42:03.794
<v Speaker 1>because he was because hillary actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>promised more war in Syria than he did </v>

1021
00:42:06.501 --> 00:42:07.150
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1022
00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:09.410
<v Speaker 1>and that's turning out to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1023
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.273
<v Speaker 1>because she wanted a no fly zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means we're going to shoot down a </v>

1024
00:42:12.081 --> 00:42:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Russian jet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you fucking crazy?</v>

1025
00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:19.300
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the,</v>

1026
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.930
<v Speaker 1>on the left antiwar.</v>

1027
00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:21.793
<v Speaker 1>There's no antiwar movement in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country that's represented by a </v>

1028
00:42:24.561 --> 00:42:27.410
<v Speaker 1>political party right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that this right though,</v>

1029
00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:30.740
<v Speaker 1>the way the left is attacking Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump from the right,</v>

1030
00:42:30.741 --> 00:42:31.574
<v Speaker 1>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you think it's just because they </v>

1031
00:42:32.631 --> 00:42:35.150
<v Speaker 1>see an opening there to criticize and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1032
00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:36.093
<v Speaker 1>to point out his vulnerabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing with this whole </v>

1033
00:42:39.621 --> 00:42:40.454
<v Speaker 1>Russian narrative?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the establishment not wanting to </v>

1034
00:42:43.191 --> 00:42:44.024
<v Speaker 1>examine the system that gave us Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump and so they want to distract you </v>

1035
00:42:46.821 --> 00:42:48.770
<v Speaker 1>with Russia until we get to the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>election,</v>

1036
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.940
<v Speaker 1>then it's working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1037
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:51.303
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Distract you from a system that's </v>

1038
00:42:53.841 --> 00:42:54.674
<v Speaker 1>archaic and outdated and it doesn't work</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people are not asking that question </v>

1039
00:42:58.761 --> 00:43:00.410
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did people vote for Donald Trump?</v>

1040
00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:01.244
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only time they asked that they took </v>

1041
00:43:02.151 --> 00:43:02.984
<v Speaker 1>the shittiest answer was because racism </v>
<v Speaker 1>really the same country that voted for </v>

1042
00:43:05.691 --> 00:43:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama twice.</v>

1043
00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Somebody just doubled down on that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other day saying,</v>

1044
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:13.220
<v Speaker 1>are there racists?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Berg or they're racist.</v>

1045
00:43:13.221 --> 00:43:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Who voted for Donald Trump?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1046
00:43:14.631 --> 00:43:15.680
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>

1047
00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:19.010
<v Speaker 1>It's Alonzo Bowden said it best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1048
00:43:19.011 --> 00:43:22.340
<v Speaker 1>not all trump supporters are racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all racists are trump supporters.</v>

1049
00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Alonzo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1050
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:29.870
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1051
00:43:29.871 --> 00:43:30.704
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to a trump rally and it was </v>

1052
00:43:31.671 --> 00:43:35.930
<v Speaker 1>disgusting and scary and it was all </v>
<v Speaker 1>xenophobia and it was all race.</v>

1053
00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:39.540
<v Speaker 1>It was worse than I thought it was going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to beat 'em sound.</v>

1054
00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:42.380
<v Speaker 1>He tapped into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's interesting about him tapping</v>

1055
00:43:42.381 --> 00:43:45.590
<v Speaker 1>into that is this is not something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he had been timing on about for years.</v>

1056
00:43:45.591 --> 00:43:48.470
<v Speaker 1>He was a Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this time he's not an ideologue,</v>

1057
00:43:48.471 --> 00:43:49.160
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1058
00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.720
<v Speaker 1>I heard when he got into office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

1059
00:43:50.721 --> 00:43:52.220
<v Speaker 1>why don't we just give everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>Medicare,</v>

1060
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:53.743
<v Speaker 1>which is of course the answer you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave everybody Medicare saving this </v>

1061
00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:59.000
<v Speaker 1>money instead of food stamps has given </v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

1062
00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:01.120
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this issue with people.</v>

1063
00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:04.160
<v Speaker 1>They buy cigarettes and booze and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>with food stamps.</v>

1064
00:44:04.161 --> 00:44:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Just let's just give them food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad idea.</v>

1065
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:09.140
<v Speaker 1>That's not a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's healthy,</v>

1066
00:44:09.141 --> 00:44:14.141
<v Speaker 1>good food places where people can go and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up healthy good food,</v>

1067
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:17.350
<v Speaker 1>that might be a very good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Itto A,</v>

1068
00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:19.880
<v Speaker 1>we need an infrastructure plan in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

1069
00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and FDR did that,</v>

1070
00:44:23.901 --> 00:44:25.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gave old people retirement.</v>

1071
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:28.460
<v Speaker 1>He gave young people a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He put pike,</v>

1072
00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 1>gave people dignity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gave him a job and he said,</v>

1073
00:44:32.011 --> 00:44:33.370
<v Speaker 1>if you're willing to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have a jet.</v>

1074
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The old saying,</v>

1075
00:44:34.351 --> 00:44:35.184
<v Speaker 1>when I grew up as they're going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken in every pot and a car in every </v>

1076
00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:39.240
<v Speaker 1>garage or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

1077
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:41.790
<v Speaker 1>and they don't say that shit anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1078
00:44:41.791 --> 00:44:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Because the government is not there to </v>
<v Speaker 1>help you anymore,</v>

1079
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:45.480
<v Speaker 1>but the government does pretend that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

1080
00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has to have.</v>

1081
00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:49.080
<v Speaker 1>That trump has going on about is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much job.</v>

1082
00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:50.123
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many more people are working today </v>

1083
00:44:51.031 --> 00:44:54.190
<v Speaker 1>than before African American </v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployment is at the lowest point.</v>

1084
00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Forty years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The economy's booming.</v>

1085
00:44:56.701 --> 00:44:58.860
<v Speaker 1>All these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The economy,</v>

1086
00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:02.010
<v Speaker 1>when they say the economy's booming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they mean Wall Street is booming.</v>

1087
00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:07.500
<v Speaker 1>The correlation between Wall Street and </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular people's lives is not a.</v>

1088
00:45:07.501 --> 00:45:09.630
<v Speaker 1>well though stock market has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>booming.</v>

1089
00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I got called into CNN to do a</v>

1090
00:45:12.061 --> 00:45:15.210
<v Speaker 1>thing when the stock market crash </v>
<v Speaker 1>crossed 13,000.</v>

1091
00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Now it's up 25,000 and that was a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>watershed moment.</v>

1092
00:45:18.961 --> 00:45:20.280
<v Speaker 1>That was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like eight years ago.</v>

1093
00:45:20.281 --> 00:45:22.350
<v Speaker 1>I got called in to do that at CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like,</v>

1094
00:45:22.351 --> 00:45:23.040
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>

1095
00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:25.500
<v Speaker 1>So we've gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've doubled the stock market.</v>

1096
00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:28.530
<v Speaker 1>People's paychecks have been doubled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People's lives gotten worse actually,</v>

1097
00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:29.713
<v Speaker 1>but I have a problem with saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's just too many people </v>

1098
00:45:32.821 --> 00:45:33.654
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with.</v>

1099
00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:35.250
<v Speaker 1>When you say people's lives have gotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse,</v>

1100
00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:37.360
<v Speaker 1>like what people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1101
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:38.260
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too many people,</v>

1102
00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:41.250
<v Speaker 1>63 percent of the country can't afford a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand dollar emergency.</v>

1103
00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Half the country right now is either </v>
<v Speaker 1>poor or low income.</v>

1104
00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:46.013
<v Speaker 1>Thirty 50 percent of all wage earners in</v>
<v Speaker 1>less than $30,000 a year in the richest </v>

1105
00:45:49.261 --> 00:45:50.940
<v Speaker 1>country in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack Ma,</v>

1106
00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:56.390
<v Speaker 1>who is the Jeff Bezos of Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he runs the Amazon of Asia and he said,</v>

1107
00:45:57.061 --> 00:45:58.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with the United States isn't</v>

1108
00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:01.260
<v Speaker 1>making money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that you guys don't distribute it.</v>

1109
00:46:01.261 --> 00:46:02.094
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's communist shit coming over from </v>

1110
00:46:04.051 --> 00:46:05.280
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to let that slide,</v>

1111
00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:07.213
<v Speaker 1>but let's call those communists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Billionaires are buying up all our real </v>

1112
00:46:09.181 --> 00:46:10.014
<v Speaker 1>estate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did a socialist country produced all </v>

1113
00:46:11.221 --> 00:46:12.390
<v Speaker 1>those billionaires?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1114
00:46:12.391 --> 00:46:13.224
<v Speaker 1>go to the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as they got into communism or </v>

1115
00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:17.220
<v Speaker 1>into capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather,</v>

1116
00:46:17.221 --> 00:46:19.330
<v Speaker 1>they did it in a very ruthless way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1117
00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:23.070
<v Speaker 1>you look at what it's really kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up like what's going on with some</v>

1118
00:46:23.071 --> 00:46:25.800
<v Speaker 1>of the places where we buy our goods </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Foxconn,</v>

1119
00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:30.000
<v Speaker 1>where they have nets around the building</v>
<v Speaker 1>and keep it from fucking jumping off.</v>

1120
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.150
<v Speaker 1>But when trump has been in office for </v>
<v Speaker 1>only a year,</v>

1121
00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:35.210
<v Speaker 1>he can't expect all those things to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

1122
00:46:35.211 --> 00:46:38.160
<v Speaker 1>But his argument has been that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are improving.</v>

1123
00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.440
<v Speaker 1>You think at this all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all horseshit.</v>

1124
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:41.333
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so why is African American </v>

1125
00:46:42.841 --> 00:46:44.790
<v Speaker 1>unemployment at the lowest rate that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been in 40 years?</v>

1126
00:46:44.791 --> 00:46:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Is that because it's unreported?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people stopped looking for jobs.</v>

1127
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:49.703
<v Speaker 1>They report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stopped counting those as being </v>

1128
00:46:51.301 --> 00:46:52.530
<v Speaker 1>unemployed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's that.</v>

1129
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:53.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he stopped taking unemployment and </v>

1130
00:46:54.931 --> 00:46:56.670
<v Speaker 1>they stopped looking for jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't count them.</v>

1131
00:46:56.671 --> 00:46:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't count them,</v>

1132
00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.420
<v Speaker 1>but they're still unemployed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real sneaky statistics.</v>

1133
00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also a really like it.</v>

1134
00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.930
<v Speaker 1>If someone was honest about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like it to like,</v>

1135
00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:08.070
<v Speaker 1>what's the real unemployment rate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we want to know.</v>

1136
00:47:08.071 --> 00:47:10.200
<v Speaker 1>What's the real unemployment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would we find that out though?</v>

1137
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I noticed a guy named Mark Blythe.</v>

1138
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.990
<v Speaker 1>He would probably know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an economist.</v>

1139
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.190
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1140
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:21.750
<v Speaker 1>he coined the term global trumpism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a great line.</v>

1141
00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:25.020
<v Speaker 1>He tells the elites about how we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>

1142
00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:27.360
<v Speaker 1>They're running the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course I'm going to butcher it,</v>

1143
00:47:27.361 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 1>but he says he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hamptons aren't a defensible</v>

1144
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.050
<v Speaker 3>position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a low lying area.</v>

1145
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.210
<v Speaker 3>He got a Scottish accent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Hamptons,</v>

1146
00:47:34.211 --> 00:47:37.360
<v Speaker 3>or as a low lying area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very bad area to be that,</v>

1147
00:47:37.361 --> 00:47:40.390
<v Speaker 3>a defensible position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning when the fucking people come for</v>

1148
00:47:40.391 --> 00:47:41.410
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna you're,</v>

1149
00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:42.313
<v Speaker 3>you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get sides is a military base in the </v>

1150
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:45.250
<v Speaker 3>tens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1151
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:47.350
<v Speaker 3>You're not up on a hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People can get to you.</v>

1152
00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:50.110
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of gold diggers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the jobs suck.</v>

1153
00:47:50.111 --> 00:47:52.540
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's job sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we know we,</v>

1154
00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:54.100
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we hollowed out the unions.</v>

1155
00:47:54.101 --> 00:47:57.610
<v Speaker 3>Nafta was the crushing blow to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>unions in this country.</v>

1156
00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.440
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1157
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:01.263
<v Speaker 3>we need unions is one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that actually cush </v>

1158
00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.650
<v Speaker 3>cushions the blow of the brutalities of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a free market,</v>

1159
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have unions,</v>

1160
00:48:10.121 --> 00:48:13.420
<v Speaker 3>you have social programs because </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalism fucks everybody.</v>

1161
00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:14.373
<v Speaker 3>And so you have to have all of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things in place to kind of cushion the </v>

1162
00:48:16.331 --> 00:48:18.700
<v Speaker 3>blow of it and we get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got rid of them,</v>

1163
00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:19.563
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Clinton gutted welfare at the same </v>

1164
00:48:20.531 --> 00:48:22.600
<v Speaker 3>time he did Nafta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1165
00:48:22.601 --> 00:48:24.580
<v Speaker 3>and then he floated the prison </v>
<v Speaker 3>population.</v>

1166
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:26.180
<v Speaker 3>But people that I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1167
00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:27.033
<v Speaker 4>were in unions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly some friends that I have </v>

1168
00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:33.040
<v Speaker 4>that were in the auto union were saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it was getting completely bloated.</v>

1169
00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:37.450
<v Speaker 4>They were doing were having two people </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing a job that was only for one person</v>

1170
00:48:37.451 --> 00:48:42.451
<v Speaker 4>and there was all this there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was all this real wanting,</v>

1171
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:44.223
<v Speaker 4>purposeful waste,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this was all designed into certain </v>

1172
00:48:46.841 --> 00:48:49.450
<v Speaker 4>contracts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a buddy of mine that was an auto</v>

1173
00:48:49.451 --> 00:48:50.284
<v Speaker 4>worker in Detroit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said we had shifts where there was </v>

1174
00:48:52.751 --> 00:48:53.584
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be two people on the job and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody knew it was a real simple </v>

1175
00:48:55.181 --> 00:48:56.140
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You work on machine,</v>

1176
00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.153
<v Speaker 4>so I would work four hours and he would </v>
<v Speaker 4>work four hours or I would work a day </v>

1177
00:49:00.551 --> 00:49:01.384
<v Speaker 4>and he would work a day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we both punched in and that was </v>

1178
00:49:03.491 --> 00:49:04.630
<v Speaker 4>just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just common.</v>

1179
00:49:04.631 --> 00:49:05.464
<v Speaker 4>And there was several of those and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes and you were getting $100,000 a </v>

1180
00:49:07.631 --> 00:49:09.550
<v Speaker 4>year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>$200,000 a year for some jobs,</v>

1181
00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:10.723
<v Speaker 4>just ridiculous amounts of money for </v>
<v Speaker 4>jobs that really didn't warn that kind </v>

1182
00:49:14.201 --> 00:49:17.170
<v Speaker 4>of income.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said this was all negotiated into</v>

1183
00:49:17.171 --> 00:49:18.004
<v Speaker 4>the contract is like it's a good thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get fair wages and healthy wages and </v>

1184
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:23.740
<v Speaker 4>health insurance and all these different</v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

1185
00:49:23.741 --> 00:49:25.480
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was unquestionably bloated,</v>

1186
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:26.493
<v Speaker 4>which opened the door to all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>factories going into Mexico and all </v>

1187
00:49:29.321 --> 00:49:30.154
<v Speaker 4>these other places.</v>

1188
00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:32.110
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what opened the door for those factories</v>

1189
00:49:32.111 --> 00:49:32.591
<v Speaker 3>going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1190
00:49:32.591 --> 00:49:34.990
<v Speaker 3>Why I would say two things to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1191
00:49:34.991 --> 00:49:35.824
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of anti logical to think that </v>

1192
00:49:37.271 --> 00:49:38.680
<v Speaker 3>the union would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1193
00:49:38.681 --> 00:49:41.920
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to negotiate on this and</v>
<v Speaker 3>go ahead and take our jobs.</v>

1194
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:45.640
<v Speaker 3>Both of those jobs to Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think they had a chance number.</v>

1195
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:46.503
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Number two is if you look at the </v>

1196
00:49:47.441 --> 00:49:48.760
<v Speaker 3>strongest economies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1197
00:49:48.761 --> 00:49:50.470
<v Speaker 3>You look at Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have strong unions,</v>

1198
00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:51.850
<v Speaker 3>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have strong unions.</v>

1199
00:49:51.851 --> 00:49:54.010
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the union sit on their boards.</v>

1200
00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:54.961
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also,</v>

1201
00:49:54.961 --> 00:49:55.180
<v Speaker 3>it was</v>

1202
00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.013
<v Speaker 4>a real problem in the 19 eighties and a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess a little bit in the late </v>

1203
00:49:59.801 --> 00:50:03.550
<v Speaker 4>seventies when the oil crisis happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>America was making dog shit cars.</v>

1204
00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:06.730
<v Speaker 4>They're just making terrible and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>Japanese,</v>

1205
00:50:06.731 --> 00:50:08.530
<v Speaker 4>we're making these cars that were </v>
<v Speaker 4>goddamn bulletproof,</v>

1206
00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.310
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you'd make it,</v>

1207
00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:13.110
<v Speaker 4>you'd buy a Toyota Corolla and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking thing would go 400,000,</v>

1208
00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.850
<v Speaker 4>500,000 miles when I was single problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1209
00:50:15.851 --> 00:50:19.210
<v Speaker 4>you buy an oldsmobile and that thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>would shit the bed inside of a month and</v>

1210
00:50:19.211 --> 00:50:21.430
<v Speaker 4>a half and you'd be fucking furious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everybody was like,</v>

1211
00:50:21.431 --> 00:50:22.750
<v Speaker 4>buy American,</v>
<v Speaker 4>buy American.</v>

1212
00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.730
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of people like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well fuck you man.</v>

1213
00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.790
<v Speaker 4>You're making shitty cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got the emmy.</v>

1214
00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:27.843
<v Speaker 4>I bought a dodge Daytona,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had it for maybe three months and the </v>

1215
00:50:32.541 --> 00:50:33.374
<v Speaker 4>handle fell off in my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to open the door and it came off </v>

1216
00:50:36.291 --> 00:50:38.750
<v Speaker 4>in my hand while he motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was like,</v>

1217
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:42.440
<v Speaker 4>I think one of the first car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first car I ever bought.</v>

1218
00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.780
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I was a road comic.</v>

1219
00:50:45.781 --> 00:50:47.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to buy a Honda comment.</v>

1220
00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

1221
00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:50.520
<v Speaker 1>this has been a early nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1222
00:50:50.521 --> 00:50:52.920
<v Speaker 1>I have to buy a car that I can rely on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And same thing.</v>

1223
00:50:52.921 --> 00:50:54.810
<v Speaker 1>I had an accord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a civic.</v>

1224
00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:57.380
<v Speaker 1>So the best is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never breaks.</v>

1225
00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:59.790
<v Speaker 1>They never broke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So uh,</v>

1226
00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:02.340
<v Speaker 1>so I would look at that unions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the problem.</v>

1227
00:51:02.341 --> 00:51:03.174
<v Speaker 1>The unions aren't the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yang fact unions are an answer to the </v>

1228
00:51:05.461 --> 00:51:07.230
<v Speaker 1>problem and if you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>economies,</v>

1229
00:51:07.231 --> 00:51:10.380
<v Speaker 1>everyone wants to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at Germany by the way,</v>

1230
00:51:10.381 --> 00:51:11.214
<v Speaker 1>the German unions just won the right for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 28 hour to work 28 hours a week and </v>

1231
00:51:15.301 --> 00:51:18.510
<v Speaker 1>they got a four percent pay raise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that's eight hours too much.</v>

1232
00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:21.690
<v Speaker 1>I would agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think I'm talking too much.</v>

1233
00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:22.563
<v Speaker 4>Yesterday with Johann Hari who wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 4>book on depression and one of the major </v>

1234
00:51:25.691 --> 00:51:28.360
<v Speaker 4>causes being the way people live their </v>
<v Speaker 4>lives without control,</v>

1235
00:51:28.361 --> 00:51:29.194
<v Speaker 4>doing things they don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was saying that somewhere in the </v>

1236
00:51:31.271 --> 00:51:32.104
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood of 87 percent of the people</v>
<v Speaker 4>are doing things they don't want to be </v>

1237
00:51:35.141 --> 00:51:38.050
<v Speaker 4>doing most of the time for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a job.</v>

1238
00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:41.120
<v Speaker 4>And I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was making the argument that we,</v>

1239
00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:42.063
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've set up this structure that's just </v>

1240
00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:44.733
<v Speaker 4>completely ridiculous and we've stuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>with it because it's just the way we've </v>

1241
00:51:47.231 --> 00:51:49.960
<v Speaker 4>always done things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This 40 hour work week plus overtime,</v>

1242
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:52.690
<v Speaker 4>it's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're losing your life.</v>

1243
00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:53.471
<v Speaker 1>The end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1244
00:51:53.471 --> 00:51:55.290
<v Speaker 1>we'd be working more if it wasn't for </v>
<v Speaker 1>unions.</v>

1245
00:51:55.310 --> 00:51:57.340
<v Speaker 1>We had weakened because of unions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1246
00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:58.393
<v Speaker 4>Goes back to the foxconn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have unions and they have </v>

1247
00:52:00.531 --> 00:52:02.870
<v Speaker 4>fucking nets around their building and </v>
<v Speaker 4>dormitories where they live,</v>

1248
00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:03.650
<v Speaker 4>where they work.</v>

1249
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:05.540
<v Speaker 1>So that's when people say about Amazon </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1250
00:52:05.541 --> 00:52:07.130
<v Speaker 1>And my whole thing is like people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1251
00:52:07.131 --> 00:52:08.360
<v Speaker 1>why do you still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1252
00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.690
<v Speaker 1>you can't use Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

1253
00:52:09.691 --> 00:52:10.251
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1254
00:52:10.251 --> 00:52:13.370
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard to live off the grid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1255
00:52:13.371 --> 00:52:17.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like I drive a car so I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to buy gas from Exxon or shell.</v>

1256
00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So does that make me a bad lefty?</v>

1257
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm supporting oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Company's supposed to get a prius bro.</v>

1258
00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:23.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you still put gas in a prius.</v>

1259
00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.130
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get a tesla.</v>

1260
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:30.440
<v Speaker 1>But then your wrench,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that new tesla three is a cheaper one,</v>

1261
00:52:30.441 --> 00:52:32.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's $50 something you want on it.</v>

1262
00:52:32.961 --> 00:52:33.794
<v Speaker 1>It's still going to cost more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to see pitches flexera </v>

1263
00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:37.873
<v Speaker 1>quitting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you gotta do is you got to get an </v>

1264
00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:41.750
<v Speaker 1>old car like an old civic and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebuild it.</v>

1265
00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the,</v>

1266
00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:43.980
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

1267
00:52:43.981 --> 00:52:45.980
<v Speaker 1>I least now I don't buy cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a scam.</v>

1268
00:52:45.981 --> 00:52:48.740
<v Speaker 1>I think buying cars anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1269
00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:51.290
<v Speaker 1>it is for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not if you buy classic cars.</v>

1270
00:52:51.350 --> 00:52:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's different.</v>

1271
00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:53.353
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're Jay Leno and stick your chin </v>

1272
00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:59.360
<v Speaker 1>out when you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well in his new show is fantastic.</v>

1273
00:52:59.361 --> 00:53:01.050
<v Speaker 1>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That car show is.</v>

1274
00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:01.943
<v Speaker 1>That's the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish he would've been doing all along </v>

1275
00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.580
<v Speaker 1>the exact same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding me?</v>

1276
00:53:04.581 --> 00:53:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe how much I liked it.</v>

1277
00:53:06.861 --> 00:53:08.420
<v Speaker 1>I liked him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked him on that.</v>

1278
00:53:08.421 --> 00:53:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1279
00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.100
<v Speaker 1>you know why it's because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>passionate.</v>

1280
00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.930
<v Speaker 1>I like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1281
00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:15.893
<v Speaker 1>that's really was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you would watch them </v>

1282
00:53:17.271 --> 00:53:18.104
<v Speaker 1>interview someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could tell he didn't give a fuck </v>

1283
00:53:20.631 --> 00:53:23.240
<v Speaker 1>about what the question he was asking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the Bill Hicks bit?</v>

1284
00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Hicks,</v>

1285
00:53:24.651 --> 00:53:26.680
<v Speaker 1>bit of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interviewing Kelly.</v>

1286
00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:31.650
<v Speaker 2>He got a car now you drive in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you drive and he got a girlfriend.</v>

1287
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:36.730
<v Speaker 2>He got to know bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill hugs would have A.</v>

1288
00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:40.350
<v Speaker 2>Jaylen will reach into his drawer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pull out an Uzi and stick in his mouth.</v>

1289
00:53:40.351 --> 00:53:45.351
<v Speaker 2>I used to be a fucking comic and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>blows his brains out and it forms an NBC</v>

1290
00:53:45.961 --> 00:53:49.410
<v Speaker 2>peacock in the on the wall and the wall </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind him because he's a company man to</v>

1291
00:53:49.411 --> 00:53:52.250
<v Speaker 2>the bitter end and that was the bet </v>
<v Speaker 2>reloading.</v>

1292
00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:56.910
<v Speaker 2>When does it become?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1293
00:53:56.911 --> 00:53:58.050
<v Speaker 2>that's the weirdest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1294
00:53:58.051 --> 00:54:00.390
<v Speaker 2>Jay Leno was again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my,</v>

1295
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:04.710
<v Speaker 2>one of my inspirations to become a </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian was in the early day.</v>

1296
00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would tell people that and they're</v>

1297
00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.313
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1298
00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Because they only knew him from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tonight show and I'm like,</v>

1299
00:54:09.601 --> 00:54:10.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he's doing on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

1300
00:54:10.861 --> 00:54:12.360
<v Speaker 2>but he's the funniest guy in the world.</v>

1301
00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:17.250
<v Speaker 2>It would be like if Dave Chappelle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before he did Chappelle show,</v>

1302
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:18.233
<v Speaker 2>decided to host a talk show and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely stopped anything </v>

1303
00:54:21.151 --> 00:54:25.260
<v Speaker 2>controversial and completely stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>having an opinion on anything.</v>

1304
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:28.170
<v Speaker 2>If you look at that one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jay Leno used to go on David Letterman.</v>

1305
00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:30.300
<v Speaker 2>He was the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1306
00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:33.830
<v Speaker 2>it was a guy who was edgy and super </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheap,</v>

1307
00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:38.490
<v Speaker 2>super edgy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made fun of Corporate America,</v>

1308
00:54:38.491 --> 00:54:40.770
<v Speaker 2>like nobody's business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a sharp comic.</v>

1309
00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:42.870
<v Speaker 2>He was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the best comic.</v>

1310
00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:46.500
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's why it was funny when he,</v>

1311
00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:47.423
<v Speaker 2>when he got the tonight show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't think he showed off his </v>

1312
00:54:49.021 --> 00:54:50.330
<v Speaker 2>talents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no heat,</v>

1313
00:54:50.331 --> 00:54:54.720
<v Speaker 2>but for him that was making it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was in his head and his head.</v>

1314
00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.880
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what is in our heads.</v>

1315
00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:00.270
<v Speaker 2>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did you miss?</v>

1316
00:55:00.271 --> 00:55:01.051
<v Speaker 2>Everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1317
00:55:01.051 --> 00:55:02.410
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to.</v>

1318
00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:06.180
<v Speaker 2>I was on the tonight show and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple times,</v>

1319
00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:10.870
<v Speaker 2>one time I was on and during the break I</v>
<v Speaker 2>sat there with Jay and I,</v>

1320
00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:12.920
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the first time I was on.</v>

1321
00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:13.773
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

1322
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:15.900
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was up with that Bill Hicks?</v>

1323
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:17.070
<v Speaker 2>Bit Like A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1324
00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.330
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1325
00:55:18.331 --> 00:55:19.560
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to,</v>

1326
00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:20.453
<v Speaker 2>had to ask because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the odds I want to be on the </v>

1327
00:55:23.281 --> 00:55:24.890
<v Speaker 2>show again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a mom.</v>

1328
00:55:24.891 --> 00:55:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the fear factor days,</v>

1329
00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:28.793
<v Speaker 2>which was in the early fear factor days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 100 percent convinced that show </v>

1330
00:55:31.181 --> 00:55:32.910
<v Speaker 2>was canceled at any second now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

1331
00:55:32.911 --> 00:55:35.190
<v Speaker 2>really isn't my one chance to get on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jay Leno show.</v>

1332
00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:37.340
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask them some questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's like,</v>

1333
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:38.610
<v Speaker 2>you don't yell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't like doing that.</v>

1334
00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:40.200
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1335
00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:41.220
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not bad.</v>

1336
00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:41.851
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

1337
00:55:41.851 --> 00:55:42.960
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1338
00:55:42.961 --> 00:55:44.280
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's up with that Bill Hicks thing?</v>

1339
00:55:44.281 --> 00:55:45.540
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1340
00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:47.340
<v Speaker 2>his take on it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1341
00:55:47.341 --> 00:55:49.710
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do jokes for everybody,</v>

1342
00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:51.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do comedy for everybody.</v>

1343
00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:53.970
<v Speaker 2>And Bill just didn't believe in doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy for everybody.</v>

1344
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:55.600
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

1345
00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:57.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he expected me to ask it </v>
<v Speaker 2>to them.</v>

1346
00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.073
<v Speaker 2>You're not hitting them on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was fucking fantastic because </v>

1347
00:56:01.771 --> 00:56:04.410
<v Speaker 2>after he'd retired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he told some stories about doing standup</v>

1348
00:56:04.411 --> 00:56:07.980
<v Speaker 2>for mom people and about this guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking screaming at a priest,</v>

1349
00:56:07.981 --> 00:56:09.510
<v Speaker 2>you fucking mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck up.</v>

1350
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:10.833
<v Speaker 2>And it was a hilarious thing to watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jay Leno telling hilarious stories and </v>

1351
00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:20.460
<v Speaker 2>swearing like a fucking long shoreman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1352
00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:21.720
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>

1353
00:56:21.730 --> 00:56:24.280
<v Speaker 2>You're a regular guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you've always been a regular</v>

1354
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.400
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were just doing the tonight show.</v>

1355
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:32.140
<v Speaker 1>And I heard stories about Jay that he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loved to watch hacky comedy.</v>

1356
00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.033
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why this stuck in my head</v>
<v Speaker 1>was because I used to do that too with </v>

1357
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:39.250
<v Speaker 1>todd glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would,</v>

1358
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:42.760
<v Speaker 1>we would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the was the worst,</v>

1359
00:56:42.761 --> 00:56:43.710
<v Speaker 1>the comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better.</v>

1360
00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:46.210
<v Speaker 1>We actually have three specials lined up</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a night.</v>

1361
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:47.141
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1362
00:56:47.141 --> 00:56:47.974
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we found out after I found out that </v>

1363
00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:52.443
<v Speaker 1>Jay Leno used to do the same thing when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he would see a comic that he didn't </v>

1364
00:56:54.761 --> 00:56:55.630
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1365
00:56:55.631 --> 00:56:58.660
<v Speaker 1>he thought it was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would hunt down a tape of it and then</v>

1366
00:56:58.661 --> 00:57:00.340
<v Speaker 1>everyone would have to come over to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

1367
00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.160
<v Speaker 1>And they've watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1368
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:04.150
<v Speaker 1>that's just a story I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe this is,</v>

1369
00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:05.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

1370
00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.910
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy fuck,</v>

1371
00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:09.160
<v Speaker 1>that's what I do.</v>

1372
00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just turned everything mild,</v>

1373
00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he turned everything mild for many,</v>

1374
00:57:12.851 --> 00:57:13.684
<v Speaker 1>many years and just didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just wasn't who he was or what made </v>

1375
00:57:16.541 --> 00:57:20.050
<v Speaker 1>me like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it confused me and I felt personally</v>

1376
00:57:20.051 --> 00:57:20.884
<v Speaker 1>let down by him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like he left on comedy because </v>

1377
00:57:23.201 --> 00:57:26.620
<v Speaker 1>now he was supposed to show the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>people what the new people were doing in</v>

1378
00:57:26.621 --> 00:57:31.621
<v Speaker 1>comedy and then he just kind of didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now you see him and he's like a very</v>

1379
00:57:31.871 --> 00:57:33.670
<v Speaker 1>likable person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fun.</v>

1380
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:34.900
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could show is fun.</v>

1381
00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:36.050
<v Speaker 1>That's Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1382
00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:36.963
<v Speaker 1>it's because exactly he's talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty cares about that show was not </v>

1383
00:57:40.241 --> 00:57:41.600
<v Speaker 1>made for him the tonight show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

1384
00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:43.480
<v Speaker 1>But he was the number one show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do we know?</v>

1385
00:57:43.481 --> 00:57:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was still the number one show,</v>

1386
00:57:45.041 --> 00:57:45.950
<v Speaker 1>so maybe I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1387
00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:47.200
<v Speaker 1>it was a different thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1388
00:57:47.201 --> 00:57:50.710
<v Speaker 1>because like letterman seemed </v>
<v Speaker 1>passionate,</v>

1389
00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:52.660
<v Speaker 1>like he seemed to be enjoying it.</v>

1390
00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:56.380
<v Speaker 1>And when he would say like witty things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sharp things to people,</v>

1391
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.393
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could tell he was getting a little </v>

1392
00:57:58.931 --> 00:58:02.530
<v Speaker 1>bit of a thrill out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was some excitement to Letterman's</v>

1393
00:58:02.531 --> 00:58:05.440
<v Speaker 1>position that you didn't sense with Jay </v>
<v Speaker 1>Leno.</v>

1394
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Jay Leno was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1395
00:58:06.761 --> 00:58:08.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making everybody happy.</v>

1396
00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:09.003
<v Speaker 1>So the thing I liked about late night </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows when I was younger was that there </v>

1397
00:58:13.361 --> 00:58:15.540
<v Speaker 1>was a sense of danger that anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>could happen.</v>

1398
00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.720
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know what was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1399
00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:17.623
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Burt Reynolds is going to come out </v>

1400
00:58:19.631 --> 00:58:20.860
<v Speaker 1>drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1401
00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1402
00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they used to smoke and you know,</v>

1403
00:58:24.830 --> 00:58:26.380
<v Speaker 1>there was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they would talk about things.</v>

1404
00:58:26.381 --> 00:58:27.214
<v Speaker 1>They were talk show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would actually talk about things </v>

1405
00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:30.660
<v Speaker 1>and I get to watch a Dick cabot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he would,</v>

1406
00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:32.520
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember he had a,</v>

1407
00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:36.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mort Sahl come out with Jane Fonda and</v>

1408
00:58:36.101 --> 00:58:36.934
<v Speaker 1>Peter Fonda right after the easy rider </v>
<v Speaker 1>came up and they're all talk and you're </v>

1409
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:42.190
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a fucking counterculture.</v>

1410
00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:44.770
<v Speaker 1>And it's right on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was really good.</v>

1411
00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:48.340
<v Speaker 1>That's when shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now shows her now they're all fluff.</v>

1412
00:58:48.341 --> 00:58:50.730
<v Speaker 1>It's all fucking bubble of that stuff as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1413
00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:51.573
<v Speaker 1>There was an outlet for that though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was filled by comedy in podcasts </v>

1414
00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:55.883
<v Speaker 1>just so now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Podcasts are doing that and those late </v>

1415
00:58:57.550 --> 00:58:59.350
<v Speaker 1>night shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what they're doing or why</v>

1416
00:58:59.351 --> 00:59:02.680
<v Speaker 1>they even exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're even Stephen Colbert,</v>

1417
00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Colbert show on comedy central.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a brilliant,</v>

1418
00:59:05.891 --> 00:59:06.724
<v Speaker 1>brilliant show and now he quit to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>way more money to do a more popular </v>

1419
00:59:10.301 --> 00:59:12.210
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is way less relevant.</v>

1420
00:59:12.310 --> 00:59:13.143
<v Speaker 1>Interesting or creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is funny when you fucking mocks </v>

1421
00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:18.010
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny how hard he goes.</v>

1422
00:59:18.011 --> 00:59:18.844
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he said why trump's but </v>
<v Speaker 1>did he uses his mouth is Kootenai </v>

1423
00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Putin's cock holster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that they said that on CBS,</v>

1424
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:28.041
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1425
00:59:28.041 --> 00:59:30.530
<v Speaker 1>this is what happens when you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete with the Internet.</v>

1426
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck could have imagined every </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing mccarthy smears,</v>

1427
00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:41.150
<v Speaker 1>but who the fucking thought a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a joke like that.</v>

1428
00:59:41.170 --> 00:59:46.010
<v Speaker 1>A can I get the mccarthyism thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the joke of a cock holster,</v>

1429
00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:50.630
<v Speaker 1>the president's mouth being used as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin's cock holster that,</v>

1430
00:59:50.631 --> 00:59:52.780
<v Speaker 1>that would be on CBS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

1431
00:59:52.790 --> 00:59:54.860
<v Speaker 1>You're applauding that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He broke a boundary.</v>

1432
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

1433
00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:56.623
<v Speaker 1>I'm not applauding it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying it's fascinating that </v>

1434
00:59:59.181 --> 01:00:01.550
<v Speaker 1>we've changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the bar?</v>

1435
01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:02.410
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1436
01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:04.430
<v Speaker 1>what you're allowed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you've changed.</v>

1437
01:00:04.431 --> 01:00:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Ever end because it's trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if they said that about Hillary,</v>

1438
01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:10.130
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1439
01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:10.993
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because look at all this Russia dossier </v>

1440
01:00:12.261 --> 01:00:13.460
<v Speaker 1>memos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit that's coming out.</v>

1441
01:00:13.461 --> 01:00:16.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean it turns out that a lot of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff is horseshit.</v>

1442
01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:19.870
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people who weren't around </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first mccarthy a shit,</v>

1443
01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:21.170
<v Speaker 1>they're getting to experience it now.</v>

1444
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>This is what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1445
01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.080
<v Speaker 1>this is what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

1446
01:00:24.081 --> 01:00:25.040
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the media is.</v>

1447
01:00:25.041 --> 01:00:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the media goes along.</v>

1448
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what it's like and you know,</v>

1449
01:00:29.481 --> 01:00:31.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1450
01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:34.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to spend any amount of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about it,</v>

1451
01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:35.264
<v Speaker 1>but it's so unbelievable because people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they forgot you're talking to a wall </v>

1452
01:00:38.061 --> 01:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>when you tell people just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1453
01:00:39.231 --> 01:00:41.270
<v Speaker 1>you mean there was collusion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got one.</v>

1454
01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's collusion.</v>

1455
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:43.700
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Collusion,</v>

1456
01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:44.893
<v Speaker 1>that trump colluded with the Russians </v>
<v Speaker 1>hacked into the John Podesta's emails </v>

1457
01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.970
<v Speaker 1>and somehow they need to trump to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1458
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:51.870
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1459
01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:53.510
<v Speaker 1>That's the because that's what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

1460
01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:54.373
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that there's some kind of quid pro </v>

1461
01:00:55.581 --> 01:01:00.260
<v Speaker 1>quo and that now trump has a Manchurian </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate and that he's Putin's puppet.</v>

1462
01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.273
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you noticed they're moving the </v>

1463
01:01:04.251 --> 01:01:05.330
<v Speaker 1>goalposts every day.</v>

1464
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:06.370
<v Speaker 1>So now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

1465
01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:09.080
<v Speaker 1>now he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in bed with Russian oligarchs doing</v>

1466
01:01:09.081 --> 01:01:10.160
<v Speaker 1>money laundering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1467
01:01:10.161 --> 01:01:15.161
<v Speaker 1>you don't know there's a sale of a home </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was a Russian bought it Russian.</v>

1468
01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.153
<v Speaker 1>So they've totally moved the goalposts </v>
<v Speaker 1>from being treason to now he's just </v>

1469
01:01:18.921 --> 01:01:20.480
<v Speaker 1>regular corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everybody else.</v>

1470
01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Because let me tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else has regular corrupt,</v>

1471
01:01:23.061 --> 01:01:23.894
<v Speaker 1>like trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't even know if it's regular </v>

1472
01:01:24.921 --> 01:01:27.290
<v Speaker 1>corrupt because we're talking about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sale of a house.</v>

1473
01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's quite a few years ago.</v>

1474
01:01:28.881 --> 01:01:29.714
<v Speaker 1>Well that there's more than one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're talking about lots of other </v>

1475
01:01:32.091 --> 01:01:32.720
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1476
01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.490
<v Speaker 1>And I say you want to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>collusion?</v>

1477
01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:35.353
<v Speaker 1>He opened up eight businesses in Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabia during the Goddamn campaign that </v>

1478
01:01:38.471 --> 01:01:39.304
<v Speaker 1>there's your fucking collusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody talks about that because </v>

1479
01:01:40.970 --> 01:01:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia is supposed to be on our </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

1480
01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:45.260
<v Speaker 1>even though the repressive theocracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that beheads people in the streets.</v>

1481
01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:46.900
<v Speaker 1>But we liked them because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>petrodollar,</v>

1482
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:49.510
<v Speaker 1>which no one ever talks about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>petrodollar serving.</v>

1483
01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:50.320
<v Speaker 1>It's dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1484
01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.950
<v Speaker 1>that's what props up our dollar right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1485
01:01:51.951 --> 01:01:55.040
<v Speaker 1>The economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what people don't know is that in the</v>

1486
01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:55.873
<v Speaker 1>early seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Nixon took our country off the </v>

1487
01:01:56.961 --> 01:02:00.380
<v Speaker 1>gold standard and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went on the petro dollar.</v>

1488
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:03.110
<v Speaker 1>And what was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we promised Saudi Arabia the use of</v>

1489
01:02:03.111 --> 01:02:03.944
<v Speaker 1>our military anywhere they wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as they would convert every </v>

1490
01:02:07.371 --> 01:02:11.030
<v Speaker 1>dollar of oil that someone bought for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in American dollars.</v>

1491
01:02:11.031 --> 01:02:12.610
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to buy oil from Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabia,</v>

1492
01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:14.870
<v Speaker 1>first have to convert your currency into</v>
<v Speaker 1>American dollars,</v>

1493
01:02:14.871 --> 01:02:17.870
<v Speaker 1>which is the real reason why we invaded </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq the first time.</v>

1494
01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a lot to do it.</v>

1495
01:02:19.261 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>The patent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why we're</v>

1496
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.100
<v Speaker 3>in Yemen right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're doing siege warfare in Yemen,</v>

1497
01:02:23.101 --> 01:02:25.680
<v Speaker 3>which is a war crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy just got convicted of it,</v>

1498
01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:27.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the Hague.</v>

1499
01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:30.120
<v Speaker 3>So we're doing that in conjunction with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia.</v>

1500
01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:32.430
<v Speaker 3>And why are we doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because of the petrodollar.</v>

1501
01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:35.110
<v Speaker 3>That's what's it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are we in Africa?</v>

1502
01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:37.230
<v Speaker 3>So every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything comes down to money.</v>

1503
01:02:37.231 --> 01:02:38.064
<v Speaker 3>And why are we in Syria?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to put a natural gas </v>

1504
01:02:39.721 --> 01:02:40.554
<v Speaker 3>pipeline through Syria and Russia </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't want it because they want to </v>

1505
01:02:42.721 --> 01:02:45.150
<v Speaker 3>sell the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the natural gas to Europe.</v>

1506
01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:47.190
<v Speaker 3>That's what this is about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if there's a,</v>

1507
01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.920
<v Speaker 3>and it's not about babies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not about freedom.</v>

1508
01:02:49.921 --> 01:02:52.380
<v Speaker 3>It's not about liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1509
01:02:52.830 --> 01:02:56.190
<v Speaker 3>we got it clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't like country music,</v>

1510
01:02:57.930 --> 01:02:59.490
<v Speaker 3>country music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real country music.</v>

1511
01:02:59.491 --> 01:03:00.780
<v Speaker 3>I like country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the outlaw.</v>

1512
01:03:00.781 --> 01:03:02.190
<v Speaker 3>Can Be Merle haggard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1513
01:03:02.191 --> 01:03:03.780
<v Speaker 3>I like that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like waylon jennings.</v>

1514
01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:04.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1515
01:03:04.330 --> 01:03:07.710
<v Speaker 3>I like Willie Nelson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not these fucking pussies and want to be</v>

1516
01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.080
<v Speaker 3>boy scouts and my Mama and all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1517
01:03:10.610 --> 01:03:11.600
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who Sees?</v>

1518
01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm not supposed to say pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1519
01:03:14.551 --> 01:03:16.260
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be a time where we can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>say pussy shit,</v>

1520
01:03:16.261 --> 01:03:17.370
<v Speaker 3>Piss fuck cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cock sucker.</v>

1521
01:03:17.371 --> 01:03:18.204
<v Speaker 3>Motherfucker and tits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of people are trying to use </v>

1522
01:03:20.461 --> 01:03:24.300
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag me too for a puritanical reasons</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's not what it's about.</v>

1523
01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:25.373
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag me too is about fucking stopping</v>
<v Speaker 3>men who use their power and station in </v>

1524
01:03:29.161 --> 01:03:32.850
<v Speaker 3>life to hold it over women for sexual </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual purposes.</v>

1525
01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:35.430
<v Speaker 3>That's what that's about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about being a puritan.</v>

1526
01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.353
<v Speaker 3>It's not about being anti porn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing wrong with the lusting </v>

1527
01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:42.180
<v Speaker 3>after a woman's tits and a woman's ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>

1528
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:45.150
<v Speaker 3>And there's nothing wrong with a woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanting to be fucked by a man.</v>

1529
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:48.000
<v Speaker 3>That was our normal things there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's okay.</v>

1530
01:03:48.001 --> 01:03:48.834
<v Speaker 3>And don't let people hijack that </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement and try to use it for </v>

1531
01:03:51.991 --> 01:03:54.720
<v Speaker 3>puritanism because what a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are doing shit.</v>

1532
01:03:54.721 --> 01:03:56.760
<v Speaker 3>Piss fuck on cocksucker motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Intense.</v>

1533
01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:59.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm triggered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Triggered</v>

1534
01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.060
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1535
01:04:00.061 --> 01:04:02.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1536
01:04:02.310 --> 01:04:06.720
<v Speaker 2>I think that what what we're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with is an exposure of sexual assault,</v>

1537
01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:10.200
<v Speaker 2>exposure of sexual harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual assault,</v>

1538
01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:12.390
<v Speaker 2>particularly in the workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1539
01:04:12.391 --> 01:04:13.224
<v Speaker 2>and this is a giant issue for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have to work alongside men and </v>

1540
01:04:15.661 --> 01:04:16.494
<v Speaker 2>women and they develop these little </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities inside these little boxes </v>

1541
01:04:19.321 --> 01:04:20.154
<v Speaker 2>that we call offices and things get </v>
<v Speaker 2>really fucking weird and if you have a </v>

1542
01:04:22.501 --> 01:04:24.690
<v Speaker 2>boss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a piece of shit and he's constantly</v>

1543
01:04:24.691 --> 01:04:27.270
<v Speaker 2>harassing the women that work there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a living hell with them.</v>

1544
01:04:27.271 --> 01:04:29.520
<v Speaker 2>Their stress they're going through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it is a crime.</v>

1545
01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.800
<v Speaker 2>You're doing something to those people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that work there.</v>

1546
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.470
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1547
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:34.290
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're putting this pressure on them.</v>

1548
01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.140
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking up their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine?</v>

1549
01:04:37.330 --> 01:04:38.163
<v Speaker 2>Could you eat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last thing I would ever want to do </v>

1550
01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:42.450
<v Speaker 2>was imposed myself sexually at a woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>who didn't want it.</v>

1551
01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.000
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While you're a healthy person,</v>

1552
01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:46.800
<v Speaker 2>like I mean some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just about.</v>

1553
01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.750
<v Speaker 2>We've all been into the end goal.</v>

1554
01:04:48.790 --> 01:04:50.800
<v Speaker 3>We've all been drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1555
01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:52.003
<v Speaker 3>We've all been on a date or a woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't want to have sex and we did and </v>

1556
01:04:54.861 --> 01:04:57.140
<v Speaker 3>we pushed the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1557
01:04:58.100 --> 01:04:58.933
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1558
01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.071
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1559
01:05:01.071 --> 01:05:02.490
<v Speaker 3>I just can't imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1560
01:05:02.491 --> 01:05:03.530
<v Speaker 3>I just never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just can't.</v>

1561
01:05:03.531 --> 01:05:04.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't like you.</v>

1562
01:05:04.981 --> 01:05:05.814
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make her go feel </v>

1563
01:05:06.181 --> 01:05:07.380
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1564
01:05:07.381 --> 01:05:09.540
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck do you get out of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just weird.</v>

1565
01:05:09.541 --> 01:05:09.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1566
01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:11.920
<v Speaker 2>there's people that hate the opposite </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex.</v>

1567
01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:13.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I say the opposite sex.</v>

1568
01:05:13.631 --> 01:05:16.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean just men who hate women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's women who hate men.</v>

1569
01:05:16.031 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 2>There's people who have associated</v>

1570
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:23.100
<v Speaker 4>the opposite sex with rejection and pain</v>
<v Speaker 4>and frustration all of their life.</v>

1571
01:05:23.861 --> 01:05:26.710
<v Speaker 4>You look at a guy like Harvey Weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is an ugly fat guy,</v>

1572
01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:27.843
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no women who are lusting after </v>

1573
01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:30.124
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was his power and his money that got </v>

1574
01:05:32.201 --> 01:05:33.034
<v Speaker 4>him into a position where he could get </v>
<v Speaker 4>some pussy and then having power over </v>

1575
01:05:35.801 --> 01:05:39.770
<v Speaker 4>all these actresses and then hearing </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's Uhm,</v>

1576
01:05:39.771 --> 01:05:41.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thurman or whatever,</v>

1577
01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:43.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>famous actress Salma Hayek,</v>

1578
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:48.160
<v Speaker 4>all these superstars who were fighting </v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy off and hotel rooms.</v>

1579
01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking crazy.</v>

1580
01:05:49.751 --> 01:05:50.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he is a maniac,</v>

1581
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:52.023
<v Speaker 4>but he's a disgusting guy who has no </v>
<v Speaker 4>shot at getting someone to appreciate </v>

1582
01:05:57.491 --> 01:06:00.280
<v Speaker 4>him physically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might like his personality,</v>

1583
01:06:00.281 --> 01:06:03.220
<v Speaker 4>but for someone to be physically </v>
<v Speaker 4>attracted to him is almost impossible.</v>

1584
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:04.691
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1585
01:06:04.691 --> 01:06:07.090
<v Speaker 4>he's eating himself into this disgusting</v>
<v Speaker 4>shape.</v>

1586
01:06:07.091 --> 01:06:08.690
<v Speaker 4>Unless you have a fetish or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1587
01:06:08.691 --> 01:06:11.260
<v Speaker 4>You might just into getting fucked by </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jabba the hut.</v>

1588
01:06:11.261 --> 01:06:15.880
<v Speaker 4>Just big fat guy with pockmarked skin </v>
<v Speaker 4>shooting loads all over you.</v>

1589
01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:17.290
<v Speaker 4>There's no way it makes any sense,</v>

1590
01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.200
<v Speaker 3>but if he was going to put you in </v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean's 11,</v>

1591
01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:20.730
<v Speaker 3>you got to do what you gotta do.</v>

1592
01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:25.331
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1593
01:06:25.331 --> 01:06:26.750
<v Speaker 4>Matt Damon said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1594
01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:29.350
<v Speaker 4>What did Matt Damon's say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were trying to get them out of that</v>

1595
01:06:29.351 --> 01:06:30.400
<v Speaker 4>new oceans movie.</v>

1596
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:31.011
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't.</v>

1597
01:06:31.011 --> 01:06:31.844
<v Speaker 3>He say something about there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>continuum or something that that </v>

1598
01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.080
<v Speaker 3>everything is Harvey Weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't that it?</v>

1599
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:41.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember the exact quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was something along the lines of,</v>

1600
01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:42.593
<v Speaker 4>we have to make a differentiation </v>
<v Speaker 4>between sexual assault and men hitting </v>

1601
01:06:47.551 --> 01:06:48.384
<v Speaker 4>on women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's really interesting is seeing how </v>

1602
01:06:49.981 --> 01:06:52.980
<v Speaker 4>they're acting about this in France,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Europe,</v>

1603
01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:54.690
<v Speaker 4>a lot of women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially older actions.</v>

1604
01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:56.950
<v Speaker 4>Did you see?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that's wild.</v>

1605
01:06:57.050 --> 01:07:02.050
<v Speaker 4>They want men to be men and and France.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if they're just France part on a,</v>

1606
01:07:02.761 --> 01:07:04.250
<v Speaker 4>they're just different over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

1607
01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:05.670
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a different attitude.</v>

1608
01:07:05.671 --> 01:07:06.504
<v Speaker 4>The same as Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My friend Tiago from Brazil told me </v>

1609
01:07:09.511 --> 01:07:10.390
<v Speaker 4>once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

1610
01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:11.310
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

1611
01:07:11.311 --> 01:07:12.780
<v Speaker 4>if you're in Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he goes,</v>

1612
01:07:12.781 --> 01:07:14.190
<v Speaker 4>if you're with a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't try to fuck her.</v>

1613
01:07:14.191 --> 01:07:16.020
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is wrong with you?</v>

1614
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:18.210
<v Speaker 4>Like you're not even trying to fuck me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1615
01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.160
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is wrong with these?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll get mad at you.</v>

1616
01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:24.330
<v Speaker 4>Like they appreciate like in Brazil is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>very aggressive.</v>

1617
01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:26.430
<v Speaker 4>I have sexually aggressive place.</v>

1618
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:28.290
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have had a.</v>

1619
01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:31.470
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was working at a comedy club and there</v>

1620
01:07:31.471 --> 01:07:34.510
<v Speaker 3>was a girl there who was beautiful and </v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1621
01:07:34.570 --> 01:07:38.610
<v Speaker 3>she flirted with me and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I,</v>

1622
01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:40.710
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know if she was flirting with </v>
<v Speaker 3>me because I was just,</v>

1623
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:42.330
<v Speaker 3>she was just beautiful and she talked to</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

1624
01:07:42.331 --> 01:07:43.860
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh right,</v>

1625
01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.510
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wasn't going to make a move at her</v>

1626
01:07:45.511 --> 01:07:47.520
<v Speaker 3>because I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm considering every comedian who comes</v>

1627
01:07:47.521 --> 01:07:48.930
<v Speaker 3>into this club makes a move on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>girl.</v>

1628
01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.800
<v Speaker 3>She's the prettiest girl around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1629
01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:53.280
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't do anything because I want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be that guy.</v>

1630
01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:56.400
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I'll never forget by the end of</v>

1631
01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.440
<v Speaker 3>the week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the last night and she's like,</v>

1632
01:07:58.441 --> 01:08:00.090
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a party at my house tonight,</v>

1633
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:01.650
<v Speaker 3>are you going to come?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1634
01:08:01.651 --> 01:08:02.540
<v Speaker 3>oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1635
01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:07.440
<v Speaker 3>So I went to their whatever cut to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm leaving and she goes,</v>

1636
01:08:07.441 --> 01:08:09.270
<v Speaker 3>are you fucking kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

1637
01:08:09.271 --> 01:08:09.751
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

1638
01:08:09.751 --> 01:08:12.450
<v Speaker 3>I threw a party just to get you to my </v>
<v Speaker 3>apartment and you're going to leave.</v>

1639
01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:13.590
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

1640
01:08:13.591 --> 01:08:15.030
<v Speaker 3>You want to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we had</v>

1641
01:08:17.250 --> 01:08:18.670
<v Speaker 1>damn should've beat you over the head </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

1642
01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:19.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1643
01:08:19.810 --> 01:08:20.643
<v Speaker 1>so there was a woman who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't want to be the guy that </v>

1644
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.910
<v Speaker 1>was super aggressive against a girl that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

1645
01:08:25.911 --> 01:08:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like you,</v>

1646
01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:28.103
<v Speaker 1>you just fun guy to hang out with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does everything have to be sex and I </v>

1647
01:08:30.531 --> 01:08:32.260
<v Speaker 1>know every guy in the world hit on her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1648
01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:33.500
<v Speaker 1>you know what I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1649
01:08:33.501 --> 01:08:35.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say this because w,</v>
<v Speaker 1>w,</v>

1650
01:08:36.230 --> 01:08:37.063
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like in this day and age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to get to know someone forever </v>

1651
01:08:39.501 --> 01:08:41.540
<v Speaker 1>before you fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally forever.</v>

1652
01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:43.850
<v Speaker 1>You're got to fuck my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first night we went up.</v>

1653
01:08:43.851 --> 01:08:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>

1654
01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.850
<v Speaker 1>And she wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1655
01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.100
<v Speaker 1>which has probably worked out because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're still together and uh,</v>

1656
01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:52.100
<v Speaker 1>but I kept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it in a charming way.</v>

1657
01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:53.083
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1658
01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:55.611
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honey,</v>

1659
01:08:55.611 --> 01:08:55.930
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1660
01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we ask you this?</v>

1661
01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Why did you try to fuck her on the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>night?</v>

1662
01:08:58.821 --> 01:08:59.654
<v Speaker 1>But it took you five nights for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>waitress because I didn't want to be </v>

1663
01:09:02.211 --> 01:09:05.330
<v Speaker 1>that guy at the club because that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense because it's a work environment.</v>

1664
01:09:05.331 --> 01:09:06.164
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're the opposite of a sexual </v>

1665
01:09:07.131 --> 01:09:08.030
<v Speaker 1>harasser?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1666
01:09:08.031 --> 01:09:09.890
<v Speaker 1>So I guess now that I look at it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1667
01:09:09.930 --> 01:09:10.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1668
01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Not that I did not have sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that you weren't attracted to her,</v>

1669
01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:15.350
<v Speaker 1>you just didn't want to be a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1670
01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:16.184
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to have that reputation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy and plus there's plenty of </v>

1671
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:19.640
<v Speaker 1>women in the audience.</v>

1672
01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:23.060
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1673
01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:24.313
<v Speaker 1>So what I would tell her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first night we were </v>

1674
01:09:26.211 --> 01:09:27.021
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1675
01:09:27.021 --> 01:09:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you.</v>

1676
01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.190
<v Speaker 1>I know you're going to say you want me </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go home,</v>

1677
01:09:31.191 --> 01:09:32.024
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to worry that I'm too </v>
<v Speaker 1>tired to drive and I might get in an </v>

1678
01:09:33.681 --> 01:09:35.780
<v Speaker 1>accident so you don't have to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just stay.</v>

1679
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:38.240
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

1680
01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:38.721
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>

1681
01:09:38.721 --> 01:09:39.554
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nice of you to say that you're </v>

1682
01:09:40.341 --> 01:09:41.750
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're brave,</v>

1683
01:09:42.090 --> 01:09:44.090
<v Speaker 1>and I know you're gonna worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just staying.</v>

1684
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Then I think I did end up staying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't have sex.</v>

1685
01:09:48.090 --> 01:09:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like probably two more times,</v>

1686
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:53.720
<v Speaker 1>two more times like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also it's,</v>

1687
01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:57.980
<v Speaker 1>you don't really know someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality for a long time.</v>

1688
01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:58.993
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is people have physical </v>

1689
01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:01.730
<v Speaker 1>needs and they get attracted to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

1690
01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:02.563
<v Speaker 1>And then next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1691
01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:05.270
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been many times in my life where</v>

1692
01:10:05.271 --> 01:10:06.104
<v Speaker 1>I wound up having sex with somebody who </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned out to be crazy and then you </v>

1693
01:10:08.721 --> 01:10:09.410
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're one,</v>

1694
01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:10.970
<v Speaker 1>two dates in and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1695
01:10:10.971 --> 01:10:11.804
<v Speaker 1>she seems cool and next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hanging out in a week or two </v>

1696
01:10:13.851 --> 01:10:16.070
<v Speaker 1>later and she does something completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking insane.</v>

1697
01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:19.340
<v Speaker 1>And then the crazy just starts leaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of her pores and you're like,</v>

1698
01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:20.203
<v Speaker 1>oh well now what have I done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been tangled myself with some </v>

1699
01:10:23.931 --> 01:10:24.764
<v Speaker 1>person who knows where I live and </v>
<v Speaker 1>expects me to call them every day and </v>

1700
01:10:27.951 --> 01:10:30.860
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get together and I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out a way to back out of this.</v>

1701
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:34.010
<v Speaker 1>And then he tried to back out of it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get fucking angry at you.</v>

1702
01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:37.370
<v Speaker 1>And this is back in the old days when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people would actually call you up,</v>

1703
01:10:37.371 --> 01:10:38.300
<v Speaker 1>call you to.</v>

1704
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:39.463
<v Speaker 1>There was no text messaging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just pick up the phone if </v>

1705
01:10:41.311 --> 01:10:42.144
<v Speaker 1>someone started yelling at you or I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would just duck them for awhile until </v>

1706
01:10:44.481 --> 01:10:45.314
<v Speaker 1>they found some new guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember when people used to answer </v>

1707
01:10:46.731 --> 01:10:49.570
<v Speaker 1>their phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't ever answer my.</v>

1708
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:50.423
<v Speaker 1>No one ever answers their phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I get too many phone calls from </v>

1709
01:10:52.491 --> 01:10:53.420
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1710
01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.430
<v Speaker 1>I just get phone calls from numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1711
01:10:55.431 --> 01:10:56.264
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's this going to get my fucking </v>

1712
01:10:56.631 --> 01:10:57.800
<v Speaker 1>number from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

1713
01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.750
<v Speaker 1>I just look at it and my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever have.</v>

1714
01:10:59.751 --> 01:11:03.240
<v Speaker 1>I answered a call because I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>because uh,</v>

1715
01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:03.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1716
01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:04.970
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's that business.</v>

1717
01:11:04.971 --> 01:11:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I just called her con.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

1718
01:11:06.261 --> 01:11:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1719
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.870
<v Speaker 1>So I took one one time and it was just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>

1720
01:11:08.871 --> 01:11:09.704
<v Speaker 1>It didn't come up and it was someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking me for money to borrow the money </v>

1721
01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:14.320
<v Speaker 1>was just a person,</v>

1722
01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:17.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew tangentially in comedy and,</v>

1723
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:20.040
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't say this and I was like,</v>

1724
01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:21.593
<v Speaker 3>do you know that your name is not even </v>
<v Speaker 3>in my fucking phone book and you're </v>

1725
01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:26.640
<v Speaker 3>asking for any money from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a desperate move.</v>

1726
01:11:26.641 --> 01:11:28.800
<v Speaker 3>That must be a person who's like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gambling addict or something.</v>

1727
01:11:28.801 --> 01:11:31.920
<v Speaker 3>That's what I thought right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But getting back to this thing about the</v>

1728
01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:32.521
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1729
01:11:32.521 --> 01:11:35.250
<v Speaker 3>one time I had a woman when I first </v>
<v Speaker 3>moved to La,</v>

1730
01:11:35.251 --> 01:11:36.550
<v Speaker 3>I was dating or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1731
01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:38.093
<v Speaker 3>I went to her house and she was really </v>
<v Speaker 3>creative and she's cute and she wrote </v>

1732
01:11:41.701 --> 01:11:44.130
<v Speaker 3>songs and she would sing them for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that shit.</v>

1733
01:11:44.690 --> 01:11:46.020
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember she,</v>

1734
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:46.943
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were going to go have sex and she </v>

1735
01:11:47.281 --> 01:11:48.870
<v Speaker 3>went and she was hanging on and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>went,</v>

1736
01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:51.540
<v Speaker 3>took a drink and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1737
01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:52.321
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want to drink?</v>

1738
01:11:52.321 --> 01:11:52.711
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1739
01:11:52.711 --> 01:11:53.401
<v Speaker 3>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1740
01:11:53.401 --> 01:11:54.720
<v Speaker 3>hell on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's like drinking.</v>

1741
01:11:54.721 --> 01:11:55.610
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

1742
01:11:55.650 --> 01:11:57.270
<v Speaker 3>Because I have to have a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>drinks before.</v>

1743
01:11:58.050 --> 01:11:59.490
<v Speaker 3>And then it made me not want to have sex</v>
<v Speaker 3>with her.</v>

1744
01:11:59.491 --> 01:12:01.380
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that fucked up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1745
01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.280
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have,</v>

1746
01:12:02.490 --> 01:12:04.260
<v Speaker 3>you have to drink so you can feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>comfortable.</v>

1747
01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:06.510
<v Speaker 3>I took it personal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which of course it was just her,</v>

1748
01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:07.373
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she needed to relax because she had </v>

1749
01:12:08.401 --> 01:12:09.690
<v Speaker 3>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had it or not.</v>

1750
01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.340
<v Speaker 3>She had issues or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1751
01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:12.750
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1752
01:12:13.210 --> 01:12:14.400
<v Speaker 3>that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1753
01:12:14.401 --> 01:12:16.240
<v Speaker 3>I can't be with the girl has to drink </v>
<v Speaker 3>that accessible,</v>

1754
01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:17.090
<v Speaker 3>isn't it</v>

1755
01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:19.250
<v Speaker 4>to the window.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially when you're young and single.</v>

1756
01:12:19.251 --> 01:12:20.084
<v Speaker 4>It's like you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to get stuck in a bad </v>

1757
01:12:21.651 --> 01:12:22.820
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1758
01:12:22.821 --> 01:12:25.130
<v Speaker 4>like I'd seen a lot of bad situations </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was young,</v>

1759
01:12:25.131 --> 01:12:27.140
<v Speaker 4>my own parents and other people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>parents.</v>

1760
01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:30.920
<v Speaker 4>So I'd see anything fucking sketchy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>like where this is gone,</v>

1761
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:32.960
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to deal with your problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1762
01:12:33.230 --> 01:12:34.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't have those kinds of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1763
01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:35.773
<v Speaker 4>See Ya.</v>

1764
01:12:36.230 --> 01:12:37.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was the same way.</v>

1765
01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:40.730
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a lot of bad examples of people.</v>

1766
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:43.970
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea why these people would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the spouse there with like,</v>

1767
01:12:43.971 --> 01:12:44.804
<v Speaker 3>why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe that's going to happen to me </v>

1768
01:12:46.221 --> 01:12:49.790
<v Speaker 3>because it's unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I started reading self help books and</v>

1769
01:12:49.791 --> 01:12:50.624
<v Speaker 3>watching John Bradshaw videos that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know if he knew that his John </v>

1770
01:12:53.090 --> 01:12:53.923
<v Speaker 3>Bradshaw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he invented that term inner child and </v>

1771
01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:57.260
<v Speaker 3>all the inner child work and all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1772
01:12:57.261 --> 01:12:59.510
<v Speaker 3>So I got fucked up</v>

1773
01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:03.040
<v Speaker 4>people's ads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting your child pitch,</v>

1774
01:13:03.041 --> 01:13:03.874
<v Speaker 4>you're 40.</v>

1775
01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:07.040
<v Speaker 3>But he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was helpful to me because he broke up</v>

1776
01:13:07.041 --> 01:13:07.874
<v Speaker 3>the family dynamic and he talked about </v>
<v Speaker 3>how people act in fact come from a big </v>

1777
01:13:10.911 --> 01:13:12.860
<v Speaker 3>family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 kids and that,</v>

1778
01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:14.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it's like,</v>

1779
01:13:14.631 --> 01:13:17.450
<v Speaker 3>it all balances out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll have a bad kid and as an angel,</v>

1780
01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:18.613
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the and everything in between </v>

1781
01:13:19.371 --> 01:13:22.970
<v Speaker 3>and he talked to him and so it helped me</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand myself a lot.</v>

1782
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:25.030
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're.</v>

1783
01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:29.030
<v Speaker 3>So I wanted to understand my motivations</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I didn't make bad choices in my life.</v>

1784
01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:32.840
<v Speaker 3>Like I had seen people around me making.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because it's unconscious,</v>

1785
01:13:32.841 --> 01:13:34.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you just do what's habit,</v>

1786
01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:35.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

1787
01:13:35.150 --> 01:13:38.390
<v Speaker 3>you don't even know why you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing half the time.</v>

1788
01:13:38.730 --> 01:13:39.563
<v Speaker 3>You're not conscious of why you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>acting the way you're acting or why you </v>

1789
01:13:41.511 --> 01:13:42.860
<v Speaker 3>like what you like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just go.</v>

1790
01:13:42.861 --> 01:13:43.850
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why</v>

1791
01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:47.730
<v Speaker 4>when I was struggling as a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one thing that I definitely did is I,</v>

1792
01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:48.593
<v Speaker 4>I only gave this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I only gave a certain amount of room to </v>

1793
01:13:50.911 --> 01:13:54.840
<v Speaker 4>relationships because I knew that I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>really had to concentrate on my career.</v>

1794
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:55.800
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1795
01:13:55.801 --> 01:13:57.150
<v Speaker 4>if I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will.</v>

1796
01:13:57.151 --> 01:13:59.880
<v Speaker 4>It will fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a kid that I started out with,</v>

1797
01:13:59.881 --> 01:14:00.714
<v Speaker 4>we both started out together and it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty funny guy and he got this </v>

1798
01:14:03.301 --> 01:14:04.134
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend that was just very demanding </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he stopped doing stand up less and </v>

1799
01:14:07.081 --> 01:14:08.190
<v Speaker 4>less.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>

1800
01:14:08.250 --> 01:14:11.680
<v Speaker 4>It was doing less and less sets and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually he dropped out and then I ran</v>

1801
01:14:11.681 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 4>into his</v>

1802
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.410
<v Speaker 2>son many years later and his son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the,</v>

1803
01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:16.253
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wound up having a baby and his son </v>

1804
01:14:17.621 --> 01:14:21.190
<v Speaker 2>was saying that his dad just really </v>
<v Speaker 2>regretted not getting into comedy.</v>

1805
01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:23.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a nice sun and all that stuff and</v>

1806
01:14:23.441 --> 01:14:26.300
<v Speaker 2>he had a family but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tanked him.</v>

1807
01:14:26.730 --> 01:14:27.563
<v Speaker 2>There's a saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it might've been Carl young who </v>

1808
01:14:30.281 --> 01:14:31.114
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing affects a child more than the </v>

1809
01:14:32.861 --> 01:14:37.600
<v Speaker 2>unlived life of its parent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine.</v>

1810
01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:38.493
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine being a father and you went </v>

1811
01:14:40.811 --> 01:14:42.790
<v Speaker 2>after your dream and you gave it </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything you can.</v>

1812
01:14:42.791 --> 01:14:45.610
<v Speaker 2>Now you can impart that to your kid and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your kid just absorbs it.</v>

1813
01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Being around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you didn't do that.</v>

1814
01:14:48.041 --> 01:14:48.874
<v Speaker 2>You have all that on resentment or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you feel because you didn't </v>

1815
01:14:53.051 --> 01:14:53.884
<v Speaker 2>live what your life here supposed to and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can pass that off and your kid </v>

1816
01:14:56.890 --> 01:14:57.723
<v Speaker 2>absorbs that.</v>

1817
01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:58.623
<v Speaker 2>I knew it was so hard to do anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was going to be so hard to make it </v>

1818
01:15:01.481 --> 01:15:03.010
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The odds are stacked against you.</v>

1819
01:15:03.011 --> 01:15:05.320
<v Speaker 2>You've seen everybody else drop off like</v>
<v Speaker 2>flies.</v>

1820
01:15:05.321 --> 01:15:07.450
<v Speaker 2>You see guys can't get gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wind up quitting.</v>

1821
01:15:07.451 --> 01:15:09.520
<v Speaker 2>They get a day job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they work less and less,</v>

1822
01:15:09.521 --> 01:15:10.354
<v Speaker 2>and the next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just completely stopped doing </v>

1823
01:15:11.171 --> 01:15:12.004
<v Speaker 2>standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so common and so when I would see </v>

1824
01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:16.173
<v Speaker 2>relationships and see those signs where </v>
<v Speaker 2>girls are just demanding more and more </v>

1825
01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:20.080
<v Speaker 2>of my time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you have to go up tonight?</v>

1826
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:23.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a four or five nights a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have two kids.</v>

1827
01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1828
01:15:24.521 --> 01:15:26.770
<v Speaker 2>you can come with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen your act 100 times.</v>

1829
01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:29.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I do,</v>

1830
01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:31.180
<v Speaker 2>this is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know I can't.</v>

1831
01:15:31.181 --> 01:15:33.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I meet guys who they their,</v>

1832
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:34.863
<v Speaker 2>their spouses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their significant others aren't into </v>

1833
01:15:36.881 --> 01:15:39.490
<v Speaker 2>their comedy and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's awful.</v>

1834
01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.770
<v Speaker 2>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing that sap.</v>

1835
01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:43.210
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1836
01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:46.420
<v Speaker 2>what do you like about me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife is,</v>

1837
01:15:46.930 --> 01:15:50.590
<v Speaker 2>I would say she's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a fan of comedy,</v>

1838
01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:54.490
<v Speaker 2>but she's been around me for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she is,</v>

1839
01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:55.503
<v Speaker 2>she's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if she wants to stand up and it's </v>

1840
01:15:57.701 --> 01:15:58.990
<v Speaker 2>not good to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sucks.</v>

1841
01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:00.190
<v Speaker 2>Well that there's nothing wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1842
01:16:00.191 --> 01:16:01.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>

1843
01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:02.460
<v Speaker 2>It's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1844
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:04.990
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's got an eye for it,</v>

1845
01:16:04.991 --> 01:16:05.824
<v Speaker 2>she understands it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I have friends whose wives hate </v>

1846
01:16:09.791 --> 01:16:12.350
<v Speaker 2>comedy and they do stand up and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>quick,</v>

1847
01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:13.193
<v Speaker 2>it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they associate comedy with like </v>

1848
01:16:16.090 --> 01:16:19.510
<v Speaker 2>taking their boyfriend away or taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>their husband away.</v>

1849
01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:22.870
<v Speaker 2>Like this is that thing that takes away </v>
<v Speaker 2>my time,</v>

1850
01:16:23.050 --> 01:16:25.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from me with him.</v>

1851
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Now he's off doing these joke things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking bullshit.</v>

1852
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:30.340
<v Speaker 2>So it's super selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need this,</v>

1853
01:16:30.341 --> 01:16:31.600
<v Speaker 2>you need a better woman.</v>

1854
01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:33.970
<v Speaker 2>Someone who's deeper yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1855
01:16:33.971 --> 01:16:37.770
<v Speaker 2>you just fucking settle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just settle.</v>

1856
01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:40.530
<v Speaker 2>They settle my what my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1857
01:16:40.531 --> 01:16:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many.</v>

1858
01:16:41.490 --> 01:16:44.630
<v Speaker 2>I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget where out of show sometimes and</v>

1859
01:16:47.290 --> 01:16:49.180
<v Speaker 2>he'll probably hear this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1860
01:16:49.181 --> 01:16:51.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I started comedy,</v>

1861
01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:52.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was dating this girl,</v>

1862
01:16:52.811 --> 01:16:55.360
<v Speaker 2>sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweet girl and she wanted to get married</v>

1863
01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.340
<v Speaker 2>like you would expect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1864
01:16:57.341 --> 01:16:58.174
<v Speaker 2>So I was 24 at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was six years to get out of college </v>

1865
01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:04.810
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she bought me a suit so I could go on</v>

1866
01:17:04.811 --> 01:17:05.644
<v Speaker 2>interviews to get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wanted me to get a job and I had </v>

1867
01:17:09.501 --> 01:17:10.340
<v Speaker 2>started doing comedy</v>

1868
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:11.173
<v Speaker 3>that the right then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so about six months into doing </v>

1869
01:17:14.331 --> 01:17:15.164
<v Speaker 3>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started getting Saturday night spots </v>

1870
01:17:16.071 --> 01:17:19.010
<v Speaker 3>at a real club.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would let me go do 10 minutes,</v>

1871
01:17:19.011 --> 01:17:19.844
<v Speaker 3>not paid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I could do it on the regular show </v>

1872
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:22.330
<v Speaker 3>guests set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's huge.</v>

1873
01:17:22.331 --> 01:17:24.380
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1874
01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:25.910
<v Speaker 3>are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a godsend.</v>

1875
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:28.790
<v Speaker 3>So we go out loud part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1876
01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:30.890
<v Speaker 3>So on a Saturday night I take her with </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

1877
01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:31.753
<v Speaker 3>we're going to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was called the comedy cottage and I </v>

1878
01:17:35.031 --> 01:17:37.910
<v Speaker 3>do my set and there was lots of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1879
01:17:37.911 --> 01:17:38.744
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new new comics like me and they were </v>

1880
01:17:40.451 --> 01:17:41.530
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh Jimmy,</v>

1881
01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:42.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was great.</v>

1882
01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.230
<v Speaker 3>That was a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big deal for us.</v>

1883
01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:48.020
<v Speaker 3>One of our own got on and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in the car ride home,</v>

1884
01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:51.830
<v Speaker 3>she's not saying anything and finally </v>
<v Speaker 3>she just turns to me and she goes,</v>

1885
01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:53.720
<v Speaker 3>you're really gonna do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't you?</v>

1886
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:55.970
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

1887
01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:58.310
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you just see what happened?</v>

1888
01:17:58.430 --> 01:18:00.770
<v Speaker 3>Of course I'm doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

1889
01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:01.663
<v Speaker 3>That she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she knew that I was going to be a </v>

1890
01:18:03.081 --> 01:18:05.900
<v Speaker 3>comedian and not married to her and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what that meant.</v>

1891
01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.940
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't be both.</v>

1892
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:12.440
<v Speaker 3>Not then I couldn't get married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if I couldn't get married.</v>

1893
01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:13.740
<v Speaker 3>Jim Brewer is married.</v>

1894
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:15.920
<v Speaker 4>The same girl he's with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I met him,</v>

1895
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:21.550
<v Speaker 4>I met Jim in 1991 and two happy kids the</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole deal.</v>

1896
01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:24.470
<v Speaker 4>Super happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's super nice.</v>

1897
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:25.383
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the problem with standup comedy is </v>

1898
01:18:26.561 --> 01:18:28.420
<v Speaker 3>you don't know where you're gonna end up</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

1899
01:18:28.570 --> 01:18:29.890
<v Speaker 3>So when you start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know,</v>

1900
01:18:29.891 --> 01:18:31.480
<v Speaker 3>can I even do five minutes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we're like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Can I get on TV?</v>

01:18:39.101 --> 01:18:40.660
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>

1906
01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.310
<v Speaker 3>You don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go to any other job,</v>

1907
01:18:42.311 --> 01:18:42.761
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1908
01:18:42.761 --> 01:18:44.140

<v Speaker 3>this and this,</v>

1909
01:18:44.141 --> 01:18:45.770
<v Speaker 3>then you'll get the promotion and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>get that.</v>

1910
01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:47.470
<v Speaker 3>You have to meet your number and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get,</v>

1911
01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:47.831
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>This.</v>

1913
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:50.970
<v Speaker 3>There's no handbook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1914
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:51.240

<v Speaker 4>like my.</v>

1916
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:53.223
<v Speaker 4>My agent called me to schedule something</v>
<v Speaker 4>in New York for November and I said I </v>

1917
01:18:58.081 --> 01:18:59.640
<v Speaker 4>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I said,</v>

01:18:59.641 --> 01:19:00.474
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing my special in April.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I'm going to have an </v>

1919
01:19:02.371 --> 01:19:04.920
<v Speaker 4>hour by November.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I assume I will,</v>

1920
01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.720
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

1921
01:19:06.721 --> 01:19:07.200
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>

1922
01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:11.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to fuck people over at </v>
<v Speaker 4>some big fucking theater and not have an</v>

1923
01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:12.493
<v Speaker 4>hour yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna.</v>

1924
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:13.860
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do my best,</v>

1925
01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:15.810
<v Speaker 4>but may June,</v>
<v Speaker 4>July,</v>

1926
01:19:15.811 --> 01:19:17.160
<v Speaker 4>August,</v>
<v Speaker 4>September,</v>

1927
01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:17.521
<v Speaker 4>October,</v>
<v Speaker 4>November,</v>

1928
01:19:17.521 --> 01:19:18.354
<v Speaker 4>seven months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most likely I'll have a new our most </v>

1929
01:19:20.401 --> 01:19:22.470
<v Speaker 4>likely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what if I only have a half hour?</v>

1930
01:19:23.370 --> 01:19:25.860
<v Speaker 4>What if I only have an half an hour </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking bomb?</v>

1931
01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:29.730
<v Speaker 4>What if I do half an hour of good comedy</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not the best?</v>

1932
01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:33.030
<v Speaker 4>And then have nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't take that risk.</v>

1933
01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:37.680
<v Speaker 4>Like when I'm ready I'll call yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when April rolls around,</v>

1934
01:19:37.681 --> 01:19:40.020
<v Speaker 4>after I'm done and I chuck everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>aside,</v>

1935
01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:44.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm on a fucking rampage for like three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four months of just doing 10,</v>

1936
01:19:44.311 --> 01:19:45.144
<v Speaker 4>15 minutes spots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>writing a bunch of new shit and trying </v>

1937
01:19:47.671 --> 01:19:48.504
<v Speaker 4>to piece together an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it's going to take me a month or </v>

1938
01:19:50.641 --> 01:19:51.474
<v Speaker 4>two to try to sort that our out to </v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out where everything goes and </v>

1939
01:19:54.511 --> 01:19:56.850
<v Speaker 4>what the punchlines are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listening to recordings,</v>

1940
01:19:56.851 --> 01:20:00.000
<v Speaker 4>writing things down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>burning the midnight oil late at night.</v>

1941
01:20:00.330 --> 01:20:01.710
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I could do it.</v>

1942
01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:04.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm assuming you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but once I chucked my act,</v>

1943
01:20:04.751 --> 01:20:07.560
<v Speaker 4>decide once the act that you saw that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you thought was funny,</v>

1944
01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:08.160
<v Speaker 4>that fucking</v>

1945
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.110
<v Speaker 1>things going to the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

1946
01:20:10.410 --> 01:20:11.243
<v Speaker 1>So over baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm lucky in the sense that no one saw </v>

1947
01:20:14.251 --> 01:20:15.084
<v Speaker 1>my last special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think to do those jokes I get to </v>

1948
01:20:16.681 --> 01:20:19.230
<v Speaker 1>keep doing those job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about your fans know?</v>

<v Speaker 1>So I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is funny,</v>

1950
01:20:20.521 --> 01:20:22.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I did a to comedy central specials.</v>

1951
01:20:22.561 --> 01:20:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Then I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my last one was for Hulu and it was in I</v>

1952
01:20:25.381 --> 01:20:29.040
<v Speaker 1>think 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 maybe or 1415 and uh,</v>

1953
01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:30.180
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1954
01:20:30.450 --> 01:20:31.283
<v Speaker 1>so because of my youtube show I'd sell </v>
<v Speaker 1>tickets now so people come out and so I </v>

1955
01:20:34.861 --> 01:20:35.694
<v Speaker 1>got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing a show maybe six months ago </v>

1956
01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:43.220
<v Speaker 1>and I do the opening joke from my </v>
<v Speaker 1>special and it kills and I go,</v>

1957
01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:46.400
<v Speaker 1>you motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of you saw my special.</v>

1958
01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.590
<v Speaker 1>And then I was upset for a second and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I was like,</v>

1959
01:20:52.650 --> 01:20:54.240
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get to do those jokes again.</v>

1960
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:56.143
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do my own special and put </v>
<v Speaker 1>it out on my own thing because I don't </v>

1961
01:20:59.341 --> 01:21:01.220
<v Speaker 1>know where that even like that Hulu </v>
<v Speaker 1>special.</v>

1962

<v Speaker 1>it lives on Hulu somewhere.</v>

1963
01:21:03.210 --> 01:21:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Is Hulu is still a thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still a thing.</v>

1964
01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:06.300

<v Speaker 1>Hulu was still a thing.</v>

1965
01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.430

<v Speaker 1>NBC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>NBC.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1980
01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:33.743

<v Speaker 1>I was thinking that Qualif Tompkins bit </v>

1981
01:21:35.731 --> 01:21:37.560
<v Speaker 1>about crackle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crackle.</v>

1982
01:21:37.561 --> 01:21:39.870
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember how it went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only if they're called crack crack.</v>

1983
01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.870
<v Speaker 1>We cute and so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't remember how it.</v>

1984
01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:45.990
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1985
01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:48.910
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's now.</v>

1986
01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Then I got to tell Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was happier before.</v>

1987
01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:52.433
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was happier when my whole life was </v>

1988
01:21:54.241 --> 01:21:55.074
<v Speaker 1>ahead of me and like when I first </v>
<v Speaker 1>started hanging out a largo and doing </v>

1989
01:21:57.331 --> 01:22:01.320
<v Speaker 1>sets at the Improv and being in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting all my heroes in comedy,</v>

1990
01:22:01.710 --> 01:22:02.543
<v Speaker 1>like to me that was a headier time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's like I feel pressure to stay </v>

1991
01:22:08.131 --> 01:22:10.300
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay where I'm at or be successful.</v>

1992
01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:13.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like I'm working too hard and</v>

1993
01:22:13.981 --> 01:22:17.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm not able to enjoy what I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplished and that's why I've been,</v>

1994
01:22:17.581 --> 01:22:18.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to,</v>

1995
01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.200
<v Speaker 1>like I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he showed me that,</v>

1996
01:22:20.230 --> 01:22:20.820
<v Speaker 1>that tank.</v>

1997
01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:22.680
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop my thoughts.</v>

1998
01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:24.210
<v Speaker 1>You can come into a tank anytime you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

1999
01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.141
<v Speaker 1>Don't sit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2000
01:22:25.141 --> 01:22:27.930
<v Speaker 1>don't come into the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you could because people do do that.</v>

2001
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:32.660
<v Speaker 1>There's a tank center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a place,</v>

2002
01:22:32.810 --> 01:22:35.340
<v Speaker 1>a find out the name of that place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give them a shout out.</v>

2003
01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:39.570
<v Speaker 1>So the float lab in Venice is my spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the spot that built my tank.</v>

2004
01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:40.643
<v Speaker 1>They have a place in Westwood and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the best in the world and they </v>

2005
01:22:42.631 --> 01:22:45.300
<v Speaker 1>actually supply the tanks to the place </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Pasadena.</v>

2006
01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:47.130
<v Speaker 1>The guy who will put this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend crash,</v>

2007
01:22:47.131 --> 01:22:47.964
<v Speaker 1>who put it in our studio just float,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just float is the place in Pasadena and </v>

2008
01:22:51.181 --> 01:22:53.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it's the largest float </v>
<v Speaker 1>center in the world.</v>

2009
01:22:54.630 --> 01:22:57.210
<v Speaker 1>So does that help you stop thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2010
01:22:57.211 --> 01:22:59.640
<v Speaker 1>the opposite I think in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I relax.</v>

2011
01:22:59.830 --> 01:23:00.663
<v Speaker 1>It's very relaxing physically because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the water's warm and you float and you </v>

2012
01:23:04.741 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 1>can do it after the show if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got</v>

01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:07.790
<v Speaker 2>another show that goes until two if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

<v Speaker 2>me to be in there.</v>

2016
01:23:13.331 --> 01:23:15.190
<v Speaker 2>Dan Harris from ABC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good morning.</v>

2017
01:23:15.191 --> 01:23:16.840
<v Speaker 2>America is the only other guy that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>been in there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Dan is a big meditation proponent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I tried meditating and it just hurts </v>

2019
01:23:21.971 --> 01:23:22.804
<v Speaker 2>my back and oh well that will be really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good for your back because it's become </v>

2020
01:23:26.291 --> 01:23:27.124
<v Speaker 2>weightless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just float in there and the water's </v>

2021
01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:29.553
<v Speaker 2>the same temperature as the surface of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your skin so you don't feel the water </v>

2022
01:23:31.451 --> 01:23:33.220
<v Speaker 2>after awhile and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2023
01:23:33.221 --> 01:23:36.160
<v Speaker 2>you're in total darkness and total </v>
<v Speaker 2>silence and you just chill out in there,</v>

2024
01:23:36.161 --> 01:23:37.530
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels.</v>

2025
01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:38.513
<v Speaker 2>It feels good.</v>

2026
01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:39.720
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to do it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2029
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.960
<v Speaker 3>we know how to prepare for life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know how to enjoy life.</v>

2030
01:23:51.961 --> 01:23:52.794
<v Speaker 3>Once it gets here,</v>

2031
01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:54.680
<v Speaker 2>you gotta get good at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2032
01:23:54.710 --> 01:23:55.331
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2033
01:23:55.331 --> 01:23:56.164

<v Speaker 2>I'm stressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2038
01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:09.080

<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:10.910
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm trying to be more silly.</v>

2040
01:24:10.911 --> 01:24:13.820
<v Speaker 2>Just smoke weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll smoke a little bit more.</v>

2041

<v Speaker 2>It can be done,</v>

2046
01:24:26.850 --> 01:24:29.720
<v Speaker 2>but then I can't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can know you can.</v>

2049
01:24:32.751 --> 01:24:34.370

<v Speaker 2>do yoga or anything.</v>

2053

01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:48.680
<v Speaker 2>swimming is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he said I could swim.</v>

2058
01:24:48.770 --> 01:24:49.603
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2059
01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:53.180
<v Speaker 2>So the most boring thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Swimming man.</v>

2060
01:24:53.181 --> 01:24:55.530
<v Speaker 2>I like getting high and swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2061
01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:56.810
<v Speaker 2>it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels good.</v>

2062
01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:58.540
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2063
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:59.623
<v Speaker 2>you can see every exercise like lifting </v>
<v Speaker 2>weights or anything along those lines </v>

2064
01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:03.553
<v Speaker 2>because your bone issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would think that lifting weights </v>

2065
01:25:05.511 --> 01:25:07.040
<v Speaker 2>would enhance your bone density.</v>

2066
01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:10.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just hurts.</v>

2067
01:25:10.530 --> 01:25:13.490
<v Speaker 3>So I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't even pick up a suitcase.</v>

2068
01:25:13.491 --> 01:25:15.290
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really fuck man.</v>

2069
01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:18.140
<v Speaker 3>Have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget often and I will then fuck.</v>

2070
01:25:18.141 --> 01:25:19.940
<v Speaker 3>And then my back hurts for the whole day</v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

2071
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:21.870
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause,</v>

01:25:21.871 --> 01:25:22.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

2073
01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:25.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's about being coming present.</v>

2074
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:28.580
<v Speaker 3>And I love listen to this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eckhart tolle.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2079
01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:39.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's really getting me,</v>

2080
01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:41.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2081
01:25:41.061 --> 01:25:42.890
<v Speaker 3>when things frustrate you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love what he says.</v>

2082
01:25:42.891 --> 01:25:44.570
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world isn't here to make you happy.</v>

2083
01:25:44.571 --> 01:25:46.520
<v Speaker 3>It's here to frustrate you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you wake up,</v>

2084
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:48.150
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2085
01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:49.431
<v Speaker 3>when I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2086
01:25:49.431 --> 01:25:50.264
<v Speaker 3>so now you can use your frustrations as </v>
<v Speaker 3>reminders to wake up and so whenever </v>

2087
01:25:55.131 --> 01:25:56.410
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's hard because,</v>

2088
01:25:56.411 --> 01:25:57.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2089
01:25:57.070 --> 01:25:59.590
<v Speaker 3>I have a temper and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2090
01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:02.440
<v Speaker 3>and that's the weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I,</v>

2091
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:03.703
<v Speaker 3>I hid my temper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my anger through my standup and I was </v>

2092
01:26:06.471 --> 01:26:08.780
<v Speaker 3>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had specials and everything,</v>

2093
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:11.540
<v Speaker 3>but now I don't hide it and now I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>really sick.</v>

2094
01:26:11.541 --> 01:26:12.740
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm selling tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2095
01:26:12.741 --> 01:26:14.840
<v Speaker 3>Because that's the ultimate goal is if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could sell tickets,</v>

2096
01:26:14.841 --> 01:26:17.090
<v Speaker 3>then you don't need anybody and yeah.</v>

2097
01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:18.173
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like there's some sort of </v>

2098
01:26:19.431 --> 01:26:20.264
<v Speaker 4>internal conflict between you getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>angry and ranting and talking about </v>

2099
01:26:24.081 --> 01:26:24.914
<v Speaker 4>things that are very important to you </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then going on stage and doing </v>

2100
01:26:26.991 --> 01:26:27.824
<v Speaker 4>standup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that they should be </v>

2101
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.550
<v Speaker 4>mutually</v>

2102
01:26:29.550 --> 01:26:30.201
<v Speaker 3>inclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2103
01:26:30.201 --> 01:26:33.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to bring them together and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then my wife would always tell me,</v>

2104
01:26:33.211 --> 01:26:35.730
<v Speaker 3>you got to rent on your set,</v>
<v Speaker 3>upset you gotta read,</v>

2105
01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:37.500
<v Speaker 3>you gotta get angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2106
01:26:37.501 --> 01:26:39.510
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I would never really do it.</v>

2107
01:26:39.770 --> 01:26:40.603
<v Speaker 4>Well you just got to balance it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just going to find out a way to make </v>

2108
01:26:42.501 --> 01:26:43.430
<v Speaker 4>that ramp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Funny,</v>

2109
01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:44.390
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2110
01:26:44.810 --> 01:26:49.250
<v Speaker 4>find perspectives that are relatable </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you go into this rant,</v>

2111
01:26:49.251 --> 01:26:51.620
<v Speaker 4>but then bring it to these people in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>digestible way,</v>

2112
01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:52.820
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2113
01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:53.850
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2114
01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:55.513
<v Speaker 3>what's happening is I'm showing videos </v>
<v Speaker 3>now at my live show and those get me </v>

2115
01:26:59.810 --> 01:27:03.080
<v Speaker 3>into that groove and I just dropped a </v>
<v Speaker 3>video kind of videos.</v>

2116
01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:04.093
<v Speaker 3>Like I just dropped a video about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a live show at the flappers in </v>

2117
01:27:07.791 --> 01:27:08.710
<v Speaker 3>Burbank and I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2118
01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:09.813
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I showed a video of Keith Olbermann </v>

2119
01:27:11.190 --> 01:27:15.770
<v Speaker 3>apologizing to John Mccain and George </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bush on the view and that.</v>

2120
01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:17.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does,</v>

2121
01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.130
<v Speaker 3>what does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He,</v>

2122
01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:20.330
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's trying to.</v>

2123
01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:23.000
<v Speaker 3>He was talking to Megan Mccain and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently,</v>

2124
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.863
<v Speaker 3>this was a couple months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he going crazy because he retired from </v>

2125
01:27:26.451 --> 01:27:27.860
<v Speaker 3>that show that he was doing it in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>basement.</v>

2126
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:31.550
<v Speaker 3>So trump excites the lizard brain of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain kind of neo liberal.</v>

2127
01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:34.520
<v Speaker 3>And Olbermann is certainly one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

2128
01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:35.593
<v Speaker 3>He pretends all the problems in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>country started on January 2017 and </v>

2129
01:27:39.201 --> 01:27:40.940
<v Speaker 3>that's certainly not it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was great.</v>

2130
01:27:40.941 --> 01:27:41.774
<v Speaker 3>He could deconstruct what was wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton back in 2008 when she </v>

2131
01:27:44.961 --> 01:27:45.794
<v Speaker 3>was running against Barack Obama and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>could deconstruct it was wrong with the </v>

2132
01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:50.030
<v Speaker 3>Iraq war and what was wrong with Bush </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Cheney,</v>

2133
01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:51.253
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somehow all of a sudden now he pretend </v>

2134
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:55.740
<v Speaker 3>it's like again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he trump excites,</v>

2135
01:27:55.741 --> 01:27:59.750
<v Speaker 3>says lizard brain and all his critical </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking skills go out the window and he</v>

2136
01:27:59.751 --> 01:28:00.584
<v Speaker 3>pretends that all our protest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump is the problem and not a symptom </v>

2137
01:28:02.691 --> 01:28:03.410
<v Speaker 3>of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2138
01:28:03.410 --> 01:28:04.100
<v Speaker 3>it was a scene</v>

2139
01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:04.933
<v Speaker 4>in a movie when he was doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looked like he was doing a show in </v>

2140
01:28:07.191 --> 01:28:08.024
<v Speaker 4>the basement somewhere with this weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>background who was called the </v>

2141
01:28:11.001 --> 01:28:12.980
<v Speaker 4>resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the resistance,</v>

2142
01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:14.780
<v Speaker 4>but he was also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't.</v>

2143
01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:15.973
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't making connections like was that </v>
<v Speaker 4>law that really a pretty conservative </v>

2144
01:28:21.441 --> 01:28:23.420
<v Speaker 4>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tammy Lauren,</v>

2145
01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:26.720
<v Speaker 4>is that her name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She did a thing where she was covered in</v>

2146
01:28:26.721 --> 01:28:27.554
<v Speaker 4>the American flag and he was talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about how hypocritical it is to be </v>

2147
01:28:31.221 --> 01:28:34.160
<v Speaker 4>standing there holding draping yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the American flag.</v>

2148
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:39.550
<v Speaker 4>And then Donald Trump jr posts a picture</v>
<v Speaker 4>of Tammy Lauren right next to him.</v>

2149
01:28:40.161 --> 01:28:43.640
<v Speaker 4>Doing the same thing and Donald Trump jr</v>
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>

2150
01:28:43.641 --> 01:28:47.130
<v Speaker 4>it must be painful to be so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like in like,</v>

2151
01:28:47.170 --> 01:28:48.003
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even understand how he could </v>

2152
01:28:48.871 --> 01:28:51.950
<v Speaker 4>have not known.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He took that picture to be draped in it.</v>

2153
01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:52.813
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how could he not know that he took </v>

2154
01:28:54.021 --> 01:28:57.290
<v Speaker 4>that picture?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he admitted on so smart.</v>

2155
01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:58.150
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing.</v>

2156
01:28:58.150 --> 01:29:00.050
<v Speaker 4>Listen to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's incredibly articulate.</v>

2157
01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:02.550
<v Speaker 4>He's A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love the skill</v>

2158
01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:07.640
<v Speaker 2>in which he writes is a great form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was my key dormant.</v>

2159
01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:08.700
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2160
01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:10.010
<v Speaker 2>I was a huge fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2161
01:29:10.210 --> 01:29:13.860
<v Speaker 2>It was great with sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's sort of old school lead type</v>

2162
01:29:14.190 --> 01:29:15.023
<v Speaker 2>delivery that I enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a great broadcaster and you always </v>

2163
01:29:17.581 --> 01:29:20.880
<v Speaker 2>hear stories about his idiosyncrasies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's a prick to work with and stuff</v>

2164
01:29:20.881 --> 01:29:21.611
<v Speaker 2>and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well fuck.</v>

2165
01:29:21.611 --> 01:29:22.590
<v Speaker 2>I gave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do?</v>

2166
01:29:22.591 --> 01:29:23.221
<v Speaker 2>So who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2167
01:29:23.221 --> 01:29:24.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't work with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to watch them.</v>

2168
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:26.183
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the truth with a lot of </v>

2169
01:29:27.331 --> 01:29:28.164
<v Speaker 2>people that are apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things about being great at </v>

2170
01:29:31.291 --> 01:29:34.140
<v Speaker 2>something is a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking fanatical about it.</v>

2171
01:29:34.170 --> 01:29:35.003
<v Speaker 2>You get crazy,</v>

01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:06.753
<v Speaker 1>she should be shunned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that she's doing that </v>

2287
01:34:09.130 --> 01:34:12.610
<v Speaker 1>rationally?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that she is confused,</v>

2288
01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:17.560
<v Speaker 1>please being coerced and pushed into </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of that certain direction?</v>

2289
01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she's being coerced and push,</v>

2290
01:34:20.271 --> 01:34:23.170
<v Speaker 1>but I think she goes along willingly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting that 30,</v>

2291
01:34:23.290 --> 01:34:25.720
<v Speaker 1>30 k a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not going to talk out against,</v>

2292
01:34:25.721 --> 01:34:27.790
<v Speaker 1>make a t shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like 30 k a day.</v>

2293
01:34:27.791 --> 01:34:28.750
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have your way.</v>

2294
01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:32.260
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I show.</v>

2295
01:34:32.261 --> 01:34:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Can I steal that phrase phrase?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2296
01:34:34.781 --> 01:34:37.210
<v Speaker 1>I think I may.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may make a day and you could have your</v>

2297
01:34:37.211 --> 01:34:40.490
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is neo liberalism,</v>

2298
01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:41.333
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real problem is the system and </v>

2299
01:34:42.881 --> 01:34:45.610
<v Speaker 1>they'll never talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want also tribalism,</v>

2300
01:34:45.611 --> 01:34:46.444
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything that opposes the other side </v>

2301
01:34:47.501 --> 01:34:48.640
<v Speaker 1>must be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2302
01:34:48.641 --> 01:34:51.070
<v Speaker 1>In anything you can use on them must be </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2303
01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:51.933
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's happening right now with </v>

2304
01:34:52.361 --> 01:34:53.194
<v Speaker 1>trump and it's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a way to oppose trump </v>

2305
01:34:55.901 --> 01:34:58.030
<v Speaker 1>and it's not the way you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fucking will</v>

2306
01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:00.470
<v Speaker 3>affect the way they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It enhances trump.</v>

2307
01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:03.620
<v Speaker 3>It makes them more powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You keep coming at him that he'd go with</v>

2308
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:05.990
<v Speaker 3>his guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the battered wife,</v>

2309
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.060
<v Speaker 3>and he gives up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

2310
01:35:08.061 --> 01:35:11.840
<v Speaker 3>they're spending 160 billion more </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars on bombs that nobody wants.</v>

2311
01:35:12.170 --> 01:35:14.480
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half the country is poor or low income.</v>

2312
01:35:14.481 --> 01:35:15.314
<v Speaker 3>Sixty three percent of Americans can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>afford a thousand dollar emergency in </v>

2313
01:35:17.721 --> 01:35:19.850
<v Speaker 3>the richest country that face of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth has ever seen.</v>

2314
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.330
<v Speaker 3>All the benefits of this recovery has </v>
<v Speaker 3>gone to the upper one percent.</v>

2315
01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:25.280
<v Speaker 3>People haven't had a raise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2316
01:35:25.281 --> 01:35:26.114
<v Speaker 3>I just saw the afl cio was telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people give me shit because I wouldn't </v>

2317
01:35:29.031 --> 01:35:30.400
<v Speaker 3>vote for Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2318
01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:32.230
<v Speaker 3>And I just saw the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2319
01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:34.213
<v Speaker 3>the AFL cio tweeted out last week that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the union unions have helped give </v>

2320
01:35:40.521 --> 01:35:42.590
<v Speaker 3>Democrats complete control of </v>
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>

2321
01:35:42.890 --> 01:35:45.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four times in the last three decades.</v>

2322
01:35:45.290 --> 01:35:47.570
<v Speaker 3>And they have done nothing to help </v>
<v Speaker 3>unions.</v>

2323
01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:50.090
<v Speaker 3>And they're saying vote third party </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got.</v>

2324
01:35:50.091 --> 01:35:50.924
<v Speaker 3>They got together with the Teachers </v>
<v Speaker 3>Union and the postal union and they're </v>

2325
01:35:53.481 --> 01:35:53.901
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2326
01:35:53.901 --> 01:35:54.734
<v Speaker 3>let's reveal voting isn't working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to somehow come up with a third </v>

2327
01:35:57.861 --> 01:35:58.600
<v Speaker 3>party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're.</v>

2328
01:35:58.600 --> 01:35:59.433
<v Speaker 3>They're talking about it now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people who are wagging their finger </v>

2329
01:36:01.611 --> 01:36:02.091
<v Speaker 3>at me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2330
01:36:02.091 --> 01:36:02.924
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the unions agree with me now that </v>

2331
01:36:04.071 --> 01:36:04.904
<v Speaker 3>we've got to have a third party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if Bernie Sanders would have went </v>

2332
01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:07.813
<v Speaker 3>with a third party instead of propping </v>
<v Speaker 3>up that corporatist warmonger like he </v>

2333
01:36:10.251 --> 01:36:12.410
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could have really changed politics in</v>

2334
01:36:12.411 --> 01:36:13.244
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If Jill Stein and the Green party would </v>

2335
01:36:14.511 --> 01:36:17.300
<v Speaker 3>have got 10 or 15 percent of the vote or</v>
<v Speaker 3>even five percent of the vote,</v>

2336
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:18.343
<v Speaker 3>it would have completely changed our </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics in America because now the </v>

2337
01:36:20.661 --> 01:36:21.494
<v Speaker 3>Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wag their finger at their base and </v>

2338
01:36:23.571 --> 01:36:24.404
<v Speaker 3>then they move to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Hillary Clinton wagged her finger </v>

2339
01:36:26.031 --> 01:36:29.150
<v Speaker 3>at the base and then picked Tim Kaine </v>
<v Speaker 3>who was to the right of her.</v>

2340
01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:31.010
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if,</v>

2341
01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:31.903
<v Speaker 3>if Bernie Sanders would have went with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Greens and they would have made it </v>

2342
01:36:33.450 --> 01:36:34.970
<v Speaker 3>showing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now they can't do that.</v>

2343
01:36:34.971 --> 01:36:35.804
<v Speaker 3>They can't dismiss them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they have to come together in a </v>

2344
01:36:37.611 --> 01:36:38.444
<v Speaker 3>coalition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was doing it in a calculated </v>

2345
01:36:40.731 --> 01:36:41.564
<v Speaker 3>manner to try to get some Republicans </v>
<v Speaker 3>that thought that Donald Trump was </v>

2346
01:36:43.530 --> 01:36:45.530
<v Speaker 3>republican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton,</v>

2347
01:36:45.531 --> 01:36:48.110
<v Speaker 3>their whole strategy was work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck overworking people that we're going</v>

2348
01:36:48.111 --> 01:36:51.680
<v Speaker 3>to try to get white collar Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what your party is.</v>

2349
01:36:51.690 --> 01:36:53.270
<v Speaker 3>There's already a party for those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2350
01:36:53.630 --> 01:36:55.280
<v Speaker 3>There's a part is called the Republican </v>
<v Speaker 3>Party.</v>

2351
01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:58.280
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to be the party of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking workers and that.</v>

2352
01:36:58.281 --> 01:37:00.500
<v Speaker 3>That's why we don't have an opposition </v>
<v Speaker 3>party in this country.</v>

2353
01:37:00.501 --> 01:37:01.334
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we have to two parties at a pro </v>

2354
01:37:02.481 --> 01:37:04.370
<v Speaker 3>management.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that Nissan.</v>

2355
01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:08.810
<v Speaker 3>Nissan has 49 plants around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three of them are not union.</v>

2356
01:37:08.811 --> 01:37:10.160
<v Speaker 3>You know where those three plants are?</v>

2357
01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:13.430
<v Speaker 3>United fucking states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've got a broken system,</v>

2358
01:37:13.431 --> 01:37:16.310
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are are the problem is the Democrats are</v>

2359
01:37:16.311 --> 01:37:18.890
<v Speaker 3>bought by the same people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just a little,</v>

2360
01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:20.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people go,</v>

2361
01:37:20.091 --> 01:37:20.924
<v Speaker 3>why did the Democrats keep caving?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why didn't they stand up against trump </v>

2362
01:37:23.301 --> 01:37:25.130
<v Speaker 3>for Daca?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not caving.</v>

2363
01:37:25.250 --> 01:37:29.210
<v Speaker 3>They're standing up to you the voter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're standing up to their donors.</v>

2364
01:37:29.230 --> 01:37:30.063
<v Speaker 3>Their donors don't want the government </v>
<v Speaker 3>shut down for one minute and that's </v>

2365
01:37:32.361 --> 01:37:33.194
<v Speaker 3>where they're standing up for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could have stood up for the voters </v>

2366
01:37:35.481 --> 01:37:37.610
<v Speaker 3>and and stood up for Daca,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't.</v>

2367
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:40.820
<v Speaker 3>They stood up for their donors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not like they're spineless.</v>

2368
01:37:40.821 --> 01:37:41.654
<v Speaker 3>They appeared spineless because it looks</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're not doing what they're </v>

2369
01:37:44.181 --> 01:37:45.830
<v Speaker 3>supposed to or what they say they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

2370
01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:47.570
<v Speaker 3>and they're not doing what they said </v>
<v Speaker 3>they would do,</v>

2371
01:37:47.571 --> 01:37:48.404
<v Speaker 3>which is stand up for the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're secretly standing up for </v>

2372
01:37:51.081 --> 01:37:53.780
<v Speaker 3>their donors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a steel spine when it comes to</v>

2373
01:37:53.781 --> 01:37:54.614
<v Speaker 3>their donors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why they gave the trump </v>

2374
01:37:55.651 --> 01:37:56.880
<v Speaker 3>$160,000,000,000.</v>

2375
01:37:57.570 --> 01:37:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Can I make one last point about Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump?</v>

2376
01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:02.250
<v Speaker 1>So this shows you how they're full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2377
01:38:02.610 --> 01:38:03.443
<v Speaker 1>When you say Donald Trump is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential threat to our country and a </v>

2378
01:38:05.911 --> 01:38:06.744
<v Speaker 1>maniac and he has his finger on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>button and then you vote to give them </v>

2379
01:38:09.181 --> 01:38:12.630
<v Speaker 1>$160,000,000,000 more in bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're full of shit.</v>

2380
01:38:12.631 --> 01:38:13.464
<v Speaker 1>When you say he's existential maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say that this guy is unhinged </v>

2381
01:38:17.101 --> 01:38:17.934
<v Speaker 1>and you can't be trusted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you vote to expand his </v>

2382
01:38:20.341 --> 01:38:21.174
<v Speaker 1>warrantless wiretapping and spying </v>
<v Speaker 1>powers on his own enemies in the </v>

2383
01:38:23.851 --> 01:38:26.160
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I know in your fullest shit,</v>

2384
01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:28.200
<v Speaker 1>because if they really wanted to check </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>

2385
01:38:28.230 --> 01:38:30.510
<v Speaker 1>they would check him on the military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Pentagon budget,</v>

2386
01:38:30.570 --> 01:38:33.450
<v Speaker 1>and his spying powers and they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanded all that stuff,</v>

2387
01:38:33.570 --> 01:38:34.403
<v Speaker 1>so if he's really a maniac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those motherfuckers are the most </v>

2388
01:38:36.121 --> 01:38:36.954
<v Speaker 1>irresponsible people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giving him all this extra power for the </v>

2389
01:38:39.481 --> 01:38:40.314
<v Speaker 1>Pentagon and spike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they know the only reason they hate </v>

2390
01:38:42.211 --> 01:38:43.890
<v Speaker 1>trump because ain't part of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking club.</v>

2391
01:38:45.850 --> 01:38:46.683
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy door just laid it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're going to get hate mail from </v>

2392
01:38:49.441 --> 01:38:50.940
<v Speaker 1>people that are Hillary Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporters.</v>

2393
01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come.</v>

2394
01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:53.040
<v Speaker 1>I hope you're ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2395
01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:54.193

<v Speaker 1>always killed me about Hillary Clinton </v>

2396
01:38:57.631 --> 01:39:00.600
<v Speaker 1>more than when or when I would talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Super Democrats,</v>

2397
01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:03.510
<v Speaker 1>like people that were just completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribal there on the democratic side,</v>

2398
01:39:03.511 --> 01:39:05.070
<v Speaker 1>no matter what I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2399
01:39:05.071 --> 01:39:07.900
<v Speaker 1>she didn't support gay marriage until </v>
<v Speaker 1>2001.</v>

2400
01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

2401
01:39:08.730 --> 01:39:09.563
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a sexual harasser and her </v>

2402
01:39:10.291 --> 01:39:12.600
<v Speaker 1>campaign in 2008 and she didn't fire the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking guy.</v>

2403
01:39:12.601 --> 01:39:13.434
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she covered for him and anyone onto </v>

2404
01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:18.090
<v Speaker 1>sexually harassed again in another </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization tied to Hillary Clinton.</v>

2405
01:39:18.091 --> 01:39:18.924
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The record.</v>

2406
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the problem is,</v>

2407
01:39:20.551 --> 01:39:21.384
<v Speaker 1>I think when you're close to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find out all the dirty details </v>

2408
01:39:24.010 --> 01:39:26.880
<v Speaker 1>what's going on behind the scenes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a creepy,</v>

2409
01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:29.040
<v Speaker 1>creepy organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was the.</v>

2410
01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:33.900
<v Speaker 1>She was such a flawed person for </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminists to wrap their flag around.</v>

2411
01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:35.460
<v Speaker 1>She.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not the person.</v>

2412
01:39:35.490 --> 01:39:37.290
<v Speaker 1>There was another woman running in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>race.</v>

2413
01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:38.970
<v Speaker 1>It was Jill Stein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I voted for her.</v>

2414
01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Nobody cared about her though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a weird one.</v>

2415
01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:42.513
<v Speaker 1>It's because trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was exactly what Hillary Clinton </v>

2416
01:39:43.831 --> 01:39:45.390
<v Speaker 1>wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Pied Piper Strategy.</v>

2417
01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:46.373
<v Speaker 1>You can't even entertain not voting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton because of this </v>

2418
01:39:49.231 --> 01:39:52.350
<v Speaker 1>existential threat of trump and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>such an existential threat.</v>

2419
01:39:52.351 --> 01:39:53.184
<v Speaker 1>We're going to vote to expand its buying</v>
<v Speaker 1>powers and given by bullet of military </v>

2420
01:39:55.561 --> 01:39:56.080
<v Speaker 1>budget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2421
01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:56.913
<v Speaker 1>we saw this Hashtag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with her stuff to where they wanted </v>

2422
01:39:58.831 --> 01:40:02.100
<v Speaker 1>to have one female president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a historical victory.</v>

2423
01:40:02.101 --> 01:40:05.340
<v Speaker 1>That's why so many people were crying on</v>
<v Speaker 1>television because they were watching an</v>

2424
01:40:05.341 --> 01:40:06.174
<v Speaker 1>avengers movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't really involved in the </v>

2425
01:40:07.831 --> 01:40:08.664
<v Speaker 1>actual political process itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't understand what was </v>

2426
01:40:10.741 --> 01:40:12.900
<v Speaker 1>happening and they didn't understand who</v>
<v Speaker 1>she really was.</v>

2427
01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:14.333
<v Speaker 1>That's it from the beginning to the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you go and there's just so much </v>

2428
01:40:17.011 --> 01:40:18.720
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember that off camera interview,</v>

2429
01:40:18.721 --> 01:40:20.940
<v Speaker 1>which she was talking about Kadafi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We came,</v>

2430
01:40:20.941 --> 01:40:25.080
<v Speaker 1>we saw he died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's laughing like psychopath.</v>

2431
01:40:25.110 --> 01:40:27.930
<v Speaker 1>What kind of a person is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy person now in Libya.</v>

2432
01:40:27.931 --> 01:40:29.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a failed state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2433
01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:32.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a failed state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a haven for terrorists.</v>

2434
01:40:32.370 --> 01:40:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Slavery's back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that shit?</v>

2435
01:40:34.770 --> 01:40:35.603
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On Youtube you can watch slave trade in </v>

2436
01:40:38.791 --> 01:40:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Libya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2437
01:40:39.490 --> 01:40:41.510
<v Speaker 1>that's her success story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2438
01:40:41.670 --> 01:40:43.440
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's her horrific.</v>

2439
01:40:43.650 --> 01:40:45.380
<v Speaker 1>But don't you let me ask you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2440
01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:46.201
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2441
01:40:46.201 --> 01:40:48.770
<v Speaker 1>I dunno if you like my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my big things is,</v>

2442
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:49.663
<v Speaker 1>is the reason why I have a show is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because mainstream news media sucks so </v>

2443
01:40:52.291 --> 01:40:53.950
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you have this show</v>

2444
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:55.990
<v Speaker 3>is because late night talk shows suck so</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad,</v>

2445
01:40:56.380 --> 01:40:57.213
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2446
01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:59.050
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's established stuck.</v>

2447
01:40:59.210 --> 01:41:00.043
<v Speaker 4>They have commercials and they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>these things that they do and they have </v>

2448
01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:05.300
<v Speaker 4>never had this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you would.</v>

2449
01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:06.800
<v Speaker 4>They would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone would come and Jimmy.</v>

2450
01:41:06.801 --> 01:41:08.000
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

2451
01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:10.650
<v Speaker 4>you can't listen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not the time for this.</v>

2452
01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:12.140
<v Speaker 4>Just want to talk about this in your own</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2453
01:41:13.090 --> 01:41:14.760
<v Speaker 4>At the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary is this,</v>

2454
01:41:14.810 --> 01:41:15.643
<v Speaker 4>a lot of Hillary supporters on staff and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're very upset right now and they </v>

2455
01:41:17.631 --> 01:41:20.930
<v Speaker 4>feel that you guys were massage and see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you see Jimmy Fallon?</v>

2456
01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:21.793

<v Speaker 3>I don't know Jimmy Fallon and I've only </v>

2457
01:41:23.391 --> 01:41:25.150
<v Speaker 3>bumped into him and he's always been a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gentleman.</v>

2458
01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:25.993
<v Speaker 3>Nice Guy,</v>

2459
01:41:28.311 --> 01:41:30.840
<v Speaker 3>bad to say about Jimmy Fallon,</v>

01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:33.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a segment where they had Hillary Clinton</v>

<v Speaker 3>notes and they read them to Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 3>Clinton.</v>

<v Speaker 3>For being then running for fucking </v>

<v Speaker 3>office.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So now the Washington Post this what I </v>

2476
01:42:10.381 --> 01:42:11.214
<v Speaker 3>wanted to ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wrote a whole thing about how </v>

<v Speaker 4>you're a fool because it's a conspiracy </v>

2480
01:42:18.541 --> 01:42:21.210
<v Speaker 4>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And can you say conspiracy theory,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2483
01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:28.260
<v Speaker 4>But just put it down on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's just look at what.</v>

2484
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:29.343
<v Speaker 4>Look at real hard facts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seth rich was a Bernie Sanders </v>

2485
01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:35.760
<v Speaker 4>supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seth rich was a Patriot seth,</v>

2486
01:42:35.761 --> 01:42:38.460
<v Speaker 4>which according to Julian assange and </v>
<v Speaker 4>wikileaks,</v>

2487
01:42:38.461 --> 01:42:39.294
<v Speaker 4>which have not been proven to be liars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never had to retract anything they </v>

2488
01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:42.780
<v Speaker 4>printed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've never had to do that.</v>

2489
01:42:43.260 --> 01:42:44.093
<v Speaker 4>He's saying that he leaked stuff to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are consequences leaking stuff to </v>

2490
01:42:48.190 --> 01:42:49.023
<v Speaker 4>wikileaks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seth rich was murdered at 4:00 in the </v>

2491
01:42:51.151 --> 01:42:52.440
<v Speaker 4>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shot in the back.</v>

2492
01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:53.333
<v Speaker 4>They said it was a botched robbery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no one took anything from him and </v>

2493
01:42:55.651 --> 01:42:57.600
<v Speaker 4>there's never been anyone that's charged</v>
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>

2494
01:42:57.601 --> 01:43:00.030
<v Speaker 4>And there's no suspects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2495
01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:03.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what happened to him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that looks very</v>

2496
01:43:03.690 --> 01:43:05.340
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not even allowed to ask questions</v>

2497
01:43:05.341 --> 01:43:06.174
<v Speaker 3>because I covered that story one day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I covered it one day because that guy </v>

2498
01:43:09.421 --> 01:43:11.310
<v Speaker 3>wheeler came out and he was saying he </v>
<v Speaker 3>had all this.</v>

2499
01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:15.180
<v Speaker 3>He saw the computer and all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I covered that in your piece of shit.</v>

2500
01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:18.720
<v Speaker 3>And you're a conspiracy theorist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In that video I did.</v>

2501
01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:21.050
<v Speaker 3>I literally said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2502
01:43:21.450 --> 01:43:24.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're waiting for evidence,</v>

2503
01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:27.030
<v Speaker 3>unlike the mainstream news media with </v>
<v Speaker 3>their Russia bullshit.</v>

2504
01:43:27.210 --> 01:43:30.750
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna wait for evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I literally said that inside that.</v>

2505
01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:32.033
<v Speaker 3>And then the next day I did another </v>
<v Speaker 3>video which debunk that Guy Wheeler who </v>

2506
01:43:34.351 --> 01:43:35.184
<v Speaker 3>was pushing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that story because he turned out he was </v>

2507
01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:39.570
<v Speaker 3>full of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what was the response though?</v>

2508
01:43:40.050 --> 01:43:42.690
<v Speaker 3>People still to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking smear.</v>

2509
01:43:42.691 --> 01:43:43.820
<v Speaker 3>Meet with that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2510

<v Speaker 3>you pushed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2511
01:43:44.701 --> 01:43:46.050
<v Speaker 3>I covered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would do a new show.</v>

2512
01:43:46.051 --> 01:43:48.030
<v Speaker 3>I covered a new show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

2513
01:43:48.031 --> 01:43:51.000
<v Speaker 3>why aren't you allowed to ask questions </v>
<v Speaker 3>about an open murder investigation?</v>

2514
01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

2515
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:52.843
<v Speaker 4>this is a re look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a guy who was a real Bernie </v>

2516
01:43:56.690 --> 01:43:58.700
<v Speaker 4>Sanders supporter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>open Bernie Sanders supporter who worked</v>

2517
01:43:58.701 --> 01:43:59.534
<v Speaker 4>for the DNC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The DNC absolutely rigged the primary </v>

2518
01:44:02.631 --> 01:44:04.850
<v Speaker 4>against Bernie Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was aware of this.</v>

2519
01:44:04.851 --> 01:44:06.410
<v Speaker 4>He was there while this was all going </v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

2520
01:44:06.530 --> 01:44:08.520
<v Speaker 4>So is Donald Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone was aware of that.</v>

2521
01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:12.350
<v Speaker 4>The guy got fucking murdered after he </v>
<v Speaker 4>leaked information to wikileaks.</v>

2522
01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:14.030
<v Speaker 4>If you don't think that's a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird,</v>

2523
01:44:14.210 --> 01:44:15.790
<v Speaker 4>what are you looking at?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2524
01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:18.740
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What delusional rose colored glasses.</v>

2525
01:44:18.741 --> 01:44:19.574
<v Speaker 4>Are you looking at your party from a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think you're in some Julia Roberts </v>

2526
01:44:21.741 --> 01:44:24.230
<v Speaker 4>movie from Nineteen Ninety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is real shit.</v>

2527
01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:27.350
<v Speaker 4>Some guy got killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was 24 years old.</v>

2528
01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:28.333
<v Speaker 4>He was a young guy who is very </v>
<v Speaker 4>optimistic and have this view of the </v>

2529
01:44:33.831 --> 01:44:37.130
<v Speaker 4>world where he meets the guy fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>war,</v>

2530
01:44:37.190 --> 01:44:38.023
<v Speaker 4>American flag pants and shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a famous picture of him with a </v>

2531
01:44:41.031 --> 01:44:41.864
<v Speaker 4>beer on me is the Patriot that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways he wanted to be involved in the </v>

2532
01:44:45.021 --> 01:44:46.070
<v Speaker 4>political process.</v>

2533
01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:51.520
<v Speaker 4>He was very idealistic because is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was probably shattered by finding out</v>

2534
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:55.340
<v Speaker 4>the party that he was working for was </v>
<v Speaker 4>corrupting the democratic process.</v>

2535
01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:58.630
<v Speaker 4>And because I've said this before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2536
01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:02.900
<v Speaker 4>I've been accused of helping Donald </v>
<v Speaker 4>Trump win by really wacky people online,</v>

2537
01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:04.850
<v Speaker 4>but pointing out all the flaws of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton,</v>

2538
01:45:04.851 --> 01:45:05.361
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2539
01:45:05.361 --> 01:45:06.194
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't ignore that shit because you </v>

2540
01:45:07.731 --> 01:45:08.564
<v Speaker 4>want one side to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I've talked about all of his flaws </v>

2541
01:45:11.511 --> 01:45:14.210
<v Speaker 4>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of flawed human beings are</v>

2542
01:45:14.211 --> 01:45:15.920
<v Speaker 4>run for president pretty much all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2543
01:45:16.190 --> 01:45:17.023
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very rare you have someone who's </v>

2544
01:45:17.781 --> 01:45:18.830
<v Speaker 4>not flawed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2545
01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:22.070
<v Speaker 4>Extremely flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're all flawed but extremely flawed.</v>

2546
01:45:22.190 --> 01:45:23.780
<v Speaker 4>Who wants to be the fucking King of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world?</v>

2547
01:45:23.810 --> 01:45:25.190
<v Speaker 4>It's very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2548
01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:26.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2549
01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:29.380
<v Speaker 3>not to change subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Barack Obama,</v>

2550
01:45:29.381 --> 01:45:31.190
<v Speaker 3>everyone thinks is the greatest guy in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

2551
01:45:31.210 --> 01:45:32.043
<v Speaker 3>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in contrast to Donald Trump because he </v>

2552
01:45:34.151 --> 01:45:35.830
<v Speaker 3>was polite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a statesman,</v>

2553
01:45:35.860 --> 01:45:37.110
<v Speaker 3>he was a good speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>live site,</v>

2554
01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:39.550
<v Speaker 3>but at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was polite at the same time.</v>

2555
01:45:39.551 --> 01:45:40.384
<v Speaker 3>He let cops correct the heads of </v>
<v Speaker 3>peaceful protesters at occupy Wall </v>

2556
01:45:42.910 --> 01:45:43.743
<v Speaker 3>Street all across the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said he put on a soft shoe to stand </v>

2557
01:45:45.581 --> 01:45:46.414
<v Speaker 3>up for unions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fucked over unions in Wisconsin when </v>

2558
01:45:48.101 --> 01:45:50.070
<v Speaker 3>they took the teacher's union away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2559
01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:53.180
<v Speaker 3>he opened the Arctic to drilling twice </v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever Shell oil won.</v>

2560
01:45:53.181 --> 01:45:54.014
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2561
01:45:54.130 --> 01:45:56.500
<v Speaker 3>and he only closing one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't want to do it anymore.</v>

2562
01:45:56.890 --> 01:45:57.723
<v Speaker 3>He took us from two wars to seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He cooked out five point 1 million </v>

2563
01:46:00.281 --> 01:46:02.830
<v Speaker 3>families out of their homes instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>helping them.</v>

2564
01:46:02.980 --> 01:46:06.040
<v Speaker 3>And he made Wall Street whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucking over everyone else.</v>

2565
01:46:06.041 --> 01:46:07.890
<v Speaker 3>So this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he ended,</v>

2566
01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:10.150
<v Speaker 3>he made the Bush tax cuts permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was,</v>

2567
01:46:10.210 --> 01:46:10.901
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2568
01:46:10.901 --> 01:46:11.950
<v Speaker 3>what they say is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2569
01:46:12.010 --> 01:46:13.870
<v Speaker 3>it looked like it was changing on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside.</v>

2570
01:46:13.871 --> 01:46:14.780
<v Speaker 3>Continuity on the inside.</v>

2571
01:46:15.010 --> 01:46:15.843
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hope and change website had to be </v>

2572
01:46:16.871 --> 01:46:17.704
<v Speaker 4>altered because there was all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things in there about whistleblowers </v>

2573
01:46:20.321 --> 01:46:21.820
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he prosecuted that.</v>

2574
01:46:21.821 --> 01:46:23.520
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he takes,</v>

2575
01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:25.260
<v Speaker 4>he took it out of the website,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2576
01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:26.133
<v Speaker 4>He had all these segment sections on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>website about offering protection for </v>

2577
01:46:28.721 --> 01:46:29.554
<v Speaker 4>whistle blowers and the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also they were like the worst when </v>

2578
01:46:32.711 --> 01:46:34.920
<v Speaker 4>it came to the press.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2579
01:46:35.170 --> 01:46:38.740
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When it came to the press and people and</v>

2580
01:46:38.741 --> 01:46:42.100
<v Speaker 4>freedom of the press and people getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>in trouble for leaking information.</v>

2581
01:46:42.130 --> 01:46:43.720
<v Speaker 4>They were the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The worst,</v>

2582
01:46:43.750 --> 01:46:44.570
<v Speaker 4>much worse</v>

2583
01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:48.590
<v Speaker 3>than Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used the espionage act to prosecute</v>

2584
01:46:48.591 --> 01:46:49.650
<v Speaker 3>journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2585
01:46:49.890 --> 01:46:50.430
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

2586
01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:51.720
<v Speaker 1>then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a fact.</v>

2587
01:46:51.721 --> 01:46:53.100
<v Speaker 1>And everyone turned their head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2588
01:46:53.101 --> 01:46:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Greg Glenn Greenwald used to be a hero </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the left until he started telling the</v>

2589
01:46:56.251 --> 01:46:58.350
<v Speaker 1>truth about Barack Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now he's a pariah.</v>

2590
01:46:58.770 --> 01:46:59.530
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2591
01:46:59.530 --> 01:47:00.900
<v Speaker 1>up to the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2592
01:47:00.930 --> 01:47:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Frank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know you,</v>

2593
01:47:02.531 --> 01:47:04.260
<v Speaker 1>you would love that guy if you ever met </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2594
01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:06.600
<v Speaker 1>He wrote that book called what's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter with Kansas,</v>

2595
01:47:06.601 --> 01:47:08.760
<v Speaker 1>which is examining what's wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives.</v>

2596
01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:11.670
<v Speaker 1>And then he wrote a book called Listen </v>
<v Speaker 1>Liberal,</v>

2597
01:47:12.420 --> 01:47:16.150
<v Speaker 1>which came out I think two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he is persona non grata.</v>

2598
01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:18.030
<v Speaker 1>MSNBC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CNN,</v>

2599
01:47:18.031 --> 01:47:18.864
<v Speaker 1>nobody will talk to him because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>critiqued the left and he talked about </v>

2600
01:47:21.490 --> 01:47:21.930
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2601
01:47:21.930 --> 01:47:22.763
<v Speaker 1>you can't no room for discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even get a job in the United </v>

2602
01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:26.453
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to write for the Guardian in </v>

2603
01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:28.890
<v Speaker 1>England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a true story.</v>

2604
01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:30.110
<v Speaker 1>So I've had him on my show.</v>

2605
01:47:30.130 --> 01:47:30.963
<v Speaker 1>People love him and he comes out and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>tells the truth about the last Frank </v>

2606
01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Frank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's got a great sense of humor too.</v>

2607
01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:39.090
<v Speaker 1>And he's real personable and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero.</v>

2608
01:47:39.150 --> 01:47:41.070
<v Speaker 1>He's an academic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't talk like one.</v>

2609
01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:43.830
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his book,</v>

2610
01:47:43.950 --> 01:47:48.810
<v Speaker 1>listen liberal is what radicalized me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>not be able to vote for Hillary Clinton.</v>

2611
01:47:48.930 --> 01:47:51.030
<v Speaker 1>It opened my eyes to all the bull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2612
01:47:51.031 --> 01:47:54.480
<v Speaker 1>people still fucking blame Ralph Nader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just unbelievable.</v>

2613
01:47:54.481 --> 01:47:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Like you're allowed to participate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy.</v>

2614
01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:01.770
<v Speaker 1>And Hillary Clinton was the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate in the history of politics who</v>

2615
01:48:01.771 --> 01:48:04.350
<v Speaker 1>wasn't expected to garner votes by </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaigning.</v>

2616
01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:06.480
<v Speaker 1>You just were supposed to over your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking votes.</v>

2617
01:48:06.481 --> 01:48:07.314
<v Speaker 1>If she doesn't have the votes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to go get the fucking </v>

2618
01:48:09.181 --> 01:48:10.014
<v Speaker 1>votes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it works is the first time </v>

2619
01:48:11.341 --> 01:48:14.410
<v Speaker 1>ever I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was of poor health and shame.</v>

2620
01:48:14.490 --> 01:48:15.870
<v Speaker 1>She was having a really hard time.</v>

2621
01:48:15.870 --> 01:48:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Donna Brazil would almost want it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>replace her.</v>

2622
01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:18.533
<v Speaker 1>She said in the book that Brazil set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her health was so bad they want it to </v>

2623
01:48:21.031 --> 01:48:21.864
<v Speaker 1>replace her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was another thing that I got in </v>

2624
01:48:23.281 --> 01:48:25.440
<v Speaker 1>trouble for not for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people were saying like,</v>

2625
01:48:25.441 --> 01:48:26.760
<v Speaker 1>why do you keep talking about her </v>
<v Speaker 1>health?</v>

2626
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:31.140
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a huge issue and also I </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to know a lot about brain trauma.</v>

2627
01:48:31.170 --> 01:48:34.830
<v Speaker 1>She had brain trauma and she passes out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said she was a.</v>

2628
01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:36.990
<v Speaker 1>She was hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't take her coat up.</v>

2629
01:48:37.050 --> 01:48:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been hot many times.</v>

2630
01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:40.440
<v Speaker 1>I go in the sun all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never faint.</v>

2631
01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't want to run for president.</v>

2632
01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:46.350
<v Speaker 1>You can't just fall asleep while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing up and be president.</v>

2633
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:48.420
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not in the books.</v>

2634
01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Like I have a joke about it in my act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was like,</v>

2635
01:48:50.881 --> 01:48:51.890
<v Speaker 1>if that was my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but be like,</v>

2636
01:48:51.930 --> 01:48:53.730
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be president.</v>

2637
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:55.350
<v Speaker 1>You can't stand up fast.</v>

2638
01:48:57.500 --> 01:48:58.860
<v Speaker 1>She can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

2639
01:48:59.030 --> 01:49:02.220
<v Speaker 1>If Hillary Clinton stood a Fascia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her eyes would roll back behind her head</v>

2640
01:49:02.221 --> 01:49:04.050
<v Speaker 1>and she'd fucking cracker head off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>linoleum.</v>

2641
01:49:04.380 --> 01:49:09.210
<v Speaker 1>That's just a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you say that you're a misogynist,</v>

2642
01:49:09.330 --> 01:49:11.070
<v Speaker 1>you're a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're all right.</v>

2643
01:49:11.071 --> 01:49:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I've been called alt right for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're helping.</v>

2644
01:49:13.531 --> 01:49:16.440
<v Speaker 1>You're helping Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're helping trump like this.</v>

2645
01:49:16.441 --> 01:49:17.274
<v Speaker 1>Seth rich thing is a real symptom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ignoring of that case is a real </v>

2646
01:49:21.991 --> 01:49:25.560
<v Speaker 1>symptom of what is wrong with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can even tribalism.</v>

2647
01:49:25.561 --> 01:49:26.620
<v Speaker 1>You can't discuss it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>List.</v>

2648
01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:28.350
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy that you're even talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

2649
01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:30.150
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that you talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>so openly.</v>

2650
01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:31.133
<v Speaker 1>What do people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't try to discredit you </v>

2651
01:49:32.191 --> 01:49:33.660
<v Speaker 1>because of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

2652
01:49:33.661 --> 01:49:34.760
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I do?</v>

2653
01:49:34.770 --> 01:49:36.150
<v Speaker 1>MMA cage fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Commentator.</v>

<v Speaker 1>By political ideologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm just</v>

<v Speaker 4>When it comes to politics,</v>

2660
01:49:50.801 --> 01:49:51.634
<v Speaker 4>I have my opinions on things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when it comes to things that are </v>

2661
01:49:53.171 --> 01:49:54.004
<v Speaker 4>rock solid and clear like that seth rich</v>
<v Speaker 4>was murdered and people want to ignore </v>

2662
01:49:57.281 --> 01:49:57.941
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2663
01:49:57.941 --> 01:50:01.810

<v Speaker 4>This has to be some sort of a disconnect</v>

2664
01:50:01.811 --> 01:50:02.644
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When a person is giving information to </v>

2665
01:50:04.961 --> 01:50:05.794
<v Speaker 4>Wiki leaks that exposes corruption </v>
<v Speaker 4>inside the very organization that's </v>

2666
01:50:09.191 --> 01:50:10.024
<v Speaker 4>responsible for the fucking Democratic </v>
<v Speaker 4>Party and he gets murdered and you're </v>

2667
01:50:13.691 --> 01:50:14.081
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>There's no conspiracy.</v>

2670

<v Speaker 4>It was a botched robbery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Says who says who wears this?</v>

<v Speaker 4>How come they didn't take his phone?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck are you talking about that</v>

2673
01:50:27.791 --> 01:50:30.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm a conspiracy theorist when I just </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell you the facts.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And this is where I leak any conspiracy </v>

2693
01:51:25.191 --> 01:51:26.024
<v Speaker 4>theories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the amount of people connected to </v>

2694
01:51:27.171 --> 01:51:29.390
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton Organization to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Clinton Foundation,</v>

2695
01:51:29.391 --> 01:51:30.224
<v Speaker 4>to Bill Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The amount of people that had been iced </v>

2696
01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:32.773
<v Speaker 4>is stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then some of them are bullshit and </v>

2697
01:51:34.641 --> 01:51:35.474
<v Speaker 4>coincidental and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people and they're in a weird job and </v>

2698
01:51:37.911 --> 01:51:38.744
<v Speaker 4>people get go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people that have been </v>

2699
01:51:39.891 --> 01:51:40.870
<v Speaker 4>killed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2700
01:51:41.450 --> 01:51:43.030
<v Speaker 3>but don't you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2701
01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:45.650
<v Speaker 3>what I love when they talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>uranium one story,</v>

2702
01:51:45.651 --> 01:51:47.190
<v Speaker 3>like it's debunked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2703
01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:48.073
<v Speaker 3>Bill Clinton got a half a million </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars put directly in his pocket from </v>

2704
01:51:50.301 --> 01:51:51.134
<v Speaker 3>a Kremlin bank directly and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>$142,000,000 float into the Clinton </v>

2705
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:56.743
<v Speaker 3>Foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was fun to punch a bunch of </v>

2706
01:51:57.381 --> 01:52:00.860
<v Speaker 3>motherfuckers surrounded a nuclear deal </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they wanted to do charity.</v>

2707
01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:02.510
<v Speaker 3>So what's the argument that it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>debunked?</v>

2708
01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:05.210
<v Speaker 3>They though they say they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

2709
01:52:05.211 --> 01:52:05.771
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

2710
01:52:05.771 --> 01:52:08.390
<v Speaker 3>She was only one of nine things that had</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sign off,</v>

2711
01:52:08.391 --> 01:52:11.630
<v Speaker 3>but there was all these other agencies I</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to sign off on it and this and that.</v>

2712
01:52:11.850 --> 01:52:14.760
<v Speaker 3>And it's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was all influenced by date.</v>

2713
01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:18.050
<v Speaker 3>Someone gave Clinton Foundation $142,</v>
<v Speaker 3>million dollars.</v>

2714
01:52:18.230 --> 01:52:19.063
<v Speaker 3>That's to buy influence and a half a </v>
<v Speaker 3>million dollars in the Bill Clinton's </v>

2715
01:52:21.831 --> 01:52:22.664
<v Speaker 3>pocket directly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because they like how he talks </v>

2716
01:52:24.051 --> 01:52:25.310
<v Speaker 3>pretty English in Russia.</v>

2717
01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:29.030
<v Speaker 3>Are you fucking kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that it's all bullshit.</v>

2718
01:52:29.031 --> 01:52:29.580
<v Speaker 3>So people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2719
01:52:29.580 --> 01:52:30.290
<v Speaker 3>it's the bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>NAFTA,</v>

2720
01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:31.123
<v Speaker 3>bunked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that fucking you tell me why they </v>

2721
01:52:32.841 --> 01:52:36.590
<v Speaker 3>gave $140 million dollars anonymously to</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fucking Clinton Foundation.</v>

2722
01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:39.080
<v Speaker 3>That is such bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are so corrupt.</v>

2723
01:52:39.170 --> 01:52:42.200
<v Speaker 3>If you believe trump is corrupt by doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>deals with oligarchs,</v>

2724
01:52:42.350 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 3>this is Dylan radigan talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll also have to believe that Hillary</v>

2725
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:46.843
<v Speaker 3>Clinton did arms deals around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country while personally enriching </v>

2726
01:52:48.201 --> 01:52:53.201
<v Speaker 3>herself and Barack Obama has paid off by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Wall Street and the health insurance</v>

2727
01:52:53.211 --> 01:52:54.044
<v Speaker 3>companies and big Pharma so we don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a functioning out of money sector </v>

2728
01:52:56.901 --> 01:52:59.900
<v Speaker 3>or the healthcare sector.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to believe one and not believe</v>

2729
01:52:59.901 --> 01:53:01.880
<v Speaker 3>the other two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what Dylan Radigan says,</v>

2730
01:53:01.881 --> 01:53:02.714
<v Speaker 3>and I believe that fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an award winning journalist and he </v>

2731
01:53:04.881 --> 01:53:06.350
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you believe trump is corrupt in this,</v>

2732
01:53:06.351 --> 01:53:07.184
<v Speaker 3>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's easy to believe it's all no </v>

2733
01:53:07.761 --> 01:53:09.560
<v Speaker 3>fucking bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you also have to believe this.</v>

2734
01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:10.940
<v Speaker 3>You have to believe Hillary Clinton did </v>
<v Speaker 3>arms.</v>

2735
01:53:10.941 --> 01:53:11.774
<v Speaker 3>Deals are all around the world and </v>
<v Speaker 3>enriching herself to the tunes of </v>

2736
01:53:13.521 --> 01:53:15.200
<v Speaker 3>millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same thing with Barack Obama.</v>

2737
01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:16.153
<v Speaker 3>You can't believe one and not the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my whole point is when people try to </v>

2738
01:53:18.891 --> 01:53:21.770
<v Speaker 3>pretend that trump is the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're missing the problem.</v>

2739
01:53:21.860 --> 01:53:22.693
<v Speaker 3>The problem is the neo liberal system </v>
<v Speaker 3>that gave us trump that renders 63 </v>

2740
01:53:25.821 --> 01:53:30.260
<v Speaker 3>percent of the population without funds </v>
<v Speaker 3>to handle a thousand dollar emergency in</v>

2741
01:53:30.261 --> 01:53:32.900
<v Speaker 3>the richest country in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem,</v>

2742
01:53:32.901 --> 01:53:34.760
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what people are.</v>

2743
01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:39.170
<v Speaker 3>If you think it's trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump is a symptom of a bigger problem.</v>

2744
01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:40.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think that guy wants to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>

2745
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:41.833
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't think he fucked up and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>running to the dog shit tires now and </v>

2746
01:53:51.321 --> 01:53:52.610
<v Speaker 2>people will taste like shit</v>

2747
01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:55.150
<v Speaker 3>will hate him so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to.</v>

2748
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:56.670
<v Speaker 3>They want to impeach him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2749
01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:59.900
<v Speaker 2>Favorite parts of the election process </v>
<v Speaker 2>was when he was saying,</v>

2750
01:54:00.170 --> 01:54:04.060
<v Speaker 2>I gave you money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave you my that.</v>

2751
01:54:04.250 --> 01:54:05.770
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my favorite part,</v>

2752
01:54:06.580 --> 01:54:08.240
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got it.</v>

2753
01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:11.240
<v Speaker 2>Who would have thought it would be trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking out?</v>

2754
01:54:11.241 --> 01:54:13.500
<v Speaker 2>These people know Eddie has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

2755
01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:16.810
<v Speaker 2>He did it when Obama was mocking him at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2756
01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:18.890
<v Speaker 2>A press junket thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that thing?</v>

2757
01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:20.780
<v Speaker 2>It was at the Gulf War correspondents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2758
01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:23.960
<v Speaker 2>The correspondence dinner when he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>mocking him and he said one thing that I</v>

2759
01:54:23.961 --> 01:54:26.210
<v Speaker 2>am that you'll never be president of </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States,</v>

2760
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:28.460
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you see trump's in there going,</v>

2761
01:54:28.461 --> 01:54:29.450
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother fucker.</v>

2762
01:54:29.670 --> 01:54:30.503
<v Speaker 2>And like that very well could have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>like he was talking about running for </v>

2763
01:54:34.191 --> 01:54:35.390
<v Speaker 2>president the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2764
01:54:35.450 --> 01:54:36.540
<v Speaker 2>But he never did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never did.</v>

2765
01:54:36.550 --> 01:54:39.320
<v Speaker 2>I thought about it in the 2004 election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never did.</v>

2766
01:54:39.590 --> 01:54:43.580
<v Speaker 2>But that fucking Straw snap and he did </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and we're on.</v>

2767
01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:46.500
<v Speaker 2>He did it and he always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always in a.</v>

2768
01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:47.533
<v Speaker 2>do you think that it's a good thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have someone that's fucked up is he is </v>

2769
01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:51.133
<v Speaker 2>like in terms of how we view a precedent</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of like all the grab them by </v>

2770
01:54:54.381 --> 01:54:55.214
<v Speaker 2>the Pussy and the paying off 100 women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all the crazy shit and all the </v>

2771
01:54:59.301 --> 01:55:01.550
<v Speaker 2>lies like he gets caught in lies all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2772
01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:02.510
<v Speaker 2>And what's worse,</v>

2773
01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:04.873
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grab them by the Pussy or Barack Obama </v>

2774
01:55:07.341 --> 01:55:09.410
<v Speaker 3>says I'm going to fix everything for </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2775
01:55:09.411 --> 01:55:11.180
<v Speaker 3>And then he kicked your family Outta </v>
<v Speaker 3>your house.</v>

2776
01:55:11.181 --> 01:55:12.014
<v Speaker 3>Five point 1 million families out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their house while making Wall Street </v>

2777
01:55:13.911 --> 01:55:14.744
<v Speaker 3>whole and then when he leaves then he </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes back into public life after </v>

2778
01:55:17.181 --> 01:55:18.014
<v Speaker 3>retiring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing he does is give half a </v>

2779
01:55:19.390 --> 01:55:22.550
<v Speaker 3>million dollar speeches to banks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucking tell me what's worse.</v>

2780
01:55:22.730 --> 01:55:24.230
<v Speaker 3>Is that what he's doing now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he did.</v>

2781
01:55:24.231 --> 01:55:25.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he first,</v>

2782
01:55:25.221 --> 01:55:26.054
<v Speaker 3>when he works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went wind surfing with Branson and </v>

2783
01:55:28.041 --> 01:55:28.874
<v Speaker 3>then he came back and he gave speeches </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the Carlyle group and some other </v>

2784
01:55:30.771 --> 01:55:34.430
<v Speaker 3>people I had half a million bucks a </v>
<v Speaker 3>crack and Chris Hedges says,</v>

2785
01:55:34.431 --> 01:55:35.264
<v Speaker 3>which is why I love Chris Hedges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a guy who told the truth about </v>

2786
01:55:37.071 --> 01:55:39.340
<v Speaker 3>the Iraq war and the New York Times </v>
<v Speaker 3>fired him for it,</v>

2787
01:55:40.730 --> 01:55:43.500
<v Speaker 3>which is why the New York Times and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't fucking believe that you listen to</v>

2788
01:55:43.501 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 3>these male</v>

2789
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:46.050
<v Speaker 1>establishment newspapers where they talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about war.</v>

2790
01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2791
01:55:47.790 --> 01:55:49.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I fucking forgot what I was saying.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And that's what that is.</v>

2795
01:55:57.420 --> 01:55:58.253
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the funniest things </v>

2796
01:55:58.771 --> 01:56:00.510
<v Speaker 1>about the Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton debates.</v>

<v Speaker 1>600,000 dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to hear what you had to say.</v>

2800
01:56:07.810 --> 01:56:08.643
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

2804
01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:18.960
<v Speaker 1>that we nominate the most repulsive Neil</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liberal,</v>

2805
01:56:18.970 --> 01:56:21.780
<v Speaker 1>corporatists warmonger and the history </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Democratic Party,</v>

2806
01:56:21.870 --> 01:56:26.330
<v Speaker 1>the most unpopular nominee ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She loses to a fucking game show hosts.</v>

2807
01:56:26.331 --> 01:56:28.740
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even want to be president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what do we do?</v>

2808
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:33.830
<v Speaker 1>We blame another country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talk about not wanting to examine the</v>

2809
01:56:36.211 --> 01:56:37.044
<v Speaker 1>system that gave us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They taught and that's all they'll talk </v>

2810
01:56:38.701 --> 01:56:42.030
<v Speaker 1>about is blaming another country and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the big news of the week that we</v>

2811
01:56:42.031 --> 01:56:47.031
<v Speaker 1>really concentrate on his hair flopping </v>
<v Speaker 1>off in the breeze in France.</v>

2812
01:56:47.090 --> 01:56:49.260
<v Speaker 1>That's hair opens up and you see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back of his head.</v>

2813
01:56:49.330 --> 01:56:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a video on that bucket.</v>

2814
01:56:50.910 --> 01:56:53.160
<v Speaker 1>The comb over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that column over.</v>

2815
01:56:53.161 --> 01:56:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right there.</v>

2816
01:56:54.810 --> 01:56:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't new,</v>

2817
01:56:56.180 --> 01:57:00.750
<v Speaker 1>but it was dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was dramatic the way it blew open and</v>

2818
01:57:00.751 --> 01:57:03.840
<v Speaker 1>was like a wing opened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like.</v>

2819
01:57:04.410 --> 01:57:07.170
<v Speaker 1>It was like you seeing something you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not supposed to say yes.</v>

2820
01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Like up a skirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like his head had an ass.</v>

2821
01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard that.</v>

2822
01:57:12.331 --> 01:57:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Someone say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2823
01:57:13.530 --> 01:57:14.670
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of looking at it.</v>

2824
01:57:14.670 --> 01:57:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Like this is his head was mooning us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2825
01:57:17.321 --> 01:57:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a.</v>

2826
01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:19.583
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to mistake everything </v>

2827
01:57:20.581 --> 01:57:22.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying for defending trump and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's he shaved his head.</v>

2828
01:57:23.670 --> 01:57:25.500
<v Speaker 1>Take it from a guy who's got his head </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaved Donald.</v>

2829
01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long ago did you shave your head?</v>

2830
01:57:27.121 --> 01:57:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't ever remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're having.</v>

2831
01:57:28.650 --> 01:57:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever just like you in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>

2832
01:57:30.810 --> 01:57:35.460
<v Speaker 1>2011 maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like when I met you in 2004,</v>

2833
01:57:35.461 --> 01:57:36.294
<v Speaker 1>whenever that was I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just remember you being bald and even </v>

2834
01:57:39.811 --> 01:57:41.640
<v Speaker 1>though you weren't obviously now in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

2835
01:57:41.670 --> 01:57:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>memories do too.</v>

2836
01:57:43.081 --> 01:57:45.000
<v Speaker 1>I look at pictures of me from Fairfax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2837
01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:48.500
<v Speaker 1>oh my hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember you ever having hanging</v>

2838
01:57:48.501 --> 01:57:50.760
<v Speaker 1>on though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We started those guys who can pull it.</v>

2839
01:57:50.761 --> 01:57:51.780
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't pull it off.</v>

2840
01:57:51.810 --> 01:57:52.643
<v Speaker 1>You could pull it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you couldn't until you do </v>

2841
01:57:54.751 --> 01:57:54.930
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2842
01:57:54.930 --> 01:57:57.240
<v Speaker 1>And then you realize it sometimes can do</v>
<v Speaker 1>gray hair too.</v>

2843
01:57:57.241 --> 01:57:59.910
<v Speaker 1>I can't do greg fucking really can't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2844
01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:03.480
<v Speaker 1>I have to dye my hair all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you let your hair go gray,</v>

2845
01:58:03.481 --> 01:58:04.980
<v Speaker 1>you have that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>to die and I don't need to be </v>

01:58:16.561 --> 01:58:17.394
<v Speaker 1>distinguished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want everyone to think I'm the Jerry </v>

2852
01:58:20.340 --> 01:58:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Seinfeld when he was getting an award,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fun of the Guy Getting an award.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think about the </v>

2859
01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Washington Post is owned by Jeff Bezos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the richest guy in the world.</v>

2860
01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Hanni.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating,</v>

2861
01:58:38.730 --> 01:58:42.100
<v Speaker 1>and he sits on a Pentagon board and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>has 100 million dollar deal</v>

2862
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:44.190
<v Speaker 2>with the CIA and he runs the paper up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No wait,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Million dollar deal with the CIA.</v>

2865
01:58:47.001 --> 01:58:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is like something on Amazon.</v>

2866
01:58:49.301 --> 01:58:51.280
<v Speaker 2>Alexis Dillon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's on Alexis.</v>

2867
01:58:51.281 --> 01:58:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Just gathering up information on </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything you do.</v>

2868
01:58:53.950 --> 01:58:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is fucking shit out of me.</v>

2869
01:58:56.351 --> 01:58:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2870
01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.630
<v Speaker 2>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie and I were just talking about that</v>

2871
01:58:58.631 --> 01:59:01.510
<v Speaker 2>new apple home thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has the most amazing microphones.</v>

2872
01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Jamie was saying that while the music is</v>
<v Speaker 2>blaring,</v>

2873
01:59:03.851 --> 01:59:04.840
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Siri.</v>

2874
01:59:05.020 --> 01:59:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was real quiet.</v>

2875
01:59:06.101 --> 01:59:06.934
<v Speaker 2>Hey Siri,</v>
<v Speaker 2>punch.</v>

2876
01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:08.770
<v Speaker 2>Suck my Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seriously,</v>

2877
01:59:08.771 --> 01:59:09.604
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Details about the CIA's deal with </v>

2878
01:59:12.641 --> 01:59:16.240
<v Speaker 2>Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>$600,000,000 computing cloud built by an</v>

2879
01:59:16.241 --> 01:59:17.074
<v Speaker 2>outside company is a radical departure </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the risk averse intelligence </v>

2880
01:59:19.991 --> 01:59:20.824
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now they're in bed with the </v>

2881
01:59:22.870 --> 01:59:26.530
<v Speaker 2>Washington Post or Jeff Bezos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he also sits on a Pentagon board.</v>

2882
01:59:26.650 --> 01:59:27.483
<v Speaker 2>He's got so much money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fascinating to me because like </v>

2883
01:59:29.891 --> 01:59:30.490
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2884
01:59:30.490 --> 01:59:33.340
<v Speaker 2>How do you keep going when you have 105 </v>
<v Speaker 2>billion?</v>

2885
01:59:33.341 --> 01:59:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Like what's getting you up in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning?</v>

2886
01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:36.340
<v Speaker 2>So he's a megalomaniac,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2887
01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:40.840
<v Speaker 2>How do you accumulate more wealth than </v>
<v Speaker 2>any person in the history of the world?</v>

2888
01:59:40.841 --> 01:59:42.430
<v Speaker 2>That means kings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Queens.</v>

2889
01:59:42.490 --> 01:59:43.323
<v Speaker 2>That's not necessarily true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why is we don't count the </v>

2890
01:59:46.271 --> 01:59:48.820
<v Speaker 2>same kind of money that the oligarchs </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

2891
01:59:48.850 --> 01:59:51.190
<v Speaker 2>Like especially people that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

2892
01:59:51.191 --> 01:59:52.024
<v Speaker 2>people have said that it's very possible</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Putin is the richest man alive </v>

2893
01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:55.473
<v Speaker 2>because they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not counting how much money </v>

2894
01:59:56.531 --> 01:59:57.364
<v Speaker 2>Putin is stolen from all the various </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies that he's just sort of </v>

2895
01:59:59.681 --> 02:00:01.870
<v Speaker 2>absorbed and that he owns all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

2896
02:00:02.140 --> 02:00:07.140
<v Speaker 2>but also we don't count all these kings </v>
<v Speaker 2>and princes in the Middle East.</v>

2897
02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:11.170
<v Speaker 2>They're not publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not public people,</v>

2898
02:00:11.260 --> 02:00:12.250
<v Speaker 2>Telco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2899
02:00:12.330 --> 02:00:14.140
<v Speaker 2>so let's say of all the people we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>count,</v>

2900
02:00:14.141 --> 02:00:14.974
<v Speaker 2>he's the richest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A billionaire friend of mine who's a </v>

2901
02:00:17.531 --> 02:00:21.280
<v Speaker 2>legitimate billionaire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>told me that it's entirely possible that</v>

2902
02:00:21.281 --> 02:00:22.720
<v Speaker 2>some of these guys are trillionaires.</v>

2903
02:00:22.930 --> 02:00:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Some of these Middle Eastern guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2904
02:00:24.670 --> 02:00:29.670
<v Speaker 2>you've never seen wealth like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane in do you know in the United</v>

2905
02:00:29.890 --> 02:00:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Arab Emirates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make it rain every week,</v>

2906
02:00:32.260 --> 02:00:33.093
<v Speaker 2>once a week they make it rain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they see the clouds really get </v>

2907
02:00:36.671 --> 02:00:37.361
<v Speaker 2>rain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2908
02:00:37.361 --> 02:00:38.560
<v Speaker 2>because they're in the desert and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2909
02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like this like a drain.</v>

2910
02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:44.050
<v Speaker 2>So they fucking put all that shit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to put into the sky to make it</v>

2911
02:00:44.051 --> 02:00:45.580
<v Speaker 2>rain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they've been doing forever.</v>

2912
02:00:45.581 --> 02:00:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Cloud seeding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but insanely expensive.</v>

2913
02:00:47.711 --> 02:00:51.550
<v Speaker 2>But they do it once a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so 52 times a year at range there.</v>

2914
02:00:51.670 --> 02:00:52.503
<v Speaker 2>So what do you see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see a problem with the richest guy </v>

2915
02:00:54.281 --> 02:00:55.114
<v Speaker 2>in the world owning the political paper </v>
<v Speaker 2>of note and being in bed with the CIA </v>

2916
02:00:59.470 --> 02:01:01.550
<v Speaker 2>and he's on a Pentagon board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2917
02:01:01.570 --> 02:01:04.150
<v Speaker 2>it's all spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like some kind of Orwellian fucking</v>

2918
02:01:04.151 --> 02:01:04.670
<v Speaker 2>nightmare.</v>

2919
02:01:04.670 --> 02:01:07.810
<v Speaker 2>We got so much money and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticize him in the paper.</v>

2920
02:01:07.870 --> 02:01:08.703
<v Speaker 2>They won't let you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people who write for that paper </v>

2921
02:01:10.181 --> 02:01:13.270
<v Speaker 2>aren't going great session and post duct</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't write anything bad about it.</v>

2922
02:01:13.271 --> 02:01:14.104
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't imagine they would even </v>

2923
02:01:15.191 --> 02:01:17.770
<v Speaker 2>dare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One guy wrote something bad about Amazon</v>

2924
02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:20.230
<v Speaker 2>and the Huffington Post.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got disciplined.</v>

2925
02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:22.510
<v Speaker 2>There was a guy who was a writer for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington Post,</v>

2926
02:01:22.690 --> 02:01:23.523
<v Speaker 2>wrote something in the Huffington Post </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was critical of Amazon and he got </v>

2927
02:01:26.921 --> 02:01:29.020
<v Speaker 2>disciplined at the Washington Post for </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>

2928
02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:30.213
<v Speaker 2>So that's the world we live in and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have the government and if you ever </v>

2929
02:01:33.131 --> 02:01:35.050
<v Speaker 2>try to tell about a crime inside the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

2930
02:01:35.051 --> 02:01:37.300
<v Speaker 2>then the government would use the </v>
<v Speaker 2>espionage act to correct on you.</v>

2931
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:39.440
<v Speaker 2>So we're again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're living in an oligarchy joe.</v>

2932
02:01:39.441 --> 02:01:40.120
<v Speaker 2>We are d</v>

2933
02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:41.990
<v Speaker 1>democracy has already been taken from </v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

2934
02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:45.110
<v Speaker 1>So you know that this isn't a democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've done studies.</v>

2935
02:01:45.111 --> 02:01:45.944
<v Speaker 1>This is provable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was the thing about from the Huffington </v>

2936
02:01:48.441 --> 02:01:51.110
<v Speaker 1>post to derail us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but was it valid?</v>

2937
02:01:51.140 --> 02:01:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Was it a valid criticism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't about.</v>

2938
02:01:53.810 --> 02:01:56.600
<v Speaker 1>He criticized about how Jeff Bezos </v>
<v Speaker 1>treats his workers.</v>

2939
02:01:56.670 --> 02:01:57.503
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2940
02:01:57.630 --> 02:02:01.620
<v Speaker 4>That has been an open area of discussion</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they like.</v>

2941
02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:04.590
<v Speaker 4>I've talked to someone who actually work</v>
<v Speaker 4>there and they were saying that they get</v>

2942
02:02:04.591 --> 02:02:06.930
<v Speaker 4>like a countdown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So say an order comes in,</v>

2943
02:02:06.931 --> 02:02:10.470
<v Speaker 4>they literally have like a countdown on </v>
<v Speaker 4>their tablet when the countdown says,</v>

2944
02:02:10.471 --> 02:02:11.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2945
02:02:11.050 --> 02:02:12.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the net amount of time</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

2946
02:02:12.390 --> 02:02:13.223
<v Speaker 4>but you have to run and find that </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking product and get it into the box </v>

2947
02:02:15.361 --> 02:02:18.120
<v Speaker 4>and get it shipped out inside a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>small window of time.</v>

2948
02:02:18.121 --> 02:02:19.920
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm literally running.</v>

2949
02:02:20.670 --> 02:02:21.690
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you run?</v>

2950
02:02:21.870 --> 02:02:22.441
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2951
02:02:22.441 --> 02:02:25.640
<v Speaker 4>you literally run because if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>meet your countdown,</v>

2952
02:02:25.650 --> 02:02:26.483
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could only get away with that for a </v>

2953
02:02:27.811 --> 02:02:29.730
<v Speaker 4>certain amount of times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you get in real trouble.</v>

2954
02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:32.400
<v Speaker 1>So they also have these new things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the risks,</v>

2955
02:02:32.401 --> 02:02:34.990
<v Speaker 1>the bands that they developed a shock </v>
<v Speaker 1>you or shock,</v>

2956
02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:36.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will you serious?</v>

2957
02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:39.010
<v Speaker 1>I was joking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tell you,</v>

2958
02:02:39.750 --> 02:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>they just fucking shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll pull it up.</v>

2959
02:02:42.130 --> 02:02:43.380
<v Speaker 1>They've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll vibrate.</v>

2960
02:02:43.470 --> 02:02:44.460
<v Speaker 1>And if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

2961
02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:47.080
<v Speaker 1>if you're moving the wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll shock you back.</v>

2962
02:02:47.310 --> 02:02:49.140
<v Speaker 1>It'll shock you back to the requisite </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt.</v>

2963
02:02:49.141 --> 02:02:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Or is it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever been to her new Cadillac,</v>

2964
02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:53.100
<v Speaker 1>new cadillacs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

2965
02:02:53.130 --> 02:02:56.310
<v Speaker 1>if you go too close to the side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you like zip,</v>

2966
02:02:56.311 --> 02:02:56.581
<v Speaker 1>zip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zip,</v>

2967
02:02:56.581 --> 02:02:57.414
<v Speaker 1>zip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zip gives like a little feeling Amazon </v>

2968
02:02:59.490 --> 02:03:04.320
<v Speaker 1>wristbands designed to track and </v>
<v Speaker 1>employee's movements.</v>

2969
02:03:05.130 --> 02:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>So Jeff Bezos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been reported it,</v>

2970
02:03:07.470 --> 02:03:09.910
<v Speaker 1>which is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that he would rather,</v>

2971
02:03:09.911 --> 02:03:13.260
<v Speaker 1>it's not running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>run my shit that day.</v>

2972
02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:15.053
<v Speaker 1>So now there's plenty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple different fixes for </v>

2973
02:03:16.981 --> 02:03:18.800
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem of robots,</v>

2974
02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:22.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them would be a unions,</v>

2975
02:03:22.350 --> 02:03:22.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2976
02:03:22.650 --> 02:03:26.730
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole thing is why can't we unionize?</v>

2977
02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't we use a Nice Walmart?</v>

2978
02:03:28.561 --> 02:03:29.394
<v Speaker 1>I know they make it hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walmart literally shut down their </v>

2979
02:03:31.321 --> 02:03:33.990
<v Speaker 1>meatpacking in Texas because of the meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>packing group.</v>

2980
02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:36.240
<v Speaker 1>They unionized in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fuck it.</v>

2981
02:03:36.241 --> 02:03:37.800
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to sell meat anymore in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>

2982
02:03:37.801 --> 02:03:39.960
<v Speaker 1>That's how we'll fuck over the union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2983
02:03:39.961 --> 02:03:41.850
<v Speaker 1>but we got to figure out a way to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>unions in there.</v>

2984
02:03:41.851 --> 02:03:42.750
<v Speaker 1>There's another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2985
02:03:42.780 --> 02:03:45.210
<v Speaker 1>Teddy Roosevelt was a trust buster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a,</v>

2986
02:03:45.220 --> 02:03:47.010
<v Speaker 1>he was a monopoly buster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2987
02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:50.820
<v Speaker 1>50 percent of all online purchases go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through Amazon.com in the United States.</v>

2988
02:03:50.821 --> 02:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Fifty percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2989
02:03:52.740 --> 02:03:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Fifty one percent of households in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America have Amazon prime.</v>

2990
02:03:55.861 --> 02:03:56.694
<v Speaker 1>Only 49 percent have a landline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so more people at Amazon prime in the </v>

2991
02:04:00.330 --> 02:04:01.470
<v Speaker 1>United States then have fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>landline.</v>

2992
02:04:01.740 --> 02:04:02.573
<v Speaker 1>So what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real Teddy Roosevelt would come along </v>

2993
02:04:07.801 --> 02:04:09.210
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to break this company up.</v>

2994
02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would say,</v>

2995
02:04:10.501 --> 02:04:12.030
<v Speaker 1>this is a first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2996
02:04:12.210 --> 02:04:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Bezos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he owns the paper,</v>

2997
02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:15.900
<v Speaker 1>he got the trump was right when he said </v>
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>

2998
02:04:15.930 --> 02:04:16.763
<v Speaker 1>He's there to get the texts in his favor</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was able to go around and </v>

2999
02:04:19.981 --> 02:04:20.814
<v Speaker 1>hollow out economies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mainstreet little small towns all </v>

3000
02:04:22.861 --> 02:04:25.170
<v Speaker 1>around because he didn't have to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes,</v>

3001
02:04:25.230 --> 02:04:29.700
<v Speaker 1>the income tax and for Amazon and so the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brick and mortar places did.</v>

3002
02:04:29.730 --> 02:04:31.830
<v Speaker 1>He closed them down by undercutting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

3003
02:04:31.831 --> 02:04:34.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he and now he's opening up brick</v>

3004
02:04:34.141 --> 02:04:34.974
<v Speaker 1>and mortar stores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He closed out all the barnes and nobles </v>

3005
02:04:36.391 --> 02:04:39.060
<v Speaker 1>and borders books and now he's opening </v>
<v Speaker 1>up Amazon bookstores.</v>

3006
02:04:39.061 --> 02:04:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3007
02:04:41.300 --> 02:04:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Amazon 64,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>

3008
02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:44.850
<v Speaker 1>64.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

3009
02:04:45.790 --> 02:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Even up higher than than from when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked.</v>

3010
02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:49.110
<v Speaker 1>They have Amazon prime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

3011
02:04:49.111 --> 02:04:51.420
<v Speaker 1>How many of those people use it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>television?</v>

3012
02:04:51.421 --> 02:04:52.254
<v Speaker 1>This is my question because I know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon started to make apparently some </v>

3013
02:04:55.531 --> 02:04:56.364
<v Speaker 1>very good shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't hear anybody talking about </v>

3014
02:04:58.651 --> 02:05:01.140
<v Speaker 1>watching them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like apparently billy Bob Thornton has a</v>

3015
02:05:01.141 --> 02:05:04.680
<v Speaker 1>really good show on Amazon and I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was that,</v>

3016
02:05:04.930 --> 02:05:07.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey tambor show that got tanked.</v>

3017
02:05:08.170 --> 02:05:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting me too.</v>

3018
02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:11.580
<v Speaker 1>Story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Jeffrey Tambor,</v>

3019
02:05:11.581 --> 02:05:12.414
<v Speaker 1>one of the guys he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's playing a transvestite transgender </v>

3020
02:05:15.980 --> 02:05:17.110
<v Speaker 1>person and</v>

3021
02:05:17.340 --> 02:05:18.173
<v Speaker 4>there was people and he's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>transgender and there's people on the </v>

3022
02:05:20.011 --> 02:05:23.280
<v Speaker 4>show apparently that were very upset </v>
<v Speaker 4>that a transgender,</v>

3023
02:05:23.310 --> 02:05:26.310
<v Speaker 4>a non transgender person was playing a </v>
<v Speaker 4>transgender person will.</v>

3024
02:05:26.311 --> 02:05:27.420
<v Speaker 4>It's acting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3025
02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:30.360
<v Speaker 4>Well they didn't like that and this,</v>

3026
02:05:30.980 --> 02:05:35.750
<v Speaker 1>a lot of internal dispute because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3027
02:05:36.050 --> 02:05:38.420
<v Speaker 1>which may or may not have led to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>accusations.</v>

3028
02:05:38.810 --> 02:05:39.643
<v Speaker 1>I used to be much harder job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to be harder on it on </v>

3029
02:05:42.021 --> 02:05:44.210
<v Speaker 1>transgender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I say harder on transgender,</v>

3030
02:05:44.211 --> 02:05:44.991
<v Speaker 1>I mean a boner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3031
02:05:44.991 --> 02:05:47.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to make.</v>

3032
02:05:47.570 --> 02:05:49.820
<v Speaker 1>I used to make jokes about them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand.</v>

3033
02:05:50.150 --> 02:05:51.470
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand that was a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3034
02:05:51.471 --> 02:05:53.480
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just guys fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>having fun,</v>

3035
02:05:53.820 --> 02:05:54.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3036
02:05:54.450 --> 02:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>some of them we all like to fucking feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little weird or whatever.</v>

3037
02:05:58.100 --> 02:06:00.020
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3038
02:06:00.860 --> 02:06:01.693
<v Speaker 1>I don't go out in public and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I realized this is the actual </v>

3039
02:06:04.461 --> 02:06:06.500
<v Speaker 1>thing with a lot of people that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually born.</v>

3040
02:06:06.501 --> 02:06:08.570
<v Speaker 1>They have the different feeling than </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're outside.</v>

3041
02:06:08.900 --> 02:06:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Then I realized it was a thing and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>now I don't do that anymore.</v>

3042
02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:12.850
<v Speaker 1>It's gender</v>

3043
02:06:12.850 --> 02:06:14.060
<v Speaker 4>Morphea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3044
02:06:14.610 --> 02:06:15.560
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

3045
02:06:15.590 --> 02:06:16.423
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely people that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>issues in their mind where they wish </v>

3046
02:06:19.071 --> 02:06:20.660
<v Speaker 4>that they were a different thing than </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they are.</v>

3047
02:06:21.020 --> 02:06:21.853
<v Speaker 4>I think the thing that concerns me more </v>
<v Speaker 4>about transgender people than anything </v>

3048
02:06:25.310 --> 02:06:30.080
<v Speaker 4>is this acceptance of using hormone </v>
<v Speaker 4>blockers for young children.</v>

3049
02:06:30.380 --> 02:06:31.213
<v Speaker 4>And I just think that is fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is something that the liberal </v>

3050
02:06:33.801 --> 02:06:35.260
<v Speaker 4>progressives are pushing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Edit,</v>

3051
02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:37.820
<v Speaker 4>alarming rate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a terrifying idea.</v>

3052
02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:38.990
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3053
02:06:39.740 --> 02:06:40.573
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's plenty of discussion about this </v>

3054
02:06:42.351 --> 02:06:44.750
<v Speaker 4>online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's plenty of people that think that</v>

3055
02:06:44.840 --> 02:06:48.110
<v Speaker 4>age six is a fine year to start this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3056
02:06:48.290 --> 02:06:49.123
<v Speaker 4>We've talked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've had people on the podcast who </v>

3057
02:06:50.151 --> 02:06:51.780
<v Speaker 4>infiltrated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3058
02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:52.410
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3059
02:06:52.410 --> 02:06:55.010
<v Speaker 4>this transgender group and we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about their kid,</v>

3060
02:06:55.011 --> 02:06:55.844
<v Speaker 4>their kid identifies with the girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the kid is six is two years too </v>

3061

<v Speaker 4>young to start and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that is,</v>

3062

3063
02:07:02.900 --> 02:07:03.471
<v Speaker 4>They were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3064
02:07:03.471 --> 02:07:04.304
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3065
02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:05.473
<v Speaker 4>studies show that that's a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just horse shitting and want </v>

3066
02:07:08.151 --> 02:07:10.280
<v Speaker 4>more people to do it so that they feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

3067

<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>good thing to be married because when </v>

3077
02:07:40.151 --> 02:07:40.984
<v Speaker 2>you're married you have to answer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone that someone tells you what to </v>

3078
02:07:42.971 --> 02:07:43.720
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3079
02:07:43.720 --> 02:07:44.553
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was telling me that his wife calls </v>

3080
02:07:45.551 --> 02:07:47.110
<v Speaker 2>him a fucking asshole and it makes him </v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

3081
02:07:47.111 --> 02:07:48.190
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3082
02:07:48.250 --> 02:07:49.900
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friends don't call me an asshole.</v>

3083
02:07:50.010 --> 02:07:50.771
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless I'm.</v>

3084
02:07:50.771 --> 02:07:51.604
<v Speaker 2>And if I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If one of my friends calls me a fucking </v>

3085
02:07:52.931 --> 02:07:55.030
<v Speaker 2>asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a huge mistake.</v>

3086
02:07:55.060 --> 02:07:57.690
<v Speaker 2>It's like living in married to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>football coach who wants that?</v>

3087
02:07:58.070 --> 02:07:58.903
<v Speaker 2>Who wants to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could throw in buckets of gatorade </v>

3088
02:08:00.321 --> 02:08:02.710
<v Speaker 2>on your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the whole thing was ridiculous,</v>

3089
02:08:02.711 --> 02:08:06.040
<v Speaker 2>but it was literally a misery loves </v>
<v Speaker 2>company thing that happens.</v>

3090
02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:09.520
<v Speaker 2>So people who are married want you to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>married to.</v>

3091
02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:10.533
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm not saying that's absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with people who are </v>

3092
02:08:12.971 --> 02:08:16.210
<v Speaker 2>transgender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're most certainly in support of</v>

3093
02:08:16.211 --> 02:08:17.044
<v Speaker 2>more people doing it and I don't know if</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is why they would lean towards </v>

3094
02:08:20.681 --> 02:08:23.830
<v Speaker 2>having six year olds take hormone </v>
<v Speaker 2>blockers.</v>

3095
02:08:24.070 --> 02:08:27.350
<v Speaker 2>But if you criticize that in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were thought to be transphobic,</v>

3096
02:08:27.370 --> 02:08:28.203
<v Speaker 2>and this is a real issue today where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people bring this up over and over </v>

3097
02:08:31.301 --> 02:08:34.420
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why anyone would think that</v>

3098
02:08:34.421 --> 02:08:38.290
<v Speaker 2>it's a good idea to take a six year old </v>
<v Speaker 2>and put them on hormone blockers,</v>

3099
02:08:38.291 --> 02:08:40.870
<v Speaker 2>but they don't know what the fuck is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on with the world.</v>

3100
02:08:40.990 --> 02:08:41.823
<v Speaker 2>Their body is changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going through all this growth </v>

3101
02:08:43.691 --> 02:08:44.524
<v Speaker 2>and development,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for you to chemically hijack that </v>

3102
02:08:46.541 --> 02:08:51.490
<v Speaker 2>for an ideology seems to me as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>outsider to be fucking insane,</v>

3103
02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:52.893
<v Speaker 2>but to talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you run the risk of being thought of as </v>

3104
02:08:55.721 --> 02:08:56.554
<v Speaker 2>being transphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very strange time to discuss </v>

3105
02:08:59.891 --> 02:09:02.860
<v Speaker 2>things because you can't have an opinion</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it because,</v>

3106
02:09:02.890 --> 02:09:05.680
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a CIS gendered white man with all</v>

3107
02:09:05.681 --> 02:09:07.410
<v Speaker 2>sorts of privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at you.</v>

3108
02:09:07.411 --> 02:09:08.800
<v Speaker 2>You Macho piece of shit.</v>

3109
02:09:08.830 --> 02:09:11.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like to say you're mansplaining.</v>

3110
02:09:11.711 --> 02:09:12.940
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3111
02:09:12.941 --> 02:09:13.774
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a guy and I have an opinion so I'm </v>

3112
02:09:14.981 --> 02:09:16.720
<v Speaker 2>not allowed to have that opinion ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3113
02:09:16.721 --> 02:09:17.554
<v Speaker 2>I understand there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a time and a place to say </v>

3114
02:09:19.571 --> 02:09:20.710
<v Speaker 2>mansplaining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3115
02:09:21.130 --> 02:09:21.963
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's find a place to say that </v>

3116
02:09:24.311 --> 02:09:26.890
<v Speaker 2>someone is talking down to people just </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to be a man.</v>

3117
02:09:26.891 --> 02:09:27.724
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem with the term </v>

3118
02:09:28.841 --> 02:09:29.674
<v Speaker 2>mansplaining is that man is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a woman is saying something that's </v>

3119
02:09:34.331 --> 02:09:36.010
<v Speaker 2>incorrect in a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct sir?</v>

3120
02:09:36.011 --> 02:09:37.780
<v Speaker 2>He's mansplaining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3121
02:09:37.781 --> 02:09:38.614
<v Speaker 2>Well that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what it's saying too often </v>

3122
02:09:41.291 --> 02:09:42.640
<v Speaker 2>it's turned into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like I said,</v>

3123
02:09:42.641 --> 02:09:43.570
<v Speaker 2>the Hashtag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me Too.</v>

3124
02:09:43.571 --> 02:09:45.610
<v Speaker 2>We're all against sexual harassment at </v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

3125
02:09:45.611 --> 02:09:46.444
<v Speaker 2>but we're not for puritanism exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's when people hijacking certain </v>

3126
02:09:49.691 --> 02:09:51.350
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that what we're going,</v>

3127
02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:55.600
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with Hashtag me too and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of things in this society is we're</v>

3128
02:09:55.601 --> 02:10:00.601
<v Speaker 2>undergoing a radical cultural change and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's brought about by information.</v>

3129
02:10:01.090 --> 02:10:04.390
<v Speaker 2>I think we're way more aware of each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other's feelings,</v>

3130
02:10:04.570 --> 02:10:05.403
<v Speaker 2>way more aware of what's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way more aware of what we're willing to </v>

3131
02:10:08.081 --> 02:10:09.640
<v Speaker 2>tolerate and what we're not willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tolerate.</v>

3132
02:10:09.870 --> 02:10:13.450
<v Speaker 2>And if you go back to the 19 thirties in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 19 forties and watch old films where</v>

3133
02:10:13.451 --> 02:10:14.284
<v Speaker 2>people would smack the shit out of women</v>
<v Speaker 2>and rape them and do all kinds of crazy </v>

3134
02:10:17.141 --> 02:10:18.730
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was thought to be normal.</v>

3135
02:10:18.731 --> 02:10:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Those are the heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

3136
02:10:20.290 --> 02:10:22.380
<v Speaker 2>that a woman?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3137
02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:24.450
<v Speaker 2>John Wayne would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember what he uh,</v>

3138
02:10:24.500 --> 02:10:25.750
<v Speaker 2>how about uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's the guy,</v>

3139
02:10:25.751 --> 02:10:26.584
<v Speaker 2>I forget his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he took the grapefruit right in her </v>

3142
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:32.980
<v Speaker 2>Was that I'm John Waner was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the short.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3144

3158
02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:08.680
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of an asshole thing to say.</v>

3159
02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:09.890
<v Speaker 6>Say that one you like better.</v>

3160
02:11:12.540 --> 02:11:14.840
<v Speaker 2>So she says that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he takes the group great,</v>

3161
02:11:14.850 --> 02:11:16.170
<v Speaker 2>great food right in their face.</v>

3162
02:11:19.550 --> 02:11:20.480
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is kind of a beat.</v>

3163
02:11:20.510 --> 02:11:23.030
<v Speaker 2>That's a dick move back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so ruthless.</v>

3164
02:11:23.031 --> 02:11:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Fucking seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horrible.</v>

3165
02:11:25.230 --> 02:11:27.440
<v Speaker 2>I'll try to do that today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you know,</v>

3166
02:11:27.441 --> 02:11:32.240
<v Speaker 2>have some name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy who's a Ryan Geisler,</v>

3167
02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:35.270
<v Speaker 2>one of those guys when I'm handsome </v>
<v Speaker 2>fellows,</v>

3168
02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:39.500
<v Speaker 2>do it to some beautiful young girl who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good stone.</v>

3169
02:11:39.610 --> 02:11:41.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about that sucks.</v>

3170
02:11:41.530 --> 02:11:44.600
<v Speaker 2>Like grapefruit interface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pupil fuck movie is.</v>

3171
02:11:44.610 --> 02:11:48.620
<v Speaker 2>And she just kind of cried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't even react with that.</v>

3172
02:11:48.621 --> 02:11:50.270
<v Speaker 2>Men beat the fuck out of women back </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

3173
02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:51.470
<v Speaker 2>It was normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3174
02:11:51.740 --> 02:11:56.290
<v Speaker 2>That's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think what those things represent.</v>

3175
02:11:56.300 --> 02:11:57.500
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it's fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3176
02:11:57.650 --> 02:11:58.483
<v Speaker 2>But what it also represents is what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptable culturally to witness in a </v>

3177
02:12:03.261 --> 02:12:06.500
<v Speaker 2>film that is not acceptable culturally </v>
<v Speaker 2>to witness in a film now,</v>

3178
02:12:06.501 --> 02:12:09.020
<v Speaker 2>especially from the fucking hero of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

3179
02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:14.950
<v Speaker 2>I think today we're more aware than ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>before of of how people feel,</v>

3180
02:12:16.521 --> 02:12:18.080
<v Speaker 2>of how people think of what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptable,</v>

3181
02:12:18.081 --> 02:12:18.914
<v Speaker 2>what's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what was wrong with the way people </v>

3182
02:12:20.091 --> 02:12:20.924
<v Speaker 2>used to behave.</v>

3183
02:12:21.050 --> 02:12:21.883
<v Speaker 2>Whereas it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were operating on momentum and the </v>

3184
02:12:23.601 --> 02:12:25.850
<v Speaker 2>thirties and forties and fifties and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties and seventies.</v>

3185
02:12:26.090 --> 02:12:26.923
<v Speaker 2>The Internet came along and people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>just sharing information of this </v>

3186
02:12:29.211 --> 02:12:31.640
<v Speaker 2>unprecedented pace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3187
02:12:31.730 --> 02:12:32.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3188
02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:35.300
<v Speaker 2>I just found out about John Lennon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about him?</v>

3189
02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:39.530
<v Speaker 2>That he admitted to beating his girls?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Girlfriends.</v>

3190
02:12:39.630 --> 02:12:40.463
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you meet her at Yoko Ono sing you </v>

3191
02:12:42.651 --> 02:12:45.410
<v Speaker 2>gotta you gotta give him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut him a break.</v>

3192
02:12:45.470 --> 02:12:47.510
<v Speaker 2>But it was when I was younger and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

3193
02:12:47.511 --> 02:12:49.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to make up for the things.</v>

3194
02:12:49.161 --> 02:12:51.170
<v Speaker 2>I can't deny what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to make up for it.</v>

3195
02:12:51.380 --> 02:12:52.061
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

3196
02:12:52.061 --> 02:12:55.160
<v Speaker 2>And you don't want to hear that right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Data about Hendrix to know.</v>

3197
02:12:55.190 --> 02:12:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3198
02:12:55.820 --> 02:12:57.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if he could find that dude.</v>

3199
02:12:57.291 --> 02:13:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Hendrick Hendrick story is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>disturbing because Hendrix might've been</v>

3200
02:13:00.381 --> 02:13:01.214
<v Speaker 2>murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very possible that really is </v>

3201
02:13:02.660 --> 02:13:03.493
<v Speaker 2>murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to imagine John Lennon </v>

3202
02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:06.680
<v Speaker 2>beat women and children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just a fact beat.</v>

3203
02:13:06.710 --> 02:13:09.110
<v Speaker 2>Children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who did he what children?</v>

3204
02:13:09.530 --> 02:13:10.363
<v Speaker 2>Terrible things the famous asshole did </v>
<v Speaker 2>during his life have written by a woman </v>

<v Speaker 2>Hashtag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me Too.</v>

3206
02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a different time.</v>

3207
02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:19.393
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet a lot of people did terrible </v>

3208
02:13:20.481 --> 02:13:22.910
<v Speaker 2>things back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess he wasn't one of his kids.</v>

3209
02:13:22.911 --> 02:13:24.650
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't nice to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget which one,</v>

3210
02:13:24.651 --> 02:13:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Julian or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

3211
02:13:26.610 --> 02:13:27.500
<v Speaker 2>it's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

3212
02:13:27.501 --> 02:13:29.090
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3213
02:13:29.091 --> 02:13:31.530
<v Speaker 2>Steve Martin's Dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might give a read his book talks about</v>

3214
02:13:31.531 --> 02:13:32.364
<v Speaker 2>how his dad hit him a little too hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>one time when they were never friends </v>

3215
02:13:34.261 --> 02:13:35.540
<v Speaker 2>after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

3216
02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:38.250
<v Speaker 2>And did you get hit as a kid growing up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3217
02:13:38.820 --> 02:13:41.760
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get your mother got hit.</v>

3218
02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:42.771
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3219
02:13:42.771 --> 02:13:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mother got hit by my dad,</v>

3220
02:13:44.281 --> 02:13:45.990
<v Speaker 2>but then she left my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3221
02:13:45.991 --> 02:13:47.970
<v Speaker 2>your dad didn't hit you completely made </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

3222
02:13:47.971 --> 02:13:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Hendrix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australian girlfriend.</v>

3223
02:13:49.601 --> 02:13:51.960
<v Speaker 2>Savages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Film which shows rockstar beating up</v>

3224
02:13:51.961 --> 02:13:53.580
<v Speaker 2>her character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3225
02:13:53.581 --> 02:13:54.750
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3226
02:13:54.780 --> 02:13:57.570
<v Speaker 2>all my sides and accuracy has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticized by Hendrix.</v>

3227
02:13:57.571 --> 02:13:59.060
<v Speaker 2>His friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his former girlfriend,</v>

3228
02:13:59.100 --> 02:13:59.933
<v Speaker 2>disgusted by scenes depicting domestic </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence never consulted her about </v>

3229
02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:04.140
<v Speaker 2>portrayal.</v>

3230
02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:05.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that might not be true.</v>

3231
02:14:05.550 --> 02:14:06.460
<v Speaker 2>But there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3232
02:14:06.810 --> 02:14:08.070
<v Speaker 2>there was another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3233
02:14:08.190 --> 02:14:09.023
<v Speaker 2>someone had said that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation where Jimmy was in the other </v>

3234
02:14:11.851 --> 02:14:12.684
<v Speaker 2>room and he hit his girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like someone was talking about it from </v>

3235
02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:19.020
<v Speaker 2>first person perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that was the girlfriend.</v>

3236
02:14:19.380 --> 02:14:20.213
<v Speaker 2>The fascinating thing about Jimmy was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he had this gangster manager who </v>

3237
02:14:23.521 --> 02:14:24.354
<v Speaker 2>had him kidnapped his manager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had him kidnapped so that he could </v>

3238
02:14:27.151 --> 02:14:27.984
<v Speaker 2>release him so that he could rescue him </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that he can keep Jimmy on as a </v>

3239
02:14:31.261 --> 02:14:33.560
<v Speaker 2>client.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is all a.</v>

3240
02:14:33.570 --> 02:14:37.590
<v Speaker 2>That came from a really recent book that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was one of the gangster guys,</v>

3241
02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:38.633
<v Speaker 2>bodyguards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of the people that worked for </v>

3242
02:14:39.921 --> 02:14:41.610
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So very fascinating.</v>

3243
02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:44.460
<v Speaker 2>So he was afraid that Jimmy was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get rid of him as a manager.</v>

3244
02:14:44.461 --> 02:14:48.060
<v Speaker 2>So he engineered a kidnapping that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>could solve,</v>

3245
02:14:48.061 --> 02:14:50.850
<v Speaker 2>that Jimmy would feel indebted and bring</v>
<v Speaker 2>them on as his manager.</v>

3246
02:14:50.910 --> 02:14:51.743
<v Speaker 2>And this guy who wrote this book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much of this is real </v>

3247
02:14:53.491 --> 02:14:54.324
<v Speaker 2>and how much of it's bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but thinks that they murdered Jimi </v>

3248
02:14:56.670 --> 02:14:59.070
<v Speaker 2>Hendrix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then right after that,</v>

3249
02:14:59.130 --> 02:15:02.010
<v Speaker 2>the girlfriend of Jimi Hendrix was </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrown off of a roof.</v>

3250
02:15:02.490 --> 02:15:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

3251
02:15:03.421 --> 02:15:05.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said she committed suicide.</v>

3252
02:15:05.221 --> 02:15:08.700
<v Speaker 2>But he says they threw her off a roof </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she knew about Jimmy's murder.</v>

3253
02:15:09.180 --> 02:15:10.090
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh?</v>

3254
02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:11.310
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

3255
02:15:11.490 --> 02:15:12.720
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A stranger.</v>

3256
02:15:12.721 --> 02:15:14.060
<v Speaker 2>Things have happened in that job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3257
02:15:14.070 --> 02:15:16.830
<v Speaker 2>that whole business in many ways look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>should night,</v>

3258
02:15:16.890 --> 02:15:17.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That whole business,</v>

3259
02:15:17.971 --> 02:15:21.570
<v Speaker 2>the music business has been run by </v>
<v Speaker 2>gangsters for a long fucking time.</v>

3260
02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Look it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phil Spector,</v>

3261
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:24.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy who was shot,</v>

3262
02:15:24.331 --> 02:15:25.164
<v Speaker 2>that woman in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he used to put guns in people's </v>

3263
02:15:27.181 --> 02:15:31.320
<v Speaker 2>mouths all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That business was run by gangsters ever.</v>

3264
02:15:31.740 --> 02:15:34.950
<v Speaker 2>So the idea of Jimi Hendrix manager </v>
<v Speaker 2>being a gangster,</v>

3265
02:15:34.951 --> 02:15:36.990
<v Speaker 2>it's not outside the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility.</v>

3266
02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:40.740
<v Speaker 2>You go back to the Ciro's nightclub days</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's the comedy store is today.</v>

3267
02:15:41.010 --> 02:15:44.840
<v Speaker 2>That was run by Bugsy Siegel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a fucking gangster joint with.</v>

3268
02:15:44.841 --> 02:15:45.674
<v Speaker 2>That's where they had musicians play and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin </v>

3269
02:15:48.991 --> 02:15:50.670
<v Speaker 2>Plate there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean really?</v>

3270
02:15:50.700 --> 02:15:51.533
<v Speaker 2>That was run by fucking murderers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the one reason why everybody </v>

3271
02:15:55.111 --> 02:15:57.210
<v Speaker 2>was willing to believe the comedy store </v>
<v Speaker 2>was haunted.</v>

3272
02:15:57.450 --> 02:15:58.283
<v Speaker 2>If you look at like the haunted no </v>
<v Speaker 2>dictionary of like places or the </v>

3273
02:16:01.470 --> 02:16:02.303
<v Speaker 2>directory of places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the comedy store's like one of the top </v>

3274
02:16:04.051 --> 02:16:05.760
<v Speaker 2>places on the list in Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

3275
02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:08.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure it's not a club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the fucking main room,</v>

3276
02:16:08.251 --> 02:16:09.570
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I prefer them there.</v>

3277
02:16:09.870 --> 02:16:10.703
<v Speaker 2>I'm going there tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be standing right there with that </v>

3278
02:16:12.451 --> 02:16:13.920
<v Speaker 2>guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3279
02:16:13.980 --> 02:16:18.980
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy that the store is essentially</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same fucking place as it was then.</v>

3280
02:16:19.260 --> 02:16:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3283
02:16:23.131 --> 02:16:24.990
<v Speaker 2>place and there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the front door.</v>

02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:26.840
<v Speaker 2>How Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That looks isn't amazing.</v>

3285
02:16:26.841 --> 02:16:28.680

<v Speaker 2>That's really dark and evil.</v>

02:17:16.820 --> 02:17:18.280
<v Speaker 2>That's Dean Martin writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Martin.</v>

3307
02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Dean Martin looked weird too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a weird angle.</v>

3308
02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:22.433
<v Speaker 2>Is probably hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't keep his eyes open like I </v>

3309
02:17:24.611 --> 02:17:27.150
<v Speaker 2>always wanted to be those guys like I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to be Dean Martin.</v>

3310
02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:30.230
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be the rat pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be a dreamy.</v>

3311
02:17:30.610 --> 02:17:31.443
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dory Leo.</v>

3312
02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:33.090
<v Speaker 2>You have a good chance of being Jimmy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dore.</v>

3313
02:17:35.310 --> 02:17:38.140
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to find out who that guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3314
02:17:38.141 --> 02:17:39.460
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're on the outside,</v>

3315
02:17:39.730 --> 02:17:41.640
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's a kid right now listening </v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

3316
02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:42.810
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Dore.</v>

3317
02:17:43.160 --> 02:17:43.993
<v Speaker 2>I want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know who the fuck you </v>

3318
02:17:45.581 --> 02:17:47.220
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you don't.</v>

3319
02:17:47.350 --> 02:17:48.940
<v Speaker 2>I will put you here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever thought about this?</v>

3320
02:17:48.941 --> 02:17:49.774
<v Speaker 2>I've thought about it like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if somebody would have whispered in my </v>

3321
02:17:51.671 --> 02:17:53.740
<v Speaker 2>ear when I was 18 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how you.</v>

3322
02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:56.230
<v Speaker 2>I had a lot of anxiety as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what am I gonna do with my life?</v>

3323
02:17:56.770 --> 02:17:57.603
<v Speaker 2>I had no role models to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in this blue collar </v>

3324
02:17:59.531 --> 02:18:00.700
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to do anything.</v>

3325
02:18:00.750 --> 02:18:02.290
<v Speaker 2>Anybody fucking did there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me Too.</v>

3326
02:18:02.380 --> 02:18:03.460
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same Story.</v>

3327
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:04.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

3328
02:18:04.541 --> 02:18:05.500
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you become a comment.</v>

3329
02:18:05.550 --> 02:18:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's how I became a comic and I,</v>

3330
02:18:08.890 --> 02:18:10.870
<v Speaker 2>if somebody would have whispered in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>ear when I was younger,</v>

3331
02:18:10.871 --> 02:18:11.440
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3332
02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:12.273
<v Speaker 2>this is how it's gonna work out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have been a lot more relaxed and </v>

3333
02:18:14.270 --> 02:18:15.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you would have made it.</v>

3334
02:18:15.430 --> 02:18:16.550
<v Speaker 2>Probably would need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3335
02:18:16.551 --> 02:18:18.730
<v Speaker 2>you had that anxiety is important that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the heart,</v>

3336
02:18:18.740 --> 02:18:19.573
<v Speaker 2>the horrible feeling of insecurity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all pans out because that makes you </v>

3337
02:18:22.421 --> 02:18:24.610
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't want to be comfortable.</v>

3338
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:27.820
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that I'd like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

3339
02:18:27.821 --> 02:18:28.654
<v Speaker 2>Things that I'm not good at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the reasons why I like to </v>

3340
02:18:31.031 --> 02:18:33.700
<v Speaker 2>do yoga is one of the reasons why I like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to run hills.</v>

3341
02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:34.713
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why I like to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like archery and bow hunting and </v>

3342
02:18:37.691 --> 02:18:39.640
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking hard to do so.</v>

3343
02:18:39.641 --> 02:18:40.900
<v Speaker 2>It's humbling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu.</v>

3344
02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:43.780
<v Speaker 2>It's very humbling and in doing these </v>
<v Speaker 2>humbling things,</v>

3345
02:18:43.990 --> 02:18:47.080
<v Speaker 2>you're always insecure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're always struggling.</v>

3346
02:18:47.260 --> 02:18:50.110
<v Speaker 2>You have to somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly be in a state of struggle,</v>

3347
02:18:50.111 --> 02:18:52.570
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean you have to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a state of sugar all day,</v>

3348
02:18:52.930 --> 02:18:53.763
<v Speaker 2>all your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to understand what that </v>

3349
02:18:54.851 --> 02:18:57.520
<v Speaker 2>feeling is because that feeling is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>only way you progress.</v>

3350
02:18:57.580 --> 02:19:00.040
<v Speaker 2>It's the only way you advance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the only way you get better things.</v>

3351
02:19:00.050 --> 02:19:02.230
<v Speaker 2>You get better at yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get better at life.</v>

3352
02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:04.900
<v Speaker 2>You have to go through that all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3353
02:19:04.901 --> 02:19:07.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a muscle that has to constantly be </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercised.</v>

3354
02:19:07.330 --> 02:19:09.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're talking about doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>standup,</v>

3355
02:19:09.701 --> 02:19:11.620
<v Speaker 2>like Jerry Seinfeld saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take four days off.</v>

3356
02:19:11.860 --> 02:19:13.060
<v Speaker 2>You feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take five days off.</v>

3357
02:19:13.061 --> 02:19:14.100
<v Speaker 2>People know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3358
02:19:14.230 --> 02:19:15.063
<v Speaker 2>That's the same thing with struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to constantly be engaged in </v>

3359
02:19:18.581 --> 02:19:21.520
<v Speaker 2>improvement and trying to figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to improve things.</v>

3360
02:19:21.700 --> 02:19:25.090
<v Speaker 2>That's how you advance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you advance technique.</v>

3361
02:19:25.210 --> 02:19:28.130
<v Speaker 2>That's how you advance thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I advanced ideas</v>

3362
02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:29.780
<v Speaker 1>and bits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they progress.</v>

3363
02:19:30.580 --> 02:19:31.413
<v Speaker 1>You have to feel that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable feeling that everybody </v>

3364
02:19:33.081 --> 02:19:35.790
<v Speaker 1>wants to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to feel comfortable with</v>

3365
02:19:35.930 --> 02:19:37.310
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I was on the road,</v>

3366
02:19:37.311 --> 02:19:38.144
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were talking about how putting </v>

3367
02:19:38.751 --> 02:19:40.580
<v Speaker 1>together your next special and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do it,</v>

3368
02:19:40.850 --> 02:19:42.950
<v Speaker 1>terrified and all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to go through.</v>

3369
02:19:43.460 --> 02:19:43.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3370
02:19:43.780 --> 02:19:46.790
<v Speaker 1>when I was on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember like even in in El Paso,</v>

3371
02:19:46.791 --> 02:19:47.624
<v Speaker 1>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be working and I would do two shows </v>

3372
02:19:48.951 --> 02:19:49.784
<v Speaker 1>and I would go home after afterwards she</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a condo and I would listen to both </v>

3373
02:19:53.031 --> 02:19:55.890
<v Speaker 1>shows before I went to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3374
02:19:55.940 --> 02:19:58.070
<v Speaker 1>now I know most guys didn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3375
02:19:58.071 --> 02:20:01.400
<v Speaker 1>but I just had to do it and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like I was embarrassed to let the</v>

3376
02:20:01.401 --> 02:20:02.111
<v Speaker 1>other comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3377
02:20:02.111 --> 02:20:04.730
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to my set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like,</v>

3378
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.660
<v Speaker 1>just like that.</v>

3379
02:20:05.660 --> 02:20:08.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be stuck here,</v>

3380
02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:11.420
<v Speaker 1>I want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some place I want to be and I got</v>

3381
02:20:11.430 --> 02:20:13.520
<v Speaker 1>to get there and if this helps me get </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

3382
02:20:13.521 --> 02:20:14.354
<v Speaker 1>I want to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to figure out what the fuck I </v>

3383
02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:17.150
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I get to be like that guy?</v>

3384
02:20:17.330 --> 02:20:20.240
<v Speaker 1>How do I get to be like Jerry Seinfeld?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be like Brian Regan,</v>

3385
02:20:20.330 --> 02:20:22.820
<v Speaker 1>how do I get to be like those people I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be like,</v>

3386
02:20:23.150 --> 02:20:25.600
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just studied them and I just.</v>

3387
02:20:25.730 --> 02:20:26.563
<v Speaker 1>So it's that whole thing of you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a desire to be somewhere that </v>

3388
02:20:28.881 --> 02:20:30.520
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3389
02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.890
<v Speaker 1>well that's one way to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for me,</v>

3390
02:20:33.950 --> 02:20:34.361
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3391
02:20:34.361 --> 02:20:37.790
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that takes care of itself if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you continue to improve.</v>

3392
02:20:38.090 --> 02:20:41.510
<v Speaker 1>So my thought has always been on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing itself,</v>

3393
02:20:41.690 --> 02:20:43.250
<v Speaker 1>like the craft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bits,</v>

3394
02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:44.113
<v Speaker 1>the chunks and there's some material </v>
<v Speaker 1>from my past I'm embarrassed as fuck </v>

3395
02:20:47.121 --> 02:20:47.720
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

3396
02:20:47.720 --> 02:20:48.553
<v Speaker 1>I can't go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I go on youtube and I see some </v>

3397
02:20:49.791 --> 02:20:54.530
<v Speaker 1>old thing from 1999 or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>let's fucking death,</v>

3398
02:20:54.531 --> 02:20:56.870
<v Speaker 1>I can't look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>

3399
02:20:57.250 --> 02:21:00.350
<v Speaker 1>what I'm concerned with is like what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing right now,</v>

3400
02:21:00.380 --> 02:21:03.020
<v Speaker 1>how do I get that better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I tighten that up?</v>

3401
02:21:03.500 --> 02:21:07.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking one day I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>perform at this place and then I'll have</v>

3402
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:08.840
<v Speaker 1>truly made it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a trap.</v>

3403
02:21:09.380 --> 02:21:12.320
<v Speaker 1>But what's not a trap is making the work</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

3404
02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Like constantly improving the work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And since I've been focusing on that,</v>

3405
02:21:17.301 --> 02:21:19.760
<v Speaker 1>the more I focused on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better my act has got.</v>

3406
02:21:19.790 --> 02:21:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

3407
02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:22.850
<v Speaker 1>You're right about that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trap.</v>

3408
02:21:23.630 --> 02:21:24.463
<v Speaker 1>Because um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why do you think it's a trap when </v>

3409
02:21:26.511 --> 02:21:26.841
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3410
02:21:26.841 --> 02:21:27.674
<v Speaker 1>I want to play theaters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still use somewhere else with </v>

3411
02:21:29.391 --> 02:21:30.224
<v Speaker 1>that same stupid and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then still bugs you and you think </v>

3412
02:21:32.961 --> 02:21:34.130
<v Speaker 1>everything's going to be different.</v>

3413
02:21:34.130 --> 02:21:34.940
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3414
02:21:34.940 --> 02:21:35.773
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and why I think fucks people up when </v>

3415
02:21:37.041 --> 02:21:38.030
<v Speaker 1>they make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're like,</v>

3416
02:21:38.031 --> 02:21:41.480
<v Speaker 1>I feel exactly the same and if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what to do with them.</v>

3417
02:21:41.481 --> 02:21:46.070
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of guy where I got right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like oh I can do whatever I want,</v>

3418
02:21:46.071 --> 02:21:46.904
<v Speaker 1>go wherever I want to see the and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>still feel the same and that's when I </v>

3419
02:21:50.151 --> 02:21:50.984
<v Speaker 1>started listening to Eckhart totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I started to try to be present and </v>

3420
02:21:52.911 --> 02:21:57.500
<v Speaker 1>try to learn how to enjoy the moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and in the doing right.</v>

3421
02:21:57.501 --> 02:21:58.334
<v Speaker 1>So when I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I realized also is that </v>

3422
02:21:59.781 --> 02:22:00.614
<v Speaker 1>when I'm onstage stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never more present than when I'm on </v>

3423
02:22:04.341 --> 02:22:05.750
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I am,</v>

3424
02:22:05.830 --> 02:22:09.470
<v Speaker 1>that whatever that magic is to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>present it and it gives you.</v>

3425
02:22:09.471 --> 02:22:10.304
<v Speaker 1>It's like when people say they meditate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have energy after I have so much </v>

3426
02:22:12.411 --> 02:22:13.244
<v Speaker 1>energy after I get off stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's a shitty show because I'm </v>

3427
02:22:16.970 --> 02:22:17.803
<v Speaker 1>just being present the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking about my bills or what </v>

3428
02:22:19.881 --> 02:22:20.714
<v Speaker 1>happened yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking about right this </v>

3429
02:22:21.891 --> 02:22:25.620
<v Speaker 1>fucking moment and it fuels me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I just want to go.</v>

3430
02:22:25.860 --> 02:22:26.100
<v Speaker 1>I want</v>

3431
02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:27.930
<v Speaker 2>to figure out how I could go back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>being a comedian.</v>

3432
02:22:28.110 --> 02:22:28.943
<v Speaker 2>Well you can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you definitely did it the other </v>

3433
02:22:30.271 --> 02:22:30.981
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah.</v>

3434
02:22:30.981 --> 02:22:32.310
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just got to do it more.</v>

3435
02:22:32.430 --> 02:22:35.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm just pushing my song man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing myself to get out there more and</v>

3436
02:22:35.390 --> 02:22:36.223
<v Speaker 2>it happens to people when they get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>television show and it happened to me </v>

3437
02:22:38.941 --> 02:22:39.774
<v Speaker 2>when I got news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing very little comedy and I </v>

3438
02:22:42.151 --> 02:22:44.460
<v Speaker 2>wasn't writing it all and my aunt </v>
<v Speaker 2>started to suck.</v>

3439
02:22:44.730 --> 02:22:47.520
<v Speaker 2>I was having this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the same old stupid act and I had</v>

3440
02:22:47.521 --> 02:22:48.354
<v Speaker 2>for years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a period of like two years </v>

3441
02:22:49.741 --> 02:22:51.330
<v Speaker 2>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write a fucking single joke.</v>

3442
02:22:51.331 --> 02:22:52.164
<v Speaker 2>I would just go up and do the same set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't doing any TV sets and I just </v>

3443
02:22:55.171 --> 02:22:56.004
<v Speaker 2>kept bombing and one time I bombed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of some writers was radio and I </v>

3444
02:22:59.071 --> 02:23:00.340
<v Speaker 2>realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

3445
02:23:00.500 --> 02:23:01.333
<v Speaker 2>I have to get back to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I really started dedicating </v>

3446
02:23:03.871 --> 02:23:05.730
<v Speaker 2>myself and really started paying </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention again.</v>

3447
02:23:05.730 --> 02:23:10.730
<v Speaker 2>I bought a recorder so I can record all </v>
<v Speaker 2>my sets are even installed a dat machine</v>

3448
02:23:11.131 --> 02:23:11.964
<v Speaker 2>at the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bought it really stalled and stalled </v>

3449
02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:15.300
<v Speaker 2>and stalled microphones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3450
02:23:15.540 --> 02:23:16.373
<v Speaker 2>I changed the microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought a whole new sound system for </v>

3451
02:23:18.151 --> 02:23:18.984
<v Speaker 2>the comedy store so I could start </v>
<v Speaker 2>recording my sets and listening to all </v>

3452
02:23:21.751 --> 02:23:23.010
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic.</v>

3453
02:23:24.340 --> 02:23:27.090
<v Speaker 2>And now I just use my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>iphone.</v>

3454
02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:30.600
<v Speaker 2>So amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But kind of fucking,</v>

3455
02:23:30.640 --> 02:23:33.570
<v Speaker 2>you got to be concentrating on the work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing,</v>

3456
02:23:33.571 --> 02:23:34.404
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the more you concentrate on getting </v>

3457
02:23:35.731 --> 02:23:36.564
<v Speaker 2>it better and the more you tighten it up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where the real happiness in </v>

3458
02:23:40.321 --> 02:23:42.480
<v Speaker 2>performing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is doing a great job.</v>

3459
02:23:42.600 --> 02:23:45.640
<v Speaker 2>It's not in like the places that you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still get nervous like if uh,</v>

3460
02:23:45.641 --> 02:23:47.460
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some places they'll get nervous,</v>

3461
02:23:47.820 --> 02:23:50.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I did the theater at Madison Square</v>

3462
02:23:50.870 --> 02:23:51.750
<v Speaker 2>Garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That made me nervous.</v>

3463
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:52.561
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

3464
02:23:52.561 --> 02:23:53.394
<v Speaker 2>I'm performing at the fucking garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then after the show was over I was </v>

3465
02:23:55.681 --> 02:23:56.850
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that was a show.</v>

3466
02:23:57.430 --> 02:23:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Normal shelves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

3467
02:23:58.650 --> 02:23:59.970
<v Speaker 2>Everything was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went well,</v>

3468
02:24:00.210 --> 02:24:01.043
<v Speaker 2>but it was fucking weird man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're just mind fucking </v>

3469
02:24:03.301 --> 02:24:05.260
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same jokes as people,</v>

3470
02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:06.533
<v Speaker 2>just a different venue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I used to work this club in Chicago </v>

3471
02:24:08.131 --> 02:24:11.670
<v Speaker 2>called the funny firm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a 400 seat room right downtown</v>

3472
02:24:11.671 --> 02:24:12.504
<v Speaker 2>Chicago was great room around the corner</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the Improv and they made it really </v>

3473
02:24:16.111 --> 02:24:20.420
<v Speaker 2>hard to play the Improv if you lived in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicago and so I remember I had a got a,</v>

3474
02:24:20.421 --> 02:24:23.700
<v Speaker 2>got a shot to to do a set there and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was freaked out.</v>

3475
02:24:23.701 --> 02:24:27.690
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a good set and I can't so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much pressure.</v>

3476
02:24:28.140 --> 02:24:30.870
<v Speaker 2>I cave off and my friend Steve Siegrist </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

3477
02:24:30.871 --> 02:24:31.704
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same fucking people that are </v>

3478
02:24:32.761 --> 02:24:33.350
<v Speaker 2>around the corner.</v>

3479
02:24:33.350 --> 02:24:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're right here.</v>

3480
02:24:34.231 --> 02:24:37.680
<v Speaker 2>It's the same fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know he's right.</v>

3481
02:24:37.740 --> 02:24:39.330
<v Speaker 2>I know he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3482
02:24:39.331 --> 02:24:40.164
<v Speaker 2>but I still fall into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you went up a week later you'd </v>

3483
02:24:43.231 --> 02:24:44.070
<v Speaker 2>probably be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3484
02:24:44.071 --> 02:24:46.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just more often it's against.</v>

3485
02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:47.393
<v Speaker 2>It's the newness of the situation until </v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel like that's the problem with </v>

3486
02:24:49.381 --> 02:24:51.660
<v Speaker 2>filming a special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you film a special,</v>

3487
02:24:51.661 --> 02:24:52.381
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here it is,</v>

3488
02:24:52.381 --> 02:24:54.150
<v Speaker 2>ready go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The camera's on.</v>

3489
02:24:54.151 --> 02:24:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get right.</v>

3490
02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:57.730
<v Speaker 2>Got To be relaxed and be normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have one chair,</v>

3491
02:24:57.760 --> 02:24:59.910
<v Speaker 2>when I did my hour special for comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>central,</v>

3492
02:25:00.060 --> 02:25:02.070
<v Speaker 2>I thought we'd shoot too and then we put</v>
<v Speaker 2>it together,</v>

3493
02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:03.313
<v Speaker 2>but for whatever reason we only had </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough money to shoot one and I was </v>

3494
02:25:05.101 --> 02:25:06.420
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I should for.</v>

3495
02:25:06.810 --> 02:25:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I could have used the first one.</v>

3496
02:25:09.541 --> 02:25:11.340
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I knew I had four barrels.</v>

3497
02:25:11.700 --> 02:25:14.730
<v Speaker 2>I knew I had four shots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did it before what I had to.</v>

3498
02:25:14.731 --> 02:25:16.170
<v Speaker 2>I did Denver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to.</v>

3499
02:25:16.350 --> 02:25:19.020
<v Speaker 2>And the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lady heckled me and I was like,</v>

3500
02:25:19.080 --> 02:25:20.260
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3501
02:25:21.700 --> 02:25:22.830
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>

3502
02:25:24.130 --> 02:25:25.300
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3503
02:25:25.330 --> 02:25:28.190
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got have four and four.</v>

3504
02:25:28.300 --> 02:25:31.090
<v Speaker 2>I was relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I did the fillmore in San Francisco</v>

3505
02:25:31.091 --> 02:25:33.190
<v Speaker 2>for my last one and it felt like regular</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>

3506
02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:34.570
<v Speaker 2>It was normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great place.</v>

3507
02:25:34.680 --> 02:25:35.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I did.</v>

3508
02:25:35.351 --> 02:25:37.700
<v Speaker 2>My hour specials at the fillmore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where does a really great place?</v>

3509
02:25:37.780 --> 02:25:38.613
<v Speaker 2>Place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd done that place before I was </v>

3510
02:25:40.661 --> 02:25:41.980
<v Speaker 2>comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love San Francisco.</v>

3511
02:25:41.981 --> 02:25:45.250
<v Speaker 2>I worked there all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so everything just set right in.</v>

3512
02:25:45.251 --> 02:25:48.700
<v Speaker 2>But I knew I had four shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel like too many people put too</v>

3513
02:25:48.701 --> 02:25:49.534
<v Speaker 2>much pressure on themselves to do one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I always remember about Hicks when </v>

3514
02:25:52.031 --> 02:25:52.990
<v Speaker 2>Hicks did relentless.</v>

3515
02:25:52.990 --> 02:25:57.340
<v Speaker 2>He didn't in the UK and he did one big </v>
<v Speaker 2>show and it just was flat.</v>

3516
02:25:57.850 --> 02:26:00.500
<v Speaker 2>It just seemed flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't seem loose.</v>

3517
02:26:00.540 --> 02:26:01.373
<v Speaker 2>The wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like he was just going through </v>

3518
02:26:02.801 --> 02:26:05.200
<v Speaker 2>these motions that he had done before </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were funny,</v>

3519
02:26:05.201 --> 02:26:06.034
<v Speaker 2>but he wasn't connected to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could feel the tension of doing one </v>

3520
02:26:08.801 --> 02:26:10.330
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had seen him many,</v>

3521
02:26:10.331 --> 02:26:11.164
<v Speaker 2>many times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember I watched it with this </v>

3522
02:26:12.311 --> 02:26:15.700
<v Speaker 2>girl that I was dating and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's really interesting,</v>

3523
02:26:15.701 --> 02:26:17.710
<v Speaker 2>but he's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what she said.</v>

3524
02:26:18.170 --> 02:26:19.090
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn Bitch,</v>

3525
02:26:19.130 --> 02:26:20.110
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3526
02:26:20.111 --> 02:26:21.820
<v Speaker 2>it's tough debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you know that.</v>

3527
02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:26.470
<v Speaker 2>How about you shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You grab a great proofreader.</v>

3528
02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:29.470
<v Speaker 2>Faith no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Kiwi.</v>

3529
02:26:29.590 --> 02:26:30.423
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always thought it was that Bill Hicks </v>

3530
02:26:33.550 --> 02:26:34.383
<v Speaker 2>hit it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to capture someone on film as </v>

3531
02:26:37.211 --> 02:26:38.860
<v Speaker 2>a standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to capture that.</v>

3532
02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:40.990
<v Speaker 2>Like Dennis Miller is black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

3533
02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:43.090
<v Speaker 2>I think the greatest example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>capturing that.</v>

3534
02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:45.250
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just thought it was like,</v>

3535
02:26:45.251 --> 02:26:46.084
<v Speaker 2>well bill is funny in person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't transfer to tv that well </v>

3536
02:26:48.461 --> 02:26:49.294
<v Speaker 2>because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his specialist didn't come anywhere </v>

3537
02:26:50.381 --> 02:26:51.910
<v Speaker 2>close to being a funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't,</v>

3538
02:26:52.450 --> 02:26:54.550
<v Speaker 2>he just never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never got it right.</v>

3539
02:26:54.551 --> 02:26:56.440
<v Speaker 2>I think they needed to get him at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>club.</v>

3540
02:26:56.660 --> 02:26:57.550
<v Speaker 2>Said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3541
02:26:57.551 --> 02:27:00.010
<v Speaker 2>you ever see St Mastache that captured </v>
<v Speaker 2>him?</v>

3542
02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3543
02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:03.790
<v Speaker 2>They did that at the Houston laugh stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did himself.</v>

3544
02:27:03.820 --> 02:27:04.870
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that's.</v>

3545
02:27:05.350 --> 02:27:07.630
<v Speaker 2>But when you do that then you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting,</v>

3546
02:27:07.631 --> 02:27:09.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of different sets.</v>

3547
02:27:09.161 --> 02:27:10.690
<v Speaker 2>You find the right one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

3548
02:27:10.780 --> 02:27:13.240
<v Speaker 2>And you do it at a comedy club where </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's comfortable.</v>

3549
02:27:13.660 --> 02:27:16.950
<v Speaker 2>I think more people should do sets a </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy clubs and,</v>

3550
02:27:17.090 --> 02:27:17.923
<v Speaker 2>and film specials at comedy clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a couple of different theories </v>

3551
02:27:20.351 --> 02:27:20.800
<v Speaker 2>for why.</v>

3552
02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:22.420
<v Speaker 2>But one of the big ones is when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>at home,</v>

3553
02:27:22.421 --> 02:27:23.950
<v Speaker 2>you're in a living room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's intimate.</v>

3554
02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Your want your couch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>TV is just right there.</v>

3555
02:27:26.501 --> 02:27:29.440
<v Speaker 2>It's not fucking a million miles away on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a giant big ass screen.</v>

3556
02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:33.140
<v Speaker 2>So it feels weird to watch something on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3557
02:27:33.190 --> 02:27:34.023
<v Speaker 2>the big ass giant place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>50,000 people that Kevin Hart did is </v>

3558
02:27:37.121 --> 02:27:38.840
<v Speaker 2>special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that.</v>

3559
02:27:38.850 --> 02:27:40.270
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3560
02:27:40.330 --> 02:27:42.970
<v Speaker 2>obviously the material's great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great delivery and everyone in that,</v>

3561
02:27:42.971 --> 02:27:46.570
<v Speaker 2>but I think everything is enhanced more </v>
<v Speaker 2>with an intimate environment.</v>

3562
02:27:46.750 --> 02:27:48.730
<v Speaker 2>My favorite spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite specials that I did,</v>

3563
02:27:48.731 --> 02:27:49.564
<v Speaker 2>I did at the comedy works in Denver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like I think it's what does that </v>

3564
02:27:52.301 --> 02:27:53.134
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even 300 people I don't think </v>

3565
02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:55.193
<v Speaker 2>really might be 300.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just saw Judah fried lenders and he </v>

3566
02:27:57.761 --> 02:27:58.594
<v Speaker 2>did his all in the comedy cellar I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be perfect and it was all a bunch </v>

3567
02:28:02.081 --> 02:28:03.970
<v Speaker 2>of different from over like a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

3568
02:28:04.390 --> 02:28:05.100
<v Speaker 2>So he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3569
02:28:05.100 --> 02:28:07.760
<v Speaker 2>he would just great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

3570
02:28:07.780 --> 02:28:11.320
<v Speaker 2>And he did it in black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh see if you do that man,</v>

3571
02:28:11.321 --> 02:28:13.150
<v Speaker 2>you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get the right show.</v>

3572
02:28:13.180 --> 02:28:14.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>

3573
02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:15.193
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're trying to capture one </v>

3574
02:28:16.660 --> 02:28:17.800
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one night,</v>

3575
02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:19.490
<v Speaker 2>what are the odds that it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>

3576
02:28:19.660 --> 02:28:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Too much pressure on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

3577
02:28:21.141 --> 02:28:22.100
<v Speaker 2>I never thought about that.</v>

3578
02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:25.100
<v Speaker 1>That you're in this big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge thing and people are watching it in</v>

3579
02:28:25.101 --> 02:28:27.530
<v Speaker 1>their little room and it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3580
02:28:27.531 --> 02:28:29.660
<v Speaker 1>I definitely want to do my next special </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a club.</v>

3581
02:28:29.690 --> 02:28:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Did you see Dave Chappelle's new netflix</v>
<v Speaker 1>special?</v>

3582
02:28:31.611 --> 02:28:33.380
<v Speaker 1>The one that he did at the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>belly room.</v>

3583
02:28:34.010 --> 02:28:34.843
<v Speaker 1>He did two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did want it to a good size place in </v>

3584
02:28:36.540 --> 02:28:40.640
<v Speaker 1>dc or just things like a couple thousand</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and then he did another one,</v>

3585
02:28:40.670 --> 02:28:44.030
<v Speaker 1>the belly room which was like 70 people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was there for that one.</v>

3586
02:28:44.110 --> 02:28:44.931
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3587
02:28:44.931 --> 02:28:45.471
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3588
02:28:45.471 --> 02:28:46.880
<v Speaker 1>this is interesting man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3589
02:28:46.881 --> 02:28:47.714
<v Speaker 1>it's so conversational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like when you're at home it's great </v>

3590
02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:51.313
<v Speaker 1>because it's like he's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the people are literally as </v>

3591
02:28:54.681 --> 02:28:55.514
<v Speaker 1>close to him as you are to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're right there to like </v>

3592
02:28:58.731 --> 02:29:01.100
<v Speaker 1>you're in the room with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now check that out.</v>

3593
02:29:01.100 --> 02:29:03.410
<v Speaker 1>And I have an intimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel it,</v>

3594
02:29:03.930 --> 02:29:05.220
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3595
02:29:05.520 --> 02:29:09.490
<v Speaker 1>how is it funny to fucking hilarious the</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in dcs genius.</v>

3596
02:29:09.700 --> 02:29:13.280
<v Speaker 1>And then the one in the belly room is </v>
<v Speaker 1>great too,</v>

3597
02:29:13.281 --> 02:29:15.110
<v Speaker 1>but in a different way because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3598
02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:19.970
<v Speaker 1>it's more like really current events </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like he's talking about Louis Ck,</v>

3599
02:29:19.971 --> 02:29:20.804
<v Speaker 1>like there he is up there so it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis ck and Harvey Weinstein and Kevin </v>

3600
02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Spacey was a big part of the material </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was talking about.</v>

3601
02:29:29.091 --> 02:29:31.130
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was right after it happened.</v>

3602
02:29:31.550 --> 02:29:32.383
<v Speaker 1>He filmed this in November,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was just a couple of months ago </v>

3603
02:29:36.050 --> 02:29:38.810
<v Speaker 1>and it was out in New Year's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Year's Day.</v>

3604
02:29:39.540 --> 02:29:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll check it out.</v>

3605
02:29:40.620 --> 02:29:41.510
<v Speaker 1>They'll definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

3606
02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:42.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have Amazon prime.</v>

3607
02:29:42.621 --> 02:29:44.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to Brag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh you.</v>

3608
02:29:44.451 --> 02:29:46.520
<v Speaker 1>And 65 fucking million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

3609
02:29:46.521 --> 02:29:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Sixty four percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixty four percent.</v>

3610
02:29:48.111 --> 02:29:49.910
<v Speaker 1>Sixty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>64 percent of the country.</v>

3611
02:29:50.120 --> 02:29:53.090
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how many of those people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching it on TV though.</v>

3612
02:29:53.090 --> 02:29:54.920
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Using Amazon prime.</v>

3613
02:29:54.921 --> 02:29:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Just for the TV part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many of them are using the TV</v>

3614
02:29:58.071 --> 02:30:00.410
<v Speaker 1>part of prime?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you were watching?</v>

3615
02:30:00.411 --> 02:30:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Because I have Amazon prime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

3616
02:30:02.750 --> 02:30:05.250
<v Speaker 1>I never remembered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never used it for TV.</v>

3617
02:30:05.490 --> 02:30:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Now I've never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you still have old time cable?</v>

3618
02:30:08.780 --> 02:30:10.100
<v Speaker 1>I have direct TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3619
02:30:10.101 --> 02:30:11.880
<v Speaker 1>so that's old time cable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3620
02:30:12.020 --> 02:30:13.090
<v Speaker 1>I still have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3621
02:30:13.091 --> 02:30:14.570
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to flip through the.</v>

3622
02:30:14.600 --> 02:30:18.110
<v Speaker 1>I like cooking shows and I like watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing and sports.</v>

3623
02:30:18.140 --> 02:30:20.540
<v Speaker 1>It's great for live sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't really,</v>

3624
02:30:20.570 --> 02:30:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch the football too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

3625
02:30:22.910 --> 02:30:23.980
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3626
02:30:24.020 --> 02:30:24.853
<v Speaker 1>I did watch the superbowl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was even though I loved watching New </v>

3627
02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:30.710
<v Speaker 1>England lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really didn't really.</v>

3628
02:30:30.850 --> 02:30:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Game just doesn't excite me anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

3629
02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:35.330
<v Speaker 1>it's just a bunch of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>millionaires and that kind of,</v>

3630
02:30:35.450 --> 02:30:37.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once they get younger than you to.</v>

3631
02:30:37.040 --> 02:30:39.380
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get excited with all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>

3632
02:30:40.990 --> 02:30:41.840
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3633
02:30:41.841 --> 02:30:43.330
<v Speaker 1>is that stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3634
02:30:43.490 --> 02:30:45.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's only stupid if it's stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>

3635
02:30:45.640 --> 02:30:46.473
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just was a lot and now and </v>

3636
02:30:47.511 --> 02:30:49.940
<v Speaker 1>when I moved out from Chicago to La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3637
02:30:50.090 --> 02:30:52.220
<v Speaker 1>sports just seemed so much less </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

3638
02:30:52.400 --> 02:30:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Now I like watching sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3639
02:30:53.991 --> 02:30:54.824
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like boxing because it's very much </v>

3640
02:30:56.541 --> 02:30:58.250
<v Speaker 1>like standup comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no hiding.</v>

3641
02:30:58.850 --> 02:31:00.970
<v Speaker 1>You reveal who you are in the ring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3642
02:31:01.010 --> 02:31:02.840
<v Speaker 1>And just like as a standup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no hiding,</v>

3643
02:31:03.050 --> 02:31:03.883
<v Speaker 1>there's no fucking light show or music </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath their fucking dancing girls </v>

3644
02:31:06.540 --> 02:31:07.373
<v Speaker 1>just liking you and your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why I like boxing and I </v>

3645
02:31:10.790 --> 02:31:14.180
<v Speaker 1>and I realized again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's people that think I'm blowing smoke</v>

3646
02:31:14.181 --> 02:31:15.950
<v Speaker 1>up your ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't like to watch.</v>

3647
02:31:16.190 --> 02:31:17.300
<v Speaker 1>I like to watch UFC.</v>

3648
02:31:17.300 --> 02:31:18.133
<v Speaker 1>I like to watch the fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only you're announcing it because I </v>

3649
02:31:20.851 --> 02:31:21.684
<v Speaker 1>liked the backstories and all that shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you give to it that no one else </v>

3650
02:31:24.901 --> 02:31:27.810
<v Speaker 1>seems to be able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just kind of roles are it off of you.</v>

3651
02:31:27.960 --> 02:31:30.270
<v Speaker 1>It just falls out of your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other people,</v>

3652
02:31:30.320 --> 02:31:31.420
<v Speaker 1>announcers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

3653
02:31:31.750 --> 02:31:33.390
<v Speaker 1>it's just boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't watch that.</v>

3654
02:31:33.400 --> 02:31:35.770
<v Speaker 1>It's very nice to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just because I care about it.</v>

3655
02:31:35.810 --> 02:31:36.643
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is you can sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been a part of my life since I was </v>

3656
02:31:39.421 --> 02:31:40.254
<v Speaker 1>a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for me it's very important when </v>

3657
02:31:42.871 --> 02:31:46.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching this and explaining what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

3658
02:31:46.081 --> 02:31:46.914
<v Speaker 1>like physically like to look to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what the gracie brothers and </v>

3659
02:31:50.011 --> 02:31:52.710
<v Speaker 1>what that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they did and the like.</v>

3660
02:31:52.830 --> 02:31:55.830
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what heightens everything,</v>

3661
02:31:55.831 --> 02:31:56.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're watching and,</v>

3662
02:31:56.790 --> 02:31:57.623
<v Speaker 1>and that's why I liked to watch boxing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because those guys' stories are always </v>

3663
02:32:00.031 --> 02:32:00.864
<v Speaker 1>these unbelievable.</v>

3664
02:32:01.160 --> 02:32:02.710
<v Speaker 1>His mother abandoned him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was 80,</v>

3665
02:32:02.730 --> 02:32:05.360
<v Speaker 1>walked Brazil for three years and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>he started like,</v>

3666
02:32:05.370 --> 02:32:07.190
<v Speaker 1>holy fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3667
02:32:07.220 --> 02:32:09.230
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's like,</v>

3668
02:32:09.300 --> 02:32:12.990
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a do or die and it's one on one and</v>

3669
02:32:12.991 --> 02:32:13.824
<v Speaker 1>that's why I love box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what we were talking about earlier </v>

3670
02:32:15.241 --> 02:32:16.074
<v Speaker 1>when we were talking about Jay Leno's </v>
<v Speaker 1>new show is that he's actually </v>

3671
02:32:17.881 --> 02:32:18.714
<v Speaker 1>passionate about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone's passionate about </v>

3672
02:32:20.131 --> 02:32:22.380
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes through when it's real,</v>

3673
02:32:22.381 --> 02:32:24.660
<v Speaker 1>when it's genuine and they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate it.</v>

3674
02:32:24.860 --> 02:32:25.693
<v Speaker 1>It comes through and I think if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not doing something you're passionate </v>

3675
02:32:29.011 --> 02:32:29.844
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that from watching someone </v>

3676
02:32:31.351 --> 02:32:34.410
<v Speaker 1>who is doing something like the Jay Leno</v>
<v Speaker 1>show or anything along those lines.</v>

3677
02:32:34.950 --> 02:32:36.600
<v Speaker 1>When you see someone you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3678
02:32:36.601 --> 02:32:37.434
<v Speaker 1>that's that feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that magic does that thing where </v>

3679
02:32:39.361 --> 02:32:41.790
<v Speaker 1>someone's like really excited about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's legit,</v>

3680
02:32:41.820 --> 02:32:44.460
<v Speaker 1>like it's in their bones and if it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your bones,</v>

3681
02:32:44.461 --> 02:32:45.294
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better find what is because you're </v>

3682
02:32:46.171 --> 02:32:47.280
<v Speaker 1>missing out on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3683
02:32:47.281 --> 02:32:48.360
<v Speaker 1>you're only getting to seven.</v>

3684
02:32:48.390 --> 02:32:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Life goes to 10 and you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not ever hitting the high spots.</v>

3685
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:53.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might be fine being,</v>

3686
02:32:53.670 --> 02:32:57.090
<v Speaker 1>staying at seven forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been to attend too many times.</v>

3687
02:32:57.150 --> 02:32:59.100
<v Speaker 1>He liked being at 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

3688
02:32:59.340 --> 02:33:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Most people never get to five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

3689
02:33:01.711 --> 02:33:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people I grew up with and stuff,</v>

3690
02:33:04.171 --> 02:33:05.370
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's system.</v>

3691
02:33:05.430 --> 02:33:06.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy opened my,</v>

3692
02:33:06.940 --> 02:33:08.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up on the south side of Chicago.</v>

3693
02:33:08.700 --> 02:33:10.680
<v Speaker 1>We could see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see the sears tower,</v>

3694
02:33:10.681 --> 02:33:11.514
<v Speaker 1>the John Hancock building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are the two biggest buildings in </v>

3695
02:33:12.910 --> 02:33:13.743
<v Speaker 1>Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see downtown from where I </v>

3696
02:33:14.671 --> 02:33:16.290
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever went there,</v>

3697
02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:17.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

3698
02:33:17.941 --> 02:33:18.774
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I guess if you grew up in the </v>

3699
02:33:19.321 --> 02:33:20.430
<v Speaker 1>bronx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see Manhattan.</v>

3700
02:33:20.431 --> 02:33:21.960
<v Speaker 1>You never went right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3701
02:33:21.961 --> 02:33:22.794
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then comedy kind of opened that up </v>

3702
02:33:23.761 --> 02:33:24.594
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went into those neighborhoods and I </v>

3703
02:33:25.890 --> 02:33:28.320
<v Speaker 1>under and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is awesome.</v>

3704
02:33:28.500 --> 02:33:30.750
<v Speaker 1>I love this city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing.</v>

3705
02:33:30.751 --> 02:33:31.584
<v Speaker 1>It was set guts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said it was such a heady experience </v>

3706
02:33:33.061 --> 02:33:33.894
<v Speaker 1>for me and thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My whole life was ahead of me and no </v>

3707
02:33:36.331 --> 02:33:38.040
<v Speaker 1>matter who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you kill,</v>

3708
02:33:38.100 --> 02:33:38.933
<v Speaker 1>if you're a stand up and you kill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you kill Adzenys as 150 </v>

3709
02:33:42.001 --> 02:33:44.760
<v Speaker 1>people or if you kill a Madison Square </v>
<v Speaker 1>Garden,</v>

3710
02:33:44.820 --> 02:33:47.610
<v Speaker 1>it's still killing the same feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

3711
02:33:48.120 --> 02:33:49.430
<v Speaker 1>it's 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit 10,</v>

3712
02:33:49.431 --> 02:33:51.720
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit a joke and boom and you hear the</v>

3713
02:33:51.721 --> 02:33:55.270
<v Speaker 1>roar like that's 10 and there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3714
02:33:56.490 --> 02:33:57.323
<v Speaker 1>my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time I got a paid </v>

3715
02:33:58.321 --> 02:34:00.960
<v Speaker 1>gig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was in Wheaton or wheeling,</v>

3716
02:34:00.990 --> 02:34:01.681
<v Speaker 1>Illinois.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

02:34:01.681 --> 02:34:02.514
<v Speaker 1>it was $50 and I was telling him I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to drive 50 miles to go make $50 to do </v>

3718
02:34:05.941 --> 02:34:07.350
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which to me it was a victory,</v>

3719
02:34:07.410 --> 02:34:08.243
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he worked for the power company in </v>

3721
02:34:10.321 --> 02:34:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Chicago.</v>

3722
02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:11.573
<v Speaker 1>Come with us and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd have to pay me $50 just to drive </v>

3723
02:34:13.681 --> 02:34:14.514
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3724
02:34:14.730 --> 02:34:15.271
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3725
02:34:15.271 --> 02:34:17.770
<v Speaker 1>but when you get there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to go to work.</v>

3726
02:34:18.730 --> 02:34:20.920
<v Speaker 1>What I get there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the center of attention.</v>

3727
02:34:20.921 --> 02:34:21.754
<v Speaker 1>It's there's a party happening and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guest of honor and I'm going to get </v>

3728
02:34:23.861 --> 02:34:24.694
<v Speaker 1>a blow job afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I did that night in the church </v>

3729
02:34:27.071 --> 02:34:27.904
<v Speaker 1>parking lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fantastic church parking lot </v>

3730
02:34:29.690 --> 02:34:32.950
<v Speaker 1>where the parking lot of a church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

3731
02:34:33.250 --> 02:34:35.620
<v Speaker 1>so that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I loved stand up comedy.</v>

3732
02:34:35.621 --> 02:34:37.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's nothing like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere you go,</v>

3733
02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:38.793
<v Speaker 1>you're the guest of honor at a party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing that people </v>

3734

<v Speaker 1>probably never totally understand about </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup that haven't done it is you </v>

<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even seem real.</v>

3756
02:35:26.290 --> 02:35:28.240
<v Speaker 1>First Time that happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

3757
02:35:28.330 --> 02:35:31.030
<v Speaker 1>I was working at a zany up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should too late.</v>

3758
02:35:31.540 --> 02:35:33.190
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

3759
02:35:33.430 --> 02:35:36.460
<v Speaker 1>I come off stage and this woman came up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me and uh,</v>

3760
02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:37.720
<v Speaker 1>she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you going?</v>

3761
02:35:37.721 --> 02:35:38.950
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to the bathroom.</v>

3762
02:35:39.790 --> 02:35:41.470
<v Speaker 1>And she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you need any help?</v>

3763
02:35:42.490 --> 02:35:45.010
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at that club there's just one.</v>

3764
02:35:45.210 --> 02:35:46.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not a big bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one stall,</v>

3765
02:35:46.990 --> 02:35:48.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get your own room,</v>

3766
02:35:48.370 --> 02:35:50.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

3767
02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:50.983
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if my boss would appreciate that or </v>

3768
02:35:53.471 --> 02:35:54.700
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she says,</v>

3769
02:35:54.701 --> 02:35:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here with the boss's wife,</v>

3770
02:35:55.931 --> 02:35:59.470
<v Speaker 1>which I don't know if she was or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she follows me into the bathroom.</v>

3771
02:35:59.471 --> 02:36:01.250
<v Speaker 1>And gave me a blow job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

3772
02:36:01.420 --> 02:36:02.350
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got out.</v>

3773
02:36:02.370 --> 02:36:04.930
<v Speaker 1>I had to go up and bring up the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking awesome.</v>

3774
02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:08.530
<v Speaker 1>It was almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

3775
02:36:08.531 --> 02:36:12.040
<v Speaker 1>I love comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird.</v>

3776
02:36:12.070 --> 02:36:14.500
<v Speaker 1>A shifting of roles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3777
02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:15.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

3778
02:36:15.530 --> 02:36:16.363
<v Speaker 1>I remember my back hurt at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have a bad back when I was </v>

3779
02:36:18.641 --> 02:36:19.474
<v Speaker 1>starting comedy and I remember I had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like sit on the sink because I got my </v>

3780
02:36:21.971 --> 02:36:26.971
<v Speaker 1>back and I said she's blowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so funny.</v>

3781
02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:30.850
<v Speaker 1>I love girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get that thing from comedy though.</v>

3782
02:36:30.851 --> 02:36:34.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a funny thing that Allie has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like a.</v>

3783
02:36:34.270 --> 02:36:36.730
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>road pussy is amazing.</v>

3784
02:36:36.731 --> 02:36:38.140
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>road dick is.</v>

3785
02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:40.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do her bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to ruin her.</v>

3786
02:36:41.020 --> 02:36:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

3787
02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:43.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same.</v>

3788
02:36:43.210 --> 02:36:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to ruin her material,</v>

3789
02:36:44.980 --> 02:36:47.380
<v Speaker 1>but essentially that's what she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

3790
02:36:47.780 --> 02:36:50.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good deal for gals.</v>

3791
02:36:50.530 --> 02:36:51.580
<v Speaker 1>It must be different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3792
02:36:51.581 --> 02:36:52.980
<v Speaker 1>one time I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3793
02:36:53.260 --> 02:36:54.940
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a big mouth and everything.</v>

3794
02:36:54.941 --> 02:36:58.950
<v Speaker 1>And so when I started comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this girl and um,</v>

3795
02:36:59.530 --> 02:37:02.320
<v Speaker 1>she was pretty and I guess I must have </v>
<v Speaker 1>told people I'd like to get it on.</v>

3796
02:37:02.380 --> 02:37:04.290
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to work the road with her </v>
<v Speaker 1>so I could fuck her.</v>

3797
02:37:06.850 --> 02:37:07.683
<v Speaker 1>That's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people hearing that now today you're </v>

3798
02:37:10.780 --> 02:37:12.910
<v Speaker 1>a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if.</v>

3799
02:37:12.911 --> 02:37:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if I said what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3800
02:37:13.900 --> 02:37:16.040
<v Speaker 1>how I said or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so that I get</v>

3801
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:16.873
<v Speaker 3>confronted by her at a comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This girl comes up to me and I didn't </v>

3802
02:37:20.091 --> 02:37:21.200
<v Speaker 3>know she was going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

3803
02:37:21.410 --> 02:37:22.490
<v Speaker 3>hi Jimmy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

<v Speaker 3>how you doing?</v>

3805
02:37:23.031 --> 02:37:23.864
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard you said you can't wait to work </v>

3806
02:37:25.101 --> 02:37:27.830
<v Speaker 3>the road because you wanted to fuck me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3807
02:37:28.790 --> 02:37:29.950
<v Speaker 3>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3808
02:37:30.020 --> 02:37:30.950
<v Speaker 3>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you say that?</v>

3809
02:37:30.951 --> 02:37:33.080
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sounds like something I would say.</v>

3810
02:37:34.910 --> 02:37:36.020
<v Speaker 3>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3811
02:37:36.100 --> 02:37:36.861
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she goes,</v>

3812
02:37:36.861 --> 02:37:38.980
<v Speaker 3>don't you want to know who told me I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be anything</v>

3813
02:37:39.010 --> 02:37:43.540
<v Speaker 2>buddy taught you want to know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she goes,</v>

3814
02:37:43.541 --> 02:37:45.140
<v Speaker 2>she ran out of things to say yes.</v>

3815
02:37:45.490 --> 02:37:46.151
<v Speaker 3>And then she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3816
02:37:46.151 --> 02:37:46.984
<v Speaker 3>why did you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go because you're really pretty and </v>

3817
02:37:49.031 --> 02:37:52.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm attracted to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she totally changed.</v>

3818
02:37:52.031 --> 02:37:52.900
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3819
02:37:52.901 --> 02:37:56.590
<v Speaker 3>well that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally changed.</v>

3820
02:37:56.620 --> 02:37:57.453
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is a different era and we're </v>

3821
02:37:58.121 --> 02:38:00.610
<v Speaker 3>friends til this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if this never had sex,</v>

3822
02:38:00.611 --> 02:38:03.730
<v Speaker 3>but she would write an article for some </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them online rags,</v>

3823
02:38:03.820 --> 02:38:04.610
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

3824
02:38:04.610 --> 02:38:06.340
<v Speaker 3>I want to get in trouble for that piece </v>
<v Speaker 3>of shit.</v>

3825
02:38:06.370 --> 02:38:08.410
<v Speaker 3>But I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just starting comedy.</v>

3826
02:38:08.411 --> 02:38:09.244
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know him and my asshole from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hole in the ground and I didn't know </v>

3827
02:38:11.561 --> 02:38:13.180
<v Speaker 3>anything about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when she said she goes,</v>

3828
02:38:13.181 --> 02:38:14.720
<v Speaker 3>why did you send them free?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did you say that?</v>

3829
02:38:14.740 --> 02:38:16.300
<v Speaker 3>And I just decided to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

3830
02:38:16.450 --> 02:38:18.040
<v Speaker 3>because you're pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm attracted to you.</v>

3831
02:38:18.070 --> 02:38:19.000
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3832
02:38:19.420 --> 02:38:23.680
<v Speaker 3>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she thought,</v>

3833
02:38:23.681 --> 02:38:26.530
<v Speaker 3>I thought I was saying she was a slut </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's not what I was saying.</v>

3834
02:38:27.100 --> 02:38:27.933
<v Speaker 3>That's not what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was saying she's fucking chance with </v>

3835
02:38:30.460 --> 02:38:31.293
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

3836
02:38:31.340 --> 02:38:33.400
<v Speaker 3>I would like a chance with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was saying.</v>

3837
02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:35.470
<v Speaker 3>She took it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was saying she was a horse,</v>

3838
02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:37.720
<v Speaker 3>so that's not what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she totally.</v>

3839
02:38:37.721 --> 02:38:38.554
<v Speaker 3>It was that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only experience I have like </v>

3840
02:38:39.520 --> 02:38:40.121
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3841
02:38:40.121 --> 02:38:41.050
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be a weird thing.</v>

3842
02:38:41.100 --> 02:38:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Time if we remove flirting and clumsy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attempt sets,</v>

3843
02:38:46.850 --> 02:38:50.520
<v Speaker 2>sex and there's a lot of that stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 2>turns out to be fun.</v>

3844
02:38:50.670 --> 02:38:51.503
<v Speaker 2>It's funny to that like one thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say to one person is highly </v>

3845
02:38:55.261 --> 02:38:56.094
<v Speaker 2>offensive and you could say it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>another person is exactly what they </v>

3846
02:38:58.741 --> 02:39:00.470
<v Speaker 2>wanted to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like.</v>

3847
02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:01.313
<v Speaker 2>And you really don't know until you </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially you say it or do it and you </v>

3848
02:39:03.451 --> 02:39:05.360
<v Speaker 2>read it written on paper like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3849
02:39:05.361 --> 02:39:09.090
<v Speaker 2>it sounds terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the right circumstance,</v>

3850
02:39:09.180 --> 02:39:12.060
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to admit that.</v>

3851
02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dated this girl once,</v>

3852
02:39:14.370 --> 02:39:17.610
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget they ever read it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it's read back to you in court,</v>

3853
02:39:17.611 --> 02:39:20.190
<v Speaker 2>it sounds horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the go ahead,</v>

3854
02:39:20.700 --> 02:39:23.690
<v Speaker 2>there was a girl that I dated once and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're making out and uh,</v>

3855
02:39:23.990 --> 02:39:25.860
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're getting into it hot and heavy.</v>

3856
02:39:25.860 --> 02:39:26.693
<v Speaker 2>She grabs my dick and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to get on my knees or get on </v>

3857
02:39:28.741 --> 02:39:29.940
<v Speaker 2>your knees and suck my cock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

3858
02:39:30.270 --> 02:39:31.830
<v Speaker 2>I've always wanted someone to tie that </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>

3859
02:39:31.850 --> 02:39:32.683
<v Speaker 2>No Kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She drops down to her knees and like </v>

3860
02:39:35.010 --> 02:39:37.710
<v Speaker 2>she's fucking going at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when she looked at me,</v>

3861
02:39:37.711 --> 02:39:38.544
<v Speaker 2>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always wanted someone to say that </v>

3862
02:39:39.030 --> 02:39:40.610
<v Speaker 2>to me and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3863
02:39:41.670 --> 02:39:44.010
<v Speaker 2>Jackpot baby?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on seven.</v>

3864
02:39:44.700 --> 02:39:46.170
<v Speaker 2>You could say that some girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'd be like,</v>

3865
02:39:46.171 --> 02:39:47.580
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3866
02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:49.120
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole.</v>

3867
02:39:49.121 --> 02:39:51.570
<v Speaker 2>You can say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know in the moment.</v>

3868
02:39:51.750 --> 02:39:54.510
<v Speaker 2>Like I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was hot and heavy and crazy quick and</v>

3869
02:39:54.511 --> 02:39:56.430
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to roll the dice.</v>

3870
02:39:56.460 --> 02:39:57.540
<v Speaker 2>Let's just see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's pull up.</v>

3871
02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:02.600
<v Speaker 2>Let's go for three lemons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't see what the fuck happens.</v>

3872
02:40:03.330 --> 02:40:05.040
<v Speaker 2>You never know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't,</v>

3873
02:40:05.090 --> 02:40:06.750
<v Speaker 2>you don't make any calls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't make any sales.</v>

3874
02:40:06.751 --> 02:40:08.600
<v Speaker 2>But this was 1993,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3875
02:40:08.610 --> 02:40:12.300
<v Speaker 2>try doing that in 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get in real trouble.</v>

3876
02:40:12.430 --> 02:40:14.070
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just talked to a guy and he made</v>

3877
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:14.903
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He owns a bar and he was talking about </v>

3878
02:40:16.081 --> 02:40:17.280
<v Speaker 4>Hashtag me too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he says,</v>

3879
02:40:17.281 --> 02:40:18.114
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing is that women don't have to </v>

3880
02:40:19.111 --> 02:40:21.870
<v Speaker 4>hit on men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Men are always the aggressor.</v>

3881
02:40:21.990 --> 02:40:24.090
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that causes a lot of problems,</v>

3882
02:40:24.091 --> 02:40:25.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a guy will say,</v>

3883
02:40:25.500 --> 02:40:26.333
<v Speaker 4>I'll see a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what have this group of friends and </v>

3884
02:40:27.211 --> 02:40:30.480
<v Speaker 4>he'll slink over to try to talk to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl and he's nervous and he says,</v>

3885
02:40:30.481 --> 02:40:31.560
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you want to dance?</v>

3886
02:40:31.561 --> 02:40:34.050
<v Speaker 4>And she'll shut him down and he'll walk </v>
<v Speaker 4>back over and like,</v>

3887
02:40:34.051 --> 02:40:34.950
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that fucking bitch,</v>

3888
02:40:34.951 --> 02:40:36.150
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

3889
02:40:36.180 --> 02:40:37.013
<v Speaker 4>that's what said because he's got to </v>
<v Speaker 4>save face and women don't know what </v>

3890
02:40:40.021 --> 02:40:40.854
<v Speaker 4>that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was thinking attractive women do </v>

3891
02:40:43.301 --> 02:40:44.710
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean one of the,</v>

3892
02:40:44.740 --> 02:40:47.770
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that you see from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same people,</v>

3893
02:40:48.010 --> 02:40:48.843
<v Speaker 4>whether it's men or women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is people that are constantly shut down </v>

3894
02:40:52.270 --> 02:40:56.980
<v Speaker 4>and ridiculed and mocked by the opposite</v>
<v Speaker 4>sex become very bitter and angry.</v>

3895
02:40:57.220 --> 02:40:58.053
<v Speaker 4>You see it sometimes from unattractive </v>
<v Speaker 4>women who have been shit on by men and </v>

3896
02:41:01.451 --> 02:41:03.550
<v Speaker 4>you see it from an attractive men who've</v>
<v Speaker 4>been shit on by women.</v>

3897
02:41:03.551 --> 02:41:05.700
<v Speaker 4>They developed this animosity towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>the opposite sex.</v>

3898
02:41:05.730 --> 02:41:06.563
<v Speaker 4>It's very unfortunate and it a lot of it</v>
<v Speaker 4>comes from that feeling that you just </v>

3899
02:41:09.671 --> 02:41:12.170
<v Speaker 4>get from someone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you make an advance,</v>

3900
02:41:12.171 --> 02:41:14.770
<v Speaker 4>you become vulnerable and look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're a guy,</v>

3901
02:41:15.020 --> 02:41:17.410
<v Speaker 4>not a good looking guy and take a chance</v>
<v Speaker 4>of some girl.</v>

3902
02:41:17.450 --> 02:41:18.283
<v Speaker 4>She's with her friends at a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She might mock you openly in front of </v>

3903
02:41:20.201 --> 02:41:23.590
<v Speaker 4>her friends and it's ruthlessly painful </v>
<v Speaker 4>and she's just not attracted to you.</v>

3904
02:41:23.591 --> 02:41:26.260
<v Speaker 4>She wants to shut down any possibility </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you might have in your head.</v>

3905
02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:29.050
<v Speaker 4>You go back over there and this happens </v>
<v Speaker 4>time and time again.</v>

3906
02:41:29.890 --> 02:41:30.723
<v Speaker 4>You could easily develop animosity </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards women or develop a very bad </v>

3907
02:41:33.941 --> 02:41:36.010
<v Speaker 4>association with the opposite sex.</v>

3908
02:41:36.220 --> 02:41:37.053
<v Speaker 4>You see that from women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of women that I know that </v>

3909
02:41:39.311 --> 02:41:44.020
<v Speaker 4>have real issues with men and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>very unattractive and they'll say really</v>

3910
02:41:44.110 --> 02:41:47.830
<v Speaker 4>gross generalizing things about men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They will make these grown.</v>

3911
02:41:48.070 --> 02:41:51.670
<v Speaker 4>Men are this and men suck and men aren't</v>
<v Speaker 4>funny and men aren't this,</v>

3912
02:41:51.671 --> 02:41:52.504
<v Speaker 4>and men are that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you look at them and you're </v>

3913
02:41:53.681 --> 02:41:54.460
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3914
02:41:54.460 --> 02:41:55.660
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're obese.</v>

3915
02:41:56.240 --> 02:41:59.470
<v Speaker 4>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're unattractive and your experiences</v>

3916
02:41:59.471 --> 02:42:00.304
<v Speaker 4>with men have probably largely been of </v>
<v Speaker 4>rejection and pad things on top of all </v>

3917
02:42:05.411 --> 02:42:06.244
<v Speaker 4>the realities of what men are capable of</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the horrible things that meant </v>

3918
02:42:08.261 --> 02:42:09.094
<v Speaker 4>absolutely do no denying that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to have this gross generalizations </v>

3919
02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:17.890
<v Speaker 4>about an entire gender based on what </v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3920
02:42:17.891 --> 02:42:20.650
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it is based on their own life </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences.</v>

3921
02:42:20.800 --> 02:42:23.830
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go to some really attractive girls.</v>

3922
02:42:23.980 --> 02:42:24.940
<v Speaker 4>Go to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3923
02:42:25.210 --> 02:42:28.120
<v Speaker 4>fill in the blank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some really attractive girl who's always</v>

3924
02:42:28.121 --> 02:42:29.200
<v Speaker 4>had men hit on her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She might be,</v>

3925
02:42:29.201 --> 02:42:30.070
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>men are gross.</v>

3926
02:42:30.071 --> 02:42:31.810
<v Speaker 4>Men are discussing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just waiting for the right guy.</v>

3927
02:42:32.020 --> 02:42:35.350
<v Speaker 4>She's not lumping all men into this </v>
<v Speaker 4>group,</v>

3928
02:42:35.620 --> 02:42:36.453
<v Speaker 4>but many women that are unattractive and</v>
<v Speaker 4>had a hard time with men have the same </v>

3929
02:42:41.381 --> 02:42:44.860
<v Speaker 4>response towards men that many </v>
<v Speaker 4>unattractive men have towards women.</v>

3930
02:42:44.861 --> 02:42:45.694
<v Speaker 4>It's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking hard roll the dice to be </v>

3931
02:42:48.611 --> 02:42:53.611
<v Speaker 4>born in a way that just without any </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing of your own,</v>

3932
02:42:55.180 --> 02:42:56.013
<v Speaker 4>completely outside of your control,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just not sexually attractive to </v>

3933
02:42:58.241 --> 02:42:59.200
<v Speaker 4>the opposite sex.</v>

3934
02:42:59.670 --> 02:43:00.630
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

3935
02:43:01.590 --> 02:43:05.610
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize that men had this kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of anger towards women.</v>

3936
02:43:05.670 --> 02:43:06.890
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize men,</v>

3937
02:43:06.930 --> 02:43:11.490
<v Speaker 3>women had it towards him and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but porn a want,</v>

3938
02:43:11.890 --> 02:43:15.100
<v Speaker 3>it turns me off a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of it is like this anger,</v>

3939
02:43:15.590 --> 02:43:16.423
<v Speaker 3>slap and forcing and jamming the COC and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the on your ear and all this and </v>

3940
02:43:21.491 --> 02:43:22.480
<v Speaker 3>speeding in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3941
02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:25.060
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is,</v>

3942
02:43:25.180 --> 02:43:26.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3943
02:43:26.611 --> 02:43:29.410
<v Speaker 3>I like when I have sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to please a woman,</v>

3944
02:43:29.470 --> 02:43:30.303
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like her to be happy and comfortable </v>

3945
02:43:31.841 --> 02:43:33.710
<v Speaker 3>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that whole ain't.</v>

3946
02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:34.900
<v Speaker 3>So that's when I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3947
02:43:34.901 --> 02:43:39.460
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of fucking dudes who </v>
<v Speaker 3>hate women and angry and they get off.</v>

3948
02:43:39.461 --> 02:43:40.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>humiliating them.</v>

3949
02:43:40.690 --> 02:43:41.740
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't get off on that.</v>

3950
02:43:41.850 --> 02:43:42.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely that.</v>

3951
02:43:43.050 --> 02:43:43.680
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3952
02:43:43.680 --> 02:43:47.490
<v Speaker 4>I had a friend and he was an </v>
<v Speaker 4>unattractive Gar and watched him go from</v>

3953
02:43:47.640 --> 02:43:51.760
<v Speaker 4>being sort of having these idealistic </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas about the one guy.</v>

3954
02:43:51.810 --> 02:43:52.643
<v Speaker 4>One day he's going like he had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend at the time and turned his </v>

3955
02:43:54.210 --> 02:43:55.043
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend was cheating on him and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>he had other girls and they were trying </v>

3956
02:43:57.841 --> 02:44:01.970
<v Speaker 4>to get his money and then he just became</v>
<v Speaker 4>this bitter fucking God.</v>

3957
02:44:02.160 --> 02:44:05.010
<v Speaker 4>Like over the time that I knew him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just became a woman hater.</v>

3958
02:44:05.011 --> 02:44:05.844
<v Speaker 4>I mean straight up woman hater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd hit on girls and they would turn </v>

3959
02:44:08.671 --> 02:44:11.310
<v Speaker 4>them down like fucking dykes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just be angry,</v>

3960
02:44:11.460 --> 02:44:15.270
<v Speaker 4>like angry at women like he associated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I watched it from afar.</v>

3961
02:44:15.660 --> 02:44:18.540
<v Speaker 4>He associated women with negative </v>
<v Speaker 4>feelings.</v>

3962
02:44:18.541 --> 02:44:23.541
<v Speaker 4>You associate them with rejection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He associated them callousness that they</v>

3963
02:44:23.730 --> 02:44:26.130
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I have a friend who's overweight and</v>

3964
02:44:26.131 --> 02:44:27.270
<v Speaker 4>she feels like that about men.</v>

3965
02:44:27.270 --> 02:44:28.103
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes men are shit and you know </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're insulting and they're this and </v>

3966
02:44:30.451 --> 02:44:31.770
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like some,</v>

3967
02:44:31.950 --> 02:44:33.100
<v Speaker 4>some are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

3968
02:44:33.300 --> 02:44:34.133
<v Speaker 4>Some people are terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some males and females that terrible </v>

3969
02:44:36.541 --> 02:44:37.710
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're picking,</v>

3970
02:44:37.711 --> 02:44:40.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm on team penis and you're on team </v>
<v Speaker 4>vagina.</v>

3971
02:44:40.800 --> 02:44:43.140
<v Speaker 4>We've all lost because you're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're what?</v>

3972
02:44:43.141 --> 02:44:45.600
<v Speaker 4>You're going to align yourself with 150 </v>
<v Speaker 4>million people that you.</v>

3973
02:44:45.690 --> 02:44:47.370
<v Speaker 4>How many do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know?</v>

3974
02:44:47.371 --> 02:44:50.490
<v Speaker 4>A hundred and 50 of those 150 million </v>
<v Speaker 4>people because that's a lot.</v>

3975
02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:52.290
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you probably don't even know 100.</v>

3976
02:44:52.291 --> 02:44:54.900
<v Speaker 4>You don't probably don't even have an </v>
<v Speaker 4>intimate relationship with 150 men,</v>

3977
02:44:55.080 --> 02:44:59.190
<v Speaker 4>so you're going to lump all $150 million</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the same group that you're against an</v>

3978
02:44:59.191 --> 02:45:02.040
<v Speaker 4>150 million women into the group that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're with.</v>

3979
02:45:02.160 --> 02:45:04.020
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're humans.</v>

3980
02:45:04.140 --> 02:45:04.973
<v Speaker 4>We're supposed to be on team human and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're supposed to all figure out how to </v>

3981
02:45:08.161 --> 02:45:08.994
<v Speaker 4>get along.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But along the way we're trying to find </v>

3982
02:45:10.531 --> 02:45:14.400
<v Speaker 4>mates and we're trying to find </v>
<v Speaker 4>companionship and the.</v>

3983
02:45:14.401 --> 02:45:19.401
<v Speaker 4>The reality of that is it is a messy </v>
<v Speaker 4>proposition and some people get left out</v>

3984
02:45:19.530 --> 02:45:24.210
<v Speaker 4>and some people get shoved aside and </v>
<v Speaker 4>some people get attacked and some people</v>

3985
02:45:24.211 --> 02:45:25.044
<v Speaker 4>get diminished and some people feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible about the experience and some </v>

3986
02:45:28.021 --> 02:45:28.854
<v Speaker 4>people aren't good at it and some people</v>
<v Speaker 4>are better at it than others and some </v>

3987
02:45:30.751 --> 02:45:31.584
<v Speaker 4>people use money and influence and some </v>
<v Speaker 4>people use their looks and the whole </v>

3988
02:45:34.621 --> 02:45:36.450
<v Speaker 4>thing is just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not perfect.</v>

3989
02:45:36.570 --> 02:45:39.300
<v Speaker 4>This is not some egalitarianism venture.</v>

3990
02:45:39.420 --> 02:45:41.520
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never watched sex and the city,</v>

3991
02:45:41.550 --> 02:45:44.730
<v Speaker 3>but my wife did good for you and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>good for you.</v>

3992
02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:47.960
<v Speaker 3>She talks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched it once because Brian Callahan</v>

3993
02:45:47.970 --> 02:45:48.541
<v Speaker 3>was on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3994
02:45:48.541 --> 02:45:52.170
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely a show for women.</v>

3995
02:45:52.470 --> 02:45:53.580
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you saying?</v>

3996
02:45:54.060 --> 02:45:59.060
<v Speaker 3>Sexist God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my wife says about that show because</v>

3997
02:45:59.221 --> 02:46:01.050
<v Speaker 3>it was on her when she's watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

3998
02:46:01.260 --> 02:46:02.093
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these women all got laid and it was all </v>

3999
02:46:03.181 --> 02:46:04.014
<v Speaker 3>about them wanting to get laid and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>had resiliency and they weren't </v>

4000
02:46:07.021 --> 02:46:10.070
<v Speaker 3>snowflakes and they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these</v>

4001
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:12.170
<v Speaker 2>women could fucking run in heels and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

4002
02:46:12.171 --> 02:46:13.100
<v Speaker 2>all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>

4003
02:46:13.250 --> 02:46:14.320
<v Speaker 2>they had grit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4004
02:46:14.660 --> 02:46:15.820
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4005
02:46:16.100 --> 02:46:18.230
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't feel that that's what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening today.</v>

4006
02:46:18.290 --> 02:46:19.123
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's certainly no role models like </v>

4007
02:46:20.361 --> 02:46:20.811
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

4008
02:46:20.811 --> 02:46:21.950
<v Speaker 2>what's really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah,</v>

4009
02:46:21.951 --> 02:46:24.410
<v Speaker 2>Jessica Parker and Kim control fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>hated each other.</v>

4010
02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:27.620
<v Speaker 2>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a thing to yesterday with Kim.</v>

4011
02:46:27.630 --> 02:46:29.450
<v Speaker 2>Katrina St.</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's not my friend.</v>

4012
02:46:29.451 --> 02:46:30.284
<v Speaker 2>She's never been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want your sympathy because Kim </v>

4013
02:46:32.540 --> 02:46:36.310
<v Speaker 2>controls was her brother died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone in her family died and she sends</v>

4014
02:46:36.311 --> 02:46:38.150
<v Speaker 2>her best wishes and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's like,</v>

4015
02:46:38.151 --> 02:46:39.620
<v Speaker 2>she's not my French.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never been my friend.</v>

4016
02:46:39.621 --> 02:46:42.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't like her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And apparently they were just.</v>

4017
02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she said she's a shitty person.</v>

4018
02:46:46.101 --> 02:46:49.880
<v Speaker 2>And she said all this stuff about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like right after my brother died,</v>

4019
02:46:49.881 --> 02:46:50.714
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

4020
02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:52.760
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What thought it was her brother?</v>

4021
02:46:52.790 --> 02:46:53.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4022
02:46:53.511 --> 02:46:54.650
<v Speaker 2>Like the whole thing.</v>

4023
02:46:54.770 --> 02:46:55.880
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4024
02:46:55.881 --> 02:46:56.714
<v Speaker 2>so this whole thing about this comradery</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this union of women all together and </v>

4025
02:47:01.221 --> 02:47:04.320
<v Speaker 2>fighting against not horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4026
02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Horseshit people hate each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the Rock and tie,</v>

4027
02:47:07.501 --> 02:47:10.790
<v Speaker 2>reese and fast and the furious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't really like each other.</v>

4028
02:47:11.030 --> 02:47:12.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a scam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>

4029
02:47:12.940 --> 02:47:14.450
<v Speaker 2>She's married to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matthew Broderick,</v>

4030
02:47:14.451 --> 02:47:15.284
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4031
02:47:15.350 --> 02:47:17.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was.</v>

4032
02:47:17.030 --> 02:47:18.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4033
02:47:18.080 --> 02:47:19.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't follow that stuff,</v>

4034
02:47:19.971 --> 02:47:20.950
<v Speaker 2>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4035
02:47:21.260 --> 02:47:22.700
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think my wife made.</v>

4036
02:47:23.570 --> 02:47:24.403
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a good point that women with </v>

4037
02:47:26.691 --> 02:47:27.740
<v Speaker 2>grit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4038
02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:30.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean you don't get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What were the role models that you have?</v>

4039
02:47:30.201 --> 02:47:32.000
<v Speaker 2>The kardashians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have sex in the city.</v>

4040
02:47:32.030 --> 02:47:33.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a.</v>

4041
02:47:33.380 --> 02:47:35.330
<v Speaker 2>What does that on housewives?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real housewives.</v>

4042
02:47:35.720 --> 02:47:38.330
<v Speaker 2>How to Kim Kardashian and get famous </v>
<v Speaker 2>sucking Dick.</v>

4043
02:47:39.380 --> 02:47:40.700
<v Speaker 2>It was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a porn tape,</v>

4044
02:47:40.701 --> 02:47:41.534
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4045
02:47:41.670 --> 02:47:42.503
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She released a sex tape that was </v>

4046
02:47:43.311 --> 02:47:44.840
<v Speaker 2>apparently was engineered by her family.</v>

4047
02:47:45.350 --> 02:47:47.270
<v Speaker 2>That's what I heard too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

4048
02:47:47.330 --> 02:47:49.910
<v Speaker 2>But it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you see what that lady's done,</v>

4049
02:47:49.940 --> 02:47:51.170
<v Speaker 2>like how she's organized it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look.</v>

4050
02:47:51.171 --> 02:47:52.880
<v Speaker 2>And it's been very successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had a plan.</v>

4051
02:47:52.940 --> 02:47:53.773
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at it in terms of a </v>

4052
02:47:54.201 --> 02:47:56.270
<v Speaker 2>financial venture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

4053
02:47:56.360 --> 02:47:58.010
<v Speaker 2>A windfall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievable.</v>

4054
02:47:58.011 --> 02:48:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Believable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazingly successful,</v>

4055
02:48:00.980 --> 02:48:01.813
<v Speaker 2>but chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in a sense they're a type of a </v>

4056
02:48:03.921 --> 02:48:07.880
<v Speaker 2>royalty in lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Modern plastic royalty.</v>

4057
02:48:08.210 --> 02:48:10.430
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the culture of nothing.</v>

4058
02:48:10.590 --> 02:48:14.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Culture of fake asses and nonsense.</v>

4059
02:48:14.270 --> 02:48:16.040
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're talented.</v>

4060
02:48:16.041 --> 02:48:16.874
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4061
02:48:17.740 --> 02:48:20.210
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the talented at doing that.</v>

4062
02:48:20.420 --> 02:48:21.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a talent,</v>

4063
02:48:21.711 --> 02:48:22.544
<v Speaker 2>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been wise strategically and </v>

4064
02:48:25.500 --> 02:48:27.740
<v Speaker 2>keeping themselves out in the public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4065
02:48:27.741 --> 02:48:28.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

4066
02:48:28.920 --> 02:48:29.561
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4067
02:48:29.561 --> 02:48:31.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a Kim Kardashians.</v>

4068
02:48:31.241 --> 02:48:34.010
<v Speaker 2>The kardashians family hater by any </v>
<v Speaker 2>stretch of the imagination.</v>

4069
02:48:34.011 --> 02:48:36.080
<v Speaker 2>I've had a couple of bits about them or </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of mocked them,</v>

4070
02:48:36.470 --> 02:48:37.070
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4071
02:48:37.070 --> 02:48:38.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't hate them.</v>

4072
02:48:38.330 --> 02:48:39.163
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think wrong with what they're </v>

4073
02:48:39.481 --> 02:48:40.314
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people that are way </v>

4074
02:48:40.701 --> 02:48:43.640
<v Speaker 2>dumber than them that I don't hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does she hate them?</v>

4075
02:48:43.641 --> 02:48:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Because they're famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that doesn't make any sense.</v>

4076
02:48:45.260 --> 02:48:46.520
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't hate them at all.</v>

4077
02:48:46.521 --> 02:48:47.354
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know them or watch their </v>

4078
02:48:48.171 --> 02:48:50.390
<v Speaker 2>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Kim is really pretty.</v>

4079
02:48:50.470 --> 02:48:51.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

4080
02:48:52.460 --> 02:48:54.500
<v Speaker 2>I just think what it says about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

4081
02:48:54.530 --> 02:48:56.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that makes you like,</v>

4082
02:48:56.071 --> 02:48:56.751
<v Speaker 2>it reminds you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4083
02:48:56.751 --> 02:48:58.310
<v Speaker 2>your culture is vapid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4084
02:48:58.311 --> 02:49:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of our culture is that,</v>

4085
02:49:00.201 --> 02:49:03.350
<v Speaker 2>and I think they came along at an </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing time,</v>

4086
02:49:03.351 --> 02:49:04.184
<v Speaker 2>the time of social media where it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>all about likes and blood pictures that </v>

4087
02:49:07.471 --> 02:49:11.310
<v Speaker 2>have been doctored up by photoshop and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing is really fascinating.</v>

4088
02:49:11.520 --> 02:49:12.540
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4089
02:49:12.541 --> 02:49:13.740
<v Speaker 2>the father is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4090
02:49:13.741 --> 02:49:15.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm not getting enough attention as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

4091
02:49:15.241 --> 02:49:16.350
<v Speaker 2>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be a check.</v>

4092
02:49:16.351 --> 02:49:18.240
<v Speaker 2>And then he gets amazing amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

4093
02:49:18.690 --> 02:49:19.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4094
02:49:20.370 --> 02:49:22.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say that I'm being callous and</v>

4095
02:49:22.830 --> 02:49:24.660
<v Speaker 2>that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened.</v>

4096
