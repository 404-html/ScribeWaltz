6
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.670
<v Speaker 1>I had a smile on my face,</v>

7
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:20.250
<v Speaker 1>that whole movie and when I heard all these people that were like,</v>

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

16
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>after Avatar.</v>

17
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.480
<v Speaker 1>People reporting depression like,</v>

18
00:00:37.481 --> 00:00:37.920
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

19
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.160
<v Speaker 1>cause they liked our depression is a real thing.</v>

20
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

22
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.930
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how it's recognized.</v>

23
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:48.550
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if like psychologists are behind it as well.</v>

24
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.040
<v Speaker 1>You have avatar depression.</v>

25
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like you've got a bad case of Avatar to press.</v>

26
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.820
<v Speaker 1>That's not outside of the realm of possibility.</v>

27
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.683
<v Speaker 1>Oh I'm sure.</v>

28
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.231
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

30
00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I know the depression that comes from playing a really awesome video game and</v>

31
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>then going out into the world.</v>

32
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.211
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

33
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Like we were driving here and we'd go back,</v>

34
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 1>we'd go by this mountain of rocks and he looks out the window and he goes,</v>

35
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.601
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

36
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:13.261

37
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>what does that look from our,</v>

38
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.863
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

39
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.933
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

40
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what that means.</v>

41
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.260
<v Speaker 1>You have a fantasy environment.</v>

42
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.500
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are you talking about?</v>

43
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.351
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

44
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>I just got this Imac.</v>

45
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 1>I just got this like giant Imac,</v>

46
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>like the biggest monitor I've ever had.</v>

47
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.191
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

48
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:32.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

49
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.413
<v Speaker 1>aren't those awesome?</v>

50
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I've got to see what works.</v>

51
00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:35.101
<v Speaker 1>Suck.</v>

52
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Mine died today.</v>

53
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

54
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:37.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably just a hard drive.</v>

55
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.840
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

56
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 1>I hope not.</v>

57
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.413
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

58
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>I'd got to back your shit up,</v>

59
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.253
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

60
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.350
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>

61
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.670
<v Speaker 1>there are things back.</v>

62
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 1>Not that,</v>

63
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.871
<v Speaker 1>not that computer,</v>

64
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:47.430
<v Speaker 1>because I use that computer just for audio,</v>

65
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.390
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

66
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:53.391
<v Speaker 1>for podcasts and slap a fucking one terabyte drive on it and one time timeshare</v>

67
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>full drives.</v>

68
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>I just keep on running on of hard drive space.</v>

69
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

70
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.983
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

71
00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Fucking sucks.</v>

72
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>That shouldn't needs to go away.</v>

73
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:00.954
<v Speaker 1>What happened to,</v>

74
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.580
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I worked at gateway computers,</v>

75
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we talked about it as anyway he's telling him come on,</v>

76
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:05.521
<v Speaker 1>design it back.</v>

77
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:06.354
<v Speaker 1>It is awesome.</v>

78
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.340
<v Speaker 1>I know you were saying that your shit died but it is awesome and what were you</v>

79
00:02:09.341 --> 00:02:09.901
<v Speaker 1>going to say about that?</v>

80
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:14.901
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say it's like a fucking window and do an alternate universe.</v>

81
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>When you've got a really good video game and you're looking at it,</v>

82
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 1>it's like these,</v>

83
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I think the word video games,</v>

84
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.070
<v Speaker 1>you got to go down the tube is man because you,</v>

85
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.360
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

86
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.821
<v Speaker 1>someone hears,</v>

87
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:24.031
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

88
00:02:24.031 --> 00:02:25.080
<v Speaker 1>I love to play video games.</v>

89
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.520
<v Speaker 1>They're like you fucking nerd.</v>

90
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.650
<v Speaker 1>But it's like hey cause you know it's like what,</v>

91
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>what it's turning into.</v>

92
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:31.494
<v Speaker 1>It's not really,</v>

93
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>it's going to get to the point where it's not video games anymore where it's</v>

94
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:35.911
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

95
00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>Like I feel like it's like world of Warcraft,</v>

96
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.320
<v Speaker 1>starcraft,</v>

97
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 1>all these like a portal.</v>

98
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.541
<v Speaker 1>What we're,</v>

99
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:47.541
<v Speaker 1>this is the very first surge of water and this virtual tsunami that's about to</v>

100
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 1>come subjectively sweeping over everyone.</v>

101
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Because that thing you say about like maybe our neurology can't resist movies</v>

102
00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:56.790
<v Speaker 1>cause it's so overpowering.</v>

103
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like I think that there's gonna be some truth to that</v>

104
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 2>because these games are missing a few components and this is,</v>

105
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 2>this is what I think of when I'm stoned playing world of Warcraft.</v>

106
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 2>If I could smell like,</v>

107
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:11.870
<v Speaker 2>if there was a sense of smell involved in this and also they've made it,</v>

108
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 2>there was a sense of like,</v>

109
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

110
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.740
<v Speaker 2>they've made machines that do that and I don't think it's going to have to be a</v>

111
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:18.574
<v Speaker 2>mind thing.</v>

112
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 2>It's a mind machine thing.</v>

113
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to have to be,</v>

114
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 2>so it's going to be a little stimulate some part of your mind.</v>

115
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you can wear some,</v>

116
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 2>maybe everyone's going to have to shave their head.</v>

117
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.320
<v Speaker 2>Like real players.</v>

118
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.970
<v Speaker 2>The view,</v>

119
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.803
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

120
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.840
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to do like a horizontal Mohawk thing real plus I,</v>

121
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 2>you know like this dude's legit,</v>

122
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.981
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't give a fuck.</v>

123
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:36.600
<v Speaker 2>It was up to club,</v>

124
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 2>but this big stripe shaved on his head and then you put this thing on skin to</v>

125
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:41.850
<v Speaker 2>skin on your head and it,</v>

126
00:03:41.851 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 2>it has precise,</v>

127
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 2>like you line it up on the video game,</v>

128
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 2>it'll show you how to line it up with the exact cortex,</v>

129
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 2>exact portion of your brain.</v>

130
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 2>And then it sends signals that show you like burning,</v>

131
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:53.001
<v Speaker 2>meet,</v>

132
00:03:53.001 --> 00:03:53.621
<v Speaker 2>smell,</v>

133
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:54.620
<v Speaker 2>and show you that.</v>

134
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:55.420
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

135
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.580
<v Speaker 2>but then you know what else it does while you're,</v>

136
00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 2>and this is really weird while you're playing the game and our races,</v>

137
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 2>your memory of your previous life.</v>

138
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 2>So the moment that thing goes on,</v>

139
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.700
<v Speaker 2>you'll have no more past your,</v>

140
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.180
<v Speaker 2>just the memories of the character in the game,</v>

141
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 2>rushing through the game,</v>

142
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:12.971
<v Speaker 2>playing the game,</v>

143
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 2>completely unaware of the fact that you used to exist as a person too.</v>

144
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 2>And then you know what happens,</v>

145
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.260
<v Speaker 2>you're doing a podcast,</v>

146
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.363
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

147
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck man,</v>

148
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:23.440
<v Speaker 2>my heart feels weird.</v>

149
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 2>And you suddenly wake up and your futuristic apart and you're like,</v>

150
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.511
<v Speaker 2>ah man,</v>

151
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:29.590
<v Speaker 2>that game was awesome.</v>

152
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.510
<v Speaker 2>So right now we're playing a game.</v>

153
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

154
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

155
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.611
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

156
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:37.000
<v Speaker 2>like that with a lot of people say this could be like some alien simulation,</v>

157
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 2>you know that we're just an alien and involved in a really high powered super</v>

158
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.460
<v Speaker 2>advanced bad ass video game called planet experience.</v>

159
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 2>The lives of billions of people all individually.</v>

160
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.460
<v Speaker 2>I wrote something once about maybe the life that we're living.</v>

161
00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the reason why it seemed so fake is cause it is fake.</v>

162
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:59.110
<v Speaker 2>And what we are in is some sort of a reality simulation of the roaring twenties</v>

163
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 2>of the technological age.</v>

164
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.610
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe we live in some time where everything is all scented candles and</v>

165
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 2>perfectly lit white rooms and no one has a muscle car and no one's getting their</v>

166
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:10.684
<v Speaker 2>dick sucked.</v>

167
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.471
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

168
00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:15.700
<v Speaker 2>and maybe there's like a simulator that you can run when you run where it's just</v>

169
00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:19.360
<v Speaker 2>chaos but chaos that's entertaining as fuck.</v>

170
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.280
<v Speaker 2>He's like every time you turn around there's some new thing Christina Aguilar</v>

171
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.120
<v Speaker 2>fucking up the national anthem,</v>

172
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.180
<v Speaker 2>2 billion people tuning into the wedding.</v>

173
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.270
<v Speaker 2>There's constant shit going on to keep you entertained and you are,</v>

174
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.750
<v Speaker 2>you are in this biological ride canister.</v>

175
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.171
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

176
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.050
<v Speaker 2>And you're going through this thing and you're in this,</v>

177
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:41.511
<v Speaker 2>you're the,</v>

178
00:05:41.511 --> 00:05:45.700
<v Speaker 2>you're a portal to this ride is your skin and your flesh pops.</v>

179
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:48.370
<v Speaker 2>It pops through into this dimension and you know,</v>

180
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.650
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like you're advocating fantasy.</v>

181
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.330
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like you're advocating,</v>

182
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

183
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:53.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

184
00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Speaker 2>so you want to look at your life as if it's some sort of a simulation.</v>

185
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 2>Just live it as a simulation.</v>

186
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

187
00:05:59.461 --> 00:06:00.294
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying yes I am.</v>

188
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

189
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.131
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>

190
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:01.311
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

191
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 2>It's very empowering.</v>

192
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

193
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.060
<v Speaker 2>I think the first person ever heard suggest that was Mckenna.</v>

194
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.220
<v Speaker 2>I think Mckenna was talking about you.</v>

195
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.133
<v Speaker 2>How did he say it?</v>

196
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.621
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

197
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:10.770
<v Speaker 2>and he was quoting someone else.</v>

198
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.350
<v Speaker 2>So I'm doing a third hand quote,</v>

199
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.710
<v Speaker 2>but he said you should view your life as he's,</v>

200
00:06:16.711 --> 00:06:17.544
<v Speaker 2>say it</v>

201
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.920
<v Speaker 2>as a conspiracy or as view your life as it's as it's as if the world is run by a</v>

202
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 2>select group of people and that group of people is you and your friends.</v>

203
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

204
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.951
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

205
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:31.281
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

206
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:31.611
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

207
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 2>your somehow or another secretly in charge with running the world and running</v>

208
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:38.080
<v Speaker 2>the university and the most important things in the university.</v>

209
00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:38.180
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

210
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.090
<v Speaker 2>you and your friends cause it's the most empowering way to view the world.</v>

211
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.041
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>

212
00:06:42.041 --> 00:06:43.420
<v Speaker 1>because what's the cause?</v>

213
00:06:43.421 --> 00:06:44.231
<v Speaker 1>What's the other side?</v>

214
00:06:44.231 --> 00:06:48.160
<v Speaker 1>The other side of it is this kind of like pseudo empathy for like strangers that</v>

215
00:06:48.161 --> 00:06:48.701
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>

216
00:06:48.701 --> 00:06:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Like so many people wander through their day just frothing with terror or</v>

217
00:06:53.141 --> 00:06:54.520
<v Speaker 1>whatever they've seen on the news.</v>

218
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.470
<v Speaker 1>And so for them the world's awful,</v>

219
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.270
<v Speaker 1>but then they're real situation is usually pretty good.</v>

220
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

221
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:02.640
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

222
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.850
<v Speaker 1>it's like a fucking,</v>

223
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

224
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Bill Hicks has that awesome joke about CNN,</v>

225
00:07:07.091 --> 00:07:10.390
<v Speaker 1>CNN watch the news and then outside it's like beautiful and the grass is</v>

226
00:07:10.391 --> 00:07:11.110
<v Speaker 1>growing.</v>

227
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.910
<v Speaker 1>So there's this mental pollution that comes pouring out of every information</v>

228
00:07:15.911 --> 00:07:17.080
<v Speaker 1>device that we have.</v>

229
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.820
<v Speaker 1>And that like corrupts your mind and you begin to think you're in a horror story</v>

230
00:07:21.821 --> 00:07:25.480
<v Speaker 1>when your real reality is one that's usually quite pleasant.</v>

231
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:26.060
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

232
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.940
<v Speaker 2>that experience,</v>

233
00:07:26.941 --> 00:07:28.020
<v Speaker 2>the [inaudible] experience,</v>

234
00:07:28.021 --> 00:07:28.950
<v Speaker 2>the mushroom experience,</v>

235
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

236
00:07:29.341 --> 00:07:30.174
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>

237
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.970
<v Speaker 2>everybody that is religious wants to believe in God.</v>

238
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:38.250
<v Speaker 2>What I'm telling you is I can show you something that represents God for sure.</v>

239
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.140
<v Speaker 2>You can meet what God is.</v>

240
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.730
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying it's God your meeting,</v>

241
00:07:41.731 --> 00:07:43.440
<v Speaker 2>but you can meet what God is,</v>

242
00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:48.590
<v Speaker 2>what God is is perfect and all knowing and all embracing and loving and wise and</v>

243
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.000
<v Speaker 2>and constantly around you all the time.</v>

244
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.680
<v Speaker 2>Well when you take mushrooms,</v>

245
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.700
<v Speaker 2>that's what you feel.</v>

246
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:54.631
<v Speaker 2>That's what you feel.</v>

247
00:07:54.631 --> 00:07:55.740
<v Speaker 2>You really feel God.</v>

248
00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:59.100
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying that it is God that you're communicating with or what God is</v>

249
00:07:59.101 --> 00:08:01.320
<v Speaker 2>or what are the what even the concept of God.</v>

250
00:08:01.321 --> 00:08:02.310
<v Speaker 2>When you say God,</v>

251
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.190
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden it's this male hierarchy,</v>

252
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.720
<v Speaker 2>a point of you know,</v>

253
00:08:06.721 --> 00:08:10.410
<v Speaker 2>point of reference where you think of like one alpha that controls all.</v>

254
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:15.180
<v Speaker 2>But it's not that God is more like everything I,</v>

255
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:20.340
<v Speaker 2>it's like a super dimensional glob of its efforts.</v>

256
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:21.830
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

257
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:22.700
<v Speaker 1>an intelligence,</v>

258
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:23.121
<v Speaker 1>it's this,</v>

259
00:08:23.121 --> 00:08:24.080
<v Speaker 1>it's always,</v>

260
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.220
<v Speaker 1>and also it's,</v>

261
00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:26.720
<v Speaker 1>it's constantly changing.</v>

262
00:08:26.721 --> 00:08:27.710
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing like it's,</v>

263
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.330
<v Speaker 1>it's like trying to even talk about it.</v>

264
00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:32.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like trying to talk about like a spinning slot machine.</v>

265
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:32.781
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

266
00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:37.220
<v Speaker 1>it's constantly like morphing and shifting and it's so fucking potent.</v>

267
00:08:37.221 --> 00:08:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is that we're runoffs of it.</v>

268
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Like when you see water running down your windshield and like,</v>

269
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.640
<v Speaker 1>streams of water will break into little globs of water.</v>

270
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:47.511
<v Speaker 1>That's what we are.</v>

271
00:08:47.511 --> 00:08:51.830
<v Speaker 1>We're just little broken off globs of superintelligence that have taken on these</v>

272
00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Speaker 1>personalities and think that we're individuals and you know what else breaks off</v>

273
00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>in that</v>

274
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.873
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing?</v>

275
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Elves,</v>

276
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.080
<v Speaker 2>hyper dimensional things that aren't necessarily out to love you.</v>

277
00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:06.081
<v Speaker 2>And like there really is like there are beings out there that are,</v>

278
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:06.954
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

279
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:07.891
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man,</v>

280
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:09.660
<v Speaker 2>like superintelligent toddlers,</v>

281
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:11.040
<v Speaker 2>I think Mckenna talked about it.</v>

282
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:11.760
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

283
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.620
<v Speaker 2>they're like baby God or something.</v>

284
00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

285
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.410
<v Speaker 2>here's the devil's advocate point of view.</v>

286
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.273
<v Speaker 2>Please.</v>

287
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.980
<v Speaker 2>How do you not know that those thoughts,</v>

288
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:24.750
<v Speaker 2>those demons just represent thoughts in your mind and perhaps what that</v>

289
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:29.751
<v Speaker 2>experience is entirely is you contacting your own thoughts and ideas and dreams</v>

290
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:35.310
<v Speaker 2>and hopes and expression without the context of reality attached to them.</v>

291
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:35.611
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

292
00:09:35.611 --> 00:09:37.560
<v Speaker 2>So without the idea of,</v>

293
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:37.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

294
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.260
<v Speaker 2>what you did that you're embarrassed about,</v>

295
00:09:40.261 --> 00:09:44.640
<v Speaker 2>that made you weird about your underwear when you were 13 you know,</v>

296
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:49.641
<v Speaker 2>instead of that maybe it manifests itself in almost a living thing and almost a,</v>

297
00:09:49.721 --> 00:09:53.760
<v Speaker 2>you know that project you're seeing these when you're saying you are beings out</v>

298
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:54.630
<v Speaker 2>there that are fucking with you,</v>

299
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.240
<v Speaker 2>maybe those are things that you've let grow in your mind.</v>

300
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:57.661
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

301
00:09:57.661 --> 00:10:00.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that that's the modern take on it and I think that that's one</v>

302
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.780
<v Speaker 2>useful handle to like get her get,</v>

303
00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:04.470
<v Speaker 2>get to,</v>

304
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.030
<v Speaker 2>to like grab a hold of an ideal.</v>

305
00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:07.610
<v Speaker 2>I'd be considered that when you were in there,</v>

306
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:07.981
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

307
00:10:07.981 --> 00:10:08.251
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

308
00:10:08.251 --> 00:10:11.330
<v Speaker 2>you said you had an experience where like these are projection mechanisms but</v>

309
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.031
<v Speaker 2>this the yeah,</v>

310
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:16.290
<v Speaker 2>that what you're seeing literally is like that thoughts are live there.</v>

311
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.420
<v Speaker 2>They're real things that they look,</v>

312
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.010
<v Speaker 2>you ever heard the possibility,</v>

313
00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:25.011
<v Speaker 2>I mean the discussion rather of the idea that aliens will come through the mind</v>

314
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.630
<v Speaker 2>and that they're not going to manifest themselves in a real form.</v>

315
00:10:27.631 --> 00:10:31.350
<v Speaker 2>And that when you think of the imagination or when you think of dreams and what</v>

316
00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:32.610
<v Speaker 2>we have is some weird,</v>

317
00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:36.030
<v Speaker 2>slippery sort of experience that we can't completely control.</v>

318
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.880
<v Speaker 2>But what if that dimension of dreams,</v>

319
00:10:38.881 --> 00:10:42.420
<v Speaker 2>that sleep dimension that you tap into when all your neurochemistry starts</v>

320
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:45.600
<v Speaker 2>flowing between the blood brain barrier while you're in heavy rem sleep,</v>

321
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.890
<v Speaker 2>what does that is in fact,</v>

322
00:10:46.891 --> 00:10:49.290
<v Speaker 2>another dimension would have that is in fact a world.</v>

323
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.810
<v Speaker 2>And that is where aliens will contact you through.</v>

324
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:56.100
<v Speaker 2>They will contact you through this spiritual dimension instead of a physical</v>

325
00:10:56.101 --> 00:10:56.580
<v Speaker 2>dimension.</v>

326
00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

327
00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.031
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

328
00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:57.870
<v Speaker 2>if that's the case,</v>

329
00:10:57.871 --> 00:11:00.300
<v Speaker 2>and if you think about taking mushrooms and these,</v>

330
00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:01.260
<v Speaker 2>these l show up,</v>

331
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.680
<v Speaker 2>it is possible that negative things that you've created in your own life,</v>

332
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.400
<v Speaker 2>shitty choices or bad energy that you've set forth and then nurtured and and</v>

333
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.880
<v Speaker 2>repressed and put it down and tried to deny it and all these different things</v>

334
00:11:14.881 --> 00:11:18.120
<v Speaker 2>that people do to sort of rationalize creepy things that they're doing in their</v>

335
00:11:18.121 --> 00:11:18.780
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

336
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.780
<v Speaker 2>What if those things manifest themselves as living organisms in the free pool of</v>

337
00:11:23.791 --> 00:11:24.624
<v Speaker 2>your mind?</v>

338
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.081
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

339
00:11:25.081 --> 00:11:25.351
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

340
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:26.011
<v Speaker 2>that's actually,</v>

341
00:11:26.011 --> 00:11:31.011
<v Speaker 2>I think fucking Carl Young said that exact same thing that you met Carl Young</v>

00:13:37.331 --> 00:13:40.060
<v Speaker 1>get a burger because traffic wasn't moving.</v>

431
00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:42.550
<v Speaker 1>That's how bad the logic was working in my mind.</v>

434
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.650

<v Speaker 1>I did that once and the guy took like a bunch of them ever did.</v>

457
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:25.660
<v Speaker 1>He never smoked weed.</v>

458
00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:26.830
<v Speaker 1>You never eat wheat.</v>

459
00:14:26.831 --> 00:14:28.330
